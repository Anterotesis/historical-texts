<HEAD>To Monsieur
William de Schuylenburg,
LORD of Dukenburg,
Counsellor, and Clerk of the Council
TO HIS
BRITANNIC MAJESTY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have taken the Liberty to offer
you a Present which perhaps
will surprize you; for we are ge∣nerally
possess'd with an Opinion
that 'tis impossible for the same Per∣son
to manage both a <HI>Sword</HI> and a
<HI>Pen.</HI> If I had the least Inclination
to pretend to the Quality of an <HI>Au∣thor,</HI>
I wou'd endeavour to demonstrate
the Ʋnreasonableness of that Preju∣dice;
nor do I believe that I shou'd
find it a very difficult Task to perform.
<PB REF="3"/>
I cou'd easily transcribe the Stories of
so many famous <HI>Captains</HI> who were e∣qually
remarkable for their <HI>Wit</HI> and
for their <HI>Valour;</HI> and display'd the
former in their <HI>Writings</HI> with as much
Honour and Success as they signaliz'd
the latter in the most dangerous <HI>Bat∣tles:</HI>
And from these Instances I wou'd
conclude that the nearest and most di∣rect
Way to Glory is to follow the bright
Tracts of those <HI>Illustrious Heroes.</HI>
But since the Prosecution of so noble
an Attempt wou'd require a larger
Stock of Merit and Abilities than ever
I cou'd boast of, I will not be guilty of
so much Vanity as to alledge those <HI>Ex∣amples</HI>
in my own Vindication. Nor
will I trouble You with any study'd or
formal <HI>Apology,</HI> since I'm confident
You will be easily persuaded to forgive
my Boldness in presenting You with
the Observations I made during
my <HI>Travels,</HI> which I thought I might
communicate to the Publick without in∣vading
the Province, or provoking the
Jealousie of <HI>Men of Letters.</HI> I made
<PB REF="3"/>
it my Recreation for some Weeks to pre∣pare
'em for the Press, and shall be sa∣tisfy'd
if they can furnish You with any
tolerable Entertainment for some Hours.
Your <HI>Approbation</HI> is all the Glory,
and the highest Recompence I desire.
'Tis true, I cannot ask so noble a Re∣ward
without discovering the Boldness
of my Ambition; for you have so nice
a Taste, and so exact a Judgment,
that you never bestow that Favour but
on such as merit Applause from all the
World. But I encourage my self with
reflecting on that <HI>Goodness</HI> which is
so natural and peculiar to You, and
even presume to hope that the Sweet∣ness
of Your Temper will put a fa∣vourable
Bias upon Your Judgment,
and incline You to excuse, or at least
to over-look my <HI>Errors.</HI> This, <HI>SIR,</HI>
is the only Favour I beg leave to de∣sire;
for I never entertain'd a Thought
of courting Your <HI>Protection</HI> on the
Score of so mean a Present. I know
that must be obtain'd by a very diffe∣rent
Method; nor do I hope to procure
<PB REF="4"/>
it by any other Way than that by
which all <HI>Good Men</HI> who have the
Happiness to be known to you, may
pretend to it. 'Tis from Your <HI>Genero∣sity</HI>
alone that I expect so glorious an
Advantage, and from that compassionate
and bountiful Inclination, which has
render'd You the Support of so many
<HI>Illustrious Exiles,</HI> whom the Tempest
of the Age has cast upon the Shores
of <HI>Holland,</HI> where, by Your Favour,
they have found not only a Safe but a
Peaceful and Convenient Retreat, and
are enabl'd to out-live the Loss of all
their Hopes and Fortunes. Since then
a Man of Honour may assure himself
of Your <HI>Protection</HI> without being ob∣lig'd
to bribe Your Favour, I might
be justly accus'd both of Folly and In∣justice
if I shou'd endeavour to obtain
it by indirect Methods. No, <HI>Sir,</HI> I
never harbour'd so criminal a Thought;
and the only reason why I make bold to
consecrate the Fruit of my <HI>Travels</HI> to
You, is because this <HI>Dedication</HI> will
furnish me with an Opportunity to ac∣knowledge
<PB REF="4"/>
the vast Debt I owe You.
The Iniquity of Fortune made me in∣capable
of expressing the Sense I have
of Your Goodness; and I can assure
You, that Consideration alone sate hea∣vier
upon me than all the rest of my
Disasters. And is it not natural for a
Man in such a Condition to embrace
the first Occasion he can meet with of
satisfying in some Measure the extreme
Desire he has to express his <HI>Gratitude?</HI>
Permit me then to acknowledge that I
have receiv'd very considerable Favours
from You, that You bestow'd 'em in
the most obliging Manner imaginable,
that I never merited 'em, that You
cou'd not have the least Reason to
believe that ever I cou'd requite 'em,
and consequently that You were only
acted by a Principle of <HI>doing Good,</HI>
without the least hope of a <HI>Return.</HI>
This, <HI>Sir,</HI> is what I desire to publish
to all the World; this is the only Mo∣tive
that incited me to prefix this Let∣ter
to those which You will find in the
Body of the Treatise; and to convince
<PB REF="5"/>
You that I had no other Design in my View,
I shall pnrposely avoid the usual Strain of <HI>De∣dications,</HI>
and save You the trouble of read∣ing
those Praises which Your <HI>Merit</HI> chal∣lenges
from all the World, and Your <HI>Mode∣sty</HI>
will not receive even from Your best
Friends. 'Tis not without extreme Reluctan∣cy
that I decline so inviting a Subject; and
I had almost made bold to tell You, that You
were oblig'd to me for my <HI>Silence.</HI> You
know what a vast Field lies before me, and
with how much Pleasure and Satisfaction I
wou'd have made Use of this Opportunity to
acquaint the World with Your unalterable Love
to Your Country, Your inviolable Fidelity to the
State, Your Zeal and Affection to His Ma∣jesty's
Service, Your extraordinary Abilities and
Capacity for the Management of those impor∣tant
Affairs that are intrusted to Your Care;
the Clearness and Quickness of Your Apprehen∣sion,
the Solidity of Your Judgment, Your
uncommon Generosity, the charming Sweetness
of Your Temper, Your incorruptible Probity,
and all the other eminent Vertues and Endow∣ments,
which hath gain'd You the Esteem and
Admiration of all the World. 'Twou'd be an
<PB REF="5"/>
endless Task to mention all those rare aud no∣ble
Qualities which have so justly intitl'd You
to the Favour of the <HI>greatest King</HI> in the
World. But I must not forget my Promise,
and therefore shall content my self with ad∣miring
you in Silence, after I have begg'd
Leave to assure You that I am, and shall ever
remain, with a profound Respect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most Humble and
most Obedient Servant,
Du Mont.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Custom of Writing <HI>Prefaces</HI> has
been so long establish'd, and is grown
so common, that what was former∣ly
look'd upon as a <HI>Courtesie,</HI> is now
reckon'd a <HI>Duty:</HI> and if the <HI>Reader</HI> be not
coax'd into good Humour, he thinks himself
engag'd in Honour to resent the Affront, and
the <HI>Book</HI> must be damn'd for the Clown∣ishness
of the <HI>Author.</HI> But tho' I dare not
venture to send this <HI>Treatise</HI> abroad without
so necessary an Ornament, I must confess I'm
somewhat puzzl'd how to begin my Address.
'Tis true, I might pretend a Right (and per∣haps
as justly too as many others) to that
thread-bare Excuse of common <HI>Scriblers;</HI> that
neither my Humour, nor Profession inclines
me to set up for an <HI>Author,</HI> that this <HI>Treatise</HI>
was compos'd and design'd for my own pri∣vate
Use, that I happen'd to shew it to some
Friends, and was at last constrain'd by their
perpetual and resistless Importunities, to con∣sent
to its Publication. But tho' I shou'd
spoil my Compliment to the <HI>Reader,</HI> I will
neither endeavour to court his Favour, nor
save my Credit by a <HI>Lie:</HI> that is, I will not
<PB REF="7"/>
pretend that I was either forc'd or perswaded
to a thing which I chose for a Diversion in
my <HI>Winter-Quarters,</HI> where I spent my time
in revising and putting in Order the Notes
I had taken during my Travels. As to the
Method I have observ'd in communicating
my Observations, besides other Advantages 'tis
certainly most convenient for a Man of my
Profession. One that is not accustom'd to
Writing, expresses his Thoughts more
easily in <HI>familiar Letters</HI> than in a <HI>continu'd
Discourse:</HI> for he is neither acquainted with
the Niceties of a correct <HI>Style,</HI> nor able to pre∣serve
an exact <HI>Ʋniformity</HI> and <HI>Connexion</HI> in so
great a Variety of Matter.</P>
<P>'Twou'd be a difficult and laborious Task
to answer all the <HI>Objections</HI> that may be made
against this Work: And therefore since I am
not naturally over-fond of making Apologies,
I'm resolv'd to let it go at a venture, and
take its Fate among the <HI>Criticks,</HI> without gi∣ving
my self the Trouble to consider, much
less to prevent or confute their Censures. How∣ever
it must be acknowledg'd, that 'tis the
Design of all Authors, and mine in particu∣lar,
to <HI>please,</HI> and therefore it will not be im∣proper
to be speak the <HI>Reader</HI>'s Favour, since he
must shortly become my <HI>Judge:</HI> and I may
justly desire to be <HI>heard</HI> before my <HI>Doom</HI> be
pronounc'd.</P>
<P>In the first place, I expect to be censur'd
for writing on a <HI>Subject</HI> which has been al∣ready
handl'd by so many Learned and In∣quisitive
<HI>Travellers,</HI> and seems to be quite <HI>ex∣hausted</HI>
<PB REF="7"/>
by the vast Number of <HI>Relations</HI> with
which they have oblig'd the Public. In An∣swer
to this Objection, I might content my
self with desiring the <HI>Reader</HI> to consult the
<HI>Prefaces</HI> of those Authors who have treated
on the same Subject; but without giving him
the Trouble of perusing their <HI>Reasons,</HI> I can
assure him, that in the following <HI>Letters</HI> he
will meet with several <HI>Observations</HI> that are
omitted by other <HI>Travellers.</HI> I made it my
principal Business to observe the <HI>Manners</HI> and
<HI>Customs</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> which are subject to
frequent and considerable Alterations; and
consequently I may, without Vanity, affirm,
that my <HI>Remarks</HI> will furnish the <HI>Reader</HI> with
a fresher, and more diverting Entertainment,
than the dry <HI>Relations</HI> of a meer <HI>Antiquary</HI> or
<HI>Geographer.</HI> Neither is the Subject so barren nor
so much exhausted, as the <HI>Objection</HI> supposes, and
we commonly imagine it to be. A hundred Au∣thors
have handl'd it before me, and in all Pro∣bability
a hundred more will treat of it after
me. But almost every Writer pursues a dif∣ferent
Method, and takes Notice of some
Things that were neglected by others: and
tho' I have related nothing but what I have
seen or heard, I shall be always glad to per∣use
the <HI>Writings</HI> of succeeding <HI>Travellers,</HI> and
may perhaps find several considerable Re∣marks
in their <HI>Relations</HI> that had escap'd my
own Observation.</P>
<P>'Tis true there are some Things so particu∣larly
describ'd in the Relations of other <HI>Tra∣vellers,</HI>
that I chose rather to omit many beau∣ful
<PB REF="8"/>
<HI>Descriptions</HI> with which I might have em∣bellish'd
my <HI>Work,</HI> than to transcribe or re∣peat
the <HI>Observations</HI> that are already com∣municated
to the Public. As for Example;
what cou'd I have added to the exact Ac∣count
of the <HI>Roman Pantheon, Capitol, Colli∣seum,</HI>
&amp;c. of the <HI>Palace</HI> of S. <HI>Mark</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI>
of the <HI>Great Council,</HI> and a thousand other
Things of that Nature? 'Twill perhaps be
objected, that for the same Reason I ought
to have omitted several other Descriptions,
which I have taken care to insert in my <HI>Let∣ters;</HI>
but to remove that Prejudice 'twill be
sufficient to put the <HI>Reader</HI> in mind that there
is so necessary a <HI>Connexion</HI> between my <HI>Old</HI>
and <HI>New</HI> Observations, that I cou'd not possi∣bly
mention the <HI>latter,</HI> without taking Notice
of the <HI>former.</HI> 'Tis true, I cannot pretend
the same Excuse for that part of my Book,
where I treat of the <HI>Egyptian Pyramids,</HI> of
<HI>Cairo,</HI> and the Ruines of <HI>Alexandria:</HI> But
there is something so wonderful and surpri∣zing
in those Celebrated Monuments of An∣tiquity,
that I concluded the curious <HI>Reader</HI>
wou'd be glad of an Opportunity to refresh
his Memory by Reading the <HI>Two Letters</HI> I
have written on that <HI>Subject:</HI> and as for
those who are already so well acquainted
with these <HI>Curiosities,</HI> that they cannot im∣ploy
their Time with Pleasure in Reading a
New Account of 'em, they may easily save
themselves that Trouble, by skipping over
Ten or Twelve Leaves.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
The same Answer may serve for those who
win <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> apt to censure me for inserting in my
Two <HI>first Letters,</HI> an Abridgment of the <HI>Cam∣pagne</HI>
in <HI>Germany</HI> in 1689. and of the <HI>Barbarities</HI>
that were committed by the <HI>French</HI> in that
Country. And besides, I must beg Leave to tell
those Gentlemen, that several Men of Sense
are of a very different Opinion, and esteem
that an <HI>Ornament,</HI> which they perhaps may
reckon a <HI>Fault.</HI></P>
<P>I cou'd easily dispatch such <HI>nibbling Criticks</HI>
if I were not afraid of being attack'd by
more <HI>formidable Adversaries,</HI> who will abso∣lutely
condemn all those little <HI>Stories</HI> which
I thought fit to insert in my <HI>Work;</HI> either to
give the <HI>Reader</HI> a clearer and more compre∣hensive
<HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> of the
<HI>People</HI> of whom I have occasion to discourse, or
for some other Reasons that need not be menti∣on'd.
Since I must expect to be treated with
the utmost Rigour and Spite by such peevish
and merciless Censurers; I do not think my self
oblig'd either to submit to their Judgment, or
to appease their Anger. And therefore I shall
content my self with telling 'em plainly, that
they may lay aside my <HI>Book,</HI> when they meet
with any Thing in it that offends 'em, and that
I shall be equally unconcern'd whether they
<HI>approve</HI> or <HI>condemn</HI> it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reader</HI> may easily perceive, that I de∣sign'd
not to have ended my <HI>Relation</HI> at <HI>Ve∣nice.</HI>
I thought, in a <HI>Second Part,</HI> to have given
an Account of <HI>Germany, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Flan∣ders:</HI>
but the time of Staying in our <HI>Winter-Quarters</HI>
<PB REF="9"/>
being expir'd, I was oblig'd to quit
my <HI>Closet</HI> for the <HI>Field,</HI> before I had finish'd
my intended Work. In the mean time, if
the <HI>First Part</HI> meet with an encouraging Re∣ception,
the <HI>Second</HI> shall be completed next
<HI>Winter;</HI> if not, I must e'en take my Rest, or
find out some other Employment; for I ne∣ver
was, nor will be of an Humour to cloy
the Public with my Writings.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I must beg leave to complain of the hardness
of the Task you impose upon me, by requi∣ring
me to give you an exact Relation of
our present Campaign, with the Description
of those Cities in <HI>Germany</HI> which I shall have oc∣casion
to visit; but neither the Troublesomness of
such a Correspondence, nor the Sence of my own
Unfitness to Manage it, shall make me decline an
Undertaking by which I may convince you of
my extream desire to obtain the honour of your
Friendship, and to secure my self in the Possession
of it beyond the danger or fear of any future
Alteration.</P>
<P>I shall begin, then, with acquainting you, that
we were about eight Days ago quarter'd in a
City call'd <HI>Spire,</HI> which is now a heap of Stones:
<PB N="2" REF="17"/>
The Inhabitants have been threaten'd these three
Months, with the execution of that fatal Design
of reducing the City to Ashes, and during that
time liv'd in a cruel Uncertainty, and perpetual
Fear of their impending Ruine. <HI>Spire</HI> was situa∣ted
in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> call'd of old <HI>Ni∣metum,</HI>
and its Inhabitants <HI>Nimetes;</HI> it was the
Seat of the Imperial Chamber, compos'd of two
Presidents, one a <HI>Catholick,</HI> and the other a <HI>Prote∣stant;</HI>
and fifteen Counsellors, eight of the <HI>Ro∣mish,</HI>
and seven of the other Persuasion. The E∣lector
of <HI>Triers</HI> held the Bishoprick of that City,
the Sovereignty of which is extended over seve∣ral
fine Territories; and among the rest, <HI>Philipsburg,</HI>
which the Emperor was oblig'd to restore to that
Prelate, by the Treaty concluded with <HI>France</HI> at
<HI>Triers,</HI> in 1685. The Cathedral was a large and
fine Structure, well furnish'd with Lights, and a∣dorn'd
with great Pyramidal Towers at the four
Corners. On the Right-side of the Church stood
the Episcopal Palace, famous for its Architecture,
and enrich'd on the Inside with a great variety of
fine Pictures; and on the other side was the House
of the Canons, with a very ancient Cloyster, in
the middle of which there was a Mount of O∣lives
cut in the Rock, esteem'd to be a Ma∣ster-piece
of Sculpture. Before the Church there
was a great Court or void Space, capable of con∣taining
10000 Men drawn up in <HI>Battalia.</HI> All
the Houses that surrounded it were well built,
especially that of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> which fronted the
Bishop's Palace, where those Fathers had a very
curious Library of above 6000 Volumes, which
was consum'd in the general Conflagration of
the City; with five or six others belonging to
private Persons that were no less considerable.
The Inhabitants of <HI>Spire</HI> were Rich, and lovers of
Pleasure: The City was surrounded with a great
<PB N="3" REF="17"/>
number of Gardens abundantly furnish'd with eve∣ry
thing that might contribute to the Advantage
and Pleasure of the Owners; for besides the Beau∣ty
of the Orange-Trees which were preserv'd there
notwithstanding the Coldness of the Climate; and
the various Ornaments of cover'd and open'd
Walks, Flowers, Water-Works, and Statues; there
was a great abundance of all sorts of Fruit-Trees.
Every Garden had also the convenience of a Plea∣sure-House,
very handsomly built, and all over
Painted and Gilt after the <HI>German</HI> Fashion, in which
the Gentlemen of <HI>Spire</HI> pass'd the time with a great
deal of Satisfaction, some in Drinking, and others
in more charming Diversions. The Town-House
was famous for its Antiquity, which was said to
amount to above twelve Ages since its first Foun∣dation,
but had nothing else to recommend it
to the Observation of Travellers. Before the
Gate there hung on an Iron-Ring, a <HI>Bone of an Arm,</HI>
which equall'd a Thigh-Bone in bigness, and
was proportionably long. 'Tis affirm'd in the
Records of the City, that the Man to whom that
Bone belong'd, whose Name was <HI>Olps,</HI> was twen∣ty
five Foot high, and that he was kill'd about
1300 Years agoe in a Siege against the Town,
the Ladder breaking under him as he was scaling
the Walls; which gave a fair Opportunity to the
Besieg'd to rid themselves of so formidable an E∣nemy,
by pouring whole Hogsheads of boiling
Pitch upon him. His Hip-Bone was also preser∣ved
in the great Hall, which I have often seen,
without giving much credit to the Story; for
tis hard to conceive, that a Man of such a Gi∣gantine
Stature cou'd have escap'd the Obsrvati∣on
of Historians.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>Spire;</HI> The City was taken by
the <HI>Dauphin</HI> about the end of the last Year,
(when he made himself Master of <HI>Philipsburg</HI>)
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
and was immediately put under Contribution;
and besides, 6000 Men were quarter'd in it during
the Winter, which made the Inhabitants believe
they had already suffer'd the severest Effects of
their Enemies Fury. But they were extremely
surpriz'd, when in the last Spring they were com∣manded
to raise 60000 Crowns, under pain of
Burning. This rigorous Order cou'd not be exe∣cuted
without reducing 'em to Beggary; for
Money was already very scarce in the City,
and yet those Wretches put themselves to the ut∣most
stretch to raise the Summ; which they had
no sooner paid, but the Baron <HI>de Monclair</HI> caus'd
a Proclamation to be publish'd with Sound of
Trumpet, commanding all the Inhabitants to re∣tire
with their Goods, because the Town was to
be burnt on the 5<HI>th.</HI> Day after the publishing of
the Order. And to add to the Cruelty of their
Punishment, they were not suffer'd to pass the
<HI>Rhine,</HI> where they might have found some Assi∣stance
among their Friends and Relations, but
were forc'd to retire to <HI>Alsace,</HI> among the <HI>French,</HI>
who treated them like so many Beasts, without
the least Mark of Humanity or Compassion. Af∣ter
all these Severities, they might have found
some Consolation even in the extremity of their
Affliction, if they had been furnish'd with Wag∣gons
for the Transportation of their Goods; but
they were not to expect the least Favour, and were
oblig'd to hire Waggons of the Peasants and Sut∣lers,
who, taking Advantage of their Necessity,
made 'em pay such excessive Rates, that they were
forc'd to leave the greatest part of their Goods
for want of Carriage. In that time of Extremity
I heard some of those miserable Creatures offer
fifteen Crowns a-day for the use of a Horse,
that might have been bought for a smaller
Summ. Never any Man beheld so touching an
<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
Object as was occasion'd by the Grief and Con∣sternation
that cover'd every Face in this unfortu∣nate
City, at the publishing of the Burning-Or∣der.
Our Eyes and Ears were every where salu∣ted
with Tears and Lamentations; the Women
especially mov'd the hardest Hearts with Com∣passion,
their Despair making 'em tear their
Hair, and strike their Heads against the Wall.</P>
<P>At last the fatal Term being expir'd, they
were forc'd to bid a lasting Farewel to the
City, and with it to almost all their Goods and
Possessions. Then their Lamentations began afresh,
and their Despair appear'd more visibly than e∣ver;
nor was it possible for any Heart that was
not entirely divested of all sence of Humanity,
to resist the Motions of Compassion that were
excited at the sight of so deplorable an Object.
Noblemen, Tradesmen, the Poor and the Rich,
began their doleful March, without any Mark
of Distinction, all equally Miserable; with this
only difference, that the Rich were more sensi∣ble
of their Misfortunes than those whose Po∣verty
secur'd 'em from the danger of considera∣ble
Losses. I'm still fill'd with Horrour as often
as I reflect on that dismal Spectacle; and I'm
confident you wou'd not be less deeply touch'd
with a sence of the irrecoverable Ruine of so
many innocent Persons, if you had been an Eye-Witness
of it. You cou'd not have beheld, with∣out
feeling almost the same Transports of Sor∣row,
two or three hundred Noble-women and
Citizens Wives walking on foot in the midst of an
Infinite Crowd of People, and most of 'em fol∣low'd
by five or six small Children, some of 'em
hanging at the Mother's Breast, not knowing
where to shelter themselves during the Night,
nor where to find necessary Refreshment and
Sustenance for their weary'd Bodies; for the ex∣cessive
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
Contributions that were exacted from 'em,
had so drain'd their Purses, that three quarters of
'em were not Masters of one Peny; and those
who had the happiness to preserve the Remain∣ders
of their Money, had hid it under-ground,
for fear of being robb'd by the Soldiers on the
Road, as several of 'em were who had not us'd
that Precaution.</P>
<P>After their Departure, the Town was abandon'd
for two Days to the Mercy of the Soldiers, who
committed a Thousand Sacrileges; for hoping to
find some hidden Treasures, they threw down the
Altars, dig'd up dead Bodies, and rif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the most
Ancient and Venerable Tombs, without sparing
those of an Emperour, and several great Princes
and Prelates that were in the Cathedral, which
they turn'd to a Stable.</P>
<P>After all these Violences, the appointed Day
for the final destruction of the City being come,
the Troops were encampt, and 200 Men, each
with a lighted Torch in his Hand, were Com∣manded
to set fire to the Houses; so that in less
than half a Day the Town was entirely consum'd,
and the last Day of <HI>May</HI> 1689, was the last of
that Ancient City. And lest the Fire shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be
too merciful, the King order'd it to be after∣wards
demolish'd, and 1000 Soldiers are actually
employ'd in levelling it with the Ground. They
will find some difficulty in executing their Fu∣ry
on the great Church, by reason of the unu∣sual
thickness of the Walls, which are all built
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewn Stone; yet the strength of that noble
Edifice cannot prevent its Ruine; for lest the
<HI>Germans</HI> shou'd afterwards lodge themselves in it,
'tis resolv'd to blow it up with a Mine. The House
of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> resisted all the Endeavours of the
Demolishers for two or three Days; but they
were well paid for their Labour with two Treasures

which they found, one of 8000 Livres of coin'd
Silver, hidden under-ground; and the other, which
probably belong'd to some Citizens, who had in∣trusted
it to those Reverend Fathers, consisting of
Plate to the Value of 9 or 10000 Francks, in Iron
Coffers, lying under a heap of Books. You wou'd
hardly give Credit to my Relation, if I shou'd
undertake to give you a particular Account of
the prodigious quantity of Wine that was wasted on
this Occasion; for there was a sufficient Store of
that Liquor in <HI>Spire</HI> to furnish such a City as
<HI>Paris</HI> above a Month: And besides, it was of
the most excellent sorts, all near eight Years old
at least; and even some of the richest Citizens
usually kept it twelve Years, preserving it in large
Casks, many of which contain'd 100 Hogsheads.
I'm persuaded that no other City in the World
cou'd boast of so fine and so numerous Cellars,
as <HI>Spire;</HI> they were deep, large, and well vault∣ed
with great Pillars that sustain'd the whole
weight of the Houses and Streets; so that they
seem'd to be Subterraneous Temples, consecrated
to the God <HI>Bacchus.</HI> The Citizen with whom I
lodg'd had a very stately one, which contain'd
100 Casks, such as those I have already describ'd,
full of the most excellent sorts of Wine. I never
visited this well-stor'd Cellar, but I thought on
our dear <HI>N</HI>—, and wish'd his Company, plea∣sing
my self with the Thought, how nobly I
cou'd have regal'd him, especially with one Cask
of Wine fifteen Years old, that was highly pri∣zed
by all my Friends, tho', for my part, I must
confess, that <HI>Champagne</HI> is infinitely more agree∣able
to me; and I willingly leave all those Gross-body'd
Wines to the <HI>Germans,</HI> whose Heads are
strong enough to bear 'em. My Landlord, M. <HI>Creps,</HI>
was a very rich Man, he had very fine Houses
at <HI>Worms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranckendal,</HI> and <HI>Spire,</HI> besides a small
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
Office in the Imperial Chamber, which in all
yielded him above 15000 Livres a Year, yet by
a deplorable Turn of Fortune, he lost his whole
Estate in less than three Months, and is fall'n so
extremely poor, that he is forc'd at present to
sell Brandy in our Army, and resolves to con∣tinue
that Trade during the rest of the Cam∣pagne.</P>
<P>While we are busi'd in demolishing <HI>Spire,</HI> the
Queen's Regiment, and some others, are employ'd
in the same Exercise at <HI>Manheim,</HI> a small City
built by <HI>Charles Lewis,</HI> Elector Palatine, who had
the conveniency of contriving the Fortifications
as he pleas'd. All the Houses were exactly uni∣form,
and the four Gates might be seen at once
from the Place of Arms in the midst of the
Town. This was so important and advantage∣ous
a Post, that Monsieur <HI>Vauban</HI> said one Day
to the King, That whatever Prince was Master
of <HI>Manheim</HI> and <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> might at once main∣tain
a War against his Majesty and the Empe∣rour.
The Baroness of <HI>Aiguenfeld,</HI> the second
Wife, or (if you will) the Mistress of that Ele∣ctor,
was buri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in this City: And our Soldiers
not only broke open her Tomb, but threw her
Bones without the Walls. The Dutchess of <HI>Or∣leans</HI>
pretends to have receiv'd several ill Offices
from that Lady; but I'm the less inclinable to
think that she was accessory to such an inhuman
Action, when I consider her Kindness to the <HI>Rho∣graves,</HI>
that Barone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s's Children. <HI>Worms, Franken∣dal,
Ladenburg, Openheim,</HI> and <HI>Keidiscum,</HI> are under
the same Sentence that has been executed on
<HI>Manheim</HI> and <HI>Spire:</HI> But since I never was in any
of those Places, I cannot gratifie your Curiosity
with an exact Description of 'em, only I can
inform you that they were considerable Towns,
and that they are either already demolish'd, or
<PB N="9" REF="21"/>
will be quickly reduc'd to such a Condition,
that all that can be henceforth said of 'em is,

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope this Letter will in some measure atone
for my long Silence, and convince you that
my Neglect was not the only Cause of my not
writing to you once every Month, according to
your Desire: For I concluded that a compleat
Relation of the Compaign wou'd be a more ac∣ceptable
Present to you, than if I had sent you
from time to time some interrupted and ill-con∣nected
Accounts of it. Besides, I was so little
Master of my Time during the whole Month
of <HI>August,</HI> that you cannot with Justice refuse to
put a less severe Construction on my Silence:
And I'm confident that after you have read the
Account of my Misfortunes in the beginning of
this Month, you will esteem me a fitter Object
of your Compassion than Anger. Perhaps you
little expected to hear of my Confinement to a
close Prison for fifteen Days; but I can assure
you, that if the Marquess <HI>D'Efiat</HI> had not vouch∣saf'd
me his Protection, and clear'd me of all
<PB N="10" REF="22"/>
my suspected Crimes, in a Letter to Monsieur
<HI>de Chamilly,</HI> for ought I know, I might have been
still in the same Condition. But before I give
you a particular Account of that Accident, the
Order of time obliges me to entertain you with
a Relation of our Warlike Expeditions.</P>
<P>While our Army, in <HI>July,</HI> lay quiet, the Ele∣ctor
of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> attack'd and took <HI>Keiserwaert:</HI>
And we were afterwards inform'd, that,
not content with that Success, he sate down
before <HI>Bonn;</HI> and that <HI>Mentz</HI> was invested by the
Dukes of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Lorrain,</HI> with an Army of
Seventy thousand Men, which oblig'd us to make
a Diversion in the <HI>Palatinate:</HI> And that Design
was executed with so much Fury and Cruelty,
that Posterity will hardly ever give credit to that
part of the History of our Age. We pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the
<HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Philips<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urg</HI> on a Bridge of Boats, in the
beginning of <HI>August.</HI> I need not tell you that
this City was surrender'd to the <HI>Dauphin</HI> on his
Birth-day (<HI>Novemb.</HI> 1.) which he render'd famous
by his first Conquest: But I cannot forbear do∣ing
Justice to the Bravery and Greatness of Mind
which he shew'd on that Occasion. For he was
everywhere present, and neither gave his Orders
by Proxy, nor suffer'd any thing to be done
without his Knowledge. <HI>Philipsburg</HI> is a very in∣considerable
Town, scarce able to contain a nu∣merous
Garison, nor can it boast of one remark∣able
House, but that which belongs to the Go∣vernour.
But, notwithstanding those Defects,
'tis a place of great importance, both by reason
of its Situation between the <HI>Rhine</HI> and a large
and deep Marsh, and its numerous Fortifications.
There was a Redoubt on the other side of the
<HI>Rhine</HI> to defend the Passage of the River, which
the <HI>Dauphin</HI> took in two Days: But there are so
many new Works added, that it may be call'd
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
more properly a considerable Fort than a sim∣ple
Redoubt. The next Day we encamp'd be∣fore
<HI>Heydelberg,</HI> which we invested on the side
next the <HI>Rhine.</HI> This City was part of our last
Year's Conquests, and had paid Contributions
two or three times. Some of our Troops had
their Winter-Quarters in it, and possess'd it with∣out
the least Disturbance till the Spring, when
by an unaccountable sort of Policy, we blew up
the Castle, and left the Town (I think) on pur∣pose
that we might have the pleasure of Besieging it
two Months after: For you must not imagine
because the Trenches were not open'd, that the
Siege was never really intended, since 'tis plain
from reason that we sate down before it with
that design, because we cou'd not have chosen a
more probable way to divert the Imperial Forces:
And besides, 'tis certain that Monsieur <HI>de Duras</HI>
had given Orders for a general Assault the Day
on which the Place was reliev'd by a Detach∣ment
of 3000 Men, who enter'd the Town with
several Boats laden with Ammunition, and all
sorts of necessary Provisions. However, our Ar∣my,
consisting of 25000 Men, with 45 Pieces of
Cannon, lay seven Days before it, during which
time we lost 8 or 900 good Soldiers, besides se∣veral
Officers; and were at last forc'd to leave
a defenceless Town, that might have been storm'd
with Sword in Hand the first Night we sate
down before it: For we had already ruin'd those
inconsiderable Fortifications that defended it, be∣fore
we left it in the Spring: And at the same
time we blew up the Castle, or at least the best
part of it, in which alone the strength of the
Place consisted. Nevertheless all its Defects might
have been corrected by an industrious Master:
And besides, it must be acknowledg'd to be a
Place of great Importance, if we consider the
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
Advantages of its Situation; for it wou'd have
open'd a Passage on the <HI>Neckar,</HI> and made us
Masters of the whole Country as far as <HI>Franckfort.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Heydelberg</HI> is the Chief City of the Palatinate of
the <HI>Rhine,</HI> seated on the <HI>Neckar,</HI> in a Bottom betwixt
two Hills. The Castle where the Electors formerly
resided, stands on a Hillock that commands the
Town, and has the Advantage of a lovely, but of
late neglected Garden. The Strangers that pass'd
thro' this City never fail'd to pay a Visit to the famous
<HI>Tun,</HI> of above a hundred Years standing, and were
usually receiv'd with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llkom▪</HI> which is a Glass
containing about two Quarts. The <HI>French,</HI> who
quarter'd here during the Winter, were so sensible
of the Charms of that hospitable Vessel, that they
left not one Drop in it, tho' it contain'd above
300 Hogsheads of Wine. Near the City there
is a fair Church, consisting of three several Vaults,
under which the <HI>Catholicks, Lutherans,</HI> and <HI>Calvi∣nists</HI>
perform Divine Service. It was built by
<HI>Charles Lewis,</HI> Elector Palatine, who nam'd it
<HI>The Temple of Concord,</HI> to put his Subjects in mind
that their Temporal Safety depended on their
Union; and that a diversity of Interests was not
a necessary Consequence of Difference in Religion.
This City was formerly Mistress of one of the
finest Libraries in the World, which she possess'd
till the Year 1622, when Count <HI>Tilly</HI> having ta∣ken
the City, sent part of the Books to <HI>Rome,</HI>
while the rest were dispers'd like those of <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI>
to the irreparable Loss of the learned World;
since no other Library contain'd so numerous a
Collection of rare Manuscripts.</P>
<P>The City being secur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by a seasonable Re∣lief
from our intended Assault, we decamp'd on
the 9<HI>th.</HI> before Day, and having march'd two
Leagues, arriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d about eight a-clock at the little
Town of <HI>Wiseloch,</HI> which we burnt in our Pas∣sage,
<PB N="13" REF="23"/>
after we had thrust out the Inhabitants.
<HI>Sinsennes,</HI> and several other Villages, met with the same
Treatment from our Dragoons, who were always
entrusted with these fiery Commissions. These
Ministers of our Fury allow'd no longer respite
to the Places they were order'd to destroy, than
what might give 'em leisure to plunder the best
Effects of the Inhabitants, ravish their Wives and
Daughters, and commit a thousand other Disor∣ders.
The Fame of our Cruelties was quickly spread
over the Countries of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> and <HI>Baden,</HI> and
drove away all the Inhabitants of the Towns and
Villages to which we approach'd; who fled from
us as from the Enemies and Destroyers of Man∣kind,
endeavouring to save their Lives in the Woods
and Forests, where many of 'em seeking to avoid
one kind of Death, met with another no less terri∣ble,
and chose rather to be <HI>starv'd</HI> than <HI>kill'd;</HI>
so that from hence-forward during our whole
March, we found not one Person, either in the
Towns or Country thro' which we pass'd. On∣ly
<HI>Weingarten</HI> and <HI>Bruchsal</HI> pretended to stop our
Career; but two Days after they were constrain'd
to Surrender, and both the Garrisons and Inhabi∣tants
were made Prisoners of War, and the Towns
were treated with the same Severity with those
that were formerly mention'd, by the Troops that
enter'd into 'em. At the same time Monsieur <HI>de
Boufflers,</HI> who commanded a Flying Camp, came
before a little Town call'd <HI>Cocheim,</HI> in which there
was a Garrison of 600 Men, and fearing least the
Place shou'd be reliev'd, immediately gave Or∣ders
for an Assault, which was carry'd on and
receiv'd with equal Vigour and Bravery. The
Action lasted two Hours, after which our Men
were oblig'd to retire; but the Major, who com∣manded
in the Town, contenting himself with
so remarkable a Success, and concluding that the
<PB N="14" REF="24"/>
Courage of the <HI>French</HI> Troops was so well cool'd,
that they wou'd hardly venture to return to a
place where they had met with so rough a Treat∣ment,
instead of taking Measures to prevent a
Surprize, went to recruit his Spirits after so hot
an Action, with a Glass of his beloved Wine:
In the mean time Monsieur <HI>de Boufflers,</HI> upon a
Signal which was made to him by some Tray∣tors
in the Town, commanded his Dragoons to
renew the Attack, which they did with greater
Vigour than before, and storming the Town,
ran to the place of Arms, with their Swords in
their Hands, where they found the Garrison drawn
up in <HI>Battalia,</HI> whom they put to the Sword,
not allowing them the benefit of Quarter. The
Slaughter lasted three Hours, during which, Men,
Women, and Children were kill'd without Mer∣cy:
Nor could the Fury of the Soldiers be stopp'd
till the General had by repeated Orders com∣manded
'em to put an end to the Massacre.
They were Masters of the Art of squeezing Mo∣ney
even out of those who had none, which
they had learn'd in <HI>France,</HI> at the expence of the
poor <HI>Protestants;</HI> and here they display'd all their
Skill, using the Inhabitants with the utmost Bar∣barity,
to make 'em discover their Treasures.
From thence Monsieur <HI>de Boufflers,</HI> continuing his
March and his Cruelties, burnt entirely the
Towns of <HI>Keyseresch, Dhonu, Hellesheim, Meyem, Ul∣man,
Kerpen,</HI> and all the other Cities and Villages
of that Country, which oblig'd the Elector of
<HI>Brandenburg</HI> to detach 10000 Men, under the com∣mand
of General <HI>Schonen,</HI> to give him Battle; but
that Unfaithful Officer communicated the Orders
he had receiv'd to the Marquess <HI>de Boufflers,</HI> who
immediately retir'd to <HI>Philipsburg.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="24"/>
In the mean time we were no less careful
than <HI>Boufflers</HI>'s Dragoons to act the part of brave
Incendiaries, and continu'd our March from <HI>Bruch∣sal</HI>
to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aden</HI> and <HI>Durlach,</HI> where we found the
Ware-Houses, Shops, and Houses full of Commo∣dities
and Furniture, but altogether void of In∣habitants,
who were taught by the Misfortunes
of their Neighbours, not to expect our Visit.
The Pillage lasted two Days; after which the
Cities were set on Fire, after the laudable Cu∣stom
of this Campaign.</P>
<P><HI>Baden</HI> is situated in <HI>Suabia,</HI> and gives the Title
of Marquess to a Family, the Head of which is
a Prince of the Empire on a double Account,
both by his Birth, which is Ancient and Illustri∣ous,
and by his Principality, which gives him a
Voice in the Diets of the Empire. The Town
was Rich, embellish'd with fine Houses, fair Streets,
and lovely Gardens; and besides had the Ad∣vantage
of the most remarkable Baths in <HI>Europe.</HI>
The Princess of <HI>Baden</HI> left no means on her side
to preserve their City; she sollicited the Gene∣ral
and the King himself, and offer'd to demo∣lish
the Walls; but all her Endeavours cou'd not
procure the least Mitigation of its Doom, and
<HI>Baden</HI> was laid in Ashes, as well as its Neigh∣bouring
Towns.</P>
<P>Four Leagues from hence lay <HI>Durlach,</HI> call'd in
<HI>Latine, Durlacum,</HI> which gives some Title of Ho∣nour,
to the Younger Branch of the House of <HI>Baden,</HI>
who have also a Voice in the <HI>Diets.</HI> It was in my
Opinion a larger and fairer Town than <HI>Baden,</HI> inha∣bited
by several rich Merchants, and a considerable
number of Persons of Quality, and adorn'd with ma∣ny
magnificent Structures, which I had not time to
consider at leisure, before the fatal Sentence was
executed upon 'em. The Castle particularly was a
stately Edifice; a magnificent Portal open'd a Pas∣sage
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
into a vast Court; from whence we ascended
by a broad Stair-Case, to a large Hall, out of which
you might pass into the Apartments appointed for
Winter and Summer, and all the other Seasons. The
Furniture of all these Apartments was very rich, and
well-contriv'd, at least as far as I cou'd judge by
what was left; for the most precious Part of it, with
all the Plate, was remov'd; only there remain'd se∣veral
Pieces of very fine Tapestry richly Wrought,
Embroider'd Silk Beds of great Value, and some of
Gold and Silver; Tables and Cabinets of <HI>China-Work,</HI>
Looking-Glasses, magnificent Lamps of Chrystal,
and several other Ornaments of the same Nature;
which inspir'd the Beholder with a great <HI>Idea</HI> of
the Richness of that part of the Furniture which
was remov'd. The Platfond of the Library was
enrich'd with Gilding and very curious Paintings,
and it contain'd between four and five thousand Vo∣lumes;
adjoining to this were two Cabinets full of
Papers rank'd from top to bottom in very good
Order. The dispositions of the Gardens were suita∣ble
to the Beauty of the House, and the Eye was
every where saluted with Objects of Pleasure; but
all those Beauties were consum'd by the merciless
Fire, and reduc'd to a few Heaps of Ashes, and
dismal Ruines. During our abode here, the <HI>Germans,</HI>
who had made a Detachment of Two or Three thou∣sand
Men to disturb us, took some of our Men, with
Two hundred Horses that were Forraging in the
Country. They had done the same at <HI>Sinsennes,</HI> and
besides a terrible Sickness made such a prodigious
Havock among our Troops, that when we arriv'd at
<HI>Strasburg</HI> we were forc'd to send above Six thou∣sand
Men to the Hospital, which lessen'd our Army
to such a Degree, that the Number of those who
were render'd useless by the Sickness, with those
who were kill'd at <HI>Heydelberg, Bruch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al,</HI> and <HI>Wein∣garten</HI>
amounted to 11000 Men, of which there
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
were at least 5000 dead, without reckoning above
1000 Horses, that were either taken from us, or
dy'd by the Way; for the ill Weather that had last∣ed
during the whole Campaign, had so weaken'd
and spoil'd 'em, that only such who were very well
mounted were Masters of a Horse fit for Service.</P>
<P>To return to our March; We decamp'd from
<HI>Durlach,</HI> and leaving <HI>Fort-Lewis</HI> on our Right-hand,
which is a strong and well-fortify'd Place, built by
the King's Order, we arriv'd before <HI>Stolof,</HI> the only
Town that escap'd the utmost Marks of our Fury;
for the Magistrates, to appease <HI>Monsieur de Duras,</HI>
presented him with the Summ of 50000 Crowns,
which prevail'd so far on his good Nature, that he
contented himself with ordering the Town to be
pillag'd, and the Walls to be demolish'd. Two days
after we arriv'd near <HI>Strasburg,</HI> where I was constrain'd
to leave the Army, in a manner that was not very
agreeable to my Humour. I was struck with so
much Horrour, when I reflected on the Barbarities,
and the Desolation of so many Towns of which
I had been an Eye-witness, and sometimes an In∣strument,
that I cou'd not forbear expressing my
Indignation, and was therefore look'd upon as a
suspicious Person by some of our most resolute
<HI>Burners.</HI> It happen'd one day, that being en∣gag'd
in a pretty warm Dispute with some Offi∣cers
that were none of my best Friends, at the
General's Quarters, I handl'd those nice Points
with a great deal of Freedom, and plainly told
'em my Opinion of the Revolution in <HI>England,</HI>
and of the Difference between King <HI>William</HI>'s Way
of making War, and that which was in Fashion
among us. So bold a Declaration of my Senti∣ments,
procur'd me the Title of the Prince of
<HI>Orange's</HI> Spy; and Complaints were made against
me to the Count <HI>de Marsin,</HI> Commander of the
Brigade, who order'd me to be apprehended, and
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
carry'd to <HI>Strasburg;</HI> tho' I must own my self ob∣lig'd
to him, that he forbore putting me in the
Mercy of a <HI>Council of War,</HI> till he shou'd receive
a clearer Information of my Crime; in order to
which he commanded my Trunks to be seiz'd,
where he found nothing to confirm his Suspicions,
but a <HI>Book of Psalms,</HI> which was a sufficient Demon∣stration
(of what I did not deny) that I had been
a <HI>Hugonot.</HI> But the Marquess <HI>d' Efiat</HI> had the Gene∣rosity
(as I told you before) to give me so favour∣able
a Character in a Letter which he wrote to
<HI>Monsieur de Chamilly</HI> on this Occasion, that I was set
at Liberty after an Imprisonment of fifteen Days,
without any other Punishment, than that I was
oblig'd to hear the tedious Exhortations of certain
<HI>Jesuits</HI> and <HI>Capuchins,</HI> to whom I promis'd to be a
<HI>Good Catholick</HI> for the future.</P>
<P>We are inform'd that <HI>Mentz</HI> was surrender'd on
the 8<HI>th.</HI> instant, notwithstanding the brave Resi∣stance
made by the Marquess <HI>d' Uxelles,</HI> Governour
of the Place, who perform'd on this occasion, all
that cou'd be expected from a Man of Courage and
an experienc'd Captain; and defended a Place which
is not very considerable for its Strength, against a nu∣merous
Army commanded by two Princes, on whom,
without running the hazard of being accus'd of
Flattery, I may bestow the glorious Title of <HI>He∣roes.</HI>
'Tis true he lost a great number of Men; but
none that are acquainted with Affairs of this Na∣ture,
will be surpriz'd at the lessening of the Numbers
of a Garrison that turn the War upon their Besiegers,
and make three vigorous Sallies in one Day. The
most considerable Loss they sustain'd, was occasion'd
by the general Assault of the Counterscarp, on the
7<HI>th.</HI> instant in the Evening, which lasted five Hours,
and was both carry'd on, and receiv'd with such an
obstinate Fury, that few old Soldiers can pretend to
have seen so warm a Dispute. But at last the Be∣sieg'd
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
were forc'd to retire, their Powder failing,
and most of their Musquets being split; and the
<HI>Imperialists</HI> lodg'd themselves on the Counterscarp,
and began to fill up the Ditch, in order to assault the
Town, which oblig'd the Governour to beat a <HI>Par∣ley,</HI>
and <HI>Capitulate.</HI> The Garrison march'd out with
their Arms and Baggage, Drums beating, Colours
flying, Matches lighted, and their Bullets in their
Mouths, with six Pieces of Cannon, and two Mor∣tars.
I hear the King was so well satisfi'd with the
Marquess <HI>d' Uxelles</HI>'s Conduct on this Occasion, that
he thought he ow'd him no less a Recompence for
making so brave a Defence, than the Government
of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> which is one of the most important
Places in his Dominions, besides a Gratuity of 1200
Crowns, which he has already receiv'd. Nor cou'd
his Majesty have chosen a more deserving Object of
his Favour; for the Marquess <HI>d' Uxelles</HI> is not only
an excellent Captain, but in all other respects a
well-accomplish'd Person. I never heard that he
was accus'd of any other Crimes, but Haughtiness
to his Inferiour Officers, and an Inclination to cer∣tain
Pleasures that were brought into Fashion about
20 or 30 Years ago: but I am so far from pre∣tending
to warrant the Truth of these Accusations,
that I must confess I believe 'em to be meer malici∣ous
Aspersions.</P>
<P>We have also receiv'd Advice, That <HI>Bonn</HI> is very
much straiten'd; so that if the King lose that Place,
he will only retain <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> of all the Conquests
his Son made last Year.</P>
<P>In the mean time I must tell you, with all the
sincerity of a Friend, that my late unjust Impri∣sonment
has mightily cool'd my Affection to the
<HI>French</HI> Service; and besides, as young as I am, my
Thoughts aspire sometimes to more solid Objects
than bare Pleasure. I'm e'en resolv'd then in good
earnest to encrease the number of the <HI>Refugees;</HI> and
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
I'm not a little confirm'd in that Resolution, by a
seasonable supply of Money I have just now receiv'd.
I have no other Business at present, than to put things
in Order for my Departure; intending to begin my
Journey in few Days, on the only Horse I'm now
Master of, for my Servant carry'd away the other two,
which was my whole Equipage. I design in the first
place to visit <HI>Geneva,</HI> and there to expect a fresh Re∣cruit
of Money, before I begin my remoter Travels.</P>
<P>I remember I have heard you express a de∣sire
to be more particularly acquainted with
<HI>Strasburg,</HI> than the Accounts you have hitherto
receiv'd of it cou'd make you; and therefore I
shall take this Occasion to satisfie your Curiosity
before I finish my Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Strasburg</HI> is a large City, very well built, af∣ter
the <HI>German</HI> Fashion, seated at the end of a
vast and fertil Field, extremely smooth and level,
so that you may discover the City from the
Mountains of <HI>Saverne,</HI> which are eight Leagues
distant from it. 'Tis wash'd by the River <HI>Ill,</HI>
and divided into the Old and and New City
by the <HI>Beusche;</HI> and both these Rivers fall into
the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which is but a quarter of a League
distant from the Town. The Bishop of this place
is Suffragan to the Elector of <HI>Mentz;</HI> and at pre∣sent
the Cardinal of <HI>Furstemberg</HI> is Bishop of
<HI>Strasburg</HI> by the Mercy of God, and of the
Crown of <HI>France.</HI> The Count of <HI>Chamilly,</HI> Lieu∣tenant-General
of his Majesty's Armies, is Go∣vernour,
and Monsieur <HI>de Labadie</HI> formerly Major,
was made the King's Lieutenant since I came to
the City. 'Tis a very ancient City, but was
never acknowledged for a Republick till the time
of <HI>Luther,</HI> whose Doctrine it receiv'd: And its
Rights were never since disputed till the Year
1682, when the King made himself Master of
it, as a Dependence, or rather the Capital City
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
of <HI>Alsace,</HI> which belongs to him by Virtue of the
Treaty of <HI>Munster.</HI> You are not unacquainted with
the Methods that were taken to justifie his Pretensi∣ons.
The Eyes of some of the principal Burgoma∣sters
were so well enlighten'd with the Summ of
100000 Crowns, that all their Doubts were clear'd
in a Moment; and those Conscientious Magistrates
put his Majesty in possession of a Place to which
he had asserted his Right by such convincing
Arguments, with all the Self-denial and Disinte∣ressedness
that cou'd be desir'd. But this Restau∣ration
was not made with the Unanimous Con∣sent
of the Citizens, the greatest part of whom
bewail'd, and continue still to bewail the Loss
of their Liberty, which, next the Sovereign Good,
ought to be the dearest Blessing to all ge∣nerous
Minds. Nor are their Complaints ill∣grounded;
for they have been extremely harras'd
of late, and even their Religion cou'd not escape
the Fury of their new Masters. I know not what
Excuse can be pretended for so manifest a Vio∣lation
of the Rights of a free City, that submit∣ted
on Condition that its Liberty, and all its o∣ther
Privileges, shou'd be preserv'd intire. Be∣sides,
if they be only consider'd as Natives of <HI>Al∣sace,</HI>
what plausible Reason can be alledg'd why
they shou'd be treated with greater Severity than
the rest of their Neighbours? Has not the King
an equal Right to the whole Province? and why
shou'd <HI>Strasburg</HI> be singl'd out for the Object of
his Indignation, since there are several less consi∣derable
Places in <HI>Alsace,</HI> whose Privileges are suf∣fer'd
to remain untouch'd? Thus, for Example,
the Inhabitants of St. <HI>Mary aux Mines,</HI> in the <HI>Ger∣man</HI>
part of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> continue still in the enjoy∣ment
of their ancient Rights; the River separates
the Precinct of the <HI>Protestants</HI> from that of the
<HI>Catholicks:</HI> The same Privileges are common both
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
to the Priests and Ministers, and they live in a
peaceful Union without incroaching upon one
another. I was inform'd by the Guardian of the
<HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deliers</HI> in that place, that when the Queen
came thither, in her Journey to receive the <HI>Dau∣phiness,</HI>
she resolv'd to build a Chapel, in perfor∣mance
of a Vow she had made, and appointed
the Place where it shou'd be erected in the Ter∣ritory
of the <HI>Protestants,</HI> who immediately came
to beg her Majesty not to violate their Privile∣ges,
which they shew'd her; and she was so well
satisfy'd with the Justice of their Desire, that
she was easily prevail'd with to countermand her
former Orders. And I can assure you, that the
Privileges of that paltry Village are still preserv'd
with so little innovation, that I have seen with
my own Eyes the <HI>Catholicks</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> per∣form
Divine Service by Turns in the Parochial
Church. But it seems the People of <HI>Strasburg</HI>
were not thought worthy of so favourable a
Treatment. The <HI>Protestants,</HI> who were sole Ma∣sters
of the Cathedral, were compell'd to give
place to the <HI>Catholicks,</HI> who are at present possess'd
both of that and most other Churches in the
City, tho' about twelve Years ago they cou'd on∣ly
pretend a Right to a Chapel that belongs
to the Order of <HI>Malta.</HI> This is certainly one of
the fairest Churches in <HI>Europe;</HI> and I may venture
to say, that its Steeple cannot be parrallel'd in the
whole World: This magnificent Tower is con∣triv'd
with wonderful Art, and the Stones are all
exactly cut into several Figures, which charm the
Eye of the Spectator: Its heights amounts to 560
Foot, and its breadth to 52; the Doors are of
Brass, and proportionable to the largeness of the
Building. Since the <HI>Catholicks</HI> became Masters of
it, they have built a great Altar, according to the
Modern way, in the Floor of the Nave, which
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
is of a Triangular Figure, with large Mar∣ble
Columns at the Angles, supporting a Dome
adorn'd with many <HI>Basso-relievo's,</HI> and fine
Paintings. The Tabernacle is in the middle of
the Altar, enrich'd with excellent Sculptures;
and all the other Ornaments are Beautiful be∣yond
the possibility of Improvement. But all
the Charms of so rare a Piece of Work∣manship
cannot long detain the Spectator from
satisfying his Curiosity with a View of that ad∣mirable
Clock built by the Chapter, which marks
the Minutes, Hours, Days of the Month and
Week, the Age of the Moon, Signs of the <HI>Zodi∣ack,</HI>
and the Centuries or Ages of the World,
by a Wheel that performs only one Round in
the space of a hundred Years. If you wou'd
have the pleasure to behold all the Beauties of
the Clock, you must wait till Noon, when the
twelve Apostles appear, and each knocks with a
Hammer on the Bell. The striking of this, as
well as of all the rest of the Hours, is preceded by
the crowing of a Cock, who claps' his Wings,
stretches out his Neck, and Crows so naturally,
that if your Eyes did not convince you that he
is made of Copper, you wou'd certainly conclude
him to be really that which he represents. Immedi∣ately
after the History of the <HI>Annunciation</HI> appears,
the Door of the Virgin's Chamber opens, and the
Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> comes to intimate her Conception;
the Virgin, who is on her Knees at Prayer, turns
to hear his Message; and at the same time the
<HI>Holy Ghost</HI> descends upon her Head in form of a
Dove: And all these Motions are perform'd with
an admirable Exactness.</P>
<P>This beautiful Church is not the only Orna∣ment
of <HI>Strasburg:</HI> The rest of its Buildings de∣serve
an attentive Consideration, especially the
Fortifications, on which the King has bestow'd
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>
such prodigious Summs: The Citadel has its pe∣culiar
Beauties, where the King entertains a Com∣pany
of <HI>Cadets.</HI> But the City is so extremely
large, and lies so open, that all the Works with
which it is surrounded, cou'd hardly resist the
Attacks of a powerful Enemy, if it were not co∣verd
on all sides by the impregnable Forts ere∣cted
by his Majesty's Order, on the Bridge over
the <HI>Rhine;</HI> for all the Advantage an Army cou'd
propose by taking the City while those Forts re∣main
in the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> wou'd amount
to no more than the Possession of a large and
strong Prison.</P>
<P>'Twou'd be needless to describe the Manners
and Customs of the Inhabitants, since they are
so observant of all the Fashions of their New
Masters, that a meer Stranger wou'd imagine 'em
to be natural <HI>Frenchmen.</HI></P>
<P>I'm persuaded, Sir, you'll be as weary in Read∣ing
as I am in Writing this Letter; however,
I'm resolv'd that neither of these Considerations
shall discourage me from pursuing my Design of
presenting you from Time to Time, with Rela∣tions

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Left <HI>Strasburg</HI> about the end of the last Month,
and passing by <HI>Saverne, Phalsburg,</HI> and <HI>Marsal,</HI>
(which is much different from what it was here∣tofore)
arriv'd at <HI>Metz</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> from whence
the Cardinal of <HI>Furstemburg</HI> was gone some Days
before. He retir'd to this place in the beginning
of the Year, not thinking himself secure at <HI>Bonn:</HI>
And he was even so sensible of the Danger with
which that place was threaten'd, that he brought a∣long
with him the very Bolts of the Doors of
the Episcopal Palace. In the mean time he put
on a seeming Confidence, and talk'd of nothing
but Conquests and Electorates, promising great
things to all his Friends; and even levy'd two
Companies of Soldiers for his Guard, whom he
was afterwards forc'd to disband for want of
Money to pay 'em. I staid two Days at <HI>Metz,</HI>
to consider all its Rarities. The City is pretty
large, and tolerably well Fortify'd. There is a
Company of <HI>Cadets</HI> in the Citadel, which has
four Bastions, with good Ditches full of Water.
The Cathedral, which is dedicated to S. <HI>Stephen,</HI>
is built on the declivity of a Hillock; so that
whereas we usually ascend to other Churches,
we must go down seven or eight Steps to this.
It is a large Building, tho' there is nothing re∣markable
in it but the Bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ismal Font, consisting
of one piece of <HI>Porphyrie,</HI> about ten Foot long,
which is a Rarity in this Country. The Bishop
assumes the Title of a <HI>Prince of the Holy Empire;</HI>
and is a Suffragan of the Elector of <HI>Triers.</HI> This
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
City was formerly the Metropolis of the King∣dom
of <HI>Austrasia,</HI> which <HI>Clovis</HI> I. gave to his Na∣tural
Son <HI>Thierry,</HI> creating him the first King of
it: Afterwards it purchas'd its Liberty for the
Summ of 100000 Crowns, of <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillon,</HI>
at his departure for the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> and main∣tain'd
the Character of a Republick till the Year
1552, in which it was treacherously seiz'd by the
Constable <HI>de Montmorenci,</HI> in the Name of <HI>Henry</HI> II.
For pretending to go to the assistance of the
<HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> he ask'd permission to en∣ter
the City, under pretext that he had fall'n sick
by the Way; and the next Morning sent to ac∣quaint
the Mayor and Echevins of the Town,
that he was desirous to communicate an Affair
of great importance to 'em before his Death.
When he saw 'em all met together in his Cham∣ber,
he started up, and thrust his Poniard into
the Mayor's Breast, for a Signal to his Followers
to stab the rest of the Magistrates: And imme∣diately
after the Execution of that cruel Trea∣son,
the <HI>French</HI> run about the Streets, crying, <HI>Vi∣ve
le Roy,</HI> and made themselves Masters of the
Gates, and afterwards of the whole City. About
the end of the same Year, it was in vain besie∣ged
by <HI>Charles</HI> V. who was forc'd to make a
shameful Retreat by the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> who de∣fended
the place. Since that unsuccessful Attempt,
<HI>Metz</HI> remain'd still under the Dominion or ra∣ther
Protection of our Kings: For the Inhabi∣tants
carry'd all their Appeals before the Impe∣rial
Chamber at <HI>Spire,</HI> till <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. establish'd
a Parliament in this place, extending its Jurisdi∣ction
over <HI>Toul, Verdun,</HI> and the Country of <HI>Mes∣sin.</HI>
The Emperour complain'd of this Innova∣tion;
nor was the Contest that happen'd on this
Occasion entirely decided, till the Peace that was
concluded in 1648. Besides the Parliament, the
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
King erected a new Court of Judicature here
some Years ago, which has had the Impudence
(if I may use that Expression without exposing
my self to the same Censure) to cite before it
Kings and Sovereign Princes, to yield Homage
and Fealty for some Territories over which they
pretend to have a Right of Superiority, as the
Counties of <HI>Chini</HI> and <HI>Alost,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Deux-Ponts,</HI>
and several others.</P>
<P>This is the only City in <HI>France</HI> where <HI>Jews</HI>
are permitted to settle; and there are even some
Towns in <HI>Alsace</HI> where they dare not lodge one
Night. At <HI>Strasburg</HI> they are forc'd to pay thir∣ty
<HI>Sous</HI> at the Gate, before they are suffer'd to
enter the City; and I have been often surpriz'd
at the extraordinary dexterity of the Toll-ga∣therers
in discovering a Man of that Nation.</P>
<P>From <HI>Metz</HI> I came to <HI>Nanci,</HI> the chief City
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and Residence of the Dukes of that
Name. 'Tis hardly possible that a Town which
has chang'd its Masters so often, shou'd be re∣markable
for its Riches: However, 'tis very well
fortify'd; and the same Prince by whose Orders
'twas almost entirely ruin'd in 1661, was after∣wards
pleas'd to repair it. The River <HI>Meurte</HI>
passes by the Walls, and fills the Ditches, which
are of a considerable Depth. The City is divi∣ded
into the High and Low Town; and the
Ducal Palace, which is seated in the former, is
a very large Structure, of an admirable
Architecture, and adorn'd with many fine Pi∣ctures.
Among its other Rarities, there is a Hu∣mane
Figure of Wood, consisting of several Pie∣ces,
fitted together with so much Exactness and
Art, that it may be made to imitate all the
Motions and Gestures of a living Man. S. <HI>George</HI>'s
Church is particularly remarkable for the Magni∣ficent
Tombs of the Dukes that lie inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d there.
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
About seven or eight Years ago this City was
depriv'd of two of its noblest Ornaments; the
famous Culverin, that shot a Bullet to S. <HI>Nicho∣las,</HI>
a Village two large Leagues from <HI>Nanci;</HI> and
the Brazen Horse, that carri'd the Statue of one
of the Dukes of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> These are cer∣tainly
the finest cast Pieces in <HI>France,</HI> and were
always thought too heavy for Carriage, till a
certain Engineer undertook to remove 'em, and
succeeded in the Attempt. The latter was de∣sign'd
to support the King's Statue in the Place
of Conquests at <HI>Paris,</HI> but was found to be of
too small a size; and the other was carry'd to
<HI>Dunkirk.</HI> The Inhabitants of this City, and, in
general, all the Third State (or Commons) of
<HI>Lorrain,</HI> are still extremely devoted to the In∣terest
of their true and natural Prince; and scru∣ple
not to express their Affection to him on all
Occasions, with a certain innocent Frankness,
which together with their Clownish way of Speak∣ing,
is esteem'd by the <HI>French</HI> rather worthy of Laugh∣ter
than Anger. But the Nobility are so dazzl'd
with the glaring Prospect of Court-Preferment,
that they seem to have quite forgot the loss of
their ancient Privileges, which were so great un∣der
the Government of their Dukes, that they
were in a manner Sovereign Princes; whereas at
present they are reduc'd to an equal Level with
the rest of the Gentlemen of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>I stay'd not at <HI>Nanci,</HI> but continuing my Journey
towards <HI>Dijon,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Langres</HI> in <HI>Champagne.</HI> This
City is seated on a Mountain almost inaccessible on
all sides: but the Inhabitants have no reason to be
proud of the strength of its Situation, which makes
it a kind of Prison; for the Descent from the Town
is extremely uneasie, and a Man may without Va∣nity
boast of his Lungs, if he can climb from the
bottom of the Hill to the Gate, without losing his
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
Breath. The People of the Country call this the
<HI>Maiden-City,</HI> both because it has not been taken for
several Ages, and by reason of its Fidelity to the
Crown: The Bishop is both a Spiritual and Tem∣poral
Lord, and has the Title of Duke and Peer of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day I pass'd thro' one of the most
charming and fertil Plains in <HI>France,</HI> and arriv'd at
<HI>Dijon.</HI> The City begins to appear at a considerable
distance, and presents a Traveller with the pleasant
Prospect of 100 Spires that overtop the Houses; for
which reason <HI>Dijon</HI> is usually call'd the <HI>Town of Stee∣ples.</HI>
'Tis seated on the Banks of the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>che</HI> and <HI>Suson,</HI>
and was founded by the Emperour <HI>Aurelian,</HI> tho'
some affirm that 'tis much more ancient, and that
he only repair'd it. But not to invade the Province
of Antiquaries, I shall content my self with assu∣ring
you that 'tis a very fine City: The Streets are
large and fair, the Courts spacious, the Buildings
very beautiful, and the Churches extremely magni∣ficent.
Among the rest I cannot forbear taking no∣tice
of the famous Abbey of S. <HI>Benign,</HI> which was
built by <HI>Gregory,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Langres,</HI> after he had
miraculously found the Body of that Saint. 'Tis
one of the largest, and highest Structures that are
anywhere to be seen, adorn'd with three Stone-Spires,
the heighth of which is suitable to the rest
of the Building. The Abbey-Church of S. <HI>Stephen</HI> is
on the other Side of the City, and is no less remark∣able
for its Beauty. The Front of <HI>Our Lady's</HI> Church
surpasses all the rest, consisting of a large Clock-Tower
all over wrought, rising between two others
smaller, but no less curiously adorn'd, which charm
the Eyes of the Beholder. S. <HI>John's</HI> Church, the
Holy Chapel, the Convents of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and
<HI>Cordeliers,</HI> and generally all the rest of the Churches
and Convents deserve particular Observation, espe∣cially
that of the <HI>Carthusians,</HI> without the City,
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
towards the <HI>Red Gate,</HI> which is one of the richest
Monasteries in the Kingdom. There are a hundred
<HI>Monks</HI> in it, who observe with so religious a Strict∣ness,
their Vows of Solitude and Silence, that a
Stranger visiting the Place wou'd be tempted to
think it were uninhabited. And I may venture to
add, that perhaps they may make a better use of
their Revenues than any other Convent in the King∣dom:
for besides a considerable Summ which they
give to the Hospital of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> they distri∣bute
every Week five or six hundred Loaves to the
Poor. They have a very fine Cloyster, and a finer
Church, where the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and a King
of <HI>Poland</HI> lie interr'd in magnificent Tombs.</P>
<P>On a Hillock, on the other Side of the City,
there is a Convent of one of the Orders of <HI>Mendi∣cant</HI>
Friers, said to be the House of S. <HI>Bernard's</HI> Fa∣ther,
who was Lord of the Place that still retains
the Name of <HI>Bourg-fontaines.</HI> The Room where he
was born, which is a very little and low Hall, of a
square Figure, is turn'd to a Chapel, with this In∣scription
over the Door: <HI>Come, my Children, and I
will bring you into the House of my Father, and into
the Chamber where my Mother brought me forth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dijon</HI> is the Capital City of the Dutchy of <HI>Bur∣gundy:</HI>
'tis the Seat of a Parliament, Generality or
general Receipt of the <HI>Finances,</HI> Chamber of <HI>Ac∣counts,</HI>
and a Court that takes Cognizance of Affairs
relating to the Coining and Value of Money; and
besides the States of the Province meet here once in
three Years: so that it wants only the Dignity of
an <HI>Episcopal See,</HI> being under the Jurisdiction of the
Bishop of <HI>Langres.</HI> It had formerly very considera∣ble
Privileges; and our Kings at their Accession to
the Crown, and as often as they enter'd into the
City, were oblig'd to swear to preserve 'em. But
that Custom was abolish'd by the present King,
when he pass'd this way to receive the Queen at her
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
Arrival from <HI>Spain.</HI> For when the <HI>Mayor</HI> accom∣pany'd
with the rest of the Magistrates, presented
the Keys of the City, together with a Copy of
their Privileges to his Majesty, humbly beseeching
him that he wou'd swear to preserve 'em, after the
Example of all his Predecessors, and even of the
late King of Glorious Memory; Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>
reply'd, <HI>Are you so insolent as to impose an Oath upon
your King?</HI> The Magistrates surpriz'd at so severe a
Reprimand, answer'd with a great deal of Respect,
that they pretended not to impose any thing, but
only begg'd and hop'd to obtain that Favour from
his Majesty's Justice and Goodness. <HI>I understand
your Meaning,</HI> reply'd the Cardinal, <HI>you wou'd be a
Free City and Commonwealth. And I assure you, in
his Majesty's Name, that, without taking an Oath,
he considers you as such, but prepare your selves to be∣come
his Conquest.</HI> This Threatning was quickly ex∣ecuted,
for the next Day 8000 Men enter'd the
City, and the Cardinal made a general Alteration
in the Magistracy. The Mayoralty of <HI>Dijon</HI> was
the best Place of that Nature in <HI>France;</HI> for besides
the Title of a Viscount, the Government of the
City, and of all the Third Estate or Commonalty
of <HI>Burgundy</HI> was annex'd to it. The Inhabitants of
this City are generally of a very free and sociable
Temper, and the Women enjoy all the Advantages
of an honest Liberty. So charming a Society puts
a kind of easie Constraint upon Strangers, and
makes 'em break all their Resolutions of hastening
their Departure: for 'tis impossible to stay here four
and twenty Hours without making some agreeable
Acquaintance, which may afterwards prove the
Source of a great deal of Pleasure. The narrow
Compass of a Letter will not allow me to insert
the Relation of a very pleasant Adventure that I
met with in this place; but I'm resolv'd to make

<P><HI>CHaalons</HI> is a considerable City, honour'd with
the Title of a <HI>County,</HI> and is the same with the
ancient <HI>Cabilonum</HI> mention'd in <HI>Caesar's Commentaries.</HI>
It appears by the Ruines of an old <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI>
that this place was formerly possess'd by the <HI>Romans.</HI>
I lodg'd at the <HI>Pelican,</HI> where I had the good For∣tune
to meet with three Merchants of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who
were returning thither, and promis'd to shew me
all the Rarities of that City. We had scarce tra∣vell'd
a Mile, when we met with a Priest walking
a-foot, in a pretty genteel Garb: He was a Man
of a very serious Mien, but talk'd wittily. He ac∣cepted
the Civility of one of our Company, who
offer'd him the Conveniency of riding behind him
half a League of bad way, thro' which we were
oblig'd to pass. This Accident gave us occasion to
discourse of the Uneasiness of travelling on Foot,
and of the Happiness of those who by Virtue of
certain <HI>Charms,</HI> can ride 30 or 40 Leagues a day.
I was never fond of believing what I cannot com∣prehend,
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
and I must confess my Reason was too
hard for my Faith on this Occasion. However I
know not whether I shou'd have been able to with∣stand
the Opposition of some of my Fellow-Tra∣vellers,
if he who had the Priest behind him had
not vigorously undertaken my Defence. The Di∣spute
continu'd for some time pretty warm on both
sides, till our mutual Weariness rather than Want
of Arguments, made us at last consent to chuse the
Priest, who had not yet sided with either Party,
to be Judge of our Difference. He very gravely
told us, that the controverted Story was a certain
Truth, and that he knew some Persons who were
Masters of that Secret; I cou'd not forbear laugh∣ing
at the serious Tone with which he pronounc'd
Sentence against me; and he was so vex'd at my
Incredulity, that he began to maintain his Assertion
with a great deal of heat. Immediately his Fellow-Horseman
took up the Cudgels, and they engag'd
in a Debate which lasted about a Quarter of an
Hour; till at last the Priest perceiving that 'twas
in vain to contend longer with so obstinate an
Adversary, told us plainly that he himself cou'd do
the Feat, tho' he never us'd to put it in Practice;
and that if his Opponent had a Mind to see the
Experiment, he wou'd make his Horse carry him
to <HI>Mascon</HI> in two Hours. The Merchant took him
at his word, and summon'd him to perform his Pro∣mise,
to which he consented, and immediately the
Horse gallop'd away with so prodigious a Swiftness,
that we lost sight of 'em in a Moment. This Acci∣dent
did not much surprize us at first; for we
thought the Priest had a Spur conceal'd in his hand,
with which he prick'd the Horse: in the mean time
we rode on, but cou'd neither see, nor hear the
least News of our Gallopers till we arriv'd at <HI>Mascon</HI>
on the morrow, where we found the Merchand ve∣ry
melancholick. He told us that he was carry'd
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
to <HI>Mascon</HI> exactly in two Hours after he left us, with
so much Ease, that he imagin'd all the while he
was riding at a Hand-Gallop; but that his Horse
fell dead assoon as he enter'd the Stable. He con∣cluded
that the Priest was a <HI>Wizard,</HI> and was so
firmly perswaded of the Truth of his Opinion, by
the concurring Testimony of our Landlord, who
knew the Man, that he enter'd an Accusation a∣gainst
him, and procur'd him to be apprehended
the same day. I was oblig'd to give Evidence with
the rest, and to declare all that I had seen him do,
which, in my Opinion, cou'd not amount to a con∣vincing
Proof of his Guilt. I know no Reason
that shou'd hinder us from supposing that a good
<HI>English</HI> Horse, such as the Merchant's was, might
with a good Spur be made to gallop eight Leagues
in two hours, and without any Enchantment fall
dead at his Journey's End. Yet this Accident made
a great Noise, and the <HI>Poor Devil</HI> was sent to Prison,
where I left him. I had almost forgot to tell you
that they found in his Pockets a Piece of Parch∣ment
four fingers breadth long, and two broad,
with this Sentence in <HI>Red Letters, Adjutor meus, &amp;
Protector meus, tu Domine, nè derelinquas me,</HI> with four
small <HI>Crosses,</HI> one at each End, one above, and ano∣ther
below, which they fansi'd to be a certain <HI>Charm</HI>
or <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Mascon</HI> we proceeded on our Journey to
<HI>Lyons,</HI> where I was forc'd to sell my Horse, who
was gall'd under the Saddle-Bow. I resolv'd to
spend some Days in this Place, that I might have
time to take a full View of a City that is esteem'd
the Largest and most Considerable in the Kingdom,
next to <HI>Paris,</HI> and is certainly worthy of all the
Curiosity of a Traveller. 'Tis seated at the Conflu∣ence
of the <HI>Rhone</HI> and the <HI>Saône,</HI> in a Bottom be∣tween
two Hills. The Houses equal, or rather ex∣ceed
those of <HI>Paris</HI> in Heighth, some of 'em amount∣ing
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
to six Stories; which makes the Streets
somewhat Dark, by reason of their Narrowness.
There are many fine Courts in the City, but none
of 'em are comparable to <HI>Belle-Cour,</HI> which is em∣bellish'd
with Rows of Trees; tho' its principal
Ornament consists in the Company that resort to
it; for 'tis the general Rendezvous of all the Peo∣ple
of Quality and good Breeding; and since the
Ladies here are no less Generous than Charming,
and cannot justly be accus'd of Inhumanity to
their Captives, there are many Intrigues form'd in
this Place, which are carry'd on with all the
Tenderness and Pleasure that a reciprocal Passion
can inspire.</P>
<P>To give you a compendious Account of the
publick Edifices in <HI>Lions,</HI> in which respect it holds
the first Rank, without Controversy, among all
the Cities of <HI>France;</HI> I shall begin with the Me∣tropolitan
Church, dedicated to S. <HI>John,</HI> and foun∣ded
by <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> on the Ruines of
a Temple formerly consecrated to <HI>Augustus.</HI> There
is a <HI>Clock</HI> near the Choir, which surpasses that
of <HI>Strasburg</HI> in the fineness of its Contrivance and
Workmanship; for, besides all the Rarities men∣tion'd
in the Description of that famous Machine,
the Clock of <HI>Lions</HI> has several peculiar Beauties;
among which I shall only take notice of the An∣gel
that Chants the Hymn of S. <HI>John</HI> with all
the exactness imaginable. The Needle that marks
the Hours, and grows longer or shorter according
to the various dimensions of the Oval Dial, and
the Days of the Week mark'd by Figures that
appear every Morning in a Nich on the top of
the Clock, in the room of those that possess'd
the same place the Day before.</P>
<P>The <HI>King of France</HI> by Virtue of his Crown, is
the first <HI>Canon</HI> of this Church; and all the rest
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
have the Title of <HI>Counts;</HI> and must prove their
Nobility before they can be receiv'd.</P>
<P>There are several other Magnificent Churches
in <HI>Lions.</HI> That of <HI>Nôtre-dame de Forvieres</HI> is one
of the most ancient, which was formerly dedi∣cated
to <HI>Venus.</HI> Every curious Traveller ought to
view the City from the Steeple of this Church,
where he may have a distinct Prospect of its Ex∣tent
and Situation. Adjoining to this are the
Ruines of the Palace of <HI>Augustus,</HI> and of a Neigh∣bouring
Amphitheatre, where Learned and Inqui∣sitive
Antiquaries may find an excellent Oppor∣tunity
to display their Skill in the Examination
of an infinite Number of Inscriptions, Statues,
Tombs, Urns, Medals, and other rich Monu∣ments
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Grandeur. But my unac∣quaintedness
with those Studies makes me purpose∣ly
decline entring upon this Subject; since I'm con∣fident
you'll be better pleas'd with my Silence,
than if I shou'd send you an imperfect or erro∣neous
Account, under the specious Title of <HI>A
Description of the Antiquities of</HI> Lions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Town-House</HI> is a Master-piece of Art, com∣pleatly
furnish'd with all the Advantages and Or∣naments
of Beauty, Situation, Extent, Height,
Architecture, Marbles, Paintings, Gardens, Foun∣tains,
Antiquities, and every thing else that may
recommend a Building to the Observation of a
Curious and Knowing Traveller. Its Front re∣gards
the <HI>Place des Terreaux,</HI> which is one of the
most pleasant Courts in in the City; and before
it there is a lovely Fountain, which is none of
its least Considerable Ornaments. In the first place
I took notice of a large Clock-Tower, rising between
two high Pavilions, under which is the Entry to the
Palace adorn'd with large Columns of a precious kind
of Marble. Then I went up some Steps, and
coming under the Pavilions, observ'd two Tables
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
of Brass, where I found engrav'd in Ancient Cha∣racters,
the Patent granted by the Emperour <HI>Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dius</HI>
to the Inhabitants of <HI>Lions,</HI> when he bestow'd
the Privileges of <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens upon 'em. From
thence I enter'd into the First, and afterwards
into the Second Court, where I consider'd with
a great deal of Pleasure and Attention, the Stru∣cture
and Design of that Majestick Mass of Buil∣ding,
which is of a Square Figure, and bounded
at the four Corners with as many large and ve∣ry
high Pavilions. Afterwards I went down to
the Garden, which is embellish'd with Gravel
Walks, Beds of Flowers, Fountains, and a hun∣dred
other Ornaments. After I had satisfy'd my
Curiosity with a View of the external Beauties of
this Noble Structure, I return'd to admire the in∣side
of it. I went up a pair of winding Stairs,
of a very excellent Contrivance, to the Hall,
where I was agreeably surpriz'd with its Large∣ness,
Gilding, Paintings, and especially a great
number of Pictures of the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> which
are all finish'd Pieces: And in the the other A∣partments
I observ'd a vast variety of different
Beauties, which I dare not undertake to describe.
I spent the whole Morning in this House, and
employ'd the Afternoon with a great deal of
Satisfaction, in visiting the <HI>Hospitals,</HI> which may
be reckon'd among the most considerable Founda∣tions
of that Nature in <HI>France. Hòtel Dieu</HI> is a
spacious Structure, well built, and very rich:
All sorts of diseas'd Persons are receiv'd into it;
so that 'tis always very full, and wou'd hardly
be able to maintain so vast a Charge, notwith∣standing
the greatness of its Revenues, if the
Archbishop did not bestow upon it the Profits
accruing from the Dispensation of eating Eggs,
Milk, Flesh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Hospital <HI>de la Charite</HI> is a
Modern Foundation; and tho' tis not near so large
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>
as the former, it may be justly reckon'd equal to
it in other respects. On the top of a great Por∣tal,
that serves for an Entry to the Building,
there is the Figure of a <HI>Pelican,</HI> tearing her Breast,
to feed her young ones; the true Emblem of
<HI>Charity</HI> I observ'd one thing at <HI>Lions</HI> which I
had not seen in any other part of <HI>France,</HI> I mean
the Place of <HI>Refuge</HI> for Criminals, which is nei∣ther
a Church nor Royal Palace, but a House
appointed for that Purpose, and usually call'd the
<HI>Sanctuary.</HI> Towards the Gate <HI>des Trions,</HI> I saw the
<HI>Aqueducts</HI> that were built by the <HI>Romans</HI> for the
Conveyance of Water into the City; and not far
from thence there is a Cave, call'd the <HI>Grotto,</HI>
which is also said to be one of their Works.
The Country about the City is embellish'd with
a vast number of lovely Seats, among which <HI>la
Duchere</HI> and <HI>la Claire</HI> deserve a particular Observa∣tion.
The City has six Gates, three Bridges, a∣bout
two hundred Streets, and above a hundred
Churches, Convents, or Chapels. The Archbishop
is the chief Prelate of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> and by Virtue
of his Primacy receives Appeals from all the
parts of <HI>France</HI> in Ecclesiastical Cases. Monsieur
<HI>de Villeroy</HI> is the present Archbishop, and Lieute∣nant-General
of the whole Province. He is de∣scended
of a very honourable Family, but is cer∣tainly
one of the roughest and least Complaisant
Men in the World. I cannot forbear relating
to you, upon this occasion, a very pleasant Di∣scourse
that pass'd between this Prelate and
Monsieur <HI>de la Feuillade.</HI></P>
<P>That Mareschal, says the Story, riding Post to
<HI>Turin,</HI> in a very mean Garb, to dispatch some
Affairs of Importance, stopt at <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> to deliver a
Packet from the King to the Archbishop, who
taking the Bearer for an Ordinary Courier, be∣cause
he pretended to no higher Quality, ask'd
<PB N="39" REF="36"/>
him, <HI>Whether there were any</HI> News <HI>at Paris.</HI> Green
Pease, <HI>my Lord,</HI> reply'd the Mareschal. <HI>You mistake
my meaning, Friend,</HI> said the Archbishop; <HI>I wou'd
know what People were</HI> saying <HI>when you left Paris?
My Lord,</HI> answer'd the Mareschal, <HI>they were</HI> saying
<HI>Vespers.</HI> Then the Prelate perceiving that the pre∣tended
Courier abus'd him, fell into a Passion, saying,
<HI>How, Friend? where were you taught to speak thus to
Persons of my Quality and Character? What are you?—What
do People use to</HI> call <HI>you? Why, my Lord,</HI> reply'd
the Mareschal, <HI>some are pleas'd to</HI> call <HI>me Friend,
others Monsieur, and the King calls me Cousin.</HI> These
Words surpriz'd the Archbishop, who, considering
the Mareschal more attentively, at last knew him,
and made an Apology for his incivility. Never∣theless
I can hardly be induc'd to believe that a
Man of his Quality wou'd have stoop'd to such
<HI>punning Wit,</HI> which is only graceful in the Mouth of
a true <HI>Courier:</HI> Tho' 'tis well known that Mon∣sieur
<HI>de la Feuillade</HI> was a Person of a very odd
and singular Humour. You have doubtless read
what an Author of great Reputation relates con∣cerning
his Discourse to the King about the Arch∣bishop
of <HI>Rheims;</HI> and if you can believe that
Story, you will not think this incredible.</P>
<P><HI>Lions</HI> is a very ancient City, known to <HI>Titus Li∣vius</HI>
and <HI>Plutarch</HI> by the Name of <HI>The Island.</HI> The
Name which it still retains was given to it by
<HI>Anthony,</HI> (who obtain'd <HI>Celtica Gallia</HI> for his part of
the Empire) when he enter'd the City on a Tri∣umphant
Chariot drawn by twelve <HI>Lions;</HI> and he
afterwards caus'd Money to be coin'd in the same
place, of which I have seen some Pieces, bearing his
Figure on one side, and on the other a <HI>Lion,</HI> with
the Word <HI>Lugduni.</HI> The Town it self neither is,
nor can be made very strong; but 'tis comman∣ded
by three good Castles which defend its Ave∣nues.
The first is the famous Fort of <HI>Peter An∣cise,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="37"/>
built on the top of a steep Mountain, with
the rare Advantage of an excellent Spring of Wa∣ter;
the second is that of S. <HI>Sebastian;</HI> and the
third has the Name of S. <HI>Clair.</HI></P>
<P>I intended to have gone directly from <HI>Lions</HI> to
<HI>Geneva;</HI> but I soon found that I cou'd not pro∣secute
that Design without throwing my self
into unavoidable Dangers; for the <HI>Protestants</HI> are so
narrowly watch'd every where, that 'tis absolutely
impossible to travel thither without a Pass-port, un∣less
a Man were Master of the Invention of fly∣ing
thro' the Air. Nor is it very safe to demand
a Pass-port of the Archbishop; for very lately he
order'd two Merchants to be apprehended, for
no other reason than that they were going to <HI>Ge∣neva.</HI>
That <HI>Name</HI> alone is sufficient to make any
Man pass for a <HI>Heretick</HI> that dares venture to
pronounce it; and he may reckon himself favour∣ably
treated if his Crime be not immediately
judg'd worthy of the <HI>Gallows.</HI> You cannot ima∣gine
with what care I avoid the mentioning of
so dangerous a Word; and, I assure you, I'm so
much in Love with the Principle of <HI>Self-preserva∣tion,</HI>
that I talk of nothing but <HI>Rome;</HI> and pre∣tend
that the only Design of my Travels is to
wait upon the Duke <HI>de Chaûnes.</HI></P>
<P>All this Caution, and the Commotions that
at present disturb this Country, are occasion'd
by the return of the <HI>Vaudois,</HI> who arming them∣selves
in the Canton of <HI>Bern</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> with
a Secrecy that prevented even the Suspicions of
their Enemies, form'd two Bodies, one of 1200,
and the other of 3000 Men; and embarking on
the Lake of <HI>Geneva,</HI> forc'd their way thro' <HI>Savoy</HI>
to their own Country, in spite of the uni∣ted
Forces of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> who oppos'd their
Passage, and oblig'd 'em to five or six Battels,
or rather Skirmishes, in which the <HI>Vaudois</HI> had
<PB N="41" REF="37"/>
still the Advantage; but all those who were
caught straggling were made to pay for their Fel∣lows,
and immediately hang'd without Mercy.
'Tis impossible for a considering Person to reflect
without amazement, on the Success of that En∣terprize.
The first Body of those poor Exiles had
so little Experience in the Management of War∣like
Expeditions, that there was not one Officer
among 'em to conduct the rest; for they had no
other Commanders but one Monsieur <HI>Arnaud,</HI> a
Minister, and under him a Mason, nam'd <HI>Turel,</HI>
for their Lieutenant-General. Judge, Sir, whether
such doughty Captains were fitted for the At∣chievement
of an Attempt, which a Triple num∣ber
of regulated Troops durst not have undertaken.
This Consideration makes me very inclinable to
believe that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> not only knew and
allow'd, but was the Promoter, and even the Au∣thor
of their Design; especially since 'tis plain
that he might have easily prevented the Execu∣tion
of it, by cutting off their Passage, and ma∣king
'em perish in the Mountains.</P>
<P>I have said enough to convince you, that 'tis
not safe for me to prosecute my intended Jour∣ney
to <HI>Geneva;</HI> however I'll leave no means un∣essay'd,
to get out of the limits of <HI>France,</HI> and to
break thro' all the Difficulties that lie in my
Way. In pursuance of that Design, which I con∣fess
seems in a manner impracticable, I'm resolv'd
at all Adventures to go to <HI>Grenoble,</HI> that I may
at least draw <HI>nearer</HI> the Confines of the King∣dom,
in expectation of a more favourable Op∣portunity
to get <HI>beyond</HI> 'em. I am,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Acquainted you in my last with my Resoluti∣tion
to continue my Journey to <HI>Grenoble.</HI> At
my departure from <HI>Lions</HI> I hir'd a <HI>Post-Ass</HI> at
S. <HI>Siforins,</HI> out of pure Curiosity to try so rare
an Experiment: Tho' I must confess this way of
Travelling is not altogether without its Advanta∣ges;
for the Rider may boldly venture a Fall,
without running the hazard of breaking his Neck.
I pass'd thro' <HI>Vienne,</HI> a very Ancient City, and
of Old much esteem'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> notwith∣standing
its disadvantageous Situation at the
bottom of two great Mountains, which dar∣ken
the Place extremely. <HI>Pilate,</HI> the Governour
of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and our Saviour's Judge, was after∣wards
sent hither; and they still show the <HI>Prae∣torium,</HI>
or Hall of Justice, where he was wont to
pronounce Judgment. There is a round Stone in
the Wall with this Inscription, <HI>This is the Globe of
Pilate's Scepter;</HI> tho' its unfitness for such an Use
makes me rather inclinable to believe, that the
Inscription speaks of the House, which might be
call'd <HI>The Globe of a Sceptre,</HI> by way of Figure or
Allusion. They also make Strangers take notice
of a square Tower, where they pretend he ended
his Days, after an Imprisonment of Seven Years.
The City is full of such-like Antiquities, which
are the only things in it that deserve a Travel∣ler's
Observation; for the Buildings are very in∣considerable.
S. <HI>Severus's</HI> Church stands in a Place
where formerly the <HI>Heathens</HI> ador'd a <HI>Hundred Gods,</HI>
under a great Tree, that was afterwards cut
<PB N="43" REF="38"/>
down and rooted up by that Saint's Order, as
appears by this Inscription on a Column:
<Q>Arborem Deos Severus evertit<LB/>
Centum Deorum.</Q></P>
<P>There goes a Story, that under that Tree there
was found a <HI>Death's-Head,</HI> full of Gold and Sil∣ver,
with which the Church was built. I will
not pretend to demonstrate the falseness of this
Tradition; but I think I may venture to conclude,
that either the Head was very big, or the Wages
of Workmen in those Days very low; for such a
Structure cou'd not now be erected for sixty thou∣sand
Crowns.</P>
<P>Without the City, in a place call'd <HI>The Field de
l' Aguillé,</HI> there is an high <HI>Pyramid,</HI> consisting of
several Stones join'd together without Mortar or
Cement, and supported by an Ancient Vault of
the same kind of Architecture, resembling a little
Chapel. The Inhabitants of <HI>Vienne</HI> pretend that
this Pyramid was erected by an Emperour, with
a Design that his Ashes shou'd be plac'd in an
Urn on the top of it, that his Tomb might be
nearer Heaven. The Archiepiscopal Church is
consecrated to S. <HI>Maurice,</HI> whose Head is pre∣serv'd
in it. The Archbishop assumes the Quali∣ty
of <HI>Primate of the Primates of the Gauls;</HI> preten∣ding
a right to that Title, in opposition to the
Archbishop of <HI>Lions,</HI> against whom he has a Suit
on this Occasion, that (if we we may judge by
Appearances) will not be soon decided. <HI>Vienne</HI>
was the Capital City of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> before the ere∣ction
of a Parliament at <HI>Grenoble;</HI> and therefore
the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> among the rest of their Ti∣tles,
style themselves <HI>Dauphins of Viennois.</HI></P>
<P>From thence continuing my Journey, mounted
as before, at the rate of five <HI>Sous</HI> by the Stage,
<PB N="44" REF="39"/>
which is the ordinary Price; I and my Ass had
the Fortune to meet with a Couple of Fellow-Travellers.
Immediately I accosted my Compa∣nion,
and finding nothing either in his Mien or Di∣scourse
that deserv'd Contempt, I concluded that
he was a Merchant of <HI>Lions</HI> or <HI>Grenoble.</HI> About
two Hours after our Meeting, perceiving at a con∣siderable
distance a Coach drawn by Six Horses,
and attended with some Horsemen, coming to∣wards
us, he presently alighted, and turn'd his
Ass loose: Then shrinking up one of his Arms,
and turning it awry, as if he had been Lame, he
walk'd bare-headed to the Boot of the Coach, and
begg'd Charity of the Passengers. I was extreme∣ly
surpriz'd at so odd and unexpected an Action,
nor cou'd I divine the Meaning of it; for I
thought it almost impossible that a Man, who, I
imagin'd, was neither Poor nor Sick, cou'd be
guilty of so much Baseness: However, since my
Beast had already carry'd me so far, that I cou'd
not observe distinctly what he said or did, I re∣solv'd
to suspend my Judgment till I shou'd learn
the reason of it from his own Mouth. Assoon
as he came up, I ask'd what he went to do at
the Coach; <HI>Somewhat,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>that will doubt∣less
surprize you: Perhaps you did not believe me to be
a profess'd Beggar; yet I assure you I have no other
Trade; and if you stay at</HI> Grenoble, <HI>you may be a
Witness of my Diligence in that Vocation. I'm going
to the Hospital in that City, where I'm sure of a Lodg∣ing,
for three Days, during which I hope to get three
Pistoles.</HI> I was no less astonish'd at what I heard
him say, than at what I had already seen him
do: But he went on with the same Frankness,
and told me the whole History of his Life. He
said he was born at <HI>Avignon,</HI> of a considerable Fa∣mily
in that City, and that he had actually a
Revenue of above 200 Livres; that during his
<PB N="45" REF="39"/>
Infancy he had so strong an Inclination to Beg∣ging,
that he usually stole away from his Father
and Mother to ask Alms on the High-ways;
where he sometimes pick'd up twenty or thirty
<HI>Sous</HI> a Day, which made him so fond of that
Course of Life, that he cou'd never afterwards
leave it. He assur'd me, that the Trade of
Begging was attended at least with as much
Pleasure as Pain; and that he was so accu∣stom'd
to it, that he was resolv'd to make it
the only Business of his Life. In the mean
time I hearken'd to him with an Admira∣tion
that wou'd not suffer me to inter∣rupt
him; and he scrupl'd not to acquaint me
with most of the usual Tricks of his <HI>Fellow-Vaga∣bonds.</HI>
They spend their whole Lives in wandring
from one Hospital to another, and know exactly
all the Customs of those Places, and the various
Offices of Charity that were appointed by the
Founders to be perform'd in 'em. Some of 'em
cover themselves with Rags, and putting their
Arms or Legs out of Joint, take up their Post at
a Church Door from Morning to Night, while
others go about in a pretty decent Garb, and
pretending to be poor Officers who have been
robb'd of their Money, and are at a great distance
from their Friends and Relations, beg the Chari∣table
Assistance of those whom they meet, with
a certain Bashfulness, and mournful Tone, that
deceives many well-dispos'd Persons. He that in∣structed
me in all these Mysteries, was of the Se∣cond
Order, and contemn'd the others as a sort
of <HI>Puny Mumpers,</HI> who had neither Courage nor
Ambition: Adding, that he got more in a Day
that the best of them cou'd do in a whole Month.
Nevertheless these <HI>Strolers</HI> depend not wholly on
Charity; they have another Trade which is no
less Gainful than Begging, I mean the selling of
<PB N="46" REF="40"/>
<HI>Pass-Ports</HI> to Travellers. My Companion percei∣ving
that I had none, desir'd me to buy one of
him; and at the first Inn where we alighted,
shew'd me at least a Hundred. I ask'd him the
Price of One: <HI>There are some,</HI> answer'd he, <HI>of all
Prices, as well as other Commodities; for some are Au∣thentick,
others forg'd; some of an old, others of a fresh
Date; and if you will be satisfy'd with such as are
Counterfeit, you shall have 'em for fifteen</HI> Sous <HI>a-piece.</HI>
I thank'd him for his Ingenuity; but told him,
that I cou'd not trust to a false <HI>Pass-Port. Yet
they are as sure as the rest,</HI> answer'd he, <HI>for they
are never call'd in Question; and all the Authentick</HI>
Pass-Ports <HI>I have, are procur'd on the Credit of such
as I wrote with my own Hand, for otherwise they
wou'd not give me any: However, you may please your
self both in the Choice and Goodness of your Commodi∣ty;
for I have some for all Places.</HI> Then I ask'd him
one for <HI>Geneva;</HI> but he told me, that to his great
Sorrow and Loss, 'twas impossible to obtain one
for that Place; assuring me, that if he had a
Hundred of 'em, he cou'd dispose of 'em all at
the Rate of Ten Pistoles a-piece. At last I gave
him two Pistoles for a <HI>Pass-Port</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> preten∣ded
to be granted by the Archbishop of <HI>Lions</HI> to one
<HI>Bidault,</HI> and afterwards ratify'd and approv'd at <HI>Vienne.</HI>
He swore and protested that 'twou'd infallibly pro∣cure
me an unquestion'd Passage; but the extream
desire I had to make my Escape out of <HI>France</HI> ra∣ther
than any Credit I gave to his Asseverations,
made me willing to run the Hazard; tho', after
all, I apprehended the Danger to be greater than
it really was: For assoon as I presented my coun∣terfeit
<HI>Pass-Port</HI> to the Marquess <HI>de S. André,</HI> he
granted me another without the least Difficulty, ap∣pointing
me to pass thro' <HI>Chambery, S. John de Mo∣rienne,</HI>
and <HI>Turin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="40"/>
<HI>Grenoble</HI> became the Capital City of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI>
when <HI>Charles</HI> VII. establish'd a Parliament in it,
and has ever since continu'd in the possession of
that Dignity. This Country was bequeath'd to
King <HI>Philip de Valois,</HI> by <HI>Humbert,</HI> the last Prince
of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> on condition that from thenceforth
the Presumptive Heir of the Crown of <HI>France,</HI>
shou'd be stil'd <HI>Dauphin of Viennois;</HI> and bear in
his Coat-Armorial the Arms of <HI>France</HI> quarter'd
with those of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> which are, Or, <HI>a Dolphin</HI>
Azure, <HI>Crested, Finn'd, and Ear'd</HI> Gules. The Tomb
of <HI>Andrew, Humbert's</HI> Son, is in the Church of the
<HI>Dominicans</HI> that fronts the <HI>Place de Grenette,</HI> which
is the finest in <HI>Grenoble,</HI> both for its Largeness, and
the Magnificence of the Building with which 'tis
adorn'd, especially the Parliament-House, to which
you enter thro' a Court, border'd with Shops full
of all sorts of Commodities: 'Tis of an Antique
Structure, and the Chambers are very well fur∣nish'd.
The Governour's House is large, and
has the Advantage of a very pleasant Prospect.
The Episcopal Church of <HI>Nôtre-Dame</HI> is another
Piece of Architecture remarkable for its Antiqui∣ty.
But after all, 'tis certain that the principal
Glory of <HI>Grenoble</HI> consists not in its Buildings;
and they who wou'd have the pleasure to be ac∣quainted
with all its Beauty, must not expect
to gratifie their Curiosity by a Transient View
of it. For it has the Honour to be the Seat of
several Noble Families, who are so far above the
Clownishness that might be expected in so remote
a Province, that their Conversation and Deport∣ment
may be justly reckon'd the Standard of Ci∣vility
and good Breeding: So that a Stranger is
amaz'd to find the most refin'd Politeness of the
Court in the midst of those wild Mountains.
'Tis seated on the Banks of <HI>Issere,</HI> in a Valley, which
my Natural aversion to all Hilly Countries will not
<PB N="48" REF="41"/>
suffer me to call Pleasant. Yet at my departure
from the City, I saw some places that must be
acknowledged to have a kind of dismal Beauty,
especially the Monastery of the <HI>Carthusians.</HI> The
very Ascent to it is a Journey of six Hours, thro'
Ways that are almost only passable for Mules,
which are very common and extremely fine in
this Country: At least I can assure you, that
those who live in it may for ever despair of see∣ing
any Coach or Waggon near their Habitation,
unless it be made upon the Place. These Moun∣tains,
that seem to have been appointed by Na∣ture
as a wild Retreat for Wolves and Boars, are
nevertheless inhabited by Humane Creatures, if I
may give that Name to Animals that seem to have
a nearer resemblance to Bears than Men. Their
Habit consists of so Course a Cloth, that they ne∣ver
wear above one Suit of Clothes during their
whole Life, tho' it shou'd last an hundred Years.
'Tis a certain reddish Stuff, of the thickness of two
Crown Pieces, and every Thread in it is at least
as big as Packthread. These miserable Wretches
are perfect Strangers to all manner of Pleasure:
Their main or only Happiness consists in filling
their Stomachs with a sort of Bread that none of
our Dogs wou'd taste; and even that is a Rarity
among 'em: They drink Water, and live Night
and Day in Huts of Straw in the midst of their
Oxen, Cows, and Hogs, which are their usual
Companions, and are utterly unacquainted with
the Transactions of the rest of Mankind.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible to approach the Monastery with∣out
feeling an over-bearing Melancholy that damps
the gayest Spirits: 'tis seated between two high and
rugged Mountains or rather perpendicular Rocks,
and the Ghastliness of the Prospect is heighten'd by
the Pine-Trees, that cast a dismal Shade upon the
jutting Cliffs. And to compleat the Horrour of
<PB N="49" REF="41"/>
the Place, the Ears are stunn'd with the amazing
Dinn of a Torrent that rolls impetuously thro' the
Bottom which separates the Mountains. The <HI>Monks</HI>
have spar'd no Pains to cut a Way thro' those na∣turally
impassable Precipices; and 'tis certain that
so laborious a Work cou'd not be perform'd without
a vast Expence of Treasure. However they cannot
be accus'd of throwing away their Money upon
useless Projects; for, if you except the trouble of
ascending and descending, a Man may walk pretty
easily to the Convent from the Bridges that are
built at the two Ends, and in the narrowest Places
at the Bottom, especially that next <HI>Grenoble,</HI> which
joins the opposite Mountains with a little Arch that
over-looks the Torrent, and is commanded by a
House at the End of the Bridge, which Ten Men
might defend against a Hundred thousand. Nor is the
Passage to the Convent less difficult on the other side,
so that it might be justly esteem'd a very considera∣ble
Post, if it were as important as 'tis strong: but
in my Opinion the Uselesness of the Conquest se∣cures
it as effectually against the Attacks of an Ene∣my,
as the Strength of its Situation. These Passages
end in a sort of Meadow or little Valley, contain∣ing
a hundred Paces in breadth, and a large quarter
of a League in length, where the Monastery is seat∣ed.
The <HI>Monks</HI> have made several successless At∣tempts
to cultivate and embellish their solitary
Abode; which are so many convincing Proofs of
the Badness of the Soil, that makes it incapable
of Improvement. However, they still continue to
encrease their Buildings, for they have the Advan∣tage
of Wood, Stones, and Iron upon the Spot, be∣sides
the Conveniency of Mills, that are turn'd by a
small Torrent which passes by the Convent, and
furnishes 'em plentifully with Water. I'm perswa∣ded
they cannot eat one half of their Yearly Re∣venue,
which amounts to 300000 Livres: tho' Gen∣tlemen
<PB N="50" REF="42"/>
of their Order are seldom guilty of pinch∣ing
their Bellies, and tho' they are at a vast Charge
in bringing every thing from <HI>Grenoble.</HI></P>
<P>Assoon as I arriv'd, the Father, who is appointed
to take Care of Strangers, brought me into the
Chamber call'd the <HI>Inn,</HI> or <HI>Place of Entertainment,</HI>
where they immediately kindl'd a great Fire, which
was a very seasonable piece of Hospitality, for I
was almost frozen with Cold. Not long after the
the Father-Prior came to make me a Compliment,
and left a Monk to keep me Company during my
Abode in that Place. The Earliness of my Arrival
gave me an Opportunity to visit the whole House,
after I had enjoy'd for some time the comfortable
Warmth of the Fire. In the first place, my Father-Companion
shew'd me the Church, which is long
and narrow for want of Room: the Walls are lin'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with Wood, as in all the other Apartments, by rea∣son
of the Moisture of the Place, that not only
spoils the Paintings and Ornaments, but occasion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
violent Distempers. Afterwards we visited the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the Chapter-General, which is wainscotted lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Church, and adorn'd with some Pictures; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
among the rest I took particular notice of a ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fine Piece, representing the Martyrdom of certai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Fathers of the Order in <HI>England.</HI> From thence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
went to the King's and Bishop's Apartments, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
they usually receive Persons of great Quality; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
others are generally entertain'd in the Room where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
was lodg'd: the Furniture of these Apartments is ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
without Magnificence. The Chapel of the Novice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
is, in my Opinion, the principal Ornament of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Monastery: for 'tis wholly built of Marble, ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
curiously wrought with <HI>Basso-relievo's,</HI> and excelle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Paintings; and besides the Altar is adorn'd with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Tabernacle of Amber, which is a valuable Piec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and was presented to 'em by a <HI>Polander.</HI> Since th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<PB N="51" REF="42"/>
impracticable in this place, instead of a Square
Cloyster, they were forc'd to build a Row
of Cells, above 300 Paces in length. After I had
taken a View of all the Apartments, my Guide
brought me back to my Chamber, where we supp'd
on Fish; for there is no Flesh eaten in the House;
after which he left me to repose.</P>
<P>Next Morning about Nine a-clock he return'd,
to conduct me to the Place where S. <HI>Bruno</HI> per∣form'd
his Penance, which is not accessible with∣out
great difficulty, being on the Top of the
Mountain, and so extremely Cold, that I cannot
imagine it was ever inhabited by Men. Never∣theless
these Fathers assur'd me, that 'twas the con∣stant
Habitation of that Saint, with his Six Com∣panions;
and shew'd me certain Caves or <HI>Grotto's</HI>
cut out of the Rock, where they spent their Days
in the Exercise of Religious Austerities. Since
that time the Monks erected a very fine Chapel,
enrich'd with several Pictures; among which that
of the Saint himself is particularly remarkable for
its finish'd Beauty. They forget not to make
Strangers take notice of their Rock, on which, if
you can believe their Tradition, an Angel appear'd
to him every Day, and brought him his necessary
Food. But it seems his Companions were not so
much in love with Mortification; for after his
Death they left the Hermitage, and de∣scended
half a League lower, to the place where
the Monastery is now seated, with the permission
of S <HI>Peter</HI> himself; who did 'em the favour to
appear in Person on that Occasion, and promis'd
'em the Virgin's Assistance, on condition they
shou'd rehearse her Office once every Day:</P>
<P>It must be acknowledg'd that these Fathers do
not content themselves with a bare verbal Renun∣ciation
of the <HI>World</HI> and of <HI>Themselves;</HI> for their
Practice is suitable to the Austerity of their Profes∣sion.
<PB N="52" REF="43"/>
The Solitude of their Recess is certainly
worthy of Admiration; they live in a perpetual
Confinement among those almost inaccessible Moun∣tains,
where they spend their Lives in Prayer,
Contemplation, and the Severities of Repentance;
and are so little acquainted with the rest of the
World, that they are ignorant even of the most
Remarkable Occurrences that are transacted in it.
They never eat Flesh, fast three quarters of the
Year, submit to the rigour of Monastical Discipline
twice every Week, wear Sackcloth, spend nine
Hours in the Church every Day, observe a perpe∣tual
Silence, and undergo voluntary and frequent
Acts of Mortification: So that if those Persons be
damn'd at last, I may venture to say that they
buy Hell at as dear a rate as the Saints purchase
Paradise. To make you less apt to suspect the
Truth of this Relation, 'twill be sufficient to tell
you, that the very sight of the place inspir'd me
with so resistless a Melancholy, that I spent the
whole Night in making serious Reflexions on the
Vanity of the World. But, after all, you must
not have so favourable an Opinion of the force of
this Religious Charm, as to imagine it sufficient to
imprint an indelible Character of Sanctity; for I
assure you, a little of the Air of the World soon
dissipated all my additional Devotion, and I be∣gan
to recover my wonted Gaiety by degrees, as
I approach'd <HI>Chambery.</HI> The Way thither is a re∣markable
Monument of the Grandeur and Mag∣nificence
of <HI>Charles Emmanuel,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> by
whose Orders it was cut out of the Rock, for the
Conveniency of his Trading-Subjects; as it appears
by an Inscription fasten'd to the Rock, and ac∣company'd
with the Arms of that Prince. The
Road for a considerable distance from the Mona∣stery,
is border'd with Precipices, and rugged Cliffs,
that cast forth an almost innumerable Multitude
<PB N="53" REF="43"/>
of impetuous Torrents, which roll along with a
horrid Dinn. But afterwards the Traveller has
time to recover his Senses, when at the end of
this frightful Passage, he meets with a pleasant
Road, that brings him insensibly to <HI>Chambery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chambery</HI> is the principal City of the Dutchy
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> seated among the Mountains on the lit∣tle
Rivers of <HI>Orbane</HI> and <HI>Esse.</HI> As for Spiritual Af∣fairs,
'tis under the Jurisdiction of the Bishop of
<HI>Grenoble;</HI> and for its Temporal Government, there
is a Senate, or Court of Justice, resembling a
<HI>French</HI> Parliament, which takes Cognizance of all
Civil and Criminal Suits; and its Authority is ex∣tended
over the whole Dutchy. This is all the
Account I can give you of <HI>Chambery;</HI> only I can
assure you 'tis neither large, strong, nor beautiful.
I took a Pass-Port of the President, and proceed∣ing
on my Journey, pass'd by <HI>Montmelian,</HI> about
two Leagues distant from <HI>Chambery,</HI> and seated on
the Top of a little Hill, that rises like a Sugar-Loaf
in the midst of a Valley: It may be reckon'd
almost impregnable; for it seems to be plac'd out
of the reach of all other Enemies but Famine,
and want of Provisions: But the Town, that is
seated below, is a Place of no Defence, and much
less considerable than a Thousand Villages in <HI>France.
S. John de Morienne,</HI> where I arriv'd the next Day,
deserves no better Character, tho' it be honour'd with
a Bishop's See. Here I took another Pass-Port of
the great Vicar, which I may reckon cheap, tho'
it cost me very dear; for it brought me safe to
this place, without being at the Charge of renew∣ing
it.</P>
<P>Two Days after I arriv'd at the Village of <HI>Lane∣burg,</HI>
seated directly at the Foot of Mount <HI>Cennis.</HI>
This remarkable Hill is famous both for its height,
in which respect it exceeds the tallest Mountains
of the <HI>Alps;</HI> and for a Bottomless Lake, situated in
<PB N="54" REF="44"/>
the middle of its Surface. I ascended a League
and a half before I arriv'd at the Lake; after
which I found a Plain; extending about a large
League; and in that an Inn, where I was accommo∣dated
with the most desirable Entertainment in
these Mountains, I mean the warmth of a good
Fire; for the Way is lin'd on both sides with vast
Hills of Snow; and the Wind is so cold and pier∣cing,
that the poor Traveller is hardly able to sup∣port
himself on his numm'd Limbs. After I had
rested an Hour, I mounted my Mule, for there
are no other Beasts of Carriage able to pass the
Mountain; and found the Descent on the other
side as troublesome and uneasie as the Ascent, which
I have already describ'd.</P>
<P>The same Evening I arriv'd at <HI>Suza,</HI> a little Ci∣ty
in the Frontiers of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> seated at the Foot
of a Mountain, and separated from <HI>Turin</HI> by a vast
and fertil Plain: It has the Advantage of a pure
and healthy Air, pleasant Meadows, good Wine,
and beautiful Houses. The warmth of the Cli∣mate
exceeds that of <HI>France,</HI> but the Heat is not
so intollerable as at <HI>Rome;</HI> so that the Traveller
finds as great an Alteration at his Descent from
the Mountains of <HI>Savoy,</HI> as if he were transported
in an Instant from <HI>Norway</HI> to <HI>Italy;</HI> and is agree∣ably
ravish'd at the sudden Change of a stormy
Winter into a Mild and Temperate Spring.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Turin</HI> is seated at the other end of
this charming Plain, between the <HI>Po</HI> and the <HI>Loire,</HI>
which furnish it abundantly with all the Necessa∣ries
and Conveniences of Life. 'Tis enclos'd with
strong Walls, and surrounded with broad, deep,
and well-lin'd Ditches. The Cittadel is a Master∣piece
of Fortification; for the Duke has spar'd no
Cost to make it Strong and Magnificent; and if
the Goodness of the Soil had been suitable to the
Care he has taken to improve it, I'm confident
<PB N="55" REF="44"/>
'twou'd have been absolutely impregnable. The
Town is all glorious within, and adorn'd with a
Thousand Beauties: The Publick Places are spa∣cious,
all newly built with an admirable Regulari∣ty:
The Streets are broad, and streight as a Line:
The noblest improvements of Architecture are mag∣nificently
display'd in the Palaces; the Gilding,
Paintings, and other Ornaments of the Churches are
suitable to the Beauty of the Buildings; the Shops
are full of all sorts of rich and fine Stuffs; and
the Academies for riding the Great Horse, Dan∣cing,
and Martial Exercises, deserve a particular
Observation. And to compleat the Glories of the
Place, there is a Court, that, notwithstanding its
smallness, may be justly reckon'd the Seat of Gal∣lantry
and Politeness; 'Tis compos'd of a Society
of both Sexes, that are equally Admirable; the
Ladies for their resistless Charms; and the Men
for a Nobleness of Mien, and Magnificence of Garb,
that seems peculiar to themselves.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have endeavour'd to give you in
few Words, a just <HI>Idea</HI> of this Charming City;
for it wou'd be an endless Labour to undertake
the particular Description of every fine Church,
and beautiful Palace, in a place where such Stru∣ctures
are no Rarities. All the Ornaments of this
City are Modern; at least I cou'd not, upon the
strictest Enquiry, discover any other Antiquities
than those in the Duke's Gallery, which is full
of all sorts of fine Paintings, rare Munuscripts,
Medals, Vases, and other Curiosities of that Na∣ture.
The Gate of the Palace is defended with
two Culverins, admirable for their Largeness and
Workmanship; and a Mortar of a prodigious big∣ness.
The Metropolitan Church is dedicated to
S. <HI>John,</HI> and exceeds all the rest in Magnificence:
'Tis a stately Dome, enrich'd on the Inside with
Paintings, of a finish'd Regularity and Fineness:
<PB N="56" REF="45"/>
And to all the other Ornaments, there was lately
added a Chapel of a surprizing Beauty and Rich∣ness.
This admirable Structure is of an excellent
Architecture, and seems in a manner to be over∣laid
with a glittering Cover of Gold and Silver:
'Twas built on purpose for the <HI>Holy Handkerchief,</HI>
which is kept there at present. You cannot ima∣gine
with what Devotion the People of this Place
adorn that Relick; which is a little Sheet, with
the Image of our Saviour painted very imperfect∣ly
in the middle, of a yellowish Colour. I need
not tell you that this is commonly pretended to be
the same Cloth in which Christ's Face was wrapt
at his Burial, and that his Image was miracu∣lously
stamp'd upon it: But there are so many
other Pretenders to the same Dignity, that I
will not undertake to decide so doubtful a Con∣troversie.</P>
<P>According to all Appearance, the Duke of <HI>Sa∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI>
will not remain long in the King's Interests;
for he has already given out Commissions for the
levying of two Regiments of Foot, and one of
Dragoons, with an express Order, not to receive
a <HI>Frenchman</HI> into 'em; and besides, 'tis certain
that he did not oppose the Passage of the <HI>Bar∣bets,</HI>
as he might have easily done: For all the
Motions of his Troops, were only in Order to
their Encampment at <HI>Verecil;</HI> and I'm persuaded
the only reason why he suffer'd the <HI>French</HI> to act
on that Occasion, was because he cou'd not hin∣der
'em.</P>
<P>I have met with another Obstacle, that will re∣tard
my Journey to <HI>Isaly</HI> for some time; for the
whole Country is full of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who Infest all
the Roads, and commit a Thousand Robberies.
The People here are daily alarm'd with fresh Ac∣counts
of these Disorders; so that I have been
at last prevail'd with to alter my Resolution, and
<PB N="57" REF="45"/>
am going to take Journey for <HI>Marseilles,</HI> where
I'm certainly inform'd I may find daily Oppor∣tunities
of embarking for <HI>Genoa</HI> or <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DUring my short stay at <HI>Turin</HI> after the Wri∣ing
of my last Letter, I had not the Op∣portunity
of making any remarkable Observation
that I had not taken notice of before; and there∣fore
all that I shall add to the Account I gave
you of that City, is, that the People have an
extraordinary Love to their Sovereign. You'll per∣haps
tell me, that this is not a very uncommon
Observation, since 'tis natural for all Men to re∣spect
their Governours: But I hope you'll acknow∣ledge,
that there are various Degrees in this kind
of Affection, as well as in all others; and that I
cannot be accus'd of Trifling, when I assure you,
that never was the Breast of any Subject fill'd
with a more ardent and respectful Love to his
Prince, than that which the Inhabitants of <HI>Pied∣mont</HI>
have for the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> Nor is their
Zeal for his Interest, and Affection to his Per∣son,
the Effect of a blind Inclination: For 'tis
no wonder that those who owe their Happiness
to the mild Influences of his Government are
charm'd with the Greatness of his Courage and
<PB N="58" REF="46"/>
Magnamity, and a Thousand other rare Perfecti∣ons,
of which he is certainly Master in a very emi∣nent
Degree.</P>
<P>The Dutchess is an illustrious Example of Con∣jugal
Affection: 'tis true, she is not unmindful of
the Blood that fills her Veins; nor will ever for∣get
that Natural Inclination to the place of her
Nativity, that obliges her to be the declar'd Pro∣tectress
of the <HI>French:</HI> But her Love to her Coun∣try
is not strong enough to lessen that which she
owes to her Lord, and puts not the least Byass on
her Mind when it comes in Competition with his
Interest.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you in my last, that it Rains
almost perpetually at <HI>Turin;</HI> and, (whatever you
may think on't) this is a very important Remark
for Persons of my Humour and Fortune. I can∣not
forbear complaining of the Unkindness of my
Destiny, that exposes me to be drench'd with e∣very
Shower for want of a Coach, and even en∣vying
the Happiness of those who are better pro∣vided;
for, if God had thought fit to intrust me
with the Management of 10000 Livres a Year, I
wou'd not have deny'd my self the Pleasure of Tra∣velling
in a portable House.</P>
<P>From <HI>Turin</HI> I came in seven Hours to <HI>Pignerol.</HI>
The Town is very well fortify'd; and the Citta∣del,
as now it stands, after so many Additions and
Alterations, may be justly reckon'd one of the
strongest places in his Majesty's Possession, and a
terrible Thorn in the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Foot, which
may one Day make him halt, if he do not take
care to pluck it out. Here the unfortunate Mon∣sieur
<HI>Fouquet</HI> spent the last part of his Life, and
(as 'tis generally believ'd) compos'd that admira∣ble
Treatise, entitul'd, <HI>The Counsels of Wisdom.</HI> If
that Report be true, even his Enemies must ac∣knowledge,
that the Confinement of his Body di∣sturb'd
<PB N="59" REF="46"/>
not the Freedom and Tranquillity of his
Mind, and that he was entirely disengag'd from
the Allurements of this World. Nevertheless, I'm
certainly inform'd by Persons of unsuspected Cre∣dit,
that he attempted to make his Escape by cut∣ting
the Sheets of his Bed; and that he was after∣wards
put under a Guard of four Centinels instead
of one, as well as the Count <HI>de Lausun,</HI> who about
four Years ago had little reason to flatter himself
with the hopes of a Release. The Marquess <HI>d'Her∣ville,</HI>
the present Governour of <HI>Pignerol,</HI> is a Man
of a large and comely Stature, brave, and well ac∣quainted
with the Duties of his Office.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Pignerol</HI> I proceeded on my Journey thro'
the long Valley of <HI>Sestriere</HI> to <HI>Guillestre,</HI> and from
thence by the Way of <HI>Briançon</HI> to <HI>Ambrun,</HI> a little
City on the Frontiers of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> inaccessible on
one side, by reason of the Steepness of the Rock on
which 'tis built, but only defended on the other
with a weak and single Wall. The Archbishoprick
of this Place is at present possess'd by <HI>Monsieur de
Genlis,</HI> Nephew to the Marquess <HI>de Genlis,</HI> Lieute∣nant-General
of his Majesty's Forces, and Captain-Lieutenant
of the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s Company of
<HI>Geudarms.</HI> This Prelate signaliz'd his Courage and
Zeal in the late Campaign against the <HI>Vaudois;</HI> for
he remain'd in the Camp all the Summer, and was
personally engag'd in the Battel of <HI>Salbertrand:</HI> And
this unusual Bravery in a Man of his Character, has
procur'd him so much Honour and Authority in the
Country, that when I produc'd his Pass-Port at
<HI>Gap,</HI> the Major, who commanded in the Place, told
me that if it had been sign'd by the King himself
it wou'd not have been so much respected. 'Tis true
he gave me a very favourable Character, for he was
not ignorant that I had the Honour to be very well
known to his Uncle: and 'twas also on that Score
<PB N="60" REF="47"/>
that he kept me two days at <HI>Ambrun,</HI> and entertain'd
me with a great deal of Kindness.</P>
<P>You must give me leave to detain you a while with
an Account of my fatiguing Passage over Mount <HI>Ge∣nevre:</HI>
for tho' it be neither so large nor so high as
<HI>Cenis,</HI> the crossing of that Mountain put me to more
Trouble and Pain than ever I suffer'd in any one
day of my Life. I was mounted on a Horse that
was not worth Six-pence, which I hir'd of a Pea∣sant
at <HI>Briançon,</HI> and accompany'd with a Guide
who was utterly unacquainted with the Roads, and
carry'd me quite out of the Way. But that was not
my greatest Misfortune, for my Horse stuck so fast
in the Snow, which reach'd above his Belly, that
I cou'd not make him go one Step farther, and was
at last forc'd to alight and endeavour to open a Pas∣sage
for him to the High-way; for I perceiv'd cer∣tain
Sticks at a considerable distance, which (I knew)
were set up as Marks to keep Travellers from wan∣dring
out of the Road. But I quickly found my
Design impracticable, for both I and my Horse were
so benumn'd with the Cold, that we cou'd hardly
stir a Leg; and besides the Wind drove the Snow
upon me faster than I cou'd rake it away: so that
I was beginning to give over my useless Labour,
and to reflect in good earnest on a Death that seem'd
unavoidable, when I discover'd certain black Spots,
that gave me some hope of finding a Village not far
the place where I thought to have ended my days.
Immediately I left my Guide, Horse and Baggage,
and, feeble as I was, ventur'd into the midst of the
Snow, in quest of those Houses, where at last, by
God's Assistance, I arriv'd, and was receiv'd with
all imaginable Marks of Kindness by those Hospi∣table
Wretches, who brought me into one of their
Hutts, which I found stuff'd with Oxen, Cows,
Sheep, Cats, Dogs, and (the most miserable Part
of the Family) Men and Women. Nevertheless
<PB N="61" REF="47"/>
I assure you that the Sight of this Place, which
perhaps at another time wou'd have turn'd my Sto∣mach,
seem'd more charming to me in that Ex∣tremity,
than the most glorious Palace that ever I be∣held:
I fansi'd my self restor'd from Death to Life
assoon as I enter'd that Resemblance of a Hog's Stie,
which was as hot as a Stove. In the mean time I
begg'd some of my kind Hosts to compleat their
Charity, by going to relieve the Poor Creature,
whom I had left with my Horse in the midst of the
Snow: and their Assistance came very seasonably,
for he had certainly perish'd if they had stay'd half a
quarter of an hour longer. After I had the Satisfacti∣on
of seeing him alive, I stretch'd my weary'd Body
on a Heap of Straw, where I enjoy'd the most com∣fortable
Night's Rest that ever I had in my Life.
The next day I feasted on a Piece of Bread exactly of
the Colour of Soot, and a little dry and salt Cheese;
and was in the mean time entertain'd with an Ac∣count
of their Way of Living in this Place. They
told me that they were imprison'd in their dismal
Habitations, and almost bury'd in the Snow for the
Space of seven Months, every Year; during which
time they linger out a miserable Life in the midst of
Stench and Nastiness.</P>
<P>After my Arrival at <HI>Gap,</HI> I sent back my Horse,
and hir'd another, which I found there by chance,
to <HI>Sisteron.</HI> But to compleat the Misfortunes of my
disastrous Journey, as I was crossing a very rapid
Torrent about a League from the last of these Pla∣ces,
having occasion to blow my Nose, I pull'd
my Handkerchief out of my Pocket, and with that
the Box with my Pass-Ports, which fell into the
Stream, and was in an instant carry'd quite out of
my Sight. If my Purse with all the Money I was
Master of, had been irrecoverably lost, I cou'd not
have been more sensibly vex'd: for when I consi∣der'd
with what Rigour I had been every where ex∣amin'd
<PB N="62" REF="48"/>
notwithstanding my Pass-Ports, I concluded
that Imprisonment was the mildest Treatment I
cou'd expect to receive at <HI>Sisteron.</HI> These Re∣flexions
kept me for some time in an Irresolution,
whether I shou'd go forwards; but since the Danger
was equal either Way, I resolv'd to proceed on my
Journey, tho' I shou'd be forc'd to take up my
Lodging in a Gaol. I found, to my Cost, the Ac∣complishment
of those Melancholick Presages; for
the Governour laugh'd at my Excuses, and told me
that I must needs have a very mean Opinion of his
Judgment, if I thought to put him off with such
an ill-contriv'd Story. <HI>Confess the Truth,</HI> added he,
<HI>you are one of the</HI> Barbets, <HI>and are going to</HI> Langue∣doc
<HI>and</HI> Dauphiné, <HI>to persuade the new Converts in
those Provinces to join with your Party:</HI> I answer'd,
That I was too Loyal a Subject to his Majesty, and
too zealous a Catholick to undertake such a Com∣mission;
that I was a meer Stranger to the <HI>Barbets;</HI>
that I came from <HI>Turin,</HI> and was going to <HI>Rome.
What, Sir,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>you came from</HI> Turin? <HI>Mor∣bleau,
you came with the</HI> Barbets: <HI>I'm better acquainted
with your Tricks than you imagine; I say you did come
with 'em, and I'll shew you presently some of your own
Friends, who will maintain it to your Face.</HI> Immedi∣ately
he order'd two of those unhappy Wretches
that were fall'n into his Hands, to be brought before
him, and assoon as they appear'd, <HI>Here is one of your
Officers,</HI> said he to 'em, <HI>whom we have caught strag∣gling.
He wou'd have us believe that he has deserted
your Party, and left you with a Design to submit to the
King; but we have Reason to suspect his Sincerity. Con∣fess
the Truth ingenuously, and declare all that you know
concerning him, as the only way you can take to obtain the
King's Mercy.</HI> If I had been guilty of entertaining
a Correspondence with these People, I wou'd have
immediately said something to undeceive 'em, and
prevent their biting the Hook: but since I was alto∣gether
<PB N="63" REF="48"/>
unacquainted with 'em, I was glad of that
Occasion to justifie my Innocency, and expected
their Answer with a Silence that confuted all my
Accusers: and besides, the Prisoners affirm'd that
they did not know me. Then the Governour be∣gan
to examine me more particularly, and with less
Prejudice than before: he ask'd me which way I
came, where I receiv'd Pass-Ports, and who had
any Knowledge of me. In answer to the last Que∣stion,
having nam'd several Persons, and among
the rest the Archbishop of <HI>Ambrun,</HI> the Governour
assur'd me, that I might conclude my self out of
Danger, if that Prelate wou'd undertake to answer
for me; and I reply'd, that I hop'd he wou'd not deny
me his Testimony. Then the Governour desir d me
to write to him, telling me that he wou'd accom∣pany
my Letter with another, and that in the mean
time I shou'd be confin'd to the Cittadel, where I
was lodg'd with two Lieutenants, from whom and
the rest of the Officers, I receiv'd all imaginable
Marks of. Civility. Four days after, the Governour
having receiv'd a very favourable Answer from the
Archbishop of <HI>Ambrun,</HI> sent for me, and told me
that I was at Liberty to depart when I pleas'd. I
return'd him my very humble Thanks for the Justice
he did me, and intreated him to grant me a Pass-Port,
since without that I shou'd certainly be stopp'd,
and perhaps also abus'd by the first <HI>Corps de Garde</HI> of
Peasants on the Road. But he assur'd me that there
was no need of a Pass-Port, and that all the Roads
were free, from <HI>Sisteron</HI> to <HI>Marseilles.</HI></P>
<P>Since I have had occasion to mention the <HI>Bar∣bets</HI>
so often, I believe it will not be an unwel∣come
Gratification of your Curiosity, to give you
an Account of the Original of that Name, which
the <HI>Piedmontois</HI> and <HI>Savoyards</HI> give to the <HI>Protestants</HI>
that inhabit their <HI>Valleys.</HI> The Word <HI>Barbe</HI> in
their Language signifies <HI>Uncle;</HI> and besides, an <HI>An∣cient</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="49"/>
and <HI>Venerable Person;</HI> so that in several Pla∣ces
'tis the usual Custom to express a more than or∣dinary
Respect to a Person by prefixing this Word
before his proper Name, as <HI>Barbe Peter, Barbe John,
&amp;c.</HI> And even by degrees it grew in such Esteem
among 'em, that they thought they cou'd not give
a more honourable Title to their Ministers, whom
for that Reason they call'd <HI>Barbe du Plessis, Barbe du
Menil, &amp;c.</HI> From hence the <HI>Protestants</HI> in this Coun∣try
were nick-nam'd <HI>Barbets,</HI> as in <HI>France</HI> they are
call'd <HI>Hugonots,</HI> and in <HI>Flanders, Gueux.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sisteron</HI> is seated on the <HI>Durance,</HI> and is so inconsi∣derable
a Town, that 'twou'd be an useless Waste of
Time and Paper to undertake the Description of it.
The Cittadel stands on a very steep Mountain, and
is consequently strong, but so small that 'tis scarce
capable of Lodging three hundred Soldiers.</P>
<P>The Marquess <HI>de Vallevoir,</HI> the present Governour
of this Place, is an old Officer, very well known,
and much esteem'd by the Soldiers. The double
Meaning of his Name had once almost cost him his
Life; for as he was walking at Night on the Ram∣parts
of a Town of which he was Governour, a
new Soldier who was then on the Watch, not know∣ing
him, saluted him with the usual Question on
such Occasions, <HI>Qui va là, Who comes there?</HI> to which
he answer'd, <HI>Vallevoir.</HI> But the Centinel imagining
he had said in a slighting manner, <HI>Va le voir, Go see,</HI>
and taking it either as an Affront, or as a Refusal to
discover his Name and Quality, discharg'd his Mus∣quet,
and shot him into the Belly so dangerously,
that he had almost dy'd of the Wound.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sisteron</HI> I came in a Day and a half to <HI>Aix,</HI>
which is but five Leagues distant from hence, and
was founded by <HI>Caius Sextius,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Consul, who
call'd it by his own Name, in Memory of the <HI>Hot
Baths</HI> he had built there, which are still to be seen
without the Walls. 'Tis neither large nor strong,
<PB N="65" REF="49"/>
but it may be justly said to be a very pleasant City,
for 'tis seated in a lovely Plain, that produces Store
of good Wine; and besides, 'tis adorn'd with a con∣siderable
Number of new Houses, which are very
fine, and built after the <HI>Italian</HI> Fashion. The Nobi∣lity
of <HI>Provence</HI> are, without dispute, the greatest
Lovers of <HI>Building</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and are at the greatest
Charge in gratifying their Inclinations to Archite∣cture;
and there are in this Country a great Number
of admirably well-contriv'd Structures that may pass
for little Palaces. The Metropolitan Church, call'd
<HI>S. Saviour's,</HI> is particularly remarkable for the Tombs
of four Counts of <HI>Provence,</HI> a small subterraneous
Chapel, where 'tis said S. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> ended her
Days, and especially the <HI>Baptismal Font</HI> of white
Marble, adorn'd with <HI>Reliefs</HI> that are much esteem'd
by the best Judges, and cover'd with a little Marble
Dome, supported with Columns of the same, ma∣king
all together a very valuable Piece. The <HI>Place
des Prêcheurs</HI> is the finest of all the spacious Courts or
Squares in the City, both for its Neatness and Large∣ness,
and for the Beauty of the Structures that sur∣round
it, among which the ancient <HI>Palace of Justice</HI>
deserves a particular Observation. In one of its A∣partments,
where the Counts of <HI>Provence</HI> kept their
Residence, there is a very fine Room, at present
call'd, <HI>The King's Chamber,</HI> richly gilt, and hung
round with the Pictures of our Kings. After the
Traveller has satisfy'd his Curiosity in this Place, he
may visit the <HI>Cours,</HI> or publick Walking-Place and
Rendezvous of Coaches, which is 800 Paces long,
and 15 broad, without reck'ning the pav'd Streets on
both Sides for the Coaches. 'Tis enclos'd with Bal∣listers
of Wood, and all over-shadow'd with tufty
Trees, whose spreading Boughs cast such an agree∣able
Coolness in the Heat of Summer, that one may
walk in this lovely Place without the least incom∣modity,
at Three a Clock in the Afternoon: and
<PB N="66" REF="50"/>
besides, at convenient Intervals, there are Benches
of Stone, where those who are weary may rest
themselves. The Houses that environ it are all ve∣ry
fine, and inhabited by Persons of Quality, who
chuse to live there for the Pleasure of the Prospect,
and the Conveniency of walking without losing
Sight of their Houses. This is the general Rendez∣vous
of the genteeler part of the Inhabitants of the
Town, who flock hither every Evening, and en∣crease
the Pleasures of the Place with their agreeable
Society and Conversation. You will be easily per∣suaded
to believe that there are some handsome Wo∣men
to be found among so much good Company:
but I'm afraid you'll stand in need of all your Faith
to give Credit to another Observation I made in this
City. 'Tis perhaps the peculiar Advantage of the Gen∣tlemen
of <HI>Aix,</HI> that they are possess'd of the dearest
and most distinguishing Privilege of the Beautiful
Sex; Ten or Twelve of 'em especially, who are
so many <HI>Adolphus's</HI> and <HI>Jucundus's,</HI> and out-vie the
most charming Ladies that ever were admir'd for the
delicate Mixture of Roses and Lilies in their Com∣plexion,
the Lustre of their Eyes, and the incom∣parable
Graces of their Mouth. These wondrous
Youths are so many convincing Proofs of the Rea∣sonableness
of the first Part of that common Saying
in this Country, which ascribes the <HI>Preeminence in
Beauty</HI> to the <HI>Men of Aix,</HI> and the <HI>Women of Mar∣seilles.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Country of <HI>Provence</HI> is under the Au∣thority
of the Parliament, which was establish'd
here by <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. <HI>Ann.</HI> 1501. The Archbishoprick
of this Place is remarkable for its Antiquity, and
the Extent of its Jurisdiction: for 'tis the Metropo∣litan
See of a very large Ecclesiastical Province, and
the first Bishop was S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> a Disciple of S. <HI>La∣zarus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="50"/>
Since the County of <HI>Provence</HI> was dismember'd
from the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, it has had the Misfortune
to change its Masters very often: but instead of pre∣senting
you with a Catalogue of all its Sovereigns,
I shall content my self with observing that it was
annex'd to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> under the Reig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. by <HI>René,</HI> Count of <HI>Provence,</HI> and King
of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily;</HI> and that the Privileges re∣serv'd
to the Inhabitants, by the Conditions of that
Donation, were involv'd in the same Fate with
those of <HI>Languedoc, Dauphiné, Burgundy, Bretaign,</HI> &amp;c.
For you know the King has a notable Faculty of
<HI>Judging in his own Cause,</HI> and is furnish'd on all Oc∣casions,
with <HI>irresistible Arguments</HI> to demonstrate,
That <HI>his Will and Pleasure are the only Limits of his
Royal Authority.</HI></P>
<P>The Air of this Province is so mild, that 'tis sel∣dom
or never observ'd to be subject to Frosts: but
the Advantages of its Climate are considerably les∣sen'd
by the Boisterousness of the Winds that reign
in it. And besides, the Country is generally so
mountainous, that one half of it is not cultivated;
and the little fertil Ground that remains, is so full
of Stones, that a Man wou'd be tempted to think
they had been purposely brought thither. The La∣bourers
take care to remove those that lie in their
way, and, instead of Hedges, surround their Fields
with Stone-Walls, which are almost every where
three Foot high: so that if ever this Country be
made the Seat of a War, 'twill not be an easie Task
to open a Passage thro' it for the Cavalry.</P>
<P>But, to make amends for the Inconveniency of
the Soil, which is neither proper for <HI>Corn</HI> nor <HI>Pastu∣rage,</HI>
it produces very good <HI>Wine,</HI> and great Store of
such excellent <HI>Olives,</HI> that the Oil of 'em is esteem'd
the best and sweetest in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Wine</HI> is of se∣veral
Sorts; for, besides the <HI>Red,</HI> which is most com∣mon,
and not inferiour to <HI>Burgundy,</HI> there is the <HI>Pale-Red,
<PB N="68" REF="51"/>
Red, White,</HI> and delicious <HI>Muscadin.</HI> The best grows
at <HI>Ciotat,</HI> a little Town between <HI>Marseilles</HI> and <HI>Tou∣lon;</HI>
but 'twou'd be needless to describe its Excellen∣cies
to you, who have tasted it so often at <HI>Paris.</HI>
There is also a mix'd Sort of Wine, call'd <HI>Malmsey,</HI>
much esteem'd by the People of this Country, who
make it, by boyling <HI>Red Muscadin</HI> with <HI>Cinnamon,
Cloves,</HI> and the best <HI>Aqua-Vitae.</HI> They have also
abundance of <HI>Ortolans,</HI> (which are delicate, and
very beautiful Birds, of the Bigness of a <HI>Lark</HI>) good
<HI>Quails, Red-legg'd Partridges,</HI> and some <HI>Francolins,</HI>
which are a Sort of the immediately preceding <HI>Spe∣cies</HI>
of Birds, for they have both the same Cry, and
Colour of Feathers; only the Wings of the latter
are spotted, <HI>black</HI> and <HI>white,</HI> their Legs are some∣what
<HI>smaller,</HI> and they are thought to exceed the
others very considerably in their <HI>Agreeableness</HI> to the
<HI>Taste.</HI> But all these Marks are not sufficient to distin∣guish
'em when they are dress'd, and therefore the
<HI>Cooks</HI> usually stick one of the Feathers of the Wings
into the Body of a <HI>Francolin,</HI> that it may not be ta∣ken
for a <HI>Red Partridge.</HI> 'Tis not so hard a Task to
know the delicious <HI>Earth-Apples</HI> or <HI>Swine-bread,</HI> that are
so cheap in this Country: for tho' they are brought
to the Table cover'd with a Napkin to keep 'em
warm, the whole Chamber is immediately perfum'd
with their odoriferous Scent. You must not ima∣gine
your self to be a competent Judge of this excel∣lent
subterraneous Fruit, because you commonly eat
'em dry'd in <HI>Ragou's</HI> at <HI>Paris:</HI> for they are incompara∣bly
more pleasant, when the fresh Pulp is eaten like an
Apple, without any other Preparation than peeling
off the Rind. 'Tis certain, that Maids have reason
to complain of the Tyrannical Custom that restrains
'em from tasting a Dish which all the World ad∣mires,
under Pretext that 'tis too powerful an Incen∣tive
to Amorous Inclinations.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="51"/>
This kind of <HI>Earth-Apple</HI> is neither a <HI>Plant, Herb,</HI>
nor <HI>Mushroom:</HI> it grows in a very little time, some∣times
equalling a Man's Fist in Bigness; and is al∣ways
found at the depth of half a Foot under the
Surface of the Ground. 'Twou'd be impossible to
discover these admirable Productions of the Earth,
without the Assistance of the Hogs, who smell 'em
out: The Country People follow these Animals,
especially when they perceive 'em busi'd in digging up
the Ground; and when they have gather'd so many,
that the Weight of 'em may amount to five or six
Pounds, they carry 'em to the Market, where they
sell 'em for 7 or 8 <HI>Sous</HI> a Pound. Next these you
cannot imagine any thing of a more delicious Taste
than the <HI>large Grapes</HI> of <HI>Provence,</HI> which the People
of the Country have the Secret to preserve till <HI>May,</HI>
as fresh as if they were newly pick'd from the Tree,
bringing Baskets full of 'em every Day to the Mar∣ket.
But this is not the only Reason why <HI>Provence</HI>
may boast of an <HI>Autumn</HI> in the midst of <HI>Winter;</HI>
for the <HI>Arbute-Trees</HI> are not only ever green, like
<HI>Bays,</HI> but continue to bear Fruit till <HI>Carnaval-time.</HI>
This Fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> resembles a very large Straw-berry; but
its Goodness is not answerable to its Beauty, for 'tis
full of small Seeds like Sand. These, with the ex∣cellent
<HI>Figs</HI> that are so common in this Country,
and some <HI>Peaches,</HI> are, I think, all the Kinds of
Fruit that are to be found in it. But I must
except the <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>Hieres,</HI> which may justly di∣spute
with <HI>Blois</HI> the Title of <HI>The Garden of France:</HI>
For <HI>Orange, Citron,</HI> and <HI>Pomegranate-Trees</HI> grow as
naturally there, and are brought up with as little
Care as <HI>Oaks</HI> and <HI>Chesnut-Trees</HI> in other Places.
These Advantages are owing to the peculiar Ad∣vantages
of its Situation; for it seems to ingross all
the Heat and fruitful Influences of the Sun, and to
be wholly exempted from all the Inconveniencies of
even the sharpest Winters.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>MArseilles</HI> is one of the most ancient Cities in
<HI>France;</HI> and tho it was famous in all Ages,
'tis not an easie Task to trace its Original, not∣withstanding
the Opinion of some Writers, who
pretend that 'twas founded by the <HI>Greek</HI> Exiles,
who were driven out of their Country by <HI>Cyrus
the Great.</HI> 'Twas formerly the seat of an Illustri∣ous
Assembly of learned Senators, and of an Ac∣cademy,
which was the general Rendezvous of
Studious Persons from all the Corners of the World.
These glorious Advantages made it in a manner
the <HI>Metropolis of the Commonwealth of Learning;</HI> and
inspir'd the <HI>Romans</HI> with so high an Esteem for it,
that they courted the <HI>Friendship</HI> of the Citizens of
<HI>Marseilles,</HI> while the rest of the Inhabitants of <HI>Pro∣vence</HI>
were their <HI>Conquer'd Vassals.</HI> After the Fall
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, 'twas govern'd as a Re∣publick
by four Counts; till at last the Inhabi∣tants,
finding themselves unable to withstand the
united force of their Neighbours, put themselves
under the Authority and Protection of the Kings
of <HI>France.</HI> But the Conditions of this Voluntary
Submission were very Honourable and Advantage∣ous
<PB N="71" REF="52"/>
for 'twas concluded, that the City and its
Territory, which comprehends two Leagues round,
shou'd be exempted from all manner of Taxes,
Charges, and Impositions; that the King shou'd
not pretend a Right to any Customs or Duties
for Goods Exported or Imported; That the City
shou'd be govern'd by Four Consuls, who shou'd
hold their Office for Life, and be elected by the
Citizens; only 'twas agreed, That one Judge or
Magistrate might be sent by the King, with the
Title of <HI>Viguier:</HI> That they shou'd not be oblig'd
to receive any Garrison, or be commanded by a∣ny
Cittadel but that of <HI>Nôtre-Dame de la Garde:</HI>
Besides several other Articles of the same Nature,
which remain'd in force till the King's Voyage
thither; when he took the occasion of a Mutiny that
was rais'd against the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> General of
his Galleys, to abolish all the Privileges of <HI>Mar∣seilles.</HI>
You may imagine with what Consterna∣tion
and inward Rage they heard of their Sove∣reign's
Approach in a Hostile manner, with an Ar∣my
at his Heels; and afterwards beheld him enter
the Breach as into a conquer'd City: However
they set a good Face on't, and resolving to make
the best they cou'd of a desperate Game, recei∣ved
the Destroyer of their Liberty with all ima∣ginable
Marks of Love and Respect. In the mean
time he order'd ten thousand Men to march into
the City, who seiz'd on the principal Posts, and
were lodg'd in the Citizen's Houses; and after∣wards
told 'em, that he had observ'd a great Number
of pretty Buildings in their Territory, and was
so well pleas'd with 'em, that he was resolv'd to
build one more. This Design was quickly put in
execution; for the Cittadel was erected at the
Mouth of the Port on the Right-side, and <HI>Fort
S. John</HI> on the other. The People of <HI>Marseilles</HI>
perceiving that <HI>Reason</HI> was too feeble a Defence
<PB N="72" REF="53"/>
against <HI>Violence,</HI> very tamely submitted to the new
Yoke that was impos'd upon 'em: And their
<HI>forc'd Complaisance</HI> on this Occasion, was made
the Subject of a Song; of which these are two
Stanza's:
<Q><LG>
<L>He told'em he wou'd build a Fort,</L>
<L>And swore 'twas meerly to protect 'em:</L>
<L>They swore again they thank'd him for't,</L>
<L>Because they durst not contradict him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They vow'd they were his loyal Slaves,</L>
<L>With Lives and Fortunes to assist him;</L>
<L>Ready to serve him to their Graves,</L>
<L>Because unable to resist him.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Whatever were the Sentiments of these unfor∣tunate
People at that time, I can assure you that
most of the old Inhabitants are struck with so
much Horrour at the remembrance of that. Dis∣aster,
that they never relate the Story of it with∣out
the deepest Marks of a lively Sorrow. And
they still retain such an inconceivable Abhorrence
against the <HI>French,</HI> that they scarce ever mention
'em but in the most reproachful Terms that Spite
or Disdain can invent. They look upon all those
of that Nation to be contemptible Wretches; and
you cannot do 'em a more provoking Injury than
to call 'em <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> I cannot give you a more
lively Representation of their implacable Hatred
against our Nation, than by relating a Story which
I heard t'other Day: When the King concluded
the last Peace with <HI>Algiers,</HI> Commissioners were
sent on board all the Galleys, and into the Baths,
to release all the <HI>French</HI> Slaves they cou'd find:
Some of these Officers perceiving a Man, whom
they took to be one of their own Nation, stand∣ing
in a careless manner, without showing the
<PB N="73" REF="53"/>
least desire to be Enroll'd in their List, ask'd him,
<HI>Whether he was a Frenchman: No,</HI> answer'd he:
<HI>What Countryman art thou then?</HI> said one of the Com∣missioners:
<HI>I'm a Native of Marseilles,</HI> reply'd the
Slave: <HI>Very well,</HI> said the Commssioners; <HI>write to
thy King of Marseilles, that he may set thee at liberty.</HI>
This is no contriv'd Story, but so certain and
well-attested a Truth, that I know some Persons
who were present when the Accident happen'd:
Nor will the credibleness of this Relation be que∣stion'd
by any who have had occasion to con∣verse
with the Inhabitants of this City, or to be
Witnesses of their extreme Aversion against our
Countrymen. If any of 'em gives his Daughter
in Marriage to a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> or makes a Man of
that Nation his particular Friend, he exposes him∣self
infallibly to the Hatred and Scorn of all his
Neighbours: And if a Maid shou'd receive a Vi∣sit
from a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> she might for ever despair
of finding a Husband in her own Country. To
conclude; The People of <HI>Marseilles</HI> are in all re∣spects
diametrically opposite to us; only I must
except from this general Rule, the Nobility of this
City, and of the Country in which 'tis seated,
than whom there are none of their Quality in
<HI>France</HI> that can lay a juster Claim to Antiquity
of Descent, and Politeness of Manners; nor any
that are better affected to his Majesty's Ser∣vice.</P>
<P>The Language of <HI>Provence</HI> is extremely harsh and
unpleasant, especially in <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and the Terri∣tory
that belongs to it, where the Pronunciation
is as Guttural as in <HI>Arabia.</HI> You can hardly ima∣gine
what a vast Alteration the very Sound or
Accent makes in a Language: There is scarce any
difference at all between the Words of the Dia∣lects
that are us'd in <HI>Provence</HI> and <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and
nevertheless this is as amorous and agreeable as
<PB N="74" REF="54"/>
that is rough and uncouth. A Stranger is never
more sensible of the Truth of this Observation,
than at his first Arrival: And I remember that
the very Day on which I came to this City, I
was astonish'd at the intolerable Clownishness
with which a handsome young Lady pronounc'd
these Words, to diswade one of her Kinsmen from
quarrelling with an ordinary Woman: <HI>Hai, mon
Cousin,</HI> said she, <HI>laché stata quelle femme, non sabais
pas qua cau à la teste dau Diable.</HI> This made me
tell a Gentleman, who, some Days after, ask'd my
Opinion of the Women of <HI>Marseilles,</HI> That <HI>I ad∣mir'd
their Beauty, but cou'd wish they were dumb,
because their Speech was such a Bugbear, that all the
Charms of their Countenance cou'd never retain a</HI> French
<HI>Lover. If you were acquainted with their Humour,</HI>
reply'd he, <HI>you wou'd be easily convinc'd, that the very
Reason you alledge wou'd make 'em in love with their
Pronounciation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Marseilles</HI> is one of the most populous Cities in
<HI>France;</HI> but the third part of those who reside in
it are Strangers. The old part of the Town is
neither very large nor fair: The Streets are nar∣row,
crooked, and uneven, by reason of its Situ∣ation
on a Hillock; but 'tis at least double of
what it was thirty Years ago. The <HI>Cours,</HI> or Pub∣lick
Place for taking the Air, is exactly in the
middle of a long and very streight Street, that
reaches from the Gate of <HI>Aix</HI> to that of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and separates the Old from the New Town. 'Tis
1000 Paces long, (which is only the third part
of the length of the Street) and in all other re∣spects
is like to that of <HI>Aix.</HI> Four Men are hir'd
by the City, to Water it twice a Day in Summer,
that the Dust may not offend the Gentlemen and
Citizens, who flock thither every Evening in such
Multitudes, that a Man can hardly turn himself
in the Croud. The Houses that Border it are
<PB N="75" REF="54"/>
built pretty regularly, but are not so fine as at
<HI>Aix.</HI></P>
<P>The New City is well built; the Streets are
broad, streight, and light; and besides, 'tis con∣siderable
for the Quality of its Inhabitants; for
all the Officers of the Galleys, the Gentry,
and the richer part of the Citizens chuse to live
in it. The Extent of the Walls of the City has
been considerably augmented within these three
Years; for besides what they contain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d before,
there is a large Space enclos'd behind the Arsenal
for a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lace of Arms,</HI> which (when finish'd) will be
300 Paces square. The King bestows the Ground
about this Place on those who will build Houses
on it, provided they observe the Lines mark'd
out for that purpose. By means of this new Ad∣dition,
the Abbey of S. <HI>Victor</HI> is advanc'd further
within the Town, being a Monastery of unre∣form'd
<HI>Benedictines,</HI> who acknowledge no other
Superiour but the Pope, in Ecclesiastical Cases.
There are 50000 Livres a Year annex'd to this
House, for the Maintenance of eighteen or twen∣ty
Monks, who know very well how to enjoy
all the comforts of so plentiful a Revenue. The
Neighbourhood of these Independent Gentlemen
is so great an Eye-sore to the Bishop of <HI>Marseilles,</HI>
that he has several times endeavour'd to make 'em
consent to the Re-union of their Monastery with
the Chapter of the Cathedral, offering 'em all
the Privileges of the Canons, with the Coadju∣torship
of the Bishoprick for their Prior: But
they have hitherto kept themselves from being
dazzl'd with the seeming Advantageousness of these
Proposals. The present Bishop is of the Family of
<HI>Vintimille,</HI> descended from the Counts of <HI>Marseilles,</HI>
and Nephew of Cardinal <HI>Fourbain Janson,</HI> his Prede∣cessor
in the Bishoprick. He is well-shap'd, hand∣some,
not above thirty Years old, has very much
<PB N="76" REF="55"/>
the Air of the Court, and might be reckon'd a
very handsome Man, if his Teeth were some∣what
smaller, and more evenly set. He is a Man
of Sence and good Breeding, of a pleasant Wit
and agreeable Conversation. He is none of those
morose Censurers, who affect a certain Surliness
and ill Humour on all Occasions. His Life is a
convincing Argument that the Pleasures of this
World are not altogether inconsistent with Devo∣tion.
He plays, hears Opera's, visits Ladies, and
if we may believe the common Report, is not
hated by 'em: Yet all these must be acknow∣ledg'd
to be innocent Liberties, since he always
preserves a due regard to the Laws of Decency,
and never seems to be guilty of any Criminal
Design. I know a Person who took the liberey
to desire the use of his Purple Habit and
Golden Cross, for a Masque: The Prelate reply'd,
That these Accoutrements were Sacred; but very
civilly accommodated him with his Cassock, short
Cloak, and Perriwig. He has a Niece who is
admitted into the Nunnery of S. <HI>Ursula,</HI> at <HI>Mar∣seilles,</HI>
and is certainly the most amiable Girl in
the World: His Affection to her is suitable to
her Merit; and since she is yet too young to bear
the Austerities of a Religious Life, he suffers her
to live with her Father, the Marquess <HI>de Fourbain:</HI>
In the mean time he visits her daily, and instructs
her in all the Duties of her Profession. Let us
leave 'em in this Holy Occupation, and take a
View of the <HI>Port</HI> of <HI>Marseilles.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis inclos'd within the City, which secures it
on all sides from the Violence of the Winds;
and its Mouth that before was not above thirty
Paces broad, is streighten'd by two Moles, lea∣ving
a very narrow Passage for the Galleys,
which is shut up with a Chain every Night,
and open'd at Seven in the Morning. The Har∣bour
<PB N="77" REF="55"/>
by the largest Computation is not above
twelve hundred Paces long, and three hundred
broad; and besides, 'tis so shallow that a Man of
War cannot enter into it. However 'tis the Sta∣tion
of all the King's Galleys, of which there
are forty five, including the old <HI>Patronne,</HI> which
at present serves only for a Show, and for an
Instance of the late prodigious Increase of the
<HI>French</HI> Grandeur. All the rest of the Galleys are
magnificently Painted and Gilt, especially the new
<HI>Patronne,</HI> which is adorn'd with the finest <HI>Basso-Relievo's</HI>
that are made in this Age: Besides the
Flags, Banners, Streamers, and Pendants, which
are all incredibly Rich. All these Ornaments are of
the best and finest red Dama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, with <HI>Flower-de-Lu∣ces,</HI>
Devices, and Coats of Arms embroider'd with
Gold: The principal Flag is above forty Foot
long, and ten broad; and all the rest are propor∣tionably
large: The <HI>Poop,</HI> where the General has
his Chamber, is cover'd with the same Stuff, en∣rich'd
with a Fringe of Gold and Silk.</P>
<P>All the other Galleys are adorn'd after the same
manner, only instead of Gold they have Yel∣lowish
Silk, which is no less agreeable to the Sight,
especially at a Distance. 'Tis impossible to be∣hold
a more stately Prospect than those Galleys
when they appear in all their Magnificence on
Sundays and Holydays. But notwithstanding all
these external Beauties, they are only splendid
Prisons to the most miserable Wretches in the
World; the poor Slaves are chain'd together, ea∣ten
up with Vermin and Scabs, beaten from Morn∣ing
to Night, and expos'd to all the Injuries of
Cold. Their only Habit is a sort of wide and
short Jacket, without Shooes or Stockings, without
a Shirt for Change, without Straw to lie upon,
without any other Food than a little Bread as black
as Soot; and to crown their Misery, without the
<PB N="78" REF="56"/>
least hope of a Deliverance from this deplorable
Captivity, more insupportable than that of the
<HI>Turks.</HI> There comes not a Person of Quality
to <HI>Marseilles</HI> whom the Intendant does not regale
with this sight on board the new <HI>Patronne,</HI> which
on these Occasions is embellish'd with all its Or∣naments.
The Galley-Slaves perform their Exer∣cise
by the Sound of a Fisquet: First they salute
the Intendant and those that are with him, bel∣lowing
out thrice <HI>Hou, hou, hou,</HI> as if they were
Bears in a Humane Form: In the next place they
stretch a Rope from one side of the Galley to
the other, and then a Sail-Yard; this done, they
set up the Tent and take it down again; after which
comes the most necessary part of their Exercise,
they pull off their Jackets and Shirts, shaking off
the Lice into the Sea, and sweeping 'em away
with their Hands: Then they put on their Clothes,
and the Haut-boys entertain their Company; who
at their Departure receive the same howling Sa∣lutation
as at first. I know not what Pleasure
some Persons may take in beholding so dismal a
Spectacle, but I assure you it had a quite con∣trary
Effect upon me: I was altogether unable to
resist the Motions of a most tender Compassion,
mixt with Horrour; and I'm persuaded you cou'd
not preserve the usual Tranquillity of your Mind
at the reading of a lively Recital of the Reflexi∣ons
I made on this Occasion: I shall therefore
leave this melancholy Subject, and proceed to en∣tertain
you with something more diverting.</P>
<P>These Galleys are Mann'd with a Regiment,
compos'd of as many Companies as there are Ves∣sels,
each Company consisting of one hundred and
twenty Men, who exceed all the Soldiers in the
King's Service, in Comeliness of Person, and Large∣ness
of Stature; for the Captains never grudge to
advance Ten <HI>Louis d' Or's</HI> when they meet with a
<PB N="79" REF="56"/>
Man that pleases 'em: And besides, there are two
considerable Encouragements that invite Men to
enter into this Service; for they have a <HI>Sous</HI> a
Day more than in the Land-Army; and the
Campaign, or time of Action, never lasts above
two Months. There is also a distinct Company,
call'd the <HI>Guards of the Standard,</HI> who are cloath'd in
Red, with a Gold Galoon, and train'd up to be
Ensigns of the Galleys: This Company consisted
formerly of fifty Men, but their Number was doubl'd
this Winter, and 'twas order'd that no Person
henceforth shou'd be admitted into it, without a
<HI>Brevet.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Maine</HI> is at present General of the
Galleys; but since that Office is purely Honorary,
all the Duties of it are executed by the Lieutenant-General,
the <HI>Chevalier de Noailles,</HI> Brother to the
Duke of that Name. This Officer is much envy'd,
if not hated, by some old Commanders of Squa∣drons,
who grumbl'd extremely to see him advanc'd
before 'em; yet since he is a very brave Man, and
possess'd of his Master's Favour, his Court is al∣ways
pretty numerous. Some days ago he visited
the <HI>Arsenal,</HI> and I took hold of that Occasion to sa∣tisfie
my Curiosity, which I cou'd hardly have done
at another time; for Monsieur <HI>de Montmor,</HI> the In∣tendant,
keeps the Keys of the most considerable
Places, and never parts with 'em out of his Custody,
but when there is something to be done that requires
the opening of the Doors. Tho' this <HI>Arsenal</HI> was
not begun to be built till about Thirty Years ago,
it may be divided into the <HI>Old</HI> and the <HI>New;</HI> since
the Additions that have been made within these four
Years, make it at least double of what it was before.
The Length of the <HI>Old Arsenal</HI> is equal to the
Breadth of the Port which it fronts; It contains
particular Magazines for all the Galleys, mark'd
with their respective Names, with large Round
<PB N="80" REF="57"/>
Doors. This is the Lower Story on one Side; the
other contains Magazines of Cannon, Bombs, Car∣casses,
and Gun-Powder, in which 'tis said there
are Two thousand Pieces of Cannon, and Five hun∣dred
Bombs. The Upper Story is divided into
Rooms, where the Flags, Pendants, Sails, and the
rest of the Tackling are kept; but most of 'em are
empty. Here is also a fair Hall of Arms, the Walls
of which are hung with Six thousand Musquets,
and as many Sabres, all kept in very good Order:
And near this is another, where there are Five hun∣dred
Sutes of Armour, all intire and bright as Silver.
The whole <HI>Arsenal</HI> is one single Mass of Building, in
the Middle of which there is a Dome with a Clock:
and tho' in the general it may be reckon'd a fine
Building, there is nothing in it that deserves to be
admir'd. The <HI>New Arsenal</HI> begins where the other
ends, and stretches along the Port almost to the Cit∣tadel:
'Tis larger than the <HI>Old Arsenal,</HI> tho' not so well
built, but when 'tis finish'd 'twill exceed the other, not
only in Vastness of Extent, but in the Beauty and Con∣veniency
of a fine Canal, thro' which the Galleys
may come to the Doors of their respective Maga∣zines.
'Tis also said that there will be Stoves built
there for the Galley-Slaves, to lessen the Miseries
they usually suffer in the Winter. This is the Place
where the Galleys are built, in a certain dry Ditch
or Dock, into which they can let as much Water
as they please, by a Sluce; so that the Galley is im∣mediately
set a-float, without the least Trouble in
Lanching it. The Place of Arms, of which I took
notice before, will be behind the <HI>Arsenal.</HI></P>
<P>There is not one fine Church in <HI>Marseilles,</HI> but
there are some very ancient. That of <HI>Nôtre-Dame
des Accoules</HI> was formerly consecrated to <HI>Pallas,</HI> that
of <HI>S. Saviour</HI> to <HI>Apollo,</HI> and the Cathedral or Church
<HI>de la Major,</HI> is said to have been a Temple of <HI>Di∣ana.</HI>
In the last the Body of S. <HI>Lazarus,</HI> the first
<PB N="81" REF="57"/>
Bishop of this City, is kept in a Silver Shrine; and
there are several other Holy Rarities both in this
and S. <HI>Victor's</HI> Church; where, besides the Head of
that Saint, they preserve the True Cross of S. <HI>An∣drew,</HI>
which is seven Foot long, and consists of two
Joists join'd cross-ways, after the Figure of an X.
Here is also a <HI>Grotto,</HI> where <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> did Pe∣nance
for some time. The whole City is full of
such Places, but none of 'em is so much respected
as S. <HI>Baume,</HI> where 'tis said she liv'd 33 Years. Not∣withstanding
all the Difficulties and discouraging
Rubbs I met with in my Passage thro' the Moun∣tains,
my Curiosity was still strong enough to ob∣lige
me to undertake a Pilgrimage to that Place;
and in my next you may expect an Account of the
Observations I made there.</P>

<P>S. <HI>Baume</HI> is a Cave in the midst of a Rock, which
is so extremely high and steep, that by taking a
distant View of this Place, you wou'd think it im∣possible
to ascend to it. And certainly the Ascent
was very difficult at first, since at present, tho' there
are Steps very industriously cut out of the Rock, it
requires a Man's whole Skill and Agility to mount
these artificial Stairs, holding his Horse by the Bri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le;
and the Pleasure of arriving at the Top of 'em
<PB N="82" REF="58"/>
is very considerably increas'd by the need one has of
Rest. This Rock is the Top of the highest Moun∣tain
of <HI>Provence,</HI> between <HI>Marseilles</HI> and <HI>Toulon;</HI>
and you must ascend continually for the space of
two Hours, before you can arrive at the Rock:
The Cave is possess'd by certain <HI>Jacobin</HI> Friars,
sent thither by the Prior of S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> who al∣lows
each of 'em a Thousand Livres a Year for
their Maintenance, without reckoning their Masses:
And I'm confident they cannot spare much out
of so considerable a Revenue, since they are ob∣lig'd
to be at a vast and almost daily Charge for
the Carriage of such things as are necessary for
their Subsistence, the Situation of the Place not
permitting 'em to lay up great store of Provisi∣ons.
On the right side of the Entrance into the
Cave, they have taken Advantage of a piece of
the Rock that jutts out beyond the rest of it, to
contrive a little Convent, consisting of seventeen
Cells, and three double Chambers, which are ap∣pointed
for the King, the Bishop, and the Go∣vernour
of the Province, or at least are call'd by
their Names. On the other side of the Entry
there is an Inn, where we paid dear for
what we eat, besides the Chaplets and Medals
with which my Companions loaded themselves.
'Tis Morally impossible that ever any Person
cou'd have liv'd in this Cave as many Days as <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> according to the Tradition, liv'd Years
in it, by reason of the extreme Coldness and
Moistness of the place, occasion'd by the conti∣nual
dropping of Water from the impending Rock,
which falls in such abundance, that it fills a kind
of Well or Cistern below. The Monks pretend
that this perpetual dropping is a miraculous Em∣blem
of the Tears which that Saint shed in
this place; and that 'tis naturally impossible for
Water to spring out of so high a Rock. This is
<PB N="83" REF="58"/>
a Philosophical Question, which you may deter∣mine
at your leisure; for I'm resolv'd to say
nothing on this Subject that may prepossess your
Judgment.</P>
<P>In the bottom of the Cave there is a little
Rock, about three Foot high, which I vehement∣ly
suspect to be Artificial; for 'tis exactly con∣triv'd
like a Bed, with the resemblance of a Bol∣ster,
as if it had been made on purpose for that
use. 'Tis inclos'd with a great Iron Grate, which
the Monks open, that the Spectators may have a
full View of the Saint's Image of Marble, paint∣ed
and gilt: She is laid at her full length, her
Head leaning on her Right-hand, and in her o∣ther
holding the <HI>Pix,</HI> in which she kept consecra∣ted
Wafers or Hosts. This Image is much bigger
than the Life, being seven Foot long; and yet
they pretend that 'tis an exact imitation both of her
Face and Stature. 'Tis strange that the Scripture
shou'd neither mention her unusual Bigness, her
Quality, (for they say she was a Princess) nor
her Voyage: And 'tis still more surprizing, that a
Woman of her Stature cou'd charm such a Croud
of Lovers: I know not whether the Men of her
Age had a particular Inclination to Court <HI>Gian∣tesses;</HI>
but I question very much whether such a
<HI>Bouncing Girl</HI> wou'd find so many Admirers a∣mong
us.</P>
<P>After a Traveller has satisfy'd his Curiosity with
a View of all these Rarities, it is the usual Cu∣stom
to go up to the Top of the Rock, call'd
S. <HI>Pilon,</HI> whither that Saint was carried seven times
a Day by the Angels, that she might have the
Convenience of saying her Prayers at that Place.
I will not detain you with the particular Rela∣tion
of the rest of her Adventures: But since, per∣haps,
you may not be unwilling to know how,
and by what odd Accident she came to this Place,
<PB N="84" REF="59"/>
I shall give you a short Account of that part of
her History. After our Saviour's Ascension, there
arose a violent Persecution against his Disciples,
as you may see at length in the <HI>Acts of the Apo∣stles:</HI>
Among the rest, the Family of S. <HI>Lazarus</HI>
was involv'd in the common Calamity; but the
<HI>Jews,</HI> unwilling to make Persons of Quality suf∣fer
the utmost Severities that were usually inflict∣ed
on others, instead of putting 'em to Death,
plac'd <HI>Lazarus</HI> and his Sister, S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> and some
others, whose Names I do not remember, in a
Bark, without Oars, Rudder, or Sails, abandoning
'em to the Mercy of the Winds, which by the
Providence of God, brought 'em into the Port of
<HI>Marseilles,</HI> where they spent several Years in Preach∣ing
the Gospel: Their Memory is preserv'd to
this Day, by a great number of Chapels erected
in the places where 'tis pretended the <HI>He</HI> and <HI>She</HI>
Saints usually pronounc'd their Sermons; which
had such a prevailing Influence on their Hearers,
that the whole City was converted. After such
happy Success, S. <HI>Lazarus</HI> was made Bishop, and
<HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> went to do Penance in the horrid
Cave of S. <HI>Baume.</HI> Her Head, and one of her
Arms are kept at S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> amongst a great num∣ber
of fine Relicks: Her Head is enchas'd in a
kind of Bust of Gold, ending a little below her
Shoulders, and enrich'd with a great number of
very fine Jewels, among which there is an admi∣rable
Ruby, equalling a Man's Thumb both in
Length and Breadth: This Bust was presented by
<HI>Charles</HI> II. King of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> Count of <HI>Pro∣vence.</HI>
The whole Face of this Head is expos'd
to view, contrary to the Custom of other Places,
where the Shrine is only show'd, and the Specta∣tor
must imploy his Faith, if it be strong enough,
to discover the Relicks: But here one may di∣stinctly
perceive a Death's-Head of so vast a size,
<PB N="85" REF="59"/>
that if it be <HI>Mary Magdalen's,</HI> we cannot justly
refuse our Assent to the Tradition, that assures
us of the unusual Bulkiness of the rest of her Bo∣dy.
Our Guide made us observe a little dry
Scurf about the middle of her Forehead, some∣what
towards her Left Eye, and told us, that
this was the place where our Saviour put his Fin∣ger,
when, after his Resurrection,
he said to her,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John 20. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Touch me not,</HI> &amp;c. But
since I had never observ'd in the
Scripture, that Christ put his Finger on her Fore∣head,
when he spake these Words, I ask'd a Fa∣ther
where I might find that Passage: He told
me that it was a Holy Tradition of the Church,
which I was oblig'd to believe, under pain of
Heresie; adding, upon the Authority of the same
Tradition, That during the Forty Days which
Christ spent with his Disciples after
his Resurrection<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">This is a di∣rect Contradi∣ction to the last Chapter of S. <HI>Matthew's</HI> Go∣spel, where 'tis said of the two <HI>Maries,</HI> that as they were going from the Sepulchre, Jesus met 'em, and that they came and <HI>held him by the Feet,</HI> and worshipped him.</NOTE>, he never touch'd
any thing but this part of <HI>Mary Mag∣dalen's</HI>
Forehead, and S. <HI>Thomas's</HI> Hand,
both which remain entire to this Day.</P>
<P>This Head is preserv'd in a Subterraneous Cave,
clos'd with four Iron Doors; and we were told,
that the Bodies of S. <HI>Magdalen,</HI> S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> S. <HI>Mar∣cellus,</HI>
and S. <HI>Sidonius,</HI> were put into four Marble
Sepulchres, that are still to be seen in this Cave,
which was contriv'd on purpose for their Bury∣ing-place;
but that these Holy Bodies were after∣wards
more honourably lodg'd. In the same Cave,
or Subterraneous Chapel, they shew also a little
Glass Vial, containing certain small Flints that were
moistened with the Blood that our Saviour shed
upon the Cross; endeavouring to make the Spe∣ctatours
<PB N="86" REF="60"/>
believe that the Blood is still visible; but
whatever care I took to consider these Flints with
all imaginable Attention, I cou'd not perceive the
least Tincture of Blood. Coming up from hence,
we were desir'd to take Notice of a Shrine of
Porphyrie, which contains the rest of that Saint's
Bones, except one of her Arms, which is enchas'd
in Silver, and suitable in bigness to the Head: Her
Flaxen Hair is in another Reliquary: And there are
in the same place many other Rarities of this Na∣ture,
which 'twou'd be too tedious to enume∣rate.</P>
<P>The Church that belongs to this Convent, is
large, well lighted, and very much esteem'd for
its Architecture. The Inside is adorn'd with se∣veral
fine Marble Columns, especially the great
Altar, which was built by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. in perfor∣mance
of a Vow; and is reckon'd one of the
largest, and most magnificent Altars in <HI>France.</HI>
All the rest of the Church is cover'd with
Paintings, by the most celebrated Hands, which
are also the Effects of Vows: And every Altar is
enrich'd with all sorts of Vessels, Candlesticks,
Lamps, and other Ornaments of Gold and Silver,
in great abundance. This Church was built by
<HI>Charles,</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> who en∣dow'd
it with a very plentiful Revenue; and the
Foundation being since encreas'd by the Piety of
our Kings, there is a very honourable Maintenance
for Fifty Monks who live here.</P>
<P>I'm afraid the Holiness of the Place will scarce
make amends for my detaining you so long at
S. <HI>Baume;</HI> and therefore since a change of Enter∣tainment
is always very acceptable to a cloy'd Ap∣petite,
I hope you will have the less Reluctancy
to accompany me in a little Journey to <HI>Arles</HI>
and <HI>Nismes,</HI> where you might divert your self
with a View of those Admirable Antiquities, and
<PB N="87" REF="60"/>
Illustrious Monuments of the <HI>Roman</HI> Grandeur that
are to be seen in those places.</P>
<P><HI>Arles</HI> is a City of <HI>Provence,</HI> and was formerly
the Metropolis of a Kingdom of the same Name.
'Twas adorn'd by its old Masters, the <HI>Romans,</HI>
with Temples, Palaces, Amphitheatres, and other
magnificent Works, most of which were ruin'd in
the succeeding Revolutions. The Amphitheatre,
commonly call'd <HI>les Arrenes,</HI> has escap'd the Fate of
the rest, tho' not so well as that of <HI>Nîmes;</HI> for
'tis impossible to walk on the Top from one end
to the other; so that I cou'd not measure its
Length and Breadth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Town-House</HI> is very remarkable, both for its
Structure and Antiquities: Among the rest there
is a Marble Statue of <HI>Diana,</HI> which former∣ly
pronounc'd Oracles to those who came to
consult her in her Temple, which was seated in
the same place where the <HI>Town-House</HI> stands at pre∣sent,
as appears by the Foundations that are un∣der
the Clock-Tower. All the Walls of the City
are full of pieces of Statues, Cornices, and Co∣lumns,
which give the Spectatour a great <HI>Idea</HI> of
the Number and Beauty of its Ancient Orna∣ments.
Among its finest Antiquities, I may just∣ly
reckon that admirable Obelisk which some
Years ago was found entire in the Ground,
and was since erected to the Glory of <HI>Lewis the
Great,</HI> by the Care and Contrivance of the Gen∣tlemen
of the <HI>Royal Academy,</HI> with very beautiful
Inscriptions on the Pedestal, both in <HI>Latine</HI> and
<HI>French;</HI> and a <HI>Golden Sun</HI> on the Top, which you
know is the King's Emblem, and the Soul of his
Device. This Obelisk wants the usual Ornament
of Monuments of that Nature, and, at least in
this respect may be justly esteem'd a Rarity. But tho'
there are no Hieroglyphical Figures upon it, to
determine its Age, and discover its first Contri∣vers,
<PB N="88" REF="61"/>
'tis generally reputed a Work of the <HI>Egyp∣tians.</HI>
I know not whether the same Opinion
will prevail in After-Ages; for perhaps Posterity
viewing the Inscriptions that have been lately ad∣ded
to it, will do our Age the Honour to be∣lieve
that 'twas capable of Undertaking and Fi∣nishing
such Works; if they be not kept from
falling into that Errour, by the Consideration of
the <HI>Granite</HI> of which 'tis built.</P>
<P>This City is the Seat of an Archbishop, and
of an Academy of Ingenious Persons, under the
Name of the <HI>Royal Academy of Arles;</HI> to whom
the Publick must own it self oblig'd for many
Curious and Learned Treatises. 'Tis situated on
the <HI>Rhône,</HI> at the distance of seven Leagues from
its Mouth: But no Ship, nor great Bark, can
come up to the City, by reason of the Banks
of Sand with which that River is pester'd.</P>
<P>Having satisfy'd my Curiosity at <HI>Arles,</HI> I re∣solv'd
to visit <HI>Nismes,</HI> one of the most remarkable
Cities in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> for its Trade, Antiquity, and
I may also add, for its Largeness, tho' 'tis at pre∣sent
much less considerable in that respect than
when (if we may give credit to History) 'twas
founded by <HI>Marius,</HI> who chose this for the place
of his Residence, and built it in imitation of <HI>Rome,</HI>
observing an exact Equality in the Dimensions of
the New City, as well as in its Publick Places
and Buildings. But Time, that impartial Destroy∣er
of all things, has made so many Alterations
in both these Illustrious Cities, that at present
there is not the least Resemblance between 'em.</P>
<P>The principal Monument of Antiquity at <HI>Nis∣mes,</HI>
is its Amphitheatre, the largest and most en∣tire
Structure of that Nature that is at present to
be seen in any part of the World. I cannot
forbear complaining that Private Persons are suf∣fer'd
to fill it with Houses, which quite take away
<PB N="89" REF="61"/>
the Prospect of it, and consequently all its Beau∣ty;
whereas if it were still empty, as when 'twas
possess'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> all the Curious part of
the World wou'd come to admire the Magnifi∣cence
of its Structure. 'Tis of a perfectly round
or circular Figure, having only one Door, with
a Tower on each side of it: It contains 150 Pa∣ces
in Diameter, and its Circumference amounts
to 460. The Inside of the Circle is Pyramidal,
in form of Stairs, where the People sate to behold
the Fights of Beasts, and other Publick Sights;
and below there are very fair vaulted Galleries,
where the Spectatours might walk till the Shows
began. This lower Story is adorn'd with fine Co∣lumns,
with their Cornices; and from place to place
there are Heads of Animals, Eagles and Fasces in
<HI>Relief.</HI> The whole Amphitheatre is built of large
Free-Stones, some of which are three Foot square
on all sides; and particularly those on the Top
of the Building.</P>
<P>We went out at the Gate <HI>la Bouquerie,</HI> to see
the famous Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> where that Goddess
pronounc'd her Oracles. 'Tis an exact Square,
the length of each side amounting to Seventy Pa∣ces:
The Door is round, ten Foot broad, and
fifteen high. This is a very Massive Edifice, ac∣cording
to the ancient manner of Building, and
consists of Stones as large as those of the Amphi∣theatre;
so that it might serve for a Fort in Case
of Necessity, and even might hold out for some
time against Cannon.</P>
<P>Not far from thence there is another no less
remarkable Structure, call'd, <HI>la Tour Magne,</HI> which
we may reasonably conclude to have been
design'd for a <HI>Mausolaeum,</HI> and built in imitation,
tho' not after the Model, of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monu∣ments.
'Tis a high and solid Pyramidal Tower,
without any Vault or Concavity; and there are
<PB N="90" REF="62"/>
Steps made round it, by which one may ascend
to the Top, tho' not without Danger; for they
are extremely worn and broken in several places;
so that I chose rather to content my self with
viewing it from below, than to run the hazard
of going up. From thence I return'd to the
City, and went to see an old Palace, call'd, <HI>The
Square House,</HI> which at present is the Dwelling-House
of a Private Person. 'Tis much longer than
broad, built with great Free-Stones, and adorn'd
on the Outside with several fine Columns, with
their Bases and Cornices. Some think this House
was formerly the <HI>Praetorium,</HI> or Hall of Judgment;
but others are of opinion that 'twas the <HI>Capitol</HI>
of <HI>Nismes.</HI></P>
<P>This City is full of People of Quality and Breed∣ing;
and tho' there is so small a distance between it
and <HI>Provence,</HI> I can assure you, that their Customs
are not only different but opposite; and instead of
that Scorn and Contempt with which <HI>Frenchmen</HI> are
treated at <HI>Marseilles,</HI> here they are entertain'd with
all imaginable Civility, and with the highest Marks of
Love and Friendship. You wou'd hardly give Cre∣dit
to some Instances of this Nature which I cou'd
relate to you: The Ladies take pleasure to accost
a Stranger whom they find walking alone; Their
Conversation is accompany'd with all the Sprightli∣ness
and innocent Freedom that can be desir'd. For
tho' they have as tender a Regard to their Honour
as any of their Sex in <HI>France;</HI> their Vertue is not
barbarous and inhumane; and provided a Man have
an Inclination to Love, and be Master of a compe∣tent
Stock of Merit, join'd with some external Ac∣complishments,
he may venture to ingage with those
favourable Enemies with almost certain Hopes of
Success. I have heard a hundred Relations of such
amorous Adventures of Strangers, who taking Fire
at first sight, were afterwards bless'd with the Pos∣session
<PB N="91" REF="62"/>
of the Object of their Flames; and preser∣ving
their Love after Marriage, had never any Rea∣son
to repent of the Suddenness of their Choice.
For if I might depend upon the Character I have
receiv'd of the Ladies of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and 'tis almost
impossible for one who has convers'd with 'em to
doubt of the Truth of it; a Man cannot trust his
Heart in better Hands, nor make a more advantage∣ous
Resignation of his Liberty. They are naturally
Loving, Complaisant, and Constant even to Death;
and besides they are generally of a very pleasant
Humour, and all their Actions are accompany'd
with a certain Amorous Air that seems always to de∣mand
a Heart, and puts it out of the Owner's Pow∣er
to refuse it. 'Tis not without an extreme Dis∣pleasure
that I must content my self with relating
what I heard on this Occasion, and that I cannot
add my own Experience to the Testimony of others;
but I cannot pretend to the Happiness of those who
find Fortune ready to compliment 'em with a Mi∣stress
at their first Arrival: and since the main De∣sign
of my Travels wou'd not suffer me to stay long
in this Place, I saw my self depriv'd of a Pleasure of
which I had conceiv'd so agreeable an <HI>Idea,</HI> and
left with an extreme Reluctancy, that lovely Coun∣try,
where the Customs and Manner of Living are
so suitable to my Genius and Inclinations. But at
my Return to this Place I was somewhat comforted
by a late Instance of the Misfortunes of Love, and
my Grief was in some measure abated, when I re∣flected
on all the Troubles and Disasters that usually
attend a Passion from which we expect nothing but
the Enjoyment of undisturb'd Delight and Satis∣faction.</P>
<P>Two Young Pilgrims betwixt the Age of Twen∣ty
and Twenty two Years, pass'd thro' this City
about three Months ago, and like the rest of those
miserable Wanderers, who rove about the World
<PB N="92" REF="63"/>
under the Protection of a Pilgrim's Staff, were con∣strain'd
to take up their Lodging at the Hospital <HI>de
la Charité,</HI> where one of 'em, not longer able to
endure the Fatigues, Cold, Hunger, and perpetual
Want of every thing that is necessary for Life, sunk
at last under such an insupportable Load of Mise∣ry,
and fell into a Fever, accompany'd with so great
a Weakness, that the Surgeons began to despair
of his Recovery. His Companion seeing him in
this Condition, was so overwhelm'd with Sorrow,
that the very Servants of the Hospital, who were
wont to be unconcern'd Spectators of such Acci∣dents,
were touch'd with Compassion: He never
stirr'd from his sick Friend's Bed-side, gave him his
Broth, serv'd him with a wonderful Zeal and
Assiduity, and wou'd not suffer any other to come
near him. The sick Person, on the other side,
was not pleas'd with any thing but what came
from the Hands of his belov'd Companion, and
receiv'd his Services with all the Marks of Grati∣tude,
and of a most tender Affection. In the mean
time the Sickness of the one, and the Grief of the
other were daily and equally augmented: The dis∣consolate
Mourner embrac'd his dying Friend every
Moment, and bath'd his Face with Tears. At
last, on the Ninth Day, the Feaver was succeed∣ed
by a violent <HI>Crisis,</HI> and the sick Pilgrim, after
some Convulsions, fell into a Swoon, and was
thought to be dead. His Friend then losing all
Patience, gave himself up entirely to the Excess
of his Grief, and throwing himself upon the dear
Body, with the Transports of a Despair, that
melted the Hearts of all the Assistants, burst forth
into Lamentations, which discover'd his secret, and
made 'em know that the Person whom they hi∣therto
treated as a poor Pilgrim, was a young
Lady: <HI>Alas! my dear N...</HI> cry'd he, <HI>Thou art no
more! Thy fair Eyes are shut for ever! 'Tis done—
<PB N="93" REF="63"/>
Thou hast lost thy dear Life, and 'tis I who have robb'd
thee of it. Ah! my Love! my Soul!</HI> continu'd he,
<HI>thou hast paid dear for thy Love to me, who am the
wretched occasion of thy Death in thy most blooming Age.
Ah! fatal Love! cruel Parents! unfortunate, and too-loving
Daughter!</HI> These, and such-like Exclama∣tions
he utter'd with unconceivable Despair, for
the space of a quarter of an Hour; after which,
perceiving that she show'd some Signs of Life,
he sent immediately for a Physician, and throw∣ing
himself at his Feet, <HI>Sir,</HI> said he, <HI>I conjure you
by all that is dear to you in the World, refuse not your
Assistance to this young Maid: She is a Person of Quali∣ty,
and deserves your utmost Care for her Preservation:
Leave no Means unattempted; spare no Cost, Sir, I be∣seech
you, and be confident that you shall not lose your
Labour; you shall have whatever you please to demand;
take my promise, and you shall find me to be a Man of
Honour.</HI> The Physician being mov'd with Compas∣sion,
assur'd him that the sick Person shou'd not
Perish by his Neglect: And after he had admini∣ster'd
such Remedies as were most necessary in
her present Condition, he begg'd her Lover to
inform him who they were, and by what Acci∣dent
they fell into such deplorable Circumstances.
The young Man told him, that he was a Native
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and born a Gentleman, tho' with a
very small Fortune; That he fell in Love with
this young Lady, who was of a very Rich and
Honourable Family; That She requited his Love
with a Reciprocal Affection, notwithstanding the
Opposition made by her Father, and all the rest
of her Family, who designing to settle her Advan∣tageously
in the World, wou'd never be persuaded
to accept of so poor a Son-in-Law; That, never∣theless,
they kept a Correspendence for two Years,
giving and receiving all the Marks of an unex∣pressible
Tenderness, and confirming by mutual
<PB N="94" REF="64"/>
and repeated Oaths, their resolution to die, rather than
to be guilty of the least Infidelity; That her Father
having provided a considerable Match for her, wou'd
have forc'd her to comply with his Inclinations;
That She rejected the Proposal with great Con∣stancy,
and was very rigorously treated by her
Father on that Occasion; and, That when she
cou'd not resist any longer, they resolv'd to make
their Escape, chusing rather to live poorly and
miserably together, than to purchase the Enjoy∣ment
of a plentiful Fortune at the rate of being
for ever separated. In pursuance of that Design,
as he inform'd the Physician, he seiz'd on one of
her Father's Horses, and after she had disguis'd
her self in a Man's Habit, he brought her to <HI>Paris,</HI>
where their Money failing, they were forc'd to sell
their Horse; and that little Stock being also ex∣hausted,
they were reduc'd to the miserable Con∣dition
in which he found 'em: <HI>'Yet,</HI> added he,
<HI>we were firmly resolv'd to spend the Remainder of our
Lives like wretched Vagabonds, rather than to submit to
the Tyranny of our Relations, if this fatal Sickness had
not made me alter my Resolution. I cannot longer bear,</HI>
continu'd he, <HI>the sight of so dismal an Object: My
Constancy is overcome by her Sufferings; and if God
wou'd vouchsafe to restore her Health, I design to carry
her back to her Father; tho' considering the extreme
Violence of his Humour, I cannot expect a milder
Punishment than Death, for the Injury he pretends I
have done him.</HI></P>
<P>The Physician, who is a very Humane Per∣son,
was struck with Compassion at the Recital
of their Misfortunes, and promis'd to assist 'em not
only as a Physician, but as a Friend. Immedi∣ately
he order'd the young Lady to be taken out
of the nasty Couch where she lay, and to be car∣ry'd
to a convenient Chamber; where she was
laid in a good Bed, and carefully attended till
<PB N="95" REF="64"/>
her Recovery, which happen'd not long after.
In the mean time, he made their Condition known
to the Bishop, who, as I told you in my last, is
none of those morose Censurers, who exclaim
against the least Breach of the Rules of Decency;
and indeed, he was sensibly touch'd with the disast'rous
Condition of these sorrowful Lovers; and admi∣ring
the odd Effects of Love and Fortune, he look'd
upon 'em as Objects of Compassion, and assur'd
'em, that it shou'd not be his Fault, if their Suf∣ferings
were not crown'd with the Happiness they
deserv'd. They were soon sensible of the Sinceri∣ty
of his Kindness; for he joyn'd 'em together
in Marriage, Cloath'd 'em, and entertain'd 'em;
till having written to their Relations, and obtain'd
their pardon, he sent them back to their own
Country. To keep you from suspecting the Truth
of this Relation, 'twill be sufficient to acquaint
you, that 'tis not above Fifteen Days since that
admirable pair of Lovers departed from this Place.
I am so much in Love with the Bishop's Gene∣rosity
on this Occasion, and even I think my self
so extremely oblig'd to him for it, that I know
nothing so difficult, which I wou'd not undertake
for his Service: And I'm confident that a Man
who is capable of performing an Action of that
Nature, must infallibly be Master of all the <HI>Car∣dinal</HI>
Virtues.</P>
<P>And to convince you that he is no less remark∣able
for his Prudence, and the solidity of his Judg∣ment,
I shall add one Story more before I finish
my Letter.</P>
<P>About four or five Months ago, the Convent
of the Monks of S. <HI>Anthony</HI> in this City began to
be haunted with one of those Ill-natur'd Spirits,
who not contenting themselves with making a
frightful Noise, beat and knock down all that
come in their Way. The Monks who came out
<PB N="96" REF="65"/>
of their Chambers at Night, were the chief Sufferers
by these Disorders; for their troublesome Guest
watch'd 'em so narrowly, and was so exact in walk∣ing
his Rounds, that 'twas impossible to stir abroad
without falling into his Clutches; and he always
bestow'd so furious a Correction on those whom
he caught straggling, that they durst not venture
out of Doors from six a-clock at Night to six in
the Morning: And even those who had the Wit
to keep out of harms way, cou'd not escape alto∣gether
unmolested; for they were terrify'd with
the Clinking of Chains, and such other Noises
that are usually ascrib'd to returning Spirits. There
were several Chapters held on this Occasion, and
the Fathers still concluded that their deceas'd Prior's
Ghost was come either to impart some Matter of
Importance to 'em, or to ask some Questions,
and that there was none of 'em worthy to be
his Confident, or to be acquainted with the Rea∣son
why he gave 'em so many unwelcome Visits.
After some time spent in Deliberation, 'twas re∣solv'd
to say a great Number of Masses for his
Soul, and to keep as close as they cou'd for the
future, to avoid coming within the reach of his Fists.
In the mean time this wondrous Ghost was the com∣mon
Subject of the publick Talk, and of the Ser∣mons
of the Monks, who show'd the print of his
Hand on the Wall of the Refectory, and offer'd
a Reward of 100 Crowns to any Man that wou'd
undertake to lodge there, and speak to the Ghost,
that they might know what he wanted. This
was a very welcome piece of News to one <HI>Blan∣chet,</HI>
a Native of <HI>Paris,</HI> who had so much Cou∣rage,
and so little Money, that he might have
been easily persuaded to expose himself to far greater
Dangers for a less considerable Summ. Immediate∣ly
he went to the Fathers, and offer'd 'em his
Service, assuring 'em he would talk to the Spirit,

and endeavour to procure 'em Satisfaction. The
Monks embrac'd the Proposal, and the Bargain
was concluded: But the Bishop, hearing of so
gross an Abuse, sent for the Superiour, and ha∣ving
reproach'd him with Weakness and Super∣stition,
forbid him to suffer that Man to lodge
in the House, or to show the print of the Hnad
to any Person whatsoever; adding, That such a
Circumstance was very unsuitable to the Nature
of a Spirit, and that he ought rather to watch
himself, than to entrust the Management of an
Affair of that Nature to another. <HI>Blanchet,</HI> ac∣cording
to his Promise, came in the Evening,
arm'd <HI>Cap-a-pee;</HI> but instead of his expected Re∣ward,
he was dismiss'd with a Compliment.
Some Days after, my Curiosity prompted me to
desire a Sight of the Hand; but the Monks re∣fus'd
me that Favour, excusing themselves upon
the Bishop's Prohibition. I applauded his Wis∣dom,
and took the Liberty to tell 'em, That they
shou'd not suffer themselves to be frighted into
the belief of an Apparition, till they were con∣vinc'd
of the Truth of it by a strict Examination
of all the Circumstances; and that they ought not
to instill Superstition into the Minds of the Peo∣ple,
since they were naturally too much inclin'd
to it. The Monk to whom I addrest my Discourse,
was so offended at it, that I was almost afraid
he wou'd have pull'd out my Eyes: He wonder'd
what cou'd move me to offer him such Advice,
and ask'd whether I took him, and all his Illu∣strious
Brethren, for a Company of <HI>Enthusiasts.</HI>
My Freedom had irritated him so extremely, that
he was incapable of Reason, and therefore I left
him. But the Bishop's Conduct, and my Opini∣on,
were sufficiently justify'd by an Accident that
happen'd some Days after. A certain Captain of
a Galley coming one Night to Sup with another
<PB N="98" REF="68"/>
Captain, whose House is very near the Convent,
left his Chairmen below, who being surpriz'd with
a violent Shower, carry'd the Chair into the Court
of the Monastery, and plac'd it under a Portico;
where one of 'em sitting down in it, fell into so
deep a Sleep that he perceiv'd not when the
Gate was shut, and wak'd not till Midnight. His
unwillingness to disturb the Fathers at such an
unseasonable Hour, made him resolve to sit in his
Chair till next Morning: And an Hour after, he
saw a Person cover'd from Head to Foot with a
long Black Gown, who having open'd the Gate
of the Court with a Key, began to walk up and
down, and cough'd several times very softly. The
poor Chairman was at first struck with Terrour,
for he was one of those who believ'd the Story
of the Apparition; but being a Man of Resolu∣tion,
he took Courage, and observ'd the Motions
of the Spirit. Not long after one of the Monks
appear'd at a Window, and ask'd softly, <HI>Are you
there? Yes,</HI> said the Ghost, <HI>Throw down the Rope.
You have staid very long,</HI> reply'd the Father; and
crying <HI>'st,</HI> two or three times, let fall a Ladder of
Ropes, by the help of which, the Spirit got into
the Convent, and three Hours after came down
again, and went out. Next Morning the Chair∣man
divulg'd the Secret; and 'twas afterwards
discover'd that the pretended Ghost was a Whore,
whom one of the Monks brought into the Con∣vent
every Night, having invented that Disguise
to fright those who might see his Mistress: And
least any of his Companions shou'd come out of
their Cells, and disturb his Pleasures, he drag'd
Chains thro' the Dormitory, knock'd at the Doors,
and beat those whom he met so unmercifully,
that their Fears were much greater than their
Curiosity. This Accident has so extremely les∣sen'd
the Reputation of those Fathers, who be∣fore
<PB N="99" REF="68"/>
this Discovery were thought to live pret∣ty
regularly, that at present they dare not
show their Faces: And <HI>S. Anthony's Ghost</HI> is be∣come
a proverbial Expression, or softer Term for
a <HI>Whore.</HI></P>
<P>I shall conclude this Letter with telling you,
That there are so many Occasions of going to
<HI>Turkey</HI> to be met with in this place, that I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m ful∣ly
resolv'd to undertake a Voyage thither. I may
perhaps find some <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Vessels there,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter I have told you that we set sail from <HI>Mar∣seilles</HI>
on the 25<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> you must not
expect to hear more News of us till our Land∣ing;
for I cannot imagine what pleasure you
cou'd take in reading, that on such a Day the
<HI>South</HI> or <HI>East</HI> Winds were contrary to us, or that
we were forc'd to tack about to the <HI>North</HI> or
<HI>West.</HI> I'm so far from looking upon the Sea as my
Element, that I never found the least Inclination
to be acquainted with it. Besides, Sir, I must con∣fess
I'm naturally apt to judge of others by my
self; and therefore when I remember how often
I have skip'd over such Passages in the Relations
of Travellers, I cannot forbear concluding that
you wou'd be as little pleas'd with so dull an En∣tertainment.
Since then you will have the Ad∣vantage
of passing from one Port to another,
without feeling the Inconveniencies of bad Wea∣ther,
or being troubl'd with the Noisy Hurry of
the Mariners, I hope you will be the more easily
persuaded to stop a while with me at the Isles
of <HI>If,</HI> where we spent a whole Day at Anchor,
after we came out of the Port of <HI>Marseilles.</HI></P>
<P>The Isles of <HI>If</HI> are three small Islands about three
Miles distant from <HI>Marseilles,</HI> forming a very safe
Harbour against any sorts of Wind, which is de∣fended
by two strong Castles, where the King
keeps a Garrison. These Islands are of great Im∣portance
to secure the Trade of <HI>Marseilles;</HI> for
without the Advantage of their Neighbourhood,
that City wou'd be a kind of Prison, since
<PB N="101" REF="69"/>
'twou'd be impossible for any Vessels to go out
of the Port, without exposing themselves to the
Insults of their Enemies: And besides, the Storms
that are so frequent in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> wou'd
drive many Ships upon the Shoar, if they had not
the Conveniency of standing into this Harbour.
But notwithstanding the Advantageous Situation
of these Islands, and the great Importance of the
Harbour for the Security of Trade, they were
mortgag'd by one of our Kings to the Duke of
<HI>Florence,</HI> for six hundred thousand Crowns. Whilst
the Princes of that Family injoy'd the possession
of this Post, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> left no means unessay'd
to make himself Master of it; but they were ei∣ther
resolv'd to keep it in their own Power, or
afraid to incur the Anger of the <HI>French,</HI> since 'tis
certain that they rejected all the Proposals that
were made to 'em upon this Occasion. These
Islands were afterwards reunited to the Crown,
by the Marriage of <HI>Mary de Medicis</HI> with <HI>Henry</HI> the
<HI>Fourth.</HI> And the Success of that Negotiation was in
a great measure owing to the Marquiss <HI>de Pile,</HI>
who was then Governour of the Place; for he
made Duke <HI>Francis</HI> sensible, that 'twas better to
comply with the Desires of that Monarch, than
to engage himself in a War with so potent an
Enemy. In consideration of so acceptable a piece
of Service, the Marquiss was continu'd in his
former Post, and the Reversion of his Office was
bestow'd on his Son, who died there, leaving
two Sons, the elder of whom, who enjoys his Grand∣father's
Title, succeeded in the Government of
these Islands; and the younger, call'd the Count
<HI>de Forville,</HI> was made Governour <HI>Viguier</HI> of <HI>Mar∣seilles,</HI>
and Captain of one of the King's Galleys;
the yearly Revenue of these two Places amount∣ing
to 20000 Livres.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="70"/>
To make amends for the less favourable part
of the Character I gave you of the Natives of
<HI>Prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce,</HI> I shall take this Occasion to acquaint
you with some of their better Qualities: For I
love to do Justice to all Men; and besides, I
wou'd willingly make my Peace with the Inha∣bitants,
before I leave their Country: They are
very good Mariners, and are famous over all <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
for their Industry and Diligence: Nor are
they less remarkable for their Courage and Bra∣very;
for they are so little capable of Fear, that
they wou'd reckon it a piece of Cowardice to
turn their Backs to ten times their Number of
Enemies. Not very long ago, our Captain's Un∣cle,
call'd <HI>Blaise Marin,</HI> in a Ship of Forty Guns,
maintain'd a Fight for three Days together, during
a Calm, against five <HI>Tripolin</HI> Men of War, with so
much Resolution and Success, that they were forc'd
at last to leave him. And a small Bark of thir∣ty
Men, was about a Year ago snatch'd out of
the very Jaws of the <HI>Algerines,</HI> by the Prudence
and Bravery of the Pilot. She was chas'd by one
of the largest of the Enemy's Ships, in which
there were four hundred Men, till seeing no pos∣sibility
of escaping, that Handful of Men resolv'd
to board the Ship that pursu'd 'em, without
lowering their Sails, or grappling the Vessels to∣gether:
And the Pilot leaping on board the Ene∣my's
Ship, with his Curtelas in his Hand, cut
the Rope that sustain'd their Main-Sail, which
they cou'd not hoise again in above three Hours.
In the mean time the Pilot jump'd into his own
Bark, and Crying, <HI>Courage, my Boys, we're sav'd,</HI>
steer'd away from the Enemy, who could never
afterwards come up with him. The Merchants at his
Return, presented him with a Gold Medal; nor
cou'd they in Justice do less Honour to so rare
a Merit. But they will not be so kind to a Cap∣tain,
<PB N="103" REF="70"/>
call'd <HI>Curet,</HI> who had the Misfortune to be
taken by the Galleys of <HI>Naples</HI> about three Months
ago: For tho' he had only 24 Guns mounted,
and 100 Men on board, to resist seven Galleys
that attack'd him; his Countrymen exclaim a∣gainst
him as the basest of Cowards; and I know
not whether 'twill ever be safe for him to show
his Face at <HI>Marseilles.</HI> But after all, this seems to
be a Rodomontade, rather than an effect of true
Courage; since it must be acknowledg'd that se∣ven
Galleys are a very unequal Match for the
strongest Merchant-Ship in the World.</P>
<P>Three Days after our departure from <HI>If,</HI> we
arriv'd at <HI>Genoa,</HI> which you know is usually call'd
<HI>Genoa the Proud,</HI> tho' in my Opinion it cannot pre∣tend
the least Right to that Title: 'Tis the Ca∣pital
City of <HI>Liguria,</HI> and had its Name from <HI>Ja∣nus</HI>
the first, King of <HI>Italy;</HI> or according to o∣thers,
from <HI>double-fac'd Janus.</HI> Some make this
<HI>Janus</HI> King of the <HI>Toïans;</HI> and others deduce
the Etymology of the Word from <HI>Janua,</HI> a <HI>Gate,</HI>
or <HI>Door;</HI> because <HI>Genoa</HI> is as it were the Gate of
<HI>Italy.</HI> Authors are generally much divided con∣cerning
the true Name of this City: <HI>Luitprand,
Tircin,</HI> and some others, call it <HI>Janua; Titus Livi∣us,
Ptolomy,</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> give it the Name of <HI>Ge∣nua;</HI>
and the latter Opinion seems to be better
grounded than the former, especially since 'tis
confirm'd by a small Copper-Plate, which is to
be seen in this Place, and was found <HI>Ann.</HI> 1507.
by a Peasant, as he was Tilling the Ground. The
Inscription is engrav'd in very small, but pretty
distinct, <HI>Roman</HI> Characters; and in it the <HI>Genoese</HI>
are call'd <HI>Genuates.</HI></P>
<P>The time of its Foundation is unknown, at
least I never had the Fortune to meet with a
satisfactory Account of it in any Author, either
Ancient or Modern. 'Tis seated at the bottom
<PB N="104" REF="71"/>
of a little Gulf, on the Declivity, and at the Foot
of a Hill, seeming to consist of several Stories.
The Port lies very open towards the Sea, and
therefore cannot afford safe Anchorage for Ships.
The City contains five and thirty Parishes; the
Streets are uneven, and very narrow, tho' the
Houses are extremely high. In the middle of the
<HI>Publick Place,</HI> there is a Marble Statue of an unusual
bigness, representing <HI>Andrew Doria,</HI> the Deliverer of
the Republick, trampling on three <HI>Turks</HI> Heads,
in Memory of the signal Victories he obtain'd
over these Infidels. The Palaces of <HI>Genoa</HI> are ve∣ry
much admir'd; and it must be acknowledg'd
that some of 'em are very fine Structures; but
the principal Beauty of those few that deserve
that Title, consists in the <HI>Marble</HI> of which they
are built.</P>
<P><HI>Marble</HI> is no Rarity in this Country; all the
Churches are adorn'd with it, as well as the <HI>Pa∣lace
Royal,</HI> where his Serenity keeps his Residence:
But after all, you must not imagine that the
Streets are pav'd with it. Since we staid but
two Days in the City, I cou'd not find an Op∣portunity
to see the Inside of any of the Pala∣ces,
and therefore I cannot satisfie your Curiosi∣ty
with a Description of 'em. You are so well
acquainted with the nature of the Government,
that 'twou'd be needless to give you any farther
Account of it; only I cannot forbear taking no∣tice
of the extreme Decrease of the Power and
Grandeur of this Republick since those glorious
Days, when they extended their Conquests to
the <HI>Tanais,</HI> and made themselves Masters of all
the Coasts of <HI>Asia,</HI> and the Islands of <HI>Cyprus,
Scio, Lesbos,</HI> &amp;c. They still retain a little Island,
with the Title of a Kingdom, and are extremely
proud of it, tho', in my Opinion, without any
reason. The Habits of the Nobles resemble those
<PB N="105" REF="71"/>
of the Counsellors in <HI>France;</HI> they dare not wear
Gold or Silver when they come abroad; but in
their Houses they have very rich Vests, and cost∣ly
Night-Gowns.</P>
<P>Since the late Bombardment of the City, they
cannot endure those of our Nation. They show'd
me a Convent of Nuns, into which there fell
not one Bomb, tho' there were above a hun∣dred
shot at it; and told me, that there was a
Hand seen in the Air, which diverted their
Course, and threw 'em another way. The <HI>Jews,</HI>
who are detested by all the World, were in great
Favour here during those terrible Disorders, be∣cause
they found out a way to quench the Bombs
with Ox Hides: Yet this is not a new Inventi∣on;
for the same was practised long before by
the Inhabitants of <HI>Groningen,</HI> when they were be∣sieg'd
by the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> in 1672: And
since that time the <HI>Algerines</HI> made use of the same
Secret; besides the covering of their Streets with
Sand. Nor is there any thing wonderful in the
Success of this Stratagem; for one may easily and
infallibly smother a Bomb if he can come in
time to stop the Hole before the Fusee be spent.
At the Assault of the Horn-Work at <HI>Philipsburg,</HI>
I saw a Soldier take the same way to prevent
the Effect of the Granadoes, which the <HI>Germans</HI>
threw among us: For he gather'd 'em as they
fell, and stopping the Touch-Hole with his Hand,
either smother'd 'em immediately, or threw 'em
back upon the Enemies. But tho' this may be
easily done, it cannot be attempted without Dan∣ger;
for the Fusee is always made as short as
possible; and if the Fire shou'd happen to reach
the Powder when the Man throws himself upon
the Bomb, the shutting out of the Air wou'd on∣ly
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it burst the sooner.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="72"/>
But tho' the shortness of our stay at <HI>Genoa</HI>
wou'd not permit me to gratifie your Curiosity
with an Account of the Beauties and Rarities of
that City; I confess I cannot pretend the same
Excuse for declining to undertake the Description
of <HI>Rome, Florence,</HI> and the place where I am at
present. I have spent two whole Months in exa∣mining
and admiring that infinite Number of
Wonders that seem to have been brought from
all the parts of the World, and shut up in this
Country, as in a vast <HI>Repository.</HI> I have even
wallow'd in Delight, and been kept in a conti∣nual
Rapture with the amazing View of so many
noble <HI>Structures,</HI> august Monuments of <HI>Antiquity,</HI>
inestimable <HI>Libraries, Statues, Pictures,</HI> Works of
<HI>Marble</HI> and <HI>Porphyrie,</HI> and a Thousand other Cu∣riosities,
of which there is a prodigious and even
incredible Abundance in these places. I have seen
all these magnificent Rarities; I have view'd 'em
with all imaginable Pleasure and Attention, and
my Mind is still full of their agreeable <HI>Idea</HI>'s; but
tho' I have not forgot what I promis'd you, nei∣ther
the Consideration of your Satisfaction, nor
of my own Engagement, can make me willing
to keep my Promise with respect to <HI>Italy.</HI> You
must e'en give me leave to claim the Privilege
of a <HI>Norman</HI> once in my Life; and you will easi∣ly
dispense with the Account you expected from
me, if you peruse the Relations of so many <HI>Tra∣vellers,</HI>
who have visited this lovely Country from
one end to the other, especially the late Work of
Monsieur <HI>Misson:</HI> For what can be added to so
exact a Description? Is there any Corner in <HI>Italy,</HI>
that has escap'd his inquisitive Curiosity, or any
thing remarkable in it which he has not illu∣strated
with Learned and Judicious Reflexions?
He is a compleat Traveller; he has forgot nothing
that deserves to be taken notice of, and has so
<PB N="107" REF="72"/>
intirely exhausted his Subject, that there is no∣thing
left for future Observers. And therefore,
instead of describing <HI>Italy,</HI> I shall only desire you
to consult his Book, by the Assistance of which,
you may make one of the pleasantest Voyages in
the World without going out of your Closet.
But since you will perhaps expect that I shou'd
at least add something to convince you that I
have seen these celebrated Places, I shall adven∣ture
to tell you, that among so many admirable
Rarities that fill'd me with Wonder and Amaze∣ment,
there is nothing, in my Opinion, more ex∣traordinary
and surprising than the Pomp and Mag∣nificence
of the <HI>Court of Rome.</HI> I know not whe∣ther
this Remark will make amends for my Si∣lence
in other Respects: You'll perhaps tell me,
that 'tis a stale and trivial Observation: However,
you must give me leave to assure you, that 'tis
not an easie Task to represent all its Wonders;
and I must confess, that hitherto I had never any
<HI>Idea</HI> of it, that did not come short of the Truth.
The <HI>Court of Rome</HI> is no less Numerous and Magni∣ficent
than that of <HI>France;</HI> and perhaps I might
venture to say, that the <HI>latter</HI> is exceeded by the
<HI>former.</HI> Every <HI>Cardinal</HI> is a Prince, who receives
daily all the Marks of Honour and Respect from
a Thousand Prelates, and other Ecclesiasticks, that
look upon him as their Sovereign, and place their
whole Felicity in his Favour. Nothing is want∣ing
to compleat the Splendor of their Dignity:
Magnificent Palaces, rich Furnitures, delicious
Tables, Pleasure-Houses, Gardens, Grotto's, Foun∣tains,
numerous Trains of Servants, and, to crown
all, the Conversation and Society of the handsomest
Ladies in <HI>Europe;</HI> for you must not imagine that their
Character confines 'em to all the Austerities of a Mo∣nastick
Life; and, excepting only some <HI>Gray-Bearded
Dotards,</HI> that pretend to the <HI>Popedom,</HI> the
<PB N="108" REF="73"/>
rest are as Gay and Amorous as any young <HI>French</HI>
Prince. 'Twou'd be needless to apply this Cha∣racter
particularly to all the Members of the <HI>Sa∣cred
College;</HI> and therefore I shall content my self
with assuring you, that none deserves it more just∣ly
than the <HI>Cardinal Patron,</HI> who has acquir'd so
Universal a Reputation of an accomplish'd Gal∣lant,
that 'tis generally reckon'd the most effectual
way to obtain a Favour of him, to make use of
the Intercession of a <HI>Lady;</HI> and even he scruples
not to declare, that he has not the Force to re∣fuse
any thing to a <HI>fair Petitioner.</HI></P>
<P>Those who love <HI>Pleasure</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI> cannot de∣sire
a more favourable Treatment than they meet
with under the present Pontificate. The <HI>Holy Fa∣ther</HI>
encourages 'em by his own Example; his
Table and Furniture are Magnificent, and his
<HI>Nephews</HI> resemble so many Sovereigns. The Prince
<HI>Mark</HI> is attended with a Train of forty Lacqueys,
all clad in a Livery of Cloth of Gold, and his Stable
is furnish'd with sixty of the finest Horses in <HI>Rome;</HI>
tho' all this is a manifest Violation of the Edicts
that were publish'd to regulate the Affairs of the
<HI>Nepotism.</HI> 'Tis true, the People grumble extremely
to see their Substance exhausted, and the very
Blood drain'd out of their Bodies, to maintain
the extravagant Vanity of those <HI>Upstart Favourites,</HI>
who about a Year ago were as poor as them∣selves.
But among so many Marks of Splendour,
there is nothing more surprizing, than the Mag∣nificent
<HI>Gondola's,</HI> built by the Pope's Orders,
which are the first that ever grac'd the <HI>Tiber.</HI>
His Holiness goes thither very often to take the
Air, accompany'd with those that have the great∣est
Share in his Favour; and 'tis thought he de∣signs
to bring the <HI>Venetian Fresco</HI> into Fashion at
<HI>Rome,</HI> which in my Opinion is a Project that
may be easily accomplish'd, since the <HI>Roman</HI> Ladies
<PB N="109" REF="73"/>
love to be seen, as well as the rest of the Fair
Sex.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Luxury and Vanity of
the present Pope, gives occasion to several well-dispos'd
Persons, to make Comparisons between
his Conduct, and that of his Predecessour, which
you may reasonably conclude are not in the least
Advantageous to his Holiness: For there is cer∣tainly
a very remarkable Difference between these
two Pontiffs: He who at present fills the Chair,
makes it his only business to gratifie his Incli∣nation
to Pleasure, and to Aggrandize his Fami∣ly;
whereas the good Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> apply'd him∣self
only to the performance of the Duties of his
Office, reforming the Abuses that had crept into
<HI>Rome,</HI> visiting the Hospitals, and assisting the Poor.
And besides, he left no Means unessay'd, to re∣store
Peace to <HI>Christendom:</HI> And when an unjust
Power endeavour'd to extend its Usurpations to
the Church it self, we had the Pleasure to see
that generous Prelate oppose the incroaching Ty∣ranny,
with a Resolution and Piety worthy of
a Common Father. His Private Life, and Dome∣stick
Occupations, were no less Edifying: He
was easie of Access to all Men, and hearken'd
favourably to the Poor when they came to re∣present
their Grievances to him, or to beg his
Assistance. His external Deportment was very
simple, and so free from the least Appearance of
<HI>Worldly Pomp,</HI> that he might be call'd the <HI>Model of
Humility.</HI> I'm assur'd by several Persons of un∣question'd
Credit, that the Expence
of his Table was fix'd at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>One</HI> Shilling.</NOTE> <HI>Two Julio's</HI>
a Day, and that the whole Charge
of his Provisions did not exceed <HI>Fifty Crowns</HI> a
Year. I cannot without Astonishment reflect on
the admirable Sobriety of a Person who might
be justly rank'd among the most Potent Princes
<PB N="110" REF="74"/>
in the World; and am not at all surpriz'd that
most Persons here esteem him a Saint. 'Tis said
that <HI>Miracles</HI> are wrought at his Tomb; and if
that Report continue a while longer, he will cer∣tainly
be the only Object of the People's Devo∣tion.
I know not whether the Zeal of his Ado∣rers
may not one Day procure the deceas'd Pope
a place among the <HI>Canoniz'd Saints:</HI> But consi∣dering
the Reputation of his <HI>Successour,</HI> I may ven∣ture
to assure you, that he will never be enroll'd
among that Number.</P>
<P>Under this Pontificat the <HI>Curtezans</HI> have resum'd
their expiring Courage, and begin to appear with the
same Haughtiness and Insolency that seem'd to
be in some Measure curb'd under the Govern∣ment
of <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. That Jovial Society, which
may be reckon'd a <HI>Fourth Order</HI> in the State, and
no less considerable than any of the rest, will,
in all probability, maintain its Privileges and Li∣berties
as long as the Supreme Power is lodg'd in
the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who will never deprive themselves of
so necessary a <HI>Diversion.</HI> And truly, I know not
how so many young Persons that are engag'd in
a Vow which they are not able to perform,
cou'd subsist, without the comfortable Assistance
of those <HI>Communicative Ladies.</HI> Honest <HI>Matrons</HI> are
daily affronted by those domineering <HI>Strumpets,</HI>
whose Insolence they must suffer patiently, since
'twou'd be in vain to contend with the <HI>Mistresses
of their Masters.</HI> I'm not in the least surpriz'd at
their Haughtiness and Pride; but I confess I
cou'd never have believ'd, without the Testimo∣ny
of my own Eyes, that they had so much
Liberty, and so little Shame. We had no sooner
drop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Anchor before <HI>Leghorn,</HI> but we were im∣mediately
boarded by a Dozen of these <HI>Female
Pyrates,</HI> who, in spite of the Captain, carry'd off
an equal Number of Prizes; for Mariners look
<PB N="111" REF="74"/>
upon this Port as a priviledg'd Place, where
they may ramble without controul. 'Tis true,
they find Pleasure is not a cheap Commodity in
this place; for these Ladies are not so Hospitable
as to entertain Travellers <HI>Gratis,</HI> and they usually
set a very high price on their Favours, especially
at <HI>Rome,</HI> which may be call'd the <HI>Centre of Whores.</HI>
I will not pretend to warrant the Truth of their
Opinion, who say, That at <HI>Rome</HI> Whores may sue
a Man for their Hire: But I can assure you, that
they may and do demand the Assistance of the
<HI>Corte,</HI> or Watch, who have Orders to protect 'em,
and see 'em paid, according to the Quality of the
Person. The <HI>Corte</HI> is a Band of <HI>Sbirri's,</HI> who walk
the Rounds every Night, to prevent Disorders;
but their Authority is so small, and the care they
take to suppress Abuses so ineffectual, that I know
not whether the City receives any Benefit by 'em:
For since they are not permitted to Fire at any
Person, 'tis easie for any Man that has the Ad∣vantage
of a Nimble Pair of Heels, to avoid fal∣ling
into their Clutches; and there are some roar∣ing
Hectors, who not only make Head against
'em, but even keep 'em in Awe. I might reckon
up a Thousand Instances of such insolent Vil∣lanies;
but I shall content my self with mention∣ing
one that happen'd very lately: The City was
never plagu'd with a more desperate Villain than
a certain <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Lord, call'd, <HI>The Prince de la
Matrice,</HI> who was Ring-leader of Fifty <HI>Bandits</HI> that
were fit Companions for such a Master: He and
his Gang made all the <HI>Sbirri's</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI> quake,
and continu'd their Insolences above a Year, till
at last the Pope having issu'd out an Order to
take him alive or dead, he took Sanctuary in a
Church, where he Capitulated with his Holiness,
and was permitted to depart with Bag and Bag∣gage,
he and all his Companions. 'Tis certainly
<PB N="112" REF="75"/>
a very great Abuse, that Churches shou'd serve
as places of Retreat for Villains; and so long as
these Privileges remain, the abolishing of the <HI>Fran∣chises</HI>
will never put a Stop to the reigning Dis∣orders.
But, which is still more intolerable, the
Churches are not only so many <HI>Sanctuaries</HI> to se∣cure
Malefactors from Punishment, but the <HI>Theatres</HI>
where they act their Villanies. The other Day,
when the People were met to hear <HI>Vesper's</HI> at the
Church of S. <HI>Lewis,</HI> and were busie at their De∣votion,
Fifteen or Twenty Persons cry'd out on
a sudden, <HI>Fly, fly, the Church is falling;</HI> and imme∣diately
run towards the Door, with so many
signs of Fear, that the People were almost per∣suaded
that the Church was tumbling about their
Ears. And since on such Occasions 'tis natu∣ral
for a Man to think of saving himself, before
he consider the greatness or probability of the
Danger, the People in the Church follow'd those
whom they saw running out, with so much haste
and confusion, that several Persons were trodden
under Foot, and so hurt that they were forc'd to
keep their Beds. In the mean time the Rogues
were not idle Spectatours of the Fright they had
occasion'd; and some began to miss their Purses,
and others their Silver-hilted Swords, assoon as
the Tumult was appeas'd, and the Cheat dis∣cover'd.</P>
<P>During my abode at <HI>Rome,</HI> I had the fortune
to meet with the same <HI>Priest,</HI> who, as I told you
in one of my preceeding Letters, was imprison'd
at <HI>Mascon</HI> on suspicion of <HI>Witchcraft:</HI> He makes
his Court to Cardinal <HI>Chigi,</HI> whom he solicites ve∣ry
earnestly, and expects to obtain a Benefice from
him; but he is certainly an incorrigible Fool, as
you may perceive by the Account he gave me
of himself. He assur'd me, that he entertain'd a
most intimate Fellowship and Correspondence with
<PB N="113" REF="75"/>
certain imaginary Inhabitants of the <HI>Air,</HI> by
whose Assistance he pretends that one may easily
surmount all Difficulties, and wou'd have persua∣ded
me, that these Spirits open'd the Doors of
the Prison when he was in danger of being con∣demn'd
as a <HI>Sorcerer.</HI> I was so surpriz'd at the
Novelty and Oddness of his Opinion, that I re∣solv'd
to discourse seriously with him about it,
and ask'd him how he came acquainted with
that Airy People, and why they wou'd not dis∣cover
themselves to the rest of Mankind. He re∣ply'd,
that they communicated their Favours only
to those who are willing to hearken to 'em, and
to enter into a Society with 'em; adding, that
they have many Correspondents in the World
who live unknown, and conceal themselves with
all possible Care, to avoid the Fate of so many
Honest Persons, that have been burnt alive for
Witchcraft in several places of the Kingdom.
He deny'd positively that there were any <HI>Witches,</HI>
saying, That God was too Just and Good to give
so much Power to the Devil, who, according to
his Opinion, lies bound in Hell, from whence he
shall never be releas'd. But I soon perceiv'd that
there was as much Confusion in his Brain as in
his Discourse, and that he was a meer <HI>Fantastical
Enthusiast.</HI></P>
<P>I know not what Credit ye will give to this
Man's Relation concerning his imaginary Acquain∣tances
in the Air; but you may firmly believe
the Story with which I am going to conclude my
Letter, since I was an Eye-witness of all that
pass'd. A certain <HI>Florentine</HI> Soldier in this City,
without pretending to be invulnerable, undertook
for a Wager of a Crown to stand as a Mark
till four Bullets were successively shot at him,
and perform'd his Undertaking without receiving
the least hurt, tho' the Man who discharg'd the
<PB N="114" REF="76"/>
Gun stood but fifty Paces from him, and cou'd
neither be suspected of Collusion, nor want of
Skill, since all the four Bullets pierc'd the Door
against which the <HI>Florentin</HI> stood. You will doubt∣less
look upon this as a very odd and surprizing
Accident: I was so amaz'd at it, that I know
not whether I cou'd have believ'd it if I had not
seen it: Yet I can assure you, that the <HI>Florentin</HI>
is no Magician, and that his Secret only consists
in shifting his place assoon as he perceives the
flashing of the Powder: And the Account he
gave me of the easiness of his Undertaking, has
considerably lessen'd my Surprizal at the Success
of it: However, I wou'd not for 10000 Pistols
try the Experiment any otherwise than by shoot∣ing
a Bullet into the Sea. The Soldier found out
this way to give me some Satisfaction; and I
observ'd that the Bullet remain'd so long in the
Air, that a Man might easily have avoided it.</P>
<P>Our Captain having taken in all his Lading,
expects only a fair Wind; and by good fortune,
the third part of the Cargo belongs to <HI>Malta;</HI>
so that I shall have the pleasure of spending at
the least Fifteen Days in that celebrated Island.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THo' I promis'd in my last to excuse you
from sharing with us in the Inconveniencies
of the Sea, and to bring you from <HI>France</HI> to
<HI>Turkey,</HI> without meeting with one Storm; I can∣not
forbear giving you account of one that over∣took
us in the height of <HI>Sardinia.</HI> And I have
even the confidence to think that you will not
complain of my breach of Promise, since we had
all the <HI>Trouble,</HI> and you will only have the <HI>Plea∣sure;</HI>
if there be any truth in the common Ob∣servation,
That Men usually take delight in hear∣ing
a Relation of distant Misfortunes.</P>
<P>The pleasure of our Voyage was not disturb'd
for the first two Days, tho' we made no great
Progress; but on the Third, about seven in the
Morning, there arose on the sudden a most fu∣rious
<HI>North-East</HI> Wind, which burst our Sails as if
they had been made of Paper; and between the
Wind on one side, and the <HI>South-West</HI> Surges on
the other, our Ship was so violently toss'd, that
our Mariners durst not stir from the Sides of the
Ship, for fear of being wash'd off by the Waves.
Never was there any Object more capable of
striking Terrour into the Spectatour; never any
Noise more frightful and amazing than that
which was occasion'd by the tumbling of the
Casks and Boxes, the Wind, Thunder, and Sea,
the cracking of the Ship, and the howling of
some Women that were on board. A horrid
Gloom turn'd the Day into Night, and was suc∣ceeded
by a Flash of Lightning that cover'd our
<PB N="116" REF="77"/>
Ship for above a Minute, and was accompany'd
with a terrible and stupefying Crack. I know
not what we did in the mean time, nor was
there one among my Fellow-Passengers that cou'd
inform me what was done in that dreadful Mi∣nute:
For we were all so stunn'd, that there
were hardly any Signs of Life left in us. All
the Account I can give you is, that when we
recover'd our senses, we perceiv'd that the Light∣ning
had left a thick and black Smoak, accompa∣ny'd
with a sulphureous and noisom Stench, that
wou'd have kill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d us if it had lasted a quarter of
an Hour; but it was dissipated in a Moment.
We found also that we were remov'd from the
places where we were when the Lightning fell;
which Change, doubtless, proceeded from the vio∣lent
Motion and Agitation of the Ship. Among
the rest, one of the Ship-Boys who lay sculking
in the Fore-Castle, was thrown upon the Hatches
in the other end of the Ship, and so bruis'd, and
black with Contusions, (tho' I may say more
properly, that there was only one Contusion,
which cover'd his whole Body) that we have
still reason to doubt of his Recovery. The Ma∣riners
concluded that the <HI>Devil</HI> was the Author
of all these Disorders, and that there was some
Person in the Company under a Sentence of <HI>Ex∣communication:</HI>
For (you know) extraordinary Ac∣cidents
are usually esteem'd <HI>Miracles</HI> by the super∣stitious
Vulgar. 'Tis true, the throwing of
the Boy so far may at the first View seem to be
above the Power of Nature; but an attentive Con∣siderer
will not be much surpriz'd at this Effect
of the Tempest, since this is not the first time
that a <HI>Hurricane</HI> has snatch'd up Men, and even whole
Ships. This puts me in mind of a Story almost
of the same Nature, which I heard at <HI>Guernsey,</HI>
a little Island, subject to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="77"/>
It happen'd one Day, that during a violent Storm,
a Flash of Lightning set fire to the Powder in the
Castle, and blew it up, with the whole Garrison.
Only Ten or Twelve Persons escap'd, among whom
the Governour had the good fortune to be pre∣serv'd
in a very singular manner: They assur'd
me that he was carry'd thro' the Air in his Bed,
and laid down upon the Castle Wall, the Foot of
which is bath'd by the Sea; and that not know∣ing
how to get down, because the Wall was e∣qually
steep on both sides, he remain'd there till
the Weather began to grow calm, and then made
signs to the People of the Town, who came to
his Assistance.</P>
<P>This furious Tempest was succeeded by pretty
fair Weather, which we enjoy'd during the rest
of our Voyage to <HI>Malta,</HI> where we arriv'd six
Days after, and in nine Days from <HI>Leghorn;</HI> so that
we made above a hundred Miles a Day, for
the distance betwixt these two Places amounts to
about a Thousand Miles. We had no reason to
complain of the slowness of our Passage, tho 'we might
have perform'd the Voyage much sooner if the Wind
had been constantly favourable: For the Captain
assur'd me, that the <HI>Great Master</HI> of <HI>Malta,</HI> having
sent an express to <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> the Ship on
which the Messenger embark'd, met with so strong
an <HI>Easterly</HI> Wind, that she was carry'd nine hun∣dred
Miles in three Days, and arriv'd at the Port
of <HI>Marseilles,</HI> where finding another Ship ready to
set sail for <HI>Malta,</HI> he took Post for <HI>Aix,</HI> and ha∣ving
dispatch'd his Business, return'd the same
Night to <HI>Marseilles,</HI> where he embark'd in that Ves∣sel,
which immediately set sail with a most fa∣vourable
<HI>Westerly</HI> Gale, and in three Days arriv'd
at <HI>Malta:</HI> So that in Seven Days he perform'd a
Voyage of eighteen hundred Miles, travell'd ten
Leagues by Land, and dispatch'd his Affairs. I
<PB N="118" REF="78"/>
must confess few Travellers are so fortunate;
but that which happens <HI>rarely</HI> may happen <HI>some∣times.</HI></P>
<P>This Island was of old call'd <HI>Melita;</HI> and its pre∣sent
Name is an Abbreviation or Corruption of
the former: It lies in the thirty fourth Degree of
<HI>North</HI> Latitude, being seventy Miles in compass,
twenty five long, and ten broad. Under the Reign
of <HI>Augustus,</HI> and long before, 'twas govern'd by its
own Kings, from whom it was taken by the
<HI>Saracens,</HI> who afterwards lost it to the <HI>Christians.</HI>
In the Year 1530, <HI>Charles</HI> V. erected it into a So∣vereignty,
which he bestow'd on the Knights of
S. <HI>John,</HI> who eight Years before were driven out
of <HI>Rhodes</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and had till then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rov'd
as <HI>Pyrates</HI> upon the Sea. The Conditions of the
Donation were, That the Nomination of the Bi∣shop
shou'd belong to him; That the Knights
shou'd present him Yearly with a <HI>Falcon,</HI> as a
Mark of Homage; and that they shou'd not re∣ceive
into their Ports any Ships or Vessels at En∣mity
with the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> which they pun∣ctually
observe to this Day. But the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
has no reason to boast of this Custom as a pe∣culiar
Mark of Honour or Acknowledgment, since
his Ships meet with the same Treatment with those
of other Princes, and are never admitted into the
Harbours of this Island. I'm so loth to send you
an imperfect Account of this Place, that I can∣not
forbear taking notice of the famous Siege which
it suffer'd <HI>Ann.</HI> 1565. tho' I cannot reasonably sup∣pose
you to be ignorant of a Transaction that made
so great a Noise in the World. <HI>Sultan Solyman,</HI> re∣solving
to extirpate the whole Order, sent a for∣midable
Army against 'em, under the command
of <HI>Sinan Bassa,</HI> who possess'd himself of the Island,
burnt the Villages, made the Inhabitants Slaves,
and destroy'd the whole Country with Fire and
<PB N="119" REF="78"/>
Sword. But the Castle of S. <HI>Angelo</HI> put a Stop to
his Fury, and resisted all his Attacks, till upon the
News of the approach of the powerful Aids sent
by the <HI>Christian</HI> Princes, he was forc'd to make a
disorderly Retreat, leaving two great pieces of Can∣non,
one of which lies at the bottom of the Wa∣ter
in the Port; and the other under the Baraque
of <HI>Italy,</HI> commonly call d, <HI>The great Basilisk,</HI> and
carrying 120 pound Ball. The next Year the
<HI>Great Master, de la Valette,</HI> laid the Foundation of
the New City, and call'd it by his own Name.
I may venture to say, without an Hyperbole, that
this is the strongest City in the World: I never
saw so many, nor better contriv'd Works; and
besides, the Strength of the Place is very conside∣rably
augmented by the Advantages of its Situa∣tion;
for all the <HI>Half-Moons</HI> and <HI>Bastions</HI> are cut
out of the Rock, as well as the <HI>Counterscarp</HI> that de∣fends
'em; and the Ditches, which in some places
are sixty Foot deep, and proportionably broad.</P>
<P>The Castle of S. <HI>Angelo</HI> is in the Old City,
which is separated from the other by a double
Port, consisting of two Harbours, divided by a
Neck of Land, which have but one Mouth. At
the end of this <HI>Isthmus</HI> stands the Castle of S. <HI>Elm,</HI>
defending the Entry of both Ports, in one of
which the Ships that arrive are oblig'd to perform
their <HI>Quarantain,</HI> having the conveniency of a lit∣tle
Island, which serves as a <HI>Lazaretto</HI> for the Passen∣gers
and their Goods. On the other side is the great
Harbour, frequented by those who are permitted
to converse with the Inhabitants. Both these Har∣bours
are safe and convenient; but the Entry is
extremely dangerous, by reason of the Rocks that
lie hid under the Water.</P>
<P>The New City, call'd <HI>Valette,</HI> is seated partly
on the Top, and partly on the Declivity of a
rising Ground, descending to the Shoar. The
<PB N="120" REF="79"/>
Streets are streight, running in parallel Lines both
thro' the Length and Breadth of the City, and
are so contriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that the Ascent is only discerna∣ble
in four or five, the rest being exactly level.
The Houses are generally fair, built after the <HI>Itali∣an</HI>
Fashion, with Platforms on the Top; so that
the Sketch of the New City resembles perfectly a
<HI>Rectilinear Amphitheatre.</HI> The Old City is not so
beautiful, and is at present only inhabited by the
Common People; yet 'tis the Seat of the Bishop
and his Chapter, which may vie with any So∣ciety
of that Nature in <HI>Italy,</HI> being compos'd of
four and twenty Canons, who wear the Episco∣pal
Habit, and have each a Thousand Crowns a
Year.</P>
<P>There is but one publick Place or <HI>Square</HI> in the City
<HI>Valette,</HI> which is considerable for its Beauty, adorn'd
with a Fountain in the middle, the Water of
which falling into a Basket of Stone so artificially
cut, that it seems to be transparent, makes one of
the pleasantest Cascades in the World. The Front
of the Great Master's Palace makes one intire side
of the Square. There is nothing admirable either
in the Inside or Outside of this Structure; 'tis of
a Square Figure, and separated from the Neigh∣bouring
Buildings by four Streets. 'Tis divided into
the <HI>Winter</HI> and <HI>Summer</HI> Apartments: The first, which
is the most ancient and least beautiful, is painted
throughout with the Representations of Victories ob∣tain'd
over the <HI>Turks,</HI> and particularly the raising of
the Siege of <HI>Malta,</HI> accompany'd with Explanatory
Inscriptions. The <HI>Summer</HI> Apartment was built
by the late Great Master, <HI>Vignacourt,</HI> who beauti∣fy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<HI>Malta</HI> with so many Ornaments, and wou'd
have certainly made this a very Magnificent Pa∣lace,
if Death had not interrupted his Designs.
That which is chiefly remarkable in it is the <HI>Hall
of Arms,</HI> where there are 30000 Muskets, as many
<PB N="121" REF="79"/>
Bandaliers, 10000 Cuirasses and Helmets, with a
proportionable Number of Swords, Pikes, Pistols,
and Scimitars, all rank'd in the finest Order ima∣ginable.
There is an incredible number of cast Pieces
of Cannon in this City; for tho' I never reckon'd
'em my self, I'm assur'd by Persons of unquesti∣on'd
Credit, that there are 1060, and all of a con∣siderable
bigness.</P>
<P>The Churches of <HI>Malta</HI> are incomparably beau∣tiful,
the <HI>Italian</HI> Neatness reigns throughout, and
they are every where adorn'd with Painting and
Gilding. The principal Church is dedicated to
S. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> the Patron of the Order: The Pro∣spect
of it is not very pleasant; but to make a∣mends
for the Defects of the Outside, I never saw
any thing that cou'd with Justice be compar'd to
the Richness and Beauty of the Inside. 'Tis as
light as an open Field, and all its Ornaments ap∣pear
with so unclouded a Lustre, and so charm
the Eye of the Spectatour, that I believe never
any Man came out of it without Reluctancy.
'Tis pav'd throughout with large pieces of black
and white Marble: The Walls and Columns are
lin'd to the very Cornices, with curious Wain∣scotting,
which hardly obstructs the Sight; and
the <HI>Life of S. John</HI> is painted <HI>in Fresco,</HI> on the Vault,
by the Hand of the <HI>Chevalier Mathias.</HI> But the fi∣nest
Work of that Nature in the Church is the
<HI>beheading of the Holy Baptist,</HI> represented in a Cha∣pel
of the same Name, by the Hand of <HI>Michael
Angelo;</HI> this Picture was presented to the Order
by one of the Dukes of <HI>Florence,</HI> and may be rec∣kon'd
a very considerable Complement, since the
Princes of that Family are seldom wont to part
with such rare and beautiful Pieces.</P>
<P>The many and magnificent <HI>Epitaphs</HI> of the
<HI>Great Masters,</HI> and <HI>Grand Crosses,</HI> with their Scutche∣ons,
are none of the least remarkable Ornaments
<PB N="122" REF="80"/>
of this Church; and among the rest, the <HI>Great
Master Vignacourt</HI>'s <HI>Epitaph</HI> is extremely beauti∣ful.</P>
<P>Every one of the <HI>Seven Languages</HI> has a peculiar
Chapel in this Church, which they strive to adorn
in Emulation of one another. There is not a
Church in the World where Vessels of Gold and
Silver are more common than in this. Among o∣ther
curious Works, there are two <HI>Angels</HI> of the
last of these Metals, as big as the Life: But the
most finish'd Piece is a golden <HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Filagram</HI>-Work,
to receive the <HI>Holy Sacrament,</HI> of which the
Workmanship alone cost 2000 Crowns. The Trea∣sury
is so full of <HI>Relicks,</HI> that 'twou'd be an end∣less
Labour to describe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em; and therefore I shall
only tell you, that the finest Piece I saw in it is
the <HI>Bishop's Mitre,</HI> set all over with the richest
Jewels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Altar</HI> in the Nave is esteem'd one of
the most magnificent Works of that Nature in
<HI>Europe:</HI> It stands by it self, after the Modern Fa∣shion,
like that of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> which it exceeds both
in Largeness and Richness. I saw the <HI>Grand Prior</HI>
of the Order say Mass here in Ceremony, and
after the same manner as the Pope does at <HI>Rome.</HI>
His Habit is not different from that of a Bishop;
but he is serv'd by eight Deacons and Sub-Dea∣cons,
with a great deal of State and Ceremony.
The place where he sits while the Epistles and
Gospels are read, is on the Right-hand as you go to
the Altar, and directly opposite to the <HI>Great Ma∣ster,</HI>
who sits in an arm'd Chair on the Left∣hand,
unde a Canopy, two Pages standing be∣hind
to serve him. The <HI>Grand Crosses</HI> are seated
in the middle of the Nave, on a double Row of
Benches, with Rails or Backs, which enclose the
place. The <HI>Bailiffs</HI> and <HI>Commanders</HI> are plac'd on
the Seats behind; and the rest of the Knights sit
<PB N="123" REF="80"/>
either in the Chapels belonging to their Language,
or in any other part of the Church. To return
to their manner of Officiating; I observ'd two
Ceremonies I had never seen before, since they
are Marks of Respect that are only show'd to the
Pope: For there are two Clerks who fan the
Grand Prior's Head and Face all the while he says
Mass, with two large Fans of Ostridge Feathers;
and after he has done, he sits down in his Chair,
and the same Clerks coming in their Surplices,
undress him from Head to Foot, pulling off even
his Slippers. The <HI>Prior</HI> is one of the most consi∣derable
Officers of the Order, and is rank'd be∣fore
the <HI>Grand Crosses,</HI> and immediately after the
<HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Great Master,</HI> who only preceed him,
tho' he is not chosen out of the Classis of <HI>Noble
Knights.</HI> The present Possessour of this Dignity
is a Native of <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> and is a Person
of Merit, tho' of mean Birth.</P>
<P>Since I have insensibly enter'd upon this Sub∣ject,
I shall take this occasion to acquaint you
with the various Degrees and Dignities of these
Knights; but you must only expect a general
<HI>Idea</HI> of the Order, and I believe you desire no
more.</P>
<P>The usual Title of these Knights is of no older
date than their Settlement in this Island; for ac∣cording
to their Institution they ought to be call'd
<HI>Knights of S. John of Jerusalem.</HI> The Design of
the Foundation was for <HI>Hospitality,</HI> and for the
Relief and Assistance of the poor Pilgrims who
came from all the parts of the World to visit the
<HI>Holy Places.</HI> At first the Order was compos'd of
Persons of mean Rank or Quality, living under a
Superiour, call'd <HI>Gerard,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman</HI> by birth, who
had built a Hospital in the same Place where they
pretend <HI>Zacharias</HI> us'd to perform his Devotions,
and dedicated it to S. <HI>John Baptist.</HI> This <HI>Gerard,</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="81"/>
who may be reckon'd the Founder of the Order,
was a Man of a very Holy Life, and spent his
time in doing all the Offices of Hospitality, ac∣cording
to his Profession. 'Tis said, that he car∣ry'd
Bread every Night to the <HI>Christian</HI> Army,
when <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was besieg'd by <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillon;</HI>
and that being suspected, he was narrowly ob∣serv'd,
and at last surpriz'd in the very act. Im∣mediately
he was seiz'd, and carry'd before the
Governour, with a Burthen of Loaves, which
were miraculously chang'd into Stones when his
Accusers began to take 'em out of the Bag; so
that he was fully acquitted.</P>
<P>Sometime after, <HI>Godfrey</HI> having taken the Town,
was not unmindful of his Benefactour; he caress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
him, and wrote in his Favour to Pope <HI>Paschal</HI> II.
who confirm'd him and his Religious Company
in the Exercise of their Pious Occupations, by a
Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I granted for that purpose, and dated <HI>Octob.</HI> 19.
1113, ordaining that after <HI>Gerard's</HI> Death, the
Rectors shou'd be elected by the Members of the
Society. By Virtue of this Bull, they made choice
of one <HI>Roger</HI> for their second <HI>Rector,</HI> whom they
afterwards honour'd with the Title of <HI>Master:</HI>
'I was he who contriv'd and establish d the Sta∣tutes
of the Order, and made his Society take
up Arms against the <HI>Infidels:</HI> He order d em to
wear black Mantles of <HI>Camels Skin,</HI> in imitation of
S. <HI>John<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Habit in the <HI>Wilderness;</HI> to which he ad∣ded
a white Cross with eight Points, to denote the
<HI>Eight Beatitudes.</HI> This Habit is clos d at the Neck,
and has two Sleeves ending in a Point, which are
thrown backwards, that the Knights may more
conveniently serve and assist sick Persons. 'Tis
not much different from that with which <HI>Escula∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI>
is cloath'd, in Ancient Paintings. This In∣stitution
was confirm d by the Popes, <HI>Gelasius, Ca∣lixtus</HI>
II. and <HI>Honorius</HI> II. and afterwards, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1130.
<PB N="125" REF="81"/>
by <HI>Innocent</HI> II. who gave 'em for Arms, <HI>Gules, a
Cross Argent.</HI> Under Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> the <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beian</HI>
Knights were not only separated from the <HI>Nobles,</HI>
but almost excluded out of the Order, since they
were only suffer'd to remain in it in the Quality
of <HI>Chaplains</HI> or <HI>Servants.</HI> This is as properly a
<HI>Religious</HI> Order as that of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> or <HI>Au∣gustine
Friars;</HI> and when the <HI>Great Master</HI> writes
to any of the <HI>Knights,</HI> he directs his Letters thus;
<HI>For our Dear and Well-beloved, the Religious Brother</HI>
N... <HI>Knight of the Order of S. John.</HI> And they
are qualify d with the same Title in all Publick
Writings at <HI>Malta.</HI></P>
<P>On the Day of their Profession, they must bran∣dish
a Sword thrice, as it were to defie the Ene∣mies
of the Name of <HI>Christ:</HI> Afterwards they take
the Vows of <HI>Poverty, Chastity,</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI> In
performance of the <HI>First,</HI> they live in the Inns of
their respective Languages, enjoying all things in
Common, and the Order inherits their Estates:
The <HI>Second</HI> hinders 'em from Marrying; and the
<HI>Third</HI> obliges 'em to come to <HI>Malta</HI> as often as
their Appearance is requir'd by the <HI>Great Master,</HI>
and to obey all his Orders by Virtue of their Ho∣ly
Obedience. Thus they content themselves with
a seeming Performance of these Vows, but their
Practice is not in the least answerable to their
Profession: For, in the first place, their <HI>Poverty</HI>
wou'd satisfie my largest Desires, since most of 'em
receive considerable Pensions from their Relations,
besides Eighty Crowns a Year from their respective
Inns, which may be reckon'd a very comfortable
Maintenance. Nor are they more religious Ob∣servers
of their Second Vow; they are just as
<HI>Chast</HI> as my self, and I know not what they can
pretend to enjoy in Common but <HI>Women,</HI> whom
they have so well accustom'd to that way of li∣ving,
that a Faithful Wife is a very scarce Com∣modity
<PB N="126" REF="82"/>
in <HI>Malta.</HI> And as for the last Vow, if
<HI>Obedience</HI> consist in Grimaces, they are certainly the
most Obedient Gentlemen in the World; but if,
for Example, the <HI>Great Master</HI> shou'd take a Fancy
to recall the <HI>Chevalier de Noailles,</HI> I question very
much whether he wou'd obey the Summons. To
conclude, I cannot give you a juster Character
of 'em, than in their own Words; They are on∣ly
<HI>Poor</HI> when a Curtesan demands her Fees; <HI>Obe∣dient</HI>
at Table, where they are always invited to
Eat and Drink heartily; and <HI>Chast</HI> at Church,
which is their greatest Penance.</P>
<P>The Order is compos'd of <HI>four</HI> different <HI>Classes;</HI>
or rather there is only one, which tolerates the
rest out of Charity. The first is that of the <HI>No∣ble
Knights,</HI> who before their Admission must
prove their Nobility in the presence of certain
Commissioners, who are sent to examine their Pe∣digree
upon the Place. They wear a Cross of
Gold enamell'd, hanging at one of their Button-Holes,
as you have doubtless observ'd in <HI>France.</HI>
The Second is the Class of <HI>Priests,</HI> who for the
most part are not noble, yet wear a Cross, as the
first. The Third is that of the <HI>Serving Knights,</HI>
who are not Noble, and only wear a Cross of
white Sattin sow'd upon their <HI>Iustaucor,</HI> and of a
different Figure from that of the <HI>Nobles.</HI> The
Fourth and last is compos'd of the <HI>Great Master's
Menial Servants,</HI> or of some <HI>indigent Persons,</HI> to
whom he grants that Favour, which brings 'em
no other Advantage than the usual Salary of
fourscore Crowns; and their Cross is like that
of the <HI>Serving Knights.</HI> Of all the Four <HI>Classes,</HI>
the first only can aspire to the Dignities of the
Order, that is, to the Title and Office of <HI>Comman∣ders,
Grand Crosses,</HI> and <HI>Great Master.</HI> The two first
are given in Order, according to their Seniority;
for the oldest <HI>Knights</HI> are in Course promoted to
<PB N="127" REF="82"/>
be <HI>Commanders,</HI> and the oldest <HI>Commanders</HI> to be
<HI>Grand Crosses.</HI> But the Office of <HI>Great Master</HI> is on∣ly
obtain d by Election, without the least regard
to <HI>Seniority;</HI> so that frequently a simple <HI>Comman∣der</HI>
is preferr'd before all the <HI>Grand Crosses.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Crosses</HI> are so call'd from a large
Cross of white Sattin, that covers their whole
Breast, from their first Button-Hole to the Belly.
'Tis sew'd upon a kind of Sleeveless Vest, meet∣ing
on the side, which in Winter is made of black
Cloth, and in Summer of Silk. All the rest of
the Knights wear a red Vest of the same Fashion
when they go to War, but the Cross is white, and
of the same Figure with that which they wear at
their Button-Holes; but the Cross of the <HI>Serving
Knights</HI> is of a Circular Figure.</P>
<P>All the Employments and Offices of Honour
and Profit are at the Disposal of the <HI>Great Master,</HI>
who is oblig'd to chuse one of the <HI>Nobles:</HI> But
there are few even of that <HI>Classis</HI> who dare aspire
to the Dignity of <HI>Captain of the Galleys,</HI> by reason
of the vast Charge that attends it, since the Or∣der
only allows him a Set of Plate, which he must re∣store
when he quits that Employment. But to
make amends for that Inconveniency, the Captains
of the Galleys are soon after promoted to a <HI>Com∣mandery;</HI>
for tho' I told you that these Places are
usually given to the Senior Knights, yet there are
a considerable Number of 'em at the <HI>Great Master<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>
disposal, who bestows 'em on his Favourites. These
are call'd <HI>Commanderies of Grace,</HI> or <HI>Favour,</HI> which
exclude not the Possessors of 'em from enjoying
the Commanderies that fall to 'em by right of Se∣niority:
And besides, there are certain particular
Offices belonging to each <HI>Language,</HI> such as that
of <HI>Treasurer, Master of the Artillery,</HI> &amp;c. The Three
Sovereign Jurisdictions of <HI>Malta</HI> belong to the
College of the <HI>Grand Crosses.</HI> The First is the <HI>Great
<PB N="128" REF="83"/>
Council,</HI> compos'd of all the Members of the Col∣lege:
The Second is the <HI>Council</HI> of the <HI>Treasury;</HI>
and the Third of the <HI>Marine,</HI> or <HI>Admiralty;</HI> con∣sisting
each of three Members. Besides, the <HI>Great
Master</HI> chuses every Year a <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Verga,</HI>
who must be a Native of <HI>Malta,</HI> and consequent∣ly
no Knight: His Office is to administer Justice
to the Inhabitants of the City and Country. This
right of <HI>Seniority</HI> which gives a Title to the Of∣fices
of <HI>Commanders</HI> and <HI>Grand Crosses,</HI> is a great
Mortification to those who are not made Knights
in their Youth: And therefore they who design
to obtain that Dignity for their Children, procure
'em to be receiv'd into the Order as soon as
they are born, that they may not wait too long
for Preferrment. In the mean time, those who
have no Estates live in their respective Inns, of
which every <HI>Language</HI> has one. The Seven <HI>Lan∣guages</HI>
are those of <HI>Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy,
Arragon, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Castile.</HI> Over every <HI>Language</HI>
there is a <HI>Grand Cross,</HI> to whom the Order allows
eighty Crowns for each Man.</P>
<P>The Members of the Second <HI>Class</HI> serve at the
Altar, and are only capable of Ecclesiastical Pre∣ferment:
Thus they may obtain the Offices of
<HI>Vicars, Canons,</HI> and <HI>Grand Prior,</HI> which is the
highest Dignity within the reach of their Am∣bition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serving Knights</HI> are incapable of being pro∣moted
to the Dignity of a <HI>Grand Cross,</HI> or of
enjoying a <HI>Commandery</HI> by right of Seniority; but
they may possess <HI>Commanderies of Grace,</HI> which the
<HI>Great Master</HI> sometimes bestows on 'em, either as a
particular Mark of his Kindness, or as a Reward of
their Valour. They may rigg out <HI>Privateers</HI> under
the Banner of the Order; but none of this <HI>Classis</HI>
can be made <HI>Captain of the Galleys,</HI> since the <HI>Noble
Knights</HI> wou'd not submit to his Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="83"/>
As for the <HI>Great Master's Knights,</HI> who compose
the Fourth <HI>Class,</HI> they receive no other Honour or
Advantage by their Admission into the Order,
but a Salary of Eighty Crowns a Year, and the
Title of <HI>Knights of S. John.</HI></P>
<P>To these Four <HI>Classes</HI> I might add a Fifth, I
mean the <HI>Knights of the Holy Sepulchre,</HI> who wear a
Cross of Gold <HI>Potency;</HI> but since they are not ac∣knowledg'd
by the <HI>Knights of Malta,</HI> and have no
other Patents than what they receive from the
<HI>Fathers Observants,</HI> who are at present Guardians of
the Sepulchre, I will not trouble you with a far∣ther
Account of 'em.</P>
<P>Having given you a general <HI>Idea</HI> of the Four
<HI>Classes,</HI> and of all the inferiour Offices, I shall in
the next place proceed to consider the Supreme
Dignity of the Order. The <HI>Great, Master</HI> is very
careful to preserve the Respect due to his Chara∣cter,
and seldom Converses familiarly with the
<HI>Knights,</HI> nor even with the <HI>Grand Crosses.</HI> When
he goes to Church, all the Knights whom he
meets in the <HI>Square,</HI> and by the Way, join in his
Train; and when he returns they make a dou∣ble
File, thro' which he passes. All the Officers of
his Houshold are <HI>Noble Knights,</HI> even the very Pages,
of whom he entertains twenty four. His princi∣pal
Officers are the <HI>Master of the Horse,</HI> the <HI>Major
Domo,</HI> and the <HI>High Chamberlain.</HI> The present <HI>Great
Master</HI> is descended from the Illustrious House of
<HI>Caraffa:</HI> He is a large and thick Man, of a good
Mien, but very old: He keeps a Table for a hundred
Knights, whom he chuses to be partakers of his
Bounty, and who by that means may save the
Pension they receive from the Order.</P>
<P>The Habits of the Knights are very different
at <HI>Malta:</HI> The <HI>French, Italians,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> re∣taining
the Modes of their respective Nations.
The Garb of the last is so odd, that I cannot for∣bear
<PB N="130" REF="84"/>
giving you some Account of it: They wear
a Doublet slit before and behind, and the Sleeves
are also slit, and close at the Wrists; an old-fa∣shion'd
Collar, narrow Breeches fasten'd with But∣tons;
and, in a Word, I cou'd not chuse a more
Comical Habit if I were going to act the <HI>Spani∣ard</HI>
in a Mask. The <HI>Italians</HI> are dress'd exactly
like so many <HI>Scaramouchi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI></P>
<P>The Order takes care to preserve some exter∣nal
Marks of Hospitality, which, as I told you,
was the Design of their Institution: They keep a
Magnificent Hospital, endow'd with a Revenue of
50000 Livres. The Commandery of it belongs to
the <HI>French Language,</HI> and is one of the principal
Offices of the Order: The Magnificence of the
Structure does not appear on the Outside, but the
Apartments are very fine. There are five Halls,
capable of containing four hundred sick Persons,
who are serv'd by the Knights when they Eat or
Drink, the Servants of the Hospital taking care of
the rest. The Vessels are generally of Silver; the
Beds are good, and the Linen is chang'd pretty
often. And besides, the diseas'd are so plentiful∣ly
furnish'd with all things that are proper for
their Entertainment and Cure, that the Knights
themselves scruple not to lodge here when they are
sick. 'Tis true, they are not laid in the same
Rooms with so many dead and dying Persons,
whose Company alone wou'd infect the soundest
Man in the World with their Distempers: For
they lie in separate Halls, and are serv'd apart.
<HI>Catholicks</HI> of all Nations, without exception, are
receiv'd into the Hospital; but these Acts of Cha∣rity
are not very Chargeable to the Order,
since their Guests are seldom very Numerous.</P>
<P>These few Observations may suffice to give you
an <HI>Idea</HI> of the Order of <HI>Malta.</HI> My next shall
contain an Account of the Island in general, and
<PB N="131" REF="84"/>
of the Manners and Customs of its Inhabitants:
In the mean time I wish you good Night, and

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>MAlta</HI> is so low an Island that 'tis scarce dis∣cernible
above twenty Miles off at Sea, even
in the clearest Weather; so that many Ships pass
by without perceiving it. There are no Woods in
it by reason of the shallowness of the Ground;
for the whole Island is only a dry Rock, which,
with much ado, may be made to produce some∣thing.
And the scarcity of Earth makes it so
precious, that if a Man were found stealing it out
of his Neighbours Grounds, he wou'd be punish'd
with the utmost Severity. The only Trees that
grow there are <HI>Oranges, Citrons, Apricocks, Peaches,</HI>
and <HI>Pomgranates,</HI> which require no great depth of
Earth; and even these grow only in certain parts
of the Island, the rest being planted with Vines,
which bear a very delicious Grape: There are al∣so
<HI>Strawberries, Pastaiques,</HI> and excellent <HI>Figs,</HI> and
a prodigious quantity of the best <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> in the
World, which we eat as often as we please:
They are almost all white, but sweet as Sugar,
and melt in the Mouth. The <HI>Pastaique</HI> is a Fruit
very much resembling a Citrul, but not quite so
big. 'Tis eaten raw like a Melon, and melts in the
<PB N="132" REF="85"/>
Mouth. Tho' it be expos'd a whole Day to the
Sun-Beams, it remains as fresh as if it had been
kept in Snow. There are two sorts of it, one
red, and the other white: The first is the best; but
the Buyer must take 'em at a venture, as well as
Melons. 'Tis the usual Custom when five or
six Citizens meet on the publick Place, to open
a Score of 'em, and those who have the fortune
to meet with none but white ones, are oblig'd
to pay for the rest; which they call playing at
<HI>Pastaiques.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Malta</HI> is hotter than <HI>Rome,</HI> or any other place
in <HI>Europe;</HI> and the stifling Heat of the Climate is
so much the more insupportable, because there are
no cool Breezes to temper it; and the Brow of
the Hill is expos'd directly to the <HI>South.</HI> The
Peasants are as black as <HI>Egyptians;</HI> for they take
no care to preserve themselves from the Sun;
and the most scorching Heat is not able to drive
'em into their Houses, or even make 'em leave
off working. This is an evident Demonstration
of the Power of Nature in performing things
that seem to be impossible: For there are few
things which a Man may not suffer if he be ac∣custom'd
to 'em from his Infancy, as the <HI>Mal∣tese</HI>
are in this case, who inure the Bodies of
their Children to Heat, by making 'em go stark
naked, without Shirt, Drawers, or Cap, as soon
as they are taken from their Mother s Breast, to
the Age of Ten Years; so that their Skin grows
as hard as Leather. You will easily perceive that
I speak of the Peasants, and Meaner sort of the
Inhabitants; for all the rest cloath their Chil∣dren
as they do in other Countries: Only to pre∣serve
themselves from the Heat, they never go a∣broad
during the hottest part of the Day; and
besides, they cloath themselves very slightly, and
sleep from Noon till four a-clock. The richer
<PB N="133" REF="85"/>
sort make use of a kind of Fans, which are ve∣ry
much in fashion among Persons of Quality in
<HI>Italy,</HI> I mean certain Machines hung at the Ceil∣ing,
about three Foot broad and usually made of
some Silk Stuff, stretch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon small and very
thin Laths, surrounded with Ostrich-Feathers.
There is also a small silken Cord fasten'd to it,
and drawn thro' a Hole into the Anti-chamber,
where a Servant is plac'd to keep the Machine
playing by pulling the Cord. These Fans are u∣sually
hung over a Couch, or Bed of Repose,
where a Man may lie and enjoy the Pleasure of Fan∣ning
as long as he pleases: And sometimes one
of 'em is plac'd on the Table, both for Coolness,
and to drive away the Flies. If you consider al∣so
the <HI>Sorbet, Straw-berries, Raspherries,</HI> and all the
<HI>cooling Waters</HI> us'd in <HI>Italy,</HI> you will not blame me
for affirming that a Rich Man may live com∣fortably
in any Climate, and easily avoid all the
Inconveniencies of excessive Heat or Cold. I
need not go farther than <HI>Malta</HI> for a convincing
Proof of this Assertion; since the violent Heat
that reigns here serves only to encrease
the Pleasure of being fann'd, and of drinking
cold Liquors, with which this Island is always
furnish d, tho' the Winter produces neither Snow
nor Ice: For the <HI>Great Master</HI> takes care to sup∣ply
that defect, by letting out the Sale of these
Commodities by way of Farm, to a Man, who
sends every Winter to <HI>Sicily</HI> for a sufficient quan∣tity
to fill the Ice-Houses, and is oblig d to fur∣nish
the Island all the Summer, under pain of
paying a Fine of Ten Crowns a Day, in case
of failure.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Malta</HI> is very populous, and rec∣kon'd
to contain 15000 Men, who are all divi∣ded
into Companies. They are oblig'd to wear
Swords, but forbidden to draw 'em under such ri∣gorous
<PB N="134" REF="86"/>
Penalties, that the natural Malice of the
Inhabitants is very effectually curb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by their Fear
of Punishment: Yet they sometimes venture to
execute their Fury with a little Poniard or <HI>Stiletto,</HI>
after the <HI>Italian</HI> fashion. I cannot better express the
barbarity of their Temper and Inclinations, than by
telling you, that their Humour is not different
from that of the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> that, like them, they
are Treacherous and Bloody, Jealous even to Mad∣ness,
and capable of attempting the most horrid
Villanies when they are animated by that cruel
Passion. To convince you of the Justness of this
Character, 'twill be sufficient to relate two Acci∣dents
that happen'd very lately; for the two Prin∣ciple
Actors are still alive, and remain in the
Churches of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> and St. <HI>John,</HI> whither
they f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, to avoid the just Punishment of their
Crimes.</P>
<P>The first had a young, handsom, and loving
Wife, yet (according to the Custom of all his
Countrymen, both Batchelors and marry'd Men,)
he kept a Whore, who possess'd his Heart and
Soul, and was so absolutely the Mistress of his
Affection, that without regarding his Duty to his
Wife, he lay every Night at her House. This
malicious Woman made use of the Power she had
over him to irritate him against his injur'd Wife,
telling him, that he had reason to suspect her Ver∣tue,
since he gave her so many inviting Oppor∣tunities
of repaying him in his own Coin; and
his guilty Conscience prompting him to conclude
that the might be as vicious as himself, he resolv'd to
bring her along with him every Night, and made her
lie in the same Bed with him and his Concubine,
since there was not another in the Lodging.
Judge, Sir, with what Grief and Horrour this poor
Creature cou'd behold her <HI>due Benevolence</HI> squander'd
away upon an impudent <HI>Doxey</HI> in her presence;
<PB N="135" REF="86"/>
and whether ever any Woman was so barbarously
treated. 'Tis certainly the highest and most cruel
Indignity that cou'd be put upon a <HI>Wife;</HI> and
there is no Crime so inhumane which such a
<HI>Husband</HI> wou'd not dare to commit. Thus she
liv'd for above a Year, till at last her Patience
being intirely exhausted, she was not able any
longer to bear the insupportable Torment of be∣ing
made the Spectatour of her own Shame and
Misery; and therefore advis'd her Husband, since
he cou'd not overcome his Passion, to bring the
Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>san home to his House, where he might en∣joy
his Pleasure with more Conveniency and less
Charge. This Advice was so agreeable to his Hu∣mour,
that he resolv'd once in his Life to com∣ply
with her Desires: But she had little reason
to be satisfy'd with the Success of her Proposal,
for she liv'd in a perpetual Hell with her pityless
Tormentour, and his insolent Strumpet. But in∣stead
of making a tedious Relation of all the Af∣fronts
they put upon her, I shall only acquaint
you with the Tragical Conclusion of the Story.
He had a Son, about nine Years old, who having
seen his Mother at Church speaking to one of her
Brothers, who was newly come from <HI>Italy,</HI> and
whom the Boy did not know, went immediately
to tell his Father, that his Mother was discoursing
with a Stranger: And that inhumane Villain,
without enquiring farther into the Matter, or so
much as accusing her of her Crime, stabb'd her
with his Poniard as soon as she came home.</P>
<P>The other, who retir'd to the Church of S. <HI>Lewis,</HI>
was as unmerciful to his <HI>Whore</HI> as the former was
to his <HI>Wife.</HI> He knew that she intended to Mar∣ry,
and had often with horrible Threatnings for∣bidden
her to prosecute that Design. But she was
so weary of her infamous way of Living, that
she resolv'd, notwithstanding his repeated Menaces,
<PB N="136" REF="87"/>
to provide herself a Husband, and was even actu∣ally
engag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with a certain Tradesman. Her Gal∣lant
hearing of this new Intrigue, and having seen
her two or three times talking with the young
Man's Sister, ran to her House in a Transport of
Fury, and immediately told her, that <HI>he was come
to kill her.</HI> She being ignorant of the cause of his
Rage, and imagining that he only intended to
laugh at her Fear, threw her Arms about his Neck,
and embracing him, <HI>And why, my Heart,</HI> said she,
<HI>wou'dst thou kill me? Because thou art an impudent
Where,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>and wou'dst Marry in spite of me;
but I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll quickly cure thy Longing:</HI> Immediately
he stabb'd her in the Breast with his Poniard, and
repeated the Blow four times, till he laid her dead
upon the Spot. The Barbarity of these Murde∣rers
is so prodigiously inhumane, that these two
Instances will give you a livelier <HI>Idea</HI> of the Hu∣mour
of this People, than the most pathetic De∣scription
I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d make of it.</P>
<P>The Number of the <HI>Curtesans</HI> is extremely great;
their Trade is not at all reputed scandalous; and
when they have earn'd a little Money, they may
Marry, and are esteem'd as honest Women as if
they had kept their Maidenhead for their Husbands.
No Person whatsoever dares offer 'em the least
indignity; for they are look'd upon as Publick
Persons that ought to be Sacred; and there are
even some Ladies of Honour who disdain not
their Acquaintance and Society; so that 'tis not
an easie Task to distinguish those Prostitutes from
Vertueus Women. The Curtesans of <HI>Rome</HI> and
<HI>Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> are beholding to the same Cause for the
Advantageous Privileges they enjoy: There the
<HI>Priests</HI> govern, and here the Authority is lodg'd
in the <HI>Knights.</HI> Both of 'em have sworn <HI>Chastity,</HI>
and neither of 'em are able to keep their Vows.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cannot forbear taking notice of a pretty odd
<PB N="137" REF="87"/>
Custom in this Place, for the conveniency of
Strangers, who having no Acquaintance, and for
the most part staying but two or three Days in
the Island, might be sometimes oblig'd to leave it
without tasting its most delicious Fruit: For 'tis
not the Fashion here to visit Strangers in their
Ships, as at <HI>Leghorn. Malta</HI> is a Land of Li∣berty,
where Pleasure is not forc'd upon any
Man: But they who have a mind to divert them∣selves,
may easily find a Play-fellow by walking
about the Streets with a <HI>Sequin</HI> in their Hand,
holding it so that it may be seen; for this is a
never-failing Signal, which will procure 'em twen∣ty
Invitations in a Moment.</P>
<P>The Habit of the Women in this Place is as Me∣lancholic
and Dismal when they go abroad, as 'tis
Wanton and Lascivious when they are at home. In
the Streets you see nothing but a long black Veil in∣stead
of a Woman, which covers 'em so intirely from
Head to Foot, that such a sight wou'd cost a <HI>Low
Briton</HI> at least twenty <HI>Signs of the Cross:</HI> for the Wo∣men
in this City look just like so many <HI>Ghosts</HI> wrapt
in Shrowds, stalking about the Streets. But if
they are <HI>Ghosts</HI> in the Street, they are <HI>Angels</HI> at
home; for tho' the Peasants are tawny, the Wo∣men
who live in the City have the fairest Complexi∣ons
in the World. I can only give you an Account
of their Summer Dress, since I never had occasion
to see 'em in the Winter. They wear a fine White
Smock, plaited at the Neck like a Man's Shirt;
but the Opening is so wide, that it leaves their
Shoulders and Breasts intirely expos'd to the View of
the ravish'd Beholder: the Sleeves are very large,
and tuck'd up to the Neck-band of the Smock to
which they are fasten'd with a Pin, so that one may
see their whole Arms. This Smock is almost their
intire Habit, for they wear nothing above it but a
very little Pair of Boddice about their Waste under
<PB N="138" REF="88"/>
their Breasts, which being not above a Span long,
serves only to set off the Fineness of their Shape,
and rather exposes than conceals those alluring
Charms that strike the Eyes and Hearts of the
Spectator with a sweet but irresistible Violence. The
Mens Habit is not different from ours, at least they
endeavour as much as they can, to imitate it.</P>
<P>Almost all the <HI>Maltese</HI> are serv'd by <HI>Slaves,</HI> who
are suffer'd to walk freely about the Streets all day,
as well as those who belong to the Order; but they
are all oblig'd to retire in the Evening to the publick
Baths, as at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and if any of 'em shou'd fail
to come at the time appointed, he wou'd be put
to death as a Fugitive. The <HI>Galley-Slaves</HI> are the
most miserable Wretches in the World; yet there
are some Persons here who have so little regard to
their own Happiness, as to sell themselves for a hun∣dred
Crowns to the Order: they continue Slaves
during their whole Life without any Pay, rowing
naked and chain'd as the rest, without any other
Mark of Distinction than the Title of <HI>Bonne Vogue,</HI>
whereas the <HI>Turks</HI> are call'd <HI>Slaves.</HI> I know there
are also some of these voluntary Slaves at <HI>Venice,</HI>
where they are call'd <HI>Gallioti,</HI> and even the Repub∣lick
finds less Difficulty in levying 'em than in rai∣sing
Soldiers: but they are only engag'd to serve
three Years on the Galleys, whereas the <HI>Bonne Vogue</HI>
at <HI>Malta</HI> are perpetual Slaves, without the least hope
of recovering their Liberty.</P>
<P>There are only seven <HI>Galleys</HI> belonging to the Or∣der,
which are sent every Year under the Command
of a General to assist the <HI>Venetians.</HI> The Govern∣ment
is constantly employ'd about raising new
Funds, without which they cannot encrease the
Number of their Galleys.</P>
<P>There are Three <HI>Languages</HI> spoken in the City;
the <HI>French, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Italian.</HI> The last of these
is authoriz'd by the Government, and us'd in pub∣lick
<PB N="139" REF="88"/>
Writings. The Peasants in the Country speak
a corrupt Dialect of the <HI>Arabic:</HI> and 'twou'd not be
an easie Task to make 'em leave it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holy Office of the Inquisition,</HI> that dreadful Tri∣bunal,
famous for its Injustice and Cruelty, reigns
more Tyrannically here than at <HI>Rome</HI> it self. I have
heard a hundred remarkable Stories of its Barbarity;
but I'm too much your Friend to disturb the Tran∣quillity
of your Mind with such dismal Relations.
And therefore instead of entring on so Melancho∣lic
a Subject, I shall only observe that <HI>Confessors,</HI>
who in any other Country would be burnt if they
should divulge the Secrets with which they are in∣trusted,
are oblig'd here to reveal 'em, as often as
the <HI>Inquisition</HI> is concern'd in the Discovery. 'Tis
true, they do not own this Maxim, for fear of
spoiling their Trade; but the Truth of it is too
well known to be call'd in question: In the mean
time, to prevent Suspicion, they are sometimes si∣lent
for a Year or two, after which the <HI>Inquisitor</HI>
sends for the Party accus'd, and asks him whe∣ther
he knows the reason why he is brought be∣fore
him. Then must the poor Wretch call to
mind all that ever he said; and if he has either
forgot his Fault, or refuses to own it, confiding
in the Secrecy and Fidelity of his Confessour,
whom he knows to be his only Confident,
he's a dead Man, and must not entertain the least
hope of Mercy: For they strangle him in Prison,
and some time after tell his Relations that they
may forbear sending him Provisions. Happy are
they who are not subject to this Yoke!</P>
<P>I saw a Church, t'other day, in which there
is a little <HI>Grotto,</HI> where 'tis said S. <HI>Paul</HI> liv'd three
Months: But 'tis so small, and contriv'd in such
a manner, that I'm much enclin'd to suspect the
Truth of this Tradition. However, every one
that comes, carries away a piece of it, as a Pre∣servative
<PB N="140" REF="89"/>
against the biting of Serpents: And they
pretend that by a perpetual Miracle, the Rock is
never diminish'd. I will not dispute the Truth of
the Matter of Fact, tho' I can assure you that
there are visible Gaps or Notches in the Rock,
and that they still continue to break off Pieces of
it: But supposing it to be as big as ever, I see
no reason why we shou'd have recourse to a Mi∣racle
on this Occasion, since 'tis generally acknow∣ledg'd,
that there are some Rocks which grow
naturally till they be separated from their Roots:
And our Mariners, who are no very able Philo∣sophers,
show'd me one in our Voyage hither,
which is commonly call'd the <HI>Brothers;</HI> and why
may not S. <HI>Paul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Grotto</HI> be of the same Nature.
But this is not the only <HI>Miracle</HI> in <HI>Malta:</HI> They
tell us, that there are no <HI>Serpents</HI> in the Island,
and wou'd have us believe that this Privilege was
the Effect of a Viper's biting the same Apostle,
as you may read in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles.</HI> For
my part, I must confess, I'm as little satisfy'd
with this Sotry as with the other; for some Per∣sons
assure me that there are Serpents in <HI>Malta:</HI> But
supposing there were none, I had occasion to men∣tion
another Island in my last, which may boast
of the same Advantage; and why shou'd the Mi∣racle
be greater here than at <HI>Guernsey,</HI> where tis
certain there is neither <HI>Toad, Scorpion,</HI> nor any o∣ther
Venomous Creature: And, which adds to the
Wonder, I know that the Governour, who is a
Curious Person, having order'd some of those Ani∣mals
to be brought to the Island, they dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d im∣mediately.
I'm confident if the <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI>
were Masters of that Island, they wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d make
some Saint the Author of this Privilege, which
might perhaps be pretended with less improbabili∣ty,
to be the effect of a supernatural Cause, than
at <HI>Malta,</HI> since the Island of <HI>Jersey,</HI> which is but
<PB N="141" REF="89"/>
seven Leagues distant from <HI>Guernsey,</HI> is so extreme∣ly
pester'd with Serpents and Toads, that the
Houses are full of 'em, and none of the Peasants
dare lie upon the Ground. This, I doubt not
will seem strange to you; but you will be stil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
more surpriz'd when I have told you that it
<HI>rains Toads</HI> in this Island: If you suspect the Truth
of this odd <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> you may receive a Con∣firmation
of it from any Man that has been upon
the Place.</P>
<P>Nature is so Mysterious and Unsearchable in
her Operations, and Men are generally so apt to
admire what they cannot comprehend, that their
Inclination to ascribe surprizing Events to super∣natural
Causes, may be justly reckon'd an effect
of their Ignorance. I'm so fully persuaded of this
Truth, that I seldom or never take Notice of those
<HI>Miracles</HI> that make so great a Noise in the Coun∣treys
thro' which I have occasion to pass: And
besides, since I have reason to believe that such
Stories wou'd not contribute much to your Di∣version:
I'm resolv'd to trouble you with none of
'em, unless they be either very <HI>extraordinary,</HI> or
extremely <HI>ridiculous.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE sail'd from <HI>Malta, June...,</HI> and leaving
<HI>Sicily</HI> on our Left-hand, enter'd the <HI>Archi∣pelago.</HI>
After a Voyage of fifteen Days, without
any remarkable Disturbance, we arriv'd at the
Height of <HI>Troy,</HI> and our Vessel standing in to
<HI>Tenedos,</HI> both by reason of the contrary Wind,
and to take in some fresh Provisions, I took this
Occasion to visit the Ruines of that famous City,
which are at present so obscure and inconsiderable,
that unless a Man's Mind were full of the <HI>Idea</HI> of
it, he might view it all over without perceiving
the least reason to conclude that ever any Town
stood in that place. Yet by a Curious Search, an
inquisitive Traveller may find enough to convince
him, that 'twas formerly of a prodigious Extent:
And I observ'd some Marks of it in four or five
different Places, two of which were about twen∣ty
Miles distant. The next Day we set sail with
a favourable Wind, and enter'd the Canal of <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI>
otherwise call'd the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> at the Mouth
of which we found two Castles, one in <HI>Europe,</HI>
and the other in <HI>Asia,</HI> separated by the Canal or
Strait, which is about a Mile and a half broad
in this Place, and retains the same breadth almost
throughout. The <HI>European</HI> Castle is a Mass com∣pos'd
of three great Towers, surrounded with a
weak and inconsiderable Wall, after the manner of
a <HI>False-bray,</HI> at the Foot of which there are twen∣ty
Pieces of Cannon level with the Water. 'Tis
said that they carry a fifty Pound Ball of Stone;
and indeed their Mouths are so wide, that the
<PB N="143" REF="90"/>
very sight of 'em is terrible: Nevertheless, I'm apt
to believe that they are not fit for Service, and
even that they cou'd not bear above one discharge,
both by reason of their thinness, and because
they are not mounted on Carriages. There is
a Mountain behind the Castle that overlooks and
commands it.</P>
<P>The other Castle, which is seated upon the
<HI>Asian</HI> Shore, is of a Square Figure, according to the
Ancient manner of Building, defended only with
some small Towers join'd to the Wall; and with∣out
there is a Battery of Cannons behind a Wall,
as in the other. The Captain was oblig'd to stop
at this place, and one of the Officers of the Cu∣stom-House
came on board our Ship, and accom∣pany'd
us to <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Having pass'd the Ca∣nal,
we enter'd into the Sea formerly call'd the
<HI>Propontis,</HI> and at present <HI>Marmora,</HI> from the Name
of an Island which contains a great quantity of
very fine Marble. Twenty Miles from thence we
discover'd <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and had the pleasure of
viewing the finest Landskip that ever I beheld;
for it strikes all those who look upon it with
Wonder and Astonishment. Imagine you see a
great City stretch'd along the Shore for above six
Miles, and so situated sloping towards the Sea,
that you perceive at once an infinite Number of
Mosquees, adorn'd with little Domes cover'd with
Lead, and high Turrets, which altogether make
one of the most lovely Prospects in the World:
Whilst the Eye is busy'd in contemplating this
charming Variety of Objects, 'tis agreeably divert∣ed
with the sight of the <HI>Castle of the Seven Towers,</HI>
and of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which are particularly remark∣able
not only for their largeness, but for a vast
Number of gilt Globes and Spires, resembling lit∣tle
Steeples. The nearer I approach'd, I still dis∣cover'd
new Ornaments; and after I had consi∣der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<PB N="144" REF="91"/>
at leisure so many Wonders, I was at last
agreeably surpriz'd with the Beauty of the Port:
'Tis three Miles long, and almost one broad, clean
and deep throughout, even to the Shoar, the lar∣gest
Ships coming up close to the Land, so that
one may go on board without making use of a
Boat. 'Tis strange that the Harbour is never fill'd
up, especially near the Shore, since all the Filth
of the City is cast into it, without the Advan∣tage
of a Tide to carry it away. At the En∣trance
into the Port there is a high square Tower,
commonly call'd <HI>The Tower of Leander,</HI> from a Per∣son
of that Name, who, according to the Story,
us'd to swim thither every Night to see his Mi∣stress,
who was imprison'd in the Tower. There
is a Fountain on the Rock, with some Pieces of
Cannon, which might defend the Entry in case of
Necessity.</P>
<P>As soon as we arriv'd, I went with the Captain
to salute the Baron <HI>de Chasteau-neuf,</HI> Ambassador
of <HI>France,</HI> who receiv'd me very civilly. He has
a good Mien, and is Master of a great deal of
Wit: He was formerly Councellor in the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Paris,</HI> and was sent to the Port about the
end of the last Year, in the room of Monsieur
<HI>de Girardin,</HI> who died here. He is a <HI>Savoyard</HI> by
birth, but a very zealous Promoter of the Interests
of <HI>Franee:</HI> He spares nothing to gain the <HI>Turks;</HI>
he endeavours to win 'em with Presents, Caresses,
and Entertainments; his Table is always full of
'em; but his principal Care is to oblige those
whom he knows to be the Favourites of the great
Officers. I know one among the rest, call'd <HI>So∣liman
Aga,</HI> who is extremely debauch'd, and since
he always finds excellent Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the Ambassa∣dor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
Table, he goes thither very often, and is still
receiv'd with all imaginable Demonstrations of
Love and Kindness. After I had the Honour to
<PB N="145" REF="91"/>
Sup with the Ambassadour, I went to lodge at
a Tavern, or Victualling-House. If I had resolv'd
to have stay'd long in the Country, I wou'd have
boarded in some Family, for Strangers are very
ill accomodated in these Publick-Houses. Every
Nation is permitted to have three; so that there
wou'd be nine in all, if the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>
thought fit to make use of their Privilege: 'Tis
still more difficult to obtain a Permission to keep
an Oven: One must procure a special <HI>Mandamus</HI>
from the <HI>Sultan</HI> for that effect, and pay a Thou∣sand
<HI>Avanies</HI> to the <HI>Bassa</HI> and <HI>Cadi;</HI> and there is
only one allow'd for the use of each Nation in
every Town; for the <HI>Turks</HI> are so extremely afraid
of Fire, that they suffer very few Ovens to be
kept in their Cities. They are also very careful to
prevent the Exportation of Corn; for 'tis a Ca∣pital
Crime to carry it out of the Country, or
even to sell it to private Families: And for the
more effectual Execution of these Orders, there
are certain Officers appointed to over-see the Mar∣kets,
who suffer no Man to buy a∣bove
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Somewhat more than 20 Quarters.</NOTE><HI>Four Muids</HI> at a time, nor even
the least quantity, without a Licence
from the <HI>Nais.</HI> Offences of this Na∣ture
are punish'd with so much Rigour, that if a
Peasant were convicted of selling his Corn to a
<HI>Christian,</HI> 'twou'd cost him more than 500 Bastina∣do's.
But before I proceed to describe the Man∣ners
and Customs of the Inhabitants, I shall give
you a short Account of the City of <HI>Constanti∣nople.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis seated in <HI>Europe,</HI> on a Point or Tongue of
Land that juts out into the Sea of <HI>Marmora,</HI> in
a Triangular Figure, six Miles long, and fourteen
in compass, two of its sides being wash'd by the
Sea. 'Twas founded by <HI>Pausanias,</HI> King of <HI>Sparta,</HI>
who gave it the Name of <HI>Byzantium,</HI> which it re∣tain'd
<PB N="146" REF="92"/>
till <HI>Constantine the Great,</HI> resolving to make
it the Metropolis of the World, order'd it to be
rebuilt with all imaginable Magnificence; after
which it took the Name of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> or <HI>Con∣stantine's
Town;</HI> but the <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Stambol.</HI> The
<HI>French,</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> took it
in 1203. and fifty Years after ▪twas re-taken by
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who remain'd Masters of it till the
Year 1453, when it fell into the Hands of <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>
II. 'Tis at present the Capital City of the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, as it appears by the <HI>Grand Sig∣nior's</HI>
Titles, who stiles himself, <HI>The Ruler of Kings,
Distributer of Crowns, Lord of the</HI> White <HI>and</HI> Black
<HI>Seas, of</HI> Bagdat, Grand Cairo, Aleppo, <HI>&amp;c. and
particularly of the fain City of</HI> Stambol the well-defen∣ded,
<HI>which is the Desire of the Kings and Princes of
the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> is extremely pure, and so wholsome,
that the Inhabitants are never subject to any
reigning Disease but the <HI>Plague,</HI> which visits 'em
every Year, and makes a dreadful Havock among
'em. I'm apt to think that they wou'd live till
they dropt into their Graves through meer
Age and Weakness, if their Days were not
shorten'd by this Infectious Malady; and they are
so little acquainted with any other mortal Di∣stemper,
that when a <HI>Frenchman</HI> assures 'em that
the <HI>Plague</HI> is hardly known in his Country, they
usually cry, <HI>What d'ye die of then?</HI> The <HI>Climate</HI> is
so Temperate, that the Winters are never excessively
Cold, and the Summer-Heats are usually allay'd
with a pleasant Brieze, besides the drinking of
cool Liquors, which, in my Opinion, is one of
the greatest Pleasures of this Life.</P>
<P>In the Account I have given you of the Situ∣ation
and Bigness of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> I speak only of
the City which properly bears that Name; for
there are four other Towns join'd together, call'd
<PB N="147" REF="92"/>
<HI>Cassum Pacha, Galata, Pera,</HI> and <HI>Tophana,</HI> which may
be consider'd as a part, or rather as the Suburbs
of the City, since they are only separated from it
by the breadth of the Port, which is so small a
distance, that a Man who cries aloud, tho' with∣out
extending his Voice to the utmost, may be
easily heard on the other side. In these Towns,
and particularly in <HI>Pera,</HI> the Ambassadors and all
the <HI>Franks</HI> live; for they are not permitted to
reside at <HI>Constantinople.</HI> And 'tis to be observ'd,
that the Name of <HI>Franks</HI> is given indifferenly to
Men of all Nations who wear Hats. These four
Cities are about eight Miles in compass; so that
if they, together with the Village of <HI>Scutaret,</HI> and
some other Suburbs, be added to the City of <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
and all join'd together to make one vast
Town, <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in this sense, wou'd be found
to be double of <HI>Paris.</HI> But there is a great variety of
Opinions in this Case: Some comprehend all the a∣bove-mention'd
places under the Name of <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI>
others cut off the four Cities; and there
are some who include the City within the com∣pass
of its own Walls; so that almost every Tra∣veller
gives a different Account of its Extent from
all others.</P>
<P>The Walls with which 'tis at present surroun∣ded,
are the same that were built by <HI>Constan∣stine
the Great,</HI> except in some places where they
have been repair'd. They are double on the side
next the Land, with Battlements, after the <HI>Oriental</HI>
fashion, and Towers from place to place; and be∣sides,
they are defended with a lin'd but shallow
Ditch: These, with the <HI>Castle of the Seven Towers,</HI>
are all the Strength of <HI>Constantinople;</HI> for the Num∣ber
of its Inhabitants deserves not to be reckon'd
among its Advantages, since those <HI>Turks</HI> who are
never accustom'd to War, are so unfit to resist
an Enemy, that they wou'd only serve to consume
<PB N="148" REF="93"/>
the Provisions, and hasten a Famine: And besides,
I'm persuaded that Bombs wou'd do more execu∣tion
here than in any other City in the World;
for the Houses are generally of Wood, and the
Streets so narrow, that in the greatest part of
'em two loaded Horses cannot go a-breast. But
this is not the greatest inconvenience of their
manner of Building; for their Houses jut out so
far near the Top, that in several places one may
step from one Window to another, and cross the
Street without going down from his Chamber.
This Contrivance of their Houses does not pro∣ceed
from want of Room, for the City is full of
Gardens, and large Courts, that are perfectly use∣less.
But tho' I cannot acquaint you with the
reason that makes 'em so fond of this manner of
Building, I can assure you that it exposes 'em to
all those fatal Inconveniencies that are occasion'd
by <HI>Fire,</HI> which breaks out very frequently, and
proceeds with irresistable Fury, till it meets with
some Garden, or empty Place, where there are
no Houses to be burnt. Among so many Instan∣ces
of this Nature, I shall only take notice of one
that happen'd in the Year 88, which made so ter∣rible
a Havock in the City, that there were a∣bove
3000 Houses laid in Ashes. But besides the
dangerous Consequences of this kind of Archite∣cture,
'tis also very offensive to the Eye; for the
Streets are extremely disfigur'd by this Irregulari∣ty:
Nor are there any external Ornaments on the
Houses to make amends for this Defect, since they
are only daub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d over with a nasty red Paint, laid
upon the rough Wood, which is neither plan'd,
nor cut with any other Instrument than an Axe
or Saw; so that the Houses are all very ugly.
Judge, Sir, what reason I had to be surpriz'd,
when after I had view'd with Amazement the
magnificent Prospect of the City from the <HI>Sea of
<PB N="149" REF="93"/>
Marmora,</HI> I saw all my Expectations baulk'd, and
instead of so many Wonders, found only some
<HI>Mosques,</HI> and a few Monuments of <HI>Antiquity.</HI> Not
that I wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d discourage any Curious Person from
undertaking this Voyage; for tho' the Manners
and Customs of the Inhabitants ought never to
be propos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for Imitation, they are so odd and
singular, that an Inquisitive Traveller may employ
his Time and Curiosity with a great deal of Plea∣sure
in observing 'em. The <HI>Turks</HI> are opposite to
us in almost all respects: We content our selves
with one Wife, They marry several Wives; Our
Habit is short, Theirs long; We wear our Hair
long, and our Beards shav'd, They shave their Hair,
and suffer their Beards to grow; We write in a
streight Line from Left to Right, and They in a
crooked from Right to Left. I cou'd easily add
several other Instances of the same Nature, since
the Opposition reaches even to the meanest Acti∣ons,
such as the easing of Nature; for they crouch
down to Piss, like Women, and when they have
done, rub their Privities on a Wall, which they
think purifies 'em.</P>
<P>Two Days after our Arrival at <HI>Galata,</HI> the Cap∣tain
and I went to see <HI>Constantinople,</HI> with the <HI>French</HI>
Interpreter, who accompany'd us on purpose to
show us all the Curiosities. There are always so
many Boats passing from one side to another, that
the Port is usually cover'd with 'em, and their Fare
is only an <HI>Asper.</HI> We took Boat at the <HI>Custom-House,</HI>
and enter'd the City at the Gate of <HI>Gala∣ta,</HI>
or the next Gate to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which we
kept on our Left-hand, and went streight to the
<HI>Besestin,</HI> which is a distinct Canton of the City,
enclos'd with Gates and Walls, where all the Mer∣chants
keep Shops. This is the finest and most
regular place in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> not unlike to the
places that are appointed for the keeping of <HI>Fairs</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="94"/>
among us, such as that of S. <HI>Germain</HI> at <HI>Paris:</HI>
The Streets are divided after the same manner, and
cover'd above with Planks join'd together upon
Rafters, which form a kind of Roof, sufficient to
secure the place against all the Inconveniences of
bad Weather, tho' there are Holes left to let in
the Light. Here all the finest and most precious
Wares of <HI>Constantinople</HI> are to be seen; for every
Merchant keeps a Shop in this Place, as it were
for a Pattern of all the Goods contain'd in his
Ware-house; and the Shops are rank'd and dispos'd
in such excellent Order, that the Buyer may di∣spatch
his Business in less than a quarter of an
Hour; for all the Trades are separated, and con∣fin'd
to their proper places. Thus one part of the
<HI>Besestin</HI> is possess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the <HI>goldsmiths,</HI> whose Work,
indeed, is not so fine, nor their Shops so well
furnish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>England;</HI> but I only speak
here of their Order and Regularity: Another
place is set apart for the <HI>Drapers,</HI> or those who sell
<HI>Dutch, French,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Cloth: Not far from
thence are the Sellers of Silk Stuffs, and Gold and
Silver Brocado's; the Makers of <HI>Talpo,</HI> or Head-Dresses
for Women, which are very magnificent;
the <HI>Babouchi,</HI> or <HI>Shoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-makers,</HI> the <HI>Taylors, Grocers,</HI>
and all sort of Shopkeepers, have also their di∣stinct
Streets. The Gates are shut every Evening
at Ten a Clock, by Persons who are hir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for
that purpose, and those who have occasion to pass
this way later, must give two or three Pence to
the Porters, who wait constantly at the Gates.
This is the only place in <HI>Constantinople</HI> where there
are Shops; for the rest of the City consists only
of little and narrow Streets, which for the most part
are so desolate that one may pass thro' the Town
without meeting so many Persons as Streets, unless in
the Publick Places, such as the <HI>Hyppodrome,</HI> whither we
went after we had view'd the <HI>Besestin.</HI> This spacious
<PB N="151" REF="94"/>
Place was built by the Emperour <HI>Constantine,</HI> for
Exercises on Horse-back, and is still call'd by the
<HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Place of Horses.</HI> 'Tis an Oblong Square,
400 Paces long, and about 200 broad. Towards
the End opposite to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> there are two
<HI>Obelisks;</HI> the first consisting of one Stone, is seven∣ty
Foot high, adorn'd with several Hieroglyphical
Figures in <HI>Relief,</HI> and plac'd on a square Marble
Pedestal. On one of the Faces of the Pedestal,
there is a <HI>Latin</HI> Inscription, so ancient and worn,
that all that can be learn'd by it is, that it was
built by <HI>Theodosius:</HI> The second contains a like
Inscription in <HI>Greek:</HI> The third is adorn'd with
the Figure of the Emperour seated on a Throne,
and accompany'd with his great Officers; and in
the fourth there is a Representation of a Battle,
in Memory of some Victory obtain'd over that
Prince's Enemies. The other <HI>Obelisk</HI> is a sharp
pointed <HI>Pyramid,</HI> built of Free-Stones, without any
Inscription, and begins to decay extremely. Near
these <HI>Obelisks</HI> there is a Brazen Pillar of a consi∣derable
height, commonly call'd the <HI>Serpentine Co∣lumn,</HI>
because it consists of three Serpents wreath'd
and twisted together, with their Tails fasten'd in
the Ground, and ending at the Top in three ga∣ping
Heads, which seem to hiss, and threaten the
three parts of the World that were known in
that Age. Some pretend that this Column is a
Hieroglyphical Representation of the united Em∣pires
of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West,</HI> extending their Do∣minion
over the whole Universe: But the most
common Opinion is, that in the time of the Em∣perour
<HI>Leo Isaurus,</HI> who was a great Magician,
there were three Monstruous <HI>Serpents,</HI> who made
so prodigious a Havock in the Country about
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> that the People were forc'd to aban∣don
their Habitations; and that the Emperor
drew these Serpents by Enchantment into a large
<PB N="152" REF="95"/>
Ditch, which he made in the middle of the <HI>Hippo∣drome,</HI>
where they were kill'd, and cover'd with
Earth. The Story adds, that to prevent a like
Misfortune for the future, this Column was ere∣cted
by the same Prince, as a <HI>Talisman</HI> against
Serpents, of which there are at present very few
in the Country. One of these Heads wants the
the Nether-Jaw, and 'tis said that <HI>Sultan Morat</HI>
broke it off with his Hand. The <HI>Turks</HI> boast
much of the wonderful Strength of that Empe∣rour,
as a Memorial of which, they preserve in
the Castle of <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> ten great Bucklers pierc'd
with a Stake, or Wooden Javelin, which they pre∣tend
he darted at 'em; the Stake sticking still in
the Bucklers, and keeping 'em all joyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d together.</P>
<P>The Story of the <HI>Serpentine Column</HI> is not the only
fabulous Tradition concerning the Emperour <HI>Leo.</HI>
The <HI>Greeks,</HI> especially, who are without Contra∣diction
the most superstitious People in the World,
and most addicted to Miracles, take pleasure in
relating a Thousand Wonders of the Life of that
Prince. For Example: They tell us that he made
two <HI>Torto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses,</HI> by Art Magick, of a surprizing big∣ness,
which drew his Chariot, and both Eat and
Drank, tho' they were not natural Animals; ad∣ding,
that these <HI>Tertois<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> are still to be seen in the
<HI>Grand Sign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or's</HI> Garden, but that they have remain'd
immoveable ever since his Death. They pretend
also that the same Emperour made a <HI>Tree</HI> with
its Franches and Leaves so artificially contriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
that they seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to be perfectly Natural, and that
the Boughs were fill'd with a hundred <HI>Magical
Birds</HI> of different kinds, who upon the least breath
of Wind, warbl'd out their various Notes, and all
together made a most charming Melody. These
are some of the Tales with which the <HI>Greeks</HI> are
wont to talk Men asleep.</P>
<P>There are two other Columns in <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="95"/>
one call'd the <HI>Historical,</HI> and the other the <HI>Burnt
Column;</HI> for the last was actually burnt. Adjoining
to these we saw a large Court, appointed for the
use of <HI>Archers:</HI> The Master of the Sport presented
us with a Bow, and we had the Pleasure to shoot
some Arrows at the Mark, which was fasten'd on
a Wall, and contain'd several lesser Marks, gra∣dually
decreasing, so that the least was not big∣ger
than a <HI>Dutch Skelling;</HI> and yet I saw several
Persons who hit at every Shoot, tho' they stood
100 Paces off.</P>
<P>In our return to <HI>Galata</HI> we pass'd by <HI>Sancta So∣phia,</HI>
which is at present the principal <HI>Mosque</HI> of
the City. There are several Doors that lead into
a Portico, which brought us immediately into the
Mosque. 'Tis 120 Paces long, and 80 broad: The
Walls are Square, but the Vault or Roof is Round,
and so artificially contriv'd, that so large a Stru∣cture
is supported without any Columns; for those
Rows of Columns that form the two lower Por∣tico's,
serve only for Ornament, and are so plac'd
that they cannot be suppos'd to carry any other
weight than that of two Galleries; and even the
greatest part of these Columns are so old, that they
are forc'd to bind 'em about with great Iron Hoops,
to prevent their falling. I know not what cou'd
occasion all those Chinks that are observ'd in 'em,
for they are built of a very hard and polish'd Stone,
which some think is a kind of Marble, tho' others
believe it to be the <HI>Serpentine Stone.</HI> There are
thirty on each side, about sixteen Foot high, with
very fine Cornices: The Vault of the Mosque re∣tains
almost all its ancient Beauty; 'tis enrich'd
with a very fine <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work, consisting of little
gilt Stones so exactly join'd together, that they
remain almost perfectly entire after so many Ages.</P>
<P>At the four Corners of the Building where the
Vault begins to be round, the <HI>four Beasts</HI> mention'd
<PB N="154" REF="96"/>
in the <HI>Apocalyps,</HI> are painted in <HI>Mosaick;</HI> only the
<HI>Turks</HI> have disfigur'd their Faces, as they have al∣so
done to an Image of <HI>Our Saviour,</HI> which is over
the principal Door, represented after the <HI>Greek</HI>
Fashion, upon a Throne, with his Hand lifted,
and two of his Fingers stretch'd out, to bless a
<HI>Saint,</HI> who lies prostrate before him, with his Face on
the Ground, the <HI>Virgin</HI> appearing on the other side.
Over the same Door there is also a <HI>Basso-Relievo,</HI>
representing the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> in the form of a <HI>Dove,</HI>
which the <HI>Turks</HI> have not in the least disfigur'd.
The Tomb of <HI>Constantine</HI> remains also intire, which
the <HI>Turks</HI> hold in great Veneration; as well as the
Stone on which the <HI>Virgin</HI> wash'd <HI>Our Saviour's</HI>
Linnen. This Temple is pav'd with very fine
Marble, and the Floor is cover'd with Mats; not
to keep it from being foil'd, for they always put
off their <HI>Babouche's,</HI> or Shooes, before they enter;
but by reason of the coldness of the Marble, which
might incommode those who come to perform their
Devotions in this place, especially since they kneel
or crouch down, almost after the same manner as
they sit upon their <HI>Sopha's.</HI> The Keeper of the
Temple was easily brib'd to permit me to satisfie
my Curiosity with a distinct view of all the Cu∣riosities
I have describ'd: But these Officers are
not always in so good a Humour; for sometimes
they are very civil, and soon prevail'd with to ad∣mit
a Stranger into the Temple; but at other
times they are so Surly and Obstinate, that one
can hardly procure that Satisfaction at the rate of
ten Pistoles. 'Tis true, indeed, they are expresly
forbidden to grant that favour to <HI>Christians;</HI> and
the permission which is sometimes given to <HI>Franks,</HI>
is only an effect of their Indulgence: For if a
<HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Iew</HI> were found in the <HI>Mosque,</HI> he wou'd
either be immediately put to Death, or constrain'd
to save his Life by renouncing his Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="96"/>
<HI>Sophia</HI> is a <HI>Greek</HI> Word, signifying <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and
this Temple was so call'd by the Emperor <HI>Ju∣stinian,</HI>
who consecrated it to the <HI>Sovereign Wis∣dom.</HI>
I shall briefly acquaint you with the Histo∣ry
of its Foundation, as I had it from the <HI>Greeks.</HI>
You may depend upon the fidelity of my Relati∣on;
but I dare not undertake to justifie the Cre∣dit
of my Authors.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Iustinian</HI> being dangerously sick, his
Physician, call'd <HI>Samson,</HI> whose Mind was no less
enlighten'd by the Inspirations of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI>
than by the Knowledge of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> and of the
Art which he profess'd, told him, that his Distem∣per
was of such a Nature, that it cou'd not be
cur'd by the Precepts of Physick, and that he must
depend wholly upon the Assistance of Heaven,
advising him to make some Religious Vows, and
encouraging him with some Assurances that God
wou'd hear his Prayer. The Devout Prince cheer∣fully
embrac'd his Counsel, and vow'd to build a
Temple which shou'd surpass all the Churches of
the World in Magnificence. God was pleas'd with
the sincerity of his Devotion; he rewarded his
Faith, and rescu'd him from the Jaws of Death:
Nor was <HI>Iustinian</HI> unmindful of his Duty to his
Gracious Deliverer. In order to the performanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of his Vow, he fram'd the Model of the Church
of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> such as 'tis at present, and em∣ploy'd
a vast Number of Workmen on the intend∣ed
Building: But he had the Misfortune to see all
his Treasures exhausted before the third part of
the Work was compleated; so that he cou'd nei∣ther
prosecute his Design, nor so much as pay 50
Days Wages which he ow'd to the Workmen;
for <HI>Christian</HI> Emperors had not then assum'd the
power of imposing Taxes on their Subjects, with∣out
an indispensable Necessity. He was so over∣come
with Sorrow when he saw that he cou'd
<PB N="156" REF="97"/>
neither finish so pious a Work, nor, do Justice to
the poor Men whom he had imploy'd, that he
burst forth into Tears, and retir'd to his Closet,
where he was breathing out his Complaints in the
presence of his God; when a sudden Light shone
thro' the Room, and discover'd a Youth of in∣comparable
Beauty, who assur'd the sorrowful Em∣perour
that God had seen his Tears, and heard his
Prayers, and told him that he might quickly be happy
if he wou'd send some of his Servants and 50 Camels
along with him. <HI>Justinian's</HI> Heart was fill'd with
Joy at the hearing of such welcome and unex∣pected
Tidings: He commanded twenty of his Ser∣vants,
with fifty Camels, to attend the bright Mes∣senger,
who carry'd 'em out of <HI>Constantinople</HI> to a
Field, where they found a stately Palace, tho'
there was never any Building seen in that place
either before or since. The Beauteous Youth, or
rather Angel, (for so it seems he was) open'd the
Gates of this Magnificent Structure, and led 'em to
a Hall, where they saw vast Heaps of Gold, Sil∣ver,
and all sorts of Jewels: He orderd 'em to
load their Camels; and then both he and the Pa∣lace
disappear'd, only the Treasure remain'd, which
the Emperor receiv'd with all the Marks of a joy∣ful
Gratitude, and employ'd it in building and
adorning the Church of <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> in so admi∣rable
a manner, that the <HI>Temple of Solomon</HI> in its
highest Glory, was neither more Beautiful nor Mag∣nificent.
He built also with the same Money a
large and stately <HI>Hospital,</HI> where Persons of all
Nations were charitably entertain'd. And since
there was still a great quantity of Treasure left,
which the Emperor's Piety wou'd not suffer him
to employ in prophane Uses, he order'd the Jew∣els
to be samp'd to Powder, and the Gold and
Silver to be melted, and mixing 'em all together,
he made the most precious Table that ever adorn'd
<PB N="157" REF="97"/>
a Temple, and plac'd it on the High Altar, to
serve at the daily Consecration of the Sacrament,
where it remain'd till the <HI>Venetians</HI> carry'd it away
with those admirable Brazen Gates, which are at
present to be seen at S. <HI>Mark's.</HI> But God wou'd
not suffer so Holy a Piece to become a Prey to
those who cou'd not pretend any right to it;
the Galley that carry'd it open'd miraculously at
the Mouth of the Canal, in the Sea of <HI>Marmora,</HI>
where it sunk, and was never afterwards found.</P>
<P>This, Sir, (if you have Faith enough to believe
it) is the Original of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> which was for∣merly
a <HI>Christian Church,</HI> and is now a <HI>Turkish Mos∣quee.</HI>
'Tis at present the only Ancient Structure
of that Nature in <HI>Constantinople;</HI> for all the rest
were built in this and the last Age, by the <HI>Sul∣tans</HI>
or <HI>Sultanesses,</HI> whose Names they bear. There
are seven or eight particularly remarkable, I mean
those of the <HI>Sultans Mahomet, Achmet, Solyman,</HI> and
<HI>Selim,</HI> with those of <HI>Chazadet,</HI> and <HI>Validé,</HI> and some
others, built after the same Model, and differing
only in the largeness of the Structure, the Num∣ber
of the Fountains, and variety of the Painting;
so that the Description of one will give a just
<HI>Idea</HI> of all the rest, and therefore I shall make
choice of that of <HI>Valide,</HI> which is the newest and
most beautiful Mosque I have yet seen: 'Twas
built by the <HI>Sultaness Validé,</HI> Mother of <HI>Sultan Ma∣homet</HI>
IV. and is seated in the midst of a large
square Court, resembling a vast Cloyster, because
of the arch'd Roofs that inviron it in form of
Portico's; under which there are many Fountains
with Cocks, where those who are polluted may
wash themselves before they enter the Mosquee.
It has but one Gate, surrounded with a Portico
of a considerable height, pav'd with white and
black Marble, and supported by sixty four Co∣lumns
of red Marble, eight of which are of Por∣phyrie,
<PB N="158" REF="98"/>
plac'd near the Entry, but of no very re∣gular
Design, because the bigness of the Pieces is pre∣serv'd
entire: The Plafond is adorn'd with Paint∣ing
and Figures, after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner, of which
afterwards you may expect a more particular Ac∣count.
The Portico is cover'd with little Domes,
with a very large one in the middle, over-topping
the rest; the whole Structure consisting of Ma∣son's-Work
cover'd with Lead. At the four Cor∣ners
of the Building there are four Turrets, call'd
<HI>Minarets,</HI> built of Free-Stone, and so small that
there is just room enough within for a little Winding-Stair-case,
reaching to three fourth parts of the
Height, which the <HI>Muezans,</HI> or <HI>Marabouds,</HI> ascend
every Morning and Evening, to give the People
notice of the appointed times of Prayer, shouting
till they are out of Breath, with an extremely
harsh and disagreeable Tone; for they begin with
a very low Voice, and raising it by degrees, end
in a very loud Shriek, so that 'twou'd be impos∣sible
to understand 'em, if the People were not
already acquainted with what they say. As they
cry, they clap their Hands upon their Ears, and
go round the Turret in a little Balcony, that their
Voice may be heard thro' the whole Town, re∣peating
these Words; <HI>Allah ekber, allah ekber, allah
ekber, eschadou in la illah, illallah, hi alle salla, hi alle
salla, allah ekber, allah ekber, allah ekber, la illah, illal∣lah.
God is Great, God is Great, God is Great; give
testimony that there is but One God: Come yield your
selves up to his Mercy, and pray him to forgive you
your Sins. God is Great, God is Great, God is Great,
there is no other God but God.</HI> These Turrets are very
high, and for the most part end in a Globe or Cre∣scent,
which is sometimes Gilt. This is a brief
Representation of the external Architecture of <HI>Va∣lid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
and consequently of the other Mosquees.
Within they are either vaulted, or cover'd with a
<PB N="159" REF="98"/>
Plafond: That of <HI>Validé</HI> is vaulted, and adorn'd
with a great Number of Lamps, and Globes of
Glass. When they say Prayers, they turn their
Face towards a large Frame at the end of the
Mosque, in the same place where the High-Al∣tar
stands in <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Churches. There is
no Figure represented on this Frame or Table,
only the Name of GOD is written on it in <HI>Ara∣bick</HI>
Characters; and over-against it stands two
Brazen Candlesticks, with a Taper of Virgin-Wax
in each, bigger than a Man's Thigh. In the Mos∣quees
that are founded by Emperôrs, there is u∣sually
a <HI>Turbé,</HI> or little Chappel, in which they are
bury'd. Some <HI>Sultans</HI> have built <HI>Turbe's</HI> apart, re∣sembling
little Mosquees. Those of <HI>Amurat</HI> and
<HI>Solyman</HI> I. are thè finest: The Body of the last
lies in a Coffin, like those that are us'd in <HI>France,</HI>
cover'd with a large piece of Tapistry, with a
Turbant on his Head, in which there are two fine
<HI>Aigrets.</HI> In the <HI>Turbé</HI> of <HI>Amurat</HI> there are Ele∣ven
of his Children plac'd round him, with two
of his Wives; and at the Head of the Coffin
there is a little Cupboard or Press, where his Pra∣yer-Books
are kept, which, are adorn'd with
Gold and Precious-Stones, appearing thro' a Lat∣ten
Grate, and all <HI>Mussulmen</HI> are permitted to read
there, for the Repose of the Souls of the deceas'd.
The Keepers of the <HI>Turbé</HI> are also oblig'd to pray
for 'em at certain Hours of the Day. This Sepul∣chre
is not very magnificent.</P>
<P>Having seen all the above-mention'd places, we
return'd to <HI>Galata,</HI> resolving to spend another Day
in visiting the rest of the Curiosities at <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
which will furnish me with Matter for another
Letter. In the mean time I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere are so few Palaces or other remarkable
Buildings in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that in two Days
I compleated my Walk thro' the City; and the
Observations I made are so inconsiderable, that I
shall easily be able to finish, in this Letter, the De∣scription
which I began in the last.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Signior▪s Arsenal</HI> is at the End of the
Port, beyond <HI>Cassum Pacha</HI> and <HI>Galata.</HI> I found the
Building better than I expected, after what I had
seen in the rest of the City; and besides, it con∣tains
a considerable extent of Ground: The Gal∣leys
are laid up under 120 Arches, and 'tis said
there are Arms in it for 60000 Men. But the
Magazins are inaccessible to <HI>Christians,</HI> and they are
only permitted to see the Baths where the <HI>Sultan's</HI>
Slaves are shut up; the Number of these Wretches
amounts to several Thousands; and their Lodgings
are so miserable, that I repented the Curiosity
that engag'd me in so unpleasant a Visit. The <HI>Cap∣tain
Bassa</HI> lives in the <HI>Arsenal,</HI> with all the Officers
of the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> that they may be always ready
upon the Spot to receive his Orders.</P>
<P><HI>Constantinople</HI> is full of certain Houses, which the
Poverty and ill Customs of the place have render'd
necessary, I mean the <HI>Hans</HI> and <HI>Karavanseraïs.</HI>
The <HI>Hans</HI> consist of four Sides of Building, enclo∣sing
a large square Court, in which there is al∣ways
a Fountain, either in the midst, or in some
other part of it. The Walls are very strong, and
the Windows well barr'd, to secure the Goods that
are laid in the Ware-Houses. The Roof consists
<PB N="161" REF="99"/>
of little Domes cover'd with Lead, like those of the
Mosquees. These Houses are appointed for the En∣tertainment
of Foreign Merchants: They contain
only two Stories, divided into Rooms, which have
not the least Communication with one another.
The lower Story is compos'd of Ware-Houses for
the Goods, and the upper is divided into little
Chambers, where the Merchants Lodge, but they
must take care to furnish themselves with Beds, Pots,
Dishes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for they are only accommodated here
with four bare Walls; and after they have provided
their Furniture, they must buy their Meat at the
Market or <HI>Bazar,</HI> and Dress it themselves, since o∣therwise
they might starve with their Pockets full
of Money. And, in the general, the way of Tra∣velling
in this Country is so inconvenient and trou∣blesome,
that this Consideration alone may serve to
discourage any Man that loves his Ease from visit∣ing
it out of pure Curiosity. For in the first place you
must neither expect Coach, Waggon, Boat, Horses,
nor any other convenient Carriage. If your Affairs
oblige you to undertake a Journey, tho' not above 100
Leagues, you must wait three Months for a <HI>Caravan,</HI>
which, after all, will not Travel above four Leagues
a day, and carry no other Provisions but Rice,
Bisket, and Salt Beef, on which you must make a
shift to live, and encamp every Night till you ar∣rive
at your Journies end, where, if you have not
the conveniency of Lodging with a particular Friend,
'twill be in vain to enquire for the <HI>King's-Head,</HI> the
<HI>White-Cross,</HI> or the <HI>Golden-Lyon:</HI> You must e'en creep
into a <HI>Han</HI> with a hundred Wretches, whose Bru∣tishness
is altogether insupportable, and reckon your
self happy when ye can find such a Lodging,
which, after all, is better than Encamping with the
<HI>Caravan.</HI></P>
<P>You will, perhaps, think it impossible to represent
a more frightful Idea of Travelling; but I can assure
<PB N="162" REF="100"/>
you, that all these Inconveniencies are not compa∣rable
to those which they who Travel to <HI>Persia,</HI> or
cross the Desarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> must resolve to undergo.
They must Travel six Months together expos'd to all
the Inconveniencies of bad Weather, and for the
most part in burning Sand, where there is neither
a Stalk of Grass, nor a Spring to quench their
Thirst. Besides, they are perpetually in danger of
being surpriz'd by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who rob and kill all
that come in their way. But all these Incommodi∣ties
may be either more easily avoided or supported
than those terrible Distempers that usually seize <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
Travellers, who are not accustom'd to such
hot Climates and fatiguing Journeys. I shall take
this occasion to relate a Story of one of my Friends
who return'd, not long ago, from <HI>Poland,</HI> whither
he went about the beginning of the last Year by
the King's Order, in the quality of an Interpreter
with Monsieur <HI>de Chateauneuf's</HI> Chancellor, call'd
<HI>Beauchesne.</HI> He was seiz'd by the way with a vio∣lent
Fever and Looseness, which brought him so
low, and made him so troublesome to the <HI>Caravan-Bachi,</HI>
or Captain of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> that his Com∣panions
wou'd have left him to perish without assi∣stance,
if that Officer had not been afraid to run
the hazard of offending the Ambassador; yet he
assur'd me that all their respect to Monsieur <HI>Chateau∣neuf</HI>
cou'd not have protected him, if the Fever had
seiz'd on his Head, and so made him incapable of
sitting on Horseback. But these are not the only
disadvantages which Travellers suffer in this Coun∣try;
they are expos'd to a thousand other vexatious
Accidents, and are constantly plagu'd with the
Brutish Humours of the <HI>Camel-drivers.</HI> We are
wont to complain of the Sawciness of Carriers and
Coach-men; but I assure you they wou'd be reckon'd
very mild and tractable in this Country, where
every <HI>Camel-driver</HI> is as haughty as a Lord, and the
<PB N="163" REF="100"/>
poor Traveller must keep in his Post under pain of
a <HI>Bastanado,</HI> which he must take very patiently, for
if he shou'd offer to return the Blow, I wou'd not
ensure his Life for all the Money in the <HI>Caravan.</HI></P>
<P>I thought my self oblig'd to give you a faithful
Account of all these Inconveniencies, which most
Travellers study to conceal; that, if any of your
Friends have a mind to undertake the same Voyage,
they may at least have the advantage of knowing
what they are to expect, which they cou'd not have
done if I had only given you a view of the pleasant
and bright side of a Traveller's Entertainment. For
my part, I must confess I had so strong an Inclina∣tion
to <HI>Travelling,</HI> that I know not whether I shou'd
have stopt on this side <HI>China,</HI> if I had not met with
so many discouraging Rubs: But my Curiosity is
wonderfully abated of late, and I'm so perfectly
cur'd of my gadding Humor, that I'm resolv'd to
confine my self hereafter to <HI>Europe,</HI> and to Travel
only in such Places where I may find, at least, a
piece of <HI>Beef,</HI> and a pair of clean <HI>Sheets</HI> at Night.</P>
<P>Since I had occasion to mention <HI>Beauchesne's</HI> Jour∣ney
to <HI>Poland,</HI> 'twill not be improper to give you a
short account of the cause of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> being informed of the great Losses
which the <HI>French</HI> sustain'd during the Campaign of
1689. and of the ill-fortune that attended His Ma∣jesty's
Arms in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Mareschal <HI>D' Hu∣miere</HI>
was unsuccessful in the only attempt he made,
began to give less credit to the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador's
smooth Harangues, and to desire a Peace with the
Emperour. The Grand Visier spoke of it several
times to Sir <HI>William Trumbal</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Collier,</HI>
the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadors, and sent Orders
to His Master's Envoys at <HI>Vienna</HI> to hasten the desir'd
Accommodation. And certainly the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>
had reason to wish for a Peace, for his Affairs were
in a very hopeless condition. At the beginning of
<PB N="164" REF="101"/>
the Campaign his Troops suffer'd a considerable dis∣advantage
in <HI>Croatia,</HI> where they lost above 2000
Men, with several Ensigns, and the Bassa who Com∣manded
'em. The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> afterwards
Routed 'em thrice in three memorable Battels, and
they saw themselves expos'd to all the Insults of the
Imperialists, who talk'd of nothing less than of Be∣sieging
<HI>Constantinople. Temeswaer, Canissa,</HI> and <HI>Wara∣din,</HI>
the only places they possest in <HI>Hungary,</HI> were
closely Block'd up without any hope of Relief.
Thus 'twas plainly the Interest of the <HI>Turks</HI> to ac∣cept
of the Proposals that were made by their Vi∣ctorious
Enemies: But the King's Interest was on
this occasion directly opposite to that of his Allies.
He dreaded the fatal consequences of such a Reso∣lution
and left no means unessay'd to prevent its
taking effect. He cajol'd the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> more
than ever, and flatter'd him with the hope of ma∣king
a separate Peace with the <HI>Polanders,</HI> since they
had already enter'd into a Negotiation with the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> and had sent Deputies for that effect to
Count <HI>Tekeli,</HI> who was to perform the Office of a
Mediator between 'em. This Stratagem produc'd
the desir'd effect, and the <HI>Turk</HI> was the more easily
deluded, because he knew that not long before there
happen'd a sort of Quarrel between the Courts of
<HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Vienna.</HI> For the Emperor had granted
his Protection to the <HI>Moldavians,</HI> and on that score
was to receive the same Tribute which they for∣merly
paid to the <HI>Turks.</HI> The King of <HI>Poland</HI> pre∣tended
a right to that Province, as an ancient Fief
of his Crown: But the Emperor wou'd not give
him any satisfaction, and even refus'd to answer the
<HI>Polish</HI> Ambassador's Remonstrances on that subject.
In the mean time the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Ambassadors
at the Court of <HI>Poland,</HI> were not idle Spectators of
so favourable a Juncture, they endeavour'd to fo∣ment
the difference, and <HI>Beauchesne</HI> was dispatch'd
<PB N="165" REF="101"/>
thither with several Instructions both from the King
his Master, and from the <HI>Grand Visier.</HI> But all their
Negotiations were unsuccessful, for they cou'd not
prevail with the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to break his Con∣federacy
with the Emperor.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with an Apology for the
length of this digression, into which the way of
Travelling in <HI>Turkey</HI> has insensibly engag'd me.
For since at the beginning of our Correspondence
I resolv'd to entertain you from time to time with
a familiar account, not only of my own Observa∣tions,
but of what I shou'd learn from others; I
see no reason why the prosecution of that design
shou'd oblige me to a nice observance of an exact
and regular Method.</P>
<P>I have already told you, that there are two sorts
of <HI>Public Houses</HI> in <HI>Constantinople;</HI> the <HI>Hans,</HI> and the
<HI>Karavanseraïs:</HI> And I shall take this occasion to add
a short description of the <HI>Second</HI> to the larger account
I gave you of the <HI>First.</HI></P>
<P>They are both built after the same manner, only
the <HI>Hans</HI> are enclos'd with good thick Walls, where∣as
the Stone-work in the <HI>Karavanseraïs</HI> reaches no
higher than the first or lower Story, the second be∣ing
built of Wood, and cover'd with Bricks. They
have only one Gate, as well as the <HI>Hans,</HI> and serve
to lodge poor Strangers, and the Servants of the
<HI>Caravans;</HI> for which reason they are call'd <HI>Kara∣vanseraï,</HI>
or the Houses of the <HI>Caravans.</HI> All Indi∣gent
Persons resort to 'em, paying from half a
Crown, to a Crown a Month, according to the
fineness of the House, or the advantages of its
Situation.</P>
<P>After we had taken a slight view of several of
these Houses, we went to the <HI>Grand Signior's Seraglio,</HI>
which I cannot describe exactly, since I was not
suffer'd to go further than the second Court, tho'
I was accompany'd by an <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Janisaries,</HI> to
<PB N="166" REF="102"/>
whom I had been effectually recommended, and
without whose assistance I must have contented my
self with a view of the first. The <HI>Seraglio</HI> is built
on a Point of Land that juts out into the Sea,
which I had occasion to mention when I describ'd
the situation of the City. 'Tis surrounded with
high Walls of a greyish Stone, with a Parapet at
the top, and Battlements like those of the City. It
contains a vast extent of Ground, almost four Miles
in compass, the greatest part of which is taken up
with Gardens. The Structure is irregular, and very
unsutable to the boasted Magnificence of its Master:
For 'tis only a vast heap of Buildings not unlike to
some old Castles in <HI>Christendom;</HI> and you see no∣thing
on the outside but a confus'd medley of
Houses, adorn'd with those little gilt Spires and Globes
I mention'd in my last, in which all its Beauty con∣sists.
The rest of the Building is so mean, that a
Man wou'd never imagine it to be the <HI>Seraglio,</HI>
that admir'd Palace of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> The prin∣cipal
Entry is near <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> and exactly re∣sembles
the Gate of an old paltry Town, without
either Architecture or Ornament: Yet 'tis carefully
guarded by the <HI>Capigi,</HI> who keep their Court of
Guard under it, and sit on Benches of Stone. This
Gate led us into a large Court, where on the right
hand we observ'd the Apartments for the Sick, with
large Matted <HI>Sopha</HI>'s along the Walls, where the
Diseas'd Persons are plac'd, and lodg'd as poorly as
if they were in a Hospital. On the left hand are
Magazines containing Arms for a Thousand Men,
that in case of necessity the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> may arm
his Domestic Servants for the security of his Person.
But notwithstanding this Precaution, <HI>Ibrahim</HI> was
Strangled, <HI>Mahomet</HI> Dethron'd, and <HI>Solyman</HI> Poi∣son'd,
not to mention the Tragical Ends of so ma∣ny
other Princes of the same Line, whose Guards
cou'd not protect 'em from the fury of a Seditious
<PB N="167" REF="102"/>
Multitude. From this Court we pass'd into ano∣ther,
border'd with two large Portico's. The <HI>Grand
Signior's</HI> Kitchens are on one side, which are not
kept very hot at present, since he chuses to reside at
<HI>Adrianople:</HI> Yet I observ'd some Persons preparing
<HI>Pilo, Pasties,</HI> and <HI>Fish,</HI> for the Women in the old <HI>Se∣raglio.</HI>
On the other Side are the Stables, where
there is Room and Accommodation for a hundred
Horses. If your Curiosity be not satisfy'd with so
imperfect an Account of so famous a Place, you
must consult those who were permitted to enter
farther.</P>
<P>Very near this <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and within the same En∣closure,
there is another Edifice, commonly call'd
<HI>The Old Seraglio.</HI> 'Twas erected by one who was no
Lover of ill-contriv'd Structures, I mean <HI>Constantine
the Great;</HI> and yet 'tis certainly a very ugly Mass
of Building, surrounded with Walls of an unusual
Heighth, without any Windows on the Outside. I
will not undertake to justifie the Design of the
Founder, tho' we may be allow'd to suppose that
he had some secret Reasons for contriving it after
this Manner. Besides I only saw the Back of it,
and perhaps the Front may be more regularly built.
Here the reigning <HI>Sultan</HI> shuts up the Wives of his
Predecessours, who at their Entrance into this
Place may bid adieu to all the Pleasures of this
Life.</P>
<P>The present <HI>Sultan's</HI> Wives are lodg'd in a Third
<HI>Seraglio,</HI> which is join'd so close to that of the <HI>Grand
Signior,</HI> that he may pass from one to the other with∣out
exposing himself to the Rain. I need not tell you
with what severity they are guarded by the white and
black Eunuchs, who never permit 'em to enjoy the
least Shadow of Liberty. All the Relations of Tra∣vellers
are full of Stories and Reflexions on this Sub∣ject,
and therefore instead of repeating the Obser∣vations
of others, I shall only add, that 'tis a Capi∣tal
<PB N="168" REF="103"/>
Crime to look upon one of these Women. I saw
a <HI>Turk</HI> at <HI>Galata</HI> whose Father was strangl'd for so
dangerous a piece of Curiosity, under the Reign of
<HI>Amurath,</HI> whose Memory will not be easily forgot∣ten
in the Places that were subject to his Dominion;
for he was certainly one of the severest and most vi∣gilant
Princes in the World. 'Twas his daily Cu∣stom
to walk in Disguise thro' the City, that he
might be an Eye-witness of the Care that was ta∣ken
to put the Laws in Execution; and he seldom
or never walk'd the Rounds without leaving some
headless Monuments of his Justice: besides he fre∣quently
observ'd what was done in the City from
his <HI>Seraglio,</HI> by the help of some excellent Prospe∣ctive-Glasses,
with which the <HI>Venetians</HI> had presented
him. One day as he was making his usual. Observations,
he perceiv'd a Man in <HI>Pera,</HI> who had also a Prospe∣ctive-Glass,
and was viewing the <HI>Sultanesses,</HI> who
were walking in the Garden. Immediately he call'd
a <HI>Capigi,</HI> and commanded him to go with four
<HI>Mutes</HI> to such a House, and hang a Man, whom
he describ'd, at the Window; which the <HI>Capigi</HI> ex∣ecuted,
and <HI>Amurath</HI> saw him and was satis∣fy'd.</P>
<P>From the Account I have given you of the <HI>Sul∣tan</HI>'s
Palace, you may reasonably conclude that the
great Officers of the Empire are but meanly lodg'd.
Most of their Houses are inclos'd in a kind of Park,
which contains a Garden, and a large Court bor∣der'd
with Stables on one side, and Kitchens on the
other. The finest I have yet seen is that of <HI>Haly
Bassa, Kaimacan</HI> of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> whither I attended
the Ambassadour, when he receiv'd the first Audi∣ence
of that Minister, which was perform'd with
the following Ceremonies.</P>
<P>First march'd sixteen <HI>Livery-Men,</HI> in Red Coats,
with a broad Gold Galoon on the Seams, the <HI>Steward</HI>
walking before 'em. They were follow'd by the

<PB N="169" REF="104"/>
<HI>Valets de Chambre, Cooks, Clerks</HI> of the <HI>Office,</HI> and
<HI>Commissaries</HI> of the <HI>Chancery.</HI> After 'em walk'd six
<HI>Interpreters,</HI> follow'd by as many <HI>Janisaries;</HI> and at
last came the <HI>Ambassadour,</HI> accompany'd with his <HI>Se∣cretary,</HI>
and <HI>Chancellour,</HI> the most considerable Persons
of the Nation marching some Paces after him. In
this Order he walk'd to <HI>Tophana,</HI> where he embark'd
with all his Train, the <HI>Kaimacan</HI> having sent Boats
to attend him, and a very fine gilt one for himself,
with twelve Rowers. There were a considerable
number of <HI>French</HI> Vessels in the Port, who saluted
him with all their Guns. At his Arrival on the o∣ther
side he found his Led-Horses very richly har∣nass'd,
with Silver Bridles, and Embroider'd Foot-Cloths
trailing on the Ground. Immediately he
mounted his Horse, and all his Attendants falling in∣to
the same Order, as before, he rode thro' the City
to the <HI>Kaimacan</HI>'s House, who sent his <HI>Kiaia,</HI> to re∣ceive
him at the Foot of the Stairs, accompany'd
with two other Officers, who led him under the
Arms to the Chamber of Audience, where there
was a kind of Chair with a Back, plac'd for him on the
<HI>Sopha:</HI> Immediately after the <HI>Kaimacan</HI> enter'd, and
sate down upon the <HI>Sopha</HI> over-against him. At first
the Discourse was only general; but after some
Compliments to the <HI>Kaimacan</HI> on his late Promoti∣on,
they began to talk of the present Posture of
Affairs: and that Minister insisted very long on the
<HI>Grand Visier</HI>'s happy Success in <HI>Hungary,</HI> informing
the Ambassadour, that in less than two Months he
made himself Master of the Cities of <HI>Nissa, Widin,
Semendria,</HI> and <HI>Belgrade</HI> it self, which he took by
Storm after a Siege of eight Days, and put the
whole Garrison to the Sword, except 300 Men who
made their Escape. He related also the particular
Circumstances of Count <HI>Tekeli</HI>'s Engagement with
4000 <HI>Transylvanians,</HI> who were entirely routed,
scarce 200 of 'em escaping, and General <HI>Heuster</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="105"/>
himself being taken Prisoner. The Ambassadour
receiv'd this agreeable News with the highest Marks
of Joy, and reply'd in these very Words, <HI>That it
seem'd there was a Sympathy between the two Empires,
since while the Emperour his Master was triumphing over
their common Enemies beyond the</HI> Rhine, <HI>he had the Plea∣sure
to be inform'd of the Glorious Success of his High∣ness's
Arms in</HI> Hungary; adding, <HI>That this was cer∣tainly
an Effect of that entire Correspondence which had
united the two Empires for so long and uninterrupted a
Series of Years.</HI> The <HI>Kaimacan</HI> answer'd, <HI>That he had
taken delight in making the same Observation, and that
he lookt upon it as a happy Presage.</HI> Then the <HI>Am∣bassadour</HI>
took occasion to intreat him <HI>to employ all
his Interest for the Establishment and Confirmation of an
Union that was of such high Importance for the Happi∣ness
of both the Empires; for 'tis plain,</HI> said he, <HI>that the
Interests of both our Emperours are the same. They can∣not
break the Union that links 'em together, without
weakening themselves: and it ought to be acknowledg'd
as a Fundamental Maxim, That the Grandeur of the
Emperour my Master confirms that of his Highness, which
reciprocally contributes to the Glory and Safety of my Em∣perour.</HI>
The <HI>Kaimacan</HI> reply'd as one who was of
the same Opinion; he spoke several times of an
<HI>Alliance</HI> between the two Emperours, adding, That
<HI>'twou'd not be the first time the</HI> Ottoman <HI>and</HI> French
<HI>Armies had carry'd on the same Design, and even obey'd
the same Orders.</HI> But the <HI>Ambassadour</HI> declin'd to re∣turn
a positive Answer, because he could not rely
upon the Fidelity of all that were present, and
perhaps I was one of those whom he doubted
most, for they begin already to suspect my <HI>Catho∣licism.</HI></P>
<P>Then putting some odoriferous Matter into a
Censer, they perfum'd his Head and Cloaths, hold∣ing
a large Cloth or Napkin above him to keep the
Fumes from evaporating. After this Ceremony was
<PB N="171" REF="105"/>
over, they brought <HI>Coffee, Sherbet,</HI> and at last the
usual Presents, consisting of <HI>Twenty five Vests,</HI> which
were laid before the <HI>Kaimacan.</HI> The first was for
the <HI>Ambassadour,</HI> and the rest for his twenty four <HI>At∣tendants,</HI>
who were call'd in Order by his <HI>Steward.</HI></P>
<P>According as our Names were call'd, we stept
forwards to receive the <HI>Vests</HI> from one of the <HI>Kai∣macan</HI>'s
Officers, who first spread it before the <HI>Am∣bassadour,</HI>
and then put it on our Shoulders. These
Vests are such inconsiderable Trifles, that the pre∣senting
of 'em seems rather an Affront than a Mark
of Esteem; for they are not worth above three
<HI>Half-Crowns</HI> a-piece. They are made of <HI>Cotton,</HI>
branch'd with a little <HI>Silk</HI> of several Colours, after
a very odd and phantastical Manner. The <HI>Ambassa∣dour</HI>'s
was not finer than the rest, only spangl'd here
and there with a little paltry <HI>Gold.</HI> I'm inform'd
that this Custom of presenting <HI>Vests</HI> is an usual Ce∣remony
among the <HI>Turks,</HI> proceeding from their
extream Desire of Presents, which is the usual Foun∣dation
of their Kindness and Affection: for 'twou'd
be reckon'd as ridiculous, as 'tis in vain, to endea∣vour
to acquire their Friendship, or convince 'em of
the Sincerity of our Love by Protestations and other
Marks of Affection, if they be not accompany'd
with Presents. I can assure you that all my <HI>Turkish</HI>
Acquaintances are of the same Humour: and this
Custom prevails so universally that every one is ob∣lig'd
to comply with it.</P>
<P>After we had receiv'd our Vests, his <HI>Excellency</HI> re∣tir'd
with the <HI>Kaimacan</HI> to a private Chamber, to
discourse of secret Affairs. In the mean time we
had leisure to view the Apartments of the House,
which were all open'd to us; tho' we might have
contented our selves with the Sight of one, since
there is no difference between 'em; and therefore
'twill be an easie Task to gratifie your Curiosity
with a Description of 'em. You must not expect
<PB N="172" REF="106"/>
a long Catalogue of rare Pictures, magnificent Beds,
large Looking-Glasses, silver Tables, curious Hang∣ings,
and other rich Furniture: for there are no
such Ornaments in the House. Four bare Walls,
a <HI>Plafond</HI> or Cieling, and a <HI>Sopha</HI> are all the Riches
and all the Beauty of their Rooms. 'Tis true their
Plafonds are very fine, and painted all over with
<HI>Cochineel, Gold,</HI> and <HI>Azure:</HI> their way of designing
is peculiar to themselves, but its Oddness does not
make it less pleasant; 'Tis a kind of <HI>Moresco,</HI> the
Figures entering into one another, and appearing
the same on all sides; and it must be acknowledg'd
that the <HI>Turks</HI> have very fruitful Inventions, for, I
believe, there are a Million of several Sorts of Fi∣gures.
The middle of the Plafond is usually richer
than the rest, both in Gilding and Painting; but
'tis impossible to make you comprehend either of
'em, unless you had seen something of a like Na∣ture,
which, I believe, you never did, since there
is not one Room in <HI>France</HI> thus adorn'd. The Walls
are also cover'd with the same sort of Paint instead
of Hangings: and as for the <HI>Sopha,</HI> I cannot repre∣sent
it better than as a Bench about two Foot high,
reaching from one end of the Chamber to the
other, on the Side next the Street, under the Win∣dows,
which begin a Foot higher in the Wall: 'tis
always between ten and eleven Foot broad, and co∣ver'd
with <HI>Turkish</HI> or <HI>Persian</HI> Tapestry; besides which
there are Mats laid along the Wall, 4 or 5 foot broad,
cover'd with Cloth or Velvet, and over these there are
large Cushions, stuff'd with Hair or Wooll. These
Cushions in great Mens Houses are either curiously
embroider'd, or made of a rich Cloth of Gold: and
'tis here that the <HI>Turks</HI> sit night and day cross-legg'd
like Taylors, smoaking <HI>Tabacco,</HI> and drinking <HI>Coffee,</HI>
without any other Diversion than playing with
Shells, and sometimes a Game at <HI>Tric-trac,</HI> or the
<HI>Goose.</HI> But since I shall have occasion hereafter to
<PB N="173" REF="106"/>
speak of their Recreations, I shall at present only
give you an Account of their Houses.</P>
<P>While the Ambassadour was discoursing in private
with the <HI>Kaimacan,</HI> I went down to the Garden,
which is not above 100 Paces long, and 60 broad:
the Walks are gravell'd, border'd in some places
with Orange-Trees, and in others with Fruit-Trees.
The square Beds in the Garden are not cut and bor∣der'd
like our Flower-Plots, but only separated with
Divisions, and fill'd with Flowers, of which the
<HI>Turks</HI> are very curious. In the Middle there is a
pretty large Bason of Water, from the Centre
of which there rises a little Marble Spire, gilt
and painted after the <HI>Turkish</HI> Manner, and cast∣ing
forth Water thro' four Pipes. There are also
two other Basons at each End of the Garden,
which are more remarkable for the peculiar Odd∣ness
of their Structure, than for their Beauty. They
are fram'd almost like Centinels woodden Boxes,
only they are not quite so deep, and there is a kind
of Chapiter on the Top, adorn'd with Gilding and
Figures. The Inside is cut into the Form of Scal∣lop-Shells,
on which the Water falling makes a great
number of little Cascades that run into a Bason,
and form another large Cascade, the Water of
which is receiv'd into a Sort of Tub or Vat, and
from thence thro' several Holes, runs into little Ca∣nals
about the Breadth of four Fingers, cut out of
a large Marble Pavement that reaches from these
Fountains to the Bason in the Middle of the Gar∣den.
The Pavement was contriv'd on purpose for
the Conveniency of cutting out these little winding
Canals, which forming a vast number of regular
and very pleasant Figures, fall at last into the great
Bason. This, Sir, is the best Account I can give
you of the <HI>Kaimacan</HI>'s Garden, which may serve
for all the rest I have hitherto had occasion to see,
since there is no great Difference between 'em. As
<PB N="174" REF="107"/>
for the House, 'tis a great Mass of Building, the
Front consisting of a high and broad Stair-Case divi∣ded
by two Galleries that reach from one end of
the House to the other; and the whole is dawb'd
over very coarsly with a sort of Red and Green
Paint. Under the Stair-Case there is a large square
Gate, that leads into a Court surrounded with Gal∣leries
like the first, and supported with woodden
Pillars. Here the <HI>Kaimacan's</HI> Servants lodge,
whose number may amount to fifty or sixty, all
cloath'd after the same manner, with a <HI>Cafetan</HI> or
white Coat, that covers 'em from Head to Foot.
From thence I went to view the Stables, which in
this Country is usually the best furnish'd part of the
House; and in these I observ'd forty good Horses.
After I had satisfi'd my Curiosity with a View of
all that was remarkable below, I went up again to
my Companions, and sate drinking <HI>Sherbet,</HI> till the
<HI>Ambassadour</HI> came out. The <HI>Kiaia</HI> accompany'd
him to the Foot of the Stairs, where he receiv'd
him at his coming, with the same Officers that sup∣ported
him under the Arms; but the <HI>Kaimacan</HI>
came not out of his Chamber, which in my Opi∣nion
was a little too stately for a Person of his Cha∣racter.
The <HI>Ambassadour</HI> did not pull off his Hat,
either at his coming in or going out: not that he
slighted the <HI>Kaimacan,</HI> but out of pure Compliance
to the Manners of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who never uncover
their Heads before Persons for whom they have
the least Respect. I had forgot to tell you, that
when he enter'd the Chamber all the <HI>Kaimacan's</HI>
Servants bellow'd out thrice, <HI>Is alla Malec allec is
alla:</HI> and at his Departure he was saluted with ano∣ther
Hollow; which is the usual <HI>Welcome</HI> and <HI>Fare∣well</HI>
of the <HI>Turks</HI> to Persons whom they intend to
treat with particular Marks of Honour. I am,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY unexpected stay in this City has procur'd
me the splendid, or rather the mortifying
sight of <HI>Sultan Solyman</HI>'s Triumphant Entry into <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
at the end of so successful a Campaign.
The <HI>Turks</HI> are so puff'd up with the advantageous
Progress of their Arms this Summer, and both their
Contempt and Hatred of the Imperialists are so ex∣treamly
heighten'd that they look upon 'em as <HI>dead
Doggs,</HI> ripe for destruction, and flatter themselves
with the Chimerical Hope of seeing <HI>Vienna</HI> once a∣gain
Besieg'd the next Campaign. The sight of so
great a quantity of Booty which was brought from
<HI>Hungary,</HI> and is sold almost for nothing in this City,
has swoln their Pride to such a height, that they
usually treat Christians with intolerable Insolence,
except the <HI>French,</HI> whom they call their <HI>Friends</HI> and
<HI>Allies.</HI> When they accidentally meet a <HI>Frank,</HI> whom
they know not, their first Question is, <HI>What Country∣man
are you?</HI> and if he answers,</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I'm a <HI>French</HI>-man.</NOTE> <HI>Sono Francese,</HI> immediately they
embrace him, and patting him gent∣ly
on the Shoulder, reply,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">We are Brothers.</NOTE> <HI>Siamo
Fratelli.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this City have not seen these
many Years a more Magnificent Ceremony than the
late Entry of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> which was made in
the following Order: First march'd 200 <HI>Capigi,</HI> or
Keepers of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Gate, with tapering
Caps, and a Cone, or sharp-pointed piece of Cloth
hanging down to their Noses; they were Com∣manded
by the <HI>Capigi-Bachi.</HI> After 'em came the
<PB N="176" REF="108"/>
<HI>Sorlaques,</HI> or <HI>Foot-Guards of the Body,</HI> consisting of,
old pick'd Soldiers who expect Preferment: They
wore tuck'd up Gowns, carrying their Bows in their
Left-hand, and Quivers on their Shoulders: Their
Caps were of Cloth, like those of the <HI>Capigi,</HI> but
instead of a Cone they were only adorn'd with
Plumes of Feathers. A Thousand <HI>Janisaries</HI> march'd
after 'em, Clad in Red, with <HI>Zercola's</HI> on their
Head, made of a large piece of Felt a Foot broad,
which falls back on their Shoulders, with a Cone or
sharp point like that of the <HI>Capigi:</HI> Every one of
'em carri'd a great Reed or Cane, eight foot long
and three round, with an Ivory Ball on the top,
and their <HI>Aga</HI> walk'd before 'em.</P>
<P>The <HI>Janisaries</HI> were follow'd by 500 <HI>Chiauox</HI>'s
which are <HI>Horse Guards,</HI> the last of 'em carrying the
Standards and Colours that were taken from the
<HI>Imperialists.</HI> They had large Caps or Turbants a∣bove
two Foot in circumference: They were very
well Mounted, and led by the <HI>Chiaoux-Bachi.</HI> After
'em march'd the <HI>Mutefaraca</HI>'s, who are a sort of
Officers that never go to the War, almost like our
<HI>Reformades.</HI> Next came the <HI>Kisler Aga,</HI> accompani'd
by the <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black Eunuchs,</HI> who walk'd on each
side of him, to Guard the <HI>Sultanesses,</HI> who rode in
eight very fine Coaches, but cou'd not be seen by
reason of a piece of Silk with which the Glasses
were cover'd.</P>
<P>After them appear'd the unfortunate Prince <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>
IV. who, with his two Sons, was plac'd in a
Coach close barr'd like a Prison-Window, and
guarded by twelve <HI>Chiaoux</HI>'s. Immediately after
came the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Great Officers, to the number of
above 200 Persons, all richly Cloath'd in Embroi∣der'd
Vests, and Turbants, enrich'd with precious
Stones: Their Horses were also adorn'd with Silver
Bridles, and very fine Foot Cloaths, either Embroi∣der'd,
or of Cloth of Gold, trailing on the Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="108"/>
The seven <HI>Visiers of the Bench</HI> brought up the Rear
of this Magnificent Troop, and were follow'd by the
<HI>Mufti,</HI> who was mounted on a white Horse (but not
so stately as the rest) and attended by four Officers
on Foot. Then came the <HI>Selictar</HI> carrying the <HI>Grand
Signior</HI>'s Sword bare. At last the <HI>Sultan</HI> himself ap∣pear'd
seated in a triumphal Chariot, open on all
Sides, and cover'd all over with silver-gilt Plates,
enrich'd with counterfeit Jewels, which neverthe∣less
cast a great Splendour. The Chariot was drawn
by Eight spotted Horses, cover'd with Red Velvet,
embroider'd with Gold, and adorn'd with gilt Buc∣kles.
The Inside of the Chariot was lin'd with Vel∣vet
of the same Colour, embroider'd also with Gold;
and in it there was a little <HI>Sopha,</HI> with a large Cushi∣on
of a very rich Stuff, on which the <HI>Sultan</HI> sate.
This place of the Chariot was cover'd with a very
rich Canopy, like that of a Coach, and rais'd so
high, that the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> might be easily seen by
the Spectatours. He is about fifty Years old, of a
severe Aspect, and no very fine Shape. He wore
a large <HI>Turbant,</HI> almost like that of the <HI>Chiaoux</HI>'s,
adorn'd with two very magnificent <HI>Aigrets,</HI> enrich'd
with precious Stones: His <HI>Vest</HI> was of a very fine Stuff
adorn'd with Pearls, but much inferiour to the Coat
that cost Fifteen Millions, which the King puts
on when he receives Ambassadours. About and af∣ter
the Chair march'd a hundred <HI>Aga's</HI> on Foot,
with their Officers and Commanders; and in the
last place came Three hundred <HI>Spahi's.</HI></P>
<P>At Night there were great Illuminations in the
<HI>Seraglio</HI> and all the <HI>Mosquees:</HI> and the People ex∣press'd
their Joy by Feasts, Bone-fires, and re∣peated
Shouts, crying, without Intermission, <HI>Long
live our Emperour, the Restorer of Monarchy, and the
Prophet's Darling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monsieur de Chateauneuf,</HI> who omits no occasion of
pleasing the <HI>Turks,</HI> gave 'em so many and so expen∣sive
<PB N="178" REF="109"/>
Marks of the Share he took in their Joy, that
his Charge cou'd not be much less than theirs.
His Palace was almost cover'd with Garlands of
Myrtle; and at Night almost all the People of <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI>
flock'd thither to admire the Beauty of his
Fire-Works. The <HI>French</HI> Ships signaliz'd their Zeal and
Affection to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Interest, according to the Or∣ders
they receiv'd from the Ambassadour, both by the
Illuminations of which their Masts and Ropes were
so full, that they seem'd at a distance to be on fire,
and by repeated Discharges of their Artillery. Be∣sides
the Ambassadour prepar'd a splendid Feast for
several <HI>Turkish</HI> Lords; among whom was the Prince
of <HI>Moldavia:</HI> There were two Tables for twenty
Persons each, those who sate at one being enter∣tain'd
by himself, and those at the other by his Se∣cretary
<HI>Pelleran.</HI> The Guests were regal'd with all
imaginable Magnificence both at Dinner and Sup∣per;
and two Fountains run Wine in the Court,
all the while the Feast lasted, whither all the <HI>Rene∣gado's,
Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Mariners,</HI> came to drink the
Healths of the <HI>Two Glorious Emperours,</HI> Lewis <HI>and</HI>
Solyman, <HI>ever Great, and ever Victorious,</HI> pronoun∣cing
the Word <HI>Vivat,</HI> according to the Custom of
the Country, with loud and repeated Acclamations,
which is the same thing with the <HI>English Huzza.</HI></P>
<P>But among all those Expressions of Joy, that
which scandaliz'd me most, was a Pyramid of Fire,
forty Foot high, which burnt in the Court till the
Morning. For there was an Illumination on the
Top of it representing on one Side the <HI>Arms of
France,</HI> and on the other, a <HI>Shield</HI> charg'd with <HI>Three
fiery Crescents.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> were extremely pleas'd
to see with how much Ardour the <HI>French</HI> espous'd
their Interests; and since that time have look'd more
favourably upon our Countrymen than before. 'Tis
true that they have been of late so much oblig'd to
<HI>France,</HI> that they might justly be reckon'd the most
<PB N="179" REF="109"/>
ungrateful People in the World, if they were not
sensible of so many good Offices. For without in∣sisting
on the powerful Diversion made by our For∣ces
on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which has contributed so effectu∣ally
to the Success of their Arms; they have, to
my certain Knowledge, receiv'd Supplies of Money
from them, which, without pretending to deter∣mine
the precise Sums, I can assure you amount to a
very considerable Value; for it has been observ'd
in Ships that brought 100000 <HI>Piasters,</HI> there were not
20000 for the use of the Merchants.</P>
<P>The Ambassadour has the most convenient way
that cou'd be desir'd, to receive the Sums that are
design'd for secret Service: for all the Money that
comes over to the Merchants must be carry'd to his
House, where the Owners must afterwards receive
it; so that People are not at all surpriz'd, when at
the Arrival of a Ship they see Chests of Gold and
Silver carry'd to him. And besides, who knows
whether the King sends not over Engineers, Gun∣ners,
and Officers: I have seen several Persons of
that Character here, and I my self refus'd a Place
which <HI>Monsieur de Chateauneuf</HI> wou'd have given me
in a Company of <HI>French Granadiers,</HI> consisting of
200 Men, who are publickly levy'd in this City.</P>
<P>This puts me in Mind of a remarkable Accident
that happen'd lately at <HI>Thessalonica.</HI> Two <HI>Engineers</HI>
arriv'd in that Port, pretending to be <HI>French</HI> Gen∣tlemen,
and that they travell'd purely out of Cu∣riosity:
the <HI>Consul</HI> receiv'd 'em with the highest De∣monstrations
of Civility, and invited 'em to lodge at
his House; for 'tis the usual Custom of all the <HI>Consuls</HI>
in the <HI>Levant</HI> to shew a great deal of Respect and
Kindness to Strangers that seem to be Persons of
Note or Quality. But having other conceal'd De∣signs,
they address'd themselves two Days after their
Arrival, to a <HI>Greek</HI> that wore a <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruggoman</HI>'s Cap,
and pray'd him to carry 'em to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assa,</HI> and to in∣terpret
<PB N="180" REF="110"/>
for 'em, without acquainting the <HI>Consul.</HI>
The <HI>Greek,</HI> who was glad of any Opportunity to
earn Money, embrac'd their Proposal very chear∣fully,
and accompany'd 'em to the <HI>Bassa</HI>'s House,
where they declar'd their Profession, and offer'd
him their Service, but without intimating in the least
that they were willing to renounce their Religion.
The <HI>Turkish</HI> Officer receiv'd 'em very favourably,
and promis'd to recommend 'em to some Person at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> who wou'd quickly procure 'em an Em∣ployment
suitable to their Inclinations. Thus they
return'd to the <HI>Consul</HI>'s House very well satisfy'd
with the <HI>Bassa</HI>'s Civility: but the Interpreter's Con∣science
not permitting him to have a Hand in assi∣sting
the declar'd Enemies of his Religion, he disco∣ver'd
the whole Intrigue to the <HI>Consul,</HI> without con∣cealing
the Arguments and earnest Intreaties they
us'd to oblige him to Secresie. Immediately the
honest <HI>Consul</HI> believing that 'twou'd be an acceptable
Piece of Service both to God and the King, to pre∣vent
the wicked Designs of his Guests, order'd 'em
to be apprehended, and sent back to <HI>France</HI> in Fet∣ters.
'Tis plain that his Intentions were good, and
that he could not be justly blam'd for taking that
Course; but he quickly found, to his Cost, that
they had more potent Friends than he imagin'd, for
after they had made their Complaints, he receiv'd a
severe Reprimand from the Marquess <HI>de Seignelay,</HI>
and was in danger of being turn'd out of his
Office.</P>
<P>The Number of <HI>Deserters</HI> that come over to the
<HI>Turks</HI> is almost incredible. There are at present so
many of 'em in the Service, that there might be
several compleat <HI>French</HI> Regiments in the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Army. I know that such a Design has been several
times propos'd to the Ambassadour by the <HI>Grand Vi∣sier,
Kopergli Oglou,</HI> but the little Regard he still pre∣serves
to the external Rules of Decency, has hither∣to
<PB N="181" REF="110"/>
to restrain'd him from giving his Consent. Neither
do I see any Reason why the <HI>Turks</HI> shou'd be offen∣ded
at his seeming Niceness, since 'tis not at all pre∣judicial
to their Interest: For while their main Design
is serv'd, they may very well dispense with a needless
Piece of Formality, and the <HI>French</HI> Soldiers fight as
well when they are dispers'd among the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Troops, as if they were all united in a distinct
Body. That which allures 'em to come over in
such vast Numbers, is the favourable Treatment
they receive at their Arrival: about eight Days ago
I saw a hundred and fifty of 'em march thro' this
City, with Drums beating, and Colours flying, I
mean a Piece of White Cloth, which in this Coun∣trey,
as well as upon the Sea, is reckon'd the Ban∣ner
of <HI>France.</HI> Prisoners of all Nations, except the
<HI>Germans,</HI> enjoy the same Priviledges, provided they
claim his Majesty's Protection. 'Tis true there are
several pretended Deserters, who carry on their hid∣den
Designs under so specious a Disguise: Nor have
the <HI>Turks</HI> yet learn'd Circumspection, tho' they have
been so often deceiv'd. I cou'd tell you twenty
Stories of this Nature, but I shall content my self
with relating one Instance, to convince you that
the <HI>Emperour</HI> has as good <HI>Spies</HI> as the King of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>About the End of the last Year, immediately af∣ter
the Death of the Ambassadour <HI>Girardin,</HI> one
<HI>Vanel</HI> came over as a Deserter to the <HI>Grand Visier</HI>'s
Army in <HI>Hungary,</HI> pretending to be a <HI>French</HI> Gentle∣man,
who was taken Prisoner on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and
forc'd to serve as a <HI>Voluntier</HI> in the Emperour's Ar∣my,
which he left, assoon as he found a favourable
Occasion to make his Escape. But not contenting
himself to remain as a Spy in the Army, he had
the Confidence to assume the Character of <HI>Agent of
France,</HI> till the Arrival of the Ambassadour
whom the King had nam'd. The <HI>Grand Visier</HI> see∣ing
<PB N="182" REF="111"/>
a Man whose very aspect seem'd to answer for
his Honesty; and besides, perceiving that he made
a great Figure, was so far from suspecting him, that
he own'd him as Agent: So that during the whole
Winter he manag'd the King's Affairs with as much
Authority as if he had been empower'd with a
Commission from <HI>Versailles.</HI> 'Tis true, he seem'd
to be very jealous of the Honour and Interest of
the Nation; but in private he endeavour'd to per∣swade
the <HI>Grand Visier</HI> that the only way to preserve
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, was to hasten the conclusion
of a Peace with the Emperour; and in the mean
time he found out ways to acquaint the Court of
<HI>Vienna</HI> with all the Transactions at the <HI>Port.</HI></P>
<P>This cunning Spy had the Art to play so difficult
a Game with so much dexterity and success, that he
gain'd the esteem and affection both of the <HI>Grand
Visier</HI> and <HI>Sultan,</HI> from whom he receiv'd considera∣ble
Presents. And even the <HI>French</HI> had at last so
good an Opinion of him, that they scrupl'd not to
address themselves to him on all occasions, as they
wou'd have done to an Ambassador. So that he
thought his Credit so well established, that he might
boldly expect the arrival of Monsieur <HI>de Chateauneuf,</HI>
who was coming to perswade the <HI>Visier</HI> to continue
the War against the Empire. <HI>Vanel</HI> went to meet
him a days Journey beyond <HI>Sophia,</HI> and told him,
that since Fortune had engag'd him in the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Service, during the Vacancy of the Embassy, he
thought himself oblig'd by the Honour he had to
be a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, to do what Service he cou'd
to the Nation, as he had actually done for several
Months, and was ready to give him an exact ac∣count
of all his Proceedings. Afterwards he went
with the Ambassador to the <HI>Visier,</HI> who gave him so
favourable a Character, that Monsieur <HI>de Chateauneuf</HI>
either did not, or seem'd not to doubt of his Zeal
and Affection to the King's Service. However, 'tis
<PB N="183" REF="111"/>
probable, that he was not entirely satisfi'd with his
Conduct, and that he wrote to several Places for
better Information concerning him. For having
one Evening receiv'd a Pacquet in <HI>Vanel</HI>'s Presence,
that subtle Spy fearing that the Intelligence might
concern him, adventur'd to peep over the Ambassa∣dor's
Shoulder, while he was reading the Letters,
and perceiving that they gave a very suspicious Ac∣count
of him, he resolv'd to prevent the danger that
threaten'd him by a sudden Flight. Next Morning
he rose as soon as the day began to appear, and went
immediately to one <HI>D' Etanchot,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Captain in
Count <HI>Teckely</HI>'s Troops, who was his intimate Friend:
He accosted him with a Melancholic Air, and in∣treated
him to carry him to Count. <HI>Teckely</HI>'s Army,
where he had some business to dispatch that requir'd
all possible expedition. <HI>D' Etanchot</HI> reply'd, That
he was ready to serve him, and that he would im∣mediately
go along with him after he had receiv'd
the Ambassador's Orders. <HI>Vanel,</HI> who dreaded no∣thing
more than the discovery of his Design, con∣jur'd
his Friend not to insist on that piece of For∣mality;
and to engage him the more effectually to
comply with his Desires, he offer'd him 1000 Pi∣stoles,
promising to give him as much more at the
end of his Journey. <HI>D' Etanchot</HI> was extreamly sur∣priz'd
at his Earnestness and Impatience, and per∣ceiv'd
by the great Offers he made him, that the
business was of greater Importance than at first he
imagin'd: His Fidelity to his Prince was stronger
than his Affection to his Friend, and at last he told
him plainly, that he wou'd not go with him unless
he wou'd suffer him to ask the Ambassador's Per∣mission
before his departure. Then <HI>Vanel</HI> seeing
himself discover'd, and fearing Torture more than
Death, which he knew was inavoidable, lest he shou'd
not be able to endure the extream violence of the
Pain, without divulging his Secret, he resolv'd to be
<PB N="184" REF="112"/>
his own Executioner; and suffering <HI>D' Etanchot</HI> to
walk some paces before him, without speaking a
Word, he pull'd a Pistol out of his Pocket, charg'd
with three Bullets, and shot himself thro' the Head.
His Friend surpriz'd at the unexpected noise, look'd
back, and seeing him lie groveling on the Ground,
and wallowing in his own Blood, run immediately
to acquaint the Ambassador with the Tragical Ac∣cident,
who at first cou'd not believe him, but af∣terwards
suspecting him to be the Murderer, or∣der'd
him to be secur'd: Then he went with several
of his Servants, to the place where this unfortunate
Person lay, and finding him still alive, tho' very
weak, he ask'd him, How he was; <HI>Optimé,</HI> reply'd
<HI>Vanel,</HI> for they us'd to discourse in <HI>Latin.</HI> Then the
Ambassador enquir'd, who put him in that condi∣tion,
<HI>I did,</HI> answer'd he: What mov'd you to
such an act, reply'd the Ambassador; <HI>Because,</HI> said
he, <HI>I was weary of Life.</HI> Afterwards the Ambassa∣dor
ask'd him several Questions concerning the place
of his Birth, and his design in coming hither, but
cou'd not obtain any satisfactory Answer; and
(which is hardly credible) he endur'd the most ex∣quisitely
cruel Torments they cou'd invent, with∣out
making the least discovery, and even was so
little daunted, that while he lay under the extre∣mity
of the Torture, <HI>'Tis in vain,</HI> said he to the
Ambassador, <HI>to torment me thus, you shall never know
more than I have already told you.</HI> In short, he gave
so many Marks of an invincible Courage and Re∣solution,
that I cou'd hardly forbear comparing
him to <HI>Socrates,</HI> or <HI>Minutius Scaevola,</HI> if I had not a
natural reluctancy to praise Men of his Profession.
Thus he died of his Wounds, and left no Papers of
consequence, that cou'd discover his Intrigue: But
the Ambassador and his Men seiz'd on ten or
twelve good Horses, and above 25000 Livres in
Gold that were found in his Possession.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="112"/>
I shall conclude this Letter with telling you, that
I'm resolv'd to depart with the first fair Wind for
<HI>Alexandria,</HI> in a Vessel belonging to <HI>Ciotad,</HI> Com∣manded
by Captain <HI>Carbonneau,</HI> who is an old Sea∣man,
and perfectly well acquainted with all the
parts of the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> But I'm afraid he will
stand in need of all his Experience to bring us
safe to our design'd Harbour; for this is the most
dangerous season of the Year. However, I have
stay'd so long in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that, tho' the Voy∣age
were more hazardous, I cou'd willingly ad∣venture
on't.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>STorms</HI> and <HI>Contrary Winds</HI> are the main, and al∣most
the only Objects of a Traveller's Fear at
Sea: And Yet I reckon my self extreamly oblig'd
to the <HI>Bad</HI> Weather we met with about eight days
ago, since it forc'd our Captain to stop at the fa∣mous
Island of <HI>Scio,</HI> where we still continue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks,</HI> and in general all the Christian In∣habitants,
enjoy so many Priviledges, and retain
so many Marks of their ancient Liberty, that if I
did not sometimes see a <HI>Turbant,</HI> I shou'd almost
forget that I am still in <HI>Turkey.</HI> The whole com∣pass
of the Island does not amount to 100 Miles;
yet there are above 200 Churches in it, and at
<PB N="186" REF="113"/>
least 30 Monasteries belonging to the <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Latin</HI> Christians, who perform their several Rites
without the least disturbance. They are suffer'd
to walk in Procession about the Streets, as in <HI>France;</HI>
tho' there is nothing more odious to the <HI>Turks</HI> than
that Ceremony: And which is still more remark∣able,
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who, in all other parts of the <HI>Otto∣man</HI>
Empire are reputed Slaves, live here under the
Protection of a Magistrate, who has the Title of
<HI>Consul.</HI> This Happiness, which ought to be so
much the dearer to the <HI>Greeks</HI> of this Island, be∣cause
'tis peculiar to themselves, is only a continu∣ation
of the Favours bestow'd on 'em by <HI>Mahomet</HI> II.
when he made himself Master of <HI>Greece.</HI> For the
<HI>Sciots</HI> perceiving that 'twou'd be in vain to resist
an Enemy who had lately taken <HI>Constantinople</HI> from
the <HI>Palaeologi,</HI> and was still Victorious in all his At∣tempts,
resolv'd to mitigate his Fury by a volun∣tary
submission, and own'd themselves his Subjects,
perhaps before he thought of Attaking 'em. <HI>Mahomet</HI>
was so well satisfi'd with this Mark of their Affection,
that he granted 'em several advantageous Privi∣ledges
which they still enjoy. For the <HI>Turks</HI> are
very Religious observers of their Promises to their
own Subjects; tho' they scruple not to violate
Treaties concluded with Neighbouring Princes, e∣specially
<HI>Christians,</HI> and <HI>Heretical Mahometans,</HI> such
as the <HI>Persians,</HI> of whom the <HI>Turks</HI> have almost as
bad an Opinion as the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> have of <HI>Pro∣testants;</HI>
because the <HI>Persians</HI> embrace the Doctrine
of one <HI>Haly,</HI> who pretended to reform the <HI>Maho∣metan</HI>
Religion, as <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> have Reform'd
the <HI>Christian.</HI></P>
<P>At that time the Island was possess'd by the <HI>Ju∣stiniani,</HI>
with the Title of a <HI>Principality,</HI> under the
Protection of the <HI>Genoese,</HI> who were then Masters
of many fine Countries in <HI>Natolia,</HI> as it appears
by the Escutcheons and Arms of the Republic,
<PB N="187" REF="113"/>
which are still to be seen almost at every end of a
Field.</P>
<P>There is but one City in the Island, and that
a very small one, tho' it has eight Gates. The
Streets are broad enough for Coaches; and the beau∣ty
of the old Houses is a sign of the richness and
splendor of their ancient Possessors. The Castle
is not much less than the City, and Commands
both that and the Port: Yet some Years ago the
Marquis <HI>Du Quesne</HI> had the Courage to attack some
Pirates who retir<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d under its Walls, and fir'd above
fifty Broad-sides into the City, because the Bassa
made a shew of resisting him. This attempt caus'd
so great a Consternation among the Inhabitants,
that their fears continue even after the Marquiss's
Death, and they still tremble when they hear his
Name mention'd. The <HI>French</HI> are very proud of
this Expedition, tho' 'tis certain they have no great
reason to boast of it, since it cost the Nation
100000 Crowns, which <HI>Fabre,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Agent,
pay'd to the <HI>Grand Visier.</HI> This was, in my Opini∣on,
a sufficient reparation to the <HI>Turks;</HI> and there
was no Honour got by so vigorous an Action, but
that which is due to the Memory of the brave Man
that perform'd it.</P>
<P>'Tis equally difficult to enter the Port, and to
get out of it, as our Captain has found to his cost:
For the charge of maintaining the Ships Company
amounts at least to 60 <HI>Livres</HI> a day, and I believe
he wou'd willingly give 30 <HI>Louis d' Ors</HI> to be at
Sea again.</P>
<P>The Government of <HI>Scio</HI> is a very considerable
Post, and the <HI>Bassa</HI> is oftentimes advanc'd to the
Dignity of <HI>Grand Visier.</HI> 'Tis not above a Year
since <HI>Kopergli Oglou</HI> was remov'd from this place, and
made <HI>Visier</HI> after the Death of <HI>Ismael.</HI> He has un∣der
him a <HI>Kiaia,</HI> a <HI>Kady,</HI> a <HI>Vaivoide,</HI> and a <HI>Receiver
of Customs,</HI> as all other Bassa's have. The Last of
<PB N="188" REF="114"/>
these Officers has more Employment here than in
most other places, by reason of the <HI>Mastic</HI> that
grows in this Island, better and more plentiful than
in any other part of the World. There are above
a Thousand Chests of it gather'd every Year, each
of which contains Three Hundred Weight, and
the total Value amounts to above 200000 Crowns.
But the Inhabitants are not much enrich'd by so
considerable a Trade: For they are not only oblig'd
to pay one half of the <HI>Mastic</HI> by way of Tribute,
but must sell the rest at a very low rate to the Re∣ceiver
of Customs. 'Tis a white odoriferous
Gumm, that runs in the Spring out of little holes
which are made in the Bark of a small, weak, and
twining Shrub that creeps along the Ground, as
<HI>Vines</HI> wou'd do if they were not supported.</P>
<P>I have not hitherto had occasion to see any re∣markable
Church in this Island, but that which is
call'd <HI>Niaomai:</HI> 'Tis a very ancient Building, and
adorn'd with a piece of <HI>Mosaic</HI> Work, like that of
<HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI> I will not trouble you with the Story
of its <HI>Miraculous Image,</HI> since all these Legends are
only the same Tale, repeated with some small alte∣rations.
The <HI>Greeks</HI> believe and maintain these
Impostures with a great deal of Zeal; and even the
<HI>Turks</HI> who abhorr the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> worse than
<HI>Magic,</HI> are sometimes cheated by 'em: For when
they hear that one of the Saints cures such a Di∣stemper,
they procure Masses to be said, and pre∣sent
Candles with as much Devotion as the most Su∣perstitious
<HI>Greek.</HI> I shall take this occasion to re∣late
an accident that happen'd not long ago in this
place; and perhaps you will not think your time
ill imploy'd in reading so odd and diverting a
Story. You have doubtless heard of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> of
<HI>Padua,</HI> who is the <HI>Padrone Singularo</HI> of all the <HI>Ita∣lians,</HI>
and has acquir'd so great a Reputation of
working Miracles, that tho' he was a declar'd
<PB N="189" REF="114"/>
<HI>Papist,</HI> and more than that, a Monk of the Order
of St. <HI>Francis;</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> have plac'd him among
their <HI>Tutelar Saints,</HI> and sing <HI>Kyrie Eleison's</HI> to him
with as much Devotion as to St. <HI>Polycarp</HI> himself.
He has a Magnificent Chapel in this place, and in
it a Wooden Image, which is very well painted,
gilt, and crown'd, and wants neither <HI>He</HI> nor <HI>She</HI> Vota∣ries
in abundance. His Miracles are the only sub∣ject
of the common Talk. Some own themselves
oblig'd to him for Husbands, and others for Wives;
sometimes he heals a broken Leg, and saves others
from Ship-wrack; and, in a word, I know not
one Person here who has not receiv'd some Marks
of his Favour. 'Tis true, he's apt to grow sullen,
and woe be to the poor Suppliants when little
<HI>St. Anthony</HI> takes the pet, for he'll e'en let 'em cry
their Eyes out, without deigning to take notice of
'em: However, there is no Disease without its Re∣medy,
and a few smart Lashes about the Shoul∣ders
usually cures him of the <HI>Spleen.</HI> But when the
Distemper is very stubborn, and the Dose of the
<HI>Whip</HI> proves ineffectual, they either turn him out of
his Lodging, and make him lie abroad in the Wind
and Rain, or dip him ten or twelve times in Water,
with a great Stone at his Neck, which always pro∣duces
the desir'd effect, and makes the little Gen∣tleman
as Complaisant as they can wish. One of the
<HI>Turks</HI> in the Castle, who had ventur'd all his Stock
on Board a <HI>Saique,</HI> and was afraid of losing it either
by Storm or Piracy, resolv'd to steal <HI>St. Anthony,</HI> of
whom he had heard so many Wonders, and either
by fair or foul means to make him preserve his
Goods. He waited some time for a convenient
opportunity to put his design in execution; and
one day perceiving that there were none in the
Church but himself, he hid the miraculous Image
under his Vest, and carri'd it away undiscover'd.
As soon as he came home he set it in the most
<PB N="190" REF="115"/>
honourable Place of his House, adorn'd it with
Flowers, and kept two Wax Candles perpetually
burning before it; addreffing himself to it every
day with a great deal of Reverence, and humbly
acquainting it that his whole Estate was on board
the Saique; and that the Loss of that wou'd en∣tirely
ruine him and his Family. Thus he conti∣nu'd
as long as he might reasonably hope that the
Saique was safe; but when the time was expir'd,
in which he expected to hear of its Return, he
took away the Flowers and Candles, and began to
treat the Image very roughly, beating it every day,
and threatning a worse Usage, if he shou'd find
that it had neglected his Saique. <HI>Thou infamous Chri∣stian,</HI>
said he, <HI>think'st thou to mock a</HI> Musulman,
<HI>whose Slave thou art not worthy to be? By</HI> Mahomet,
<HI>if thou dost not restore my</HI> Saique, <HI>I'll beat thee to
Pieces.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time both the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romanists</HI>
were extremely griev'd for the Loss of their Saint:
and their Consternation was the greater, because
they cou'd not imagine him to be stoll'n away, since
he was only made of Wood. The <HI>Cordeliers</HI> had
not the least Share in the common Affliction; but
since they have an admirable Faculty of improving
every thing to the best Advantage, they declar'd
publickly that the Saint was not able longer to en∣dure
the Coldness of the Peoples Devotion, and had
therefore withdrawn his Presence from among 'em.
And even an old Father dream'd that S. <HI>Anthony</HI> ap∣pear'd
to him, and said, <HI>My Son, I have left this
City, because I was no longer able to be a Witness of
the Crimes that are daily committed in it, and the Want
of Love to God, and Zeal to his Service.</HI> The good
Man related his Dream to the People, and exhort∣ed
'em to recall the Saint by Prayers, Vows, and
above all, by a great number of <HI>Masses.</HI> At last the
<HI>Turk</HI> heard of the safe Arrival of the <HI>Saique</HI> with
<PB N="191" REF="115"/>
his Goods, so that thinking himself oblig'd in Con∣science
to release the Saint out of his Prison, he
carry'd him back with a great deal of Honour, and
told the whole Story. The Image was very joyfully
receiv'd by the <HI>Christians,</HI> who look'd upon this as
a New Miracle; which re-kindl'd their Devotion
to such a Degree, that it can never be more ardent
than 'tis at present: the <HI>Turk</HI> also gave 100 <HI>Piasters,</HI>
as an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Acknowledgment of the Favour he had re∣ceiv'd,
and the Fathers order'd the Money to be
cast into a silver Chain, with which they fasten'd
the Image, to prevent its being stoll'n hereafter:
for they consider'd that People are always apt to
follow a bad Example, and that they might perhaps
miss their Saint when they shou'd have most need of
him.</P>
<P>This Accident has convinc'd me of a Truth I
cou'd never believe before, I mean that Supersti∣tion
may bear such an absolute Sway in the Minds
of those who are under its Power, that even <HI>Turks</HI>
and <HI>Christians</HI> may join together in some Rites of
Devotion. I confess I was so far from giving Cre∣dit
to Relations of this Nature, that I could hardly
believe my own Eyes on a like Occasion at <HI>Lampe∣dusa,</HI>
where we touch'd in our Voyage to <HI>Malta.</HI>
But since I am now of another Opinion, I shall take
this Occasion to acquaint you with an Observation
I made there, which I durst not mention so long as I
thought it impossible.</P>
<P>There is in that Island a little Chapel dedicated to
the <HI>Virgin,</HI> in which there is an Altar, and a Coffin
with a <HI>Turbant</HI> laid upon it, which is usually call'd
<HI>Mahomet's Tomb.</HI> Both <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> have so
great a Veneration for this Chapel, that they never
pass it by without leaving Money, Victuals, or some
other Offering. At our Arrival we found two large
and fresh <HI>Pastaiques,</HI> a <HI>Sequin</HI> of Gold, some silver
<HI>Aspers,</HI> and small Coin of <HI>Malta,</HI> to which our
<PB N="192" REF="116"/>
Captain added a <HI>French</HI> Piece of <HI>Three-pence half-peny.</HI>
Our Pilot told me that these Offerings were de∣sign'd
for the Relief of poor Slaves, who oftentimes
escap'd thither from <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Afric;</HI> adding that
the Place was so Sacred and Miraculous that none
but Slaves durst take any of these things from the
Altar; or, if they did, that they could not possibly
get out of the Island. He related also several In∣stances
of these Miracles, but all his Arguments and
Stories could not hinder me from eating one of the
<HI>Pastaiques;</HI> for the Weather was very hot, and you
know that those who are not accustom'd to the Sea
are usually very desirous of Fruit. To return to
<HI>Scio.</HI></P>
<P>I went t'other day to see a Place call'd the
<HI>Schools</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> tho' according to all probability
there were never any Schools in it. I incline rather
to believe that 'twas formerly a Place where Sacrifi∣ces
were offer'd to the God <HI>Pan,</HI> or some other <HI>Ru∣ral</HI>
Deity: for I saw nothing but a square Altar cut
out of a Rock, on the Shore, with some decay'd
<HI>Basso-Relievo's</HI> on the Sides, among which you may
distinguish the Representation of an <HI>Oxe, Wolf, Sbeep,</HI>
and <HI>Rabbet,</HI> besides some other Beasts which are less
distinct. Not far from thence I saw a paltry Vil∣lage,
where they assur'd me <HI>Homer</HI> was born: but
<HI>Smyrna</HI> pretends a better Title to the Honour of be∣ing
the Birth-place of that great Man.</P>
<P>I observ'd nothing else remarkable in this Island,
except their Manner of Living, which is extremely
free: for they give and receive Visits, make Enter∣tainments,
and the Women sit at the Doors of the
Houses, and walk with Young Men to the Fields,
with as much Liberty as if they were in <HI>France.</HI> Be∣sides
they are of a very sociable Humour, and any
<HI>Frenchman,</HI> who is Master of a tolerable Stock of
Wit, may quickly find a Mistress, and even some∣times
an advantageous Match in this Place. For
<PB N="193" REF="116"/>
'tis the highest Ambition of the Women of this
Island to marry a <HI>Frank;</HI> both because they are na∣turally
of a freer Temper than the Men of the
Country, and are not subject to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI>
nor consequently pay any Avanies, Taxes, or Im∣posts;
which are two very considerable Advan∣tages.</P>
<P>This is the only Island in the <HI>Levant,</HI> where the
Custom of wearing <HI>long Garments</HI> does not prevail:
for the <HI>Sciots</HI> retain'd the Fashion us'd by the <HI>Franks,</HI>
after their Subjection to the <HI>Turks.</HI> They still use
Doublets or Wast-coats, Breeches, and Shooes; and
besides they wear their Hair long: but we have
chang'd so many Fashions since that time, that they
who have still kept that which was then in use
appear very ridiculous at present. Their Hats have
broad Brims, not cock'd up, and tapering Crowns,
somewhat resembling a Sugar-Loaf: the Sleeves of
their Doublets are wide and open, but close at the
Wrist: their Breeches are open below, edg'd with
Ribbons, and their Drawers appear under 'em: their
Shooes have large open Ears, and are sharp-pointed
at the Toe, as they were usually made in our Coun∣try
about Twenty Years ago. The Womens Habit
is not different from that which is us'd by the Com∣mon
People in <HI>Bretagne, Maine, Normandy,</HI> and
some other Parts of <HI>France.</HI> For they wear a kind
of short Cassock, fasten'd with a Lace before, and
over that another of Silk Stuff, of which there is a
great deal made in the Island. This Cassock, which
the Maids of my Country wou'd call a Waste-coat,
reaches not below the Middle of the Thigh, and
the Sleeves which are not very long, are tied up a
little below the Bending of the Arm, for the Con∣veniency
of wearing Silken Gloves, which are also
made in <HI>Scio,</HI> and are not unhandsome. Besides
they have a kind of Petty-Coat, in which there
are (I believe) thirty Ells of Stuff, for 'tis pleited
<PB N="194" REF="117"/>
quite round, except on the Fore-part, and these
Foldings are all of an equal Depth, and sew'd to∣gether:
this Petty-coat is so short, that it hides not
above one half of their Legs: and they are always
very careful to wear fine and tight Stockins, lest
that which appears shou'd give a Man an ill Opi∣nion
of what is conceal'd. In their Head-Dress
they differ both from the <HI>Franks</HI> and <HI>Levantines;</HI> for
it consists only in a Piece of Cloth wrapp'd about
their Heads.</P>
<P>There are in this Island several Families that pre∣tend
to <HI>Nobility,</HI> and even some that draw their Pe∣digree
from the <HI>Justiniani;</HI> but their Education,
and Way of Living, is so unsuitable to their
high Birth, that 'twou'd seem altogether incredible,
if it were not attested by all the Inhabitants of the
Island.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE set said from <HI>Scio</HI> on the 20<HI>th.</HI> of the last
Month, and two Days after were in the
Height of <HI>Stanchio,</HI> a little Island, famous for the
Birth of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> and the celebrated <HI>Apelles;</HI> and
for a Tree of such prodigious Bigness, that its Shadow
is large enough to cover 150 Men. I cannot give
you a more particular Account of that Island, since
we stopt not there, but kept on our Course till we
<PB N="195" REF="117"/>
arriv'd at <HI>Rhodes</HI> on <HI>Christmass-Day:</HI> Instead of a
large Description of this Island, you must content
your self with an Account of what Observati∣ons
I could make in the narrow space of half a
Day.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Rhodes</HI> is a hundred Miles in Com∣pass:
'Twas taken from the <HI>Saracens</HI> by the <HI>Knights</HI>
of <HI>S. John of Jerusalem,</HI> on the Day of the <HI>Virgin's
Assumption, Ann.</HI> 1309. and retaken by <HI>Solyman</HI> II.
Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the Year 1522. by the
Treachery of <HI>Andrew d' Amaral,</HI> one of the <HI>Knights,</HI>
and <HI>Chancellour</HI> of the Order; who aspiring to the
Dignity of the <HI>Great Master;</HI> and being disappoint∣ed
of his Hopes to attain it, by the Election of
<HI>Monsieur de Villiers l' Ile Adam</HI> to that Office, was
so enrag'd, that he shot an Arrow into the Enemy's
Camp, with a Letter discovering the only Place
where the Town cou'd be successfully attack'd.</P>
<P>The City is little, but extremely strong, both by rea∣son
of its Situation on a Rock, and the great number
of Bastions and Towers that command one another
very advantageously. The <HI>Great Masters</HI> House, and
the Inns of the <HI>Seven Languages</HI> remain still entire,
and the same may be said of the Church of S. <HI>John,</HI>
tho' the <HI>Turks</HI> have turn'd it into a Mosquee, for
they have not so much as defac'd the Images of
our <HI>Saviour</HI> and the <HI>Virgin,</HI> represented over the
Door in <HI>Bass-Relief.</HI> Tho' I had not known that
this Island belong'd formerly to the <HI>Knights</HI> of <HI>Mal∣ta,</HI>
I shou'd have easily discover'd it by the great
number of Inscriptions, and Scutcheons of the Or∣der,
that are over the Gate of the City, and al∣most
every where else. And besides there are so
many other ancient Monuments of the same Na∣ture,
that I never saw so vast a number of In∣scriptions
in so small a Spot of Ground.</P>
<P>'Tis related in the History of the Order, that this
Island was formerly infested by a horrible Dragon,
<PB N="196" REF="118"/>
above thirty Foot long, who abode in a Cave not
far from the City, and made such a dreadful Ha∣vock
all around, that there was no Safety in the
Country. The Story adds, that his very Breath in∣fected
all the Neighbourhood of his Cave, and that
his Skin was so hard, that no Arrow cou'd pierce
it, but that he was kill'd at last by a <HI>Knight</HI> of <HI>Pro∣vence,</HI>
call'd <HI>Dedoat de Goson.</HI> I always suspected the
Credit of this Relation, but mine Eyes have now
convinc'd me of the Truth of it: for the Monster's
Head is on one of the Gates of the City towards
the Land, and I had time to take a full View of it.
I cannot represent it better than by comparing it to
the Head of a Hog; only 'tis longer and bigger,
and hath no Ears; the Jaws are very large, and
arm'd with long and sharp Teeth.</P>
<P>Since I am not over-fond of believing any thing
that seems strange and unaccountable, I must beg
leave to persist in my Incredulity, concerning the
Famous <HI>Colossus,</HI> which was formerly the Glory and
Ornament of this Island.</P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>Strabo, Pliny,</HI> and several other Grave
Writers, seem to believe this Story: but Authors as
well as other Men, take Pleasure in relating Won∣ders.
This was the usual Custom of the Ancients,
especially <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Herodotus,</HI> who have stuff'd their
Writings with such lofty Fables, as the Reader may
easily perceive by a transient View of their Works.
And besides when an Author of any considerable
Reputation in the Learned World relates a Matter
of Fact, 'tis always confirm'd by the Testimony of
those who follow him. Nevertheless in this Case,
the Opinions of Authors are very different; for
<HI>Chares</HI> according to some, erected the <HI>Colossus,</HI> where∣as
others ascribe that Honour to <HI>Lacches:</HI> some with
<HI>Strabo</HI> relate, that 'twas <HI>seventy Cubits</HI> high; and
others affirm that its Height amounted to <HI>Eighty;</HI>
so that the Story is at the best doubtful and un∣certain.
<PB N="197" REF="118"/>
But to examine the Matter more narrowly,
the largest Computation of the Heighth of the <HI>Colossus</HI>
will hardly amount to what is requir'd by the Circum∣stances
of the Story: for the Breadth of the Port of
<HI>Rhodes,</HI> between the opposite Shores, where the Feet of
the <HI>Colossus</HI> are said to have been fix'd, amounts to 324
measur'd Feet, so that the whole Figure must have
been 500 Foot high. And besides how is it possible
to conceive that a Mass of such a Prodigious Big∣ness
cou'd be cast. I know some pretend that
'twas built by Pieces, and that it consisted only of
Stone lin'd with Brass; but this Opinion as well as
the other is clogg'd with unsurmountable Difficul∣ties,
as 'twill appear from the following Reflexions.</P>
<P>The tallest of the <HI>Egyptian Pyramids,</HI> which are
justly reckon'd among the <HI>Wonders of the World,</HI> cou'd
not be rais'd above 520 Foot high; and the Tower
of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> which has not (and perhaps never
had) its equal in the World, does not exceed 560 Feet.
Now these admirable Buildings have sufficient Bases
or Foundations, to support the Weight of the Su∣perstructure;
whereas this enormous Figure must
have been four times bigger above than below,
without reck'ning the Arms that hung down, or
at least one of 'em which carry'd a Lanthorn, and
(if the Story be true) could not be made but by
the <HI>Architects</HI> whom <HI>Aesop</HI> sent to King <HI>Nectanebus.</HI>
I will not insist upon the equal poising of so great
a Mass, which was both absolutely necessary, and ex∣tremely
difficult in this Case; but shall proceed to
more obvious Reasons. 'Tis said that after this <HI>Co∣lossus</HI>
was overthrown by an Earthquake, it remain'd
where it fell till the Year 656, or according to
others 952, which is a new Controversie; and that
the <HI>Saracens</HI> broke it to pieces, and sold the Brass to
a <HI>Jew,</HI> who carry'd it to <HI>Antioch.</HI> And here we
meet with another Variation in the Relations of Au∣thors;
for tho' most are agreed that 900 Camels
<PB N="198" REF="119"/>
were loaded with the Brass, there are some that re∣duce
the Number to 800, but neither of these Opi∣nions
is well grounded.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I wou'd gladly be inform'd where the <HI>Co∣lossus</HI>
fell; and they who maintain the Truth of this
Story, will perhaps find this to be a more puzzling
Question than they imagine. For considering the
Situation of its Legs, they cannot pretend that it
fell towards the Land, and consequently they must
acknowledge that it tumbl'd into the Sea, where it
cou'd not lie without stopping the Mouth of the
Harbour; nor cou'd that be done without ruining
the Trade of the City, on which all its Riches de∣pended.
But these necessary Consequences of this
Supposition, are directly contradicted by History,
which assures us, that <HI>Rhodes</HI> was a very flourishing
City, and that its Port was as good and as much
frequented, as ever, at the Arrival of the <HI>Sara∣cens.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not the only Absurdity that destroys
the Credit of the Story. Tis well known that a
Camel's Burthen never exceeds five or six hundred
Weight, especially when the Journey is considerably
long: and how then cou'd 900 of those Animals
carry away so prodigious a Quantity of Brass. For
you will find by Calculation, that every Foot in
the Heighth of the <HI>Colossus,</HI> (reckoning 'em one
with another) weigh'd above 3000 Pounds; since
'tis computed that a square Foot of that Metal,
containing an Inch in Thickness, weighs above fifty
Pounds. Now 'tis plain, that the very encompas∣sing
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody of the <HI>Colossus</HI> wou'd require much
more than sixty such Pieces, which according to the
above-mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Computation, amount to 1500
Pounds, without reckoning the Overplus; and by
the same Proportion you may guess at the
Quantity of Brass that wou'd have been necessary
for lining the whole Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="119"/>
This <HI>Colossus</HI> puts me in mind of the extravagant
Proposal made to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great by an Archi∣tect
call'd <HI>Dinocrates,</HI> who undertook to build a City
on Mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> and to cut it into the Shape of a
Man, with a Cup in his Hand disgorging a River.
Cou'd ever a more ridiculous <HI>Chimaera</HI> enter into a
distemper'd Brain? But the Ancients cou'd easily
swallow the greatest Absurdity, and there are still
too many profess'd Adorers of those fabulous Wri∣ters,
who defend all their Lies and Mistakes with a
stupid Obstinacy. As for my part, I confess my
Faith is so weak on such Occasions, that I cannot
forbear suspecting the Truth of the Story of the
<HI>Rhodian Colossus.</HI> At least since I have so much Com∣plaisance
to the Authors that attest it, as to keep
my self from denying it absolutely; I hope they
will give me leave to think that 'twas somewhat
smaller, less wonderful, and situated in another
Place, than they imagine: for a much less incredi∣ble
Bulk will suffice, if we suppose that 'twas
plac'd at the Mouth of the Harbour for Galleys.
However I dare not venture to assure you that I have
seen the Place where the <HI>Colossus</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> stood,
but only where 'tis believ'd it stood: for thus I shall
be sure to keep close to the Truth, which I have al∣ways
made the Standard of my Relations.</P>
<P>We stay'd part of a Day at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and set Sail
the same Night with a fair Wind; but a sudden
Change of Weather oblig'd us to stand in to the
Road of <HI>Cyprus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cyprus</HI> is an Island almost of the same Bigness
with <HI>Rhodes.</HI> The Air is so sweet, clear, and tem∣perate,
that the Weather is perpetually fair; at least
I can assure you, that during the little time we
spent in it, I cou'd not perceive the least Sign of
Winter. It produces great Abundance of Sugar,
Cotton, and delicious Wine: besides 'tis the best
Country in the World for Hunting, and Provisions
<PB N="200" REF="120"/>
are so incredibly cheap, that, as the <HI>French Consul</HI> as∣sur'd
me, the greatest Lover of his Belly cannot
spend Forty Piasters a Year in Eating and Drinking.
The Town is neither large nor neat, inhabited by a
Medley of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> as all other Places
under the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Dominion. I saw a Man
in it that had four Arms, two on each Side, one
above the other, but he cou'd only use the lower.
The 27<HI>th.</HI> in the Morning we set Sail, and arriv'd at
<HI>Alexandria</HI> on the 8<HI>th.</HI> instant towards Noon.</P>
<P>The Land lies so extremely low, that tho' the
Sun shone very bright, we cou'd not discover the
Coast, till we were very near it. At the same time
we perceiv'd a Saique making towards us, with a
Pilot and four Officers of the Custom-House. Per∣haps
most of us wou'd have willingly dispens'd with
the last of our Visitants; but we stood very much
in need of the Pilot's Help, for both the Road and
Harbour are extremely dangerous, by reason of the
lurking Rocks that can hardly be avoided without
the Assistance of a Seaman of the Country. At
last having cast Anchor very happily, I went a-shore
in the Saique. As I pass'd by the Custom-House,
I was somewhat surpriz'd at the unusual Exactness
of the Officers; for they search'd me all over, and
even thrust their Hands into my Breeches, to know
whether I had brought any Gold or Silver, which
pay a considerable Impost to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> com∣monly
call'd <HI>Gold-Duty.</HI> But I was much more sur∣priz'd
at Night, when they came to shut us up like
so many Prisoners, as they do every Night in the
Week, and on <HI>Fridays</HI> at Noon; by reason of a
foolish Prophecy, that foretells the Conquest of the
City by the <HI>Franks.</HI> For since 'twou'd be very trou∣blesome
to shut as many Doors as there are
<HI>Franks</HI> in the Town, all those who bear that Name
are oblig'd to lodge in certain spacious <HI>Hans,</HI> call'd
<HI>Fondies,</HI> which having but one Gate or Door, are
<PB N="201" REF="120"/>
quickly secur'd. The <HI>French, English,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>
have each a distinct <HI>Han,</HI> where they live, without
medling in the least with one another's business,
either in Peace or War. The Merchants who re∣side
here are for the most part only Factors to an∣swer
the Commissions of their Correspondents in
<HI>Christendom:</HI> Nor can this City be reckon'd as a
place of Commerce, unless by the bye, for no con∣siderable
<HI>Caravans</HI> come hither, and <HI>Aleppo</HI> is pro∣perly
the Seat of Trade, and Residence of the
Consuls.</P>
<P>The famous City of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> admir'd in for∣mer
Ages for its Extent and Beauty, is now a
wretched heap of Cottages, that seem to have been
built on purpose to insult over the deplorable fate
of the Ruins on which they are founded. There
cannot be a more lively Instance of the frailty of
human Grandeur, than those rich Fragments of
<HI>Marble, Porphyry,</HI> and <HI>Granite,</HI> that are every where
to be seen mixt with Earth, Wood, and Stone.
The whole City is as it were buri'd under the Ruines
of overturn'd Palaces; and 'tis impossible to be∣hold
that magnificent Rubbish, without reflecting
with a certain Melancholic Pleasure on the ancient
Splendor of these celebrated Structures. But since
I have reason to believe that such general Remarks
wou'd not satisfie your Curiosity, I shall proceed to
give you a more particular account of the admi∣rable
Remains of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by the Walls (which are not so rui∣nous
as the Houses) that the compass of the City
amounted to Ten Miles: But they are infinitely
more remarkable for their Beauty and Magnifi∣cence,
than for the largeness of their Extent.
They are 20 Foot thick throughout, and join'd
with a certain Cement as hard as Stone: From
space to space they are flank'd with great square
Towers, which are so strong and massive that they
<PB N="202" REF="121"/>
appear like so many Castles; and within each
Tower there are Cisterns, Halls, and a sufficient
number of Chambers to lodge at least 100 Men.
But, which is still more convenient and useful,
there are Casemates under the Walls round the
whole City, in which, together with the Towers,
there was room enough to lodge 50000 Men, who
were always ready either to appear in Arms on the
Walls in case of necessity, or to march upon occa∣sion
to any place in the City. The Walls are also
surrounded with good False-brays, which are still
entire; and if you add to these a broad, deep, and
well-lin'd Ditch, I think there cou'd not be more
desir'd in that Age, for the security and defence of
any City.</P>
<P>Among all the ruinous Beauties of <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
there is none more remarkable than <HI>Caesar's Palace.</HI>
'Twas certainly a very large Building, and if I may
be allow'd to judge of the rest by the Front which
remains still entire, I may venture to assure you that
'twas a noble and compleat Work. I observ'd also
several Columns of <HI>Pophyry</HI> and spotted <HI>Green Marble,</HI>
which heighten'd the Idea I had already conceiv'd
of its Magnificence. Near these stately Ruines
there are others equal to 'em in all respects, and no
less rich in <HI>Porphyry</HI> and <HI>Granite,</HI> which are said to
be Fragments of the Ancient Palace of the <HI>Ptolomies:</HI>
Besides a great number of others as admirable as ei∣ther
of the former. But 'tis so long since the City
was demolish'd, and the confusion is so great at pre∣sent,
that 'tis impossible for the most curious Anti∣quary
to distinguish the Foundations of so many
Palaces and Temples. The only entire pieces that
have escap'd the common Fate of the rest, are the
<HI>Column of Pompey,</HI> and four <HI>Obelisks</HI> of <HI>Granite.</HI>
'Tis said the first was erected by <HI>Caesar,</HI> to the Me∣mory
of <HI>Pompey:</HI> Some think 'tis a kind of <HI>Marble,</HI>
but others incline rather to believe that 'twas built
<PB N="203" REF="121"/>
of <HI>melted Stone,</HI> cast in Moulds upon the place.
The latter Opinion seems most probable, for there
is not the least piece of that Stone to be found in
any part of the World, and the Pillar is so prodi∣giously
big and high, that it cou'd hardly be erected
without a Miracle. I know 'tis alledg'd by those
who believe the Story of the <HI>Rhodian Colossus,</HI> that
the Ancients had the advantage of admirable Ma∣chines
to raise such bulky Pieces: But I shou'd
reckon my self extreamly oblig'd to these Gentle∣men,
if they wou'd show me any probable reason
why among so great a variety of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monu∣ments
of Antiquity there is not one of <HI>Marble,</HI>
and by what an accountable accident the Stone
call'd <HI>Granite,</HI> which was then so common, is now
grown so scarce, that the most curious Inquirers
into the Works of Nature cannot find the least
Fragment of it; that was not employ'd in ancient
Structures. And even tho' I shou'd suppose with
my Adversaries, that the Quarries out of which this
Stone was dug were by degrees so entirely exhau∣sted,
that there is not the least Footstep of 'em
left; and that Nature her self has lost so much of
ancient Vigour and Fecundity, that she is not able
to produce new ones: I may still be allow'd to ask
why <HI>Granite</HI> was only us'd in Obelisks or Columns
of a prodigious bigness: For if it were really a sort
of Stone or <HI>Marble,</HI> I see no reason why we might
not find small pieces of it, as well as of <HI>Porphyry,</HI>
and other precious kinds of <HI>Marble.</HI> These reflecti∣ons,
in my Opinion, may serve to confirm the
Hypothesis of those who believe that all these ad∣mirable
Monuments were actually cast in a Mould:
And if they wou'd take the pains to view this Co∣lumn
attentively, they wou'd soon be convinc'd by
the testimony of their own Eyes, that 'tis only a
kind of Cement, compos'd of Sand and calcin'd
Stone, not unlike to Mortar or Lime, which grew
<PB N="204" REF="122"/>
hard by degrees. I will not pretend to determine
by what Artifice those ancient Workmen kept the
Cement from yielding or sliding till the Pillar was
compleated; tho' perhaps it might be probably
alledg'd, that they made a Mould of Stone or
Wood, besmear'd on the Inside with some fat or
unctuous Substance, to hinder the Matter from
sticking to its cover; and that after the Work was
finish'd, and the Column almost dry, they broke
the Mould that preserv'd the regularity of its Fi∣gure,
and kept it from falling.</P>
<P>This Column is 80 Foot high, and 24 in com∣pass:
'Tis plac'd on a Marble Pedestal eight Foot
square, and crown'd at the top with a Chapiter of
the same <HI>Granite,</HI> of which the Pillar consists. I
know not what Opinion you may have of the An∣cient
Engines, but for my part I must confess,
whether I consider the weight or bulk of so vast a
Mass, I find it equally impossible to conceive that
it cou'd be rais'd by the strongest and best contriv'd
Machines that ever were Invented. The four <HI>Obe∣lisks</HI>
are also of <HI>Granite,</HI> and adorn'd with Hiero∣glyphic
Figures in <HI>Relief,</HI> like that at <HI>Rome:</HI> Some
of 'em are standing, and the rest fall'n.</P>
<P>I cannot comprehend the reason that mov'd the
Founders of <HI>Alexandria</HI> to chuse such an uninhabi∣table
Country for the Seat of so stately a City.
The Heat is so insupportable in the Summer that it
makes all the Inhabitants as Tawny as they can pos∣sibly
be, without being quite Black. And, which
is still more incommodious, they have no Foun∣tains
to qualifie the scorching Heat of the Climate:
For the only Springs in <HI>Egypt</HI> are two that are at <HI>Cairo,</HI>
of which I may perhaps give you an account, after
I have seen 'em. To supply, in some measure, these
natural defects, the Natives have contriv'd subter∣raneous
Buildings, which are no less admirable than
the Palaces that formerly adorn'd <HI>Alexandria.</HI> For
<PB N="205" REF="122"/>
there are vast Cisterns under Ground, Vaulted and
under-prop'd with strong <HI>Marble</HI>-Pillars that sup∣port
the weight of the Houses, and of the City,
which is wholly built on these Caves. All the
Cisterns are border'd with Streets, as if they were
Houses, so that they seem to form a subterraneous
City.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of the <HI>Roman Catacombs,</HI>
tho' they are much inferiour in beauty to the <HI>A∣lexandrian</HI>
Cisterns: For the former are narrow, low,
and unadorn'd; whereas the latter are spacious,
enrich'd with <HI>Marble,</HI> and in some parts with <HI>Por∣phyry:</HI>
These Cisterns were fill'd with Water at the
overflowing of the <HI>Nile,</HI> by a large Canal call'd
<HI>Khaalis,</HI> which still brings Water from the River,
for the use of those few Inhabitants that are left in
the City. The Canal is border'd with Gardens,
which are not beautiful, tho' they contain a vast
number of very large <HI>Orange, Citron,</HI> and <HI>Limon</HI>-Trees.</P>
<P>If you reflect on the usual Custom of the <HI>Romans,</HI>
to imitate the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in every thing, you will
find your self oblig'd to acknowledge that 'tis at least
a probable conjecture, that the <HI>Catacombs</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI>
were built after the Model of certain large Caves,
without the Walls of this City towards the Palace.
These subterraneous Vaults are fifteen Foot square,
and eight or ten Foot high: And there are Tombs
in the Walls cut out of the Rock, like those in the
<HI>Roman Catacombs,</HI> but more artificially contriv'd,
and rank'd in better Order, in which there are
many entire Skeletons, tho' tis perhaps above 2000
Years since they were laid there. The Entry of
the Caves is very low and narrow, for you must
creep into a little hole, and slide several paces
downward before you come to the Vaults.</P>
<P>This Country is Inhabited by a medley of se∣veral
Nations; natural <HI>Turks, Moors, Arabs, Greeks,</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="123"/>
and <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Arabs</HI> are generally Free-booters,
infesting the Roads, and rifling all the Passengers
without Mercy, so that 'tis extreamly dangerous to
Travel without a numerous Company. Yet there
are some of that Nation who live in the Cities, and
are more Civil than their Country-men in the
Fields: But they all pretend to be Magicians, and
are so intoxicated with such Chimera's, that one
wou'd almost think they were seiz'd with a sort of
Epidemical Madness. They have several ways of
Divination; for some of 'em pretend to <HI>Inspiration,</HI>
others Prophecy by <HI>Visions,</HI> and there are some who
throw <HI>Beans</HI> into a Bag, and after they have coun∣ted
'em, return answers to those who consult 'em.
Among all these Fortune-Tellers, those who Divine
by way of <HI>Vision,</HI> are reckon'd the most skilful, and
are fewest in number: As for the rest, the Streets
are full of 'em. I have heard several Instances of
their Predictions, both in <HI>Christendom,</HI> and in this
Countrey, without giving Credit to any of 'em,
because they were for the most part only second∣hand
Stories: But I'm extreamly puzl'd what to
think of an account I had from the Master of our
Ship, for my Author is a Man of Honour, and
part of the Matter of fact is attested by all the
<HI>French-men</HI> in <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The Story is this.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Carbonneau,</HI> Master of the Ship, call'd
<HI>St. Augustin,</HI> bound for this City, was entrusted at
<HI>Marseilles</HI> with a Bag of 200 <HI>Piasters</HI> of <HI>Sevil,</HI> which
he receiv'd without counting 'em, and oblig'd him∣self
to make good the Summ. At his Arrival he
deliver'd the Bag to the Person to whom it was
directed, who told the Money immediately, and
finding 50 <HI>Piasters</HI> wanting, refus'd to receive it,
and entred an Action against the Captain for the
Overplus. In the mean time <HI>Carbonneau</HI> made a
diligent search on Board his Ship, to discover who
had stoln the 50 <HI>Piasters;</HI> for he suspected his
<PB N="207" REF="123"/>
Clerk and Surgeon as the only Persons who had en∣ter'd
his Chamber: But finding that all his Inquiries
were unsuccessful, he resolv'd to consult an <HI>Arabian
Sooth-sayer,</HI> who was of the <HI>Visionary</HI> Tribe, and re∣puted
very skilful. After some time spent in Cere∣monious
Grimaces, the <HI>Arab</HI> told him, that he saw
a Man, whose Person he describ'd, tell 150 <HI>Piasters</HI>
into a Bag of strip'd Ticking, and afterwards tye
it up. The Captain perceiv'd that these Circum∣stances
agreed exactly to the Bag and the Person
who gave it him; but not being entirely satisfi'd,
he entreated the Diviner to tell him positively, whe∣ther
there were only 150 <HI>Piasters</HI> put into the Bag,
or 50 of 'em afterwards taken out. After some
new Ceremonies, the <HI>Sooth-sayer</HI> told him, that he
saw the same Person endeavour to put 200 <HI>Piasters</HI>
into the Bag, which not being large enough to
hold them all, there remain'd 20 that cou'd not be
put in for want of room. 'Tis plain then, added
he, that the compleat Summ neither was nor cou'd
be put into the Bag: And if you make the Expe∣riment,
you'll be convinc'd of the truth of what
I say. Nor was he mistaken, for 'twas found up∣on
trial, that the Bag was not large enough to
contain 200 <HI>Piasters,</HI> and <HI>Carbonneau</HI>'s Adversary
was so honest as to put a stop to the Action. This
accident made a great noise among those of our
Nation; and the Captain was so extreamly sur∣priz'd
at his Fortune-Teller's Skill, that some days
before his departure, he went again to consult him
concerning the Success of his Voyage. The <HI>Arab</HI>
answer'd, that he saw neither Fight, Ship-wrack,
nor Arrival, but only four Mariners, whom he
describ'd, carrying Fire in their hands; and there∣fore
advis'd him to have an Eye upon 'em, and to
prevent any accidents that might happen in his Ves∣sel.
Six days after the Captain having put out to
Sea, and intending to set Sail the next Morning,
<PB N="208" REF="124"/>
the four Seamen, whom the <HI>Arabian</HI> represented,
smoaking Tabacco between the Decks, set Fire to
some Bales of Wool that were part of the Lading,
and the Ship was entirely consum'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> were formerly very Learned, espe∣cially
in <HI>Medicine,</HI> and our <HI>European</HI> Surgeons have
found very useful Secrets in their Books: But at
present they apply themselves wholly to Divination,
which, in their Opinion, is the only sublime Sci∣ence.
They are perfect Strangers to the knowledge
of Religion, and their only Trade is to Rob Pas∣sengers:
Nevertheless, it must be acknowledg'd to
their praise, that they kill none but <HI>Turks,</HI> and
these only when they are disoblig'd by the <HI>Grand
Signior.</HI> They are divided into Tribes, commanded
by their particular <HI>Captains,</HI> who are all subject to
a kind of <HI>Duke</HI> or <HI>Prince,</HI> whom they call <HI>Skeick el
Kebir.</HI> They Encamp in the Deserts, where they
spend their whole Lives; for when they have con∣sum'd
the Grass in one place they remove to ano∣ther.
They are lean and black; their Aspect is
Grim and terrible: They are usually cloath'd with
the Skins of wild Beasts, and feed upon Milk, But∣ter,
Honey, and sometimes a little Camel's Flesh
parch'd in the Sun-Beams, or Roasted in the Em∣bers:
But when they go out on Parties to Attack
<HI>Caravans,</HI> or private Travellers, they carry no
other Provisions but a little Flesh, which they lay
under 'em upon their Horse's backs till it grows hot
and tender.</P>
<P>They have the best Horses in the World, for
they are incredibly swift, and will ride a whole
day without tyring. 'Tis the Custom of the <HI>Ara∣bians</HI>
to Gallop perpetually, without stopping to
Dine: At Night they tye their Horses to Stakes,
and feed 'em with Milk, Flesh, and Wheat, as they
do themselves. They esteem a good Horse above
all things in the World; and to prevent Deceits,
<PB N="209" REF="124"/>
they keep their Pedigrees in Writing. When they
have occasion to sell or exchange a Horse, they
produce his Genealogy, proving him to be lineally
descended from such a Stallion and Mare of illu∣strious
Memory.</P>
<P>This wandring Nation owes the preservation of
its Liberties to the weakness of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI>
and of the <HI>Bassa</HI>'s of <HI>Cairo</HI> and <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who not only
connive at 'em, but gratifie the <HI>Sheck el Kebir</HI> with
a Pension, which very much resembles Tribute;
For upon the least delay of Payment, they burn and
pillage the Country in so barbarous a manner, that
I cannot give you a livelier <HI>Idea</HI> of the havock they
make on such occasions, than by putting you in
mind of the <HI>French</HI> Campaign in the <HI>Palatinate.</HI></P>
<P>I have done with the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and shall in the
next place proceed to give you a brief Account of
the <HI>Turks</HI> that live in <HI>Egypt,</HI> before I finish my Let∣ter.
They are so extreamly Superstitious, that
when they go abroad in the Morning, if the first
Person they meet be a <HI>Christian,</HI> they return im∣mediately,
and having wash'd themselves, stay at
home all the rest of the day; for they believe that
some great Misfortune wou'd certainly befall 'em,
if they shou'd venture to go abroad again.</P>
<P>Their hatred and scorn to all that profess the
Faith of Christ, is extended even to the <HI>Franks,</HI>
who meet with a thousand Indignities, which
the <HI>Greeks</HI> themselves can hardly bear. For not to
mention the Custom of Imprisoning us every Night,
we are not permitted to appear on Horseback in
the City, but are oblig'd to ride on Asses; and if
a <HI>Frank</HI> were found taking a particular view of a
Fortification, 'twou'd cost him at least 500 <HI>Piasters,</HI>
and he might reckon himself very Fortunate if he
escap'd with so mild a Correction. 'Tis still a more
hainous Crime to enter into a Mosquee, and wou'd
be punish'd with greater Severity: And therefore
<PB N="210" REF="125"/>
I hope you will not expect that I shou'd acquaint
you whether the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Mosquees are different
from those of <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>I have already told you, that the Men of this
Country are very black; but I'm inform'd, that the
Women are not tann'd in the least with that Co∣lour,
so careful are they to preserve their Com∣plexions,
and to keep themselves out of the reach
of the Sun. I cou'd tell you some very diverting
Stories of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Women, if I were fully
convinc'd of the truth of 'em. 'Tis true, my Au∣thors
are very positive, but the Thing is so odd, that
I dare hardly venture to relate it upon their Credit;
and especially in this case, I shou'd be glad I cou'd
speak as an Eye-witness. However, Sir, since the
mentioning of the Subject may perhaps raise your
Curiosity, 'twou'd be ill Manners to take leave of
you without giving you some account of it.</P>
<P>I'm inform'd there are Schools here where Maids
learn to give and receive the Pleasures of Love with
more than ordinary delight. This pretty Art is
taught by Women, who acting the part of Men,
make their fair Scholars exercise the most lascivious
Postures imaginable. Maids of Quality are in∣structed
at home, and I'm assur'd that this is an
Accomplishment which usually recommends young
Ladies to the most advantageous Matches.</P>
<P>I intend to Embark to morrow on a <HI>Tartane</HI> of
<HI>Marseilles,</HI> bound for <HI>Cairo.</HI> I'm extreamly afraid
of the Mouth of <HI>Damieta,</HI> for they say 'tis very dan∣gerous.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot express my Amazement at the sight of
those stately Monuments that make <HI>Cairo</HI> the
most admirable City in the World, and convince
the Beholder of so many Wonders, that the ancient
Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> were the most powerful Monarchs
in the Universe. We are usually fill'd with a high
Idea of the <HI>Roman</HI> Grandeur, because we view it at a
less distance: But how vastly inferiour are the <HI>Pantheon,
Collieseum, Capitol,</HI> and all the other celebrated Stru∣ctures
of <HI>Rome,</HI> to these Magnificent Sepulchres
which have for so many Ages stood firm against all
the Attacks of Time and Age, and piercing the
Sky with their lofty Tops, seem to be Copies of
the Tower of <HI>Babel.</HI> At least 'tis plain, that the
Founders of these <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monuments were acted
by the same Designs that mov'd <HI>Nimrod</HI> to erect
that famous Tower. They saw that all things were
subject to the irresistible Power of Fate, which de∣stroys
in a Moment the most illustrious and potent
Empires, and annihilates even the Memory of their
Grandeur. Their Souls were too elevated to sub∣mit
to the common Destiny of other Mortals; and
the sublimity of their Courage inspir'd 'em with
the noble and glorious Resolution of making them∣selves
Immortal in spite of Death. This was the
design of those <HI>Egyptian</HI> Hero's, and 'tis to their
Heroical Ambition that we owe the Possession of
these Wonders of the World. How often do I wish
you had been an Eye-witness and Partaker of my
Happiness, when I stood gazing on so many Beau∣ties
that are not to be found any where else, and
<PB N="212" REF="126"/>
might justifie the Curiosity of a Traveller, tho' he
shou'd come from the remotest part of the Uni∣verse
to admire 'em.</P>
<P>These Monuments are of several kinds, but there
are none so admirably magnificent as the <HI>Pyramids,</HI>
which are so highly celebrated by ancient Histori∣ans.
Two of the three principal Pyramids are shut,
the other which appears biggest is open: 'Tis seated
(I mean the last) very near the other two, three
Leagues from <HI>Cairo,</HI> if that name be confin'd to the
<HI>New</HI> City, or two Leagues and a half, taking in the
<HI>Old.</HI> 'Tis a vast artificial Mountain, compos'd of
Free-Stones of different bigness; for we cannot
suppose it possible, that there cou'd have been a
sufficient quantity of Stones found exactly of the
same Dimensions, for the building of so prodigious
a Mass; but the smallest are a Foot thick, and
two Foot long; some being three Foot thick, six
long, and four broad. Its heighth amounts to
520 Feet, and the breadth of each Face to 682.</P>
<P>The Ascent consists of between 200 and 210 Steps.
The Top appears like the point of a Spire to those
that are below; but when they go up to it, they
are surpriz'd to find a Platform 24 Foot square;
and their Wonder is still encreas'd, when they ob∣serve
that so large a space is pav'd only with 12
Stones; for 'tis hardly conceivable how Stones of
that Bulk cou'd be rais'd to so vast a heighth.
From thence you have the Prospect of <HI>Boulac,</HI> old
and new <HI>Cairo,</HI> the Ruines of <HI>Memphis,</HI> the Moun∣tain
and the Desarts of <HI>Egypt:</HI> But he who can
look to the bottom of the Steps without Amaze∣ment,
may justly boast of the strength of his Head;
for my part, I must confess I was struck with so
much horror when I cast my Eye downward, that
I was hardly sensible of any Pleasure in viewing so
great a variety of Objects. There were formerly
Steps on every side, but Time that consumes all
<PB N="213" REF="126"/>
things has so wasted some of the Stones, that in se∣veral
Parts there are dreadful Precipices; and
therefore Strangers dare not venture to ascend with∣out
the assistance of Guides that are acquainted
with the safest ways. At the bottom of the Pyra∣mid
there is a heap of Sand that reaches to the six∣teenth
step, where there is a little door, thro' which
(after you have drunk a refreshing Cup) you may
enter into a sort of descending Alley, 30 paces
long, about three Foot and a half high, and of
equal breadth, so that a Man cannot walk in it
without bowing his Body extreamly. At the end
of this Alley you must lie down upon your Belly,
and creep thro' a little Wicket, which is even with
the Ground, and brings you into another little
Alley like the former, only in this you must ascend,
whereas you descended in the other. This Alley
ends in two others; that on the Right-hand has
no inclination, and leads to a little Vaulted Cham∣ber
18 Foot long, and 12 broad. At the entrance
into this Alley there is a very deep Pit or Well
without Water: Some Travellers go down into it,
but I did not follow their Example: For I thought
I had already done enough to satisfie my Curiosity,
by creeping thro' those Caves which are darker
than Hell it self, and in all respects a fit Habitation
for the Dead. Besides, they are so full of Bats
that flutter about perpetually, and blow out the
Candles, that 'twou'd be very dangerous to venture
in without a Tinder-Box. Directly opposite to the
last Alley, there is another which begins so high in
the Wall, that we were forc'd to climb up to it;
but to make amends for that inconveniency, 'tis
much higher and broader than any of the rest.
After I had walk'd 70 Paces, still ascending, I
found a sort of Hall 32 Foot long, and 16 broad,
pav'd with nine Stones, the length of which is equal
to the breadth of the Room. The Walls are of
<PB N="214" REF="127"/>
a very fine and precious kind of <HI>Porphyry;</HI> and at
one end there is an empty Tomb of the same <HI>Por∣phyry,</HI>
seven Foot long and three broad.</P>
<P>I went afterwards to take a view of the two
other Pyramids, the least (and according to all ap∣pearances
the most ancient) of which was formerly
over-laid with <HI>Porphyry.</HI> 'Tis only 150 Foot high,
and each of its Sides or Faces is 200 Foot broad.
The common Opinion is, That 'twas Founded by
a Young Woman call'd <HI>Rhodope,</HI> who was <HI>Aesop</HI>'s
Fellow-Slave in <HI>Egypt;</HI> and that the Munificence
of her Lovers enabl'd her to build so vast a Work.
The other is almost as great as the first; for its
height amounts to 510 Feet, and the breadth of
each Face to 630. These three Pyramids are of a
quadrilateral Figure, and I observ'd the Ruines of
an ancient Temple before each of 'em; for 'tis not
at all probable, that there were ever any Palaces in
that Place; and the huge <HI>Idol</HI> of Stone that stands
very near those decay'd Structures, is, I think, an
evident confirmation of the truth of my Con∣jecture.
The People of the Country say, that
'twas heretofore famous for Oracles, and I believe
'tis no fabulous Tradition; for there is a very deep
Hole in the Head of the Idol, where the Priests
might lie conceal'd, and return answers to those
who came to propose Questions. 'Tis a <HI>Colossus</HI> cut
in the Rock, representing a Woman, and is 26
Foot high, tho' it scarce reaches down to her Bo∣som,
so that 'tis one of the most monstrous Figures
in the World.</P>
<P>Three hours Journey from thence there is a Vil∣lage
call'd <HI>Sacara,</HI> in which there are <HI>Catacombs</HI> or
Sepulchral Vaults, but of a different Contrivance
from those at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Alexandria.</HI> For these are
distinct subterraneous Chambers, built of Free-Stone,
without the least Communication between
one another: There is an opening above, thro'
<PB N="215" REF="127"/>
which you are either let down with a Rope, as into
a Well, or must go down a Ladder, according to
the various Depth of the Caves. They were here∣tofore
full of the Bodies of ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> so
skilfully embalm'd, that they were preserv'd entire,
perhaps above 4000 Years, with their Epitaphs,
Coffins, and curious and magnificent Dresses. The
Coffins were enrich'd with <HI>Hieroglyphics,</HI> and the
Figure of the Deceas'd in <HI>Relievo;</HI> and sometimes
there were Idols and Jewels found in 'em. But the
Curiosity of the <HI>Franks</HI> has at last exhausted 'em;
tho' 'tis thought there are some that were never
open'd, and that the difficulty of finding 'em pro∣ceeds
from the Avarice of the <HI>Moors,</HI> who only
know where they are, and keep the Price of such
Rarities very high. Yet I made 'em let me down
into two or three, where I saw some Pieces of <HI>Mum∣my,</HI>
but so spoil'd, that 'twas impossible to preserve
any of 'em.</P>
<P>This Place is so full of <HI>Pyramids,</HI> that I believe
there are above a hundred; but they are not com∣parable
to those I mention'd. Yet I observ'd one
that wou'd be as big as the first, if it were finish'd:
there are also ascending and descending Alleys in it,
at the end of which there are three Rooms in dif∣ferent
Places. I will not trouble you with a De∣scription
of it, since the only remarkable Difference
between it and the first, is, that this is only rais'd to
half the intended Heighth, if I may judge by its
Proportion to the rest, whereas that is compleatly
finish'd.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the <HI>Nile,</HI> directly opposite
to this Place, are the Ruines of the ancient City of
<HI>Memphis,</HI> extended along the River, till you come
overagainst <HI>Old Cairo.</HI> They are so confus'd at present,
that I spent half a Day in viewing 'em, without
finding any thing remarkable.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="128"/>
I confess, Sir, that in pursuance of the Niceties
of an exact Method, I shou'd have made you ac∣quainted
with the City of <HI>Cairo,</HI> before I had car∣ry'd
you to visit the Rarities in its Neighbourhood.
But I cou'd not forbear giving the first place to that
which I most admir'd; and besides an Account of
<HI>Cairo</HI> will be as useful and perhaps as acceptable to
you at the End, as in the Beginning of my Let∣ter.</P>
<P>The Observation I made concerning the Variety
of Opinions about the Extent of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> is
equally applicable to this City, which is divided in∣to
three Parts, <HI>Boulac,</HI> and <HI>Old,</HI> and <HI>New Cairo.</HI>
Some Travellers scruple to comprehend these three
Towns under one Name, because they are separated
by Gardens and Fields: but if those Gentlemen
were to write to an Inhabitant of any of these Di∣visions,
they wou'd certainly direct their Letters to
<HI>Cairo,</HI> and not to <HI>Boulac,</HI> &amp;c. And 'tis as imperti∣nent
a Piece of Nicety to make a Distinction be∣tween
Places that are divided by so small a Distance;
as 'twou'd be absurd and improper, according to that
Opinion, to give the City the Title of <HI>Grand Cairo.</HI>
But not to trouble you with more Arguments, I
shall only tell you that I think fit to join all the
three Parts together; and that in this Sense <HI>Cairo</HI>
contains four large Hours Journey in Length, and
twelve in Compass.</P>
<P>'Twas taken from the <HI>Soldans</HI> of <HI>Egypt, Ann.</HI> 1517.
by <HI>Sultan Selim</HI> I. who put to death all the <HI>Mamme∣lucks</HI>
with their <HI>Soldan:</HI> and since that it has been
still subject to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who in all probability will
not be soon nor easily driven out of it. 'Tis the
<HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the most considerable Bassa∣ship
in <HI>Turkey:</HI> and since 'tis a City of a vast Ex∣tent,
the three Parts that compose it are differently
situated. <HI>Boulac</HI> is the Port of <HI>Cairo</HI> on the <HI>Nile,</HI>
and is alone as large as <HI>Rennes</HI> in <HI>Bretagne,</HI> or the
<PB N="217" REF="128"/>
<HI>Hague</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> The <HI>New</HI> City lies further in the
Country, at the Foot of a great Hill, and the <HI>Old
Cairo</HI> a little beyond it, on the Banks of the <HI>Nile.</HI>
Thus the <HI>New</HI> City is depriv'd of the advanta∣geous
Neighbourhood of the River, and receives
all its Water by a <HI>Khaalis</HI> or Canal, like that of
<HI>Alexandria.</HI> All the rest of the Cities of <HI>Egypt</HI> are
also furnish'd with such Aqueducts, without which
they wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be wholly destitute of Water. This is
the Inconveniency, or rather the Misery of the
Country; for the Heat is very troublesome during
the Summer: and so much the more insupportable,
because all the Ground is cover'd with Sand, which
grows burning hot, and makes the Air so sultry,
that one can scarce breathe in it. Judge, Sir, what
a Pleasure 'twou'd be in that Season, to drink a
Cup of cold and fresh Water; and yet the poor In∣habitants
must content themselves with the nasty
Puddle that has stood about a Year in the Cisterns,
or (which is almost as bad) with the Water that
is carry'd about the Streets to be sold in Pitchers
made of Goats Skins, by the <HI>Moors.</HI> For the <HI>Khaa∣lis</HI>
is dry for the Space of six Months, and begins
not to be fill'd till the Month of <HI>August,</HI> when the
<HI>Nile</HI> is almost come to its greatest Heighth. Then
they cut the Dam or Bank, that kept out the Wa∣ter,
which immediately gushes into the Canal, and
continues to flow during the Encrease of the River,
that is, till near the End of <HI>October,</HI> after which it
decreases by degrees. The Day of the Opening of
the <HI>Khaalis</HI> is observ'd in this City as a Festival, with
extraordinary Marks of Joy: but since I have nei∣ther
seen, nor am like to see that Ceremony, you
may consult some other Travellers for an Account
of it. The <HI>Khaalis</HI> passes thro' the <HI>New</HI> City, and
fills a vast number of Cisterns and Basons for Gar∣dens.
The Inundation of the <HI>Nile</HI> is the only Cause
of the Fruitfulness of <HI>Egypt;</HI> for without that
<PB N="218" REF="129"/>
'twou'd be one vast Desart, as those Parts are, which
are depriv'd of that Advantage by reason of their
Distance from the River. These Floods, which are
occasion'd by the Melting of the Snow in the Moun∣tains,
fatten the Soil more effectually than the best
Dung in the World cou'd possibly do: and indeed
those Spots of Ground that are wash'd by the Inun∣dation
are admirably fertil. I cannot leave this Sub∣ject
without taking Notice of the Vulgar Errour,
That it never <HI>rains</HI> in this Country; for during the
little time I have spent in it, I have observ'd some
Showers; tho' I must confess it rains not so frequent∣ly
here as in other Countries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nile</HI> is very near as broad as the <HI>Rhine:</HI> it
crosses the whole Country of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and during
the time of its Inundation, it overflows for the space
of two Months, all the neighbouring Fields, which
only are inhabited, the rest of the Land being co∣ver'd
with dry and burning Sands. It falls into the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI> by two Mouths, about 80 Miles di∣stant.
'Tis famous over all the World for its <HI>Cro∣codiles,</HI>
and it must be acknowledg'd that it contains
a great number of very large ones, but they are
neither venomous, nor so terrible as they are usu∣ally
represented.</P>
<P>If I shou'd tell you that there are 23000 <HI>Mosquees</HI>
in this City, you'd certainly laugh at my Credulity,
that cou'd swallow such a monstrous Fable. How∣ever,
Sir, 'tis held by all the Inhabitants as a most
certain Truth; and they are no less firmly persua∣ded
that there are as many distinct Quarters or
Wards, containing several Streets each, according
to which Computation there are at least 100000
<HI>Streets</HI> in the City. 'Tis true, they are extremely
small and narrow, but I dare not positively assure
you that there is such a prodigious Number of 'em,
especially since I never counted 'em. 'Tis also said
that when the Plague rages in this Place, it sweeps
<PB N="219" REF="129"/>
away 10000 Persons a-day; nor do I think this
Story so incredible as the other: for the City is ex∣tremely
populous, and there is as great a Concourse
of People at the <HI>Bazar</HI> or Market every <HI>Thursday,</HI> as
at the most crowded Fairs in <HI>Europe.</HI> This <HI>Bazar</HI> is the
only to lerable Street in <HI>Cairo,</HI> and the <HI>Besestin</HI> at one
of the Ends of it is at least as fine and rich as that
of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> At the other End there is a Market
of Slaves, where a Man may be always accommodated
with a pretty Girl, at the Rate of 100 or 150 <HI>Pi∣asters.</HI>
All the Houses are of Wood, with Plat∣forms
on the Top, after the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fashion: The
Outside is as mean, as the Inside is said to be beau∣tiful.
'Tis true, I never view'd 'em within, and
therefore will not desire you to believe that they
deserve the last part of that Character; for it de∣pends
entirely upon the Testimony of the <HI>Franks,</HI>
who are guilty of an unaccountable Prejudice, in
magnifying the <HI>Turkish</HI> Magnificence. This is cer∣tainly
a very great and inexcusable Weakness; and
I know not whether it is more unreasonable to ad∣mire
all things or nothing. We ought indeed to do
Justice to every thing that is either Good or Beauti∣ful:
but I know no Reason that obliges us to extoll
the most ordinary Beauty, or rather Deformity it
self, especially in a Place that may justly boast of
so many incomparable Wonders, among which I
may venture to reckon the ancient and vast Castle
of <HI>Cairo.</HI> 'Tis true, it may be said to be a mere
Heap of inhabited Ruines: but these Ruines are ex∣tremely
Magnificent, and suitable to the Glory and
Power of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> who is reputed to be the Foun∣der
both of this Structure, and of the great open
Pyramid. It stands directly in the Middle of the
City, between the <HI>Old</HI> aud <HI>New</HI> Town, on so large
and steep a Rock, that one wou'd think it was pur∣posely
fram'd by Nature to secure and command
<HI>Grand Cairo.</HI> 'Tis above two Miles in Compass, and
<PB N="220" REF="130"/>
was formerly surrounded with thick Walls, like
those of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> flank'd at the end of every
hundred Paces with great and very strong Towers.
It has four Gates which lead into a fine open Place,
and from thence to several Streets; so that it seems
rather to be a Town than a Castle. The <HI>Turks</HI> have
profan'd these venerable Monuments, by disfigu∣ring
'em with their Cottages, which look like so
many Rats-Nests. Some Parts of <HI>Pharaoh's Palace</HI>
remain still to be seen: The Room call'd <HI>Joseph's
Hall,</HI> is enrich'd with Gold and Azure, and adorn'd
with thirty fine Columns of Porphyry. That of
his Steward or Intendant, is not so entire, and is
only remarkable for twelve Columns of <HI>Thebaic</HI>
Marble, which are not much inferiour to the for∣mer
in Beauty. But the entirest and most admirable
Work in this Place, is the celebrated <HI>Well</HI> of <HI>Joseph.</HI>
'Tis cut or hollow'd in the hard Rock, a hundred
and six Foot deep, of a square Figure, each Side
containing eleven Feet, without reckn'ning the Stair-Case,
which is seven Foot broad, and cut out of the
same Rock. It turns round the Well, and consists
of twelve several Windings, six of which contain
eighteen Steps a-piece, and the other six, nineteen;
so that the total Number of the Steps amounts to
to Two hundred twenty two. The Stairs are so
easie and commodious, that they make two Oxen
go down every day to the Bottom of the Well,
which is dry, and from thence to a little square
Room, where there is a Spring, out of which
they draw Water continually, by a certain Con∣trivance
of Wheels hung round with Buckets, that
discharge the Water into a Bason or Cistern in the
midst of the dry Pit or Well; from whence 'tis
rais'd up in Buckets fasten'd to Ropes, that are let
down and drawn up again by the turning of other
Wheels. Round the Stair-Case on the Inside there
are Walls that serve instead of Rails, and secure
<PB N="221" REF="130"/>
those that go down from falling. At the Bottom
of the Well there is a Door on the Right-hand, and
another on the Left, both cut out of the Rock: and
'tis commonly believ'd that one of 'em leads to the
Red-Sea, and the other to the Pyramids. The first
is impossible, for the Sea is above thirty Leagues di∣stant:
but the second is not at all improbable, con∣sidering
the great Works that were undertaken and
perform'd by the ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and the Care
they took to dig subterraneous Passages to secure
their Retreat in case of Necessity. 'Tis true, the
Greatness of the Distance, and Hardness of the
Rock cou'd not but make this Attempt very diffi∣cult;
but after all 'tis not near so vast a Work as
the Pyramids, and there must be some Passage that
begins at this Place: for tho' the Doors are at pre∣sent
wall'd up, 'tis plain they were design'd for some
Use. You will not be surpriz'd at the Magnificence
of this Well, nor wonder what made the <HI>Egyptians</HI>
bestow so much Time, Pains and Cost on the dig∣ging
of it, if you consider how precious and valu∣able
Water is in this Country. For (as I told
you in my last) there are but two Springs in all
<HI>Egypt,</HI> This, and That of <HI>Maltharea,</HI> of which I
shall give you some Account before I finish my Let∣ter.
And it seems the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monarchs were
afraid that these two Fountains shou'd at last be
dry'd up; for they took care to bring Water from
the <HI>Nile</HI> in a very fine Aqueduct, beginning betwixt
<HI>Old Cairo</HI> and <HI>Boulac,</HI> and reaching as far as the
Castle. Not far from <HI>Joseph's Palace</HI> there is a
dreadful <HI>Prison,</HI> consisting of several Dungeons cut
out of the Rock. It bears the Name of the same
Patriarch, because 'twas here, according to the
common Opinion, where he interpreted the Dreams
of the <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ler</HI> and <HI>Baker:</HI> if this Tradition be true,
it must be acknowledg'd, that he was in a lamen∣table
Condition, for this is certainly a very dismal
Place.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="131"/>
<HI>Maltharea</HI> is a Place about a large League distant
from the City, whither the <HI>Franks</HI> often walk to en∣joy
the pleasant Shade of its fine Orange-Trees, and
refresh themselves with its delicious Water. There is
also a little Chapel in the same place, which, 'tis said,
the <HI>Blessed Virgin</HI> chose for her Abode, when she fled
to <HI>Egypt</HI> with her Son <HI>Jesus;</HI> but the Circumstances
of the Story are so improbable, that it seems to be
of the same Stamp with other fabulous Legends.
For they pretend that while she liv'd in that little
House, perceiving at a great distance the Men whom
<HI>Herod</HI> had sent after her, and, not knowing where
to flee, an old Sycamore burst open to receive
her and the little <HI>Jesus,</HI> and closing again secur'd
'em from the Rage of their Enemies. Assoon as
the Danger was over the miraculous Tree let 'em
forth, and remain'd open ever afterwards; but 'tis
extremely decay'd at present, and part of it is fall'n
away. However I spent two Hours near it with a
great deal of Pleasure; for the Sun shone very
bright that Day, and the Verdure of the Myrtle,
Orange, and Limon-Trees was extremely agree∣able.</P>
<P>There is another little Chapel in <HI>Old Cairo,</HI> where
the Virgin resided for some time: and near that
there are large Store-houses for Corn, which are
thought to be the same that <HI>Joseph</HI> built when he
laid up Provisions against the seven Years of Fa∣mine.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have entertain'd you with an Ac∣count
of some of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Rarities. 'Tis true,
there are many other remarkable Monuments in
this Country, that are worthy of a Traveller's Cu∣riosity;
but the very Sight of those howling De∣sarts
deterr me from undertaking a Journey that
wou'd expose me to so many Dangers and Incon∣veniencies.
Besides 'twou'd require a great deal of
Money, and I begin already to perceive that I must
<PB N="223" REF="131"/>
take more than ordinary care to Husband my Stock.
I find also that the same consideration will not suf∣fer
me to prosecute my design of visiting the <HI>Holy
Land,</HI> tho' 'tis not without an extream reluctancy
that I'm forc'd to deprive my self of the fight of a
place which the Saviour of the World hallow'd with
his presence. But the Journey is prodigiously
chargeable, and I'm resolv'd to deny my self that
satisfaction rather than to put my self in a conditi∣on
that might oblige me to return to <HI>France.</HI> I in∣tend
then to Embark on a <HI>Greek Saique,</HI> which in
few days will set Sail for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where, I hope, I
may easily find an occasion for <HI>Venice.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter a very troublesome Voyage that lasted a
whole Month, I arriv'd at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> a City of
<HI>Natolia,</HI> a hundred Miles from <HI>Scio,</HI> where you
may remember I stay'd so long that I found Matter
enough for a whole Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Smyrna</HI> was formerly seated on two Mountains,
separated by a pleasant Valley that divided the City
into two Parts, one of which was not above a
quarter of a League distant from the Sea. This
Mountain is so high that you cou'd not go up or
rather climb the steep ascent in less than a full quar∣ter
of an hour: And on the top of it was a large
<PB N="224" REF="132"/>
Castle fortifi'd both by Nature and Art; for besides
the advantages of its Situation, 'twas surrounded
with high and thick Walls, on which there was a
Parapet embattel'd after the Oriental fashion; and
certainly 'tis not easily conceivable how so many
Stones cou'd be carry'd up so high. The Gate of
the Castle is defended by two round Towers join'd
to the Wall: And in the Stone-work of the Tower
that stands on the right hand as you enter, there is
a Figure of a Woman's Head and Neck, a Foot
and a half high, which is said to represent a cer∣tain
Amazon call'd <HI>Smyrna,</HI> who having Conquer'd
the City, call'd it by her own Name, and built the
Castle. The inside is a meer heap of Ruines, a∣mong
which I observ'd a very fair Cistern twenty
Paces long and twelve broad, Vaulted and sup∣ported
by six fine square Pillars which are all entire.
Besides, there is a little Chapel built like a Mosquee,
but it seems not to be very ancient. This Castle
commanded the City on one side, and the Port on
the other; and from thence you have an unob∣structed
Prospect of the Sea. 'Tis at present only
Inhabited by a <HI>Turk</HI> with his Wife and Daughter,
who is oblig'd to keep Watch, and give notice to
the Merchants when he discovers a Vessel. De∣scending
from thence we saw the Ruines of an
Amphitheater, about which there are Ditches
where the Lions were kept; and somewhat higher
are the Niches where the Magistrates sate. 'Twas
here that S. <HI>Polycarp,</HI> the first Archbishop of <HI>Smyrna</HI>
was crown'd with Martyrdom. He was one of
St. <HI>John</HI>'s Disciples, and yet even then the Schism
of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church was begun; for he was sent to
the Pope to Negotiate an Accommodation, tho'
with very little Success. The City was heretofore
very large, as it appears by the compass of its Walls;
for if any Man will give himself the trouble to
take an exact view of their Ruines, as I have done,
<PB N="225" REF="132"/>
he will be quickly convinc'd, that 'twas above
twelve Miles about: And the Error of those who
contract its Dimensions, is only an effect of their
Carelesness.</P>
<P>There is a very fine Aqueduct still to be seen,
which brought Water to the part of the City next
the Sea. It reaches from one Hill to the other, and
contains 300 Paces in length. In the same part of
the Town there are very ancient Burying-places,
which at present belong to the <HI>Jews:</HI> And adjoin∣ing
to these are the Burying-places of the <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Dutch,</HI> where there are very magnificent Marble
Tombs, enrich'd with fine <HI>Relievo's.</HI> This Place is
call'd St. <HI>Veneranda,</HI> from the Name of a <HI>Greek</HI>
Church, near which there is a Spring, fam'd for
curing Fevers miraculously; tho' I'm confident its
Vertue consists only in quenching the Thirst, which
it does very effectually, for 'tis extreamly cold and
clear, and may for that reason be reckon'd one of
the Rarities of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where the Water is generally
bad.</P>
<P>This City was ruin'd in the time of <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI>
who caus'd it to be rebuilt at the foot of the Hill on
the Sea-side, where it stands at present, stretching
in length about two short Miles, and a little above
one Mile in breadth. This situation is more con∣venient
for Trade than the former, and besides, the
Heat of the Summer is agreeably temper'd by a
cool Breeze that blows every day. But these Ad∣vantages
are counter-balanc'd by the <HI>Earthquakes</HI>
that happen so frequently in this place, and make
such a terrible havock that the Inhabitants often∣times
wish that their Town were plac'd again on
the Hill, where they think the danger wou'd not be
so great. For 'tis generally believ'd, that the Earth∣quakes
are occasion'd by the vast and deep Conca∣vities
made by the subterraneous Streams that fall
from the Mountain, where the Wind and Vapours
<PB N="226" REF="133"/>
being pent up, and endeavouring to break forth
impetuously, cause those dreadful Jolts that are felt
here so often. However I can assure you, that the
Hill is much less subject to <HI>Earthquakes</HI> than the
place where the City stands at present: For since I
came hither there happen'd four in one day, and
all of 'em strong and violent enough to strike a Ter∣ror
into those that are not accustom'd to 'em. Nor
does their frequency make 'em less dreadful to the
Inhabitants of this place; for as soon as they per∣ceive
the least shaking of the Earth they run out of
their Houses with all the signs of Fear and Amaze∣ment,
and call upon God, every one according to
the Rites of his Religion. Nor can this be justly
call'd a Panic Terror, for they were so roughly
handl'd by an <HI>Earthquake</HI> three Years ago, that I
I wonder how any of 'em durst afterwards venture
to repair their ruin'd Habitations. About Noon,
when they were all at Dinner, the Earth began to
shake so furiously as if the whole Machine of the
Universe had been falling to pieces. A thousand
Houses were over-turn'd in an Instant with a hide∣ous
dinn, and 3000 Persons were buried under the
Ruines. The rest who had the good Fortune to
escape, were seiz'd with a terrible Consternation,
and ran wildly about, not knowing whither to flee,
nor where to hide themselves; for they were still
alarm'd with repeated Jolts. And besides, the lurk∣ing
Fires that lay hid among the Ruines were fann'd
and blown up so violently by a strong Gale, which
accompany'd the <HI>Earthquake,</HI> that the Flame cou'd
not be extinguish'd for the space of two days, till
the very Rubbish of the Houses was consum'd.
Add to this dismal Spectacle the howlings of those
Wretches that were not quite kill'd by the fall of
the Houses, and you'll find your self oblig'd to ac∣knowledge,
that never any accident produc'd a
more lamentable Scene of Misery. At last the Sea∣men
<PB N="227" REF="133"/>
that were on Board the Vessels in the Port,
came a-shore, and found above 500 Persons alive
under the Ruines, some with broken Legs, and
others with broken Arms; some were bruis'd all
over, and all in general were Objects of Pity and
Compassion. The Captains of the Ships carry'd
those who were Hurt or Wounded on Board, with
the most considerable Persons of their respective
Nations: But the rest of the Inhabitants were
forc'd to lie abroad till they had prepar'd new
Lodgings, which were only some paltry Huts of
Straw. That part of the City where the <HI>Franks</HI>
live was most violently shaken, so that they were
all Sufferers, and most of 'em lost in one day the
fruit of many Years Labour. Some that had strip'd
themselves to the very Shirt to enjoy with greater
Pleasure the Coolness of the Wind, were reduc'd to
the necessity of begging Coats to cover their Na∣kedness.
As for the Societies of Merchants, tho'
they were considerable Sharers in the common Ca∣lamity,
the greatness of their Stocks kept 'em from
falling into such an excess of Misery. The <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> particularly are so rich, that they can
easily support the loss of 50000 Livres: But every
Man suffer'd proportionably to his Estate, and it
may be said that the Poor lost more than the Rich,
because they were depriv'd of their All.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Fabre</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Consul perish'd under
the Ruines, notwithstanding all the Endeavours
that were us'd to save him; and several Rich Mer∣chants
had the same Fate. Next Year the <HI>Plague</HI>
broke forth among those whom the <HI>Fire</HI> and the
<HI>Earthquake</HI> had spar'd; and the last Year may be
reckon'd as Calamitous as either of the former, by
reason of the horrible Disorders that were commit∣ted
here by the <HI>Algerines</HI> and <HI>Barbarians.</HI> Thus,
within the compass of <HI>Three Years,</HI> this City has
suffer'd <HI>Four</HI> of the severest <HI>Judgments</HI> that are usually
<PB N="228" REF="134"/>
inflicted by Heaven. These Misfortunes wou'd
have ruin'd a poor Town, but there are hardly
any Footsteps of 'em left in this; for 'tis almost
quite Rebuilt already, and the Street where the
<HI>Franks</HI> live is fairer than 'twas before.</P>
<P>This is the most considerable seat of Commerce
in the <HI>Levant,</HI> and the Dignity of the <HI>Consuls</HI> who
reside here is next to that of <HI>Ambassadors.</HI> Their
Jurisdiction is extended over <HI>Natolia, Scio, Metelin,</HI>
and several other Islands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> in which
they appoint <HI>Vice-Consuls,</HI> who govern under their
Authority. This is a very Honourable Employ∣ment,
and those who are possest of it are much re∣spected,
even by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who have as great a
Veneration for Consuls as for Ambassadors, and
receive 'em at Audiences with the same Ceremonies.
When they go thro' the Streets, the <HI>Turks</HI> draw up
in Files, and open a Passage for 'em, as for a Bassa:
Nor do they ever walk abroad without two Inter∣preters,
and as many <HI>Janisaries,</HI> who march before
'em, and serve instead of a Life-Guard; and be∣sides,
they are accompany'd with two or three
Merchants, and follow'd by their Servants in Li∣very.
But on the days of Audience their Train is
more numerous and splendid, for they are always
preceded by six Interpreters, and a like number
of <HI>Janisaries,</HI> with <HI>Zercola's</HI> on their Heads; and
follow'd by all the most considerable Persons of the
Nation, whose number sometimes amounts to above
forty. Nor does the Grandeur of this Post consist
meerly in external Pomp; for their Power is as
considerable as their State, and their Authority
over their respective Nations exceeds that of ordi∣nary
Governors, so much the more as they are far∣ther
distant from the Court. 'Tis true, that in the
management of Affairs that meerly regard Trade,
they are oblig'd to call a Meeting of the Principal
Merchants, who decide the Matter by plurality of
<PB N="229" REF="134"/>
Voices, and the Consul is only President of the
Assembly. But in all cases that relate to the admi∣nistration
of Justice or the Government of a City,
he represents the Person of the Sovereign, and is as
exactly obey'd. He is the absolute Judge of all
Suits or Actions, whether Criminal or Civil; and
has under him a <HI>Chancellor,</HI> who performs the Office
of a Clerk and Notary, a <HI>Secretary,</HI> and a <HI>Treasurer,</HI>
who receives all the Money that is sent either on
the publick Account, or by way of private Com∣mission.
The Dignity of his Function is also con∣spicuous
in the Church, where he sits in an arm'd
Chair, with a Cushion of Crimson Velvet to kneel
upon. But the main advantage of this Office is in
my Opinion the largeness of its Revenue, which
seldom or never amounts to less than 18000 <HI>French
Livres.</HI> All <HI>Franks</HI> are oblig'd at their Arrival to
address themselves to their respective Consuls, and
desire their Protection, or otherwise must expect to
be seiz'd, and sent back to their own Country.
Yet, without any regard to that Custom, I have
put my self under the Protection of Monsieur <HI>de
Hochepied,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Consul: For when I went to
see him, and acquainted him with my design, he
offer'd me that Favour with so much Generosity,
that I neither cou'd, nor was willing, to refuse it.
Nor did his Civility stop there, for he oblig'd me
to accept of a Lodging in his fine House, where I
need not be afraid of my Countrymen's Indignation.
However, to avoid any accident that might happen,
I seldom or never go abroad but in his Company,
tho', considering the kindness he expresses to me on
all occasions, I believe I might walk alone without
any danger. For he is so much honour'd, respected,
and belov'd by all the Nations who reside here,
and even by the <HI>French</HI> themselves, that there is not
one Person, small or great, who wou'd not run to
<HI>Japan,</HI> rather than disoblige him. He is usually
<PB N="230" REF="135"/>
call'd, <HI>The Consul,</HI> without any Addition, as if he
were the only Person in <HI>Smyrna</HI> who cou'd pretend
to that Character: The rest of the <HI>Consuls</HI> are
known by the Names of their respective <HI>Nations,</HI>
but he is <HI>The Consul</HI> by way of Eminency. And,
to give you a better Idea of him, I can assure you
that so universal a Love and Esteem is purely the
effect of his Merit; for he is Master of a vast Wit,
his Temper is sweet, civil, and obliging, and in one
world he is a <HI>compleat Person,</HI> which I think is the
justest and most expressive Account I can give you
of him. There are so many Perfections requir'd
to make a Man worthy of that Character, that a
<HI>Compleat</HI> Man is certainly one of the greatest Ra∣rities
of this Age: But all these Qualifications are
united in him. He is descended of a Noble and
Ancient Family in <HI>Holland,</HI> which can boast of an
uninterrupted Succession for above 300 Years, and
is Ally'd to the Principal Houses in the <HI>Netherlands.</HI>
Among the rest I shall only mention its late Alliance
with the most ancient Family of the <HI>Collier's,</HI> which
is originally of <HI>Scotland:</HI> Their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Advance.</NOTE> Device
is the finest that ever I saw, nor do
they bear it in vain. For they have upon all occa∣sions
signaliz'd their Courage in Military Atchieve∣ments;
and there are at present three of that Fa∣mily
in the King's Service, who seem to make Va∣lour
their Favourite Vertue, and are known and
esteem'd by the whole Army, both for that and a
thousand other no less glorious Endowments.</P>
<P><HI>Madam de Hochepied</HI> is the Sister of the present,
and Daughter of the late <HI>Dutch Ambassador.</HI> She's
a finish'd Beauty, and has the Air of a Princess;
and besides (which is as true as it seems incredible)
she is absolutely Mistress of <HI>Seven</HI> of the most diffi∣cult
and opposite <HI>Languages</HI> in the World. For be∣sides
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which is her natural Tongue, she
speaks the <HI>French, Italian, Greek, Russian, Turkish,</HI> and
<PB N="231" REF="135"/>
<HI>Arabian</HI> Languages, and speaks 'em all so perfectly
well, that I have often heard her explaining to
Interpreters the true sense of certain hard Words,
of which they were ignorant before. In short,
she's in all respects an admirable Person. Judge,
Sir, whether I can think the time tedious which
I spend in such agreeable Company, and in a
House where I'm so kindly entertain'd; and whe∣ther
you can blame me for not hastening my de∣parture.
I'm resolv'd to expect an occasion for
<HI>Venice,</HI> and I believe 'twill be a long time before
I can find one; because the <HI>Venetian</HI> Vessels never
venture to appear in this part of the Sea, till the
<HI>Turkish Fleet</HI> be laid up, tho' they have no great
reason to dread it, since the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> for all
his <HI>Grandeur,</HI> is Master only of <HI>Eleven Ships of War.</HI>
'Tis true, if all his Galleys wou'd put to Sea,
their number might at least amount to 200; but
as Affairs are manag'd at present, his Navy
makes no great Figure. You may expect a more
particular Account of these things in my next.
In the mean time,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU might justly accuse me of Laziness, or
want of Complaisance, if I shou'd not employ
the leisure I enjoy at present in recollecting my
Observations concerning the Government, Religion,
Manners, and Customs of the <HI>Turks.</HI> I shall en∣deavour
therefore to satisfie your Curiosity, by en∣tertaining
you with a short account of these Sub∣jects,
avoiding all impertinent Repetitions of those
obvious and common Remarks that are to be met
with in almost every Book of <HI>Voyages.</HI> And I hope
the Points I propose to handle will furnish me with
sufficient Matter for <HI>Three Letters;</HI> the <HI>first</HI> of which
shall treat of the <HI>Government,</HI> the <HI>second</HI> of the <HI>Reli∣gion,</HI>
and the <HI>third</HI> of the <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> of
the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turkish Empire,</HI> according to the primitive
and fundamental Constitution of the Government,
is absolutely and entirely <HI>Despotic;</HI> that is, a Su∣pream
and Arbitrary Power is lodg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the Person
of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> whose <HI>Will</HI> is the only <HI>Law</HI> by
which he Rules, and who acknowledges no other
Maxim of Government than <HI>Sic volo, sic jubeo.</HI> He
is not curb'd by any written Law or Custom, and
those whom he Oppresses have not so much as a
right to Complain. He may take away any Man's
Estate, and either keep it, or give it to another.
Sometimes he passes by the most ancient <HI>Bassa</HI>'s,
and in one day advances a simple <HI>Chiaux,</HI> or even
a <HI>Cook,</HI> to the Dignity of <HI>Grand Visier.</HI> He sends
for the Heads of those whom he has a Mind to be
rid of, who are Murder'd without any Trial or
<PB N="233" REF="136"/>
Form of Justice, and even without knowing the
Reason of his Displeasure. In one Word, his Plea∣sure
is the supreme and uncontroulable Law. This
unlimited Power of the <HI>Sultan</HI> is founded on the
<HI>Mahometan Religion,</HI> which enjoins a blind Obedi∣ence
to all his Commands under Pain of Damna∣tion.
But the <HI>Turks</HI> of late have render'd their Slavery
more tolerable; for tho' they have made no Alte∣ration
in the Constitution of the Government,
their Practices are very different from what they
were heretofore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Visier</HI> is the Chief Minister of State,
and is call'd <HI>King</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> to shew how much
the <HI>Sultans</HI> slight and undervalue that Title, in Imi∣tation
of the Old <HI>Roman Emperours,</HI> who bestow'd
Kingdoms on their Favourites. This is the Rea∣son
why the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> stiles himself <HI>The Pro∣tector
of Persecuted Kings,</HI> and the <HI>Distributer of
Crowns;</HI> tho' he wears none himself, not even on
the Day of his Public Inauguration, for the only
Badge of his Imperial Dignity is a magnificent <HI>Sabre,</HI>
enrich'd with precious Stones, which the <HI>Mufti</HI> girds
to his Side. The <HI>Grand Visier</HI> is entrusted with the
whole Management of Affairs, and his Power is
almost equal to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s. He is in a great mea∣sure
the Arbiter of Peace and War, and creates the
Fortune of all the Great Officers in the Empire.
'Tis true, he ought not to do any thing without the
Advice of a Council, compos'd of seven <HI>Bassa's,</HI>
call'd the <HI>Visiers of the Bench:</HI> but they have only a
Shadow of Authority, which scarce deserves to be
mention'd.</P>
<P>The next in Order, are the <HI>Bassa's,</HI> who are a
sort of Vice-Roys in the Provinces. Their Office
is to administer Justice exactly, and to keep the Peo∣ple
in Subjection to the Government. They are al∣so
oblig'd to pay a yearly Tribute to the <HI>Grand Sig∣nior,</HI>
both of Money and Slaves, without reck'ning
<PB N="234" REF="137"/>
the <HI>Carache,</HI> Customs, and other Imposts that are usu∣ally
exacted. This is the utmost Extent of the Legal
Authority of the <HI>Bassa's;</HI> but they commonly abuse
their Power, and are more arbitrary Tyrants than
the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> himself. Their principal Aim is
to raise their Fortune speedily; and in order to that
they rob the Widow and Orphan, and fill the Land
with Spoil and Oppression, never scrupling to com∣mit
a gainful Crime, tho' attended with the ba∣sest
Circumstances. The <HI>Sultan</HI> is forc'd to dissem∣ble
his Knowledge of these Disorders, for want of
Power to suppress 'em: for every <HI>Bassa</HI> maintains
some standing Forces at his own Charge, whose
Assistance he may command upon all Occasions, if
their Payment be not wholly neglected. Whereas
the <HI>Sultan,</HI> who for the most part wants Money to
pay his Army, and perhaps does not shew himself
twice in his Life to the Soldiers, is so far from be∣ing
Master of 'em, that he is almost always con∣strain'd
to submit to their Authority. This is the
fatal Source of all those Seditions that have so often
shaken, and will at last overturn the Empire. For
how can we suppose that Subjects will either love
or fear a lazy Prince, that takes no Share in the Bu∣siness
of State or War: a Prince, that contents him∣self
with a Chimerical Show of Grandeur and Pow∣er,
and seems rather to be a <HI>Mock-King</HI> in a <HI>Farce</HI>
than a <HI>Ruler</HI> of <HI>Kingdoms?</HI> 'Tis plain both from Rea∣son
and Experience, that a great Monarch, who wou'd
be the <HI>absolute</HI> Master of his Subjects, ought to apply
himself to the Execution and Reformation of the
<HI>Laws,</HI> and above all, to gain the Esteem and Affection
of his <HI>Soldiers,</HI> whom he ought to look upon as the
surest Prop and Support of his Authority. An <HI>Ar∣my</HI>
in a State cannot remain indifferent; they must
and will have a Master; and will either continue
faithful to the <HI>Crown,</HI> or espouse the Interest of
some designing <HI>Subject:</HI> And therefore it ought to
<PB N="235" REF="137"/>
be the Prince's Care to discover their Inclinations, and
to act accordingly. <HI>Kings</HI> are as feeble <HI>Creatures</HI> as other
Men, and as unable to perform any Great Action by
their own Power: but when they are at the Head of
100000 Men, all devoted to their Interest, 'tis then
they become the Terrour of the World, and their
<HI>Power</HI> is almost as boundless as their <HI>Ambition.</HI> The
Fate of Monarchs depends on their Armies, and
without these neither <HI>Alexander, Caesar,</HI> nor <HI>Lewis</HI>
XIV. cou'd have gain'd one Inch of Ground. This
is so evident and certain a Truth, that never
any Person had the Confidence to controvert it:
and I believe the <HI>Ottoman Emperours</HI> are of the same
Opinion, tho' all their Actions seem to be grounded
on very different, and even opposite Maxims. A
Prince that wou'd secure the Loyalty of his For∣ces,
must take care of 'em himself, visit 'em of∣ten,
give out all Orders, preferr Men of known Me∣rit,
keep both the Officers and Soldiers under an exact
Discipline, and pay 'em as punctually as he can. The
<HI>Grand Signior</HI> observes not one of these Maxims,
and therefore he may blame himself for the Unru∣liness
of his Army. But the Government is guilty
of another Blunder, which, in my Opinion, is no
less fatal than the former; I mean the usual way of
appeasing Seditions, which break forth oftner than
once a Year. For every Tumult that shakes the
<HI>Sultan</HI>'s Throne, costs him the Heads of a hundred
of his Principal Officers: The <HI>Grand Visier</HI> is com∣monly
made the first Sacrifice, and afterwards that
important Charge is entrusted to some young and
unexperienc'd Person, as if a <HI>Minister of State</HI> cou'd
spring up in a Night like a <HI>Mushroom.</HI> This Custom
is directly opposite to common Sence, which teaches
us that no Man ought to be advanc'd to so high a
Post, but one that has been long accustom'd to State-Business,
and has spent his whole Life in fitting
himself for the Management of so great a Trust.
<PB N="236" REF="138"/>
These Considerations give me an <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Turkish
Empire,</HI> which I cannot express better than by com∣paring
it to a <HI>Coach</HI> drawn by a Sett of <HI>ungovernable
Horses,</HI> each of which pulls a contrary Way.</P>
<P>If we descend lower, and take a more particular
View of the Government, we shall every where
find the dismal Effects of these Disorders. The Di∣stempers
of the <HI>Head</HI> are usually communicated to
the <HI>Inferiour Members:</HI> And I never saw a Country,
where Justice is so often and so impudently pervert∣ed,
by those who are entrusted with the Execution
of it. I know 'tis the Custom of some Travellers
to magnifie the <HI>Turkish</HI> way of administring Justice:
but such a groundless Conceit is only the Effect of
the powerful Inclination most Men have to admire
every thing that is unusual or extraordinary. And
I'm confident that a bare Account of their Method
of Judging <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Criminal</HI> Causes, will give you
a very different Notion of their boasted Justice;
You, I say, who are not tainted with those com∣mon
Prejudices, but are always wont to judge of
things as they <HI>are in themselves,</HI> without considering
whether they are <HI>rare</HI> or <HI>common.</HI></P>
<P>They have no <HI>written Laws</HI> but what are con∣tain'd
in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which they hold to be the
<HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Standard</HI> of <HI>Justice,</HI> and every
thing that it forbids is esteem'd unlawful and pu∣nishable.
Nevertheless the <HI>Bassa's</HI> and <HI>Cadi's</HI> judge
as they please, for the Book is very short, and be∣sides
a great deal fuller of Dreams and Absurdities
than of Laws or Moral Precepts; and those few it
contains are so ambiguously express'd, and deliver'd
in so loose a Manner, that these greedy Officers
cannot desire a more favourable Opportunity to sa∣tisfie
their Avarice. Besides they judge without Ap∣peal,
and cause the Sentence to be executed upon
the Spot. 'Tis true, some highly injur'd Persons
have recourse to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s <HI>Divan;</HI> but
<PB N="237" REF="138"/>
then the Injustice must be very plain and inexcusa∣ble,
or 'tis in vain to expect Satisfaction; and that
is so seldom obtain'd, that few prudent Men will
venture on so troublesome and expensive a Journey:
for since 'tis not the Custom to record either the
Pleadings, or the Sentence, the Judge may easily
elude all the Arguments of his Accusers. 'Tis true,
the Number of the Plaintiffs is usually so great, and
the Informations of other Officers so positive, that
the Truth is at last discover'd, and the Offen∣ders
are punish'd. But tho' few <HI>Cadi's</HI> leave the Of∣fice
with Honour, there is not the least Care taken
to repair the Losses of those whom they have ru∣in'd.
For, besides what I intimated before, that
their Proceedings are not register'd, the new <HI>Cadi</HI>
is usually as great a Rogue as his Predecessour; so
that the poor oppress'd People must bear their Mis∣fortunes
as patiently as they can, without the least
hope of Redress.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cadi's</HI> are mere Beggars when they are first
advanc'd to that gainfull Post, and their Commission
lasts but a Year: yet in less than three Months
these tatter'd Scoundrels exchange their Rags for
gawdy Habits, and a magnificent Equipage, and at
the End of the Year are Masters of vast Estates.
We exclaim against our <HI>Lawyers</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and will
not suffer those who have spend 20 or 30 Years in
a perpetual Hurry of Business, to enjoy the Fruit of
their Labours in Peace, tho' the Fortunes they ac∣quire
are for the most part so small, that they can
hardly subsist without Employment. But I'm con∣fident
a little Acquaintance with the Customs of
this Country wou'd quickly stop the Mouths of our
Grumblers: for if the <HI>Cadi</HI> of a considerable City
were permitted to hold his Office <HI>Ten</HI> Years, he
wou'd be richer than a <HI>President au Mortier.</HI> He
that went last from <HI>Smyrna</HI> gain'd above 40000
Crowns; and you may easily judge how mise∣rably
<PB N="238" REF="139"/>
the Inhabitants were oppress'd by a Judge that
cou'd in one Year heap up so great a Treasure. 'Tis
true he durst not expect the Coming of his Succes∣sour,
but march'd off eight days before, without
staying to take leave of his Friends, according to
the prudent Custom of his Brother-Rogues. For they
are oblig'd to give an Account of their Administra∣tion
to the succeeding <HI>Cadi's,</HI> who make a Report
to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s <HI>Divan,</HI> and even secure their
Persons when the Comlaints against 'em are very
numerous and grievous. But they are too conscious
of their Guilt, to stand a Trial which they know
wou'd infallibly ruine 'em; and therefore to avoid
so terrible a Danger, they go immediately to their
Patron at the <HI>Port,</HI> who receives his Share in the
Booty, and grants 'em his Protection, without which
they wou'd be punish'd without Mercy. Yet some
of 'em chuse rather to buy their Peace of the new
<HI>Cadi,</HI> who, for 8 or 10 <HI>Purses,</HI> which amounts to 12
or 15000 <HI>Livres,</HI> gives 'em as favourable a Certifi∣cate
as they can desire.</P>
<P>All <HI>Civil</HI> Affairs are judg'd by the <HI>Cadi</HI> according
to the Deposition of <HI>Witnesses,</HI> without any regard
to <HI>Writings.</HI> For suppose you had lent 1000 <HI>Piasters</HI>
to a Man upon his Note or Bond, if he can but
suborn two Men to affirm that they saw him pay
you such a Summ, you must infallibly lose your
Money. This Custom gives a fair Opportunity to
Men of dishonest Principles to abuse their Creditors;
since they may easily find Witnesses to prove any
thing, and even without giving themselves the trou∣ble
to enquire after 'em. One word, or a Sign to
the <HI>Cadi</HI> is sufficient, who always keeps a Score of
Knights of the Post ready to serve him or any of
his Friends on such Occasions. After the two con∣tending
Parties have pleaded their own Cause as
well as they can, for there are no Barristers in <HI>Tur∣key,</HI>
one of 'em clutches his right Fist, and
<PB N="239" REF="139"/>
stretches out one, two, or three of his Fingers, sig∣nifying,
that he intends to present the <HI>Cadi</HI> with a
like number of <HI>Purses:</HI> Then his Adversary makes
the same Sign, and offers more or less, as he thinks
fit. At Night the <HI>Cadi</HI> sends for the highest Bidder,
and having receiv'd his Present, requites his Com∣pliment
very civilly the next Day, with a favourable
Sentence; after which he that is cast must either
pay the Debt immediately, or go to Prison. And
(which is still more unjust) if you are not able to
maintain him, and pay the Fees of those who ar∣rested
him, you must resign the third Part of your
Debt; in Consideration of which the poor Wretch
is kept rotting in the Gaol, till an exact Enquiry
be made into his Estate. And if it be found
that the Debt exceeds the Value of his Goods and
Possessions, the Payment is chang'd to a Corporal
Punishment, and he receives as many <HI>Bastinadoes</HI>
on the Soals of his Feet as he owes <HI>Piast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,</HI> unless
the Summ exceed 500; for they stop there, because
the strongest Man cou'd not endure a greater num∣ber
of Blows without manifest Danger of his Life.</P>
<P>The Judgment of <HI>Criminal</HI> Affairs belongs to the
<HI>Bassa,</HI> who proceeds after the same manner: for
<HI>Money</HI> clears the most barbarous Malefactor, and
without that, Justice degenerates to Cruelty. The
<HI>Stake</HI> and the <HI>Gibbet</HI> seem to be only made for <HI>poor
Villains;</HI> nor can there be a greater Sign of Poverty,
than when a Man is prosecuted for Murder or Rob∣bery:
for since the <HI>Bassa</HI> and <HI>Vaivode</HI> are always sure
of 40000 <HI>Aspers,</HI> the usual Price of Blood, which
they exact of those before whose Doors the Murder
was committed; they seldom or never take care to
execute Justice on the Murderer. I have seen a <HI>Ja∣nisary,</HI>
who had kill'd above 30 Men, walk thro'
the Streets unmolested, and with as much Confi∣dence
as the most innocent Person in Town. Nor
are these corrupt Tribunals less favourable to the
<PB N="240" REF="140"/>
Robbers that infest the Country, and commit such
frequent Disorders, that no wise Man will venture
to travel one day's Journey without being compleat∣ly
arm'd, and extremely well accompany'd. 'Tis
true, the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> from time to time sends su∣periour
<HI>Bassa's,</HI> attended with some Companies of
Soldiers, to search after unpunish'd Malefactors. 'Tis
not above two Months since one of 'em came to
this City, and put to Death about 20 Criminals: but
after all, these <HI>Great Inquisitors</HI> are only terrible to those
who are unable to buy their Favour, and even he
whom I mention'd had above fifty Customers of
this Sort. Among the rest I shall only take notice
of one Instance of his mercenary Clemency; and
I hope I shall easily obtain your Pardon for a Di∣gression
which will not only divert you, but give
you a clearer <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Genius</HI> of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Offi∣cers
of Justice.</P>
<P>A Man that us'd to work in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant's
Garden, was seiz'd for a Murder, which he had
committed 7 or 8 Years before, and finding him∣self
to be in a very hopeless Condition, sent to beg
the Merchant's Assistance, who was too generous to
suffer one that had serv'd him to be hang'd for wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of 2 or 300 <HI>Piasters.</HI> The poor Man relying upon
his Master's promis'd Kindness, began immediately
to treat with the <HI>Bassa</HI> for his Ransom, which at last
was fix'd at 100 <HI>Turkish</HI> Pieces of Gold, commonly
call'd <HI>Scherifi,</HI> worth 2 1/4 <HI>Piasters</HI> each. The Bargain
being thus concluded, the Merchant gave the hun∣dred
<HI>Scherifi</HI> to the <HI>Bassa's Kiaia,</HI> who deliver'd but
<HI>ninety</HI> to the Treasurer, having kept the other <HI>ten</HI>
for himself. Now you must know that there are in
<HI>Turkey</HI> a sort of Men who pretend to be <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s
<HI>Kinsmen,</HI> and are highly reverenc'd by all Persons:
They wear green <HI>Turbants,</HI> and are call'd <HI>Scherifi,</HI>
which (you may remember I told you) is the
Name of the <HI>Pieces of Gold.</HI> When the Trial came
<PB N="241" REF="140"/>
on, after the Witnesses were examin'd, the <HI>Bassa</HI>
perceiving that there were <HI>Ten</HI> Pieces wanting of the
promis'd Summ, and imagining that Defect to be
a design'd Breach of the Agreement, seem'd to be
very nice and inexorable, and protested that he
cou'd not acquit a Man who was positively charg'd
with Murder by so many Witnesses. But the <HI>Secre∣tary,</HI>
who by good Fortune was acquainted with the
whole Transaction, told him, That <HI>tho' these Wit∣nesses
declar'd him Guilty, there were</HI> 100 Scherifi <HI>ar∣riv'd,
who asserted his Innocencey, and that their Testi∣mony
was much more convincing. I thought,</HI> said the
<HI>Bassa, I saw but 90; 'Tis true,</HI> reply'd the <HI>Secretary,
but there were</HI> Ten <HI>more, who by reason of their great Age,
could not come up to your Presence, and therefore staid
below with the</HI> Kiaia. The <HI>Bassa,</HI> who was neither
Deaf nor Dull, understood the Meaning of those
Expressions, and declar'd the accus'd Person in∣nocent.</P>
<P>There are several sorts of <HI>Punishments</HI> inflicted on
Malefactors in this Country; such as <HI>Beheading,
Drowning, Hanging, Strangling, Burning, Impaling,</HI>
and the <HI>Strappado.</HI> The two <HI>last</HI> are the most Cru∣el,
and are appointed only for <HI>Turks</HI> that renounce
the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith, or <HI>Renegado's</HI> that return to the
Profession of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, or for those
who are convicted of some very enormous Crimes.
<HI>Robbers</HI> and <HI>Murderers</HI> are <HI>hang'd, Women</HI> are <HI>drown'd,</HI>
those who are found <HI>guilty</HI> of <HI>Rebellion</HI> or <HI>Sedition</HI>
are <HI>beheaded,</HI> and <HI>Burning</HI> is the Punishment of <HI>Chri∣stians</HI>
for <HI>blaspheming</HI> against <HI>Mahomet</HI> or the <HI>Alcoran,</HI>
or for <HI>lying</HI> with a <HI>Turkish</HI> Woman. Not long ago
an <HI>English</HI> Merchant at <HI>Constantinople</HI> very narrowly
escap'd Suffering for the last of these Crimes. He
kept a fair <HI>Turk</HI> with all imaginable Secrecy, and
never saw her at his own House. To prevent Suspici∣on,
he procur'd a very pretty Yacht, in which he
went with her almost every day, to take the Air
<PB N="242" REF="141"/>
on the Sea of <HI>Marmora,</HI> or in the Canal of the
<HI>Black Sea,</HI> and usually staid abroad till Night. But
at last the whole Intrigue was discover'd by the In∣discretion
of a Servant; and they were both ap∣prehended
by an Order from the <HI>Grand Visier,</HI> who
at first threaten'd to burn the Merchant, but was af∣terwards
prevail'd with to accept a Fine of 10000
<HI>Piasters,</HI> which he paid upon the Spot. Several
Travellers have particularly describ'd the Punish∣ments
call'd <HI>Impaling,</HI> and the <HI>Strappado,</HI> as well as
the Manner of giving the <HI>Bastonnado;</HI> and therefore
I shall forbear troubling you with an Account of
what I suppose you know already.</P>
<P>The Government of the Cities is manag'd by Five
Kinds of <HI>Officers,</HI> the <HI>Bassa, Sub-Bassa, Vaivode, Cadi,</HI>
and <HI>Receiver of the Customs.</HI> The <HI>Bassa</HI> is properly the
Governor, and judges criminal Causes; and the <HI>Sub-Bassa</HI>
is as it were his Deputy. The <HI>Vaivode</HI> takes care
of regulating Affairs in the City; he walks the Round
twice a-week, to examine the Weights and Mea∣sures,
to observe whether unlicens'd Tipling-Houses
are kept, to punish Drunken Persons, and all those
in the general who commit any Disorders in the
City. Those who are found guilty of these or any
other Abuses, must immediately submit to the <HI>Ba∣stonnado,</HI>
especially <HI>Drunkards,</HI> who are always very
roughly handl'd. The Function of the <HI>Sub-Bassa</HI> is
not much different. The <HI>Cadi</HI> is the Judge of all Civil
Suits; and the <HI>Receiver of the Customs,</HI> who in <HI>France</HI>
is only a private Person without any Authority, is
in this Country empower'd to take Cognizance of
all fraudulent Practices relating to Pecuniary Duties,
in all which Cases he is both <HI>Judge</HI> and <HI>Party.</HI></P>
<P>The Jealousie that reigns among these Officers is
so furious and extravagant, that they make it their
principal Business to discredit and ruine one ano∣ther.
'Tis a Pleasure to hear the Characters which
they mutually give of each other; and assoon as
<PB N="243" REF="141"/>
they are acquainted with a Man, they begin to en∣tertain
him with a Harangue on that Subject. The
<HI>Vaivode</HI> of this Place, with whom I have contracted
a sort of Friendship, has told me a thousand Sto∣ries
of the <HI>Bassa's</HI> and <HI>Cadi's,</HI> which, as diverting as
they are, I shall rather chuse to relate, than to write
to you: and therefore you must even content your
self at present with one, for a Taste of the pleasant
Entertainment you may expect at our next Meeting.</P>
<P>One who had as little Money as Honesty, that is,
none at all, was sent in the Quality of a <HI>Cadi,</HI> to a
certain Town, where he hop'd the Wranglings of
the Inhabitants wou'd quickly supply all his Wants.
But, as ill Luck wou'd have it, his Predecessors had
quite spoil'd his Market; and <HI>Oppression,</HI> which
makes some <HI>wise</HI> Men <HI>mad,</HI> had made these <HI>Fools,
wise.</HI> They heard he was a very hungry Devil,
and they resolv'd to starve him out-right; wisely
considering that 'twas both their Duty and Interest
to live in Peace, or at least to refer all their Diffe∣rences
to the Arbitration of honest Friends, rather
than by tearing out their own Bowels to feed
their Greedy Devourer. And it seems they show'd
as much Firmness in pursuing, as Wisdom in ma∣king
so advantageous a Resolution: for the <HI>Cadi</HI>
spent six Weeks or two Months after his Arrival,
without any Employment but Fretting, Cursing, and
biting his Thumbs out of meer Spite, because he
could find nothing else to exercise his Teeth upon.
One day as he was walking in the Streets, medita∣ting
no doubt on his wretched Fate, he perceiv'd a
Baker, who was drawing a good Fat Goose out
of his Oven; and the savoury Vapours assaulting
his Nose, rais'd a furious Commotion in his empty
Stomach: his Mouth water'd at the delicious Ob∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct,
and his Guts began to rumble with a more than
ordinary Violence. In a Word, he was so little
Master of himself, that he cou'd not forbear beg∣ging
<PB N="244" REF="142"/>
a Piece; but the Baker told him that the Goose
belong'd to one of his Neighbours, who had sent it
to him to be bak'd. <HI>Come,</HI> reply'd the <HI>Cadi, take
my Advice: We'll eat the Goose, and when the Man
comes to fetch it, tell him that as thou wert bringing
it out to see whether 'twas ready, a Flock of Geese hap∣pen'd
to fly by the Door, and that his Goose perceiving
its old Companions, wou'd not be persuaded to stay be∣hind
'em. If he will not be satisfy'd with so fair an
Answer, let him e'en take his Course; for he must
bring thee before me, and I'll find a Way to save
thee harmless.</HI> There was no need of more Argu∣ments,
for the Baker's Stomach was on the <HI>Cadi</HI>'s
Side, and his Conscience made no long Resistance:
and therefore assoon as he had signify'd his Con∣sent,
the <HI>Cadi</HI> began to bestir his Chaps so vigorous∣ly,
that by the Assistance of his Friend the Business
was dispatch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in an Instant. Two Hours after the
Man came for his Goose, and the Baker repeated
his Lesson very gravely: but the Jest was some∣what
too gross, and the Man was so offended at
the Baker<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Insolency, that he took him immedi∣ately
by the Neck, and told him that he must ei∣ther
restore his Goose, or go before the <HI>Cadi;</HI> for
there are no Sergeants or Bailiffs in this Country.
These Threatnings made no great Impression upon
the Baker, since he knew that he was to be judg'd
by his Fellow-Rogue; so that he was as free from
Fear, as the other was full of Anger and Revenge
and walk'd very peaceably along with his Accuser.
But they had not gone far when they were stopp'd
by the Lamentations of a poor Mule-Driver, whose
Mule was fall'n under her Load, and lay sprawl∣ing
on the Ground. The Baker was mov'd with
Compassion at the poor Man's Misfortune, who
came to beg his Assistance, and took hold of the
Mule's Tail, while the Man himself endeavour'd t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
raise her Head: but the Load was so heavy, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="245" REF="142"/>
the Baker finding more Resistance than he expected,
and pulling with all the Force of a Brawny Arm, at
last pluck'd the Tail off at the Root. The Owner of
the Mule was so enrag'd at this unlucky Accident,
which made him incapable of following his usual Oc∣cupation,
that not regarding the Baker's charitable
Intention, he seiz'd him by the Collar, and help'd
the other Man to hale him along, for he was so
far from going willingly as before, that considering
the <HI>Cadi</HI> was not at all concern'd in this Affair,
and not daring to rely too much on his Friendship,
lest he should be oblig'd to pay the Price of
the Mule, he made a shift to get loose; and think∣ing
to make his Lscape, ran into a House not far
from the place where he met the Mule-Driver. But,
as Mischances never come single, it happen'd that
there was a Woman six Months gone with Child,
standing in the Court of the House where he
thought to secure himself, who was so terrify'd at
the sight of a Man running, with two others pur∣suing
him furiously at his Heels, that she miscar∣ry'd
immediately. Thus the poor Baker had the
Mortification to see the Number of his Enemies en∣creas'd;
for the Woman's Husband join'd with the
other Two, and all together carry'd him before the
<HI>Cadi,</HI> whom they acquainted with the Reason of
their Coming, expressing their several Complaints
in a very mournful Tone, to move their Judge to
Compassion.</P>
<P>I'm a very poor Man, <HI>said he who had receiv'd
the first Injury,</HI> and all the Town knows that I had
but one Goose, which I intended to eat with my Wife
and Children, in Peace and Joy, as I hope for the
Blessing of the Prophet. But alas! this wicked Man
has stoll'n her from me, and wou'd put me off with a
ridiculous Story: he has the Impudence to tell me that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Goose after she was bak'd, spy'd a Flock of other
Geese, and flew away with 'em.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="143"/>
I had but one Mule, <HI>cry'd the Second,</HI> which main∣tain'd
me and all my Family; I had but one, and now,
alas! I may say I have none: for the poor Creature
had the Misfortune to fall under her Burden, and this
Man happen'd to pass by as I was endeavouring in vain
to relieve her. I intreated him to help me, but instead
of raising her up, he pluck'd off her Tail.</P>
<P>Ah! Wou'd I had no more Reason to complain than
either of the rest, <HI>said the Third.</HI> I have but one
Wife, and that a very bad one. We have been mar∣ry'd
these three Years, and I have toil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Night and
Day to get her with Child: At last, by the Blessing
of the Prophet I did the Feat, and in a little time ex∣pected
to see the Fruit of my Labours. But that Trai∣tour
has this Day destroy'd what I cou'd hardly get in
three Years: he put my Wife into such a Fright, that
she miscarry'd three Months before the Time.</P>
<P>Judge, Sir, with what Impatience and Fear the
Baker expected his Doom, and how the <HI>Cadi</HI> was
puzzl'd to bring him off in Spite of so many cla∣morous
Accusers. Yet the Difficulty of the Case
serv'd only to show the Dexterity of the Judge, as
you will easily perceive by his Answers to the <HI>Three</HI>
Plaintiffs.</P>
<P>I cannot, <HI>said he to the First,</HI> oblige a Man to re∣store
a Goose, which, he affirms, flew out of his hands.
I confess the Story is very surprizing and improbable,
but we must always give credit to an honest Man's
Word: And therefore since thou canst produce no Wit∣nesses
to disprove it, thou must e'en resolve to bear thy
Mifortune patiently.</P>
<P>As for thee, <HI>said he to the Second,</HI> 'tis another
Case: He has pluck'd off thy Mule's Tail, and made
her unfit for Service. And therefore 'tis just that be
shou'd be oblig'd to keep her at his own Charge till
her Rump be heal'd.</P>
<P>But thou, poor Man, <HI>said he, turning to the Third▪</HI>
art more to be pity'd than either of the rest. Thou
<PB N="247" REF="143"/>
say'st (and I believe thee) that it cost thee three Years
Labour to get a Child: and after all thy Toil, this
Man by an unlucky Accident has made thy Wife cast
her Bantling three Months before the Time. I condemn
the Rogue to take her home with him, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill her Belly
again, and to keep her till she be in the same Conditi∣on,
and the Child as old as when he made her miscarry.</P>
<P>I will not ask your Opinion of this Story, till
you have heard both Parties: for the <HI>Cadi</HI> thinks
himself as honest a Man, and as worthy of your Audi∣ence
as the <HI>Vaivode;</HI> and therefore you must e'en be
satisfy'd to hear his Tale next.</P>
<P>A very Rich Man dy'd, and left his Son Heir to
his whole Estate, except 1000 <HI>Piasters,</HI> which he
bequeath'd to the <HI>Tyrant of the Country.</HI> Now you
must know that the <HI>Turks</HI> are very religious Obser∣vers
of the <HI>Last-Wills</HI> of their Relations: and this
Young Man it seems was very nice in that Point.
His Ignorance of his Father's Meaning made him
extremely uneasie; for he concluded that if he
shou'd detain another Man's Right, against his Fa∣ther's
positive Command, 'twou'd certainly bring
the Curse of the <HI>Prophet</HI> upon him. After he had
spent some time in considering where to bestow the
Legacy, he resolv'd to carry it to the <HI>Bassa,</HI> whom
he address'd thus: <HI>Sir, My Father order'd me by his
Last-Will, to give</HI> 1000 <HI>Piasters to the Tyrant of the
Country, without mentioning the Name of any particu∣lar
Person. I was extremely troubl'd at the Obscurity
of these Words, and not being able to unriddle the My∣stery,
I thought my self oblig'd to bring the Money to
you not as to a Tyrant, but as to the most powerful
Person in the Country.</HI> The <HI>Bassa,</HI> who by chance was
an honest Man, reply'd very calmly, <HI>My Son, I neither
am, nor will be a Tyrant, carry the Money to the</HI>
Cadi, <HI>for he has more Right to it than I.</HI> The Young
Man perceiving that 'twou'd be in vain to urge him
to accept it, went according to his Advice, and
<PB N="248" REF="144"/>
made the same Complement to the <HI>Cadi,</HI> whom he
found to be as generous as the <HI>Bassa;</HI> for he told
him he cou'd not take it without injuring the Per∣son
for whom it was design'd, and desir'd him to
carry it to the <HI>Receiver of the Customs.</HI> But that Offi∣cer
was as jealous of his Honour as either of the
rest, and sent the young Heir to the <HI>Vaivode,</HI> who
hearing that he had been with the other three, and
what Answers he had receiv'd from 'em, told him that
as his Conscience oblig'd him to ease a Neighbour of a
Burthen that seem'd to be so troublesome to him, so it
wou'd not permit him to receive it absolutely <HI>gratis.
Let us,</HI> added he, <HI>make a feign'd Bargain; you shall
buy all the Snow in my Court for</HI> 1000 Piasters, <HI>and
then I can take the Money with a safe Conscience.</HI> The
Young Man, who had been bandy'd about so of∣ten,
and was glad to be rid of the Money on any
Terms, consented immediately to the Proposal. As
soon as the Bargain was concluded, and the Deed
of Conveyance written, the <HI>Vaivode</HI>'s Secretary de∣manded
his Fees; for in this Country the Purcha∣ser
must always pay for the Contract. The Young
Man was both vex'd and surpriz'd at the Impudence
of these Blood-suckers, and upbraided 'em with
their Injustice and Barbarity; adding, That he did
not expect to be troubl'd with their litigious Tricks
after he had freely presented 'em with so considerable
a Summ: But neither his Anger nor Arguments cou'd
prevail, for he was forc'd at last to give the Se∣cretary
<HI>Ten Piasters</HI> more; after which he went
home with a Resolution to return no more to a
place where he had been so ill treated. But three
Days after the <HI>Vaivode</HI> sent to acquaint him that
'twas time for him to remove his Commodity. The
Young Man imagining that they intended only to
put a Jest upon him for his foolish Bargain, bid the
Messenger tell his Master, that he might keep both
<PB N="249" REF="144"/>
the Goods and the Money. But he was quickly
convinc'd, that he had bestow'd the Legacy on the
Man who had the best right to it: For the <HI>Vaivode</HI>
forc'd him to remove all the Snow that was in his
Court.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN pursuance of the Method I propos'd in my
<HI>last,</HI> I shall in <HI>this</HI> Letter give you a brief Ac∣count
of the <HI>Turkish Religion,</HI> which, in the Opini∣on
of those who profess it, is a <HI>New Law,</HI> Insti∣tuted
by GOD, in the room of the <HI>Christian Re∣ligion.</HI></P>
<P>GOD, they say, has sent <HI>Four Prophets</HI> to reveal
his Will to Mankind, and instruct us in the way to
Salvation. The first was <HI>Enoch,</HI> who Preach'd and
Propheci'd, but did not commit his Doctrine to
Writing. For, in those Days, GOD communica∣ted
Himself to Mankind in so sensible a manner,
that there was no need of a Written-Law. After
this Prophet had executed his Commission, he was
taken up into Heaven, both Soul and Body. In
<PB N="250" REF="145"/>
the mean time, GOD seeing that Men perverted
their Ways, and made the want of a Written-Law,
a Cloak and Pretext for their Transgressions, sent
<HI>Moses,</HI> who brought the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> out of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> and gave 'em the Law which he had re∣ceiv'd
from GOD. This was the second Prophet,
whose Dispensation was to continue till the coming
of <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> whom they call the <HI>Breath
of God,</HI> acknowledging, that he was Conceiv'd by
Divine Operation, in the Womb of his Mother,
who remain'd a <HI>Virgin,</HI> even after his Birth. He
alter'd and reform'd the Law, according to the
Power with which God had entrusted him, and for
that reason incurr'd the hatred of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who
sought to put him to Death, and hir'd the Traytor
<HI>Judas</HI> to betray him. But when he came to the
<HI>Oliv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Garden,</HI> they were seiz'd with so strange an
Illusion, that they Crucifi'd <HI>Judas</HI> instead of his
<HI>Master,</HI> who was, in the mean time, translated to
Heaven, where he remains with the two former
<HI>Prophets.</HI> They say, this Opinion serves much bet∣ter
to display the Glory of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> than the
<HI>Christian Doctrine;</HI> and brand us with Folly and Im∣piety
for believing that He whom we adore as God,
was shamefully Crucify'd. The very sight of a
<HI>Crucifix</HI> fills 'em with Anger and Rage, pretending
that 'tis a horrid Injury to <HI>CHRIST,</HI> to represent
him in a State of Ignominy and Suffering. They
believe also that He will come to judge the World
at the last Day; but that He will first Reign upon
the Earth, and Marry, and beget Children. They
affirm, that He was a Holy Man, and a chosen
Vessel; but they will not be perswaded to acknow∣ledge
a <HI>Trinity</HI> of Persons in the Godhead, saying,
That such an Opinion wou'd absolutely destroy
the <HI>Unity</HI> of that Sovereign Being, without which
He cou'd not be GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="145"/>
<HI>CHRIST</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> after
whom there shall come no other <HI>Prophet.</HI> 'Twou'd
be an endless Task to reckon up all the Glorious
Titles they bestow upon him.</P>
<P>They differ not much from us in their Opinions
concerning the <HI>Divine Attributes.</HI> Only they have
such a peculiar Fondness for <HI>Predestination,</HI> that they
extend it even to the most Indifferent Actions, yet
with some Limitations and Circumstances which
'twou'd be very difficult to explain, and which they
themselves do not well understand. Thus they are
firmly perswaded, that under the Reign of such an
<HI>Emperor,</HI> the State will infallibly and perpetually
have either a disast'rous or happy Fate: And 'tis
this Persuasion that makes 'em so inclinable to de∣throne
their <HI>Sultans.</HI></P>
<P>They believe, that there is an infinite number of
<HI>Angels,</HI> some <HI>Good</HI> and others <HI>Bad.</HI> The first are
call'd <HI>White,</HI> and the others <HI>Black</HI> Angels or Devils.
They imagine that every Man has two Angels that
attend him continually, and that one of 'em writes
down all his Good, and the other all his Bad Acti∣ons.
They address their Prayers to the <HI>Black</HI> An∣gels
as well as to the <HI>White,</HI> that they may secure
the Friendship both of the Inhabitants of <HI>Paradice</HI>
and <HI>Hell,</HI> tho', in their Opinion, the Souls of the
Damn'd enter not into the last of these Places till
the Day of Judgment. For 'tis an Article of the
<HI>Turkish Faith,</HI> that the Spirits of the Wicked remain
in their Graves, where they are tormented by the
<HI>Black Angels</HI> till the last Day, when they shall be
sent to <HI>Hell,</HI> together with their Bodies, and suffer
very cruel Punishments, for the space of One or
Two Thousand Years, according to the Crimes
they committed in this Life; after which they
shall be releas'd, and admitted into <HI>Paradice,</HI> where
they shall enjoy the same Happiness that is appoin∣ted
for the Souls of Good Men. They think 'tis
<PB N="252" REF="146"/>
inconsistent with the Divine Goodness, and blame
us for believing that GOD will punish a Man
<HI>Eternally</HI> for the Offences of so <HI>short</HI> a Life: Yet,
since they are extremely afraid of <HI>Hell,</HI> they pray
very devoutly to the <HI>Black Angels</HI> that they wou'd
be pleas'd not to write down all their Ill Acti∣ons.</P>
<P>Since you will doubtless look upon their Opini∣on,
of the Soul's resting in the Grave after Death,
to be very Absurd and Ridiculous, I shall endea∣vour
to give you a clearer Idea of their Thoughts
on that Subject.</P>
<P>They differ from us in the account they give of
the manner how the Soul <HI>Informs</HI> and Animates the
Body. For whereas we believe, that these two
Substances are <HI>Hypostatically</HI> united, and that Death
consists in their Separation; they imagine that the
Soul and Body have no dependance on one ano∣ther,
and that the absence of the Spirit (which,
for Example, may take a Journey to Paradice) is
not necessarily attended with the Destruction of the
Corporeal Machine; tho' they acknowledge that
the Body is always depriv'd of Reason, during its
Separation from the Soul. Thus they believe, that
the only reason why a <HI>Fool</HI> or <HI>Ideot</HI> acts and speaks
absurdly, is because his Soul (and consequently his
Reason) has forsaken him. As for <HI>Lunatic</HI> and
<HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> Persons, who have some lucid Inter∣vals,
and are only depriv'd of their Reason by Fits,
they endeavour to solve the Difficulty, by main∣taining,
that the Soul leaves her Mansion at certain
times, and returns again after a short Absence:
And this, they say, is an effect of Providence,
either for the Punishment of the Distemper'd Per∣son,
or for some other hidden Design. When a
Christian tells 'em, that these Fits of Madness pro∣ceed
from the Disorder and Indisposition of the
Organs, which hinders the Soul from performing
<PB N="253" REF="146"/>
her Functions, they upbraid him with the absur∣dity
of his Opinion; for, say they, the Soul of
Man is a <HI>Spirit,</HI> and therefore cannot be stopt or
obstructed in the exercise of her Faculties by <HI>Mat∣ter,</HI>
which is a Substance of another, and absolute∣ly
different Nature. From this Principle they infer,
that neither the Presence nor Absence of the Soul
can produce any alteration in the Machinal course
of the Body, which is only mov'd by Springs:
And that when one of the principal Springs fails,
or is spoil'd, the Soul cannot prevent the Ruine of
the whole Engine. This, they pretend, is an ob∣vious
Truth, and confirm'd by daily Experience:
And therefore we must not be surpriz'd, that a
dead Body neither Walks, Breathes, nor performs
any Operation, tho' the Soul be still lodg'd in it:
For since she is not the Author of the Machine
which she Inhabits, 'tis beyond her Power either
to keep it entire, or to repair it after it falls to de∣cay.
GOD alone, who made and contriv'd it,
can restore it, and renew its motion, as he will do
at the last Day. To confirm this Hypothesis, they
cite, with a great deal of Confidence, what <HI>Pliny</HI>
relates of a Man whose Soul and Body were wont
to be separated every day, so that the Body re∣main'd
without any appearance of Life or Motion,
till the return of the Soul, which afterwards us'd
to give an Account of all the wonderful things she
had seen in the remotest Countries. This, you
know, is one of that Author's fabulous Stories, and
yet the <HI>Turks</HI> pretend to draw from thence an evi∣dent
and irrefutable Proof of their Opinion. Be∣sides,
they give the Soul a <HI>Figure</HI> exactly like that
of the Body, and upon this Principle maintain,
that the Souls of the Damned are beaten in the
Grave, and suffer Torments, which a pure Spirit
seems incapable of feeling. They believe also,
that the <HI>Beasts</HI> shall not be depriv'd of the benefit of
<PB N="254" REF="147"/>
the Resurrection, and that at the Day of Judg∣ment
they will give an Account before <HI>CHRIST,</HI>
of all the Kindnesses and Injuries they have re∣ceiv'd
from Men. And this Conceit makes 'em
so charitable to <HI>Irrational</HI> Creatures, that some of
'em buy little <HI>Birds</HI> and live <HI>Fishes,</HI> that they may
afterwards set 'em at liberty.</P>
<P>They fansie themselves <HI>polluted</HI> by several Things,
such as <HI>Sleeping,</HI> the touching of a <HI>Woman,</HI> and of
all sorts of <HI>Excrements;</HI> and therefore after any such
Accident, they perform their Ablution or <HI>Abdest,</HI>
washing their Face, Hands, Ears, and Feet, and
looking towards <HI>Mecca.</HI> In the Day they content
themselves with washing their Mouth, which they
repeat as often as they have occasion to obey the
necessities of Nature: But after <HI>Copulation</HI> their
Ablutions are much more Ceremonious, for they
wash their whole Body in a Bath, as they do also
when a drop of <HI>Wine</HI> falls upon their Garments. I
have seen some of 'em so extreamly Superstitious,
that they wou'd never afterwards wear a Vest that
was pulluted with <HI>Wine;</HI> tho' there are others of
less scrupulous Tempers who never refuse to taste
that spirituous Liquor, and even some that continue
Tipling till they have quite lost their Senses.</P>
<P>They <HI>Pray</HI> five times a Day, in the Morning at
the break of Day, at Noon, at Three a Clock in
the Afternoon, at Six in the Evening, and an hour
after the close of the Evening. But they go only
twice to the <HI>Mosquee,</HI> to the <HI>Sabah</HI> in the Morning,
and to the <HI>Quindy</HI> at Three in the Afternoon: And
even many of 'em perform their public Devotions
only on <HI>Friday,</HI> which is their Festival-Day, as
<HI>Sunday</HI> is ours. On that day an <HI>Iman,</HI> or Priest of
the Law, says a Prayer, and delivers a kind of
Sermon or Exhortation to the Hearers: But the
Men are too jealous to suffer any of the Fair Sex
to come to the Public Places of Worship.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="147"/>
The <HI>Turkish Lent</HI> is shorter, but much more se∣vere
than that which the Catholicks observe; for
they neither Eat, Drink, nor Smoak Tobacco
while the Day lasts; so that this may be justly
reckon'd a very mortifying Season, especially when
it happens to fall out it Summer, considering the
violent Heat that reigns throughout all <HI>Asia.</HI> This
Fast is call'd <HI>Ramadan,</HI> and lasts <HI>Thirty</HI> Days, du∣ring
which time the <HI>Turks</HI> are oblig'd by the <HI>Al∣choran</HI>
to begin their Fast every Morning assoon as
they can discern a Black Thread from a White, and
to continue their Abstinence till the same Hour at
Night, which is proclaim'd by the <HI>Muezins</HI> and
<HI>Marabouts</HI> from the top of the <HI>Minare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> Then they
let loose the Reins to their wild Desires, spending
the whole Night in Gluttony and Drunkenness,
and roaming about the Streets: For during this
Month they turn the Day into Night, and the
Night into Day, and greedily hunt after all sorts
of Pleasures, to allay the severity of the Fast,
which, notwithstanding all the Pains they take to
sweeten it, is very disagreeable to Flesh and Blood.
It ends with the <HI>Moon,</HI> and every one is so impa∣tient
to see the <HI>New-Moon</HI> that releases 'em from
this loath'd Constraint, that they run up to the
Tops of Houses and Mountains to see their Deli∣verer
rise, and assoon as they perceive her gild∣ing
the Horizon, they salute her with several Bows,
and the Castles proclaim the glad Tidings with re∣peated
Discharges of their Artillery. The Three
succeeding Days are spent in Mirth and Jollity;
every Man puts on his best Cloaths, and entertains
his Friends. This is properly the <HI>Turkish Easter,</HI>
and is call'd the <HI>Great Bairam,</HI> to distinguish it from
several Feasts or <HI>Bairams</HI> of less consequence, such
as that of the <HI>Birth of Mahomet,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="148"/>
'Twou'd be needless to tell you, that they nei∣ther
eat <HI>Hog's-Flesh,</HI> nor drink <HI>Wine,</HI> and that they
cannot endure <HI>Images;</HI> for these are things so com∣monly
known, and so often repeated by all the
Crowd of <HI>Travellers,</HI> that I cannot suppose you to
be ignoront of 'em. But, perhaps, you have not
so distinct an Idea of the <HI>Charity</HI> that reigns among
'em. Since they believe <HI>Alms</HI> to be the surest
Atonement for Sins, they neglect no occasion of
buying their future Peace. 'Tis this Principle that
excites 'em to leave considerable Legacies at their
Death, which, according to the Will of the De∣ceas'd,
are employ'd in repairing public Fountains,
building Bridges, or paying the Portions of Indi∣gent
Maidens. I have already told you, that their
Charity extends even to <HI>Beasts;</HI> and I shall take this
occasion to add, that they are particularly kind to
<HI>Dogs,</HI> tho' naturally they do not love 'em, and
keep none in their Houses. Yet the Cities are full
of 'em, where they wander about the Streets, and
perpetuate their Kind like Wild Beasts. They are
so mangy, lean, and miserable, that one wou'd
think they cou'd not live a day; and I have
seen some of 'em at <HI>Constantinople</HI> so near Starving,
that they wou'd jump into the Sea for some Bits of
Carrion which they perceiv'd at the bottom. How∣ever,
since they cou'd not possibly live on what
they find in the Streets, the richer sort of <HI>Turks</HI>
buy Provisions for 'em, and feed 'em every Morn∣ing
at their Doors with Eleemosinary Bread and
Flesh. They reckon it a heinous Crime to kill
a <HI>Dog, Cat, Horse,</HI> or any other Creature that
is not appointed for the Food and Nourishment
of Mankind: For they pretend that since Man is
not the Author of their Life, he ought not to de∣prive
'em of it.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="148"/>
I shall take this occasion to relate the Story of an
Accident that happen'd in this place, not above
eight days ago. There was a <HI>Dog</HI> that us'd always
to howl, when he heard the <HI>Muezin</HI> calling the
People to Prayers from the <HI>Minaret.</HI> The <HI>Turks,</HI>
who are Superstitious, even beyond Imagination,
cou'd not behold their most Holy Rites profan'd
by an Impudent Cur, without an extream Indig∣nation:
Yet they durst not kill him for fear of
offending GOD. However, they found out a
way to chastise the daring Criminal, without
provoking the Wrath of Heaven: For notwith∣standing
all their Veneration for his Person, they
were loath to allow him greater Privileges than they
claim for themselves. After mature deliberation
on such a weighty and important Case, they ven∣tur'd
at last to seize him, and carry him before
the <HI>Cadi,</HI> where they Indicted him as a <HI>Dgiahour,</HI>
or <HI>Christian,</HI> who derided the Law of the <HI>Prophet.</HI>
The Evidence was so plain, that after a full Hear∣ing
poor <HI>Towzer</HI> was condemn'd to be Cudgel'd to
Death, and the Sentence was immediately execu∣ted.
Perhaps the oddness of this Relation may
make you suspect my Veracity so far as to ima∣gine,
that I Invented it on purpose to divert you:
But, in short, you must either believe it, or in
plain Terms give me the Lye. 'Tis true, I dare
not warrant the truth of the Story I'm going to
tell you, but since it relates to the same Subject,
you must e'en be content to read it.</P>
<P>Besides the <HI>ordinary Dogs</HI> that wander about the
Streets, there are others call'd <HI>Jaccals,</HI> or <HI>Chacaly,</HI>
that run in the Fields, where they make a hideous
noise every Night. They do not Bark like other
Dogs, but have a kind of sharp or yelling Cry,
peculiar to themselves.</P>
<P>Now (if you'll believe the <HI>Turks</HI>) the <HI>Chacaly</HI>
or <HI>Wild-Dogs,</HI> in ancient Times, Inhabited the
<PB N="258" REF="149"/>
Cities, and the other <HI>Dogs</HI> liv'd in the Fields.
They were perpetual and irreconcilable Enemies
to each other, and fought many bloody Battles, in
one of which the <HI>Chacaly</HI> were Victorious, and the
Forces of the <HI>Dogs</HI> were so shatter'd that they
were oblig'd to beg a Peace, which was granted
by their Generous Enemies on these favourable
Terms; That the <HI>Dogs</HI> might stay in the City till
their Wounds were heal'd, during which time the
<HI>Chacaly</HI> shou'd retire to the Country; but that af∣terwards
both Parties shou'd return to their for∣mer
Habitations. These Conditions were pun∣ctually
perform'd by the <HI>Chacaly,</HI> but the <HI>Dogs</HI>
growing lusty and strong, resolv'd to maintain
their Post, and have ever since remain'd in the
City. 'Tis the remembrance of this Injury that
makes the <HI>Chacaly</HI> call to the <HI>Dogs</HI> every Night in
their yelling Language, and summon 'em to resign
a Place which they usurp'd so unjustly; and they
answer as they Bark, crying still, <HI>Yock, Yock,</HI> which,
in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language signifies <HI>No, no.</HI> But, in∣stead
of insisting longer on these insipid Fables, I
shall return to the <HI>Turkish Religion,</HI> which is little
less absurd and ridiculous.</P>
<P>They are so besotted with their Conceits about
<HI>Predestination,</HI> that they use no manner of precau∣tion
to preserve themselves from Infectious Di∣stempers,
and are offended at the <HI>Christians</HI> for taking
care of their Health on such occasions. A <HI>French∣man</HI>
told me the other Day, that during the time
of a very violent Contagion, he perceiv'd at a
distance some <HI>Turks</HI> in the Street, who were car∣rying
the Body of a Man that dy'd of the Plague
to his Grave. As he was turning another way on
purpose to avoid meeting 'em, one of the Com∣pany
ran after him, and clasp'd him in his Arms,
rubbing his Body upon him several times; after
which opening his Vest, and showing him a large
<PB N="259" REF="149"/>
Plague-Sore under his right Pap, <HI>Learn,</HI> said he,
<HI>not to forsake dead and dying Men.</HI> And indeed, if
we reflect seriously on the little care they take to
stop that raging Disease, we may reasonably con∣clude,
that none of 'em cou'd escape without a
kind of Miracle, if the Distemper were as Con∣tagious
as 'tis generally thought to be. For they
never avoid the Converse of those who come from
an infected Place, and there are few Ports where
there are not some Vessels that left the Plague
reigning in the Towns from whence they came.
Yet this neglect of the Cautions us'd by other Na∣tions
on such occasions, is never attended with
the least ill-consequence, unless when the dispo∣sition
of the Air has a sort of natural tendency
to promote and spread the Contagion, for then it
bursts forth impetuously like Gun-Powder set on
Fire. But this is not the Opinion of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
for they absolutely deny that the Infection depends
either on the Constitution of the Air, or of hu∣mane
Bodies, pretending that it proceeds wholly
from a supernatural Cause, and that when GOD
designs to execute the fury of his Vengeance on
obstinate Sinners, he sends an Army of <HI>black An∣gels</HI>
to destroy 'em. They add, that every Angel
receives of Bow and two sorts of Arrows, to inflict
either <HI>Death</HI> or <HI>Sickness,</HI> with orders to shoot their
mortal Arrows at those whom they find under the
Power of <HI>Sin,</HI> and to direct the others at such who
are only tainted with some <HI>Pollution.</HI> 'Tis then that
Men stand most in need of the Protection of their
<HI>White Angels,</HI> who intercede for 'em, and do what
they can toward the Blows that are aim'd against
'em, sometimes covering a Man entirely, when
they perceive a great number of Enemies ready
to attack him. Yet notwithstanding all their Care,
their Assistance proves oftentimes ineffectual; and
therefore 'tis the Interest of every Man that re∣gards
<PB N="260" REF="150"/>
his own Safety, to secure himself against the
Vengeance of those destroying Spirits, by leading
a sinless Life. The <HI>Turks</HI> pretend, that they infal∣libly
perceive the Blow, when the Arrow pierces
'em: And even some <HI>Franks</HI> who have been two
or three times seiz'd with the Plague, assure me,
that they felt a certain <HI>Pricking</HI> in the place where
the Carbuncles break forth; which is not at all
improbable, since 'tis usual for such a troublesome
Sensation to accompany all sorts of Tumors. But
to conclude this Subject with my Letter, I shall
only add, that the Plague which rages so often in
these Oriental Countries, and sweeps away such
vast numbers of the Inhabitants, is in some mea∣sure
necessary for their Preservation. For the num∣ber
of the People is augmented Yearly by at least
a fifth Part, and you will be the less inclin'd to look
upon this as a Paradox, if you consider that they
are allow'd to marry four Wives, and to keep seve∣ral
Concubines, and that there are 50000 Slaves
brought every Year into <HI>Turkey.</HI> So that the Coun∣try
wou'd be quickly over-stock'd with Inhabitants,
and in all probability, the People wou'd be in dan∣ger
of Starving, if their numbers were not lessen'd
by Pestilential Distempers. And notwithstanding
the terrible Havock it makes, the Land is still so full
of People, that a Man wou'd think their own In∣terest
shou'd make 'em forbid the Exportation of
<HI>Corn,</HI> especially since they have none to spare.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Proceed now to give you an account of the
<HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which (you
may remember) was the last of the three Subjects I
undertook to Discourse of. I told you once before,
and I shall take this occasion to repeat it as an
undoubted Truth, that they are opposite to us al∣most
in every thing: And this Opposition appears
in nothing more plainly, than in their obstinate
adhering to their ancient Customs. In our Coun∣try
we are never at rest till we have Invented some
new fashion; and Beauty it self wou'd hardly
please us without the Charms of Novelty. Hence
the <HI>Turks</HI> accuse the <HI>Franks</HI> of Fickleness and In∣constancy,
and boast of their own strength of
Mind that fixes steddily on solid Enjoyments,
without deigning to take notice of Trifles. I con∣fess
I was at first somewhat surpriz'd at the dif∣ference
I observ'd between their Temper and ours,
but after I had taken all possible care to free my
self of those Prejudices that are wont in such cases
to put a biass upon the Judgment, and seriously
consider'd the Genius of that Nation; I found that
what they call <HI>Strength of Mind, Constancy,</HI> or <HI>Soli∣dity,</HI>
is at the bottom nothing else but a pure <HI>in∣sensibility,</HI>
and a <HI>Weakness</HI> that is altogether inexcu∣sable
in any reasonable Creature. And you will
certainly be of the same Opinion when I have told
you, that they are so far from studying to improve
their Understandings, that in a manner they profess
and glory in their Ignorance; and that their Cu∣riosity
is confin'd within so narrow a compass, that
<PB N="262" REF="151"/>
they never undertake a Voyage without some co∣vetous
or sordid Design. Besides, their Indiffe∣rence
and Unconcern'dness for the Public Interest;
the almost Monastical Solitariness of their Life,
and the Laziness of their Temper are convincing
Proofs of the truth of my Assertion. 'Tis true
indeed, this Character must not be extended so far
as to comprehend the Principal Officers of State,
or those who are engag'd in Court-Intrigues: But
as for all the rest, they scarce ever look beyond the
Sphere of their own Families: And provided their
Wives be handsome, their Horses well Curry'd, and
their Servants Submissive and Respectful, they ne∣ver
give themselves the trouble of enquiring after
the Affairs of the rest of the World. Contented
with their Lot, they sit whole Days on a <HI>Sopha,</HI>
without any other Occupation than drinking <HI>Coffee,</HI>
smoaking <HI>Tobacco,</HI> or caressing their <HI>Wives:</HI> So that
their whole Life is a continual Revolution of
<HI>Eating, Drinking,</HI> and <HI>Sleeping,</HI> intermixt with some
dull <HI>Recreations.</HI> Yet they cannot be accus'd of
Luxury in Eating, for a Hen boil'd with Rice,
Coriander-seed, and Sugar is the best Dish that
comes before a Man of 20000 Livres a Year, and
'tis this they call <HI>Pilo.</HI> The rest of the Meal is
made up with a Dish of Fish, and some Sweet-Meats,
in which there is always more Honey than
Sugar. When the Hour of Dinner comes, they
lay upon the <HI>Sopha</HI> an Octangular or Hexagonal
Table of Olive-Wood or Walnut-Tree, inlaid with
Ivory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and usually not above a Foot and a
half in Diameter. Then having laid the Cloath,
they serve up all the Dishes one after another:
There are no Napkins laid upon the Table, but a
Servant spreads 'em on his Master's-Knees', and
stands behind him to cut his Meat; for 'tis beneath
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Grandeur to do any thing for them∣selves.
All their Vessels are of Earth; only the
<PB N="263" REF="151"/>
Great Men use Porcelain: For they reckon it a
very heinous Sin to eat in Silver, tho' the Trap∣pings
of their Horses are usually of that Metal.
They never drink at Meals, tho' they are wont to sit
a considerable while; but assoon as the Table is
remov'd, the Servants bring a Cup of <HI>Sorbet,</HI> and
then <HI>Coffee,</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI> with which they divert
themselves all the rest of the Day, unless they
take a fancy to go to the Women's Apart∣ment,
or to play at <HI>Shells</HI> with one of their
Servants, who must always suffer himself to be
beaten, as he wou'd avoid a worse Beating with
a Cudgel. At Night there is a Mat brought, with
Sheets and a Coverlet; and they Sleep all Night in
the same place where they Eat, Drunk, Play'd, and
Doz'd all the Day: For they are altogether ig∣norant
of the use of dark <HI>Alcoves,</HI> and Beds with
double Curtains. This is their constant manner of
Living, after they cease to be <HI>Youths;</HI> for betwixt
the Years of <HI>Fifteen</HI> and <HI>Twenty,</HI> they spend their
Time in <HI>Riding, Archery,</HI> throwing <HI>Darts,</HI> and other
Exercises of that nature in which they usually at∣tain
to a great Perfection. I do not think that we
have any Grooms or Jockeys in <HI>Europe</HI> that exceed
'em, tho' if you saw 'em on Horseback, you
wou'd think they cou'd not sit a moment. For
their Stirrups are so short, that they must almost
bend their Legs as much as when they sit upon a
<HI>Sopha:</HI> Their Boots are of <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>Goat's</HI>-Lea∣ther,
so wide and ill-made, that nothing can be
more troublesome to a Horseman: and all the
Furniture of their Horses is still more incommo∣dious.
Their Saddles are as large and high as a
Pack-saddle, especially before, and fasten'd on the
Horse's back, with a broad Girth or Surcingle
drawn over it, without which 'twou'd be impos∣sible
to keep it from falling off, by reason of its
weight. Instead of Bridles they use Snaffles that
<PB N="264" REF="152"/>
wou'd be thought bad enough for a Cart-Horse in
<HI>France,</HI> if they were not richly gilded. Judge, Sir,
what a Figure a Man can make on the back of a
Horse Trapp'd after such a manner, and what Com∣mand
he can have over him. Yet I assure you the
<HI>Turks</HI> rule their Horses as they please, without either
Spur or Whip, instead of which they only use a
Stick or <HI>Batoon</HI> three Foot long, and as big as a very
large Cane, which they hold in the middle, striking
the Horse sometimes with one end, and sometimes
with the other, according as they wou'd have him
turn to either side. I never saw Horses run so fast
as these, nor stretch their Bodies to so great a
length, for their Belly almost touches the Ground.
The <HI>Turks</HI> have an admirable dexterity at throwing
Darts on Horseback; for riding at a full Gallop,
they Dart their Sticks at a <HI>Turbant,</HI> which is set up as
a Mark, without once missing their Aim. And
which is still more surprizing, they throw their
<HI>Batoon</HI> as far before 'em as they can, then putting
their Horse to the swiftest Gallop they take it up
with their Hand without stopping. You will easily
perceive the extraordinary difficulty of stooping so
low to take the Stick from the Ground, if you re∣member
what I told you of the extraordinary
heighth of their Saddles and lowness of their Stir∣rups.
None but <HI>Turks</HI> are able to perform this
Feat of Activity, for the <HI>Franks</HI> are so far from
being capable of Learning it, that they can hard∣ly
ride the Horses of this Country. One of our
Merchants, newly come to this place, met with
an Accident t'other Day, that confirms the truth of
what I was saying; for his Horse ran away with
him so furiously, that he cou'd not possibly pull in
his Head; and I believe he wou'd have certainly
broke his Neck, if he had not been stop'd by a
<HI>Greek</HI> who happen'd to meet him. This proceeded
from his Ignorance of the way of stopping a Horse
<PB N="265" REF="152"/>
in this Country; for when a Horse runs away with a
Man, he must never pull the Bridle, since that wou'd
only make him go the faster; but take hold of one
of the Reins, and turn his Head to the Right-hand,
striking him with the Rod on the other side.</P>
<P>'Tis none of the least Conveniencies of this Coun∣try,
that the Keeping of a <HI>Horse</HI> is so cheap, that the
Charge of one does not amount to above 30 <HI>Piasters</HI> a
Year: 'Tis true they must be very carefully tended,
and the <HI>Turks</HI> make it their principal Business to look
after 'em. They visit 'em very often, and when they
find 'em in a good Condition, the <HI>Saïs</HI> is always
rewarded with some Caresses; but if there be any
thing amiss, he may certainly expect the <HI>Baston∣nado.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are their <HI>Servants</HI> more chargeable to 'em
than their Horses. Their <HI>Valets de Chambre</HI> cost 'em
not above 40 <HI>Piasters</HI> a year, for Wages, besides
their Entertainment, which is inconsiderable: and
the Servants without the House, such as the <HI>Saïs,
Porters,</HI> and <HI>Gardeners,</HI> have but 25. As for their
Entertainment, the Rate of their Board-Wages is
fixt at a <HI>Paras</HI> a day, besides Bread. The <HI>Paras</HI> is a
small Piece of course Silver, not exceeding the Va∣lue
of five <HI>Dutch Liards:</HI> and yet some of 'em are
such admirable Husbands, that they make a shift to
save part of so poor an Allowance.</P>
<P>I shall in the next place proceed to give you an
Account of the usual <HI>Habit</HI> of the <HI>Men.</HI> Their
<HI>Breeches</HI> are long and wide, reaching down to
their Heels, and close both behind and before, with
leathern Stockings or Socks fasten'd to the lower
part of 'em: and all this is call'd the <HI>Chascir.</HI> Their
<HI>Shirts</HI> are of very fine Cotton Cloth, made exactly
like a Woman's Smock, only they are much wider,
especially at the Sleeves, which are always left open.
Over this, instead of a Wast-Coat, they wear a
<HI>Cafetan,</HI> which is a kind of a long Cassock with
<PB N="266" REF="153"/>
narrow Sleeves, button'd at the Wrists, like the
Sleeves of our Doublets. In the Summer the <HI>Cafe∣tans</HI>
are made of very white Cotton Cloth, and in
Winter of Silk Stuff quilted with Cotton. Besides,
they are girt about the Waste with a Silken Scarf,
resembling Brocard, that serves to hang their <HI>Gangi∣are</HI>
or Poniard, the Handle of which is pretty large,
and oftentimes made of Ivory, the Teeth of a cer∣tain
Fish, or Silver, and enrich'd with Jewels either
true or counterfeit. They never appear with a
<HI>Sword</HI> or <HI>Sabre,</HI> but when they go into the Coun∣try:
nor are the <HI>Franks</HI> suffer'd to wear one, except
the Ambassadours and Consuls.</P>
<P>Their upper Habit is a Cloth Gown, which they
call a <HI>Vest.</HI> In Summer 'tis only lin'd with <HI>Taffeta;</HI>
but in Winter 'tis furr'd with a Skin, call'd <HI>Samour,</HI>
which is so costly that Great Persons have some that
are worth 1000 Crowns a piece. The Hair of it
is black, fine, and so long, that one may hide
an Egg in it; I speak only of the best sort; for
there are some of all Prices. Besides they some∣times
furr their Vests with Ermins, or with the
Skin of a bluish sort of Weasel, or of the <HI>Musco∣via</HI>
Fox; and the poorer sort with Kid, Foine,
or Lambs Skin. They never put any <HI>Gold</HI> or <HI>Silver</HI>
on their Cloaths, unless on Days of Ceremony,
such as the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s publick Entry, their Wed∣ding-Day,
or some such Solemnity: and even then
'tis the peculiar Privilege of the <HI>Bassa</HI>'s and Grandees
of the Port, to wear Ornaments of that Nature.
You see what a Difference there is between the Cu∣stoms
of this Place, and of <HI>France,</HI> where even the
<HI>Footmen</HI> are gilt all over from Head to Foot.</P>
<P><HI>Beauty</HI> is the Object of the reigning Passion of the
<HI>Turks:</HI> and when they speak of a <HI>handsome Woman</HI>
they seem to be all transport and extasie. Yet they are
oblig'd to court their Mistresses by Proxy, and even
must be contented to take a Character of 'em from
<PB REF="153"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page〉"/>
<PB N="268" REF="154"/>
Continency, are forc'd to make use of the Privi∣lege
of Keeping <HI>Concubines,</HI> or buying <HI>Slaves.</HI> For
a Man must not expect to live upon Charity here,
tho' the Women are not at all guilty of Cruelty:
but want of Opportunity hinders 'em from bestow∣ing
their Favours, and 'tis impossible for a Gallant
to thrive among such cautious Husbands. There is
no Slavery equal to that of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Women;
for a Servant may live Twenty Years in a Family
without seeing the Face of his Mistress. The Door
of the Womens Apartment is a <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> for
every thing that looks like a Man, and the utmost
Limit of the Womens Liberty; I mean Women of
Quality, who have Baths in their Houses; for the
meaner Sort must go to the public Baths at least once
a Week. Notwithstanding this close Confinement,
I'm inform'd that they sometimes venture upon a
little Recreation; but they are seldom so bold, and
the Motion must always proceed from themselves.
When they are in the Humour, and have cho∣sen
a promising Play-fellow, they send him a
Declaration of Love by some old Confident. But
wou'd you not be surpriz'd instead of a <HI>Billet-doux</HI>
to find nothing but Bits of <HI>Charcoal, Scarlet Cloth,
Saffron, Ashes,</HI> and such like Trash, wrapt up in a
Piece of Paper. 'Tis true these are as significant as
the most passionate Words; but 'tis a Mystical Lan∣guage
that cannot be understood without a <HI>Turkish</HI>
Interpreter. I know a <HI>Frank</HI> that once receiv'd such
an Invitation, and was extremely puzzl'd to know
the Meaning of it. After several successless Trials
to unriddle the Mystery, he entrusted the Secret to
one of the Ambassadour's Interpreters, who told
him that such a <HI>Bassa</HI>'s Wife desir'd him to visit her
such a day, when her Husband wou'd be gone
from home, and that the Woman who brought him
the Message wou'd introduce him to her Apartment.
At the same time he advis'd him not to go, and us'd
<PB N="269" REF="154"/>
all the Arguments that his Experience or Prudence
cou'd suggest to disswade him from exposing himself
to so terrible and unavoidable a Danger. But the
<HI>Frank</HI> had such a longing desire to taste so delicious a
Bit as he fansi'd his Unknown Mistress to be, that
he resolv'd to sacrifice all to the Dear Expectation,
and went boldly to the <HI>Bassa</HI>'s House at the time ap∣pointed,
where he really found a kind and beautiful
Lady, who put him in possession of his expected
Delight, and entertain'd him with all the Joys of
Love, for two days; at the end of which his
Strength being quite exhausted by the laborious Plea∣sure,
and finding himself altogether unfit for the Ser∣vice,
he ask'd leave to be gone, and was extremely
surpriz'd when his Request was deny'd, in a very
harsh and uncivil Manner. Then beginning to reflect
on the Interpreter's wise Admonition; he walk'd
about the whole Apartment, searching in every Cor∣ner
for a place where he might escape unperceiv'd.
At last he came to the <HI>Laundry</HI> or Washing-House,
where he found a Woman-Slave, who perceiving
his Melancholy, and guessing the Cause of it, be∣gan
to condole his Misfortune in a manner that
made him utterly despair of Relief. For she told
him that 'twas her Mistress's constant Practice to
secure her own Reputation by the Death of her Lo∣vers;
adding, that to her certain Knowledge above
<HI>Twenty</HI> of 'em had been strangl'd since she came in∣to
the Family, and that he cou'd not reasonably ex∣pect
a milder Treatment than his Predecessors had
met with before him. <HI>Yet,</HI> said she, <HI>since we are both</HI>
Christians, <HI>I'll endeavour to save your Life, if you do
not force me to hate you by refusing to grant me one Fa∣vour.
I have been shut up in this place these Twenty
Years, and in all that time have not seen the Face of
a Man:</HI> Oblige <HI>me but once, and afterwards I shall
find a way to set you at Liberty.</HI> The Terms were
somewhat hard for a Man in his Condition; but
since his Life was at stake, he made a Vertue of Ne∣cessity,
<PB N="270" REF="155"/>
and <HI>perform'd</HI> as well as he cou'd. The
poor Woman, who had been a Stranger so long to
the Pleasure of Love, was ravish'd with the unac∣custom'd
Delight; and having given him a thou∣sand
Blessings, help'd him to make his Escape thro'
the Chimney, which brought him to a Platform,
from whence he leap'd into the Street, and has ne∣ver
since found the least Inclination to make Love to
a <HI>Turkish Lady;</HI> which is certainly the most dange∣rous
Recreation that a <HI>Frank</HI> can chuse. The <HI>Turks</HI>
require so much Modesty and Discretion in their
Wives, that they wou'd never pardon 'em if they
shou'd suffer a Man to <HI>see</HI> 'em, or <HI>speak</HI> to 'em:
and I shall never forget what an <HI>Aga</HI> once said to
<HI>Monsieur de Chateauneuf</HI>'s Secretary. This Gentleman
was telling the <HI>Aga</HI> after the <HI>French</HI> way, that is very
<HI>indiscreetly,</HI> that he had seen and spoken with one
of <HI>Mahomet the Fourth</HI>'s <HI>Odalische's,</HI> who was turn'd
out of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> after that Prince's Misfortune.
The <HI>Turk,</HI> who cou'd not hear him longer with Pa∣tience,
reply'd very angrily, that she was a base Wo∣man,
and unworthy of her former Dignity. Then
the <HI>Secretary</HI> endeavour'd to persuade him that she
had no ill Design in what she did, and that 'twas
only an innocent Curiosity that made her willing to
be inform'd of the <HI>French</HI> Customs, of the Beauty
of the Ladies in that Country, and of their Way
of Living. But the <HI>Aga,</HI> instead of being pacify'd,
continu'd to rail again the <HI>Odalische</HI> so vehemently,
that the <HI>Secretary</HI> began to repent his Freedom, and
to swear and protest that she was one of the most
vertuous Persons in the World, and that she was not
guilty of the least criminal Thought. At last the
<HI>Aga,</HI> losing all Patience, reply'd in a Rage; <HI>Sir, All
that you have said signifies nothing. If she had been
honest, she wou'd never have suffer'd you to see her,
much less to speak to her. If a Man shou'd put his
<PB N="271" REF="155"/>
Hand into your Pocket, wou'd you excuse him for say∣ing
that he did it out of pure Curiosity.</HI></P>
<P>Since I have had occasion so often to mention the
<HI>Turkish Women,</HI> 'twill not be improper to give you
some Account of their <HI>Habit,</HI> which is not much
different from that of the <HI>Men,</HI> only 'tis a great
deal richer. They wear a <HI>Cafetan</HI> of Gold-Brocard,
fasten'd before with large Pearls, or little Knots of
Diamonds. It covers their Shoulders entirely, but
'tis cut so deep before, that their whole Breasts
wou'd remain naked, if their <HI>Smock,</HI> and a little
fort of <HI>Waste-Coat</HI> that comes over it, did not hide a
part of 'em. This <HI>Waste-Coat</HI> sits very close to the
Body, and keeps up the Breasts, which is a great
Conveniency to those whose Breasts are naturally
loose and swagging: so that all Defects are con∣ceal'd,
and the most curious Eye can perceive no∣thing
but <HI>enchanting Beauties.</HI> Above the <HI>Cafetan</HI>
they wear a <HI>Leathern Girdle,</HI> cover'd with Plates and
Studs of Gold and Silver, and enrich'd with preci∣ous
Stones that cast a great Lustre. Their <HI>Smock</HI> is
always of the finest flower'd Silk, and hangs over
their <HI>Chacsir,</HI> which in Summer is only made of the
same Silk, by reason of the excessive Heat. Every
prudent <HI>Christian</HI> ought to keep his Eyes from glan∣cing
that way; if it be possible for any Man to
preserve his Reason at the Sight of the enflaming
Object, for this Stuff, which is no thicker than Tif∣fany
or Gawze, gives the ravish'd Beholder an al∣most
unclouded View of all the most charming
Beauties that are so carefully conceal'd by our La∣dies.
Their upper <HI>Vest</HI> is either of Cloth or Velvet
embroider'd, or of some rich sort of Cloth of Gold:
In Summer 'tis furr'd with <HI>Ermin,</HI> and in Winter
with <HI>Samour.</HI> Their <HI>Head-Dress</HI> is so magnificent
and becoming, that you can hardly form a suitable
Idea of it unless you had seen it; tho' the follow∣ing
Description may in some measure satisfie your
<PB N="272" REF="156"/>
Curiosity. Their <HI>Talpo</HI> is a pretty long Velvet-Cap,
made of Eight Pieces, the outward Circle being
just large enough to receive the Head; but it widens
by degrees towards the Top, not unlike to a close
Crown. 'Tis adorn'd with the richest Embroidery
of Gold, Silver, and Pearls: and is so long, that it
wou'd fall back upon the Shoulders, if it were not
very artificially rais'd above the Head, where they
pleit and fold it with as much Care as our Ladies do
their <HI>Fontanges</HI> and <HI>Top-Knots.</HI> 'Tis also enrich'd
with long Strings of Pearls curiously interwoven,
and strew'd with Diamonds, Rubies, and all sorts
of Jewels, besides one or two <HI>Aigrets</HI> of Diamonds.
To keep it up they bind it about the Head with a
<HI>Frontlet,</HI> about two Fingers breadth broad, and so
rich, that it may be fitly call'd a <HI>Diadem;</HI> for 'tis
cover'd all over with Gold and Precious Stones.
Round this <HI>Frontlet</HI> there are little Gold Chains,
with a Diamond hanging at one, an Emerald at
another, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which dangle upon the Forehead, and
on both sides of the Face. I need not tell you that
such magnificent Dresses are only us'd by <HI>Bassa</HI>'s
Wives, for tho' Jewels are cheaper here than in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
they are still so chargeable, that it requires a
very considerable Estate to make so great a Figure.
However I can assure you that every Woman, ac∣cording
to her Ability, decks her self to the best
Advantage; and the whole Dowry, or the Money
that is given by the Father, is laid out on Orna∣ments
for the Bride. But when a Woman's Porti∣on
is not sufficient to purchase so many Jewels, she
must content her self with a plain <HI>Frontlet</HI> of Gold,
or Silver-gilt; and some that cannot reach so high,
only tye an embroider'd Handkerchief about their
<HI>Talpo's,</HI> which is the Dress of the poorest Sort, and
even the meanest <HI>Cobler</HI>'s Wife will not appear with∣out
it. As for their <HI>Hair,</HI> they make it up into a
long Tress, about the breadth of four Fingers, that
<PB N="273" REF="156"/>
falls backward, and sometimes reaches to their
Heels; and they whose Hair is not becoming, en∣deavour
to supply that Defect, by mixing false
Hair among it. Besides, there is a little Curl on
each side of the Forehead, that runs along the Face:
And they are very careful to keep these Curls in
Order, and to dye 'em Black with a certain Com∣position,
that serves also to dye their <HI>Brows,</HI> which
are always extremely handsome: For they take
care to have 'em shap'd with a Razor, and after∣wards
apply to the shav'd Parts a certain Paste,
call'd <HI>Pilo,</HI> which hinders the Hair from grow∣ing.</P>
<P>In <HI>Turkey,</HI> as well as in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Women generally
<HI>Paint;</HI> for tho' they're asham'd to acknowledge it, I
met with a <HI>Greekish</HI> Woman, who scrupl'd not to con∣fess
that few of her Sex abstain from that Custom.
Their <HI>White Paint</HI> is a sort of very thick Grease, which
I cannot describe, since I had not the Curiosity to
enquire how they make it. But as for their <HI>Red
Paint,</HI> 'tis nothing else but <HI>Cochineel,</HI> prepar'd with
<HI>Cream of Tartar,</HI> and boil'd so long till there re∣mains
only a Tenth Part of the Composition.
They use it with so much Success, that I believe it
might serve for <HI>Spanish Vermilion,</HI> and even is, in
my Opinion, more natural. They also Paint their
Nails Red, but not with <HI>Cochineel.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turkish</HI> Women are the most charming
Creatures in the World: They seem to be made
for Love; their Actions, Gestures, Discourse, and
Looks are all Amorous, and admirably well fitted
to kindle a soft and lasting Passion. Since they
have nothing else to do, they make it their only
Business to <HI>Please;</HI> which they do so successfully,
and in so natural and easie a Manner, that few
Husbands take the benefit of the Law, that allows
'em to divorce their Wives when they please. This
seems so strange and surprizing, that I cannot for∣bear
<PB N="274" REF="157"/>
reckoning it a sort of Prodigy, when I reflect
on the <HI>Genius</HI> of all other Nations: For Men are
usually quite cloy'd with the Pleasures of Matri∣mony
in three or four Years; and if a Maid had
nothing else but her Person to recommend her to
a Husband, she might e'en despair of ever tasting
the lawful Joys of the Bed. Whereas in this Coun∣try,
instead of enriching or maintaining their Hus∣bands,
they put 'em to so prodigious a Charge,
that none but Persons of high Quality are able to
keep four Wives. The extreme Neatness of the
<HI>Turkish</HI> Women is none of their least considerable
Charms; and this extraordinary Cleanness is an
effect of their Bathing at least once a Week; for
the nicer sort bathe twice. I think I told you be∣fore
that Women of Quality have the convenien∣cy
of Bathing at Home; and that the rest go to
the common Baths. I must now add, that the
Virtue, and even the Modesty of a Woman is as
secure in the Public, as in the Private Baths; for
Men are forbidden to enter into these Sacred Pla∣ces
under pain of Death. These Baths are large
Halls built of Marble, and cover'd with vaulted
Roofs in form of <HI>Domes;</HI> on the Top of which there
are Glass-Windows to let in the Light, without
suffering the Heat to evaporate. There are no
Windows in the Walls, that the Women may
undress themselves without fear of exposing their
Naked Beauties to the Observation of some Curi∣ous
Enquirer into the Works of Nature; and be∣sides,
they take care to cover their Distinguishing
Parts with a Cloth wrapt about their Belly, and
tied on the Back. Then they Sweat a quarter of
an Hour or longer; and for the Conveniency of
those who are desirous to bathe in Water, there
is in the same Place a Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Bathing-Tub,
which they fill with hot Water by turning a Cock,
tempering and allaying it when 'tis excessively
<PB N="275" REF="157"/>
hot, by turning another Cock that lets in cold
Water. There are Waiting-Women always ready
to attend those who come to bathe, who for a
small Reward crack all the Joynts of their Arms,
Legs, and Thighs. At the same time they anoint
the hairy Parts of the Body with <HI>Pilo,</HI> which makes
the Hair fall off, and leaves the Skin extremely
white and smooth. The Men have their Baths
apart, and are serv'd after the same manner.</P>
<P>There are three sorts of <HI>Recreations</HI> us'd by the
<HI>Turks; Gaming, Musick,</HI> and <HI>Dancing.</HI> You may
perceive by the Account I gave you of their <HI>Games,</HI>
that they are neither Pleasant nor Ingenious: And
I shall take this occasion to tell you, that their <HI>Mu∣sick</HI>
is rather a hideous Dinn than a regular Har∣mony,
and resembles exactly the howling Shrieks
of a tortur'd Wretch. The first time I heard a
<HI>Turk</HI> sing, I cou'd not forbear stopping to look up∣on
him, concluding that he was certainly Mad:
For I cou'd not imagine that a Man who had the
use of his Reason, wou'd take pleasure in distort∣ing
his Body, and rolling his Eyes in so odd and
extravagant a manner; tho' they pretend that all
those unusual Motions are only the Marks and
Effects of a tender and violent Passion. Their <HI>Mu∣sical
Instruments</HI> are extremely suitable to the Na∣ture
of their Harmony: For they have a kind of
<HI>Violin</HI> with three Strings, a Neck as long as a Man's
Arm, and a great Belly like the Block of a Hat;
some ill-contriv'd <HI>Flutes;</HI> little <HI>Timbrels</HI> about the
bigness of one's Fist, a <HI>Drum,</HI> some paultry <HI>Haut∣bois,</HI>
and several little Brazen <HI>Targets,</HI> which they
hold in their Hands, and knock against one ano∣ther.
Judge, Sir, what a mad Consort they make
with the confus'd jangling of so many inharmoni∣ous
Instruments. The only tolerable Instrument
they have is the <HI>Psalterion,</HI> which is cover'd with
Latten Strings, stretcht as upon a <HI>Harpsical;</HI> and
<PB N="276" REF="158"/>
they strike upon 'em with little Sticks, which
they hold betwixt their two Fingers. All the Wo∣men
play admirably well on this Instrument, for
'tis their usual Diversion in their Chambers, e∣specially
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> whose Musick may be heard
with Pleasure, since 'tis a great deal more agree∣able
than that of the <HI>Turks.</HI> I shall only add on
this Subject, that neither of 'em sing the Notes
without the Words; and our way of singing
Tunes seems so ridiculous to 'em, that they usual∣ly
laugh at the <HI>Franks,</HI> and ask 'em what their
<HI>Tartara lera</HI> signifies.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Dances</HI> are also of different kinds. Those
which are us'd by Persons of Quality are taught by
Masters and Mistresses, the first being appointed to
teach Men, and the others Women. Tho' they
are all very grave, there is a great deal of Action
requir'd in the Hands and Arms; and the finest
part of the Dance consists in the graceful and dex∣terous
Motions of those Parts: For the Beauty
and Niceness of the Step cannot be well distin∣guish'd
by reason of those troublesome <HI>Chacsirs</HI> that
hide the whole Legs. The <HI>Turks</HI> never give any
Balls, for they always Dance single; and the Dan∣cing
of two Persons together wou'd be reckon'd
a Crime, or at least an indecency among 'em.
Thus after one Person has entertain'd the Compa∣ny
for some time, the Spectators express their Ap∣probation
by repeated clapping of Hands. Besides
'tis to be observ'd, that the Women never Dance
but when they are invited to the Wedding of some
of their Relations, or when they make a familiar
Visit to some of their She-Friends, which happens
very unfrequently. Yet there are some Publick
Dancing-Women, who go to Private Families
when they are call'd, and Dance before 'em in
the most Lascivious manner imaginable: For they
wriggle their Backs, roll their Eyes, seem to swoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

away, and put their Bodies into a Thousand ob∣scene
Postures, which the most shameless Strum∣pets
in <HI>Europe</HI> wou'd hardly be persuaded to imi∣tate.</P>
<P><HI>Dancing</HI> is most in use among the Peasants, who
without pretending to Art, or learning any regular
Steps, put their Bodies into such odd and extrava∣gant
Postures, that the nimblest Dancing-Master
wou'd be extremely puzl'd to imitate. They seem
to be actually possess'd with a Devil, and from
Time to Time break forth into such loud and fu∣rious
Shouts, that one wou'd certainly conclude 'em
to be acted by some <HI>Daemon,</HI> if he did not know
that all these Motions are only feign'd Transports.
They usually hold a great Stick in their Hands,
with which they beat the Walls and Ground in a
furious and terrible Manner, and continue those
violent Agitations of their Feet, Hands, and Head,
till their Weariness and want of Strength oblige
them to give over; and even sometimes they Dance
till they fall down in a sort of Extasie or Fit of
Dizziness. I had the Pleasure to see all those va∣rious
kinds of Dances at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in Monsieur
<HI>de Chateauneuf</HI>'s House, on the Day appointed to so∣lemnize
the Publick Joy for the advantageous Suc∣cess
of the Campagne against the <HI>Christians.</HI> And
these Diversions were succeeded by a certain odd
kind of Show, perform'd by the <HI>Jews.</HI> Since all
sorts of Figures are an abomination to the <HI>Turks,</HI>
there were <HI>Puppets</HI> represented in Shadows on the
Wall, which Danc'd and Sung to the Satisfaction
of all the Company, as it appear'd by their Laugh∣ing
and pleasant Humour. I cou'd not understand
the Words of their Songs, but if I may be allow'd
to judge of their Expressions by their Postures,
they were certainly very obscene; for I never saw
any thing so brutish as the Representations of those
Shadows. Nor will this appear strange to those
<PB N="278" REF="160"/>
who consider that the <HI>Turks</HI> are more addicted to
that infamous Vice for which <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI>
were destroy'd, than any other Nation in the
World; and that the Advancement of one half
of the great Officers in the Empire, is an Effect of
their base Complaisance to their beastly Patrons.
Thus the <HI>Turkish</HI> Songs are doubly naufeous to
the <HI>Franks,</HI> who are not accustom'd to such horrid
Impurities.</P>
<P>The <HI>Puppet-Show</HI> was follow'd by another of
almost the same Nature. Four <HI>Jews</HI> ty'd certain
Sticks cross-wise to their Wrists and Feet, and
clothing them like Men and Women, plac'd them∣selves
all under one Covering; then the first stretch∣ing
out one of his Arms, made the half Figures
Dance and Sing; after him came another; then a
third; and at last the eight Arms of the four <HI>Jews</HI>
perform'd several extravagant Motions on the Co∣vering,
accompany'd with a confus'd Din; after
which they stood upon their Heads, and discover∣ing
eight larger Figures that were fastned to their
Feet, entertain'd the Company with another Show
exactly like the former.</P>
<P>I had occasion in some of my former Letters to
mention the rest of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Customs; and you
may conclude that what I have omitted is either
inconsiderable, or very particularly describ'd by o∣ther
Travellers. And therefore I shall conclude this
Subject after I have added one or two Observati∣ons
concerning their <HI>Civility.</HI> They seldom make
any Visits, but when they come to treat of Busi∣ness;
and those who do are always entertain'd
with <HI>Perfumes, Coffee,</HI> and <HI>Sherbet,</HI> as in the Account I
gave you of Monsieur <HI>de Chasteauneuf</HI>'s Reception at
the <HI>Caimacan</HI>'s House. The Left-hand is reckon'd
the Place of Honour, because 'tis next the Heart;
and when they salute, instead of pulling off their
Turbants, they lay their Hands upon their Breast,
<PB N="279" REF="160"/>
and at the same time bow their Bodies, which
they repeat several times when they wou'd express a
more than ordinary Affection to the Person whom
they salute. This is the whole Ceremony of a
simple Salutation; but when they intend to show a
profound Respect, they must not only lay their
Hand upon their Breast, but make several low Bows,
and with all the signs of Humility kiss the lower
part of the Person's Vest; after which they stand
upright, and continue still to keep their Hand up∣on
their Breast, or even sometimes both Hands, while
they are in the presence of him whom they wou'd
respect. When he goes abroad, they must make a
Lane for him, as they see his Servants do, and sa∣lute
him with a low Bow as he passes by. Besides,
in the Absence of the Servants, they usually pre∣sent
their Hands to hold him under the Arms when
he goes up or down Stairs, or Mounts his Horse,
and on some other Occasions of the same Nature;
But when his Servants are present, 'tis their Office
to offer their Assistance to their Master. When a
<HI>Frank</HI> makes a Visit to his <HI>Turkish</HI> Friends, they still
present him with a <HI>Pipe</HI> after his <HI>Coffee;</HI> which is a
very troublesom piece of Civility to those who have
so strong an Aversion to <HI>Tobacco</HI> as I have, especial∣ly
considering the peremptory Stiffness of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
who will not admit of the most reasonable Excuse.
Some great Persons smoak a sort of perfum'd <HI>To∣bacco,</HI>
like that of which <HI>Spanish Snuff</HI> is made; but
our <HI>Franks</HI> never use any of that kind.</P>
<P>I have had occasion five or six times to speak
of their <HI>Persons of Quality,</HI> without acquainting you
with the Nature of their Grandeur and Nobility;
and therefore I shall conclude this Letter with a
short Account of it. You must not imagine that
these are Persons of an Ancient and Noble Extra∣ction;
for tho' there may be some of 'em that are
honourably descended, the greatest part of 'em
<PB N="280" REF="161"/>
owe their Advancement merely to Fortune, or
are the Creatures of some <HI>Bassa;</HI> and their first
Preferments are only the Rewards of their Ser∣vice.
Thus we frequently see that a poor Slave
is advanc'd by degrees to the highest Dignities
in the Empire; and it may be said in the ge∣neral,
that Riches are the Fountain of Honour in
<HI>Turkey.</HI> This Reflexion puts me in Mind of a blunt
Repartee that was made to the Marquess <HI>de la
Marzelliere</HI> by one of these Pretenders to Nobility.
This Marquess was descended of one of the most
illustrious Families in <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> and yet scrupl'd
not to marry a Citizen's Daughter of St. <HI>Malo's,</HI>
who brought him a Portion of Two hundred thou∣sand
Pounds. However, it seems, her Brother, whose
Fortune was equal to hers, did not think himself
much honour'd by this Allyance; for imagining
that the Lustre of his Gold was bright enough to
make amends for the Obscurity of his Birth, he
wou'd never be persuaded to shew the least respect
to his Brother-in-Law. One Day as they were di∣sputing
about some Points of Honour, after several
angry Replies, he told the Marquess he knew no
Reason why he shou'd be so proud of a Title, and
at last added, that he was as good a Marquess as
himself. <HI>Marquess of what?</HI> said Monsieur <HI>de la Mar∣zelliere;
Of what?</HI> reply'd he, <HI>I'm Marquess of Two
Hundred Thousand Crowns in good Lewis d'Ors.</HI></P>
<P>I have made it my Business to be acquainted with
the Arch-Bishop of this Place, who is a Person of
Wit and Merit, and has given me a particular Ac∣count
of the principal Differences between the <HI>Grae∣cian</HI>
and <HI>Romish</HI> Religions; which I intend shall be
the Subject of my next Letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter the general <HI>Idea</HI> I have given you of the
Religion and Customs of the <HI>Turks,</HI> you will
perhaps expect an Account of their <HI>Christian</HI> Sub∣jects,
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and read with pleasure some Re∣marks
on a Subject of which I have often observ'd
that even the more inquisitive part of our <HI>European</HI>
World have but a very slight and confus'd Noti∣on.</P>
<P>The present Condition of this Nation is so mi∣serable,
and so apt to produce all the most
tender Motions of Compassion in those who se∣riously
reflect upon it, that 'twou'd be needless to
heighten the Gloominess of the Prospect by com∣paring
it with their former Glory, which after a
long and fatal Eclipse, was restor'd to its ancient
Splendor by <HI>Constantine the Great,</HI> whose Memory
will last till the final Period of the World. But
the Empire of the <HI>East,</HI> which he founded, and u∣nited
to that of the <HI>West,</HI> was divided again after
his Death, and continu'd in a declining Condition
till the final Overthrow of the <HI>Palaeologi</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI>
in the Fifteenth Age; since which time the <HI>Greeks</HI>
have still been Slaves in a Country of which they
were formerly Sovereigns; and to redeem them∣selves
from the Yoak under which they are born,
they are forc'd to pay a yearly Tribute, call'd the
<HI>Carache,</HI> which is only impos'd upon them, and
their Fellow-Slaves the <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Carache</HI> is a per∣petual
Poll-Tax, and exceeds not four <HI>Piasters</HI> a
Man; and yet since 'tis a Mark of their Bondage,
they have left no Means unessay'd to deliver them∣selves
<PB N="282" REF="162"/>
from it, and have even offer'd to raise more
considerable Summs another way. Besides, there
are oftentimes large <HI>Avanies</HI> impos'd upon 'em,
which they levy among themselves, according to
the proportion of their Estates. All their Patri∣archs,
Bishops, and Abbots are also oblig'd to pay
for their Patents; and the Prices that are exacted
of 'em cannot but amount to a very conside∣rable
Summ, since there are above five Thousand
Arch-Bishops and Bishops in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire,
who, reckoning one with another, pay above
two Thousand <HI>Piasters</HI> a-piece, as a Fine to the
<HI>Grand Signior.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> are naturally Proud,
and lovers of Pomp and Magnificence: Most of
'em spend higher than their Estates will bear, and
are very fond of the Title of <HI>Chelety</HI> or <HI>Lord.</HI> Yet
even the richest of 'em, of which there is a consi∣derable
Number, are look'd upon as Objects of
Scorn and Contempt by the <HI>Turks.</HI> 'Tis true, they
are not insensible of their Slavery, and perhaps
wou'd willingly shake off the insupportable Yoak
of their Domineering Masters; but the Natural
Impatience of their Temper is more than sufficient∣ly
curb'd by their Weakness, and want of Power;
and they must e'en content themselves with repi∣ning
in secret at the resistless Tyranny of their Op∣pressors:
For they are seldom or never able to ob∣tain
Satisfaction for the Injuries they receive from
the <HI>Turks,</HI> if the Offenders are not wholly destitute
both of Friends and Money.</P>
<P>The Habit of the <HI>Greeks</HI> is very different from
that of the <HI>Turks.</HI> They are not permitted to wear
a white <HI>Turbant;</HI> nor must their <HI>Turbants</HI> be of the
same bigness with those that are us'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI>
nor folded after the same manner: For they only
wrap a little piece of Course Cloth, either blue or
strip'd with blue, two or three times about their
Caps; and even usually they wear none at all, but
<PB N="283" REF="162"/>
content themselves with a little red Cap which is
not large enough to cover their Ears. Instead of a
Vest they have only a plain Wast-coat, which is ve∣ry
short, and open before; and over that they
wear another that meets on the side. Neither ought
they to wear a <HI>Chacsir</HI> after the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fashion; for
their Breeches are very short, and reach not below
the Knee. And besides, they are distinguish'd
from the <HI>Turks</HI> by their red <HI>Babouches;</HI> for those
that are us'd by the <HI>Turks</HI> are yellow. Thus I have
given you a short Account of the Habit of the
<HI>Greeks;</HI> but tho' most of 'em do, and all of 'em are
oblig'd to wear it, some of the richer sort are so
far from observing these Regulations, that they can
scarce be distinguish'd from the <HI>Turks</HI> but by their
<HI>Turbants:</HI> And even all Persons of Note, whether
<HI>Franks</HI> or <HI>Greeks,</HI> put on white <HI>Turbants</HI> when they
go out of the City, as I have had occasion to see
above fifty times. The <HI>Turks</HI> have of late conniv'd
at those Innovations; but they have still such a
veneration for <HI>Green,</HI> that the <HI>Greeks</HI> dare not pre∣sume
to wear it: nor wou'd it be safe for <HI>Franks</HI>
to wear Green in the midst of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> tho' I
have often seen 'em make bold with that sacred Co∣lour.
Since the Women are generally invisible,
they are not oblig'd to observe these Marks of Di∣stinction;
and the only difference between their
Habit and way of Dressing, and that of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
is that they must, as well as the Men, abstain from
wearing <HI>Green.</HI> Nor is there a less Resemblance be∣tween
'em in their Manners and Customs, and in
their solitary way of living; tho' they find so much
sweetness in the Freedom that prevails among us,
that they whose Husbands or Fathers have frequent
Occasions to converse with <HI>Franks,</HI> are easily dis∣pos'd
to renounce their wonted Severity. They are
lovers of Pleasures, Dancing, and magnificent Ha∣bits;
and will fix a Passion upon a Man whether
<PB N="284" REF="163"/>
he will or not. But the poor <HI>Frank</HI> that suffers
himself to be noos'd, must resolve either to be
Hen-peck'd, or a Cuckold: He must adore his
<HI>Graecian</HI> Spouse; he must furnish her with the rich∣est
Habits, and keep a numerous Train of Slaves to
attend her; or, if any of these things be wanting,
<HI>'Ware Horns.</HI> For the <HI>Franks</HI> have an excellent Fa∣culty
at curing a handsome Lady of the grumbling
Disease, and are always ready to do a kind Office
to a Country-man's Wife.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Dances are extremely pleasant, and
full of Mirth. They are of two kinds: The first
is a sort of Country-Dance or <HI>Couranto,</HI> danc'd by
Pairs; and the second a kind of <HI>Gavote</HI> or <HI>Branle,</HI>
in which the Men and Women are mingl'd, as
at <HI>Passepied</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> only you must hold in your
right-hand the Left-hand of your Left-hand Wo∣man,
and in your Left the Right-hand of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that is on your Right-hand. The Man who lead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Dance holds the Corner of a Handkerchi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and gives the other to his Lady, that he may hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
room enough to take his Measures, and to giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Dance what Figure or Turn he pleases. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
first they begin very gravely with a <HI>Saraband</HI>-Ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
two Steps forwards and three backwards: The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
mending their pace by degrees, they begin to le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and run, yet still observing the Rules of a Harmo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
nious Motion; so that the Dance becomes very
Gay and Amorous: For the Women leaping on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Step forwards, draw their Bodies backwards with a
certain pretty Turn that cannot be call'd immo∣dest,
yet gives a Man occasion to think of some∣thing
more than he sees. And besides, the Mu∣sick
contributes very much to the pleasantness of
their Dances, for their Tunes are extremely Brisk
and Airy.</P>

<P><PB REF="164"/>
<PB N="285" REF="164"/>
The fittest time to take the pleasure of viewing
their way of Dancing, is when they are met at a
Wedding; for on such Occasions they give them∣selves
up to Joy and Pleasure, drinking, eating,
and sporting, and indulging themselves in all man∣ner
of Diversions. The next Morning the young
Woman's Relations make a Visit to the new∣marry'd
Couple, and examine the Bridegroom con∣cerning
his Wife's Virginity: Then they take the
Bride's Bloody Smock, and expose it to the View
of all the Company, as if it were some rare Cu∣riosity.
The <HI>Jews</HI> observe the same Custom at the
Marriage of a Maid, and are even nicer and
more scrupulous in this Point than the <HI>Greeks;</HI>
for if the Bride's Honesty be not confirm'd by the
Blood that appears on her Smock, her Reputation
is irrecoverably lost, and she is immediately di∣vorc'd
from her Husband. They unanimously a∣gree
in believing that this is an infallible Mark
of Virginity: And this Opinion is so generally
receiv'd thro' all <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> that if a Man
shou'd endeavour to contradict it, he wou'd expose
himself to the Laughter and Derision of all that
shou'd hear him. The <HI>Italians</HI> are also persuaded
of the Certainty of this Experiment, tho' they ab∣stain
from making a Shew of the Bloody Smock,
for fear of exposing their own Shame; but the
Husband examines his Bride very narrowly, and
if he finds her not such as he expects and desires,
'tis in vain for her to endeavour by the most so∣lemn
Protestations to convince him of her Innocen∣cy.
Nevertheless this way of trying the Chastity
of a Maid is esteem'd uncertain and ridiculous by
the <HI>French,</HI> and even by Chirurgeons; nor can I
reflect without a certain Wonder and Astonish∣ment
on this Diversity of Opinions concerning a
Question that one wou'd think might have been
fully decided by so many repeated Experiments;
<PB N="286" REF="165"/>
for I see no reason to believe that our Country-Women
are fram'd after another manner than the
rest of their Sex. But leaving this Controversie to
be decided by others who are better acquainted
with the Works of Nature, I shall proceed in the
Account I promis'd to give you of the most re∣markable
<HI>Graecian</HI> Customs, among which I cannot
forbear taking notice of one that seems to be pecu∣liar
to this Nation. On <HI>Easter-Day,</HI> and during the
three following Weeks, they salute one another
with three Kisses, one on the Mouth, and one on
each Cheek, at the same time repeating these Words,
<HI>Christos anesti,</HI> that is, <HI>Christ is risen.</HI> At other times
their familiar Salutation is the same with that
which is us'd by the <HI>Turks:</HI> But when they design
to shew a more than ordinary Respect to a Man,
they kiss his Hand, and then lay it upon their
Heads. They observe the same Custom when they
receive a Present, if it be not either too heavy
or bulky: For this Ceremony of laying a Man's
Hand upon their Head, is a Mark both of their
Respect and Gratitude. When a Woman accom∣panies
her Husband in a Visit to a Person of Qua∣lity,
such as a <HI>Consul,</HI> whether they come to treat of
Bus'ness, or only out of Civility, she stands direct∣ly
behind her Husband; and when the Visiter
brings his Daughters along with him, they place
themselves at one another's Back behind their Mo∣ther;
so that the Husband standing in the Front
of the File, hides all his Female Train; and when
they intend to go out, they make a half-Turn to
the Right, and the Daughters march out first, to
avoid the Indecency of appearing in a Stranger's
Presence.</P>
<P>In pursuance of the Method I propos'd to fol∣low,
I shall in the next place consider their Reli∣gion.
I'm oblig'd to my Friend, the Archbishop,
for the following Account, which perhaps will
<PB N="287" REF="165"/>
give you a clearer <HI>Idea</HI> of this Subject than you can
draw from the Relations of others. For there are
some who pretend that the <HI>Greeks</HI> are only <HI>Schis∣maticks,</HI>
or bare Separatists from the <HI>Romish</HI> Church;
whereas others stretch the Point too far on the
other side, and make their Differences in matter of
Doctrine appear greater and more irreconcilable
than they really are.</P>
<P>They acknowledge only One visible <HI>Church</HI> of
God, without which there is no Salvation, unless
in the Case of a sudden Conversion at the Hour
of Death.</P>
<P>They believe that the Apostles instituted five <HI>Pa∣triarchs</HI>
to govern the Church upon the Earth, who
were seated at <HI>Rome, Alexandria, Constantinople, An∣tioch,</HI>
and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and under them several Arch∣bishops,
Bishops, and inferiour Pastors. All the
Members of this Hierarchy have a Right to exer∣cise
a Spiritual Jurisdiction over those that are sub∣ordinate
to 'em, and to inflict Ecclesiastical Cen∣sures.
But the Patriarchs can only admonish one
another, and can neither be punish'd nor depos'd
for their Offences but by the Sentence of a Gene∣ral
Council. Yet their Power does not extend
so far as to enable 'em to introduce new Laws
into the Church, and they wou'd be laught at if
they shou'd attempt to grant Indulgencies. The
Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> is the first of the Patriarchs; nor
do any of the rest pretend to dispute with him for
Precedency: But they refuse to submit to that ab∣solute
Power he has assum'd in the <HI>West,</HI> by ta∣king
Advantage of the Superstition and Simplicity
of the People, and the Connivance of the Princes.
'Tis plain that the <HI>Greek</HI> Bishops had Reason to re∣fuse
their Consent to the Introduction and Esta∣blishment
of a Tyrannical Power in the Church,
since they cou'd not but foresee that it wou'd pro∣duce
very fatal and pernicious Consequences: And
<PB N="288" REF="166"/>
yet this is the only Cause that made the Pope
discharge his Thunders against 'em, and declare
'em <HI>Schismaticks;</HI> thus violently breaking the sacred
Union of the Church, for the Preservation of
which he ought to have spent the last Drop of
his Blood. For this reason the <HI>Greeks</HI> are not con∣tented
with returning the Charge of <HI>Schism</HI> upon the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church, but pretend that they never actually
separated from the Communion of <HI>Rome,</HI> since
they have not establish'd a <HI>Fifth Patriarch,</HI> and still
acknowledge the <HI>Pope</HI> to be the <HI>first Bishop</HI> in the
World, and that therefore they cannot with the
least Shadow of Justice be blam'd for the Fault of
another, or said to separate from a Church which
has violently driven 'em out of her Communion.
I know not whether this is the Opinion of the whole
<HI>Greek</HI> Church; tho' I cannot reasonably decline giving
Credit to a Thing which I have heard so often con∣firm'd
with repeated Protestations by the Archbishop
of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> who is esteem'd one of the most learned
Doctors of that Church in this Age. However,
I took the Liberty to ask him why they did
not send their Bishops to the last Councils that
were held in the <HI>West,</HI> in which all their Differen∣ces
might have been amicably terminated. He
reply'd, that their Absence wou'd be easily excus'd
by those who consider the Severity of the Yoak
under which they groan; and that the sending of
Deputies to the Councils wou'd have given a ter∣rible
Umbrage to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> who wou'd
have been apt to suspect that these Bishops were
sent to contrive a Rebellion against him, and to
plot the Ruine of his Empire; and to deliver him∣self
from the danger of a Revolt, might have been
easily persuaded to have put the whole Nation un∣der
Military Execution. This Answer seem'd so
reasonable, and agreeable to the Truth, that I
was oblig'd to acknowledge my self intirely satis∣fy'd.
<PB N="289" REF="166"/>
Thus I have given a short Account of
the Occasion of the fatal Breach that divides the
<HI>Eastern</HI> and <HI>Western</HI> Churches, and of the Reasons
alledg'd by the <HI>Greeks</HI> to free themselves of the
Imputation of <HI>Schism.</HI> I shall in the next Place
examine the Points of Doctrine in which they dif∣fer
from the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>The Difference between these Churches may be
reduc'd to five Articles, of which only two are
Fundamentals: For tho' the other three are of con∣siderable
Moment, they wou'd not be sufficient to
excuse a Separation. The first is the <HI>Procession of
the Holy Ghost,</HI> who in their Opinion proceeds not
from the <HI>Son,</HI> but only from the <HI>Father.</HI> To illustrate
and confirm this Doctrine, the Archbishop told me,
that the <HI>Three Persons</HI> of the <HI>Trinity</HI> were only di∣stinguish'd
by their different Operations and Attri∣butes;
That the Property of the <HI>Father</HI> was to be∣get
without being begotten; That of the <HI>Son,</HI> to
be eternally begotten, without begetting; and
that of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> to inspire and sanctifie our
Hearts. I reply'd, That it did not necessarily fol∣low,
because the <HI>Son</HI> was begotten, that he cou'd
not co-operate with the <HI>Father</HI> in the <HI>Procession of
the Holy Ghost:</HI> But he wou'd not acknowledge
the force of this Reason, pretending that we cou'd
not ascribe to the <HI>Son</HI> the Attribute of <HI>Generation,</HI>
that belongs only to the <HI>Father,</HI> without overturn∣ing
the Order, and confounding the Persons of
the <HI>Trinity.</HI> Then he repeated what he had said
before, that the Persons were only distinguish'd by
their Attributes; f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om whence he concluded that
the latter cou'd not be confounded without con∣founding
the former. And for a farther Confir∣mation
of his Opinion, he shew'd me a large Vo∣lume
of S. <HI>Athanasius,</HI> printed at <HI>Venice,</HI> with the
<HI>Latin</HI> on one side, and the <HI>Greek</HI> on the other, and
made me take Notice of two Passages, which I
<PB N="290" REF="167"/>
transcrib'd, but have unhappily lost the Paper.
However, tho' I cannot at present call to Mind
the very Words of the Author. I remember that
in the first Passage he spoke of the <HI>Holy Ghost's</HI>
proceeding from the <HI>Father,</HI> without mentioning
the Son. I reply'd, that the Question was not
whether the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> proceeded from the Father;
and that the Author whom he cited did not deny
his Procession from the <HI>Son.</HI> But I was oblig'd to
acknowledge that the same Answer wou'd not
serve to elude the positive Authority of another
Passage which he shew'd me in the <HI>Nicene Creed,</HI>
where 'tis expressly said, <HI>à solo Patre procedens.</HI> Thus
my Mouth was stopt on this Subject, as well as
on the former; and I must leave the Decision
of this Controversie to those whose Profession
obliges 'em to search into these Mysteries.</P>
<P>The second difference between the <HI>Romish</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI>
Churches, is concerning the Doctrine of <HI>Purgatory,</HI>
which the latter expressly denies, affirming, with us,
that 'tis absolutely injurious to the Merit and Satisfa∣ction
of Christ: Yet they pretend there is a certain
Baptismal Fire, through which every one must
pass before he can be admitted into <HI>Paradise.</HI>
They believe that the Souls of Just Persons at
their Separation from the Body, go into a Third
Place, of the same Nature with the <HI>Romish Lim∣bo's,</HI>
where they must remain till the Day of Judg∣ment,
at which Time a sudden Fire shall dissolve
the World in an Instant, and purifie the Souls of
the Righteous, who after their final Judgment,
shall be receiv'd into everlasting Glory. To con∣firm
this Doctrine, they alledge that Passage of the
Scripture which speaks of the Souls that <HI>rest under
the Altar:</HI> But after all, this Opinion seems not
to be so well grounded as the former; for if the
Dead are not in a suffering Condition, I know
<PB N="291" REF="167"/>
not what Reason they can give to justifie their
praying for 'em.</P>
<P>The third Point is the <HI>Communion under both kinds:</HI>
for they give the Sacrament to the People in a
Spoon, in which the Bread and Wine are mixt to∣gether.</P>
<P>The Fourth is concerning <HI>Leaven'd Bread,</HI>
which they use in the Consecration of the Sacra∣ment.</P>
<P>The Fifth and last Point in which they differ
from those of the <HI>Romish</HI> Persuasion is the <HI>Celibacy
of the Clergy:</HI> For a simple Priest is allow'd to mar∣ry
once, but must never proceed to a second Mar∣riage.
The Priests wear the Violet-colour'd Habit
of a Bishop, and a Cap of the same Colour, with
a little blue <HI>Turbant;</HI> and behind their Cap there
hangs a piece of Cloth of the same Colour a∣bout
half a Foot long and broad, which falls back
on their Shoulders. Besides these Priests, there
are certain Religious Persons under a Vow of
Chastity; and out of their Number the Bishops,
and even the Pastors, are chosen, whom they call
<HI>Papa's:</HI> They eat no Flesh, and wear long Hair,
without ever touching it with Scissors: They al∣so
suffer their Beards to grow without shaving or
clipping 'em, which disfigures their Faces, and
makes 'em seem very ugly. They wear a large
black Gown or Robe, not much different from
our Night-Gowns; only their Sleeves are wider,
and button'd before; and the Neck is like that of
a Cassock. Their Caps are made of Felt, flat
beneath like the Block of a Hat, and wou'd be
very deep, if they were not cut before; so that
the whole Face appears, but the Ears and hinder∣part
of the Head are cover'd. Over this they
wear a Kerchief of black Serge, which hangs o∣ver
their Shoulders. This Habit is generally us'd
by all religious Persons, Pastors, Bishops, and Arch∣bishops,
<PB N="292" REF="168"/>
without any Mark of Distinction; only
the Bishops carry in their Hands a Pastoral Staff
of Ebony, eight Foot long, with an Ivory Ball
on the Top. The Bishops are not usually rich, but
they are no less respected by their Clergy than
our <HI>French</HI> Prelates are by theirs. Their Churches
are built after the manner of ours, but without
the least appearance of Pomp or Grandeur. They
have a Quire where the Priests place themselves,
with those that come to confess; and a Place for
the Church-Wardens, with a Crucifix, or a Saint,
to which every one presents an Offering. The
Bishops do not observe so much State as in <HI>France;</HI>
for my Curiosity having one Day carry'd me to
see 'em Officiate, the Archbishop rose up to sa∣lute
me, and made me sit down by him on one
of the Seats in the Quire, whither a Priest con∣ducted
me by his Order; after which they brought
me some Frankincense, as they do to all Persons
of Note of their own Nation. Their Pontifical
Habit is so singular and odly contriv'd, that
'twou'd be a hard Task to represent it distinctly;
and therefore I will neither undertake the De∣scription
of that, nor of their Ceremonies and
Rites of Worship. I shall only add, that when
they enter the Church, they take some Holy-Water,
and make five large Signs of the Cross,
at each of which they make a very low Bow, repeat∣ing
the same Ceremony when they go out, to
commemorate the five Wounds of our Savi∣our.</P>
<P>It has been so positively asserted by so many
celebrated Divines, that the Doctrine of <HI>Transub∣stantiation</HI>
is not acknowledg'd by the <HI>Greek</HI> Church,
that I dare hardly venture to contradict 'em. How∣ever,
since neither Interest not Authority ought to
deterr us from owning the Truth, I'm resolv'd at
all Adventures to undeceive you of so vulgar an
<PB N="293" REF="168"/>
Error. 'Tis plain that the Authors of those Relations,
on whose Credit that Opinion is grounded, were
either deceiv'd themselves, or intended to deceive
their Readers; unless perhaps to soften the harshness
of that Censure you had rather believe that they
speak of some obscure Sect, which is not known in
thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Countrey: For I can assure you that the <HI>Greeks</HI>
at <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Smyrna</HI> are as firmly perswaded
of the truth of that Doctrine as the most zealous
<HI>Romanists;</HI> and the only reason why they do not
kneel at the Elevation of the Host, is because
their manner of Adoration is different from ours.
Nor do they worship the Sacrament less devoutly
by bowing their Body, and smiting their Breast,
tho' they stand all the while on their Feet, than
we do by prostrating our selves on the Ground;
and therefore we ought rather to consider the In∣tention
of their Mind than the Posture of their
Body. But this is not all; for they have a Cu∣stom
which may serve for a convincing Proof of
their Belief of that Opinion. On <HI>Good-Friday</HI> they
walk in Procession to the <HI>French</HI> Church, to adore
the Sacrament which is expos'd there, and even
pay five hundred <HI>Piasters</HI> to the <HI>Turks</HI> that they
may be suffer'd to perform their Devotions there
on that Occasion: So true it is that they are not
willing to be separated from the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI>
You may depend upon the Certainty of this Sto∣ry;
for I can assure you of the Truth of it on
the Faith of an Eye-Witness.</P>
<P>They have a great Number of <HI>Images;</HI> and
their Devotion to 'em is not at all inferior to that
which prevails in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> But I must
confess there is a great Difference in the Structure
and Workmanship of the Images; for whereas in
our Country they may, for the most part, be reckon'd
so many Master-pieces of Art, whether we consi∣der
the Regularity of the Design, the Disposition
<PB N="294" REF="169"/>
of the Lights and Shades, or the Beauty of the
Colours. The <HI>Greeks</HI> are of Opinion, and scruple
not to say, that the Pictures of the Saints, as
they are represented in the <HI>Roman</HI> Churches are
more proper to raise Criminal Desires, than to
inspire the Minds of the Spectators with Devoti∣on.
And therefore to avoid the dangerous Con∣sequences
of that Abuse, they confine themselves
to a certain Antick way of Painting, which is
extremely unnatural, especially in their Figures of
Virgins, who are almost all represented black, and
so muffled up in Kerchiefs and Gowns, that you
can scarce distinguish their Faces. And their
Painters are so ignorant, and so little acquainted
with the Beauties of the Art they profess, that
they cannot so much as copy a Head. Nor am
I at all surpriz'd at the Unskillfulness of these
pretended Artists; for their Method is directly op∣posite
to that of our Painters: First they lay on the
Shades, and design the entire Figure, after which
they proceed to the Disposition of the Light; which
is the most preposterous Method cou'd be imagin'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Armenians</HI> are not so scrupulous in this
Point, tho' they profess almost the same Articles
of Faith; for they make use of the modern way
of Painting; and there is at present on their
High Altar an Image of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> made by a
<HI>French-man,</HI> which shews so much of her Breasts
that I shou'd be almost Jealous if my Mistress
were painted after that Manner. Nevertheless you
must not suspect them of <HI>Libertinism;</HI> for I never heard
of any Religious Order, except the Monks of <HI>Trape,</HI>
that observe such mortifying <HI>Fasts.</HI> They keep
four <HI>Lents,</HI> which lasts one half of the Year, like
those that are observ'd by the <HI>Greeks:.</HI> But the <HI>Armen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI>
do not allow themselves so much Liberty as the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their Fellow <HI>Christians;</HI> for they abstain
from eating Flesh, Fish, and even Shell-Fish, Butter,
<PB N="295" REF="169"/>
Milk, Cheese, and every thing that has or ever
had Life; which may be justly reckon'd a very severe
piece of Mortification. Their Bishop has put him∣self
under the Protection of <HI>France,</HI> to deliver
himself from the insupportable Exactions of the
<HI>Turks;</HI> and 'tis but a very little while ago since
he was freed from Prison, where he had lain six
Months. He is a very honest and civil Person,
and diligent in performing the Duties of his Fun∣ction.
His Habit is almost the same with that of
the <HI>Greek</HI> Bishop, only he wears a Hood or Cawle
at the Neck of his Gown, and carries in his Hand
a Cross, like that which is us'd by the <HI>Roman</HI> Bi∣shops,
only 'tis made of Wood. This puts me in
Mind of what a certain Author said concerning
the Ancients, That they were <HI>Golden Bishops</HI> tho'
they wore <HI>Wooden Crosses;</HI> and I may safely ven∣ture
to apply that Saying to this Prelate.</P>
<P>To return to the <HI>Greeks;</HI> I had almost forgot
to take Notice of one of their Opinions in which
they differ from those of the <HI>Romish</HI> Persuasion.
You have doubtless observ'd that the <HI>Romanists</HI> have
an extreme Veneration for those Persons whose
Bodies remain free from <HI>Putrefaction</HI> after their
Death; and that the Incorruption of the Body is
reckon'd a convincing Mark of the Holiness of
the Deceas'd, and is one of the most considerable
Proofs that can be offer'd for the <HI>Canonization</HI> of
the Saint; whereas the <HI>Greeks</HI> pretend that 'tis
only an Effect of <HI>Excommunication;</HI> and when they
find a Body in that Condition, they never leave
praying for the Soul of the dead Person, till his
Body be putrefy'd and corrupted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Interrment</HI> of dead Bodies is perform'd with
almost the same Ceremonies that are observ'd in
the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> All the Clergy meet toge∣ther,
and sing the <HI>de profundis,</HI> and Prayers for the
Soul of the Deceas'd. Several Persons march be∣fore
<PB N="296" REF="170"/>
with lighted Candles, after whom the Body is
carry'd in an open Coffin, drest in its finest Clothes,
with a little Cotton in its Mouth; so that often∣times
the Person seems to be alive. Then comes
the Husband or Wife, accompany'd with the
Children and Slaves of the Deceas'd, all bellowing
out their Grief in so dismal and terrible a Man∣ner,
that one wou'd conclude they thought them∣selves
irrecoverably ruin'd. The Women especial∣ly
signalize their Love by all the wildest Marks
of Despair, tossing their Bodies so furiously from
side to side, that they wou'd certainly break
their Necks if they were not supported by two
Persons who are appointed to attend 'em. Their
usual Song is <HI>Hai agamimont, hai mathiamont; Ab
my Eyes! ah my Love!</HI> And the Slaves echo back
the howling Musick with so hideous a Noise, that
one wou'd think they design'd to scare the De∣vil.
Those who have not a sufficient Number of
Slaves to make a Noise sutable to the Quality of
the Deceas'd, may supply that Defect by hiring
<HI>Weeping-Women,</HI> who for an <HI>Jsallote,</HI> which is worth
about forty Pence, howl and cry, as if they were
acted by the most furious Transports of Rage and
Despair. 'Tis true, the Frace is too gross and vi∣sible;
for there is something so moving in true Sor∣row
that it can never be counterfeited; neither
is it possible for the most dextrous Mimick to
imitate the tender Motions of Nature. And even
when those pretended Mourners seem to be tran∣sported
with Fury and Despair, running about
like Mad-Women, with dishevell'd Hair, the Ar∣tifice
is easily discernible. And particularly I ob∣serv'd,
that when they pretend to tear their Hair,
they hold it fast with one Hand near the Roots,
and then pull as hard as they can with the o∣ther.
To co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clude, an unconcern'd Spectator
wou'd be tempted to imagine that all this Mumme∣ry
<PB N="297" REF="170"/>
is acted in derision to the deceas'd; for as soon as
he is interr'd, they make a Feast on his Grave at his
own Charge; and his Wife and Children take care
that nothing be wanting to the Company, who eat
and drink and laugh, as if they were carousing in a
Tipling House. This is certainly a very extravagant
way of expressing their Affection to their dead
Friends; nor cou'd they treat a Man worse whose
Memory they design'd to affront. I have also
had occasion to see the Funeral Solemnities of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> which in my Opinion are less inconsistent
with the Rules of Decency; for tho' they use
those Affected Howlings as well as the <HI>Greeks,</HI> their
Design is to Mourn and not to Feast. Among the
Ceremonies that are us'd by the <HI>Iews</HI> at the Death
of their Relations, I took notice of one which
seems to be very Troublesome and Inconvenient,
I mean their keeping of the Dead Body Three
Days unbury'd: And I leave you to judge what
a sad Companion that must be to the Widow and
Children, who are oblig'd to weep without Inter∣mission
till the Body be interr'd.</P>
<P>Since the Description of the <HI>Greekish</HI> Funerals
has given me an Occasion to mention the <HI>Jews,</HI>
I shall conclude this Letter with a brief Account
of that Nation. 'Twou'd be needless to enter∣tain
you with an Abridgement of their Ancient
History, and therefore I shall only observe, that
after the <HI>Romans</HI> became Masters of <HI>Palestine,</HI> these
unhappy Fugitives were dispers'd, and scatter'd
thro' the whole World, and have liv'd ever since
like hated Vagabonds, without King or Head, ex∣pecting
the <HI>Messiah</HI> with an Impatience that has
frequently made 'em give Credit to Impostors.
About Thirty Years ago there arose a false Pro∣phet
or <HI>Messiah</HI> in this Country, call'd <HI>Sabatai Sevi,</HI>
who was very learned, and had diligently study'd
the <HI>Cabala,</HI> by which means, 'twas thought, he came
<PB N="298" REF="171"/>
to the Knowledge of certain Magical Secrets, which
he afterwards made Use of to abuse the Credulity
of his Followers. I have heard a Thousand Stories
of him, but shall content my self with telling you
that he manag'd the Cheat with so much De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣terity
and Success, that he was follow'd by a great
Multitude of People, and began to exercise so
great an Authority over the <HI>Jews,</HI> that the <HI>Grand
Signior</HI> himself, growing jealous of his Power and
Credit, order'd him to be apprehended, and
brought in Chains to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where this pre∣tended
<HI>Messiah</HI> turn'd <HI>Turk</HI> to save his Life. The
Scandal of this Example, which ought to have
taught the <HI>Jews</HI> more Caution for the future,
cou'd not keep 'em from falling not long after
into another Error of the same Nature. You must
know that during the <HI>Feast of Tabernacles,</HI> the
young Women of that Nation are oblig'd to lie
abroad under Tents in a place appointed for that
purpose; and they have an old Tradition that the
<HI>Messiah</HI> shall be conceiv'd in the Womb of a Vir∣gin
during that Festival. Now it happen'd that a
certain Maid, who it seems was weary of that
Denomination, resolv'd to make use of so favour∣able
an Opportunity of tasting the <HI>forbidden Delight,</HI>
and to conceal her Fault, spread abroad a Report
that God came to visit her every Night, and that
she was to be the Mother of the <HI>Messiah.</HI> These
acceptable News were receiv'd with Joy by the
whole Synagogue, who appointed several Days
of Solemn Thanksgiving to be kept with all ima∣ginable
Secresie, for fear of offending the <HI>Turks.</HI>
But their Joy was at last turn'd into Shame and
Confusion, when instead of their expected <HI>Deli∣verer,</HI>
the pretended Virgin was brought to B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
of a <HI>Daughter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="171"/>
The <HI>Levantine Jews</HI> are extremely Cunning and
Deceitful, and so dextrous in the Art of Wheed∣ling,
that those who deal with 'em ought to be
always upon their Guard. Cheating is the Trade
by which they live, as others do by Labour or
Traffick; and 'tis usually said here, that a <HI>Jew</HI>
never eats his Breakfast till he has cheated a <HI>Chri∣stian.</HI>
However, 'tis certain that he who trusts
'em must either betray his Ignorance or Impru∣dence;
for by a modest Computation, I may
venture to assure you, that among <HI>Twenty Jews</HI>
there are always <HI>Nineteen Knaves.</HI> There cannot
be a more convincing Argument to prove that <HI>Re∣ligion</HI>
is not always attended with <HI>Honesty;</HI> for if
it were, the <HI>Jews</HI> wou'd be the honestest Men in
the World. They observe the Precepts of their
Law with an incredible exactness; and wou'd not
do the least Work on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> to prevent the
Ruine of the Universe. 'Tis not yet a Fortnight
since we had an eminent Instance of the Power
of Superstition, on occasion of a Fire which broke
forth in the <HI>Jews</HI> Quarter in this City on the <HI>Sab∣bath</HI>
Day; for they suffer'd it to consume their
Houses without endeavouring to quench it; and
one among the rest seeing his Child just ready to
be devour'd by the Flames, contented himself
with tearing his Hair, instead of breaking the Win∣dow
of his House, tho' there was no other Way
to save the Life of his miserable Infant, which
wou'd have been certainly burnt alive, if it had
not been seasonably rescu'd by some <HI>Greeks,</HI> whose
Compassion drew 'em to its Assistance. This Fire
made a prodigious Havock, for it destroy'd above a
Hundred Houses, in the greatest part of which
there were Warehouses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> are no less jealous of their Wives than
the <HI>Turks,</HI> and are very careful in keeping 'em
under a close Confinement. 'Tis true, they are
<PB N="300" REF="172"/>
permitted to see and visit one another; but if a
Woman shou'd walk a Quarter of a League out
of the City without her Husband or Brother, she
wou'd infallibly be divorc'd.</P>
<P>They wear a large Gown of black Cloth, made
almost like that of the <HI>Papa's;</HI> and their Shooes
are of a Violet Colour. Their Caps are of Felt,
cover'd with Violet-colour'd Cloth, and resemble a
long Block of a Hat. Round their Caps they tye
a small strip'd or Violet-colour'd <HI>Turbant,</HI> which
they call a <HI>Tandour.</HI> They are oblig'd to pay the
<HI>Carache</HI> as well as the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and are treated with
more scorn and Contempt: But they are naturally
of so intrigueing a Temper, that they thrust them∣selves
into all sorts to Bus'ness, and are at pre∣sent
the only Managers of Trade; for there are
no other Brokers in the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>

<P>JUst now I'm inform'd that five <HI>Barbary</HI> Vessels
anchor'd this Morning at <HI>Fosche,</HI> which is a lit∣tle
Harbour at the Mouth of the Gulph. If this
be true, we must expect to see the Streets always
full of those insolent Scoundrels, from whom the
<HI>Franks</HI> receive a Visit once every Year, tho' they
wou'd gladly dispence with so troublesome a piece
of Civility. I have not yet had Experience of
their Deportment; but the Accounts I have re∣ceiv'd
from others have extremely abated my na∣tural
Curiosity to be acquainted with the Customs
of Strangers: And I had much rather hear a De∣scription
than be an Eye-Witness of the Disorders
they committed in this City, which are still so
fresh in the Memory of the People, that they
hardly talk of any thing else. I know not whe∣ther
you cou'd hear without Disturbance a Rela∣lation
of those Abuses, if you were in a place
where you might shortly expect to see 'em re∣peated:
But since you are at so great a Distance
from the Scene of the Tragedy, you may ven∣ture
to read it without fearing to be made a Spe∣ctator
of it: And besides, there can be nothing
more proper to give you a clear <HI>Idea</HI> of the Weak∣ness
of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Government.</P>
<P>About a Year ago the same <HI>Barbary</HI> Ships touch'd
at the Port where they have now cast Anchor, which
is only four or five Leagues distant from this place;
and since these Sea-Monsters are not restrain'd by
the least shadow of Discipline, one half of 'em
was perpetually in the City. These pretended
<PB N="302" REF="173"/>
Soldiers are a meer Rabble of Murderers, Rob∣bers,
and the most desperate Villains, who, to a∣void
the just Punishment of their Crimes, flock
from all parts of <HI>Africk</HI> to the Sea-Coast, where
they find on board the Ships, a Sanctuary that
secures 'em from being made accountable for their
past Offences, and are at the same time privileg'd
to re-act their former Barbarities without con∣troul;
so that they are equally dreaded by the
<HI>Turks, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Franks,</HI> tho' the Storm falls hea∣viest
upon the last, especially since the Bombard∣ing
of <HI>Algiers,</HI> which has inspir'd 'em with a hor∣rible
Aversion against the <HI>French,</HI> and against all o∣ther
<HI>Franks</HI> for their sake.</P>
<P>Two or three Days after their Landing, two of
'em drinking in a Tipling-House pick'd a Quarrel
with a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who seeing 'em advance towards
him with naked Poniards, discharg'd his Pistol
at 'em, and then made his Escape. Imme∣diately
the two <HI>Barbarianss</HI> one of whom had re∣ceiv'd
a slight Wound by the Shot, being reinforc'd
by some of their Fellows, ran thro' the Streets,
swearing like enrag'd Furies, and threatning to
murder all the <HI>French</HI> without exception. In the
Heat of their Rage they met three Mariners of
<HI>Provence</HI> coming out of a Barber's Shop, whom
they instantly assaulted, and dragg'd by the Hair
along the Street to the <HI>Bazar,</HI> where they butcher'd
'em with their Poniards in a most barbarous man∣ner.
The <HI>French Consul</HI> being alarm'd at the News,
commanded those of his Nation to keep within
Doors all that Day, and sent for Soldiers and
Arms from on board the Ships that were in the
Port, to secure him from the Insolency of the in∣cens'd
Rabble. Next Morning he order'd forty
Men, arm'd with Carabines and Pistols, to bring
off the Bodies of the three Seamen that had lain
all the while in the Street. As soon as the <HI>Bar∣baria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>
<PB N="303" REF="173"/>
heard of their Design, they resolv'd to op∣pose
the Execution of it; but since they had no
Fire-Arms, and are extremely afraid of Shot, they
fled after the first Discharge, and left the Bodies
to the <HI>French,</HI> who carry'd 'em off without any
Opposition. In the mean time the <HI>Consul</HI> had
sent a Message to the other two <HI>Consuls</HI> of <HI>En∣gland</HI>
and <HI>Holland,</HI> to beg their Assistance in the
Common Cause of the Three Nations: But these
Gentlemen did not think fit to irritate an enrag'd
Mobb that had not positively declar'd against a∣ny
other Nation but the <HI>French.</HI> And it appear'd
by the Event, that they acted wisely in so nice
a Juncture; for the Neutrality they observ'd, and
the Care they took not to kindle the Fury of the
<HI>Barbarians</HI> by appearing too much in the Streets,
had so good an Effect, that the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>
receiv'd not the least Injury during the Tumult,
except some affronting Words. The <HI>French Consul</HI>
being disappointed of the Assistance he expected
from the two Nations, and not knowing to what
Saint he shou'd make h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s next Address, resolv'd at
last to demand Protection from the <HI>Cadi.</HI> Imme∣diately
he sent two Merchants, and as many In∣terpreters
to complain to that Officer of the In∣juries
he had receiv'd from the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and to
assure him that if the Tumult were not quickly
appeas'd, he wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d seek Redress at the <HI>Port,</HI> and
in the mean time wou'd Arm those of his Nati∣on
in their own Defence. But instead of the Aid
he expected, he had the Mortification to re∣ceive
only a faint Excuse; for the most favourable
Answer his Messengers cou'd obtain from the <HI>Ca∣di</HI>
was, that he had not Forces sufficient to sup∣press
the seditious Multitude; and that the best
Advice he cou'd give his Master, was to defend
himself as well as he cou'd. The <HI>Consul</HI> percei∣ving
that this was in effect an absolute Denial,
<PB N="304" REF="174"/>
dispatch'd an Express to Monsieur <HI>de Chasteauneuf,</HI>
to acquaint him with the extreme Danger that
threaten'd the Nation, and to intreat him to use
his Int'rest at the <HI>Port</HI> for the procuring a <HI>Grand
Mandamus</HI> against the <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>Before I proceed farther, 'twill not be impro∣per
to inform you, that a <HI>Grand Mandamus</HI> is an
express Order from the <HI>Sultan,</HI> which he never
grants but in Cases of great Necessity, and of
the highest Importance. Those who refuse to sub∣mit
to it are declar'd Rebels against the <HI>Grand
Signior;</HI> and the Law ordains that such Per∣sons
shall be treated as Infidels: So that these
Orders may be call'd the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Thunders;
as Excommunications are said to be the Thunders
of the <HI>Vatican.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Consul</HI> waited with an extreme Impatience
for the Return of his Express, and during the
space of three Weeks which that Messenger spent
in his Journey, and in dispatching his Bus'ness,
the <HI>French</HI> were forc'd to suffer the Insolency of
the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> whose Fury was so far from being
appeas'd, that it wanted little of its first impetu∣osity;
for they continu'd still to beat and affront
all the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> that came in their Way. Nor
cou'd the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> escape their Rage, for
as many of 'em as were found with yellow <HI>Ba∣bouches,</HI>
long Breeches, or any sort of Habit or
Ornament prohibited by Law, were sure of the
<HI>Bastinado;</HI> these Villains pretending that they wou'd
restore Justice in the City, and reform the Abu∣ses
that had crept into the Government. One
Day they happen'd to meet an old <HI>Drogue-man</HI>
with a <HI>Chacsir,</HI> after the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fashion, and im∣mediately
ask'd him by what Authority he wore
that Habit: The poor Man reply'd, that he wore
it as Interpreter of <HI>France;</HI> but this Answer
instead of pacifying 'em, irritated 'em so extremely,
<PB N="305" REF="174"/>
that after a severe Beating they took away his
<HI>Chacsir,</HI> and sent him home with a bare Breech.
At last the <HI>Grand Mandamus</HI> came, forbidding the
<HI>Barbarians</HI> under pain of Rebellion to molest the
<HI>French;</HI> and ordaining the <HI>Cadi,</HI> and all the Inha∣bitants
of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to shut up their Shops, and be
ready to assist the <HI>French</HI> in case of any Tumult
or Disturbance. The <HI>Consul</HI> was extremely proud
of this Order, and after he had notify'd it to the
<HI>Cadi,</HI> thought himself as secure as if he had ob∣tain'd
a strong Reinforcement: But the <HI>Barbarians,</HI>
who had receiv'd Advice of it from the <HI>Cadi,</HI> in∣stead
of submitting to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Command, be∣gan
to Rage with more Violence than before.
The first who felt the Fury of this new Storm,
were a Chirurgeon and another <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who
receiv'd three Wounds with a Poniard. After∣wards
they besieg'd the <HI>Consul</HI>'s House, and wou'd
have set Fire to it, if they had not been prevent∣ed
by fifteen or twenty <HI>Janisaries,</HI> whom he had
call'd to his Assistance. The <HI>Cadi</HI> seem'd to be an
unconcern'd Spectator of all these Disorders; for
when the <HI>Consul</HI> sent to require his Assistance, ac∣cording
to the Order he had receiv'd from the <HI>Port,</HI>
he answer'd him in plain Terms, that he neither
wou'd nor durst incense the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and that
he was resolv'd to expect the Event without in∣terposing
in other Mens Affairs. In the mean time
the Inhabitants of the City shut up their Shops,
according to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Order; but they
were so far from assisting the <HI>French,</HI> that they had
not the Courage to appear in the Streets: And if
by good Fortune the <HI>Captain Bassa</HI> had not arriv'd
with seven Galleys, 'tis hard to divine what might
have been the issue of these Disturbances. You
may easily conclude, that our Country-men, after
such late and fatal Experience of the Barbarity of
those Infidels, are extremely alarm'd at the News
<PB N="306" REF="175"/>
of their Arrival: And their Fears are encreas'd
by the Advice they have receiv'd from <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI>
that there were two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> murder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by
'em there in their own Houses. 'Tis true, the
two <HI>Protestant</HI> Nations have hitherto suffer'd no∣thing
but Words; but who can secure 'em from
the Danger of being made Sharers in the com∣mon
Calamity, if another Tumult shou'd happen.
'Tis impossible to reflect without Horror on their
manner of attacking a <HI>Christian</HI> that has the Mis∣fortune
to come in their way. As soon as they
perceive him at a Distance, they draw their Poni∣ards,
and with a Howling and Wolvish Noise, run
bellowing out these Words, <HI>alla, alla, alla,</HI> in the
same Tone they use when they board a Ship. In
such Cases 'tis in vain to think of Resistance; and
as soon as a Man sees 'em coming, he must place
his only Confidence in the Swiftness of his Legs;
For if a <HI>Turk</HI> shou'd offer to stop 'em, they wou'd
infallibly turn their Poniards against him.</P>
<P>These are the fatal and inevitable Consequences
of the Weakness of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Government: And
the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> must be a tame Spectator of the
Insolency of three or four Hundred Scoundrels,
(for there were no more of 'em,) and patiently suf∣fer
'em to domineer over a great City, slight his
<HI>Grand Mandamus</HI>'s, and assassinate almost under his
Whiskers those whom he had taken into his Pro∣tection
in so particular a manner.</P>
<P>The present <HI>French Consul</HI> has been very unfortu∣nate
in the Discharge of his Office. He has been
twice affronted by the <HI>Barbarians;</HI> and besides, he
has a very small Share in the Ambassador's Friend∣ship,
and is yet less belov'd by the Nation, who
take all Occasions to mortifie him. T'other Day
there happen'd a Quarrel between him and the
<HI>Capuchins,</HI> who are Curates of the Parish, on the
Occasion of the Election of a Grand-Vicar. For
<PB N="307" REF="175"/>
the <HI>Consul</HI> was persuaded by the <HI>Jesuites</HI> to promote
one whom they recommended to him, and re∣solv'd
to make him Officiate on S. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Day,
and pronounce that Saint's Panegyrick. The <HI>Ca∣puchins</HI>
wou'd not own the new Vicar, and were
so incens'd against the <HI>Consul,</HI> that they threaten'd
to shut the Doors of their Church; but perceiving
that he was resolv'd to break 'em open, they were
unwilling to expose themselves to so publick an
Affront, and contented themselves with giving out
that they wou'd Excommunicate the <HI>Consul,</HI> who
laugh'd at their Anger, and told 'em in a deriding
manner, that since nothing less than Excommuni∣cation
wou'd satisfie 'em, he wou'd let 'em know
that he cou'd Excommunicate as well as they,
and that they shou'd find his Sentences more ef∣fectual
than theirs were wont to be. This <HI>Con∣sul</HI>
is absolutely govern'd by the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> and so
intirely devoted to 'em, that he can't live with∣out
'em. Among the Marks of his Affection to
that Order, I may reckon the late splendid Enter∣tainment
which he gave to Father <HI>Grimaldy,</HI> who
pass'd by this Place in his Return from <HI>China,</HI>
from whence he was sent with the Character of
an <HI>Envoy</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> King. This <HI>Jesuit</HI> has a
strange Ambition to appear Great, and talks per∣petually
of the Honours he receives from the King
of <HI>China,</HI> and of the Favours that Monarch be∣stows
on some other Fathers of the Society, whom
he has made <HI>Mandarin's</HI> of the first Order. It must
be acknowledg'd, that the <HI>Jesuits</HI> are perfect Ma∣sters
of the Art of Intriguing; they have always
made it their Bus'ness to insinuate themselves into
the Affection of Princes, and have manag'd their
Ambitious Designs with so much Dexterity and
Success, that we have already seen some Fathers
of that Order dignify'd with the Title of Embas∣sadors
by the Courts of <HI>Siam, China, Poland, Tar∣tary,
<PB N="308" REF="176"/>
&amp;c.</HI> You see, Sir, how suitable their Actions
are to the pretended Humility of their Profession:
And I leave you to judge with what Confidence
they can boast of their renouncing Ecclesiastical
Dignities, while they court Secular Preferments
with so much Eagerness.</P>
<P>In the Account I gave you of the Temper and
Disposition of the <HI>Turks,</HI> I forgot to take notice
of their surprizing Neglect of the Public Int'rest,
in which Respect they run exactly Counter to the
Maxims that are observ'd in all well-govern'd States.
If we consider this incurable Flaw in their Go∣vernment,
we may venture to conclude that Po∣sterity
will not find many Objects of Admiration
in the future Monuments of their Power and Glo∣ry.
If the <HI>Aegyptians, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> had not
been inspir'd with a nobler Ardour, we shou'd
not now see so many Curious and Inquisitive Persons
undertake such long and troublesome Voyages to
visit the Ruines of their ancient Grandeur, or to
discover the Medals that give some light to the Hi∣story
of the Great Men for whom they were coin'd.
The <HI>Turks</HI> are so extremely careless of the Ma∣nagement
of Publick Affairs, that their Streets are
not so much as pav'd; and I'm apt to think there
wou'd not be a Fountain in their Cities, nor a
Bridge on their Rivers, if some dying Persons did
not bequeath Legacies to be employ'd in erecting
such useful Works. The ill Posture of Affairs in
this Country is a natural Consequence of the
Constitution of the Government; for what Or∣der
can be expected in a place where there are
no incorporated Societies, Town-Houses, Sheriffs,
or Burgo-masters. They have no Publick Buil∣dings
or Walks, and their Cities are extremely
ill-built. There are no fixt Posts nor Couriers;
so that when a Man has occasion to write to any
remote place, except <HI>Constantinople, Aleppo,</HI> or <HI>Cairo,</HI>
<PB REF="176"/>

<FIGURE>
<P>An Arabian Impostor at his Conjurations P. 309</P>

he must sometimes wait a whole Year for an Oc∣casion;
and even between <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Constantino∣ple</HI>
there are only <HI>Arabs</HI> who go a-foot, and fre∣quently
stay a Month before they set out. I
leave you to judge how stale the News must
come to several places, and what an universal Ig∣norance
must reign throughout the Empire. There
are some <HI>Turks</HI> who know not so much as the
Name of the reigning <HI>Sultan;</HI> and even in the
places that are most frequented, by reason of their
Conveniency for Traffick, such as <HI>Smyrna,</HI> the In∣habitan's
are scarce acquainted with the most im∣portant
Transactions in the World. For they ne∣ver
publish any Books, Journals, Gazettes, or the
least Account of Publick Affairs; nor do I be∣lieve
that there is in all <HI>Turkey</HI> a Man capable of
such an Undertaking. The Time they allow for
the Improvement of their Knowledge is intirely
spent in studying the Art of Magical Divination
and Fortune-telling, which they have borrow'd
from the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and have so high an Opinion of,
that they esteem it a necessary Qualification in
one that pretends to Learning. There is a very
famous Soothsayer in this place, call'd <HI>Solyman A∣ga,</HI>
of whom I heard so many Wonders, that I
went on purpose to see whether there was any
Solidity in so suspected a Science. When I came
to the Place of his Abode, I found a Man whose
Mien and Aspect was exactly suitable to the <HI>Idea</HI>
we usually have of a <HI>Magician;</HI> for he was black and
lean, his Looks was gloomy and dismal, and his
Beard almost cover'd his Breast; and besides, he
had about twenty <HI>Arabick</HI> Books full of Figures. As
soon as I enter'd, I told him, by a Friend that
perform'd the Office of an Interpreter betwixt us,
that the Fame of his great Learning had drawn
me to see him; and begg'd him to acquaint me
with some part of my future Destiny. He re∣ply'd
<PB N="310" REF="178"/>
that I was a <HI>Christian,</HI> that my Friend was
also a <HI>Christian,</HI> and that consequently we were
Brothers. I was not at all pleas'd with so imper∣tinent
an Answer; but since I knew that the <HI>Turks</HI>
are extremely fond of Sentences, I look'd upon
his Bluntness to be an Effect of his Humour, and
desir'd my Friend to ask him whether he cou'd
give me a particular Information concerning my
Fortune. <HI>Yes,</HI> said he, <HI>and more than that; if
you please I will make you Discourse with the black
Angel, who will teach you to speak all sorts of Lan∣guages.</HI>
Since my only design was to discover
the utmost Reach of his Skill, I took him at his
Word, and earnestly pray'd him to shew me the
Angel, which he promis'd to do the next Morn∣ing
at the Hour of <HI>Quindi.</HI> When I return'd at
the appointed Time, I found him extremely
puzzl'd to find out some way to save his Credit,
and that he was resolv'd either to flinch from his
Promise, or to fright me from demanding the
performance of it: For at first he ask'd me a Hun∣dred
Crowns, concluding that I wou'd not pur∣chase
the Satisfaction of my Curiosity at so dear
a Rate: However, I resolv'd to touch him in the
most sensible Part, knowing that he wou'd be ex∣tremely
concern'd for the Loss of his Reputati∣on.
I told him then that I perceiv'd his Learn∣ing
was not so profound as he pretended, and
that if he were not sensible of his own Igno∣rance,
he wou'd not demand so extravagant a
Summ for so small a Matter. These Words, as I
expected, had some Influence upon him; for he
told me, but to convince me of the Injury I
did him by suspecting the Truth of his Pretensi∣ons,
he wou'd show me the Angel, and wou'd
make me speak to him for fifty Crowns. But he
was extremely surpriz'd, when instead of endea∣vouring
to beat down the Price, as he concluded
<PB N="311" REF="178"/>
I wou'd, I immediately agreed to the Bargain:
However, he conceal'd the Perplexity of his
Thoughts as well as he cou'd, and endeavour'd
to find out some other Starting-Hole. He assur'd
me that he wou'd gladly give me the Satisfaction
I desir'd, but the Ceremony cou'd not be perform'd
till one a-Clock in the Morning: He advis'd me
therefore not to place too much Confidence in
my Courage, which cou'd not preserve me from
being seiz'd with an Astonishment and Terror
that might be attended with very dangerous Con∣sequences.
He added a hundred other Reasons to
deter me from adventuring on so hazardous a piece
of Curiosity; but at last, perceiving that I conti∣nu'd
fix'd in my Resolution, he promis'd to satis∣fie
me that Night, and began to talk of Perfumes,
Characters, and Evocations, which were so far
from Daunting either me or my Friend, that we
return'd thither in the Evening, well arm'd, and
resolv'd to Fire briskly at the Devil if he shou'd
have the Confidence to attack us. If you shou'd
ask me what made me so desirous to be acquaint∣ed
with Monsieur <HI>le Diable,</HI> and what Bus'ness I had
to do with him, I shou'd be exremely puzzl'd to
give you a satisfactory Answer: But to deal plain∣ly
with you, I did not believe that 'twas in the
Conjurer's Power to bring us to a Sight of him,
and 'twas that perhaps that made me so resolute
and couragious. At last Midnight being come, he
began to prepare his Perfumes, and to bring his
Books and Instruments, which I concluded he did
only to amuse us; and after all these Ceremo∣nies,
he told us that by reason of the Obscurity
of the Moon he cou'd not shew us the Angel, but
he wou'd make him speak to us in <HI>Arabick, Tur∣kish,</HI>
or <HI>Italian,</HI> which we pleas'd. This unexpe∣cted
Shuffling convinc'd me that he was an Im∣postor,
and I was so enrag'd at the Disappoint∣ment,
<PB N="312" REF="179"/>
that I left him without daining to re∣turn
an Answer, and immediately went to my
Lodgings.</P>
<P>By this Instance you may judge of the boast∣ed
Skill of all those feign'd <HI>Arabian</HI> Magicians;
for this Man was reputed one of the most learn'd
Professors of that Art in <HI>Asia:</HI> And yet 'tis as
certain as you may think it incredible, that some
<HI>Franks</HI> are so besotted with those mystical Foole∣ries,
that they are not asham'd to imploy all their
Time in so useless an Occupation. I know a ve∣ry
expert and much-esteem'd Painter, call'd <HI>Le
Brun,</HI> who neglecting his Bus'ness, applies himself
wholly to the Study of <HI>Divination,</HI> and spends
whole Days in turning over his Magical Books,
which he procures to be translated into <HI>French</HI> at a
very considerable Charge. But notwithstanding all
the Confidence of this pretended Diviner, 'tis im∣possible
that his Art can be true, since the very
Principles on which it depends, are certainly false;
and to convince you of the Absurdity of his Pre∣tensions,
'twill be sufficient to acquaint you with his
usual Method of Divining. He has two little Bones
with Eight Sides a-piece, on each of which there is
a small Character engrav'd; and when you pro∣pose
your Question, he throws the Bones, and ob∣serves
the Characters that appear on the sides that
happen to be uppermost. Then having made se∣veral
Combinations of these Characters, with cer∣tain
Numbers, according to the Subject of the
Question, he draws a Scheme or Figure, which he
seeks in one of his Books, where he finds a Sen∣tence
written, which he fancies to be the desir'd
Solution. Thus you see 'tis plain that the whole
Mystery depends on the Fortune of the Dice: But
when I endeavour'd to convince him of the Un∣certainty
of his Art which betray'd him into so
many Errors, that not One Answer in Thirty was
<PB N="313" REF="179"/>
found to be exactly true, he reply'd very grave∣ly,
that these Mistakes were occasion'd by his
Ignorance, and that he did not yet comprehend
the Depths of that infallible Science; adding, as a
Confirmation of the Certainty of the Art, that
notwithstanding the small Progress he had made in
it, he never found that his Book had return'd a
Cross or Impertinent Answer. And to convince
me of the Truth of his Assertion, he made seve∣ral
Tryals in my Presence, and I observ'd always
that the Answer, whether True or False, related to
the Subject of the Question; nor will I scruple to
confess that I was somewhat surpriz'd at so odd an
Effect of Chance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> are also very much addicted to the stu∣dy
of the <HI>Philosopher's Stone,</HI> or the Art of making
Gold and Silver; and I remember a story on this
Subject, which I had from a <HI>Turk,</HI> who is reckon'd
a Man of Honour. Two <HI>Persian Dervises</HI> came to
<HI>Constantinople</HI> about four Years ago, and after they
had staid a Fortnight, told their Landlord, that
tho' they had no Money to pay for their Lodg∣ing
and Entertainment, they were resolv'd not to
go away without giving him entire Satisfaction.
I know not what Credit he gave to their Pro∣mises,
but he quickly perceiv'd the Effect of 'em,
for they took a large Copper-Dish, which they
found in the House, and having melted it down
in his Presence, threw a little Powder upon it,
which immediately chang'd the Copper into Sil∣ver.
They retain'd one half for themselves, and
left the other with their Landlord, who upon try∣al
found it to be true Silver: And besides, they
presented him with a small Quantity of the
Powder. The <HI>Grand Visier Ismael,</HI> hearing of this
Accident, sent for the Man, and oblig'd him to
deliver up the Powder, which he show'd to se∣veral
expert <HI>Chymists,</HI> who according to his Orders,
<PB N="314" REF="180"/>
endeavour'd to find out the Secret. But all their
Attempts were unsuccessful; and I'm the rather in∣clin'd
to believe the Conclusion of the Story, be∣cause
I look upon this Art to be no less frivolous
and uncertain than that of <HI>Divination.</HI></P>

<P>IN compliance with your Desire I shall in this
Letter, present you with a short View of the
Life of <HI>Soliman,</HI> Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who died
<HI>June</HI> 22. and was succeeded by his younger Bro∣ther,
<HI>Achmet.</HI></P>
<P>The present <HI>Grand Signior, Achmet,</HI> the deceas'd
<HI>Soliman,</HI> and the depos'd <HI>Sultan Mahomet,</HI> were three
Brothers, the Sons of <HI>Sultan Ibrahim,</HI> who was
strangl'd in the Castle of the <HI>Seven Towers,</HI> in the
heat of one of those mutinous Tumults of the <HI>Ja∣nizaries,</HI>
that happen so frequently in this Country.
His eldest Son <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who was then very young, was
declar'd Emperour by the Interest and Solicitation
of the <HI>Sultana</HI> Mother, and of the famous <HI>Visie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
Kopergli,</HI> who ow'd his Advancement to her, and
ever afterwards serv'd her with an inviolable Fide∣lity.
This Prince's Reign may be justly reckon'd
disastrous; for not to mention those frequent and
terrible Seditions that made him tremble so often,
and in one of which he was at last dethron'd, his
<PB N="315" REF="180"/>
Armies were several times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outed by the <HI>Venetians,</HI>
and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> before his Death, had al∣most
driven him quite out of <HI>Hungary.</HI> The
<HI>Turks,</HI> who are the most ungovernable Subjects in
the World to an unfortunate Prince, and who are
possess'd with a Belief of a certain Predestination,
that over-rules the Fate of their Emperour on which
they imagine the Fortune of the Empire depends,
concluded that the Reign of <HI>Mahomet</HI> would be a
perpetual Scene of Disasters: and the Grandees en∣courag'd
the Superstition of the People, in Expectation
of a favourable Opportunity to execute the Designs
they had premeditated against the Government.
They cou'd not have desir'd a more inviting Juncture
to attempt and carry on so vast an Undertaking, than
the Disturbances that were occasion'd by the ill Suc∣cess
of the Campaign of 1687. and especially by
the Loss of the Famous Battle of <HI>Hersan;</HI> where
the <HI>Imperialists</HI> kill'd Ten thousand <HI>Turks</HI> on the Spot,
pillag'd their Camp, made themselves Masters of
Ninety Pieces of Cannon, and their whole Train
of Artillery. The Consternation that was occasi∣on'd
among the <HI>Turks</HI> by the News of this Defeat,
was encreas'd by the Advice they receiv'd almost at
the same time that the Bridge of <HI>Esseck</HI> was seiz'd
by the Count <HI>de Dunevalt,</HI> immediately after the
Victory. The <HI>Grand Visier,</HI> who commanded the
Army in Person, dreading the usual Fate of his
Predecessors on such Occasions, endeavour'd to se∣cure
himself by laying the Blame on the Generals
that commanded under him; and resolving to pre∣vent
the Designs of his Enemies, perswaded the
<HI>Grand Signior</HI> to put 'em to Death. But tho' the
Orders for that Effect were actually given out,
there was so strong a Party already form'd both
against the <HI>Visier</HI> and the <HI>Sultan,</HI> that the Great Of∣ficers
of the Army, with the <HI>Chiaoux Bassa</HI> at their
Head, made the whole Army revolt, and march'd
<PB N="316" REF="181"/>
towards <HI>Constantinople,</HI> with a Resolution to depose
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> and place his Brother <HI>Soliman</HI> on the
Throne. The News of their Approach so terrifi'd
the <HI>Sultan,</HI> that knowing no orher Way to appease
the Fury of the Rebels, he abandon'd the <HI>Grand vi∣sier,</HI>
and sent the Imperial Signet to the <HI>Chiaoux Bas∣sa,</HI>
whom he thought to gain by satisfying his Am∣bition.
But he quickly found that the Danger was
greater than he imagin'd; for that Officer declar'd
that he would not accept the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Offer till the
<HI>Grand Visier, Tefterdar,</HI> Receiver of the Customs, the
<HI>Caimacan,</HI> and some others whom he nam'd, were
put to Death. The Persons whose Heads he de∣manded
were the only faithful Servants of the
<HI>Grand Signior,</HI> who was extremely perplex'd at so
unwelcome a Proposal; knowing that his <HI>Visier</HI>'s
Death wou'd infallibly put a Period to his own
Life, or at least to his Reign. However the Ne∣cessity
of his Affairs constrain'd him at last to sign
the fatal Order: the unfortunate <HI>Visier</HI> was
strangl'd, and his Head sent to the <HI>Chiaoux Bassa,</HI>
who was so far from being appeas'd, that his Inso∣lence
was heighten'd by this Mark of the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s
Condescension. He dismiss'd the Messengers with
Scorn, telling 'em in a domineering Manner, That
they cou'd not justly expect he wou'd be satisfied
with one Head instead of Twenty which he had
demanded; and that this way of proceeding con∣vinc'd
him that the Government was not much con∣cern'd
for the Quiet of the Empire. Thus the <HI>Sul∣tan</HI>
was constrain'd to send all the rest of the Offi∣cers
whom those insolent Rebels requir'd; and
soon after perceiv'd there was no Hope of reducing
'em to a Sence of their Duty: for all the Prisoners
were barbarously murder'd in the Middle of the Ar∣my
by the <HI>Chiaoux Bassa</HI>'s Order. This last Act of In∣humanity
struck such a Terrour into the <HI>Grand Sig∣nior</HI>'s
Mind, that concluding himself to be irreco∣verably
<PB N="317" REF="181"/>
lost, he resolv'd in the Fury of his Despair
to put to Death all his Brothers and Sons. To
comprehend the Reason of this dismal Resolution,
you must know that the Religion of the <HI>Turks</HI> in∣spires
'em with a certain Veneration for the <HI>Otto∣man</HI>
Blood, that over-awes 'em ev'n in the the
midst of the most terrible Seditions, and is so deep∣ly
rooted in their Minds, that they wou'd rather
chuse to suffer the most cruel Death than to see
the Throne possess'd by a Prince of another Fami∣ly.
And therefore 'tis the usual Custom of those
Emperours to begin their Reign with the Death of
their Brothers, that the Throne may be secur'd from
the Attempts of so many dangerous Pretenders.
Thus <HI>Sultan Amurath,</HI> the Uncle of these three Em∣perours,
put to Death all the Males of the Family;
and if the Tenderness of a Mother had not prom∣pted
the <HI>Sultana Validé</HI> to hide <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> who was the
Youngest, the whole Race had been extingush'd. For
the <HI>Sultans</HI> are more concern'd for their own Secu∣rity
than for the Preservation of the Royal Line.
Nevertheless <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> wou'd never hearken
to the Perswasions of some of his Counsellours,
who advis'd him to put that cruel Maxim in Exe∣cution,
and endeavour'd to make him sensible that
the Quiet of the Empire could never be secur'd but by
the Death of <HI>Soliman</HI> and <HI>Achmet.</HI> But since he wou'd
not put 'em to death while they were in his Power,
he found, at last, that he cou'd not execute that
bloody Resolution when his Despair constrain'd
him to attempt it: for the <HI>Bostangi Bassa,</HI> who was
one of the Conspirators, carry'd the two Princes to
the old <HI>Seraglio</HI> under a strong Guard, who mock'd
the <HI>Sultan</HI> when he demanded to be admitted with
some of his Servants; and the Army was already
posted in and about <HI>Constantinople.</HI> That Night a
Council of the Great Officers was held in <HI>Santa-Sophia,</HI>
where they came to a final Resolution to
<PB N="318" REF="182"/>
place <HI>Soliman</HI> on the Throne, and he was declar'd
Emperour the next Day with universal Accla∣mations
of Joy. Thus <HI>Mahomet</HI> was depos'd, and
<HI>Soliman,</HI> who was no less averse to Cruelty than his
Brother, contented himself with ordaining that he
shou'd receive the same Treatment which he had
made him suffer for so many Years. When the
<HI>Capigi Bassa</HI> came to secure his Person, and to ac∣quaint
him with the New Emperour's Order, he
found him on the <HI>Sopha</HI> drinking Coffee, with a
Serenity of Mind that may be almost reckon'd a
Prodigy, considering the deplorable Circumstances
of his Condition. He submitted without making
the least Resistance, saying, <HI>That it was impossible
to oppose the Decrees of Heav'n, and that whatsoever is
predestinated must necessarily happen.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> who was one
of <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI>'s Favorites, had the good For∣tune
or Interest, to secure himself from being en∣roll'd
among the rest of those miserable Victims
that were sacrific'd to the Fury of the <HI>Chiaoux Bassa.</HI>
But assoon as he perceiv'd that his Master was irreco∣verably
ruin'd, he resolv'd to prevent the implacable
Malice of his Enemies by a speedy flight: and consi∣dering
that <HI>Christendom</HI> was the only Place where
he could expect to secure his Life, he embark'd
that Night on a Saique accompany'd only with
one Servant; and having made a sufficient Provisi∣on
of Gold, Silver, and Jewels, attempted to get
into a <HI>French</HI> Vessel of <HI>Ciotad,</HI> commanded by one
Captain <HI>Crevilliers:</HI> but the Mariners who had been
already alarm'd with the News of those terrible Di∣sturbanees,
wou'd not suffer him to approach the
Ship till he had declar'd his Name, and acquainted
'em, that the <HI>Caimacan</HI> of <HI>Constantinople</HI> desir'd to
speak with the Captain. Assoon as the Captain ap∣pear'd,
the <HI>Caimacan</HI> intreated him to receive him
on Board his Ship, and transport him to <HI>France;</HI>
<PB N="319" REF="182"/>
assuring him that he might set sail the next night with∣out
any Opposition, and offering Twenty thousand
<HI>Sequins,</HI> or Fifty thousand Crowns for his Passage.
This was a very tempting Offer to the Captain,
and he has since told me, that he wou'd have most
willingly accepted it, if the <HI>Caimacan</HI> had had the
the Prudence to conceal his Name; but since both
that and his Quality was known by the whole
Ship's Company, neither Compassion nor Covetous∣ness
cou'd prevail with the Captain to run so great
a Hazard; so that the poor <HI>Caimacan</HI> was forc'd to
steer his Course towards the Canal of the Black Sea,
thinking to make his Escape that way. But he was
quickly discover'd by the great Quantity of Silver
which he had about him, and was brought back
to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where he was beheaded. A Hun∣dred
other <HI>Bassa's</HI> underwent the same Fate; and
the <HI>Grand Visier</HI> giving a full Career to his Spite
and Revenge, fill'd the whole City with Blood
and Slaughter. There was nothing to be seen in
the Streets but <HI>Janizaries</HI> and <HI>Spahi's,</HI> assaulting and
murdering those whom they met; and no Man
when he rose in the Morning was sure of going to
Bed at Night. The <HI>Franks</HI> were extremely afraid,
lest the Storm should fall on them: the Ambassa∣dours
secur'd their Houses with strong Guards, and
all the Vessels in the Port, <HI>English, French, Dutch</HI>
and <HI>Venetian,</HI> join'd together, and put out to Sea,
with a Resolution to defend themselves to the last
Extremity, in case they shou'd be attack'd. To
conclude; I have heard some <HI>Turks,</HI> who are both
very old, and well skill'd in the History of their
Country, affirm, That the Quiet of the Empire
was never disturb'd by a more Bloody Sedition.
However 'twas at last appeas'd, tho' the Calm
lasted not long; for in <HI>March</HI> there broke forth
another terrible Insurrection against the New <HI>Sultan,</HI>
whom all Men began to look upon as incapable of
<PB N="320" REF="183"/>
the Government. Nor were they much mistaken
in their Opinion of him, and 'tis strange they did
not sooner foresee the dangerons Consequences
of so great a Revolution; for how cou'd a Man
learn the Art of Ruling so troublesome an Empire,
who had spent his whole Life in a close Prison,
where he cou'd only converse with Books, and was so
perfect a Stranger to the Management of Affairs,
that he was ignorant ev'n in the most common
Things. Thus the best Quality they could expect
or desire him to be indu'd with, was an Easiness of
Temper, and a Willingness to be absolutely go∣vern'd
by his Ministers; and indeed it may be said,
that there was never a more tractable Prince; for
during the whole Course of his Reign he never made
Use of his Absolute Power in any one Act, but
only in preserving his Brothers, whom he was
often advis'd to put to Death; especially on this
Occasion, when the Rebels threaten'd to restore
<HI>Mahomet</HI> to the Throne, and had almost effected
their Resolution: for the <HI>Visier</HI> was massacr'd in his
own House by the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who were the Au∣thors
of the Revolt, and had made themselves
Masters of the City. But the <HI>Sultan</HI> having very
seasonably display'd the Banner of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the
<HI>Saphi's,</HI> the <HI>Leventi,</HI> and the People run to his Assi∣stance,
and dispers'd the the <HI>Janizaries.</HI> After the
Tumult was calm'd, the <HI>Bassa</HI> of <HI>Natolia,</HI> who
headed the Rebels, was oblig'd to beg Pardon, and
above Five hundred of the Mutineers were hang'd;
tho' their Death made but a poor Amends for a
whole Quarter of the City, and above Twenty
Galleys and Sultana's which they had burnt.
'Twou'd be needless to give you a more particu∣lar
Relation of these Accidents, since you have doubt∣less
read an Account of 'em in your publick Jour∣nals
or News-Papers; and the only Reason why I
mention'd 'em, is because they give some Light to
<PB N="321" REF="183"/>
the Transactions that succeeded 'em, which perhaps
have not yet come to your knowledge. While the
whole City was in a terrible Combustion, and the <HI>Le∣venti</HI>
animated by a Desire of Plunder, were seeking
an Occasion of breaking forth into fresh Disorders,
there came a whole Troop of 'em to the <HI>French</HI> Am∣bassadour's
Palace, and in a very insolent Man∣ner
desir'd him to receive a certain beggarly <HI>Greek,</HI>
whom they brought along with 'em, to be his <HI>Drugger-Man,</HI>
or Interpreter. At first <HI>Monsieur de Girardin</HI>
rejected the Proposal, telling 'em that he did not
want a <HI>Drugger-Man,</HI> and would not take one upon
their Recommendation; but seeing they began to
be unruly, and threaten to set Fire to his House,
he grew more complaisant, and receiv'd the <HI>Drug∣ger-Man</HI>
more civilly. Nor can he be blam'd for
suffering himself to be hector'd by the Rabble,
since 'tis certainly the wisest Course to submit on
such Occasions.</P>
<P>After the Sedition was quieted, <HI>Soliman</HI> retir'd to
<HI>Adrianople;</HI> for he did not think himself safe in a
City that becomes the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Prison upon the
first breaking forth of an Insurrection; and after
that time he never resided in it. He conferr'd
the Dignity of <HI>Grand Visier</HI> on one <HI>Ismael Bassa,</HI>
a Man without Experience, and one who had no∣thing
to recommend him but the Favour of his
Master. No sooner was he intrusted with the
Administration of the Government, but the Em∣pire
was over-run with those Disorders and Con∣fusions
that are the natural Consequences of the
Unskilfulness of the Principal Minister of State.
Several <HI>Bassa's</HI> began to form Cabals, and enter
into separate Associations. Some espous'd the In∣terest
of the <HI>Sultaness,</HI> the Mother of the depos'd
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> who plotted to restore her Son; others
declar'd in Favour of one <HI>Jeghen Bassa,</HI> who pre∣tended
to be of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Race: some resolv'd
<PB N="322" REF="184"/>
to be independent, without acknowledging any
Head of their Party, and all in general resus'd to
submit to the present Government.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Emperour carry'd on the
War very prosperously; for the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>
took <HI>Belgrade</HI> by Storm, and the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI>
after he had defeated the Bassa of <HI>Bosnia,</HI> made
himself Master of the whole Province. The next
Year was remarkable for more Signal and Glorious
Advantages; for the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> who com∣manded
the Imperial Army in <HI>Hungary,</HI> fought
three Battles successively, and obtain'd as many
important Victories.</P>
<P>The first Battle was fought near <HI>Passarowitz,</HI>
where the <HI>Turks</HI> lost seven Thousand Men, a hun∣dred
Pieces of Cannon, all their Bombs, Carcasses,
Mortars, Powder, Tents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The second Victo∣ry
was obtain'd on the 24<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> near <HI>Nissa,</HI>
where the <HI>Serasquier</HI> who commanded in Person,
cou'd not prevent the Loss of all his Cannon, and
eight Thousand Soldiers. The third Battel was
fought near <HI>Widen;</HI> and during the Heat of the
Action, the <HI>Imperialists</HI> carry'd the Town by Storm.
Besides, the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> had taken <HI>Nissa, Zwor∣nick,
Nowigrath, Arsowath,</HI> and several other Pla∣ces,
which open'd a free Passage into <HI>Bulgaria</HI> and
<HI>Macedonia,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Romania;</HI> so that
if the War had been carry'd on for some time with
the same Vigour and Success, the <HI>Imperialists</HI> might
have advanc'd to the Gates of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> But
in the beginning of the last Year, the <HI>Visier Ismael</HI>
was depos'd, and succeeded by <HI>Kopergli Oglou, Bassa</HI>
of <HI>Scio.</HI> 'Twas then the <HI>Turks</HI> began to hope they
might see a happy Turn of Affairs; they remem∣ber'd
the great Actions of the famous <HI>Visier</HI> of that
Name, and were persuaded that this Minister wou'd
imitate so glorious a Example. Nor were they
disappointed in their Expectation; for the new
<PB N="323" REF="184"/>
<HI>Visier</HI> was not inferior to his Predecessor either in
Valour, Strength of Mind, or any other Endow∣ments
that are necessary to fit a Man for the Ma∣nagement
of Affairs; and the Empire was quick∣ly
sensible of the Advantageous Influences of his
Government. I have already acquainted you in a
former Letter, with the prosperous Success of their
Arms during the last Campagne, which gave Oc∣casion
to the <HI>French</HI> Embassador to take notice of
the Sympathy between the two Empires, and was
afterwards solemniz'd by that Triumph of which I
gave you a short Description. And therefore in∣stead
of troubling you with a tedious Relation of
those Events, which you have doubtless heard of,
and have not yet forgotten; I shall only tell you, that
if that Great Man had not been kill'd at the Battle
of <HI>Salankemen,</HI> the Christians wou'd have had Rea∣son
to dread a fatal Revolution, which they cou'd
hardly have prevented any otherwise, than by a
speedy Peace. And indeed that Design was carry'd
on so successfully, that every one expected a hap∣py
Conclusion of their Negotiations, when they
were unfortunately interrupted by the <HI>Visier</HI>'s Death.
For he was not at all averse to the Proposal, and
was so far from being acted by that base Love of
Riches, with which the <HI>Turks</HI> are generally pos∣sess'd,
that, contrary to the usual Maxims of his
Predecessors, he pursu'd no other Interest than
this of the State. He had often discours'd on that
Subject with <HI>Monsieur Collier,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassa∣dour,
whose Reasons made the greater Impression
upon him, because of the Character he had re∣ceiv'd
of his Merit, Capacity, and Dexterity in
publick Negotiations. And that able Minister had
prepossess'd the Mind of the <HI>Visier</HI> with such strong
Inclinations to a Peace, that, if we may be al∣low'd
to judge by the most promising Appearances,
he wou'd have actually concluded it, if he had not
<PB N="324" REF="185"/>
been prevented by Death. For <HI>Monsieur Collier</HI> had
made so good Use of such a favourable Opportu∣nity,
that almost all the Articles were agreed on,
and the Emperour had empower'd the Prince of
<HI>Baden</HI> to sign the Treaty; and had appointed the
Counts of <HI>Kinsky</HI> and <HI>Straatman</HI> to be his Assistants.
The King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> had
also sent their Plenipotentiaries: but instead of the
much-desir'd News of a Peace, we receiv'd an Ac∣count
of the dreadful Battle of <HI>Salankemen,</HI> in
which the <HI>Visier</HI> was one of the first that lost his
Life. The <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> the <HI>Serasquier,</HI>
and Ten other <HI>Bassa's</HI> of Note, had the same Fate;
and the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army fled with so much Precipi∣tation
and Terrour, that the Memory of the
Oldest Men cannot furnish 'em with an Instance
of so entire a Defeat. They lost above 20000
Men, all their Cannon and Baggage; and, in a
word, all they had in their Camp. I cannot ex∣press
the Consternation that was spread over the
whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, by the surprizing and
melancholy News which was brought into this
Country by some that had the good Fortune to
escape; who never speak of that Battle without a
certain Dread and Amazement in their Counte∣nance,
which gives us a more lively Idea of the
Horrour of that Day, than the most particular
Relation that cou'd be made of the Action.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur de Chateauneuf</HI> takes so deep a Share in
the Public Sorrow, that I know not whether he
cou'd support so terrible a Blow, if the <HI>Visier</HI>'s
Death did not comfort him a little. For that
Minister never had the Happiness of his Favour,
because he wou'd not be led by his Advice;
and I know a Man to whom the Ambassadour ex∣press'd
his Thoughts in these very Words, speak∣ing
of a Peace; <HI>'Twill, doubtless, be speedily conclu∣ded,</HI>
said he; <HI>The Dutch Ambassadour is perpetually
<PB N="325" REF="185"/>
with the Visier, and has got such a Power over him,
that he can undo in one Day all that I am able to do
in Ten.</HI> Nor were his Fears groundless, for I can
assure you that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is perhaps the fittest
Man in the World to manage such a Negotiati∣on.
In the first place, he knows the Original
of all the Great Men at the Port, and is per∣fectly
acquainted with their several Humours,
Intrigues, and Interests. Besides he is the Son of
an Ambassadour, and from his very Birth has
been enur'd to Business, which by that Means
is become so natural to him, that he manages
the most intricate Affairs with a certain happy
Easiness that can only be acquir'd by a Person
of so rare an Industry, and after a long Resi∣dence
at the Court. These are the Advantages
which <HI>Monsieur de Chateauneuf</HI> wants: 'tis true, he
has a great deal of Wit, and never sleeps away
an Opportunity of Acting; but after all, an Am∣bassadour
at his Arrival from <HI>France</HI> may be
reckon'd almost as great a Stranger at the Port,
as if he had dropt from the Clouds. The Geni∣us
and Humour of that Nation is directly opposite
to ours, and Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has studi'd it so carefully,
and understands it so perfectly, that he cou'd ea∣sily
give the <HI>Bassa's</HI> themselves a Lesson on this
Subject. So that if <HI>Monsieur de Chateauneuf</HI> did not
counter-ballance these Advantages with large Bags of
Gold and Silver, which are always wont to out∣weigh
Reason in <HI>Turkey,</HI> the Peace wou'd have been
long since concluded. This puts me in Mind of a
Story, which will give you an Idea of the usual
way of managing Affairs in this place.</P>
<P>The Captain of a <HI>Venetian</HI> Ship, who arriv'd
some Months ago at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> under the Pro∣tection
and Colours of <HI>Holland,</HI> was solicited by
the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadour to put himself under his
Protection, and was at last allur'd to yield to
<PB N="326" REF="186"/>
that Minister's Request by the Promises he
made him to obtain considerable Favours for
him, both as to the Entry and Exportation of
his Goods. Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> who upon all Occasions
maintains the Honour of his Masters with the
highest Zeal and Courage, wou'd not endure an
Affront that seem'd to be directly aim'd at the Re∣public.
Assoon as he heard of it, he sent Orders
to the Captain to take down the Banner of
<HI>France,</HI> if he was not resolv'd to suffer the ut∣most
Severity of his just Indignation: but that de∣luded
Officer slighted the Message, and so was
himself the Cause of all the Misfortunes that af∣terwards
befel him. For after his Excellency had
given Notice to the <HI>Grand Visier</HI> that there was
a Prize in the Port, Orders were immediately
sent to seize the Vessel, which was declar'd to
be lawful Prize; and the Captain with all the Sea∣men
were put in Chains. You may easily con∣clude
that the <HI>French</HI> were extremely mortifi'd to
see a hundred Wretches loaded with Fetters, and
sold for Slaves, meerly for setting up the Banner
of that Nation. <HI>Monsieur de Chateauneuf</HI> receiv'd a
very severe Reprimand from <HI>Monsieur de Pont∣chartrain,</HI>
and 'twas generally believ'd that his In∣discretion
on this Occasion wou'd make him be
recall'd from the Port. In the mean time he
was perpetually at the <HI>Grand Visier</HI>'s Gate, im∣portuning
him for the Relief of the Ship and
Mariners: but after all his earnest Solicitations,
he cou'd not obtain a more favourable Compositi∣on,
than that he was permitted to redeem the
Men at the Rate of Fifty Crowns a-piece; and
the Ransom of the Ship was fix'd at Ten thou∣sand
Crowns, which was more than its real Va∣lue.
Since that time the Credit of the <HI>French</HI>
Protection is extremely lessen'd; and I'm apt to
believe that few Captains will hereafter be guilty
<PB N="327" REF="186"/>
of the like Imprudence. And even I know several
<HI>Venetian</HI> Captains who will not put themselves under
the Protection of <HI>France,</HI> because the Ambassa∣dour
has impos'd a Tax of Fifteen thousand
Crowns upon the Vessels of that Nation by way
of Reprizal, for the Money he paid to the <HI>Grand
Visier.</HI> This Imposition occasions a great murmu∣ring
among the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who pretend that he
was oblig'd in Justice to redeem the Vessel at
his own Charge, since he was the only Cause
of its Misfortune.</P>
<P>I perceive that I have insensibly wander'd from
my Subject, and am ready to acknowledge that
this wou'd be an unpardonable Fault in an Ex∣act
and Methodical History: but since I only
promis'd you a clear and faithful Account of
the Observations I shou'd have Occasion to make
in my Travels, I do not think my self oblig'd
to make an Apology for every little Digres∣sion.</P>
<P>The Emperour <HI>Soliman</HI> died on the <HI>twenty se∣cond</HI>
of <HI>June</HI> last: some believe that his Death
was natural, but others say that it was occasi∣on'd
by the <HI>Sultaness</HI> the Mother of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The
last of these Opinions is most generally receiv'd,
and wou'd seem very probable, if it had produc'd
any advantageous Alteration in the Condition of
that unfortunate Prince; but there was not the
least Motion made in Order to his Restaurati∣on.
<HI>Achmet</HI> was unanimously elected, and his Ac∣cession
to the Throne was attended with a cer∣tain
Tranquillity that is rarely observ'd in this
Country. The Misfortunes that happen'd in the Be∣ginning
of his Reign seem to be the Forerunners
and Presages of future Disasters; for before the first
Month was expir'd, he lost that Great and Me∣morable
Battle of <HI>Salankemen,</HI> of which I have
<PB N="328" REF="187"/>
already given you an Account. And if I may be
allow'd to give Credit to the probable Conje∣ctures
of those who are best acquainted with the
Genius of his Subjects, I may venture to foretell
that he will never be an old Emperour, tho' he
is already in the <HI>Eight and fortieth</HI> Year of his
Age. For the <HI>Franks</HI> are possess'd with a less ad∣vantageous
Opinion of him than of his Predeces∣sor
<HI>Soliman,</HI> whose Reign was nevertheless di∣sturb'd
with an almost perpetual Revolt that kept
his Throne continually in a tottering Condition.</P>
<P>The Death of the <HI>Visier Kopergli,</HI> according to
the usual Custom of this Country, was follow'd
with several Changes of Officers, and the Death
of many great Persons, among the rest of one
<HI>Mustapha Aga,</HI> whom I knew at <HI>Constantinople.</HI>
He was born at <HI>Leghorn</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and had
the Disadvantage to be descended of a Fa∣mily
which had no considerable Fortune. He
was taken by the <HI>Turks</HI> at the Siege of <HI>Candy,</HI>
and renounc'd his Religion at the Desire of the
<HI>Grand Visier,</HI> who had a good Opinion of his A∣bilities,
and resolv'd to put him in a Way of
Bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness. He was easily prevail'd with to em∣brace
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Faith; for since he was natural∣ly
of an aspiring Temper, he enter'd with Joy
into the Service of a Man by whose Interest he
might expect to raise his Fortune, and either
out of Gratitude, or Policy, he chose always to
depend on that Family. So that the late <HI>Visier,
Kopergli Oglou,</HI> was his particular Patron, and ad∣vanc'd
him to the <HI>Tophana,</HI> that is, the Found∣ing
or Casting of Metals, of which he was Di∣rectour-General,
as well as of the Mint, which is
the most gainful Post in the Empire. And be∣sides
he made a very considerable Addition to
the usual Profits of that Office, by inventing and
introducing a certain Copper Coin, call'd <HI>Man∣gours:</HI>
<PB N="329" REF="187"/>
for each Piece was order'd to pass at the
Rate of six <HI>French Deniers,</HI> tho' 'twas no larger
than a <HI>Dutch Doit,</HI> or a single <HI>French Denier;</HI> so
that buying the Copper at <HI>twenty Pence</HI> a Pound, the
Profit amounted to <HI>Six</HI> in <HI>Seven.</HI> Not long af∣ter
the Advancement of <HI>Kopergli Oglou, Mustapha</HI>
propos'd this Expedient to fill the Treasury,
which till this time was very empty; and
had Orders to coin Four thousand <HI>Purses</HI> of
that Money, or Two millions of Crowns. So
prodigious a Quantity of those Pieces cou'd not
but occasion great Disorders, and a general In∣terruption
of Trade; and besides those that were
coin'd at the Mint, there came several Barks la∣den
with 'em from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> where
they were coin'd by the <HI>Jews,</HI> so that there are
above Two hundred thousand Crowns of Coun∣terfeit
Money at present in the Empire. At last
People were so discourag'd at those Abuses, that
about three Months ago they began to refuse to
take these Pieces for more than one half, and at
present they will not take 'em at all, notwith∣standing
the repeated Orders of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI>
who (as I intimated before) is not much respect∣ed
in this Country. The Disorders occasion'd by
the debasing of the Coin, and the vast Estate <HI>Musta∣pha
Aga</HI> had acquir'd, were the Causes of his Death.
His Enemies had long before begun to exclaim
against the Methods he took to oppress the Peo∣ple;
pretending that he was a <HI>Christian</HI> in his
Heart, and that he wou'd at last make his E∣scape
to <HI>Italy</HI> with all the Treasure he had scrap'd
together in the Empire, which certainly had been
the most prudent Course for a Man in his Cir∣cumstances.
But since the Desire of Riches is like
the Thirst of some diseas'd Persons, which is en∣creas'd
by Drinking, instead of heark'ning to the
Advice of his Friends, he took a quite contrary
<PB N="330" REF="188"/>
Method, and sent for his Sister and Nephews,
thinking by that Means to vindicate himself from
the Aspersions that were fix'd upon him by his
Adversaries. Besides he plac'd an entire Confi∣dence
in the <HI>Grand Visier,</HI> and thought himself
absolutely secure under the Protection of so kind
and powerful a Patron: but he ought to have
consider'd that his Patron was Mortal, and that
his Interest wou'd expire with his Life. 'Tis
plain by the Event, that he shou'd have acted
more warily in so dangerous a Post; for I have
just now receiv'd a Letter which informs me that
he was strangl'd, after they had given him
the Torture to make him discover his Money.
And he was even so strangely infatuated, that
tho' he was not apprehended for the Space of
Eight Days after the <HI>Visi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI>'s Death, instead of
making his Escape, he chose rather to expect his
Fate at his own House; where he was at last ar∣rested
by the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> with his Wife, Sister, and
Nephews. These unfortunate Creatures, who have
not yet renounc'd the <HI>Catholic</HI> Religion, sent to
beg <HI>Monsieur de Chateauneuf</HI>'s Protection for the
obtaining of their Liberty: but he is too much a
Politician to hazard his Interest at the Port to
preserve the Honour of his Religion.</P>
<P>They begin again to talk of Peace more than
ever; and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m inform'd that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambas∣sadour
has prevail'd with the New <HI>Visier Hali,</HI> to
continue the Negotiations for that Effect at <HI>Adri∣anople,</HI>
whither he and the <HI>English</HI> Ambassadour,
Sir <HI>William Hussy,</HI> will set forward in few Days;
and 'tis generally believ'd that the Treaty will
be brought to a happy Conclusion, assoon as
the Count <HI>de Marsigli</HI> is return'd from <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI>
whither he went to receive the Empe∣rour's
final Instructions: So that I hope I shall

<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not forgot the Promise I made you at
the End of my last Letter; but I know not
if you will thank me for keeping my Word,
since instead of the News I hop'd to send you,
I must acquaint you that the Negotiations for a
Peace are at an End, or rather interrupted for
some time; for 'tis so much the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s
Int'rest to conclude a Treaty, that without pre∣tending
to the Spirit of Prophesie, I may venture
to foretel that it will be renew'd. In the mean
time it will not be improper to give you an Ac∣count
of this unexpected Accident. The <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadors arriv'd at <HI>Adrianople</HI> in the
Beginning of the last Month, and had several
Conferences with the <HI>Grand Visier,</HI> in which the
greatest part of the Articles were mutually agreed
on; and the only Difficulty that obstructed the
happy Conclusion of the Treaty, was the <HI>Visier</HI>'s
insisting upon the Restoring of <HI>Buda,</HI> and the keep∣ing
of <HI>Caminiec,</HI> concerning which they expected
Instructions from the Emperor. While Affairs
were in this Posture, the Plague began to rage so
violently at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> that the Ambassadors thought
<PB N="332" REF="189"/>
fit to retire to a Vilage two Leagues on this side
the Town, till the Fury of the Distemper shou'd
be somewhat abated. But the Baron <HI>de Chateau∣neuf</HI>
having receiv'd new Instructions, which in all
probability were accompany'd with some weigh∣ty
Proposals, came to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> tho' he was nei∣ther
sent for nor expected; and without the least
Regard to the preservation of his Life, he had the
Courage to brave Death in the midst of a City
where she seem'd to have fix'd the Seat of her
Empire; for the Plague made so terrible a Havock,
that there died above a Thousand Persons a Day.
At the same time it happen'd that Sir <HI>William Hussy</HI>
was in a Gallery, and perceiving a Company of
Men in the Plain, he had the Curiosity to send one
of his Servants to inquire who they were. As soon
as he heard that 'twas the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, he
began to dread the Consequences of that Mini∣ster<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
Journey; for he consider'd that he wou'd ne∣ver
have expos'd himself to so imminent a Danger,
and even without being call'd, if there had not
been some hidden and extraordinary Design in
Agitation. 'Tis thought that the <HI>French</HI> King be∣ing
inform'd of the great Progress that was made
in the Treaty, sent Instructions to his Ambassa∣dor,
impowering him to conclude a secret Alliance
with the <HI>Turks;</HI> and 'tis but too plain that these are
more than bare Conjectures; for the <HI>Visier</HI> wou'd
never afterwards hear the least Word of a Peace.
However, 'tis certain that Sir <HI>William Hussey</HI>'s Vexation
at so unexpected a Disappointment, contributed
not a little to his Death; for you must not give
credit to the Surmises of those who pretend that
he was poyson'd, since there was not the least
Mark of Poyson found in his Body, which was
open'd by his own Chirurgeon, in the presence of
his Chaplain, Secretary, and the rest of his Dome∣stick
Servants. But tho' in all probability the
<PB N="333" REF="189"/>
<HI>French</HI> had no hand in this Gentleman's Death,
I dare not pronounce 'em guiltless of the Attempt
that was made upon Count <HI>Marsigli,</HI> who was as∣saulted
near <HI>Belgrade,</HI> in his return from <HI>Vienna</HI> with
his <HI>Imperial Majesty's</HI> Answer. His <HI>Chiaoux,</HI> and two
of his Servants, were kill'd upon the Spot, and
he was wounded in five places both with Sa∣bres
and Pistols: But before they had time to di∣spatch
him, the Prince of <HI>Moldavia</HI> came seasona∣bly
to his Assistance, tho' he cou'd not seize the
Murderers, because they fled as soon as they per∣ceiv'd
him. All these Circumstances, and the Jun∣cture
of the Time, make me very inclinable to
believe that this Attempt was not made without
a particular Order. I took Occasion Yesterday to
discourse concerning this Accident with the <HI>Con∣sul
de Hochepied,</HI> whose Vertue makes him so inca∣pable
of Suspicion, that he cannot believe the
<HI>French</HI> wou'd be guilty of so Barbarous an Action;
and besides, he is persuaded that the Murderers
wou'd have seiz'd on the Count's Papers, if they
had been set on by the <HI>French.</HI> But in my Opi∣nion
that Circumstance ought not to be alleg'd
as an Argument in their Vindication; for the sei∣zing
of the Papers wou'd have plainly discover'd the
Authors of the Murder; and we may reasonably
suppose, that tho' the <HI>French</HI> King takes no care
to conceal the boundlesness of his Ambition, he
wou'd be loath to be reckon'd an Abettor of Mur∣derers.
And besides, he might well dispense with
a Sight of the Emperor's Orders and Count <HI>Mar∣sigli</HI>'s
Instructions, since he entertains so many Spies
at the <HI>Port,</HI> who make it their Business to disco∣ver
the most secret Transactions, and had in all
probability acquainted him with every thing that
related to the Negotiation. Thus Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has
had the Misfortune to see all his Hopes unexpect∣edly
blasted; and we may reasonably suppose that
<PB N="334" REF="190"/>
his Vexation is considerably heighten'd by the im∣possibility
of regaining his Ground: For Money is
the prevailing Argument at the <HI>Port,</HI> and the in∣fallible
Rule by which all Controversies are deci∣ded.
I cannot better represent the Genius of the
<HI>Aga's, Bassa's,</HI> that <HI>Visiers</HI> that compose this Court,
than by comparing 'em to a Company of Mer∣chants,
who wou'd sell the very State if they
cou'd, to the highest Bidder. And the same Cha∣racter
may be universally apply'd to private Persons;
for Int'rest is the Idol to which they sacrifice their
Quiet, Honour, Emperor, and even the Empire it
self. This is the fatal Source of all those terrible
Disorders and Revolutions, of which we find so
many Instances in History, that wou'd seem alto∣gether
incredible if almost every Day did not
furnish us with fresh Examples of 'em.</P>
<P>There is at present in this Place one of Count
<HI>Tekely</HI>'s Relations, who came lately from <HI>France;</HI>
and 'tis observable, that he was not at all sur∣priz'd
at the News of the unsuccessful Conclusion
of the Treaty, which makes us believe that he ex∣pected
so sudden a Change, and was not ignorant
of the Causes of it. He lodges at the <HI>Consul</HI>'s
House, and is just ready to depart for <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI>
where 'tis said he intends to lodge with <HI>Mon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieur
Chateauneuf.</HI> I know not what Treatment he
expects from the Ambassador, but I'm apt to be∣lieve
he will not meet with a very Ceremonious
Reception: For when the Count himself paid a
Visit to the Ambassador at <HI>Sophia,</HI> he receiv'd
him in his Bed, and pretended a Fit of Sickness,
to avoid the Ceremony of a formal Reception;
for there were some Reasons that inclin'd him to
receive the Count as Prince of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> as
there were others that oblig'd him to treat him
only as Count <HI>Tekely.</HI></P>

<P>The Triumph of a Christian that has renouned the Faith</P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="191"/>
I had Occasion this very Day to see the Tri∣umphant
Procession of a <HI>Genoese</HI> Renegado, who
came hither in a Ship belonging to <HI>Provence.</HI> Since
the <HI>Cadi's</HI> are oblig'd by the Chartel not to re∣ceive
a <HI>Christian</HI> that intends to abjure his Religi∣on
till they have first acquainted the <HI>Consul</HI> of his
Nation, who is to examine whether his Apostacy
be voluntary or constrain'd; the <HI>Cadi</HI> of the City
sent to inform the <HI>French</HI> Consul, that a <HI>Frank</HI> who
came under the Banner of <HI>France,</HI> was resolv'd to
turn <HI>Musulman,</HI> adding, that he might send his
Interpreters to examine the new Convert, and re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eive
his Declaration. The <HI>Consul</HI> reply'd, that
he did not know the Man, nor was at all con∣cern'd
with his Resolution; but hearing that the
Cavalcade was to pass by his Gate, he sent Word
to the <HI>Cadi,</HI> that he wou'd take it as an Affront,
and order the Renegado to be seiz'd in the midst
of his Triumph, and chastis'd with five hundred
<HI>Bastonado's.</HI> Nevertheless he was so far from en∣deavouring
to execute his Menaces, that he suf∣fer'd
the whole Procession to pass under his Win∣dows
without making the least Attempt to disturb
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em. I shall take this Occasion to give you a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ief Account of the Ceremonies that are us'd
when a <HI>Christian</HI> intends to abjure his Religion.
First they instruct him in the Principles of the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, and after a whole Month
spent in that Exercise, they gather a Contributi∣on
to buy a Sute of Clothes for him, which some∣times
amounts to fifty Crowns, but rarely exceeds
that Summ; and they commonly use Force when
People are not willing to contribute out of Cha∣rity.
Then the Renegado is carry'd before the
<HI>Cadi,</HI> in whose Presence, and of two <HI>Effendi's,</HI>
and several other Persons, he makes a public Pro∣fession
of his Faith with the following Ceremo∣nies.
First an <HI>Isman</HI> makes him perform the <HI>Goul,</HI>
<PB N="336" REF="192"/>
which is their most Solemn Ablution, and as he
begins to wash himself, he pronounces these Words,
<HI>bis millah el azem ve ellem doullillah allah din is lam; In
the Name of the Great God, Glory be to God, the God of the
Musulman Faith.</HI> Then the <HI>Isman</HI> himself performs
the <HI>Goul,</HI> for they reckon themselves polluted by
touching a <HI>Christian;</HI> after which they both put
on their Clothes, and come before the <HI>Cadi,</HI> who
says to the Renegado, <HI>Art thou willing to turn Mu∣sulman.</HI>
After he has reply'd, <HI>Yes,</HI> the <HI>Isman</HI> takes
the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in both his Hands, and holding it a∣bove
the <HI>Christian's</HI> Head, he says first <HI>bis millah, in
the Name of God;</HI> then addressing himself to the
<HI>Christian,</HI> he proceeds thus; <HI>Allah ecber, allah ecber,
allah ecber, eschad in la illah, illallah, eschad in Mebe∣met
resoul allah;</HI> which are almost the same Words
that are proclaim'd by the <HI>Muezins</HI> from the <HI>Mi∣narets</HI>
or Steeples of the <HI>Mosquees.</HI> The Renegado
replies, <HI>Illah, illallah Mehemet resoul allah; There is no
other God, and Mahomet is his great Prophet;</HI> and as
soon as he has made a public Profession of his
Faith by pronouncing these Words, they put a
<HI>Turbant</HI> on his Head, and make him kiss the <HI>Al∣coran,</HI>
which he cou'd not do before without a
Crime. Then they embrace and caress him, and
put all things in order for the Cavalcade, having
already provided two or three Hundred Men,
arm'd with Sabres, Carabines, and Pistols, with six
Ensigns, two of which march before, and the o∣ther
four surround the Renegado, who is almost
entirely cover'd by 'em. He is mounted on a fine
Horse, which the <HI>Cadi</HI> lends him, adorn'd with a
rich Vest, which he wears all the rest of the Day.
The Soldiers march four in a Rank, expressing their
Joy by loud Shouts and repeated Volleys of Shot,
the Renegado walking in the midst of 'em with
the Ensigns. Thus they march in a Triumphant
manner thro' the City; but all this Pomp is but
<PB N="337" REF="192"/>
an Introduction to the Scene of Pain, for as soon
as the Triumph is over, they proceed to Cir∣cumcision,
which is thus perform'd: They draw
their Prepuce over the Glans or Nut of the
Yard, and pressing it between two little Pieces of
Iron, they cut off with a Razor that part of the
Fore-Skin which reaches beyond the Glans, and
at that very Moment the Apostate must once
more repeat these Words, <HI>la illah illallah, Mehemet
resoul allah.</HI> After this Ceremony, the new <HI>Musul∣man</HI>
must keep his Bed fifteen Days; for the Cure
of the Wound is rarely compleated sooner; after
which he may chuse what Imployment he plea∣ses;
that is, he may either List himself in the Ar∣my,
or enter into Service, tho' such Persons usu∣ally
become extremely miserable. For there is no∣thing
more common than to see a Renegado
begging; and the <HI>Turks</HI> are so far from relieving
'em in their Distress, that the very Name of a
<HI>Renegado</HI> is sufficient to make those who bear it hated
and despis'd, not only by the <HI>Christians,</HI> who look up∣on
'em as base and cowardly Apostates, but even
by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who can never be persuaded by all
their seeming Devotion that they are sincere Pro∣fessors
of the <HI>Musulman</HI> Faith.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have at last finish'd the Account
I promis'd to give you of this Country, which I
intend to leave very speedily. I design to em∣bark
on a <HI>French</HI> Ship, which, with another Ves∣sel
of the same Nation, is bound for <HI>Venice,</HI> from
whence I resolve to continue my Journey to <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
by Land, during which I hope my Observa∣tions
will furnish me with fresh Matter to enter∣tain
you now and then with a Letter. I thought
to have pass'd by <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> that I might
have satisfy'd my Curiosity with a View of
a very considerable Rarity, I mean the Bones of
a Giant that were found by some Work-men in
<PB N="338" REF="193"/>
that Place, as they were digging the Foundations
of a House for the <HI>Bassa.</HI> All the Chirurgeons
of the Country have examin'd 'em, and have gi∣ven
in a formal Attestation in which they con∣clude
that these are the real Bones of a Man,
whose Height, according to their Computation,
amounted to above Twenty Feet; so that this
may be look'd upon as a Confirmation of the Sto∣ry
of the Giant at <HI>Spire</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI> But I must
e'en content my self with the Accounts I have
heard of that Curiosity, since our Captain intends
not to touch at that Place. I shall have the good
Fortune during our Voyage to have the Conversati∣on
of one <HI>Signior Stephano,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Engineer, who
having spent Eight or Ten Years in the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Service, is not willing to continue longer in so
dangerous a Post. He is an ingenious and witty
Person, and will doubtless prove a very agreeable
Companion: Besides, he intends to carry his
Wife along with him, who is a little <HI>Greek,</HI> about
Eighteen Years old, and the prettyest Creature in
the World; so that I hope to pass these Seas with
more Pleasure than I did before.</P>
<P>We have just now receiv'd the good News of
Count <HI>Marsigli's</HI> Recovery, with which I shall
conclude this Letter. I have already told you that
he was very dangerously wounded, and am glad I
can now inform you that the Vigour of his Con∣stitution,
and the Care of his Physicians, have hap∣pily
restor'd him to his Health. If the Malice of
his Enemies had succeeded according to their De∣sire,
the Emperor wou'd have had reason to
bewail the Loss of a Man who is very well fit∣ted
for the Management of important Negotiati∣ons.
He was born at <HI>Pisa</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and is descen∣ded
of a very considerable Family; but has not
yet been dignify'd with any other Character than
that of Secratary to the <HI>English</HI> Embassy; tho'
<PB N="339" REF="193"/>
he is really a secret Envoy from the Emperor,
and only assumes the other Title that he may with
more Security negotiate his Master's Affairs. But
if the Peace were concluded, he wou'd certainly
be rewarded with a higher Post.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR present Confinement puts me in mind of
the eager Impatience of a <HI>Lover</HI> who <HI>sees,</HI> but
dares not <HI>approach</HI> his <HI>Mistress.</HI> For here we must
lie in the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> and content our selves with
making Court to the <HI>Signora Venetia Bella,</HI> without
the least hope of enjoying her Beauties, till we
have purchas'd the Charming Delight at the rate
of Forty Days sighing and whining. We are de∣tain'd
here by an Order from the <HI>Tribunal of Health,</HI>
least we shou'd spread some Infectious Distemper;
and I among the rest am forc'd to bear this un∣easie
Restraint, tho' I'm at present in as perfect
Health as any of these Cautious Gentlemen. But
perhaps you'll be more inquisitive to know how
we came hither, than how we spend our Time
here; and therefore I shall proceed to give you a
short Account of our Voyage.</P>
<P>I left <HI>Smyrna</HI> some Days after the writing of
my last Letter, not without a very sensible Affli∣ction
at my taking leave of Monsieur and Madam
<PB N="340" REF="194"/>
<HI>de Hochepied,</HI> from whom I had receiv'd so ma∣ny
Favours and Civilities during my abode in
their House.</P>
<P>Our Voyage was disturb'd by an almost perpetu∣al
Storm, which redoubling its Fury from Day to
Day, made us conclude more than once that we
shou'd certainly be bury'd in the Waves. Poor
<HI>Signior Stephano,</HI> whom I mention'd in my last,
fell sick two Days after he embark'd, and being
unable to bear the tempestuous Working of the
Sea, dy'd Eight Days after. The Superstition of
our Ship's Crew furnish'd us with a very plea∣sant
Scene; for they unanimously concluded him
to be a Sorcerer, because they had seen him draw
some Mathematical Figures during the first two
Days of our Voyage, and were absolutely confirm'd
in that Opinion by a curious Mechanical Experi∣ment
he happen'd to try in their presence, by
lifting up a very considerable Weight with one
Hand, which those thick-skull'd Animals thought
impossible to be perform'd without the Assistance
of <HI>Magic.</HI> This ridiculous Conceit made so strong
an Impression upon upon 'em, that they slighted
all the Arguments and Asseverations I cou'd use to
undeceive 'em, and not only persist in their Belief
of <HI>Signior Stephano's</HI> Skill in the Diabolioal Art, but
impute all the bad Weather to his Conjurations▪
The Captain pretends to be of the same Opinion,
tho' I know not how to reconcile his Complai∣sance
to the young Widow to the Sentiments he
seems to have of her Husband; For he obliges her
to perform her <HI>Quarantain</HI> on Board his Ship, and
resolves to make her his Wife.</P>
<P>The Storm forc'd us to stand in to a Canal
between two little Islands, call'd <HI>Millo</HI> and <HI>Argen∣tiere.</HI>
The first is Forty Miles in Compass, and
the whole Country is Mountainous, except a plea∣sant
and fertil Plain, six or seven Miles long, in
<PB N="341" REF="194"/>
the midst of which stands the City of <HI>Millo,</HI> con∣taining
about Twenty narrow Streets. The In∣habitants
are generally <HI>Greeks;</HI> but there are also
3 or 400 Souls of the <HI>Latin</HI> Church, who have
their Bishop and Cathedral. The <HI>Venetians</HI> main∣tain
a <HI>Podestat</HI> in the Island to gather the Tribute;
but there is no Garrison kept in it, tho' it receives
frequent Visits from the <HI>Turks;</HI> so that the first
<HI>Corsair</HI> who comes with a numerous Company, is
King of the Island so long as he pleases to reside
it it. Yet the Pyrates never commit any disor∣ders
in this place, by reason of the Assistance they
receive from the Merchants that live here, who
furnish 'em with Commodities to be paid out of
the next Prize that falls into their Hands. There
is a <HI>French</HI> Ordinary in the Town, where one may
find pretty good Entertainment: And I remember
I saw a Man there of so free and open a Dispo∣sition,
that I shou'd have thought him a Rarity
in that Country, if I had not been told that all
these Islanders are generally of that Humour. He
took occasion to Discourse of a Maid who was
his Wife's Daughter, and declar'd that he wou'd
willingly dispose of her to a Husband. One who
was present lik'd the Proposal, and told him that
he wou'd ease him of the Burden if he pleas'd to
bestow her upon him. <HI>With all my Heart,</HI> reply'd
the Father: <HI>Then,</HI> said the other, <HI>I desire to know
what you are willing to give with her. What d'ye
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean,</HI> reply'd the old Gentleman, <HI>Give with her,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oth' a; Why, I wont give her self for nothing. You
most take me for a silly Coxcomb indeed, if you think I'll
give you a pretty lively Girl, and hire you to take her?
No, I beg your pardon, 'tis you must give the Money:
And if I can find none that will take my Daughter on these
Terms, I'll e'en keep her, and make use of her my
self.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="195"/>
The Women are so accustom'd to the Converse
of the Pyrates, that they are generally very liberal
of their Favours, but not quite so frank as their
Neighbours of <HI>Argentiere,</HI> which is another little
Island, about Twenty Miles in Compass, contain∣ing
only a little Town and a Village, both inha∣bited
by about Five hundred Women; for there is
not a Man in the Island, except Seven or Eight
<HI>Papa's,</HI> who perform <HI>Divine Service.</HI> These Wo∣men
have no Trade to maintain 'em, but live
purely on the Work of Nature; so that all the
Merchants and Corsairs, who come to the Island,
chuse a Female-Companion, either fair or brown,
according to every Man's particular Fancy. The
Children are left to the Disposal of the Women;
the Girls grow up and work to maintain their Mo∣thers;
but assoon as the Boys are Twelve Years
old, they are put on Board the first Vessel that
touches at the Island.</P>
<P>From thence we continu'd our Voyage to <HI>Zant,</HI>
a considerable Island belonging to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> It
contains a hundred Miles in Compass, and produ∣ces
great Store of delicious Wines, both <HI>Muscadin</HI>
and other Sorts. But since <HI>Italy</HI> is sufficiently
stock'd with these Commodities, the Inhabitants
of this Island dry most of their Grapes, and
send 'em to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> Both the City
and Harbour are commanded by a very fine Ca∣stle,
where the Proveditore, who is always cho∣sen
out of the Principal Nobility, resides. The
Inhabitants are Rich, and there are several Gen∣tlemen
among 'em. This is the first place as you
come from the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> where you meet with
People cloath'd after the manner of the <HI>Franks;</HI>
yet many of 'em wear a <HI>Turkish</HI> Vest above their
other Cloaths. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have built several
Churches for the Use of those who profess the
<HI>Romish</HI> Faith; and do what they can to establish
<PB N="343" REF="195"/>
that Religion, in Opposition to that of the <HI>Greeks,</HI>
which is the Religion of the Natives. The City
is long and narrow; which is all the Account I
can give you of it, for those who come from the
<HI>Levant</HI> are not suffer'd to go a-shore till they
have perform'd their <HI>Quarantain.</HI> The Prince of
<HI>Brunswick,</HI> who serves in the Army of the Re∣publick,
pass'd the whole last Winter in this place;
and gain'd the Love of the Inhabitants to such a
Degree, that there is not a Man of 'em who
wou'd not sacrifice himself for his Sake. I heard
a Story of that Prince, which I'm confident will
give you some Diversion. He fell in Love with
a very Beautiful Courtezan, who treated him with
an extraordinary Coyness; either because she had
a particular Aversion to him, or (which is the
more probable Reason of the two) because she
thought he was very deeply engag'd, and inten∣ded
to make him pay dear for a Favour which
he desir'd with so much Ardour. But whatever
was the true Cause of her Rigour, the Prince
persisted in his unsuccessful Courtship; but his Pati∣ence
being at last exhausted, he resolv'd upon a
Stratagem to satisfie at once both his Love and
Revenge: There are in <HI>Zant</HI> certain Porters call'd
<HI>Cestariols,</HI> whose Business is to carry home the
Provisions that are bought by the Citizens at the
Market. The irritated Prince procur'd a <HI>Cesta∣riol's</HI>
Habit, which disguis'd him so well that he had
no Reason to fear a Discovery. In that Dress
he went to the Courtezan's Waiting-Maid, and
told her, that he was so passionately in Love with
her Mistress, that he shou'd certainly lose his Rea∣son
if she wou'd not suffer her self to be touch'd
with a compassionate Sense of his Sufferings. And
to engage the Maid to employ her Interest in his
Favour, he presented her with Ten <HI>Sequins,</HI> which
amount to about Five and twenty Crowns; and
<PB N="344" REF="196"/>
assur'd her that if by her Assistance he cou'd pro∣cure
one Night's Pleasure, he wou'd give her as
many <HI>Sequins</HI> more, and wou'd besides reward the
<HI>Signora</HI> so liberally, that she shou'd never have
Reason to repent her Condescension to him. The
Maid was extremely surpriz'd at the <HI>Cestariol</HI>'s Boun∣ty:
however she forgot not to deliver his Message to
her Mistress, who seem'd to receive it very cold∣ly;
for she thought such an Action wou'd make
her be look'd upon as a common Prostitute. But
the Maid, who perhaps was not so scrupulous,
and had so considerable an Interest in the Suc∣cess
of this Affair, us'd all the Arguments she
cou'd invent, to perswade her Mistress to a Com∣pliance,
and concluded her Exhortations with this
wise and prevailing Remark, That a <HI>Cestariol</HI> with
a full Purse wou'd prove a better Customer than
a <HI>Proveditore</HI> with an empty one; adding, that the
Mistress might expect a very Noble Acknowledg∣ment
from one that had been so liberal to the
Maid. These sage Remonstrances had so good an
Effect, that the <HI>Cestariol</HI> was introduc'd in the E∣vening
to the <HI>Signora</HI>'s Chamber, where he quick∣ly
storm'd the Place that had so long with∣stood
his Attacks. 'Twou'd be as needless to give
you a more particular Account of his Night's
Work, as it wou'd be to represent the Confusion
and Astonisment that seiz'd the Fair One in the
Morning, when she saw her Chamber full of Ser∣vants
that came to dress her Bed-fellow, and found
that the pretended <HI>Cestariol</HI> was transform'd into the
Prince of <HI>Brunswick.</HI> However she endeavour'd to
set the best Face she cou'd on so cross an Adventure,
and comforted her self with the Expectation of a
magnificent Reward. But she cou'd no longer con∣ceal
the Discomposure of her Mind, when instead
of a Handful of <HI>Sequins</HI> the Prince presented her
with <HI>Three-pence,</HI> adding, That <HI>if she had entertain'd
<PB N="345" REF="196"/>
him as a Prince, he wou'd have paid her as a Prince;
but since she had only treated him as a Porter, she must
content her self with Porter's Wages.</HI></P>
<P>Departing from <HI>Zant,</HI> we left <HI>Corfou</HI> on our Left-hand,
and enter'd the Gulf, at the Mouth of which
we lost our Long-Boat in a Storm. The Fury of
the Tempest being somewhat abated, we conti∣nu'd
our Course with a Side-Wind, and about Mid∣night
perceiv'd, by the Light of the Moon, a Sail,
which pass'd very near our Ship without haling us. But
she had scarce left us half a Mile when she tack'd
about, and bore down upon us with full Sails; and
since she was lighter than our Vessel, she quickly
came up with us. Our Captain concluding that
she design'd to attack us, commanded every Man
to his Post, and put all things in a Readiness for
an Engagement, swearing that he wou'd fire at her,
if she came nearer. Some of the Seamen endea∣vour'd
to perswade him that a Corsair wou'd hard∣ly
venture to cruize in the Gulf; and that if the
Vessel we fear'd had had such a Design, she wou'd
have either fir'd at us, or boarded us as she pass'd
by. But he continu'd fix'd in his Resolution, tel∣ling
'em that he plac'd more Confidence in his
Guns than in their Arguments; and that if the
Captain did not know his own Business, he wou'd
endeavour to instruct him. And indeed he kept
his Word, for assoon as cou'd have a full Aim
to point his Guns at her Side, he gave her a
Broad-side, and tacking about, rak'd her fore and
aft: but it seems she was better acquainted with
the Rules of Good-breeding than we expected, for
she quickly return'd our Compliment with the same
Ceremonies, and then bore away. Our Cabbin
was pierc'd with a Shot, which was all the Dam∣mage
we receiv'd, except the breaking of a Bar∣rel
of excellent Wine, which I had provided
<PB N="346" REF="197"/>
at <HI>Zant</HI> for my own Use, during the <HI>Quaran∣tain.</HI></P>
<P>Two Days after we made the Height of <HI>Ragu∣sa,</HI>
which is a considerable City seated on the
Sea-side; Toward the Sea 'tis defended by a strong
Cittadel, and on the other Side by a high and in∣accessible
Mountain. Its Figure is almost round,
and its Circuit exceeds not two Miles. The Hou∣ses
are generally pretty well built; but there are
none that deserve a particular Observation. The
Government is <HI>Aristocratical,</HI> not much different
from that of <HI>Venice,</HI> only its Weakness makes it
act more cautiously for the Preservation of its Li∣berty.
The Senate is compos'd of Gentlemen and
a <HI>Doge:</HI> but this Dignity instead of continuing for
Life, as at <HI>Venice,</HI> lasts but a Month, after which a
New <HI>Doge</HI> is Elected with so little Intriguing, that
oftentimes a Gentleman walking in the Public
Place, is surpriz'd with the News of his Electi∣on.
During the time of his Government he is
serv'd and entertain'd at the Public Charge, after
which he returns home to dress his Garden. Since
the Government of the Castle is a more impor∣tant
Office, and the Ill-management of it might prove
more fatal to the Republic, it lasts not so long as
the former: for a New Governour is chosen every
Night, and oblig'd to remain in the Castle till his
Successour come to relieve him. So that the No∣bles
reckon this Commission rather a Trouble than
an Honour; and wou'd be as glad to be exempted
from it, as a Captain wou'd be pleas'd to be excus'd
from mounting the Guard. The Garrison consists of
Two hundred Men, and besides the Burgers are
oblig'd to keep Guard with 'em. The Gentle∣men
are exempted from that Trouble, but they
must not lie one Night out of the City without
a special Permission. S. <HI>Blaise</HI> is the Patron of
<HI>Ragusa,</HI> as S. <HI>Mark</HI> is of <HI>Venice:</HI> and is painted on
<PB N="347" REF="197"/>
their Banners and Ensigns, and wherever 'tis the
Custom to place the Arms of the Republic. A
Mile from the Town towards the Mouth of the
Gulf, stands the ancient City of <HI>Ragusa,</HI> which at
present is call'd <HI>Ragusa Vecchio.</HI> 'Tis inhabited by
some poor People, and seems rather to be a Village
than a City. The whole Territory of <HI>Ragusa</HI> ex∣tends
not Thirty Miles round the City, and at
Sea they are only possess'd of the Island of <HI>Au∣gusta.</HI>
This little Republic makes a great Noise
with a certain imaginary Liberty, of which the
<HI>Ragusans</HI> are extremely fond, tho' really they are
not Masters of themselves; for they are absolute∣ly
commanded by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and must do what
whatever they please. The <HI>Turk</HI> and Emperour
content themselves with a moderate Tribute, with∣out
medling with the Affairs of the Republic; but
if the Payment be delay'd, the <HI>Ragusans</HI> run the
the Hazard of paying dear for their Neglect. And
besides they are on several Occasions insulted over
by the <HI>French</HI> King, and other <HI>European</HI> Princes;
and must tamely suffer the greatest Abuses, without
daring to repine at the Hand which oppresses 'em.
I have all along observ'd, during the whole Course
of my Travels, that one may find every-where
fresh Instances of the Folly and Weakness of
human Nature: and the very Sight of this Place is
sufficient to put a Man in mind of that Reflexi∣on.
For 'tis certain that the Liberty or Inde∣pendency
of the <HI>Ragusans,</HI> as well as of several
other States, is their greatest Misfortune; and
that they wou'd be infinitely more happy under
the Dominion of some potent Master, that cou'd
protect 'em from all the Injuries and Affronts
which they are daily oblig'd to suffer without the
least Hope of Redress. And I'm confident, if you
consider, without Prejudice, the Advantages on
both sides, you will conclude with me, That, not∣withstanding
<PB N="348" REF="198"/>
their boasted Liberty, a Wise Man
wou'd rather chuse to be a Subject of <HI>Venice,</HI>
than to be a Free Citizen of <HI>Ragusa.</HI> But to return to
my Voyage.</P>
<P>The Wind coming fair, we left <HI>Ragusa,</HI> and the
next Morning we came to an Anchor in the
Harbour of the little City <HI>Parenzo</HI> in <HI>Istria,</HI> where
we took a Pilot. For the Republick keeps always
a sufficient Number of Pilots in this place, for
the Conveniency of Ships that are bound for
<HI>Venice;</HI> which are oblig'd to have Recourse to
their Assistance, because from thence to the <HI>La∣gunes</HI>
the Passage is extremely hazardous, by rea∣son
of the Banks of Sand that are form'd by the
Rivers <HI>Po</HI> and <HI>Brent</HI> at their Falling into the Sea.
These Banks are so dangerous, and subject to so
frequent Alterations, that the most skilful Pilots,
who are acquainted with every Rock and Shoal in
the Passage, are forc'd to steer perpetually with
a Line in their Hand, for fear of some fatal
Blunder, which wou'd certainly be punish'd with
Death. The Difficulty of the Passage is a very
considerable Disadvantage and Obstruction to Trade;
but it may be reckon'd the main Security of <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI>
which cannot be attack'd on that Side. For
tho' a Fleet of Ships shou'd be conducted to <HI>Mala∣moca</HI>
by <HI>Venetian</HI> Pilots, 'twou'd be impossible for
'em to ride there, by reason of the stormy Gusts
that happen so frequently in that place.</P>
<P>After the charming View of <HI>Constantinople</HI> from
the Sea of <HI>Marmora,</HI> I never beheld a finer Pro∣spect
than that of <HI>Venice.</HI> At the Distance of
Thirty Miles you begin to perceive the Spires of
the Churches, and the Prospect is still enlarg'd
the nearer you approach; which gives the ravish'd
Spectatour the Idea of a Great City springing out
of the Water. Nor can you possibly free your
self from this pleasant Delusion of the Fancy till
<PB N="349" REF="198"/>
you have enter'd the Town; for all the outer
Houses of the City are founded on Piles in the
midst of the Water. The Port of <HI>Venice</HI> is a large
Plain cover'd with Water, in which there are cer∣tain
Islands or Rising-Grounds, level with the
Water, on the biggest of which <HI>Venice</HI> is built.
most of the other Islands are also cover'd with
Buildings, and make particular Towns; the most
considerable of which is call'd <HI>Judeca,</HI> or the <HI>Jews</HI>
Quarter. 'Tis said to contain Forty thousand
Souls; the Houses are fair, and there are large
Gardens, whither the Inhabitants go to divert
themselves during the Summer, and are accommo∣dated
with all sorts of Provisions, cool Liquors,
and oftentimes with very agreeable Company.</P>
<P>The curious Traveller ought also to take a View
of the Island of <HI>Mouran,</HI> where the fine Looking-Glasses
are made that are so famous over all <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI>
besides several other Curious Works in Glass
and Crystal.</P>
<P>These Islands are call'd <HI>Lacunes</HI> or <HI>Lagunes,</HI> both
such as are, and such as are not, inhabited. Two
of 'em are set apart for the use of those who come
from the <HI>Levant,</HI> where they are oblig'd to perform
their <HI>Quarantain</HI> in certain large Hospitals, call'd
<HI>Lazaretti.</HI> The first, call'd <HI>Lazaretto Vecchio,</HI> is but
a Mile distant from <HI>Venice;</HI> but the other, where
we are confin'd, is five Miles from the City. 'Tis
one continu'd Building, consisting of two Stories,
300 Paces long, and divided by High Walls into
six Apartments, each of which has a particular
Gate that leads into a Square Court, where there
is a Well, but the Water is so bad, that we never
use any but what is brought from <HI>Venice.</HI> Every
Apartment contains Twenty Chambers, Ten above,
and as many below, separated like Cells, with a
Chimney in each. Those who perform their <HI>Qua∣rantain</HI>
are constantly attended by a Guardian or
<PB N="350" REF="199"/>
Keeper, sent for that purpose by the <HI>Tribunal of
Health.</HI> And we have the Misfortune to be plagu'd
with one who mortifies us extremely: For he not
only denies us the Liberty of conversing familiar∣ly
with those who come to see us, but will not
suffer us to approach within Ten Paces of 'em;
and besides, they are oblig'd to take the Wind of
us. No Person whatsoever, nor even the <HI>Doge</HI>
himself, is exempted from these troublesome Seve∣rities,
which are appointed for the Publick Secu∣rity,
and for the Preservation of the City from
contagious Distempers. But tho' we are not per∣mitted
to entertain those who are without the <HI>La∣zaretto,</HI>
there are some things which they are al∣low'd
to receive from us, such as Bread, Wine,
Vessels, Tobacco, Money, Wood, and generally
every thing that does not consist of Threads. And
yet, which in my Opinion is the most intolerable
piece of Nicety in the World, they will not suffer a
Letter to come out of our Hands till it be open'd
and smoak'd: And I was even forc'd to open
<HI>Monsieur de Hochepied's</HI> Letters to his Friends in <HI>Hol∣land;</HI>
so that I shall be oblig'd to deliver 'em un∣seal'd
to the Persons to whom they are directed.
When a Man comes to lodge in one of these
Rooms, he finds nothing but Four bare Walls, and
must therefore buy an entire Set of necessary Fur∣niture:
But as for Provisions, there are <HI>Barcarioli,</HI>
who bring whatever you call for, allowing 'em a
third part of the Price for their Pains. Every
Man must be his own Cook, a Disadvantage
which is more easily supported here than any where
else; for our Time is so great a Burthen to us,
that we are glad of any Occupation; and that
which in another Place would be reckon'd a Trou∣ble,
is esteem'd a Recreation here. The <HI>Lazaretto</HI>
is govern'd by a Prior, appointed by the <HI>Tribunal of
Health.</HI> His Revenue amounts to a Thousand <HI>Du∣cats,</HI>
<PB N="351" REF="199"/>
worth about 3 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> a-piece. He is entrust∣ed
with the Keys of the six Apartments, which
are kept shut from Sun-setting till Eight a-Clock
in the Morning. The Guardians are under his
Command, and are oblig'd to give him an Ac∣count
of every thing. There are 120 of 'em in
Office, who are employ'd by Turns, according to
the Number of Ships that arrive in the Port.
Their Salary, which amounts to half a <HI>Ducat</HI> a-Day,
besides their Entertainment, is not paid by
the Republic, but by a Tax laid upon the Passen∣gers
and Goods that are committed to their Care.
In the same <HI>Lagune</HI> there is a large Enclosure where
the Goods are laid in a sort of Stalls or Market-Houses,
supported by Pillars without Walls, and o∣pen
on all Sides. And there are <HI>Faquini</HI> or Por∣ters
appointed to remove 'em from time to time,
and to take care that nothing be lost or da∣mag'd.</P>
<P>You have doubtless heard of the great Number of
Spies that are kept by the Senate to give notice
of every thing that is said or done against the Go∣vernment.
These Informers are a horrible Plague
to those who are under the Dominion of this Re∣publick,
as well natural <HI>Venetians</HI> as <HI>Greeks.</HI> For
the least Offence exposes a Man to the Severity
of the Inquisition of the State, which is at least
as terrible a Tribunal as that of <HI>Rome.</HI> Nor is it
possible for a Man to know when he shou'd be
upon his Guard; for those who profess the great∣est
Friendship and Fidelity, are oftentimes mere In∣formers.
And besides, there are Spies of all Ranks
and Orders; Servants, Merchants, Officers, Citi∣zens,
and Nobles, who disguise themselves with
so much Care and Dexterity, that 'tis impossible
to penetrate into their hidden Designs. The Re∣public
is so cautious in preventing Discoveries of
this Nature, that those who undertake such a Com∣mission
<PB N="352" REF="200"/>
are enjoyn'd to conceal it even from their
Wives and Children, under pain of suffering the
most rigorous Penalties. And the Scandal and
Odium that attends their Profession is alone suf∣ficient
to oblige 'em to Secresie, tho' they were
not kept in awe by the Fear of Punishment. This
breeds an universal Diffidence and Shieness among
all sorts of People, and makes 'em extremely re∣serv'd
in discovering their Sentiments to one ano∣ther,
especially in the presence of certain Persons
who are more particularly suspected, such as <HI>Monks,</HI>
and the <HI>Guardians of Health</HI> in the <HI>Lazaretti,</HI> who
are generally reckon'd to be the Inquisitor's Spies,
and I believe not without reason, as you will per∣ceive
by the Relation of an Accident that hap∣pen'd
to my self.</P>
<P>As soon as a Vessel enters the Port, the <HI>Tribu∣nal
of Health</HI> sends immediately a Guardian with a
<HI>Phanti</HI> on board to conduct the Passengers to the
<HI>Lazaretto,</HI> that no time may be lost; for the <HI>Qua∣rantain</HI>
is not reputed to begin till the Day after
they come a-shore. But tho' this Custom is ve∣ry
exactly observ'd on all Occasions, there arose
a Dispute in our Ship about some Matters relating
to Trade, that retarded our Landing Four Days,
which consequently were not reckon'd in the For∣ty
Days of our <HI>Quarantain.</HI> This Delay occasion'd
a general Discontent among us, and we were the
more sensibly afflicted, because we neither foresaw
nor knew how to remedy our Misfortunes. How∣ever,
the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI> whom he had take
on board at <HI>Zant,</HI> conceal'd their Resentments
with all possible Care. But I who was not so well
acquainted with the Customs of the Place, and
perhaps am naturally of too free a Humour, cou'd
not forbear complaining of this Injustice that was
done us, and was even so far transported, that I
express'd my Impatience and Indignation in very
<PB N="353" REF="200"/>
bold and emphatic Terms. In the mean time I
was extremely surpriz'd to perceive an universal Si∣lence
among those who heard me, and was so vex'd
to find that none of 'em wou'd join with me, that
at last I held my Peace. An Hour after, the Cap∣tain
took me aside, and told me that I was ruin'd:
I entreated him to let me know the reason that
made him give me so unwelcom an Admonition:
<HI>Because,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>you have spoken disadvantageously
of the Government before a Guardian, who is certainly
an Informer;</HI> adding, that he wou'd not have spo∣ken
so freely for a Hundred thousand Crowns.
Then he related five or six Tragical Stories of Per∣sons
that had lost their Lives for less provoking
Crimes, and added so many Arguments to convince
me of my Danger, that I began to be afraid in
good earnest, and to complain of his Unkindness
in not giving me more timely warning. He re∣ply'd,
that he ne'er thought of it, and that he
cou'd not imagine me to be ignorant of a thing
that was so universally known. <HI>The only way I
can suggest to you,</HI> added he, <HI>to prevent your Ruine,
is to be silent for the future, and to bribe the Guardian
with a Present, which perhaps will stop his Mouth.</HI> In
pursuance of his Advice, I gave the Guardian two
<HI>Sequins,</HI> and endeavour'd to oblige him by all
the Marks of Friendship and Kindness during the
two days we remain'd on Board after that Accident.
Yet after all, he inform'd against me, at least I had
reason to suspect him; for the Prior told me t'other
Day, that the Inquisitor had spoken concerning
me, and had signify'd to him, that there was a
very turbulent and impatient <HI>Frenchman</HI> in his <HI>La∣zaretto.</HI>
This Reprimand abated, instead of encrea∣sing,
my Fears, for the Inquisitor wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not have
spoken to the Prior, if he had intended to punish
my Boldness. However, this Accident shall teach
me Circumspection for the future; and may serve
<PB N="354" REF="201"/>
for a Warning to such of your Friends whose
Curiosity may incite 'em to visit this Place in
their Travels: For Strangers are in a more parti∣cular
manner expos'd to the Severities of that dread∣ful
Tribunal; and I'm persuaded that such indi∣screet
Expressions have oftentimes prov'd fatal to
Travellers.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT last I have obtain'd my Liberty, and have
bidden a joyful <HI>Farewel</HI> to that nasty <HI>Laza∣retto,</HI>
where I was forc'd to do so tedious a Pe∣nance
for my Sins. And since I have reason to
believe that all my Transgressions are blotted out
by so severe a Mortification, I'm e'en resolv'd to
venture upon a New Score: There is not a Town
in the World so full of Invitations as this: I see
every Day such charming and enflaming Objects
at the <HI>Opera, Ridotti,</HI> and whither so ever I go,
that a less sensible Heart than mine cou'd not long
resist the powerful Temptation. There is a greater
Number of lovely Women here than in any other
Place of <HI>Europe,</HI> and their Charms are more allu∣ring.
Three Divinities seem to contend which of
'em shou'd contribute most to the Embellishment
of a City where they have fix'd the Seats of their
several Empires. <HI>Venus</HI> makes it the Scene of all
<PB N="355" REF="201"/>
the soft Delights of Beauty and Love; <HI>Apollo</HI> dis∣plays
the ravishing Variety of his belov'd Harmo∣ny;
and <HI>Momus</HI> charms both the Eye and Ear
with splendid Masks and ingenious and witty Co∣medies.
<HI>Venice</HI> is a Cluster of inchanted Islands,
where Joy and Pleasure have establishd their peace∣ful
Sway, without the least Disturbance from tu∣multuary
or gloomy Passions. 'Tis all over charm∣ing;
every Object inspires Love, and fills the Mind
with a resistless and surprizing Delight. But I must
not forget that I write to one who is too inquisi∣tive
to be satisfy'd with general Hints; and there∣fore
I shall proceed to give you a particular Account
of this admirable City. I intended to have begun
my Letter with the Story of a pleasant Accident
that happen'd to one of my Friends at our coming
out of the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> where he perform'd his <HI>Qua∣rantain</HI>
with me; but tho' I am not often guilty
of a scrupulous Niceness in observing the Rules of
an exact Method, I'm loath on this Occasion to
invert the Order I intend to follow in the Descri∣ption
of the City; and therefore I shall defer the
Relation of my Friend's Adventure, till I come to
speak of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Curtezans.</P>
<P>The Observation I made concerning <HI>Constantino∣ple</HI>
and <HI>Cairo,</HI> may with equal Justice be apply'd
to <HI>Venice,</HI> and in the general to all great and po∣pulous
Cities; that there are very different Opini∣ons
concerning their Extent, and the Number of
their Inhabitants. Nor is this Controversie so ea∣sily
decided as some Persons imagine: For when
did ever a Traveller undertake to count the Streets
of a great City? Or what more can the most in∣quisitive
Stranger do than to measure the Dimen∣sions
of a Publick Place, or of a Temple? Judge then
whether any one can make a certain Computati∣on
of the Number of the Houses, or of the Per∣sons
that inhabit 'em. And I may venture to
<PB N="356" REF="202"/>
add, that none but a Soveraign is able to manage
such a Design; and that the exactest Calculations
that can be made by Private Persons, are mere
uncertain Conjectures, that can never be true but
by a lucky Hit, on which there can be no depen∣dance.
The same may be said of the Bigness of a
City, which ought rather to be computed from the
Figure, than from the Extent of its Circumfe∣rence:
And 'tis so difficult a Task to find and de∣scribe
the true Figure of a Town, that the Inha∣bitants
themselves are ignorant of it. How many
different Judgments are made of the comparative
Bigness of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Paris?</HI> Yet every Man
thinks his own Opinion true; and the same Re∣mark
may be apply'd to all other large Cities.
I will not undertake then to determine so intricate
a Controversie, but shall content my self with ac∣quainting
you, that <HI>Venice,</HI> as to its Extent, may,
in my Opinion, be compar'd to <HI>Rome,</HI> that the
Streets are Narrow, the Ground extremely well
Husbanded, and the Houses full of People to the
very Top. It has neither Gates, Walls, nor Cit∣tadel,
and yet cannot be justly said to be Weak.
'Tis esteem'd impregnable by many Authors, and
that Opinion is so generally receiv'd, that you
shall hardly hear any Man give an Account of
<HI>Venice</HI> without that Encomium at the End of it.
The <HI>Venetians</HI> themselves tell the Story so often,
that at last they imagine it to be a certain Truth,
and wou'd fain persuade others to be of the same
Opinion. But tho' they alledge some Reasons in
Confirmation of that Assertion, they must not
expect to make us swallow 'em by an implicit
Faith. At least I can assure you, their Arguments
have made no great Impression upon me; for I
cou'd never boast so strong a Faith as to give
Credit to an obvious Absurdity. However, Ex∣perience
has taught me so much Wisdom, that I
<PB N="357" REF="202"/>
shall hardly venture to own my Opinion in this
Case during my abode here. Let 'em magnifie
their City beyond all the Forts in the World,
and defie the Ambition of the most potent Sove∣reigns
in <HI>Europe;</HI> their Arrogance shall never ex∣tort
one indiscreet Word from me so long as I
remain within the reach of the Inquisition: But as
soon as I can set my Foot beyond the Limits of
their Dominions, I shall e'en make bold to talk
as freely to any Man of the boasted Strength of
their City, as I now intend to write to you.</P>
<P>You may remember I acknowledg'd that <HI>Venice</HI>
is impregnable on the Side next the Sea, and gave
you an Account of the Reasons which inclin'd me
to be of that Opinion. But I'm fully persuaded
that 'tis not impossible to attack it with Suc∣cess
on the other side, unless it be defended by an
Army strong enough to baffle all the Attempts of
the Besiegers, in which Case, I must confess, it
may be said to be impregnable; but upon the same
Supposition any Town in the World may plead a
Right to that Title: Whereas a Place that may
be properly call'd impregnable, must be strong e∣nough
to endure a Siege two or three Years with∣out
Relief; that is, it must be able to resist any
Enemy but Famine, which is a necessary Conse∣quence
of a long and close Siege. I confess there
are very few such Places in the World; yet I
have seen one, I mean <HI>Malta,</HI> and 'tis probable
there are some other Forts which merit the same
Character. As for those Places that may be subdu'd
by Force, tho' not without extreme Difficulty, they
may and ought to be call'd <HI>Strong,</HI> but cannot just∣ly
be said to be <HI>Impregnable.</HI> Yet the last of these
Epithets is very frequently abus'd and misapply'd;
for 'tis as usual to honour a Place with that Title,
as 'tis rare to find one that deserves it.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="203"/>
If this be the true meaning of the controvert∣ed
Term, and if none but such Places as these
can be properly said to be impregnable, as 'tis plain
they cannot; I know no reason that shou'd hin∣der
me from excluding <HI>Venice</HI> out of that Number.
It seems to be no very difficult Undertaking to
seize on the <HI>Lido</HI> and <HI>Malamoca,</HI> two inhabited
Islands, and by securing those Posts, to intercept
the Communication of the City with the Sea,
and to cut off all Relief that might be expected
that way. An Army might also soon take Pos∣session
of several little uninhabited <HI>Lagunes</HI> about
<HI>Venice,</HI> from whence the City might be easily bat∣ter'd
and bombarded; and God knows what Ha∣vock
the Bombs wou'd make in so compact a Ci∣ty
as this. And besides, the Multitude of the In∣habitants
wou'd quickly expose 'em to all the De∣solations
that are usually caus'd by Famine. I
confess the Arsenal is so well furnish'd that all the
Burghers might be arm'd in Four and twenty
Hours; but what use cou'd they make of their
Arms in a Town which in case of a Siege wou'd
instantly be turn'd to a Prison: For there is no
cover'd Way thro' which they cou'd sally out upon
their Enemies; and tho' they cou'd contrive one, the
Citizens of <HI>Venice</HI> wou'd make but a very feeble
resistance. I have so mean an Opinion of their
Military accomplishments, that I dare boldly af∣firm
that Ten thousand well-discipln'd Soldiers
wou'd do more execution than a Hundred thou∣sand
of 'em. Was not <HI>Paris</HI> starv'd by 30000 Men,
tho' at the same time it was defended by 150000
Citizens, who might have sally'd out when they
pleas'd? What then wou'd become of <HI>Venice</HI> in
such a Case, where the besieg'd must be coop'd up
in their Houses, and cou'd never make a Sally to di∣sturb
or annoy their Enemies? Perhaps I shall be
laugh'd at for maintaining that this wonderful
<PB N="359" REF="203"/>
Place that dispises and defies the most potent and
triumphant Enemies, might be enter'd and set on
Fire by a sufficient Number of Men with Tor∣ches
in their Hands, without the Trouble or
Charge of Bombardment. But I wou'd willingly
be inform'd what cou'd hinder 100000 Men from
making and executing such an Attempt. There
are no Walls to stop or retard their Progress; the
City is open in Fourscore several Places, all the
Houses that surround it are pierc'd with Doors
and Shops, and many of 'em are built of Wood.
I confess such an Expedition wou'd require a vast
Number of Boats; but when I speak of 100000
Men, I do not mean that they shou'd all be em∣ploy'd
in the Attempt: The Fifth part of 'em
wou'd serve to carry on the Attack; and the Be∣siegers
might find a sufficient Number of Boats in
the adjacent Harbours, without giving themselves
the trouble of making new ones.</P>
<P>My Opinion in this Case is so singular, and so
directly opposite to the Notions that are enter∣tain'd
by the generality of Mankind, that you will
doubtless scruple to give Credit to my single Te∣stimony,
especially since the Arguments I bring to
confirm it depend on certain Circumstances with
which you never had occasion to be acquainted.
And you will be apt to tell me, that the <HI>Veneti∣ans</HI>
wou'd certainly have taken care to fortifie
their Capital City, if its Natural Strength were
not incapable of any Artificial Improvements. In
answer to the first part of this Difficulty, I shall
only repeat what I have already told you, that
'twas never my Custom to make my Judgment
a Slave to Authority, or to regulate my own, by
the Opinions of others. I'm persuaded that a blind
Submission to Vulgar Notions, is one of the most
fertil Sources of Error, and that there is nothing
<PB N="360" REF="204"/>
so variable and uncertain, as the Sentiments of
Men in different Places and Ages.</P>
<P>I confess the other part of the Objection con∣tains
a greater and more puzzling Difficulty. But
tho' the Conduct of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate in this
Case seems at first View to depend upon some
secret Reasons of State, the Mystery lies not so
deep but that it may be easily unriddl'd by a mo∣derate
Degree of Application. You know that the
Government of <HI>Venice</HI> is purely <HI>Aristocratical,</HI> and
that the Revolutions which happen in such Con∣stitutions,
are usually occasion'd by suffering one
of the Members of the Body in which the Go∣vernment
is lodg'd, to over-top the rest: For an
Ambitious Person may be easily tempted by so
inviting an Opportunity, to establish the Gran∣deur
of his Family by oppressing his Fellow-Ci∣tizens,
and to erect a Monarchy upon the Ruines
of the Republick. History and Experience furnish
us with so many Instances of such Revolutions,
and these Examples are so universally known, that
'twou'd be needless either to cite 'em, or to alledge any
other Arguments to prove so well-attested a Truth.
Now the Senate of <HI>Venice,</HI> whose Maxims are,
without Controversie, grounded on the most re∣fin'd
Politicks, making a wise use of the Misfor∣tunes
of other States, and being well acquainted
with the weak part of their own, have endea∣vour'd
to prevent the Inconveniences that might
arise from that necessary Flaw in their Consti∣tution,
by the most prudent Laws and Proviso's
that ever were invented; and their Care for the
Preservation of the State has been attended with
such excellent Success, that the Republic conti∣nues
still to subsist on the same Foundations on
which 'twas first establish'd. To give you a Spe∣cimen
of the admirable Politicks of that wise Bo∣dy,
I shall briefly take notice of some of those
<PB N="361" REF="204"/>
Laws and Customs that are interwoven with the
Constitution of their Government. The <HI>Doge</HI> is
entrusted with so small a Share in the Management
of the State, that he may be justly call'd a meer
Shadow of Grandeur. There are Inquisitors ap∣pointed
to have an Eye upon his Actions, who may
call him to an Account when they please. He is not
allow'd the Liberty of public and familiar Con∣versation,
nor suffer'd to appear in the City but
on certain Days of Ceremony. The Nobles are
forbidden to entertain any correspondence with
Foreign Princes, or their Ministers. They are not
permitted to wear Arms, to use any Ornaments of
Gold or Silver, to keep a numerous Train of Ser∣vants,
or to affect any Marks of Grandeur. The
Custom of walking in the <HI>Broglio</HI> was introduc'd
to prevent the dangerous Consequences of pri∣vate
Cabals. The Inquisitors of State were esta∣blish'd
for the Security of the Government; and
'tis the same Consideration that moves 'em to
entertain above a Thousand Spies. And to con∣clude,
that illustrious Body in which the Go∣vernment
is lodg'd, the celebrated <HI>Senate of Venice,</HI>
which knows so well how to maintain its Ho∣nour
on other Occasions, keeps neither Guards a∣bout
the Place of its meeting, nor a Garrison in
the Town; wisely considering, that if ever an In∣surrection
shou'd happen, those Mercenary Soldiers,
however appointed for the Defence and Preser∣vation
of the State, wou'd be made the Instru∣ments
of its Ruine.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with a particular Ac∣count
of all the Laws and Regulations that were
instituted for the same end, and are still observ'd
in this place. But from what has been said on
this Subject, you may easily perceive that those
prudent Senatours make it their principal Care to
prevent Intestine Disorders, and to render the
<PB N="362" REF="205"/>
Nobles incapable of invading the Public Li∣berty.</P>
<P>Now if the Senate shou'd order a Citadel or
Fort to be built at <HI>Venice,</HI> they might with Ju∣stice
be accus'd of contriving the Instruments of
their own Ruine, and of undermining that No∣ble
Fabric, which they have taken so great Care
to secure. But they are too wise to be guilty of
so fatal a Blunder; and 'tis better to be in some
measure expos'd to the Insults of Foreign Inva∣ders,
than to lie at the Mercy of Domestic Ene∣mies.
Besides they have no Reason to be afraid
of their Neighbours; for 'tis the Interest of all the
Princes and States of <HI>Italy,</HI> to preserve the Repub∣lic,
that it may continue to be the Bulwark of
<HI>Christendom</HI> on that side, and to counter-balance the
Power of the House of <HI>Austria.</HI> And as for the
<HI>Turks,</HI> they are at too great a Distance to un∣dertake
an Expedition against the City.</P>
<P>Thus you see that there are several weighty
Considerations that deter the Senate from forti∣fying
their Capital City: and there are no less
pressing Reasons that oblige 'em to encourage
the Vulgar Opinion of its pretended Impregna∣bility.</P>
<P>If I shou'd send you a particular Description
of this City, I cou'd only entertain you with a
Repetition of what you have read perhaps in a hun∣dred
Authors. And therefore I shall content my
self with communicating some of my Remarks to
you, in a loose and familiar manner.</P>
<P>Some pretend that <HI>Venice</HI> is built on seventy
two Islands or <HI>Lagunes,</HI> which are separated by
such narrow Chanels that they seem to form
one little Continent: and there are others who re∣ject
this Opinion. I will not undertake to de∣cide
the Controversie, but only tell you what I
have seen, and leave the whole Matter to your
<PB N="363" REF="205"/>
Judgment. 'Tis certain that <HI>Venice</HI> is founded on
a Spot of Ground that rises at least to the Surface
of the Water; for the Earth appears in the Streets,
Keys, public Places, and Houses. 'Tis true they
are forc'd to make use of Piles, because the Ground
is not firm enough to support the Weight of a large
Palace without sinking: but that ought not to
make us doubt the Truth of a thing that is con∣firm'd
by the Testimony of our own Eyes; for
the same way of Building is generally us'd in all
Moorish or Fenny Places, and particularly in <HI>Hol∣land.</HI>
'Tis no less certain that this Spot of Ground
is at present a Mass of Islands, so that it remains
only to consider whether the Canals that sepa∣rate
these little Islands be Natural or Artificial.
This Question is not easily to be determin'd, for
one may alledge very plausible Arguments either
for the Affirmative or Negative part. 'Tis pro∣bable
the <HI>Venetians</HI> might dig these Chanels, for
the more convenient Carriage of Goods, which by
this means are brought to their Doors, and for
the Embellishment of the City, which is the on∣ly
Town in the World that can boast of such a
Situation. But there are so many, and so consi∣derable
Reasons, which favour the contrary Opi∣nion,
that I'm almost entirely convinc'd of the
Truth of it. In the first place, 'Tis plain that the
<HI>Venetians</HI> have taken all possible Care to husband
the Ground on which the City is founded. The
Streets are so narrow, that in most of 'em three
Men cannot walk a-breast, and in some, one Man
can hardly pass by another. And the Foundati∣ons
of the Houses on one side are laid in the
Water, without any Key or Passage betwixt 'em
and the Canals. We cannot then suppose, with
the least Shadow of Probability, that the Prospect
of any Conveniency cou'd oblige 'em to waste
so considerable a quantity of that Ground which
<PB N="364" REF="206"/>
they manage so thriftily, that the City is every∣where
full of Boundaries, to restrain the Proprietors
of the Houses from breaking in upon the
Streets. And besides, what Reason can there be
alledg'd for their leaving so many large Spots of
Ground entire; for tho' you are inform'd that a
Man may go in a Boat to any House in the
City, you must not take these Words in a strict
and literal Sense, but only as a figurative Expres∣sion,
to signifie that there are a great Number of
such Houses in <HI>Venice.</HI> I can assure you that
there is not a Canal within five hundred Paces
round of the House where I lodge; and that
there are twenty such Places in the City. I shall
only add that the Canals are crooked, and ge∣nerally
unequal both in Length and Breadth;
which, in my Opinion, may serve to convince
any considering Person, that they are not Arti∣ficial.</P>
<P>All the Streets in the City, without Exception,
are narrow and crooked; but to make amends
for these Disadvantages, they are so clean that one
may walk a Year in 'em without meeting with
any Dirt: and besides they are pav'd with large
square Stones, which always after a Shower grow
as white as Marble. In several parts of the City
there are little empty places call'd <HI>Campi</HI> or Fields;
which were probably left for the Conveniency of
intrenching, if an Enemy shou'd enter the Town;
for they are not at all Ornamental. The only
considerable Place or Field in <HI>Venice,</HI> is that of S.
<HI>Mark,</HI> which certainly claims all our Admirati∣on.
'Tis two hundred and fifty Paces long, and
eighty broad. The Church of S. <HI>Mark</HI> faces one
of the Ends of it, and that of S. <HI>Geminian</HI> the
other. 'Tis border'd on each side with those state∣ly
Piles of Building call'd the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>aties,</HI>
which make it, without Controversie, the
<PB N="365" REF="206"/>
most Magnificent Place in the World. The
Front of each Procuraty is supported by a large
Portico, ten Paces broad; and all along
there are double Piazza's, one of which entering
into the Building serves for Shops, which are lett
by the <HI>Signiory</HI> to those who sell Perfumes, Li∣monade,
and Coffee. The Procurators of S. <HI>Mark</HI>
lodge in these Palaces, which for that Reason are
call'd the <HI>Procuraties:</HI> but when any Foreign Prince
comes to take a View of 'em, or on some other
Occasions of Public Rejoicing, the Partitions are
taken down, so that one may walk from one
End to the other, and all the several Apartments
are united into one spacious House. That on the
Right-hand, as you go to S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Church, is
call'd the <HI>New,</HI> and that on the Left the <HI>Old
Procuraty.</HI> The first has two principal Fronts, one
of which looks into the Place of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> and
the other into the <HI>Broglio,</HI> over-against the Palace
of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> which is an Ancient and Magnifi∣cent
Structure, where all the Councils meet; such
as the <HI>Grand Council,</HI> the <HI>Council of the Finances</HI> call'd
the <HI>Ceca,</HI> the <HI>Marine Council,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Ceca</HI> is a
distinct Apartment in the Palace of S. <HI>Mark;</HI>
and tho' 'tis built after the same Manner, and
with the same Stones, the large Grates and dou∣ble
Doors of Iron, with which 'tis inclos'd, make
it resemble a Prison rather than a Palace: And
besides the Smoak that arises from the Furna∣ces
has so penetrated the Stone-Walls, that they are
black even within the Chambers. Here the Mo∣ney
is coin'd, and the Public Treasure kept in
great Iron Chests, secur'd with three Locks, the Keys
of which are committed to the Custody of three
Procurators, who, under Pain of Death, dare not
make the least Attempt to open 'em till they are
all met together. The Council sits twice a Week,
<PB N="366" REF="207"/>
which are the only Days for all sorts of Pay∣ments.</P>
<P>The little <HI>Arsenal</HI> of the Nobles, whose Arms
are always kept ready charg'd, is in the same
Palace of S. <HI>Mark;</HI> and the <HI>Doge</HI>'s Apartment is
in the Right-Wing, from whence there is a Pas∣sage
to the Church, whither he goes sometimes
<HI>incognito</HI> to hear Mass; but usually he per∣forms
his Devotions at a private Chapel in his own
Apartment.</P>
<P>S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Church is a large Structure, square on
the Out-side, cover'd with four Leaden Domes,
of which the largest is in the Middle, without
any Spires or Steeples. The Top is surrounded
with Stone Balisters for the Conveniency of walk∣ing.
You enter the Church thro' a Portico com∣pos'd
of five Arches, the highest of which is in
the Middle. There you may take a View of
those Large and Stately Gates of Brass, which the
<HI>Venetians</HI> brought from <HI>Santa Sophia</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
when they robb'd that City of so many valuable
Curiosities to enrich their own. Among the rest, I
cannot forbear taking Notice of the four Brazen
Horses that are plac'd upon the same Portico. 'Tis Pity
they are not more carefully preserv'd; for they are
so finely shap'd, that Nature her self cou'd not
mend those Artificial Animals. 'Tis true, they
have endeavour'd to piece 'em, but all their Care
and Skill will never be able to restore 'em to their
primitive Beauty.</P>
<P>The Figure of the Church within resembles a
Cross, the Quire representing the upper part. 'Tis
vaulted throughout, and enrich'd with very fine
<HI>Mosaic</HI>-Work, like that of <HI>Santa Sophia,</HI> but not
near so lasting: for it decays so fast, that they are
forc'd to keep some Workmen on purpose to re∣pair
it; whereas the other remains entire notwith∣standing
its great Antiquity. And besides there is
<PB N="367" REF="207"/>
another Difference betwixt the <HI>Mosaic</HI>-Work at <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI>
and that at <HI>Santa Sophia;</HI> for the latter is
smooth and plain, whereas the former is full of Fi∣gures.
These are the only Pieces of this Nature I
have had occasion to see in my Travels, ex∣cept
one at <HI>Scio.</HI> The Floor of the Church is
adorn'd with another sort of <HI>Mosaic</HI> no less preci∣ous
than the former, consisting of several small
Pieces of Porphyrie, Jasper, and Serpentine or
speckl'd Marble, not unlike to the Tables and Ca∣binets
of Ebony, that are inlaid with Shells and
Naker.</P>
<P>The Arms of all the <HI>Doges</HI> that have hitherto
govern'd the Republic are plac'd round the Walls.
They are generally magnificent, and even some of
'em are of Silver curiously wrought. The only Fault
I can find in this Church is its Obscurity, which
hides the greatest part of its Beauties: For in all
other respects 'tis enrich'd with the finest Orna∣ments,
such as Altars, Pictures, and Vessels of Gold
and Silver. 'Twou'd be needless to present you
with a Catalogue of the rare Curiosities that are to
be seen either in the Church or Treasury, since
you will find 'em all particularly describ'd in a
Treatise written by <HI>Monsieur de S. Didier.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis Pity the <HI>Venetians</HI> shou'd have lost the Body
of their good Patron, S. <HI>Mark,</HI> and that their Loss
shou'd be attended with this mortifying Circum∣stance,
that they know neither the Time nor Oc∣casion
of it. 'Tis true the common People believe
that he retir'd into a Pillar, which they shew'd
me, and that he thrust his Hand out of that Co∣lumn
when he gave the Ring to the <HI>Doge;</HI> but
most of 'em scruple not to confess that they know
not where he is, nor whither he went.</P>
<P>They made me also take Notice of a Stone,
which they pretend is the same that yielded Water
to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> when they were tormented with
<PB N="368" REF="208"/>
Thirst in the Wilderness. If this be true, we must
allow that Rock a Power to multiply its Kind; for
'tis still to be seen in the Desarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> be∣tween
<HI>Sues</HI> and <HI>Tor,</HI> as I have heard several credible
Persons affirm, as well <HI>Christians,</HI> as <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI>
who assure me that it stands by it self in the
midst of a Sandy Desart; and that one may both
easily perceive the Holes that gave a Passage to the
Water, and discern the very Track or Print that
was made by the Stream.</P>
<P>The next place in <HI>Venice</HI> that claims a particular
Observation, is the <HI>Arsenal,</HI> which is certainly the best
furnish'd Magazine in the World. For tho' it
contains no less than two Miles in Compass, 'tis
fill'd and even crowded with Cannons, Bombs,
Granadoes, Muskets, Sabres, Gun-powder, Ropes,
Sails, Anchors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To give you an Estimate of
the prodigious Quantity of Ammunition that is
hoarded up in this Place, 'twill be sufficient to
tell you, that in case of Necessity, 'tis sufficient
to arm and equip fifteen Galleys, four Galeasses,
as many Ships, and a hundred thousand Men. The
<HI>Arsenal</HI> is govern'd by three Nobles, and under
them by the Pilot of the Republic, whom they
call the Admiral, who is entrusted with the Care
and Inspection both of the Stores, and of two or
three hundred Men, that are constantly kept at
Work. He never goes to Sea but once a Year,
to steer the <HI>Bucentaur</HI> on <HI>Ascension-Day,</HI> when the
Duke accompany'd by all the Nobles, performs
the Ceremony of Wedding the Sea. They set so
high a Value upon this Vessel, that the Pilot is
oblig'd under Pain of Death to bring it back in
Safety; which makes him so cautious in observing
the Weather, that when he perceives any Clouds,
or the least Appearance of a Wind on the Day ap∣pointed
for the Solemnity, he procures it to be de∣lay'd
till the next <HI>Sunday.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="208"/>
'Tis the Opinion of one, That <HI>Venice</HI> contains
Four hundred Palaces, fit to receive and entertain a
King. This is certainly a very bold Assertion; and
yet I dare not positively contradict it: for the Pa∣laces
are so Numerous and Magnificent, that I
may venture, without a <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> to affirm that
they are sufficient to adorn Ten Cities. On the
great Canal alone there are at least Two hundred,
which seem to out-rival one another, whether you
consider the Boldness of the Design, or the Fine∣ness
of the Structure; and confound the amaz'd
Spectatour with so vast a Medley of different Beau∣ties,
that he knows not which to prefer, or
where to point at the Principal Object of his
Admiration. If your Curiosity shou'd lead you
out of the City, to take a View of the neigh∣bouring
Continent, especially towards <HI>Padua,</HI> you
wou'd be tempted to fansie your self among the
Habitations of the Gods; for every Palace resem∣bles
a Magnificent Temple, adorn'd with all the most
exquisite Beauties of Architecture. It must be ac∣knowledg'd
that the <HI>Italians,</HI> and particularly the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> are the best Architects in the World;
and that the finest Houses in <HI>France</HI> are not
comparable to these Palaces on the Outside.</P>
<P>I shall take this Occasion to give you a gene∣ral
Idea of their Manner of Building. The Height
of the Edifice is exactly proportion'd to its Big∣ness,
according to the nicest Rules of Architecture.
The Houses are cover'd with fine Platforms, where
a Man may enjoy the Pleasure of walking with∣out
going out of his own House; and when he grows
weary may either sit down on the Benches, or rest
on the Balisters that surround the Platform. The
Fronts of the Houses are adorn'd with Portico's, Co∣lumns,
Balconies at the Windows, Frizes, Festoons,
Niches, and Statues. These Ornaments are accom∣pany'd
with Courts, Anti-Courts, delicious Gardens,
<PB N="370" REF="209"/>
Fountains, Grotto's, and all the other Embellish∣ments
that a luxurious Fancy can contrive. I can
assure you that this is a true and faithful Re∣presentation
of these glorious Edifices; and I leave
you to judge whether they may not justly be
call'd Palaces, and whether any thing cou'd give a
higher Idea of the Grandeur of the <HI>Venetian</HI> No∣bles.
The main Reason, in my Opinion, that
makes 'em employ so great a part of their Treasure
in Building, is because they are not permitted to
display their Magnificence any other way. For
since they are not suffer'd to consume their Mo∣ney
in splendid Equipages, and rich Habits, 'tis
plain they must either build, or find some other
way to bestow their superfluous Cash. And, 'tis
probably the same Restraint that tempts 'em to
throw away such vast quantities of Money on
Courtezans and at Play. You wou'd hardly be∣lieve
me, if I shou'd tell you what prodigious Summs
are consum'd every Year at <HI>Bassette,</HI> especially du∣ring
the <HI>Carnaval;</HI> when the <HI>Ridotti</HI> or Gaming-Houses
are open. None are admitted into these
Houses without Masks; that all sorts of People
may enjoy an equal Liberty, and that there may
be no Occasion for Disputes, nor any Marks of
Distinction in a place where every one is welcome
for his Money, and where there is always a con∣fus'd
Medley of Noblemen, Citizens, Ladies, and
Courtezans: Yet this Order is not observ'd with
the utmost Rigour; for one that has a false Nose,
or counterfeit Whiskers is held to be sufficiently
Mask'd. The Nobles keep the Bank, and relieve
one another by turns from Morning till Night.
They bear good or bad Fortune without discover∣ing
the least Alteration either in their Counte∣nance
or Humour: and seem as little concern'd
when they lose a Thousand <HI>Sequins</HI> by one Card,
as when they gain One by another. I have
<PB N="371" REF="209"/>
had Occasion two or three times to see the Bank
broke, but cou'd never perceive the least Sign of
Disturbance in the unfortunate Gamester. And
which is no less surprizing, I have seen other No∣blemen
continue to play with the Loser, upon his
bare Word, to the Value of Ten thousand Ducats,
which were always punctually paid next Morning.
'Tis true, the Loss does not fall wholly upon one
Person, for there are sometimes a Hundred of 'em
join'd together; and this is perhaps the main Rea∣son
that makes 'em bear their Misfortunes so pa∣tiently.
Besides the Bank is seldom a Loser at
the last; and the <HI>Ridotti</HI> are sometimes so full of
Money, that they know not where to keep it.
All the Cash is entrusted to the Care of some
Nobleman, who is usually one of the poorer Sort;
and yet 'tis never observ'd that he retains so much
as one Peny.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Remember I told you, that the Order of <HI>Mal∣ta</HI>
might be divided into four Classes; and I
shall begin this Letter with applying the same Ob∣servation
to the Noblemen of <HI>Venice:</HI> for tho' all
who bear that Name are united into one Body,
their Families are not equally Illustrious. The first
<HI>Classis</HI> or Rank, consists of those Families who foun∣ded
the Republic, and were Noble before that
time. The second comprehends those who were
elected before the Shutting up of the Council,
which was call'd, <HI>Il Serrar del Consiglio.</HI> The third
contains those who obtain'd that Honour as a Re∣compence
for some eminent Services done to the
State; and are therefore call'd Gentlemen by Me∣rit.
And the fourth is made up of <HI>Nobili per Soldi,</HI>
or <HI>Gentlemen by Purchase,</HI> who bought the Title. But
notwithstanding so considerable a Difference in their
Pedigrees, they have all an equal Right to give
their Voices, and enjoy the same Privileges: All,
from the Highest to the Lowest, go to the Great
Council, and are honour'd with the Title of <HI>Excel∣lency.</HI>
And even it happens not unfrequently that
the most Illustrious Members of that Body are not
most respected: for oftentimes a Gentleman of
three Days standing is advanc'd to the Dignity of
a <HI>Procurator,</HI> while the Ancient Families, and those
that gave a Being to the Republic, are in a mi∣serable
Condition. Here, as well as every where
else, 'tis the Custom to worship the Rising Sun, and
to court those who seem to be the Darlings of For∣tune:
The Richest are always esteem'd the Greatest
<PB N="373" REF="210"/>
Lords, and stand fairest for Preferment. However
since all Elections are decided by Plurality of Voi∣ces
in the Grand Council, the poorer Sort of Gen∣tlemen
are treated with more Complaisance than
they cou'd expect, if they had not a Right to
Vote on such Occasions; since it may sometimes be
in their Power to dispose of the Procuratorship,
and even of the Ducal Coronet. This puts me
in mind of a Story, which perhaps will divert
you; you must take it on the Credit of its Authors.
There was, say the <HI>Venetians,</HI> a certain poor Gen∣tleman,
who had Occasion to take a Journey into
the Country: Before his Departure he went to a
Great Lord, who was his Neighbour, and intreat∣ed
him to lend him a Cloak; but had the Mor∣tification
to receive a flat Denyal, and was forc'd to
have Recourse to another. Not long after the <HI>Doge</HI>
di'd, and the rich Nobleman had so great an Inte∣rest
in the Council, that when they proceeded to
Balloting, he wanted but one Voice to be chosen.
In the mean time the poor Gentleman happen'd to
come in, and was immediately accosted by his
wealthy Neighbour, who, with all imaginable
Submission and Respect, begg'd his Voice; and
assur'd him, that he wou'd always look upon him
as the Author of his Fortune. But the Gentleman
remembring his late Incivility, reply'd in an
angry and disdainful manner, <HI>No, my Lord, you must
e'en resolve to go without a Coronet, as you made me
go without a Cloak.</HI> The Consideration of the fre∣quent
Occasions they have to make use of the Assi∣stance
of the rest of their Body, makes 'em treat
one another with a great deal of <HI>Civility,</HI> if I
may be allow'd to use so weak an Expression to
signifie the Compliments and Ceremonious Nice∣ties
of their Salutations, which are so extravagant,
that in any other Country they wou'd be esteem'd
Ridiculous. 'Tis pleasant to observe how they
<PB N="374" REF="211"/>
court one another when they meet on the <HI>Brog∣lio:</HI>
I have often seen Noblemen who stood Can∣didates
for the highest Preferments, prostrate them∣selves
before a poor Gentleman whose Vest was
not worth a Groat, as if he had been a King,
or somewhat more than Humane. The <HI>Venetian</HI>
Salutations are quite different from Ours; they
perform 'em slowly, to express the Modesty and
Humility of their Respect, and bowing their Heads
to their very Knees, continue sometimes for the
Space of a Minute in that Posture, offering their
Service in the most submissive Expressions; after
which they raise their Bodies, and immediately
begin again, repeating the same Ceremony two
or three times. And they are so nicely scrupu∣lous
in such Cases, that if any Nobleman shou'd
venture to shorten his Reverences, or to imitate
the <HI>French</HI> Air in the least, he wou'd be rec∣kon'd
a base Man, who had lost all Sense of
Honour.</P>
<P>When a Stranger comes to serve in the <HI>Venetian</HI>
Army, he must immediately learn their Fashions,
as the only way to avoid their Hatred, and to
raise his own Fortune; tho' it must be acknow∣ledg'd
these fawning Ceremonies are extremely
troublesome and uneasie. I had occasion t'other
Day to see the Entry of a Procurator, and took
notice of some Colonels and other Officers who
march'd before the Senate to the Church, where
they stopt within the Door, and saluted every
Nobleman as he pass'd by, with a Reverence,
such as I describ'd before; so that for a large
Quarter of an Hour they were perpetually em∣ploy'd
in that troublesome Task. But besides those
profound Reverences, there are a Thousand other
Niceties, and nauseous Flatteries, which are the
necessary Consequences of their Excessive Civili∣ty.
You must weigh every Expression you use
<PB N="375" REF="211"/>
either in Letters or Discourse; for 'tis not enough
to avoid the Word <HI>Voi</HI> or <HI>You,</HI> which wou'd be
reckon'd a Downright Affront, and to use al∣ways
the Third Person <HI>Lei,</HI> or <HI>Ella,</HI> but you must
take care to repeat the most submissive Phrases,
such as <HI>If it please my Patron, If my Patron vouchsafe
to command me,</HI> &amp;c. You must still say, <HI>My Patron</HI>
said or did such a thing; and whatever Epithet
you bestow upon him, you must never forget to
add <HI>issimo</HI> to the End of it; for 'twou'd be rec∣kon'd
a poor Compliment to call a Man <HI>Nobile,
Docto,</HI> or <HI>Galanto,</HI> instead of which you must say
he is <HI>Nobilissimo, Doctissimo,</HI> and <HI>Galantissimo.</HI> The
same, or rather greater Ceremonies, are observ'd
in <HI>Writing;</HI> I remember I have seen some Letters
from the Captain Generals <HI>Cornaro</HI> and <HI>Mocenigo</HI> to
a <HI>Greek Merchant,</HI> in which they gave him the Ti∣tle
of <HI>Molto Illustre Signor.</HI> Four Fingers breadth
lower the Letter began thus, <HI>Ho ricevuto de vostra
Signoria molto Illustre,</HI> &amp;c. and the rest was all of
a Piece: At the End of the Letter were these
Words, <HI>de vostra Signoria molto illustre, devotissimo
Servitore;</HI> then a Space of Six Fingers breadth,
and the Subscription at the Bottom. I was ex∣tremely
surpriz'd at the Extravagancy of these
Compliments, when I consider'd the Quality of
the Writers, and of him to whom the Letters
were directed; and I leave you to judge what
Ceremonies must be observ'd between Equals. A
Letter to a Nobleman must be directed thus,
<HI>Al' Illustrissimo &amp; Excellentissimo Signor, &amp; mio Padrone
Colendissimo, il Signor,</HI> &amp;c. and the Body of the Let∣ter
must be sutable to the flattering Superscripti∣on.
You must take care to give every Man the
Titles that are appropriated to Persons of his Rank
and Quality: Thus when you speak to a <HI>Trades∣man,</HI>
you must call him <HI>Signor Pietro,</HI> or <HI>Signor
Paolo;</HI> to a <HI>Citizen</HI> or <HI>Merchant</HI> you must say <HI>Vostra
<PB N="376" REF="212"/>
Signoria,</HI> and, in Letters, <HI>Vostra Signoria molto Illu∣stre.</HI>
A <HI>Counsellor, Physician, Notary,</HI> or a <HI>Gentleman</HI>
who is a <HI>Subject</HI> is styl'd <HI>la Signoria Illustrissima;</HI>
The proper Title of the <HI>Nobles</HI> is <HI>l' Excellenza;</HI>
and the <HI>Doge</HI> is usually call'd <HI>la Serenita,</HI> or <HI>il
Serenissimo;</HI> for they rarely say <HI>il Dogio.</HI> But when
they say <HI>il Principe,</HI> they always mean the <HI>Re∣public.</HI>
Thus all Orders and Proclamations begin
thus, <HI>Il Serenissimo Principe fa sapere; The most Serene
Prince declares, or gives Notice:</HI> And tis usually said
in familiar Discourse, <HI>Il Principe ha prohibito le Pom∣pe;
The Prince has prohibited the wearing of Costly Appa∣rel,</HI>
&amp;c. Thus they speak when they do not so
much as think of the <HI>Doge,</HI> who has no more
Power to make such Regulations, than the mean∣est
Officer that belongs to the Republic; and far
from being a Soveraign, he is so much a Sub∣ject,
that he dares hardly move one Inch with∣out
Orders. <HI>Francis Morosini,</HI> the present <HI>Doge,</HI>
was elected to that Dignity in <HI>April</HI> 1688, while
he was obtaining Victories for the Republick abroad.
And yet as told and infirmas he is, he was forc'd to
continue in that fatiguing Employment, and at last,
with much ado, and after a whole Year spent
in humble and earnest Solicitations, he obtain'd
leave to quit the Service, and return'd to <HI>Venice</HI>
last Year. He is the first <HI>Doge</HI> that ever enter'd
the City with the Ducal Coronet on his Head:
Nor cou'd the Senate refuse to grant some unu∣sual
Mark of Honour to the Conqueror of all
<HI>Morea.</HI> However, I'm strongly inclin'd to suspect
that the main Consideration which made him so
uneasie till he had obtain'd a Permission to leave
the Army, was his Fear of losing the Glory he
had acquir'd. And you will be of the same O∣pinion
if you consider the ill Success of his At∣tempt
upon <HI>Negropont;</HI> and the slow Progress he
made in the Siege of <HI>Napoli di Malvasia,</HI> which
<PB N="377" REF="212"/>
held out two Years against him, and was still in
so good a Condition at his Departure, that there
was little or no hope of reducing it; tho' for want
of Provisions the Garrison was oblig'd to surren∣der
the Place to the General during the last
Campaign.</P>
<P>The length of this Siege puts me in mind of
<HI>Candy,</HI> which for so long a time was attack'd and
defended with equal Obstinacy and Vigour. 'Twas
the same <HI>Morosini</HI> who commanded in the Place,
and the Senate being unwilling to waste so much
Blood and Treasure in the Defence of a Place
which, after all, they cou'd not hope to preserve,
sent him positive Orders to Capitulate. But he
was so desirous of Glory, and had so mean an
Opinion of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Valour, that he assur'd
the Senate, if they wou'd continue to supply
him with necessary Provisions, he wou'd either
save the Place, or bury himself under its Ruines.
Yet, for all his bravery, he was forc'd to submit
to the Chance of War, without performing ei∣ther
part of his Promise: And at his return to
<HI>Venice</HI> he had the mortification to meet with a ve∣ry
bad Reception on the <HI>Broglio.</HI> Some of the No∣bles
were so incens'd against him, that they dis∣cover'd
their Spite by abusing him to his Face,
asking by way of Derision, <HI>Ha! is not this</HI> Moro∣sini;
while others reply'd with equal Bitterness
and Contempt, <HI>No, no, that can't be the Man who
promis'd to bury himself under the Ruines of</HI> Candy, <HI>if
he shou'd find himself unable to preserve it.</HI> But the Ma∣lice
of his Enemies did not evaporate in Jests,
they were not satisfy'd with so poor a Revenge,
but prosecuted him so warmly, that his Head was
in a tottering Condition. One of 'em represent∣ed
his Crime to the Council, and in a vehement
and pathetic Discourse, accus'd him of abusing the
Senate, by promising such things as he cou'd not
<PB N="378" REF="213"/>
perform, and of engaging the Republick in a pro∣digious
Charge, which might have been better
employ'd another way. Nor was this the single
Opinion of one Person, for several others voted
him guilty: Yet his good Fortune deliver'd him
from so great a Danger, and has now set the Co∣ronet
on his Head; he is somewhat lean, and of
a middle Stature; his Hair and Beard are white;
he wears Whiskers, and a little Tuft of Hair up∣on
his Chin. I saw him at the Entry of his
Kinsman the Procurator <HI>Morosini;</HI> and since I have
occasion again to speak of that Solemnity, which
I only mention'd before, I shall now give you a
particular Account of it: But before I describe
the Order of the Cavalcade, it will not be im∣proper
to acquaint you with the Preparations
that were made in the Church of S. <HI>Mark.</HI></P>
<P>From the Door of the Nave or Body of the
Church to that of the Quire, there was a Lane
border'd with Rows of Benches, thro' which the
<HI>Doge</HI> and Procurators were to pass; and both the
Floor and Benches were cover'd with <HI>Turkish Tapestry.</HI>
The Quire was also full of Benches, without any
Difference or Mark of Distinction; only the <HI>Doge</HI>'s
Place was cover'd with red Velvet; and besides,
there was a Cushion of the same Velvet at his
Feet, and another on the Place where he lean'd
at Prayer. The Altar was embellish'd with the
richest Jewels, Relicks, Candlesticks, and other Or∣naments;
and the Patiarch's great Vicar waited
in his Seat for the <HI>Doge</HI>'s coming. He wore a
Chasuble embroider'd with Pearls, worth above
6000 <HI>Ducats;</HI> and the Hangings of the Altar
were no less rich.</P>
<P>The Church being thus prepar'd, the Signiory
or Noblemen began their Cavalcade from the Hall
of the Great Council in S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Palace, where
they were assembl'd to assist at the Solemnity.
<PB N="379" REF="213"/>
In the first place march'd the <HI>Doge</HI>'s Servants, to
the Number of Forty, in long Livery Cloaks.
Then came the Societies of Tradesmen, or rather
a confus'd Company of private Persons who came
of their own accord to honour the new Procu∣rator;
for their Presence was not requir'd by
any positive Order. These were follow'd by a
Hundred <HI>Sclavonian</HI> Soldiers, arm'd only with Sa∣bres,
who had obtain'd leave to come from the
Army, and appear'd on this Occasion at the desire
of their Commanders. Twelve or Fifteen Offi∣cers
march'd before 'em, among whom was a Ser∣geant
Major; and there were some also in the
Rear. These Officers were not arm'd, because
they came voluntarily, not by command; for at
<HI>Venice</HI> every Man is welcome on such Occasions,
tho' he be not invited. Then came the Eight
Standards of the Republick, Two <HI>Red,</HI> Two <HI>White,</HI>
Two <HI>Blue,</HI> and Two of a <HI>Violet-colour;</HI> the <HI>Red</HI> being
carry'd first, to signifie the present War. These
were immediately follow'd by the Signiory, who
march'd Two and Two, in open-sleev'd Gowns,
or Robes of <HI>Red</HI> Cloth furr'd with Ermines. There
were at least Three hundred Nobles, comprehen∣ding
the Senators and the Procurators, who
form'd the last Ranks, and consequently were
next the <HI>Doge.</HI> He that made his Entry walk'd
among the rest, without any Mark of Distincti∣on
either in his Habit, or any other Respect;
so that if some Persons had not shew'd him to
to me, I cou'd not have distinguish'd him from
the rest of the Procurators. The Robes or Gowns
of all the Procurators are exactly alike; nor is
there any difference among the Nobles in respect
of their Habits; that so none may pretend to Su∣periority
over another. After them came the
<HI>Doge,</HI> who represents the Soveraign: He had a
Vest of Red Brocado, with Gold Flowers, and
<PB N="380" REF="214"/>
over that a Duc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Mantle, of a very rich
Stuff of Gold. His Coronet is a Cap of Past∣board
neatly cover'd with the same rich Stuff,
and adorn'd with some Galoons, without either
Pearls or Precious Stones. There is a sort of
Point on the hinder part of the Cap, that bends
a little forwards. The magnificent Coronet that
is kept in the Treasury, is only us'd on the Day of
the <HI>Doge</HI>'s Coronation. He was accompany'd on the
Right-hand by the Pope's <HI>Nuncio,</HI> and on the Left
by the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, <HI>Monsieur de la Haye.</HI>
The first was in a Camail and Rochet, and the
other in a black Cloak. Two Citizens bore the
<HI>Doge</HI>'s Train, which otherwise wou'd have trail'd
above four Feet on the Ground. Last of all
march'd Fifty or Sixty Nobles, in the same Or∣der
as before. As the Noblemen pass'd by, there
were certain old and young Women that strew'd
the Way with Flowers and Green Leaves, espe∣cially
before the <HI>Doge:</HI> In the mean time the
Guns at the Arsenal were fir'd, and the Compa∣ny
was entertain'd with the Noise of the Prince's
Trumpets and Kettle-Drums, which were plac'd
on the Top of the Portico of the Church, be∣tween
the two Brazen Horses, from whence they
might be easily heard, because 'tis not Three hun∣dred
Paces from thence to the Hall of the Great
Council. As soon as the <HI>Doge</HI> enter'd, he
went immediately to perform his Devotions upon
the Steps of the Altar, where he kneel'd without
a Cushion. As he return'd to his Place, the <HI>Nun∣cio</HI>
happen'd to be on his Left-hand, and the
Ambassador on his Right, but they instantly
chang'd Places, and proceeded as before to the
Place where the <HI>Doge</HI> was to sit. After the <HI>Doge</HI>
had seated himself, the <HI>Nuncio</HI> sate down on his
Right-hand, and <HI>Monsieur de la Haye</HI> took his
Place on the Right-hand of the <HI>Nuncio;</HI> so that
<PB N="381" REF="214"/>
the <HI>Nuncio</HI> sate between the <HI>Doge</HI> and the Am∣bassador.
This preposterous Order will perhaps
surprize you; for according to the Ceremonies
that are observ'd on such Occasions, the <HI>Doge</HI>
ought to have sate in the Middle: But I had
forgot to tell you, that there was no particular
Place appointed for the <HI>Doge,</HI> neither a Tribune,
Pew, nor so much as an arm'd Chair; so that
he was forc'd to make use of the Seat that be∣longs
to the Dean of the Canons, which is the
first on the Right-hand next the Door of the
Quire. The rest of the Seats in the same Row
were fill'd by the Procurators and Senators; so
that the <HI>Doge</HI> had only the first Place among the
Senators, without any other Mark of Distinction
than the red Velvet with which his Seat was
cover'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doge</HI>'s Behaviour during the Mass was not
very edifying, for he spent the whole time in
discoursing with the <HI>Nuncio</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Am∣bassador,
and express'd a great deal of Earnestness
by his Actions. Tho' I cou'd not pretend to
divine the Subject of his Discourse, I cou'd easily
perceive that he talk'd of some important Affair;
for <HI>Monsieur de la Haye</HI> rose from his Place, and
talk'd with him above a quarter of an Hour,
chusing rather to stand while the <HI>Nuncio</HI> sate, and
to turn his Back to the Altar, than to lose the
Opportunity of imparting something with which, in
all probability, he long'd to entertain him. After the
Mass was ended, the <HI>Doge</HI> and Nobles return'd
in the same Order as before, to the Palace of
S. <HI>Mark,</HI> where they were regal'd by the New
Procurator with a splendid Collation of <HI>Wax,</HI> for
so it might be properly call'd, since most of the
Dishes contain'd nothing else. The whole Table
was cover'd with Trophies, Confections, Turky-Cocks,
Partridges, and Fruits represented in Wax,
<PB N="382" REF="215"/>
excepting two or three Places where there were
Dishes of good and delicious Victuals: For the
<HI>Italian</HI> Cooks are at least as skilful as ours. I ne∣ver
saw People eat more heartily than these Gen∣tlemen,
and I'm apt to believe that their Cu∣stom
of serving up the Dishes singly might sharpen
their Appetite; for 'tis certain that the very sight
of a full Table cloys the Stomach. Yet I cou'd
not forbear telling one of the Company, that
this manner of Entertainment, and especially the
Feast of Trophies was very odd and ridiculous: But
the Person to whom I addrest my self, made a shift
to answer my Objection by pretending that they
observ'd this Method to avoid the trouble of co∣vering
so large a Table several times, which cou'd not
be done without Confusion.</P>
<P>That and the two following Days were spent
in rejoycing; The Streets were full of People in
Masquerade, and the Merchants expos'd their rich∣est
Commodities. There was nothing to be seen
in the Shops but Brocado's of Gold and Silver,
Galoons, Fringes, and Ribbons; Sonnets in Ho∣nour
of the Procurator were scatter'd about by
Thousands, and Prints of him every where hung
out. At Night there were great Illuminations at
his Palace, and at that of S. <HI>Mark;</HI> and the
whole City in the general seem'd to be full of
Joy; tho' 'tis certain the Pomp wou'd have been
much greater if the Magistrates, to whom the Re∣gulation
of such Ceremonies does properly be∣long,
had not publish'd an Order three Days be∣fore,
to moderate the Expence of the Solemnity:
For otherwise the whole City wou'd have been
illuminated, the Ladies wou'd have adorn'd them∣selves
with Pearls and Jewels, all the Lacqueys
wou'd have appear'd in Liveries, and the Canal
wou'd have been cover'd with magnificent <HI>Gon∣dola's,</HI>
embellish'd with Flaggs and Streamers, and
<PB N="383" REF="215"/>
fill'd with Consorts of Musick. Besides the Pro∣curator's
Friends wou'd have signaliz'd their Joy
in a particular manner, by Feasts, Illuminations,
and Fire-Works: But all this Pageantry was pre∣vented
by a positive Order from the above-menti∣on'd
Tribunal. At the same time, another Edict
was publish'd, which concerns all Persons in gene∣ral,
and is only a Repetition of those Regulations
that were formerly made on such Occasions. By
this last Order all <HI>Venetians,</HI> whether Nobles
or Citizens, are prohibited to wear any sort of
Stuff, embroider'd Fringe or Galoon, of Gold, Sil∣ver,
Steel, or any thing that shines or casts a Lu∣stre.
The same Edict forbids Lace, new Fashi∣ons
of Cloaths, Liveries, and the Painting or
Adorning of <HI>Gondola's;</HI> and restrains the Women
from using Gold or Silver Ribbons, and from wear∣ing
above three Rows of Fringes or Lace on their
Pettycoats, and even those Ornaments must only
be worn on the Fore-part of the Pettycoat. But
those who are call'd Novices are allow'd, during
the two first Years of their Noviciate, to wear a
String of Pearls, and a Gold Fringe about their
Pettycoats. The Novices are such as are newly
married.</P>
<P>All Strangers are excus'd from complying with
this Order for six Months after the Day of their
Arrival; but assoon as that time is expir'd, they
must submit to the Custom as well as the Natives,
unless they belong to the Retinue of an Ambassa∣dour;
tho' Offences of this Nature are rarely
punish'd.</P>
<P>When I consider the extreme Eagerness with
which the Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> contend for the Ducal
Dignity, I cannot forbear reflecting on the Weak∣ness
of Humane Nature, which exposes us to the
most fatal Delusions, and prompts us to court the
dazzling Appearances of Grandeur, tho' we are
<PB N="384" REF="216"/>
convinc'd of the Vanity of that Enjoyment in
which we seem to place our Happiness. For, in
my Opinion, the Condition of a simple <HI>Senatour</HI> is
infinitely more happy than that of the <HI>Doge.</HI>
He is permitted to enjoy the Pleasure of Walk∣ing,
to visit his Friends, and to go to the <HI>Opera</HI>
and <HI>Ridotti.</HI> He is not perpetually watch'd, and
haunted Night and Day by a Multitude of Spies,
under the Name of Counsellours; nor is he ob∣lig'd
to give an exact Account of his Actions. But
the <HI>Doge</HI> is a gawdy Slave loaded with Fetters,
which are not the less heavy because they are gilded:
And his Authority extends no farther, than to no∣minate
some Officers of the Palace, and to create
some <HI>Knights of S. Mark.</HI></P>
<P>This Order of Knighthood may be divided into
three <HI>Classes</HI> or Ranks. The <HI>First</HI> comprehends the
<HI>Knights of the Golden Star,</HI> who are all Noble <HI>Vene∣ians,</HI>
that owe their Dignity to their Merit, and
wear a <HI>Star</HI> border'd with a Gold Galoon. The
<HI>Second</HI> Rank consists of the <HI>Knights of S. Mark,</HI>
who are call'd <HI>Knights of the Senate:</HI> And this Ho∣nour
is usually conferr'd as a Recompence, on Co∣lonels,
and even sometimes on Captains, who have
signaliz'd their Bravery in an extraordinary man∣ner,
or render'd some important Services to the
Republic. The Captain-General recommends
the Person to the Senate, who, if the Bal∣loting
run in his Favour, receives the Order, and
with it a Pension of at least a Thousand Ducats
a Year. These Knights wear a Medal at one of
their Button-holes, with the Figure of S. <HI>Mark</HI>
on one Side, and a Device on the Reverse, ac∣cording
to the Pleasure of the Senate. They are
honour'd with the Title of <HI>Illustrissimo,</HI> and are much
respected: but the Dignity is indifferently bestow'd
upon all, whether Noble or Ignoble, <HI>Venetians</HI> or
Foreigners. The <HI>Third</HI> and last Rank is made up
<PB N="385" REF="216"/>
of the <HI>Doge's Knights,</HI> who confers the Honour
on whom he pleases, and oftentimes on those
who never wore a Sword; for any Man may
purchase the Title of <HI>Illustrissimo</HI> at the Rate of a
Hundred <HI>Sequins,</HI> which, if I am not mistaken,
is the usual Price of this Dignity. Yet notwith∣standing
the Lowness of the Rate, the <HI>Doge</HI> finds
but few Customers; for the <HI>Italians</HI> are not over∣fond
of so unprofitable Honour. So that this <HI>Classis</HI>
of Knights consists chiefly of Foreign Officers, who
receive some Benefit by the Title; since it not
only procures 'em a more than ordinary Respect,
but confirms 'em in the Possession of their Em∣ployments.</P>
<P>Since the mentioning of these Officers puts me in
mind of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army, I shall take this Occa∣sion
to give you some Account of the Forces
that are maintain'd by the Republick. The total
Number of the Soldiers both at Land and Sea,
hardly amounts to Four and twenty thousand; and
of these there are usually Twelve or Fifteen thou∣sand
in the Field. The <HI>Captain-General,</HI> who com∣mands
'em, is always a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> and has
under him a <HI>General of the Land-Forces, Lieutenant-Generals,</HI>
and <HI>Sergeant-Majors,</HI> who are almost al∣always
Foreigners; for the Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> are not
very ambitious of Military Employments. 'Tis
true, they cannot be accus'd of Want of Cou∣rage;
but since a Soldier must serve his Appren∣ticeship
with his Musquet on his Shoulder, be∣fore
he can attain to any Perfection in his Art,
they cannot endure to think of stooping so low:
and even there is hardly one of 'em that wou'd not
think it beneath him to accept a Captain's Com∣mission.
The <HI>Soldiers</HI> are for the most part Fo∣reigners,
as well as the <HI>Generals;</HI> for, except three
or four small <HI>Italian</HI> Regiments, which are not
much esteem'd, the rest of the Army consists ei∣ther
<PB N="386" REF="217"/>
of <HI>Germans,</HI> or <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> whom they call <HI>Tra∣montani.</HI>
The Pay of Foreigners is double to that
which is allow'd to the <HI>Italians;</HI> and no Captain must
receive a Soldier of another Nation into his Compa∣ny,
under Pain of being cashier'd without Remission.
But the same Order is not observ'd in the <HI>Italian</HI>
Regiments, for any Man may be admitted to
serve in 'em. And since the Foreign Captains
wou'd be at a Loss for want of Men, the Re∣public
takes care to supply 'em with Recruits:
Only they must be very cautious in preventing
the Desertion of their Men; for when a Compa∣ny
is extremely diminish'd, the Captain is always
<HI>reform'd,</HI> and the Soldiers serve to recruit the rest
of the Regiment. I know several Officers, who
lost their Places by Misfortunes of this Nature;
which sometimes cannot be avoided, especially a∣mong
the <HI>French,</HI> who desert by Hundreds at a
time. If it were not for this only Inconvenien∣cy,
I shou'd have a very good Opinion of the
<HI>Venetian</HI> Service; for a Foreign <HI>Captain</HI> has no less
than a <HI>Hundred</HI> Ducats a Month, which makes
<HI>Two hundred and fifty French</HI> Livres; a <HI>Lieutenant</HI> has
<HI>Thirty,</HI> and an <HI>Ensign Twenty five.</HI> Besides there
is not a Place in the World where a Soldier has
a nearer Prospect of Advancement; for since the
Army is not very Numerous, and the Noble <HI>Ve∣netians</HI>
never pretend to Military Preferments, a
Stranger has a fair Opportunity of raising his For∣tune:
So that a <HI>Captain</HI> must either be extreme∣ly
unfortunate, or negligent in the Performance
of his Duty, if his Service be not rewarded with
a <HI>Colonel</HI>'s Commission, or even with more con∣siderable
Preferment. The Army is full of <HI>Sergeant-Majors,</HI>
who owe their Fortune meerly to their
Merit; and there is no Post so high which a
brave Man may not in time hope to obtain. 'Tis
a wonderful Encouragement to a Young Aspirer,
<PB N="387" REF="217"/>
to see daily so many Examples that flatter and ex∣cite
his Ambition. Besides their travelling by
Sea frees 'em from the Charge of providing an
Equipage; which is a great Advantage to those
who are not over-stock'd with Money. Add to
these Conveniencies the free and unconstrain'd Way
of living <HI>a-la-mode de Venice;</HI> and it must be ac∣knowledg'd,
that a Man may easily chuse a less com∣fortable
Employment. I know the World has ge∣nerally
so bad an Opinion of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Service,
that 'tis usually the last Refuge of those who are
reduc'd to Extremity: Nor am I ignorant that
the Officers are not here on the same Foot
as in <HI>France,</HI> and that the meanest Scoundrels find
Admittance; but, after all, the Service is not
really less advantageous for these Inconvenien∣cies.</P>
<P>But, as for the Common Soldiers, their Condi∣tion
is so miserable, that I wou'd rather chuse to
serve a Tinker, than to carry a Musquet at <HI>Ve∣nice.</HI>
Their Pay amounts to no more than <HI>Three
Pence</HI> a Day; and besides they must furnish their
own Clothes. Judge then what Provision they
can make for their Bellies, and whether their
Desertion can be reckon'd a Fault. Those who
serve at Sea have the same Pay, and Clothes in∣to
the Bargain; but they must buy their Provisi∣ons,
for they are allow'd only Bread and Water.
There are <HI>Eleven</HI> Ships belonging to the Republic,
commanded by the <HI>Captain-General;</HI> for there is
no <HI>Admiral.</HI> But besides the little Care that is ta∣ken
to keep 'em in Repair, they are so defective
in all Respects, that they hardly deserve the Name
of <HI>Ships,</HI> much less of <HI>Men of War.</HI> In every Ship
there is a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Com∣mander,</HI>
who pehaps never saw a Mast before his
coming on Board: but he has under him a <HI>Cap∣tain,</HI>
whom he consults, or rather suffers to com∣mand.
<PB N="388" REF="218"/>
These Captains (who are usually old and
expert Pilots) have <HI>Thirty</HI> Ducats a Month besides
their Entertainment; and may in time be ad∣vanc'd
to the Command of a Merchant-Ship, if
the Owners think fit to trust 'em. The <HI>Ban∣ner</HI>
of <HI>Venice</HI> is <HI>Red,</HI> with a <HI>Lyon</HI> in the Middle,
holding an open <HI>Book</HI> in one of his Paws, with
these Words, <HI>Pax tibi, Marce, Evangelista meus.</HI>
Many take this <HI>Lyon</HI> for the <HI>Arms</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> but
they are extremely mistaken; for the <HI>Republic</HI> has
no Coat of Arms, and wou'd be loth to adorn
a Scutcheon with that Sacred Beast, whom they
honour as an Emblem of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> or rather that
Evangelist himself represented under the Figure
of a <HI>Lyon.</HI> I knew that Painters usually give that
Saint a <HI>Lyon</HI> for his Companion; but I cou'd
not believe that the <HI>Venetian Lyon</HI> was the <HI>Saint</HI>
himself, till I was convinc'd by the repeated Af∣firmations
of several credible Persons, and even
of some Noblemen; who, to satisfie my Scruples,
told me the following Story.</P>
<P>S. <HI>Mark</HI> was a Youth of such exquisite Beauty,
that his only Sister fell so desperately in Love
with him, that notwithstanding all his Holy Ad∣monitions,
she haunted him Night and Day, fol∣low'd
him whithersoever he went, and continu∣ally
begg'd him to satisfie her Passion. At last
the young Saint perceiving that all his Severity
cou'd not extinguish her Criminal Flame, besought
God to transform him into the most hideous
Creature in the World. His Prayer was grant∣ed,
and he was instantly turn'd to a <HI>Lyon,</HI> whose
gaping Mouth, and horrid Roaring, so terrify'd his
Sister, that immediately she fell upon her Knees,
pray'd to God to forgive her, and was convert∣ed.
The <HI>Open Book</HI> he holds in his Talons, re∣presents
the <HI>Gospel,</HI> of which they pretend to
have the Original in the Treasury; and the
<PB N="389" REF="218"/>
Words that are written in it are the same with
which <HI>Christ</HI> saluted him when he came to visit him
in Prison.</P>
<P>Perhaps you'll think that this Story deserves a
place in <HI>Ovid</HI>'s <HI>Metamorphoses;</HI> but I can assure
you the <HI>Venetians</HI> are oblig'd to believe it, under
Pain of being accounted <HI>Hereticks.</HI> Sometimes they
represent him with, and sometimes without Wings,
but they seldom or never forget to draw Rays
about his Head; and very often the <HI>Doge</HI> is
painted kneeling before him. At least he is
thus represented in all the most remarkable Pla∣ces,
such as the Front of the Palace of S.
<HI>Mark,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I'm sensible I have already detain'd you too
long, but I must not finish my Letter before I
have finish'd the Account I promis'd to give you
of the <HI>Venetian Nobles.</HI> I had form'd so strange
an Idea from the Character I had receiv'd of 'em,
that I look'd upon 'em as the most Haughty and
Ill-natur'd Men in the World. And even a Fa∣mous
Author has the Confidence to affirm that
one of their usual Recreations is to affront Stran∣gers
who seem to be Persons of Note; thrusting 'em
into the Canal as they walk along the Streets,
spitting upon 'em at the <HI>Opera,</HI> beating 'em with
flaming Torches, and hiring <HI>Bravo's</HI> to murder
'em. Yet to do Justice to that Illustrious Body,
I can assure you, that I never met with more
civil and obliging Persons in the World. I have
the Honour to know two or three of 'em, and
perceive daily so many conspicuous Marks of good
Nature in all their Actions, that I cannot, with∣out
Indignation, reflect on the Impudence of those
who have so unjustly blacken'd their Character.
'Tis true, they take Care to maintain the Ho∣nour
of their Birth, and their Authority over the
Citizens and the rest of their Subjects: but they
<PB N="390" REF="219"/>
are so far from insulting or tyrannizing over
'em, that they are always ready to grant their
Protection to honest Men; and as for Strangers,
there is not a City in the World where they meet
with a kinder and more civil Entertainment.
They may do what they please, for no Man ei∣ther
enquires into, or comments upon their Acti∣ons;
and when they meet with a Nobleman, they
are treated with all imaginable Marks of Honour
and Civility. There are several <HI>Coffee-Houses</HI> under
the <HI>Procuraties,</HI> some of which are set apart for
the Nobility; and that Order is so strictly observ'd
that a Citizen never enters into 'em. But if a
Foreigner, who has the Appearance of a Gentle∣man,
go in to one of these Places, all the No∣bles
that are there begin immediately to caress
him; and there is not one of 'em who wou'd not
willingly embrace the Offer of his Acquaintance,
provided he belongs not to the Retinue of an
<HI>Ambassador:</HI> for they are severely prohibited by
the Laws of the State to entertain any correspon∣dence
with such Persons.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Bravo's,</HI> I will not pretend to af∣firm
that <HI>Venice</HI> was never plagu'd with those
barbarous and inhuman Murderers. It must be
acknowledg'd that the Senate tolerated these Abu∣ses
too long: There was a time when some No∣bles
kept Fifteen or Twenty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those Ruffians;
and there were others who were still ready to
serve any Man in their Way, that is, for so ma∣ny
<HI>Sequins</HI> wou'd agree to kill a Man, or to break
his Arms for such a Number of <HI>Ducats.</HI> But the
Face of Affairs is wonderfully chang'd since that
time, and so vast a Number of those Villains
have ended their Lives either on a <HI>Gibbet,</HI> or in
the <HI>Galleys,</HI> that the Race of 'em seems to be quite
extinct. The <HI>Shirts</HI> of <HI>Mail</HI> that were sold in
those Days for <HI>Fifty Pistoles</HI> a-piece, are now sold
<PB N="391" REF="219"/>
for <HI>half a Crown</HI> to Fishermen, who use 'em for
catching Oysters: For these Cautions, that were
once thought so necessary for preventing secret As∣sassinations,
are now become so useless, that one
may walk as secure thro' the City by Night as
by Day, and during the <HI>Carnaval</HI> as in <HI>Lent:</HI> At
least I have not yet heard of any Disord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs since
my Arrival. On the contrary, I shou'd never de∣sire
to converse with a more harmless and peace∣able
People; and if there are any Insolencies com∣mitted,
I shou'd rather accuse the <HI>French</HI> as the
Authors of 'em, who in this, as well as in all other
Places, assume those Liberties by which they affect
to distinguish themselves from other Nations. On∣ly
I wou'd not advise any Man to hunt too bold∣ly
in a Nobleman's Inclosure; for 'tis certain that
there is none of 'em so Complaisant as to see his
Wife kiss'd, without resenting the Affront, and
that notwithstanding the seeming Extirpation of
the <HI>Bravo's,</HI> the injur'd Nobleman wou'd quickly
find a sufficient Number of 'em to execute his
Revenge. Their Jealousie is accompany'd with so
implacable a Fury, that they wou'd rather ruine
themselves and their whole Family, than suffer a
bold Intruder into their secret Delights to escape
unpunish'd; and after they had sacrific'd the Lo∣ver
to their Rage, they wou'd infallibly compleat
their Revenge by the Death of her who betray'd
'em. Such Accidents have sometimes happen'd,
and 'tis to be observ'd, that in such Cases the Se∣nate
never enquires into the Murder. For every
Nobleman may poison his Wife for Adultery, and
cause her Gallant to be poniarded, without fear∣ing
to be call'd in question for so bloody a Re∣venge;
since 'tis suppos'd that no Man wou'd have
recourse to such violent Methods, if he were not
fully convinc'd of his Wife's Infidelity. I confess
this way of satisfying their Revenge seems at first
<PB N="392" REF="220"/>
View to be extremely base and unworthy of a Man
of Honour: But you will be the less surpriz'd at their
manner of Proceeding in these Cases, if you con∣sider
that, notwithstanding their Nobility, 'tis not
their Profession to bear Arms. For they are as
much <HI>Men of the Gown</HI> as the <HI>Presidents</HI> of the <HI>Par∣liament</HI>
at <HI>Paris;</HI> and are therefore under a sort
of Obligation to abstain from Duels. Neverthe∣less
since 'tis not just that they shou'd tamely suf∣fer
themselves to be Cuckolded, they must exe∣cute
their Vengeance by Proxy, since their Pro∣fession
restrains em from making their own Hands
the Instruments of their Revenge.</P>
<P>I shall in the next place give you a short Ac∣count
of their <HI>Habit:</HI> They wear a black Gown
exactly like that of a <HI>Minime Friar;</HI> only 'tis
longer, wider, and open before; the Sleeves are
so big that they hang down almost to the Ground,
and they have a little Collar or Neckband like
that which is us'd by the <HI>Jesuites.</HI> In the Win∣ter
their Gowns are lin'd with a greyish Fur,
which reaches a hands-breadth beyond the Cloth,
all along the Breast, and are ty'd about with a
Leathern-Girdle, adorn'd with Silver Buckles and
Bosses. In Summer they use neither Girdles nor
Furrs; for they wear their Vests loose by reason of
the Heat, and line 'em with very thin Taffata:
But they still wear Cloth Gowns of the same big∣ness
as in Winter. On their Shoulders they wear
a sort of Bag or Hood of the same Cloth, call'd
the <HI>Stole,</HI> 18 or 20 Inches broad, and twice as
long, which is extremely troublesome. Under
their Gowns they have only a little Doublet, almost
quite cover'd with black Lace, and adorn'd with
Ribbans at the turning up of the Sleeves. Their
Shirts are always very white and fine. Their
Breeches are open and very wide, like those that
were us'd by Citizens in <HI>France</HI> Fifty Years ago;
<PB N="393" REF="220"/>
and they are also full of Lace and Ribbans. This
Garb is both stately and cheap; for a Gown lasts
at least three or four Years. The only Fault I
find in their Habit is that they use neither Bands
nor Cravates. Formerly they were oblig'd to wear
their own Hair, but now they use the finest and
longest Periwigs, which is certainly one of the
most necessary parts of their Dress: for their Caps
are so ill-contriv'd, that there can be nothing
more proper to disfigure a Man's Face, which
perhaps is the reason why at present they only
wear 'em in their Hands like a Fan.</P>
<P>These Nobles, notwithstanding the Dignity of
their Character, scruple not to go to the Market, and
buy all the little Provisions that are requir'd for
the maintaining of a Family. But I believe they
are injur'd by those who pretend that they carry
home their Provisions in the Sleeves of their Gowns;
for there are Porters or <HI>Cestarioli,</HI> who have no
other Occupation, and whose Hire is so small, that
even the meanest Tradesmen make use of 'em.
Nor must you imagine that the Principal and
Rich Nobles buy their own Provisions; for the
Markets are only frequented by the poorer sort of
Gentlemen, of whom there is a considerable Num∣ber,
and whose Condition is the more deplorable,
because they must not endeavour to improve it by
Trading.</P>
<P>I know not what Apology to make for the ex∣cessive
Length of my Letter, unless you will be
satisfy'd with that common Excuse for all sorts
of Faults, that I did not intend it. I confess that
will not make amends for the trouble I have gi∣ven
you, but I hope you'll for once admit a Plea
that can never be more justly urg'd than in Ca∣ses
of this Nature; for it oftentimes happens, that
when a Man comes to the End of the Leaf
where he design'd to have ended his Letter, he
<PB N="394" REF="221"/>
finds himself oblig'd to begin another, and per∣haps
two or three before he can finish his Mat∣ter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have seen the famous Ceremony of <HI>Ascension-Day,</HI>
and was so transported with Pleasure at
the Sight of that celebrated Solemnity, that I was
strongly tempted, and almost fully resolv'd to send
you a Description of it. But upon second and
cooler Thoughts, I consider'd that I cou'd add
nothing to what so many Authors have already
said on that Subject, and therefore I shall only tell
you, that the prodigious Quantity of <HI>Gondola's</HI> that
cover'd the whole Surface of the Sea from <HI>Venice</HI> to
the Mouth of the <HI>Lido,</HI> made me almost give
Credit to the usual Computation of the <HI>Venetians,</HI>
who affirm, that there are <HI>Five and twenty Thou∣sand
Gondola's</HI> in the City. The Number of those
little Vessels might be more easily calculated than
that of the Inhabitants; because every <HI>Gondolier</HI> is ob∣lig'd
to pay a certain Tax to the State. The
Dexterity of these Boatmen is surprizing, and
even almost incredible; for tho' they seem to fly
as swift as a Bird, and tho' the Canals are both
narrow, and in several Places cross one another,
they never run foul of those whom they meet.
<PB N="395" REF="221"/>
To avoid the Disorders that happen on such Oc∣casions,
they make a Noise at each Corner of the
Canal to give Warning to those that are within
the reach of their Voice, who answer in a Dia∣lect
consisting of Words that are only known to
themselves, such as <HI>Preci, Prami,</HI> and <HI>Sia,</HI> which
they understand so well, that immediately they
turn their <HI>Gondola's,</HI> and pass by without touch∣ing
one another. These <HI>Gondola's,</HI> which are all
made after the same Fashion, from that which
belongs to the first Procurator to those that are
commonly hir'd, are a sort of flat-bottom'd, nar∣row,
and very long Boats. In the middle there is
a little Chamber cover'd with course black Serge,
with an Opening before instead of a Door; and
on each Side there is a Window that may be
shut with Curtains, or sometimes with a Piece of
the same Serge which hangs at the Top of the
<HI>Gondola,</HI> and is usually turn'd up in fair Weather.
The Price of a <HI>Gondola</HI> ready made amounts to
five and twenty <HI>Ducats;</HI> but in those that belong
to some of the principal Noblemen, there are
Grates that sometimes cost above a Hundred
Crowns; and besides, the Windows may be a∣dorn'd
with Glasses like those that are us'd on
Coaches; which is all the Embellishment that is
allow'd by the Republick. The meanest <HI>Gondolier</HI>
earns half a <HI>Ducat</HI> a Day; and there are some
who will not serve under a Crown: So that con∣sidering
that every <HI>Gondola</HI> requires four Men, it
will be found at the End of the Reckoning that
one of these Boats consumes as much Money as
the keeping of a Coach and Six Horses.</P>
<P>The Ceremony of the <HI>Bucentaur,</HI> according to
the usual Custom, was succeeded by a very mag∣nificent
Feast, that lasted Fifteen Days. This may
be reckon'd a second <HI>Carnaval,</HI> and does really ex∣ceed
the first. 'Tis true, there are no <HI>Opera</HI>'s nor
<PB N="396" REF="222"/>
<HI>Comedies,</HI> but that Defect is more than supply'd
by the enlivening Beauty of the Season, and by
one of the finest and richest <HI>Fairs</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> which
is kept in the Place of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> and in the <HI>Brog∣lio,</HI>
where the Shops are rank'd with such a har∣monious
Proportion and Uniformity, that one
wou'd think it were a City purposely built for
Pleasure. The Street of the <HI>Goldsmiths,</HI> and that
of the <HI>Mercers</HI> are extremely magnificent; for the
Shops are full of the richest Commodities, and
every Morning and Evening one may have the
Pleasure to see the best Company in Town, and
especially the Ladies, who come to oblige the
longing Spectators with a View of their Charms,
and to make Strangers confess that they are bet∣ter
furnish'd with the noblest Ornament of their
Sex than all the most celebrated Beauties in o∣ther
Countries. And I cannot forbear adding up∣on
this Occasion, that the Liberty I observ'd in
this Place seems to be altogether inconsistent with
the Slavery which these fair ones are said to suf∣fer.
'Tis certain that the Ladies in this Place are
more closely confin'd than in <HI>France;</HI> but their
Restraint is not so severe as we commonly ima∣gine.
'Tis true, 'twou'd be thought indecent for
a Woman to walk, or to entertain a private Dis∣course
with those of our Sex; nor is it usual for
Ladies to make Matches for Gaming. But to
make amends for these Niceties, they are permit∣ted
to see <HI>Opera's</HI> and <HI>Plays,</HI> to go to the <HI>Ridotti,</HI>
the <HI>Fresco,</HI> and <HI>Fairs,</HI> and to walk about the
Streets in <HI>Masquerade,</HI> either alone or in Com∣pany.
I leave you to judge whether their Con∣finement
be so rigorous as 'tis usually represented,
and whether they have reason to complain of the
Severity of their Husbands. For my part, I'm apt
to think that there are few Men in <HI>France</HI> or
<HI>Holland</HI> that wou'd willingly allow their Wives the
<PB N="397" REF="222"/>
Liberty to go abroad without any other Compa∣ny
than one or two Maids, and after they have
run Masqu'd about the Streets all Day long, to pop
into a publick Gaming-House, where there are
more Courtesans than any other Company. This
is the usual Recreation of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ladies,
which they daily use without exposing themselves
to their Husband's Anger, or the Censure of their
Neighbours; tho' in such Frolicks they meet with
many a fair Opportunity of indulging themselves
in more criminal Diversions; for they are perpe∣tually
surrounded with Temptations, and 'tis impossi∣ble
for a Lady to ramble about a whole Day with∣out
hearing Twenty Compliments of that Nature.
'Tis the Custom of the Place, and the particular
Privilege both of the <HI>Carnaval</HI> and <HI>Fair,</HI> that any
Man may demand the <HI>last Favour</HI> of a Woman
whom he finds alone in a Vizor-Mask; for that
Circumstance alone gives her the Denomination
of <HI>Signora Mascara,</HI> and she's reckon'd as lawful
Prize as if she were cloath'd in the obscenest and
most extravagant Garb. You may freely accost
any Woman that wears this Badge, without put∣ting
off your Hat, or using any other Ceremony
whatsoever; but if they return no Answer to
your second or third Question, you may leave off
your Courtship, and conclude that they will not
be debauch'd. Nevertheless 'tis highly dangerous
to use the same Freedom with a Lady that walks
without a Mask; for in such Cases we are only
allow'd the Privilege of Gazing and Wishing,
and all other Liberties are so rigorously prohibi∣ted,
that the highest Affront that can be offer'd
to a Woman, is to salute her; for none but Curte∣zans
will permit that Freedom.</P>
<P>These <HI>Masquerades</HI> are not only very diverting, but
extremely commodious for several sorts of People.
How many Persons are there who wou'd be con∣fin'd
<PB N="398" REF="223"/>
to their Houses by the Gravity of their Cha∣racter,
if such a Disguise did not give 'em an
Opportunity of sharing in the publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Diversions.
How many Princes, Dukes, Procurators, and other
Persons of high Quality, take the Advantage of so
savourable an Occasion to shake off that Load of
Grandeur with which they are continually op∣press'd;
and breaking loose from their gawdy
Prisons, ramble about <HI>Incognito</HI> among the Crowd,
and find more Pleasure in personating a Citizen
or Tradesman, than ever they cou'd enjoy in
their Palaces. For a <HI>Mask</HI> has this admirable
Quality, that it can in a Moment transform a
Prince into a Porter; and one of the greatest
Advantages of such a surprizing <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> is,
that every Man may resume his own Figure when
he pleases. If we may believe the <HI>Venetians,</HI> a
certain Great Prince, who is known over all the
World, scrupl'd not to act a part in these agree∣able
Frolicks.</P>
<P>The whole <HI>Carnaval,</HI> and the Festival after <HI>Ascensi∣on-Day</HI>
is spent in <HI>Masquerading,</HI> and all that while there
seems to be a New Republic form'd in the midst of
the other. There is an universal Change in the Ha∣bits,
Customs, and Laws. All <HI>Marks</HI> of <HI>Distinction</HI> and
<HI>Superiority</HI> are forgotten, or at least neglected; All
Persons are, or seem to be equal: Respect, Con∣straint,
Ceremony, Care, and Business, are ba∣nish'd
from Society, and are succeeded by Joy,
Liberty, and an agreeable Sort of Folly. Under
this Disguise many pleasant Intrigues are carry'd
on; and Strangers are oblig'd to that Concealer
of Blushes for many a happy Moment. I know
one that was accosted by a Lady, who carry'd
him to a little House; where, having open'd the
Door with a Key that she had in her Pocket,
she put him in Possession of a thousand
charming Beauties; yet all his Arguments and In∣treaties
<PB N="399" REF="223"/>
cou'd not procure him a sight of her Face;
for her Mask was ty'd on with a Silver Chain
fasten'd with a little Padlock. But the strangest
<HI>Mascara</HI> that ever I had occasion to see, or per∣haps
that ever appear'd in <HI>Venice,</HI> was a Woman
who came to the Fair, cover'd from Head to
Foot with a sort of long Gown or Shroud. She
had no Clothes under it, not so much as a
Smock, and from time to time she open'd her Gown,
and oblig'd the Company with a full View of her
Wares. Thus she walk'd three or four times about
the Fair, and was doubtless very narrowly and
attententively view'd by the Spectators. This Frol∣lick
was thought to be occasion'd by a Wager.</P>
<P>During the Fair, the whole Place of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> and
part of the <HI>Broglio,</HI> is cover'd with Shops: The
other part is full of <HI>Juglers, Tumblers, Puppet-Players,
Bears,</HI> and <HI>Mountebanks,</HI> who are <HI>dancing</HI>
frequented by all sorts of People, from the <HI>Noble∣man</HI>
to the <HI>Gondelier.</HI> But the greatest Croud is
about certain <HI>Female-Astrologers,</HI> who are mounted
on little Stages or Scaffolds, cover'd with Lace and
Ribbons like Puppets; their Faces painted white and
red, and surrounded with a great Number of Books,
full of Figures and Characters, tho' they under∣stand
no more of 'em than to distinguish the
White from the Black. There are also some Men
who follow the same Trade; but they are not
so much follow'd as the Women, whose triple
Top-knots draw the Multitude after 'em. They
sit upon a Chair, from whence, as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>from a <HI>Tripos,</HI>
they blow good Fortune to their Customers thro'
a Tin Trunk eight or ten Foot long, the Que∣rist
putting the other End to his Ear. The Price
of a Consultation is no more than <HI>Five-pence;</HI>
and for so small a Summ you may have the
Promise of as much Honour and Riches as you
please. These Wenches, who sometimes are not
<PB N="400" REF="224"/>
ugly, observe an admirable Gravity in pronoun∣cing
their <HI>Responses;</HI> but they are not so starch'd
in private, and may be easily prevail'd with to
lay aside their affected Severity. One of my
Friends, who is a <HI>Germain</HI> Officer, happen'd t'o∣ther
Day to try the Experiment; and since the
Story is not unpleasant, I shall make bold to en∣tertain
you with it. As we were taking our
Diversion in the Fair, we took particular Notice
of one of those <HI>She-Astrologers,</HI> who was one of the
prettyest and gravest of the whole Tribe. She
was surrounded with a Croud of People of all
Ages and Ranks, who approach'd one after ano∣ther
to the End of her Trunk to learn their Fate,
and to hear the Oraculous Sentences which she
pronounc'd with an incredible Majesty and Authori∣ty.
My Friend took his Turn among the rest,
and after she had acquainted him with his For∣tune,
told her that he was desirous to consult
her about some private Affair, and therefore in∣treated
her to turn the other End of the Trunk,
that he might communicate his Secret to her
without disclosing it to the Company. But instead
of proposing some Questions to her about his For∣tune,
he told her thro' her Trunk, that he came
not to desire the Assistance of her pretended Art,
which serv'd only to amuse the Vulgar; that 'twas
in her Power to grant him a more solid Favour;
and that his Business was to enquire where and
when he might spend a Night with her. Assoon
as she had heard his Proposal, she turn'd the
Trunk and reply'd, that he ought not to be sur∣priz'd
at her way of Living, by imposing upon
the Credulity of the People, since the only Oc∣cupation
of the greatest part of Mankind consi∣sted
in cheating one another, every one in his
own Way, and according to the Nature of his
Employment; and that for her part she thought
<PB N="401" REF="224"/>
five or six Crowns a day but a moderate Recom∣pence
for the Pains she took in deceiving those that
were willing to be deceiv'd; adding however that
she was glad she had found a Man of Sense, that
knew the Infirmities of Humane Nature, and wou'd
laugh with her at the Follies of Mankind, and
concluded with giving him an Assignation at an
Inn, where she promis'd to meet him that Evening.
Her agreeable Humour furnish'd us with Matter of
Discourse for above an Hour; but this was
the End of the Adventure, for the Officer did not
think fit to drive the Jest further.</P>
<P>Tho' the Summer is scarce begun, the Heat is
already so violent, that every one endeavours to
make it less insupportable by the Thinness and Light∣ness
of his Clothes. Now I speak of Habits, I
wish you cou'd see that which is us'd by the
Girls that visit the Fair every Day to look out
for a Customer. For every Mother that is willing
to be rid of her Daughter, carries her thither
every Day as to a Market, with all the alluring
Ornaments of an advantageous Dress. They have
large and very fine Top-knots; their Neck and
Breasts are bare; and their Habit consists chiefly
of a little Cloak or Mantle of white Muslin, a∣dorn'd
with red Ribbons, a single Petticoat of
the same Cloth, a neat Pair of Shooes and Silk-Stockins,
exactly fitted to their Legs. There is
nothing more proper to inspire Love than the sight
of those young Creatures, who for the most part
are charming Beauties; nor is a Man forc'd to
purchase his Happiness at the Rate of a tedious
Courtship; for assoon as he feels Nature begin to
work, he may immediately address himself to the
Mother, who is always ready to make the Bar∣gain.
But tho' it will not cost you a Sigh to
gain your Mistress's Heart, you must pay dear for
the Enjoymnent of her Person: for you cannot
<PB N="402" REF="225"/>
purchase a handsome Maiden-Girl under 150
Crowns in hand, and as much every Year for
Entertainment. For 200 you may have the Choice
of the Market, where you may find some that
look like little Angels. Nor are you oblig'd to
buy a Pig in a Poke; for you may view and
handle her as much as you will, and examine
your Commodity both with your Eyes and Hands
before you agree upon the Price. As for the
Maiden-head, if the Mother promise to warrant
it, you may depend upon her word: for these
Matrons are too conscientious to impose second-hand
Goods upon a Customer; and besides they
dare not venture upon a Cheat which they be∣lieve
may be so easily discover'd. For 'tis as im∣possible
to root this Opinion out of the Minds
of the <HI>Italians,</HI> as of the <HI>Oriental</HI> Nations; and
whether it be true or false, 'tis attended with this
advantageous Consequence, that it makes the young
Women very careful of preserving their Treasure,
since they believe it impossible to conceal the Loss
of it; at least it has this Effect on those who in∣tend
to marry. But they who pretend only to be kept
are not so nice, for tho' they take care to pre∣serve
their Maiden-head, they never scruple to al∣low
a Man all the Liberties that can be us'd
without deflowring 'em. I know a Woman that
has three Daughters; the two Eldest are public</P>
<P>Courtezans, but the Third, who is ve∣ry
pretty, is still<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Maid.</NOTE> <HI>una Putta, una Vergine,</HI>
tho' she has lain perhaps with a Hundred Men.
Yet she is really a Maid, and wou'd not sell
her Maiden-head a Farthing under Two hundred
Crowns. I cannot leave this Subject without ta∣king
Notice of the extravagant Opinion of the
<HI>Italians,</HI> concerning one of the Properties of a
Beautiful Woman. Instead of little, hard, and
well-separated Breasts, they love to have 'em
<PB N="403" REF="225"/>
large and fleshy; so that when they put their
Hand into the Bosom of a Maid whom they in∣tend
to purchase, if she be not so well provided
as they commonly desire, she is forc'd to make
some pretty Excuse, or to tell 'em laughing, That
<HI>she has lent her Bubbies to her little Sister, or has
plaid 'em away at Bassette.</HI> And even when a <HI>French∣man</HI>
meets with such Girls, and tells 'em that he
is no Admirer of fleshy Breasts, they usually an∣swer,
<HI>Ay, Sir, you are pleas'd to say so; but if they
were larger you wou'd like 'em better.</HI></P>
<P>You will be apt to look upon this Way of
buying Girls as very odd and extravagant; but
I'm confident you will be no less surpriz'd at
the Relation of an Adventure that happen'd to
one of my Friends, who is a <HI>French</HI> Officer late∣ly
return'd from the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army. I remember
I promis'd you the Story, and I'm resolv'd to
keep my Word, tho' I must run the Hazard of
giving you an ill Opinion of my Friend's Cha∣stity.</P>
<P>During our Confinement in the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> we
had no other Recreation, but what we found in
conversing with the <HI>Prior,</HI> who is a very accom∣plish'd
Person: You may easily divine the usual
Subject of our Discourse. We hardly talk'd of any
thing but the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ladies, of whose Beauty and
Gracefulness he gave us so lively a Description,
that his feeling Expressions made a very strong Im∣pression
on the Officer's Mind. Then he proceeded
to tell us, that we might easily satisfie our Incli∣nations
to Love in this great City, without exposing
our selves to the Censures of a Critical and Ill-natur'd
World. In short, my Friend was so charm'd
with his agreeable Conversation, and so well pleas'd
with the Hope he gave him, that he cou'd not for∣bear
protesting and repeating his Protestations more
than once, that he wou'd not leave the City
<PB N="404" REF="226"/>
without tasting the <HI>Dear Delight.</HI> His Guardian,
who never left him, and had often heard us talk
on that Subject, concluded that he had met with
a Man fit for his Purpose, that is, one who wou'd
spare no Cost to indulge his Inclination to Plea∣sure.
Resolving then to make the best Advan∣tage
of so promising an Opportunity, he took oc∣casion
to talk with him in private two days be∣fore
our Departure, and told him with a great
deal of Confidence, that perceiving him to be a
great Admirer of handsome Women; and know∣ing
that he wou'd probably meet with some in
that great City whither he was going, he thought
himself oblig'd to admonish him of the dangerous con∣sequences
that frequently attended the Rashness of
an unexperienc'd Adventurer upon an unknown
Coast; since those who seem to be very sound
and beautiful, are oftentimes mere lewd and rot∣ten
Strumpets. But, added he, if you will trust
my Honesty, and lodge at my House, which is
both very neat and civil, I have an only Daugh∣ter,
who has as much Beauty as any Lady in <HI>Venice;</HI>
her I'll bestow upon you, and warrant her as
sound and clean as a Pearl, as I hope in the
most holy <HI>Madona.</HI> Then the Officer ask'd
him whether she was a <HI>Maid,</HI> and he ve∣ry
ingenuously acknowledg'd that she was
not, and that she was kept by a <HI>Venetian</HI> No∣bleman,
who allow'd her a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">200 Crowns.</NOTE> hun∣dred
<HI>Sequins</HI> a Year: but, continu'd
he, tho' she has hitherto observ'd an inviolable Fi∣delity
to her Keeper, I have so strong an Inclina∣tion
to make you my Friend, that I'm resolv'd to
give her to you, and I'm confident you'll be sa∣tisfy'd
with her Person when you see her. My
Friend considering that at <HI>Venice</HI> a Man that loves
to keep himself clean and neat, must not take a
Lodging at a Public House of Entertainment, and
<PB N="405" REF="226"/>
not knowing where to find a convenient Lodging,
accepted his Guardian's Offer, and went to his
House, where he took a very neat Room, and
agreed both for Diet and Lodging at a very rea∣sonable
Rate. The next Morning his Landlord
carry'd him to his Daughter, who had a very mag∣nificent
Apartment, consisting of three fine Cham∣bers
on a Floor, adorn'd with large Looking-Glas∣ses,
Cupboard and Scrutores of <HI>China,</HI> with two
Maids in a very handsome Garb to attend her. My
Friend was doubtless extremely well satisfy'd with
every thing he saw, and especially with the lovely
<HI>Donna,</HI> who was one of the most charming Beau∣ties
in the World: But his Satisfaction lasted not
long, for when he came to talk of the Price, she
ask'd four times as much as he was able or wil∣ling
to give her; so that after two hours Wrang∣ling,
he was forc'd to leave her without conclu∣ding
the Bargain. Yet he continues still to lodge
at her Father's House, who professes as much
Friendship to him as ever. He told me that he
observ'd one Piece of Furniture in the Young
Lady's Chamber that was very suitable to one of
her Profession. 'Twas a very large Couch cover'd
with a Quilt of black Sattin, and directly over it
there hung at the Cieling one of those <HI>Fans</HI>
which I had occasion to mention in one of my
former Letters. She confess'd that this was her
Lover's Contrivance, to qualifie the extreme Heat
of the Weather, which is never more insupport∣able
than when one is already sufficiently heat∣ed
with the eager Recreations of Love. And she
assur'd him that the all Nobles have such Fans
in their Houses.</P>
<P>Of all the Customs that are peculiar to the
<HI>Italians,</HI> I know none that seems odder and more
incommodious than that of lying stark-naked in
their Beds, which is generally observ'd by Men,
<PB N="406" REF="227"/>
Women, Boys, and Girls; and notwithstanding
the Indecency of such a Custom, the most bashful
Virgin never scruples to strip her self to a state of
pure Nature on her Wedding Night, and to be∣come
an <HI>Eve</HI> to her new <HI>Adam.</HI> 'Tis true, most
Persons of Quality lie as we do, tho' there are
several even of that Rank, who follow the com∣mon
Fashion.</P>
<P>The Curtezans enjoy here no less Liberty than
at <HI>Rome,</HI> and are divided into two distinct Or∣ders.
The first consists of such as are kept by par∣ticular
Persons, such as the Guardian's Daughter;
and these are so far from being imputed infamous
or contemptible, that they are envy'd by their
Companions, and are esteem'd (as they say them∣selves)
if not <HI>Donne Honorate,</HI> at least <HI>Donne de
proposito.</HI> And besides, they have this Advantage,
that they can easily find a Husband after they
have gain'd Seven or Eight hundred <HI>Ducats;</HI> for
most Tradesmen are extremely fond of such con∣siderable
Fortunes. The other sort of Curtezans
are such as prostitute themselves to all Comers, and
expose their Bodies indifferently to all sorts of
Persons. And even these, tho' they must for ever
despair of retrieving their Honour by Matrimo∣ny,
disown the Name of <HI>Putane,</HI> and call them∣selves
<HI>Donne d'amore.</HI></P>
<P>But notwithstanding the extraordinary Kindness
and Beauty of the Women, the <HI>Venetians</HI> are ge∣nerally
so brutish, that they wou'd rather chuse a
Boy, tho' as ugly as an Ape, than the most A∣miable
Girl in the World. This is the predomi∣nant
Vice of the Nation, with which they are
so miserably intoxicated, that they spare no Pains
or Cost to satisfie their beastly Passions: And even
some of 'em are such Prodigies of Infamy, and
have so entirely lost all sense of Humanity, that
they turn <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccubus's</HI> to <HI>Porters</HI> and <HI>Gondoliers,</HI> whom
<PB N="407" REF="227"/>
they hire to act that Filthiness upon their polluted
Bodies. All their Conversations are larded with
those detestable Impurities; and as in <HI>France</HI> 'tis
the usual Custom of young Persons to divert them∣selves
with talking of their Intrigues with a love∣ly
Mistress, their Discourses in this Place run per∣petually
on their Masculine Amours. Nor are the
<HI>Turks,</HI> themselves more addicted to this unnatural
Abomination than the <HI>Italians</HI> seem to be. The
<HI>Monks,</HI> especially, are infamous for <HI>Sodomy</HI> as well
as <HI>Whoredom;</HI> and perhaps not without reason, for
tho' I am not so particularly acquainted with
their manner of Living, as to give you an exact
Account of their Customs and Practice, I can
assure you (and one sight of their Convents wou'd
convince you) that they assume a great deal more
Liberty than their Brethren in <HI>France.</HI> About
some Weeks ago I visited the Convent of S. <HI>Joan∣ni
Paolo,</HI> to see the fine Pictures with which 'tis
adorn'd, especially that of S. <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> by <HI>Ti∣tian,</HI>
which is esteem'd one of the most finish'd
Pieces in the World; and that of the <HI>Last Supper,</HI>
at the bottom of the <HI>Refectory.</HI> After I had sa∣tisfy'd
my Curiosity with a View of these ad∣mirable
Pictures, they show'd me the Apartment
of one of the Fathers, which certainly merits the
particular Observation of every curious Traveller;
for I must confess I shou'd have rather fansy'd it
to be the Residence of a Cardinal than the Ha∣bitation
of a solitary Friar. It consists of three
small Pavilions, rank'd in a streight Line, each of
which contains two Chambers and a Hall. They
are separated by two Gardens, planted with O∣range-Trees,
and divided into several Borders or
Beds of Flowers, adorn'd with Busts and Statues.
'Tis true, there is no Water; but that defect is
supply'd by a very fine Perspective, representing
a Fountain at the end of a long Walk, border'd
<PB N="408" REF="228"/>
with Trees. And this artificial Fountain is dis∣cover'd
from the first Pavilion thro' the second,
which is pierc'd and left open for that Purpose.
The Beauty of the Chambers is sutable to that
of the Garden; and to conclude, there are few
Places in the World less fit to inspire a Man
with Thoughts of Mortification and Repen∣tance.</P>
<P>I must not finish my Letter without giving you
some Account of the <HI>Opera's</HI> and <HI>Comedies,</HI> which
may be reckon'd one of the principal Diversions
of the <HI>Carnaval.</HI> All the Beauty of the <HI>Opera's</HI>
consists in <HI>Vocal Music</HI> and <HI>Machines;</HI> for there is
nothing in the <HI>Habits, Dancing,</HI> and even in the
<HI>Plays</HI> themselves, that merits a particular Descripti∣on.
And, generally speaking, they are much In∣ferior
to those that are represented at <HI>Paris;</HI> for tho'
the <HI>French</HI> must acknowledge themselves indebted
to the <HI>Venetians</HI> for their <HI>Opera's,</HI> 'tis certain that in
this, as well as in several other Cases, they have
surpass'd their Masters. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Music does
not please all sorts of Ears; some dislike the Af∣fectation
of their excessive Quavering, which made
one say, That they seem'd to contend with Nigh∣tingales,
who shou'd be most admir'd for the Volu∣bility
of their Throats. But I must confess I'm
of another Opinion, and I'm so charm'd by the
melodious Accents of a fine <HI>Italian</HI> Voice, that I
can hardly forbear crying out with the <HI>Venetians,
I'm lost, I faint, I die.</HI> 'Tis true, those agreeable
Transports I usually feel on such Occasions, are
purely occasion'd by the <HI>Music,</HI> and by the Beau∣ty
of the <HI>Voice,</HI> without any regard to the <HI>Words,</HI>
which are so far from contributing to the Delight
of the Hearer, that he ought not to give the least
attention to 'em; since the <HI>Italian</HI> way of singing
is extremely unsuitable to tragical Subjects: For
what Impression wou'd it make upon your Mind
<PB N="409" REF="228"/>
to hear an <HI>Orlando Furioso,</HI> or a despairing <HI>Atis,</HI>
warble out the terrible Passions with which they
are agitated, in a perpetual Quavering for a Quar∣ter
of an Hour together? Wou'd you not imagine
that those Actors design'd to ridicule the passionate
Lovers whom they pretend to represent? This puts
me in mind of the Air with which <HI>Harlequin</HI> us'd
to sing on the Theatre of <HI>Burgundy, Ha! tu vas
trahir malheureuse,</HI> &amp;c. This, Sir, is the main Ad∣vantage
that recommends the <HI>French</HI> Way of Sing∣ing
beyond the <HI>Italian;</HI> for the Music is made pur∣posely
for the Words, and so admirably well fitted
to 'em in every respect, that the Singing is more ex∣pressive,
and infinitely more touching than the
Words, especially when there is Occasion to repre∣sent
a Person transported with Sorrow, Despair,
or Fury. But abstracting from this Conside∣ration,
I'm still of the Opinion, that the <HI>Itali∣an</HI>
Music, singly consider'd, is finer than ours,
and that its Charms are extremely improv'd by
a sweet and tuneful Voice, which is no Rarity in
this Place.</P>
<P>There are also many different Opinions concern∣ing
the <HI>Venetian Comedies;</HI> for I have heard several
Men of Sense not only despise 'em as Trifles, but
absolutely condemn 'em, as only fit to amuse the
Eyes and Ears of Footmen and Porters. Others,
on the contrary, are so much in love with this
Diversion, that they wou'd rather chuse to deprive
themselves of Meat and Drink, than to lose their
Share in so agreeable a Pleasure. For my part, I think
these Opinions are equally guilty of an Excess, and
I see no reason that shou'd oblige us to run to ei∣ther
of these opposite Extremities. If every thing
that is not properly instructive, and does not di∣rectly
tend to the Advancement of Vertue must be
<PB N="410" REF="229"/>
absolutely rejected; I confess indeed, that the <HI>Ita∣lian
Comedies</HI> ought to be banish'd out of the Re∣publick;
but by the same Principle <HI>Masks, Balls,
Turnaments,</HI> and all sorts of <HI>Games</HI> must be con∣demn'd,
and the most innocent Pleasures must be
reputed criminal. But since my Conscience is not so
nice, I must own my self so much a Friend to the <HI>Ve∣netian
Comedies,</HI> that I can easily bear with all
their Defects. 'Tis true, they can neither make
us wiser nor better; but that Fault, if it be one,
is sufficiently atton'd for by the Pleasure they give
us. And I have often observ'd, that those morose
Criticks who talk of nothing but <HI>Edification,</HI> are
the first who burst forth into Laughter, and express
their Satisfaction by clapping their Hands. Yet
there are certain Indecencies which I cou'd wish
the <HI>Italian</HI> Poets wou'd avoid; and it were to be
desir'd, that they had more Regard to the Respect
that is due to the Modesty of Ladies, and to the
Rules of Civility that ought to be observ'd between
Man and Man. But after all, I have a much bet∣ter
Opinion of the <HI>French</HI> than of the <HI>Italian</HI> Thea∣tre:
For I had rather learn to know my self in the
Characters of <HI>Moliere,</HI> than to be an useless Spe∣ctator
of the Postures of <HI>Harlequin,</HI> or of the
Dreams of Dr. <HI>Balouarde;</HI> tho' if I had a conveni∣ent
Opportunity, and knew not how to employ
my Time better, I shou'd never scruple to laugh
an Hour or two at their diverting Fooleries.</P>
<P>I had almost forgotten to acquaint you with a
pleasant Custom which is usually observ'd in this
Place at the hearing of <HI>Opera's.</HI> The Female Mu∣sicians
are always applauded at the End of their
Songs; but the Hearers make use of different ways
to express their Satisfaction. If they only say
<HI>Cara, Cara,</HI> 'tis a sign they are but indifferently
<PB N="411" REF="229"/>
pleas'd; but when they are touch'd to the quick,
they fill the whole Theatre with repeated Accla∣mations,
crying as loud as they can, <HI>Mi Moro,
Mi Buto;</HI> and not unfrequently make use of such
immodest and obscene Expressions, that I dare not
so much as repeat 'em.</P>
<P>In Obedience to your Desire, I have made it
my Bus'ness to enquire into the Birth and Origi∣nal
of the late Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VIII. You are mis∣inform'd
by those who assure you that he was de∣scended
from a Noble Family: For <HI>John Ottoboni,</HI>
his Great-Grand-Father, was a Merchant, and was
not much taken Notice of at first, tho' he afterwards
gain'd a considerable Estate, which recommended
both him and his Children to the Consideration
of the Publick. His Eldest Son, <HI>John Francis,</HI> was
advanc'd to the Dignity of <HI>Great Chancellor,</HI> the
highest Office to which a Citizen can pretend;
for those who are rais'd to that Post are honour'd
with the Title of <HI>Excellency,</HI> and wear a <HI>Red Gown.</HI>
His Son <HI>Leonard,</HI> who had already serv'd the Re∣public
as Secretary to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Embassy, and af∣terwards
as Agent in that Country, was advanc'd
to the same Office in the Year 1639. and conti∣nu'd
in that Post till his Death. He left two Sons,
<HI>Francis,</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> who was afterwards made Pope:
<HI>Francis</HI> marry'd, and left a Son call'd <HI>Anthony,</HI>
who is still alive; but <HI>Peter,</HI> who had not yet ta∣ken
a Wife, endeavour'd to procure a certain Of∣fice,
which, notwithstanding all his earnest Solici∣tations,
was bestow'd on another Citizen, whose
Family had never been intrusted with the Manage∣ment
of any Public Affairs: And he was so nettl'd
at such an unexpected Disappointment, that for
mere Vexation he resolv'd to embrace an Ecclesi∣astical
Life. Two or Three Years after, the Bi∣shop
<PB N="412" REF="230"/>
of <HI>Padua</HI> gave him a Place in his Chapter,
where he continu'd for some time; but being na∣turally
of an impatient and ambitious Temper, he
soon grew weary of that Post: And I'm inform'd
that he us'd frequently to tell his Friends that
something whisper'd perpetually in his Ears, and
bid him go to <HI>Rome.</HI> These Suggestions flatter'd
his Ambition, and made him so uneasie at <HI>Padua,</HI>
that he left his Place, and went to that Great Ec∣clesiastical
Court, where by his Intrigues, Com∣plaisance,
and Dissimulation, of which he was an
Absolute Master, he acquir'd several powerful Pa∣trons,
and insinuated himself so dexterously into
the Favour of the rest, that in 1652, he obtain'd
a Cardinal's Cap of Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> X. and was af∣terwards
made Bishop of <HI>Brescia</HI> in the State of
<HI>Venice.</HI> But his Ambition was not satisfy'd by so
considerable a Preferment; for he still continu'd
to manage his Game with so much Dexterity and
Success, that at last he was advanc'd to the Papal
Throne by the <HI>French</HI> Faction, and by the Interest
and Solicitation of Cardinal <HI>de Bouillon,</HI> who to re∣gain
his Master's Favour, left no Means unessay'd
to raise this Prelate to the Apostolic See. 'Twas
on the 6<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> 1689, that the Supreme Dig∣nity
was conferr'd upon him; and his Advance∣ment
occasion'd a general Satisfaction. <HI>Rome</HI>
thought she had now a Bishop, who wou'd aim
at nothing so much as the Exaltation of the
Church and the Holy See: <HI>France</HI> concluded that
she had at last obtain'd a Pope who was absolute∣ly
devoted to her Interest: The <HI>Empire</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
hop'd that he wou'd promote the Public Good of
<HI>Christendom:</HI> And <HI>Venice</HI> was over-joy'd to see one
of her Citizens in a Condition to raise the Glo∣ry
of his Country. In the last of these Places,
especially, all possible Care was taken to express
<PB N="413" REF="230"/>
the publick Satisfaction with all the Marks of
Splendor and Magnificence: <HI>Anthony</HI> the Pope's
Nephew was honour'd with the Title of a No∣bleman,
and at the same time was made <HI>Knight
of the Golden Star,</HI> and Procurator of S. <HI>Mark by
Merit.</HI> He sent his two Sons <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> to
<HI>Rome,</HI> where the latter was immediately preferr'd
to an advantageous Match; and the former was
made <HI>Cardinal Patron.</HI> Dignities and Riches were
heap'd without measure upon all the rest of the
Pope's Relations, who seem'd, like so many Mush∣rooms,
to spring up in a Night. Their sudden
Advancement gave <HI>Pasquin</HI> occasion to say, That
<HI>his Holiness had signaliz'd his Accession to the Pontifi∣cal
Throne by a Miracle:</HI> And <HI>Marforio</HI> demanding
what it was, he reply'd, That <HI>the Pope had restor'd
to Life one that was Dead;</HI> meaning the <HI>Nepotism,</HI>
which seem'd to have been utterly extinguish'd
by <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. And indeed never Pope made so
good Use of his Time as this <HI>Alexander:</HI> But
since I have already given you an Account of
his Character and Actions, I shall only add, that
he went out of this World loaded with Curses,
that his Memory is odious to all Mankind, and
that never any Man's Death was less lamented
than his. <HI>Rome</HI> detests him by reason of his Luxu∣ry,
and because he establish'd the <HI>Nepotism:</HI> The
<HI>Empire</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> hate him as one that was their
declar'd Enemy: <HI>France</HI> is incens'd against him
because of the terrible Blow he gave her towards
the end of his Pontificate: And <HI>Venice</HI> abhors the
Memory of a Citizen, who instead of proving a
Benefactor to his Country, seem'd on all Occa∣sions
to be its mortal Enemy. At <HI>Rome</HI> they be∣gan
to express their Hatred before he expir'd;
for in the Night in which he dy'd there was a
Paper affix'd to the Gate of the <HI>Vatican,</HI> in
<PB N="414" REF="231"/>
which he was represented in the Posture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that is going to take Horse, with these Words
written underneath, <HI>If any Man wou'd send a Let∣ter
to the Devil, here is a Post just ready to depart.</HI></P>
<P>After his Death, Prince <HI>Anthony</HI> his Nephew,
endeavouring by his Intrigues to exclude Cardi∣nal
<HI>Barberino,</HI> and to promote the Faction of the
<HI>Pignatelli,</HI> the <HI>Venetians</HI> depriv'd him of the Procu∣ratorship,
and at the same time remov'd him from
the Management of Publick Affairs, and even
prohibited him to appear in the Council; so that
at present instead of a Procurator's Vest, he wears
only a Citizen's short Cloak. Yet he was not de∣graded,
but only suspended from the Exercise of
his Offices.</P>
<P>I must not leave <HI>Venice</HI> without acquainting you
with the ridiculous Opinion the <HI>Italians</HI> have of
the <HI>French</HI> Customs: They imagine that a Man
may Kiss and Handle a Young Woman as roughly
and indecently as he pleases before her Father and
Mother, and that one may take the same Liberty
with a Wife in the Presence of her Husband; and
from thence they infer, that they are guilty of
more Criminal Familiarities in private. You see
what an injurious Opinion they have of our
Nation, and especially of the Chastity of our
Ladies; and yet this extravagant Conceit is on∣ly
grounded on the Civility of our Countrymen,
who permit a Friend or Relation to Salute a Wo∣man
with a Kiss after a long Absence; and are
not so horn-mad as to enter an Action against a
Man for every Kiss he steals from a Woman.</P>
<P>Thus we see how fatally Men are deluded by
that unconquerable Inclination they have to mag∣nifie
<PB N="415" REF="231"/>
every thing. As soon as they hear of any
thing that is unusual, they instantly fansie it to
be a Prodigy, and conclude that 'tis either against
the ordinary Course of Nature, or contrary to
common Sense. I have had occasion to discourse
with several Persons that are no <HI>Italians,</HI> who as∣sure
me that in <HI>England</HI> a Man may freely Kiss
the first handsome Woman he meets in the Street,
and even that all Women, not excepting the
chief Ladies of the Court, are oblig'd to allow
such Liberties. But tho' I never was in that
Country, I'm so far from believing the Story,
that I'm confident, and dare venture to affirm,
that 'tis absolutely false.</P>
<P>I shall conclude my Letter with telling you
that I have seen <HI>Padua,</HI> which is a very large
Town, but so dispeopl'd, that one half of the
Houses are not inhabited; and that I have bought
a Horse to carry me to <HI>Holland;</HI> for I cou'd not
endure to be so long shut up in a Coach. I have
already sent my Horse to <HI>Mestre,</HI> a little Harbour
about five Miles from this City, in the Road to <HI>Aus∣burg,</HI>
and am putting all things in a readiness for
my Departure. And therefore to finish the De∣scription
of <HI>Venice,</HI> which some call the <HI>Rich,</HI> others
the <HI>Fair,</HI> and I the <HI>Licentious,</HI> I shall only tell you,
that I'm extremely pleas'd with three things in it,
which I despair of finding in any other Place:
First, the <HI>Festival Solemnities,</HI> which are always ac∣company'd
with <HI>Shows:</HI> Secondly, the obliging
<HI>Sweetness</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> of the <HI>Women:</HI> And in the
last Place, the <HI>Neatness</HI> of the Houses within.
I have often heard <HI>Holland</HI> commended for the
extraordinary Neatness of its Houses, but I'm
persuaded that even in this respect it does not exceed
<HI>Venice:</HI> For the very Floors are cover'd with a
<PB N="416" REF="232"/>
certain red Cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and as
smooth and clear as a Looking-Glass: And all
the Furniture of the House is kept in the best
Order, and with the same Care and Exactness.
Every Cobler in the City takes care to furnish
his Apartment with Hangings of gilt Leather, a
large Looking-Glass, and some pretty Pictures;
and the Magnificence of the Houses is always
sutable to the Riches of the Inhabitants.</P>
