<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>Vr moderne Geogra∣phers call all those Northern countries of <HI>Europe</HI> declining to∣wards the North; the Northern world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Division of the Northern world.</NOTE> This whole countrey (say they) is divided into two parts, <HI>Scania,</HI> and <HI>Dania, Scandia,</HI> or <HI>Scan∣dinania,</HI> by <HI>Pliny,</HI> called an Iland of unknowne greatnesse, hems in &amp; begirts about all the nor∣thermost part of <HI>Europe.</HI> This is a large and vast Region, extending it selfe from the 55. to the 72. degree of northerly latitude, above 1000.
<PB N="2" REF="5"/> <HI>English</HI> miles, and from the 25. to the 65. degree of longitude, or 2400 of our miles. On the south side, it borders on <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Denmarke;</HI> on the North and West, on the Ocean Sea, and on the East on <HI>Russia.</HI> The parts of this countrey lying neerest to the South, where the Pole is not ele∣vated above 60 degrees is indifferent temperat; the Region lying betwixt the 60. degree and the arctick circle, are not so temperate, howbeit, the intemperature of the ayre is well regulated with the fertility of the soyle, in such places e∣specially as are not covered over with woods, or rocks, in the south &amp; easterne parts principally. But the extreme, or most notthern parts, lying betwixt the arctick circle, and the pole arctick, enjoy neither a temporate ayre, nor yet a fruitful soile, and since, by reason of the faint heat of the Sun, corne could not there well ripen, therefore the wise Creator of all things hath furnished these countries with great variety of wild beasts and divers rivers, lakes &amp; gulfes furnished with variety of wholesome fishes, for the sustaining of the inhabitants lives. It would seem that this <HI>Scandia</HI> was in former times far more populous, then it is at this time, witnesse these frequent transmigrations, and, as it were, inundations of the <HI>Scanzian</HI> people into other remote regions of the world; when as partly by reason of the mul∣titude, and naturall fecundity or fruitfulnes of that people, partly by reason of dearth of corn, &amp; partly by their inclination to war and avoyding idlenes, like Bees they sought out new hives for
<PB N="3" REF="5"/> themselves and their children, and those great heapes of stones, even at this day in the most desarts &amp; woods to be seen, &amp; in former times, no doubt gathered together to cleanse the high waies, do undoubtedly evidence unto us, that in former times all those places have bin peopled, and therefore not without great reason, did the ancient writers call this country, a shop of peo∣ple: <HI>Officinam gentiū populorū que vaginam,</HI> &amp; from hence have we not only the <HI>Normans, Suevians, Vandals,</HI> &amp; divers other nations: but the <HI>Westor∣goths,</HI> and <HI>Ostrogoths,</HI> also who after many pere∣grinations, thorow many Provinces and King∣domes, whom they wearied out with their wars, at length they setled themselves in <HI>Spain,</HI> where even at this day they beare rule.</P>
<P>This <HI>Scandia,</HI> or <HI>Scādinavia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquity of the kingdome of <HI>Sweden.</HI></NOTE> comprehends under it 2 northern kingdomes, <HI>Sweden</HI> &amp; <HI>Norway.</HI> The kingdome of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as witnesse the <HI>Scanzian</HI> hi∣stories, is more ancient then any of the others, from whose Kings hath the ancient families of the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> &amp; <HI>Norway,</HI> are desceneded for <HI>Dan</HI> first King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> from whence this country was called <HI>Dania,</HI> or <HI>Danmarchia</HI> was the sonne of <HI>Humelus</HI> the 16 King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the <HI>Norvegians,</HI> in their Chronicle, before ever they come to their owne, reckon vp 25 Kings of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> of whom is descended <HI>Hwithen,</HI> by the mo∣ther descended of one <HI>Soluon,</HI> a certaine Prince of <HI>Norway</HI> succeeded him in his dominion, and haviuing not a little inlarged the same, left it to his lawfull heires and successros, from whom
<PB N="4" REF="6"/> <HI>Haraldus Harsagher,</HI> being lineally descended in the fourth degree, having vanquished and ex∣pelled all the other petty Kings, did there first of all establish an absolute Monarchy, as wit∣nesseth the ancient Chronicle of <HI>Norway,</HI> writ∣ten by Master <HI>Iohn Martinus Slangerupensis,</HI> and published in <HI>Denmarke, Anno.</HI> 1595.</P>
<P>Of this kingdome of <HI>Sweden,</HI> I purpose now to say some thing, as I finde it written in the <HI>Swe∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> History, howbeit, as briefely as I can: and speaking of the countrey, I shall say something of the several Provinces and Territories belong∣ing to this Crowne, the commodities and riches they yeeld, both to King and Subject; as also concerning the politicke government, together with divers customes of this countrey. In the next place, something shall be said of the might and power of this great King, both by Sea and Land, his chiefe Officers of State, &amp;c. and then come wee to the Kings of that countrey, both ancient and of latter times, with some of their chiefe acts, and the latter Kings alliances. In the last place is something more particularly said concerning this great <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> now raigning, and his chiefe acts, both before and since his expedition into <HI>Germany,</HI> briefly hand∣led.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or <HI>Swethland,</HI> call it as you list, although untill now of late yeeres, not so much taken notice of in these parts of the world as many other Princes and Potentates; yet may
<PB N="5" REF="6"/> it well appeare that hee is no meane Prince, nor of small power. His chiefe countrey, and from which he takes his chiefe denomination, is cal∣led by some <HI>Suconia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suconia.</NOTE> and the people from thence <HI>Sucones:</HI> as also, and with us most frequently <HI>Suevia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suevia.</NOTE> and the people <HI>Swevi;</HI> now there is in high <HI>Germany,</HI> another countrey founding some∣what like it, called <HI>Suevia,</HI> the people <HI>Suevi,</HI> and in high <HI>Dutch, Swaben,</HI> bordering on <HI>Bavaria,</HI> be∣ing a colonie in former times come out of this countrey of <HI>Sweden,</HI> of whom my purpose is not here to speake. This potent King then hath un∣der his dominion, not onely this country of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> properly so called, but also <HI>Gothland, Flint∣land,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Lapland,</HI> besides some Territories in the dominion of the great Duke or Knez of <HI>Russia,</HI> or <HI>Muscovia,</HI> as hereafter shall appeare. This countrey is a very fruitfull soyle, a land flowing with milke and honey, and yeel∣ding corne in great abundance; besides the great abundance of mettalls digged out of the bowells of the earth, and the excellency of the pastures of this land, may from hence appeare, that some countrey people of <HI>Holland,</HI> removing their habitation into <HI>Sweden,</HI> affimed that they made as much butter of 60. measures of milke there, as they did in <HI>Holland</HI> of a hundred the like measures. This pleasant countrey is reple∣nished with innumerable lakes, furnished with most dainty fishes; &amp; out of these same lakes do run and issue out many pleasant and profitable
<PB N="6" REF="7"/> rivers. This country is in the South parts more plain &amp; even; but towards the North and West more mountainous, not without great store of woods, very usefull for the fining of those met∣tals, in so great abundance digg'd out of many of those mountaines. The maritane parts not of <HI>Swethland</HI> onley, but of <HI>Finland</HI> also, are for the most part environed with high and steepe rocky hils &amp; Ilands, many of them being scarce cove∣red with greene grasse, and this is the cause why it is so hard and difficult a matter for strangers, without some skilfull Pilot of the naturall inha∣bitans, to saile neere their shore, and strangers at their first approaching wonder that such a coun∣try should afford the inhabitants meanes to su∣staine life, until such time, as they are better ac∣quainted with the inner parts of the countrey; and this land hath likewise commerce with the Ile of <HI>Brittaine Denmarke, Norway, Poland, Russia,</HI> and such other Notherne Regions beyond the 50 or 51 degrees of Northerly latitude, that it bringeth forth none of that noble liquor of the grape, which is notwithstanding in great abun∣dance brought from other countries, and be∣sides, they are well furnished with good ale and beere for their ordinary drinke.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Division of the kingdome of <HI>Sweden</HI></NOTE>The Kingdome of <HI>Sweden</HI> is divided into <HI>Swe∣den, Gothland, Finland, Ingria</HI> and <HI>Esthionia. Swe∣den,</HI> or <HI>Swethland,</HI> called <HI>Suecia,</HI> or <HI>Sucovia,</HI> into <HI>Sucovia,</HI> properly so called, and the <HI>Northlands,
<PB N="7" REF="7"/> Nordlandias.</HI> Of <HI>Sucovia,</HI> properly so called,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sucovia,</HI> and the parts thereof.</NOTE> are these parts or Provinces following. <HI>Vplandia, Vestmania, Dalecharlia Nevira</HI> and <HI>Suedermania.</HI> This country <HI>Vplandia</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vplandia.</NOTE> hath most commonly bin graced with the pre-eminence above the rest, and where the King hath most commonly kept his Court.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conmodities of this coun∣trey.</NOTE> This country is very well furnished with plenty of very good corne, the which is li∣berally imparted to these daily diggers of met∣talls upon the mountaines.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mines in this countrey. Division of <HI>Vplandia.</HI></NOTE> It is not destitute of good mines of yron, and leed especially, and in some places, of silver also, although not very much. It is againe divided into three folk-lands (as they call them) that is; shires, or Provinces of three people; and these againe sub-divided into smaller parts, much answerable to our division of hundred, and which name they also attribute unto them. Of all the cities and townes, not on∣ly of this, but of all the other Provinces of the <HI>Swedish</HI> dominions, <HI>Stackholme</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stockholme.</NOTE> is the chiefe, and where the King most cōmonly makes his abode and residence, seated in an Iland among the wa∣ters, as <HI>Venice,</HI> for the which cause it had this name imposed. By meanes of the lake <HI>Melenus</HI> it hath brought from the inland al maner of grain, butter, cheese, and such other commodies use∣full for the life of man, as also copper, yron, and other mettals; and again, by the same way sends them back such cōmodities as are brought from remote regions: and by the sea it is supplied with wine, oile, salt, &amp;c. It is much of the same degree of northerly latitude with the city <HI>Aberden</HI> in the north
<PB N="8" REF="8"/> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it being seated in the South part of <HI>Sweden,</HI> to wit, betwixt the 58. and 59. degree. Next unto it, is <HI>Vpsalia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vpsalia.</NOTE> somtime the royal seat of the adjacent northerne parts: for there was kept the Kings Court, the supreme court of justice, and there was also the Archbishops sea with a faire cathedrall Church, the which onely of all the rest, continueth yet untill this day. There there is also a famous Vniversity, of the which more hereafter. This City is seated, as it were, in the very center of this rich Province, on the banke of the River <HI>Sala.</HI> Besides these, there are yet in this Province some others of good note, howbeit, inferiour to the former, to wit, <HI>Enecopia, Sigrundia, Oregrundia.</HI></P>
<P>The next Province of <HI>Sneonia,</HI> is <HI>Vestmania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vestmania.</NOTE> in fertility nothing inferiour to <HI>Vplandia,</HI> but in mettalls farre exceeding the same: for in it is a very rich silver mine, called <HI>Salbergh;</HI> as for good yron and steele, there is there also great abun∣dance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rich Mines.</NOTE> where mines of copper, lead and brim∣stone are not also wanting. The chiefe Citty thereof is called <HI>Grosia,</HI> and commonly <HI>Westeras,</HI> adorned with a Bishops sea, and a cathedrall Church, where is also a saire stately castle to be seene, and heere may one see great store of cop∣per and lead brought from the hils of that coun∣trey: There are yet besides this, the Townes <HI>Arbogia</HI> and <HI>Koping</HI> abounding with the same mettalls, but yron especially.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Dalecharlia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalecharlia.</NOTE> although it be
<PB N="9" REF="8"/> not inferiour to the former in the abundance of mettalls and mineralls, yet in the abundance of good copper digged out of these deepe vaults and cavernes, to the no small amazement of such as are not acquainted with such sights; it doth farre exceede any other; and besides copper, the same myne yeeldeth yet great store of brim∣stone, alum and copperas. And the water which is drawne from thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A profitable water.</NOTE> changeth yron into good copper, with the losse of the fourth part, if the waight of the yron be in small pieces; and the third part only, if the pieces be great and thick. This countrey yeelds also good store of graine; howbeit, scarce sufficient to furnish those labo∣rious painefull pioners, there being there such a number of them maintained at worke.</P>
<P>Next unto it, is <HI>Nericia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nericia.</NOTE> where although there be a silver myne, yet yeelding but small bene∣fit, is therefore neglected. The mynes of brim∣stone yeeld also store of alum and copperas. It would seeme, that all the inhabitants of this countrey, are borne naturall Smiths: for they send abroad into all the neighbouring countries all manner of yron implements. They have but one citty, called <HI>Orebregia.</HI></P>
<P>The last is <HI>Sudermannia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sudermannia.</NOTE> which is neyther de∣stitute of mettalls, nor yet of good store of yron, especially the parts adjoyning to the great lake <HI>Melerus.</HI> The chiefe city of this countrey is <HI>Ny∣copia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nycopia.</NOTE> a famous port for traficke, and withall ad∣orned with a faire castle, where the Duke of this
<PB N="10" REF="9"/> countrey most commonly had his abode. Next is <HI>Strengosia</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strengosa.</NOTE> an Episcopall Sea, with a Cathe∣drall Church, graced with the dead corps of <HI>Charles</HI> the 9. of that name, and father to the most famous and victorious King, great <HI>Gusta∣vus</HI> now raigning. There are yet some other Townes belonging to this teritory, to wit, <HI>Tolga, Torsilia,</HI> and <HI>Trosa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Telga, Torsilia, Trosa.</NOTE> all very rich and commodious for trafficke and commerce.</P>
<P>The other part of <HI>Sweden,</HI> is properly called by the name of <HI>Northland.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Northland.</NOTE> Of this <HI>Northland,</HI> there are two Provinces, <HI>Gestricia</HI> &amp; <HI>Helsingia. Gestricia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gestricia.</NOTE> had corne enough to supply the inhabitants wanrs, and besides, is well furnished with yron mynes: It hath in it one very good City, called <HI>Gervalia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gerralia.</NOTE> seated by the Sea-side, as well for ex∣portation, as importation of all manner of com∣modities, and about halfe a daies journey from the coper mynes. By ancient records, it appea∣reth that this <HI>Helsingia</HI> in former times,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Helsingia,</HI> sometimes a kingdome.</NOTE> was a ge∣nerall name, comprehending the rest of the Nor∣thern Provinces; and the <HI>Scanzian</HI> Histories doe testifie, that this same country in former times, was graced with the Title of a kingdome, and was governed by Kings, until such time as <HI>Iugel∣lus,</HI> King of <HI>Vpsalia,</HI> and father to <HI>Olavus Tretelias,</HI> King of <HI>Vermelandia,</HI> at his coronation burnt to ashes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Helsingians,</HI> an ancient peo∣ple.</NOTE> the last <HI>Helsingian</HI> King, with some other moe, whose kingdome hee after incorporated to that of <HI>Vpsalia.</HI> Many other things concerning the antiquity and valour of this Nation, for bre∣vity,
<PB N="11" REF="9"/> I purposely let passe. Among all the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI> people, these are most remarkable for their great hospitality; and besides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affectionate to learning.</NOTE> they are so affe∣ctionate to learning, that although publike Schooles for good literature, be but rare among them, yet are private persons, who have attai∣ned to any learning, so forward to instruct their neighbours, that it is a hard mattter to find one going at plough, but hee can read. The inhabi∣tants of this country, are either <HI>Helsingians,</HI> pro∣perly so call'd, or <HI>Laplanders.</HI> Of the <HI>Helsingians,</HI> then the Provinces, or these: <HI>Helsingia</HI> properly so called, <HI>Medelpadia, Angermania,</HI> and <HI>Bothnia.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Hesingia,</HI> properly so called,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Helsingia</HI> pro∣perly so cal∣led.</NOTE> was formerly caled <HI>Sundhede</HI> and <HI>Nordslegh.</HI> The soyle of this country is fruitfull enough, and the inhabitants much addicted to grazing of cattle, and many of them are very industrious in making of linnen cloth, and not unskilfull in many other manu∣all trades, some being also addicted to fishing. It containeth one good city, <HI>Hudinswaldia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hudinswaldia.</NOTE> whose inhabitants transport into other countries great store of butter, tallow, hides and skins, pitch and rozen, masts for ships, clap-boord and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Medelpadia</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Medelpadia.</NOTE> is much of the same nature &amp; quali∣ty with <HI>Helsingia,</HI> but that it is somewhat narrow and fuller of woods. It is furnished with 2 good rivers, well stor'd with exceeding good fish, as Salmons especially, and it is supposed, that in former times, the <HI>Helsingian</HI> Kings kept their Court in this Countrey.</P>
<P><HI>Angermannia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Angermannia.</NOTE> although it be full of high and
<PB N="12" REF="10"/> steepe rockes, yet are the vallies so fruitfull, that if but once in ten yeeres compassed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fertility of the soyle.</NOTE> they bring forth every yeere exceeding good corne, if the unseasonablnesse of the weather, doe not some∣times frustrate the husband-mans expectation.

<P>In ancient times both the Swedish and the Goths had their owne proper letters and lan∣guage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gothish let∣ters abolished</NOTE> howbeit their letters have beene by the first founders of Christianitie in these parts quite abolished, and Latine letters put in their places. And of this some render this reason; that among these people were many bookes full of their an∣cient heathenish superstition, which superstition of theirs they thought would hardly bee quite rooted out, vnlesse as well their letters, as books written with those letters were utterly aboli∣shed. But by this meanes it is to bee supposed, that we are likewise deprived of many ancient acts and antiquities not unworthy the knowing,
<PB N="32" REF="20"/> which are by this meanes buried in eternall ob∣livion. And of this prerogative beyond all other people of Europe (the Grecians excepted) doth this nation bragge, that they never borrowed their letters of any other nation. And it is thought that if their letters and bookes had vn∣till this time continued, they might have conte∣sted for antiquity with the most famous histo∣ries, either Greeke or Latine. And therefore a∣bove all other nations the Goths were most ad∣mired for their opinion concerning the immor∣tality of the soule: concerning which opinion, although there bee left no ancient records; yea and if there were no testimonie of strangers to witnesse the same; yet may this by many monuments even untill this day remaining, plainly appeare, the which are written upon great grave-stones in this same ancient chara∣cter of Rumcke letters, as the author speakes, for in them were commonly added towards the latter end of the inscription, these words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></P>

<PB N="33" REF="20"/> mingled it with their owne, as may, by many arguments appeare; and the better sort addict themselves to learne this language in perfection.

<P>The subiects of all the dominion of Sweden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixe rankes or degrees of the Swedish nation.</NOTE> are divided into sixe rankes or degrees, differing in eminency and dignity each one from the o∣ther: the Princes of the bloud, the Nobles, and
<PB N="34" REF="21"/> Gentrie, the ecclesiasticall estate, souldiers or martiall men, the merchants and husbandmen, or labourers of the ground.</P>
<P>The Princes of the bloud<NOTE PLACE="marg">Princes of the blouds</NOTE> are commonly the Kings sonnes or brothers. The Kings eldest son doth now, according to the custome, usually suc∣ceed, and the others are called Dukes, and li∣vings answerable to their birth and greatnesse assigned them. The daughters have portions as∣signed them, yet not out of the Kings treasure, but of the subiects purses. And although the Kingdome be now become hereditary, yet doe the Kings alwayes sweare to maintaine religion according to the <HI>Augustane</HI> confession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nobility Their titles were not he∣reditary.</NOTE>The Nobilitie is divided into Earles, Barons, Knights, Squires, and ordinary Gentry.

And by reason those great men had often in rebellion opposed themselves against their naturall Kings, therefore for divers yeeres these titles were quite omitted, vntill such time as <HI>Ericus</HI> 14.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> made hereditary.</NOTE> in imitation of other Kings and Potentates introduced again these titles of Earles and Barons, and made them hereditary to poste∣rity. As for Knights they ever were, as now they are also, made for their worth and proofe vpon the atchieving of some noble exploits, and descend not to posterity, unlesse they succeed in
<PB N="35" REF="21"/> their predecessours vertues and valour. As for the other Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, the chiefest of them are those we commonly call Squires, and of old were cal∣led aff-wapu. Out of these rankes of Nobility a∣bove mentioned are elected and chosen the su∣preme ministers and officers of iudicature and other great employments of the Kingdome; and for this cause have great maintenance allow∣ed them.</P>
<P>As for the clergie and state ecclesiasticall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The clergie or persons ecclesiasticall</NOTE> it is composed of these persons following: first is the Archbishop of Vpsalia, together with seuen other Bishops; and besides these, there are yet foure superintendents, who although in name they differ from the former, yet in nature &amp; fun∣ction little or nothing; and this last is most com∣monly the highest title among the Protestant Churches beyond the seas, as well Lutherans or others. So these Bishops and superintendents were adioyned the Canons, Prebends, &amp;c. and under them Ministers and Preachers of euery Parish.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishops lived like Princes in Sweden.</NOTE> The Bishops in former times were pos∣sessors of many strong holds and Castles, and great livings, and were exceeding rich, by reason whereof they were able to live like great Prin∣ces (as at this day in Germany and other places is to be seen) by this means they became so haugh∣ty, and insolent, that sometimes they waged war with their owne natural Princes, sometimes expelling them out of their kingdome. For this cause <HI>Gustavus</HI> the 1. of that name, lest the like
<PB N="36" REF="22"/> should befall himselfe or his successours, assem∣bled the whole estates of his kingdome to take counsell against the Bishops then making prepa∣ration for an open rebellion; and by their advice and consent annexed unto the Crowne their lands and possessions, together with all their strong holds and Castles, reserving for these ec∣clesiasticall persons some part as well of the tythes as other revenues, to be for them a fit and competent maintenance. In former times these Bishops had place among the chiefe Senatours and counsellours of the kingdome, and the Arch∣bishop of Vpsalia, and sometimes also the Bi∣shop of Lincopia assumed unto themselves the title of Primate of the whole Kingdome; for the which cause in those dayes this dignity was by great Nobles sued for: but since this King∣dome made profession of the reformed Religi∣on, the clergie of highest title meddle only with Church-affaires; and now mens sonnes of the meanest degree and birth, merchants or hus∣bandmens are admitted unto such functions. And yet this priviledge they still enioy, that in e∣very parliament they have a voice as well as any of the Nobility or others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The military forces.</NOTE>Next follow the military forces as well horse as foot, which notwithstanding consist not of forreine mercenary forces: For the foot forces are culled and pickt out from among the choicest youth of the kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The trained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands, where∣of consist the foot forces,</NOTE> by decimation, or ta∣king every tenth man. After they are once en∣rolled,
<PB N="37" REF="22"/> they are not onely freed from all subsi∣dies, impositions, or other payments whatsoever, but have also a yeerely stipend allowed them of the king, who causeth certaine commanders for this same purpose appointed (being first furni∣shed with all manner of weapons) for certaine yeares to traine them vp at home, in the meane time enuring them to endure all manner of hard∣ship, and such toyle and labour as souldieours are wonted in war to endure; while in the mean time the old bands (if need so require) be emploi∣ed in forreine expeditions. And thus it commeth to passe, that although the King carry never so great an army out of the countrey against a for∣reine enemy, yet is the kingdome never left un∣furnished of sufficient defence, ready to serve up∣on all occasions, and by this meanes there is the lesse use of mercenary souldiers, unlesse upon ur∣gent and extraordinary occasion, as now in this great and memorable expedition against the <HI>Austrian</HI> house, and the whole Catholike league. It need not therefore seeme strange, that this great King hath even in our memories waged war alone and the same time against all his three potent neighbours, the king of Poland, of Den∣marke, and the great Prince or Duke of Russia. For whensoever his forces are either wearied or worne out, he is able presently to exchange with a new supply, who being already inured t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hardship and military labor and toile, are able t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> undergoe any difficulty whatsoever.</P>

<P>The fifth degree, ranke or order is of mer∣chants<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchants.</NOTE> inhabiting cities and townes. These both bring in, and carry out of the kingdome divers merchandizable commodities, bought first of the naturall inhabitants, from whence they ga∣ther no small gaine. Now these cities and mer∣chant staples have among them certaine peculiar municipal lawes and constitutions, derived from the law of the most ancient city Biria, the which about 600. yeeres ago was the seat Royal where the King kept his Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain lawes and constitu∣tions have been appoin∣ted for traf∣fick and com∣merce.</NOTE> and the chiefe staple of of the whole kingdome. Each of these cities and townes enioyeth also certaine particular privi∣ledges, and very laudable constitutions, by which it was ordained and determined after what manner the mediterranean cities should trafficke and trade with the inhabitants and ma∣ritime, to the end that each place might bee an indifferent sharer in the gaine: and besides, this laudable constitution was also enacted, that
<PB N="39" REF="23"/> the benefit, gaine, or rising of one City should not prove the ruine of another. But these lauda∣ble lawes and wholesome constitutions by rea∣son of so many wars and broyles wherewith this kingdome hath so often beene troubled, have beene by the governours of this kingdome now for a long time neglected; and by this meanes many disorders are by little and little crept into their trafficke and commerce. And therefore this illustrious and victorious king <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> now reigning, to testifie and make knowne his love and fatherly affection to his countrey, in re∣storing and repairing the ruines and breaches of the common-wealth, among many other things, did againe as it were, revive, and put life into those now almost dead lawes, and enlarge the same; the which if afterwards they shall be due∣ly observed, no doubt but these cities will soone againe returne to their former splendor and dig∣nitie.</P>
<P>The last ranke and degree among this people, is that of husbandman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Husbandmen.</NOTE> the which although low∣est in degree, yet not of least vse and necessitie, as being the very ground and foundation of all the rest, and who furnish all the others, both with food and rayment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Free-holders.</NOTE> And of these there are yet two sorts: the first are free-holders, having their lands and possessions hereditary, and out of the which they use to pay something yeerely to the king, the which payment is seldome ray∣sed to any higher rate; and withall, this privi∣ledge
<PB N="40" REF="24"/> hath beene granted them of old, that if they be able to furnish themselves with a good horse and compleat armour, being able to serve the king in his warres, so long as they, or yet a∣ny of their sonnes serve in this kind, their Ma∣nours or Farmes are freed from any manner of payments to the king; and this is the reason why many from their very cradle, as it were, apply themselves to military affaires; by which means also the number of the kings horsemen is won∣derfully encreased. Among these are also to be ranked such as worke in mynes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Workers in the Mynes.</NOTE> in the mountai∣nous and hilly places of the kingdome, who thereby purchase to themselves no small gaine, and are for the most part very rich. The rest of these countrey people are Farmers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farmers.</NOTE> who, al∣though besides the set rents they pay their land∣lords, they performe likewise diuers services; yet by reason of the great benefit and commo∣dity they make by fishing, fowling, and of wood of the forrests, they reape no small com∣modity, whereby they are enabled ro live in ve∣ry good fashion recording to their owne ranke and degree. For this is to be understood, that this whole kingdome aboundeth with lakes and rivers, full of very wholesome fishes; besides the abundance of woods, which partly in regard of their number, and partly by reason of the re∣motenesse, yeeld oftentimes but small benefit to the owners: and for the same reason no where are fish and fowle, as also hares cheaper then
<PB N="41" REF="24"/> in this kingdome. It is likewise to be observed, that in all Parliaments, the countrey people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have a voice in Par∣liament.</NOTE> this last and sixt ranke I meane, have a voyce as well as any of the others. And thus it commeth to passe, that the meanest or lowest degree is not neglected, nor no well deserving subiect hinde∣red to climbe to as high a pitch of honour, as his vertues can attaine unto.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> Of the Politicke and civill govern∣ment of the Kingdome of Sweden.</HEAD>
<P>IN ancient times each Province of this king∣dome had it's severall lawes and constitutions, whereof, as it is supposed, there were divers au∣thours, whose names, by reason of the long tract of time, are now for the most part buried in ob∣livion.</P>
<P>And the Vestrogothian lawes are so ancient, that it is apparant they were made at such times as the Goths departed out of this kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquities of the Vestro∣gothian lawes</NOTE> or at least shortly after: for there is mention made of the Goths inhabiting Greece and Thracia: to wit, that none of them should enioy or possesse any of their ancient possessions in their owne countrey, unlesse they would returne and dwell
<PB N="42" REF="25"/> there. And it is apparent that they dwelt there before the times of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, who, as he affirmed, were to be shunned and taken heede of. Besides, even before the incarnation of our Lord and Saviour, they were such a terror to the Romans, that they were by them much hindered from inlarging their dominion beyond the Da∣nubius. Now these lawes doe for the most part agree with the lawes of the Visigoths, set down by <HI>Isidorus,</HI> although they be farre shorter; for the which cause it is not unlike that these same lawes of <HI>Isidrus</HI> were at the first collected out of the constitutions of the Vestrogoths, and after, as the titles testifie enlarged by the kings of the Visigoths of Spaine. Out of all these Provincial lawes and other constitutions of this kingdome, did the Bishops and Senatours thereof above 270 yeares agoe compile this generall law, very agreeable to the law of nature, and not much differing from the civill law, but that by this controverted cases are far speedilier ended. But before we speake any thing concerning their lawes, we will premit some generalities. In this kingdome therefore there are severall principall colledges or societies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole government of this king∣dome com∣prehended in certaine soci∣eties or col∣ledges.</NOTE> which comprehend the whole government of the same.</P>
<P>The first of these is called the Colledge of Iu∣stice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Colledge or societie of Iustice.</NOTE> in the wihch are three degrees or rankes: the supreame, the middle most, and lowest of all. In this supreame or highest ranke or order, are the noble Senators of the kingdome: in the
<PB N="43" REF="25"/> next are such as they call Lagman; and in La∣tin Nomophylaces, as if we should say; Recorders or Registers. In the third ranke or order are the Iudges of particular cities or townes, being men of good esteeme, and of honest life and con∣versation, and not unskilfull in the lawes of the land. In this supreame court are iudged causes of the whole kingdome, as well criminall as ciuill; and to this supreame court, the subiect may from any inferiour Court of the kingdome appeale, whereas they determine and iudge whether the inferiour court hath iudged right or no; and from this court there is no appeale, un∣lesse it be to the king himselfe, in whose power it is either to qualifie the punishment, or to re∣mit the offence. Vnder this suprame court are immediatly subiected and subordinate two o∣thers, that of criminall causes, and that of the court or chamber.</P>
<P>The next to this colledge is the colledge of war, wherein are handled all Martiall or Mili∣tary affaires, and is called the Court marshall or martiall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Colledge or societie is that of warre, or court Marshall.</NOTE> To this court belongs the Councell of War. wherein are all military matters deli∣berated and discussed: and over this court pre∣sides the great Marshall of the kingdome. His office is, when the king cannot be present in his owne person, as generall to command over the whole army.</P>
<P>This great officer hath with him ioyned di∣uers other associates and collegues, amongst
<PB N="44" REF="26"/> whom is chiefly he whom they call <HI>Riick-scirs Siigmeister,</HI> as much to say, as master of the Or∣dnance. Besides, there is also a field marshall, and under him many other commanders, both of the horse and foot forces.</P>
<P>The third colledge or court is that of the Chan∣cerie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Colledge, the court of the Chancery</NOTE> in which are handled all manner of causes both civill and ecclesiasticall. In this Court presides the Lord Chancellour of the kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Chancellours office.</NOTE> who hath the chiefe charge of the broad seale, receiveth and readeth all letters sent to the king, and dispatcheth answers. Besides, in the coun∣sell he propoundeth such heads as they are to consult about: and withall he hath the charge of setting downe and publishing all Proclamati∣ons; all decrees and acts of Parliament. Hee is also Iudge of al private complaints and appeales from inferiour courts to the King: and finally, he hath the oversight of all the Secretaries, Clerkes, Religious persons, and ecclesiasticall ceremonies; and all controversies and negotiati∣ons with forreine Princes, war, peace, and truce receiving messages from forreine Ambassadors, and dispatching their answers. This great offi∣cer hath ioyned with him for associates or col∣legues, a Vice-chancellour: and divers counsel∣lers of the Chancerie, besides the kings Secreta∣ries, with divers others.</P>
<P>The fourth Colledge or Court is that of the Admiraltie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Colledge, the Admirall court.</NOTE> over which is the great Lord Ad∣mirall; whose office is to oversee the Navy roy∣all,
<PB N="45" REF="26"/> and to see that it be in a readinesse, with all things thereto belonging, against the time of need. He hath under him a Vice-admirall, be∣sides Captaines and Commanders of every ship. To his court belong all causes concerning tres∣passes against constitutions made for the preser∣vation of the Navy-royal, and many other things concerning maritime affaires.</P>
<P>The fifth and last is the Exchequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 Colledge is the Exche∣quer.</NOTE> or, as the French call it, the chamber of accounts, where are received all the revenues belonging to the crowne, tributes, customes, subsidies, &amp;c. Over this Court presides the Lord Treasurer of the kingdome, who hath also ioyned with him in commission two others of the Nobility; and to this court belong also a number of clerks, who are chosen out of the inferiour ranke of people. He hath also under his custodie the royall en∣signes of the kingdome, the apple, the crowne, the scepter, and the sword. He payes also all the kings armie, and so doth hee all the kings ser∣vants their wages, In a word hee takes all, and payes all, being accomptable to no body, but to the king himselfe.</P>
<P>Amongst all the great officers of the kingdome, the Lord Marshall is accounted the chiefe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Marshals of∣fice.</NOTE> be∣ing master of the kings houshold, and admini∣strator or orderer of the great counsell; who by the kings authority, hath power to assemble the whole States of the land, to command silence and attention, to give leave to speake in Parlia∣ment,
<PB N="46" REF="27"/> to welcome ofrreine Embassadours, and to provide things necessary for their entertain∣ment. To his office also it belongeth to remove out of the counsell such as belong not thereunto, and to see the kings decrees, concerning mat∣ters of defamation, and punishment of death du∣ly put in execution. Hee supplyes also the place of the master of the ceremonies, and suppresseth all tumults and disorders. To him belongeth al∣so the oversight of the kings houshold and do∣mesticall servants, and to correct the offenders. And finally, in all publike meetings he beares the great staffe before the king.</P>
<P>Next unto him in dignitie is esteemed the great Lord Constable, the field Marshall, the great Sewer, the Lord Chamberlaine, &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Particular di∣vision of he Provinces in∣to smaller parts.</NOTE>Moreover, this whole kingdome is not onely divided into severall Provinces, Duchies, and Counties, but besides each Province is againe subdivided into certaine territories or iurisdi∣ctions, commonly called Haradh, of the which, some containe moe, and some fewer parishes. Each Province againe hath its governor or lieu∣tenant called Landz-herren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Severall Iudges.</NOTE> or State-haller; and each territorie or iurisdiction hath a Iudge called Leensman; and besides, each parish hath a Iudge called Nembdarius, or Nembde∣mannus. Now all these are distinct offices, and subordinate one to another, and so may the plan∣tife appeale from one inferiour court, to a next superiour in due order and forme.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>
<P>The supreame governour or magistrate of the Province is called Legifer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The supreame Iudge <HI>Legifer</HI></NOTE> as it were a law-gi∣ver and iudge, and are esteemed in dignity next unto the king, as being his iudges and uice-ge∣rents. Now as many as are the Provinces, as many are there of these supreame iudges: to eleven, under whom are againe above 300. Vi∣counties, or particular iurisdictions; not unlike the courts of Parliament of France, and the mul∣titude of presidiall courts. But the difference is, that these supreame Iudges visit every yeare a great part of their Province, untill all their Pro∣uinces be visited, and when they have travelled the round, they returne againe where they first began (which the French Parliaments doe not) much after the manner of the Iudges circuits in this kingdome. And as this course is very con∣venient for the remedying of the publike disea∣ses of the kingdome; so is it also some ease to the subiect, these iudges demanding the tribute and taxes by turnes, and not all at once, of such territories and parishes as they visit, that so the people be not all burdened at one and the same time.</P>
<P>It is yet further to be observed, that by the ancient customes and constitutions of this king∣dome, besides all these aforementioned courts, there was yet one generall court commanded to be kept in foure eminent places of the king∣dome once or twice a yeere, for determining and finishing some cases, which by the other
<PB N="48" REF="28"/> Iudges had not beene, or could not so well be de∣cided. And this they call <HI>Iudicium Pratoriale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudicium praetoriale.</NOTE> which was a meeting of many Iudges together, where controversies were duely and strictly ex∣amined, and sentence according to equity pro∣nounced. This court was by <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth, father to this now reigning king <HI>Gustavus Adol∣phus</HI> ordeined to be kept twice a yeere, once in Vpsalia, in winter at the time of a great faire then kept; and the other about Saint <HI>Peters</HI> day in summer. The Iudges were without faile to appeare at the place appointed in proper person sixe weekes after the publication of such a mee∣ting. Now whatsoever was in this pretoriall court determined betwixt party and party, was to stand firme and inviolable for ever without appeale to any other court whatsoever.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ral or Court Royal.</NOTE>And because the king will be sure, that iustice be duely executed in all his dominions, there∣fore besides all these former courts, there is yet another great and solemne court sometimes kept, called the court Royall or Ral; whereas either the king in proper person, or else a depu∣ty or speciall commissioner heares all the grie∣vances betwixt party and party: and this is a court of reformation, wherin some things which in other courts have not beene so well ordered, are here reformed and amended. And this court I take to be much like that solemne court some∣times kept in the kingdome of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustice heire of Scotland.</NOTE> called the Iustice aire, wherein very small offences
<PB N="49" REF="28"/> were severely punished. Now the king is sixe weekes before the time of sitting to intimate the fame to his subiects. And within 14 dayes af∣ter, whosoever hath a complaint against any, he must cause summon his adversary to appeare at the day and place appointed by the kings letters, to that purpose to bee read in the first <HI>Plac it</HI> or Court; or where there is none kept, then at the next Parish Church. Now if any upon this sum∣mons shall refuse to appeare, the king or his vicegerent, shall notwithstanding his non-ap∣pearance, (unlesse very iust cause may bee shew∣ed) proceed to sentence against him.</P>
<P>Now as concerning their particular lawes, statutes, and ordinances, the times and turnes of their meetings in Courrts of Iustice, the manner of choosing their Iudges, their oaths, and what by them to be observed, as being too long and tedious for this short tractate, I willingly passe by. But if any be desirous to know their particu∣lar statute lawes, he may have recourse to their history, and such as have of set purpose collected and set them downe in order. I proceed now to speake of the might and power of this great king, and then by what meanes it is maintained.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the might and power of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as well by Sea as by land.</HEAD>
<P>ANd first for his sea forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea forces</NOTE> it is certaine that the king of Sweden (besides his gallies and small ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of ships.</NOTE> whereof in those seas he possesseth no small number) hath beene many yeeres agoe furnished with fifty brave war-ships, upon all occasions ready for service; and many of them furnished with 60. 70. or 80. great peeces of brasse Ordnance; and now questionlesse hee is furnished with a farre greater number. Neither yet is it any hard matter for him to make vp the number of 6000 saile within his dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of Mariners and sailers.</NOTE> not of rowers and ordinary watermen I meane, but even of expert sailers, pilots, masters of ships, masters mates, &amp;c. For all that tract about the sea coast of Finland, being at least 40, miles in length, together with the coast of the Redeucke sea twice as long, besides a number of Ilands af∣ford the inhabitants daily meanes of no small commerce and traffiking by sea; by which means the marriners may easily become both bold and expert. Besides, their maintenance is not very
<PB N="51" REF="29"/> chargeable to the king: for the most of their pay is in fish, flesh, butter and cheese, ryce and barly, such commodities as many of his coun∣tries yeeld him for tribute. These ships in time of peace use to be distributed into divers parts of the kingdom. The greatest cōmonly ly in Stock∣holme haven, which Port is so fenced against all winds, that there they may safely ride against all winds without any anchors: besides, that there they are also free from any hostile invasion, there being no accesse thither for any ships but by 24. miles sailing, and that by a number of dangerous rockes. The rest of those ships are dispersed into divers other harbours, especially those of Finland, that so they may be alwayes in a readi∣nesse, if peradventure the Russian should make any sudden stirre. Some of them a∣gaine are bestowed in such ports and haven townes whereas they may inhibite the importa∣tion of such commodities out of high Germany, as might tend to the ruine of the kingdome: and therefore the kings maiesty suffereth no ship to come from thence, unlesse they have first a passe granted them, subscribed with his maiesties owne hand; the which the Merchants of Lubeck often purchase at a round rate. And to conclude, this king is very powerfull by sea.</P>
<P>And no lesse powerfull is he also by land:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His land for∣ces.</NOTE> for he is able in a short space from among his owne subiects to raise a great armie of foot, who by reason of their frequent conflicts sometimes
<PB N="52" REF="30"/> with the Dane, sometimes with the Russian, but especially with the Polonian, have purchased un∣to themselves no small experience in military affaire, having infinitely improved the valour and prowesse derived unto them by their an∣cestours.</P>
<P>This king may in a fortnights space call out twelve legions of well experienced souldiers, (reckoning three thousand to a legion) and may carry them whither he list out of the kingdome, yea if it were even to the very Indians, neither yet is he unfurnished of choice, able, and skilfull horsemen as well in Sweden as in Finland, both these countries being well furnished with excee∣ding good horses; the which how farre in bulke of body inferiour to those of high Germany, and other nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The horses not bigge in bulke.</NOTE> so farre perhaps doe they againe surpasse them in bountie. And in truth they are very stout, and in consideration of their low sta∣ture, exceeding strong, being accustomed to hard labour, and easily undergoing any tra∣vell or toile, and withall contented with any food.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This king hi∣reth com∣monly his horsemen.</NOTE>The lownesse of their stature hath beene the sole cause that heretofore this king hath most commonly hyred his horsemen out of high Germany, when he was to wage warre against a∣ny potent enemy. Now how great forces both of horse, &amp; foot, this mighty Prince is able to bring into the field, may not onely by his late war a∣gainst the Polonian, but by this late and last ex∣pedition
<PB N="53" REF="30"/> into Germany, undertaken for the free∣ing of many distressed Princes and people from the tyranny of the <HI>Austrian</HI> house, and restoring them againe to their ancient inheritances, easi∣ly be evidenced and witnessed unto us. After a∣ges no doubt will stand amazed at the multitude of his valiant acts, with so great celerity, valour, and magnanimitie atchieved in so short a time, who may well with that great conquerour <HI>Iuli∣us Cesar,</HI> say, <HI>veni, vidi, vici;</HI> and gratefull poste∣ritie will eternize his name so long as sunne and moone shall endure, and blesse the time that so pious and prosperous a Prince was borne to the Christian world. Many things were some yeeres agoe related to the Pope by his <HI>Nuncio</HI> concer∣ning the multitude and distribution of the mili∣tary forces of this kingdome; concerning their pay also, military discipline, &amp;c. all which, al∣though since that time much improoued, yet for the present I let passe, and proceed to other matters.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of customes and tribute belonging to the king of <HI>Sweden.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOw to maintaine all this great charge of warre and other expences, there must bee some meanes whereby it may bee effected.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customes threefold.</NOTE> For this purpose therfore there are certaine tributes and customes yeerely paid into the kings coffers: and these are of three sorts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customes a∣rising from his mynes.</NOTE> The first sort of tri∣bute is that which is raised of his mines; out of the which not onely are digged iron, copper and lead in great abundance, but even silver also, of the which are coined the Swedish dollors, for finenesse of mettall inferior to no other silver whatsoever. Now some of these Mynes are digged at the kings owne cost and charges, and some at the cost of private persons.</P>
<P>Of the first the king hath the whole benefit, and of the latter but the tenth part, as of other commodities.</P>
<P>Of two copper Mines onely, at this time the king receives a very great benefit; and besides, by reason of this abundance of brasse and cop∣per, it commeth to passe that hee is so well able to furnish himselfe with brasse Ordnance; and
<PB N="55" REF="31"/> that not for his Castles and Forts onely, but for his Ships also;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great num∣ber of brasse Ordnance.</NOTE> the sum whereof is no lesse then 8000. at the least: and in the Castle of Stocke∣holme alone, there are at least 400. great pieces of brasse Ordnance and more might yet be made if there were any need. And if the country peo∣ple did not oftentimes conceal some mines new∣ly found out, the profit which would arise out of these mynes would amount to a farre greater summe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customes &amp; revenues ari∣sing from the fruits of the earth.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next way by which the kings revenues are increased, is from the fruits of the earth, and his customes as well by sea as by land: for the king hath the tythes of all manner of graine, wheate, rye, barly, &amp;c. as also of butter &amp; cheese of beasts, hides, fish, and the like; the certainty of which reuenues although it be not to us assu∣redly knowne; yet no question ariseth it to no small summe, and as is credible, to little lesse then 9 or 10. millions say their writers: but this must be understood of their owne coine and ac∣count, not of Sterline money.</P>
<P>Now concerning his customes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customes of all manner of merchandise.</NOTE> the king re∣ceiveth custome of all wares transported out of the kingdome, or imported into the same. And that there be no want of good silver coyne with∣in the kingdome, this order hath beene for ma∣ny yeares agoe established; to wit, that for every hundreth dollors worth of merchandize trans∣ported out of the kingdome, they shall pay into the custome-house tenne silver dollors in kind, or
<PB N="56" REF="32"/> else tenne ounces of silver; for the which they receiue in present pay the worth in other small copper coine of Swedish money currant within the kingdome.</P>
<P>And for every hundreth dollors worth of wares so transported out of the kingdome, the merchant is tyed to bring into the kingdome a∣gaine the worth of 90. dollors of such wares as are usefull for the kingdome; and for these 90. dollors worth of wares, they are to pay into the custome-house tenne dollors, or ten ounces of silver, or else the worth thereof in other money. And whosoever shall faile in any of the premis∣ses, for the first fault hee shall pay 20 Swedish markes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customes of furres and rich skins.</NOTE> and the next time all his wares shall be confiscate.</P>
<P>As for the revenue and custome of rich skins and furs, it is sometimes more, and sometimes lesse, according to the intensenesse and remis∣nesse of the cold, and the abundance of snow. For the greater is the snow, the greater number of these wild beasts are taken. Out of the country of Lapland the Northermost of all his Provin∣ces the king receives a great number of these skins or rich furs. And to the end he be not couz∣ned, he sendeth thither euery yeare an officer, be∣ing a clerke, who so narrowly inquireth into the number of these beasts so killed, that very hardly can he be deceived.</P>
<P>These rich furs the king disposeth of among his kindred and friends: and sometimes also
<PB N="57" REF="32"/> hee exchangeth them with merchants, for other wares wherewith they furnish his Court.</P>
<P>The third sort of revenue consisteth in volun∣tary or arbitrary contributions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third sort of cu∣stome or re∣venue, arbi∣trary or vo∣luntary con∣tributions.</NOTE> answerable to our subsidies and fifteenes in this kingdome. For whensoever the king is to undertake a warre of∣fensive or defensive, he calls a Parliament, wher∣in he acquainteth the subiect with his purpose, and what charges it is like to arise vnto: and then the States of the kingdome agree vpon a certaine summe answerable to the busines to be undertaken.</P>
<P>But the Nobles and chiefe Gentrie, and their tenants are for the most part freed from these impositions, unlesse upon very urgent and im∣portant occasions. But if there be an extreame necessitie, and there be not otherwise sufficient supply, then their vassals and tenants are tyed to pay halfe of the taxe or subsidie, as well as those who are immediately subiect to the king him∣selfe.</P>
<P>Besides all this, the subiect is tyed to contri∣bute to the marriage of the kings daughters, whose dowrie hath been hitherto 100000. dol∣lors, neare upon 40000. pound sterling money, besides plate and other mooveables; unto the which neverthelesse the king may adde at his pleasure as he seeth occasion.</P>
<P>And whensoever the king permits any of his Court deserving subiects to any preferment, he commonly assignes him a certaine number of
<PB N="58" REF="33"/> country people who are esteemed as his vassalls and subiects, and are to doe him homage, and pay him tribute and certaine duties.</P>

<P>MOst of the Northerne nations have time out of mind had their Kings by election: as the Dane, Swedish, Polonian and Bohemian. The kings of Sweden have beene untill of late yeeres electiue. And although it was a matter of no small difficulty among barbarous nations, where <HI>Mars</HI> was more honoured then <HI>Minerva,</HI> and good literature (the meanes to eternize he∣roicall worth) scarce heard of in these remote regions, to finde out any thing concerning their kings worth the writing; yet have we the names of divers kings of that nation recorded of old; howbeit a constant and continued successi∣on without any interruption wee cannot reade of.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="59" REF="33"/>1 In the first place then they tell us that <HI>Ma∣gog</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King <HI>Magog</HI></NOTE> sonne to <HI>Iaphet, Noahs</HI> son, the founder of the Scythian nation in Europe, having passed o∣ver the Venedicke gulfe into Gothland (by the Latines afterward called by the name of Scy∣thia) reigned over those people called Gete.

And from that time untill our Lord and Saviour they reckon up 35. kings, and distinguish them all by their severall names; and many of those, for their sanctitie of life, and conspicuous and eminent vertues, were by the rude rimes of those dayes highly com∣mended. And besides these, divers other kings are yet recorded to have reigned ouer those, who under the command of one <HI>Berico,</HI> for feare of intestine warre, fled their owne countrey, and a∣mong those mention is made of one king of the Getes in order.</P>
<P N="22">22 <HI>Colison</HI> by name, to whom <HI>Augustus Ce∣sar</HI> betroathed his daughter <HI>Iulia;</HI> about the which time also <HI>Antonius</HI> demaunded his daughter in marriage, as may cleerely appeare

After those is a long catalogue of their kings recorded, but no∣thing concerning their acts worth the reading recorded, that nation then standing more upon the point of valour and honour, then upon pen∣ning of them for posteritie.</P>
<P>But farre more fortunate have they beene in their forreine expeditions and transmigrations, when as like a great deluge and inundation they overflowed a great part of the world under the names of Ostrogoths, and Westrogoths, and under the commandement of <HI>Theodoricus, Attala∣riake, Iotila, Ataulphus,</HI> &amp;c. whose martial and he∣roicall exploits the Romans highly advancing, and lest they should conceale their owne worth, have pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished to all posteritie.</P>

<P>After his decease <HI>Iohn</HI> his sonne for the space of thirty two years continued king of Denmark.

<P>This <HI>Suanto</HI> shortly after dying, the Peeres of the kingdome after great altercation (the Danish faction willing to set against him <HI>Ericus Trollus</HI>) the memory of paternall worth and vertue pre∣vailing, made choice of <HI>Steno Sture,</HI> the youn∣ger sonne of the aforesaid <HI>Suanto.</HI> Two yeares after the death of <HI>Suanto Christierne</HI> the second, succeeded in the kingdome of Denmarke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christierne the 2 invades the countrey of Sweden.</NOTE> the greatest scourge that ever befell the kingdome of Sweden, who presently resolves to prosecute the pretended right, his father and grandfather had to this crowne,</P>

<P>The Dane who left no wind unsailed to bring his purpose to passe, thinking it now good fi∣shing in a muddy water, took eftsoone hold of this opportunity, and gathering together a great
<PB N="73" REF="40"/> army, he begirt Stockeholme round about: but <HI>Steno</HI> likewise with a great army opposing him, raised the siege.</P>
<P>The wind in the meane time being contrary for his returne into Denmarke, for the space of three moneths he was put to an extreame great strait for want of provision for his army. <HI>Steno,</HI> who used all possible meanes to winne his love and savour, with all meanes of necessary provi∣sion for his countrey into Denmarke, supplyed his present necessitie, granting him free leave to returne without any trouble or molestation. But this so great a curtesie and kindnesse was but ill re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uited.

<P>This was but the beginning of the next yeres Tragedie.</P>
<P>Having then the next yeare gathered together a farre greater army then the former, he invaded the country of the Vestrogoths, and the battell being fought upon the ice, <HI>Steno</HI> being shot tho∣row the thigh with a gunne, dyes shortly after of

<P>But the same day (fearing lest afterwards in his absence the sonnes of <HI>Steno</HI> might by the contra∣ry faction be elected) having first commanded the gates of the City to be shut up, and invited to a feast the chiefe of all the Nobility of the contrary faction, in the fight of all the people, now trembling and quaking for feare, slew 94. of them, leaving their dead bodies in the great Court before the towne hall for the space of three dayes for a terrour to the people. The dead body of <HI>Steno</HI> was by the tyrants command ta∣ken out of the grave,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extreame barbarous crueltie.</NOTE> and (as some write) after he had like a dogge torne it with his teeth, com∣manded to burne is to ashes with the others late∣ly killed. The inhabitants were also by the rude souldiers, without any regard of sexe or age cruel∣ly killed and murdered, and young children be∣ing hung up, their heads were cut off from their shoulders. The City was rifled and spoiled by the souldiers, and no manner of outrage and in∣solency omitted. After his departure from thence as some write) he went into a monasterie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">More then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haunce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eltie.</NOTE> where he was entertained after the best manner the

<P>Having thus committed many outrages and insolencies, the people of the land being much therewith distasted, tooke courage, and about some 30000. in armes pursued him, now fleeing and marching more by night then by day, untill at length he came into Denmarke. Boing now so embrued in bloud, he could not refraine from crueltie even against his owne kindred, he was at length assaulted by <HI>Frederick</HI> Prince of Holstein, ane those of Lubecke, and his conscience now affrighting him, with his wife <HI>Isabella</HI> the Em∣perours sister and his children, flees into Ze∣land, which was the third yeare after the massa∣cre of Stockeholme. 1523</P>

<P><HI>Sigismund</HI> thus solemnely reiected, and put besides the Crowne and Kingdome of Swe∣den, his brother <HI>Iohn</HI> next unto him, accor∣ding to the ordinary course and custome should have succeeded: but by reason hee was suspected to bee too much addicted to his el∣der brother, king of Poland, and therefore assigning him large and ample meanes sutable to
<PB N="85" REF="46"/> his birth and parentage, they made choice of the youngest brother <HI>Charles</HI> to take upon him the government of the kingdome, who notwithstan∣ding would not for a good while accept of the regale title.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> therefore at length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">147 <HI>Charles</HI> 9.</NOTE> at the earnest sol∣licitation of the whole estates tooke the go∣vernment upon him, borne in 1550. and at first, Duke of Sudermania, Nericia, and Verulandia, and after three yeares government without the regale title, at length in the yeare 1607. accep∣ted of the same.</P>
<P>This noble and worthy Prince swore to the maintenance of religion, and the lawes and con∣stitutions of the kingdome, as hath beene lately declared, all which hee did accordingly per∣forme. The Peere of the kingdome, for his worth and valour, and many good offices he had perfor∣med for the peace and preservation of the State, were not onely contented this dignity should be conferred upon himselfe, but consented also that the fame should be confirmed to his heires and successours for ever, which fayling then was the same to return to his elder brother <HI>Iohn,</HI> and his heires male.</P>
<P>It was also agreed upon, that by reason of di∣vers inconveniences arising from this root that sometimes the kings of Sweden have accepted of another kingdome, and by that meanes often residing in another countrey; it was therefore likewise enacted and agreed upon,
<PB N="86" REF="47"/> that no hereditary Prince, and heire apparant to the crowne of Sweden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An act against the accepting of a forreine kingdome, unlesse he re∣fine himselfe in Sweden. His warres a∣gainst Den∣marke and Russia.</NOTE> shall hencefoorth ac∣cept of any forreine kingdome, unlesse he resolve neverthelesse to live and continue in the same kingdome of Sweden.</P>
<P>This noble king after he came to the Crown, waged warre with the king of Denmarke, and at one and the same time with the Russian also. For <HI>Iuan Wasilieuitz Suski,</HI> with many of the Peeres being in his chiefe City Mosco very straitly besieged by the Polonians, hee sent for aide and succour to this <HI>Charles</HI> king of Sweden; there being then great danger, not of the losse of the king and his Nobles onely, but even of the utter overthrow and ruine of his whole domi∣nion.</P>
<P>This Prince therefore sent with great expe∣dition under the command of <HI>Iairus de la Garde,</HI> Earle of Leccho, and Arch-marshall of the kingdome of Sweden, a great army, wherewith he raised the siege, overthrew the enemies for∣ces, and set at libertie this distressed Prince, and all his Peeres.</P>
<P>The aforenamed <HI>Suski</HI> making shew of a gratefull acknowledgement of so great a kind∣nesse received, not onely promised, but also sea∣led some deeds, whereby hee freely gave unto this king <HI>Charles,</HI> and to his heires and succes∣sours kings of Sweden for ever, certaine territo∣ries and lordships, together with the townes, castles, and forts thereunto belonging. But the
<PB N="87" REF="47"/> perfor∣mance was not answerable to promise: for this unthankfull persidious Prince sent secretly to the captaine of one of his castles, wishing him with some forces to intercept those deeds, toge∣ther with the money agreed upon for the soul∣diers pay. King <HI>Charles,</HI> by such an iniury irrita∣ted (and blame him not) raises againe new for∣ces, invades the countrey (the Polonian having now likewise seized upon Mosco the chiefe Ci∣ty) he takes in Rexholme, and possesses himselfe of a great part of the countrey round about.

<P N="148">148 <HI>GVstavus Adolphus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">148 <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> 2.</NOTE> borne the ninth of De∣cemb. 1594. as said is, being but of a tender age for the swaying of the scepter royall, his father dying in 1611. he being then but 17. yeares of age, was crowned in 1617. Conside∣ring then his young yeares, and laying them in one scale, and the waight of affaires lying on his shoulders in the other, we may most iustly won∣der and admire at Gods might and power in ma∣king him a sit instrument to effect such matters, as I doubt not but after-ages shall admire the same. In the yeare 1620. he marryed <HI>Mary Eli∣nor,</HI> sister to the illustrious Prince <HI>George Willi∣am,</HI> Marquis of Brandenburg, one of the Prin∣ces Electors of the sacred Empire, who although she bare him some children, yet lived they not
<PB N="90" REF="49"/> long. In the yeare 1624. she bare him a daugh∣ter.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Christina,</HI> but dyed the same yeare.</P>
<P>The next yeare after she bare him againe ano∣ther daughter, called also</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christina,</HI> yet living, and in the yeare 1627 she was in a Parliament then holden at Stocke∣holme, declared nere apparent to the crowne of Sweden. It hath been a little before related how his father <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth of that name died, du∣ring his warre with Denmarke, and withall hath beene shewed, how at the same time the same Prince had hot warre with the Prince of Russia: by which may easily appeare into what a laby∣rinth of troubles was this young king at his first comming to the crowne involved. In both these warres he carryed his affaires so well, that tho∣row the helpe of Almighty God he hath procu∣red himselfe ever since a firme and inviolable peace with that great Prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His war with the king of Denmarke.</NOTE> He had with the Dane divers conflicts, yet alwayes demeaned himselfe so worthily that he came off with great honour and credit; so that at length that great king seeing hee had to meddle with his match, was willing to accōodate his Martiall thoughts, to entertaine a treatie of peace: and so these two grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Princes of mortall enemies, became lo∣ving and kind friends, and have since confirmed a strait league of amity and friendship. As for the Russian Prince, he had with him yet some grea∣ter difficulty to undergoe, there resting some
<PB N="91" REF="49"/> strong, and almost impregnable places to be ta∣ken, and the evidences concerning such territo∣ries, as the Russian had, for good consideration, assigned his father, to bee recovered. And al∣though my purpose bee not particularly to en∣large my selfe upon all the severall occurrences of this warre; yet are there in the same, some things to be obserued, not unworthy the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ders consideration, whereof I will give but a touch.</P>
<P>After his fathers decease then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His war with the Russian Prince.</NOTE> having setled the affaires of his kingdome at home, although he had to deale with so patent an enemie as the king of Denmarke, as hath beene said already; yet did he not neglect this warre against the Rus∣sian; and for this purpose prepared a great army to prosecute that which his father had left unfi∣nished. Now it is to bee understood that these forts and places hee tooke in from the Russian Prince, are the strongest holds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it were, the very keyes of all the Russian dominion. That countrey is corruptly called Reaholme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The countrey of Carelia corruptly cal∣led Reaholme taken in.</NOTE> from a strong City and Castle seated in two little I∣lands in the mouth of the river Woxen, in the one of which the Castle, and in the other the City is seated; although the right name of this countrey among Historians be knowne by the name Carelia. But among all these strong holds &amp; castles, none is to be compared with the strong fort. Notreburg,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The invinci∣ble force of Notrebugh.</NOTE> which hath therefore hither∣to ever beene holden invincible, untill now of
<PB N="92" REF="50"/> late experience hath taught us the contrary. It is built in a little Iland in the mouth of the swift river Nerva, and by reason of the breadth of the river could not be battered with ordnance. This strong castle therefore being of so great impor∣tance, was never unfurnished. But the great God of heaven, who according to his good will and pleasure, disposes of all these sublunary things, and infatuates the wisedome of the wise, delive∣red this inuincible fort into the hands of an in∣vincible Prince: a presage, no doubt, of his fu∣ture, great and glorious victories. But the man∣ner is yet more admirable: for within the soul∣diers were not unfurnished of sufficient foode, and the enemies force (as said is) they needed not much to feare;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The strange manner of taking in the Castle of Notreburg.</NOTE> but within their mouthes and throats there grew so many great warts, that although they had food sufficient, yet could they not feed on the same, nor yet swallow down any sustenance, for the which cause they were forced to surrender this strong fort into his maiesties hands. And so he that made the walls of <HI>Iericho</HI> at the sound of a rammes horne to fall downe, to make a way for his owne people of <HI>Israel</HI> to enter this City, found out this way to take in this in∣vincible fort. And whosoever sees not the same providence accompanying &amp; prospering him in this so great a warre now undertaken against the whole power of the <HI>Austrian</HI> house and the Ca∣tholike league, I thinke is more then pur-blind. There is in that same countrey another strong
<PB N="93" REF="50"/> Castle <HI>Iuanogorod,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The taking in of the strong fort Iuanogo∣rod.</NOTE> seated on the top of a high rocke, in an <HI>Isthmus,</HI> or narrow plaine, a great part thereof being environed with this swift ri∣ver. And although on the west side, as it loo∣keth towards the river it might be batered; yet both that way, as likewise both the south and north parts were well defended by this river; and on the east there was a low valley, digged by natures owne industry, where the people had the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r habitation, the countrey about being plain and levell, and so high that the ordnance could touch onely the tops of the turrets, and goe no lower. Neither yet was there any undermining by reason of that soile which was altogether rockie. This fort notwithstanding, together with the former 2. and many more were by this same king taken in the yeare 1617, in so much that this great Prince was then put in no small feare of loosing all or the greater part of his do∣minion, whereof there was then no small danger. Wherefore the great Knezor or Duke, <HI>Michael Feodoronitz,</HI> sonne to the former perfidi∣ous <HI>Iuani Vasilienitz Suski,</HI> earnestly suing for peace, it was at length by the mediation of king <HI>Iames</HI> of famous memory effected, and in the yeare 1618. fully finished and agreed upon. And thus were those aforementioned townes and forts, and divers others belonging to this <HI>Carelia Ruthenica,</HI> or countrey of Rexholme, to∣gether with all the deeds and evidences there∣unto pertaining, resigned over and delivered in∣to
<PB N="94" REF="51"/> the hands of this king, and for ever annexed unto the Crowne of Sweden; and all other pla∣ces during this warre taken from the Russian, a∣gaine to him restored; as in the articles of agree∣ment in 18. more at length is to be seene. Nei∣ther was this king then past 21. yeares of age, when he had brought to a happy end two so great and important warres. Now after this hap∣py and peaceable conclusion, having established peace in al his Prouinces, he gave not himselfe over to his lustfull pleasures (as is often too customa∣ry with young Princes) nor to drowne himselfe with sinnefull delights; but gaue himselfe whol∣ly to beautifie and adorne this peaceable king∣dome, whereof shee was now fully possessed: which could no better be effected, then by non∣firming the ancient good and wholesome lawes and constitutions of the kingdome, adding some others as occasion required.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confirmation of the ancient lawes concer∣ning trafficke and commerce betwixt the sea townes.</NOTE> And therefore, as was already touched, he not onely rein∣forced the former lawes and constitutions concerning trafficke and commerce be∣twixt the sea townes, but added also divers o∣thers, tending to that same purpose; together with many other things, whereon for brevity I may not now insist.</P>
<P>But that he might leave a perpetuall memori∣all to the Christian world, that he was as well a favourer of <HI>Minerva</HI> as of <HI>Mars,</HI> hee hath left thereof a sufficient proofe to all after ages. Du∣ring the reigne of <HI>Ericus Balbus,</HI> the then Arch∣bishop
<PB N="95" REF="51"/> of Vpsalia, <HI>Iezlerus</HI> instituted and foun∣ded in the same City a colledge of 4 professors; and afterwards the number of professours being increased, together with an addition of far grea∣ter meanes, it was in the yeare 1476. by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the 4. erected into the forme of an Vni∣versitie, and adorned with the like priviledges, as that of Bononia. This Vniversitie by iniurie of time and devouring warres being much en∣dammaged, and having lost much of it's ancient splendour and beauty, was again by the late de∣ceased <HI>Charles</HI> the 9. as it were, out of her ashes not onely restored to former dignity and splen∣dor, but a good encrease also added to her for∣mer beauty. And this same invincible king now living, to testifie to posterity the love he beareth to learning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vniver∣sitie of Vpsa∣lia is by him much enri∣ched and a∣dorned.</NOTE> hath so encreased both the number of learned professors and their maintenance, that now it may well be compared with many of the best Vniversities of Europe; and lest it should at any time hereafter by reason of the want or un∣certainty of meanes come to ruine or decay, did in the yeare 1624. out of his owne revenues settle upon the same very great and large means, and confirmed the same in most large and ample manner, and made the possession of these lands and rents, as sure and firme as the best Noble∣mans of the kingdome.</P>
<P>This Prince, after he had lived a few yeares in peace, was againe intangled in a new warre with his Vncle <HI>Sigismund</HI> king of Polonia, in the
<PB N="96" REF="52"/> which he tooke from him many strong townes and forts of no small importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His war with his Vncle, <HI>Si∣gismund</HI> king of Poland.</NOTE> without any losse to himselfe (for he made warre in his ene∣mies countrey) both in the kingdome of Poland, it selfe, in the Duchie of Lithuania, and in the rich countrey of Prussia; so that if this king had continued as he began, and affaires of a higher nature and straine had not invited him another way, notwithstanding the ayde the Emperor his brother in law sent him, he had, perhaps, ere now beene deprived of a great part, if not of all his great dominion. The which by him wisely, and in time foreseene, he earnestly sued both to our gracious kings maiestie now living, and to the king of France to mediate a faire agreement be∣twixt him and his nephew; the which was ac∣cordingly performed the 29. of Septemb. 1629. a truce and cessation of armes beeing for sixe yeares after ensuing there agreed upon: by ver∣tue of which agreement the king of Sweden re∣stored againe to his Vncle many places by him taken in the kingdome of Poland, and Duchie of Lithuania; howbeit he reteineth still many good townes and castles in the countrey of Prus∣sia. The particular articles of their agreement for avoiding tediousnesse of set purpose I here passe by; and who so is desirous to see the same, may have recourse to the histories.</P>

<HEAD>The entring of the inuincible king of <HI>Sweden,</HI> great <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> into <HI>Germanie</HI> with a great Armie, <HI>Anno 1630.</HI> with a touch of some principall exploits by him since that time atchie∣ved and brought to passe.</HEAD>
<P><HI>RAdolphus,</HI> Earle of Halsburg, being in the yeare 1274. crowned Emperour at Aquis∣granum or Aix, layed the first foundation of the greatnes of the <HI>Austrian</HI> house. This Prince then besides that with many great lordships, partly by force and violence, and partly by purchase he much increased his hereditary dominions; the country of Austria also by want of a lawfull suc∣cessour fell into this Emperors hands to dispose of; which he eftsoone conferred upon his sonne <HI>Albertus.</HI> Into this Austria then were incorpo∣rated all these other dominions. <HI>Radolphus</HI> being dead, <HI>Adolphus</HI> Earle of Nassau was elected Em∣peror, and afterwards by the aforesaid <HI>Albertus</HI> killed, who got himselfe afterward chosen Em∣perour. This Prince likewise spared no paines, but improoved his utmost power and means for the increasing of this already grounded greatnes. And this made him so eager an enemy to the
<PB N="98" REF="53"/> Helvetian liberty, labouring by all meanes, di∣rect or indirect, to hooke in whatsoever he could compasse to make his sons great, and to advance the now rising Austrian house; yea, so eager was he in prosecuting his purpose, that he spared not the very monasteries and religious houses, but either bought out right what might thus bee purchased, or else procured himselfe and his sons to be made patrons and protectors of such eccle∣siasticall places, a faire way for future possession. But the uniust murder of his predecessor, being by his own brothers sonne revenged (who killed this ambitious <HI>Albert</HI>) and all his covetousnesse and ambition now layed in the dust;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Albert</HI> killed.</NOTE> the Princes of this Austrian house, as they had now &amp; then their turnes in this supreame authority, so were they not wanting to themselves and successors, but as time and opportunity were offered, went on in their predecessors footsteps.

<PB N="99" REF="53"/> and masters of Stiria, Carinthin, and Sirolis; and by marriage afterwards gotten in the 17. Prouinces. At length <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth (as though this house had not yet bin great enough) brought for his share the kingdomes of Spaine and Por∣tugall, together with all the kingdomes and do∣minions thereupon depending: as namely the kingdome of Naples, Sicilie, and Duchie of Mi∣lan; besides the West-Indies, and all the riches of that Westerne world, with some thing in the East-Indies also. All this notwithstanding, this great Monarch, according to his <HI>plus ultra,</HI> not contented with all these dominions;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charles</HI> the 5. attempted the over∣throw of true religion, to∣gether with the Germane liberty.</NOTE> aimed yet further at the subversion and overthrow both of true religion, and the liberty of Germany, and began to act such a tragedy in high Germany, as his sonne <HI>Philip</HI> afterwards attempted in the low countries: for the which cause to have Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the 10. for his friend, as he had before anathe∣matized <HI>Luther,</HI> so this Emperor to act his part, proscribes him. This plot for a while succeeded according to his wishes, insomuch that <HI>Iohn Fre∣dericke,</HI> Prince elector, and the Landgrave of Hessen Protectors and maintainers of the true reformed religion preached by <HI>Luther,</HI> and the Germane liberty were in open field overthrown their forces dispersed, and they themselves ta∣ken prisoners. But at length, <HI>Maurice,</HI> Duke of Saxonie the Emperours Generall, and newly possessed, not onely of his kinsmans lands and possessions, but of his electorate dignity also,
<PB N="100" REF="54"/> contrary to the Emperours expectation, turning his power against himselfe, forces him, not one∣ly to a restitution of the captives, but likewise to a setled peace and liberty of religion within the whole Germane countryes: and so it did here plainely appeare how God brought light out of darknes.</P>
<P>The Iesuites, the incendiaries of the Christi∣an world, envying the peace and prosperitie of the same, as in other parts, so in this countrey of Germany have they laboured to overthrow and subvert both the State of the true reformed Church and common-wealth. And although they have been a long time proiecting such a plot, yet could it not so conveniently be brought about untill such time as <HI>Fredericke primus,</HI> Pala∣tine Elector, having accepted of the Bohemian Crowne, being freely and lawfully thereunto e∣lected, this viperous generation, being of a martiall breed, failed not to lay hold on such an offered opportunitie; and therefore cease not to incense and stirre up the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the 2. (of himselfe sensible enough of any thing that might but in shew derogate from the dignity of the Austrian house) to prosecute that which be∣fore had been proiected. And thus was this No∣ble Prince deprived not onely of his kingdome of Bohemia, but of all his hereditary domini∣ons and electorate dignitie. And whereas many ignorant of the Iesuites farre fetched secret stra∣tagems, did verily beleeve that now they were
<PB N="101" REF="54"/> attained to the utmost end they aimed at, it ap∣peared farre otherwise. For now the fire that so long lay covered under the ashes breakes foorth, and sets upon a sudden all these flourishing Pro∣vinces of Germany on fire: and the visard now remooved their purpose, was made manifest to the blindest eye-sight; to wit, the totall ruine and overthrow of the true religion in many, yea in most places of Germany professed, the redu∣cing of them againe to the Romish superstition, and utter overthrow of the liberties of the Ro∣mane Empire: whose designes whosoever, in de∣fence of Gods cause and liberties of their owne countrey, did any way oppose, have been in most barbarous manner prosecuted and persecuted with fire and sword, and many forced to forsake their ancient inheritances to save their lives and keepe a good conscience, in still professing that religion wherein they had heretofore beene brought up. Others againe more pusillanimous and loath to loose all for Christ, yet besides, a shameful and persidious abiuration of that truth which before they had professed, were yet not∣withstanding forced to yeeld to such slavish and servile conditions, as the insolency of a victori∣ous enemy was pleased to impose upon them.</P>
<P>When this tyranny had now at least, for the space of tenne yeares beene after a rigid man∣ner prosecuted, it pleased Almighty God of his infinite goodnesse, all other meanes now failing, in pitty and compassion to his poore afflicted
<PB N="102" REF="55"/> Church, now destitute of the least appearance of any humane helpe, to raise up meanes of deliverance, where, I am sure, it was least expe∣cted, euen that illustrious and victorious king of Sweden, Captaine of the Lords host.</P>
<P><HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of the Swethens, Goths, and Vandals, arriued in Pomer, in Febru∣ary, <HI>An.</HI> 1630. and landed neere unto the Isles of Rugen, and Vsdome, at a little village, called Pennemund, with no more at the first, then 6000 souldiers. Himselfe comming on shoare, falls downe, and powres out this vnto God, <HI>O Lord, thou that rulest ouer the Heauens, the earth, and the vast sea, I cannot sufficiently giue thee thanks, that thou hast preserued me so graciously in this perillous iourney; O Lord I render thanks vnto thee, and giue praise vnto thee, from the very bottome of my heart, beseeching thee, seeing thou knowest, that this voyage, my purpose and intent tends not to my owne, but onely to thy glory and honour, and for the comfort and helpe of thy afflicted Church, that if now the time, and ap∣pointed houre be come, Assist me further with thy grace and blessing, &amp; grant me a prosperous wind, and good weather, that I may behold the rest of my Army with a ioyfull eye, which I haue left behind me picked vp, out of diuers nations, to the end that with them, I may aduance forward thy holy worke. Amen.</HI></P>
<P>The Kings Officers and Councell, stepping on land after him, and hearing such a zealous pray∣er, comming from him in this manner, could not forbeare weeping, which the King perceiuing,
<PB N="103" REF="55"/> said vnto them, <HI>Weepe not my friends, but pray fer∣uently, from the bottome of your hearts, the more yee pray, the more victory God will giue you, for earnest prayer is more then the gaining of halfe a battle.</HI> It seemes, since that time, that the Kings prayer hath auailed much with God, and how mightily the Lord hath been with him, in taking in ma∣ny countries, cities, and townes, in ouerthrowing the Emperours inuincible Army, and that of the Catholike League, and the mighty increasing of his Armie, since his first landing. Other par∣ticulars may giue satisfaction to the Rea∣der; to God the onely author, and gi∣uer of them, be giuen im∣mortall praise. A∣men.</P>
