<HEAD>A DISCOURSE Of the Dukedom of Modena.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>NTIquITY was so ignorant, as to divide the whole World into two parts onely, <HI>viz. ASIA</HI> and <HI>EƲ∣ROPE;</HI> comprehending <HI>Africa</HI> under <HI>ASIA,</HI> as <HI>Eratosthenes</HI> an Author of as great esteem as anti∣quity; some under <HI>EƲROPE,</HI> as <HI>Isocrates</HI> in his Panegyrique, and others mentioned in <HI>Salust, Lucan,</HI> and S. <HI>Austin de civitate Dei:</HI> but the most celebrated Division was into three parts; <HI>EƲROPE, ASIA,</HI> and <HI>AFRICA</HI> or <HI>Libya;</HI> and this
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>was approv'd both by ancient and modern Authors. So that it appears, Cosmography was unacquainted with any other Division of the Universe, till that the knowing <HI>Genouese,</HI> about two Centuries ago, did furnish it with a Fourth, by his discovery of <HI>AMERICA,</HI> the most usual, but improper name: for <HI>Columbus,</HI> after his ineffectual addresses to the States of <HI>Genoua, Anno</HI> 1486, and to <HI>Henry the</HI> 7<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>England,</HI> and their absolute refusal; he spun out six years in patient attendance at the Court of <HI>Ca∣stile,</HI> where at last he was furnished out with three Vessels more proper for Discovery than Conquest. And thus he first found it out, and led the way to the rest. But <HI>Americus Vesputius</HI> the <HI>Florentine,</HI> a man old in years, but young in courage, employed therein by <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> surveyed a great part of the Continent by the light he had from <HI>Columbus</HI> the first Discoverer; yet the <HI>Floren∣tine</HI> prov'd the Godfather, and call'd it <HI>AMERICA,</HI> to perpetuate his own Name, and eternize his Me∣mory. <HI>John Cabot</HI> a <HI>Venetian,</HI> in behalf of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<SUP>th</SUP>, discovered all the North-east coast thereof, and touched many places <HI>Americus</HI> ne'r saw. And although these three <HI>Italians</HI> were by three several Monarchs employed to finde out this Fourth part of the World, it is so vast a Continent, that the Southern part is to this day altogether unknown; and usually in our Planispheres and Maps call'd <HI>Terra Australis incognita.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EƲROPE</HI> as to its Magnitude, (in the opinion of Cosmographers, who run all in the same current
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>or stream) is inferiour to the other three; though to none of them, if you consider the moderate and wholesome Temperature of the Air, together with the prodigious fertility of its Soyl; the two once-famous <HI>Romane</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Monarchies; the Study and Improvement of Arts both Liberal and Mecha∣nical; the Affluence of all things that conduce ei∣ther to the Support or Pleasure of Man; or above all, the Purity and Sincerity of the Christian Reli∣gion universally profess'd in all the Dominions thereof; besides the well-regulated Government of their Realms, their Kings being Absolute Mo∣narchs, but not Arbitrary Tyrants; and the men happie Subjects, not miserable Slaves; which keeps us from that Tyranny, Slavery, Injustice, frequent Bribery, Beggery and Barbarism, which like an In∣undation hath overflown all the <HI>Asiatick, African,</HI> and <HI>American</HI> parts, when they groan'd under the Yoke of their Idolatrous and Sanguinary Princes and Governours. <HI>Par nihil Europe, nihil est se∣cundum.</HI></P>
<P>ITALY is is a Region, that, among many other advantageous Elogies, is on all hands held to be the <HI>Eden</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Garden or Paradise of this North-west part of the World. This <HI>Peninsula</HI> or Demi-Island, formerly the absolute and redoubted Empress of the major part of the then-known habi∣table World, yet may compare, as now it is, nay exceed the most of the other Kingdoms of <HI>Asia, A∣frica,</HI> or <HI>America.</HI> 'Tis situate in a most Tempe∣rate Clime; and for the amoenity of its Cities, the
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>commodiousness for Commerce and Negotiations, the deliciousness of its Fountains and Aqueducts, the fertility of its well-cultivated Fields, insomuch that in some places they have three Harvests in one year; the Uniformity and Stateliness of Fabriques, and the rare Architecture and rich Furniture and Ornaments of its Temples, and many other Delica∣cies to gratifie the <HI>gusto</HI> as to Fruits and rare Wines, with other Varieties too numerous to be crowded into the narrow confines of our intended Dis∣course.</P>
<P>And in this Paradise or Garden of <HI>Europe</HI> there is a small <HI>Terroir,</HI> or pleasant spot of ground, known by the name of <HI>MODENA;</HI> where we will take the <HI>fresco</HI> for some time, and give you our Senti∣ments upon a strict Survey of what shall occur as observable during this our <HI>Promenade;</HI> and there∣upon make some Remarques, which will prove the most useful Materials, and most conducive to the compliment of this our present Essay.</P>
<P><HI>MODENA</HI> is the Modern appellation; but it is better known to the Ancients by the name of <HI>Mu∣tina;</HI> as <HI>Livie, Cicero, Pliny,</HI> &amp;c. Some read it <HI>Motina;</HI> as <HI>Antoninus</HI> and <HI>Dio: Strabo</HI> and <HI>Ptole∣my</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> commonly <HI>Modena, à movendo</HI> (saith <HI>Merula</HI> in his Cosmography) <HI>ut quidam insulse con∣jiciunt, eo quòd Diluvio quondam tota fuerit sub∣mersa, qua de re dignus Autore suo Versiculus.</HI></P>
<Q>Mutina submersa fuit olim gurgitis unda.</Q>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>Call'd <HI>Modena</HI> (a foolish conceit) because it was once drowned with a Deluge. The more probable Conjecture is, that it was nam'd <HI>à movendo,</HI> be∣cause it is at this day somewhat removed from the situation of the ancient Citie, which the <HI>Longobards</HI> did totally ruinate and demolish.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Mutina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dukedom of <HI>Mo∣dena</HI> at present contains the Citie of <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Reggio,</HI> with the Lands and Territories thereunto adjoyning. They are both pleasantly situated in that part of <HI>Lombardy</HI> called <HI>Cispadana,</HI> or as in their own Dialect vul∣garly. <HI>Diqua del Po,</HI> on this side of the river <HI>Po.</HI></NOTE> now <HI>MODENA,</HI> was first erected by the <HI>Etrurians</HI> or <HI>Tusci,</HI> now cal'd <HI>Toscans</HI> a people of <HI>Italy;</HI> and they waging War with the <HI>Galli Boii,</HI> were expelled thence by them, who after that possessed it; and they being profligate by the Vi∣ctorious Arm of the <HI>Romane</HI> Conquerors, it was by them made a Colony, together with <HI>Parma,</HI> in the 570 or 571 year after the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> as <HI>Livie</HI> and other Historians affirm, (<HI>Quintus Fabius Labio</HI> and <HI>Marcus Claudius</HI> being at that time Consuls) who in several places make very honourable men∣tion of it; an infallible testimony that it was both rich and potent: which truth is more at large con∣firm'd by the various Inscriptions and ancient Mar∣bles that are yet everywhere extant, and expos'd to the view of all Travellers.</P>
<P>This Citie was sufficiently illustrated and made famous in those times, for the first Battel between <HI>Antonie</HI> and <HI>C. Octavianus Caesar,</HI> who was then but
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>a Stripling or <HI>Tyro</HI> in War, and not above Eighteen years, and yet made Head of a new League against <HI>Antonius,</HI> whom the Senate lookt upon with an ill eye, as a common and dangerous Enemy. This happened in the year 711, when <HI>Antonius</HI> besieg'd <HI>C. Brutus</HI> in this Citie; but by the assistance of <HI>Cae∣sar Octavianus</HI> he gain'd the Victory. The mana∣ging of the whole War was left to <HI>Hirtius</HI> and <HI>Pan∣sa,</HI> at that time Consuls. The fortune of the day was so well managed on both sides, that <HI>Antonie</HI> lost the Field, and the Consuls their Lives; <HI>Caesar Octavianus</HI> remaining absolute Commander of a puissant and numerous Army, into whose favour he by his dexterity so cunningly insinuated him∣self, and made so good improvement of his Talent, and such advantage of the opportunity, that this prov'd the Basis and Foundation of his future Grandeur. But afterwards, when the said <HI>C. Octa∣vianus, M. Antonius,</HI> and <HI>M. Aemilius Lepidus</HI> en∣tred into the Society of the <HI>Triumvirate,</HI> there∣upon the Citie had very course usage, and was ex∣pos'd to very great Slaughter, by <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, because that it favoured <HI>Maxentius:</HI> but the Victory being once obtain'd, it was restor'd, and the Christians became possessed of it; it was dignified with an Episcopal Seat, and <HI>Geminianus</HI> a Learned man made Bishop thereof. After this, it was reduced to ashes by the Inundation of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> a furious and barbarous people, as S. <HI>Ambrose</HI> relates the Story, affirming that he saw <HI>Modena</HI> with the rest of the adjacent places upon
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>the <HI>Via Aemilia,</HI> suffer a total devastation. But these Barbarians were afterwards expulsed by the Empe∣rour <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, who established his son <HI>Pe∣pin</HI> King of <HI>Italy;</HI> and then the Citizens of <HI>Modena,</HI> whose names were engraven on the gates, quitting their sad but secure Retirements, whither they con∣fin'd themselves during the distractions and tur∣moils that <HI>Italy</HI> then labour'd under, took counsel how to rebuild this Citie: and in process of time they erected it in that form as now it appears in. They being now their own Masters, free from the Vassalage of an insulting Enemy, and solely at their own disposal, and having the Jurisdiction within themselves, they onely retain'd the <HI>Romane</HI> name; but yet were not so much at rest, but they had se∣veral Skirmishes with their Neighbours, especially the people of <HI>Bologna,</HI> about the Limits and Bounds of their Country.</P>
<P>During the Distractions and Troubles of <HI>Italy</HI> between the Emperour and the Popes, <HI>Guido</HI> the Popes Legate, and then Bishop thereof, consign'd it over to <HI>Azo</HI> one of the House of <HI>Este,</HI> Lord of <HI>Fer∣rara, Anno</HI> 1304, the Pope consenting to it, upon the annual payment of the Tribute of 10000 Crowns. Since which time it hath been for the most part in the power of that House; <HI>Bersius</HI> Marquess of <HI>Ferrara</HI> being created Duke of <HI>Mutina</HI> by the Emperour <HI>Frederick</HI> the third. <HI>Anno</HI> 1312, she had the Family of the <HI>Mirandulae</HI> her Masters, by the Authority of the Emperour, <HI>anno</HI> 1319. the <HI>Bonacelsii</HI> Tyrants of <HI>Mantua</HI> being compelled
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>thereunto by the help and assistance of the <HI>Guelphi. Anno</HI> 1331, the <HI>Pii</HI> governed her, at first under the name of Captains, afterwards of Princes. Further∣more, <HI>anno</HI> 1336, the <HI>Atestini</HI> or Family <HI>d'Esteé</HI> succeeded them, who were Marquesses of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> by the Popes leave and permission; and they go∣verned it till the year 1510, when Pope <HI>Julius</HI> 11 took the Citie, and gave it to <HI>Maximilian</HI> 1, Em∣perour, by whom it was afterwards, <HI>anno</HI> 1514, hy∣pothequ'd to Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth, for 10000 Crowns. Lastly, in the year 1527, when <HI>Clement</HI> the Pope was besieg'd by the lmperialists, it was retaken by the Victorious Arms of the <HI>Atestini,</HI> or Family of <HI>Esté,</HI> by whom it was increased with Buildings, Walls, and fenced with Ditches; and grew up by degrees to the present splendour, state and gran∣deur.</P>
<P>Thus far the ancient Authors, particularly <HI>Livy;</HI> and the modern also, as <HI>Blondus Corius, Platina, Sabellicus, Volaterranus,</HI> and <HI>Leandro;</HI> besides what we finde in the Annals of the Citie, and <HI>Bologna</HI> likewise.</P>
<P><HI>MODENA</HI> is marshalled by <HI>Pliny</HI> in the eighth Region of <HI>Italy,</HI> and call'd by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> a Citie of <HI>Gallia Togata;</HI> being washed by the Rivulet or Brook <HI>Formigo.</HI> It was heretofore situated some∣what higher towards the Mountains than now it is at present, as appears by the ruines of some antiqua∣ted edifices standing somewhat distant from the an∣cient <HI>Modena,</HI> as <HI>Leandro</HI> intimates more at large.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<P>The Citie is noble and splendid, of an orbicular form, seated in a Plain not far from the <HI>Apennines,</HI> which are called the Back, or rather Back-bone of <HI>Italy,</HI> because, like the <HI>Spina</HI> in the body, they divide <HI>Italy</HI> into two parts or sides, West or North. It is beautified with a Cathedral Church, the doors whereof are worthy admiration for many things, but particularly for the famous Marble-statues of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve.</HI> It flourisheth with the dignity of an Episcopacie, which is subject to the Archbishop of <HI>Bologna;</HI> and is also adorn'd with an Academy, in which <HI>Azo</HI> the Civilian taught the Imperial Law. It is a pleasant Soyl, abounding with Fruits and Grains of all sorts, and the best Wine, called <HI>Vinum Tribianum.</HI> This Citie was greatly ampli∣fied by <HI>Alphonso</HI> the second, Duke of <HI>Esté.</HI> 'Tis populous, and the inhabitants are noble and inge∣nuous, and better natur'd than most of <HI>Italy;</HI> they being quick in their resolutions, easie to be pacified when injur'd, debonnair and courteous in their en∣tertainment and treating of strangers. Though they are ill and foolishly treated by some over∣censorious <HI>Italians,</HI> whe injuriously nickname it <HI>Modena lapazza,</HI> Foolish <HI>Modena;</HI> it being a ma∣licious and undeserv'd reflection upon that people. The females are of a meek and patient temper, nei∣ther too amorous, nor too coy; too courtly, nor too peevish; as they are in other places, for the generality: They are very much applauded also by Mr. <HI>Warcup,</HI> in his History of <HI>Venice,</HI> where he enumerates the several Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> in Verse,
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>translated out of the <HI>Italian;</HI> and concludes thus:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Foligno</HI>'s candi'd streets most pleasant are,</L>
<L>The Ladies in <HI>Fano</HI> so smoothe and fair,</L>
<L>That said they are from heaven sent to be:</L>
<L>But <HI>Modena</HI> more happie is than she.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Modena</HI> hath been the Nursery of many famous and learned men; some whereof are taken notice of by <HI>Nicolaus Leorinus Silesius,</HI> a learned and ele∣gant Poet, in his Catalogue of Learned men that flourished in his Age.</P>
<Q><L>Ʋrbs Venetum Bembos loquitur Balbos{que} Poetas,</L>
<L>Naugerios{que} suos;</L>
<L>Mantua Virgilii, Capilupos numine plenos</L>
<L>Castilios{que} Duces;</L>
<L>At Molsas Mutina &amp; Sadoletos jactat alumnos,</L>
<L>Cortesios{que} suas, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Modena</HI> has produced these eminent persons:</P>
<P><HI>Hercules Rangonus. James Sadolet</HI> a man of ex∣quisite Learning, <HI>Gregory Cortesius</HI> of the Order of <HI>Benedictines, Thomas Badias</HI> of the Fraternity of <HI>Praedicants,</HI> who were elected Cardinals by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the third. She is also ennobled by <HI>Charles Si∣gonius</HI> a most learned man, and an eminent Histo∣rian. She is the Mistress of <HI>Ʋgo Rangonus</HI> Praesul of <HI>Reggio,</HI> of <HI>Francis Maria Molza, John Francis∣cus Furnius.</HI> It hath bred up some that were very
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>much renown'd in War; as <HI>Nicolas</HI> and <HI>Gerard Rangonus, Hannibal</HI> and <HI>Guido</HI> both sons of <HI>Nico∣las.</HI> There are many Noble Families in the Do∣minions of the Duke; as the <HI>Pii,</HI> the <HI>Mirandulani, Bonacelsii,</HI> &amp;c. of which we shall speak more at large in the conclusion. But above all, the Family <HI>d'Esté</HI> who are now Lords of it; the Citie being very much ennobled and enriched by the constant residence of the Duke. Nor is she without her Ci∣tadel, wherein according to credible report there are stor'd up Arms for Forty thousand men at least: a very considerable business!</P>
<P>The next thing that falls under our consideration and description, is the Citie of <HI>Reggio</HI> in this Duke∣dome of <HI>Modena. Aemilia dein via pergenti, de∣xtra Seciae ripa omissa Regium Lepidi occurrit, ripae Crustuli laevae adpositum,</HI> saith <HI>Merula</HI> in his Cosmo∣graphy. As to its name, 'tis called by <HI>Tully</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>Cassius</HI> and others <HI>Regium Lepidi:</HI> by <HI>Tacitus, Regium Lepidum:</HI> by <HI>Strabo,</HI> l. 5. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. by <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. by <HI>Antoninus, Regium</HI> onely, and at this day, 'tis commonly known by the name of <HI>Reggio.</HI> In this place here∣tofore there was <HI>Forum Lepidi,</HI> as <HI>Festus</HI> observes. The inhabitants are called <HI>Regienses,</HI> from <HI>Lepidus</HI> in <HI>Pliny;</HI> as also <HI>Regini, à Regio Julio.</HI></P>
<P>Nor hath Heaven been more propitious to this Citie, or Fortune more favourable than to <HI>Modena:</HI> for it hath run almost the same ris{que} and tasted of the same misery and misfortune. It was at first made a
<PB N="12" REF="8"/><HI>Romane</HI> Colony, as well as <HI>Modena; M. Aemilius Lepidus</HI> who gave it a name, <HI>T. Ebusius Carus,</HI> and <HI>L. Quinctius Crispinus,</HI> being then <HI>Triumviri.</HI> It was destroyed by the <HI>Goths,</HI> when they made incursions into, and embarassed all <HI>Italy,</HI> under <HI>Alarico</HI> their King: the Citizens were constrained, by reason of the fury of an enraged and barbarous enemy, to a∣bandon it, and flee to more secure retirements and places, till the <HI>Lombards</HI> were conquer'd and bea∣ten out of <HI>Italy</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, about the year 800; at what time by degrees the Citizens returned to their desolate Citie, and began to restore, re∣pair, and immure it with a strong Wall. It was go∣verned by it self for some time in liberty, after the manner of the other Cities in <HI>Italy;</HI> and this free∣dom and liberty continued till the year 1286, and then it came under the Dominion of Earls and Princes; and 'twas first under the command of the Earls of <HI>Canosse,</HI> then those of <HI>Esté,</HI> the <HI>Caesars,</HI> the Kings of <HI>France;</HI> then it was subject to the Papal Sea, and had also the <HI>Foliani, Scaligers, Gonzagae,</HI> and <HI>Ottobuoni</HI> for its Lords. So <HI>Blondus, Antoninus, Platina,</HI> and <HI>Sabellicus.</HI> So far <HI>Morula. Heylin</HI> saith, When they were under the command of the Earls of <HI>Canosse,</HI> they grew weary of that Yoke, and recovered their Liberty; which being unable to maintain in those bustling times, they gave them∣selves to <HI>Obizo</HI> the father of <HI>Azo, anno</HI> 1292. and after that, in the year 1326, to the Sea of <HI>Rome.</HI> Passing thorow many hands, it was at last sold for 60000 Ducats to the <HI>Visconti</HI> Lords of <HI>Milain, an.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>1370; and in the end recovered by the House of <HI>Esté, anno</HI> 1409, and gave the Title of a Duke to <HI>Borsius</HI> Marquess of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> whom <HI>Frederick</HI> the 3. made Duke of <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Reggio, anno</HI> 1452. The Successours of <HI>Borsius</HI> held the Estate toge∣ther, till the death of <HI>Alphonso</HI> the first Duke, who dying without lawful issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1592, left his E∣state to <HI>Caesar d'Esté</HI> his Nephew by a natural son, called <HI>Alphonso</HI> also; between whom and Pope <HI>Cle∣ment</HI> the 8, a War was threatned for the whole; but at last comprimised upon these Conditions: <HI>That the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>should have</HI> Ferrara, <HI>with all the Lands and Territories appertaining to it, as an Estate anciently held of that Sea: And that</HI> Modena <HI>and</HI> Reggio <HI>being Imperial Feifs, should remain to</HI> Cae∣sar, <HI>but to be held in Fee of the Papal Throne: Duke</HI> Caesar <HI>to have leave to carry away all his moveables, to sell such of his Lands as were not of the an∣cient Demain of the Dukedome; and to have one half of the Ordnance and Artillery.</HI> By which A∣greement, the Cities of <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Reggio</HI> became a new-erected State, distinct and independent of any other, each Citie being well Fortified, Gariso∣ned, and furnished with Ordnance for defence there∣of. But what they yield unto the Prince in the way of Revenue, and what Force he is able to raise out of his Estate, I cannot positively determine: but by the Tribute formerly paid unto the Popes for the Citie of <HI>Mutina,</HI> (now <HI>Modena</HI>) and the rich Territories of both Towns, and the great Reve∣nues of the Dukes of <HI>Ferrara;</HI> I conceive they
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>cannot yeeld less than 100000 Crowns of yearly Income. Thus far <HI>Heylin</HI> in his <HI>Cosmography.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reggio</HI> (saith <HI>Merula</HI>) <HI>Ʋrbs est lauta, nobilis, fre∣quens; solo sita valde fertili; loco pulchro, amoeno, plane{que} regio, unde illi quorundam judicio nomen.</HI> This Citie is built on the <HI>Via Aemilia,</HI> and named <HI>Regium Lepidi</HI> by <HI>Strabo, Cicero, Cornelius Tacitus,</HI> and other Authors. By whom it was built, is not certainly known; though 'tis reported by some to be erected by the <HI>Toscans,</HI> who being expulsed, as <HI>Livy</HI> and <HI>Polybius</HI> affirm, the <HI>Gauls</HI> or <HI>French</HI> pos∣sessed it; and afterwards it was made a Colony by <HI>M. Aemilius Lepidus,</HI> one of the <HI>Triumviri; T. E∣butius Carus,</HI> and <HI>L. Quinctius Crispinus,</HI> being the other two, as is before mentioned. Some contend that <HI>Marius Lepidus</HI> one of the said <HI>Triumvirate,</HI> who divided the <HI>Romane</HI> Empire, was its Founder; others that it was built long before his time, but by him made a Colony.</P>
<P>'Tis a noble, splendid, and well-peopled Citie, a∣bounding with all things: it hath fair and spacious streets, with sumptuous structures; as the magnifi∣cent Church of S. <HI>Prospero</HI> Bishop of this Citie, where his corpse is devoutly kept; having a very plentiful Revenue, and being adorn'd with excel∣lent Portraictures, but particularly with some Pie∣ces drawn by the famous <HI>Correggio,</HI> worthy of e∣ternal Fame. In the walls of the Orchard of the <HI>R. R. P. P. de Servi,</HI> was not long since discovered an Image of the holy Virgin, held in great esteem there for its Miracles, with uncommon and super∣stitious
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>(I had almost said idolatrous) venera∣tion.</P>
<P><HI>Reggio</HI> abounds with all necessaries for the use of man; the Soil is extraordinary fertil of all manner of Grain, and all sorts of Fruits. White Wines it hath good store, and a sort of Wine call'd <HI>Vinum Hel∣volum,</HI> of its colour, being between a red and white. 'Tis very much fam'd and taken notice of, for the rare art of making Spurs, the best in <HI>Italy;</HI> and other Mechanical pieces in Ivory, politely and exactly done according to art.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reggians</HI> are a people very courteous and affable, of a good mein and presence, of present wit, and quick apprehension, vivacious and spright∣ly, and to be moulded and brought to any great or august employment. The Women, as those of <HI>Modena,</HI> are very milde, and the finest in all <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>It is adorn d with a Bishoprick subject to the same Archbishop as <HI>Modena;</HI> and hath brought forth many famous men, who have rendred it very illu∣strious; as <HI>D. Maximus</HI> one of its Bishops, <HI>Guido Sagaranus, Philip Casolus, James Columbus, Charles Ruinus, Francis Belius, Julius Scarlatinus,</HI> famous Lawyers: <HI>Sebastianus Carradus,</HI> profoundly learned in the Greek and Latine Tongues; and <HI>Bartholo∣mew Crottus,</HI> a great Poet of his time. It contains many noble Families; as the <HI>Signori Canossae, Man∣fredi, Fogliani,</HI> and <HI>Sessi,</HI> who possess great Lord∣ships there, and have very noble and large Castles for their Apartments or Mannor-houses.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>
<P>Now I have given you an account-of these two capital Cities of the great Dukedome of <HI>Modena:</HI> I will cast my eye with a retrospect upon some o∣ther famous Castles, Towns and Places within their Territories, and acquaint you with some passages and rarities that may merit the observation, and gratifie the curiosity of the diligent and industri∣ous Enquirer, that will make it his business to pry into them.</P>
<P>On the left side of the River <HI>Po,</HI> saith my Author, there stands the <HI>Arx Stellata,</HI> a Castle fabriqued by <HI>Nicolas</HI> 3. of the House of <HI>Esté,</HI> who was Marquess of <HI>Ferrara:</HI> but the greatest part of it was in pro∣cess of time overthrown by the Legions of Pope <HI>Julius</HI> the 11, and the <HI>Venetians.</HI> And upon the Bank of the River <HI>Po</HI> is seen a new-built Town call'd <HI>Rovero,</HI> a neat and large place.</P>
<P>Towards the South of <HI>Modena,</HI> under the <HI>Apen∣nines,</HI> stand <HI>Formagine, Spezzano;</HI> and ten miles off, <HI>Sassulo,</HI> a Noble and civil place, with a sum∣ptuous Castle of the Family of the <HI>Pii,</HI> watred by the River <HI>Secchia,</HI> where is also a fair Church dedi∣cated to the blessed Virgin.</P>
<P>About half a mile short of <HI>Sassulo,</HI> is the Temple of the Saint <HI>Maria Sassutina,</HI> so called from the Castle <HI>Sassulo</HI> situated at the very foot of the <HI>Apen∣nine</HI> hills or mountains on the left side of the banks of <HI>Secchia.</HI></P>
<P>Upon these Mountains stand many other Villages and Hamlets, and are plainly visible in the Eastern part of <HI>Modena.</HI></P>
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>
<P>These Castles were formerly subject to several Lords, and particularly to them of <HI>Monte,</HI> who were very powerful at that time in these Countries, and possessed all the Places in the <HI>Graffignana,</HI> which confines on <HI>Bologna;</HI> and among the rest, <HI>Sestola</HI> and <HI>Fanano.</HI> Westward, the <HI>Alps</HI> of <HI>San Pellegrine</HI> appear to the view; and the Castle <HI>Acquario,</HI> fa∣mous for its Baths, and their Medicinal waters; and from thence 'tis probably conjectur'd it takes its denomination. Then turning to the South, runs the <HI>Tyrrhene</HI> Sea, somewhat near <HI>Bologna.</HI> On the banks of the River <HI>Panaro</HI> stand <HI>Vetro</HI> and <HI>Spilim∣berto,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Spinum Lamberti,</HI> two Castles belonging to the <HI>Signori Rangoni.</HI> Four miles di∣stant from thence you finde <HI>Vignola,</HI> a Town dig∣nified with a Marquisate, subject to the <HI>Signori Buoncompagni,</HI> which borders upon the <HI>Bolognian</HI> Territories.</P>
<P>Towards the North is situated the most Noble Castle, or rather Imperial Citie, call'd <HI>Carpi;</HI> which may deservedly come in competition with many Ci∣ties, if you consider the populousness or ingenuity of the People, and the superfluity of all necessaries. It is honoured with the title of a Principality, and was for many years enjoyed by the <HI>Signori Pii;</HI> but at this day it is under the Duke of Modena.</P>
<P>Then there is to be seen the ample, noble, and o∣pulent Monastery of S. <HI>Benedict Podolironus,</HI> built by <HI>Boniface</HI> the father of Countess <HI>Mathilde,</HI> and enlarged by the said Countess, whose Sepulchre is there likewise. And <HI>Guardistallo,</HI> famous for two
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>Councils held there, one under Pope <HI>Ʋrban</HI> the 8, and the other under <HI>Paschal</HI> the 11: witness <HI>Pla∣tina</HI> in the History of their Lives, and <HI>Blondus</HI> in his fourteenth Book of <HI>Historical Relations.</HI></P>
<P>On the Banks of the River <HI>Po,</HI> somewhat farther, <HI>Brescello</HI> fronts you, call'd <HI>Brixillum</HI> by <HI>Pliny,</HI> in his third Book; and <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in the Life of <HI>Otho</HI> the Emperour: by <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and by <HI>Taci∣tus, Suetonius, Antoninus,</HI> and <HI>Paulus Diaconus.</HI> It was formerly a Citie, saith <HI>Leander,</HI> and taken by <HI>Anthare</HI> King of the <HI>Lombards,</HI> who dismantled and levell'd the walls with the ground, according to <HI>Paulus Diaconus</HI> in his Continuation of <HI>Eutro∣pius,</HI> l. 28. and <HI>Blondus</HI> in the 8 Book of his Hi∣story.</P>
<P>On the left hand of the banks of the River <HI>Len∣za</HI> stands <HI>Tanedo,</HI> nam'd by <HI>Livy</HI> in many places, and <HI>Pliny</HI> (who affirms that there was a man there 120 years old) <HI>Tannetum;</HI> by <HI>Polybius, Tanetus;</HI> by <HI>Pto∣lemy,</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and hence it is that <HI>Pliny</HI> calls the people <HI>Tanetani.</HI> It was subverted by <HI>Cese</HI> King of the <HI>Lombards,</HI> saith <HI>Paulus Diaconus;</HI> was re∣stored, and reduced to the form that now it ap∣pears in, being at present a Village or Hamlet.</P>
<P>In the Eastern part of <HI>Modena</HI> is a Chanel, upon which you may pass by Boat 8 miles at length, till you arrive at <HI>Finale:</HI> then going on the River <HI>Panaro,</HI> where the Chanel disembarques it self into that River, is seen <HI>Buon Porto,</HI> and <HI>San Felice,</HI> much commended for generous Wines. Along the <HI>Aemi∣lian</HI> way, three miles from <HI>Modena,</HI> runs the River
<PB N="19" REF="11"/><HI>Panaro,</HI> near which are the confines of the <HI>Modo∣nesi</HI> and <HI>Bolognesi,</HI> where <HI>Claudius</HI> the Consul co∣ping with his enemies, took 15000 Prisoners, and 700 <HI>Ligurians.</HI> Nay farther, in this very place <HI>Ro∣tari</HI> King of the <HI>Lombards</HI> routed the <HI>Romane</HI> Ar∣my, with the slaughter of 7000 Souldiers. Here also the Forces of the <HI>Modonesi</HI> being discomfited by the <HI>Bolognesi, Euzo</HI> King of <HI>Sardegna,</HI> the son of <HI>Erderick</HI> the second, was taken Prisoner. On the other side of <HI>Panaro</HI> is <HI>Novantola,</HI> with a Monaste∣ry famous both for its antiquity as well as stateliness, founded by <HI>Anselmo,</HI> nearly related to <HI>Astolfo</HI> King of the <HI>Lombards,</HI> who was a redoubted Captain in their Army.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Aemilian</HI> way, between <HI>Bologna</HI> and <HI>Novantola,</HI> stands <HI>Santa Agata,</HI> a Castle erected by <HI>Barbarossa</HI> the Emperour; and <HI>Crevalcuore,</HI> former∣ly known by the name of <HI>Allegracuore,</HI> where the Army of <HI>Bernabo Visconte</HI> Lord of <HI>Milain</HI> was de∣feated and put to the Rout.</P>
<P>Next you go to <HI>San Giovanni,</HI> a Country very plentiful of Wheat and other Grain. On the left side of <HI>Via Aemilia</HI> stand <HI>Castiglione</HI> and <HI>Castel∣franco,</HI> 15 miles off of <HI>Bologna;</HI> where some few years past there was raised a most impregnable Fort by Pope <HI>Ʋrban</HI> the 8, and from him called <HI>Ʋrbano.</HI> Neer this Fort is the <HI>Foro di Galli,</HI> where <HI>Hirsius</HI> and <HI>Pansa,</HI> two <HI>Romane</HI> Consuls, were engaged with <HI>M. Antonius;</HI> who obtained a glorious Victory, but withal their mortal wounds, whereof they both di∣ed upon the place, as is prementioned. Then there
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>appear <HI>Purmanio, Bazanio,</HI> and <HI>Crepellano,</HI> three pleasant Castles seated on those hillocks that are at the foot of the <HI>Apennines.</HI></P>
<P>On the left hand of the <HI>Aemilian</HI> way, five miles from <HI>Bologna,</HI> are the Rivers <HI>Lavinio</HI> and <HI>Ghiron∣don,</HI> which meeting together with mutual embra∣ces, joyntly environ <HI>Forcelli</HI> in a triangular form, being distant from <HI>Via Aemilia</HI> one mile; where <HI>Octavianus, M. Antonius,</HI> and <HI>Marius Lepidus,</HI> sha∣red the Monarchy between them. This <HI>Forcelli</HI> is now a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> though it may be perceived to have been an Islet formerly. Afterwards these two Rivers disgorge themselves into the <HI>Po.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Bologna</HI> there is seen a Stone-bridge of great length, which bestrides the River from one side to the other; from whence 'tis but a small and easie mile to <HI>Bologna.</HI></P>
<P>Now we come to the places contiguous and ad∣jacent to <HI>Reggio;</HI> near which there appear certain Hills that erect their lofty crest so pleasantly, as does create delight in all Passengers; no less beautified and adorned with several fair Towns and Villages, than delicious Wines and Fruit-trees. Towards <HI>Parma</HI> you may take a view of a Castle (strength∣ned by its site) where <HI>Mathilde</HI> the Countess pre∣serv'd Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the seventh from the snares and ambushes prepared for him by the Emperour <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, an enemy to the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> but afterwards he (being a tender-conscienc'd <HI>Re∣ligioso</HI>) repented of this imaginary and suppo∣sititious
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>Crime, and was led a Royal dance by his Confessor bare-foot and bare-headed in the midst of Winter, through Ice and Snow, from this place to the said Pope, to implore a Pardon for this his <HI>Pec∣cadillo,</HI> and obtained it with a courteous reception. A remarkable Instance, and notorious Precedent of the Tyranny, Haughtiness, and Vain-glory of his Ironical, nick-nam'd Holiness, who dares presume so proudly and imperiously to insult over, nay buf∣foon a puissant Potentate, making him foot it bare in the depth of a hard Winter; to the Idolatrous Citie of his residence; and thereby run the ris{que} of losing his life, to gain a fruitless and insignificant Pardon. But this he must do, or forfeit all his <HI>Rega∣lia,</HI> and be daily menaced with that silly Scar-crow, the Thunder of Excommunication. Thus Monar∣chy grows consumptive, hangs the head, droops, and dwindles away to nothing, and so expires; <HI>King</HI> is a meer empty name, or the more glorious <HI>synonyma</HI> of Vassals, and <HI>Prince</HI> the more splendid name of Slave. Thus the Scepter warps to the Crosier, the Emperours Hat vails to the Bishops Mitre, and the <HI>single</HI> does obeysance to the <HI>triple</HI> Crown. Thus Regal Authority, whose tender neck was ever un∣accustomed to the burden of a tame condescention, puts on the heavie Yoke of Pontifical rigorous im∣position. Thus here you see the great most Chri∣stian Ring crouch to Antichrist, or being Crown-fallen as well as Crest-fallen. Thus Majestie it self inclines the reverend head, stoops low with a reve∣rential bow to kiss that vulgarly-ador'd Pantofle,
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>which frequently proves but the gaudy covering of a Gowty toe.</P>
<P>At this day, the most Noble Family of the <HI>Canossae</HI> are Lords of this Castle, and the rest that encircle it; and a small distance from this, stand the Castles and other places that belong to the <HI>Signori Man∣fredi.</HI></P>
<P>Keeping the way on the Mountains, you come to <HI>Graffignana,</HI> where <HI>Castelnuovo</HI> is to be seen, which in times of yore was the Birth-place of many Illustrious persons; and in this our modern age, of <HI>Giulio Ʋr∣bano;</HI> Doctor and Apostolick Prothonotary, who liv'd in great repute and esteem among Princes Po∣pishly inclin'd, and was highly applauded by the Fry of the Septuagint of Cardinals, that pay homage to, and revere the pretended and triple-Crown'd Suc∣cessor of the Fisherman; who did a long time offici∣ate as Vicar-general, in lieu of the Miter'd Cardinal <HI>Linga Carnaro</HI> Bishop of <HI>Padua;</HI> and in that qua∣lity died, <HI>anno</HI> 1592. (May the same mortality and good fortune, in God's due time, attend the whole Conclave, that's my Litany.) His brother <HI>Ʋrban</HI> was Captain of the <HI>Venetian Militia,</HI> and <HI>Filippo Ʋrbano</HI> their Nephew.</P>
<P>In your return to the <HI>Aemilian</HI> way, occurs the Castle of <HI>Scandiano,</HI> dignified with the Title of a Marquisate, subject to the <HI>Signori Feni,</HI> noble and renown'd <HI>Vicentines.</HI> On the left hand lies the Ca∣stle <HI>Roldo,</HI> belonging to the House of the <HI>Sessi,</HI> a Feudatory of the Emperour; with <HI>San Martino, Gonzaga</HI> the most splendid Village belonging to the
<PB N="23" REF="13"/><HI>Gonzagae</HI> Princes of <HI>Mantua,</HI> and <HI>Muvilara.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Reggio, Correggio</HI> appears, not far from the River <HI>Lenza;</HI> a noble Castle, well govern'd, and as well peopled: it was called a citie of the Empire, and appertains to the most Illustrious Family of the <HI>Correggii:</HI> and where the River <HI>Lecchia</HI> dichotomizeth the <HI>Via Aemilia,</HI> stands a very strong Castle call'd <HI>Ruberia,</HI> or <HI>Rubiera,</HI> by the Learned <HI>Herberia,</HI> erected as some conjecture by the <HI>Boiardi,</HI> and as others imagine by the <HI>Ru∣brii</HI> of <HI>Parma;</HI> which had serveral Masters till the year 1523, and then it fell into the hands of the Dukes of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> and was made famous by the birth of <HI>Antonius Codrus,</HI> a most polite <HI>Grecian,</HI> and expert Latinist, being a man of great Learning and vast Parts. This Castle is strongly fortified with a well-made Bulwark or Rampart, and surrounded with many Hills, which adde much grace and beau∣ty to its situation, and renders the prospect very delightful. From hence you pass into a spacious and good Road, very commodious for all Travel∣lers that steer their course that way, and designe to arrive at the capital Citie <HI>Modena,</HI> of which we have already given you a large and exact descri∣ption.</P>
<P>In this Tract there are four <HI>Apennine</HI> hills, and as many Cities which are indebted to the Countess <HI>Mathilde</HI> for their foundation, <HI>viz. Bibianello, Ca∣stelvitreo, Monte Zano,</HI> and <HI>Monte Luzco;</HI> all un∣der the command and jurisdiction of the Earls of <HI>Canossae.</HI></P>
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>
<P>Having given you a court and true account of the Government, Riches, Force, Religion, Manners and Qualifications of the People of this ancient and illustrious Dukedom, as also the nature and quality of the Soyl and Climate; I shall by way of Corol∣lary close all with a short relation of the Original, Antiquity, and Genealogie of the Dukes of the House of <HI>Esté,</HI> and bring them down by descent to the most Illustrious person who at present is the undoubted and lawful Prince of the Dukedom of <HI>Modena.</HI></P>
<P>The Princes of the House of <HI>Esté</HI> have been so considerable, and so much taken notice of both in Peace and War, that <HI>John Baptista Pigna</HI> hath with much industry and learning composed eight Books of the original, noble exploits and transactions of this Princely Family in <HI>Italy</HI> and other countries.</P>
<P>As to their original he saith, that <HI>Ateste,</HI> Com∣mander of the <HI>Heneti</HI> (now <HI>Venetians</HI>) after the sacking and destruction of <HI>Troy,</HI> was driven into these parts with a considerable Navie, and built the Citie <HI>Atestia</HI> or <HI>Ateste,</HI> of his own name; and he called the whole Tract of ground <HI>Venetia:</HI> but the <HI>Latine</HI> degenerating by degrees from its puri∣ty, the Citie lost the primitive e name of <HI>Atestia,</HI> and sensibly shrunk into that of <HI>Esté.</HI> This <HI>Atestes</HI> descended from the <HI>Atii,</HI> of the <HI>Poblilian</HI> Tribe in <HI>Rome,</HI> who because they did espouse the Quarrel of the <HI>Caesars,</HI> did obtain so much grace and favour as to be Lords not onely of their own Country,
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>but also of all the Territories of <HI>Venice.</HI> And here the <HI>Atestini</HI> (for so they were call'd of old) began to b e in reputation: and these Princes do produce their Chronologie of 1200 years, to mani∣fest and testifie their Grandeur in a continued Series down to this present Age.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Atii</HI> became Masters of a great part of <HI>Venice</HI> when <HI>Ateste</HI> was their capital Citie of Resi∣dence: and the <HI>Romane</HI> Caesars being then accusto∣med to create a Magistracie consisting of eleven of the chief Citizens, and sometimes a greater number, (who were also called <HI>Decuriones,</HI> because at the first institution ten onely were requir'd) <HI>Atius</HI> the son of <HI>C.</HI> of the last Race, and the first Author of the Family of the <HI>Atestini,</HI> did exercise this Magi∣stracie there. And this the Inscription of an old Stone doth sufficiently prove, which to this day is preserv'd by these Princes. This <HI>C. Atius</HI> had two sons; <HI>Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Flavius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ateste</HI> being thus built, and the Metropolis of <HI>Venetia,</HI> was called afterwards <HI>Esté,</HI> and had four Gates oppos'd to the four quarters of the heaven; the <HI>Black,</HI> the <HI>White,</HI> the <HI>Triumphal,</HI> and the <HI>Capi∣toline</HI> Gate, in the <HI>Romilian</HI> Tribe, saith the Author. It was founded by the <HI>Atii,</HI> ruin'd by <HI>Acarinus,</HI> and restor'd by <HI>Aldoardus;</HI> and then 'twas made an Earldome, afterwards created a Marquisate, and enlarged; besieged by the <HI>Paduans,</HI> taken by <HI>Eze∣linus,</HI> recovered by <HI>Azo,</HI> burnt by <HI>Ezelinus,</HI> possess'd by those of <HI>Padoa,</HI> and then restor'd to <HI>Azo,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Albertus.</HI></P>
<PB N="26" REF="15"/>
<P>Thus you have in short a brief Narrative of the ancient <HI>Atii,</HI> the original of the <HI>Atestini,</HI> or <HI>Esten∣ses,</HI> as our Modern Authors write them; which is the most known name; and they are usually call'd the Dukes of <HI>Esté.</HI></P>
<P>The Family <HI>d'Esté,</HI> at present Dukes of <HI>Modena,</HI> which are accounted in the number of the 7 Great Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> according to the ancient Division, which are, the Pope, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy, Toscany, Modena, Parma</HI> and <HI>Montoa;</HI> they derive their Pedegree from <HI>Allo</HI> Marquess of <HI>Esté</HI> who took upon him the Surname (which the Family is known by to this day) of the Citie <HI>Esté;</HI> and still appertains to them <HI>de jure.</HI> He married <HI>Alda</HI> daughter to the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the first; which happened <HI>an.</HI> 1000. and he had with her for Dower <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Reggio. Theobaldo d'Esté, Otho</HI>'s Grandchilde, was seized of <HI>Ferrara</HI> in the year 1055, from Pope <HI>John</HI> the 12: but they were disseiz'd and absolutely dispossest of it by <HI>Clement</HI> the 8, <HI>anno</HI> 1598, after the decease of <HI>Alfonso</HI> the second, for want of lawful Issue male: yet <HI>Caesar d'Esté</HI> was then in being, who was son of <HI>Alfonso</HI> by <HI>Laura Ferraress;</HI> and he of∣fered to clear it by manifest proof, that his father was lawfully married to his mother, and he the le∣gitimate Heir. But the Pope was too hard for him, being surely possest of that which he so greedily thirsted after. And that Family still lays claim to it by a legal pretension. B ut the holy Father (and he you know is infallible) will prove him to be a natural son.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>
<P>Yet maugre all this opposition, the Duke is still in possession of the Dukedoms of <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Reg∣gio,</HI> the Principalities of <HI>Carpi</HI> and <HI>Correggio,</HI> the Earldom of <HI>Roli,</HI> and the Lordships of <HI>Sassevil, Gar∣fagna,</HI> and <HI>Frignano,</HI> by the late Treaty of <HI>Pisa.</HI> Here was indeed a dispute between him and the Pa∣pal Crown about the Valleys of <HI>Comachio;</HI> but this was not so hot, b ut it cool'd at length, and was de∣cided upon these Conditions: The Prince being to receive 400000 Crowns for them; which were ac∣cordingly paid, and 40000 more for damages, and some other advantageous terms. These Lands which we have before specified, together with those which he possesseth in the Dukedome of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> yield him annually full 500000 Crowns. All his Domi∣nions are contiguous, and joining close one to the other; which renders him more considerable; and his strength and force consists in the number of his people. <HI>Carfagnana</HI> alone (being a Province be∣longing to him) is reported to have fourscore and odde places well wall'd about, besides several other Strong-holds. He is able upon urgent occasions to lead into the Field 20000 of the Infantry, and 1000 of the Cavalry well arm'd and accoutred. And farther, he can without any inconveniencie whatso∣ever maintain and keep half of that number. His His Country, tis true, and cannot be denied, lies o∣pen to several bordering Princes; not for want of good places and well-fortified Castles, for he hath many seated at a very convenient distance; but the reason is, because his <HI>Terroir</HI> or Land lies level, and upon even ground.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="16"/>
<P>The Princes of <HI>Modena</HI> follow the general Ma∣ximes of their Neighbours, <HI>viz.</HI> to keep a good cor∣respondence with <HI>Venice,</HI> which was always repu∣ted the Protectress of <HI>Italian</HI> Libertie: but since the loss of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> they kept close to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> till their Interest of late wrought a change upon their inclinations. For Duke <HI>Francis</HI> was in the late <HI>Italian</HI> Wars made General of the French; and <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s Neece married to Prince <HI>Almerigo</HI> his son, who hath left a young son to succeed him. All things at present are managed by the advice of Car∣dinal <HI>d'Esté,</HI> Protector of the French Interest at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the sole Promoter of the late Union of his House to the French Crown. He is Uncle to the now Duke of <HI>Modena;</HI> a very active and stir∣ring person, and hath made the world speak honou∣rably of him, for his actions both in Peace and War. He is extraordinarily well skill'd in the art of con∣cealing his resentments, and understands the old Motto: <HI>Qui nescit dissimulare,</HI> &amp;c. At <HI>Rome</HI> he keeps his Palace with more pomp and splendour than any of the Cardinalate: and though 'tis very much frequented by the Nobility, and a numerous train of people, yet they are all constantly and well paid. He is a Zealot in the French Cause; by whose friendship his Family is enriched and well moneyed, by reason of the late Generalship, as also the Coun∣try: for the Souldiers took up their Winter-quar∣ters in <HI>Modena;</HI> which occasioned a great resort of the chief Officers, as well as inferiour persons; and this did help the poor Populace to pay the Gabels,

<P>The Duke of <HI>Modena</HI> hath this advantage be∣yond most <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, that some of his Subjects have <HI>Feifs</HI> of the Empire. There are many great Families; as, the rich Earls <HI>di San Paolo,</HI> the <HI>Benti∣vogli, Rangoni, Buoncompagni;</HI> the Marquesses <HI>Spi∣limberto, Peppoli, Gualengo, di Vignola,</HI> and <HI>Gualteri;</HI> the Earls <HI>Caprari, San Martino, di Molsa, di Mal∣visia, Montecuculi, Tassoni, Ferrareze, di Conoscia,</HI> and some others. But all Princes and Republicks in <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> solely excepted, do homage, or pay Tribute to the Pope or Emperour; and the Duke of <HI>Modena</HI> among the rest does Homage to the Emperour for his whole State. <HI>Ranuccio</HI> the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> was married to the sister of the late Duke, she being his second Wife, his former dying without Issue.</P>
<P>The present Duke of <HI>Modena, Francis</HI> the second, is very young; so that we have nothing to mention of his Person: and if he were of years, we must say of him, as of other Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> They are extremely reserv'd, live very retiredly, cautiously receiving Forreigners; so that strangers rarely have admission into their Courts, or free access to their Persons for any continuance. They live a kinde of recluse and private life, affording no matter of obser∣vation to the inquisitive that visit forraign Coun∣tries.</P>

<P>JOSEPHA-MARIA <HI>d'Esté</HI> (at present the Il∣lustrious Dutchess of <HI>York</HI>) is Sister to the above∣mentioned <HI>Francis</HI> Duke of <HI>Modena,</HI> and daughter of <HI>Laura Martinozza</HI> the now Dutchess Dowager, by whom she was accompanied to <HI>Dover,</HI> where her Nuptials were solemnly celebrated, being Married by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Crew,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to the most Illustrious Prince, his Royal Highness JAMES Duke of <HI>York,</HI> whom God preserve.</P>
<P>To conclude all: The Arms of the House of <HI>Esté,</HI> (the present Duke of <HI>Modena</HI> being of that Noble and Illustrious Family) is a Coat for its strangeness much taken notice of, and is thus Bla∣zon'd.</P>
