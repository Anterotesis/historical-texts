<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT prompted me, after so many Years Silence,
to expose this Piece to the World, was not so
much the Old Topick, Importunity of some, as
the Impertinencies of others; there being more than Four hun∣dred
Queries now by me, to which I was pressed for Answers, and
wherein I found a necessity, if I declined this Work, to appear
from other Hands in Print. This then was the first and chief
Cause; resting all that while content, that many Foreigners had
their Memoirs translated, whereby I thought my self excused
this Task; most of whom, I had either seen or heard of be∣yond
Sea, but never had read any of their Works, nor knew of
their Intentions to declare themselves to the World: Finding
therefore on my Return, that they had been before-hand with
me, I did believe it almost impossible, so many writing on the
same Subject, should not in many, and the most material Points
especially, if they followed Truth, relate the same things; which
made me still desist, supposing it a lost Labour.</P>
<P>But at last, considering those Travellers before me had few
of them been in those Parts where I had been, or at least not
dwelt so long there, I venture to offer some Novelties, either pas∣sed
over by them, or else not so thoroughly observed.</P>
<P>And indeed, this being the first of this kind I know of, wrote by
our own Countrymen, since the Ingenious Sir <HI>Thomas Herbert,</HI>
I hope it may find the more favourable Acceptance; since it bears
no other Design than the Good of my Country, setting before
them the True State of their Trade in <HI>East-India</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
The reclaiming of Atheists, by leading them first to behold
the Beauty, Order, and admirable Disposition of the Universe,
and then to see if they can so far abuse their Reason, to deny
the Author; which if they should, the <HI>Indians,</HI> how barbarous
soever esteemed by them, are to be preferred before them for
Men of Sense; who out of the very Principles of Nature,
keep to that Law written on their Minds, <HI>That there is a God
to be ador'd;</HI> and rather than be without, will frame to them∣selves
one of their own creating; which Depravity of theirs
while Atheists deride, they admonish them of as great an Error
in owning none.</P>
<P>And lastly, To inform those busy Translators, That the In∣dustry
of our own Nation is not fallen beneath that of <HI>France,</HI>
whose Language and Manners we so servilely affect, as to think
nothing Excellent or <HI>Alamode,</HI> which has not a <HI>French</HI> Dress;
but that it still is in the Power of the <HI>English</HI> to retrieve their
former Renown both by Pen and Sword: <HI>Tam Marti quam
Mercurio.</HI> Nor will any <HI>Englishman</HI> accuse me of Self-Confidence
or Arrogance, when it is a Justice only intended my
Country against its Decriers; nor in the least to undervalue the
Authors or the Books translated, but to whet our Endeavours to
equalize, if not outdo them.</P>
<P>As to the Method I have taken, it is unconfin'd (it being
the Privilege of a Traveller) not bounded with the narrow
Terms of an Historian, nor loosely extravagant, like Poetical
Fictions, but suited both to Time and Place, and agreeable to
the Nature of the Relation: And herein I have followed <HI>Bus∣bequius;</HI>
which though it may make some Unevenness in the
Stile, as where the Ruggedness of the Ways interpose, or the
Subject-matter is varied, it must happen, yet the Warp quite
through is most of the same Thread; which being the Clue to so
many and intricate Meanders, trodden by a few, I am the more
pardonable when I slip: Though I do declare my desire is, To
shew my Diligence in collecting, and Sincerity in compiling what
may make the Road more easy to the next Adventurers, and sa∣tisfy
the present Enquirers.</P>

Aboard-ship (which might reasonably be sup∣posed
the last kind Office to a departing

long a Voyage, as well as the Uncertainty of
my Return) I must keep to that Promise,
whereby you obliged me to give you an ac∣count
not only of my Being, but of what
Occurrences were worth my Animadversion.</P>
<P>You may remember,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Taking Ship at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and falling down to the <HI>Buoy in the Nore.</HI></NOTE> It was the 9th of <HI>December,</HI> in the Year of
our Lord 1672. when by virtue of an Order from the Honourable
<HI>East-India Company,</HI> I being received on Board the <HI>Ʋnity,</HI> we took of

Fleet there, which were Ten in Number; to whom his Majesty,
<HI>Charles</HI> II. was pleased to grant Letters of Mart: Which impowered
them to wear the King's Jack, Ancient and Pennant, and to act as
Men of War (the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> at this time being at open De∣fiance
against the <HI>Dutch.</HI>)</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="13"/>
When they were altogether,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter I.</NOTE> their Commands were to go over the
<HI>Flats;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason of going over the <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ats.</HI></NOTE> which, notwithstanding the Hazard to Ships of their
Burthen, was thought securer now than to venture about the <HI>King's
Channel,</HI> where they might be exposed to the Attempts of the <HI>Hol∣landers:</HI>
By which means, together with the unsteadiness of the
Weather, it was the day after <HI>Christmas</HI> before we arrived at the <HI>Downs;</HI>
where rode a rich and numerous Fleet of Merchants, with their
respective Convoys, designed for their several Places of Traffick,
when the Wind should present.</P>
<P>Here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stay at the <HI>Downs.</HI></NOTE> as we ended the Old Year, so we began the New with a
desire of prosecuting our intended Voyage: But a <HI>South-West</HI> Wind
prevented our Course, and held us there Three Weeks; when an
<HI>East</HI> Wind made a general delivery and a clear <HI>Downs.</HI></P>
<P>Being at Sea, we made easy Sail, that our Ships might have the
liberty that Night to single themselves from the Crowd of the other
Ships; notwithstanding which Proviso, we had a shrewd Suspicion;
for Night hastening on (and in such a swarm of Vessels of greater
bulk, not so readily manageable as smaller) we beheld three Lights
out of the Poop of a goodly Ship, the same unfortunate signs our
Directions bound us to take notice of; which made us conclude the
Damage on our side, as indeed it proved by the next Morning-song;
for having cast our Eyes abroad to look what Ships we had in
company, running over a great many (that had shrowded them∣selves
under our Protection and of Six Men of War more, Captain
<HI>Munday</HI> Commander in chief (whereof Two were Fireships) sent
for to meet the <HI>East India</HI> Fleet at <HI>Sancta Helena,</HI> for their better
Defence homeward-bound, and to prevent their falling into the Ene∣mies
Hands, who had lately possessed themselves of that Island) we
at length missed the <HI>Massenberg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Massenberg</HI> disabled.</NOTE> on whom (it seems) a small Pink
falling foul, had carried away her Head and Boltsprit, and 'tis to be
feared has disabled her this Voyage; we saw her afterwards make
for <HI>Portsmouth.</HI></P>
<P>Off the <HI>Land's End</HI> we met with Four <HI>English</HI> Merchant Ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leaving the <HI>Lizzard,</HI> we met with Ships from <HI>Cales.</HI></NOTE>
Two <HI>French</HI> Men of War their Convoys, laden from <HI>Cales,</HI> bound for

<P>In Four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ys, from the <HI>Downs,</HI> we were losing <HI>England</HI> on our
Backs, reckoning the <HI>Lizzard</HI> the most extreme part <HI>South</HI> to bear
<HI>North and By East</HI> 14 Leagues; from whence hereafter we were to
fetch our <HI>Meridian Distance:</HI> It lies in the Latitude of 50 deg. 10
min. <HI>North.</HI></P>
<P>Thus relinquishing the <HI>British Seas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">We cross the <HI>Bay of Biscay</HI> to the Main <HI>Atlantick.</HI></NOTE> we make our selves Possessors
of the <HI>Western Ocean</HI> for a while: 'Till following our Compass more

for some part of the <HI>Bay of Biscay,</HI> whose Mountain Seas we are to
cut through to the Main <HI>Atlantick.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why this Sea is always troubled.</NOTE> What makes these Seas in such
a constant Turmoil is imputed to the falling in of the whole Force of
the <HI>Western Ocean</HI> into this <HI>Sinus</HI> without any Impediment, 'till it re∣coil
against its Shores; so that in the calmest Season here are always

Two days after we espied one Sail to the Leeward under a main
Course,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. I.</NOTE> steering very doubtfully; after she had had her full view of
us, she made from us too nimble for us to follow; we supposed her to
be either an <HI>Algerine</HI> Pirate, or a <HI>Dutch</HI> Privateer. We still directed
our Course <HI>South,</HI> and in Twenty four Hours ran One hundred and
seventeen Miles by our Log-board for some days together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little credit to be given to the Log board in respect of the Ships way.</NOTE> the Wea∣ther
not allowing us to observe with the Quadrant; but as soon as
we could take the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Altitude, we found our selves to be in the

<P>At Noon our Admiral fired a Gun, and hoisted his Ancient,
whereby we understood he saw Land, which we thought to be
<HI>Porto Porto,</HI> bearing off us <HI>East.</HI> An hour more being hardly run,
we in like manner made the <HI>Madera</HI> Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island of <HI>Madera,</HI> the largest in the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Oce∣an.</NOTE> the largest of the whole

was 33 deg. 17 min. to the <HI>Northward</HI> of the <HI>Equator,</HI> in Latitude
and Longitude from the <HI>Lizzard</HI> as before, we having neither raised
nor depressed it. Where the Trade-winds begin to offer themselves,
the Mariner relaxes his anxious care of Sailing, and is at more lei∣sure
to Repose; he not being so often called upon to shift his Course,
or hand his Sails; which has yet this inconvenience, giving him
leave now to fall into those Distempers Idleness contracts, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<HI>Scurvy,</HI> and other ill Habits; unless rouzed by an Active Com∣mander,
either to Sports, or more useful Employments: Although
the perfect knowledge of these Trade-winds (which are more con∣stant
within the Tropicks) are of such importance as to make our
Modern Navigators perform that in six Months, which took up
the Pains and Travels of as many Years from the first Discoverers,
they keeping all along the Shore, whereupon they became not only
liable to unaccountable Changes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The advan∣tage of under∣standing the Trade-winds and the Azi∣muth.</NOTE> as they met with Land briezes,

thereupon; which these more experienced and bold Adventurers
by standing off to Sea, and study of their Compass by a more accu∣rate
Computation of their Way by the Quadrant and Azimuth, and
a strict enquiry of the commencing and terminating of these Winds,
avoid.</P>
<P>In this short space we have almost out-ran the <HI>Northern Winter</HI>'s

temperate Warmth adds Spirits to our frozen Limbs: Yet in this

the <HI>Portugals</HI> christned <HI>Querpo Santos,</HI> the Bodies of Saints, which by
them are esteemed Ominous. But I think I am not too positive in
relating them to be a Meteor-like substance exhaled in the Day,
and at Night (for except then, they shew not themselves) kindled by
the violent Motion of the Air, fixing themselves to those parts of the
Ship that are most attractive: For I can witness they usually spent
themselves at the Spindles of the Top-mast-heads, or about the
Iron-hoops of the Yard arms, and if any went towards them, they
shifted always to some Part of the like Nature.</P>
<P>The succeeding Morning had not long withdrawn this black Vail,
and brought us tidings of a more serene Day, when we beheld our
Frigots that had left us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s Fleet over∣take us.</NOTE> busking after us with all the winged speed
they could, and about Noon they gained us, keeping on the same
Course as we, but missed of their design of touching at the <HI>Ma∣dera's.</HI></P>

<P>By reason whereof it was familiar to behold, the sportful Fishes
greedy of their Prey raise whole Flocks of that Scaly Nation. For
those whom Nature has placed in the vast Deep, defenceless of
themselves, and innocent to others of a more powerful Greatness,
so as many times they become their Prey, she has not altogether
left them unprovided; either out of her abhorrency of Idleness, re∣solving
every thing should labour for its Belly, or else out of a pe∣culiar
respect towards every individual Species for their Preserva∣tion
as well as Production;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flying Fishes and their Pur∣fuers.</NOTE> furnishing these with Fins of larger
size and double use for swifter conveying them under Water, as also
for soaring into the Air when they are too closely pursued. Of these
sort we saw good store flying from <HI>Bonetos</HI> and <HI>Albecores,</HI> who
were hunting them. Some of these flying Fish (for no other Name
they have as I can learn) were so put to it, that after often dip∣ping
their fishy Wings in the briny Water (without which genuine
Artifice they could not use them) chose rather to make our Ship
their Sanctuary, than to yield themselves to the Jaws of their
devouring Adversaries: By which means you have their more exact
Description, they being as large as a River Perch bedeckt with
Silver-spangled Scales, and long Fins as before.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14"/>
Not many days after, two of the lesser Off-spring of the great
Leviathan, (the Weather being calm, these sort of them else not
visible, being of no swift motion) came sailing after us; our Men
as eager of them as they of their Prey, hastned their Engines for
to take them; which no sooner in the Water, but each of them
guided by some half a dozen delicately coloured little Fishes,
which for their own safeguard perform the Office of Pilots, (they
never offering to satisfy their Hunger on them) who lead them to
the Baits; when they turning their Bellies up, seize upon them on
their Backs, hook themselves in the Toils, beating the Sea into a
Breach, and not without a great many Hands are drawn over the
sides of the Ship; which seen by the poor silly little Fishes (as
conscious of their Error) they swim to and again, and hardly for∣sake
the Ship; but being within Board, the Ship's Company armed
with Hatchets presently divide the Spoil.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sharks and Pi∣lot-Fishes.</NOTE> They are not scaly,
and therefore imagined to be a kind of Whale, being finned like
them, with a great Fin on their Backs near their Tails, (which
dried is used instead of a Slate) of a darkish grey Colour on their
Backs, lighter on their Sides, and white under their Bellies; their
Snout on the same Plain with their Mouths, but their Mouth within
that a great way; the cause why they turn their Bellies when they
take their Prey. The Mouth of one of them extended, is two
Spans wide, armed within with three Tire of sharp pointed Teeth
on both Jaws, so piercing that Needles exceed them not, and of
such strength that a Leg or an Arm, Bone and all, is but an easy
Morsel; wherefore called Sharks by the Seamen, on whom they
are bold enough to fasten, and dismember if not shunned when
they wash themselves: They are of a rank smell, and not good to
eat but by stout Stomachs; of Length they are ten, sometimes
fourteen Feet.</P>
<P>By this time we had got into 17 deg. 19 min. <HI>North</HI> Latitude,
Longitude 9 deg. 10 min. <HI>West,</HI> when our Men of War thinking
to birth themselves before us at St. <HI>Iago,</HI> (where our Ships were
permitted to refresh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Men of War out-sail us.</NOTE> being otherwise tied up by Charter-party not
to put in any where unless for absolute necessity) made all the Sail
on head they could.</P>
<P>Our Commanders were well enough content with their proffer,
knowing the danger of a many Ships going in there together: The

<HEAD>Of the Island of St. Iago, one of the Cape Verde Islands.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Afternoon I went ashore, which was near two Miles from
the Ship, where was a convenient watering place, which emp∣tied
its fresh Current into the Salt Sea; the Beach was sandy, and
easy going ashore.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Natives accost us with their Wares.</NOTE> Here met us whole Troops of the Natives with
their several Wares, some offering us Cocoes, others Oranges and
Limes; some brought Jackanaps's, such green Ones as are com∣monly
seen in <HI>England</HI> to be sold; and all at the price of a cleanly
Rag▪ or a Bunch of Ribbons.</P>
<P>Before us in a Valley was a most stately Grove of Cocoes and<NOTE PLACE="marg">A stately Grove.</NOTE>
Oranges (through which ran the Stream our Men filled their Casks
with Water) surrounded with a Wall.</P>
<P>The first of which Trees, so much celebrated for its usefulness,
deserves as much for the pleasure it affords the Sight. It grows with
an upright, tall, and slender Body, the Bark of an Ash colour, lori∣cated;
not sending any Branches forth till it come to its chiefest
Summit, where it spreads its shady Branches with some resemblance
to our <HI>Osmond</HI> Royal Fern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Cocoe Tree, its beauty and usefulness.</NOTE> but more like the Palm; and under these
protects its weighty Fruit; which hang very thick round about the
Tree, to which it yields but one Stalk, but that fit to support its ponde∣rousness;
every Moon produces a fresh Harvest both of Fruit and
Boughs; the first being gathered, the others being thrust off when
sapless by the young ones: If the Juicy ones be wounded, there distills
an heady Liquor, which they preserve in Earthen Pots fitted to re∣ceive
it, but that spoils their bearing Nuts. Next to the Stalk it be∣stows
a Calix, not differing (only in bigness, and that it is smoother)
from that of our Acorn; from which proceeds the Rind of a lighter
Green, under which a fibrous substance presents its self, which might
supply them with Utensils, for Roaps and Sails; beneath which ap∣pears
a spacious brown Shell, proper for many Necessaries, big
enough for a Drinking Cup, a Ladle, and many more; serving them
for the chief part of their Housholdstuff: Enclosed in this is a deli∣cious
Meat, white in Colour, cloathed with a pithy matter, as our
Hasle-nuts, and not inferiour to them in Taste; this they chuse for
their ordinary Nourishment. Nor does it afford them a less grateful
emulsion, contained in the Nut to the quantity of a Pint, or Pint
and half; in colour like Whey, and of that consistency, but in re∣lish
far excelling.</P>
<P>When the Meat of the Nut grows rancid, they express an Oyl
serviceable for their Lamps.</P>
<P>Thus abundantly has Providence furnished them from this one
Root. The figure of the Fruit, take it intire, is oval, and as big as
the largest Melons.</P>
<P>On the other Fruits it's needless to insist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Fruits less common.</NOTE> as Oranges, and the like,
being planted nearer home, and therefore not such strangers.</P>
<P>Having observed enough here, we entred a Door which gave us
admittance to a Court in the same Valley, whose party Wall made
of Mud and Stone, separated it from the Grove.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="18"/>
Here lay at the Foot of the ascending Mountain, in a careless po∣sture,
one Company of their Militia, raised on this occasion, having
rested their Arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Militia well appoint∣ed.</NOTE> as Muskets, and Pikes, with their Colours of
White Silk, with a Green Cross athwart, and the Arms of <HI>Portugal</HI>
in the midst of it, against the Wall, but Breast high; which could
not have held up the Pikes, had not some adjoining Trees contribu∣ted
to their aid.</P>
<P>They saluted us with the civility of the Hat, and Congeed to the
ground; those of them that walked about, had Javelins in their
hands, and long Swords tied to their Backs.</P>
<P>Labouring to reach the top of the Mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Asses as sure footed as Goats.</NOTE> which was very
steep, some we met on foot, others mounted on Asses, with Jacka∣naps's
behind them, passed us with no small Grandure and Ceremony
of the Cap; and which was wonderful, to see them ride these Crea∣tures
over Precipices, only Goats and they could clamber on.</P>
<P>At last gaining the highest part, another Wall accosted us, over
which a Gate, and upon that a Cross. On the left hand, as soon as
we were in, was either a Prison, or a Guard-house. Not many Paces
from it, on the same side, a Row of Houses, one Story high, thatcht
with the Branches of the Cocoe, and Windows with wooden Shut∣ters,
but no Casements, built with Mud and Stone, as all their Build∣ings
were which I saw; the insides visible enough, for the biggest of
them had not four yards Front, and half that, for the greater state,
was taken up by the Door: Their Furniture is answerable to the splen∣dour
of their Habitations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of living and Entertain∣ment.</NOTE> but because we will not refuse the Cour∣tesy
of their Entertainment, see in what a manner they present us
with their Viands.</P>
<P>They invite us with an Hubble-bubble (so called from the noise it
makes) a long Reed as brown as a Nut with use, inserted the Body
of a Cocoe-shell filled with Water, and a nasty Bole just pressing the
Water, they ram Tobacco into it uncut, out of which we may
suck as long as we please, but for any thing else they tell us as
the Poet did,
<Q><L>Vina mihi non sunt Gazetica, Chia, Falerna,</L>
<L>Quaeque Sereptano palmite missa bibas.</L></Q>
Their common Drink being only Water; and their Food as plain,
being only the Fruits of the Earth.</P>
<P>But to keep on our way, which here we found easy and plain; on
the Right stood another Cross, propped with a four-square Pillar
raised on steps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Rural Chappel near the <HI>Corps de Guard.</HI></NOTE> and half a Stone's cast from it, a Chappel, not proud
enough to brag of any great elegancy for its Architecture (being
but the Rural Seat of one of their Black Padres.) Not much beyond
it the <HI>Corps de Guard,</HI> from whence they supplied their Sentinels,
which were placed in a Military Order here and there: Nearer the
Water-side, on the brow of the Precipice which overloo'k the Haven,
in a well-appointed place, were planted half a dozen small Pieces of
Ordnance, which spake Thanks for our respect paid when we came to
an Anchor; not far from hence another Guard and House regarding
the Main, which gave notice to the rest of what Vessels they saw
at Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="18"/>
And now we began to think of returning, when we met with
some had happen'd to see the glory of the Day; who told us, our Ad∣miral
had sent to the Deputy-Governour, residing here, to be certi∣fied
about the Anchors; who first claimed those Anchors of our
Emissaries with the Majesty essential to that Nation he represented
(being a White <HI>Portugal</HI>) for his Master,<NOTE PLACE="marg">News of the St. <HI>Helen</HI> Fleet surprizing the <HI>Dutch</HI> in this Bay.</NOTE> being slipped in Port;
and then informed them, that they were left there the Afternoon
before we came in, by Three great <HI>Holland</HI> Men of War, who were
separated by foulness of Weather, from the Squadron of Admiral
<HI>Eversdon,</HI> who was sent to vex the <HI>English</HI> Plantations at <HI>Virginia:</HI>
Who at the sight of our Men of War, had put to Sea in great confu∣sion,
leaving some of their Crews behind them, who went off in
their Shallops, but could not reach their Ships; keeping therefore the
Shore on board, they put in at St. <HI>Iago</HI> Town, where they now re∣main:
From whence this Morn by fresh Advice he was assured only
six Ships were seen to ply to windward; which must be our Fleet
striving to regain the Island, which is difficult by reason of the Trade∣winds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of our sudden departure.</NOTE>
it being beside their Commission to pursue them. Thus being
alarm'd to our Ships, that Night we weighed.</P>
<P>In the dusk of the Evening came into this Bay a <HI>Sattee</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI>
laden from <HI>Madera</HI> with Wine, some of which we purchased, but
restored not the Anchors.</P>
<P>The Country without is rocky and mountainous, the Island but
small; what Towns it has of note, our small stay would not permit
the Enquiry:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the Island,</NOTE> It is said to be pleasant within the Country; well wa∣tered,
and furnished with all things necessary for the life of Man;
discovered for the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> Anno 1440. Well peopled by
the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and a Colony of their Plantation from <HI>Ginea.</HI> In
respect of the Heavenly Bodies, it lies in <HI>North</HI> Latitude, 15 deg.
25 min. Longitude from the <HI>Lizzard</HI> 12 deg. 10 min. <HI>West,</HI> the
length of Days altering very little.</P>
<P>The People are of a comely Black, their Hair frizled, Tall of sta∣ture,
cunning and Thievish; they staring one in the Face, and in
the mean time cut a Knot from the Shoulder, or steal an Handker∣chief
out of the Pocket.</P>
<P>Their Speech is broken <HI>Portugal,</HI> as also is their Habit, imitating
therein the <HI>Portugals;</HI> though few of them so well clad as to hide
their Nakedness so, but that either Leggs, Shoulders and Back may be
seen, and in some all. If they get an old Hat with a Bunch of Ribbons,
two White Sleeves, a Waistband, or a Coat slasht to hang back to shew
their Sleeves, or an old Pair of Long Breeches to their Buttocks; an
unsizeable Sword to their Backs, a Javelin in their Hands, without
either Hose or Shooes (as if cut out for Sir <HI>John Falstaff</HI>'s Hu∣mour)
they shall have them strut,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> and look as big as the greatest Don
in <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>The Women are not so handsome as the Men, Blubber-lipp'd,
more corpulent, and shorter; notorious also for their Levity. Their
Head geer a Clout rowled up like our Water-bearers; their Backs,
and Breasts (which were large, and hanging down) bare, as also
to their Wasts, from whence a thin Cloath, in fashion of a Petticoat,
down to their Feet, which are bare likewise. Some of the best of
them adorn'd with Bracelets about their Arms and Necks, false
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
Jewels in their Ears, with a kind of Vail from their Head to their
Knees, with a Close-bodied Coat with Hanging-sleeves.</P>
<P>By Religion they are Christians of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church.</P>
<P>Their Governour is from <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing more observable in this little time, but that at Night on
Shipboard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De'l Fogo.</NOTE> we had the sight of <HI>De'l Fogo</HI>'s Flames; it being an

<HI>East.</HI> And now we were to the <HI>Northward</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> four degrees,
with whom circling a little <HI>East,</HI> in nine days time we were in a
Perpendicular, whereby our Quadrants became of small use, we
not being able to make an Observation for their want of Shade,
but by an Astrolabe at Night:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Out-sailed the <HI>North</HI>-Star.</NOTE> The <HI>Sun</HI> passing over our Heads,
and we being to the <HI>Southward</HI> of the Line, the first fair Wind made
us out-sail the <HI>Northern</HI> Polar Star, it not being to be seen in this
Horizon.</P>
<P>Steering now by the <HI>Crosiers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Raised the <HI>Crosiers</HI> and <HI>Magellanian</HI> Clouds.</NOTE> a <HI>South</HI> Constellation, taking its
Name from the Similitude of that Pastoral Staff; as also supplied
by the <HI>Magellanian</HI> Clouds, in number Two, (averred to be such by
those that use this way continually) fixed as the <HI>North</HI> Star; but
to me they seem no other than a <HI>Galaxia,</HI> caused by the Reflection of
the Stars.</P>
<P>Being to the <HI>Southward</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Declination,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>North Sun</HI> makes Noon as a <HI>South Sun</HI> did before. The Calen∣ture rages in the Fleet.</NOTE> it is obvious to
note, a <HI>North Sun</HI> makes the same time of Day a <HI>South Sun</HI> does on
the contrary side.</P>
<P>An Epidemical Distemper, by the Sea-Chyrurgions termed a
Calenture (a malignant Fever with a Frenzy, so that if not watch∣ed,
they leap into the Sea) raging in the Fleet, many were thrown
over-board.</P>
<P>Where the <HI>Atlantick</HI> (washing the Shores all along from the
<HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) mixes with the <HI>Aethiopick</HI> Ocean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent of the <HI>Atlantick</HI> and Use of the Azimuth to correct the Common Chart.</NOTE> there the
Meridian Compass varies very much, so that the Wind being at
<HI>South-East</HI> and by <HI>East,</HI> lays out a <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>West</HI> way, but cor∣rected
by the Magnetick Azimuth (which gives the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Ampli∣tude)
it differs two Points and an half, which with Leeway allow'd,
makes a <HI>South-West</HI> Course, which we held on till we were on the
Coasts of <HI>Brasil,</HI> when we were at distance enough to take the Alti∣tude
of the <HI>Sun,</HI> which made 14 deg. 40 m. <HI>South</HI> Latitude, Longi∣tude
2 deg. 24 min. <HI>East.</HI></P>
<P>Being between <HI>Brasil</HI> and several Islands, as <HI>Trinidado, Isl. de
Picos, Sancta Maria,</HI> &amp;c. we met with Winds carried us to the
<HI>South</HI> of the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tropick of <HI>Capricorn.</HI></NOTE> which crosseth <HI>Aethiopia Inferior,</HI>
and the midst of <HI>Peruviana.</HI></P>
<P>Before we leave this Ecliptick Circle, we must observe at the
Aequator, the <HI>Sun</HI> becomes twice Perpendicular; at each Tropick
but once; beyond them never; because hence may naturally be
collected all the Seasons of the whole Year; unless some accidental
Cause, as the Interposition of Mountains, Headlands, Lakes, or such
like intervene.</P>
<P>But in his Solar Progress Through the twelve Signs, the <HI>Sun</HI>
always carries Rain along with him, its Heat otherwise could not
be endured; for which reason, the first Contriver and Former of all
things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Course of the <HI>Sun</HI> through the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> the cause of the Seasons of the Year.</NOTE> has ordained the wet Season a <HI>Winter</HI> to those inhabit here, and
to them as dreadful as our cold Seasons to us (which we shall evidence
more experimentally when we come to live among them): On this
account is it, that under the Line two <HI>Winters</HI> and two <HI>Summers</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
alternately succeed, but not above three quarters of that length as
the one at each Tropick, they continuing four Months together;
to wit, four Months <HI>Winter,</HI> as many <HI>Summer,</HI> and the other four
Months moderate or cold Weather; though nearer the Line, the
Rule holds not good as to the cool Weather, for that cause more
frequently visited with Wet than the Sunshine.</P>
<P>Our Men at length tired with salt Provisions, began to be stu∣dious
for fresh; Necessity having taught them an Invention, by
counterfeiting those formerly mentioned Flying fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain Sea∣fishes for Food.</NOTE> with a white
Rag stuffed to hide the Hook, and Feathers pricked in instead of
Fins, to catch their Enemies at their own game, and so they did;
providing for themselves and us too, <HI>Bonetos</HI> and <HI>Albicores;</HI> the
latter bigger than the former, in length two Feet, in thickness
one, of a brave shining Colour, with spiked Fins; but the other
preferred by the Palate, bearing the make of our Jacks; both of
them a good Repast at Sea, where it is denied to be curious in our
choice.</P>
<P>The Dolphin is extolled beyond these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dolphin.</NOTE> which they strike with a
Fisgig: They are swift and strait when they swim, and for Compo∣sure
surpass all others in neatness, as well as for variety of Colours,
for which it seems to vie with the Rain-bow, or <HI>Juno</HI>'s darling Bird,
the Peacock.</P>
<P>There is another Fish they call a <HI>Stone-Bass,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Stone-Bass</NOTE> which eats better
than it looks, it being of a Colour sandy, but has a Relish equal to
our <HI>Soles.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto having kept mostly a <HI>South-West</HI> Course, furthered in
it by Gales from the Coast of <HI>Ginea,</HI> we are now to expect <HI>Westerly</HI>
Winds to carry us to <HI>Cabo da boa esperança;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gales from the <HI>West</HI> to reach the <HI>Cape.</HI></NOTE> near the Latitude of
30 deg. <HI>South</HI> we had a promising <HI>Fresco,</HI> but somewhat dulled by
too frequent Calms, yet here not so vexatious as before, we going
retrograde with the <HI>Sun.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Current of the Sea a∣gainst the Wind.</NOTE> that the Sea had a contrary Course with the
Wind, presumed to proceed from its blowing so long in one Quar∣ter;
and now not altered so long as to be powerful enough to turn
the Current of the Waters.</P>
<P>Gaining upon the <HI>East</HI> with a slow pace, we met with those fea∣thered
Harbingers of the Cape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape-Birds.</NOTE> as <HI>Pintado</HI> Birds, <HI>Mangofaleudos,
Albetrosses;</HI> the first remarkable for their painted Spots of black
and white; the last in that they have great Bodies, yet not pro∣portionable
to their Wings, which mete out twice their length.</P>
<P>Three Months being near consumed, we were at last accompa∣nied
with long lookt for <HI>Western</HI> Blasts, and now we fly afore the
Wind: But by the way take notice a <HI>South-West</HI> Wind becomes as
bleak here, as a <HI>North-East</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> So that all the Seasons of
the Year being undergone in this time, we may begin to calculate
our Ephemeris afresh; and as a fit Platform, <HI>Easter</HI> Holy-days bring
with them such Weather as is essential to Christide.</P>
<P>But bidding Adieu to these Fancies, the Wind that till now seemed
to dally, proves in good earnest, and begins a frowning <HI>April,</HI>
driving the trembling Sea on heaps, and on them piling more, till
the swelling Surges menace the lowering Skies, leaving a Hollow
where they borrowed their Gigantine vastness, as if they were
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
intended to exenterate the Treasures of the Deep. At top of which
'twas dreadful to behold the angry Surface of the foaming Billows,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Winter</HI> Storms and Tempests attend us to the Cape.</NOTE>
descending down beneath no less uncomfortable, when the Vans of
the next Ships (though groveling with a neighbouring Wave)
could not be discerned.</P>
<P>This tossing Condition lasted long, and was taken kindly too,
as long as we spooned before the Sea, and kept from running foul
of one the other; but when a Fret of Wind rowled the Waves
athwart our Quarters, it made our Ship shake, proving the sound∣ness
of her Sides, where had she given way never so little, we must
have sunk without Bail or Mainprize. Still the Tempest encreases,
and brings with it Gusts of Rain and dismal darksome Weather,
whereby we were separated from the rest of our Fleet: For all, we
put our Lights abroad as did they, yet in the badness of the
Night we lost them, and were left alone to shift with the boisterous
Winds.</P>
<P>At last the Morn appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We and the <HI>Caesar</HI> separa∣ted from the Fleet for two Days.</NOTE> but with the Symptoms of a blowing
Day. She had not wafted many Hours, but on the advantage of a
rising Wave, we spied a Sail to Leeward with her Fore-top-mast by
the Board, which at Noon we knew to be the <HI>Caesar</HI> crowding under
all its Sails.</P>
<P>In this Encounter we shipped many a perilous Sea, (not with∣out
being well-drenched our selves): Such was the force of this
Nights Storm, that our Boat, and some of our Men, were not
without difficulty restrained from being carried over-board. In
this pickle we reeled out this Day, and out-stretching the <HI>Caesar,</HI>
we made what Sail we durst, and by the next Light had sight of
our Fleet, who shortning Sail, we came up with them, to whom
we declared the misfortune of the <HI>Caesar,</HI> and that it bore <HI>South-West;</HI>
wherefore they lay by, (the Wind slackning) and in half an
hour we saw the Hull, and presently after it made up our Company
compleat again.</P>
<P>Near the middle of this Month we could have made that known
Cape, the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Had Sound∣ings off the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI></NOTE> being in the Latitude of 36 deg.
14 min. <HI>South,</HI> and Longitude from St. <HI>Iago</HI> 37 deg. 19 min. <HI>East.</HI>
But the <HI>Dutch</HI> having some Forts there, it was thought no good
Policy; wherefore veering to the <HI>South,</HI> the Cape bore <HI>East-North-East,</HI>
some thirty Leagues off us; for heaving our Dipsy-lead we
were in soundings eighty Fathom depth, which the Pilots note to
be in that distance.</P>
<P>Here we made two Sail to Leeward, and one to Windward,
who directed her Course with us; but the Wind from the Shore
coming <HI>East,</HI> they Tacked, and she passed without speaking to her:
But the Leeward-most came up boldly to us and the <HI>Ann</HI> (we be∣ing
the nearest and ready to receive them);<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spoke with some <HI>English</HI> Ships home∣ward bound.</NOTE> but making them <HI>En∣lish</HI>
built by their Galleries, we only shewed them our Colours
(which they answered by St. <HI>George</HI>'s Cross) and fired a Gun;
when they brought to, and we bearing up, our Commander went
Aboard one of them, the <HI>Johanna,</HI> a Ship of 700 Tuns laden from
<HI>Bantam,</HI> who told us, That five more were in Company with
them from the Coasts, but dispersed by Tempests; the other Ship
was the <HI>Bernardiston;</HI> that which escaped us, the <HI>Rebecca.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="21"/>
They also inform'd us, The <HI>French</HI> had worsted the <HI>Flemmings</HI> in
<HI>India,</HI> taken and demolished a Fort on the Island <HI>Ceilon;</HI> and that
they had beat the <HI>Moors</HI> out of St. <HI>Thomas:</HI> That on our side never
a Ship was lost, as they heard. So likewise giving them an Account
of what we knew, with some Instructions communicated on both
sides, we left them to take their Course, which served them for
St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> the <HI>Antartick Monsoons</HI> favouring them directly thi∣ther,
and the Squadron under Captain <HI>Munday,</HI> if they have raised
the <HI>South</HI> Latitude of 28. may be there a little before to expect
them.</P>
<P>We kept on <HI>South-East,</HI> till we had doubled the most <HI>Southern</HI>
Promontory of the Cape, <HI>Cape de Angullis,</HI> (which Course would
lead us to <HI>Bantam</HI>) when bending to the <HI>North,</HI> we held on till we
came betwixt St.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doubled <HI>Cape de Angullis</HI> to gain St. <HI>Law∣rence.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lawrence</HI> or <HI>Madigascar,</HI> and the Main, reckoned
one of the four biggest Islands in the World, <HI>viz. Sumatra, Java,</HI>
St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> and <HI>Britannia.</HI> The most traded Empories here, are
St. <HI>Augustine</HI> on the Island, and <HI>Mosambique</HI> on the Main; frequent∣ed
by the <HI>Portugals</HI> for Elephants Teeth, Gold, Camphire, and
Ambergreece. Why we creep in between this Island and the Main,
Is to borrow from the Land-briezes assistance against the general
stated Winds settled for these Months between the Cape and this
Island.</P>
<P>The Sea here takes the Name of <HI>Oceanus Orientalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Eastern</HI>-Sea.</NOTE> beginning
from the Cape till it joyn with the <HI>Indian, Red,</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI>
Seas.</P>
<P>Here it was we had a notable Fish stretched its self along our
sides for the space of an hour: Some called it a Grampos; but those
that pretended skill, would have it a young Whale: It might be in
length forty Feet and upward, bolting out of the Water with a
great Surf; the Mouth large, but not responsible to so large a
Body, the Form whereof was a Pyramid inverted, the Basis of
which from Gill to Gill near five Feet in breadth, the Conus termi∣nating
with a narrow Snout; where his Mouth opening, he suckt
in a huge quantity of Water, and with that same eddy his Prey,
which he retains within his Jaws, but spouts the Water out with the
same spurting noise our Engines make, and as immense an heighth
from an hole in his Neck, opening after the fashion of a Mouth or
Slit; at the performance of which Action it contracts its self into
an Orbicular Figure, and again dilates its self in its Diastole: The
Back is of a dark Gray without Scales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Whale.</NOTE> sixteen Feet over, leaping as
other Fishes, but in a more Majestick manner, moving but slowly,
whereby we had the sight of his Head and Neck first, (all one
Rock, and as impenetrable, it being proof against the Prongs of the
sharpest Harping-Iron); his whisking Tail last, near which a ridge
of Fins, the true mark of Distinction for a Whale: The extreme part
of his Tail extended is very broad and finny, which is the Rudder to
this great Leviathan, wherewith, and two Fins more proceeding one
from each side, he guides himself through his watery Territories.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> had now began,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We follow the <HI>Sun.</HI></NOTE> when making after that glorious Charioteer,
the <HI>Sun,</HI> we were once more spirited with milder Weather; the
Mariners casting off their wet Cloaths, cared not for any more than

<P><PB N="15" REF="21" MS="y"/>
We being in sight of five Small Islands off St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> for fear
of the Tides driving them on shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lost sight of S. <HI>Lawrence.</HI></NOTE> some of our Ships anchored;

had time to reach us: Being becalmed, it was the middle of the

<P>THE Morning following we came under the <HI>Westward</HI> part
of <HI>Johanna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival at <HI>Johanna.</HI></NOTE> where opposed us a lofty Ridge of Mountains,
one of which advanceth its aspiring Head up to the towring Clouds:
Over against which lies the Island called <HI>Mohelia,</HI> at the same di∣stance
<HI>Calice</HI> is from <HI>Dover;</HI> the better Island of the Two, though
not so big, nor quite so Mountainous; it being more plentifully,
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
as 'tis said, stored with Provisions; but not furnished with so safe
an Harbour for Ships as <HI>Johanna:</HI> The only difficulty here being the
Weathering the Point, in which, notwithstanding several Ships have
been driven off to Sea, not being able to recover the Island again,
the Winds descending in desperate Gusts drive them into the Trade∣winds,
which here commence again. But our Ships were blest with
better success, and came all safe to Anchor under a Lee-shore, which
sufficiently protected them from the Winds by the highth of the
Mountains. A Blessing not to be passed by without a grateful Com∣memoration,
when half the Fleet were disabled by Distempers ac∣quired
by Salt Meats, and a long Voyage without Refreshments;
and must have suffered too for want of Water, had not they met
with a seasonable Recruit.</P>
<P>The first care then was to send the Sick Men ashore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Care of the Sick.</NOTE> which it is
incredible to relate how strangely they revived in so short a time,
by feeding on Oranges and Fresh Limes, and the very smell of the
Earth; for those that were carried from the Ships in Cradles, and
looked upon as desperate, in a days time could take up their Beds and
walk; only minding to fetch them anights, that the Misty Vapours
might not hinder the kind Operation begun on their tainted Mass of
Blood, by these Specifick Medicines of Nature's own preparing.</P>
<P>We had Leisure now joined to Security of the <HI>Dutch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of the Island.</NOTE> for that no
Ships from <HI>India</HI> can readily return this way into <HI>Europe</HI> at this
time of the Year; and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> after having touched at the
<HI>Cape,</HI> usually go first to <HI>Batavia,</HI> before they coast <HI>India;</HI> which
gave us free leave to dedicate our selves to all the Pleasure this
Place could afford; which for its Excellencies may deserve to be
called Happy, as well as any the Ancients bestowed the Name of For∣tunate,
<HI>Macaria</HI> or <HI>Foelix</HI> on. It lies in 12 deg. <HI>South</HI> Latitude, Lon∣gitude
62 deg. 4 min. It is one of the Islands of <HI>Africa,</HI> though
lying in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Sea; yet because the Coasts of <HI>Africa</HI> extend
themselves to the Line on this <HI>North</HI> side of the <HI>Cape,</HI> we must take
these Adjacent Isles in the same Account: On the <HI>South-East</HI> lies
<HI>Meoty, North-West Mohelia,</HI> and <HI>North-East Comero,</HI> all Four Co∣lonies
of the <HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Arabians,</HI> or at least in subjection to them.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Johanna;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inland inaccessible.</NOTE> the innermost part we suppose to be
fruitful, by what the Verge of it declares; for to be satisfied in that
Point would be hardly worth the while, the Mountains requiring
more pains to conquer than would quit cost, they being altogether
inaccessible, or their Passages unknown to us.</P>
<P>The Relation therefore to be expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Circuit.</NOTE> must be of that lies lowest
and nearest the Sea. The Circuit I imagine to be almost an 100
Miles, all along which, it is variously cast into Hills, and furrowed
into Vales; as it Nature had plowed them on purpose for encrease.

time. There is also a Gourd esteemed of them more for the large
Shell than Meat; it will hold a Pailful, in Figure like a Man's Head,
and therefore called a <HI>Calabash.</HI></P>
<P>Rivers they have not many,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Rivulets the best Wa∣ter next the <HI>Thames</HI> Water.</NOTE> but Rivulets good store; and of such
Water, that next our <HI>Thames,</HI> it is the best, which is justly prefer∣red,
(I mean our <HI>Thames</HI> Water) because it bears a Body beyond
others, and therefore kept till the last to be spent, always reserving
a stock thereof to serve them home; for though it stink like Pud∣dle-water
when opened first, and have a Scum on it like Oil (which
the Coopers affirm they are as cautious to strike with their Adds on
the Cask for fear of taking fire, as of Brandy it self) yet let it stand
unbunged on the Deck twenty four hours, it recovers its goodness,
and is the only Water they rely on in an <HI>East-India</HI> Voyage, and
therefore they are careful to save it till the last.</P>
<P>Towns some few they are Masters of, but for Sumptuous Fabricks
none will be found here.</P>
<P>Their Chiefest Town bears the Name of the Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Town and Buildings.</NOTE> which is seated
along the Strand, under an high Hill; on one side refreshed with a
gentle gliding Stream; on the other side recreated with a fine Plain,
prodigal of its Fertility. The Town it self is to look on, an heap of
Ruins, nothing remaining but the Marks of former Industry (pro∣bably
the <HI>Portugals</HI>) here being left Walls of an huge thickness,
composed of Stone, and cemented with Lime: To every House a
Portal, but miserably defaced with Age; the Planks of their Doors
sewed together, their Buildings not exceeding one Story; against
these, Laziness has suggested them to lean their Flaggy Mansions:
Flags especially in their Villages (by them called Cajans, being Co-Coe-tree
Branches) upheld with some few Sticks, supplying both
Sides and Covering to their Cottages. They commonly order their
Model so, as to make a Quadrangle with only one Entrance, all the
rest being closed outwards without any Windows; in which every
House of Note on the Right-hand has a shady Contrivance, like the
Walks to our Tennis-Courts, but not so long; on the upper end of
which sits the Master of the Family on a Bed of Rattans, a kind of
Cane: Here he, with the Steward of his House, are observed by
his Slaves (who stand aloof) to spend the heat of the day.</P>
<P>Among these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two <HI>Mosques.</HI></NOTE> but at some remoteness from any of their Dwel∣lings,
are two Mosques, or places for Devotion, built after the
manner of our Churches (but for Magnificence much like their other
Structures) with Isles and Naves walled up to the very top; within
them only a place left for entrance at the West end. They are de∣cently
Matted on the Floor, though not hung so much as with a
Cobweb on the Walls; which they keep (and in that to be com∣mended)
very clean. In the Piatzos (for such their Porches had)
stands on the Right-hand a square Stone Cistern, full of Water; and
the whole without any Doors always open. The Nobler of the Two
has at the West-end a round Tower, not very high; to this like∣wise
belongs a more spacious Yard, filled with Tombs reared Man's
heighth, covering them with a falling Ledge atop, leaving open a
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
Port-hole at the North-end, where the Head lies, for a Lamp: To
inrich them, they are bestuck with <HI>China</HI> Ware of good value.</P>
<P>Having given you the Description thus far,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Court.</NOTE> I must crave leave
for my Error, in not giving it the Style of Regal before now: For
it proves to be the Seat of one of their Kings, which I had almost
forgot, had not my greedy Eye espied a House more eminently
seated, and more decently covered than the rest, but the Materials
not much different; only they have allotted him a little more Air
to breath forth his swelling Title, King of <HI>Johannah</HI> Town. Where∣fore
after a small Enquiry, it was manifest it was the Palace Royal;
nor did I much doubt it, after we had gained admission; where did
sit the King in state, at the upper end of such a Place as before was
taken notice of, on a Cott, or Bed, strewed with a Quilt. On a
Bench at each Elbow were placed two of his Nobles by him: We
being introduced, instead of Kissing his Majesty's Hand, he took us
one after another most graciously by the Fist, and by the Mouth of
his Interpreter pronounced us heartily welcome, and bad us take our
Seats according to our Qualities; which, after we had put our Hats on,
we did; and the Interpreter with great Respect took his on the Floor
crouching in the midst of us. In this manner, without shew of
dread or fear of being misconstrued, we talked freely of matters re∣lating
to both our States; as he first examining if we had any Gun∣powder
or Compass-Glasses to spare him? We seconded his Demands
with what regarded Provisions for our Voyage; for which License
our Captains are obliged to make him Presents of Scarlet-cloth, and
other <HI>Europe</HI> Rarities, that they may unmolested buy the Bullocks,
Cows, Goats and Hens of his Subjects. Both being at length out of
Discourse, or not very well understanding one another, he speaking
<HI>Arabick,</HI> we as good <HI>English</HI> as we could; we had liberty in this in∣terval
to survey the Gorgeousness of his Attire. On his Head he wore
a large White Turbat, and had as good a White Shirt on his Back;
from his Girdle half way his Legs, a Blue Silk Vest fringed with
Purple, without Shooes or Stockins to his Feet, which he often
pulling up into his Cott or Couch, would smilingly cross them, and
with his Nails claw off the Dirt. By him lay a Purple Silk Robe,
attended with a Black-guard of some a Dozen Slaves; compared
with whom he looked great, and was a comely well Limb'd Person,
though a Woolly-pated Coffery.</P>
<P>His Nobles (because we are not to meet with many of them)
pray take them in their best Liveries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Nobles.</NOTE> On their Crowns they wear
Caps of <HI>Arabian</HI> Needle-work intermixed with divers Colours;
which notwithstanding no bigger than Skull-caps, they move not
to the best Man in the Company; it being their Custom only to
<HI>Salam,</HI> giving a bow with their Hands across their Breasts: Their

they have, if not Cities, within the Country. And certain it is,
their Chief Governour is an <HI>Arabian</HI> Lord.</P>
<P>This <HI>Johanna</HI> Town is about Three quarters of a Mile in length,
and may contain Two hundred Houses; their Streets being no
broader than our Allies.</P>
<P>Villages are very thick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Villages. A pleasant Grove.</NOTE> and Cottages disperst in every place.</P>
<P>Every Valley makes a delightful Grove, one of which exceeding
all the rest, was cooled with two dainty Currents, decked with a
continual Spring, charming the Senses with the real Sweets of any
the most exquisitely feigned Paradises; to see Limes grow on Shrubs,
Leafed and Thorned like our Crabs, Oranges, (of which there is
a pleasing sort, though small, not giving place to our <HI>China</HI> ones)
tempting the Sight from a more exalted, and less suspicious Tree.
Over which the lofty Cocoes with unparallel'd straitness stretch
forth their Boughs, disposed in Ranks, as if ordered by the Skilful∣lest
Planter.</P>
<P>Lower than these, but with a Leaf far broader, stands the Curi∣ous
Plantan, loading its tender Body with a Fruit, whose Clusters
emulate the Grapes of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which burthened two Mens Shoulders;
below which, an odoriferous Plant seizes the Smell; and winding
through its subtile Meanders, revives the Faculties of the Brain:
Here the flourishing Papaw (in Taste like our Melons, and as big,
but growing on a Tree leafed like our Fig-tree), Citrons, Limons,
and many more, contend to indulge the Taste; the warbling Birds
the Ear; and all things, as if that general Curse were exempted,
strive to gratify the Life of Man.</P>
<P>Neither has Nature so played the Wanton here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hills are fruitful as well as the Vallies.</NOTE> as to be unmind∣ful
of the Ascending Hills, which in other places by chance are pro∣ductive,
but here they abound, and liberally bestow on the humble
Valleys: Notwithstanding the Clime it is situate under, bears the
reproach of that uninhabitable <HI>Zone;</HI> yet that Aspersion is blown off
by those admirably tempered Breizes off the Mountains.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are black,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temper of the Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> though not so black as at St. <HI>Iago,</HI> as
well Limb'd, and as well Featur'd; neither so tall, nor so proud as
they, but more honest: Whether out of fear of Punishment, or na∣tural
Integrity, may be left to conjecture: For our Fleet lying as
now at an Anchor, some years passed, they filched some slight
things from the <HI>English;</HI> as likewise some Sailers from them; the
Grievances on both sides known, and the Parties detected. Our
Commanders had their Men slashed publickly on Shore, when they
cut the Throats of theirs.</P>
<P>To proceed; They are like the Country they live in, innocent;
for as the one produces nothing hurtful, so they have always had
the Character of being harmless. They are courteous to Strangers,
but above all to the <HI>English;</HI> punctual in their Words, and as ready
to tax for breach of Promise: Lazy above measure, despising all
Mechanical Arts; and in them Necessity compels them to employing
their Priests; as in building Boats, making Mats. Yet in one thing
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
to be wondred at, for making Old Iron, which they covet mightily,
into Knives, or Tools, as sharp as Raisors; in other things rude∣ly
imitating, but not deserving the name of Artists.</P>
<P>The while we were there, they had a great Vessel on the Stocks;
Stocks like the Checks to our Long Boats; the Keel of it was a whole
Tree, no otherwise fitted than it grew, only the Branches lopped
off. To it, for Stem and Stern, were fastened two others, shorter;
on both sides Planks sewed to the main Timbers, with the Thread
of the Cocoe-nut, each Hole stopped with Pitch. Thus had they
raised it to the capacity of Thirty Tuns: When it will be finished, at
the rate they work, will be hard to guess.</P>
<P>They are Owners of several small Provoes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Vessels for Sea.</NOTE> of the same make,
and Canooses, cut out of one intire piece of Wood; poised with
Booms to keep them from over-setting; in these they paddle with
broad Sticks, not row as we with Oars.</P>
<P>They are very active at Climbing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Active at Climbing.</NOTE> Running like Jackanapes up
their Cocoe-nut Trees, which they do by twisting a Band to keep
close their Feet, as they raise their Bodies by their Arms grasped
about the Trees.</P>
<P>They are not solicitous for much to cover them, only a Clout to
hide their shame, trust with a String round about their Waists, in
which they stick their Knives, in a readiness to cut down their
Food from the Trees.</P>
<P>Their Slaves have a dejected Countenance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaves how known.</NOTE> distinguished by bore∣ing
their Ears: They sit on Stones, or low Seats, their Arms
folded like Monkies.</P>
<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skilled in Let∣ters and Astro∣logy.</NOTE> they are not so abject, but that they have the use of
Letters, and some science in Astrology, by what I can testify: For
walking the Country, and almost tired, I stept into an House, where
I saw a Man writing with a Pen made of a Cane, in the bottom of
a Bowl besmeared over with black; considering a-while, at length I
observed he made <HI>Arabian</HI> Characters, and aimed to draw a Scheme,
which when he had done, he poured Water upon, and stirring it
round with his Finger, wiped it out again, and as he did this, mut∣tered
seriously to himself, doing so thrice. I watched what he intend∣ed,
and found that a Woman lay sick there, and this Charm was
her Physick.</P>
<P>Besides this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ape-Printing.</NOTE> I have it on report from some that saw their Schools
for Education of their Youth, where they teach them to write, and
by Bundles of Characters tied together to Ape Printing. What they
make their Impression on, I cannot inform you; but Paper is no
despicable Commodity among them.</P>
<P>That <HI>Arabick</HI> is their Speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Speech:</NOTE> is without contradiction; with what
purity I am no competent Judge.</P>
<P>The Religion among them is <HI>Mahometism;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> their Priests not so
much exercised in Learning, as the Labour of their Hands.</P>
<P>Their Women are fat and short,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Women.</NOTE> not so big Breasted as those at

them from their Breasts below their Knees; about their Heads they
wear an Hairlace, or somewhat instead of it, not to tie their Hair
up, which is short enough; but it may be, as our Dames in <HI>England,</HI>
to keep the Wrinkles out of their Foreheads: In their Ears Mock-Jewels;
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
about their Necks and Wrists trifling Bracelets of Beads,
Glass, or Wire of Brass; about the small of their Legs Brass Chains,
and on their Fingers Rings of the same Metal. Seemingly fearful
of a White Man, as are their Children, who are much troubled
with the Navel-Rupture (<HI>Hernia umbilicalis</HI>),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Chil∣dren troubled with the Na∣vel Rupture.</NOTE> either from the
Windiness of their Food, or Ignorance of their Midwives in cutting
the Navel-string, when they design to make the Boys good measure;
which succeeds in these, for their <HI>Penis</HI> is of the larger shape. The
Wives are very obsequious to their Husbands, seldom stirring abroad,
doing the Drudgeries of the House.</P>
<P>They dress Fowls very well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way of killing Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> but kill them very barbarously, pul∣ling
first their Feathers off to the Wings, then by degrees raise the
Skin, after which Torture they as slowly cut their Throats, till they
have finished a short Litany, which is the Priest's Office, if at hand;
otherwise the Good Man of the House says Grace; they butchering
their Goats in as <HI>Jewish</HI> a manner.</P>
<P>Their usual Diet is the Fruits of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Diet.</NOTE> not caring much for
Flesh, though they have great store of Pullen, Goats, and Kine;
which last but small, and not very good Meat, their Fat cleaving
to the roof of the mouth; not so big as our <HI>Welsh</HI> Beasts, yet have
this peculiar, a Bunch of Fat betwixt their Shoulders, which eaten
tastes like Marrow.</P>
<P>Their Pasture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Corn.</NOTE> for want of Agriculture, rather Reeds than Grass;
they have Rice in the Low-lands, and a Pease called <HI>Garavance:</HI> On
the Sand near the Sea grows <HI>semper vivum maximum,</HI> from whose

I ever saw.</P>
<P>Honey and Mullasses they have good store.</P>
<P>Having thus taken a Survey of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their invete∣rate Hate to the <HI>Mohelians.</HI></NOTE> one would think Ambition
banished hence, and that Discord should have little countenance
from Subjects so alike contemptible. Such is the growth of that
Seed, that no Ground comes amiss to it: Here, where neither Care
nor Toil is burthensome, are they vexed with continual War by
their opposite Neighbour the <HI>Mohelian,</HI> whom formerly they used to
engage on Planks at Sea, casting Stones and Darts; since, by a better
Instinct, they have provided themselves of securer Vessels, and as
at this time devising greater, they adventure with better force, and
in shrewder Battels, beginning to enquire after Swords and Guns,
with the first of which the <HI>English</HI> do supply them: For which, and
a former Courtesy of a Vessel sent them to land some Men on the
Enemies Coasts, proceeds their more than ordinary love for the
<HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="25"/>
How these behave themselves in War, or with what Discipline,
is not in me to tell: Some Marks of their Valour many of them
bear about them, as the Badges of their greatest Honour, who have
their Limbs distorted, or Flesh beaten in. What the ground of
these Feuds are, we cannot learn; unless the bad Influence of some
malignant Planet, or else that Make-bate of the world, whose great∣est
business is Contention, should insinuate it into them. The <HI>Ara∣bian</HI>
Lords of each do strive to reconcile them; which if they do for
a time, it breaks out again in open War: And probable it is, that
these Animosities have rendred them liable to the Subjection they
are now in; whose very Islands else, with an united Force of Stones
and Arms to bear them, were able to defend them.</P>

not but that they mitigated the Heat <HI>in actu,</HI> tho as to its effects, it
proved more virulent, impregnating the Air with a diseased Consti∣tution,

<P>About the third Degree of <HI>North</HI>-Latitude we lost sight of the

<P>Having 8 deg.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Maldivae</HI> Islands.</NOTE> 53 min. <HI>North</HI> Latitude, we left the Sun to run his

<P>In the dead of the night a lamentable Outcry was caused by some

a Rock, with which these Seas abound, whereupon they cried out,
<HI>A Breach, a Breach;</HI> which made the Mates leap out of their Cabins
with the same grisly Look as if going to give up their last Accounts:
Here was Doomsday in its right Colours, Distraction, Horror, and
Amazement had seized on all, one commanding this, another acting
quite contrary; the Breach surrounding us, every one expected the
fatal stroke, when the Ship should be dashed in pieces. In this Pa∣nick
Fear, had any had so much heart as to have ventured a Compo∣sition
for his empty Noddle by looking over-board, he might have
discovered the Jig: For at length it was evident that only a Chorus
of Porpoises had taken the Sea in their Dance; which Morris once
over, the Seas were quiet, and our Men left to repose themselves
with a shorter Nap than they thought themselves like to have.</P>

<P>The poorer, of which multitudes are interspersed, both in their

<P>But the most insolent were the Artificers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How altered.</NOTE> as the Engravers, Re∣finers,
Goldsmiths, Carpenters, and the like; who behaved them∣selves
not only disrespectfully to their Superiours, but tyrannically to

those of a viler Rank; as the Husbandmen and Labourers. Whereupon
they jointly conspired their Ruin, and with that their own Slavery; ta∣king
the <HI>Moors</HI> to their assistance, who not only reduced the Usurpers
to Composition, which was, That they should be accounted the Off∣scum
of the People, and as base as the <HI>Holencores</HI> (whom they ac∣count
so, because they Defile themselves by eating any thing, and do
all servile Offices) and not be permitted to ride in a <HI>Palenkeen</HI> at their
Festivals or Nuptials, but on Horseback, which they count an high
Disgrace; but they also took the Power into their own hand; which
though Despotical, the <HI>Gentus</HI> endure, rather than endeavour the re∣covery
of their former Liberty, and to subvert it from a Monarchy
into an Aristocracy.</P>
<P>Their King reigning is a <HI>Moor,</HI> raised to the Throne from the
lowest ebb of Fortune.</P>
<P>For it being in the breast of the Regent to appoint his Successor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their King a <HI>Chias Moor.</HI></NOTE>
his Predecessor, on defect of his own Children, raised him; by the
practice of <HI>Siegmanjaffa,</HI> his Chief Eunuch (who are made in this
Kingdom the prime Ministers of State) partly to strengthen his own
Interest by ingratiating with the Heir Apparent, and partly out of
gratitude to the Young man's Father, a Great Man, and of the Bloud-Royal,
who, when alive, was the promoter of <HI>Siegmanjaffa:</HI> This
same Prince of the <HI>Chias,</HI> or <HI>Sophian</HI> Extract, was raked out of the
Embers of Oblivion.</P>
<P>Where you must note,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Noble∣mens Estates fall to the King at their Deaths.</NOTE> That though his Father expired a Blazing
Comet in the Court, yet at the death of any Nobleman, his Wealth
falls all into the King's hands; whereby this poor Gentleman for a
long time lived an obscure and miserable Life, no one taking his
word for the Victuals he put into his Belly: But upon the old King's
importunity for one to sway the Scepter after him of his own Line,
<HI>Siegmanjaffa</HI> urged him; and placed him poor and lean as he was,
where the King might see him, but not he the King.</P>
<P>At first the King rejected him, as having no promising look; still
<HI>Siegmanjaffa</HI> interceded, and desired his Lord to allow him like a
Gentleman, and see to what use he would expend his Money:
Which condescended to, a <HI>Brachmin</HI> (who are become the Farmers
of the King's Rents) was dispatched to offer him the Loan of Mo∣ney,
which he willingly accepted of, and therewith put himself into
an handsome Equipage, both for Apparel and Attendants (which
specious Shews recommend here more than profoundness of parts)
and withal Fed and Whored (which is a great point of Manhood) as
well as the best of them. Wherefore after a short time he was again
brought into the King's Presence, who now began to have some
hopes of him; and therefore to try him farther, he gave him a con∣stant
supply of Money; and bad <HI>Siegmanjaffa</HI> put him on some lau∣dable
Enterprize in his Army, of which <HI>Siegmanjaffa</HI> was General;
which he undertook with much Alacrity, and behaved himself with
that Gallantry, that at length the Old King sent him a Tipstaff with
a Royal Robe, requiring him to come to Court in one of the King's
own <HI>Palenkeens:</HI> At which he was dismay'd, Saying he should never
return to his House again.</P>
<P>However, by <HI>Siegmanjaffa</HI>'s encouragement he apparelled him∣self,
and rode on the King's <HI>Palenkeen:</HI> His Jealousy was grounded
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
on a barbarous Custom of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Monarchs, who when any
Subject becomes suspected, send them alike honourable Presents with
those in Favour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The barba∣rous Custom of Poysoning among the <HI>Eastern</HI> Mo∣narchs.</NOTE> which in their receit only shall testify to the World
the King's Displeasure, though they whom they are designed for,

plead for themselves. But he was assured no ill Intentions were to∣wards
him when speaking with the King face to face, he declared
him his Successor to the Crown, which not long after he was esta∣blished
in by the Death of his Master.</P>
<P>His Residence is at <HI>Gulconda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gulconda</HI> is the Metropolis, and gives Name to the Kingdom. The Prime Minister an Eunuch. The Wealth how raised.</NOTE> the Metropolis, and bearing the

exacting every Man's Estate when he pleases, mulcting them at his

of an Hundred thousand Horse and Foot, when all together; besides
Two hundred Elephants in continual readiness, which are provided

<P>All that he consumes is on his Voluptuousness, with which he is
swallowed up.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Gulconda</HI> extends from 10 deg.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bigness of the King∣dom.</NOTE> <HI>North</HI> Latitude,

Soldiers and Followers; having an Elephant led before his <HI>Palenkeen,</HI>

nor to ride on any but Females, unless of the Royal Family, who
may only mount a Male to ride in State through their Cities. His
Substitute here is a <HI>Chias Moor,</HI> who takes charge of the Stores every
Night.</P>
<P>Over the <HI>Gentues</HI> they keep a strict hand, entrusting them with no

as hot as the Steam from an Oven, by the reflecting of the
Sun upon the Sands, which are huried about the Marshes. When
they feel themselves freest from Sickness, though all Perspiration
through the Pores by Sweat is dried up: From the beginning of
<HI>May</HI> they are refreshed with cooling Showers, which at length with
the overflowing Sea cause an Inu dation; in which space, the Air
growing foggy, <HI>Empyema's</HI> and Fluxes are rifest; and Swarms of Ants,
<HI>Muskeetoes,</HI> Flies, and stinking <HI>Chints, Cimices, &amp;c.</HI> breed and infest

a Servant to keep them from them with a Fan, without which there
is no sleeping.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these provisions, yet there is another Insect more
disturbing than these, and not to be escaped but by this Device, and
that is the Ant, which creeps up to all their Quarters, and between
their Beds, if the Bed-Posts were not set in Pans of Water to hin∣der
their Progress. <HI>Chinces</HI> stick among the Cotton, and in rotten

When we came they were feeding out of their Houses on Sugar-Canes
fresh gathered and administred by their Keepers: Alighting
from our <HI>Palenkeens,</HI> they loosed one which was Fourteen Feet high,
and the Black clawing his Poll with an Iron Engine, he stooped
down for him to get up, and being upon his Back guided him as he
listed. His Body is a Symetrical Deformity (if I may so say);
the Hanches and Quarters clapt together seem so many heaps; his
Neck short, flapping Ears like Scates, little-Eye'd, a broad Face,
from which drops his <HI>Proboscis</HI> or Trunk, thrusting it out, or shriveling
it in, as he chuses; through its Hollow he sucks his Liquor, and with
two Fingers, as it were, reaches the Fodder, shaking off the dirt
against his Thigh, or Vermin, such as Mice, which he abhors, he
brings it under to his Mouth, from whence proceed two huge Tusks
of Ivory for Defence, not Mastication, for which he is supplied with∣in
with others; his Tail is curt: He shuffles an end a great Pace,
moving all the Joints of his Legs, though the Motion of his Hinder-Legs
imitate Human Progression, having a <HI>Patella</HI> or Knee-Pan
afore, not articulated behind as other four-footed Beasts are. When
he stands, his Legs appear so many Columns scollop'd at bottom,
being flat-hoof'd.</P>
<P>The She's have their Paps under their Bowels afore, as <HI>Laurentius</HI>
truly relates.</P>
<P>Their Modesty in ingendring has given matter for dispute, though
doubtless they perform it after the manner of other Beasts. They
are of a Mouse-Colour. With their Trunks they strike a violent
Blow, and are taught to sling Iron Links, to the destruction of their
Enemies. That they draw their weighty Cannon is certain; but
that they engage with smaller on their Back, I am no Eye-Witness.</P>

<P>I Went ashore in a <HI>Mussoola,</HI> a Boat wherein ten Men paddle, the

we could not get ashore, the Bar knocking in pieces all that are

kept by half a dozen Ordnance at each side the Water-gate, besides
an Halfmoon of Fire-Guns. At both Points are mounted twelve
Guns eying the Sea, <HI>Maderas,</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas;</HI> under these in a Line
stand Pallisadoes, reaching from the Wall to the Sea; and hedge in

Fourth, where are lodged a Dozen Guns more that grin upon <HI>Ma∣deras,</HI>

Designs, as the raising an Army against <HI>Spain;</HI> to the same intent
it was necessary for him to think of the continuing a Supply of
Money: He therefore (omitting other ways of enriching his Ex∣chequer)
put in a Stock with his Merchant-Adventurers, fitting
out a Fleet of Twenty Sail of lusty Ships, to settle a Trade in <HI>India,</HI>
committing them to the Charge and Conduct of a Viceroy; who
coming safe about the <HI>Cape,</HI> touched at St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they
did but little besides burying their Viceroy, and dispatching four

In the stead of the Viceroy deceased, the now reigning succeeded.</P>
<P>From thence they sailed to <HI>Surat,</HI> where the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> endowed
them with Immunities of Traffick.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixteen arrive at <HI>Surat.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In the mean while a second War betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> was
fomented,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> in the which the <HI>French</HI> threw off the protecting the

his newly hatch'd Factory at <HI>Surat</HI> (whether out of its not an∣swering
his expectations, or his earnestness in prosecuting the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>
by Sea as well as by Land, may be known by those that are
more intelligent in his Affairs at Home), sense of Honour, obliged
his Fleet in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> to New Adventures; and want of Money,
the Merchants at <HI>Surat</HI> to Trade upon the Credit of the <HI>French</HI> King.</P>
<P>With fourteen Sail of Ships they roved on the Coasts of <HI>Malabar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> take <HI>Trincoma∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> from the <HI>Dutch.</HI></NOTE>
and at last came to the Island <HI>Ceilon,</HI> setting upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Trin∣comalai,</HI>
and forced it; but being destitute of Provisions forsook it,
after the loss of abundance of their Men, and four of their Ships.</P>
<P>From whence they passed along the Coast of <HI>Coromandel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Thomas</HI> from the <HI>Moors.</HI></NOTE> and with
Ten Sail came before St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> demanding Victuals of the <HI>Moors;</HI>
but they denying, they brought their Ships to bear upon the Fort,
and landing some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall Pieces they stormed it, driving the <HI>Moors</HI> to
the search of new Dwellings.</P>
<P>After they had taken it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fortify it.</NOTE> they broke up their weather-beaten Vessels,
and brought ashore their Ordnance, keeping their Trenches within,
and mounting it with the Sea without; they still maintain it maugre
all the great Armies the King of <HI>Gulconda</HI> has sent against it.</P>
<P>Till now the 18<SUP>th</SUP> Month of its Siege,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dutch</HI> come against it.</NOTE> and the fourth year of their

<P>For all that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Viceroy by a Strata∣gem brings in his Ship.</NOTE> the Viceroy, who had then been gone out with four
Sail, but returning alone, got betwixt them and the Fort with his
single Ship in the Night: The Device this; He left his Light upon
a <HI>Catamaran,</HI> so that they thought him at an Anchor without them,
when the next Morn he play'd upon them from under the Fort:
This Exploit, and the bruit of our Approach, made them withdraw
to the <HI>Southward</HI> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>esh Recruits of Men and Ammunition.</P>
<P>Which gave the <HI>French</HI> encouragement to sally out upon the <HI>Moors</HI>
(they before being beaten from their Works near the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> sally out upon the <HI>Moors.</HI></NOTE> had de∣camped

the enraged <HI>Moors</HI> to enhanse the Price of our Curiosity) we
will take a Survey</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of St. Thomas.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a City that formerly for Riches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of St. <HI>Thomas.</HI></NOTE> Pride, and Luxury, was se∣cond
to none in <HI>India;</HI> but since, by the mutability of Fortune,
it has abated much of its adored Excellencies.</P>
<P>The Sea on one side greets its Marble Walls, on the other a Chain
of Hills intercepts the Violence of the inflaming Heat; one of
which, called St. <HI>Thomas</HI> his Mount, is famous for his Sepulture, (in
Honour of whom a Chappel is dedicated, the Head Priest of which
was once the Metropolitan Bishop of <HI>India</HI>), and for a Tree called
<HI>Arbor Tristis,</HI> which withers in the Day, and blossoms in the Night.</P>
<P>About this Mount live a Cast of People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Thomas</HI> Christians.</NOTE> one of whose Legs are as
big as an Elephant's; which gives occasion for the divulging it to
be a Judgment on them, as the Generation of the Assassins and Mur∣therers
of the Blessed Apostle St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> one of whom I saw at
<HI>Fort St. George.</HI></P>
<P>Within the Walls seven Churches answer to as many Gates; the
Rubbish of whose stupendious Heaps do justify the truth of what is
predicated in relation to its pristine State.</P>
<P>The Builders of it were the <HI>Portugals.</HI></P>
<P>The Confounders the <HI>Moors,</HI> who surprized them wallowing in
their Wealth and Wantonness.</P>
<P>The present Competitors are the <HI>French,</HI> who are very unlikely to
keep it (not for want of Valour, but for that few and unprovided,
are not able long to resist multitudes) the <HI>Moors,</HI> and thirdly, the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> whose Interests are to destroy the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>India;</HI> Which
the <HI>French</HI> foreseeing, had wisely solicited a Truce with <HI>Gulconda,</HI>
and had hopes of that King's complying, till the Arrival of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> when they could not be heard. For considering a Kindness
extorted not so obliging as that freely offered, and his Honour at∣tainted
by their Swords being still in their hands, he closed with
the Hatred of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for their final Extirpation.</P>
<P>Before which be accomplished, he may chance to find it an hard
Task, especially had the <HI>French</HI> and hopes of Succours: For now
they are 600 strong in the Fort and Ships, all stout Fellows, every
Soldier fit to be a Commander. Their greatest scarcity will be of
Food, with which had not the <HI>English</HI> privately befriended them,
they could not have subsisted hitherto. Though the <HI>English,</HI> should
they have War with <HI>France,</HI> would find them to be an Annoyance to
their Trade: So that were the City again in the hands of the <HI>Moors,</HI>
or even with the Ground, it were better for us.</P>
<P>Here it may be queried,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King of <HI>Gul∣conda</HI> weak at Sea.</NOTE> Why <HI>Gulconda</HI> being a Potent Prince,
should permit Garisons to be in the hands of Aliens? To this may be
answered, That this of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> was founded when the <HI>Indians</HI>
were naked and unarm'd. But this satisfies not the Question, since
that the <HI>Moors</HI> having conquered it, they again offered it the <HI>Portu∣gals,</HI>
who slighted the Propositions, unless they would restore them
their Guns which they carried away with them. The true reason
then is this, That <HI>Gulconda,</HI> as all the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes are, is weak at
<PB N="44" REF="39"/>
Sea; therefore it is a Maxim among them to commit their Strong∣holds
on the Sea-Coasts to those they can call their Friends, for not
only preventing Invasions at the Charge and Courage of Foreigners;
but they (not being Absolute, but subject to the Authority of the
<HI>Great Mogul</HI>) upon any Defeat, have these Places as sure Asylums
of Retreat.</P>
<P>Amidst these Scenes of Affairs, what next offers to our View, is
odd in it self, To find an Aptness in these People to improve all Gain∣ful
Arts, and not to have advanced one footstep from the false Ru∣diments
either of Religion or Customs of the Old World; for they
do in my mind more than imitate, pertinaciously holding their Anti∣quities
of <HI>Pan, Ceres,</HI> and <HI>Flora;</HI> as may appear by this and other
following Farces.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of <HI>August,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Festival of the <HI>Gentu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></NOTE> when their Corn was in the
Blade, and they were expecting a plentiful Crop, the <HI>Gentues</HI> of <HI>Ma∣deras</HI>
held a Feast in Memory of some of their Saints of the Devil's
canonizing.</P>
<P>Their Ceremonies were usher'd in with Tumult; in the middle of
them were carried their Gods in State, garnished with the Riches of
the <HI>Orient;</HI> they were cut in horrid Shapes; the reason of which,
<HI>Divina assimulatio est causa diversitatis in rebus;</HI> though I should al∣low
the diversity of Creatures in all Orders of the World, hath no
other aim but to represent the Divinity, by whatsoever Image,
yet I cannot imagine such Deformities could ever be invented for
that end. Before them went the <HI>Brachmins,</HI> making a Noise with
their loud Musick; after them their dancing Wenches (who always
Morning and Evening tumble afore their Gods, which with some
Mimical Gesture is all their Dancing) with Ephods of Silk and
Gold upon their Breasts: With these in a Ring hand in hand, were
the dancing Boys, all naked but a Clout about their Privities, like
the <HI>Bacchanalian</HI> Youths that used to revel it with <HI>Flora</HI>'s Strum∣pets
through the Streets of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Thus went they in Procession, till they came to a Pageant, where∣on
was pictured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Gods; from whence, over a cross Piece of
Timber, hung a Cocoa Nut, which the Hinds in Yellow Caps, and
Clouts about their Wastes, striving to hit with a great Club, are
washed by a Shower of Water, by the <HI>Brachmins</HI> placed on purpose;
after a long Trial of their Patience, they suffer one to bear it away
in Triumph.</P>
<P>All the time of their Sport, <HI>Beetle</HI> and <HI>Cocoa-Nuts</HI> are scattered
among the People, for which they scramble as earnestly as if they
were Medals at Coronations.</P>
<P>On a Pageant over-against the Pagod they had a Set of Dancers
handed like Puppits, to the amusing of the Mobile.</P>
<P>Then setting open the Gates of the Pagod, they received all the
unsanctified Crew, and shut them in; where how they conclude
their Rites, is not to be divulged, Ignorance with them being the
Mother of Devotion.</P>
<P>At <HI>Triblitore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Triblitore.</NOTE> four Miles <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Maderas,</HI> is a Pagod transcend∣ing
both in respect of Building and Antiquity; there being Chara∣cters,
the Expounders of the <HI>Gentu</HI> Language or Holy Writ under∣stand
not: To this Mother-Pagod, at certain Seasons of the Year,
<PB N="45" REF="39"/>
long Pilgrimages are set on foot, at what time there is an innume∣rable
Concourse, whereat some of the Visitants count it meritorious
to be trod to death under a weighty Chariot of Iron made for the
carriage of their Deities; and with themselves lay their Wives and
Children to undergo the same Self-martyrdom.</P>
<P>In one of their open <HI>Pagods</HI> or Chappels, stands a Venerable Sir at
the upper end, with the Attendants of Lamps and Bats, to whom
they pay a world of Worship: Who this should be, unless that <HI>Pe∣riomel,</HI>
from whose Head the <HI>Brachmins,</HI> Pallas-like fable their ori∣gination,
I am yet to seek.</P>
<P>In the way hither are store of <HI>Antilopes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antilopes.</NOTE> not to be taken but by a
Decoy made of Green Boughs, wherein a Man hides himself, and
walking with this Bush upon his Back, gains so near on them,
while grazing or browzing rather on Shrubs or Bushes, as to hit one
with an Arrow, when it may be run down with Dogs, the rest of
the Herd shunning it: They are of a delicater shape and make
than a Deer, their Horns not jagged, but turned as an Unicorn's;
nor spread into Branches, but straight, and long, and tapering,
rooted on the <HI>Os frontis,</HI> springing up on both sides.</P>
<P>At the end of <HI>August</HI> one of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Junks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen of the <HI>South.</HI></NOTE> we found in the
Road, set Sail for <HI>Achein;</HI> where is Gold, and the Island thought
by some to be <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>Ophir;</HI> and the Queen thereof, by whom it
is constantly governed, confidently reported to be the Queen of the
<HI>South, Achein</HI> being on the Island <HI>Sumatra</HI> in the <HI>South</HI> Seas.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>September</HI> only Seven of our Ten Ships returned from
<HI>Mechlapatan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">We fight the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and lose three Ships.</NOTE> with their wounded Men and torn Hulks, who had
met the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and tried their Force; two days after they were
dispatched from <HI>Mechlapatan,</HI> in <HI>Pettipolee</HI> Bay, where as soon as
Day began to peep, a Thicket of Twenty Sail of our Enemies were
discovered stemming the flowing Tide at an Anchor. Our Fleet
might have passed them without giving Battel; but that the un∣daunted
<HI>Britains</HI> scorned to fly, chusing rather to lye a Battery for
them, than cowardly to flinch: Wherefore they braced their Sails to
the Masts, and being to Leeward, stayed for the Wind which favoured
the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> who coming up with our Fleet, made as if they
would have gone by them; but were intercepted by the headmost
of ours: Which perceived by the forwardest of theirs, they sent their
Shallops aboard their Admiral for Orders, for <HI>vis consilii expers mole
ruit suâ,</HI> Strength void of Counsel sinks with its proper weight; which
was but too truly the fault of our Commanders, over-confident of
their own Conduct, and lightly regarding the Authority of their Ge∣neral.</P>
<P>When they came back again,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bombaim</HI> and <HI>London</HI> disa∣bled.</NOTE> they brought their Fleet up in a
Body, and after the Signal given, it thundred and hailed Bullets till
Night.</P>
<P>The first that felt the warmth of the Showres, was the <HI>Bombaim;</HI>
who after an hours hot dispute almost board and board with one of
their biggest Ships, bore off hardly able to keep above water, and
never came in again, having received 80 Shot in her Hull, and
some between Wind and Water, so that in the Hold there was
four Feet and an half Water; besides innumerable in her Rigging,
Masts and Sails, from those that pelted at a distance.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="40"/>
The next Ship that behaved her self stoutly, was the Admiral's;
who lost 34 of her Men by the scurvy Accidents of Powder 17 of
them were slain outright.</P>
<P>But the Three fatal Ships were the <HI>Antilope,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antilope <HI>sunk.</HI> President <HI>and</HI> Sampson <HI>taken.</HI></NOTE> Captain <HI>Golsbery;</HI>
the <HI>Sampson,</HI> Captain <HI>Ernnig,</HI> Reer-Admiral; and the <HI>President,</HI> Vice-Admiral
Captain <HI>Hide,</HI> whose rigid Fortune saved the drooping Ho∣nour
of the <HI>English,</HI> which is not less conspicuous in Adversity than
in Prosperity. For having sustained the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt of the day, they left
not off when they were penned in by the Enemy, and deserted by
their Friends: For by Five in the Afternoon the <HI>London</HI> bore away
to stop her Leaks, the rest were glad to follow; and left them to
maintain so unequal a Fight. The Vice-Admiral was seen to blow
up his Decks several times, distributing the <HI>Hollanders</HI> as Doles to
the Fishes, and left not off till Night parted the Fray; so that what
became of them our Ships could give us no account.</P>
<P>Six days since this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dutch</HI> Forces march to raise the Siege of St. <HI>Thomas.</HI></NOTE> a Thousand Men under <HI>Dutch</HI> Colours, with
a dozen Carriages with great Brass Pieces, marched by out of shot
of our Leaguers, and fixed their Standard with the <HI>Moors</HI> in sight
of St. <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>The next day was sent from <HI>Mechlapatan</HI> hither, the Copy of a
Letter from Captain <HI>Hide,</HI> which assured us of his being alive, but
wounded, his Ship as it is, at the disposal of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> as also Cap∣tain
<HI>Ernnig</HI>'s, though he was killed first: That Captain <HI>Golsbery</HI> sunk
his, rather than it should go to <HI>Batavia;</HI> that he, and what Men
could shift for themseves, were safe.</P>
<P>It may be wondred why the <HI>French</HI> did not assist us, they being
as much at odds with the <HI>Dutch</HI> as we; the reality is, they offered
their Devoirs, but we must equip their Ships; for which our Com∣manders
pretended lack of Orders as well as Money and Materials:
Though the plain truth was, they despised kindness, thinking it be∣neath
them to be beholden to them for their help.</P>
<P><HI>The Factories of the</HI> Hollanders <HI>on this Coast,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wealth and Power of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> <HI>are</HI> Ceilon, Jaffna∣patan,

<P>The <HI>Danes</HI> have a few, the <HI>French</HI> less.</P>
<P>In the <HI>South Sea,</HI> under the Agent of <HI>Bantam,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> have

from our <HI>East India</HI> Company, who are for the present Profit, not

<P>These,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Policy in securing.</NOTE> as they gain ground, secure it by vast Expences, raising
Forts, and maintaining Souldiers: Ours are for raising Auctions,
and retrenching Charges; bidding the next Age grow rich as they
have done, but not affording them the means.</P>
<P>Our Ships that were left,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Seven Ships di∣spatched for the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coast.</NOTE> were now sooner repaired, than fraited
with their <HI>Salt Peter</HI> and Fine Cloth; and had leave to make the best
of their way for the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coast in less than a Fortnight's time,
when it was determined to keep off to Sea, as well to escape the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI>
as the Violence of the <HI>Mossoons;</HI> who being upon the point
of shifting their Quarters, are most dangerous near the Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="40"/>
These <HI>Mossoons</HI> or <HI>Monsoons,</HI> are the Winds and Rains customary
to all <HI>India,</HI> varying here only in respect of the Mountains.</P>
<P>Therefore on these Coasts the <HI>South Winds</HI> blow for Eight Months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Monsoons</HI> on both Coasts, and Observations thereon.</NOTE>
four of which are <HI>May, June, July, August.</HI> Then the Sun is so
strong, that it would be uninhabitable, did not there fall at Night
those Vapours which the Sun draws up in the Day; and by decli∣ning
of his exorbitant Heat, leaves them to be condensated at Night;
when the Air is more gross, and the Earth is cooled either by thick
Mists, or a more palpable Moisture (which you may call pouring
Showres) and thereby made fertile, which otherwise would be in∣supportable
and barren.</P>
<P>That which makes this the more plausible is, That the <HI>Asiatick
India intra Gangem,</HI> is a <HI>Pene Insula,</HI> and the Seas lie near round the
Land.</P>
<P>But about the Sun's retiring to his <HI>Southern</HI> Tropick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heats tempered by Art.</NOTE> the Winds
take their <HI>Northern</HI> Course, the Rains do cease, and the Sea alters
its Current to the <HI>South,</HI> when by the innate coldness of these Blasts
the Clime becomes more habitable, unless where the Sands cause a
reflection of heat, as at <HI>Mechlapatan;</HI> where they keep close all Day
for three or four Months together, (though then the <HI>North Wind</HI>
begins to abate its impetuosity, and the <HI>South Winds</HI> prevail) repel∣ling
the Heat by a course wet Cloath, continually hanging before
their Chamber-windows; which not only resists the Ambient Air,
but by the afflux of Nitrous Particles from within, does cast a Chil∣ness
over the Room; without which, the Walls, that for that in∣tent
are plastered, would be so hot, you could not abide your Hand
on them; the same way they have of cooling their Liquors, by a
wet Cloth wrapped about their Gurgulets and Jars, which are Ves∣sels
made of a porous kind of Earth; the best of <HI>Maecha,</HI> reasonable
good from <HI>Goa,</HI> which are carried with them in this nature where∣ever
they travel.</P>
<P>Before we dismiss this Discourse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rains more inter∣mitting on the Coast of <HI>Coromandel.</HI></NOTE> it may be noted, That the Rains
on this Coast are more intermitting than on the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coast, so
that they can loose hence their Ships for <HI>Persia, Maecha</HI> and <HI>Juddah,</HI>
and to the <HI>South Seas</HI> in those Months they are Wind-bound on the
other Coast: for having the Land-Breezes to carry them off to Sea,
the <HI>Mossoons</HI> are more favourable.</P>
<P>Concerning the Regularities of these Winds, perhaps some others
may give patter Guesses than my self, who am not conceited enough
to dogmatize.</P>
<P>Among the many that be alledged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of the <HI>Massoons</HI> inquired into.</NOTE> I am not fond of any, though
this have won a little upon my Opinion; That the Sun may be as
well the reason why these Winds should observe his Annual Circum∣rotation;
as that the Ebbings and Flowings of the Sea, by the
Moon's meer depression of Air, should be ascribed to her Monthly
Revolutions.</P>
<P>And here one thing may be worthy our Curiosity, That after the
Seasons of the Heats and Rains, the Rivers <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges</HI> are said
to swell their Banks, and thereby abundantly to encrease the Border∣ing
Countries, where these Rains are less frequent: Whence, it may
be, some insight may be had for the Overflows of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which has
set so many Wits on the Tenterhooks, where it is reported it never
<PB N="48" REF="41"/>
rains: But in the Countreys near the supposed Sourse of <HI>Nile,</HI> it does
to Excess.</P>
<P>But you who have greater Reading and Leisure to digest these
Metaphysical Notions, will mightily oblige me to furnish me with
your solider Arguments.</P>
<P>Among which I would intreat you to consider the Variety of the
Loadstone in the common Chart: For what the incomparably Inge∣nuous
<HI>Des Cartes</HI> has wrote on that Subject, acquiesces only in mo∣dest
Hypotheticks, not any ways informing the Understanding to a
clear Apprehension; but after he has brought it through the Maze
of Probabilities, he parts with it at the same Predicament it entred.</P>
<P>Not to deviate any longer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Tail of the Elephant.</NOTE> we are now winding about the <HI>South-West</HI>
part of <HI>Ceilon;</HI> where we have the <HI>Tail of the Elephant</HI> full in
our mouths; a Constellation by the <HI>Portugals</HI> called <HI>Rabo del Ele∣phanto,</HI>
known for the breaking up of the <HI>Munsoons,</HI> which is the last
Flory this Season makes, generally concluding with <HI>September,</HI>
which goes out with dismal Storms.</P>
<P>Yet so good is Providence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water-Snakes.</NOTE> as to warn us here, when all is obscured,
by <HI>Water-Snakes,</HI> of our too near approach to the Land; which are
as sure Presages on the <HI>Indian</HI> Coasts, as the <HI>Cape</HI>-Birds are there.</P>
<P>Here the Mountains running <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe∣rence on the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coast.</NOTE> the Winds are to the
<HI>East</HI> of the <HI>South,</HI> and to the <HI>West</HI> of the <HI>North;</HI> else quadrating
with those on <HI>Coromandel;</HI> only here in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May</HI> the Winds
are variable, and then they hasten to leave these Coasts for <HI>Persia,</HI> the
<HI>Red-Sea,</HI> and <HI>South-Seas,</HI> or those make in that are to return hither;
otherwise they run an hazard of losing their Voyage, when the <HI>South</HI>

<HI>September,</HI> or beginning of <HI>October:</HI> Then from the <HI>North</HI> to the
<HI>North-West</HI> sets in again; and this Course is observed mostly on all
the <HI>Indian</HI> Shores, only some few days different in the beginning and
ending, which happen to the <HI>South,</HI> and in Lands commonly earlier

drove 30 Leagues to Leeward of the Cape, by the broken <HI>Portugueze</HI>

the Natives having hardly shaken off the fear of the <HI>Dutch:</HI>
For a Boat with Sails of Mats (all their small Boats making them
their Sails) came to take a Survey of us, and made towards us un∣certainly;
when after several Fetches to and again, at last they were
within Call of us: We saw two <HI>Sumbrero's</HI> (a Mark for some of
Quality) held up in the Boat-stern, and a Man stand up and wave
his Hat, which made our Master stretch his Throat to know what
he was; whereupon down went the <HI>Sumbrero's</HI> held up in the Boat∣stern,
the Boat cleverly tacked, and the Men tugged stoutly at their

mann'd three Boats after them, they return'd with their Labour for
their Pains, the Boat getting safe from them. At Night another Boat

answered <HI>English,</HI> he boarded us, and told us our unadvised Salutes
were level'd at an <HI>English</HI> Merchant sent off by the Chief, who not∣withstanding

<P>From whence I went to observe the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Wares.</NOTE> which is miserably

<P>Amongst whom were <HI>Shroffs,</HI> or Money-changers. On one side

another Lane, at whose end there was a Mosque.</P>
<P>Their Houses are little Hovels or Hogsties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses mean.</NOTE> the best of them scarce
worthy the Name of a Booth. The <HI>English</HI> House is in the fashion
with the rest, covered all over with <HI>Cajans,</HI> and seated (which they
mightily affect) under Trees. The People are Tawny, not Black.
Their Language <HI>Malabar.</HI> Here is a Specimen of their Character.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>They are subject to the <HI>Zamerhin</HI> of <HI>Calicut,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Malabar</HI> Cha∣racter.</NOTE> who sent hither his
Delegate to welcome us, and invite us to a Continuance of Trade:
He gave our Fleet seven Guns, which were planted near the Water∣side;
which Compliment was returned by the Fleet.</P>
<P>The Nation is distinguished by Three Ranks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Nation how distin∣guished.</NOTE> The Priests make
the first; they come abroad in several distracted Postures, sometimes
all naked, plaister'd over with Ashes, their Hair plaited like an
Horse's Tail; at other times appearing less barbarous, being cover∣ed,
but as Stoical in their Behaviour.</P>
<P>The second Form is that of the <HI>Nobiles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Nairo's.</HI></NOTE> who are all bred Soldiers,
and therefore called <HI>Nairo's;</HI> the one part of them wearing naked
Swords rampant in one hand, and a Target made of a Buffola's Hide
lacquer'd and curiously painted in the other, with which they defend
themselves as assuredly as with an Iron Shield; the rest of them
walk with a spiked Lance barbed, as long as a Javelin, and poised at
the But end with Lead; at darting of which they are very expert.</P>
<P>The last and lowest are the Artizans and Tillers of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Husband∣men.</NOTE> of
which here are no great store, being ever negligent in that they reap
the least Benefit by; wherefore their Vassals are commonly employed
in that service, they being Drudges both to their Masters and Prince,
who here as in all <HI>India</HI> is sole Proprietor of Lands; allowing the Oc∣cupiers
no more than a bare Subsistence, and not that when a bad Year
fills not the Publick Granaries; drubbing the poor Hinds till their
<PB N="53" REF="44"/>
Bones rattle in their Skins, they being forced often to sell their Chil∣dren
for Rice, which is the best here on this Coast of any place else
in the whole World.</P>
<P>In Habit they excel not one another;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Men how clad.</NOTE> the Peer as well as Peasant,
wrapping only a <HI>Lunga</HI> about his Middle, and thence reaching to his
Knees. Only their Men of Honour that have deserved it from the
<HI>Zamerhin,</HI> have their Wrists rounded with thick golden Bracelets,
illustrated with Precious Stones.</P>
<P>Their Women are nearer white than the Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Wo∣men.</NOTE> of an Olive or
Sallow Colour, cloathed as they on <HI>Coromandel,</HI> stretching their
Ears with Gold and Gems.</P>
<P>In Manners the Natives are slovenly enough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners and Religion.</NOTE> if not brutish. In
Religion most Heathens, though the Infection of <HI>Mahometism</HI> is con∣tagious
among them.</P>
<P>They have Hospitals here for Cows;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hospitals for Cows.</NOTE> and are charitable to Dogs,
providing for them abroad, but not suffer them to defile them with∣in
Doors; being more merciful to Beasts than Men.</P>
<P>Of Christians here are not an inconsiderable number.<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Thomas</HI> Christians.</NOTE> Here are also
those Elephant-Legged St. <HI>Thomeans,</HI> which the unbiassed Enquirers
will tell you chances to them two ways: By the Venom of a cer∣tain
Snake, for which the <HI>Jangies</HI> or Pilgrims furnish them with a
Factitious Stone (which we call a Snake-stone) and is a Counter∣poyson
to all deadly Bites; if it stick, it attracts the Poyson; and
put it into Milk, it recovers it self again, leaving its virulency there∣in,
discovered by its Greenness: As also by drinking bad Water (to
which, as we to the Air, they attribute all Diseases) when they tra∣vel
over the Sands, and then lying down when they are hot, till the
Earth at Night is in a cold sweat, which penetrating the rarified
Cuticle, fixes the Humours by intercepting their free concourse on
that side, not to be remedied by any <HI>Panacea</HI> of their <HI>Esculapian
Sectators;</HI> it is not much unlike the <HI>Elephantiasis Arabum.</HI></P>
<P>Their Coins are of Gold;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coins Cur∣rent.</NOTE> a St. <HI>Thomas, 10 s.</HI> a <HI>Fanam,</HI> 7 and ½ of
which go to a <HI>Dollar,</HI> or <HI>Petacha:</HI> These are Gold. Of Copper, a

<P>The Country is inticing and beautiful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pepper.</NOTE> Woody in the Plain, up
the Country Mountainous, where grows the Pepper: It is a Berry
that is brought forth by a Bind-weed, wedded to a Tree, which it
hugs as affectionately as the Ivy does the Oak; it is first Green,
when dried it is black, and husked white: Long Pepper grows on a
Shrub leaved and stalked like our Privet.</P>
<P>Their other Trees and Fruits are common with the rest of <HI>India;</HI>
Rice is their chief Grain.</P>
<P>Beasts and Fowls, Tame and Wild, are not scarce.</P>
<P>The first Blackamore Pullen I ever saw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blackamore Pullen.</NOTE> were here; the outward

(though under covert of the <HI>English</HI> House) and an Hellish Consort
of <HI>Jackalls</HI> (a kind of Fox), with the Natives singing and roaring all

was desirous to go Aboard; when, it being Evening, the Sea Breezes
<PB N="54" REF="45"/>
began to drive the Waves with a great surf upon the Shore; insomuch
that our Men could not carry me to the Pinnace, riding at the Grap∣ling
without; wherefore hiring a <HI>Canoo,</HI> the Blacks played the Cha∣ron,
and I narrowly escaped with my Life (being overset); finding
by sad Experience, that Cold Nights affect even in these Hot Coun∣tries,
as sensibly as under the Frozen Bear: Leaving off to wonder at
the Natives quivering and quaking after Sun-set, wrapping them∣selves
in a <HI>Comby,</HI> or Hair-cloath, and the better sort with Quilts,
and making good Fires: For being well drenched in the Sea, the Wind
blowing very high, I was almost nummed to death before I could
reach the Ship. The reason of this Coolness anights is because
the Rains have lately cooled the Air as well as Earth, which also may
be ascribed to the Sun's Ecliptick distance, as well as the length of
the Nights, which are but little longer than the Days; but chiefly
to the soaking Mists bedewing the Earth after Sun-set.</P>

<P>Outstretching the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Left the <HI>Mala∣bar</HI> Coast.</NOTE> we sailed along by <HI>Batticalai</HI>
on the <HI>Canatick</HI> Coasts; and the next Morning, between two Islands
we saw sculking Six <HI>Malabar Proes</HI> waiting their Booty; but making
use of their Oars as well as Sails, soon outstripped us.</P>
<P>The Day after we came to an Anchor at <HI>Onor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Onor</HI> the first Land we touched on the <HI>Canatick</HI> Shore.</NOTE> the Land Hilly and
Barren, which I went to see; it is in 13 <HI>deg. 10 min. North.</HI> We
passed to it through a narrow Bite, which expatiates into a wide
Swallow, and then thrusts us up the River. On the <HI>North</HI> side a
Bow and Arrow Castle overlooks it, while it runs peaceably to the
Town. Where we landed, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had a House, and a new <HI>Junk</HI>
lanched, with her Colours furl'd: One end of the Town stands in
an hole; over a Rocky Hill stands the other part, upon which the Ca∣stle
with its Stone Wall faces an Heath a great way, yet looking
asquint on the Under-woods. It is built after the exact Rules of An∣cient
Fortifications, with a Drawbridge, and a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at round, now a
dry Ditch, the Castle without Soldiers, falling to decay. It was built
by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> seized by the <HI>Canareens</HI> by the help of the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
between whom and the <HI>Portugals,</HI> the Town of poor Buildings is di∣vided:
Many of the Natives have receiv'd the Christian Faith.
Though those that continue in their Paganism are the most impiously
Religious of any of the <HI>Indians,</HI> being too too conversant with the

<P>The <HI>Nairoes</HI> have no footing here, nor have the <HI>Moors</HI> much.</P>
<P>They live in no diffidence of one another, nor Strangers of them,
journeying among them without a Guide, in Broad Roads, not in By-Paths,
as in the Nations properly called the <HI>Malabars:</HI> They have
well-constituted Laws, and observe them obediently.</P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>Mirja</HI> in the same Dominions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Mirja</HI> the Protector of <HI>Canora</HI> came aboard.</NOTE> I went to

of which the Fragments of the Town are shelter'd. At my Land∣ing,
one of their Princes was the first that welcomed me ashore,
(who here as well as in <HI>Italy</HI> scorn not to be Merchants); he was
seated under a shady Tree, on a Carpet spread upon the Sand, and
his Retinue standing about him; he it seems was expecting the Pro∣tector
of <HI>Canara</HI> (the <HI>Raja</HI> being in Minority), who came anon,
with his Lords and Guards, armed with Swords and Gantlets,
Partizans adorned with Bells and Feathers, as also were the Horses
that carried his <HI>Luscarry</HI> or Army, with such Trappings as our finest
Team-Horses in <HI>England</HI> wear.</P>
<P>He ventured off to Sea to see our Ships;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His obstrepo∣rous Musick.</NOTE> he was rowed by a Gang
of 36, in a great deal of Pomp; his Musick was loud, and with the
Kettle-drums made a Noise not unlike that our Coopers make on their
Hogsheads driving home their Hoops: He went aboard two or
three Ships, who entertained him with their Guns and Chears of
their Men, presenting him with Scarlet Cloath. He is a <HI>Gentile,</HI> as
are his Subjects.</P>
<P>Our Lading here was <HI>Pepper,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Lading.</NOTE> <HI>Salt-Petre,</HI> and <HI>Beetle-Nut</HI> for

<P>In our way from <HI>Mirja</HI> we met with a Man of War Pink, commis∣sion'd
from the President for the scowring these Seas, which had 22
Guns, and seventy odd Men, the Name, <HI>The Revenge.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Carwar</HI> is the Island <HI>Angediva,</HI> Fam'd for the Burial of some
Hundreds of our Countreymen.</P>
<P><HI>Carwar</HI> was the Chief Port of <HI>Visiapour</HI> on this Coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carwar</HI> the Chief Port of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> now in the hands of <HI>Seva Gi.</HI></NOTE> but a Grand
Traytor to that King <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> is now Master of it, and the adjacent
Countrey as far as <HI>Guzerat;</HI> having well nigh forced our Factory,
and done other Outrages on us, which would ask our Fleet a longer
time to require Satisfaction, if they were able, than they could stay;
unless they would lose their Passage round the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI>
and content themselves to winter at the <HI>Mauritius,</HI> which all Ships
that outstay their time are forced to. For the Sun being almost at
his <HI>Southern Solstice,</HI> at his return he leaves a sharp Winter (which
we proved), and adverse Winds in those Seas, they lying without
the Tropick, which spurs them on for expedition. What this <HI>Seva
Gi</HI> is, and the reason of his Usurped Power, a longer Duration in the
Countrey must declare, who is every where named with Terror, he
carrying all before him like a mighty Torrent.</P>
<P>The Shore is Hilly, and indifferent Woody; near it Islets are scat∣tered

<P>Hence it is Hilly up to <HI>Guzerat;</HI> though <HI>Gates</HI> hold on where the

cleared up, could hardly vapour betwixt him and the Earth.</P>
<P>At Nights we had hospitable Lights shewed us from the Shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Light-houses.</NOTE> to

<HEAD>BOMBAIM</HEAD>
<P>In <HI>East-India</HI> is one of the Islands of <HI>Salset,</HI> parted from that part
of the <HI>Canarick</HI> Coast which lies nearest <HI>Duccan,</HI> 60 Leagues <HI>North</HI> of
<HI>Goa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Islands of <HI>Sal∣set▪</HI> in number seven.</NOTE> and as many <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Surat.</HI> These Islands are in number seven;
viz <HI>Bombaim, Canorein, Trumbay, Elephanto,</HI> the <HI>Putachoes, Mun∣chumbay,</HI>
and <HI>Kerenjau,</HI> with the Roc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Henry Kenry;</HI> arising as
so many Mountains out of the Sea; which accords to the Fancy of
the Natives, who affirm that <HI>Nereus</HI> has lost these Islets, with a
great deal more of the Low-Lands, from his Trident, the Earth
gaining upon the Sea: And as a Remonstrance of their Credulity,
they bring for proof the vast Rocks that are many Miles up the
Countrey, bestuck with Oyster-shells and other Trophies of the Sea's
<PB N="62" REF="49"/>
having had once Dominion there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter II.</NOTE> all which they call <HI>Conchon,</HI> or
the <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>In whose opening Arm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Situati∣on.</NOTE> that is, from <HI>Choul Point</HI> to <HI>Bacein</HI> (two
famous Cities belonging to the <HI>Portugals</HI>) some 30 Leagues distance,
lye those Spots of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>round, still disputable to which side to incline:
For at Low Water most of them are foordable to the Main, or from
one to the other; and at Spring-Tides again a great part of them
overflowed.</P>
<P><HI>Bombaim</HI> is the first that faces <HI>Choul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bay makes the most commo∣dious Port in <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> and ventures farthest out into
the Sea, making the Mouth of a spacious Bay, from whence it has
its Etymology; <HI>Bombaim,</HI> quasi <HI>Boon Bay.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond it lies <HI>Canorein, Trumbay, Munchumbay,</HI> with their Creeks,
making up the <HI>North</HI> side of the Bay: Between whom and the Main
lies <HI>Elephanto, Kerenjau, Putachoes,</HI> with the great Rock or barren
Islet of <HI>Henry Kenry:</HI> These, with some part of the Main, constitute
the <HI>South-East</HI> side of the Bay; all which together contribute to the
most notable and secure Port on the Coasts of <HI>India;</HI> Ships of the
greatest as well as smaller Burthen having quiet Harbour in it; whi∣ther
if they can, they chuse to betake themselves, if they happen, as
oft they do, to lose their Voyages by the <HI>Monsoons.</HI></P>
<P>From whence these Pieces of Land receive their general Name of
<HI>Salset,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">From whence the Island is called <HI>Bom∣baim.</HI></NOTE> if it be worth Enquiry, I can only guess, either because it
signifies in <HI>Canorein</HI> a Granary, as they are to the <HI>Portugals North</HI> of
<HI>Goa,</HI> and sometimes to <HI>Goa</HI> it self, as at this time, when their <HI>Armado</HI>
of Rice was all lost, which annually used to furnish them with Pro∣visions
of Corn; or else analogically, from the fruitful <HI>Peninsula</HI> of
the same Name, near which <HI>Goa</HI> its self stands: But whether this be
certain or not, the reason of the Denomination of <HI>Bombaim</HI> is con∣vincing.</P>
<P>To go on then from whence we deviated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Import this Island is to the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> it is necessary you should
be first acquainted, That after <HI>Vasquez de Gama,</HI> in the Year 1547,
had laid open these Seas for Traffick to the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> the <HI>Portu∣gals</HI>
to their Honour took for a while sure Footing of what they
had industriously so long laboured for, and brought most of the Bor∣derers
on the Sea-Coasts under their Subjection; not all <HI>India,</HI> as
they have fondly reported. It suffices then, to avoid a Volume of
Discourse, that <HI>Bombaim</HI> with these Islets continued still in their
hands, until the Year 1661, when the Crown of <HI>Portugal</HI> parted
with these, together with the Haven, to His Majesty of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI>
as a Portion of the Dowry of <HI>Donna Infanta Catherina,</HI> Sister
to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and Consort to <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, late
King of <HI>England, Scotland, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> A matter of great
Import to the Kingdom, had it been transferred according to Con∣tract,
as well in regard to the Protection of our Ships, as for the
Profit of the Soil to the <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants; but most of all for
the Awe it might impose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them who are the Disturbers of our
Trade here.</P>
<P>But upon what grounds they refused to surrender,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Portugals</HI> loth to part with it.</NOTE> may be under∣stood,
if we consider the different Interests, as well as Remoteness
of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>East-India.</HI> It is confessed they
will talk big of their King, and how nearly allied to them, as if
they were all Cousin-Germans at least; but for his Commands, if
<PB N="63" REF="49"/>
contrary to their Factions, they value no more than if they were
merely titular; as may appear by what follows. For notwithstand∣ing
the King of <HI>England</HI> sent a Fleet of Five Royal Ships under the
Command of my Lord of <HI>Malbery,</HI> to waft over a Vice-Roy for
them, confirmed so by their own King, and one of their own Na∣tion;
and to take possession of these Islands in the name of the King
of <HI>England;</HI> yet they not only positively denied to surrender, but con∣strained
the Vice-Roy to a negation; otherwise to expect never to
assume that Dignity, which, by that Act they made him sensible, was
more in their disposal than the King's.</P>
<P>Whereupon <HI>Malbery</HI> examining his Commission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> Fleet go to <HI>Swally.</HI></NOTE> was vexed he
was pinched, and knew not how to ease himself; wearied therefore
with Delays, he retreated to <HI>Swally,</HI> and there upon the Sands set
the Souldery on Shore (himself not stirring out of the Ship) Five
hundred stout Men led by Sir <HI>Abraham Shipman,</HI> who was designed
<HI>Generalissimo</HI> for the King of <HI>England</HI> on the <HI>Indian</HI> Shore: Where,
when in Arms, and exercised after the <HI>English</HI> Training, they seem∣ed
formidable to the <HI>Moors;</HI> wherefore they are entreated by the
President for the <HI>English</HI> Factory at <HI>Surat,</HI> Sir <HI>George Oxendine,</HI> that
they would repair Aboard; since the Jealousy of the <HI>Moors</HI> was such,
that unless they did, they vowed the Factory a Sacrifice.</P>
<P>Thus bidding adieu to <HI>Swally,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence to <HI>Angediva.</HI></NOTE> they at length arrived at <HI>Angediva,</HI>
a Barren unhealthy and uninhabited Island, not far from the Main,
and but 12 Leagues to the <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>Where <HI>Malbery</HI> left them to negotiate the Right of his Master;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Portugals</HI> brought to yield up <HI>Bom∣baim.</HI></NOTE> so
much of which at last they were brought to grant, as enforced
them to deliver up <HI>Bombaim,</HI> though they capitulated for that too;
parcelling it out into little Islets, made only by the inundations of
the Sea: But were glad at length when they saw <HI>Malbery</HI> resolute, to
resign the whole Island, with the Bay, into the hands of the <HI>English,</HI>
upon the Conditions first assented to, that the Royalties should be∣long
to the King of <HI>England,</HI> but every particular Man's Estate to
the Right Owner, and the Liberty of their own Ceremonies in Re∣ligion,
upon their Oath of Allegiance.</P>
<P>In the mean while Sir <HI>Abraham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mortality of <HI>English</HI> at <HI>An∣gediva.</HI></NOTE> with near 300 of his best Men,
rested content without any farther Acquests, leaving their Bones at
<HI>Angediva;</HI> poysoned partly by the noisomeness of the Air, the vio∣lence
of the Rains, and the little defence against them; but chiefly
by their own Intemperance.</P>
<P>Mr.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fleet with the re∣maining <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> take pos∣session of the Island.</NOTE> <HI>Cook</HI> being next to Sir <HI>Abraham,</HI> took up his Commission,
who with those Men that were left, was admitted upon <HI>Bombaim</HI> in
the Year 1664. when the Royal Fleet returned.</P>
<P>Where at first landing they found a pretty well Seated, but ill For∣tified
House, four Brass Guns being the whole Defence of the Island;
unless a few Chambers housed in small Towers in convenient
Places to scowre the <HI>Malabars,</HI> who heretofore have been more in∣solent
than of late; adventuring not only to seize their Cattle, but
depopulate whole Villages by their Outrages; either destroying
them by Fire and Sword, or compelling to a worse Fate, Eternal
and intolerable Slavery.</P>
<P>About the House was a delicate Garden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort rais∣ed.</NOTE> voiced to be the plea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antest
in <HI>India,</HI> intended rather for wanton Dalliance, Love's Artil∣lery,
<PB N="64" REF="50"/>
than to make resistance against an invading Foe: For the <HI>Por∣tugals</HI>
generally forgetting their pristine Vertue, Lust, Riot and Ra∣pine,
the ensuing Consequences of a long undisturbed Peace where
Wealth abounds, are the only Remarkable Reliques of their Ancient
worth; their Courages being so much effeminated, that it is a won∣der
to most how they keep any thing; if it were not that they have
lived among mean spirited Neighbours. But to return to this Gar∣den
of <HI>Eden,</HI> or Place of Terrestrial Happiness, it would put the
Searchers upon as hard an Inquest, as the other has done its Poste∣rity:
The Walks which before were covered with Nature's verdent
awning, and lightly pressed by soft Delights, are now open to the
Sun, and loaded with the hardy Cannon: The Bowers dedicated to
Rest and Ease, are turned into bold Rampires for the watchful Cen∣tinel
to look out on; every Tree that the Airy Choristers made their
Charming Choir, trembles, and is extirpated at the rebounding Ec∣cho
of the alarming Drum; and those slender Fences only designed
to oppose the <HI>Sylvian</HI> Herd, are thrown down to erect others of a
more War-like Force. But all this not in one day.</P>
<P>It was sufficient at first for the <HI>English</HI> to make preparations for a
growing Strength, though at present such as might offend as well
as defend.</P>
<P>Whilst things were in this posture upon some Male-administration
of his Office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Governour sent out by the King.</NOTE> <HI>Cook</HI> was outed, and Sir <HI>Gervis Lucas</HI> was sent over by
the King; who, had he lived, would have made the <HI>Portugals</HI> perform
their Compact, seizing from them the <HI>Putachos,</HI> who to stop his
Mouth, were willing to comply for the Customs of <HI>Trumbay.</HI></P>
<P>Upon his decease Captain <HI>Gary</HI> was impowered by the King;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Govern∣ment trans∣ferred to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company.</NOTE> who
began to act as Vice-Roy, carrying his Chair of State about with
him; but his Majesty finding it expensive to bear out this Man's
Pride, and in the casting up Accounts, not available to him, only to
the Commanders of his Majesty's Ships, who by their own Adven∣tures
made good Improvements; and the <HI>East-India</HI> Company there∣by
began to be sensible that their Trade would be impaired in the
vending their Commodities at home, and their Ships in <HI>India</HI> little
bettered by the King's Port in <HI>India;</HI> and above all, they being lia∣ble
to be Sufferers for the Hostilities committed by his Maje∣sty's
Officers on the <HI>Indians</HI> (who understand no distinction between
King and Company) they as freely supplicated for, what his Majesty
was as willing to grant, the Island: They holding it, from that time,
of his Majesty about four years after the King had possessed it, they
defraying all Charges.</P>
<P>In this Exigency on either side, the Martial as well as Civil Af∣fairs,
are wholly devolved on the Merchants; and now how they
will manage the Sword as well as the Quill, concernes them.</P>
<P>The Old Soldiers are constrained to submit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Old Sol∣diers stomach the Yoke of the Compa∣ny's Servants.</NOTE> or disband, which
makes them stomach a hard Service under harder Masters: For be∣sides
that natural Antipathy betwixt the Subtilty of the one, and Ge∣nerosity
of the other; the stupendious elevation of their Servants
on this new acquired Power thrown into their hands, Men, most
of them of no Experience or Education, coming young hither, but
what they learn from a Luxurious and Griping People, whose Go∣vernment
quadrates not with a <HI>British</HI> Militia: It will not be easy to
<PB N="65" REF="50"/>
conceive, as well from the incoherence of Dispositions, as the Lordly
Government of a Servant, what Grudges or Miscarriages may be
produced? For where the Soldiers and Generals have different Inte∣rests,
and mutual Obligation is interrupted, the course of things
must necessarily run-counter: Moreover, where they should be most
eminent in Dangers and Assaults, and lead them on to bold Enter∣prizes;
yet if a tenderness to Self-preservation step in between the
Publick Honour and Safety, (as it always does, where that bane to
Noble Actions, Covetousness, is concomitant) and which is almost
essential to a Merchant, a fear of being laught at for venturing too
far; the Case is desperate. For Instance, Our Ten Ships, most of
them hired by Merchants, and the Commanders some of them (not
to say all, for there were of them as worthy Men as any in the World)
Principal Owners, were more willing to shift for themselves, than
to hazard a stout and unanimous Resistance: Which had they main∣tained
boldly, as they imprudently gave the first Onset (by the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>
own confession) they had gained a Victory never to be su∣stained
by them, nor for our Fleet sufficiently to have been recom∣pensed;
whereas for want of wise Conduct, and a joint Defence, they
impressed on themselves and Nation a Blur never to be wiped off.
Yet such, by the Constitution of the Company it self, is the present
Misfortune, that instant Gain is preferred before Glory or a future emo∣lument;
which is the reason, why they are less solicitous for setling
by Power, what they must ever be forced to beg, a Trade; and com∣ply
with Injuries, than command a Submission, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> do: But
here also being left Tenants at will, they think it enough to leave Bu∣siness
in no worse plight than they found it.</P>
<P>And here might be considered, Whether it were not more for the
Publick Welfare, should His Majesty be pleased to make it a Royal
Company, or a National Concern, as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> is; than to
let it be at the will of the Company under the forementioned Cir∣cumstances
to impose Governours on the Island.</P>
<P>The first of which was Sir <HI>George Oxendine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Governours for the Com∣pany.</NOTE> who being President,
and therefore more immediatly requisite for him to reside at <HI>Surat,</HI>
ordered Mr. <HI>Goodyeer,</HI> his Deputy, to govern <HI>Bombaim;</HI> but Sir <HI>George</HI>
not long after finishing his days, together with his Presidency at <HI>Su∣rat,
Goodyeer</HI> hastens thither in hopes to succeed, when gaping for that
which included this, he is excluded of both: Upon which account
there happened an <HI>Interregnum</HI> at <HI>Bombaim;</HI> whereby this Body Po∣litick
grew up into an Anarchy, and set upon its weak Limbs a <HI>Quin∣tuple</HI>
Head, called Commissioners, who were as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI>
Mr. <HI>James Adams,</HI> Chairman, (outed in two days) Mr. <HI>Sterling,</HI>
a <HI>Scotch</HI> Minister, Mr. <HI>Cotes,</HI> Captain <HI>Burgess,</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Houghton;</HI>
who upon the just and happy choice of the Honourable <HI>Gerald Aun∣gier,</HI>
were dissolved; and Mr. <HI>Matthew Grey</HI> nominated Deputy, till
the Company sent out Captain <HI>Young,</HI> who had it not long before
Mr. <HI>Philip Gyfford</HI> was put in; who deserves to be remembred for
his great care in raising the Bastions, and in a manner finishing,
what always was still but beginning by the rest. He ruled three Years,
when the Company thinking their Work to go on too fast, gave the
Charge of Deputy-Governour to Captain <HI>Shaxton,</HI> and an handsome
Recruit of Soldiers; which revived the not yet extinguished Fewd be∣tween
<PB N="66" REF="51"/>
the Merchants and the Soldiers: Whereupon <HI>Shaxton</HI> was kept
from it a full year; and in that Interim, the President distasted at
the Insolencies of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Governour at <HI>Surat,</HI> and fearing a se∣cond
Confusion of Government at <HI>Bombaim,</HI> together foreseeing
Clouds gathering from the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> not minding so much those
of the Season (the <HI>Mussoons</HI> being about to enter) insomuch, that
narrowly escaping a Dangerous Voyage, he came and took the Go∣vernment
himself in the Year 1671. where these three Years he has
regulated Affairs with that Prudence, that whereas he found a Dis∣affected
and Incongruous Council, he has now knit them into a Bond
of at least seeming Friendship; and does daily study to advance the
Company's Interest, and the good and safety of the People under
him.</P>
<P>To this the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are witness;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength of the Island.</NOTE> for the Spring before our
Fleet arrived (the same Fleet that we unfortunately engaged) the
<HI>Dutch</HI> attempting to surprize the Islanders, found them and the
Fort in so good a Condition, that they were glad to betake them∣selves
to their Boats without any Booty, and the next day hoisted
Sails (for, said they, <HI>Bombaim</HI> been as stark as de Deel) and not
without good reason; for within the Fort were mounted 120 Pieces
of Ordnance, and in other convenient Stands 20 more, besides 60
Field-pieces ready in their Carriages upon occasion to attend the <HI>Mi∣litia</HI>
and <HI>Bandarines.</HI> To the Fort then belonged 300 <HI>English,</HI> and
400 <HI>Topazes,</HI> or <HI>Portugal</HI> Firemen: To the <HI>Militia</HI> out of <HI>Portugal</HI>
musters 500 under <HI>English</HI> Leaders, all well armed: Of <HI>Bandarines</HI>
(that lookt after the Woods of Cocoes) with Clubs and other Wea∣pons,
300. Besides some Thousands more would make a Shew, but
not to be relied on, should it come to the push. Moreover in the
Road were riding Three Men of War, the best of 30 Guns.</P>
<P>Thus were they provided at our Arrival;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort ill contrived.</NOTE> nor were their Forces
lessened by our coming. Since which a Trench out of the hard Rock
the Fort is founded on, is digging to Moat it with the Sea: And they
are devising Horn-works for its better security; a thing, to speak
truly, of greater undertaking and expence than ever to endure ac∣complishing
by the Company; and without it, it will prove a thing
of ill contrivance, it being straitned for room to receive a sufficient
number of Defendants, and worse supplied with Water for Store, or
Granaries for Provision for a Siege. The first Modellers were to
blame in not enlarging it to a Tank that stands without the Parade,
which they might have done with almost the same Charges.</P>
<P>From whence let us walk the Rounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town.</NOTE> At distance enough lies the
Town, in which confusedly live the <HI>English, Portugueze, Topazes,
Gentues, Moors, Cooly</HI> Christians, most Fishermen.</P>
<P>It is a full Mile in length, the Houses are low, and Thatched with
Oleas of the Cocoe-Trees, all but a few the <HI>Portugals</HI> left, and some
few the Company have built, the Custom-house and Ware∣houses
are Tiled or Plastered, and instead of Glass, use Panes of
Oister-shells for their Windows (which as they are cut in Squares,
and polished, look gracefully enough.) There is also a reasonable
handsome <HI>Buzzar.</HI></P>
<P>At the end of the Town looking into the Field, where Cows and
<HI>Buffoloes</HI> graze, the <HI>Portugals</HI> have a pretty House and Church, with
<PB N="67" REF="51"/>
Orchards of <HI>Indian</HI> Fruit adjoining. The <HI>English</HI> have only a Bu∣rying-Place,
called <HI>Mendam's-Point,</HI> from the first Man's Name there
interr'd, where are some few Tombs that make a pretty Shew at en∣tring
the Haven; but neither Church or Hospital, both which are
mightily to be desired.</P>
<P>There are no Fresh Water Rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fresh Water-springs scarce.</NOTE> or falling Streams of living Wa∣ter:
The Water drank is usually Rain-water preserved in Tanks,
which decaying, they are forced to dig Wells, into which it is strain∣ed,
hardly leaving its brackish Taste; so that the better sort have it
brought from <HI>Massegoung,</HI> where is only one fresh Spring.</P>
<P>On the backside of the Towns of <HI>Bombaim</HI> and <HI>Maijm,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Woods of <HI>Co∣coes.</HI></NOTE> are Woods
of <HI>Cocoes</HI> (under which inhabit the <HI>Banderines,</HI> those that prune
and cultivate them), these Hortoes being the greatest Purchase and
Estates on the Island, for some Miles together, till the Sea break in
between them: Overagainst which, up the Bay a Mile, lies <HI>Masse∣goung,</HI>
a great Fishing-Town, peculiarly notable for a Fish called
<HI>Bumbelo,</HI> the Sustenance of the Poorer sort, who live on them and
<HI>Batty,</HI> a course sort of Rice, and the Wine of the <HI>Cocoe,</HI> called <HI>Toddy.</HI>
The Ground between this and the great Breach is well ploughed, and
bears good <HI>Batty.</HI> Here the <HI>Portugals</HI> have another Church and Re∣ligious
House belonging to the <HI>Franciscans.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond it is <HI>Parell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Portugal</HI> Churches.</NOTE> where they have another Church, and De∣mesnes
belonging to the Jesuits; to which appertains <HI>Siam,</HI> manured
by <HI>Columbeens,</HI> Husbandmen, where live the <HI>Frasses,</HI> or Porters also;
each of which Tribes have a <HI>Mandadore,</HI> or Superintendent, who
give an account of them to the <HI>English,</HI> and being born under the
same degree of Slavery, are generally more Tyrannical than a Stran∣ger
would be towards them; so that there needs no other Task∣master
than one of their own Tribe, to keep them in awe by a rigid
Subjection.</P>
<P>Under these Uplands the Washes of the Sea produce a Lunary
Tribute of Salt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt-Pans.</NOTE> left in Pans or Pits made on purpose at Spring-Tides
for the overflowing; and when they are full, are incrustated by the
heat of the Sun. In the middle, between <HI>Parell, Maijm, Sciam,</HI>
and <HI>Bombaim,</HI> is an Hollow, wherein is received a Breach running
at three several places, which drowns 40000 Acres of good Land,
yielding nothing else but Samphire; athwart which, from <HI>Parell</HI> to
<HI>Maijm,</HI> are the Ruins of a Stone Cawsey made by Pennances.</P>
<P>At <HI>Maijm</HI> the <HI>Portugals</HI> have another compleat Church and
House;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maijm.</NOTE> the <HI>English</HI> a pretty Custom-house and Guard-house: The
<HI>Moors</HI> also a Tomb in great Veneration for a <HI>Peor,</HI> or Prophet, in∣strumental
to the quenching the Flames approaching their Prophet's
Tomb at <HI>Mecha</HI> (though he was here at the same time) by the
Fervency of his Prayers.</P>
<P>At <HI>Salvesong,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salvesong.</NOTE> the farthest part of this Inlet, the <HI>Franciscans</HI> enjoy
another Church and Convent; this side is all covered with Trees of
<HI>Cocoes▪ Jawks,</HI> and <HI>Mangoes;</HI> in the middle lies <HI>Verulee,</HI> where the
<HI>English</HI> have a Watch.</P>
<P>On the other side of the great Inlet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malabar-hill.</NOTE> to the Sea, is a great Point
abutting against <HI>Old Woman's</HI> Island, and is called <HI>Malabar-hill,</HI> a
Rocky, Woody Mountain, yet sends forth long Grass. A-top of all
is a <HI>Parsy</HI> Tomb lately reared; on its Declivity towards the Sea, the
<PB N="68" REF="52"/>
Remains of a stupendious Pagod, near a Tank of Fresh Water,
which the <HI>Malabars</HI> visited it mostly for.</P>
<P>Thus have we compleated our Rounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigness of the Island.</NOTE> being in the Circum∣ference
Twenty Miles, the Length Eight, taking in <HI>Old Woman's</HI>
Island, which is a little low barren Island, of no other Profit, but to
keep the Company's Antelopes, and other Beasts of Delight.</P>
<P>The People that live here are a Mixture of most of the Neigh∣bouring
Countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A mixt People.</NOTE> most of them Fugitives and Vagabonds, no ac∣count
being here taken of them: Others perhaps invited hither
(and of them a great number) by the Liberty granted them in
their several Religions; which here are solemnized with Variety of
Popperies (a Toleration consistent enough with the Rules of Gain),
though both <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> despise us for it; here licensed out
of Policy, as the old <HI>Numidians</HI> to build up the greatest Empire in
the World. Of these, one among another, may be reckoned 60000
Souls; more by 50000 than the <HI>Portugals</HI> ever could. For which
Number this Island is not able to find Provisions, it being most of it
a Rock above Water, and of that which is overflowed, little hopes to
recover it. However, it is well supplied from abroad both with
Corn and Meat at reasonable Rates; and there is more Flesh killed
for the <HI>English</HI> alone here in one Month, than in <HI>Surat</HI> for a Year
for all the <HI>Moors</HI> in that Populous City.</P>
<P>The Government here now is <HI>English;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>English</HI> Go∣vernment.</NOTE> the Soldiers have Martial
Law: The Freemen, Common; the chief Arbitrator whereof is
the President, with his Council at <HI>Surat;</HI> under him is a Justiciary,
and Court of Pleas, with a Committee for Regulation of Affairs,
and presenting all Complaints.</P>
<P>The President has a large Commission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Power and State of the President.</NOTE> and is <HI>Vice-Regis;</HI> he has
a Council here also, and a Guard when he walks or rides abroad, ac∣companied
with a Party of Horse, which are constantly kept in the
Stables, either for Pleasure or Service. He has his Chaplains, Phy∣sician,
Chyrurgeons, and Domesticks; his Linguist, and Mint-Master:
At Meals he has his Trumpets usher in his Courses, and
Soft Musick at the Table: If he move out of his Chamber, the Sil∣ver
Staves wait on him; if down Stairs, the Guard receive him; if
he go abroad, the <HI>Bandarines</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> under two Standards march
before him: He goes sometimes in his Coach, drawn by large Milk-White
Oxen, sometimes on Horseback, other times in <HI>Palenkeens,</HI>
carried by <HI>Cohors, Musslemen</HI> Porters: Always having a <HI>Sumbrero</HI> of
State carried over him: And those of the <HI>English</HI> inferior to him,
have a suitable Train.</P>
<P>But for all this Gallantry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An unhealthy Climate.</NOTE> I reckon they walk but in Charnel∣houses,
the Climate being extremely Unhealthy; at first thought
to be caused by <HI>Bubsho,</HI> rotten Fish; but though that be prohibited,
yet it continues as Mortal: I rather impute it to the Situation,
which causes an Infecundity in the Earth, and a Putridness in the
Air, what being produced seldom coming to Maturity, whereby
what is eaten is undigested; whence follows Fluxes, Dropsy, Scur∣vy,
Barbiers (which is an enervating the whole Body, being nei∣ther
able to use Hands or Feet) Gout, Stone, Malignant and Putrid
Fevers, which are Endemial Diseases: Among the worst of these,
<HI>Fool Rack</HI> (Brandy made of <HI>Blubber,</HI> or <HI>Carvil,</HI> by the <HI>Portugals,</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="52"/>
because it swims always in a Blubber, as if nothing else were in it;
but touch it, and it stings like Nettles; the latter, because sailing on
the Waves it bears up like a <HI>Portugal Carvil:</HI> It is, being taken, a
Gelly, and distilled causes those that take it to be Fools), and Foul
Women may be reckoned.</P>
<P>To prevent the latter of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>English</HI> Wo∣men no good Nurses.</NOTE> and to propagate their Colony,
the Company have sent out <HI>English</HI> Women; but they beget a sickly
Generation; and as the <HI>Dutch</HI> well observe, those thrive better that
come of an <HI>European</HI> Father and <HI>Indian</HI> Mother: Which (not to re∣flect
on what Creatures are sent abroad) may be attributed to their
living at large, not debarring themselves Wine and Strong Drink,
which immoderately used, inflames the Blood, and spoils the Milk
in these Hot Countries, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> long ago declared. The Natives
abhor all heady Liquors, for which reason they prove better Nurses.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this Mortality to the <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air a∣greeable to the Country Peo∣ple.</NOTE> the Country Peo∣ple
and naturalized <HI>Portugals</HI> live to a good Old Age, supposed to be
the Reward of their Temperance; indulging themselves neither in
Strong Drinks, nor devouring Flesh as we do. But I believe rather
we are here, as Exotick Plants brought home to us, not agreeable to
the Soil: For to the Lustier and Fresher, and oftentimes the Tem∣peratest,
the Clime more unkind; but to Old Men and Women it
seems to be more suitable.</P>
<P>Happy certainly then are those,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Few return home.</NOTE> and only those, brought hither
in their Nonage, before they have a Gust of our <HI>Albion;</HI> or next to
them, such as intoxicate themselves with <HI>Laethe,</HI> and remember not
their former Condition: When it is expostulated, Is this the Reward
of an harsh and severe Pupilage? Is this the <HI>Elysium</HI> after a tedious
Waftage? For this, will any thirst, will any contend, will any for∣sake
the Pleasures of his Native Soil, in his Vigorous Age, to bury
himself alive here? Were it not more charitable at the first Bubbles
of his Infant-Sorrows, to make the next Stream over-swell him? Or
else if he must be full grown for Misery, how much more compassio∣nate
were it to expose him to an open Combat with the fiercest Duel∣lists
in Nature, to spend at once his Spirits, than to wait a piece∣meal'd
Consumption? Yet this abroad and unknown, is the ready
Choice of those to whom Poverty threatens Contempt at home:
What else could urge this wretched Remedy? For these are untrodden
Paths for Knowledge, little Improvement being to be expected from
Barbarity. Custom and Tradition are only Venerable here; and it
is Heresy to be wiser than their Forefathers; which Opinion is both
bred and hatch'd by an innate Sloth; so that though we seem near∣er
the Heavens, yet Bodies here are more Earthy, and the Mind
wants that active Fire that always mounts, as if it were extinguish'd
by its <HI>Antiparistasis:</HI> Whereby Society and Communication, the
Characteristick of Man is wholly lost. What then is to be expected
here, where sordid Thrift is the only Science? After which, not∣withstanding
there is so general an Inquest, few there be acquire it:
For in Five hundred, One hundred survive not; of that One hun∣dred,
one Quarter get not Estates; of those that do, it has not been
recorded above One in Ten Years has seen his Country: And in this
difficulty it would hardly be worth a Sober Man's while, much less
an Ingenuous Man's, who should not defile his purer Thoughts, to
<PB N="70" REF="53"/>
be wholly taken up with such mean (not to say indirect) Contem∣plations;
however, a necessary Adjunct, <HI>Wealth,</HI> may prove to buoy
him up on the Surface of Repute, lest the Vulgar serve him as <HI>Aesop</HI>'s
Frogs did their first rever'd Deity.</P>
<P>Thus much being premised for what concerns the Island its self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Credit it bears with its Neigh∣bours.</NOTE> it
remains to speak of it with relation to the Credit it bears among its
Neighbours: The <HI>Dutch</HI> cast an envious Eye on it, and were it in
their hands, would doubtless make it render all it is capable; and in
respect of Commerce it seems to offer many Conveniences; the <HI>Ba∣nyans</HI>
liking it better than <HI>Surat,</HI> living freer, and under milder Taxa∣tions,
which they put the present President in some hopes of com∣plying
with, could he open the way from hence up the Country:
but that depending on so many Intricacies, must be not only a work
of Time, but Power to bring to pass; as afterwards may fall more
properly in our way to make appear.</P>
<P>Our present Concern then is with the <HI>Portugal, Seva Gi,</HI> and the <HI>Mo∣gul:</HI>
From the first is desired no more than a mutual Friendship; from
the second, an Appearance only; from the last, a nearer Commerce:
The first and second become necessary for Provisions for the Belly,
and Building; the third for the Gross of our Trade: Wherefore
Offices of Civility must be performed to each of these; but they
sometimes interfering, are the occasion of Jealousies; these three
being so diametrically opposite one to another: For while the <HI>Mogul</HI>
brings his Fleet either to Winter or Recruit in this Bay, <HI>Seva</HI> takes
Offence; on the other hand, the <HI>Mogul</HI> would soon put a stop to all
Business, should he be denied: The <HI>Portugal,</HI> as in League with nei∣ther,
thinks it a mean compliance in us to allow either of them Coun∣tenance,
especially to furnish them with Guns and Weapons to turn
upon Christians, which they wisely make an Inquisition Crime.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Is a Survey of the Island of Canorein near Bombaim.</HEAD>
<P>UPON these scores it was not long before I was employed to
wait on the Father Superior of the <HI>North,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Superior of the Jesuits,</NOTE> a Learned Man,
and a <HI>Spaniard</HI> by Nation, of the Order of the Jesuits.</P>
<P>The President commanded his own <HI>Baloon</HI> (a Barge of State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compliment∣ed.</NOTE> of
Two and twenty Oars) to attend me and one of the Council, to
compliment the Father on the Island of <HI>Canorein,</HI> parted from <HI>Bom∣baim</HI>
by a Stream half a Mile broad: Near our Landing-place stood
a College, not inferior to the Building, nor much unlike those of our
Universities, belonging to the Jesuits here, more commonly called
<HI>Paulistines</HI> (whose Visitor was now my Patient), who live here ve∣ry
sumptuously, the greatest part of the Island being theirs. Our
Entertainment was truly Noble, and becoming the Gravity of the
Society. After I had done my Duty, the Fathers accompanied us
to the Barge; afore the College-Gate stood a large Cross, thwack'd
full of young Blacks singing Vespers: The Town is large, the Houses
tiled; it is called <HI>Bandora.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="53"/>
At our department they gave us Seven Guns, which they have
planted on the Front of their College for their own Defence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Con∣vents serve for Castles.</NOTE> besides
they are fitted with good store of Small Arms: Following therein
the Advice given by a Statesman to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> about the
<HI>Netherlands;</HI> That <HI>if the Society of the</HI> Loyolists <HI>were multiplied,
their Convents might serve for Castles.</HI></P>
<P>In the middle of the River we had a pleasant Prospect on both
sides;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fine Pro∣spect on the Water.</NOTE> on <HI>Bandora</HI> side, the College, the Town, the Church of
St. <HI>Andrew</HI> a Mile beyond, and upon the Hill that pointed to the
Sea, the <HI>Aquada,</HI> Blockhouse, and a Church; on the other side, the
Church of <HI>Maijm,</HI> with other handsome Buildings.</P>
<P>Curiosity led me a second time to visit the Island <HI>Canorein,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Journey of Pleasure: And Civility of the Jesuits.</NOTE> having
obtained leave for a longer Stay; nor went I alone, some of the best
Quality on the Island being led by the same desire, joining themselves
with me: We carried a Train of Servants, Horses, and <HI>Palenkeens,</HI>
which were ferried over before us; and we coming soon after, were
met by the Fraternity, and conducted to the Fathers, who detained
us till Afternoon by a stately Banquet, shewing us the Civility of the
Church and College, diverting us both with Instrumental and Vocal
Musick, and very good Wine.</P>
<P>After which we were dismiss'd, and four Mile off <HI>Bandora</HI> were
stopp'd by the Kindness of the <HI>Padre</HI>-Superior, whose Mandate
whereever we came caused them to send his <HI>Recarders</HI> (a Term of
Congratulation, as we say, <HI>Our Service</HI>) with the Presents of the
best Fruits and Wines, and whatever we wanted.</P>
<P>Here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delightful <HI>Aldeas.</HI></NOTE> not adjoining to any Town, in a sweet Air, stood a Magni∣ficent
Rural Church; in the way to which, and indeed all up and
down this Island, are pleasant <HI>Aldeas,</HI> or Country Seats of the
Gentry; where they live like Petty Monarchs, all that is born on
the Ground being theirs, holding them in a perfect state of Villainage,
they being Lords Paramount.</P>
<P>From hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Magatana,</HI> a Country Seat.</NOTE> when we had baited, the same Night we travelled
easily to <HI>Magatana,</HI> using our Fowling-Pieces all the way, being
here presented with Rich Game, as Peacocks, Doves, and Pigeons,
<HI>Chitrels,</HI> or Spotted Deer.</P>
<P>When we came to the Town, two several Churches strove to re∣ceive
us; but having some Acquaintance with the Father of the one,
and not with the other, we excused our selves to the latter, and took
up with our Friend. As soon as we came in, the Servitors fetch'd us
warm Water to wash our Feet, which was very refreshing; it put
me in mind of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Courtesy to the Angels. After this, as a piece
of extraordinary Civility, they shewed us the Necessary House; and
it is so in a Countrey where Fluxes are so common; and for that rea∣son
it is kept as neat as their Lodging Rooms, having Water to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
after you have used a clean Towel hung there for that purpose.</P>
<P>This Night we fared very well. Next Morn before Break of Day
we directed our Steps to the anciently fam'd, but now ruin'd City
of <HI>Canorein;</HI> the way to it is so delightsome, I thought I had been
in <HI>England;</HI> sine Arable, Pasture, and Coppices; thus we passed Five
Mile to the Foor of the Hill on which the City stands, and had
passed half a Mile through a thick Wood, peopled by Apes, Tygers,
wild Buffolo's, and Jackalls; here were some Flocks of Parockets:
<PB N="72" REF="54"/>
When we alighted, the Sun began to mount the <HI>Horizon</HI> over the
Hills, and under our Feet, as if he had newly bathed his fiery Cour∣sers,
there appeared the Mouth of a <HI>Tank,</HI> or Aqueduct, out of a
Rock, whose steaming Breath was very hot, but water cold: From
hence it is thought the whole City to be supplied with water; for as
we ascend, we find such Places, where convenient, filled with Lim∣pid
Water, not over-matched in <HI>India:</HI> If it be so, (as I know not
how to contradict it) that it should have its Current upwards
through the hard Rocks artificially cut, the World cannot parallel
so wonderful a Water-course!</P>
<P>From hence the Passage is uneasy and inaccessible for more than
two abreast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Canorein,</HI> for∣merly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Hea∣then <HI>Fane.</HI></NOTE> till we come to the City, all cut out of a Rock; where
is presented <HI>Vulcan</HI>'s Forge, supported by two mighty Colosses, bel∣lied
in the middle with two Globes. Next a Temple with a beauti∣ful
Frontispiece not unlike the <HI>Portuco</HI> of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>West Gate:</HI> With∣in
the Porch on each side stand Two Monstrous Giants, where two
Lesser and one Great Gate give a noble Entrance; it can receive no
Light but at the Doors and Windows of the Porch, whereby it looks
more solemnly; the Roof is Arched, seeming to be born up by
huge Pillars of the same Rock, some Round, some Square, 34 in
number. The <HI>Cornish</HI> Work of Elephants, Horses, Lions; at the
upper end it rounds like a Bow; near where stands a great Offertory
somewhat Oval, the Body of it without Pillars, they only making a
narrow Piatzo about, leaving the Nave open: It may be an 100
Feet in Length, in Height 60 Feet or more.</P>
<P>Beyond this, by the same Mole-like Industry, was worked out a
Court of Judicature (as those going to shew it will needs give Names)
or Place of Audience, 50 Feet square, all bestuck with Imagery,
well Engraven according to old Sculpture. On the Side, over against
the Door, sate one Superintendent, to whom the <HI>Brachmin</HI> went with
us, paid great Reverence, not speaking of him without a token of
worship; whom he called <HI>Jougy,</HI> or the Holy Man; under this the
way being made into handsome Marble Steps, are the King's Stables,
not different from the Fashion of our Noblemens Stables, only at the
head of every Stall seems to be a <HI>Dormitory,</HI> or Place for Devotion,
with Images, which gave occasion to doubt if ever for that End; or
rather made for an Heathen Seminary of Devotes, and these their
Cells or Chappels, and the open Place their Common Hall or School:
More aloft stood the King's Palace, large, stately and magnificent,
surrounded with lesser of the Nobility.</P>
<P>To see all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reported to be dug out of the Rocks by <HI>Alexander.</HI></NOTE> would require a Month's time; but that we might see
as much as could be in our allotted time, we got upon the highest
part of the Mountain, where we feasted our Eyes with innumerable
Entrances of these Cony-burrows, but could not see one quarter
part. Whose Labour this should be, or for what purpose, is out of
memory; but this Place by the <HI>Gentiles</HI> is much adored: Some con∣tend
for <HI>Alexander;</HI> and as a proof, think they have said enough,
when it is received by Tradition, that a great Gap out of a solid
Rock was cut by him to make this an Island: But this is contradi∣ctory
to the Story delivered of <HI>Alexander,</HI> That he sailed up <HI>Indus,</HI>
and encountred King <HI>Porus,</HI> of whom some little Remains may be
collected, they speaking of that King by the Name of <HI>Por</HI> in <HI>Cam∣baia,</HI>

where <HI>Alexander</HI> landed with his Army;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. III.</NOTE> and followed the
Course of <HI>Indus,</HI> directly contrary to this Place, that lying <HI>North-East,</HI>
this <HI>South</HI> from thence; nor do we read his stay in <HI>India</HI> was
so long, to atchieve such Acts as these, this Place being not the only
Instance of this nature; but more probable to be an Heathen <HI>Fane,</HI>
or Idolatrous Pagod, from the Superstitious Opinion they still hold
of its Sacredness: Wherefore the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who are now Masters
of it, strive to erace the remainders of this <HI>Herculean</HI> Work, that it
may sink into the oblivion of its Founders.</P>
<P>Returning to <HI>Magatana,</HI> we spent some days in riding about the
Country, which we found every-where provided with Churches.</P>
<P>The Chief City of this Island is <HI>Tanaw:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tanaw</HI> the Chief Place.</NOTE> In which are Seven

<P><PB N="75" REF="55"/>
The Land about it plain, and fruitful of Sugar-Canes, Rice, and
other Grain; a great part of which has lately been destroyed by the

<HI>Fidalgos</HI> Prisoners, together with their Wives and Families, butcher∣ing
the <HI>Padres,</HI> and robbing the Churches without resistance, con∣ceived
on a deadly Feud, partly out of revenge of the <HI>Portugal</HI>
Cruelties at <HI>Muschat;</HI> but chiefly out of detestation of each
other's Religion; insomuch that Quarter is denied on either
side: But that on this Pretence. The <HI>Portugals</HI> striving to pos∣sess
themselves of <HI>Muschat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ground of their Quar∣rels.</NOTE> were put to such stress, that had
not their <HI>Armado</HI> come to their relief, they must have desisted
their Enterprize: Upon the arrival whereof the new Recruits
gained so much on the <HI>Arab</HI> Governour, that he yielded up
the otherwise invincible Fort of <HI>Muschat;</HI> where the <HI>Portugals</HI>
acting all nefarious Outrages, contrary to their Promise, the <HI>Arabs</HI>
re-armed themselves with Courage and fresh Succors, and at length
beat them from hence to <HI>Ormus</HI> in the Gulf of <HI>Persia;</HI> from whence
also they were routed by the help of the <HI>English</HI> (we then being at
war with them); the first blow to their Greatness in these

are at the charge of a lusty Squadron in these Seas, which were those
we met on the Coast returning from thence; who were no sooner
gone, than the <HI>Arabs</HI> sent their Fleet to do this Mischief here; which
now 'tis done, they are again in quest of them, but they fly as of∣ten
as these pursue.</P>
<P>And if such be the gasping Strength of the <HI>Portugals,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their last Ef∣forts.</NOTE> to terrify the
Potentest Enemies to Christianity in these Parts, what was their flou∣rishing
Estate? Whence it may easily be supposed before now all had
bowed to the Cross, which yet bend under Heathenism or <HI>Mahome∣tism,</HI>
had they not been prevented by unhappy Pretenders, that (I
fear) too much preferred Merchandize and private Pieques, before
the welfare of Religion: For it is morally probable, that had not the

these parts of the World.</P>
<P>Having in a Week's time compleated my Business,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eliphanto,</HI> ano∣ther Idola∣trous Temple cut out of a solid Rock.</NOTE> returning the

the Effigies of an Horse stuck up to the Belly in the Earth in the Val∣ley;
from thence we clambred up the highest Mountain on the Island,
on whose Summit was a miraculous Piece hewed out of solid Stone:
It is supported with Forty two <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars, being a Square,
open on all sides but towards the <HI>East;</HI> where stands a Statue with
three Heads, crowned with strange Hieroglyphicks: At the <HI>North</HI>
side in an high <HI>Portuco</HI> stands an Altar, guarded by Giants, and im∣mured
by a Square Wall; all along, the Walls are loaded with huge
Giants, some with eight hands, making their vanquished Knights stoop
for mercy. Before this is a <HI>Tank</HI> full of water, and beyond that ano∣ther
Place with Images. This seems to be of later date than that of
<HI>Canorein,</HI> though defaced by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who have this Island also;
<PB N="76" REF="56"/>
but no Defence upon it, nor any thing else of Note; it may be Ten
Miles round, inhabited by the <HI>Povo,</HI> or Poor: From hence we sailed
to the <HI>Putachoes,</HI> a Garden of Melons (<HI>Putacho</HI> being a Melon)
were there not wild Rats that hinder their Growth, and so to <HI>Bom∣baim.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather now was grown excessive hot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heats.</NOTE> the Earth beginning

their first shew at the first Full Moon in <HI>May,</HI> and continue a Fort∣night,
in which space it is unhealthy; till after a Fortnight's fair

<HI>Seva Gi</HI> possessed of his Country, and bidding for his strong Castle
at <HI>Dan de Rajapour</HI> Bay, which he has been to defend this Summer,
derides his Attempts, and is preparing to be install'd <HI>Mau Raja,</HI> or

<P>In the mean while Nature affords us a pleasant Spectacle for this
Season,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ingenui∣ty of the <HI>Toddy</HI> Bird.</NOTE> as well as Matter for Admiration; whereby I know not why
we should deny Reason wholly to Animals; unless it be, Man ha∣ving
so much, they seem comparatively to have none: For here is a
Bird (having its Name from the Tree it chuses for its Sanctuary,
the <HI>Toddy-Tree</HI>) that is not only exquisitely curious in the artificial
Composure of its Nest with Hay, but furnished with Devices and
Stratagems to secure its self and young ones from its deadly Enemy
the Squirrel; as likewise from the Injury of the Weather; which
being unable to oppose, it eludes with this Artifice, contriving the
Nest like a Steeple-hive, with winding Meanders; before which
hangs a Penthouse for the Rain to pass, tying it by so slender a Thread
to the Bough of the Tree, that the Squirrel dare not venture his Bo∣dy,
though his Mouth water at the Eggs and Prey within; yet it is
strong enough to bear the hanging habitation of the Ingenious Con∣triver,
free from all the Assaults of its Antagonist, and all the Acci∣dents
of Gusts and Storms: Hundreds of these Pendulous Nests
may be seen on these Trees.</P>
<P>Here is another Tree called <HI>Brabb,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Brabb</HI>-Tree.</NOTE> bodied like a Cocoe, but the
Leaves grow round like a Peacock's Tail set upright, of the same
substance with the Cocoe, only varying in figure; the Fruit of this
is less than the Cocoe, and filled with a Gelly; the Wine from this
is preferred new, before the other; there is a Tuft at top, cut off and
boil'd eats like Colliflowers; on which Tree these Birds build also.</P>
<P>And now the Rains are set in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rains set in.</NOTE> all Hostilities and Commerce cease,
and every one provides for this time, as the laborious Ant for the

place afloat, and the Rains and Thunder are violent enough to con∣vince
the incredulous of a possibility of a General Deluge. This

<P>THE Ambassador having received Instructions, and got all
things ready for his Journey, embark'd on a <HI>Bombaim Shebar</HI>
(together with two <HI>English</HI> Factors, who were appointed by the
Honourable the President to accompany him); and about Nine
a Clock at Night arrived at <HI>Choul,</HI> a <HI>Portugal</HI> City on the Main,
into which he could not enter, the Gates being shut up, and Watch
set; so that they passed this Night in the Suburbs, in a small Church
called St. <HI>Sebastians;</HI> and the next day about Three in the After∣noon
receiving Advice that <HI>Seva Gi</HI> was returned to <HI>Rairee</HI> from
<HI>Chiblone,</HI> departed thence to Upper <HI>Choul,</HI> a Town belonging to the
<HI>Rajah,</HI> about two Miles distant from the <HI>Portugal</HI> City; and was in
former time a great Mart of all sorts of <HI>Duccan</HI> Commodities; but
now totally ruined by the late Wars betwixt the <HI>Mogul</HI> and <HI>Seva Gi,</HI>
whose Arms have plundered and laid it waste.</P>
<P>The <HI>Subidar</HI> of this Town being a Person of Quality,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Subi∣dar</HI> is created.</NOTE> who com∣mands
the Countries opposite to <HI>Bombaim,</HI> as <HI>Magatan, Penn,</HI> and
<HI>Tull,</HI> he thought good to give him a Visit, and to present him with
a couple of <HI>Pamerins;</HI> and the rather, because he understood by the
Linguist <HI>Naran Sinaij,</HI> he had some Aversion to our Nation, and
might hinder our Proceedings at Court; from which he was willing
to take him off by all fair means: He received the Visit kindly, and
promised all Courtesy that lay in his Power to perform; and after
some immaterial Discourse they returned to their Tents.</P>
<P>The Day following they took Boat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed on their Journey.</NOTE> and sailed up <HI>Choul</HI> River, to
a Town called <HI>Esthemy,</HI> six Leagues distance from <HI>Choul,</HI> where they
staid till next day; and set forth about six in the Morn from <HI>Esthemy,</HI>
and about Sun-set pitched their Tent in a Plain, six Miles short of
<HI>Nishampore,</HI> where they stayed about an hour to refresh their <HI>Coolies,</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="57"/>
and then set forward for <HI>Nishampore,</HI> and at Nine passing by <HI>Ni∣shampore,</HI>
arrived next Morning at <HI>Gongouly,</HI> a little Villag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> situated
on the Bank of a pleasant Rivulet; from whence in a fair Day may
be discerned the Castle of <HI>Rairee:</HI> The day after they proceeded on
their Journy to <HI>Rairee,</HI> and about Nine of the Clock in the Evening
came to <HI>Puncharra,</HI> a Town at the Foot of the Hill, where they un∣derstood
that <HI>Seva Gi</HI> was departed thence to <HI>Purtaabgur,</HI> to visit the
Shrine of <HI>Bowany,</HI> a Pagod of great esteem with him, and celebrated
some Ceremonies there in order to his Coronation; having carried
with him several Presents, and among the rest a <HI>Lumbrico</HI> of pure
Gold, weighing about one <HI>Maund</HI> and a quarter, which is Forty
two Pounds, which he hath dedicated to the said Pagod.</P>
<P>In the interim,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seva Gi</HI> gone a Pilgrimage.</NOTE> understanding they could not be admitted into the
Castle till <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s return, they pitched their Tent inthe Plain; and
in order to their more speedy dispatch, make their Business known
to their Procurator <HI>Narun Gi Pundit</HI> (whose reception was very kind)
and delivered him his Honour's Letters; shewing him the several
Presents they brought for the <HI>Rajah,</HI> and Ministers of State; of which
he highly approved, and promised them to help them to the <HI>Rajah</HI>'s
presence, as soon as conveniently he could after his return from Pil∣grimage
to <HI>Purtaabgur:</HI> And bad them rest content, that his Endea∣vours
should be totally employed in the Honourable Company's In∣terest,
and procuring them a speedy dispatch: for which having ren∣dered
him Thanks, he presented him with the Articles which they
brought for the <HI>Rajah</HI> to sign, translated into <HI>Moratty</HI> Language;
which he said he would peruse, and then give his judgment of them.
He then took occasion to discourse with him concerning the Conclu∣sion
of a Peace betwixt the <HI>Rajah</HI> and the <HI>Syddy</HI> of <HI>Banda Rajapore;</HI>
urging many Arguments to create in him a belief it would be for the
<HI>Rajah</HI>'s advantage, but he would not be persuaded it was for his Ma∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er's
Interest to raise a Siege which had cost him so much Blood and
Treasure; especially now he hath such hopes of gaining the Place:
And therefore told them, it would be in vain to move it to the <HI>Rajah,</HI>
who was resolved to take in the Castle, let it cost him what it will:
And to that effect was daily sending down more Ordnance, Ammu∣nition,
Men and Money.</P>
<P>Our Ambassador replied, The President had no other Design in
making this motion, than that of a good Neighbour; having ob∣served
the Miseries each Party endured, and the general obstruction
of Trade, occasioned by the War; but since he desired him to desist
mentioning it to the <HI>Rajah,</HI> he should not trouble him therewith; but
what was more consistent with our own and his Interest; which was
the encouraging Trade and Merchandise in his Country, and opening
the ways to <HI>Baligaot,</HI> that Merchants might with safety bring down
their Goods to Port; which would be much to the <HI>Rajah</HI>'s Profit,
and encrease of his Treasury: And this he recommended to his Pru∣dence
to persuade the <HI>Rajah</HI> thereto; who being a Soldier from his
Infancy, its possible minded not such concerns.</P>
<P>To which he answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Offici∣ousn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a Chief Mini∣ster of State to the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> That he doubted not but it would be ef∣fected
in a short time; for that the King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> who is Owner
of those Countries (from whence most sorts of Wares come) being
weary of Wars with his Master, had sent several Embassies to con∣conclude
<PB N="79" REF="57"/>
a peace with him; which he thought would be made up in
two or three Months, and then the Ways would be free, and the
Merchants have Egress and Regress as formerly. That the <HI>Rajah,</HI>
after his Coronation, would act more like a Prince, by taking care of
his Subjects, and endeavouring the advancement of Commerce in
his Dominions; which he could not attend before, being in perpe∣tual
War with the <HI>Great M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gul,</HI> and King of <HI>Visiapour.</HI> This is the
Substance of his Discourse with <HI>Narun Gi Pundit,</HI> who seemed to him
to be a Man of Prudence and Esteem with his Master: So after a lit∣tle
sitting he took his leave of him, having first presented him with
a Diamond Ring, for which he expressed a liking; and his Eldest Son
a Couple of <HI>Pamerins,</HI> which are fine Mantles.</P>
<P>They continuing under their Tent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who procu∣red their pass up to the Ca∣stle.</NOTE> found it very hot and incom∣modious;
wherefore they were glad when they heard the <HI>Rajah</HI> was
returned from <HI>Purtaabgur,</HI> when the Ambassadour sollicited <HI>Narun
Gi Pundit</HI> to procure his leave to pass up the Hill into <HI>Rairee</HI> Castle:
The next day they receiv'd order to ascend the Hill into the Castle,
the <HI>Rajah</HI> having appointed an House for them; which they did;
leaving <HI>Puncharra</HI> about Three in the Afternoon, they arrived at the
top of that strong Mountain, forsaking the humble Clouds about
Sun-set.</P>
<P>It is fortified by Nature more than Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rairce</HI> a strong Hill.</NOTE> being of very difficult
access, there being but one Avenue to it, which is guarded by two
narrow Gates, and fortified by a strong Wall exceeding high, and
Bastions thereto: All the other part of the Mountain is a direct Pre∣cipice;
so that it's impregnable, except the Treachery of some in it
betray it. On the Mountain are many strong Buildings, as the <HI>Ra∣jah</HI>'s
Court, and Houses of other Ministers, to the number of about
300. It is in length about two Miles and an half, but no pleasant
Trees, or any sort of Grain grows thereon. Their House was about
a Mile from the <HI>Rajah</HI>'s Palace, into which they retired with no lit∣tle
content.</P>
<P>Four days after their ascent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> have Audi∣ence of <HI>Seva Gi.</HI></NOTE> by the sollicitation of <HI>Narun Gi Pun∣dit,</HI>
the <HI>Rajah</HI> gave them Audience, though busily imployed by ma∣ny
other great Affairs, relating to his Coronation and Marriage. Our
Ambassador presented him, and his Son <HI>Samba Gi Rajah,</HI> with the
Particulars appointed for them; which they took well satisfied with
them; and the <HI>Rajah</HI> assured them we might trade securely in all his
Countries without the least apprehension of Ill from him, for that
the Peace was concluded. Our Ambassadour replied, that was our
Intent; and to that intent the President had sent him to this Court
to procure the same Articles and Privileges we enjoyed in <HI>Indostan</HI>
and <HI>Persia,</HI> where we traded. He answered, it is well, and referred
our Business to <HI>Moro Pundit</HI> his <HI>Peshua,</HI> or Chancellour, to examine
our Articles, and give an account what they were. He and his Son
withdrew into their private Apartments, to consult with the <HI>Brach∣mines</HI>
about the Ceremonies preparatory to his Enstalment; which
chiefly consisted in Abstinence and Purifying; till which be over, he
will hear no farther of Business. They likewise departed to their
Lodgings.</P>
<P>A day or two after our Ambassador went to <HI>Narun Gi Pundit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Pre∣sents were made.</NOTE> and
took his Advice concerning the presenting of the rest; who told him
<PB N="80" REF="58"/>
he might go in Person to <HI>Moro Pundit,</HI> but to the rest he should send
by <HI>Naran Sinaij</HI> what was intended for them: Declaring likewise if
he would have his Work speedily effected, and without any impedi∣ment,
that it was necessary to be at some more charge to present Offi∣cers
with <HI>Pamerins,</HI> who were not in their List of Presents; to which
he assented, considering the time of the Year was so far spent, and
that if he should be forced to stay the whole Rains out at <HI>Rairee,</HI> the
Honourable Company's Charges would be greater than the Additio∣nal
Presents: He answered that two <HI>Pamerins</HI> were not enough for
<HI>Moro Pundit,</HI> that we must present him with four; and <HI>Peta Gi Pun∣dit
Vocanovice,</HI> or Publick Intelligencer, with the Diamond Ring,
valued at 125 Rupees.
<LIST>
<ITEM>The <HI>Dehir,</HI> or <HI>Persian Escrivan,</HI> with Four <HI>Pamerins.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sam Gi Nayne,</HI> Keeper of the Seal, with Four.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ab Gi Pundit <HI>Four.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And then he should not doubt of a speedy Conclusion; otherwise
they would raise Objections on purpose to impede the Negotiation.
For every Officer in Court expected something according to their De∣gree
and Charge.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Rajah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rajah, Seva Gi</HI> weighed in Gold.</NOTE> according to the <HI>Hindu</HI> Custom, was
weighed in Gold, and poised about 16000 Pagods, which Money,
together with an 100000 more is to be distributed among the <HI>Brach∣mines</HI>
after the day he is enthroned, who in great numbers flock hi∣ther
from all parts of his Territories.</P>
<P>Being earnest to press on his Errand he came for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grants the Request of the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> the Ambassador
sent to <HI>Narun Gi Pundit</HI> to know what was transacted in the Articles;
but was returned for Answer, The <HI>Rajah</HI> stopt his Ears to all Af∣fairs,
declaring he had granted all the Demands, except those two
Articles, expressing, Our Money shall go current in his Dominions,
and his on <HI>Bombaim;</HI> and that he shall restore whatever Wrecks may
happen on his Coasts belonging to the <HI>English,</HI> and Inhabitants of
<HI>Bombaim:</HI> The first he accounted unnecessary to be inserted, because
he forbids not the passing of any manner of Coins; nor on the other
side, can he force his Subjects to take those Monies whereby they
shall be Losers; but if our Coin be as fine an Allay, and as weighty
as the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s, and other Princes, he will not prohibit it. To the
other he says, that it is against the Laws of <HI>Conchon</HI> to restore any
Ships, Vessels, or Goods, that are driven ashore by Tempest, or
otherwise; and that should he grant us that Privilege, the <HI>French,
Dutch,</HI> and other Merchants, would claim the same Right; which
he could not grant without breaking a Custom has lasted many Ages:
The rest of our Desires he willingly conceded, embracing with
much satisfaction our Friendship, promising to himself and Country
much Happiness by our Settlement and Trade: Notwithstanding
<HI>Narun Gi Pundit</HI> did not altogether despair of obtaining our Wrecks,
because we enjoyed the same Privilege in the <HI>Mogul,</HI> and <HI>Duccan</HI>
Country.</P>
<P>Near a Month after they had been here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambas∣sador sum∣moned to the Coronation.</NOTE> <HI>Narun Gi Pundit</HI> sent
word, That to Morrow about Seven or Eight in the Morning, the
<HI>Rajah Seva Gi</HI> intended to ascend his Throne; and he would take it
kindly if they came to congratulate him thereon; that it was neces∣sary
to present him with some small thing, it not being the Custom
<PB N="81" REF="58"/>
of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Parts to appear before a Prince empty-handed. The
Ambassador sent him word, according to his Advice he would wait
on the <HI>Rajah</HI> at the prescribed time.</P>
<P>According next Morning he and his Retinue went to Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accordingly he attends.</NOTE>
and found the <HI>Rajah</HI> seated on a Magnificent Throne, and all his No∣bles
waiting on him in Rich Attire; his Son <HI>Samba Gi Rajah, Peshuah,
Mora Pundit,</HI> and a <HI>Brachmin</HI> of great Eminence, seated on an Ascent
under the Throne; the rest, as well Officers of the Army as others,
standing with great Respect. The <HI>English</HI> made their Obeisance at a di∣stance,
and <HI>Narun Sinai</HI> held up the Diamond Ring that was to be pre∣sented
him: He presently took notice of it, and ordered their coming
nearer, even to the Foot of the Throne, where being Vested, they were
desired to retire; which they did not so soon, but they took notice
on each side of the Throne there hung (according to the <HI>Moors</HI>
manner) on heads of Gilded Launces many Emblems of Dominion
and Government; as on the Right-hand were two great Fishes Heads
of Gold, with very large Teeth; on the Left, several Horses Tails,
a Pair of Gold Scales on a very high Launce's head, equally poized,
an Emblem of Justice; and as they returned, at the Palace Gate
stood two small Elephants on each side, and two fair Horses with
Gold Trappings, Bridles, and Rich Furniture; which made them ad∣mire
how they brought them up the Hill, the Passage being both
difficult and hazardous.</P>
<P>Two days after this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Rajah</HI> mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies a fourth Wife. <HI>Seva Gi</HI> signs the Articles.</NOTE> the <HI>Rajah</HI> was married to a Fourth Wife,
without State; and doth every day bestow Alms on the <HI>Brachmins.</HI></P>
<P>Some days after, <HI>Narun Gi Pundit</HI> sent word the <HI>Rajah</HI> had signed
their Articles, all but that about Money. Then the rest of the Mi∣nisters
of State signed them, and they went to receive them of <HI>Na∣run
Gi Pundit,</HI> who delivered them to the Ambassador with Expressi∣ons
of great Kindness for our Nation, and offered on all occasions to
be serviceable to the <HI>English</HI> at the Court of the <HI>Rajah.</HI></P>
<P>I will only add one Passage during the Stay of our Ambassador at
<HI>Rairee:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">No Nation eat more Flesh than the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> The Diet of this sort of People admits not of great Variety
or Cost, their delightfullest Food being only <HI>Cutchery,</HI> a sort of
Pulse and Rice mixed together, and boiled in Butter, with which
they grow Fat: But such Victuals could not be long pleasing to our
Merchants, who had been used to feed on good Flesh: It was there∣fore
signified to the <HI>Rajah,</HI> That Meat should be provided for them;
and to that end a Butcher that served those few <HI>Moors</HI> that were
there, that were able to go to the Charge of Meat, was ordered to
supply them with what Goat they should expend (nothing else here
being to be gotten for them), which he did accordingly, to the con∣sumption
of half a Goat a Day, which he found very profitable for
him, and thereupon was taken with a Curiosity to visit his new
Customers; to whom, when he came, it was told them, The ho∣nest
Butcher had made an Adventure up the Hill, though very old,
to have the sight of his good Masters, who had taken off of his
hands more Flesh in that time they had been there, than he had sold
in some Years before; so rare a thing is it to eat Flesh among them;
for the <HI>Gentiles</HI> eat none, and the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> eat it well
<PB N="82" REF="59"/>
stew'd, bak'd, or made into Pottage; no Nation eating it roasted so
commonly as we do: And in this point I doubt we err in these Hot
Countries, where our Spirits being always upon the Flight, are not
so intent on the business of Concoction; so that those things that
are easiest digested, and that create that least trouble to the Stomach,
we find by Experience to agree best here.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our Passage to Swally, and Relation of the English Presidency
at Surat.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the Rains were over, and the <HI>North-East</HI> Wind had brought
in the Cool Season, by Command from the President I was
sent to <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>In a Week's time we turned it up, sailing by <HI>Baçein, Tarapore,
Valentine</HI>'s-<HI>Peak,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI>'s, and <HI>Daman,</HI> the last City Northward
on the Continent, belonging to the <HI>Portugueze.</HI> As also passing by
<HI>Balsore</HI> (the first Town of the <HI>Moors</HI> Southward of <HI>Surat</HI>) and eight
Ships riding at <HI>Surat</HI> River's Mouth, we then came to <HI>Swally Marine,</HI>
where were flying the several Colours of the Three Nations, <HI>English,
French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> on Flag-Staffs erected for that purpose, who here
land and ship off all Goods, without molestation.</P>
<P>Here we were welcomed by the Deputy-President,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival at <HI>Swally.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Matthew
Grey,</HI> an Eminent Merchant, and by the rest of the Council, who
took Care for my Entertainment, which here was but rude, the Place
admitting of little better Tenements than Booths, stiled by the name
of <HI>Choultries:</HI> Before President <HI>Andrew</HI>'s time they always lodged
in Tents; but since, Wooden Houses tiled with Pan-Tiles have been
raised in an Inclosure allotted by the Governor. In which Com∣pound
are included Warehouses, Stables, and other Out-houses, with
as good a Garden as this Sandy Soil will allow; in which ours ex∣ceeds
the other two, being far pleasanter seated.</P>
<P>To this place belong two sorts of Vermin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sands full of Fleas and <HI>Banyans.</HI></NOTE> the Fleas and <HI>Banyans;</HI>
the one harbouring in the Sand, fasten upon you as you pass; where
'tis some Pastime to see what Shift the <HI>Banyan</HI> makes, being bit by
them, he dare not kill them, for fear of unhousing a Soul, according
to their Notion of Transmigration; but giving them a severe Pinch
will put them to shift for themselves in a Nest of Cotton-Wool. The
other Vermin are the <HI>Banyans</HI> themselves▪ that hang like Horse∣leeches,
till they have suck'd both <HI>Sanguinen &amp; Succum</HI> (I mean Mony)
from you: As soon as you have set your Foot on Shore, they crowd
in their Service, interposing between you and all Civil Respect, as if
you had no other Business but to be gull'd; so that unless you have
some to make your way through them, they will interrupt your
going, and never leave till they have drawn out something for their
Advantage. At this time of Shipping they Present the Governor
<PB N="83" REF="59"/>
of <HI>Surat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. V.</NOTE> to license them to keep a Mart here, which they make the
<HI>Europeans</HI> pay dearly for: Yet such is their Policy, that without these,
neither you nor the Natives themselves shall do any Business,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Banyans</HI> pay Money to keep a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt.</NOTE> though
they are worse Brokers than <HI>Jews;</HI> if they be not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pawn of
them, the <HI>Rechabites,</HI> that would drink no Wine. These generally
are the Poorer sort, and set on by the Richer to Trade with the Sea∣men
for the meanest things they bring; and notwithstanding they
take them at their own rates, get well enough in exchange of Goods
with them. They are the absolute Map of Sordidness, fareing
hardly, and professing fairly, to entrap the unwary; enduring servily
foul Words, Affronts and Injuries, for a future hope of Gain; ex∣pert
in all the studied arts of Thriving and Insinuation; so that,
Lying, Dissembling, Cheating, are their Masterpiece: Their whole
desire is to have Money pass through their Fingers, to which a great
part is sure to stick: For they well understand the constant turning
of Cash amounts both to the Credit and Profit of him that is so
occupied; which these <HI>Banyans</HI> are sensible of, otherwise they would
not be so industrious to enslave themselves.</P>
<P>Having viewed the Tombs by the Sea-side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Travel to <HI>Su∣rat.</HI></NOTE> and some more con∣spicuous
at the end of the Plain belonging to the <HI>English;</HI> others
seated behind the <HI>Dutch Choultry,</HI> partly <HI>English,</HI> partly <HI>Dutch:</HI>
Marks set to avoid, as well the <HI>Sylla</HI> and <HI>Charibdis</HI> of <HI>Damkin</HI> and
<HI>Mora,</HI> two Nurseries for Stews, as to warm them of the Sands coming
into the Hole where the Ships ride at Anchor very securely: We
in the Company's Coaches Travelled to <HI>Surat,</HI> Ten Mile, brave
Champion ground; but the Coach wherein I was, breaking, we
were forced to mount the <HI>Indian Hackery,</HI> a Two-wheeled Chariot,
drawn by swift little Oxen. By Sun-set we entred the Company's
Barge, waiting to carry us over the River; where saluted us the
dreadful Noise of the <HI>Moors</HI> Drums and Trumpets, it being custo∣mary
for them to sound at the Castle every Three hours; but chiefly
at Sun-rise and Sun-set: I could think of nothing but the last Trump;
so that I could persuade my self there was little Musick in it; but
they say Time will bring it to be agreeable to the Ears. On the
other side the River, other Four wheeled Coaches expected us, and
the <HI>Moors</HI> let us pass the Custom-house without Examination, having
Women among us; which was no ordinary point of Civility, they
otherwise being strict Examiners, unless the President cross the River,
when they forbear also.</P>
<P>The Coach where the Women were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coaches and Guards.</NOTE> was covered with <HI>Cheeks,</HI> a
sort of hanging Curtain, made with Bents variously Coloured with
Lacker, and Chequered with Packthred so artificially, that you may
see all without, and your self within unperceived: Ours was open,
and guarded by such a Troop as went to apprehend our Saviour,
dressed after the same manner we find them on old Landskips, and
led by the same Phanatick Lights we see there Painted.</P>
<P>Our Reception at the <HI>English</HI> House was Courteous and Welcome,
for the Heat of the Day had tired us.</P>
<P>The House the <HI>English</HI> live in at <HI>Surat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> Factory.</NOTE> is partly the King's Gift,
partly hired; Built of Stone and excellent Timber, with good Car∣ving,
<PB N="84" REF="60"/>
without Representations; very strong, for that each Floor is
Half a Yard thick at least, of the best plastered Cement, which is
very weighty. It is contrived after the <HI>Moor</HI>'s Buildings, with up∣per
and lower Galleries, or Terras-walks; a neat Oratory, a con∣venient
open Place for Meals. The President has spacious Lodgings,
noble Rooms for Counsel and Entertainment, pleasant Tanks, Yards,
and an Hummum to Wash in; but no Gardens in the City, or very
few, though without they have many, like Wildernesses, overspread
with Trees. The <HI>English</HI> had a neat one, but <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s coming,
destroyed it: It is known, as the other Factories are, by their seve∣ral
Flags flying.</P>
<P>Here they live (in Shipping-time) in a continual hurly-burly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Full of Noise.</NOTE>
the <HI>Banyans</HI> presenting themselves from the hour of Ten till Noon;
and then Afternoon at Four till Night, as if it were an Exchange in
every Row; below stairs, the Packers and Warehouse-keepers, to∣gether
with Merchants bringing and receiving Musters, make a
meer <HI>Billinsgate;</HI> for if you make not a Noise, they hardly think
you intent on that you are doing.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Four Chief Offices.</NOTE> the Business is distributed into four Offices;
the Accomptant, who is next in Dignity to the President, the
general Accompts of all <HI>India,</HI> as well as this place, passing through
his hands; he is <HI>Quasi</HI> Treasurer, signing all things, though the
Broker keep the Cash. Next him is the Warehouse-keeper, who
Registers all <HI>Europe</HI> Goods Vended, and receives all <HI>Eastern</HI> Commo∣dities
Bought; under him is the Purser Marine, who gives Account
of all Goods Exported and Imported, pays Seamen their Wages, pro∣vides
Waggons and Porters, looks after Tackling for Ships, and
Ships Stores. Last of all is the Secretary, who models all Consul∣tations,
writes all Letters, carries them to the President and
Council to be perused and signed; keeps the Company's Seal,
which is affixed to all Passes and Commissions; records all Transacti∣ons,
and sends Copies of them to the Company; though none of
these, without the President's Approbation, can act or do any
thing. The Affairs of <HI>India</HI> are solely under his Regulation; from
him issue out all Orders, by him all Preferment is disposed; by
which means the Council are biassed by his Arbitrament.</P>
<P>The whole Mass of the Company's Servants may be compre∣hended
in these Classes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Compa∣ny's Servants. and their Sa∣laries.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> Merchants, Factors, and Writers;
some Blewcoat Boys also have been entertained under Notion of
Apprentices for seven Years, which being expired, if they can get
Security, they are capable of Employments. The Writers are obliged
to serve Five years for 10 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> giving in Bond of 500 <HI>l.</HI> for
good Behaviour, all which time they serve under some of the fore∣mentioned
Offices: After which they commence Factors, and rise
to Preferment and Trust, according to Seniority or Favour, and
therefore have a 1000 <HI>l.</HI> Bond exacted from them, and have their
Salary augmented to 20 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> for Three Years, then entring
into new Indentures, are made Senior Factors; and lastly, Mer∣chants after Three Years more; out of whom are chose Chiefs of
Factories, as Places fall, and are allowed 40 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> during their
<PB N="85" REF="60"/>
stay in the Company's service, besides Lodgings and Victuals at the
Company's Charges.</P>
<P>These in their several Seigniories behave themselves after the Fun∣damentals
of <HI>Surat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The under Factories mo∣delled by this.</NOTE> and in their respective Factories live in the like
Grandeur; from whence they rise successively to be of the Council
in <HI>Surat,</HI> which is the great Council; and if the President do not
contradict, are Sworn, and take their place accordingly, which consists
of about Five in Number, besides the President, to be constantly Re∣sident.</P>
<P>As for the Presidency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presiden∣cy.</NOTE> though the Company interpose a deserving
Man, yet they keep that Power to themselves, none assuming that
Dignity till confirmed by them: His Salary from the Company is
500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; half paid here, the other half reserved to be received
at home, in case of misdemeanor to make satisfaction; beside a Bond
of 5000 <HI>l. Sterling</HI> of good Securities.</P>
<P>The Accountant has 72 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> Fifty Pound paid here, the
other at home: All the rest are half paid here, half at home, ex∣cept

<P>Out of the Council are elected the Deputy-Governor of <HI>Bombaim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The advan∣tage of being at the Coun∣cil.</NOTE>

President, by the Interest of those whose Lot they are; chusing ra∣ther
to reside here, where Consignments compensate those Emolu∣ments;
so that none of the Council, if noted in <HI>England,</HI> but makes
considerably by his Place, after the rate of Five in the Hundred,

<P>But lest the New Company should be exclaimed against as too
greedy Monopolizers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Free∣men greater Slaves than their Servants.</NOTE> they permit Free Traders on their Island
<HI>Bombaim;</HI> when, to speak truth, they are in a far worse Condition
than their Servants; being tied up without hopes of raising them∣selves:
So that in earnest they find out that to be but a Trick.</P>
<P>However, to confess on the Company's behalf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Charges of the <HI>English</HI> Company not so great as the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE> the Trade (I
mean on this Coast) for some years lately passed has hardly ballanced
Expences. They employing yearly Forty Sail of stout Ships to and
from all Parts where they trade, out and home; Manning and main∣taining
their Island <HI>Bombaim, Fort St. George,</HI> and St. <HI>Helens;</HI> be∣sides
<PB N="87" REF="61"/>
large Sums expended to bear out the Port of their Factors;
which notwithstanding by impartial Computation has been found in∣ferior
to the Costs of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and therefore more to the pro∣fit
of the <HI>English East-India</HI> Company, than theirs, in the few Years
they have adventured; so that I should mightily blame them, should
they prove ungrateful to His Majesty, who by his gracious Favour
has united them in a Society, whereby they are Competitors, for
Riches (though not Strength) with the Noted'st Company in the
Universe.</P>
<P>This was granted presently after the Happy Restoration of our
Gracious Sovereign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Charter put in force.</NOTE> when Order began to dawn, and dispel the dark
Chaos of Popular Community: Then was sent out a President, to
put their Charter in Force, and establish a Graduation among their
Servants, which before was not observed; only for Orders sake,
they did nominate an Agent; the rest being independent, made no
distinction. When as now, after a better Model, they commence
according to their standing, and are under a Collegiate manner of
Restraint.</P>
<P>The last Agent was Agent <HI>Rivinton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Course of the Presidents.</NOTE> who was abolished by the
Company's sending out President <HI>Wych,</HI> who lived not much more
than two years: President <HI>Andrews</HI> took his place; and he resigning,
Sir <HI>George Oxendine</HI> held it till his Death; in whose time <HI>Seva Gi</HI>
plunder'd <HI>Surat;</HI> but he defended himself and the Merchants so
bravely, that he had a <HI>Collat</HI> or <HI>Serpaw,</HI> a Robe of Honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom
Head to Foot offered him from the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> with an Abatement
of Customs to Two and an half <HI>per Cent.</HI> granted to the Company:
For which his Masters, as a Token of the high Sense they
had of his Valour, presented him a Medal of Gold, with this
Device:
<Q>Non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri.</Q></P>
<P>After whose Decease, the Honourable <HI>Gerald Aungier</HI> took the
Chair, and encounter'd that bold Mountaineer a second time, with
as great Applause; when the Governor of the Town and Province
durst neither of them shew their Heads:
<Q>Fluctum enim totius Barbariae ferre urbs u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a non poterat.</Q></P>
<P>The Enemies by the help of an <HI>Europe</HI> Engineer had sprung a
Mine to blow up the Castle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> defend them∣selves with Honour a∣gainst <HI>Seva Gi</HI> a second time. The Power of the President.</NOTE> but being discovered, were repulsed;
for though he had set Fire to the rest of the City, they retained
the Castle, and the <HI>English</HI> their House.</P>
<P>The Extent of the Presidency is larger in its Missions than Resi∣dency;
in which Limits may be reckoned an hundred Company's
Servants continually in the Country; besides the Annual Advenues
of Ships, which during their Stay are all under the same Command:
Therefore what Irregularities are committed against only the Presi∣dency
or Company, in case of Non-Submission, the Persons offend∣ing
are to be sent home, and dismissed their Employments for Re∣fractoriness;
but if an higher Court lay hold of them in case of
<PB N="88" REF="62"/>
Murder or any Capital Crime, then they are to be sent to <HI>Bombaim,</HI>
there to have a Legal Trial, according to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> as
the President is created Governor of his Majesty's Island.</P>
<P>The ill managing of which Penalties formerly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill success of the first Ad∣venturers im∣puted to want of Govern∣ment, and War with <HI>Por∣tugal.</HI></NOTE> or the Invalidity
to inflict them, may be the true Cause of the Unprosperousness of
the Ancient Undertakers; who had this Inconveniency still attend∣ing,
to wit, the incorrigible stubborness of their own Men, after they
had overcome all other Difficulties, occasioned by the Grant of the
<HI>East</HI> to the <HI>Portugal,</HI> and <HI>West-Indies</HI> to the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> Nevertheless this
Fairy Gift was the Ground of a long and tedious Quarrel in each
of the World's Ends; so that our Ships encountring with their
<HI>Carracks,</HI> seldom used to part without the loss of one or both. Nay,
the long-liv'd People yet at <HI>Swalley,</HI> remember a notable Skirmish
betwixt the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> there, wherein they were neatly
intrapp'd; an Ambuscado of ours falling upon them behind in such
sort, that they were compelled between them and the Ships in the
Road, to resign most of their Lives; and gave by their Falla me∣morable
Name to a Point they yet call <HI>Bloody Point,</HI> for this very
reason. But since these Sores are fortunately bound up in that Con∣jugal
Tye betwixt our Sacred King and the Sister of <HI>Portugal,</HI> laying
all foul Words and Blows aside, let us see how the Affairs stand be∣twixt
them and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who followed our Steps, and got in at
the Breach we made. They made them more Work, not only beat∣ing
them out of their <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade, but possessed themselves of all
their Treasures of Spice, and have ever since kept them, with all
their Strong-holds, as far as <HI>Goa;</HI> they only enjoying the Gold Trade
of <HI>Mosambique</HI> undisturbed; the <HI>Japanners</HI> having banished both
their Commerce and Religion.</P>
<P>Wherefore our Ships almost alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Compa∣ny enrich this Port.</NOTE> were it not for a little the
<HI>French</HI> of late, lade Calicuts for <HI>Europe:</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Factory
here, that vend the Spices they bring from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and invest part
of the Money in course Cloath, to be disposed among their Planters,
or sold to the <HI>Malayans,</HI> and send the rest back in <HI>Rupees:</HI> So that we
singly have the Credit of the Port, and are of most advantage to the
Inhabitants, and fill the Custom-House with the substantialest In∣comes.
But not to defraud the <HI>French</HI> of their just Commendations,
whose Factory is better stor'd with <HI>Monsieurs</HI> than with Cash, they
live well, borrow Money, and make a Shew: Here are <HI>French
Capuchins,</HI> who have a Convent, and live in Esteem.</P>
<P>And here I might conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Diamond Trade better in the hands of the Com∣pany's Ser∣vants than in theirs.</NOTE> did not the Diamond Trade and other
Jewels interpose; which I could wish for the Company's sake might
never be struck out of their Indulgence allowed to their Servants:
For it will never amount to Advantage in their hands, because the
<HI>Jews,</HI> who are the chief Chapmen in <HI>England</HI> will blow upon them,
unless they come to their Prices, when more than enough is offered
them. But in particular hands the Case is otherwise, every one
snatching at a Prize, which none is sensible of, but the private Buyer;
but when they are publickly Invoiced, it will be at their own Wills to
make their Bargains. Withal, in the Company's Servants hands, it
not only keeps them Honest, but they grow Rich without wronging
<PB N="89" REF="62"/>
the Company: Whereas should they retract this, not only the <HI>Jews</HI>
would find others to furnish them, as the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> with
their Encomiendums; but other Monied Gentlemen in <HI>England</HI>
might be tempted to set up for Interloping, who know not how bet∣ter
to dispose of their Monies on any Bank, than by adventuring
Large Sums, that do now to my knowledge return them in a Year
and a half's time from 50 <HI>l.</HI> to 70 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> advance, and the Factors
good Gainers too; and all this while no Prejudice done either to
Freight or the Company's Trade; which if they will not believe, let
them experiment to their own Cost. Nor can I say more on this Sub∣ject,
than both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Jewellers coming over Land do un∣derstand,
who have made good Purchase by buying Jewels here, and
carrying them into <HI>Europe</HI> to be Cut and Set, and returning sell
them here to the <HI>Ombrahs,</HI> among whom were Monsieur <HI>Tavernier,</HI>
and now Monsieur <HI>Rezin,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Jordan.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GOING out to see the City of <HI>Surat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. I.</NOTE> I passed without
any Incivility,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rudeness of the Devotes,</NOTE> the better because I understood not what
they said; for though we meet not with Boys so rude as
in <HI>England,</HI> to run after Strangers, yet here are a sort of
bold, lusty, and most an end, drunken Beggars, of the <HI>Musslemen</HI>
Cast, that if they see a Christian in good Clothes, Mounted on a
stately Horse, with rich Trappings, are presently upon their Puncti∣lio's
with God Almighty, and interrogate him, Why he suffers him
to go a Foot, and in Rags, and this <HI>Coffery</HI> (Unbeliever) to vaunt
it thus? And are hardly restrained from running a <HI>Muck</HI> (which is
to kill whoever they meet, till they be slain themselves) especially
if they have been at <HI>Hodge,</HI> a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca,</HI> and thence to
<HI>Juddah,</HI> where is <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb; these commonly, like evil Spi∣rits,
have their Habitations among the Tombs: Nor can we com∣plain
only of this Libertinism, for the Rich <HI>Moormen</HI> themselves are
persecuted by these Rascals.</P>
<P>As for the rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Seamen.</NOTE> they are very respectful, unless the Seamen or
Soldiers get Drunk, either with <HI>Toddy,</HI> or <HI>Bang</HI> (a pleasant intoxi∣cating
Seed, mixed with Milk) then are they Monarchs, and it is
<PB N="92" REF="64"/>
Madness to oppose them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter III.</NOTE> but leave them to themselves, and they
will vent that Fury, by breathing a Vein or two with their own
Swords, sometimes slashing themselves most Barbarously.</P>
<P>The Town has very many noble lofty Houses of the <HI>Moor-Mer∣chants,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Build∣ings.</NOTE>
flat at top, and Terassed with Plaster. There is a <HI>Parsy,</HI>
Broker to the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> has turned the outside of his Pockets
on a sumptuous House, a spacious Fabrick, but ill contrived, as are
many of the <HI>Banians.</HI> They, for the most part, affect not stately
Buildings, living in humble Cells or Sheds. Glass is dear, and
scarcely purchaseable (unless by way of <HI>Stambole,</HI> or <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
from the <HI>Venetians,</HI> from whom they have some Panes of Painted
Glass in Sash Windows) therefore their Windows, except some
few of the highest Note, are usually folding Doors, skreened with
Cheeks, or Latises, Carved in Wood, or Ising-glass, or more com∣monly
Oister-shells. The greatest Commodity here is Air, which
is to be admired in the Rich <HI>Banyans,</HI> how they stew themselves out
of a penurious humour, crowding Three or Four Families together
into an Hovel, with Goats, Cows, and Calves, all Chamber-fel∣lows,
that they are almost poysoned with Vermin and Nastiness;
but surely they take delight in it, for they will fresh and fasting be∣sprinkle
themselves with the Stale of a Cow, as you behold a good
Christian with Holy-water, or a <HI>Moorman</HI> slabber his Beard with
Rose-water: Nay more, they use it as a Potion, or <HI>Philter,</HI> and
bid the Devil do his worst after it; so stupid, that notwithstanding
Chints, Fleas, and Muskeeto's, torment them every Minute, dare
not presume to scratch where it itches, lest some Relation should
be untenanted its miserable abode.</P>
<P>The Habits and Customs of this place are reconcilable with them
in the Kingdom of <HI>Gulconda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heathen Rites more suppressed here than in <HI>Gulconda.</HI></NOTE> only the <HI>Moguls</HI> being more absolute,
and of a more Puritanical Sect than the <HI>Chia</HI>'s; the Heathens are
suppressed in respect of their Barbarous Rites, and reduced to a more
civil Garb, being more decently Clothed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moguls,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moguls</HI> and <HI>Chia</HI>'s dis∣agree.</NOTE> who are Lords here, differ from them of <HI>Gulconda</HI> in
point of their <HI>Caliph</HI>'s Succession, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he first maintaining the Sect of
the <HI>Arabs,</HI> the others of the <HI>Suffean,</HI> or <HI>Persian.</HI></P>
<P>They have Four Expositors of the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sects of the <HI>Moguls.</HI></NOTE> to whom they give Cre∣dit
in matter of Ceremonies, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Their great scruple is about Eating together among all sorts of
these <HI>Eastern</HI> Nations.</P>
<P>All <HI>Musselmen</HI> (true Believers) as they call themselves of this
Persuasion, Communicate in that point; only some Punctilio's in
respect of Marriage remain yet undecided; as for an <HI>Hanoffi</HI> to
offer his Daughter to a <HI>Shoffi,</HI> is a great shame; but if the other
request it first, he may comply without derogation.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="64"/>
They are distinguished, some according to the Consanguinity
they claim with <HI>Mahomet;</HI> as a <HI>Siad</HI> is a Kin to that Imposture, and
therefore only assumes to himself a Green Vest and <HI>Puckery</HI> (or
Turbat) none other being permitted to wear them. A <HI>Shiek</HI> is a
Cousin too, at a distance, into which Relation they admit all new
made Proselytes. <HI>Meer</HI> is somewhat Allied also, and <HI>Mussanne.</HI>
The rest are adopted under the Name of the Province or Kingdom
they are Born in, as <HI>Mogul</HI> the Race of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and are esteemed,
as the Name imports, <HI>White</HI> Men; <HI>Patan, Duccan;</HI> or Schisms they
have made, as <HI>Bilhim, Jemottee,</HI> and the lowest of all is <HI>Borrah.</HI></P>
<P>These Eat highly of all Flesh <HI>Dumpoked,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Diet.</NOTE> which is Baked with
Spice in Butter; <HI>Pullow,</HI> a Stew of Rice and Butter, with Flesh,
Fowl, or Fish; Fruits, Achars, or Pickles, and Sweatmeats: If
they invite a Christian, they order Dishes apart, and between Meals
Entertain with <HI>Coho,</HI> Tobacco, <HI>Pawn,</HI> which makes a fragrant
Breath, and gives a rare Vermilion to the Lips; and as a great
Compliment drown you with Rosewater, Senting themselves with
Essence of <HI>Sandal</HI> and Oranges, very Costly, and exquisitely Ex∣tracted.
They drink no Wine Publickly, but Privately will be
good Fellows, not content with such little Glasses as we drink out
of, nor Claret or Rhenish (which they call Vinegar) but Sack
and Brandy out of the Bottle they will Tipple, till they are well
warmed.</P>
<P>At the First entrance into their Houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of En∣tertainment.</NOTE> for the greater Respect,
they meet at the Portal, and usher Strangers to the place of Enter∣tainment;
where, out of common Courtesy, as well as Religion,
(when they enter an Holy Place) they pull off their Slippers, and
after the usual <HI>Salams,</HI> seat themselves in <HI>Choultries,</HI> open to some
<HI>Tank</HI> of purling Water; commonly spread with Carpets, or <HI>Siturngees,</HI>
and long round Cushions of Velvet to bolster their Back and Sides,
which they use when they ride in their Chariots, which are made
to sit Cross-legg'd on, not their Legs hanging down as ours; it be∣ing
accounted among them no good breeding to let their Legs or
Feet be seen whilst sitting: In their <HI>Palenkeens,</HI> Coaches, or swing∣ing
Cotts, which they affect for Ease, are laid huge Bolsters of state,
and Quilts of Cotton to lie at length., their Ceilings and Posts
are Hung with <HI>Mechlapatan Pintado</HI>'s, and adorned with other
Gallantry.</P>
<P>They go rich in Attire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Attire is Rich.</NOTE> with a Poniard, or <HI>Catarre,</HI> at their
Girdle; as they are Neat in Apparel, they are Grave in their
Carriage.</P>
<P>Their Women wear the Breeches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women wear Jewels.</NOTE> but in a most servile condition;
yet they have their Ornaments of Head, with Bracelets of Pearl,
Ear-rings and Nose-rings, to which they hang Jewels, mostly set
in Silver, because Gold is <HI>Nigess,</HI> or Unclean.</P>
<P>They are strict observers of the Hours of Prayer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strict obser∣vers of the Hours of Prayer.</NOTE> when they
strip off all their Gorgeous Habiliments to their Shift, and after
Washing Hands and Feet, Prostrate themselves during the time of
Devotion, when Rising they Salute their Guardian-Angels according
to the Opinion of the Stoicks, who allotted every one his <HI>Juno</HI> and
his <HI>Genius;</HI> having made their <HI>Orisons,</HI> and Purified themselves, they
return to Company as before.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="65"/>
They are great Revellers by Night, in the heat of the Day they
sleep and dally.</P>
<P>They circumcise the Foreskin of the Male,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Revel∣lers at Cir∣cumcisions and</NOTE> which is performed
by a Barber, at Eight years of Age; with Feasting, and carrying the
Boy about in pomp, with Musick and great Expressions of Joy. Of
the Girls they make small account, they being instructed within doors
how to pray.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cazy</HI> or Judge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriages.</NOTE> after the Match is made by the Parents, mar∣ries
them; from whence doubtless our Phanaticks borrowed their
Custom of Marrying by a Justice of Peace: This is also a time of
Solemnity sometimes kept for several Weeks together with Illumina∣tions
on their Houses, their Garments tinctured with Saffron, riding
triumphantly through the Streets with Trumpets and Kettle Drums;
fetching the Bride from her Kindred, and they sending Banquets,
Houshold-stuff, and Slaves their Attendants, with a great Train
through their Streets, which is all their Dowry: But the <HI>Cazy</HI> has a
Knack beyond those Couplers of <HI>Europe,</HI> he can loose the Knot when
they plead a Divorce. They have four Wives if they can maintain
them, and as many other Women as they please; she that bears the
first Son is reckoned the Chief.</P>
<P>At their Labours they seldom call Midwives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quick in La∣bour.</NOTE> being pretty quick
that way, though there are not a few live well by that Profession;
known by Tufts of Silk on their Shooes or Slippers, all other Wo∣men
wearing them plain: At the end of their <HI>Quarentine,</HI> which is
Forty days, after the Old Law, they enter the <HI>Hummums</HI> to Purify;
and the Child, without much Ceremony, is named by the Pa∣rents.</P>
<P>At Funerals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Lamen∣tation when any dye.</NOTE> the <HI>Mullahs</HI> or Priests, make Orations or Sermons,
after a Lesson read out of the <HI>Alchoran,</HI> and lay them <HI>North</HI> and
<HI>South,</HI> as we do <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West,</HI> when they are Inhumed, expecting
from that Quarter the appearance of their Prophet. Upon the death
of any, in the hearing of the Outcry, which is great among the
Women, beating their Breasts, and crying aloud, they neither eat,
nor shift their Cloaths, till the Person be interred; the Relations
mourn by keeping on dirty Cloaths, and a neglect of their Apparel;
neither washing nor shaving themselves: It is usual to hire People to
lament, and the Widow once a Moon go to the Grave with her Ac∣quaintance
to repeat the doleful Dirge, after which she bestows <HI>Hol∣way,</HI>
a kind of Sacramental Wafer; and entreats their Prayers for the
Soul of the Departed; and for that reason the most store of Graves
are in Cross-ways, or High-roads, that the Passengers may be put in
mind of that Office: They never Enshrine any in their <HI>Moschs,</HI> but
in the places adjoining them; where they build Tombs, and leave
Stipends for <HI>Mullahs</HI> to offer Petitions up for them.</P>
<P>The Duty of the <HI>Mallahs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duty of their Priests.</NOTE> besides these, is to call from the Stee∣ples
of their <HI>Maschs</HI> every <HI>Pore,</HI> that is, once in Three hours stop∣ping
their Ears with their Fingers: <HI>Allah Eckbar, Allah Eckbar, Es∣chadu
ela Hale ilallah we Eschedu, Mahmed ewesul: Cuah Fleje ala

God is Great, I profess, there is no Deity but God, and confess that
<HI>Mahomet</HI> is the Prophet of God. Their Priests say Prayers five times
<PB N="95" REF="65"/>
a-day, and expound the <HI>Alcheran</HI> once a-week, and that on <HI>Friday,</HI>
which day they are not to lye with their Women, setting it apart for
the Service of God.</P>
<P>Here is a <HI>Xeriff,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Xeriff</HI> their High-Priest.</NOTE> who is as it were their Primate, under him the
<HI>Cazys,</HI> or Judges, are the next, then the Inferior Clergy, as the
<HI>Mullahs,</HI> and <HI>Scribes,</HI> or Teachers of Youth in the <HI>Arabick</HI>

in that Order, till he came to the Throne, must be numbred the
<HI>Fakiers</HI> or Holy Men, abstracted from the World, and resigned to
God, for the Word will bear that Interpretation; on this Pretence
are committed sundry Extravagancies, as putting themselves on vo∣luntary
Penances. Here is one that has vowed to hang by the
Heels, till he get Money enough to build a <HI>Mosch</HI> to <HI>Mah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>met,</HI> that
he may be held a Saint. Another shall travel the Country with an
Horn blowed afore him, and an Ox it may be to carry him and his
Baggage, besides one to wait on him with a Peacock's Tail; whilst
he rattles a great Iron Chain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettered to his Foot, as big as those Ele∣phants
are Foot-locked with, some two yards in length; every Link
thicker than a Man's Thumb, and a Palm in length; his shaking
this speaks his Necessity, which the poor <HI>Gentiles</HI> dare not deny to
relieve; for if they do, he accuses them to the <HI>Cazy,</HI> who desires no
better opportunity to fleece them: For they will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stick to swear
they blasphemed <HI>Mahomet,</HI> for which there is no evasion but to de∣posit,
or be cut, and made a <HI>Moor.</HI></P>
<P>Most of these are Vagabonds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They make every place their home, and all their own.</NOTE> and are the Pest of the Nation they
live in; some of them live in Gardens and retired Places in the Fields,
in the same manner as the <HI>Seers</HI> of old, and the Children of the Pro∣phets
did: Their Habit is the main thing that signalizes them more
than their Virtue; they profess Poverty, but make all things their
own where they come; all the heat of the Day they idle it under
some shady Tree, at night they come in Troops, armed with a great
Pole, a <HI>Mirchal</HI> or Peacock's Tail, and a Wallet; more like Plun∣derers
than Beggers; they go into the Market, or to the Shop∣keepers,
and force an Alms, none of them returning without his
share: Some of them pass the bounds of a modest Request, and bawl
out in the open Streets for an Hundred <HI>Rupees,</HI> and nothing less will
satisfy these.</P>
<P>They are cloathed with a ragged Mantle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How clad:</NOTE> which serves them also
for a Matrass, for which purpose some have Lyons, Tygres or Leo∣pards
Skins to lay under them: The Civilest of them wear Flesh-co∣loured
Vests, somewhat like our Brick-makers Frocks, and almost of
that Colour. The Merchants, as their Adventures return, are
bountiful towards them, by which means some of them thrive
upon it.</P>
<P>These Field Conventiclers at the hours of Devotion beat a Drum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are be∣come formi∣dable.</NOTE>
from them called the <HI>Fakiers</HI> Drum; here are of these Strolers about
this City enough to make an Army, that they are almost become for∣midable
to the Citizens; nor is the Governour powerful enough to
correct their Insolencies. For lately setting on a Nobleman of the
<HI>Moors,</HI> when his Kindred came to demand Justice, they unanimously
<PB N="96" REF="66"/>
rose in defence of the Aggressor, and rescued him from his deserved
Punishment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter II.</NOTE></P>
<P>For all the Governor comes to his Seat attended every Morning
with 300 Foot with Fire-Arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Governor not able to quell them.</NOTE> Three Elephants in their Cloathing
(which is here also a principal Mark of the Greatness of these Men in
place, the more Elephants they keep, they are looked on as more
Honourable) Forty Horses mounted, Four and twenty Banners of
State; besides a large Retinue of the <HI>Cazy</HI>'s, who is always present
to assist him in Law Points. Moreover he has Loud Trumpets made
as big, and like our <HI>Stentoro Phonica,</HI> or speaking Trumpet, with
Thundring Kettle-Drums; yet neither the Formality of this Ap∣pearance,
nor regard due to his Office, is terrible enough to prevail
with these to submit to resign the Caitiff, and hardly is his whole
Force able to keep them from bare-faced Rebellion.</P>
<P>But though these Outlaws (for as such they ought to be look'd
on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Villany of the Gover∣nor's Servants had a Tragi∣cal Event.</NOTE> while they disown all Subjection) behave themselves thus, the
poor Inhabitants that work for their Bread, are under severer Re∣straints;
for the Governor's Servants being upheld by as uncon∣trouled
Licentiousness, on pretence of pressing the Craftsmen from
their daily Labour into the Governor's Service, extort continued
Fees from them, or else they are sure to be set on work, without any
thing for their Pains: Which was but even now made a Publick
Grievance, by the Resistance of a sturdy <HI>Patan,</HI> (who is sprung from
a Warlike People, of whom it is said, They never draw their
Swords, but Blood must follow): And thus it happen'd; The <HI>Patan</HI>
having employ'd a Taylor at his house, one of the Governor's Men
seized him for his Master's Service; but the <HI>Patan</HI> rushing in to re∣lease
him, the Soldier ran a young Brother of the <HI>Patan</HI>'s through,
naked and unconcerned in the Scuffle; which so enraged the <HI>Patan,</HI>
that forcing the Sword out of the hand of this inhuman Butcher,
he kill'd him and two more that came to his Rescue; and going in∣to
his house, slew his own Wife, and Sister, and a little Son of his
own, that they might not fall a Sacrifice to the Governor's Rage:
The wretched Taylor, animated by the Example of the <HI>Patan</HI> (tho
but coolly), had murder'd his Wife had she not fled; but laying
hold on his Old Father and Mother, he dispatched them; and bolt∣ing
forth into the Street, set upon what Governor's Men he and the
<HI>Patan</HI> could meet: Tidings whereof striking the Governor's Ears, he
came with all his Power to beset the exasperated and desperate Men;
but though a Thousand Men were up in Arms, and gazing upon the
<HI>Patan</HI> standing with his Sword in his hand at the Entrance of the
House, none durst venture to apprehend him; till his Fury abating,
and Promises given by a Great Man, of Favour if he resigned; he
attending to his Parley, in the mean while two Men with Guns from
atop of the House discharged on him, and wounded him and the
Taylor mortally, but not before they had carried this false Great
Man with some of his Attendants along with them out of the
World: So that these Curs set to keep the Sheep, are the first that
worry them.</P>
<P>Lest therefore all Shew of Justice should be banished, now and
then, when they have not Mony to buy it off, or the Emperor be
<PB N="97" REF="66"/>
informed, some Exemplary Punishments are inflicted: Some In∣stances
whereof I shall relate.</P>
<P>The one was of an <HI>Armenian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some exem∣plary Punish∣ments.</NOTE> <HI>Chawbucked</HI> through the City for sel∣ling
of Wine. The other was of a Goldsmith who had coined Copper
<HI>Rupees;</HI> first they shaved his Head and Beard, as our Country men do
Bayliffs when they presume to Arrest in Priviledg'd Places; then
putting a Fool's Cap on his Head, they set him on an Ass, with his
Face to the Tail, which is led by an <HI>Holencore,</HI> and one of their
Drums is beat before him, which is an Affront of the highest degree;
thus they lead him up and down the City, where the Boys and Sol∣diers
treat him but scurvily, pelting him all the way he passes: Being
brought back to Prison, they cut off his Hand, and let him lye du∣ring
the Governor's Pleasure. The Third was of a Pack of Thieves
that had infested the Roads a long time, and after some whiles Impri∣sonment
the <HI>Banyans</HI> proffered Money for their Redemption; but the
<HI>Great Mogul</HI> sending an Express, they were led to Execution; They
were Fifteen, all of a Gang, who used to lurk under Hedges in nar∣row
Lanes, and as they found opportunity, by a Device of a Weight
tied to a Cotton Bowstring made of Guts, (with which they tew Cot∣ton)
of some length, they used to throw it upon Passengers so, that
winding it about their Necks, they pulled them from their Beasts, and
dragging them upon the Ground strangled them, and possessed them∣selves
of what they had: One of these was an Old Man with his
two Sons, the youngest not fourteen. This being their Practice,
they were sentenced, according to <HI>Lex Talionis,</HI> to be hang'd;
wherefore being delivered to the <HI>Catwal,</HI> or Sheriff's Men, they
led them two Miles with Ropes about their Necks to some wild Date-Trees:
In their way thither they were chearful, and went singing,
and smoaking Tobacco, the <HI>Banyans</HI> giving them Sweetmeats, they
being as jolly as if going to a Wedding; and the Young Lad now
ready to be tied up, boasted, That though he were not Fourteen
Years of Age, he had killed his Fifteen Men; wherefore the Old
Man, as he had been a Leader of these Two, was first made an Exam∣ple
for his Villany, and then the two Striplings were advanced, as
all the rest were, half a Foot from the Ground; and then cutting
their Legs off that the Blood might flow from them, they left them
miserable Spectacles, hanging till they dropped of their own
accord.</P>
<P>The following Delinquents being of another kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delinquents of another kind.</NOTE> we shall see
how they fare: The one was of a Rich Merchant of the <HI>Moors</HI> kil∣ling
his Wife, and a Child he had by her of Three Years old, upon
taking her with her Paramour in Adultery; for which Crime a Pe∣cuniary
Mulct excused him: The other was a Boy's sticking a <HI>So∣domitish
Moor</HI> to the Heart with his own <HI>Catarre,</HI> while he attempt∣ed
upon his Body; which Fact was so far from being accused as a
Fault, that the Boy came off with Commendation; though there
is nothing more frequently committed among them, than the unna∣tural
Sin of Buggery.</P>
<P>There is another thing above all the rest an unpardonable Offence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Crime of growing rich.</NOTE>
for a <HI>Banyan</HI> or Rich Broker to grow Wealthy without Protection of
some Great Person; for it is so mighty a Disquiet to the Governor,
<PB N="98" REF="67"/>
that he can never be at ease till he have seen the bottom of this Mis∣chief;
which is always cured by Transfusion of Treasure out of the
<HI>Banyans</HI> into the Governor's Coffers: Which makes them become
humble Suiters for the Umbrage of any of Quality, to skreen them
from this Violence.</P>
<P>The next in the Executive Power is the <HI>Catwal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iff.</NOTE> the Governor of
the Night, as the other two Great Officers rule the Day; or nearer
our Constitution, the Sheriff of the City: For after the Keys are carried
to the Governor, it is the <HI>Catwals</HI> Business with a Guard of near Two
hundred Men, to scower the Streets and Brothels of Idle Companions;
to take an account of all People late out, to discover Fires and House-breakers,
and to carry all lewd Persons to Prison, which is solely
committed to his Charge: So that all Night long he is heard by his
Drums and Trumpets, shouting and hallowing of his Crew in their
Perambulation through all Parts of the City; with Lights and Flam∣beaus,
with some few of his Companions in Coaches or <HI>Palenkeens:</HI>
Moreover he seises all Debtors, and secures them, and has the care of
Punishing and Executing all Offenders.</P>
<P>This is a Place of great Trust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chief Customer.</NOTE> but neither so Honourable or Pro∣fitable
as the <HI>Shawbunder</HI>'s is; who is King of the Port, or Chief
Customer, though something abated by the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s too fondly in a
Religious Vanity granting Immunity to the <HI>Musslemen</HI> lately, which
is no small detriment.</P>
<P>The Custom-house has a good Front, where the Chief Customer
appears certain hours to chop, that is, to mark Goods outward∣bound,
and clear those received in: Upon any suspicion of default
he has a Black-Guard that by a <HI>Chawbuck,</HI> a great Whip, extorts Con∣fession:
There is another hangs up at the daily Waiters, or <HI>Meerbar's
Choultry,</HI> by the Landing-place, as a terror to make them pay <HI>Caesar</HI>
his due; the Punishment, if detected, being only Corporal, not
Confiscation of Goods: This Place is filled with Publicans, Waiters
and Porters, who are always at the Receipt of Custom, but are a lit∣tle
too tardy sometimes in the delivery of Goods, making the Mer∣chant
dance attendance, till a right understanding be created be∣twixt
the <HI>Shawbunder</HI> and them, which commonly follows when the
Fist is mollified.</P>
<P>Over-against the Custom-house is a stately Entrance into the
Mint,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mint.</NOTE> which is a large Town of Offices within it self; hither re∣pair
all <HI>Shreffs</HI> or Bankers, for the proof of Silver, which in this
place is the most refined, and purest from allay, in the World; as is
also their Gold: Their lowest Coyn is of Copper.</P>
<P>Between these two is a crowded <HI>Buzzar</HI> of all those who come to
sell and buy Cloath; being disengaged here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Mar∣kets.</NOTE> we pass the High-Streets,
with Shops on each side, not like ours in <HI>Europe,</HI> being more like
Pedlers Stalls; we crossed several <HI>Buzzars,</HI> which yielded sustinence
to the many Mouths we encountred.</P>
<P>Piercing thorough the City to the Walls which are building to sur∣round
it, and a Ditch accompanying it, (though but shallow, yet
the Wall is high, and of good well baked Brick) at length we came
in sight of the Castle, having a large <HI>Pomarium.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="67"/>
They say it has been standing ever since <HI>Tamberlane</HI> was here;
who they give out to be its Founder:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle built by <HI>Tam∣berlane.</HI></NOTE> It may be so, for it is old,
yet bears 30 or 40 stout Pieces of Ordnance, fronts the River, and
is Moated by it; to which they pass a Draw bridge, but admit no
Stranger: It is Manned by 300 <HI>Luscarries</HI> or Soldiers, armed with
Gun, Sword and Buckler, has a peculiar Governor independent from
him of the Town or Province, being as it were confined to it, not
presuming, on forfeiture of his Head, on any account to pass out of
a Garden by the Bridge, it being his farthest Walk.</P>
<P>Up and down the City are Remains of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Fury, the Ruins
being not yet repaired; of whom they stand in hourly fear, having
their Sores still fresh in their Memory: To prevent whose Rage, they
are collecting an Hundred thousand <HI>Rupees</HI> till their Walls be finished,
when we shall see how they will defend them; having 700 Men
allotted for that Office, besides <HI>Europe</HI> Gunners at every Gate, which
are Six in number, beside 36 Bastions with half a dozen great Guns
apiece: Upon the top they have piled spiked Timber to annoy the
Scalers.</P>
<P>Every Gate is barbed with Iron Spikes to break the rushing in of
the Elephants;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wall and Gates.</NOTE> these also are under a distinct Command.</P>
<P>The Governor of the Town has an Army of 1500 Men in pay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of Soldiers.</NOTE>
with Matchlocks, Swords and Javelins; Two hundred Horse with
Quivers full of Arrows at the Bow of their Saddles, Lances at their
Right Stirrup, and Swords of an unweildy bulk, with Bucklers hang∣ing
over their Shoulders; their Bows are curiously and strongly
made with Horn, and for that reason better in Dry than Wet
Weather.</P>
<P>Among the many <HI>Moschs</HI> to and again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their <HI>Moschs.</HI></NOTE> only two are famous with
long Spires by the Wall, where is a stately Dwelling for the
<HI>Xeriff.</HI></P>
<P>They have Three other Places for Strangers called <HI>Caravan Se∣rawes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Caravans.</NOTE>
or Inns, intended by the Donors <HI>gratis,</HI> but since perverted,
and let out to Foreigners.</P>
<P>Near the Governor's Stables were Forty Camels housed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stables.</NOTE> ready for
War, and half a dozen Elephants.</P>
<P>These Stables are rather Sheds, or Booths of Hair-cloath, to re∣move
on occasion, than any Building fixed for that purpose; and
were it not for the manner of treating their Horses, not worth the
mentioning: They have no Racks, but feed as Nature intended them,
from the Ground, if they get Hay; for their Corn, it is usually <HI>Ga∣ravance,</HI>
a sort of Pease which they put into an Hair Bag, and by a
String (clapping their Mouths into it) fastned behind their Ears, is
kept from the Ground; out of this they have their daily Allowance;
beside Butter, Sugar and <HI>Jaggaree</HI> or Mulasso's made into Past, with
the Meal of <HI>Garavance,</HI> which fattens all their Beasts of War, and
makes them slick and fine; they cover them very warm with a
kind of Felt or Flock-work, two or three double, and tye them by
all their Feet stretched out at length; in which posture they always
stand: When they make their Beds, they sift the Dung they make,
after it is dried in the Sun, and make a soft lying for them of it;
they court them with all the gentleness and kind Speeches imagi∣nable,
<PB N="100" REF="68"/>
seldom or never speaking to, or using them harshly; every
Horse has one Man wholly imployed about his Service, and pretends
to no other business; so that as good Horses are chargeable to pur∣chase,
they are also chargeable in keeping.</P>
<P>The Governor about this time taking occasion to quarrel with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Governor quarrels with the <HI>Dutch.</HI></NOTE> offering several Abuses both of Body and Purse; the Commo∣dore
was resolved no longer to endure it, and therefore had sent for
their Fleet, and in the mean time threatned to remove the Factory
to <HI>Gogo,</HI> a Port over-against <HI>Swally;</HI> which with <HI>Diu Point</HI> makes
<HI>Swally Hole:</HI> To prevent which, a Decoy was put upon all <HI>Fringi</HI>'s,
that we could not go out of the Gates of the City, but by especial
Commission from the Governor.</P>

<P>HAving obtained Leave of the Governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Raspoots</HI> take Toll with the <HI>Mogul.</HI></NOTE> we went out of the
Walls by <HI>Broach</HI>-Gate (they taking Names from the chief Pla∣ces
they lead to), where, as at every Gate, stands a <HI>Chocky,</HI> or
Watch to receive Toll for the Emperor; and which is a shame, a
<HI>Raspoot</HI> also for the <HI>Raspoots</HI> otherwise they would infest the Villa∣ges
adjacent, and drive away the Cattel; for all which it is unsafe
to be far out of the Town late at Night, unless well guarded. This
way was all strewed with <HI>Moor-men</HI>'s Tombs, and one of especial
Note of a <HI>Persian</HI> Ambassador, who returning from <HI>England</HI> with
Sir <HI>Anthony Shirley,</HI> is reported to poyson himself here, rather than
answer some ill Management of his Office to his Master: Not far
from whence, on a small Hill on the left hand of the Road, lies
<HI>Tom Coriat,</HI> our <HI>English Fakier</HI> (as they name him), together with
an <HI>Armenian</HI> Christian, known by their Graves lying <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West:</HI>
He was so confident of his Perfection in the <HI>Indostan</HI> Tongue, that he
ventured to play the Orator in it before the <HI>Great Mogul.</HI> In his re∣turn
from him he was killed with Kindness by the <HI>English</HI> Merchants,
which laid his rambling Brains at Rest.</P>
<P>From hence we passed over to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Tombs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Ar∣menian</HI> tombs.</NOTE> many and hand∣some,
most of them Pargetted. Adjoining to which the <HI>Armenians</HI>
have a Garden, where on a Terras (Forty Yards in Length, and Five
in Breadth) are reared several Monuments Coffin-Fashion, with a
place to burn Incense at the Head, like the <HI>Moors,</HI> only over it a
Cross: One of more Eminency had an Arch over it at the upper-end.</P>
<P>Thence we took a Round, though the Inclosures are contiguous,
to the <HI>English</HI> Tombs, short of which the <HI>Portugals</HI> have a Burial-Place.</P>
<P>The Ground the <HI>English</HI> Dead are inhumed in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> Burial-Place.</NOTE> is stocked not with

<P><PB N="101" REF="68"/>
The <HI>French</HI> have a separate Place to deposit their Dead, overagainst
the <HI>English,</HI> with only one single Tomb, and that a small one.</P>
<P>In every place up and down the Fields are Tombs of <HI>Musslemen:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> Tomb The <HI>Burfta's</HI> or Heathen Wanderers.</NOTE>
A Mile from the City, buried like <HI>Diogenes</HI> with their Heels upwards,
stand a Row of Sepulchres of the <HI>Muttany,</HI> or <HI>Burfta's</HI> Pilgrims,
with the Soles of their Feet imprinted on the middle; some under a
Foursquare, others Round rising Tombs, by the side of a Tank, on
an ascending Mount.</P>
<P>A Mile and a half further is <HI>Pulparra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pulparra,</HI> an Heathen Se∣minary.</NOTE> a Town separated for the
<HI>Banyans</HI> to exercise their Funeral and Festival Rites. This is a Se∣minary
of their Heathen Doctors or <HI>Brachmins,</HI> many of whom
were in the River doing their Devotions, which consists in Washing
and Praying.</P>
<P>The Elder sate in a Row, where the Men and Women came down
together to wash, having <HI>Lungies</HI> about their Wastes only, which
before they put on, they select a <HI>Brachmin</HI> of their proper Cast to hold
their Vest; which they shift so cleaverly, that the quickest Eye can
discover nothing more than decent. At their coming up out of the
Water they bestow their Largess of Rice or Doll (an <HI>Indian</HI> Bean)
and the <HI>Brachmin</HI> his Benediction, by impressing a Mark answerable
to their Casts on their Forheads; which is the way they live, purely
on Benevolence.</P>
<P>Here they have Two Pagod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remaining,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Pagods of excellent Loam.</NOTE> but defaced by the
<HI>Moors:</HI> One of them, however, still shews a Crust of Plaster, with
Images Antick enough, but of excellent durance and splendour,
like Alabaster, made of a white Loam calcined, and then called
<HI>Arras;</HI> which they powder and steep in Water Three or Four Years
before it be fit for their purpose; the longer the better.</P>
<P>Here are many Monuments of their misled Zeal;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Burning of their Dead.</NOTE> the most dread∣ful
to remember, is an extraordinary one erected by the River side,
where they Burn their Dead, in Honour of a Woman who Burnt her
self with her dead Husband. Several Corps were Flaming in their Fu∣neral
Piles; which after the Fire has satisfied its self with, they cast
the Ashes up into the Air, and some upon the Water; that every
Element may have a share. Some of the Devoutest desire to ex∣pire
in this Water, giving in charge to their Relations to lay them
up to the Chin in it at the Article of Death.</P>
<P>Those whose Zeal transport them no farther than to die at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They carry them to <HI>Pul∣parra.</HI></NOTE>
are immediately Washed by the next of Kin, and bound up in a
Sheet; as many as go with him, carry him by turns on a Colt-staff;
and the rest run almost naked and shaved, crying after him, <HI>Ram,
Ram,</HI> making all the haste they can to <HI>Pulparra</HI> to Burn him; which
Fire is often very costly, being maintain'd with Wood of Aloes; some∣times
they expend some Thousands of Rupees. The Relations ex∣clude
themselves all Society till the time of Mourning be over;
the Women crying, <HI>O Si, O Si,</HI> beating their Breasts violently, and
expostulating the reason of their Departure, as if he had not a kind
Wife, loving Children, good Possessions, and the like: In the time
of this Mourning they bestow largely to redeem Creatures appointed
to Die, to excuse Oxen and <HI>Buffola</HI>'s from Labour, feeding them at
their own Charges, besides purchasing Milch Kine, and giving them
<PB N="102" REF="69"/>
to poor People, inviting them to Funeral Feasts, with other Lar∣gesses
to the <HI>Brachmins.</HI></P>
<P>Here are out acted all the boasted Austerities I ever heard of;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Postures and Severities of the Hea∣then <HI>Fakiers.</HI></NOTE> I
saw a <HI>Fakier</HI> of the <HI>Gentus,</HI> whose Nails by neglect were grown as
long as my Fingers, some piercing through the Flesh. Another
grave Old Man had a Turbat of his own Hair (which they all
Covet) Sun-burnt towards the ends, Grey nearer the roots, Plaited
like the <HI>Polonian Plica,</HI> but not so diseased, above Four Yards in
Length.</P>
<P>Others with their Arms Dislocated so, that the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the
Joints is Inverted, and the head of the Bone lies in the pit or valley
of the Arm; in which Case they are defrauded of their Nourishment,
and hang as useless Appendices to the Body; that unless relieved by
Charity, they are helpless in all Offices to themselves.</P>
<P>Others Fixing their Eyes upon Heaven, their Heads hanging over
their Shoulders, are uncapable of removing it from the Posture they
are in, being accustomed to that uninterrupted Rest, having con∣tracted
and stiffned the Tendons of the Muscles and Ligaments of the
Neck, that both those belonging to the Gullet, or the motion of
the Head, are unserviceable; insomuch that no Aliment, not Li∣quid,
can pass, and that too with much difficulty.</P>
<P>Others by continual Abstinence bring themselves into a strange
Emaciated habit of Body, that they seem only walking Skelitons.</P>
<P>All of them go Naked (some plump young lusty Fellows) ex∣cept
their Privities, and bedawb themselves over with Ashes; who
with their pleited Hair about their Heads, look like so many <HI>Maega∣ra</HI>'s;
these wait on the others. The Ancientest of them addict them∣selves
to Reading, they live Six or Eight together, as they please;
lie upon the Ground or a Matt, some of them in all Seasons abide
the open Air.</P>
<P>At another time a <HI>Gentu Fakier</HI> was enjoined for Forty days to en∣dure
the Purgatory of five Fires;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aunth Augy,</HI> or the Pe∣nance of Five Fires.</NOTE> there being a great resort by rea∣son
of a Festivity solemnized all that while; when I came early in
the Morning (invited by the novelty and incredibility of the thing)
he was Seated on a four-square Stage or Altar, with three Ascents,
some Two Feet high, and as many Feet square, ready to shew:
While he was in a musing posture, other <HI>Fakiers</HI> (whose Duty it is
daily to salute the Sun at his Height, Rising, and Setting, with their
Musick of long hollow Canes) blew them for an hour, or <HI>Ghong;</HI>
after which he fell to his Mattins, which he continued till the Sun
began to be warm; then rising he Blessed himself with Holy Water,
and threw himself along on the lowest square, still muttering to
himself on his Knees, he at length, with one Leg bowed upright
between his Thighs, rises on the other, telling his Beads (which
both <HI>Moormen</HI> and <HI>Gentus</HI> wear) which he had in his hands a quarter
longer, and stands, like a Goose, unmoved all the time; then cast∣ing
himself down, he exercised himself, as Wrastlers do here, very
briskly, but guarding the position of his Leg, which he kept so
fixed as if it had grown in that nature, as well when he rose as gro∣velled
on the ground; acting thus a quarter more, it had the
same operation as the <HI>Stork</HI>'s Bill used for a Suppository, for it
<PB N="103" REF="69"/>
brought him to a Stool; he taking his Purifying-pot in his hand,
marched on one side, where he tarried not long before he returning
took up his Beads he had left; and in this Interim four Fires being
kindled (any of them able to roast an Ox) at each Corner of the
upper and least Square, he having finished some Fopperies with his
Pot, <HI>Scaevola</HI>-like with his own hands he increased the Flames by ad∣ding
combustible Stuff as Incense to it; when removing from his
Neck a Collar of great Wooden Beads, he made a Coronet of them
for his Head; then bowing his Head in the middle of the Flames,
as it were to worship, holding the other Beads in his hands, with
his Head encircled between his Arms, his Face opposite to the Sun,
which is the fifth Fire, he mounted his Body with his Feet bolt up∣right,
and so continued standing on his Head the space of three hours
very steddily, that is, from Nine till Twelve; after which he seats
himself on his Breech cross-legg'd after their way of sitting, and re∣mains
so without either eating or drinking all the rest of the Day,
the Fires still nourished, and he sweating (being one of a good Ath∣letick
Habit, and of a Middle Age) as if basted in his own Grease.</P>
<P>This is imagined to be an Imposture;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether it be an Imposture,</NOTE> but if it be, it would make
a Man disbelieve his own Eyes: Others more rationally impute the
Heat from the Fires to be allayed by that overpowering one of the
Sun; which I cannot wholly incline to, since we daily when abroad
roast our Meat by Fires made in a clear Day without any shelter:
But I rather conceive Custom has inured his Body to it; for the very
Mountebank Tricks declare it a Practice; and the other I think as
feasible as to eat Fire, tread on Hot Irons, (which is here used), or
for Cooks to thrust their hands into scalding Water without Injury.</P>
<P>Another Devote had made a Vow not to lye down in Sixteen
Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Devote that had not sat down in six∣teen years.</NOTE> but to keep on his Feet all that while; this came accompa∣nied
with two others under the same Oath, the one had passed Five,
the other Three Years; all Three of them had their Legs swoln as
big as their Bodies, with filthy running Ulcers, exposed to view for
the greater Applause: Standing, they leaned on Pillows hung in a
String from the <HI>Banyan</HI> Tree, and had a Pompous Attendance of
such ragged <HI>Fakiers</HI> their Admirers, with Musick, Flags, and <HI>Mir∣chals:</HI>
The Eldest having undergone the compleat Term, to crown
all, was intombed in the same standing Posture Nine Days without
any sort of Food; and lest any Pretext of that kind might lessen his
Undertaking, he caused a Bank of Earth to be heaped on the Mouth
of his Cave, whereon was to be sown a certain Grain which ears in
Nine Days, which accordingly being done, eared before his being
taken thence. I saw him presently after his Resurrection, in great
State raised on a Throne under a Canopy, before which was a Fire
made in the Pit he had been, where he put his Hands, being anointed
with Oyl, untouch'd by the Flames: Which whether this may dis∣cover
the Cheat of both this and the other, that such an Unction
may be to resist Fire, Naturalists have not agreed in; and therefore
I judge this rather a Delusion, I having not been present at this Ex∣periment:
But that this is none I am assured, That the <HI>Banyans</HI> gave
him Divine Honours, and saluted him prostrate, offering before him
Rice, and throwing Incense into the Fire: He had a Red Trident in
<PB N="104" REF="70"/>
his hand, and is enrolled one of the Heroes or Demi-Gods in their
Superstitious Kalender.</P>
<P>From this place of <HI>Pulparra</HI> to <HI>Surat,</HI> a Row of Trees on each

<P>The only thing of Grandeur extant of the Devotion of the Anci∣ent

with which were it filled, the best Ship that swims in the Sea might
ride in it: It looks now more like a <HI>Circus</HI> or <HI>Gymnaseum,</HI> able enough

neighbouring <HI>Surat;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardens.</NOTE> the biggest of all is the Queen's, though some
Private Men have neater, where we often go to take the Air, and
feast in pleasant <HI>Choultries</HI> or Summer-Houses, spread after the <HI>Moors</HI>
manner with Carpets, refreshed with various Figures of the Rising
Water, out of several Spouts from square Tanks Pargetted. All the
time of our durance here Water is sprinkled, to mitigate the Fieriness
of the Sun.</P>
<P>Here are Grottoes descending also under Ground by huge Arches
and Stone Steps shaded by Trees on each hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grottoes.</NOTE> till it come to the
deep Well at bottom, from whence by Leathern Bags drawn upon
Wheels by Oxen, the Water is carried up, and in Gutters streams
about the Gardens.</P>
<P>In these by the help of a <HI>Brachmin</HI> skilled in Simples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cotton-Tree.</NOTE> I have found
the Silk Cotton-tree, distinguished by us from the Vulgar beneficial
one, by its being a Tree, the other a Shrub; it is most like a Maple
in Leaf and Branch, only the Bark is not furrowed; it brings forth
between three Leaves, first a Bud or Button, then a white Flower, last
of all Seed about which the Cotton grows, in three distinct Cells an∣swering
the three Leaves.</P>
<P>As also the Plant of which <HI>Bang</HI> is made;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bang.</NOTE> it grows as our Hemp, the
Juice of whose Seed ground in a Bowl like Mustard-seed, and
mixed with any other Liquor, is that they equivocate with their Pro∣phet
instead of the Grape; and that which follows agrees to what
Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> notes out of <HI>LOB in Ado: Lacustris aqua cui cannabis inta∣buerit
tantopere viro nocet, ut epotasit praesentissimo sitientibus veneno;</HI>
this with <HI>Dutry</HI> (as has been said) is the inebriating Confection of
the Post.</P>
<P>Here he discovered to me his beloved <HI>Alluh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alluh.</NOTE> the Bark of a Tree,
the present remedy against all manner of Fluxes.</P>
<P>Though these People delight much in Gardens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No great Va∣riety of Flow∣ers.</NOTE> yet are they but
rude, compared to ours of <HI>Europe;</HI> they make a noble Entrance, a
Banquetting-house in the middle eying the four Quarters of the Gar∣den,
beset with Trees like Wildernesses in every Quarter, or else
planted with <HI>Potatoes, Yawms, Berenjaws,</HI> both hot Plants, and their
<PB N="105" REF="70"/>
Coolers, as <HI>Pompkins, Cucumbers, Gourds,</HI> and such like; they are
only divided by Gravelly Walks and Water-courses; not curiously
adorned with Flowers; <HI>Bismalvas</HI> and some Wall-flowers or <HI>Stock-Gillyflowers</HI>
being the height of what they aim at: Only the <HI>Culga,</HI>
so famed for the Silk, in imitation of its Paint, I take it for our <HI>Ama∣rillis;</HI>
and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the Tree <HI>Mallow,</HI> which is red as Scarlet
in the Morning, and at Noon faints into a pale Colour, and towards
the Evening is pure white; some few <HI>Lysimachias,</HI> which besides their
several sorts of <HI>Jessamins,</HI> is all the choice: Roses would grow here
if they would but cultivate them.</P>
<P>A Mile from the City grows the humble Sensitive Plant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sensible Plant and <HI>Ar∣bor de Rais.</HI></NOTE> common
in the Fields; <HI>Eastward</HI> of <HI>Surat,</HI> two Courses, <HI>i. e.</HI> a League, we
pitched our Tent under a Tree, that besides its Leafs, the Branches
bear its own Roots, therefore called by the <HI>Portugals, Arbor de Rais:</HI>
For the Adoration the <HI>Banyans</HI> pay it, the <HI>Banyan Tree</HI> (by whom it
is held as sacred as the Oak to our Old <HI>Druids</HI>); who paint it daily,
and make Offerings of Rice, and pray to it: It has Leafs like an
<HI>Ivy,</HI> and is the same with that at <HI>Johanna,</HI> only that was incorporated
into one Body, and this by often taking Root is capable of overspread∣ing
a whole Field, so that it is said there are of them able to shade
an Army of 30000 Horse and Men singly; however it is possible to
be so contrived, if it be lookt after, to make a Wood alone of
it self.</P>
<P>The Hedges and Lanes are chiefly set with two sorts of Bushes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Milk Bushes.</NOTE>
called by us Milk-Trees, because of a succulent Juice like <HI>Spurge,</HI>
white, and of the consistency of the best Milk; but if it comes near
the Skin or Eyes it is not so benign, according to the Experience of the
Famous <HI>Verulam,</HI> [<HI>Nat. Hist. Cent. 7. Exp. 39. Omnem succum lacti si∣milem
ex plantis incisis acrem esse.</HI>] and my Observation here; for if
by chance it stick upon any part of the Body, it frets like an <HI>Escaro∣tick;</HI>
and I have seen an unruly Horse, rushing through it, both blind
himself and Rider, both their Heads being swoln to an extraordinary
bigness. I believe it to be a kind of <HI>Tithymal, quod tenerum lac non secus
ac Manna effundit;</HI> the first sort of which has broader and jucier
Leafs, and has four or five together; not jagged, but somewhat oval,
a Finger's length, and half as broad; one only thick Stalk arises
from the Root, and several Branches proceed from thence; they are
all Green and Tender, springing up a Man's height, full of Prickles as
our <HI>Carduus,</HI> of whose Milk inspissated is made <HI>Euphorbium.</HI> The
other grows up into the Body of a Tree, and is Woody; above
which it sends forth several tender smooth Stalks, which sprout out
into Boughs seeming almost naked, because its Leafs are small, and
come out at its Joints, sometimes singly; it is most like a Privet, very
quick of Growth, and each of them make good Fences. The
Goats despise it not, feeding, though very cautiously, on the Leafs
and Branches of the latter, when the Heats have parched up the
Grass and other Plants.</P>
<P>Before we leave the pleasant Fields for the dusty stinking Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sugar-Canes and Tobacco.</NOTE>
Sugar-Canes and Tobacco would deserve our Remark, which are
both plentifully thriving here; had not these been already the Subject
of other Pens.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="71"/>
The next diverting Prospect must be that of the River; it glides
by the Town in swift Tides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River commodious for their Ships.</NOTE> and at Spring-Tides (which it would
always do, were they industrious to keep it in its Banks) it bears
Ships of 1000 Tun Burthen up to <HI>Surat</HI> Walls; but they unlade first,
because of the Sands, occasioned by their Sloth. They lye very thick
a Mile together, and scattering down to the River's Mouth, reckon∣ing
more than an Hundred Sail of good Ships, besides small Vessels:
For all which they were beholden to the Poverty of some <HI>English</HI>
Shipwrights, the first of whom received the deserved Reward of his
Officiousness (being <HI>Scutica dignus</HI>) from the <HI>Moors,</HI> who appre∣hending
him stealing Customs, <HI>Chawbucked</HI> him handsomly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> never permit the Natives to be taught any Eminent Art
whereby they may become their Competitors:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> teach the Na∣tives nothing.</NOTE> Nor is it, I think, bet∣ter
Policy to instruct them in any beneficial Science, as that of Na∣vigation,
no more than one would an Adversary how to use his Wea∣pons;
which these, had they equal Courage to their other Advanta∣ges
of Strength and Nature, might easily thereby turn the Points
of their Weapons upon us.</P>
<P>But for all these great Preparations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Navy.</NOTE> as yet they dare not venture
out without <HI>Europe</HI> Passes, or Pilots; though some of their Ships
carry 30 or 40 Pieces of Cannon, more for Shew than Service. Be∣sides
these Merchant-Men, here are Three or Four Men of War
as big as Third Rate Ships: The other are Frigats fit to Row or Sail,
made with Prows instead of Beaks, more useful in Rivers and Creeks,
than in the Main. The Emperor also has four great Ships in Pay al∣ways,
to carry Pilgrims to <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>echa</HI> on free Cost, and bring them back
from <HI>Hodge,</HI> where they prove a Crew of sanctified Varlets.</P>
<P>The Heir of <HI>Bantam</HI> is now here to take his Passage thither in one
of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The young King of <HI>Ban∣tam.</HI></NOTE> with his Retinue, which are some of the <HI>Pengrims</HI> or Lords
of the Country, his Unkle and others, which were about Twenty,
with their Wives: He was first at <HI>Bombaim,</HI> where he was entertain∣ed
like a Prince, for the Obligation the Company have to their Trade
there, he having been disobedient to the King his Father, and has
not yet-shewed any kindness to the <HI>English,</HI> siding rather with the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Interest to undermine the Old King, and settle them in the
Pepper-trade, which afterwards will not be in his Power to redeem
out of their hands: Here little notice is taken of him, they all being
in miserable poor Habits, and he of little Credit, being a Giddyhead,
were it not for the <HI>English</HI> Captain that brought him, a Confident of
the Old King's, who furnishes him with Money but sparingly, he
being indiscreet in his Expences. He is of the <HI>Java</HI> Extraction,
short of Stature, broad-fac'd, little Eyes, and less Beard, a mere
Boy; the rest wear their Beards like the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which is compa∣ratively
like a Cat's; their Heads shaved, covered only with Skull-Caps
of Knit-Work, their Upper-Garments loose like a Frock:
When they appear before him, they prostrate themselves along,
then rising up with Respect, sit crouching on their Heels: Their
Women were covered with dark Blue Sheets.</P>
<P>The Old King had retired from the Cares of Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Story.</NOTE> and com∣mitted
all to this his Son; but the <HI>Pengrims</HI> soon tired with his exor∣bitant
Sway, made Intercession for the Old King's reassuming his Au∣thority;
<PB N="107" REF="71"/>
whereupon this Voyage was framed as an Expedient to set∣tle
his Mad Temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. III.</NOTE> being intrusted to the sober Conduct of the
King's Brother.</P>
<P>These Vessels that are for this Voyage are huge unshapen things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Junks, and</NOTE>
and bear both the Name and Model of their old Junks: They return
usually very Rich, and are at their Arrival adorned most abundantly
with Streamers. Their way of Salutes are with Even, as ours with
Odd Guns.</P>
<P>The Seamen and Soldiers differ only in a Vowel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seamen.</NOTE> the one being

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Solemnities, Sports and Pastimes; their Marriages; of the
Parseys, their Strength by Land and Sea, their abundant
Wealth, and Fitness for Trade.</HEAD>
<P>AND now having entertained you thus far, I shall continue to
you the Circumstantial or Accidental Shews, together with
their Sports and Exercises.</P>
<P>The first depends on the New Moon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their New Moons.</NOTE> when, all Malice apart, the
<HI>Moors</HI> embrace one another, and at the sight thereof make a Jubilee,
by firing of Guns, blowing of Trumpets, Feasting and Praying ve∣ry
devoutly.</P>
<P>The next is the Day of the Week observed for the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s
Advancement to the Throne; which is not so generally kept, only
by the Soldiers and Officers.</P>
<P>But that which affects them all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramazan <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Lent.</NOTE> is at the end of their <HI>Ramazan</HI> or
<HI>Lent,</HI> which is always the first New Moon in <HI>November;</HI> which as
it is observed with the greatest Strictness, not swallowing their Spittle
all the Day of its Continuance, so is it celebrated when it concludes,
with the highest Expression of Joy and Solemnity.</P>
<P>The Governor goes in Procession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grandeur of their Gover∣nor and Great Men.</NOTE> and bestows his Largess in his
Passage to the Chief Place of Devotion, liberally scattering Rupees
as Kings do Medals at their Coronations, waited on by all the Gal∣lants
of the Town: His Son first leading a Body of Horse of the
Cavalry of the City; himself beginning the first File on the Left∣hand,
the place of highest Honour, it was as deep as the Street
would admit, observing no Rank: After whom followed the <HI>Cazy,</HI> with
Green Banners, with a Band of Foot of 100 Men; then the Cu∣stomer
with his Men and Colours, both carried in <HI>Palenkeens;</HI> whom
followed the <HI>Mullahs</HI> and Merchants, without any distinction, some
in Coaches, others in <HI>Palenkeens,</HI> with their large Troops of Serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tors:
Then five Elephants in Armour, with Banners supported by
those that were in their Seats, capable of a dozen Sitters; they ma∣nage
them by one Rider sitting near his Neck, with an Iron Instru∣ment
<PB N="108" REF="72"/>
a Cubit in length, the Point bended downwards as long as a
Finger, ascribed by <HI>Livy</HI> to the Invention of that famous Leader's
Brother <HI>Asdrubal,</HI> who seeing these Creatures of great Terror to
the Enemy, but if taking an heedless Course were as liable to damage
Friend as Foe, found out this Remedy; delivering a Graver to their
Masters with an Hammer, ordered them to strike it with their main
strength on the Juncture where their Head was fastned to their Neck,
if they were unruly, whereby the great Bulk fell to the Ground.
<HI>Magister fabrile scalprum, cum malleo inter aures positum, ipsâ in com∣page
quâ jungitur capiti cervix, quanto maximo poterat ictu adigebat,</HI>
But afterwards they learned by striking on the Vertebra's of the Neck,
to rule them; which Custom I see here maintained. After these
came a Dozen Leopards on State-<HI>Hackeries</HI> with their Keepers, who
train them up to hunting. At convenient distances the Trumpets
sounded, and Camels of War with <HI>Patereroes</HI> on their Saddles,
marched with a Pace laborious to the Guiders, giving them a Dis∣ease
not much different from a <HI>Gonorrhea.</HI> Here nothing was seen
but Banners and Streamers, nor heard but Kettle-Drums and Trum∣pets;
after which followed the Governor in the middle of a Troop
of Soldiers, all in Coats-of Mail and Headpieces, armed at all Points,
both themselves and Horses; himself mounted on a little She-Ele∣phant,
with all the Trappings and Accoutrements of State. <HI>Et ad
morem antiquum quo puberes filii &amp; jam in virili togâ, comitabantur tri∣umphantem
patrem, quod etiam ex Livio appareat de Paulo loquente.</HI>
Two or three Striplings (his own Children) rode smiling with him,
who were very White respectively; the Governor himself being a
<HI>Mogul,</HI> which is as much as <HI>Suffet</HI> in <HI>Arabic,</HI> from whence the <HI>Per∣sian</HI>
Emperor is called <HI>Suffee</HI> and this, <HI>Mogul,</HI> as being derived from
the same Parent; as also are all those descended from them. In this
State he rode to a Place set apart for this Day's Solemnity, out of
the Walls, to the Queen's Garden-Gate, before which it stands,
where after Prayers he receives the Compliments of the Grandees,
and returns to Feast.</P>
<P>At this time the Walls of the City, and Towers of the Castle,
wanted not their Adornments, being bestuck with bloody Ensigns,
and smoking with Guns of Jubilee, as well as tooting with their
Trumpets, and beating with their Drums; as the <HI>Jews</HI> on their
Sabbaths, or their solemn Feast days were wont.</P>
<P>The New Moon before the New Year (which commences at
the <HI>Vernal Equinox</HI>) is the <HI>Moors Aede,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Moors Aede.</NOTE> when the Governor in no
less Pomp than before, goes to sacrifice a Ram or He-Goat, in re∣membrance
of that offered for <HI>Isaac</HI> (by them called <HI>Ishauh</HI>); the
like does every one in his own House, that is able to purchase one,
and sprinkle their Blood on the sides of their Doors.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Moors</HI> solemnize the Exequies of <HI>Hosseen Gos∣seen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mourn∣ing for <HI>Hosseen Gosseen.</HI></NOTE>
a time of ten days Mourning for two Unfortunate Champions
of theirs, who perished by Thirst in the Deserts, fighting against
the Christians: Wherefore every Corner of the Street is supplied
with Jars of Water; and they run up and down like Furies in quest
of these two Brethren, laying about with Swords, Clubs, and
Staves, crying with that earnestness upon their Names, and dancing
<PB N="109" REF="72"/>
in such Antick Dances as resemble the <HI>Pyrrhical</HI> Saltation. <HI>Haec Ce∣lebratio
non omnino dissimilis ei generi exerceri solita à juvenibus armatis
Lacedemoniae cum Patris Achillis rogum celebraret;</HI> that a sober Man
could make no other judgment on them, than that they were di∣stracted.
This is done through the Streets, where if two Compa∣nies
encounter, they seldom part without bloody Noses; which Oc∣casion
being given like <HI>Esau</HI>'s Intentions on the Day of his Father's
Lamentation, to revenge himself on his Brother <HI>Jacob,</HI> has been the
Cause why the <HI>Mogul</HI> has restrained it for the prevention of Out∣rages;
but yet his Mandate is not so valid to make them forsake it
here: After Sun-set they eat, and fall to singing the Psalms of <HI>Doud,</HI>
or <HI>David,</HI> in the most consonant Tone I have heard.</P>
<P>The last Day they prepare a couple of Coffins, and have a Man or
two on Horseback all bestuck like our Man in the Almanack, with
Arrows; these ride reeling, and ready to drop off their Horses for
Faintness, till they come to the River, where they put the Coffins
afloat with a loud Cry, and then returning, repeat with great Vene∣ration
their Names, and after this trim their Beards, wash and shift
their Cloaths, (all this while worn negligently, as Mourners) and re∣turn
to their more beastly Vomit of Luxury, than this of more than
Manly Fury.</P>
<P>This Religious Bigot of an Emperor <HI>Auren Zeeb,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperor a great Zealot for his Reli∣gion.</NOTE> seeks not to sup∣press
it utterly, but to reduce the Celebration, to preserve their Me∣mories
by a pious Respect, suitable to the Gravity of the <HI>Moors:</HI> For,
says he, hereby Opportunity is offered to the <HI>Cophers</HI> (Unbelievers)
to think <HI>Musslemen</HI> favour the Lewd Worship of the Heathens;
which is not only a Scandal to the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, but an En∣couragement
to the Enemies thereof to persist in their own, whilst
such Licentiousness is connived at in that which should be set as a
Pattern for them to imitate: For even at this instant he is on a Project
to bring them all over to his Faith, and has already begun by two se∣veral
Taxes or Polls, very severe ones, especially upon the <HI>Brachmins,</HI>
making them pay a Gold <HI>Rupee</HI> an Head, and the inferior Tribes
proportionable; which has made some <HI>Rajahs</HI> revolt, and here they
begin to fly to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Countries, and <HI>Bombaim;</HI> though should
they make a joint Resistance they are a thousand to one more than
the <HI>Moguls</HI> can with an unanimous Contrivance fairly muster.</P>
<P>On an Eclipse of the Sun or Moon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they be∣have them∣selves in E∣clipses.</NOTE> the <HI>Moors</HI> are in a lamentable
Plight, making a great Noise with Pots and Pans, and other noisy
Instruments; not omitting their Prayers, fancying them prevalent
to deliver them from their Travel. When the Heathens, instructed
by their <HI>Brachmins,</HI> by a better Philosophy, declare to them the Day
before the two great Luminaries are obscured by the Interposition
of the Moon's, or Earth's Globe, that they may Fast, Wash, and
Purify themselves for Twenty four Hours before the Eclipse happens,
and all the time of its lasting; after which is past, they feast and
bestow their Benevolence freely on the <HI>Brachmins,</HI> holding them for
this their profound Knowledge, in mighty Admiration.</P>
<P>And though the Jollity and Pomp of the Heathens is much al∣layed
by the Puritanism and unlimited Power of the <HI>Moors,</HI> inso∣much
that they are wholly forbidden to Burn their Wives with the
<PB N="110" REF="73"/>
Husbands; yet must not the <HI>Indians</HI> be totally denied their Feasts,
and chiefly that of their publick Nuptials, which comes in twice a
Year; as the <HI>Atticks</HI> in their <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in <HI>January</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> so
these in the Months <HI>Fulgannau</HI> and <HI>Puxu,</HI> in <HI>January</HI> and <HI>March;</HI> to
enjoy which times of Festivity, the Governor expects large Gratui∣ties,
which they collect as every one can afford; All which times
they make Processions, and appear, (especially the Children and
young Folks) in rich Dresses of Gold and Silver, Mitres on their
Heads, and weighty Sashes about their Middles, bedawbed and
stained all over with Saffron Colour; the Married Folks riding on
Horseback, <HI>Palenkeens,</HI> and Coaches, splendidly adorned, drawn
by Oxen, Goats, and Elks, Painted over with Saffron, their Horns
tipped with Silver; Musick, Streamers, and Banners going before
them, the Women Singing <HI>Epithalamiums,</HI> the Men, following, and
a great Attendance with Pageants, <HI>Mirchals,</HI> and <HI>Kitsols,</HI> giving
<HI>Pawn</HI> and Coco-Nuts frankly, as they pass.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies after Washing and Cleansing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies in Marriage.</NOTE> conclude by their
Sitting Two Hours Tied by the Neck, while the Priest Prays, the
Woman being then Manacled with Gold or Silver Shackles about her
Wrists and Ankles, a white Sheet being held over them Unvailed, a
Coco Nut exchanged to confirm the Bargain, and Corn scattered upon
them; all Emblems of the Matrimonial Bands, Chastity and a firm
resolution to comply with one anothers Fortunes; and then dismis∣ses
them, by sprinkling Water on the Married Couple, that they
may Increase and Multiply. The Women are never Married more
than once, the Men are under no such Obligation.</P>
<P>The first New Moon in <HI>October,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dually</HI> of the Heathen.</NOTE> is the <HI>Banyans Dually,</HI> a great
Day of Celebration to their <HI>Pagan</HI> Deities, when they are very kind∣hearted,
presenting their Masters with Gifts, as knowing they
shall be no Losers, and Entertain one another with mutual Mirth and
Banquetting.</P>
<P>The next Moon their Women flock to the Sacred Wells;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women, have a time of Freedom.</NOTE> where,
they say, it is not difficult to persuade them to be kind, supposing
their Pollutions not to remain after their Washing in these Holy
Waters.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> begins with a Licentious Week of Sports and Rejoycing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feast of Flies.</NOTE>
wherein they are not wanting for Lascivious Discourse, nor are they
to be offended at any Jest or Waggery. And to shew their Benefi∣cence
at the beginning of the Rains, they Treat the Ants and
Flies with Sweatmeats and Wafers, studiously setting Hony, Syrups,
or any thing that may entice them to their own death, out of their
way; allowing them Sugar, or any other dried Confects for their
Repast, instead of them.</P>
<P>They are constant Benefactors to the Dogs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hospitable to Dogs.</NOTE> which are many, the
Bitches littering in the Streets; but avoid touching them, as they
would an <HI>Holencore,</HI> whom if their Garments chance to brush, they
hie them home, Shift, and Wash.</P>
<P>And now we enter upon the <HI>Agonalia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Exerci∣ses, or Recre∣ations.</NOTE> first of the <HI>Moors:</HI> They
love to outdo one another in Feats of Activity, as Riding full speed,
and to stop with a Jerk, or motion of the Body, their Horses be∣ing
well managed; Tilting and <HI>Greeding,</HI> that is, Casting of
<PB REF="73"/>

<PB REF="74"/>
<PB N="111" REF="74"/>
Darts, both for Utility and Recreation; Shooting with Bows and
Arrows, which is near at hand, not far off, as we at Rovers; Running
on Foot, which belongs to the <HI>Pattamars,</HI> the only Foot-posts of this
Country, who Run so many Courses every Morning, or else Dance so
many hours to a Tune called the <HI>Patamars</HI> Tune, when they labour
as much as a <HI>Lancashire</HI> Man does at <HI>Roger of Coverly,</HI> or the <HI>Taran∣tula</HI>
of their Hornpipe; these wear Feathers in their Turbats.</P>
<P>The Wrestlers Anoint with Oil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wrestling.</NOTE> and are Naked, only a Belt about
their Wastes, in which they weary one another only by pure
Strength and Luctation, not by Skill or Circumvention; these two
last use Opium to make them perform things beyond their strength;
and it is incredible to think how far these will Travel before the vir∣tue
of it be worked off.</P>
<P>Hunting of Tigers is sometimes a Pastime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting.</NOTE> at others a Tragy-Co∣medy;
for besetting a Wood where Tigers lurk, with Men and Hor∣ses,
and putting a Set of their loud Musick to strike up in the middle
of it; they rouze at the unaccustomed Noize, and rushing forth seize
the first in their way, if not Shot or Launced, to prevent them:
Wild Bulls and <HI>Buffola</HI>'s are as dangerous, nor is the Boar less fierce
than any of them.</P>
<P><HI>Antilopes</HI> are set upon by Leopards on this wise; they carry the Leo∣pards
on <HI>Hackeries,</HI> both for less suspicion, and to give them the advan∣tage
of their Spring; which if they lose, they follow not their Prey, be∣ing
for a surprize; wherefore the <HI>Hackeries</HI> wheel about at a distance,
till they come near enough to apprehend them, they feeding fearless
of the <HI>Hackeries;</HI> then with three or four Leaps, after a small Chace,
seize them, and easily become their Masters.</P>
<P>The Great Men have <HI>Persian</HI> Greyhounds, which they Cloathe in
Cold Weather, and some few <HI>Hawks;</HI> a <HI>Colum</HI> may be Hunted with
a Greyhound, as we do Bustards, being a great Fowl and long in
Rising.</P>
<P><HI>Buffola</HI>'s animated by their Keepers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Buffola</HI>'s and <HI>Rams</HI> set to Fight.</NOTE> fight with great fury; their
Horns, being reversed, are useless; but they knock Foreheads with a
force adequate to such great Engines, till they are all of a gore, and
follow their blow with such vigour, that the strength of their Backs
exert themselves into their Natural Parts, which they brandish as if
stimulated to Venery; the stronger will hardly permit the weaker
to go back to return with his force, but pressing on him, endeavours
to bear him down; thus foiling one another, they are a long time
before they will yield.</P>
<P><HI>Persian</HI> Rams set together in this manner, are not parted without
a bloody Catastrophe, which are kept on purpose for the sport of
their Great Men; as likewise are Elephants, who engage at the
Will of their Masters.</P>
<P>Here are no Gladiators, but at Cudgels they will play as at Back∣sword,
till they warm one another.</P>
<P>The chief Pleasure of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Master∣piece of the <HI>Banyans.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Banyans,</HI> is to Cheat one
another, conceiving therein the highest Felicity, though it be
Cuckolding, which they are expert at. They will play at Chess,

teaches the Children first their Letters or Cyphers on the Ground, by
writing on the Dust with their Fingers, which is their Primer;
where when they are perfect, they are allowed a Board plastered over,
which with Cotton they wipe out, when full, as we do from Slates

<P>The <HI>Moors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sloth of the <HI>Moors</HI> a whet to the <HI>Banyans.</HI></NOTE> who are by Nature slothful, will not take pains; being

<P>In <HI>February</HI> the <HI>Bussorah</HI> Ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All the World brings Trea∣sure to <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> and in <HI>August</HI> the <HI>Juddah</HI> Fleet

vast quantities of <HI>Indico, Cotton, Cotton-Yarn,</HI> and <HI>Silks;</HI> and vend
them to the <HI>Caphalay,</HI> waiting on them over-land; so that returning,
they are forced to ballast their Ships with <HI>Dates, Persian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI>
Drugs; and freight with Horses from each Place: But the main is
brought back in Gold, Silver and Pearl, which does in a manner
center here: For though it circulates all the World over, yet here
it is hoorded, <HI>Regis ad exemplum,</HI> both by King and People, he having
Tanks thereof unsealed for many Ages, and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> hide it for
Eternity. So that though it be not of the growth of this Country,
yet the innate Thrift of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and the small occasion of Fo∣reign
Expences, and this humour of laying up their Talent in a Nap∣kin,
buries the greatest part of the Treasure of the World in <HI>India:</HI>
There being a far greater urgency for Cloathing, than that of Super∣fluity;
which is the Spice-Trade of the <HI>South Seas,</HI> which only pays
for what it carries off here, all the rest loading their Beasts without
the Money returned in their Sacks Mouths; and for all that the

by the Trade of the Bay, and a great deal more consumed there for
their fine Cloath.</P>

who being Governor in <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> for the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> grew
powerful, and was therefore suspected; which drew the Forces of
the <HI>Sultan</HI> his Master upon him; but knowing the Sea open, he sues
to the <HI>Mogul</HI> for Protection, who promised not only to receive him,
but imploy him honourably; and as a Testimony of his sincere In∣tentions,

<P>The Trade of Jewellers is no small addition to the Profit of this

apart, both for yours and my own satisfaction, together with a ge∣neral
Collection of Coins and Weights, as time and opportunity
shall make me better acquainted: In the mean time, telling you what
I saw at the House of an <HI>Hindu</HI> that wrought in Coral, where was
to be wondred the Tools he worked with, more than his Art, because
we see it surpassed in <HI>Europe;</HI> but with far more invention of Instru∣ments:
Here Hands and Feet being all the Vice, and the other Tools
unshapen bits of Iron: From whence I went the same day to a <HI>Moor∣man</HI>
that cuts all sorts of Stones, except Diamonds, with a certain
Wheel made of Lacre and Stone ground and incorporated, only to
be had at <HI>Cochin,</HI> and there the Name is known.</P>
<P>They cut Diamonds with a Mill turned by Men, the String reach∣ing,
in manner of our Cutlers Wheels, to lesser that are in a flat
Press, where under Steel-wheels the Diamonds are fastned; and
with its own Bort are worn into what Cut the Artist pleases: These
are sold most in the Country, they coming short of the <HI>Fringies</HI> in
Fancy; wherefore they are sent rough into <HI>Europe,</HI> where they are
both set and cut to more advantage.</P>
<P>A <HI>Banyan</HI> that seemingly is not worth a <HI>Gosbeek</HI> (the lowest Coin
they have) shall pull out of his <HI>Puckery</HI> some thousand Pounds∣worth

<P>This City is very nasty by their want of Privies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City kept nastily.</NOTE> and their ma∣king

more healthy than Moist, it hastening Digestion, and facilitating
Excretion, when no Fevers that are treacherous root themselves in a
deep Putrefaction. About the Variable Months they are miserably
afflicted with Coughs and Catarrhs, Tumors of the Mouth and
Throat, Rheumatisms, and intermitting Fevers; Also Small Pox
invades the Youth, as in all <HI>India,</HI> so here: In the extreme Heats,
<HI>Cholera Morbus,</HI> Inflammations of the Eyes by Dust and the fiery Tem∣per
of the Air: In the Rains, Fluxes, Apoplexies, and all Distempers
of the Brain, as well as Stomach; to correct which, the Natives eat
<HI>Hing,</HI> a sort of liquid <HI>Assa Foetida,</HI> whereby they smell odiously.
For all Lethargick Fits they use Garlick and Ginger, given in Oyl
or Butter.</P>
<P>To Cup they use <HI>Ventosoes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remedies out∣ward and in∣ward.</NOTE> without Scarifications. They have
good Escaroticks and Vesicatories, made by a certain Nut, the same
they chop or mark their Calicuts black with instead of Ink.</P>
<P>They apply Cauteries most unmercifully in a <HI>Mordisheen,</HI> called
so by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> being a Vomiting with a Loosness; the like is
done in a Calenture.</P>
<P>Physick here is now as in former days, open to all Pretenders; here
being no Bars of Authority, or formal Graduation, Examination or
Proof of their Proficiency; but every one ventures, and every one suf∣fers;
and those that are most skilled, have it by Tradition, or former Ex∣perience
descending in their Families; not considering either altera∣tion
of Tempers or Seasons, but what succeeded well to one, they
apply to all.</P>
<P>In Fevers their Method is to prescribe Coolers, till they have ex∣tinguished the Vital Heat; and if the Patients are so robust to con∣quer
the Remedies used to quench the Flame of the Acute Disease,
yet are they left labouring under Chronical ones, as Dropsy, Jaun∣dice,
and Ill Habits, a long while before they recover their Pri∣stine
Heat.</P>
<P>They are unskill'd in Anatomy, even those of the <HI>Moors</HI> who fol∣low
the <HI>Arabians,</HI> thinking it unlawful to dissect Human Bodies;
whereupon Phlebotomy is not understood, they being ignorant how
the Veins lye; but they will worry themselves Martyrs to death by
Leeches, clapping on an hundred at once, which they know not how
to pull off, till they have filled themselves, and drop of their own
accord.</P>
<P>Chirurgery is in as bad a plight, Amputation being an horrid
thing: Yet I confess it is strange to see, that what Nature will effect
on such Bodies, Intemperance has not debauch'd.</P>
<P>Pharmacy is in no better condition; Apothecaries here being no
more than Perfumers or Druggists, at best; for he that has the bold∣ness
to practise, makes up his own Medicines, which are generally
such Draughts, that if their own Energy work not, yet the very
Weight must force an Operation.</P>
<P>They pretend to understand the Pulse, but the Urine they will
not look on.</P>
<P>I have seen a Barber undertake the Cure of a Bloody Flux, by
pretending the Guts were displaced, and laying the Patient on his
Back, and gently tickling his Reins, thrust on each side the <HI>Abdo∣men</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="76"/>
with all his strength; then placing a Pot filled with dried Earth,
like that of <HI>Samos,</HI> upon his Navel, he made it fast by a Ligature;
and on some Bodies thus treated he had gained Credit, but this died.
<HI>Prosper Alpinus</HI> mentions something like this among the <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>Here they will submit to Spells and Charms, and the Advice of

<P>Here is a <HI>Brachmin</HI> Doctor who has raised a good Fortune; they
pretend to no Fees, but make them pay in their Physick; and think
it Honour enough if you favour them with the Title of your Phy∣sician

<P>This <HI>Brachmin</HI> comes every day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Country Physician.</NOTE> and feels every Man's Pulse in the
Factory, and is often made use of for a Powder for Agues, which
works as infallibly as the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark; it is a Preparation of Na∣tural
<HI>Cinnaber.</HI> Midwifry is in esteem among the Rich and Lazy
only; the Poorer, while they are labouring or planting, go aside as

in a Clout or Hammock, and return to work again.</P>

but the better, because our Naval Power curbs them; otherwise
they being prone to be imperious, would subjugate us, as they do all
others that are harness'd with the Apron-strings of Trade: Suppo∣sing
us then to bear the Face of Ministers of State, as well as the sly
Visage of Mechanicks, they depose something of their Ferity, and
treat with us in a more favourable Stile; giving us the Preference
before others here resident, and look on us with the same Aspect as
they do on their great <HI>Ombrahs.</HI></P>
<P>In Town there are many private Merchants that bear a Port equal

yet dare not assume that Liberty allowed us: We fortify our

with a dark Grey upon a White Ground, upon the Back direct, in
other Parts waving towards their length: As also Pigeons tumbling
in the Air, attributed to the Indisposition of their Brain; but to me
it appears a voluntary Action, they not falling at all upon it, but
after three or four Turns would fly, and repeat it as often as they
listed, without any interruption in their Course, and when they seem∣ed
to direct themselves to any place, without any Inclination to it, as
an Irregularity, but rather out of Affectation; which notwith∣standing
cannot be taught any, but only those of this kind; no more
than any other besides Carriers, (which were here with blubber'd
Noses, and of a Brown Colour) to carry Letters: Others walked
on the Ground, with their Breasts bearing out, and the Feathers of
their Tails spreading like Turkies, bridling their Heads so that they
were even with their Rumps; this also is a peculiar Species, and not
Artificial; they propagate their own kind, and are of a pied Colour.</P>
<P>From <HI>Siam</HI> are brought hither little <HI>Champore</HI> Cocks with ruffed
Feet, well armed with Spurs, which have a strutting Gate with
them, the truest mettled in the World; they are generally White,
with an Eye of Yellow. Here were Milk-White Turtles from <HI>Bus∣sorah,
Cockatooas</HI> and <HI>Newries</HI> from <HI>Bantam,</HI> as also a <HI>Cassawar</HI> that
digests Iron.</P>
<P>From <HI>Amidavad</HI> small Birds, who, besides that they are spotted
with White and Red no bigger than Measles, the principal Chorister
beginning, the rest in Consort, Fifty in a Cage, make an admirable
Chorus.</P>
<P>And also for Vermin, the strongest huge Rats, as big as our Pigs,
which burrow under the Houses, and are bold enough to venture on
Poultry, and make them their Prey: A <HI>Mongoose</HI> is a-kin to a Ferret:
Spuirrels delicately streaked White and Black, run about the House,
and on top of Terrasses. Musk-Rats of the same Colour, short∣feeted,
but a Span in length, their Bodies no thicker than a Mouse;
they infest the Houses and Water-Jars with their Scent; from which
last all Care is taken to preserve them. <HI>Guiana,</HI> a Creature like a Cro∣codile,
which Robbers use to lay hold on by their Tails when they
clamber Houses.</P>
<P>For Insects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Venomous Creatures.</NOTE> <HI>Centipedes,</HI> Scorpions, and vast Spiders; these lye
perdue, and often set upon People unawares; for the Venom of the
two former, they have Oyl made of each; the first is the worst, and
often deadly; the other works off after a burning Fit of Four and
twenty hours. Abroad in the Fields and Rivers are poysonous
Snakes; and here was lately a Woman, as she went to fetch Water
at the River, devoured by an Aligator or Crocodile, though the
<HI>Brachmins</HI> pretend to Charm them that they shall do no Mischief in
this their Sacred River; and this was given out to be a Judgment
not otherwise to be expiated.</P>
<P>And now the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet being arrived at the River's Mouth
(after having demolished the City St. <HI>Thomas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Surat</HI> Go∣vernor forced to comply with the <HI>Dutch.</HI></NOTE> near <HI>Fort St. George,</HI>
the <HI>French</HI> yielding on Discretion), they restored us the Prisoners
taken in the Engagement, having treated them very civilly: And
the Governor was forced to go from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Swally</HI> (to the <HI>Dutch</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="77"/>
Commodore, removed thither) to intreat an Agreement; the Cla∣mours
of the Merchants being instant, the <HI>Bussorah</HI> Fleet was in
jeopardy, which they threatned to seize; but on his Appearance,
and Assurance of Satisfaction, all was salved. Lest therefore this
should be judged too mean a Compliance, he paid a Visit with all
his Pomp to our Deputy-President, still at <HI>Swally,</HI> though the <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
Ships were gone, others from the <HI>South</HI>-Seas being expected.</P>
<P>Thus repassing the River after this Great Man, in order to repair
aboard Ship, I beheld whole Droves of all Sexes and Ages coming
to wash in the River, which is done twice a day; and the Finest
Dames of the <HI>Gentues</HI> disdained not to carry Water on their heads,
with sometimes two or three Earthen Pots over one another for
Houshold service; the like do all the Women of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>On this side the Water are People of another Off-spring than
those we have yet mentioned;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Parseys.</HI></NOTE> these be called <HI>Parseys,</HI> who were
made free Denizens by the <HI>Indians</HI> before the <HI>Moors</HI> were Masters,
and have continued to Inhabit where they first set Footing, not being
known above Forty Miles along the Sea-coast, nor above Twenty
Mile Inland. It is likely these upon the overflow of the <HI>Scythians,</HI>
and their Irruption into <HI>Persia,</HI> were driven from thence as Fugitives
to seek fresh Habitations; which, those furnished with Boats from
the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf, might easily escape thither; where they comply∣ing
with some Propositions, as not to Kill any Beasts or living Crea∣tures,
and Conform to many of the <HI>Gentue</HI> Ceremonies, were Enter∣tained
and allowed to live among them.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>Moors</HI> have Subdued the Country, they think themselves
not obliged by the former Capitulation, they Feeding on both Fish
and Flesh; and for that reason were in hopes of exemption from
the present Poll, pretending their Law agreeable to the <HI>Moors,</HI> but
that would not free them from the Tax. These drink Wine, and
are of the Race of the Ancient <HI>Persians.</HI></P>
<P>They Worship the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worship the Sun.</NOTE> and keep at <HI>Nunsarry,</HI> a Delubrium,
where is always a Fire (first kindled by the Sun) kept alive as the
Holy Vestal Nuns were wont; they Adore all the Elements, and
if at any time they go a Voyage, will not exonerate in the Sea, or
on the Water, but have Jarrs on purpose; if their Houses be on
fire, they quench them not with Water, rather chusing to load them
with Dust or Sand.</P>
<P>These Bury not their Dead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They expose their Dead to Ravenous Fowls.</NOTE> but expose them in round Tombs made
on purpose, (open on top, and walled high around, in distinct Apar∣titions)
to the Vultures and ravenous Fowls to Entomb them; and
to that end, in the middle of this Enclosure is a Well for the Filth
to drain away; the next of Kin, after the Body is put in, Watch
aloof, to know what Part these Birds of Prey lay hold on, and
from thence make their report of the future Bliss, or ill State of the
Deceased.</P>
<P>These are somewhat Whiter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Living.</NOTE> and, I think, Nastier than the <HI>Gen∣tues;</HI>
and Live, as they do, all of a Family together; as if the Fa∣ther
be Living, then all the Sons that are Married, and Men grown,
with their Wives and Children, house it with the Father, and have
a Portion of his Stock; if he die, or be absent, the Eldest Brother
<PB N="118" REF="78"/>
has the Respect of the Father shewn, and so successively; they all
Rising up at his Appearance, and Sit not till he be Seated.</P>
<P>These are rather Husbandmen than Merchants, not caring to stir
abroad; they supply the Marine with Carts drawn by Oxen, the
Ships with Wood and Water; the latter of which is excellent,
drawn out of a Well at old <HI>Swally;</HI> where, and at others, the
Women put me in mind of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Well, and the Custom of old for
them to draw Water, which though here it is fetch'd up by Oxen,
yet elsewhere the Women draw in Jarrs, or Earthen Pots. The
<HI>Moors</HI> have it brought on <HI>Buffola</HI>'s Backs, or else on Oxen; which
here also they use, as all over <HI>India,</HI> instead of Pack-horses, their
greatest <HI>Caphala</HI>'s consisting of them, Horses being only for War or
Pleasure, and the best of them Foreigners, and of great Prices;
so that 300 <HI>l.</HI> is but an easy Rate for a good <HI>Persian</HI> or <HI>Arab.</HI></P>
<P>Here are brought up large gallant Milk-White Oxen with Circling
Horns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Large Milk-White Oxen.</NOTE> artificially Modelled in Cases, which they Tip with Silver,
Gold, or Brass, and make them shine like Jet; putting a Rope
through their Nostrils, and an Headstal on them of <HI>London</HI> Cloath, sur∣rounding
their Necks with Collars for Bells, Feeding them delicately
as their Horses; and one of these fitted for a Coach, will Sell for
30 or 40 <HI>l.</HI> The other Oxen are Little, but all have a Bunch on
their Neck; and how they become Oxen is on this manner; Their
Religion not allowing them to Castrate them, they Bruise their
Testicles, not Geld them by Cutting them off when Young;
which answers the intention as fully as the other. This kind of re∣straint
upon Nature is exercised on no Brutes but these, they never
offering to deprive their Horses of their Stones or Tails, which they
alway suffer to grow; a Bobtailed Nag, or Gelding, being as rare
here, as a Crop-eared Horse, which never was seen.</P>
<P>A <HI>Buffola</HI> is of a Dun Colour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Buffola.</HI></NOTE> and are all as big as their largest Oxen;
they love to wallow in the Mire like an Hog; there are of them
Wild, which are very Fierce and Mischievous, Trampling a Man
to Death, or Moiling him to Pieces with their Foreheads; their
Horns are carelesly turned with Knobs around, being usually so
ordered, or rather disordered (for they retain no certain Form) that
they lie too much over their Heads to do any harm with them. Their
Flesh is reckon'd Hotter and Courser than Beef, which is the most com∣mon
Sustinence of the <HI>Moors;</HI> as their Milk and boiled Butter is of
the <HI>Gentues;</HI> for did they not boil their Butter, it would be Rank,
but after it has passed the Fire, they keep it in Duppers the year
round: On which D<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>N. G.</HI> in his Account of the Rarities of the
Royal Society, has sufficiently enlarged.</P>
<P>Here in the Marshes are brought up great store of Cattle of all
sorts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marshes breed Cattle.</NOTE> and though there lie store of <HI>Aligators</HI> to and again, they
are seldome known to Prey either on them or their Young; so that
what stir they make of Charming them, is but a pious Fraud of the
<HI>Brachmins,</HI> they being a lazy sort of Amphibious Creature, feeding
on Grass as well as Fish, and I question whether ever their Appetite
stand towards Flesh.</P>
<P>The Mutton here is not much inferior to the Mutton of <HI>England,</HI>
for the Pallat, though as to its Wool, there is no compare. Cows

Butter sometimes will be hard in the Cold Season, and look yellow,
but they arrive not to the making of Cheese, unless it be soft Cheese,

<P>Herbs for Salading are Purslain, Sorrel, Lettice, Parsley, Taren∣tine,

<P>Here Asparagus flourish, as do Limes, Pomegranates, Geni∣tins;
Grapes in abundance; but the <HI>Moors</HI> suffer no Wine to be
made.</P>
<P>Fish, Oisters, Soles, and <HI>Indian</HI> Mackerel, the River yields very

Brand-Geese, Colum, and Serass,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Colum∣bin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> a Species of the former; in the

their Aspera Arteria, wound up in a Case on both sides their Breast∣bone
in manner of a Trumpet, such as our Waits use; when it is
single it is a Serass, when double a Colum, making a greater Noise
than a Bittern, being heard a great while before they can be seen,

most open on the Sea-coast and Unguarded.</P>
<P>These have lately fitted themselves with good stout Ships at <HI>Surat,</HI>
their own Country supplying them with no Materials for Building;
the non-payment whereof, according to the Contract with the Go∣vernor,
at present has put a stop to their increase that way in Ship∣ping;
and has kindled matter for farther alarming the Merchants:
For the Governor, for his security, has seised the <HI>Imaum's Vockeel,</HI>
nor intends he to enlarge him till the uttermost <HI>Gosbeek</HI> be paid.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="79"/>
On this Pretence they begin to interrupt the Merchants on the
Seas, seising their Vessels, and furnishing themselves at cheaper
Rates.</P>
<P>Nor does their late Enterprize over the <HI>Portugals</HI> make them less
formidable; so that if they be not checked by these Knights of
<HI>Lisboa,</HI> they will infect this Ocean, no less than the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Algiers,
Tunis</HI> and <HI>Tripoly,</HI> do the <HI>Narrow Seas</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> especially
the <HI>Gulf</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> in whose Mouth they are conveniently seated, and
villainously inclined; in which it concerns them to omit no Dili∣gence.</P>
<P>Having staid here since the close of the Rains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Left <HI>Surat</HI> and <HI>Swally.</HI></NOTE> all the Cold
Season, and beginning of the variable Winds, which are sent hither
to qualify the Heats before the fall of the Rains (they blowing very

<P>It is a Corporation exempt from any Jurisdiction but the Empe∣ror's;
though it be but the second City of the Province, and within
this last Century, by the concourse of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> advanced from
a Fishing Town to be so great an Empory.</P>
<P><HI>Ro Neal,</HI> a Mile beyond it on <HI>Swally</HI> side, was once before it, now
abandoned to Seamen and Washermen: The Customers then paid
half to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who once a-year came with their Provoes and
received their Levies; since this is become of more note, it is better
looked after by the <HI>Mogul,</HI> than that was by the Emperor of
<HI>Cambaia.</HI></P>
<P>It has for its Maintainance the Incomes of Thirty six Villages;
over which the Governor sometimes presides, sometimes not, being
in the <HI>Jaggea</HI> or Diocess of another; who fail not once a-year to send
to reap the Profit, which is received by the Hands of the <HI>Desie</HI> or
Farmer, who squeezes the Countryman, as much as the Governor
does the Citizen: Corn being distributed among them for so much
Earth as they Till, which at the time of Harvest is not carried home,
before the <HI>Desie</HI> hath taken Three parts, leaving no more for their
pains, and to sow the Land again, than One.</P>
<P>The Business of the Customs, as we have already said, is ordered
by the Chief Customer, who has <HI>Chockies</HI> in all Inland Parts to re∣ceive

cope with him in a pitched Field, but only by Thievery and Surprize:

guard it, otherwise they are liable to be made a Prey.</P>
<P>Were these Difficulties removed, <HI>Surat,</HI> as if Nature had designed

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Brings me with a New Deputy-Governor from Surat to Bom∣baim,
and sends me to the Mogul's General at Jeneah.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fourth of <HI>April</HI> 1675. arriving at <HI>Bombaim</HI> with Mr. <HI>Gyf∣ford,</HI>
he was reinstated Deputy-Governor of that Island;
Captain <HI>Shaxton</HI> in this interim having his Sword demanded from
him by the Governor, and had been under Confinement; being
bound to answer an Indictment, wherein he was accused of Abet∣ting
the Mutinous Soldiers.</P>
<P>For whose Trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain <HI>Shax∣ton</HI> sent home.</NOTE> after a long endeavour to bring him to acknow∣ledgment,
was erected a select Court of Judicature, and an Attorny
ordered to impeach him, who with some borrowed Rhetorick en∣deavoured
to make him appear a Second <HI>Catiline;</HI> but he cleared
himself so handsomely of all Objections (being sick at that time the
Stirs were, and having no reference to him, their Complaints being
of another nature, as the taking Money for more than could be pas∣sed
current again, and other like pretended Exactions) that they had
no more to answer, than that it should be referred to the Company;
before whom he must personally appear, and therefore was ordered
home, but was prevented by Death at the end of his Voyage: Other∣wise
<PB N="122" REF="80"/>
he would have made it plain, Envy had underhand worked,
what she durst not attempt boldly on a Man of Honour; and for
no other Reason, than that he understood himself as a Soldier, and
in that point would be known.</P>
<P>By this Man's Misfortune might have been seen the dislike that
the Company's Servants bear towards any of equal poise with
themselves, and not of that Rank; for thereby they count they are
injured, having others put over their heads, as 'tis termed; but if by
chance they convince them of their Folly, it becomes a Crime un∣pardonable:
The first ground of this Quarrel being upon unnecessary
Appendices to the Fort, as Pallisadoes in Mud, so contrived, that
they were rather a means to take than defend it, which afterwards
were all washed away by the Rains; to these some Despight being
added (he being a Man sharp in his Jests, and blunt in Counsel) it
never ended, till it proved as fatal as <HI>Remus</HI>'s leaping over his Bro∣ther
<HI>Romulus</HI> his Ditch, cast for a Trench about Old <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Few days had been spent afore a <HI>Sea-Tortoise</HI> was brought to the
Fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Sea-Tortoise</HI> taken.</NOTE> in Length Six Feet, the content of his Hut near two Bushels,
reckoning only that part with which his Back is shielded, being an
huge Shell of a brown Colour; never to be made transparent as those
come from the <HI>South-Seas</HI> are, nor easily to be crackt by any weight;
for Experiment, I and two more got upon it, and the <HI>Tortoise</HI> un∣concerned
carried us: Its Head is loricated with Scales, the Neck
reaching as far as the Hut, soft and undefensible; the Fins are
four, placed instead of Legs, by which it crawls as well as swims;
the Belly is covered with a Breast-plate called the <HI>Callapee,</HI> soft and
whitish in respect of the Back-piece or <HI>Callipet;</HI> its Tail is short and
wreathed like a Serpent's; altogether it is as lovely as a Toad: It
sighs like a Woman, and weeps like a Child; being taken and turned
on its back, it is shiftless.</P>
<P>I caused it to be opened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fable of its having three Hearts confuted.</NOTE> and examined its Heart, which (con∣trary
to the Opinion of the Vulgar) is but One, they affirming it to
be Three, grounded on this Mistake; the Auricles being larger than
in other Creatures, equalling almost the Ventricles and whole Body
of the Heart, which is bigger in proportion than belongs to such an
Animal, being as large as an Ox's; which might be the reason of
its Pusilanimity: The Veins and Arteries were filled with Currents
of cold black Blood: It participates more of Flesh than Fish, of a vi∣viparous
than oviparous Offspring, yet lays imperfect Eggs without
a Crust (only covered with a Membrane, being most Yolk) buried
by it in the Sands, to receive from the Sun's heat the perfection of
their Hatching (as the Eggs of <HI>Egypt</HI> from Furnaces, or others
from Dunghills): It spawns them as Fish do, in huge quantities, as
much at one time as will more than fill a Seaman's Bonnet (every
one being as big as an Hen's Egg) By them aboard Ship they are or∣dered
like buttered Eggs of a Fowl, though nearer akin to a Ser∣pent's,
hanging together as those do.</P>
<P>For this end they come ashore, and when pursued, cast up with
their Claws a Cloud of Sand to blind their Enemies; when overtaken
some are so big, four men can hardly turn them.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="80"/>
It is supposed they feed on the Grass or Oaz on Land, or at the
bottom of the Ocean; and from the Fable of the Three Hearts, springs
the Conceit of its Tripartite Community, of Fish, and Flesh, and
Fowl; the outward Covering being Shelly, the inner Meat Carnous,
its way of preserving its kind being by Eggs, as the Feathered Fowl
do: To me it seems (though the Flesh be highly extolled for the
taste and colour of Veal) neither Fish, nor Flesh, nor good Red
Herring.</P>
<P>It bears the Vogue for altering the Blood;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Flesh re∣storative.</NOTE> wherefore good in Scur∣vies
got by bad Air and Diet in long Voyages, and for the Running
of the Reins by impure Copulation; for which 'tis used as an un∣doubted
Cure, purging by the Genitals an Oily viscous Matter of a
Yellow hew, if fed upon constantly for thirty days; restoring the
decayed Vigour of the Body, and giving it a grace and lustre as ele∣gant,
as Viper Wine does Consumptive Persons, or worn-out Pro∣stitutes.</P>
<P>About this time the President put in execution a Project for the
advancing the Island <HI>Bombaim;</HI> wherefore an Envoy was sent to ex∣plore
the Passage through <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Country into the Confines of
<HI>Duccan;</HI> but returned with a fruitless Account, only making farther
work for me.</P>
<P>One of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Generals over Seventeen thousand Horse, and
Three thousand Foot, and Governor of <HI>Jeneah</HI> (the Chief City of that
Kingdom) having occasion for one of my Function, on St. <HI>George</HI>'s
Day I was commanded by the Honourable <HI>Gerald Aungier,</HI> with only
Oral Instructions, to embarque on a <HI>Bombaim</HI> Boat of Twelve Oars
and a Steer's-man, waited on by two of the Governor's Servants,
four <HI>Moor Peons,</HI> a <HI>Portuguez,</HI> my own Servants, a <HI>Brachmin</HI> for Lin∣guist,
an Horse-keeper, eight Coolies to my <HI>Palenkeen,</HI> a dozen
<HI>Frasses</HI> for Lumber, and one Horse.</P>
<P>Thus equipped,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Take Boat for <HI>Duccan.</HI></NOTE> I left <HI>Bombaim</HI> about Three in the Afternoon,
and the same Night about Nine Anchored on this side <HI>Tanaw,</HI> where
in our passage were visible a great way off, on the tops of the Moun∣tains,
several Fortresses of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s, only defensible by Nature,
needing no other Artillery but Stones, which they tumble down up∣on
their Foes, carrying as certain destruction with them as Bullets
where they alight: The next Morning, with only sending my Ser∣vant
ashore to acquaint the <HI>Rendero,</HI> I quitted the Pass; and a Mile
beyond the City deserted <HI>Baçein</HI> River on the left, and took our
Course up a spacious Navigable River, which makes the Island of <HI>Ba∣çein,</HI>
the Banks of which are low and fruitful; on both sides are
placed stately <HI>Aldeas,</HI> and Dwellings of the <HI>Portugal Fidalgos;</HI> till
on the Right, within a Mile or more of <HI>Gullean,</HI> they yield possession
to the Neigbouring <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> at which City (the Key this way into that
Rebels Country) Wind and Tide favouring us, we landed at about
Nine in the Morning, and were civilly treated by the Customer in his
<HI>Choultry,</HI> till the <HI>Havaldar</HI> could be acquainted of my arrival; who
immediatly ordered me a great <HI>Mosch</HI> for my reception, whence I
sent the <HI>Brachmin</HI> to complement him, and deliver the Presidents
Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="81"/>
Who understanding my Business, desired the favour of me to visit
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Landing and Reception at <HI>Gullean.</HI></NOTE> and there should attend on me some of his Friends that were
diseased; I easily condescended, thinking to procure my Dispatch
with more speed; which succeeded alike, I receiving his <HI>Chitty</HI> or
Pass, with two Guides to direct us through the Country.</P>
<P>Early therefore the next Morning I left the most Glorious Ruins
the <HI>Mahometans</HI> in <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>an</HI> ever had occasion to deplore: For this City,
once the chief Empory, excelled not only in Trade, but the general
consequent, Sumptuousness, if the Reliques of the Stately Fabricks
may add Credit to such a belief; which Reliques, notwithstanding the
Fury of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> afterward of the <HI>Mogul,</HI> since of <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> and
now lately again of the <HI>Mogul,</HI> (whose Flames were hardly extinguish∣ed
at my being here, and the Governor and People on that score being
prepared more for Flight than Defence at present) are still the extant
Marks of its pristine Height: The remaining Buildings having
many Stories of square facing Stones, and the Mosques, which are
numerous, of the same, abating little of their ancient Lustre, being
all watered with delicate Tanks; about which are costly Tombs
with their distinct Chappels or Mosques, where formerly the <HI>Mul∣lahs</HI>
had fat Pensions to pray for the departed Souls, which is main∣tained
by them as efficacious; wherefore they covet Funerals in the
most conspicuous Places, which the Pleasant Summer-houses hanging
over here, cause these Places to be; the unemploy'd People of the Town
daily wasting their time in these inviting Varieties; which is the on∣ly
thing pleads for their continuance, <HI>Seva Gi</HI> as a <HI>Gentu</HI> being other∣wise
inclinable to raze them; yet purposely to pervert them from
the use of the Donors, and Intention of the Founders, orders them
to be converted into Granaries, especially those within the City.</P>
<P>The Houses the present Inhabitants kennel in are mean, the Peo∣ple
beggarly, by reason of these Hostile Incursions.</P>
<P>By Twelve at Noon having journey'd over Rocky,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Set forward to <HI>Intwally,</HI> the Country all burnt and de∣stroyed.</NOTE> Barren, and
Parched Ways, I came to <HI>Intwally,</HI> Three Course, or Seven Mile and
an half; the Season of the Year (the Heats being now most vio∣lent)
as well as the Time of the Day not permitting us any longer
to endure their Extremity, I never staid for License, but shaded my
self under a Wooden Mosque, the only Structure standing in the
Town, it suffering the same Fate with <HI>Gullean,</HI> and was then reaking in
its Ashes, the <HI>Moguls</HI> Army laying waste all in their Road, both Villages,
Fodder, and Corn; and for their Cattel they drive them along with
them, and take them, their Wives and Children for Slaves; so that
none escape, except those that can fly fastest, or hide themselves in the
Woods, which they also set on fire, to leave them destitute of those
Recesses. This <HI>Gom</HI> or Town stood in a large Grove of <HI>Mangoes,</HI> on
the Bank of a deep Creek, which though at this time fordable, yet I
believe the Rains may swell into a Torrent.</P>
<P>Having refreshed my self and <HI>Coolies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence to <HI>Moorbar.</HI></NOTE> I hired an Ox, they com∣plaining
they had too much Burthen, travelling more advisedly by
Moonshine, (through a better Soil, and more exchange, as Arable
Ground, Heaths, Forests, and Woods, some of which were on Fire
two or three Miles together) from Six till Twelve, when we took
up our Rest at a poor Village called <HI>Moorbar,</HI> six Course from
<PB N="125" REF="81"/>
<HI>Intwally:</HI> This place was not able to afford us an House or Shed, but
we were forced to creep into one of their Cottages, half finished,
they thatching it with Bents shelving from the Ridge down to the
Bottom on both sides, no bigger than a Man might carry.</P>
<P>I kept the <HI>Coolies</HI> to their Watch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Force to keep watch.</NOTE> notwithstanding their hard
Days labour, as well to keep Tigres and Wild Beasts from us, as
Thieves and Robbers: The day following I staid here till Four in
the Afternoon to avoid the Soultriness of the Weather, which I could
hardly do where I was lodged, there being no Air; which caused me
to remove out of the Town at Sun rise to the left of two pitiful
<HI>Tanks</HI> belonging thereto; they being all here ignorant Idolaters, and
Husbandmen, every one chusing his own God; no Family being
without some <HI>Pan Daemon,</HI> or <HI>Incubus;</HI> which they paint with hide∣ous
Forms, bedaub with stinking Oil, and offer the Fruits of the
Earth to: Most Abominably Superstitious, that an ill <HI>Augury</HI> shall
detain them idle a whole day, though they and their Houshold must
starve, if they work not; such as an Hare crossing the Way, or a
Crow on the Left hand. They have no publick <HI>Pagod,</HI> or Place of
Worship, besides these <HI>Tanks,</HI> where they wash and burn their Dead,
giving me a Nosegay of one of their Carkases, before I got my Break∣fast,
as I lay to repose under a Tree; which made me range for
Game, and disperse my Servants for Provant, being otherwise likely
to go without; they living upon <HI>Batty,</HI> or Seeds of Grass, eating
neither Fish nor Flesh, neither indeed have they any, unless by
chance; for after my Purveyors had made diligent search, with much
ado they purchased one Hen, tho several Villages were in sight, and
all of them greedy enough to take Money, had they had Provi∣sions.
It is all Plowed Land hereabouts, but <HI>Seva Gi</HI> commonly
reaps the Harvest, leaving hardly so much to the Tillers as will
keep Life and Soul together.</P>
<P>And now going to set out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guides lead us about.</NOTE> I began by the murmurings of the <HI>Coo∣lies</HI>
to understand that the Guides, being jealous of falling into the Ene∣my's
hands, had a design to lead us about; (but every one besides the
<HI>Cauns Peons</HI> being Strangers, and they fearful to discover themselves,
we were persuaded to resign our selves to their Conduct) over Hilly,
but none of the worst Ways; two or three Miles together they are
all burnt, bearing nothing but withered Benty-Grass, which burning
afore the Rains, benefits the Ground much; and are now out of distrust
the <HI>Moguls</HI> should Forrage their Army here.</P>
<P>Below this, we passed over a fine Meadow checquered with Pur∣ling
Brooks, and three Villages, much about an equal distance one
from another: And now the broken Ribs of these lofty Mountains
seen so far off at Sea all along from <HI>Cape Comory,</HI> as if founded for an
Ascent unto the Skies, begin to be discovered by our near approach;
when Night interposing her black Vail between our Eyes and them,
they became vested with a more benighted Darkness than hung over
us; which served as a sable Cloud to direct us to <HI>Dehir,</HI> by Eleven
a Clock at Night, nine Course from our last Stage, seated at the end
of a large Plain, at the foot of that Chain of Hills supposed to cross
the <HI>Taurus,</HI> trending through the Continent <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> as that
<PB N="126" REF="82"/>
does <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West;</HI> it is by most Geographers concluded to be
Mount <HI>Sephir,</HI> here called the <HI>Gaot.</HI></P>
<P>We found them all in Arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Come to <HI>De∣hir,</HI> a Garison'd Town of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s, at the foot of the <HI>Gaot.</HI></NOTE> not suffering their Women to stir out
of the Town Unguarded to fetch Water, being accustomed to
continual Alarms; which cautiousness obliged them to usher me
into the Market-place, by a small Party which lighted on me in their
Rounds; when I sent my <HI>Gulleon Peon,</HI> one of our Guides, with
his Masters <HI>Chitty,</HI> or Pass, to the Governor, who received it
kindly, and gave me leave to be my own Quartermaster (little
Complements being expected from Soldiers).</P>
<P>My Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Awakes a <HI>Fakier</HI> Drunk with <HI>Bang.</HI></NOTE> as well as my self, being Tired, and now stiff with
a little Rest allowed them till the return of the <HI>Peon,</HI> we were not wil∣ling
to be at more pains to seek for a better Inn, than what a <HI>Fakier</HI>
had taken up before us; but we rouzed a Lion, who had just been
lain asleep with <HI>Bang,</HI> who opened with such a Clamour, that I was
afraid it would have brought all the Watch about us, had they not
been in the same tune, calling on one another, as Children when the
Light is out, do for fear; beating their Drums, and sounding their
Trumpets (Shriller than the <HI>Moors,</HI> and more Tuneable) all Night
long; by which means, and my Quarrelsome Inmate, I could
compose my self to no Quiet; though for the latter, at length I
thought of an Expedient, plying him with <HI>Arack</HI> till his Tongue re∣solved
its self in Silence, which was much more grateful than his
Bawling.</P>
<P>The next Morning when Day had cleared our Eyesight, I saw the
Idol, this Drunken Priest Adored, hard by me; it was thick and
short, Carved in Stone, of a Monstrous Visage, whisking his Tail
over his Head; the upper Parts to the Waste, were Painted with Red;
it insulted over another ugly Creature it trod on; it was of a Sooty
Colour, and Swam in streams of Oil; yet it called in a great many
<HI>Devotes,</HI> who came to pay their <HI>Salams.</HI></P>
<P>I sent to the <HI>Havaldar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Advan∣tage taken of a Discompo∣sed Counte∣nance, shewn anon. p. 127. <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Hor∣ses kept here.</NOTE> to know when he would Pass us up the
<HI>Gaot;</HI> word was brought he was not awake, having been up all
Night; in the interim therefore, I Walked about the Town, which
is Crowded with People, but miserably Poor, and of no Note, were
it not that <HI>Seva Gi</HI> Stables his choicest Horses here, for the conveni∣ency
of this Plain to supply them with Hay and Corn, which cau∣ses
them to have the greater Force, and makes it the Residence of
an <HI>Havaldar,</HI> who is a kind of petty General: Changing the Town
for the open Fields, I was led to a Grove of <HI>Mangoes</HI> and <HI>Thamarinds,</HI>
at the end of which, was a Mosque, and a great many Tombs of ex∣cellent
Stone, Demolished; one of which they remember with Re∣spect,
by the Name of <HI>Melech-Bury,</HI> a great Warrior; however,
that which pleased me most of all, was a sudden surprize, when they
brought me to the wrong side of a pretty Square Tank, or Well,
with a Wall of Stone, Breast high; where expecting to find it cove∣red
with Water, looking down five Fathom deep, I saw a clutter of
Women, very Handsome, waiting the distilling of the Water from
its dewy sides; which they catch in Jarrs, and constantly carrying
it away, leave it only weeping: It is cut out of a firm Black Marble
Rock up almost to the Top, with broad Steps to go down.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="82"/>
Now we could not only see their Forts, but hear also the Watch∣men
from their Garisons aloft, some Five hundred, some more, some
fewer Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Forts all about.</NOTE> to and again among the Hills, the main strength of this
Prince consisting in these; coming back I found my troublesome
Comrade very Merry, and packing up his Housholdstuff, his <HI>Bang-bowl,</HI>
and <HI>Hubble Bubble,</HI> to go along with me, before I had got∣ten
leave from the <HI>Havaldar,</HI> who had newly sent word he was
ready to receive me.</P>
<P>I made him not tarry long, following the Messenger, who brought
me into the middle of a ragged Regiment, distinguishable from the
<HI>Mogul</HI>'s on that score, but more peculiarly by their Hair appearing
on both Ears under their <HI>Puckeries;</HI> their Weapons are much alike,
though to me they give more cause of Laughter, than Terror
(considering the awkwardness of their wearing them) notwith∣standing
they are the Instruments of Death.</P>
<P>When I came before the Governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the <HI>Havaldar.</HI></NOTE> I found him in State, though
under an Hovel; where were many <HI>Brachmins</HI> with Accompt-Books,
writing at some distance; nearer, his Privy-Council, with whom
he seemed to Advise: I was placed on his Left hand, and desired
my Interpreter to acquaint him my Errand, withal intreating his Fa∣vour
for my secure passing the Hill: He made it a piece of difficulty,
and told me I must return to <HI>Bimly</HI> for Orders, to whose <HI>Havaldar</HI>
he was accountable, not to him of <HI>Gulleon;</HI> which was within half a
days Journy from whence I set forth. Hearing this I bore my self as
sedately as I could, having been informed of the advantage they take
of a disturbed Countenance; and sweetned him with his own Au∣thority
being sufficient, telling him of his Master's Kindness to the
<HI>English,</HI> and their Friendship towards him; which worked him to a
yielding Temper; yet he scrupled my <HI>Canister,</HI> or Trunk, might be
lined with Pearl, my Horse sold to the Enemy, hoping to suck some∣what
out of me; I replying, What I had brought were at his liberty
to search, and that I went only on an amicable account to Cure a
Sick Person, and should be as ready to serve him, if required, his
Fury was quite pawled; but perceiving an hungry look to
hang on them all, and suspecting lest they should serve me
some Dog-trick, I made a small Present, and he signing the
Pass, dismissed me with a Bundle of <HI>Pawn,</HI> the usual Ceremony at
Parting.</P>
<P>Being clear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Got clear of <HI>Dehir.</HI></NOTE> I could not so readily shake off my <HI>Fakier,</HI> he would
march with me; when we were not gone above two Course, or
three Miles, the Liquor working out by his Walking, he began to
grow weary, and called out for the Horse, which I had caused the
<HI>Portugueze</HI> to Mount, which he took in such dudging, seeing him∣self
on Foot, and him on Horseback, that he turned Tail, and
went back again to his Vomit, without bidding adieu.</P>
<P>And now our mighty Task began to try our Feet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A trouble∣some passage over the <HI>Gaot.</HI></NOTE> as well as weary
our Eyes: I not caring to hazard my self longer in my <HI>Palenkeen,</HI>
alighted, and though I thought it a work impossible to conquer, I
put the best face on it I could, tarrying till they were all together, the
better to chear them. The <HI>Coolies</HI> providing themselves with Staves,
distrusted not only their own Legs, but the Ground they went on,
<PB N="128" REF="83"/>
it having forsaken many a tall Tree around us; some holding by the
mouldring Earth with half their Roots bare, others half buried in
Pits they never grew in, lay expecting their <HI>quondam</HI> Neighbours
downfal.</P>
<P>The busy Apes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Monkies afrighted.</NOTE> the Forlorn hope of these declining Woods,
deeming no place safe where they beheld us, made strange Levaltoes
with their hanging Brats from one Bough to another, Chattering an
Invasion; but these saw us presently exalted beyond their Bowers,
and feared us from above, as much as we to salute them below:
Thus far was passable enough, when the Sun levelled himself unto
our Steps, and we looked for Day beneath us. Here I made a second
pause, and promised them Nectar in the Skies; this proved but a
faint Cordial to the <HI>Frasses,</HI> who failed afore they got a quarter up;
for whom after I had provided (the Moon assisting us with a less
parching Light) I found my Hands as necessary to Clamber as my
Feet, Travelling on all Four; the Stones were laid step by step, but
in little order; and now so steep, that it differed little from Perpen∣dicular,
only by the winding of the Mountain; and so Narrow, that
Two Men could not pass abreast; where chiefly were laid Trees
and Timber to make work for the Army, should they attempt this
Way; which sorely increased our trouble, being the first Adventurers,
beside the danger we incurred of being Assaulted from above, they
not yet knowing who we were. To look down made my Brains turn
round; over my Head pendulous Rocks threatned to Entomb me.</P>
<P>We had not gone long thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Flurries</HI> from the Hills carry Men and Ox∣en down the Precipice</NOTE> before the Cry came, the Ox was
fallen; 'twas well he chose not the place where I was in, for the
least lapse had irrecoverably whirled him to the bottom: Arguments
were too weak to persuade the <HI>Coolies</HI> to go back to him to help him;
I therefore proceeded to Threats, which made Two of them return
to his Aid: I confess the sense of their hard Labour urged me to
pity; the Anguish of which extorted Tears from some, unseasonable
at this time to take notice of to them; we had only this Comfort,
the Even was Calm and Serene, and we were mounted beyond the
humble Mists, which we could discern fluctuating against the impe∣netrable
Promontories; which may be the reason sometimes (they
say) Men and Oxen are hurled down the Precipice by sudden Gusts,
when they are exalted to the Clouds, and they break with too great
an Impetuosity: For all this Light we seemed Obscured, the splen∣dour
of the Moon being shaded by the sides of the Mountains, which
appeared here all Marble.</P>
<P>The Horse (being a <HI>Turky</HI> one) made the best shift of all, and was
more forward than convenient, pelting us with great Stones his
Hoofs had removed, which caused us to retard his haste, and leave
him to come last.</P>
<P>About Nine a Clock at Night the Moon shone over our Heads,
more joyful at her presence, than her feignedly beloved <HI>Endimion:</HI>
An hour after we came tired to the Brow, through a narrow Cavern
cut out of the main Rock; here being no Guard, the noise of the
Army being over, I was the second Man Trampled on the Top, half an
hour after the <HI>Palenkeen</HI> came, and all the rest within two hours more:
Here I was as good as my word, and distributed <HI>Arack</HI> among them,
<PB N="129" REF="83"/>
which made them, for all their tedious Tug, run amain to the next
Town <HI>Oppagaot;</HI> where early in the Morning I crowded under an
Old Shed.</P>
<P>This <HI>Gur</HI> or Hill is reckoned four Course up (every Course being
a Mile and half):<NOTE PLACE="marg">The heighth of the Moun∣tain.</NOTE> From whence is beheld the World beneath all fur∣led
with Clouds, the <HI>Caerulean</HI> Ocean terminating the Horizon, the
adjacent Islands bordering on the Main, the Mountains fenced with
horrible Gulphs, till strange Vertigoes prejudicate Fancy, not daring
longer to be made a Spectator: The bandying Eccho still persecutes
with terrible repeated Sounds, meeting fresh Objects to reundulate
it, though at the greater distance, being yet enclosed with Moun∣tains,
which they maintain as Fortresses; and I can give no reason
why they do not this Entry also, unless because it is so contrived that
Ten Men may keep down Ten thousand.</P>
<P>Here is a sensible alteration of the Air:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alteration of Air on the Hills.</NOTE> The Dawn of the Morning,
and latter part of the Night, 'twas sharp, cold, and piercing; so
that all I gathered about me would scarce keep me warm; and all
the Day there were fine cool Briezes, though below we were almost
choaked with soultry Heats: The Reason whereof I judge to be, be∣cause
the High Mountains reverberate the flowing Particles of the
Atmosphere; as we see the Rocks do Water more strongly, by how
much more force the Waves assail them; so here the Air (which is
thicker below) driven against these Hills breaks off in Flurries, which
seeking to retire into their own Ocean, mitigate the violence of the
Heat in their passage, by fanning as it were the Air; by which means,
and the Sun's rarifying the Misty Vapours, they are left pure, and fall
at Night in more limpid Dews to cool and refresh the Earth: To
which Sense sings <HI>Lucan,</HI>
<Q><L>Fulminibus proprior terrae succenditur aër,</L>
<L>Imaque telluris ventos tractusque coruscos</L>
<L>Flammarum accipiunt: Nubes excedit Olympus.</L></Q>
Moreover, Bogs and Fens are rarely found to soil the Air, or pen in
the Heat for want of ventilation.</P>
<P>This is a sad Starvling Town;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oppagaot</HI> a starveling Town.</NOTE> to it belongs a <HI>Subidar,</HI> or Cu∣stomer;
who blown up with the confidence of half a dozen Bill-men,
thought to have compell'd me to stay till the Governor of the Castle
should examine my <HI>Cocket,</HI> which he had sent him by the <HI>Haval∣dar:</HI>
I ordered him to send it with one of the <HI>Gulean Peons;</HI> but he
made Answer, the Governor having been up all Night, was not
then at leisure. While we were talking, a Drove of <HI>Combies</HI> (Hinds)
passed with Provisions on their Heads for the Castle; and I having
staid till Three in the Afternoon, not getting any other Answer, I
commanded the <HI>Coolies</HI> to march, though the <HI>Subidar</HI> prohibited
and kept them from following them with my Men and Arms, as
Carbines and Blunderbusses; and the Governor not coming as he
told my <HI>Peons</HI> they would, by Four, I dismissed the <HI>Gulean Peons,</HI>
they daring to go no farther; and if there were farther occasion for
a Pass, to bring it after me; thereby frustrating their Intention,
which was to retard me, whereby to make their Booty of me.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="84"/>
They durst no more than curse, for all I departed without leave,
taking my Course into a deep Valley, which winded and turned like a
River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We force our way.</NOTE> and I believe is one in the Rains: Half way we met another
<HI>Caphala</HI> of Oxen laden with Provisions, hardly escaping the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s
Army, which they told us was not far afore us: My <HI>Coolies</HI> more
jealous of the Villany of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s People than my self, made haste,
and by Ten at Night arrived at <HI>Aumbegaum,</HI> Ten Course.</P>
<P>From whence <HI>Mucklis Caun</HI>'s Men had driven all away with a Par∣ty
of his Horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our escape to <HI>Aumbegaum,</HI> and hardship of the <HI>Coolies.</HI></NOTE> only one <HI>Fakier,</HI> who had set up his Standard in a
Shop in the <HI>Buzzar,</HI> next to whom I shrowded my self under one of
the same Stalls: Before Five in the Morning, for fear of farther In∣terruption,
I posted hence, up Hill and down Hill, not having
Rice for my People to eat (all being fled) we came to a neat Stone
Well of good Water; hard by which was an excellent Fig-tree, on
whose Fruit, yet Green, my <HI>Indians</HI> fed heartily, and trouped by
three or four wretched Towns, up another Mountain, not altoge∣ther
so bad as the first, yet on the account of their wanting their
wonted Food, it went hard with the <HI>Coolies</HI> to foot it to <HI>Beelseer,</HI>
two Course short of <HI>Jeneah,</HI> where we baited; it being high time,
they having gone near Fifty Miles without eating more than a few
squashy Figs: They unloaded at Noon under a Row of spreading
<HI>Mangos,</HI> on the side of a Brook; and provided themselves with Vi∣ctuals
in an adjacent Village, liable to continual pillaging on both
sides; but being reduced to the Condition of having little or nothing
to lose, it is the better born.</P>
<P>Hence it is plain to <HI>Jeneah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our entrance into the City of <HI>Jeneah.</HI></NOTE> the Hills keeping their distance from
its Invincible <HI>Gur:</HI> The length of whose Bottom fills most of the
space from this Place to the City, which is the Frontier of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s
Territory this way; and has been for many Years the Seat of War
to the <HI>South,</HI> which is the signification of <HI>Duccan.</HI></P>
<P>I sent the Governor's <HI>Peon</HI> to acquaint him of my approach (I
not arriving till Sun-set) when he met me with others that were
appointed at a Garden short of the Town, with the Governor's Com∣plement;
and conducted me to a Palace in a Compleat Garden,
adorned with <HI>Cypress</HI> Trees (not usual in <HI>India) Hummums, Tanks,
Choultries</HI> and <HI>Walks,</HI> with <HI>Water-Courses:</HI> When I was asleep, the
<HI>Nabob</HI> or Governor sent me a Service in Plate covered with Em∣broidered
Velvet over Noble <HI>Surpooses</HI> or Covers, ushered with two
Silver Staves, and a Trumpet sounding afore it; which Course was
observed as long as I remained there.</P>
<P>The last day of <HI>April,</HI> being <HI>Friday,</HI> and the next after my arri∣val,
he sent to excuse himself, because it was his day of Devotion;
when after a Princely manner he rides on an Elephant to the <HI>Mosque;</HI>
and thence divertises himself in some place of Delight within his <HI>Se∣raglio</HI>

<P>IT was the first of <HI>May</HI> therefore before I waited on him; when
he ordered a Guard of Horse to attend me to the Castle, which
was large, but rude, and the Wall of raw Brick; serving as well to
secure Cattle as Men from the Enemy.</P>
<P>His own Apartments in the middle encompassed a verdent Qua∣drangle
of Trees and Plants;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Caun</HI> re∣ceives me publickly.</NOTE> in whose chief <HI>Choultry</HI> were assembled
all his Great Men on his Right hand, he being enclosed in a Seat of
State, boulstered up with Embroidered Cushions, smoaking out of a
Silver <HI>Hubble bubble;</HI> afore whom lay a rich Sword and Buckler, with
a Crescent Moon instead of Bosses, his Page bearing his Bow and Ar∣rows,
much after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner, as <HI>Busbequius</HI> reports of the
<HI>Grand Segnior, Sedebat in Solio humili instrato; juxta autem arcus &amp;
sagittae.</HI> All the Floor was spread with a soft Bed, over all a fine
white Calicut; the Pedestals were Massy Silver, where I put off my
Shooes, and after Respect paid, delivered the President's Letter, and
was received immediatly next to him on his Left hand, all that side
being kept void for my entertainment: The result of this Visit was,
after he had acquainted me who were to be my Patients, to tell me
I must be patient till a good day presented, and then I should be
called again; it remaining a Custom still in the <HI>East</HI> to defer im∣portant
Affairs till a Lucky Day, <HI>totis haerentia fastis.</HI> I only intreated
he would be mindful the Rains were at hand, falling earlier here
than in the Low Countries.</P>
<P>Our Discourse being ended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sycophants encouraged.</NOTE> a Couple of Singing-men began their
Songs of Praise, which they pride themselves in, not being content
with moderate Flattery; a thing odious to a generous Spirit, ac∣counting
those that do it, servile; and those that admit it, impru∣dent

that profess it for Lucre, but it is the general strife who may impose

<P>Such as appear before him make a <HI>Salam</HI> or Bow before they ascend
the <HI>Choultry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several man∣ner of Ad∣dresses.</NOTE> when if he allows them Conference, leaving their Slip∣pers

putting their Hands to their Heads, then to their Feet, which Sa∣lute
they call <HI>Pervenau,</HI> used to <HI>Cauns</HI> or Dukes. Above their Head,
cross their Breast to the Foot is <HI>Pharmau,</HI> only for Kings; the most
familiar is a Bow with the Head: If they are permitted to sit in his
Presence, those only of Consular Dignity have liberty to sit (as they
call it at ease) cross Legged; but an <HI>European,</HI> before he is accustomed,
will not be reconciled to that Term: Others of inferior Rank kneel,
<PB N="132" REF="85"/>
sitting on their Heels, to which Posture, though I was not tied, I
was thankful when he sent me a Bundle of <HI>Pawn,</HI> and had leave to
make use of my Legs; being led out, as I was conducted in, by
Two Virgers, and a large Train following, with a Master of Cere∣monies
accompanying.</P>
<P>In my passage through the Castle they seemed rather Encamped
than Fortified;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle no strong place.</NOTE> wherefore if <HI>Seva Gi</HI> brings any Power, they betake
themselves to speedy Flight, or retire to the Body of the Army un∣der
<HI>Badur Caun,</HI> Generalissimo in these Marches; being ill provided
to endure a Siege, and more able to defend themselves, joined to an
Host of Forty thousand Horse always at <HI>Pergom,</HI> three Days Journy
hence.</P>
<P>Curiosity invited many Spectators, and Courtesy some of Quality
to be my Harbingers at my Lodgings; which at my return I found
pestered, as I had the Streets all the way I came: They were very
Civil, making no Intrusion before they had requested leave; and
then interrogating the State of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Government, Policy, and
Learning; nodding a satisfaction in the account I gave them: Nor
were they less communicative in their Relations, of those Occurren∣ces
which wheeled in their Sphere, being highly concerned to shew
they had Book-men as well as Sword-men.</P>
<P>A good Day coming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A good Day consulted, when I had a private Invita∣tion to the <HI>Caun.</HI></NOTE> the Governor sent for me to Visit his Lady
in the <HI>Haram,</HI> which was opposite to a Chamber he sate in, Accom∣panied
only with one pretty Wanton Boy, his Only Son by this
Woman; upon which account he had the greater kindness for her:
An Old Gentlewoman with a Tiffany Vail, made many trips, being,
I suppose, the Governant of the Womens Quarters; at last I was
called and admitted with my Linguist.</P>
<P>At our being ready to enter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Admitted the Womens Quarters.</NOTE> she Clapped with her Hands to give
Notice; when we were led through a long dark Entry, with Dor∣mitories
on both sides, the Doors of which Creeked in our passage
(but I was cautious of being too Circumspect) till we came to an
aiery Choultry; where was placed a Bed hung with Silk Curtains;
to which being brought, I was Commanded to place my self close by
it, from whence I might conveniently Discourse and Feel her Pulse,
putting my Hand under the Curtains. It was agreed among them
to impose upon me; wherefore at first they gave me a Slaves Hand,
whom I declared to be Sound and Free from any Disease, nothing
contradicting the true Tenor and Rythme of Pulsation; when they
began to be more ingenuous, telling me, it was done to try me:
Then was given me another Hand, which demonstrated a weak
languid Constitution; and collecting the Signs and Symptoms, I
feared not to give Sentence; which met with their Approbation, and
so I was sent back the same way I came.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caun</HI> had been acquainted with what had passed, and seemed
pleased; whereupon I must visit the <HI>Haram</HI> again the next day to
Bleed another of his Wives, he being tolerated Four, though he keeps
more than Three hundred Concubines.</P>
<P>And now the Curtain was extended athwart the <HI>Choultry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What hap∣pened while I was in the <HI>Haram.</HI></NOTE> and an
Arm held forth at an hole; but this was a slight fence for such Ani∣mals,
who leaning too hard as they peeped, pulled it down, and disco∣vered

the whole Bevy, fluttering like so many Birds when a Net is
cast over them; yet none of them sought to escape, but feigning a
shamefacedness, continued looking through the wide Lattice of their
Fingers: The Lady I had by the Arm was a Plump Russet Dame,
summoning the remainder of her Blood to enliven her Cheeks (for
among the darkest Blacks, the Passions of Fear, Anger, or Joy,
are discernible enough in the Face) and she bearing a command,
caused it to be hung up again; pouring upon her extravasated Blood
a Golden shower of Pagods, which I made my Man fish for.</P>
<P>In this Interview they appeared to me not altogether unimployed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scandal thrown upon the Women.</NOTE>
there lying pared Mangoes, and other Fruits for Confection, and
Achars, or Pickles; some Samplers of good Housewifry in Needle∣works;
and no indecent decorum in managing their Cloystered way
of living, making it agreeable to the choice of Custom rather than
Restraint: But here are foulmouthed <HI>Homers</HI> that Stigmatize them,

<P>And a Man would guess no less, to see the number of Spies upon
them, of Toothless Old Women, and Beardless Eunuchs, that they
are incontinent in their Desires, for which reason they debar them
the sight of any thing Male, but their Lord; they Waiting, as well
to hand them Necessaries, as Wood, Water, Meat, and the like,
taking them at the Door, as to prevent unlawful Intruders.</P>

<P>And are Cloathed like the Men, only they go in their Hair within,

<P>Gaining by these steps a nearer intimacy with the <HI>Nabob,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Conference about the Affairs of the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> he cut
me new Business out every day; he advised me of the intention of
the Governor of the Castle on the Hill, to commit his Brother to
my Care; and I in a private Conference, according to my Instructi∣ons,
propounded the Commodity might arise from an intercourse of
Commerce between this place and <HI>Bombaim,</HI> from thence to <HI>Bussorah,
Persia,</HI> and <HI>Maecha,</HI> for to provide the Army with Horses; in re∣turn
of whom might be exchang'd the same Goods procurable at
<HI>Surat</HI> and better Cheap, should they succeed in their Conquests
over the Low Countries; which is not a matter of such impossibi∣lity
should they earnestly set upon it, considering the Avenues are
open: But by that proceeding, it would take away a powerful ob∣stacle
to the maintaining so vast an Army as is always in <HI>Duccan,</HI>
whereby a main Body of the Soldiery would be out of pay; which
is absolutely against the Generals interest, and therefore he would
never consent: This I soon saw was the main Argument, though he
coloured it with pretext, that 'twas a work of more pains to reduce
<PB N="134" REF="86"/>
<HI>Seva,</HI> than was represented, in respect of his Situation, being im∣powered
not only to make Excursions, but to bid them Defiance.</P>
<P>Whereupon I told him, If the latter was not feasible, it was in
vain to propose any thing in relation to the former, for that all Ac∣cess
was stopped if the Low Lands were not cleared; the <HI>Havaldars</HI>
being unconscionable in their Customs, and without doubt would
interrupt what might be serviceable to their Enemies, or bring pre∣judice
to their Prince; whereas were the Ways free, it would enrich
his <HI>Jageah</HI> beyond the <HI>Bunder</HI> at <HI>Surat,</HI> and tie the <HI>English</HI> to a per∣petual
Truce, who were known in these Parts addicted to Traffick,
and Friends to Peace: He asked further, How far we desired to ex∣tend
this Liberty? I replied, beyond the <HI>Portugal</HI> Dominions, which
would front the Island of <HI>Bombaim</HI> about <HI>Tull;</HI> otherwise we must
be at the charge of double Custom, to them as well as the <HI>Mogul.</HI>
He said all this had been moved to <HI>Badur Caun,</HI> but those to whose
hands the Presents for him had been entrusted, had defrauded him of
them, on whom nothing was to be wrought without liberal <HI>Piscashes,</HI>
he bearing it as high as the King himself, and at this juncture he was
an unfit Mediator to him, having lately had some jarrs with him
(the Governor of <HI>Jeneah</HI> undervaluing his Authority in an Expe∣pedition,
not long enough ago to be thoroughly forgot); however
did the President immediately apply himself to him, he was incli∣nable
enough to let him Settle Factories; which I gave him to un∣derstand,
without a mutual Benefit on both sides, was not the pre∣sent
Design; but for the esteem we bore to Men of Honour, and that
made account of their Word, it was wished the <HI>Moguls</HI> were posses∣sed
of those Parts; which was never to be cultivated, either with
good Manners, or Profit, whilst Perfidy reigned there.</P>
<P>This being the substance of our Discourse, after he had related
the Business to his Council (he replied) he would intimate what
might be effected in it, to the President, in answer to his Letter.</P>
<P>At Night it was dismally Tempestuous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mischief done by Thunder.</NOTE> Killing Two of the Watch
on Duty, and carrying a Tower of the Hill at one Clap; below, it
brake one Man's Arm, the Prologue to the Rains.</P>
<P>The Day after the <HI>Nabob</HI>'s Brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gover∣nor's Brother of the Hill descends for Cure.</NOTE> of the Castle, was received
kindly here, bringing a noble Train, and <HI>Piscash</HI> to bespeak his
Welcome; he was Lodged in a Palace adjoining that where I was.</P>
<P>The Eleventh of <HI>May</HI> I went abroad to a Garden left by a common
Strumpet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Strumpet's Benefaction.</NOTE> in which was a noble Tomb built in remembrance of her,
with a Well belonging to a lovely Spring, which by Aqueducts sup∣plied

<Q><L>Who when she died, like <HI>Flora</HI> Fair,</L>

<P>Hence we went to a ruined Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe∣ror's Palace.</NOTE> where <HI>Auren Zeeb,</HI> the present

<P>Cotton in its season is Planted all hereabouts:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fields no sooner Sowed than set on Fire.</NOTE> The Fields produce

consuming them; which made us bethink of retiring, they
descending sometimes in Parties to Prey on Straglers, that often
Troopers are sent home disrobed and dismounted, to be laught at for
their Misfortune.</P>
<P>Having tarried now till the Rains had made their first onset Four∣teen
days together,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dungeness</HI> ano∣ther Heathen <HI>Fane.</HI></NOTE> with horrid Thunder; at the end thereof I set
apart a day to take notice of the adjacent Rarities; among which is
a City called <HI>Dungeness,</HI> of like Antiquity and Workmanship, as
<HI>Canorein,</HI> cut out of a Mountanous Rock, with a Temple and other
spacious Halls, by no means inferior to it both for Water and other
Refreshments, and much more entire; Time having not dealt so
cruelly with it, but the Lines of its ruined Beauty are still legible,
though in old Characters; however it is left a desolate Habitation
for Batts and Wasps; to disturb which it is dangerous, being over∣grown
and desperately revengeful, following their Aggressors till
they have Whealed them into Contrition for their unadvised Provo∣cation:
To be out of the Noise of these buzzing Hornets, and to se∣cure
our selves from the surprize of any disturbed Idolater, who
might bellow the report of our being here, we hasted to the safer
Plain, and ended the rest of the day in a pleasant Garden, on the
brink of the River which glides hence to <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor of the <HI>Gur</HI> hearing I was preparing for to return
to <HI>Bombaim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Request of the Gover∣nour of the Hill for my Ascent.</NOTE> requested before my departue to accept of my choice,
either to ascend the <HI>Gur,</HI> or else to meet him at his Garden below,
being the prescribed Limits of his Walk: I signified my readiness to
comply with the former, wherefore he sent Four <HI>Palenkeens,</HI> his
Kinsman, an Ingenuous <HI>Mogul,</HI> and his Brother to attend me.</P>
<P>We Travelled Two Miles before we came to the Foot of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Suburbs a shelter to the Castle.</NOTE> where
is a Garison, or Fortified Town, walled with strong <HI>Chockies,</HI> or
Watches, and a Troop of Five hundred Horse, and as many Camels

Beasts being sheltered here anights. <HI>Seva Gi</HI> has distressed this often,
and put them to the rout; but that, whose Top we are endeavouring
to gain, is inaccessible, unless by Seven winding Gates, which are ve∣ry
strong, and able to clear one another as they rise, the Way being
lined with Murtherers, and they themselves defended with good
Pieces of Ordnance: The last is a Piece of excellent Work and
Strength, and the place filled with Soldiers.</P>
<P>Hence it is painful Riding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hill in∣accessible but by Seven Gates.</NOTE> and requires a strong Back to keep
State in a <HI>Palenkeen,</HI> it being carried almost bolt upright, over
slippery Marble steps, cut out of the shining Rock, as smooth as
Glass, and reflecting the Sun-beams as much: After we had mounted
near an Hundred Stairs, we were received into the Neck of the
Castle, which is collared about with a Wall, rather to keep them
from falling down, than needful to prevent Assailants; from whence
an easy Ascent leads to a Level, which is the Circus to train the In∣fantry;
where are conspicuous Tombs of their former Kings, being
firmly Built, and a Mosque of polished Marble, which on Festivals
only they repair unto: No Houses here are able to resist the Storms
of Wind, or the Sun's Heat, for which conveniency they have
made the <HI>Eastern</HI> side of the Hill most Inhabited, it serving instead

of a Bank; where they live in little low Huts, the Governor's not
exceeding in height, (though a pretty neat Dwelling, fenced with
Trees, no where else to be found) who had expected me Two whole
Hours; but being impatient of delay, and the Sun growing too hot, he
betook himself to his <HI>Haram,</HI> having ordered his Kinsman (whose
Civil Deportment met with his Commands) to Entertain me; he is
but Poor (so that he threatens the <HI>Nabob</HI> to turn <HI>Fakier</HI>) yet Ge∣nerous,
of a free open Temper, neither Jealous nor Lazy, as the
<HI>Moors</HI> most are; but applying himself to several Handicrafts, which he
has learned of the <HI>Europeans;</HI> he is learned too in the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Ara∣bick</HI>
Languages, though not to Vain-glory; being so Humble, Face∣tious,
and Merry, that nothing but Spight and Envy can disagree
with him: His Name is <HI>Nishambeak;</HI> such another I have not met
with, so general a lover of <HI>Franks;</HI> which he specified in an espe∣cial
manner to me, receiving me in an Airy Banquetting-house,
Embellished and Adorned on purpose; and notwithstanding the Go∣vernor's
Son was to pay his Compliments, would not suffer me to
give him Place, but diverted me with several Interludes of <HI>Morisco</HI>
Dancing. That which took most with them I perceived, was a Jester,
or Mimick, the Ancient Salt at publick Banquets, as we may gather
from <HI>Statius:</HI>
<Q><L>Non ego Mercatus Phariâ de puppe Loquaces</L>
<L>Delicias, doctumque sui convicia Nili</L>
<L>Infantem, Linguâque simul salibusque protervum.</L></Q></P>
<P>And from <HI>Lucan</HI> to <HI>Piso:</HI>
<Q><L>Sed Miserum (clientem) parvâ stipe numerat</L>
<L>—ut pudibundas</L>
<L>Exercere sales inter convivia possit.</L></Q></P>
<P>Having feasted the Fancy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feasted by the Governor's Order.</NOTE> he contends to cloy the Stomach, with
loads of <HI>Viands</HI> stowed in Plate, serving me with his own Hands,
his Friends and he being content to feed on the desire they had to
satisfy me, not being to be courted to fall to till I had done; they
served me with variety of Stews and Baked Meats, but offered me
<HI>Sherbet</HI> only for Drink; I had provided against this chance by fil∣ling
my <HI>Metarrah</HI> with Beveridge, which passed for Water, being
drunk out of a Leather Bottle Tipped with Silver, for Travel.</P>
<P>After Dinner they made their loud Musick proclaim my going
to the Governor (whereat flocked all the <HI>Gur</HI>) and after formal
Salutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">None appear before Great Men without a Present.</NOTE> present him with a Glass of Chymical Spirits. As the
<HI>Parthians</HI> were wont not to receive Visits without a Gift; <HI>Et exem∣pla

<P>I was placed close by him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How strange our Arms and Apparel seem to them.</NOTE> he like an Hermit, having the Court
brought to him, admired the Splendour as well as the Novelty of
our <HI>Europe</HI> Dress; asking my Servant if I lay in them, because it is
their fashion not to undress to go to Bed, but lye in the same Clothes
they wear in the day; he made me declare the use of my Rapier, at

first not apprehending it so serviceable as their Broad Two-handed
Swords; 'twas a Question out of my road, yet I made him under∣stand
our Custom in War was to appear all armed Cap-a-pee, where
their Broad Swords would find a rebate; whereas these Sharp-pointed
Weapons would pierce the Junctures of the Harness, or the Pleats of
a Coat of Mail (they denying a Stab to be more mortal than a
Slash). He was very inquisitive about our Military Discipline; and
heard it with pleasure. He called all his Male Children about him,
who sate at his Feet, and gave me an History of their Maladies; as
most here did that durst speak, there being an infinite number of
Captains and Grave Fellows: The Old Men mended their Eyes with
Spectacles, the young marred theirs with staring.</P>
<P>The <HI>Choultry</HI> was hung with Green and Red Velvet checkered;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Permitted the freedom of the Castle.</NOTE> his
Pawn Boxes were large, and of Massy Gold; his Retinue grave, his
Carriage affable; he gave me a Bow-Ring off his Thumb, of Cash∣mire
(of equal value as Vertue, being a Charm against Thunder)
and the liberty to take a Round about the Castle, never before granted
any not listed in his Service: A <HI>Portuguez Mestizo,</HI> Chief Gunner
of the Castle, was very officious, though I was entrusted to the
charge of his prime Eunuch.</P>
<P>The first Object busied me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bold At∣tempt of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Men.</NOTE> was a Place <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Men had at∣tempted
to scale, by me esteemed a desperate Design, and very im∣probable;
yet two Men got up, and a Stone casually tumbling, de∣terred
their Accomplices, leaving them a Sacrifice to the Governor
and Women, who being left alone to the defence of the Castle (all
the Men deserting on the approach of a vast Army of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s)
hurled them down the Mountain for their rash Adventure; con∣firming
to me by a great Stone let fall, the unavoidableness of their
destruction; it running with that force where-ever it came, that it
beat all a-fore, till it rested in the middle of the Valley.</P>
<P>It is stored with Granaries hewed out of Stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Granaries for Stores now, formerly Re∣ligious Cells.</NOTE> I suppose for Re∣ligion's
sake at first, being too delicately engraved for the present
use; though there be several <HI>Tanks</HI> filled with Butter of 400 years
standing, prized by the <HI>Gentiles</HI> as high as Gold, prevalent in Old
Aches, and Sore Eyes, one of which was opened for my sake, and a
Present made me of its black stinking and viscous Balsom: There
are other <HI>Tanks</HI> or Cisterns for Water, which look nastily, Green,
Yellow, and Red, being distilled in the Rains, and in the Heats
evaporated to a Consistency; in some of these <HI>Gurs</HI> the Water is so
bad, that they use Onions to correct its unsavoriness. (Garlick in∣deed
with us is called the Countryman's Treacle).</P>
<P>They have Provisions for a Seven Years Siege for a Thousand Fa∣milies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Rajah</HI> slain the occasion of a Barbarous Funeral.</NOTE>
but no other Ammunition than Stones, excepting two un∣shapen
<HI>Sakers</HI> of Two and twenty Foot long, with a narrow Bore of
Brass of <HI>Gentu</HI> Mould, at each end one, on huge winding Carriages; one
of which at random killed a <HI>Rajah</HI> some four Months ago, when <HI>Seva</HI>
was encamped about <HI>Jeneah</HI> slinging a Bullet two Course off; which
Shot caused a Bonfire of a couple of his Ladies, beside other Dome∣sticks;
one of each sort to attend him in another World, as his
Chief Physician, Barber, Washerman, Horse-keeper, and the like,
to the number of Twenty odd; a thing as customary at the death of
<PB N="138" REF="88"/>
any great <HI>Rajah,</HI> as 'tis for the Wife of every <HI>Gentue</HI> of note at the
death of her Husband.</P>
<P>By this fatal Instrument of Mortality stood the remaining part of
the Tower the Thunder had cleft in twain: Near where a <HI>Dutch</HI>
Apostate has a wretched Dwelling, enjoying a Pair of Wives, the
miserable Tools who induced him to this lamentable Condition, that
he is despised and slighted by them all; few of those that endure Cir∣cumcision
meeting with better fortune.</P>
<P>Having taken my full view,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Took leave of the Governor.</NOTE> and returning to give the Governor
Thanks for this freedom, I met him as he came from Prayers
through a Lane of Soldiers, followed by a Crowd of his Domesticks,
when taking my leave, he ordered my release, being ushered with
the same State down as I came up, leaving him Prisoner in his strong
Hold.</P>
<P>Hence might be beheld many Dens and Caverns, fondly believed
to be carved and cut out of the Rocks by some Divine Power; having
no account of their original. Indeed they are miraculous; And I am
apt to judge, the pious Zeal of former Ages, when undisturbed in
their Tranquility, thinking the greatest labour too little to express
their love to a Deity, set them upon such imployments, more than
that they could promise to themselves any security from these Places;
which though the Passages to them be difficult, yet they are gene∣rally
unprovided of Human Necessaries; This Hill being only inde∣pendent,
whereby it stands out against all the opposite Forts of <HI>Seva
Gi,</HI> many of whom in a still Night may be heard by Voice, but more
by Trumpets.</P>
<P>Here are a Thousand Sword-men in pay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This <HI>Gur</HI> puts a stop to <HI>Seva Gi</HI> this way.</NOTE> no Horse or Elephant be∣ing
able to climb it: It was never fairly taken, the Governor is one
of approved Fidelity; the <HI>Mogul</HI> having not the like Fort in all his
Kingdoms, and is of main concern to the <HI>Frontiers;</HI> putting a stop
to <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s progress, otherwise likely to overrun <HI>Duccan.</HI> His name
is <HI>Hagiess Caun,</HI> originally a <HI>Brachmin,</HI> now a strict <HI>Musleman;</HI> some
years past Governor of the City, when oppressing the Poor, their
Cries reaching the King's Ears, he was translated hither, in conside∣ration
of his good Service; where he receives a liberal Pension, and
is at no Expence, which agrees well enough with his covetous Hu∣mour;
which Humour of his <HI>Seva Gi</HI> being informed of, left no
means unattempted to gain the Surrender of his Trust; promising
Mountains of Gold in exchange of this, which he scrupled not to
receive; appointing a day for the delivery of it to <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> if he
sent 7000 to take possession; who keeping touch, met with the
same measure he had meated to others, they being all surprised by
an Ambuscado from <HI>Badur Caun,</HI> whom the Governor had advertised
of all the Transactions.</P>
<P>That which makes <HI>Seva Gi</HI> so intent on this more than the fore∣mentioned
Advantages,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jeneah Gur</HI> the Birth-place of <HI>Seva Gi.</HI></NOTE> is, because it was his Birth-place; to whom
that of <HI>Virgil</HI> is applicable,
<Q><L>Non tibi diva parens generis, nec Dardanus author</L>
<L>Perfide: Sed duris genuit te cautibus ingens</L>
<L>Jenneah; Duccanaeque admôrunt ubera tigres.</L></Q>
<PB N="139" REF="88"/>
What makes it more famous, it was anciently the Seat Royal of the
<HI>Duccan</HI> Kings, under whom <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Father was Keeper; but <HI>Auren∣zeeb</HI>
in his Conquest of this Kingdom (after he had fled hither for
protection) had it surrendred unto him: It is reckoned two Course
and an half in height; is surrounded, though a good way off, with
Hills, all but towards the <HI>North,</HI> where it seems to stand Captain of
the Mountains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moguls</HI> I perceive are inclinable to the like Credulity the
<HI>Gentues</HI> are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Moors</HI> toucht <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Supersti∣tion of the <HI>Gentues.</HI></NOTE> pointing out a Mount where undoubtedly <HI>Solomon</HI> gave
Audit to the two Women claiming the same Child, and pronounced
Judgment in favour of the true Mother; and it still bears the name
of <HI>Tecta Schelimon, Solomon</HI>'s Throne; I brought Night with me to
<HI>Jeneah,</HI> being too well guarded to suspect any Attempt; though
notable enough by the multitudes of Oily Flambeaus.</P>
<P>This Day gave me occasion to take notice of the sneaking Offici∣ousness
of the <HI>Banyans,</HI> who pressed on my Heels, and where-ever I
went, waited like Lacquies, which put me in mind of that Distich
of <HI>Martial</HI>'s,
<Q><L>Lecticam sellamque sequor, nec ferre recuso</L>
<L>Per medium properans, sed prior ire tutum.</L></Q></P>
<P>The New Moon brought the Soldiers to their several Standards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Luscar∣ry</HI> or Army.</NOTE>
against the Governor's House, by their <HI>Salam</HI> to refresh his Memory of
their Pay, being Fourteen Months behind-hand. Pay, says <HI>Tacitus,</HI> is
the Cause of Soldiers, and Money is the Cause of Pay; which is not
wanting to the Muster-masters, who abuse the common Troopers in
retarding it; to the end, that having run into debt, they might
compound for half their Wages in ready Money; for all which they
leave not often their Side, for they are sure of something with ease,
whereas <HI>Seva Gi</HI> is a kind of Free-booter, whose Maxim is, No Plun∣der,
no Pay; which comes with pain and hazard: Yet it is common
for him to have <HI>Moors</HI> in his Army; for the Liberty of their Country
is not stood so much upon, as <HI>Whose Salt they eat</HI> (their own
Phrase); so that you may see <HI>Gentues</HI> in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Army, as well
as <HI>Moguls</HI> among the <HI>Gentues:</HI> For the most part of the Body of the
Cavalry consists of <HI>Moguls,</HI> the Infantry of <HI>Gentues,</HI> with Match-Lock
Muskets.</P>
<P>In order to this Convention every Petty Officer brings the number
of his Men and Horse along with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Appear∣ance.</NOTE> who first salute him, and he
the Governor, owning none else for their Commander, though they
fall off under such an Ensign as they are ordered to march with: They
are taught little more than the Grand Paw, and to make a Salam:
They ride in wide Saddles as our War Saddles, but hold with the
Calves of their Legs, not fasten themselves to their Saddles by their
Thighs, as we do; by which slight they raise themselves to mow
down their Enemies, and will cast a Spear, and take it up from the
Ground on full speed: They stop with a jerk, not taking their Horses
up by degrees, which they laugh at us for, as well as our riding with
our Feet at length: They have no Spurs to their Heels, but in their
<PB N="140" REF="89"/>
Bridle-bit is one to stop the most untamed Horse, or bore his Mouth
through, pointing out of a Circle upon their Tongues.</P>
<P>They have other excellent Qualities; as he that runs fastest, is the
best Soldier: Besides, their Arms are kept so bright, they are afraid
to handle them for fear of soiling them: Their Leaders are good
Carpet-Knights, loving their <HI>Buchannos</HI> better than the Field.</P>
<P>The old <HI>Roman</HI> Discipline takes place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Disci∣pline.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> Commanders of Tens,
so of Hundreds, thence to Legions; and accordingly receive their
Salary, making their own Terms with those under them: The Go∣vernor
distributing to the Officers, and they to the Soldiers, every
one having their Snips; that never was more truly verified that Pro∣verb,
<HI>Half the King's Cheese goes away in Parings.</HI></P>
<P>The Grandees of the Army appear with their Furniture of Silver
and Gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nders rich∣ly accoutred.</NOTE> on <HI>Persian, Arab,</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> Steeds; the rest rarely get
any other than the Race of the Country, which are Fiery and Met∣tlesome,
but very Flashy, probably because they pinch Their Bellies
to put into their Own.</P>
<P>And now the Rains began to urge me to take my Leave of the
<HI>Caun</HI> of <HI>Jeneah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I take my leave of the <HI>Caun.</HI></NOTE> which I did in a full Assembly convocated for the
purpose; where I was informed Two hundred of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Men had
pursued me almost to <HI>Ambegaum,</HI> with a resolution to have carried me
back, but durst come no further, for the Report of the Army being
in Motion; wherefore the <HI>Naibob</HI> advised me to take another way,
and a select Guard of his should attend me to the utmost Extent of
his Territories; after which he dismissed me very honourably, with
a Letter to the President, which is not sealed on the Paper, but in a
Neat Bag of Cloath of Gold or Silver.</P>
<P>This <HI>Naibob Mucklis Caun</HI> lives not in that Splendor the Governor
of <HI>Surat</HI> does, though he have ten times the Salary, being liable to
the daily Assaults of <HI>Seva Gi;</HI> but he exceeds in Command, being
Absolute, without any Dependance on the General; which causes
an Emulation on either side, and the more, because the <HI>Mogul</HI> has
lately heaped new Honours on <HI>Badur Caun,</HI> doubling his Stipend,
and giving him the Title of Foster Brother, his Mother nursing the
King: But this Governor, to equalize him in Wealth, keeps but half
the alotted Number in Pay, and lives sparingly, which makes him
take Sanctuary with regret sometimes under <HI>Badur Caun,</HI> he being
always upon the Forlorn Hope.</P>
<P>This Cheat is practi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all over the Realm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">False Musters the Practice of <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> notwithstanding here
are Publick Notaries placed immediately by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gul,</HI> to give No∣tice
of all Transactions; which they are sure to represent in favour
of the Governors where they reside, being Fee'd by them, as well
as Paid by the Emperor; so that if a Defeat happen, it is extenua∣ted;
if a Victory, it is magnified to the height: Those in this Of∣fice
are called <HI>Vocanoveces.</HI></P>
<P>The Government of this Place is as in all other Cities of the <HI>Mo∣guls.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Govern∣ment and Commodities.</NOTE>
The Walls are broken down, but the Gates are still remain∣ing:
With the City's Safeguard Trade is fled, though it be commo∣diously

<P><PB N="141" REF="89"/>
The Buzzars therefore consist chiefly of Provisions, which they
compel the Country to bring in, and sometimes take them by Force,
by reason of the general Poverty reigning among them.</P>
<P>Wherefore the 22<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> I left them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returned by <HI>Nunny Gaot,</HI> or the little Hill.</NOTE> and took my Way by
<HI>Nunny Gaot,</HI> or the Little Hill in respect of the other, which we
saw mounted a prodigious height above us: Hither I came by twelve
a Clock at Noon, a far shorter and easier Way than the other: It is
ten Course from <HI>Jeneah,</HI> wherein we travelled between a Couple of
<HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Castles; and overlooking the <HI>Gaot,</HI> is a third very like <HI>Je∣neah
Gur,</HI> which hailed us; I sent one to answer them, but kept on
my Course till I came to the <HI>Gaot,</HI> where I was constrained to bestow
more time th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n I was willing, 300 Oxen laden with Salt (which is
so precious up the Country, as to be proverbially preferred to Bread,
they saying, <HI>Whose Salt they eat,</HI> as we, <HI>Whose Bread,</HI>) stopping
the Gap; but with a little Intreaty, after an hour's standing still in
the Sun, I got them, by sending my <HI>Peons,</HI> to desist below, till we
had widen'd the Pass above; after which it is feasible, being sup∣plied
at fit distances with charitable Cisterns of good Water, and to∣wards
the bottom adorned with beautiful Woods, delighting as well
as refreshing us with the Shade: By Sunset I was in the Plain, where
an honest <HI>Subidar</HI> that took off his Liquor, let me pass without trou∣ble,
being more like a Scout than a Set-Watch.</P>
<P>Nor do I believe the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Army dare venture to advance be∣tween
these Streights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Army likely to pass this way.</NOTE> which are so well maintain'd; but farther
<HI>North</HI> the Hills seem to stoop more to the Plain, and it may be that
Way they may pass; though this Way be tolerable for <HI>Caphala's</HI> and
Merchants who have their Passports.</P>
<P>We reckon to have measured this Day Fifteen Course, most in
the Heat of the Day, to the side of a poor Village called <HI>Wesnure,</HI>
where we rested under a Tree, the <HI>Coolies</HI> being unprovided for;
nor could they purchase any thing here, the Inhabitants being hared
out of their Wits, mistrusting even their own Countrymen as well as
Strangers, living as it were wildly, betaking themselves to the Thick∣ets
and Wildernesses among the Hills, upon the approach of any new
Face; for my Horse by chance breaking loose, set a whole <HI>Gom</HI> or
Town upon the hoof, they thinking <HI>Auren Zeeb</HI>'s Luscarry at hand;
thus unhappily live these, a Prey to every one.</P>
<P>The Clouds had spread themselves over the Tops of the Hills,
that they seemed to make a <HI>Ne plus ultra,</HI> or the World's-End.</P>
<P>The next Day at Twelve a Clock at Noon we struck into our old
Road at <HI>Moorbar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Glistering Flies about a Tree, scare the Coolies.</NOTE> from whence before we were misguided; we
packed hence by Five in the Afternoon, and left our Burnt Wood on
the Right-hand, but entred another made us better Sport, deluding
us with false Flashes, that you would have thought the Trees on a
Flame, and presently, as if untouch'd by Fire, they retained their
wonted Verdure. The <HI>Colies</HI> beheld the Sight with Horror and
Amazement, and were consulting to set me down, and shift for them∣selves;
whereof being informed, I cut two or three with my Sword,
and by breathing a Vein, let <HI>Shitan▪</HI> (the Devil) out, who was crept
into their Fancies, and led them as they do a startling Jade, to smell
to what their Wall-Eyes represented amiss; where we found an Host
<PB N="142" REF="90"/>
of Flies, the Subject both of our Fear and Wonder, which the sultry
Heat and Moisture had generated into Being, the certain Prodromus
of the ensuing Rain, which follow'd us from the Hills.</P>
<P>This gave my Thoughts the Contemplation of that Miraculous
Bush crowned with Innocent Flames, that gave to <HI>Moses</HI> so pleasant
and awful a Prospect; the Fire that consumes every thing, seeming
rather to dress than offend it.</P>
<P>Thus we came to <HI>Barfta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Forc'd to keep Watch against the Wild Beasts.</NOTE> a despicable Country Town, Seven
Course more; it is in possession of the <HI>Combies,</HI> who are not strong
enough to aid their Herds against the devouring Jaws of the Wild

they lodged me in; wherefore they caution<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> me to keep
Fires all Night, lest the Horse might lose one of his Quarters, or
our Oxen might serve them for a Supper; I added to the Fires a
strict Watch, whose mutual answering each other in an high Tone,
was deafen'd by the Roarings of Tigres, Cries of Jackals, and Yel∣lings
of <HI>Baloos,</HI> or over-grown Wolves: At Cock-crow (the Lions
Charm) we parted hence, and observed the Sheds here were round,
thatch'd, and lined with broad Leaves of <HI>Teke</HI> (the Timber Ships
are built with), in fashion of a Bee-hive: These <HI>Combies</HI> are the
Wood-men. About Seven we overtook our deep Creek, and being
somewhat swelled by the Rains, we followed its Current till we
found it passable; about Eleven we returned to <HI>Gullean.</HI></P>
<P>The Hardship these poor <HI>Combies</HI> undergo was obvious to the sense
of the very <HI>Coolies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Coolies</HI> Reflections on the Miseries of these People.</NOTE> who often in this Journy would reflect on their own
Happiness under the <HI>English</HI> Government; those being all so harass'd,

and therefore both unsafe and uncomfortable Journeying for Tra∣vellers.
I took up my Station where I was before, and sent my Man
to the <HI>Havaldar</HI> to complain of the Treachery of the Guides; he
professed he was asham'd, but a new Governor being since put over
his Head, with the Command of a Party of Horse, he was incapable
of punishing them; yet for what further Courtesy he was able to do
he was ready, and to that end sent to the <HI>Subidar</HI> for his License for
a Boat, which now are all pluck'd up and housed ashore, the Rains
more than approaching, so that it was troublesome procuring one;
but by their joint Power it was at last atchieved; which a cross∣grain'd
<HI>Brachmin,</HI> supported by an outlaw'd <HI>Portugal,</HI> contradicted in
despight of both, seizing it by Force with Three Files of Soldadoes.</P>
<P>For which cause I was tied to the Consort of croaking Frogs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prodigious great Frogs.</NOTE> ma∣king
so hideous a Noise, that I took little Rest this Night: When
Day broke I could hardly believe my Eyes, for Bulk, or Ears, for Sound,
exceeding ours incredibly; and to raise the Wonder, this Night was
the first of the Rains, before which none were heard: Wherein <HI>Pliny</HI> may

as unusual a Prospect attracted my Animadversion; a great Tree full
of stringy red Flowers, set in open Calices upon a long Stalk, like
budding Grapes; which before the Sun had collected much force,
I saw begin to fall in showers upon the Ground; desiring to handle one
Bough, I observed them fixed; still they upon the Tree dropped till
all was shedded, and the Ground strewed with them, which a <HI>Brach∣min</HI>
carefully gathered up to reserve for a Physical use; but more
truly out of Superstition, paying Rent for the Privilege: This
Wonder is renewed daily, they Blossoming in the Night, and con∣trary
almost to all other Plants, are disgusted with the Sun-beams,
drooping in the day; which is like the <HI>Arbor Tristis</HI> at St. <HI>Thomas</HI>

brought to die among the Tombs in my sight; pretended to be done
to avoid the Governor's troubling the Family (where she lived a

<HI>Egyptians</HI> brought not their Sick to Physicians, but laid them in the
Streets and publick Passages, that the People passing by might be
consulted for their Cure.</P>
<P>Every Third Hour I had the din of a Man of God of the <HI>Moors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Moor-men</HI> Priests follow Trades.</NOTE>
permitted to come hither to call them to Prayers; as he cried aloud
he stopped his Ears with his Fingers, that he might emit his Voice
with the more strength, and less disturbance to himself; experience
thereby directing us to hear our own Sounds the better; and some
Anatomists tell us, Nature has framed a Cartilaginous passage from
the hollow of the Drum of the Ear, to the process of the outward
part of the cuneal Bone reaching to the Palat, which being open
may possibly divert the Noise; but whether this do help, or is un∣derstood
by them, yet this they do Practise; and this Afternoon
their <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum</HI> was open, the Priest entring in Barefoot and
Prostrating himself on the Mats spread on the Floor, whither I must

not have gone, could his Authority have kept me out; the Walls
were white and clean, but plain, only the Commandments, wrote in
<HI>Arabick</HI> in the <HI>West-end,</HI> were hung on a Table over an Arched Place,
where the Priest Expounds on an Ascent of Seven Steps, railed at top
with Stone very handsomely: It is supported within with Four sub∣stantial
Pillars of Timber well carved, the Roof all Wood, with a square
Hole over the Pulpit: Underneath are fine cool Vaults, and Stone
Stairs to descend to a deep Tank, where this Priest was following the
Occupation of making such Paper as they use; which after he had
steeped Cotton Rags in Water, he by beating brought it into the form of
Paper; and cutting them, or slicing the Mass into Sheets, was past∣ing
them up on the Stone-sides of the Mosque, next the Sun, to dry;
after which they are polished and glazed, and so made fit for their use.</P>
<P>In the Evening I saw the reason of our stay this day;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pragmatical <HI>Portugal</HI> hin∣dred me Em∣barking.</NOTE> a Pragma∣tical
<HI>Portugal</HI> fled to this Place, for designing the death of a <HI>Fidalgo</HI>

Guard to his Body, he has a Bloudy Leash of <HI>Cofferies</HI> imployed to be
revenged on his Antagonist at <HI>Baçein;</HI> here he acts without Controle,
and is about to accept of Pay under <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> he being courted there∣to,

disburthened of her Lading, and I Embarqued, and the 26th of <HI>May</HI>

we might the easier make <HI>Seva Gi</HI> comply; and more than that,
find Lordships for <HI>Englishmen,</HI> where they might live contentedly,

<P>THE Pleasure you express on the Receipt of Mine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. I.</NOTE> makes
me continue your Invited Trouble, as truly not enjoy∣ing
any thing till I know your Sentiments; and there∣fore
is it, next the quieting your Concern for my Life in

I have had Opportunities to expatiate.</P>
<P>And now the Rains are over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The President goes to <HI>Surat,</HI></NOTE> and Friendship concluded as well

<P>After some time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I to <HI>Carwar. Seva Gi</HI>'s Na∣val Power.</NOTE> Curiosity more than Business tempted me to go
with the Chief of <HI>Carwar,</HI> that I might see <HI>Goa.</HI> In our Pas∣sage

of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s defended a deep Bay, where rode his Navy,
consisting of 30 Small Ships and Vessels, the Admiral wearing a

<P><PB N="146" REF="92"/>
Arriving at <HI>Carwar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter IV.</NOTE> and the Chief going ashore, he was met on
the River by the Governor with two Barges; and landing, was wel∣comed
by the Ordnance of the <HI>English</HI> House.</P>
<P><HI>Carwar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Arms have Con∣quer'd all round <HI>Carwar.</HI></NOTE> what remains of it, is under the New Conquest of <HI>Seva
Gi,</HI> being lately, with <HI>Anchola, Pundit, Cuderah</HI> and <HI>Semissar,</HI> brought
under (though all of them very Strong Places): At which time the
<HI>English</HI> were moulding a Fortification, or House of Defence, for their
own safety, when by the Assistance of a Small Pink they defended
themselves from all Hostile Mischances; and though their Town
was wholly laid in Ashes, yet they built this their stately Mansion
Four-square, guarded by Two Bulwarks at the Commanding Corners
of the House: In the mean while <HI>Seva Gi</HI> made himself Master of
<HI>Carwar</HI> Castle, together with the rest, the Inhabitants flying to the
Woods and Hills for shelter: Thus it continues not without daily
disturbance from these <HI>Sylvans</HI> and <HI>Mountaineers,</HI> the commiserated
Subjects of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> who often make an Head and fall upon them;
by which means the Government is unsetled, and the Governors
shift from Place to Place.</P>
<P>Our House stands on a delicate Mead (on the Ground of ****
<HI>Cutteen</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ground our House stands on granted by the King.</NOTE> a <HI>Cornish</HI> Gentleman, who had it by grant from the
King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> being impowered by a Claim of his Countrymen
to the Right of Trading to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> but long since left off)
Seated on an Arm of the River, surveying a pleasant Island stored
with Game: The Castle is nearer the Hills, and higher up the
Streams; about a League off the Sea the Hills guard the Plain till
they make a Bank against the Ocean.</P>
<P><HI>Seva</HI> in his Government imitates the <HI>Moors</HI> in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seva</HI> governs by <HI>Brachmins.</HI></NOTE> appointing a
distinct Governor here for Town and Castle, and over all these a
Commander with a Flying Army, who is Superintendent: Into
Places of Trust and Authority he puts only <HI>Brachmins,</HI> or their Sub∣stitutes,
<HI>viz. Pundits,</HI> (a mean cast) for Physicians; <HI>Sfosdars</HI> or Cen∣turions▪
<HI>Subidars, Havaldars,</HI> Civil Governors, Generals or Fight∣ing
Bishops; of whom truly may be said, <HI>Privata cuique stimulatio
vile decus publicum.</HI> They are neither for Publick Good or Common
Honesty, but their own private Interest only: They refuse no Base
Offices for their own Commodity, inviting Merchants to come and
trade among them, and then rob them, or else turmoil them on ac∣count
of Customs; always in a Corner getting more for them∣selves
than their Master, yet openly must seem mighty zealous for
their Master's Dues: So that Trade is unlikely to settle where he hath
any thing to do; notwithstanding his Country lies all along on the
Sea-shore, and no Goods can be transported without his Permission;
unless they go a great way about, as we are forced to do.</P>
<P>It is a General Calamity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hard Usage of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Sub∣jects.</NOTE> and much to be deplored, to hear the
Complaints of the poor People that remain, or are rather compelled
to endure the Slavery of <HI>Seva Gi:</HI> The <HI>Desies</HI> have Land imposed up∣on
them at double the former Rates, and if they refuse to accept it
on these hard Conditions (if Monied Men) they are carried to Pri∣son,
there they are famished almost to death; racked and tortured
most inhumanly till they confess where it is: They have now in
Limbo several <HI>Brachmins,</HI> whose Flesh they tear with Pincers heated
<PB N="147" REF="92"/>
Red-hot, drub them on the Shoulders to extreme Anguish, (though
according to their Law it is forbidden to strike a <HI>Brachmin.</HI>) This
is the accustomed Sawce all <HI>India</HI> over, the Princes doing the same
by the Governors, when removed from their Offices, to squeeze
their ill-got Estates out of them; which when they have done, it
may be they may be employ'd again: And after this fashion the <HI>De∣sies</HI>
deal with the <HI>Combies;</HI> so that the Great Fish prey on the Little,
as well by Land as by Sea, bringing not only them, but their Fa∣milies
into Eternal Bondage.</P>
<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distractions of the King∣dom of <HI>Visia∣pour.</HI></NOTE> under the King of <HI>Visiapour</HI> the Taxations were much
milder, and they lived with far greater comfort; but since the
Death of the late King, his Son being in Minority, and the King∣dom
left to a Protector, the Nobles, who held their Provinces as Feu∣datories
or rather Vassals of him, begin to withdraw their Duty;
<HI>Bullul Caun,</HI> General under the Protector <HI>Cowis Caun,</HI> an <HI>Hobsy,</HI>
or <HI>Arabian Coffery</HI> (they being preferred here to Chief Employ∣ments,
which they enter on by the Name of <HI>Siddies</HI>) having but
the other day set upon the Protector and assassinated him; who was
so terrible to <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Men, that to render him the more dreadful,
they speak of his <HI>Hobsies</HI> after this manner, That with their Swords
they are able to cut down Man and Horse: That greater Commoti∣ons
than yet have happened, are to be expected in this Kingdom; not
only <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> but the <HI>Mogul</HI> at this time bidding for the Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Bullul Caun</HI> is a good Soldier, and a <HI>Patan;</HI> yet as much envied by
the <HI>Duccan</HI> Princes, as <HI>Cowis Caun</HI> was by him; whereupon it be∣hoves
him to be watchful of their Motions, to which Vigilancy
adding Expedition, he yet keeps them from joining Forces: Where
leaving him on his Guard, I will present you with a small Taste of
the Condition of the People about us, which fell out the Day before
I set out for <HI>Goa,</HI> being desirous to be present at the <HI>Natal.</HI></P>
<P>Early in the Morning came <HI>Delvi</HI>'s Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miserable Condition of the Inhabi∣tants, betwixt the <HI>Desy</HI> and <HI>Seva Gi.</HI></NOTE> 500 in Company;
whereupon <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Men being but 100 Foot, and 25
Horse, retired into the Castle; miserable Souls for Soldiers on both
sides; they look'd like our old <HI>Britains,</HI> half naked, and as fierce,
where all lies open before them: They had a loud Noise of Musick,
and a tumultuous Throng of People, and thus they marched on
without any Order, till they encamped near our House: Their
Leader was a Man of a good Presence, but a Rogue, an <HI>Hindu</HI> by
Birth, a Soldier by Education; making this his Maxim, <HI>Ibi Fas ubi
maxima Merces:</HI> There is the greatest Right where is the best Pay.</P>
<P>At Noon, by the Hurly-burly of all Ranks of Men, Women,
and Children, with what little Substance they had, flying under our
Guns for Succour, we were given to understand <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Men were
in Motion (whom they dread more than the other); but on ap∣pearance
of the <HI>Desy</HI>'s <HI>Grob</HI> they retreated again: This <HI>Desy</HI> is one
that was <HI>Rendero</HI> of all this Country, under the King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI>
and had 1000 Men under him (of whom <HI>Delvi</HI> was Chief); but
being entrapped by his Subtilties, whom he least suspected (being
raised by him), he was forced to subscribe to the Power of <HI>Seva;</HI>
of whom <HI>Delvi</HI> not having his Ends, he turns about, and does pro∣mise
to set his former Master in Possession once more. At Night we
<PB N="148" REF="93"/>
had Letters (for you must know both Parties <HI>Salam</HI> to us, being in
so strong an House, else we should be liable to their Fury), That
<HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Party of Horse, whilst <HI>Delvi</HI> had passed the River, seized
his Baggage, which was left guarded by 60 Men, whereof he ha∣ving
Notice, soon overtakes them, and causes them to surrender
their Booty, driving them to the Castle, with the loss of two of
their Horses, and one <HI>Cavaleiro</HI> slain: Under these Circumstances
these Folks are left to struggle, without hope of Relief from <HI>Visia∣pour,</HI>
they being all to pieces there.</P>
<P>The next Morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Take Barge for <HI>Goa;</HI> where we found the Passes well guarded.</NOTE> in the Company's <HI>Baloon</HI> of 16 Oars, with
seven <HI>Peons,</HI> two <HI>English</HI> Soldiers, two Factors, and my self, having
a Competency of Arms and Ammunition, with a small Piece a-head,
we set Sail for <HI>Goa.</HI> We had not gone far down the River, before we
met two Boats full of Men for a Supply to <HI>Seva Gi.</HI> Near Sun-set we
reached an Oyster-Rock, on which we landed, and fed plentifully,
being in their prime this cold Season; our Bargemen would frequent∣ly
dive 9 or 10 Minutes, and rise with great Lumps of Oysters clod∣ded
together, as big as a Man could well carry. The next Morn we
put into the River <HI>Sal,</HI> half way to <HI>Goa:</HI> At Three in the After∣noon
we entred the Mouth of <HI>Goa</HI> River, where in convenient Pla∣ces
stand four Forts and a Block-house, not only impassable by Wa∣ter,
but impregnable by Land; as the <HI>Dutch</HI> proved them twelve
Years together, having a Fleet riding constantly before them, and
for that time, while the <HI>Monsoons</HI> permitted, making continual As∣saults,
but with little Success: On the left, stored with Brass Pieces,
stands the <HI>Agoada,</HI> or the King's Aquaduct, running from the Top of
the highest Hill to the Water-side, where for a consierable Space is a
Platform of their chiefest Ordnance; facing this is the Fort and
Monastery of <HI>Nos Signior de Cabo,</HI> a pleasant as well as strong Cita∣del:
Beyond this, in a wide but dangerous Bay (so that what Boats
come in must pass the Channel under the Muzzles of the Guns)
stands <HI>Marmagoun,</HI> defending that Island and Bay: By the Bar is <HI>Roys
Magi</HI> on the Left, and <HI>Gasper de Dios</HI> on the Right: Before Sun-set
we came to Captain <HI>Gary</HI>'s House at <HI>Pangeim,</HI> over the Bar a Mile; a
Seat by reason of the Healthiness of the Air chosen by the <HI>Fidalgoes,</HI>
who have beautified it with their Summer-houses; the Viceroy ha∣ving
a Palace here, where he retires in the Heats and time of Ship∣ping:
<HI>Betu</HI> on the other side enjoys the same good Fortune.</P>
<P>The Eve to the Eve of the <HI>Natal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gallantry of the <HI>Portu∣gals,</HI> and ne∣glect of their <HI>Carracks.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Christmas,</HI> we came up the
River, adorned all along with stately Churches and Palaces; the Wa∣ter
circling with its Stream several Islets, and half-way up to the
City passes under a Bridge of 36 Arches of Stone; and from thence
runs a Causeway of Stone two Miles in length, admitting the Flood
only by two Sluces, into Wears or Dams made for Fish and Salt, and
ends with three Arches more: A little beyond which is depainted
on a Church, a Story of a Ship brought from <HI>Cape Bon Esperanzo,</HI>
hither in one Night, and fixed where the Church is now built, and
by that means helping them with Timber for the Roof, and two
Crosses set up as far off as the Ship was in length; whether true or
false, I ask no questions, for fear of the Inquisition, which here is a
terrible Tribunal. At Noon we came in view of <HI>Goa,</HI> not without
<PB N="149" REF="93"/>
the sight of a many Baloons passing to and again very swiftly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. II.</NOTE> it
being the greatest Pastime they have to Row against one another;
more bewitched with such outward Gallantry, than prompted on
to more Benficial Charges; their <HI>Europe</HI> Ships lying here neglected
till they rot for want of Cargo, Three great Carracks being ready
to drop in Pieces; notwithstanding they have small Trading
Ships in the River, and against the City, beside a Carrack under
the <HI>Agoada,</HI> which they send home this Year.</P>

<P>THE City of <HI>Goa</HI> looks well at a small distance, not being to
be seen far by reason of the adjacent Hills and windings of
the River; it is Ten Miles up the River, stands upon Seven Hills;
every where Colleges, Churches, and glorious Structures; it has
Gates to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch∣bishop's See,</NOTE> and a Wall; it is Modelled but rudely, many Houses dis∣gracing
it with their Ruins, the Streets interfereing most confusedly:
We were directed to a Tavern against the See, the Habitation of
the Archbishop of the Order of St. <HI>Bernard;</HI> which the Clergy here
mightily stomach, especially the Jesuits, who bend not to his Au∣thority,
having a Provost of their own,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Provost of the Jesuits.</NOTE> going in as great State as
the Archbishop; he appears abroad in a Sedan, and has Eight Cle∣rico's
on Foot Bareheaded, walking on each side, beside other At∣tendance:
The Cathedral is not often excelled by ours at home for
the bigness of the Pile; the Architecture but Plain, though very
Neat; the Altar and side Chappels filled with Images of delicate
Sculpture of our Blessed Saviour and the Virgin Mother, Gilded all
over with Gold.</P>
<P>From thence we were brought to the College of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The College of the <HI>Domi∣nicans</HI> the Seat of the Inquisi∣tor.</NOTE>
the Seat of the Inquisidor, who is always one of this Order; a mag∣nificent

the Church surpassed the Cathedral, the Pillars from top to
bottom being overlaid with a Golden Wash, and on the Walls the
Martyrology of their Order: In the <HI>Sacristan</HI> were Massy Silver Can∣dlesticks,

Years ago, leaving his Body a Miraculous Relick of his better part,
it still retaining its vivid Colour and Freshness, and therefore exposed
once a Year to publick view, on the Vespers of his Festival.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s was the first Monastery of the Jesuits in <HI>Goa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Je∣suits are called <HI>Paulistins.</HI></NOTE> from

either Clergy or Laity have here: (<HI>Por Amor de Frisco</HI>).</P>
<P>Of all Orders when they die they are Inhumed in the Habit of the
Order they belong to, without Coffins.</P>
<P>The Policy, as well as the Trade, of this place, is mostly de∣volved

is in every Body's Mouth;

<P>We saw several Seminaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Semi∣naries.</NOTE> or Schools, where the Students dispute

with Cords instead of Girdles about their Middles, Sandals instead of
Shoes; they wear Grey Broad brimmed Hats, as Countrymen do, as
well as Cowls abroad, their Habit being borrowed of the Rusticks;
they touch not Money, but carry one with them that will, and are
Mendicants.</P>
<P>The College of <HI>Carmelites</HI> is on an high Mount,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Carme∣lites.</HI></NOTE> prospecting the

<P>In our return we saw a Nunnery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Monacha</HI> a Nunnery.</NOTE> and the Nuns at their Devotion,
a Confessor through the Grates Reading Mass, and performing the

Vice-Roys that had been in <HI>East-India</HI> down to the present Vice-Roy:
At the upper end was the Canopy Royal and Chair of State; upon
information of our being there, we were introduced the Vice-Roys
Presence; he received us Standing, and after a little Confe∣rence,
dismissed us. A Proper Man, Courteous to Strangers, his
Name <HI>Lewis Mendosa de Albuquerque,</HI> newly created Marquess by the
King; in this Room was another Canopy of State, with the Arms of
<HI>Portugal.</HI> Coming into the Court-yard we saw some Men in Gowns,
like our Aldermen, the Emburgadors, or Council of the City,
going to attend the Vice-Roy to his Devotion at the Church of
<HI>Misericord,</HI> where was to be Presented a Pious Comedy; but their
Representations being too tedious, and the generality making Re∣ligion
the least of their business, not respecting either God or the
King, they made such a rout among the Women, that we were glad
to leave and Reimbark for our Lodgings.</P>
<P>At Night we were alarmed by a paultry Fellow that took our
House for his Sanctuary, being forced to it for his own Security;
the Soldiers assuming great license for want of Pay, and the <HI>Cofferies</HI>
for want of Victuals, so that every one walks the City with his
naked Sword in his Hand for his own defence at Evening; and now
within Doors, and in a Private House, we were forced to make our
Arms our Pillows.</P>
<P>The next day we passed the <HI>Bar</HI> for <HI>Vingula;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In our going to <HI>Vingula</HI> we Engage a <HI>Ma∣labar</HI> Pirate.</NOTE> half way we put
ashore to refresh our Men, and at Ten in the Morn set out again; by
Twelve we came close up with a <HI>Malabar</HI> that had seised a <HI>Grob,</HI> but
we soon made him yield his Prize to engage with us; which they
did briskly for Two hours, striving to board us, casting Stink-pots
among us, which broke without any Execution, but so frighted our
Rowers, that we were forced to be severe to restrain them; they
plied their Chambers and small Shot, and flung Stones, flourishing
their Targets and Darting Long Lances; they were well Manned in
a Boat ten times as big as our Barge, and at least Sixty fighting Men
besides Rowers; we had none to manage our small Gun, the Gunner
<PB N="152" REF="95"/>
running away at <HI>Goa</HI> after Sluts in Brothels: One of the Factors un∣dertaking
it, was blown up by a Cartrige of Power, and squenched
his Cloaths a-flame in the Ocean, so that they were fully bent to
board us; but they rising to come in, we all this while having sculk∣ed
under their Targets, discharged our Blunderbusses, which made
them sheer off, never to come near us again; after which we chased
them, they flying afore us.</P>
<P>The Spectators of this Encounter were the <HI>Dutch</HI> Chief and Go∣vernor
on the Shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They caress us ashore at <HI>Vin∣gula.</HI></NOTE> and a Ship of a dozen Guns in the Road; by
Three we came a-shore with slight Hurts, but cried up mightily by
the People, who are continually infested by these Pirats without any
Resistance: The <HI>Dutch</HI> receiv'd us at their Factory very kindly, whose
House is handsomely seated a Mile up a Shallow River, (except at
Spring Tides, when lusty Ships may come up); it is built upon Ar∣ches
Geometrically, by the present Chief, in the Figure of a <HI>Roman</HI> T,
all of Solid Stone; it is Trenched with a Square Trench, and de∣fended
by a Platform of Two Great Guns on every side, and Two Great
Bulwarks, bearing Smaller Guns at the Two Corners of the House;
the Front is <HI>Italian</HI> Fashion, passing to it over a Draw-Bridge; at
Night we walked into the Town, part of it lately destroyed by the
<HI>Syddy;</HI> where was a <HI>Buzzar,</HI> and a neat <HI>Choultry</HI> of the <HI>Dutch</HI>'s, and
beyond a Garden watered by a Fresh Stream, where we bathed: After
Supper they treated us with the Dancing Wenches, and good Soops
of Brandy and <HI>Delf</HI>'s Beer till it was late enough.</P>
<P>We went next day to the Governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monuments for Women burnt alive with their dead Hus∣bands.</NOTE> who Complimented us highly;
he is under the Tyrannical Government of <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> where all Bar∣barous
Customs are exercised; and here it is permitted the Women
not only to burn with their dead Husbands, but here are many Mo∣numents
raised in honour of them.</P>

<P>Our Factors having Concerns in the Cargo of the Ships in this
Road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Return from <HI>Vingula</HI> to <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE> loaded two <HI>Grobs</HI> and departed; I leaving them to prosecute
their Voyage, I put in at <HI>Goa</HI> again; and in Captain <HI>Gary</HI>'s <HI>Baloon</HI>
rowed round the Island over against <HI>Goa,</HI> where the Industry of the
<HI>Portugueze</HI> Ancestry is worthy of our commendation, in securing their
Land both from Water and their Enemies, by strong Banks and ne∣cessary
Block-Houses; <HI>Seva Gi</HI> possessing all against it, called <HI>Norway,</HI>
famous for Curtisans.</P>
<P>Hence I went to the King's Yard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Yard viewed.</NOTE> where lay half a Score Galeons

the King's Flag aloft as well as a Stern: The best of these carry no
more than Eight or Ten Small Pieces, and the rest fewer; over all
these there is a <HI>Generalissimo</HI> both by Sea and Land, who is <HI>John Corea
de Saw.</HI></P>
<P>Incited daily by New Wonders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Industry of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Ancestry.</NOTE> I intended to inviron the Island
of <HI>Goa;</HI> which is circled by High and Strong Walls, with Flankiers
on every winding of the River, besides Four or Five lusty Block-Houses,
commanding the whole Work, a thing of vast Compass and
Expence, striking through the heart of the Island; which is altoge∣ther
near Thirty Miles in Circumference, the Wall parting it in the
half: We passed as far as to the Fort of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> which is placed
conveniently to command the Mouth of the River from <HI>Marmagoun</HI>
Bay; we endeavoured farther, but Wind and Tide prevented us;
wherefore thinking it more facile to enterprise it on the other side,
we deferred it till another day: All the Land about <HI>Goa</HI> is divided in∣to
Islets, it lying in the heart of them: Whereupon the next day
that lay fair for our Design we came over the Bar, and sailed with a
favourable Wind into <HI>Marmagoun</HI> Bay; on the right part of it were
many pretty Caves, or small Bays, in one of whom rode near
twenty <HI>Grobs,</HI> loaden with Cocoe-Nuts, Cair, Salt and Salt Fish:
Beyond it half a League an Islet of <HI>Emanuel Lobos,</HI> fortified and main∣tained
in despight of the State, till lately reconciled.</P>
<P>From hence we parted to <HI>Old Goa</HI> on the main Island of <HI>Goa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A well weigh∣ed choice of an Harbour.</NOTE> which
with its various Creeks and Bays makes up the left side or Cod of the

Bay to be reckoned from the Head-lands or Out-guards, some Three
Leagues over, and <HI>Nos Segnior de Cabo</HI> a Commodious assistance to
them both by its well-placed Ordnance, easily reaching them on ei∣ther
<PB N="154" REF="96"/>
hand; but withal befriending <HI>Marmagoun,</HI> from which it is the
widest, with huge Stakes of Rocks hid under Water, that Vessels of
Burthen must either seek out the Channel or Shipwreck themselves,
or else force themselves on the Mouth of their Guns; a Fortunate and
well weighed Choise of a Port and Harbour: In our Course we saw
the bottom of the Bay meet with the River of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and a
Fleet of 30 <HI>Grobs</HI> more ready to receive their Lading; the Bay is
two, if not three Leagues deep; the truly Noble <HI>Aldeas</HI> of the <HI>Fidal∣gos,</HI>
the Temples and curiously wrought Crosses of the <HI>Ecclesiasticks,</HI>
striving on every open Strand and rising Hill to outshine one ano∣ther,
by their Whited Outsides, and Artificial and Delicate Adorn∣ments.</P>
<P>At our Landing the Sea bestowed a kind Murmur on the yielding
Sand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Goa.</NOTE> and cast us ashore in a Place quadrated more for still Retire∣ment,
than noisy Commerce; there lying before its Banks <HI>Canooses</HI>
belonging to Fishermen, and <HI>Baloons</HI> of Pleasure only; the <HI>Segnioros</HI>
minding nothing less than Merchandizing, and the <HI>Pover</HI> imploying
their Fish-hooks, and knitting-needles to get a Livelihood: So that
I presume <HI>Old Goa</HI> need not complain for the loss of Trade, which she
never had; nor lament the deprivation of Costly and Spacious Build∣ings,
which she never wanted; but hath them rather as a Country
Town (of whom she is the Dame) than City, though she might
claim the Title of Mistress; her Soil is Luxurious and Campaign, and
abounds with Rich Inhabitants, whose Rural Palaces are immured
with Groves and <HI>Hortos,</HI> refreshed and cooled with <HI>Tanks</HI> and Rivu∣lets;
but always reserve a graceful Front for the Street, which are
broad and cleanly at this time of Festivity, celebrating with Trium∣phant
Arches and most Pompous Pageants: <HI>Palenkeens</HI> pass as com∣monly
as at <HI>Goa</HI> it self, the People as urbane, though less pestered
with Drunken Comrades, as Soldiers, Seamen and Ruffians; the
Market place is stored with Provisions, and the Parish provided with
a large Church; but nothing antiquated as I could discover, by
which it is easy to judge <HI>Old Goa</HI> never was deserted; but <HI>Now Goa</HI>
hath stoln from hence for the sake of Traffick, for that purpose the
River is more suitable than this Bay; it may measure from one end to
the other, two Miles.</P>
<P>Abreast of it on an hanging Hill is a Sumptuous Structure of the
Capuchins called <HI>Sancto Pilar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sancto Pilar</HI> the Seat of the Capu∣chins.</NOTE> the Ascent to it is by a winding Stair∣case
cut out of the Rock, and Railed with Stone Banisters; this Or∣der
is discalceated also, and consanguineous to the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> differ∣ing

annexed a Lap-Fraternity, which wear the Mantle and Tippet, but

these Three Classes, <HI>viz. Patres,</HI> Fathers; <HI>Fratres,</HI> Brothers; <HI>Ju∣venes,</HI>

<P>Thus parted we from the comely <HI>Galataea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Way be∣twixt Old <HI>Goa</HI> and New <HI>Goa.</HI></NOTE> and bent our Addresses
toward the Courts of the stately <HI>Amarillis,</HI> whose Highways were
full of Travellers, Country Mansions, Villages, Churches, shady
<PB N="155" REF="96"/>
Stands, and Places to ease the Brawny Shoulders of the wearied
Slaves: Half Way is a School, where their <HI>Cofferies</HI> (which come
most from <HI>Mosambique,</HI> or <HI>Bombass</HI>) are taught to sound on Trum∣pets
and Loud Musick; a Gang of whom forced their Noise on us
along the Fields. A Mile wide of the City we entred a Gate that
was strong, to which the Wall is contingent, that compasses the
better Part of the Island together with the City.</P>
<P>From Old <HI>Goa</HI> it is three Miles: Within the Wall a fair Road
leads to the City; a little out of the Way is erected an high-wall'd
Well, and goes up Steps to a Pair of Gallows, whereon Malefactors
are left hanging till they drop into the Well, or the Birds prey on
them.</P>
<P>By Night we gained the Out-part of the City, boasting in as large
a Ruin of the <HI>Moors,</HI> as their own numerous standing Fabricks; ly∣ing
so in Obloquy of the hated <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who once made all
stoop, where the Christians have now advanced their Sacred Sign:
We quartered our selves this Evening in a Tavern kept by a <HI>Chinese,</HI>
who are White, Platter-fac'd, and Little-eyed, tolerated on account
of embracing Christianity; our <HI>Baloon</HI> met us, and coming round
by St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> was here before us.</P>
<P>Going the next Morning to the Palace-stairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Prisons and Executi∣ons.</NOTE> we saw their Sessions-house,
the bloody Prison of the Inquisition; and in a principal Mar∣ket-place
was raised an Engine a great height, at top like a Gibbet,
with a Pulley, with steppings to go upon, as on a Flag-staff, for the
<HI>Strapado,</HI> which unhinges a Man's Joints; a cruel Torture. Over-against
these Stairs is an Island, where they burn (after ex∣posing
them to the Multitude) all those condemned by the Inquisi∣tor,
which are brought from the <HI>Sancto Officio</HI> dress'd up in most
horrid Shapes of Imps and Devils, and so delivered to the Executi∣oner.
As we rowed by the Powder-Mills, we saw several the Holy
Office had branded with the Names of <HI>Fetisceroes,</HI> or Charmers, or
in <HI>English,</HI> Wizards, released thence to work here; known by a Yel∣low
Cope, Weed, or Garment, like our City poor Pensioners, sleeve∣less,
with an Hole for their Neck only, having a Red Cross before and
behind. St. <HI>Iago,</HI> or St. <HI>James</HI>'s Day, is the Day for the <HI>Aucto de Fie,</HI>
when a general Gaol-Delivery is made of those unhappily intrapp'd
in the Inquisition; at which time there is a great Cavalcade to the
Cathedral, and every <HI>Fidalgo</HI> appearing there, is honoured with being
a Patron to some of these poor Wretches; St. <HI>James</HI> being the Tute∣lar
Saint of this City.</P>
<P>On whom <HI>Seva Gi</HI> minds them to invocate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seva Gi</HI> a bad Neighbour.</NOTE> having but just

intercepted, this being the greatest Mart for small Diamonds, be∣fore
these Incursions: And not only so, but they are straitned for
Butchers Meat, which used to come down plentifully that way; for
these had rather kill a Man, than suffer a Beast to be led to the Stall;
and not only for Meat but Firing, they being beholden to that Coun∣try
for Fuel, as well as Timber for Building. These Calamities, be∣sides
the Approach of <HI>Seva Gi</HI>'s Army, make no small Distractions,

A cursory Discourse of the Bordering Princes.</HEAD>
<P>AS much to the <HI>Southward</HI> as <HI>Goa</HI> is to the <HI>North,</HI> lies <HI>Gocurn,</HI>
whither I took a Pilgrimage, with one other of the Factors, Four
<HI>Peons,</HI> and Two <HI>Biggereens,</HI> or Porters only; we set out all on Foot the
Second of <HI>February,</HI> at the beginning of the Heats, at Ten in the
Morning, and with wonderful toil clambered up <HI>Anchola</HI> Hill, a
woody Mountain of an extraordinary height; where resting a little
while we made for the bottom; at which lies an Horse of an <HI>Haval∣dar</HI>'s
Interred under an huge square Stone, and his Effigies Dormant
upon it Escuthceon, or Diamond-wise; not much farther, the Wood
being on Fire, we were in danger not only of being Smothered
but Roasted (this place not long since the receptacle of <HI>Delvi</HI> and
his Crew, and therefore I suppose purposely Burnt):
<Q><L>Et neque jam cineres ejectatamque favillam</L>
<L>Ferre potest, calidoque involvitur undique fumo.</L></Q></P>
<P>But having conquered by our better Angels this lively portraicture
of Hell, we were led into an happy Elysium, or Plain, that was
bounded by the immense Ocean; and had we been Shades, to have
been satisfied with an Aierial Diet, we might have fared well,
for nothing else could we purchase, the poor Inhabitants being
Fishermen, were left by the iniquity of <HI>Delvi,</HI> without either Fish,
Boats, Nets, or Rice; and upon that account unlikely to supply us.
Night approaching we knew not where to better our selves than un∣der
a Mango-Tree; where our wearied Spirits afforded us not much
time for Contemplation, nor our eager Stomachs much Sleep;
wherefore by break of Day we made for <HI>Anchola,</HI> where we found
the <HI>Buzzar</HI> half Burnt, and the remaining Shops without Tenants,

<Q><L>—Sine militis usu</L>

<P>By the break of the next Dawn we got to <HI>Gocurn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our coming to <HI>Gocurn</HI> di∣scovered.</NOTE> and ex∣changed
our <HI>English</HI> for <HI>Moors</HI> Cloaths, yet not so privately but that
we were discovered by some that told our <HI>Banyan</HI> (who was come
to perform a Vow to the Manes of his dead Father,) that Two
<HI>Englishmen</HI> were come to the <HI>Tomasia,</HI> or Sight; whereupon he
came to us before we expected, with a Band of Thirty or Forty
Men; but we desired to be concealed and pass for <HI>Moguls,</HI> that
we might see without being taken notice of; he was conformable
thereto, and we went into the Town, which was in a Valley near
the Sea; formerly very splendid, now of more esteem for the Re∣licks
of their Pagods than any thing else.</P>
<P>It is an University of the <HI>Brachmins</HI> and well Endowed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is an Uni∣versity.</NOTE> here are
innumerable, but ruinated Pagods; Two only of any Mark, and
they half standing; they were Large and of good Workmanship in
Stone, after their Antick and Hieroglyphical Sculpture; they had,
as all have, a dark Entry at the farther end, wherein are continually
lighted Lamps burning before the <HI>Duel,</HI> or Image, seated there to
represent a Glory, or Phosphorus, whither they resort to Worship
and Offer Oil, Rice, and Frankincense, at it's Feet, on an Offer∣tory;
some make a great pother of Anointing and Washing it, being
lavish both of their Pains and Cost.</P>
<P>At this time the <HI>Brachmins</HI> Reap a great Harvest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This <HI>Tomasia,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the <HI>Brachmins</HI> Harvest.</NOTE> for this Place is
of such repute for its Sanctity and Meritoriousness of a Pilgrimage
hither, that all sorts of Idolaters, from the remotest parts of <HI>India,</HI>
come in sholes, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>celebritas ad quam plurimi mortales
conveniunt</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and we found so many, that the
Streets were troublesome to crowd through; with much ado we
got into the <HI>Buzzar,</HI> or Fair, only so upon this occasion, long Rows of
Sheds being put up on both sides the high Streets, where the Two
great Pagods stood, one at each end.</P>
<P>We were carried by the Tide of the People that bore that way out
of this place, to a large oblong stone Tank, with Descents to go
down all about it; in the middle a neat Pagod supported on Four
Marble Pillars; here during this Festival at Evenings, are blazing a
Lecque of Lamps.</P>
<P>In this all of both Sexes Wash (this Solemnity being called the
<HI>Jatry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Jatry,</HI> or Washing.</NOTE> or Washing) and Present Rice and Mony to the <HI>Brach∣mins;</HI>
and the Fish which Swim here frequently receive their
Benevolence, being so Tame you may catch them with your
Hands; to be the death of one of these is held <HI>Piaculare.</HI></P>
<P>Those whose Parents or Friends are deceased,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Vow per∣formed.</NOTE> the Hair of the

the Barber in this Water has shaved the Head and Beard, it is deli∣vered
<PB N="160" REF="99"/>
wrapped up to the <HI>Brachmin;</HI> who brings a Cow and a Calf
into the Water, and binding them with Frontlets ceremoniously, they
bestow on them, as they are disposed, either for Ornament or Main∣tainance
ever after; imagining their Souls to have their residence in
them: From whence they are conducted to the <HI>Pagod,</HI> which they
enter bare-footed, and offer to the <HI>Duel;</HI> returning, they smite on a
Bell hung in the Body of the Church; and going to the Porch, re∣ceive
their Slippers, washing afterwards at more liberty for the rest
of the Festival.</P>
<P>It was a Primitive Custom among the <HI>Jews</HI> to shave when they
had made a Vow, <HI>Act. Apost. Chap. 18. v.</HI> 18.</P>
<P>Coasting along the Sea-side,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jougies</HI> or De∣votes.</NOTE> we came to the <HI>Pomaerium</HI> of the
greatest <HI>Pagod,</HI> where near the Gate in a <HI>Choultry</HI> sate more than
Forty naked <HI>Jougies,</HI> or Men united to God, covered with Ashes,
and pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted Turbats of their own Hair; two above the rest remarka∣ble,
one sitting with his Head hanging over his Shoulders, his Eyes
shut, moving neither Hands or Feet, but always set across, his Nails
overgrown like Talons: The other as a check to Incontinency, had
a Gold Ring fastned into his Viril Member.</P>
<P>And now we returned into the Market-place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Solemn Procession of their <HI>Duels</HI> or Heroes.</NOTE> having obtained
leave to seat our selves by the Chief Captain to see their Duels pass by
in Pomp, being to do their Devoirs to a Mother <HI>Pagod:</HI> At the upper-end
of the High-street were two great moving Pageants drawn on
Wheels, two Stories high, with a Cupulo on the top, which was stuck
round full of Streamers of Orient Colours; the inferior Stories were
painted with deformed Figures of their Saints, on every side Portals:
In the lowest was placed the <HI>Duel,</HI> attended by their Chief Priests
with a dark Blue Cope over their Shoulder, their under Garments
White, and <HI>Puckeries</HI> on their Heads, a <HI>Mussal</HI> within, and an <HI>Ofta∣gary</HI>
(a Skreen of Silver and Velvet with Sarcenet Borders) to keep
off the Sun.</P>
<P>Thus the Chief <HI>Naik</HI> with his loud Musick of Horns, Trumpets
and Drums waited on it, and the <HI>Brachmins</HI> with softer, of the Dancing
Wenches singing, with Bells at their Wrists and Heels, and their
<HI>Tamboles</HI> or Tabrets: An Ensign of Red, Swallow-tailed, several <HI>Chi∣tories;</HI>
little, but Rich <HI>Kitsolls</HI> (which are the Names of several
Counties for Umbrelloes); 500 Men, with Javelins of Brass and
Steel, with Bells and Feathers, as many more with Guns under his
Command; and the <HI>Naik</HI> Wherry with like fashioned Ensign of
Green, bordered with a Checker of White and Green, followed by
200 in the same order as before; after these followed a Medly of
Pots and Pans of Copper or Brass, Men clattering on them, and
dancing a good measure: When the Train drew near, it was drawn
by a Team of Holy Men, the People rising and clapping their
Hands as it passed to the opposite <HI>Pagod;</HI> a Troop of the Gentry in
<HI>Cavalcade</HI> rode after it, where having paid a Visit, it returned with
the like Solemn Procession, and by discharging of Guns the Cere∣mony
ended: There were several other <HI>Duels</HI> fanned by Women,
offering Censers of rich Perfumes with huge Lights; before which
People possessed with Familiars ran Cudgelling themselves; others
in a different sort of Mummery belaboured themselves, till they
<PB N="161" REF="99"/>
could not stand, all striving to outdo others; thus blind and heated
were they in their Zeal.</P>
<P>To describe every particular <HI>Duel</HI> or <HI>Pagod,</HI> both for the number,
and difficulty of the Shapes, would be impossible; take therefore
only one that had escaped the Fire, and therefore highly venerable;
'twas cut out of Excellent Black Marble, the height of a Man, the
Body of an Ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Hero, it had four Heads, and as many
Hands, had not two been cut off; it was seated on an Offertory in
a broken <HI>Pagod;</HI> a Piece of Admirable Work and Antiquity, ex∣ceeding,
say they, <HI>Bonares,</HI> the other Noted University of the
Heathens.</P>
<P>Who founded these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Foun∣ders un∣known.</NOTE> their Annals nor their <HI>Sanscript</HI> deliver not.
But certainly Time, and the Entry of the <HI>Moors,</HI> ruined them. This,
though a Principal University, can boast of no <HI>Bodlean</HI> or <HI>Vatican;</HI>
their Libraries being Old Manuscripts of their own <HI>Cabalas,</HI> or
Mysteries understood only by the <HI>Brachmins.</HI></P>
<P>They live not under a Collegiate Confinement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Divines under no Vow of Ce∣libacy.</NOTE> but in pretty Neat
Houses plastered with Cow-dung, which is done afresh as oft as they
sweep them, where they abide with their Families, Celibacy being
no Injunction to their Divines; excepting one House of the <HI>Sinai
Cast,</HI> where is a Reverend Old Man, Head of their Tribe, who pro∣fesses
a Life without the Company of a Woman, and has the Atten∣dance
of a great many Young <HI>Ashmen,</HI> and Grave <HI>Brachmins:</HI> These
live a reserved Life, and spend it wholly in Praying and Abstinence;
as the others count their Prayers by Beads, these do it by <HI>Cowreys,</HI> Fish∣shells:
They wore Red Caps, such as those are brought from <HI>Tunis;</HI>
and our Seamen wear daily aboard Ship: But the Stricter, and more
Undefiled <HI>Cast,</HI> is the <HI>Butt,</HI> the reason whereof you will find in the
General Account of <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>All <HI>Brachmins</HI> are distinguished by a Cotton-thred athwart their
Body from their Left Shoulder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Brachmin</HI> can hardly at∣tone the vio∣lation of his <HI>Cast.</HI></NOTE> hanging down under their Right Arm;
which Badge, if they violate it, costs them vast Sums of Money to
redeem, besides the undergoing of strict Pennances.</P>
<P>They fetch Water for the <HI>Duels</HI> from the <HI>Tank</HI> with loud Musick
and Dancing Wenches three or four times a-day (the <HI>Brachmins</HI>
waiting in course) and those dancing Wenches and Boys set a-part for
that Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cast</HI> of the <HI>Dowlys.</HI></NOTE> dare not dance afore any else: These Dancers are taken
out of the <HI>Cast</HI> of the <HI>Dowlys,</HI> who are obliged to devote the Eldest
of the Males and Females to that use; having for that reason large
Dispensations concerning their Marriage, or the Liberty of getting
Children, being common to all: To conclude with these, Whether
Religion make these People Morose, or it be to be attributed to the
Virtue of their Manners; you see in them a carelesness of behaviour
towards Strangers, neither regarding the Novelty, nor Gawdiness of
their Garb; being here, as it is said, <HI>Romae, Lutetiae ac Venetiae,</HI>
<Q>—Nemo quicquid miratur.</Q>
From hence we trooped to <HI>Tudera,</HI> at the Mouth of <HI>Mirja</HI> River, over
a Rocky barren Hill, where the Company's Barge or <HI>Baloon</HI> met us;
and went up in it to <HI>Mirja,</HI> where our brisk Young <HI>Banyan</HI> treated us
<PB N="162" REF="100"/>
with the Dancing Wenches; his Father dying soon, left him young,
and he out of Government, lavishes into Excesses not approved of by
that stingy Tribe.</P>
<P>At <HI>Mirja</HI> stands a Castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Mirja.</HI></NOTE> which though old is a very fine one,
being double Wall'd and Trench'd, with high Turrets on the Ba∣stions:
It was surrendred by the Treachery of a <HI>Moor</HI> Governor, and
is now under the subjection of the <HI>Canatick Ranna;</HI> it has a wide Moat
about it, but few Guns: The Town has a <HI>Buzzar,</HI> at the end of it a
<HI>Cemitery</HI> for the <HI>Moors,</HI> with an ample Aquaduct of good Stone.</P>
<P>Being tired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An huge Snake.</NOTE> and lying to repose out of the Noise of the Dancers,
on the Bank of the River, under a shady Tree, I was made at by an
unsizable Snake, which I hardly escaped, had it not hissed with an
unheard-of Noise before me, which rouzing me, made me shift
its speedy Course, as it angrily gathered up its Body, and darted its
self into the Flags on the River-side: These Creatures are dreadful to
the Inhabitants, and when I related my Hazard, they wondred I came
off so, there being of them big enough to master the largest Ani∣mals:
After my Danger was over, I was told she had a Nest in that
Place, it being lately turned into a Burial-place. <HI>Hic, obitèr, notandum

his way of fighting differs from his Neighbours; he trains up his

that a Budget-full of them have been presented to their Lord for a
Breakfast; a thing, because it deforms them, so abashing, that few
care to engage with him; and this he makes use of, because it is
against his Religion to kill any thing. He enjoys a vast Territory
on the back of the <HI>Zamerhin.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond him lies <HI>Raja Madaree,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Raja Madaree.</NOTE> possessing all from him as far as the

<P>All these are the disjointed Members of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> neither trust∣ing
on another, nor uniting for the common Good of the Kingdom:
Since <HI>Seva Gi</HI> has put all into a Ferment, they know not who to
side with, being uncertain of his Intentions; though he tells them,
his Compeers the <HI>Duccanees,</HI> he is their Champion, and that none of
them besides himself has the heart to stand up for their Country; and
therefore if he chance now and then to rob them, it is but to reward
himself and Soldiers for his and their pains in endeavouring to free
them from a more unnatural Slavery.</P>
<P>This makes them begin to Cabal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Irresolu∣tion of the <HI>Duccanees,</HI></NOTE> not brooking the Perfidy of this

of War, who carry small Petareroes, slew the greatest part of
them, and <HI>Timi Naig</HI> himself was trodden to Death under his Ele∣phants
Feet, whereupon an easy Victory ensued, the rest yielding
when their General was slain; who is not much lamented by the
Nobles of <HI>Canora,</HI> whose Greatness he diminished by cutting them
off upon small Suspicions, and advancing in their steads inferior Per∣sons
to great Employments; confining the Princess-Mother with her
Son to a Pension, and that but ordinary. Things now begin to
return to the Royal Current, and they confess him a Chastisement
for their former Rebellions against their Natural Prince, vowing a
perfect Allegiance to the Infant Prince, in whose Name since the

<P>These were to have been seconded by <HI>Badur Caun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bullul Caun</HI> beats the <HI>Mo∣gul</HI>'s Army.</NOTE> the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Ge∣neral,

about Two hundred and fifty Years ago, sole Monarch of <HI>India in∣tra

Three Slaves that were <HI>Chias Moors,</HI> and advanced them to the prin∣cipal

Successors were crowded till they Annihilated); the Last, the other
part of <HI>Duccan,</HI> with all the Continent on this side the <HI>Gates,</HI> till it
conclude in the Cape of <HI>Comora.</HI></P>
<P>Thus were they seated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conspi∣cy of <HI>Ramras</HI> his Favourites.</NOTE> and by the sequel not minded to be dis∣mounted;
wherefore they jointly Combined against their supine
Master, whilst he too credulously relied on their Fidelity, and outed

<P>After this Conspiracy every one betook himself to his Govern∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They make themselves Kings, and are Curbed by the <HI>Mogul.</HI></NOTE>
there being no more to possess themselves of; the imprudent
King having given all away, even to his Person, which they scru∣pled
not to Violate, Extinguishing the very Lineage, or leaving
them so undefenceable, that they are only said to be a petty <HI>Rajaship</HI>
in the Plain, and thereby easily prevented to aspire to their Lawful
Sovereignty; the Supremacy being established in their own Hands,
and shared to their mutual Contents, they took upon them without

their Functions very Amicably some Years; and so long they kept
themselves safe enough from the <HI>Moguls,</HI> who began to make Inroads

I saw the Ruins of a sumptuous Edifice <HI>Nishamshaw</HI> Erected for the
present Emperor of the <HI>Moguls:</HI> The Reward which he gratified
him with, was the Extirpation of the Royal Race of the <HI>Nisham∣shaws;</HI>
whose Destruction the remaining Two may at leisure repent,
being thereby incapacitated to make Head against the <HI>Mogul,</HI> maugre
all their Forces; when before, <HI>Nishamshaw</HI> alone could withstand,
and even Defeat his most puissant Armies; but since his downfal
they have enough to do to Guard themselves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">On the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> the <HI>Raja'</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Desert.</NOTE> The <HI>Rajah</HI>'s (the

in as they list.</P>
<P>For all that, what is left of <HI>Duccan</HI> under the King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> is
still a spacious Kingdom, reaching <HI>North</HI> to <HI>Jeneah, South</HI> to <HI>Porto

unsettled and ill Governed, whereby it is often distressed; but when
it comes near to the upshot, <HI>Gulconda</HI> puts in either as a Mediator,
or an Assistant with Men, (for which he pays dear if it be publickly,
for then the <HI>Mogul</HI> turns his Arms on him) or Mony he helps him to
underhand; though he is mightily awed by the <HI>Mogul,</HI> suffering the
<HI>Mogul</HI>'s Ambassador to reside at Court in quality of a Supervisor; who
Lords it without controul, causing his Coin to be stamped with his
Master's Inscription, his Subjects Mulcted and Sessed by his Imposi∣tions;
yet he is sensible should he seize <HI>Duccan, Gulconda</HI> would lose
the stoutest Bulwark on that side his Kingdom, which hath made
him these Forty Years a firm Confederate to <HI>Visiapour;</HI> sometimes
sending <HI>Piscashes</HI> of considerable Value to <HI>Seva Gi</HI> and the Bordering
Princes and <HI>Raja</HI>'s to disturb the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Forces, other-whiles
<PB N="167" REF="102"/>
stopping the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Mouth with a Tribute, as also his Generals
with large Presents.</P>
<P>Which are the Reasons the <HI>Mogul</HI> hath made no farther Progress
of late Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it comes to pass the <HI>Mo∣gul</HI> has made no farther progress in his Conquest of <HI>Duccan.</HI></NOTE> satisfying himself to keep these Kingdoms in the na∣ture
of Vassals, though never absolutely Conquered; frustrated
chiefly by the means of the Soldiery and great <HI>Ombrahs,</HI> who live
Lazily and in Pay, whereupon they term <HI>Duccan, The Bread of the
Military Men:</HI> Or because that he is never wholly at leisure to prose∣cute
these Wars himself, being always busied in one place or another
of more import, as lately against the <HI>Patans,</HI> and now against the
<HI>Ʋsbeque Tartars;</HI> besides a vast Army always upon the Marches of
<HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Candahar;</HI> so that this huge Empire seldome has its
Auxiliary Bands entire: However distracted as they are, this flying
Battalion would easily suffice to dispatch these Two Kingdoms one
after another, there being ready on the Confines of <HI>Duccan</HI> never less
than Forty thousand Horse, beside Foot. Notwithstanding all these
formidable Numbers, while the Generals and <HI>Vocanovices</HI> consult to
deceive the Emperor, on whom he depends for a true state of things,
it can never be otherwise but that they must be misrepresented, when
the Judgment he makes must be by a false Perspective; whereby it is
apparent on what Bases these Kingdoms are supported.</P>
<P>Of the Government of <HI>Gulconda</HI> something hath been spoken al∣ready,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Govern∣ment of <HI>Duc∣can.</HI></NOTE>
it remains therefore to give an account of <HI>Duccan;</HI> the sub∣stance
of which is, that as the former was Modelled according to
the Policy of <HI>Indostan,</HI> with this difference, that <HI>Eunuch</HI>'s wedded to
their Master's Concerns, were promoted from the dregs of Slavery
to Empire, so here <HI>Cofferies</HI> at their first arrival as Slavish, are be∣come
as endeared to their Master; who, as they Merit, have the first
places of Honour and Trust imposed upon them, with this Proviso,
ever to be faithfully obliged to their Lord; in which point their ap∣proved
Faith has rarely failed, Interest teaching them to be true to
him that raised them; they thereby being liable to the envy of
those they are purposely set as a Checkmate to; for by their exalta∣tion,
the swelling exorbitancy of other Princes is corrected, and
they being only at the Will of their Master, are tied to their good
Behaviour.</P>
<P>On the contrary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Duccan∣nees</HI> are Prin∣ces Born.</NOTE> the Lords of <HI>Duccan</HI> are Born Princes, assume
Honour from their Lands, have as perfect a Right to them as the
King to the Kingdom, and descend from Father to Son by Inheri∣tance
(though the Commons are as meer Slaves as any where in
the <HI>East</HI> besides, excepting none); whereupon they grow Insolent
and Stubborn, and are not so easily Bridled, as where the Rule is
Arbitrary, and are only restrained from Raising Men in the
King's Name and for his Use; but these make Peace and War, Build
Forts, and fall out one with another, and with their Sovereign too
at their own Pleasure; and hardly Unite, though a common neces∣sity
require; nay many times side with the Enemy.</P>
<P>However, when the King gets them in the Toil, they are treated
as they deserve; for he makes bold with their Heads, takes their
Estates wholly into his Custody and for his own Use, bestowing
them on his Creatures, when Forfeited, making them understand,
<PB N="168" REF="103"/>
that they are obliged by Fealty to follow his Command, as their
shewing themselves at <HI>Visiapour</HI> in course to pay their Respects de∣monstrates;
which yet of late they have done but remisly, making a
<HI>Salam</HI> at Four or Five Course distance, and then accompanied in an
Hostile manner, as if coming to Besiege the City, more than to
perform their Duty: For which they plead the King's Minority, be∣ing
either Afraid, or too Proud to commit their Persons, or give Ho∣mage
to the Protector, being an Alien, and a <HI>Patan,</HI> who hath but
lately wrested the Management of Affairs from the hands of <HI>Cowis
Caun,</HI> to whom was intrusted the Safeguard of the King and King∣dom,
by the Last Will and Testament of the Deceased King, and
(with much ado) at length confirmed by and with the general
Consent of the <HI>Duccannees;</HI> he being from an <HI>Hobsy Caphir</HI> made a
free Denizen, and Naturalized by the precedent King (who only in
this Nation arrive to great Preferments, being the Frizled Woolly∣pated
Blacks) under the known stile of <HI>Syddies</HI>).</P>
<P>He,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cowis Caun</HI> the Protector Murthered at a Treat by <HI>Bullul Caun.</HI></NOTE> although an excellent Man of War, submitted himself too
often to be overcome with Wine (than which among <HI>Musselmen</HI>
nothing renders them more odious) and upon that score Pretences
were found to lay the blame of the Government, and the Loss of
the Country, over-run by <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> upon his Head, together with
other Disorders. Though the <HI>Patan</HI> knew well his Commission was
to put a stop to those growing Mischiefs, and had he not been emu∣lous
of the other's Charge, was Man enough to have deterred <HI>Seva
Gi</HI> from his Attempts. But Ambition knows no mean, and therefore
lets all to the hazard, rather than admit the Commands of a Supe∣rior;
wherefore he stands Idle, and studies only how to displace the
other, which was effected in a small time after his being called back.
For he inviting <HI>Cowis Caun</HI> to a Treat, who suspecting least, when no∣thing
was pretended but Friendship, came with a slender Retinue,
and taking off his Cups freely, fell dead drunk into the merciless
Snare of his Enemy, who surprizing his Followers with 12000
brave <HI>Patans,</HI> made way into the Royal Castle, where the young
King became a Prey, the <HI>Caun</HI> first a Prisoner, and then a Sacrifice to
the Lust of the Usurper.</P>
<P>And this is the sum of the present Tumults of this Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Successi∣on of the Kings of <HI>Visiapour.</HI></NOTE>
which at this juncture of time, in the face of a mighty Host of the
<HI>Moguls,</HI> and the frequent Incursions of <HI>Seva Gi</HI> from the Mountains
on the other side, beside the Civil Mutinies and Dissentions within,
to prevent ill consequences, calls for a skilful Pilot; for it never, since

an Elephant-keeper, when the King's choicest Elephants were for∣ced
to be stabled near the Womens Quarters, to hide them from the
<HI>Mogul</HI>'s Ambassador (whom they dare not refuse any thing he begs
in his Great Master's Name), where one of them found the Conve∣niency
to descend from the Trunk of his Elephant into the Queen's
Apartment, and get her a Son when the good Old King was past his
Labour, and withal she fixed him upon the Throne: Which some of
the Issue of <HI>Sultan Mahmud</HI> enquiring into, made their Claim, and
upon the expiring of <HI>Alah</HI> stirred up Factions, with hot Altercations
on either side; but were finally quelled by <HI>Cowis Caun,</HI> who conti∣nued
<HI>Sultan Socodre Caudre Adul Shaw,</HI> till he was taken Prisoner and

rewarding himself most unconscionably; all <HI>Conchon</HI> being little
enough for him, extending in Length along the Sea-Coasts, 250
Leagues, that is, from <HI>Balsore</HI> Hills to the River <HI>Gongole;</HI> where nei∣ther
is he limited in his extravagant Desires, expecting only opportu∣nity

an irreparable Damage, (<HI>Arab</HI> Steeds being the Life of their

<P>Nor has he done this Injury to them alone, but the <HI>Mogul</HI> hath the

what the <HI>Portugals</HI> have, and the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Bombaim;</HI> which

he might amass greater Treasures than he purchases by pil∣laging
and pilfering, and might come off with the Glorious Name
of a Conqueror; whereas otherwise, following his barbarous Courses
of Fire and Sword, he merits no more than to be branded as a
Thief: Witness those intolerable Cruelties, Devastations, and De∣serts
made by him every where in his Range up and down in the
<HI>Mogul</HI>'s Territories, as well as in the <HI>Duccanean.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="104"/>
'Tis undeniable he hath taken and maintains against the <HI>Moguls</HI>
Sixty odd strong Hills: But the Cause is, the <HI>Moguls</HI> are unacquaint∣ed
with, and their Bodies unfit for such barren and uneasy Places; so
that they rather chuse to desert than defend them: Whereby it is
sufficiently evident <HI>Seva Gi</HI> is unable in the Plain to do any thing
but Rob, Spoil, and return with all the speed imaginable: And on
that account it is <HI>Aurenzeeb</HI> calls him his Mountain-Rat, with which
the greatest Systems of Monarchy in the World, though continued
by an uninterrupted Descent of Imperial Ancestry, have ever been
infested, finding it more hard to fight with Mountains than Men.</P>
<P>Thus it falls out here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moun∣taineers in all Conquests the last that stand out.</NOTE> by the like Chance as in most Conquests,
that though the major Part have submitted to their Victorious
Arms, yet some out of Confidence in their Strength, Reputation,

Stratagem, the acquired Trophies of the Triumphing Party:
As the <HI>Apennegeni</HI> did the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the Wild People about <HI>Taurus</HI>

the <HI>Switz;</HI> and as many as have been encouraged thereto by the inac∣cessibleness
of their Fortresses, or the Discontent of some Great
Ones to head them: From whence, though inconsiderable in them∣selves,
it is, that they presume to boast of their never being totally
subdued.</P>
<P>Such are the <HI>Rajahs</HI> of the Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seva Gi</HI> raises himself on the Ruins of other Lords.</NOTE> the most eminent among
whom is <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> derived from an Ancient Line of <HI>Rajahs,</HI> of the
Cast of the <HI>Bounceloes,</HI> a Warlike and Active Offspring: His Grand∣father
was a Man in Esteem under <HI>Nisham Shaw,</HI> whose Name was
<HI>Vangu Gi Rajah;</HI> his Father <HI>Shaw Gi Rajah</HI> was made Commander by
the same King of <HI>Juneah Gur,</HI> where, upon that Rock his first Wife
brought forth the Obdurate <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> his Eldest Son, and <HI>Samba Gi,</HI>
his Second; by another Wife he had a Third Son, called <HI>Ekou Gi.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Downfall of <HI>Nisham Shaw,</HI> the Father and his other
Sons listed themselves as Pensioners to the King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> where
the Father was, and the Sons now are advanced to considerable Em∣ploys.
<HI>Seva Gi</HI> could not be won upon, but sought to raise himself
by the Ruins of others, setting the lesser Lords at variance with their
Prince, in whose Quarrels he always made sure of the upper Ground;
wherefore his Father at his Death disinherited him, and instated his
youngest Son <HI>Ekou Gi</HI> in the <HI>Rajahship</HI> of <HI>Benglure;</HI> a Starveling <HI>Ra∣jahship,</HI>
since it hath been harass'd by the Troubles of <HI>Duccan,</HI> where
he sits down quietly, whilst this Turbulent Young Man works him∣self

<P>At which the King of <HI>Visiapour</HI> beginning to cast an Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Visiapour</HI> jea∣lous of <HI>Seva Gi.</HI></NOTE> finding
him aspiring, and intending to blast him in the Bud, sent a Potent
Army against him, conducted by <HI>Abdul Caun,</HI> an Experienc'd Sol∣dier,
yet outwitted by <HI>Seva Gi:</HI> For he understanding of his having
taken the Field, while the Main Body was yet at distance enough, he
sent to him flattering and seducing Messages, intimating withal, if
he would but stop his March, at an appointed <HI>Choultry</HI> out of sight
of each Rendezvouz, he would meet him, and kiss his Feet; beg∣ging
that he would act the obliging Office of a Peacemaker between
him and the King.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="105"/>
<HI>Abdul Caun</HI> thinking no less than that he meant sincerely, consent∣ed,
though advised to the contrary by his Friends, (whether out
of Superstition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seva</HI>'s Trea∣chery in slay∣ing <HI>Abdul Caun.</HI></NOTE> as the dying of an Elephant, and other bad presaging
Omens, or they doubting the Integrity of <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> I know not),
but they could not prevail: At the Day prefixed therefore he takes
with him his Son and a selected Number, which he credited would
not be out-equalled by <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> upon his former Protestations and
Hopes of Reconcilement; but the Perfidious Man had placed an Am∣buscado,
and with a smaller Shew in appearance than <HI>Abdul</HI> brought,
waits his coming; who as soon as he spied him afar off, went forth
to meet him, and prostrates himself before him with feigned Tears,
craving Pardon for his Offence, and would not rise till he had assured
him of his being his Advocate to procure it: Going to enter the
<HI>Choultry</HI> together, he cries out, like a fearful Man, That his Lord
(so he stiled the General) might execute his Pleasure on him, and ease
him of his Life; which <HI>Abdul Caun</HI> surmising was because he was
armed, and the other came seemingly unarmed, delivered his Sword
and Ponyard to his Page, and bad him enter with Courage; where
after some Parley he slips a Stiletto from under his Coat-sleeve, and
then eying his Blow, struck it at his Heart, whereat the Signal was
given, and his Men came forth, in which Scuffle <HI>Abdul</HI>'s Son gave
<HI>Seva Gi</HI> a Wound, but was forced to change Habit with a <HI>Frass</HI> im∣mediately,
and venturing through untrodden Paths hardly escaped
to the Camp, who thereupon were so discomfited, that they quickly
dispersed themselves, and left the Field open to <HI>Seva Gi.</HI></P>
<P>Who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whereupon follows the Discomfiture of the Army, and taking <HI>Pa∣nala.</HI></NOTE> grown proud with this good Fortune, resolves not to return
till he had sacked <HI>Panala,</HI> one of their Wealthiest and Strongest Ci∣ties;
but finding it a Work not over-facile, they within, though
thinly Mann'd, being obstinate, he disbands therefore, under pretext
of Ill Usage, Seven or Eight Hundred of his Men, who presently
took their way to the City, and offer their Service, complaining of
<HI>Seva Gi</HI> as an Inhuman Butcherly Fellow, some Marks of which they
produced on those suborned for that purpose: The present Occasions
urging, and being willing to blind themselves with the Improbability
of its being a Cheat, they within admitted them the City, but so as for
some time they could not put their Plot in execution, the Citizens
watching at Night the Gates with their own Men, and disposing them
on the Walls and Out-posts: But the Inhabitants taken up with their
Delight more than Security, had pester'd the Ditches with Gardens and
Trees, whereby on a Set Night, they on the Walls having so contrived
it, received their Friends of the Camp under Covert of the Trees, and
overpowering the Citizens, opened the Gates, whereupon the Enemy
entred, and by this Treachery the City was gained for <HI>Seva Gi;</HI>
which he makes his Retreat, ordering those Trees to be cut down
that were so fatal to the former Possessors.</P>
<P>And now he forages the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Roy∣al Army broke by Perfidy.</NOTE> and lays all waste in his
Round, till young <HI>Abdul</HI> was reinforced to revenge his Father's
Death, and to join with another General <HI>Rustam Gemma,</HI> with whom

people, that Money shall corrupt the most Loyal among them:
Which made him when they were ready to give Battel, withdraw his

Cavalry, leaving young <HI>Abdul</HI> and his Men to try it out with <HI>Seva
Gi;</HI> whose Force, though an Handful, fell bravely on, and so gauled
<HI>Seva Gi,</HI> that he wish'd him well off; <HI>Abdul</HI> crying out wherever
he went, <HI>Thou Coward</HI> Seva, <HI>here am I;</HI> whereof though <HI>Seva</HI> had
notice, he avoided him, saying, <HI>He was a Rash Youth, let somebody
else kill him:</HI> He made through his Army two or three times in Per∣son,
till being tired he was fain to leave off, and speed to <HI>Visiapour,</HI>
to complain of <HI>Rustam</HI>'s Falshood: Upon this <HI>Rustam</HI>'s Horse disband∣ed,
some choice Friends only going over with him to <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> advi∣sing
him to follow his Blow, and set upon <HI>Visiapour</HI> its self, which he
did; and had not <HI>Syddy Jore</HI> come to its Relief with a vast Recruit,
he had not only attacked, but carried it.</P>
<P>Then it was time for <HI>Seva</HI> to retire to <HI>Panala,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seva</HI> has <HI>Raja∣por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> surren∣dred by a false <HI>Pharmond.</HI></NOTE> where being long

the <HI>Syddy</HI> was to surrender it in exchange for <HI>Panala.</HI></P>
<P>After which the <HI>Syddy</HI> resorts to <HI>Visiapour</HI> to his Master,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Syddy Jore</HI> tricked out of his Life by <HI>Bullul Caun.</HI></NOTE> who bore
his Disgust for letting the Traytor go, under a serene Countenance,
and dismiss'd him with Thanks: But having made <HI>Bullul Caun</HI> Com∣mander
in Chief, he dispatches him after the <HI>Syddy,</HI> who being wa∣ry
and doubtful of the King's Intentions, had provided to stand to it,
putting <HI>Bullul Caun</HI> to Flight: Whereupon begins another Civil Dis∣cord;
the King in Person resolves to bid at his Head, which other∣wise
by the clandestine Practices of <HI>Bullul Caun</HI> was hoped to be at∣chieved,
as it proved, he doing that by Fraud he could not do by
Force: For the Night after both Armies were in view, the <HI>Omrahs</HI> on
the <HI>Syddy</HI>'s side forsook him, and he was slain, and his Head brought to
the King, without any more Strokes fought; such deadly Venom
bears Secret Malice and Hellish Insinuation.</P>
<P>This still makes for <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> for he was not able to cope with him
singly; which Impediment thus lopped off to his hand, he seizes at
leisure smaller Places, as <HI>Dan de Rajapour,</HI> whose Prince sueth for
Protection to the <HI>Mogul,</HI> being beaten out of all but his Strong Ca∣stle

<P>In this Juncture of Affairs the King dies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Visiapour</HI> dies.</NOTE> and leaves a Babe to
dispute for the Throne; when <HI>Seva Gi</HI> enlarges himself, flies out as far
as <HI>Surat,</HI> and comes home with Rich Booty; which hapned presently
after the Emperor of the <HI>Moguls</HI> was warm in his Seat (by the Over∣throw
of his Brethren, and the Death of his Father <HI>Shaw Juan,</HI> by
his Interest on <HI>Raja Jesseign</HI>); who desirous to try if by Kindness he
could reclaim this famous Rebel, allures him to Court (Faith being
plighted for his Safety), where shortly after, the Outcries of the
Women in whose Kindred's Blood his hands were imbrued, made him
shift for himself in an Hamper on a Porter's Back, which passed the
Guards among many other, which were forced to be sent as <HI>Piscashes</HI>
to his Friends, as the manner is when under Confinement: With this
<PB N="174" REF="106"/>
Slight he got away (not without the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Privity), and 'tis be∣lieved
will hardly venture to <HI>Agra</HI> again, unless better guarded.</P>
<P>For this he made a second Rape on <HI>Surat,</HI> and now lately has ta∣ken
the <HI>Rajahship</HI> of <HI>Rhamnagur,</HI> though he had first spread himself
more <HI>South,</HI> even to the Walls of <HI>Goa,</HI> from whence he slided to the
Borders of the <HI>Canatick</HI> and <HI>Sunda Rajah</HI>'s Country: His Chief Resi∣dence
is at <HI>Rairee,</HI> where he bids Defiance to the Emperor, <HI>Gulconda,

Strong-Holds; installed <HI>Mau Rajah</HI> Two Years since, when I sent
you a Journal of an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman's, sent Ambassador to him at

<HEAD>The Kingdom of Visiapour.</HEAD>
<P>Although it be Hereditary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King not Absolute.</NOTE> and not Elective, yet it comes nearest

dwindled into it, and some more <HI>Southern</HI> have withdrawn, and the

the Composition of these several disagreeing ones to make it

<HI>Geron;</HI> where for the common Safety, if any Part were af∣flicted,
every Member ran to the Succour of the other, as if it were
to their peculiar Tranquility; their Counsels one, their Minds one,
their Designments one; their Dominions flourished, and every one
owned Subjection, and held their Provinces as Vassals to the

broken with more ease; <HI>Duccan</HI> is lost already, <HI>Visiapour</HI> seems de∣clining,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shews the Pleasure and the Product of the Woods: The People
bewitched to Idolatry; the Sottishness of the Atheist. I am
sent for to Bombaim; after some endeavours to go thither,
and some time spent at Goa, am forced to Winter at Carwar,
and then I return to Surat.</HEAD>
<P>THE Exercises here are common with <HI>India,</HI> only Cock-Fighting;
for which Sport they have a Breed of Cocks as
big as Turkies; which they Arm with Razors tied flat under their
Claws, and faulched Two Inches instead of Gavelocks, with which
they slash one another Mortally; so that the Dispute endures not
long, for most an end the first or second Blow decides it.</P>
<P>For our own Diversion here we had none besides Shooting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diversions.</NOTE> in
which we spent sometimes a whole Week in the Woods and Rivers
sides; for if we expected Flesh, or Fowl, we must take Pains for it;
no Beef being to be Bought here, though up the Country from the

Fish) Water-Fowl, Peacocks, Green Pidgeons, spotted Deer, Sa∣bre,
<PB N="176" REF="107"/>
Wild Hogs, and sometimes Wild Cows. Going in quest where∣of,
one of our Soldiers, a Youth, Killed a Tigre-Royal; it was
brought home by Thirty or Forty <HI>Combies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tigre Kil∣led and Dis∣sected.</NOTE> the Body tied to a long
Bamboo, the Tail extended; so they brought it to the House,
where we saw 'twas Wounded in Three Places, one through the
Head with Two Bullets, another through the Body slanting up to
the Shoulders, a Third in the Leg; it was a Tigre of the Biggest
and Noblest Kind, Five Feet in Length beside the Tail, Three and an
half in Height, it was of a light Yellow, streaked with Black,
like a Tabby Cat, the Ears short, with a few Bristles about the
Lips; the Visage Fierce and Majestick, the Teeth gnashing, Two
of which she brake against the Stones for anguish, the Shoulders and
Fore-legs thick and well set, the Paw as Large as the biggest Fist
stretched out, the Claws thick and strong.</P>
<P>The Boy Shot it in the Night from a <HI>Chouse,</HI> or <HI>Estarzo,</HI> as it came to
Drink, supposing it to have been a Deer; the first Shot was that under
the Shoulder, which made her Spring Three times an incredible
Height, at the last of which she fell into the <HI>Chouse</HI> from whence she saw
the Flash, where with the <HI>English</HI> Boy were a <HI>Comby,</HI> and a <HI>Comby</HI> Boy
of Eight Year old, asleep a little on one side; she pawed the Straw
with her Feet, while all but the Child asleep fled; but being wrung
by her Pain, she soon left the place with an horrible Noise that made
the Woods tremble, all which awaked not the Lad, nor had it any
Harm.</P>
<P>In this interval, the <HI>English</HI> Youth Charged again with a couple of
Slugs, and tracing the Blood, as she was making at him, discharged
through the Brain-pan, at which she was quiet; but to make sure,
he made another shot at her, which he believed was that in the Leg:
All this time the Moon was Obscured and Cloudy; the <HI>Comby</HI> that
had left him and his Son, at length came with a many more, calling
<HI>Fringi,</HI> the Term they have for <HI>Europe</HI>-Men and <HI>Franks;</HI> the Boy
was walking about, fearing to venture within reach, till at last laying
aside his well-advised Suspicion, he approaching, found the Terror
of the Wood Slain.</P>
<P>Disrobed of its Royal Hide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Bones bound in the Shoulders im∣mersed in the Flesh.</NOTE> Two Bones of the Bigness and Figure
of a Levator, presented themselves to our view, that had no Connexi∣on
with the other Bones, but wholly immersed in the Flesh <HI>per sy∣sarcasin,</HI>
in the ends of each Pectoral, and the Three circumducing
Muscles, towards the joining of the Shoulder-blades, and the upper
Bones of the Fore-feet, commonly called Shoulder-bones; of these
there goes a Story handed by Tradition, as that Licking the Right
Shoulder it appeases Hunger, the Left it whets it where these Bones
lie; but probable enough it is, that Nature added these for its greater
Strength; The Entrails were little variable, but the Heart was
mighty, and the Liver (they say) had as many Lobes as that was
Years old, which were Six and an half, like to a Foxes.</P>
<P>The Chief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Custom of the <HI>Ombrahs</HI> on any grat Action.</NOTE> to encourage the Lad, told him, That though he were
a Boy, he had done a Manly Action, and therefore according to the
Custom of the Country, in presence of all his Admirers, he plucked off
his own Coat, which was <HI>Venetian</HI> Cloath of Silk and Silver, and gave
it him. The Great <HI>Ombrahs</HI> always do the like upon any hazardous

Atchievments, and if Wounded, throw them their Sashes and <HI>Pa∣merins</HI>
to Bind them up, and Cover them, though never so Rich:
Having likewise another Custom among them, to Cloath the Gun
with Scarlet that has made any notable Breach, Slain any great Sol∣dier,
or done any extraordinary Feat.</P>
<P>It is memorable what is attested,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monkies the common Re∣past of the Tigre.</NOTE> by these Woodmen, of the Tigre,
that when he intends to Prey on the Monkies (with which these
Woods abound) he uses this Artifice or Stratagem; the Monkies at
his first approach give warning by their confused Chattering, and im∣mediately
betake themselves to the highest and smallest Twigs of the
Trees; when the Tigre seeing them out of his reach, and sensible
of their fright, lies Couchant under the Tree and then falls a Roar∣ing,
at which they trembling let go their hold, and tumbling down
he at leisure picks them up to satisfy his Hunger: They are his ac∣customed
Repast, seldom making Man his Meal, and they are judged
(as St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Barbarians</HI> did him) guilty of some horrid Crime that
such Vengeance overtakes; the Woods and Mountains yielding
them variety of other Food. The Tigre is dull Scented, and not
long Nimble, Three Leaps Tiring him, otherwise it's probable he
would make more havock than he does. The She brings forth but
once in Twelve Years, and then but a single Cub; they are Ingend∣ring
Three Months, in which time their Fury as well as Lust rages
upon one another; thus has Providence suppressed the Growth of
this masterless Creature: Besides, if the Proverb be true, the Bitch
brings forth but once in her life, or very rarely more; <HI>Iteratus haud
partus leoenae contigit,</HI> notwithstanding <HI>Aelian</HI> says otherwise in his
4 <HI>lib. de Historiâ Animalium.</HI></P>
<P>The most frequent in these Woods are the lesser sort of Tigres
spotted like a Leopard; these are Cruel and Ravenous, but more
Fearful than the others are; that Monkies are their Food, the very
Ordure declares scattered up and down, where is visible the shagged
Coats or Hair of these Creatures.</P>
<P>Many of these Apes fell by our hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apes Anato∣mized.</NOTE> either for being noisy and
impertinent spoiling our Game, or provoking us by their constant
pursuing us, being of the largest size, upon which account many
came under my Knife; opening them I found and observed their se∣minary
Vessels turgid, their Virge White and Nervous. To Kill
one of these the Natives hold Piacular, calling them Half Men,
saying, once they were Men, but for their Laziness had Tails given
them and Hair to cover them: Towards <HI>Zeilon</HI> they are Deified; at
the Straits of <HI>Baligaot</HI> they pay them Tribute.</P>
<P>Bamboos make the gross of the Woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bamboos.</NOTE> which are High, Taper∣ing,
Thorny Trees, incumbred from the Roots with abundance of

<P>In the Groves about <HI>Carwar</HI> grows <HI>Cassia Lignum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cassia Lignum.</NOTE> <HI>Xylo-Cassia,</HI> or
Bastard Cinamon; the Trees are large as a Pear-Tree, a Leaf of the

like other Trees, of no different Smell or Taste till dried, when it
bites, and smells Spicy; the Leaf bruised and chewed smells like
strong Cinamon, and upon the Tongue is as hot as a Clove; the
Bark of the small Branches also when Green alters nothing in Taste
from Cinamon, but dried is more slimy, and is very good <HI>Cassia Lig∣num:</HI>
It bears little long Whitish Flowers, of no Smell nor Taste,
but the Leafs of the Branch that bear them have a more Aromatick
Taste.</P>

the knotty Branches which it bears aloft, send forth Green
Boughs more pliant, in Form Quadrangular, fed within by a Spongy
Marrow or Pith, on which at the Joints hang broad, thin, and po∣rous
Leafs, sending from the main Rib some Fibres, winding and
spreading like a Fan. This Prince of the <HI>Indian</HI> Forest was not so
attractive, though mightily glorious, but that at the same time I
was forced to take notice of the creeping Cow-Itch, raising its self
upon the Shrubs and Under-woods, there spending in lascivious
Twines its Verdure, leaving nothing but withered Stalks to be the
Props of its brindled Offspring, which is a small Cod covered with
a light and tickling Down; within, it includes in four Cavities, four
specked Beans; the fallen Leafs make some appearance of a Nobler
Stock, having a Countenance like those of Lawrel; the Root is dif∣ficult

make Bread of, as also <HI>Cushcush,</HI> which is Millet, Hemp, and Flax:
In the Inclosures <HI>Turmerick,</HI> which rises with a broad Leaf like our
Water Plantain, bearing a broad flaggy Leaf of a Span long, oblique∣ly
ribbed till it end in a Spear-Point at top; it proceeds immediately
from the Root by a winding Stalk, which the main Leafs embrace,
the other Leafs creeping through it till it rises Six Foot.</P>
<P>Ginger comes up like our <HI>Gentian;</HI> they pickle it well, but cannot
preserve it with Sugar.</P>
<P>Potatoes are their usual Banquet.</P>
<P>And to give the Soil its due Praise, it obeys in all things the first

<P>For these Blessings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Feast of <HI>Priapus.</HI></NOTE> as if Men were to lose their Reasons, and sink
below Brutes by a base Superstition, they are ready to acknowledge
a Stock for a Deity, rather than to go without, infatuated by the
Delusions of the Devil, being captivated at his Will; for which
cause they not only make Oblations to him, but give up their Souls
and Bodies to his Devotion: As might about this time have been be∣held
at an Idol Worship of <HI>Priapus,</HI> (where the Women prostitute
themselves to him, and receive the Pleasure of Copulation, all that
while being as it were possessed) at <HI>Semissar,</HI> on the other side of the
Water from our House, where he lay with Two and twenty, who
reckon it a great Honour, and the Husband thinks himself happy in
his <HI>Cornucopia.</HI></P>
<P>There are a sort of <HI>Jougies,</HI> Priests fit for such a God, among the
<HI>Linguits</HI> of this Country, who practise this daily; the Husbands
entertain them courteously, wash their Feet, and the whole Family is
at his Beck, as long as he stays to do the Wife a Kindness.</P>
<P>Others slash themselves with sharp Knives, and suffer themselves
to be hooked by the Muscles of the Back, and hang so some Hours
upon a Vow.</P>
<P>Under the <HI>Banyan</HI> Tree, an Altar with a Dildo in the middle being
erected, they offer Rice and Cocoe-Nuts to the Devil, and joining
some small Ladders together made of Osiers, do the like; when the
<HI>Gomcar</HI> or Bayliff of the Town takes a falched Knife for Sacrifice in
one Hand, and a Dunghil-Cock in the other, and cutting off its
Head, fixes it at top of the Ladder, and sprinkling the Blood they all
dance, and beat Brass Pots with a great Shout, saying, <HI>The Devil
must be pacified with Blood, God with Prayers.</HI></P>
<P>Some of these sell themselves to Wickedness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dregs of the People use Charms, or think they do so.</NOTE> and these must be
endued with the Spirit of Fascination, always nourishing a Familiar
in their Families, which they keep mostly in the forms of Snakes or
Serpents, appearing to them upon their Command; and undergo
fiery Afflictions to have the most hurtful Devil; and as they wreak
their Malice more powerfully, esteem themselves more in favour
with their Grand Master: These are the Dregs of the People, who
are full of Envy and Ill Designs, who glory in their Shame of In∣cantations
and Charms: Such as these are those that out of Fear
pray to the Devil and Evil Spirits, saying, <HI>God will do them no harm.</HI></P>
<P>The better sort acknowledge a God, and live in the Rules of their
Tribes, abstaining from Flesh, and all things of a Sensitive Being:
<PB N="180" REF="109"/>
<HI>Sicuti Pythagorici, qui herbis &amp; bellariis tantum vivebant:</HI> And these
Patronize these more Innocent Rites, such as the Swains asking Advice
of their Deities about Increase; and to that end offer Rice, Oyl, and
Cocoe-Nuts in a thick Grove, where they piled an huge Heap of
long Jars like <HI>Mortivans,</HI> about Figures resembling Serpents, before
which they present their unbloody Sacrifice by the Priest, the Peo∣ple
circling the whole Grove in a Ring, beating on Brass Instru∣ments,
and shouting.</P>
<P>In their <HI>Hooly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Sacri∣fice for the Fields.</NOTE> which is at their other Seed-time, I observed they
cut a whole Tree down to the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ots, and lopped off the under-Branches
till it became strait, when leaving the upper Boughs, they
shoulder'd it with great Clamours, the <HI>Brachmin</HI> beginning a Note
which they all followed: Thus they brought it into the Pale of their
Pagods, before which, easing it down at one end, the foremost made a
<HI>Salam,</HI> and hoisted it with the same Noise again, and about they went
three or four times repeating the same; which being finished, the
<HI>Arch-Brachmin</HI> digs an hole, and baptizes it with Holy Water, where∣in
they fix the Tree, crowning it with Flags aloft, and about the Bo∣dy
up to the Green Boughs they bind Wisps of Straw, to which
they put Fire, and look earnestly on the Flame, according to the
Ascent of which the <HI>Brachmin</HI> pronounces his Auguries; then they
offer Rice and Flowers, painting their Bodies with the Ashes, depart∣ing
with a Mace of Flowers carried before them, beating of Drums
and a great Noise. This resembles the <HI>Ambar vallis hostia,</HI> or Sa∣crifice
for the Fields; of which see <HI>Scaliger,</HI> and also <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q>Terque novas circum foelix fuit hostia fruges.</Q></P>
<P>But to be clear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether these Wretches do work by the Devil, or no.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; ut Fama ad liquidum producatur,</HI> let us consider,
that these Underlings of the People that do these Services to the
Devil, or are said so to do, may be aspersed: For the <HI>Brachmins,</HI> and
other the Purer Sort, as they account themselves, may defame them
only, because shedding of Blood is horrible to them, and therefore
Diabolical: Besides, those Diseases that are said to be Devils put into
one another, (which as many as I have met with, I have been cu∣riously
inquisitive of) their Phoenomenaes or Energies are discussed by
Natural Causes, and as often cured by Natural Means; but on the
contray, it is allowed where they resist them, it is suspicious: And
the Devil without doubt cannot easier work on any, than the Weak
and Simple, (wherefore he chose the Woman, not the Man) and
upon that account may probably delude and overawe these People,
that give themselves up to him wholly out of Fear, having not so
much Virtue, Fortitude, and Cunning, to resist and check their
own Lusts, as the Wiser sort. As for the visible appearance of a
Devil or Daemon (which they say is common among them, by those
that see it) I am convinced it may be credible; but in the mean
while, Rage and Melancholy Madness, assisted by the Infernal Pow∣er,
may create great Illusions to a Fancy fitted for such an Opera∣tion,
and they may think they see things which in reality are not so.</P>
<P>Now as these, by the low and mean Conceptions they have of a
Godhead, reach not the great Branch of its Omnipotency and Good∣ness,
<PB N="181" REF="109"/>
whereby it is able to defend them from all Assaults and Wiliness
of the Devil, depressing their Understandings, bow under the in∣tolerable
Yoak of his Slavery;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sublime Wit as much in the wrong as the depres∣sed.</NOTE> so there are a sort of sublimated
Wits, that will own neither God nor Devil, and put all things upon
Chance so long, that the very Notions they framed to themselves,
after beating of the Air, fly out of their Giddy Heads <HI>in Fumo.</HI> Let
them place themselves under the <HI>Aequator,</HI> where the Sun is at pre∣sent,
and take a Prospect on each hand of the Orderly Course of the
Creation; How he passes the Ecliptick, and dispenses his Irradiations
as far as either Pole: How within the Tropicks, entring the first De∣gree
of the <HI>Ram</HI> till the second Degree of <HI>Taurus,</HI> it is Summer;
that is, from <HI>January</HI> till the One and twentieth of <HI>March;</HI> when
the Woods are most denuded of their old Leafs by the parching
Heat of the Sun, though new ones succeeding, the Trees keep their
perpetual Verdure; yet these lying on the Ground, makes this time
then the most like Autumn of any till the Rains fall; which while
the Sun is over their Heads make their Winter; till which come, it
would be unsufferable living here, did not the Variable Winds ga∣ther
the Clouds to obscure the Sun: After the Rains, follows their
Spring, when by reason of the Remoteness of the Sun it is most
pleasant living. Thus truly might <HI>Ovid</HI> be deceived, whilst he only
reasoned, and not experimented, when he sang of the Zones and the

Nations Time has long since worn out of the <HI>Indian</HI> Annals.
Something they do speak of King <HI>Pore,</HI> but so uncertain, that it is a
doubt whether ever he and <HI>Alexander</HI> waged War, though good
Authors do attest it. But it is plain that Two hundred and seventy
Years ago, between the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Scythian Tartars,</HI> under <HI>Tamer∣lane,</HI>
there was begun, what after-Emperors compleated by the then

this day a Name to as large a Province as is in all <HI>India;</HI> the shal∣low
Currents of which River stretching themselves far and near to
the River <HI>Ganges</HI> almost, has given occasion to Geographers to call
it a Peninsula. Omitting these Disputes, I shall at present apply my
self to give you a faithful Chorography and Account of those things
that fell under my Remark: It is then the largest Country in <HI>Asia,</HI>
which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> divides into Within and Without the River <HI>Ganges,</HI>
being in Length from the <HI>Golden Chersonese,</HI> now called <HI>Comory,</HI> 3600
Miles: In the most <HI>Northern</HI> part the Day lengthens to Fifteen Hours,
but in the <HI>Southern</HI> it has no more or less than Twelve: The Breadth
of it, from the widest place, to wit, <HI>Bengal</HI> to <HI>Candahar,</HI> 1500
Miles; from whence, like a Wedge, it lessens into the Cape of <HI>Co∣mory.</HI>
On the <HI>West</HI> it was formerly bordered by the River <HI>Indus;</HI> on
the <HI>North</HI> by the dispersed Mountains from <HI>Taurus;</HI> from the <HI>East</HI> it
<PB N="186" REF="112"/>
is washed with the Oriental Sea, and from the <HI>South</HI> with the
<HI>Indian.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Land in all places very fruitful,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>India</HI> produ∣ces Three Harvests in some places.</NOTE> and enjoys a Temperater
Air than would be allowed by the Poet under the Fifth Zone, under
which the greatest part of it lies; as often as the Sun visits the
Arctic Pole, it brings with it grateful Showers and Winds (whose
Heat otherwise would be intolerable) by which the Earth is cooled
and made Productive; neither in the extreamest Heat does it want
by the equality of Days and Nights after Sun-set, the favourable
Dews of the Heavens, when you shall soon perceive a kind Moisture
fall to refresh the Earth, and nourish the almost scorch'd up Plants;
though these alone are not so powerful to take away the Labour from
the industrious Husbandman, who this Season is forced by artificial
Channels to assist Nature to produce, otherwise she would fall one
short of a threefold Harvest in some places, every Year; but every
where they have a double Harvest.</P>
<P>As the Sun becomes Twice Vertical to them within the Tropicks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Year made up of Lunary, not Calendar Months.</NOTE>
at each Tropick but once, beyond never; so nearer the Equator the
Sun and Stars ascend and descend more directly, but the farther from
the Equator the more Obliquely, whereby the dawn of Light here
is but short before either the appearance or fall of these Bodies, when
as the Twilight is some Hours after Sun-set or afore Sun-rise the nearer
either Pole: Having premised this, know they begin their Alma∣nack
with our Lawyers, or rather when the Sun is in the Equinoctial
Line; but their Months being Lunary, every Third Year bears an
Intercalary one, which they clap in <HI>August,</HI> and count it double:

Luminaries.</P>
<P>What has been Experienced in the particular Accounts, I must
confirm again in this general one, That the first Full Moon in <HI>May</HI>
brings the Rains, when it Rains a Fortnight only, and holds up till
the middle of <HI>June,</HI> in which times, Empyemas, Fluxes, Fevers of
all sorts (except Pestilential) Haemorrhages, rage; after the Rains
are fully settled, it grows Healthy. From the setling in of the
Rains till the Full Moon in <HI>August,</HI> it Rains without intermission, after
which it clears up for a Fortnight, and with little variation (bating
the accidental Causes of its beginning earlier or later) it Rains all
<HI>September</HI> till the <HI>Elephant</HI> breaks up, the last Rainy Star: After
which is the Harvest for Rice, when it is gathered; and then just af∣ter
the Rains they are most Sickly, the Sun exhaling Vapours, the
Earth grows Muddy and Stinking, though abundantly Productive:
From thence to the latter end of <HI>January</HI> commences the Cold Sea∣son,
when their Bodies are Healthier, and a lovely Verdure Cloaths
the Earth; at the latter end of this they reap another Harvest with∣out
extraordinary pains; all this time the Evenings are very sharp,
and at <HI>Surat</HI> I have seen an hoar Frost in the Morning. From <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI>
the first, till the Rains set in, are the Heats, and in <HI>March</HI> the
Leafs fall off the Trees, yet always supplied with fresh, so that the
Trees are always Green, though the Grass and Fodder are quite
burnt up; and with difficulty, by the advantage of Aquiducts, a
lean Harvest is brought forth: The Peasants Morning and Evening
draw Water out of Wells by <HI>Buffola</HI>'s, or Oxen; or else by a
thwart Post poised with a sufficient weight at the extremity, laid
over one fixed in the Earth; the Water is drawn by a Bucket of Goats
Skins; others have Pans or Buckets of Leather hanging round about
a Wheel, some always in the Water, others rising up, and at the
same time others pouring out as the Wheel turns round: And thus
are their best Gardens kept alive.</P>
<P>The Mountains here are one continued Ridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountains:</NOTE> dividing the Two
Coasts each from other, and are all along called the <HI>Gaot;</HI> they run
<HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> till they cross the <HI>Imaus;</HI> and are the reason of some
difference of the Seasons, both in respect of themselves and Low-Lands:
<PB N="188" REF="113"/>
They are plentifully stored with Woods, and Increase of all
things, except Rivers, which are in some Places compensated by
living Springs out of the Rocks, but every where by Water falling
in the Rains.</P>
<P>The Rivers are innumerable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> but those of greatest fame are <HI>In∣dus</HI>
and <HI>Ganges,</HI> the latter not only for its many Navigable Streams
for some Hundreds of Leagues, but for its Purity in the esteem of
the most Religious; besides all which, are great Tanks or Ponds of
Rain-Water, where it wants the other Benefits, with deep Wells, of
extraordinary Costs and Charges; some purely for Pomp, and to
transmit their Names to Posterity; others for the good of Travellers,
but most for the sake of Religion, in which they are extravagantly
profuse, every great City striving to outvye each other; the most ad∣mirable
whereof are those cut on high Hills and Fortresses thereon,
out of the main Rocks, seeming rather the Works of many Ages
than one to finish them: At <HI>Rajapore</HI> are Hot Baths; here are very
few other Mineral Waters.</P>
<P>The Plain Country is Rich in all things necessary;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Country rich in In∣crease.</NOTE> Pasturage, by
reason of the long Summers Drought, being the only lack; which
in the Rains and Cold Season they have Time and Store to provide
against. Cocoes grow all along the Sea-side round <HI>India,</HI> within
the Tropicks, and Beetle-Nut is in great Request, not only for that it
is the Courteous Entertainment or Farewel at all Friendly Interviews,
but because wrapped in <HI>Pawn</HI>-Leaves with <HI>Chinam,</HI> it exhilarates and
makes a kind of pleasant Drunkenness, if much eaten, as the Na∣tives
of any fashion are seldom without it in their Mouths; and these
are peculiar to the Low-Countries as are Water-Melons; other Fruits,
as Grapes, Mangoes, and the like, are the common Growth of <HI>In∣dia:</HI>
Rice thrives best in Watry Places, it swimming always there∣in
till Harvest, when the Water is let out by Drains; all other Corn
rejoices better in drier Grounds; Cotton is a Lover of the same, from
whence comes all the Wealth to <HI>India, quae effodiuntur opes,</HI> which
are dug for in other Places and laid up here.</P>
<P>Woods are every where, in which sometimes are met Inhabi∣tants
not yet mentioned, and for their Solitariness called <HI>Men of the
Woods,</HI> or more truly <HI>Satyrs;</HI> there are <HI>Nereids</HI> too, or <HI>Men of the
Rivers,</HI> but dye as soon as taken: A Couple of the former I saw
asleep in the day-time, in the Night they Sport and Eat; they were
both in a Parrot-Cage, they had Heads like an Owl, Bodied like a
Monkey, without Tails; only the first Finger of the Right Hand
was armed with a Claw like a Birds, otherwise they had Hands, and
Feet which they walk upright on, not pronely, as the other Beasts
do; they were coloured like a Fox, of the length of Half a Yard;
though they grow bigger till Twelve Years old, when they copulate.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Brachmins</HEAD>
<P>Are chiefly distinguished by <HI>Butts</HI> and <HI>Sinais;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their men of Learning.</NOTE> from these two
Roots spring the other Branches: The difference was occasioned by a
Famine in the Low-Countries, where the latter resided, on which ac∣count
they were constrained to break their Fast with Fish, or else
starve; for which reason they are greatly despised by the purer <HI>Butt,</HI>
having never deviated from his <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Institution and Primary
Abstinence from all living Creatures. Yet notwithstanding, the <HI>Si∣nai</HI>
keeps his Cotton-String Badge (the Characteristick Note of a
<HI>Brachmin</HI>) under his Left Shoulder as well as the <HI>Butt,</HI> and has his
Disciples.</P>
<P>The <HI>Butts</HI> addict themselves to the profoundest Mysteries in their
Religion, giving themselves over to an exact Regular Life, abstracted
from all Worldly Employments, unless such as are for the saving
and preserving of Life, the Chiefest and Skilfullest Physicians being
of their Tribe: These are the Masters of all their Heathen Cere∣monies,
or Doctors of their Canon Law, every Tribe being instruct∣ed
by them; they chiefly consist in Washing, Abstinence, and other
Austerities imposed at their Pleasure.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sinais</HI> are more biass'd by Secular Offices, out of which are
made their fighting Bishops, <HI>Defies,</HI> or Farmers of the King's Rents,
<HI>Pundits</HI> (Governors of Towns and Provinces), Physicians, Ac∣countants,
Scrivans, and Interpreters: Any of these, if they ar∣rive
to any smattering in Learning, are admired and highly reveren∣ced
by the Vulgar. Their <HI>Cabala's</HI> or Pious Secrets are kept in a
Language communicated to none but themselves, as are all the Ar∣canaes
of every Science, written in a peculiar Character; they are
very dogmatical in their Dictates to the People, singing them out in
a Lofty Tone, as the <HI>Fauns</HI> and <HI>Bards</HI> of old are reported, as the <HI>Sy∣bils</HI>
by <HI>Lactantius,</HI> the <HI>Salians</HI> by <HI>Livy,</HI> the <HI>Druids</HI> by <HI>Caesar,</HI> the
<HI>Delphian</HI> Enigmaes by <HI>Herodotus,</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> Rites by <HI>Eustathius:
Suas nimirum cogitationes non eâ pervulgatâ &amp; detritâ &amp; dissolutâ quâ

<P>God they say is incomparably Good;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Notion of God.</NOTE> in some of their Languages
they hardly have a name for Hell; their Notions of the World's
Creation and the Origine of all things, are mere confused Stories;
their Account of Time is perplexed, and not to be reckoned up. For
the Immortality of the Soul, they rely as well on <HI>Plato</HI> as <HI>Pythago∣ras,
(viz.</HI>) That it is transmigrated, and in such a Revolution of time
they appear in the World again, Princes or <HI>Rajahs,</HI> according to the
<PB N="191" REF="114"/>
Demerits of their former living, or Penalties inflicted on them to pu∣rify
them; their Souls not being informed, but inclosed as a Bird in
a Cage.</P>
<P>Whence it is that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conceit of Transmi∣gration forci∣ble to Merits.</NOTE> propped by these Persuasions, the Women
freely Sacrifice themselves, in hopes of coming into the World
great and famous, after they have passed the <HI>Limbo</HI> of Transmigra∣tion
with their Husbands; and in the mean while are Canonized and
Invoked as Saints by their Kindred and Relations; and their Patri∣archs
oblige themselves to incredible Abstinence from Food, for ma∣ny
days together refusing any Sustenance, undergoing the strictest
Penances; having learned from <HI>Pythagoras, Angustam &amp; asperam esse
viam ad vitam beatam.</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SCIENCES</HEAD>
<P>In Esteem among them are principally Magick and Judicial Astrolo∣gy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their aptness to learn Lan∣guages, and Skill in Phi∣losophy.</NOTE>
one of the Sectators of which on all accounts are consulted, as
well by <HI>Moors</HI> as <HI>Gentues;</HI> Grammar and Rhetorick, some of them
being Masters of <HI>Persian, Indostan, Arabick, Sanscript</HI> (or Holy Lan∣guage)
<HI>Portugueze,</HI> and all the depending Speeches of <HI>Indostan,</HI> as
<HI>Duccany, Moratty, Conchany,</HI> and the like; besides the <HI>Canatick,</HI> in
which all their Sonnets and Poesies are expressed, being softer and
more melting than the others; which is an Argument also of its
Antiquity, <HI>Indostan</HI> not having a Character to express its self in, on
which the later Dialects depend. Elocution, Physick, Metaphysicks,
are not out of their Element: Their Philosophers maintain an <HI>Ari∣stotelian</HI>
Vacuity; nor are they quite ignorant of Medicks, though
Anatomy is not approved, wherein they lean too much on Traditi∣on,
being able to give a very slender account of the Rational Part
thereof. In what Perfection Musick stands (as I am no competent
Judge) I could never give my Ears the trouble to examine, it seem∣ing
loud and barbarous; yet they observe Time and Measure in their
Singing and Dancing, and are mightily delighted with their Tum∣bling
and Noise. They as much dislike our shriller Musick, hardly
allowing our Wayts fit to play to Bears, and our Stringed Instruments
strike not their hard-to-be-raised Fancies; but our Organs are the
Musick of the Spheres with them, charming them to listen as long
as they play. Arithmetick being the most profitable Science, is the
best understood by them; to which they have a Natural Propensity,
and will in a trice, without the help of Pen or Ink cast up the dif∣ficultest
Sums, and never pause upon it.</P>
<P>In some Places they write on Cocoe-Leafs dried,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Write on Leafs.</NOTE> and then use an
Iron Style; or else on Paper, when they use a Pen made with a Reed,
for which they have a Brass Case, which holds them and the Ink too,
always stuck at the Girdles of their <HI>Scrivans.</HI></P>
<P>Among these are enrolled the <HI>Muttanies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Muttanies <HI>and</HI> Jougies.</NOTE> <HI>Jougies,</HI> or Pilgrims,
who lead a Beastly Life, having all things common, and are courted
wherever they come; nor do they ever depart, without leaving a
Stain to their Profession: When they ease Nature they scrape an
Hole, as Dogs or Cats do, to bury their Excrements, to prevent
breeding of Insects. These are covered, the first with a White Sheet,
<PB N="192" REF="115"/>
and carry Perfuming Pots, and Bless all as they pass; the others have
a Snapsack, a <HI>Mirchal,</HI> and a patch'd Goat, rambling up and down
as the <HI>Fakiers;</HI> the first are buried with their Heels upwards and
Heads downwards; the others sometimes buried, sometimes burnt.</P>
<P>At the Heel of these may be reckoned the <HI>Bengal</HI> Juglers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Juglers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Moun∣tebanks,
and Conjurers, as also the Dancing People; these are Va∣grants,
that travel to delude the Mobile by their <HI>Hocus Pocus</HI> Tricks
(living promiscuously like our Gypsies); among whom I saw one
who swallowed a Chain, such as our Jacks have, and made it clink
in his Stomach; but pulling it out, it was not so pleasant to the
Spectators (being mostly Ladies, for whose Diversion he was brought)
they puking when it was accompanied with a filthy roapy Slaver.</P>
<P>Others presented a Mock-Creation of a Mango-Tree, arising from
the Stone in a short space (which they did in Hugger-Mugger, be∣ing
very careful to avoid being discovered) with Fruit Green and
Ripe; so that a Man must stretch his Fancy, to imagine it Witch∣craft;
though the common sort think no less: <HI>Sed Magus quò peri∣tior
eò detestabilior.</HI></P>
<P>I was promised to see a Fellow that cast up his Tripes by his Mouth,
Stomach and all, shewing them to the Beholders; but he was excu∣sed,
having some time allowed him to prepare himself for it: In his
stead were brought me two; the first of which, by Suction or draw∣ing
of his Breath, so contracted his lower Belly, that it had nothing
left to support it, but fell flat to his Loins, the Midriff being forced
into the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and the Muscles of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> as clearly marked
out by the stiff Tendons of the <HI>Linea Alba,</HI> as by the most accurate
Dissection could be made apparent, he moving each Row like living
Columns by turns. The Aetiology whereof I think to be this; that
while all the Contents of the Belly are moved upwards, all Respiration
is expelled, only the voluntary Motion of the Animal Spirits acts
upon the Nerves (the Mind or Soul commanding them) while the
Vital or Natural are compelled to the contrary.</P>
<P>After this I saw another Fellow of a good Habit of Body, that
had taught himself by use to depress his <HI>Sternum,</HI> with the <HI>Serratus
Posticus Inferior, Sacro lumbus,</HI> and Triangular Muscles, so that the
Cartilaginous Substance of the Ribs, which Anatomists separate for
Dissection of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and throw it back over the Face, by this
means was crowded in, that it made a notable Cavity as deep as the
<HI>Spine</HI> would suffer; in the mean while the Man was almost strangled,
as if pressed to death; for under this Constraint neither he nor the
former could take their Breath, yet remained so some time: Which
may be a visible Instance that divers Urinators may continue a long
space, being inured from their Infancy to keep under Water. From the
rest of these I observed nothing more excellent than what is perform∣ed
by our Rope-dancers, for Feats of Activity, or Slight of Hand.
These pester every open place in great Cities and Publick Fairs, as
they do in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The next Rank,</HEAD>
<P>Is of the Soldiers, commonly called <HI>Rashpoots,</HI> who by their Valour
<PB N="193" REF="115"/>
have won unto themselves the Perpetuity of their Arms, and the
Credit of being called in to the Aid of divers Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Crocus</HI>-co∣loured Coat intimates a Resolution to dye, or be Conqueror.</NOTE> and are in con∣tinual

their own Cast; fighting Pell-mell, as every one is inspired from the
Pay they receive; their Arms are Sword, Pike, and Buckler. A
Soldier that puts on a <HI>Crocus</HI>-dye, intimates a Resolution either to dye
or be Conqueror.</P>
<P>Opium is frequently eaten in great quantities by the <HI>Rashpoots,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opium eaten often, and in quantities.</NOTE>
<HI>Queteries,</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> when they fight, which makes them run up∣on
any Enterprize with a raging Resolution to dye or be victorious.
Before Engaging, it is usual for them to embrace one another, as if
parting for another World; esteeming it happier to be killed in their
Vocation, than to submit to the Lust of a Conqueror; their very
Women disdaining to own them for their Husbands, when they
once turn their Back upon their Enemies: Of one of which Vira∣goes
goes this Story; Her Mate had made an Escape honourable
enough for a prudent Retreat, when coming home and craving Meat
from his Spouse, after many obloquious Salutes she put this Affront
on him, she served him with a Brass Ladle, whereas before his Meals
were taken up with one made of Iron; whereof he demanding the
Reason, she tartly replied, <HI>Lest the sight of Iron should turn your Sto∣mach
from your Victuals, as it had done from Fighting.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Banyan</HEAD>
<P>Follows the Soldier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether the <HI>Banyan</HI> be a <HI>Jew.</HI></NOTE> though as contrary in Humour, as the Antipodes
in the same Meridian are opposite one to another: These have for∣got
if ever they were <HI>Jews,</HI> or no; but if any of these People are such,
these are most likely; and by a double Right of <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> are
a Compound of the greatest Cheat in the World, the fittest there∣fore
to make Brokers and Merchants of: They are devout Proselytes
in the Worship of this Countrey, and tenacious of their Rites and
Customs; strict Observers of Omens, so that in travelling ten
Miles they shall sometimes double the Ground, to avoid encountring
a <HI>Caphala</HI> of Asses, or to take the Hand of a Flock of Goats or Cows
grazing: In the Rains they will not ride in a Coach, for fear they
should kill the Insects generated in the Cart-Ruts, or stinking Puddles:
So foolishly superstitious are they and precise in Matters of Religion;
in cases of Trade they are not so hide-bound, giving their Conscien∣ces
more Scope, and boggle at no Villany for an Emolument.</P>

their Coulters unarmed mostly, Iron being scarce, but they have
hard Wood will turn their light Grounds. The <HI>Gentues</HI> thrash their
Corn with a Stick, not a Flail; the <HI>Moor</HI>-men that are Husbandmen
tread it out with Oxen (but muzzle their Mouths), which they do
in the open Fields, before they carry it home; fixing a Stake in the
Earth, and yoaking the Oxen three, four, or more abreast, fasten
them to a turning Pole, passing round till all be done.</P>
<P><HI>Coolies, Frasses,</HI> and <HI>Holencores,</HI> are the Dregs of the People, and
are not permitted to have their Funeral Rites or Marriages with the
others; so abject, that the others think themselves defiled if they
touch or converse with them.</P>
<P>All these are distinguished one from another by the Cut of their
Beards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinguished by their seve∣ral Paintings on their Fore∣heads,</NOTE> or different Painting of their Bodies and Foreheads, as well
as winding of their Turbants. A <HI>Brachmin</HI> paints himself on the Front
with a <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Y between his Eyebrows, descending to his Nose,

<P>The <HI>Gentues</HI> wear little Beards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Cuts of their Beards.</NOTE> and shave them; the <HI>Moors</HI> great
Beards, and trim them only to keep them decent: And since their
Barbers are so necessary, as well to give them their distinguishing
Shape, as for other Uses, we will let you know they seldom keep
Shop, but go about the City with a Checquered Apron over their
Shoulders, and a Mirror in their Hands, which they offer any to see
their Face in; and if any employ them, they are well paid with a
<HI>Gosbeek,</HI> much under a Farthing: When they pluck out a Razor not
an Inch long, a Bason of Brass as big as a Coffee-dish, and a piece of
Castle-Soap, which they dip into the Bason of Water, and rub about
the Lips or Head, with no more Water than it gathers up, and so
shave very well; and for the Head few out-do them, both for Ease
and Readiness: They have an Iron Tool also, one end to pick the Ears,
another to cut the Nails, both which they do dextrously, clearing
the Ears of great quantities of that thick Wax inclosed therein;
they also wash and anoint their Bodies, it being not obsolete here to
anoint every day with Sweet Oyls, and the Poor, both Men and Wo∣men,
with Cocoe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Nut Oyl, which being Rank, together with their
eating <HI>Hing</HI> and Garlick, makes them always smell so strong, that
it is very offensive passing through Places of Resort, before one be
accustomed to them; they also rub the Hair of their Head with a
sweet Powder to get the sweat out, and then bedawb it with stinking
Oyl, which they say preserves it: In the Bath or Hummums they
have a large Province.</P>

their <HI>Jageah,</HI> or Annuity arises; as not thinking it fit to trust them
with Forces or Money in their allotted Principalities, lest they
should be tempted to unyoke themselves, and slip their Neck from
the Servitude imposed on them; for which purpose their Wives and
Children are left as Pledges at Court, while they follow the Wars,
or are Administring in Cities or Provinces; from whence when
they return, they have nothing they can call their own, only what
they have Cheated by false Musters and a hard Hand over both Soldi∣ers

forced to refund to the King, though not restore to the Oppressed;
for all Money, as well as Goods and Lands, are properly his, if he

<P>Out of these are made Generals of Armies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ombrahs.</HI></NOTE> under whom are
Commanders of Hundreds and Thousands, as the Centurions and

<P>A Cavalier is Armed with a Poniard at the Right side of his Gir∣dle;

Brown; such as Sail to and again constantly in these Climates, by
going Naked and exposed to the Sun, being almost as Swarthy as
the Natives, with this difference, that by Cloathing the Sunburnt
wears off;
but contrariwise, it remains indeleble on the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Infants when newly Born have the same Flesh Colour as ours;
but in a few Days, by the inbred Humour, and the Sun's Heat, de∣clare
their Hew to be of the same with their Parents.</P>
<P>The Women are Small,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women of the same Species as others, the Position of their Veins being the same.</NOTE> and most an end Plump, and Short in
respect to the Men; as to the order which Nature observes in them
they are more forward than ours in <HI>Europe,</HI> and leave off Child∣bearing
sooner. It is reported the Menstruums of the <HI>Africans</HI> are
pernicious, but there is no such slander here, these being Neat,
Well-shaped, and Obsequious to their Husbands; for the different
Positions of their Veins it's a silly Query, they being of the same
Species of the rest of the World, bating their Education, which is
agreeable to them, and bear as good a Meen naturally, as ours in∣structed
by the Masters of Behaviour; they keep their Breasts
bound up carefully, and on that account are no more extended than
they should be; they are quick in Labour, and Affectionate to their
Children, Bearing them Naked on their Hips a straddle; are well
Proportioned, and for that reason not ashamed to shew the Motion
of their Bodies, all their Limbs being visible, yet love to hide what
should not be seen: They are Cleanly, as well in their Cookery as
in their Bodies, Pruning themselves by plucking the budding
Hairs off their Privities up by the Roots, they being all as smooth
there as the back of their Hands, though they suffer the Hair of their
Heads to grow in Tresses, which the Rich Embroider with Gold,
Coronets, and Rich Jewels; the Poor Brade with Strings of <HI>Jassa∣min</HI>
Flowers, and make Necklaces of the same; the Rich have
their Arms and Feet Fettered with Gold and Silver, the meaner
with Brass, Glass, or Tuthinag; besides Rings at their Noses, Ears,
Toes, and Fingers: Their Attire alters not into new Modes, nor
need they a Taylor; a <HI>Lungy</HI> being tied loose over their Shoulders
Belt-wise, and tucked between their Legs in nature of short Breeches,
besides a short Wastecoat, or Ephod to keep up their Breasts, being
all their Garb; going constantly without Shooes or Stockins, Shoes
being allowed their Midwives only, which are like the Mens, only
a few Silk Tufts upon them for distinction sake. Those that have
Buried their Husbands (or rather Burnt them) are rifled of all their
Jewels, and Shaved, always wearing a Red <HI>Lungy,</HI> whereby to be known
that they have not undergone the Conflagration; for which cause
they are despised, and live more Uncomfortably than the meanest
Servant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> Women are all Cloathed like the Men, as has been
said elsewhere, only Vailed when they go abroad; and thus the <HI>In∣dian</HI>
Women are Habited.</P>
<P>They use no swathing to their Babes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Few Crooked or Deformed.</NOTE> and have very few deformed
or Dwarfs among them; are Temperate, and live to a good Old Age,
when their Hair also turns from Black to Grey. What <HI>Ovid</HI> relates
<PB N="199" REF="118"/>
of the <HI>Glaucus</HI> Fish, <HI>Aestivo nunquam conspectus Sydere Glaucus,</HI> is true
in these Hot Countries of the Colour of the Eyes of these Sun-burnt
people, for I never saw but one Grey-ey'd, and therefore I suppose
them rare; (unless they should tincture them with some <HI>Fucus,</HI> it
may be of <HI>Antimony,</HI> which we read in the Sacred Page the <HI>Jews</HI> used,
especially the Women, both to preserve them from Filth, and to
procure a graceful Blackness, 2 <HI>Kings 9. Jer. 4. Ezek.</HI> 23.) Nor
but one Dwarf, which was a <HI>Brachmin,</HI> 109 Years old, well limb'd,
and of a quick Apprehension, being not Three Foot high, free from
the Infirmities of Age.</P>
<P>In general they are melancholy inclined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of their Blackness left in sus∣pence.</NOTE> and love a sedate Life
more than Action; and whether that may not add to their Dye, I
leave to the Sceptical; and conclude in this Point of these <HI>Asiaticks,</HI>
as <HI>Naso</HI> did of his <HI>Africks;</HI>
<Q><L>Sanguine tum credunt in corpora summa vocato</L>
<L>Aethiopum populos nigrum traxisse colorem.</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Wives dress their Husbands Victuals, fetch Water,
and grind their Corn with an Hand-Mill, when they sing, chat, and
are merry; such prevalency has Custom: They make their Bread as
thin as Wafers, bak'd on broad round Plates or Stones, commonly of
Rice; the <HI>Moors</HI> is made of Wheat, thicker and oblong, bestuck with
Seeds to correct Wind, and mostly bak'd in a Furnace, which they
stick to the sides, when Dough, as we see Cow-Turds on a Mud-Wall.
Boiled Rice, <HI>Nichany, Millet,</HI> and (in great Scarcity) Grass-Roots,
are the common Food of the ordinary People; which with a Pipe
of Tobacco contents them.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CITIES</HEAD>
<P>Are many and Populous; three more Renowned than the rest (<HI>Dhil∣ly,
Lhor,</HI> and <HI>Agra</HI>), for the Residence of the Emperor in one of
these for every Season of the Year: The rest are known either for
Trade, or the Provinces whose Names they bear.</P>
<P>Their Buildings suit with the Country and State of the Inhabi∣tants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses built for Con∣veniency.</NOTE>
being mostly contrived for Conveniency: The Poorer are
made of Boughs or <HI>Oleas</HI> of the <HI>Palmeroes,</HI> or Leafs of <HI>Teke,</HI> and
thatch'd both Sides and Coverings; the middle sort of the <HI>Gentues</HI>
with Mud one Story; floored with Cow-dung, which they do afresh
every day, after they have swept and cleansed them: Under which,
their Houshold-Gods, themselves, their Family, and Cattel, are all housed,
and many times in no distinct Partition: They plaster Cow-dung be∣fore
their Doors, and so keep them clean, having a little place or
two built up a Foot Square of Mud, where they plant <HI>Calaminth,</HI> or
(by them called) <HI>Tulce,</HI> which they worship every Morning, and
tend with diligence.</P>
<P>The Richer and the <HI>Moors</HI> build with Stone and Mortar, some∣times
with Brick, making small Shew without, but delicately contri∣ved
within, with Tanks, Airy and cool <HI>Choultries,</HI> private Recesses
for their Women, Tarass'd atop, and sometimes three or four Stories
<PB N="200" REF="119"/>
high: Their Furniture is moveable, as Rich Carpets to sit on the
Floor, and Rich Cushions behind them, without any Chairs within-doors,
unless large Elbow Chairs when they sit at their Doors smoking
in State.</P>
<P>And in these they spend their Lives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Live to a good Age,</NOTE> and have the Length of
Days here as in other places, they spinning them out a long while:
Whether the Cause may be attributed to the Air, or Temperance in
their Diet, I know not: Yet this is certain, they are careful what
they eat shall be well dressed, that the Stomach be neither over∣charged,
or have much trouble to concoct.</P>
<P>And as they are careful what they take into their Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By Care of their Diet,</NOTE> so are
they solicitous to evacuate in good order, always washing their Fun∣daments,
and squatting when they make Water; nor do the Wo∣men
scruple to do their Occasions in Publick Streets or Highways,
going hand in hand for that purpose at Set-times of the day, and if
any pass by in the Interim, will turn their bare Backsides upon them,
but will hide their Faces; and this at Sun-rise and Sun-set every
day they do in Droves; Men by themselves, and Women by them∣selves;
if in the City, most an end, under dead Walls, where when
they have finished, they wash the Filth off with their Left Hand, be∣cause
they feed themselves with the Right. The <HI>Moors</HI> think hard of
them for this Freedom; nor do they conceive a better Opinion of our
Women, when they see an <HI>Englishman</HI> salute them with a Kiss, or
walk together in a Garden to take the Innocent Diversion there: So
that the Jealousy of the <HI>Moor</HI> must not reflect on the Modesty of our
<HI>Indian</HI> Women.</P>
<P>As soon as they are gone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Cleanli∣ness.</NOTE> the Cows come and lick up their Ordure
(which they watch for), being nothing but Herbs, Roots, or
Pulse, digested without any other mixture either of Flesh or Strong
Drink: If they unload themselves out of the Town, they make to∣wards
the River-side, or Brinks of their Ditches, and leave a filthy
Stink behind them, notwithstanding they eat nothing Carnous, which
remains upon their Excrements; and for that reason it is somewhat
strange the Kine should be so fond of them: And hence is it that in
their Streets, and near the Towns and Cities, it is but ill taking the
Air. Yet however Natural this becomes to them, as well as the rest
of Mankind, they are not in this particular to be taxed with Sloth
and Sluttery in respect of their Bodies; for besides their constant
Washings at the Times of their Devotion, they never eat nor drink
before they have cleansed themselves with Water poured all over them
from Head to Foot; nor will they suffer their secret Parts to harbour
any Nastiness, they using Depilatories for Breast, Arm-pits and
Groins, are always shaving their Heads and Beards, cutting their
Nails, washing their Mouths, and rubbing their Teeth, whereby
they look like Ivory.</P>
<P>And since Cleanliness is the next in esteem to Godliness in Human
Society,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Wash∣ers and other Craftsmen work well for little Money.</NOTE> I will conclude with their Washers, which are Women as
well as Men; they are hired at easy Rates, and are the best in the
World, as our <HI>Calicuts</HI> transmitted hither declare; they have each a
little Pit, into which the Water springs, and near it a great smooth
Stone, on which they beat their Cloaths till clean; and if for Fa∣mily-use,
<PB N="201" REF="119"/>
starch them with <HI>Congee,</HI> and so carry them home when
dried; if for Sale, they lay them a Whitening, and after <HI>Congee</HI> or
stiffen them, and so deliver them to the Packers, Labour being to
them instead of Soap, for were they at much Expence therein they
could not live, their Pay being inconsiderable. And by this small
Taste of their unweariedness in Pains-taking, their Cheapness of
every thing, and their faring hard, all their other Craftsmen may
be valued, who work for nothing, comparatively with our <HI>Europeans;</HI>
though in many things they exceed them for Curiosity, as in staining
of Calicuts, and fine Work either in Gold or Silver.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">BEZOAR.</HEAD>
<P>THE Monkey <HI>Bezoars</HI> which are long, are the best; those that
are rough prove commonly faulty, breaking with Stones in the
middle: Others in form of Tares, somewhat flat, which break
in smaller Stones in the middle, are better than the rough ones.</P>
<P><HI>Bezoar</HI> is tried sundry ways: As the rubbing Chalk upon a Paper, then
rubbing the Stone hard upon the Chalk, if it leave an Olive-Colour it is
good. Also touch any with a Red-hot Iron, which you suspect because
their Colour is lighter than ordinarily they use to be, and if they fry like
Resin or Wax, they are naught. Sometimes they are tried by putting
them into clear Water, and if there arise upon them small white Bubbles,
they are good, and if none, they are doubtful. The use of the Hot
Iron is esteemed infallible.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>MOSK.</HEAD>
<P>It is best to buy it in the Cod, for so it will be preserved; that which
openeth with a bright <HI>Mosk</HI> Colour is the best, and will yield per Ounce.
When taken out of the Cod, if a little being chawed, and rubbed with
a Knife on clean Paper, do look smooth, bright, or yellowish, it is pro∣bably
good, but if the Colour be as it were mixed with Gravel, it is bad.
The Goodness is best discerned <HI>per</HI> Scent.</P>

<P>The Rough Diamonds that seem Greenest, prove of a good Water when
cut; and those that seem White when rough, prove often Bluish
being cut.</P>
<P>Care is to be taken likewise in Choice of Rough Diamonds, to avoid
those that have Veins, for they will never cut well, seeming as if they
were filed with a rough File.</P>
<P>For vending, Stones of six Grains and under, to one and a half,
are best.</P>
<P>For Trial of a Diamond, take a Pointed Diamond, such as Glaziers
use, try it on any Stone but a Diamond, and it will cut the same.</P>
<P>The Diamond that is Sandy, or hath any Foulness in it, or is of a Blue,
Brown, or Yellow Water, is not worth half the Price of a perfect Stone
of a White Water.</P>
<P>For cutting of Diamonds, you must never mould any Diamond in Sand
or Cuttle-bone, but you must use the second Lead to make a Patern of,
because the first will come somewhat less than the other.</P>
<P>Never cast it off but of the perfect Lead; for if you should cast it with
Tin, it being the lighter Metal, you may wrong you Judgment thereby,
but in Lead you will find the Experiment to be good; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Take the Mould of the Stone you would buy, which having moulded,
cast it off in perfect Lead, then make a Patern of it; but before you go
about to make a Patern (of the Stone you would cut) weigh the Lead,
<PB N="214" REF="126"/>
and set down the Weight in a Piece of Paper; then form the Piece of
Lead to what fashion you think best and most advantagious to the Stone;
then re-weigh the Lead so formed, and setting down the Weight, you
may find what the Stone will lose in cutting. The Lead will weigh three
times as much as the Stone, which is a sure Rule; and commonly it loseth
one third part in cutting.</P>
<P>To make Diamonds clean; if you see a thick Table Diamond in a
Ring, a Jewel, or in a Collect for a Jewel, you must first make it cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an
either with a little Pumice-stone, or with a few hot Ashes, or with a lit∣tle
Oyl, and boil it, which will make it very clean.</P>

4, and that 4, <HI>per</HI> 10, the Price of 1 <HI>Carr.</HI> which makes 40 <HI>l.:</HI> So for
3 <HI>Carr.</HI> 3 times 3 is 9 <HI>Carr.</HI> and 9 times 10 <HI>l.</HI> is 90 <HI>l.</HI> This for even <HI>Car∣racks</HI>
comes nearest the true Value; but for ½ or ¼ of a <HI>Carr.</HI> although a
Stone of 2 <HI>Carr.</HI> be worth 40 <HI>l.</HI> yet in this Rule and way of reckoning
(meaning ½ a <HI>Carr.</HI> so valued) it is valued at but ¼ of a <HI>Carr.</HI> which is
50 <HI>s.</HI> and ¼ of a <HI>Carr.</HI> but at ¼ of 50 <HI>s.</HI> although a single Stone, containing
a Crain, or ¼ <HI>Carr.</HI> is worth 30 <HI>s.</HI> As for Example: You would know
what a Stone of 6 Grains is worth; 6 Grains is 3 ½ <HI>Carr.</HI> 3 times 3 is 9,
and 9 times 50 <HI>s.</HI> is 22 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI> which is the Value of the Stone of 6 Grains.
So of 5 Grains, 5 times 5 is 25, and 25 times 12 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI> is 15 <HI>l. 12 s. 6 d.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To make a Foil for Diamonds.</HEAD>
<P>A Foil to be set under a thick Table Diamond, is to be made with
Black Ivory and Mastick, picked and made very clear, with a very little
Oyl of Mastick to incorporate them.</P>
<P>Black Ivory and Turpentine heated on the Fire is good, but the former
is better.</P>
<P>For a thin Table, Black Ivory scraped very fine is good; or take a lit∣tle

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Agent of <HI>Persia</HI> representing how highly conducing to
the Company's Interest one of my Profession would be
there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. I.</NOTE> I was easily won upon to embark on the <HI>Scipio Afri∣can,</HI>
which with the <HI>Persian Merchant</HI> were sent out this
Year for the Gulf, as well to support the declining Credit of the
<HI>English</HI> there, for not complying with their Articles of Agreement,
as to try if a Trade of <HI>English</HI> Cloth and Tin might be promoted
on this Side, as well as in <HI>India;</HI> but with a fruitless Attempt, as
in fit place may be made appear.</P>
<P>The 22<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>February,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scipio A∣frican</HI> sent to drive a Trade in <HI>Persia,</HI> not to guard the Gulf.</NOTE> 1676-77 from <HI>Swally-hole</HI> the Ship was dispatch∣ed
alone, and the <HI>Persian Merchant</HI> sent into the <HI>South-Seas;</HI> the
Council judging it needless to send two such Ships on such an Errand
as they could not repeat for the future, without incurring a Repri∣mand
from their Masters: And for the Traffick of that Place, the
<HI>Scipio African</HI> was enough, and more than enough, it only carrying
a Gawdy Outside, having Gilt Galleries two Stories, rounded with
Banisters after the <HI>French</HI> Mode, more for Shew than Use; which
was taking, till the bottom of the Business was enquired into, Whe∣ther
it came as by Capitulation, to be a Guard to the Gulf? Which
not answering that design, it could expect to be received with a
Welcome only suitable to such a Pageantry, and no other.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="128"/>
Whereupon it was laden like a Merchant-man more than a Man
of War;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter V.</NOTE> though at the same time we carried with us a <HI>Portugal Fi∣dalgo,
Emanuel Mendos,</HI> to appear for their Royalties, which are lit∣tle
inferior to ours, they supplying our Defects in a constant main∣taining
a Squadron, not so much to defend the <HI>Persian,</HI> as to annoy
the <HI>Arab,</HI> their sworn Enemy; yet by that means gain both the Ho∣nour
and Reputation due only to us, did we not neglect it.</P>
<P>With <HI>Emanuel Mendos</HI> was shipped a Young Friar of the Order of
St. <HI>Francis,</HI> who had undergone the Discipline of the <HI>Goa</HI> Physicians
with that Severity, that his Mouth was full of backward Blessings

<P>There are few Christian Ships on the Seas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Few Christian Ships without Friars.</NOTE> or <HI>Caphalaes</HI> on Shore,

<P>Having quitted <HI>Surat</HI> River's Mouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diu</HI> bravely defended a∣gainst the <HI>Turk∣ish</HI> Force.</NOTE> we kept the Coast of <HI>India</HI>

possess on this Coast, as Ancient and as Strong as any they
have. It was signally famous for the defeat given <HI>Sultan Badur</HI> the
Emperor of <HI>Cambaia,</HI> and all his Forces, when at the same time it
was besieged by a numerous Fleet of <HI>Turks</HI> from the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> as well
as <HI>Arabs</HI> from the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf; thus assaulted on all sides, it singly
bore the Fury of the Barbarous Nations, till relieved by a Fleet raised
when the Exchequer at <HI>Goa</HI> was impoverished, the Militia dispirited,
the Ecclesiasticks were forced to serve as Volunteers, and the Gen∣try
to take up Arms in Person, under the Command of <HI>Don John de
Castro,</HI> Viceroy; to whose Virtue even the Females were so devoted,
that they willingly parted with their most precious Jewels for no
other Pawn than an Hair of his Beard; which he held to be so sa∣cred
an Obligation, that he could not be satisfied till he had redeem∣ed
it at the Expence of all his Wealth; so that in that profitable Sta∣tion,
lying on his Bed of Sickness, he had not left himself where∣withal
to provide common Necessaries.</P>
<P>This City is placed under Twenty one Degrees and an half of <HI>North</HI>
Latitude.</P>
<P>And now launching into the Main Ocean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pirates infest all the <HI>Indian</HI> Seas.</NOTE> the Wind at <HI>North-East,</HI>
we braced our Sails close, in expectation of the <HI>Southern</HI> Gales,
which met us about the Nineteenth Degree of <HI>North</HI> Latitude, sooner
by Ten degrees than usual. Here in this large Field of Water the
<HI>Sindanian</HI> Pirates wreak their Malice on the unarmed Merchants, who
not long able to resist their unbounded Lust, become tame Slaves to
their lawless Rage, and fall from the highest Hopes, to the humblest
degree of Servitude: These are alike cruel, and equally salvage as
the <HI>Malabars,</HI> but not so bold as to adventure longer in these Seas than
the Winter's Blasts have dismissed them, retiring with their illgot
Booty to the Coasts of <HI>Sinda,</HI> where they begin to rove nearer their
Dens of Thievery, not daring to adventure Combat with the <HI>Malabars,</HI>
or stir from thence till the Season makes the <HI>Malabar</HI> retire. No part of

these Seas are without these Vermin, the Bay of <HI>Bengal</HI> being in∣fested
as much as the Coast of <HI>Coromandel</HI> by Outlaw'd <HI>Portugals,</HI>
and a mixture of that Race, the most accursedly base of all Man∣kind,
who are known for their Bastard-Brood lurking in the Islands at
the Mouths of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Buccaneers.</HI> Of the two
former we had often sight, neither of which sort were so fool-hardy
as to come nigh us, being content to gaze on wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they durst not
seize, and to wish us Impotence instead of Force.</P>
<P>When we had made Way Three hundred seventy four Miles to the
<HI>West</HI> from the Shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tropick</HI> Birds.</NOTE> at Sun-set we saw the <HI>Tropick</HI> Birds, which all
day long had shewn us the Recreation of the Sea, they being a kind
of Sea-hawk, and something bigger than a <HI>Lannar,</HI> mount upon the
Train to a lofty Pitch; and stooping to their Game (which is the
poor Flying Fish, when raised by those that hunt them in the Wa∣ter)
they perform it at one down-come: When they fly for Plea∣sure
they are more free than the best <HI>Falcon:</HI> They being now a
pretty way from Land, and not to be supposed to reach it e're dark,
'tis believed they make the Sea their Home, unless in moulting
time. Here is another sort follows the same Game, but not so cautious
where they alight, the other being fearful of the devouring Inhabi∣tants
of the Deep, but these fly close to the Water, and turn about
every Wave, so that they often escape our view, and seem to be
overwhelmed by the swelling Surges, by the Giddiness of their Flight
being oft given over for lost, when by a pleasing Surprize they ap∣pear,
contrary to all hopes: These have White Bodies and Grey
Wings, their Beaks are Red, and two Feathers stand at distance for
the Tails, by which they guide themselves to their Prey. In Calms
these Birds rest themselves upon the drowsy Tortoise, supinely float∣ing
in the Sea, so that we could take them by our Long-Boat
mann'd, and bring them captive tamely aboard Ship; which was
often done, the stupid Tortoise only lamenting with deep Sighs and
piteous Tears the Condition their Heedlessness had brought them
into: The Sluggards helpless and utmost Effort, to bewail what a
timely Care and active Endeavours might prevent.</P>
<P>The Princely Dolphin and the brisker Train,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Cuttle-fish.</NOTE> afforded more Sport
to take, while they pursued the Chase themselves through the Wa∣try
Plains, and more Invention to elude the Crafty <HI>Cuttle-fish</HI> its dark

That it emits a black and cloudy Liquor, to disturb the cunning An∣gler;
the Truth whereof I could never observe; only what was
more certainly miraculous, its monstrous Figure: The Body was of a
duskish Colour, all one Lump with the Head, without Scales; it
was endowed with large Eyes, and had long Shreds like <HI>Gorgon</HI>'s
Hair, hung in the manner of Snakes, bestuck with Snail-like Shells
reaching over the Body; under these appeared a Parrot's Beak; two
Slits between the Neck are made instead of Gills for Respiration;

<Q><L>Conscious of her shiftless Plight,</L>

<P>With the Pleasure of these, and innumerable other Objects of the
pliant Elements, we had sufficient Meditation to admire the diversity
of the World's Creation, which how differing soever in Shape, yet
agree to compleat a Symphony of Praise to the Great Author; and
though uttered by an Heathen, yet it was a Divine Saying, <HI>Jovis
plena sunt omnia;</HI> Productive Nature is all full of God.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 9<SUP>th</SUP> we were <HI>Westward</HI> off Cape <HI>Rouselgaot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape <HI>Rouselgaot</HI> a Promontory on <HI>Arabia Foe∣lix.</HI></NOTE> which lies in
Twenty two and an half <HI>North:</HI> It is that Promontory in <HI>Arabia
Foelix</HI> which gives Entrance to the Mouth of the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf, and
rises high, being most notoriously Sandy. This Country in General
was deservedly by the <HI>Hebrews</HI> called <HI>Arabia,</HI> signifying <HI>Barren;</HI> yet
how speciously this part may bear the name of <HI>Happy,</HI> I determine
not. And now we are in the opening of that Gulf, into which <HI>Eu∣phrates</HI>
and other Rivers of lesser Note discharge themselves.</P>
<P>At Night we saw <HI>Muschat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Imaum</HI> is <HI>Caliph.</HI></NOTE> whose vast and horrid Mountains no
Shade but Heaven does hide, though they cover the City with an
horrid one; reflecting thence the Heat scorching us at Sun-setting
and aboard Ship; within their fiery Bosom the Pilots find secure Har∣bour
for their weather-beaten Ships, the Water moderating the Air.
The Prince of this Country is called <HI>Imaum,</HI> who is Guardian of
<HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb, and on whom is devolved the Right of <HI>Caliphship,</HI>
according to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Belief: Wherefore the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes of
that Persuasion send every Year Rich Presents by those Vessels set
out to carry Devotees to <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb, which are wholly his,
and at his disposal, whereby he heaps up more Wealth than accrues to
him from the Income of his Barren Soil.</P>
<P>Sailing <HI>Westward,</HI> the City and the Castle lye open to our View;
it is much frequented by Merchants over the Deserts, and no less
by those from <HI>Mocha</HI> in the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and by the way of <HI>Grand Cairo;</HI>
it vends all Drugs and <HI>Arab</HI> Steeds, and pays Gold for <HI>Indian</HI> Com∣modities:
Here they keep safe those Ships they steal or purchase,
for Wood, no Timber growing here: They are a Fierce Treacherous
People, gaining as much by Fraud as Merchandize.</P>
<P>The Matchless Outrages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breach of Faith the Loss of <HI>Muschat.</HI></NOTE> after Faith plighted, committed in
that Place by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> was not only the Occasion of their be∣ing
quite beaten out thence, but of an eternal and irreconcilable
Quarrel between them: For where Religion, backed with the great∣est
Interest, strives for the Prize, I know not whether is most con∣cerned,
to gain a Conquest, or to perpetrate Barbarities, the com∣mon
Event of such a War, where to kill their Fellow-Creatures is
esteemed a service to the Creator. And thus it proved here; For
while that bold Nation persisted in its Discoveries, Navigation per∣fecting
<PB N="221" REF="129"/>
their Geography, they began to enquire into the course of
Profit, as well as their Ships way, and found that all their Inland
Trade tended to this <HI>Sinus</HI> and the Red Sea; wherefore they bent
themselves to be Masters of their Keys that unlocked the World's
Treasures, for which <HI>Muschat,</HI> is very commodious, of which be∣coming
Possessors, had not a too hot Zeal thrust them on, they might
to this day have enjoyed it with a just Commendation due to their
Industry; but sacrificing to Lust and Rapin what should have been
to the Glory of God and True Religion, which is Pure as well as
Peaceable, they soon were driven out thence to <HI>Ormus;</HI> where we
shall conclude what belongs to this Story.</P>
<P>In the mean time we had gained the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enter the Streights of the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf.</NOTE> the very
day the Sun had gained the <HI>Aequinox;</HI> when the <HI>North-West</HI> Winds
envied our entry into the Gulf, and drove us out for Sea-room on the
<HI>Persian</HI> Coast, nearer the Shoars of <HI>Sinda,</HI> so that we spent a Week in
tossing up and down, and striving against a mighty Stream, before
we reached <HI>Muschat</HI> again; but then the Winds were spent, we
calmly passed by some Islands in the Gulf, and a <HI>South</HI> Wind gently
blowing, we stemmed the furious Current, till we could see on
each side Land from <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Arabia;</HI> on the one side St. <HI>Jaques</HI>
his Head-land, on the other that of <HI>Mussendown</HI> appeared, and afore
Sun-set we entred the Streights Mouth, not above a League wide:
It lies in Thirty six Degrees <HI>North</HI> Latitude; a Mile within its Neck
on a row, are Four or Five Rocks, or Islets, by Mariners called the
<HI>Coines;</HI> from the resemblance of those Leavers of the same Name,
wherewith they raise, or lower the Breeches of their Guns.</P>
<P>About Midnight we were between <HI>Ormus</HI> and <HI>Larack,</HI> Forty four
Miles from the entry of the Streights, the biggest not above Four
Mile in Length; the lesser is <HI>Ormus;</HI> great indeed for Name in time
of yore, now only famous for its Clifts of Salt (which though
pierced by extream Heat, yet are a cure for the most burning Fever,
the only known Remedy for such cases in this Climate) and the
Castle built by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> the chief strength of all these Seas.</P>
<P>Passing both these Islands, we made <HI>Kismash,</HI> and leaving it
a-stern, we turned off short to the Port of <HI>Gombroon,</HI> or <HI>Bunder
Abassee;</HI> in which Road we found Two lusty <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships. Two great
ones of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and One small one from <HI>Bombaim;</HI> it is good
Riding for Ships in this Harbour, though an open Road, by reason
of the firm Anchor-hold; it is otherwise subject to hot Blasts from
the adjacent Hills, which move the rowling Sands between, in such
sort, that in the station near the shoar when these are raised to
Clouds, the Ships cannot be seen.</P>

handsome <HI>Piscash,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> Free of all Imposts.</NOTE> to the several <HI>Cauns</HI> in his Journy, of <HI>Europe</HI> Ra∣rities,
placed to the Company's Account; and in requital have
Provisions of Fruits and all other Necessaries, sent in <HI>Gratis</HI> to the
Agent, though the Company pay dearly for the Civility, while the
Agent is only Benefitted thereby; they carrying not only Goods, but
great returns of Money unmolested; for which reason the Natives
cast themselves upon his Management, rather than suffer the Ex∣actions
of the <HI>Rhadarage,</HI> for which reason the Agent has no ordi∣nary
Recompense, it being the chief Emolument of his Place: The
Natives still paying their Respect to his Character, which is, one of
the Emperor's Friends, not daring to Offend him whom the King
delighteth to Honour.</P>
<P>And therefore it is that at Port no small care is taken to carry
fair with the Governor of the Province, (who is a <HI>Caun,</HI> or Duke)
and the <HI>Shawbunder;</HI> and on this score we were no sooner on shoar,
but we must Compliment both these, where we were received in their
open places of Audience, and entertained with Coho, Tea, or Rose-Water,
Boiled with Cardamoms, and sweetned with Sugar-Candy,
Plates of <HI>Persian</HI> Fruit dried, and Sweetmeats; while the Room is
Perfumed with <HI>Rackbeet,</HI> a Compound Sweet Water, Wood of Aloes
smoaking, or Glasses of Rose-Water poured on our Garments to exces∣sive
slabbering; and if leave be desired to Smoak Tobacco, they will
offer Wine of the Country, and at last dismiss us with <HI>Pawn;</HI> which
Visit they fail not to return, nor must it be forgotten to bestow on
them Presents of considerable Value. The Rooms are spread with
Carpets as in <HI>India,</HI> and they have <HI>Pigdans,</HI> or Spitting Pots of the
Earth of this Place, which is valued next to that of <HI>China,</HI> to void
their Spittle in.</P>
<P>The Water is preserved in Jarrs, and drank out of <HI>Puckeries,</HI> that
keep it Cooler than any where else.</P>
<P>This Port receives most Ships going or coming from <HI>Busserah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Absolute in the Spice Trade.</NOTE> as
they find the Markets answer their designs: But the greatest Traf∣fick,
next <HI>Indian</HI> Cloth, comes from the Spice Trade; which the

carry off Fifty thousand <HI>Thomands</HI> worth of Velvets, Silk, Raw and
Wrought, with Rich Carpets, besides many Tunn of Gold and Sil∣ver,
Yearly; so Great and Absolute is their Trade from the <HI>Moluc∣coes,</HI>
and <HI>South</HI> Sea, hither, that they are reported to have brought
Six Ships laden with Spice, which the cunning Merchants thought
to make advantage of; but the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> being Crafts-Masters,
sent for the Cargo on shoar of Two Ships, and piled it up before the
Factory Gate, where they not coming to their Price immediately,
set Fire thereto, and consumed it all; which the Buyers neglecting,
or laughing at, they caused other Two to be served in the same
manner, knowing so great a quantity had caused a Glut, when they
asked the same Rate for the remaining Two; as the old <HI>Sybils</HI> did
<HI>Tarquin</HI> for their Oracular Writings left unburnt; whereby the <HI>Persians</HI>

they being obliged to Bid Higher for fewer Commodities; the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>

being well assured none could furnish them with others than
was brought by them.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Company's Trade is but small here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> Trade more in Shew than Reality.</NOTE> only carrying
off some few Drugs, <HI>Carmania</HI> Wool, Goats, Dates, and Horses;
though they make it worth their while to keep their Agent in good
Port, as well from the Allowance from the <HI>Shawbunder,</HI> as by Con∣sulage
of 2 <HI>l.</HI> and ½ <HI>per Cent.</HI> for all Foreign Goods that seek their Pro∣tection;
on which score they seem to drive a Trade, and send up every
Shipping Three or Four hundred Camels laden with <HI>Indian</HI> Wares;
as many as the <HI>Dutch</HI> bring down to Ship off on their own Stock and
Ships: But this Year a great Bluster was made with <HI>English</HI> Cloth
and Tin brought by our Arrival; which, however, the understand∣ing
Traffickers smile at, knowing it comes better Cheap by the
<HI>Caphala</HI>'s in Exchange of other Goods from <HI>Stambole,</HI> i. e. <HI>Constanti∣nople,
Smirna, Scanderoon,</HI> and <HI>Aleppo;</HI> and that <HI>Suffahaun</HI> is already

<P>The <HI>French</HI> have as little to do at this Port as in other Places;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> have nothing to do.</NOTE> and
were it not for the Credit of their Interpreter, who gets good Profit
by Wine, (he being priviledg'd with a Wine-press for that Nation at
<HI>Siras,</HI> as well as the other <HI>Europe</HI> Nations), they could not subsist:
But <HI>Monsieur</HI> makes an outside, lives retiredly, and without more
Business than to visit and be visited (which Courtesy passes inter∣changeably
among the Christians as well as Natives) lounges his
time away.</P>
<P>The convenient Situation of our Factory Butting farthest out on
the open Strand, yields a Prospect over the Sea to the <HI>Arabian</HI> Coast,
and on a clear day <HI>Ormus</HI> Castle might be discovered by the naked
Eye, it being not above a League from our House, as all the Islands
interspersed in this Gulph; though the most diverting was of our
<HI>Europe</HI> Sailors mounting their <HI>Starts</HI> or Asses, the briskest, neatest,
and nimblest of that kind I ever saw; so that they seemed both by
their Mettle and easiness of their going, to lose the Epithet of <HI>dull</HI>
affixed to their Nature: For their Masters waiting here their Fare,
no sooner had left them to the Guidance of the Seamen, who
would prove their Skill in Riding, where many times they would
cast them on the Sand, both to the Sport of the Standers-by, and
Mirth of their Companions; letting them know a Yard was more
squared for their Cavalcade, than these Headstrong Creatures:
Though for this Diversion afforded from the Seamen on their ac∣customed
Element, they are quit, when these Asses forsake their surer
Footing on Land, to stagger on board Ship; which was often at∣tempted
for the Gilded Outside of the beautiful <HI>Scipio,</HI> where the
Captain entertained the Governor and all his Train, and as many
as would venture out of Curiosity the Laughter of the Roguy Mari∣ners:
Till on the 15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scipio</HI> dispatch'd for <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> 1677. it returned to the <HI>Indian</HI>
Coast; but not before the Sailers had stigmatized this Place for its
Excessive Heat, with this sarcastical Saying, <HI>That there was but an
Inch-Deal betwixt</HI> Gomberoon <HI>and Hell.</HI></P>
<P>And to speak truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The excessive He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts.</NOTE> when the raging Dog-star reigns with us, it
is not half so hot as it is now here; wherefore all People of any
Quality are preparing to leave this Place; and the <HI>Caun</HI> had been
<PB N="225" REF="131"/>
gone e're now, had not the King sent him a <HI>Collat</HI> or Robe of Ho∣nour,
he having by his Male-Administration of his Office not long
ago provoked his Master; for which, large Sums of Money have
hardly made Attonement, even to his utter Impoverishment, had he
been displaced as he expected. But a <HI>Goloomy Shaw,</HI> or Messenger,
arriving with the joyful News of his Restoration, he invited all the
City to be a Witness of this Grace.</P>
<P>The <HI>Goloomy Shaw</HI> staid at the Garden without the City some days
at the Expence of the <HI>Caun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of receiving a Message from the Emperor.</NOTE> till things could be provided for his Re∣ception,
which was thus; Early in the Morning the loud Trumpets
and Drums gave notice that the <HI>Caun</HI> and all his Troops were ready
to take Horse, and waited the Attendance of all Ranks to the chief
<HI>Mosque,</HI> thence to the Garden; where coming and seeing the Mes∣senger
with the King's Letter advanced on the Top of his Turbat,
with his Back towards the <HI>Caun,</HI> he alights, and after Three Obey∣sances
and Thrice kissing the Ground, he approaches and takes it in
his Hand, sealed up in a <HI>Sarbaff</HI> Bag, or Cloth of Gold, and first
kissing it, gives it to the <HI>Mullah,</HI> or Chief Priest, when he retires to
Prayers, and vests himself with the Robe of Honour; in which time
all seat themselves in a decent Posture, and at his appearance rise till
the <HI>Mullah</HI> have read the Emperor's Pleasure, when every one pays
him their Congratulations, and after a Dish of <HI>Coho</HI> or Tea, mount∣ing,
accompany him to his Palace; the Ships in the Road on this
Occasion discharging their great Guns, and the several Forts and
Blockhouses saluting him as he passes: Where alighting, a Noble
Banquet, and truly <HI>Persian,</HI> was ushered in, to which the sly <HI>Banyans</HI>
were invited with the rest; who durst not but be present, though on∣ly
to make their Honours, and return; for they will not eat with any
but their own Tribe, lest they should be defiled: Yet here they live
not so exactly up to their <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Rule, as they of <HI>Guzerat</HI> do,
though the very next Neighbours to them, coming from the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Sinda;</HI> for these indulge themselves in Goats-Flesh, Sheep,
Pullen, and almost every thing but Cows-Flesh, for which they wil∣lingly
pay 350 <HI>Thomands</HI> Yearly, to spare them alive; and for this
reason is it the Shambles have none; but of every thing else, both
Flesh and Fish, here is as great Plenty as the World has besides.</P>
<P>The Oysters of this Gulph are the best,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plenty of Food.</NOTE> next the <HI>British;</HI> which
I purpose to treat of in their turn. Amidst this Fulness of every
thing, it is wonderful to consider where they fetch them, or how they
are bred; for these Sandy Meadows produce little more than Shrubs
(neither Grass nor Corn being to be seen near this Town); yet on
these, both Goats, Sheep, Oxen, and Camels, Mules, and Asses,
brouze and grow fat; were not the Food of the Commons Dates
(which this Soil is properest for) and Fish, and so the Merchant is
furnished for his Money good cheap.</P>
<P>The Water serving this Town generally,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Wate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> is of two sorts; the first
and most brackish strained through the Sands into Pits from the Sea,
with which they boil Meat, and give it their working Cattle to
drin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; the other is immediately from the Heavens, reserved in Ci∣sterns
built by the Charity of well-disposed Persons; out of which,
the Poor, the Covetous, and Slaves, the Flocks and Herds too, are
<PB N="226" REF="132"/>
often supplied, when a plentiful Rain has made them overflow.
For here are neither Fresh-Water Rivers nor Springs to be found
nigher than four <HI>Pharsangs</HI> (whither the Rich load an Ass, Mule,
or Camel, and send a Servant to fetch every day's Store); so that
did they not lay up such Provisions Yearly, they would subsist very
poorly. These Cisterns or Storehouses for Rain are digged out of the
Ground deep into the Earth, beyond the Surface of the Sand, and
are curiously covered above with Stone, and plastered within with
excellent durable Plaster; some Spherical, others Transverse, cutting
one another in manner of a Cross; others, and the largest, Oblong,
Square, Orbicular, or Oval; which being once finished, like their
<HI>Caravan Seraws</HI> have no Endowment to maintain them, either to
keep them clean, or from falling to Decay; so regardless are they of
Futurity, that no one is suffered to repair them: On which account it is,
that about their great Cities so many of all sorts are found, newly
built, superannuated, defiled, (which they esteem so, if either Man
or Beast have dropped in and been drowned), unfrequented, and
full of Nastiness; so pervicaciously Vainglorious, that they will
have the Repute of an entire Founder, or none.</P>
<P>To replenish which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It rains but twice a Year, and then not long.</NOTE> two Seasons shower down their Benedictions;
the one about this time in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June,</HI> and the other at or near
<HI>Christmas;</HI> and then not of a long continuance, by reason the intense
Heat of the Sun permits not the Vapours to condense themselves in∣to
Clouds, but expands them into Air: For this cause is it that the
Rains do not always fall, or if they do, more sparingly in this Month
than in <HI>December;</HI> which gives more opportunity by its Retrograde
Course, and longest distance from this Circle, than when that great
Luminary approaches nearest.</P>
<P>The Periodical and stated Winds of the Gulph are the <HI>Northwest,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Winds.</NOTE>
by the Inhabitants termed <HI>Shemauls,</HI> which begin when the <HI>Cowshees</HI>
or <HI>South-East</HI> leave off, which is not before the Heats are entred,
when the <HI>Shemauls</HI> blow from the Sea to asswage them; this Climate,
otherwise uninhabitable, would become more miserable than the <HI>Ve∣suviau</HI>
Plains, or Tops of <HI>Aetna,</HI> since it is not above Three Degrees
and an half beyond the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI> towards the <HI>Artick</HI> Pole,
and floored with vast Sands pent in by the surrounding Sprouts of
<HI>Taurus</HI> and <HI>Imaus</HI> continued hither: By either of these Winds when
they blow impetuously, the Sands are whirled about, to the obscu∣ring
of the Day, and burying all alive in darkness, as <HI>Prosper Alpi∣nus</HI>
relates to happen sometimes in <HI>Egypt;</HI> which, as he observes, oc∣casions
sore Eyes and Blindness in all Sandy Regions, from the in∣flammable
Particles kindled by the Sun-beams striking on the Sands,
which here is verified in an high degree on the Natives; nor are they
less afflicting to Strangers newly arrived, chasing and fretting their
very Skin to Rawness, and then vexing them by their fresh assailing
with Botches and Blanes. To these Winds we may add the Diary,
or <HI>Terrheneos</HI> from the Mountains, which breathe a gentler Air all
the Morning, hardly curdling the Ocean; in the Afternoon stronger
from the Sea, refresh the Fiery Plain.</P>
<P>The most unhealthy of these are the <HI>South-East,</HI> for that then the
Air is thicker, by reason of the Seas Vicinity, and the Sun's depar∣ture
<PB N="227" REF="132"/>
towards its <HI>Southern</HI> Progress; for upon its return the Skies do
clear, and the Clouds, which used to hang about the Mountain-tops
till Mid-day, vanish earlier at the Sun's approach; whereupon this
Climate is not subject to the greater part of Distempers a more Wa∣try
Country may abound with; though it be to some; to wit, to
Rheumatisms, Numbness, and Periodical Fevers, such as are Ter∣tians
and Quartans, but chiefly to Quotidians; rarely incident to
Dropsies; oftner obnoxious to Jaundice, Obstructions of the Spleen,
Mesentery, and Windiness of the Hypochondrias: They dread not
a Lask, but are concerned when they cannot go to Stool.</P>
<P>The Fury of these were not over at our Arrival;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inland stifling hot.</NOTE> to avoid which
I was forced in the beginning of <HI>May</HI> to betake my self to <HI>Asseen,</HI> a
Country Village Three Miles from <HI>Gombroon,</HI> than which it is not
much better, only remoter from the Sea, wherefore it labours under
the Incommodity of a stifling Air, it being so near the Hills that the
free Blasts are thereby intercepted; only it enjoys a greater benefit
of limpid Water, for which it is highly valuable; and by the In∣dustry
of the Hinds some things do sprout here, and the Date-Trees
are nourished by the unwearied drawing of Water, which flourish
the better for their Pains.</P>
<P>The constant Din of a great many at this Work together, like the
creeking of so many Cart-Wheels ungreas'd, afford the Sick little
Rest; and without this obstreperous Noise no Water could be had;
for they use only the <HI>Indian</HI> Wheel, drawn up and let down by Oxen,
with as little Intermission Day or Night, as <HI>Sysiphon</HI>'s repeated Trou∣ble
is reported.</P>
<P>In the day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Locusts come in Armies.</NOTE> besides the Heat and Sands, the Winds brought with
them another Plague, the Locusts, to benight the day, and fly in
Armies to devour the Greens wheree're they find them, gnawing
the Palms and other Trees, both Leaf and Fruit, spreading where
they alight as thick as Bees drove out to swarm a new Colony; no
other Charm than Fire can expel this Pest, when kindled with Wisps
and withered Boughs they run up and down from Tree to Tree, ma∣king
an hideous Clamour, yet scarcely make them leave, where they
once beset: Thus <HI>Salamander</HI>-like these People live in Fire, making a
Remedy of their Disease; for here all things seem as if they had un∣dergone
a General Conflagration, or that <HI>Phoebus</HI> with his Solar
Rays had like another <HI>Phaeton</HI> scorched this part of the World; or
rather this unhappy Soil retains the Curse of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Earth accur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t for the sake of <HI>Adam.</HI></NOTE> for being
once so nigh that Terrestrial Paradise; concerning which I am not
ignorant that it is left undetermined among Divines, and for that
cause there is always administred matter of dispute to the Interpreters
of <HI>Genesis. Elias</HI> the <HI>Thesbite</HI> is positive that the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> is
still in being, not doubting many still go thither, and that the Pas∣sage
to it lies easy and open, but that overcome with the Delights
thereof they never care to return. <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>Philo,</HI> tenacious of
their Allegories, have fancied a Mystical Paradise, the true Ideas of
<HI>Plato;</HI> and are imitated therein by <HI>Psellius,</HI> who says, that <HI>Chaldean</HI>
Pardyse (so he calls it) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is
nothing else but a Choir of the Heavenly Virtues which illustrate the
Aetherial Father, and the Rays of Holiness flowing from the first
<PB N="228" REF="133"/>
Creator. Some situate this contended-for Place in <HI>Mesopotamia;</HI>
others in <HI>India,</HI> between both which we now are; but there remains
the difficulty of reconciling the Four Rivers, which admits of no
other subterfuge than to have recourse to the General Inundation.</P>
<P>But I leave this, and proceed to acquaint you, that nothing is left
here but a sensible Map of Purgatory, if that may please some to be
a Road to Paradise; to see how the Fiery Element makes the Moun∣tains
gape, the Rocks cleft in sunder, the Waters stagnate, to
which the Birds with hanging Wing repair to quench their Thirst;
for want of which the Herds do low, the Camels cry, the Sheep do
bleat, the barren Earth opens wide for Drink, and all things appear
calamitous for want of kindly Moisture; in lieu of which, hot
Blasts and Showers of Sand infest the purer Air, and drive not only
us, but Birds and Beasts to seek remoter dwellings, or else to perish
here; for which purpose 'tis familiar to behold the Crows and Spar∣rows
take their flight to Upland Countries, as also Dogs and other
Vermin to remove, to avoid the Tyranny of this Season.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caun</HI> and <HI>Shawbunder</HI> were gone before us; at length by their
Example we left the Port, tho it was not before the latter end of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor of this Province is stiled the <HI>Caun</HI> of <HI>Bunder Abassae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Caun</HI> of <HI>Bunder</HI></NOTE>
either for the store of <HI>Abasses</HI> shipped off here, or that it more im∣mediately
respects the <HI>Abasseen</HI> Countrey than any other: The
adjacent Islands, with the Soldiery, are annexed to his Jurisdiction;
though <HI>Northwest</HI> beyond <HI>Gombroon</HI> his Rule extends not far, nor
much Inland, yet along the Gulph to its very Mouth he possesses a
large Tract of Ground for many Leagues together: His Metropolis
is <HI>Gombroon,</HI> where he resides till the soultry Summer makes him fly
beyond the Hills, to breathe in cooler Air. Which we betook our
selves to, after I had returned from <HI>Asseen,</HI> whither I went for the sake
of the Water, as welcome to our parched Throats, as a drop of that
cool Liquor to the importunate <HI>Dives,</HI> who was involved in the
Center of those Flames which we on the Brink of the Abyss only
had a Taste of.</P>
<P>Nor was a Present at this time from the <HI>Caun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sent us a Pre∣sent of Apples candied in Snow in the middle of the Heats.</NOTE> of Apples candied
is Snow, less grateful, though more feasible, the Messenger being
impowered, for all the scorching Gulph interposed, at Night to bear
them to us; and by Break of Day we drank a Glass of Wine quench∣ed
with a Lump of Snow and Ice, to the <HI>Caun</HI>'s Health. Nor had
we less hope to pass this dreadful Lake of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> since he had sent
us a Token of his discovery of a more Temperate Climate, by a
Fruit not unknown to us (<HI>Genetins</HI>), being Natives of a calmer
Region; with these we cheated our Thirst for a while: In the mean
time it fared not much better with us, than with those groaning un∣der
a burning Fever, who by large Draughts endeavour to quench
their Appetite, till it enrage the Distemper to an higher Fit: for now
we saw (what before we believed) the tardy Fowls pay for their lin∣gring
here, and leave their dead Bodies to be mummied in the Sands:
Nor does this proceed from Heat alone, but the Seas nearness, which
now furrs the Shore with discoloured Foam, poysons the Air as well
as its own Inhabitants by its Corruption, staining the Strand with
Mossy Green, and evaporating thence a Noysome Scent, by the pu∣trifying
<PB N="229" REF="133"/>
of Fish left dead at the Ebbing Tides. Whence the Air
breeds Insects, their Water-stores grow unwholesome, and a languid
Habit seizes Human Bodies, disposing them, though not to Scurvies,
yet something analogous thereto; for few escape without depascent
Ulcers feeding on their Limbs, which creep out into long Worms
our Idioms hardly find a fit Name for, unless we may reckon them
a-kin to Wolfs, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Phagadaenae,</HI> or <HI>Cacoethicks.</HI></P>
<P>Upon their first appearance they carry with them the presence of
Imposthumations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worms breed in their Bo∣dies: How they must be treated.</NOTE> but presently after suppuration a long white Fila∣ment
like a small Gut comes forth, which gently caught by the Head
is wound on a tender Twig, which while it increases is turned round,
and fed with Rose Water, by a Clout dipped therein to keep it moist,
lest becoming dry it should dye; this by Congestion of Humours
causes great Pain, and as long as it continues, the Part affected swells
into an huge Tumor; and if by chance the Worm be broken or ill
handled, that it come not entirely forth, it breaks out in other pla∣ces
with more severe Symptoms; wherefore great Care is taken to
bring it out whole, lest it should reduce the Patient to a worse Condi∣tion:
It is rebellious to all common Medicines, and must be nou∣rished
with Milk and Butter, or else a Poultice of the Patient's own
Ordure.</P>
<P>At this time also the Pullen fare but ill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poultry dye suddenly.</NOTE> a Pest among them kil∣ling
them without the help of Cookery; nor do the <HI>Persians</HI> care
much for eating of them; whether suspicious of the III Practice of
their own Nation, who fancy Diseases gotten of Prostitutes are
drawn out by buggering of them, or out of any other Superstition,
as that Worms and Scorpions are bred in their Guts, I know not;
yet this is certain, they are often found to dye suddenly.</P>
<P>Here, if the Subtilty of the Enquiry could discover any thing to
find the Reason of this Slaughter, 'twould be worth the while; but
a simple Putrefaction must not bear the blame, for then all living
Creatures would fall under the like Fatality, as well Sheep and other
Cattle, as these; 'tis necessary therefore some more secret and pe∣culiar
Cause should be rendred; which seems to be fairly hinted at
by <HI>Virgil:</HI>
<Q><L>Hic quondam morbo Coeli, miseranda coorta est</L>
<L>Tempestas, totoque Autumno incanduit aestas:</L>
<L>Et genus omne neci pecudum dedit omne ferarum,</L>
<L>Corrupitque Lacus, infecit pabula tabo.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Here once the Air infected, did beget</L>
<L>A Plague which rag'd through the Autumnal Heat;</L>
<L>A kind of Cattel and of Wild Beasts di'd,</L>
<L>The Grass was tainted, Rivers putrifi'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>Which whether it be done by the Influence of the Stars, or disposi∣tion
of Particles, I dispute not. Certain it is, the Sun by its Eclip∣tick
Motion determines generally the various Seasons of the Year,
as Summer, Winter, Autumn, and the Spring; yet all Summers are
not equally hot and dry, nor do all Winters share of the like Cold and
<PB N="230" REF="134"/>
Moisture; whereupon some Summers bring Swarms of Flies and
Gnats, others are clear from them; and on this account is it so many
Armies of Locusts have invaded these Quarters (which though
often, is not perpetual), that they have devoured all things as they
bud, unless where the Husbandmen have drove them away by Fire;
so that I am willing to incline to the unaccustomed Alterations of this
Year, which by the more constant blowing of the <HI>South</HI> Winds has
filled the Air with a longer time of Moisture, and thereby impressed
something more Mortal by some unwonted Conjunction of Planets,
than other Years: For these <HI>South-East</HI> Winds as they are the most
unhealthy, so used they to be the least durable; but hitherto they
have hovered with Clouds without Rain, and kept off the <HI>Northern</HI>
hot ones, which restore Health to the too hasty perspiring Spirits
by the dewy <HI>Southern</HI> Gales.</P>

Travel till Morning; We go but slowly by reason of our Beasts of
Burthen, though a greater part of them were dispatched a Month
before us by another Road, less Mountainous, though farther
about.</P>

Coming to our Inns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. II.</NOTE> we have no Host, or Young Damosels to
bid us Welcome, nor other Furniture than Bare Walls; no Rooms
Swept, nor Cleanly Entertainment, Tables neatly Spred, or Maid∣ens
to Attend with Voice or Lute to Exhilarate the Weary Passen∣ger;
but instead of these, Apartments covered with Dung and
Filth; Musick indeed there is of Humming Gnats pricking us to
keep an unwilling Measure to their Consort: So that here is neither
Provision for Man or Beast, only an open House, with no enliven∣ing
Glass of Pontack, or Poinant Cheer to encourage the Badness of
the March; but every Four or Five <HI>Pharsangs, i. e. Parasangae,</HI> a
<HI>German</HI> League, on the King's High way, a <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI> as dirty
as <HI>Augeus</HI> his Stable, those before always leaving the next comer work
enough to cleanse where they have been; that after coming in Tired,
they are more intent to spread their Carpets for Repose, than re∣move
the incrustated Cake of Sluttery, the constant Nursery of
Flies and Bees, they often bringing their Horses into the same Bed-Chamber.</P>
<P>These Houses Built by Charitable Persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Travelling, and how Pro∣vided.</NOTE> are always supplied
with Tanks and Cisterns, which now run over since yesterdays
Rain, and are commonly very Fine and Costly; but other Com∣modities
we must bring with us, otherwise we are likely not only to
go to Bed on the bare Ground, but depart more Hungry than we came
thither (very few Places maintaining Sutlers for Horse-meat, or
Diet for the Wayfaring Man): Therefore when we undertake this
Journy, we carry not only all our Family, but Housholdstuff too;
for which every one has a separate Allowance for his Servant and his
Baggage, and a Butler in common, who Mounts the <HI>Trojan</HI> Horse,
suplied with Bread, Wine, Salt, Cold Meat, Knives and Napkins
for the <HI>Viaticum,</HI> in Two Canisters, or Chests hung on each side one,
under whose Belly is girt a <HI>Metarrah,</HI> or Goat Skin full of Wine, and
another of Water; a <HI>Metarrah</HI> full of the latter every one ties to his
Horses Saddle, in the fashion of a Leathern Bottel, and a Silver
Toss, or Cup, in a Case at the Bow of the Saddle: In the middle of
the <HI>Munsel (i. e.</HI> a whole Day's Journy) the Butler alights, and by
some advantageous Brook, or Tank, spreads a Table on the Ground,
while the whole <HI>Caphala</HI> refresh: (We generally make our <HI>Munsel</HI>
from Four in the Afternoon till before Four in the Morning) when
after a Glass of Wine, and the Fragments of yesterdays Provisions,
we betake our selves to Rest with much eagerness, if it be possible
among so many strange Customs at first; as Noise of Carriers Bells,
Feeding, Neighing, Breying, and Noise of so many Creatures,
Loading and Unloading, with the Singing, Chatting, and Din of
Servants, Horse-keepers and Muliteers; but Custom makes all
things familiar and easy, that we generally Repose till Two the next
Day; when our Cook has provided not only our Dinner (which is
as Sumptuous as if at Home, and brought in with the same Order)
but furthermore, our necessary Provant for the ensuing Day's Jour∣ny;
and after this manner are we fitted to measure out our future
Hardships.</P>
<P>Hither the <HI>Banyans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Shotters,</HI> or Footmen.</NOTE> or <HI>English</HI> Brokers, Accompanied us, they
taking their Leave for the Port, we keeping on our Course, Three
<PB N="232" REF="136"/>
<HI>Englishmen</HI> with our Retinue answerable to the Quality of each; we
had with us Twenty Camels for Lumber, Fifteen Horses, Three
Mules, and Two Asses, besides Three <HI>Shotters</HI> for our Guides, which
are the only Men here also, who wear Plumes of Feathers in their Tur∣bats,
small Bells about their Wastes, Truncheons in their Hands,
Horse-Cloaths over their Shoulders richly Embroidered on Scarlet,
Packthread Shoes on their Feet, and close Jerkins with Breeches be∣low
their Knees; these are our Guides, and hold our Horses while
we Mount, look after them and the Equipments, as Bridles and Fur∣niture,
(the most mean of which are Silver) when we alight; and
are not only swift, but lasting Footmen.</P>
<P>Beginning to set forward, neither Tract nor Road was followed,
all being covered with Sand; but our Guides steered by their own
Experience; this was not so comfortable, to behold nothing but a
Sea of Sand; for now we began to turn our back upon the Gulf, and
steer a more <HI>Northern</HI> Course, from whence to reflect what Sustenance
this barren Earth could produce, that, should our Stores fail, we
might want; yet even for this Jealousy we had not the least shadow of
Reason, for had we been less provided we might have met with
Plenty, every one striving to Vend us Necessaries, to the no small
encrease of my amazement how they came by them.</P>
<P>After we had waded through Two <HI>Pharsangs</HI> of this Desolate
Way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Palm-Tree.</NOTE> we began to Clamber up those Hills, which seem hanging over
the Road of <HI>Gombroon,</HI> now beating the Hoof on more solid Rocks:
In this Passage we could here and there descry some Groves of Palms,
whose Fruit were tinctured with a Cherry Red, the constant fore∣runner
of their full Maturity; at which time they look for the same
Unhealthiness we do in our Autumn; though I find them not so su∣perstitiously
addicted to Symbols, as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> to their Hiero∣glyphicks,
yet they express the Year by this Tree; because this
Tree, say they, of all others alone (which I before noted of the
Coco-Nut Tree, and therefore I think it a kind of Palm) at every
appearance of the New Moon procreates a fresh Branch, by which
Twelve Productions the whole Year is resembled and compleated;
the Trees are Tall and Slender, bearing their Boughs all a top, like a
shady Tuft, some standing bolt upright, and others spread abroad,
with others flagging and ready to give way to the Birth of more;
when they are Young and in their Infancy, they no sooner sprout
up but the prickly Leafs guard its tender Head, which is of a pithy
substance, and when Wounded spoils the Trees Growth, so that it
Dies; but while it escapes that danger, it rises by degrees after the
former Order, the under Branches bowing Archwise to their upstart
Youngsters; the Leafs are set in Rows<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>like Ribs to a great Spine,
arising from a Circular Base, till it end in a sharp Point; under these
Boughs the mighty Branches hang full of Dates in Clusters, and
which is more than <HI>say so,</HI>
<Q><L>The more they'r Burthened better do they Thrive,</L>
<L>Like depress'd Virtue better kept alive.</L></Q>
So patient under great Loads of this Fruit, that they seem to rejoyce
<PB N="233" REF="136"/>
with a more chearful Verdure, and unconcerned reject the withered
Boughs, whilst a more lively Product makes them glad by a new
Succession; by which means it keeps Green the whole Course of
the Year.</P>
<P>Nor when the old ones all, are these only fit for the Fire;
for they being orderly laid, and finely Gilded or Painted between
the Beams of the same Wood, supply the Ceilings and other Adorn∣ments
of their best Houses; nor are they less serviceable to Thatch
their meaner Cottages: The Trunk being deprived of those Comb∣ings,
from the main Head is beheld a flourishing Peruke of Palms, fit
to be worn by the greatest Heroes; from whence downwards without
any Sprouts, it appears all in Coat of Mail Cap-a-pee, or like a Pine-Ap∣ple
from its scaly Structure, caused by the falling of the precedent
Branches, by which compactness it emulates its Conelike Figure.</P>
<P>Of these Trees there are Male and Female, and which is worthy our
Notice, the Female Palms (which only Bear) will not Bring forth
before they are Impregnated at the Roots with the Seed of the Male,
first pounded into Meal and sprinkled about them; which how true
I dispute not; but certainly Tradition has confirmed the Practice,
and they are not to be persuaded to neglect the Custom.</P>
<P>In the midst of this Days <HI>Munsel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hell Gate.</NOTE> among the Mountains we passed
by the Mouth of an horrid Cave; where they entertain Travellers
with Tragick Stories, and a Legend of Fables, as that it is the Road
to Hell; for, say they, whoever Enters never Returns; as if thence
had arose the Proverb, <HI>No Redemption from the Shades;</HI> or that of
the Poet,
<Q><L>—Facilis descensus Averni;</L>
<L>Sed revocare gradus, hic labor, hoc opus est.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Easy the Descent's to Hell, but back again</L>
<L>Our steps to call, this is the Work, the Pain.</L></Q>
But it stuck not on my Fancy, who had been informed of Plea∣santer
Stages on that Journy, and an higher way to more open
Doors.</P>
<Q>—Patet Atri janua Ditis.</Q>
<Q>Hell Gate wide open stands.</Q>
<P>But it may more probably be an Invention to fright Passengers into
the right Way, and that they should avoid, by so sad and terrible a
Remark, the wrong, which would wilder them in an unlucky Maze;
for here the Way was not only Intricate but Difficult; whereby I
was encouraged to auspicate a more Coelestial Path might lead us to
<HI>Getche,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Getche</HI> a Vil∣lage on Wheels.</NOTE> in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language signifying a <HI>Goat</HI> Village; which
was on Wheels, as the other, being not Twenty Miles distant; it is
in a Sandy Valley full of Shrubs, on which the Camels Feed, but
the Asses, Mules, and Horses, on Barly and chopt Straw; [the <HI>Per∣sians</HI>
learn'd the <HI>Indians</HI> how to Treat their Horses; where having
<PB N="234" REF="137"/>
declared the manner, I forbear here, it being exactly the same] for
these Eight or Nine <HI>Munsels</HI> they care not to House them, but only
Cover them with <HI>Yawpengees,</HI> or Horse-Cloths, and expose them to the
open Air; which is not so Unhealthy for them, as for Human Bodies,
who carefully prevent such Lodgings for fear of Aches, and other
Inconveniences incident thereupon; wherefore in the middle of the
Vale we repaired to the <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI> almost buried in the Sand,
it being the only obstacle to their rowling Billows.</P>
<P>The next Morn we were waited on by the Country Women
bringing us Cheese, and Butter made before our eyes, with no
other Churn than a Goatskin, in which they shook the Milk till
Butter came; Fish, Roots, and Herbs, with all sorts of Pullen: In
these Two <HI>Munsels</HI> we only meet with these Servitors, in other Pla∣ces
Men appear alone, not allowing their Women that Freedom;
but were they no more tempting than these Swains, they'd have
small cause for the Restriction; for they are Strapping Sunburnt
Lasses, with little more Cloaths on than a dark coloured Smock, or
Frock; and for their Meen it is not enticing; these bring us Water
to Drink out of their Tanks, newly filled, which was Thick,
Troubled, and Slimy; for which reason the Vapours, or rather
Fumes from the Sun's violence, were very Offensive, and the more
irksome, because we were constrained to tarry here another Night,
for that the River <HI>Rute Conna Shure,</HI> or Salt-Water, was now over∣flown
by the Waters falling from the Mountains beyond the Barks
to that excess, that it could not be Forded by Travellers, and the
Stream ran with that Rapidness, that it was unsafe to venture over
till the descending Cataracts had left off pouring on the overswell'd
Brinks, and emptied themselves into the wider Gulf, not many
Leagues distant hence.</P>
<P>The Day after, as soon as we heard the Waters were abated, we
set forward, and found it true what had been reported (Three <HI>Ca∣phala</HI>'s
not daring to pass the Lake, where they had lain some Days,
till we dhad led the way). It was sultry Hot when we assayed to go,
but Delays in this case were dangerous: besides, we were uncertain
whether it would hold up should we tarry, which made us confide
on our Guides, who gave us assurance, that the Marshes were passa∣ble;
we were more troubled with Waves of Sand than Water, both
which, by Rain, or Wind, keep on their Course with some noise till
silenced in the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf.</P>
<P>Athwart this Fen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Great Bridge.</NOTE> which was upward of Three Miles, was Built
not long since, as by the Modern Architecture may be guessed, a state∣ly
Stone Bridge with Arches, on which high Banisters with Niches,
and a brave paved Cawsey Elegantly Built, which kept pace with us,
but by the Negligence of these People, as well as Injury of Floods
and Sands, it was broke down in several places, especially where the
Torrent made the deepest Channel, so that though firm and strong
in the greatest part of it, yet by its being ruined in the most
needful, it is become impassable; and though a Work of ex∣traordinary Benefit and Charge, yet already rendred of little
Use.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="137"/>
The rest of this day's Journy was between the Mountains, where
we were encounter'd by strange Flashes of Lightning, the Foretellers
of this Night's Rain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caurestan.</NOTE> which we hardly escaped before we came to
<HI>Caurestan,</HI> in all Twenty Miles: This <HI>Caravan Ser Raw</HI> is named from
a Tree growing here, and a Village properly so called (of which it
is a Composition in <HI>Persian</HI>), it being the first we met with whose
Houses were fixed.</P>
<P>The following Day we continued going between two Chains of
Dry and Burnt Hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Place where Men and Beasts have been de∣stroyed by the Heats.</NOTE> through a stony Valley, not without fear of
suffocating, although it was near Evening e're we set out, and Ye∣sterday's
Showers had benignly distilled on the Fiery Drought, to
cool the parched Earth: But this is the dreadful Vale, where when
the Hot <HI>North</HI> Winds blow at this time, it sweeps both Men and
Beasts away, either by Night or Day, the Heat being as intense and
as intolerable as that from the Mouth of an Oven: We were con∣ducted
through this Furnace by the Divine Protection (without
being put to make use of the common Remedy in this Exigency,
which is, upon perceiving of the hot Blasts, to cast our selves flat on
the Ground till they are over, thereby to prevent the Fate attending
those who refuse to stoop to this known Prescription, which is, to
fall down dead, never to rise more alive), till we were mounted
where these two Chains are linked to each other, and by their mutual
Ascent we were lift up on high, and then gently descending we were
let down to <HI>Goorbazergum,</HI> Fifteen Miles from <HI>Caurestan.</HI></P>
<P>In this Bottom is a solitary Inn,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Goor Bazergum,</HI> the Merchants Grave.</NOTE> very commodiously seated; it is
surrounded with Mountains, at whose Bottoms are store of Water-Melons,
a grateful Cooler in this Extremity of Heat: <HI>Goor-Bazergum</HI>
is as it were to say, <HI>The Merchants Grave,</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>Hence up Hill and down Hill, through broken Rocks and unstea∣dy
Stones, through kindled Fires from sulphurious Caverns, and the
more raging effects of the burning Orb, enlightening and enliven∣ing
all the World beside; here it kills and consumes the un-nurtur'd
Plants, leaving them dry and sapless; as if these great Heaps of
Rocks were made for no other end but to counterpoize the more
Fruitful Part of this Terrestrial Globe; insomuch that it had been
utterly impossible to have drawn Breath in this Place, had not the
late unusual Rain something allayed the Fury of the Heats, which
yet were troublesome enough by reason of the steaming Mists ari∣sing
boiling hot with the Sun; which so late in the Year are by the
most Ancient of this Country esteemed so far out of course, that
their Memory fails them to relate the like.</P>
<P>Nor do the Publick Roads deny the Calamity of these <HI>Munsels,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jehun.</NOTE>
which are frequently strewed with Bones of labouring Beasts, expi∣ring
under their Burthens, many of which were fresh Examples of
this Truth, lying reeking Carkasses in our Way from <HI>Goor Bazergum</HI> to
<HI>Jehun,</HI> which is but Twelve Miles, where we were forced to stay to
get more Camels, for Three had failed us in this Conflict; and af∣terwards
with much Pain we measured six Miles more to <HI>Tangedelon,</HI>
where we eased our selves at a <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI> near a Stream of li∣ving
Water sweetly gliding through the middle of it, and wash'd
<PB N="236" REF="138"/>
the Dust off our sweaty Bodies, in a Tank contrived to make a plea∣sant
Bath under the Roof of the <HI>Seraw.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tangedelon</HI> expresses in its Mothers Speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tangedelon <HI>and</HI> Cormoot.</NOTE> <HI>A Strait Passage,</HI> which
hits exactly with the following <HI>Munsel;</HI> for we travelled long under
hollowed Mountains, whose lofty Rocks hung over our Heads,
threatning to stop our Career, which after Twenty Rocky Miles di∣rected us to <HI>Cormoot,</HI> a Town of Dates, <HI>Cormoot</HI> being a Date,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>Thus far we came directly in a Line;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sham Zangee.</NOTE> now we wander to and
again in the Meanders of the Barren Hills, with indefatigable Indu∣stry,
till we descend into a large Plain, at the End whereof <HI>sham Zangee</HI>
an <HI>Abassin,</HI> had built an old Caravan, Twenty Miles from <HI>Cormoot;</HI>
where we met a <HI>Caphala</HI> of light Asses going for the Port; and here
we were obliged to change more of our Camels, they being quite
tired.</P>
<P>In this Plain the Heats increased upon us so, that we could not
touch the Walls but they were like Fire, the Winds that should re∣fresh
us were ready to inflame us, nor was any thing cool but the
Water, which they had kept in Earthen Vessels dipped in their Wells
or Tanks, where being drowned they came up shivering cold, which
was all the Comfort we received here; wherefore at Sun set we made
for <HI>Lhor,</HI> choaked with Dust and Heat; half-way, at a new <HI>Caravan
Ser Raw,</HI> we encountred three <HI>Caphalaes</HI> laden with Dry Fruit for
the Port: This was founded by the Overseer of the Building of the
Long-Bridge over the Lake leading to the Gulph, who raised him∣self
thereby, and begins (though covetous in other things) to be∣stow
his Mony on these Works, having laid the Foundation for ano∣ther
at <HI>Sham Zangee.</HI></P>
<P>From this Place to <HI>Lhor</HI> the Ground is more Even, and fit for Cul∣tivation,
the Husbandmen having planted their Cottages along the
Valley, on each side of a gliding Brook, here and there beset with
<HI>Tamerisk</HI> Trees.</P>
<P>About Nine in the Morning we came to <HI>Lhor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phor.</NOTE> near Forty Mile
from <HI>Sham Zaugee.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have here a neat, but small
Dwelling, whither their Commodore comes sometimes: In this we
designed to have worm some days away, but neither the Heat nor
<HI>Musquitoes</HI> would let us rest long in this City; wherefore desiring to
fly from these, we changed our Camels for Mules, that we might
make better speed than these slow Animals would endure; for these
intemperate Seats were too hot for us, so that the same Afternoon
we mounted, and on Horseback saw the remaining part of the City
leading us on our Way. The Road from <HI>Bunder</HI> to it is spacious and
open, through a pleasant Campaign for near Twenty Miles, the
Mountains observing a modest distance on that side, although behind
it is begirt with enough for defence; at top of which is a notable
Seat, fit for a Castle, being of difficult Access, from whence those
that approach, may hear the Thundring Cannons roar among the
Valleys, which were most taken from the <HI>Portugals</HI> in their being
beaten out of the Gulph.</P>
<P><HI>Lhor</HI> is a City of an Ancient Date, and still retains its Name,
which for that it was so guarded by Nature that it could not easily
<PB N="237" REF="138"/>
be conquered, held many Ages the Majesty of a Kingdom; but
now it is governed by a Puritanical <HI>Caun</HI> (for that he has visited
<HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb) under the <HI>Persian</HI> Emperor; yet still it extends
its self far in its Province, reaching almost to <HI>Bunder Abassee,</HI> and
has two eminent Ports tending to the Mouth of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> viz. <HI>Bun∣der
Congo</HI> and <HI>Bunder Reek,</HI> with half the Pearl-fishing, divided be∣tween
the <HI>Arab</HI> and <HI>Persian.</HI> He is in such Vogue at Court for his
Probity, that his Neighbour <HI>Caun</HI> was ordered to submit to his
Judgment, before whose Tribunal he appeared to answer the Crimes
objected to him in his Government.</P>
<P>However he is not so great a Bigot as to abstract himself wholly
from the Pleasures of this World, so as to deny himself his Paradise
here: for his Palaces shew not only studious Contrivances, but are
Luxurious both for inward Furniture and outward Beauty, with
which Pleasures he oftner indulges himself than he is at Leisure for
Publick Affairs.</P>
<P>Before his Palaces a Foursquare Piatzo takes in a large Space of
Ground, with Gates to every Quarter; over which his loud Musick
are placed, either to entertain Strangers, or by their Noise to give
the Time of the Day at every Three or Four Hours: At the Gate
entring the Palace is a constant Guard: Within are stately Apart∣ments,
with Lakes and Gardens, equal to the <HI>Roman</HI> Pride in its

Animadversions on the Second and Sixth Paragraph of <HI>Garcius ab
Ortâ:</HI> Whose Words are to this Effect;</P>
<P><Q>This Stone I find not only to be generated in <HI>Persia,</HI> but also in

<P><Q>The <HI>Persians</HI> then call this Stone <HI>Pazahar,</HI> being a Compound of

much as if you should say in <HI>Greek, Antidoton,</HI> in <HI>English,</HI> Counter-Poyson.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It grows after this manner;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How bred.</NOTE> there is a Place in <HI>Persia</HI> called <HI>Ste∣banon,</HI>
as <HI>Bontius</HI> writes, the <HI>Persians Shabanat,</HI> Three Days Jour∣ney
beyond <HI>Lhor,</HI> in whose Fields there springs up an Herb like
Saffronand Hermodactyls, on which the Flocks of Goats (or
Sheep) feed, and by their eating thereof these Stones concrete
and become an hard Substance; but I suspend my Vote, whether
in the Stomach, Reins, or Bladder: However, that Belief may be
gained for any of these, seeing them halt and complain as much as
Men under the same distress, would more than incline the most in∣credulous.
They are not, says he, unlike the <HI>Europe</HI> Goats, only
they have logner and straiter Horns: They are not of divers Co∣lours,
as the affirms, neither go they in Flocks or Herbs together;
though I have eaten of their Flesh more than once, hunted by
Greyhounds, being turned loose from the Mountains, they having
much of the Nature of Venison both in their Taste and Aspect.
Moreover these Creatures (rather Sheep than goats) as they breed
greater or lesser Stones, they discover it by their Gate, of which
both the crafty <HI>Armenian</HI> as well as <HI>Persian</HI> are well advised.</Q></P>
<P>Other Creatures as well as these are subject to this Distemper, as
Cows, Sheep, and Apes; which last is reckoned the most excellent
<HI>Bezoar</HI> by more than a few.</P>
<P>To the Directions already given,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Trial.</NOTE> I shall add, That the true <HI>Bezoar</HI>
Stones have a Straw, or something in resemblance thereof, which
never fails but in the Adulterate; and if the upper Coat being sha∣ved
ff, there succeed not another Round, as is visible in Onions,
till you come to the Straw, without doubt it is Counterfeit.</P>
<P>But the following Method will better betray the Cheat, because
they leave nothing unattempted to impose upon the Buyers: If you
<PB N="239" REF="139"/>
rub the Stone with a little Lime, and if in the chafed Part there ap∣pears
a Purple Colour, it declares it true and genuine, without sophi∣stication.
Or if you cast them into a Bason of Water, after an ex∣act
Account is taken of their Weight, and they be taken out Three
Hours after, and weighed again, and it answer the first Account, nei∣ther
losing nor gaining by their stay in the Water, then pronounce
them right: But if being rubbed with Lime they chance to crack, or
a Flaw be made in the Trial, or that they alter upon their Im∣mersion
in the Water, you slander them not, if you say they are
False.</P>
<P>In this Country <HI>Assa Faetida</HI> is gathered at a Place called <HI>Descoon;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assa Faetida.</NOTE>

<P>It is usual on the News of our Approach to these great Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Civility of the <HI>Persian</HI> Governors ends in Cove∣tousness.</NOTE> or
Populous Towns, for the Governors or their Deputies to expect the
coming of our Agent a <HI>Pharsang</HI> out of Town, bringing the Men of
Note with him to attend us to our Lodgings, and bring us with Pomp
through their Streets, and at the same time lay in Store for us and
our Horses, ushering in huge Courses of Provisions, both ready
dress'd and undress'd, as also Services of Sweetmetas dried and un∣dried,
sending in Sheep, Goat, and Pullen, Barley, Rice, and the
like; and at our departure Present us with <HI>Persian</HI> Steeds for our
Journy: For which we must not stir till we have paid sufficiently, by
return of our Country Manufactures, as Scarlet, Watches, or some∣thing
of greater Value: <HI>Tam citò in avaritiam excurrit sua humani∣tas;

Gift, which is bestowed with an intent to gain? Since any manner

being rewarded for their forced Courtesy, upon our mounting they
conducted us on our Way, as far as they waited to bring us in.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">We Measure the utmost Bounds of the Provinces of Lhor and
Gerom, to the City of Siras.</HEAD>
<P>BEING now advanced upon the Mountains, among whose
Tops and Turnings we make our Progress; fresh instances of the
Convulsions which this Sulphurious Soil is subject to encounter us, as
by the Cloven Hills and Rocks we may be convinced could be effected
by no other means than by terrible Earthquakes from the Bowels of
the Earth: Among these droughty and uncouth Paths, having
wearied our Steps for Three <HI>Pharsangs,</HI> we came to a <HI>Caravan Ser
Raw,</HI> by Name <HI>Pokutal,</HI> at the foot of these Mountains, and the
beginning of a spacious Plain, where we found the first alleviation
from the fierce Heats of the Noon of Night, though at Noon Day
we could not think our case much amended.</P>
<P><HI>Po</HI> is interpreted the Basis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pokutal.</NOTE> <HI>Kutal</HI> of the Hill; this Inn was a new,
strong, square, large Inn; the first we stabled, or rather shut our
Doors in a-Nights, it being Built after the best Form, and Capacious
of a great Number, both in the outward Square and inner Stables;
to this belonged Three stately Tanks with a deep Well, some an
Hundred Fathoms down to the Bottom, with a Pond, either to Wa∣ter
or Wash the Cattel in, hard by it; the perfect proof of our be∣ing
passed the Sands, which hold not digging such a depth, this
being White Marble; and the whole Plain promised a more fruitful
Clay.</P>
<P>Hence to <HI>Bury</HI> metes out Twelve Miles more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bury.</NOTE> where the best
<HI>Carava Ser Raw</HI> is on all the Road, it being not only well Adorned
with White facing Stone, but is both a Large and Convenient, as
well as Stately Fabrick.</P>
<P>Hard by this is a <HI>Peor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Peor,</HI> or Prophet's Tomb.</NOTE> or Burying-place of one of their Pro∣phets,
being a goodly Monument, with an <HI>Arabick</HI> School Founded
in his Honour, and Endowed witha good Pension for to maintain
the Devotion of their Priests.</P>
<P>The next <HI>Munsel</HI> we hardly Went,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bonaru.</NOTE> but Crept onward to, through
amost impassable and dangerous Precipices, with all the heed imagi∣nable,
for a Trip here could not hae been retrieved without the loss
of our Lives; but by the Divine Providence we came to <HI>Bonaru,</HI>
an Eight Cornered <HI>Carousan,</HI> Eighteen Miles from <HI>Bury;</HI> there on an
Hill are the remains of a regular Fortification, with a suppliment of
Outworks on every side, without any Avenue, unless on one side;
between this Village and <HI>Bury,</HI> the Inhabitants reckon a many Ca∣stles
on the Mountains with large Tanks of Water, and Store-houses
for Provisions of Corn, Cut out of the main Rocks with indefari∣gable
Cost and Industry, which Works were they to be begun now
(say they) could not be Finished by the Expertest Artists in Fifty
Years. They yet retain a Warlike Disposition, being still accounted
the best Gunners here of any other places in <HI>Persia;</HI> at the Entrance
into this place are unsizable Heads of Mountain-Rams with their
<PB N="241" REF="140"/>
Horns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. III.</NOTE> set up as the Trophies of their Skill in Shooting them; and
as a farther Argument of the cruel slaughter made among their Fore∣fathers,
for more than Three Days Journy together, the Fields are
every where filled with Graves.</P>
<P>And now we began to be acquainted with the shift they make for
Water in these dry Countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What shift they make for Water.</NOTE> where there is little Rain, and no Rivu∣lets;
they Dig for Springs, and when they have found one, they fol∣low
the Water-Course which way it directs under Ground, Hollow∣ing
the Ground, and at every Thirty or Forty Yards, cast up a
Mole-Hill, where they make a Pit to Ventilate and let in the Air to
Purify the Water, as well as to Cleanse and Channel, and this Course
holds on many <HI>Pharsangs</HI> together for the advantage of the Vallies;
and this I look upon to be as much the cause of the Generation of
the <HI>Bezoar</HI>-Stone in the Animals aforesaid, as the reasons alledged
there by <HI>Bontius</HI> for their Production; for by the consent of all Phy∣sicians,
nothing contributes more to the Breeding of the Stone in
Men, than such things as are Undigested and create Obstructi∣ons;
nor can any thing be more Obstructing than such Water as is
drawn from Wells and deep Caverns, where the Sun has little influ∣ence,
as we may have occasion to manifest afterwards; and there∣fore
we may probably Conjecture, these Unconcocted Waters to be
a main instrument of their production, since where these are in
use, this Accident is more general than in other places.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bonaru</HI> to <HI>Mousar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mousar</HI> the ut∣most extent of the Province of <HI>Lhor.</HI></NOTE> another Eight-square <HI>Caravan,</HI> are Fif∣teen
Miles, fine, plain, and easy way; near the <HI>Caravan Ser Raw</HI> was a
pleasant Garden, the utmost extent of the <HI>Caun</HI> of <HI>Lhor</HI>'s Dominions
on this Road.</P>
<P>And as a Boundary thereto, is opposed the steepest Hill we have
yet met with, insomuch that we found it a notable Task to gain the
Top by the Morning of the following Day, contenting our selves to
sit down at <HI>Chawtalk,</HI> but Nine miles from <HI>Bonaru,</HI> being advised of
a more troublesome Day's Journy the <HI>Munsel</HI> after this; not so diffi∣cult
for Access as this, but a more continued Labour by the multi∣tude
of Mountains we were to Master, and on that account it was
highly necessary to Feed our <HI>Caphala</HI>'s well before we undertake so
great a Work.</P>
<P><HI>Chawtalk,</HI> (by the most valuable Munificence of the Benefactor,
yet living to Oversee this good Deed compleated) is a noble newe
<HI>Caravan,</HI> an Ample and Princely Building: Naer to it was, not
long since, only a Well of Bitter Water, which gives Name to the
Place; but by the Cost and Inquest of this Pious Benefactor, Sweeter
Waters are at this time produced, something more remote, for
Men to Drink, though the Cattel refuse not generally the other.</P>
<P>On these Mountains the <HI>Mastich</HI> Tree brings forth plenty of that
Gum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manna.</NOTE> of which the Country People make good Profit: Nor does less
Benefit accrue by the Mellifluous Dew a-Nights turn'd into Manna,
from the Leafs and Shrubs, as well as Plants, upon the sides of
these Mountains, which are not altogether so Barren as those we
have hitherto passed; this Manna is White and Granulated, and, what
I have found my self, I think not inferior to the <HI>Calabrian.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="141"/>
As for the Mastick Trees, they bore Red Berries, and if wound∣ed
would spew out the liquid Resin from the Branches; they are not
very tall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mastick.</NOTE> of the bigness of our Bully Trees: Whether they bring
forth a Cod or not, this Season would not inform me, nor can I say
it agrees in all respects with the Lentisk Tree of <HI>Clusius.</HI></P>
<P>Here also grows the Wild or Bitter Almond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bitter Almond.</NOTE> the Wands or Sticks
of which are in Esteem, for that Tradition of their being of the
same Tree with those of <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Rod, which budding brought forth
Almonds, and for that reason are worn by those of the highest Rank
among them: More of this anon.</P>
<P>And now the time approaches we must pass over in one Day as
many Mountains as we have hitherto been conquering, some of
whose Clifts could never be gained, had they not been joined toge∣ther
by vast Arches from Rock to Rock, their dismal Pits otherwise
being rendred impassable: Thus by inexpressible Endeavours we
strive to clear this formidable Chain of Hills, all in the Heat of the
Sun (not daring to trust our selves in the Night), whereby we had
our Skins flead off of those Parts exposed to the Solar Rays; and those
that fared best had Bladders raised, as if scalded or burnt by the Fire;
for which, when we had travell'd One and twenty Miles, we found
at <HI>Gerom</HI> a ready Medicine of the Butter of the Seed of Gourds made
into an Ointment, which appeased the Inflammation by its cooling
Virtue, and immediately asswaged the Pain by Basting our selves
herewith, being half Roasted.</P>
<P>We refreshed our selves one entire Day at <HI>Gerom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gerom.</NOTE> where a small
White Grape, without any Stone, was an excellent Cordial; the
Wine pressed from it is white also, and the strongest by Natural Fer∣mentation
only, that I ever drank; they are called <HI>Kismas</HI> Grapes,
and the Wine is known by the same Name farther than where they
grow, it being of so stout a Body that it is not subject to decay
presently; though their best Wines when they begin to turn, are fit
for nothing but Vinegar, they being inexpert either in their Cure,
or to preserve them; that which we drink is pure, without any So∣phistication.</P>
<P>There grow no where better Dates than at this Town;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The strongest Wine and best Dates here.</NOTE> and pack∣ed
up dry are preferred before others all the World over.</P>
<P>The People that dwell here are for the most part blind; for of
Three you meet, Two shall not see, and it may be a Third shall
have but half an Eye.</P>
<P>The Occasion whereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of their Blind∣ness.</NOTE> as they report, is, because little pretty
coloured Mice and Weasels by their poysonous Stale infect the Trees
so, that they produce Worms, the Parent of this Distemper; more tru∣ly
fancying than proving this Secret, for want of that Microscope
whereby <HI>Kepler</HI> assisted this enquiring Age to discover, That
no kind of Plant whatsoever but procreates of its superfluous Juice
some putrid Humour, which by active Nature is enliven'd into Vital
Motion, forming to every one their proper Insects.</P>
<P>Whether any Virulency may be ascribed to these, or the immoderate
eating of Dates ought to be accused of their excessive Heat, as we do
Wormwood, which for that reason we account offensive to the Eyes, I
know not; following herein the Prince of Physicians, <HI>Calidis enim qui
<PB N="243" REF="141"/>
saepè multumque utuntur, nervorum infirmitatem adferunt, in Aph.</HI> 16.
<HI>Hyp. lib.</HI> 5. who says, They who accustom themselves to eat Hot
things, bring on themselves the Weakness of the Nerves, and con∣sequently
decay their Eyesight, the Optick Nerves being signally
affected, through which Organs, Spirits ought to be conveyed princi∣pally
for the service of the Eyes.</P>
<P>To which Evil no doubt Sympathy makes a great Addition, whe∣ther
in the Individual, or in respect of others: Wherein the Poet
Philosophized, when he sang,
<Q>Cum spectant oculi laesos laeduntur &amp; ipsi.</Q></P>
<P>But above all, the Sands, which have here the same effect as else∣where.</P>
<P>This is a Free Town, enfranchis'd with Liberties peculiar to its
self, being independent on any other Governor but its own; though
he be but a <HI>Calenture</HI> or Bayliff, giving Laws, and ruling by his own
Power, being accountable to none but the Emperor: His Jurisdicti∣on
spreads a great way, for that he is not inferior in Wealth to many
<HI>Cauns,</HI> only somewhat less in Dignity.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> in his <HI>Itinerary</HI> relates <HI>Gerom</HI> to have its denomina∣tion
from certain <HI>Jews</HI> who took up their Abode here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Town is Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI>'s <HI>Kirjoth-Jerom.</HI></NOTE> and gave it
this Name in honour of their <HI>Kirjoth-Jerom:</HI> But whether more of
that Nation dwell here than in other great Towns, I am not tho∣roughly
advertised, and therefore forbear determining.</P>
<P>A Mile from the Town had been a Coloss, now half ruined by
Age, bearing still some Marks of its pristine Majesty, it being more
than Sixty Foot high, and Thirty in Circumference, raised in Me∣mory
of some departed Saint; it overlooks a great many more hum∣ble
Tombs, not liable therefore to such Dilapidation.</P>
<P>Leaving these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wheat.</NOTE> we pass through plough'd Fields, sowed with Wheat
and almost mowed, it being Harvest time.</P>
<P>In this Plain abundance of Liquorice grows wild;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liquorice.</NOTE> and by the
Brooks sides are planted Country Mansions, with store of Sallows
and Willows. At Midnight we came to <HI>Mocock Sugta (i. e.</HI> a dry
Clove) Twenty two Miles, having forded several Plashes where
flourished lascivious Shrubs, more like <HI>Southernwood</HI> than <HI>Osiers,</HI> till
we were inclosed again in the Mountains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rhadars</HI> here had apprehended a sturdy Thief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft punish∣ed with im∣muring.</NOTE> who had set
upon a poor Merchant, and drove away his Ass loaded with <HI>Indian</HI>
Cloth: These sort of Vermin are rare, either for the exemplary Pu∣nishment
inflicted, which is Immuring, when detected, or for the for∣mer
mentioned Satisfaction to be made by the <HI>Shawbunder,</HI> who em∣ploys
these <HI>Rhadarees,</HI> restoring to every one their proper Goods, or
else giving them the full Value.</P>
<P>I shall not deviate much to give a credible Instance from our Agent,
who upon the Road by the Remissness of the <HI>Shotters</HI> had his Gold
Bridle and other Furniture stole out of a <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI> after they
had come tired in. As soon as they were missing, upon notice given
to the Captain of the <HI>Rhadars,</HI> a strict Search being made presently,
it was not long e're the Criminal was detected, and taken with his
<PB N="244" REF="142"/>
Prize, the latter restored, and the other left to the Mercy of the
Agent, who might have cut him to pieces without any other For∣mality
of Process, had he not delivered him over to be chastised by
his Accusers, who were not wanting to inflict what Punishment his
Fact deserved, the next <HI>Caun</HI> adjudging him the Severity of the Law.</P>
<P>Here again over the Portal of the Inn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monstrous <HI>Persian</HI> Rams.</NOTE> were advanced the Crests to
the <HI>Persian</HI> Arms, I mean huge Rams-heads, Horns and all, which
declare what would seem monstrous to relate, they surpassing in
Bulk as well as Courage all those of other Nations; not for their
Heads alone, but their Tails, which sometimes prove such Incum∣brances,
that unless small Carts were ordained for their Carriage
(especially the tame ones), they would trail upon the Ground, and
wound themselves against every sharp Stone and rough Piece of
Ground: But these exalted are the Offspring of the Mountains, shel∣tring
themselves among the Rocks and untrodden Paths of the Hills.</P>
<P>Where,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polium.</NOTE> and in our Passage, grew the Mountain-<HI>Poly,</HI> which struck
our Scent, till we descended a Fruitful Valley, abounding with
Springs of Water, which gave Increase to many Furlongs loaded
with Rice or <HI>Paddy,</HI> being courser than the <HI>Indian;</HI> from whence
not only <HI>Persia,</HI> but all the World besides, must fetch the best and
finest Rice.</P>
<P>This Valley led us to <HI>Caifer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caifer</HI> bounds <HI>Garom,</HI> and the Growth of Palms.</NOTE> some Five <HI>Pharsangs,</HI> a Village blest
with all Fruits <HI>Persia</HI> glories in, but above all, the choicest Oranges;
but this unseasonable Year, with the help of the Locusts, had blast∣ed
them all. This Town, as it terminates the Bounds of <HI>Gerom,</HI> so
it puts an end to the genuine Growth of the Palm-Tree, it being
barren beyond this Place, and therefore only set in Great Mens Gar∣dens
for Shew, it delighting rather in Hot and Dry Ground, such as
Sands, and such as come nighest in Nature to them: Moreover, the
Climate beyond this Place admits of too cold a Winter for their Nou∣rishment,
which I impute to be the chiefest Cause.</P>
<P>This Town is planted in the Bosom of two Rows of Hills, reach∣ing
<HI>Siras,</HI> which delivers us to a delightful Plain, adorned with Cy∣press-Trees
on each hand, and plenteously stored with Villages and
Running Water on every side.</P>
<P>And now it was pleasant to behold the Harvest-men labouring
with their Sythes, the Wheat blading low; the Ruther Beasts with
distended Bags grazing in the Meadows, the Sheep with their broad
Tails gathered into Folds, and the wary Shepherd on his Guard to
defend them, as well as to dress them when infected with any Ma∣ladies;
the Groves look'd Green, as in the midst of Summer's Pride,
whose Bowers the Winged Choristers made chearful with their un∣confined
Notes, their Mirth as free as their Melody untaught, being
actuated by no other Rule than Instinct.</P>
<P>These gave us hopes of future Moderation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Firaw.</NOTE> nor were they flat∣tering;
for we had not traced Ten Miles of this pleasant Way, when
we came to <HI>Firaw, (The Foot of the Way,</HI>) where <HI>Aga Tocke</HI> had
placed a <HI>Caravan Ser Raw;</HI> but here we were forced to gather those
Garments close about us, the wearing of which we hitherto rather
thought an useless Decency, than a real Requisite.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="142"/>
From hence to <HI>Mussaferry</HI> we toiled through rugged and uneasy
Ways to a very splendid <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mussaferry.</NOTE> some Fourteen Miles more,
where we took our Rest: And thence along a sweet Campaign, wa∣tred
by a delicate Rivulet on the Left, at the Bottom of the decli∣ning
Hills, bestowing its Blessing on the adjacent Villages and Coun∣try
Towns.</P>
<P>We continued journying all this Night;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bobba Hodge.</NOTE> wherefore the Sun had
gilded the Firmament with his Vermilion Red, before we took up at
<HI>Bobba Hodge,</HI> Thirty Miles compleat from our last Stage. Where
intending to have been quiet, we were interrupted more than ever
by impertinent Gnats and Flies, by reason of the Concourse of Wa∣ters
nourishing abundance of Rushes and Fenny Plants, which har∣boured
these and gave them Refuge in the Day, but at Night they
broke out of their Lurking-places, and beset us with that Rage and
Force, that no Resistance or Fence can be made against them; for,
say they hyperbolically, They will bite through Armour; the best
<HI>Persian</HI> Boots (which are low-heel'd and good Cordavan Leather)
being not Proof against their Assaults.</P>
<P>Wherefore the Eve to the same Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Udgewally.</NOTE> to avoid these invincible
Assailants, the disturbers of our Repose, we held on our Pace through
Pasture-Grounds, such as our Commons, where they are down-fed,
that little more than Green-Sod appears, in which were wanton
Foles and unback'd Colts, with Mares for Breed, and unbridled Stal∣lions,
sporting on the spacious Downs, which brought us onwards to
<HI>Siras</HI> Twelve Miles more, <HI>viz.</HI> to the <HI>Beggars-Garden</HI> (but one <HI>Phar∣sang</HI>
short of the City) called <HI>Ʋdgewally.</HI></P>
<P>Here we had scarcely alighted, but the <HI>French</HI> Agent having no∣tice
of our coming, beat up our Quarters, and broke us of our
Sleep.</P>
<P>By Break of Day the <HI>Armenian</HI> Christians, which are numerous,
came to congratulate our Arrival, and brought Banquets of Wine,
Fruit, and a Cold Treat, with Led Horses of State, and loud Mu∣sick,
to make our Entry the more Pompous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Entry in∣to <HI>Siras.</HI></NOTE> In order whereunto,
about Eleven in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Morning, conducted with much Ceremony,
we approached <HI>Siras,</HI> where we found Spectators answerable to the
Novelty of our Appearance, and the Greatness of our Train, with
which we were passing through this City nigh Two Hours, before
we were enclos'd within the Walls of the <HI>English</HI> House, which is a
Noble one, in the middle of a stately Garden.</P>
<P>Hither came the Fathers of all Orders to bid us Welcome, that
were resident in the several Convents allowed them in this City; all
which, and other Christian Attendants, were not dismiss'd till after a
Splendid Dinner provided by our Interpreter, who makes some
Thousands a Year by the License of our Winepress, the Profit where∣of
is wholly his.</P>
<P>The Wines of the Growth of this Country are esteemed the most
Stomachical and Generous in all <HI>Persia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wines of <HI>Siras</HI> gene∣rous.</NOTE> and fittest for common
drinking, when allayed a little with Water, otherwise too heady for
the Brain, and heavy for the Stomach, their Passage being retarded
for want of that proper Vehicle: It is incredible to see what Quan∣tities
they drink at a Merry-meeting, and how unconcerned the next
<PB N="246" REF="143"/>
day they appear, and brisk about their Business, and will quaff you
thus a whole Week together.</P>
<P>In which Exercise when they engage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The People good Compa∣nions.</NOTE> they observe this Maxim,
Always to lay in Ballast, they eating heartily; and all the time that
Healths are passing about, they have Cucumbers, Melons, and other
Fruits before them, which must be acknowledged to receive the most
perfect Ripeness, and therefore are more innocent here than any
where else. Tobacco is a general Companion; and to give them
their due, they are Conversable Good-Fellows, sparing no one his
Bowl in their turn; and to be sure none shall escape a Nosegay,
Orange, or some such Mark as passes with every Health; so that
sometimes when they mind Discourse more than the Business in hand,
a whole Nest of Posies wait on one Man, who must clear himself, or
disgust those whose Healths remain unpledg'd.</P>
<P>Having discharg'd the Fatigue of this Day, it remained incum∣bent
on our parts to return these Civilities, which was to renew the
Trouble again, each striving to outvye others in their Entertain∣ments:
In these Courteous Visits we spent a Week, nor was that suf∣ficient,
but we being late in the Year for this Journey to <HI>Spahaun,</HI>
our Interpreter excused our Neglect.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Siras, and the Ancient City Persepolis, and our Journying
quite through Persia.</HEAD>
<P>IN our Stay here we had Opportunity to observe <HI>Siras,</HI> not only by
Fame, but indeed to be, second to none, except the Royal City, in
the whole Empire: And in this Country, the Country which is pro∣perly
<HI>Persia</HI> (extended from the Gulph to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>luchos,</HI> which parts
<HI>Parthia</HI> from it by a great Ditch made for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndary on that Side
to this Ancient Kingdom) it is the principal Metropolis.</P>
<P>It is delivered as a Tradition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Siras</HI> the chief City in <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE> That it arose from the Ruins of <HI>Per∣sepolis:</HI>
Others will have it as old as <HI>Cyrus▪</HI> who contend for him to
be the Founder, for that the nearness of the Name intimates as much:
But that he should raise it as a Monument, seems not so probable,
who would not permit it at his Death, as that these People, devoted
to his Memory, might on the Miscarriage of <HI>Persepolis,</HI> raise this in
Honour of him, whose Remembrance might at once revive the Glo∣ry
of the then fallen Monarchy, and bury the hated Name of the
new Conqueror in Oblivion, who had sullied all his Lawrels by
hearkning to the unlimited Revenge of a Prostitute, to lay the most
flourishing <HI>Persepolis</HI> in Ashes, from whence, <HI>Phoenix</HI> like, this is
supposed to spring.</P>
<P>And when we enter its Wealthy Markets, or <HI>Buzzars, Basilick</HI>
Buildings, supported by Rows of vast Pillars covered at top, of
which there are innumerable, large and splendid, abounding with
<PB N="247" REF="143"/>
Rich Merchandize;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. IV.</NOTE> the stately Palaces of the <HI>Caun</HI> and other No∣bles;
the pleasant Walks and Gardens, Colleges and Temples, the
Tombs, and Water-Courses; we may afflict our selves with the
Losses magnified by <HI>Historians,</HI> but at the same time do Injustice to
so valuable a Reparation, which, for ought I know, exceeds the
worth of the other: And what adds to its Esteem, it is reckoned by the
<HI>Persians</HI> an Holy City, wherefore it's Endowed with Schools and Con∣vents,
with Allowance for Students; nor do they in any place ex∣cel,
(for the Concinnity of Harmony in <HI>Chorus</HI> from the high Towers
of their Mosques at their stated Hours for Devotion) these sweet
Singers of <HI>Siras:</HI> It boasts therefore of its being an University;
which it truly merits from the confluence of all the Learned Tribe
coming hither for Education.</P>
<P>Their stately Gardens and Summer-Houses are out of the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Gar∣dens.</NOTE>
whither resort those Invited either by Curiosity or Recreation; the
most famous of which we Visited, under whose shady Bowers we
were Feasted, from the Heel of every Day till Midnight, while we
remained here, by the interchangeable Solicitations of our Christian
Friends.</P>
<P>Among which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cypress Trees the big∣est in the Uni∣verse.</NOTE> that, honoured with the Royal Claim, and there∣fore
stiled the <HI>King's Garden,</HI> deservedly carries the Lustre from the
rest, and though every one share in some Excellency or other, yet this
comprehends them all in one, being a large Map of the whole:
Here grow the loftiest Cypress-Trees in the Universe; nor do they
want Bodies proportionable to their Height, one of which is said to be
Set by <HI>Shaw Abas,</HI> their Beloved Emperor, Measures some Fathoms
round: So addicted are these People to Loyal Heartedness, that
what is Great, or Magnificent, they offer up as a grateful Testimo∣ny
to perpetuate the Fame of those Princes who have deserved well
in their Annals; for which reason these Trees keep the Name of <HI>To∣ken
Cyr,</HI> even down to this our Age; willing thereby to Immorta∣lize
the <HI>Grand Cyrus,</HI> transmitting an unalterable Tradition as lasting
as Posterity its self.</P>
<P>These set in Order make Majestick Walks, under whose shelter
thrive the Underwoods; which were they removed from the first
Rank of the Quarters, whether our Countrymen would allow the
rest to be Wilderness, Orchard, or Garden, would be a Question;
since these, with the Water-courses, make the whole Design of the
Perspective; in which promiscuously are included Philberts, Hasle∣nuts,

<P>We return'd back to the City, Lighted by Torches and Flambeaus
over a noble Bridge, from whence the Street enlarges gracefully a
good length, till we were received into straiter Allies, the rest of the
Streets being mostly such, or else covered <HI>Buzzars;</HI> this Bridge
serves only to pass over, when the sudden Showers, and Water falling
from the Mountains, raise a Flood, at other times it being dry un∣der
it, here being no River; though Water is not lacking every
where there, flowing plentifully in Rills or Brooks, taking their source
from the Mountains, with which it is invested on every part,
except the <HI>South</HI>-side, which lies plain and open a great way.</P>
<P>These Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vine∣yards.</NOTE> as well as Vallies, are stocked with Vineyards,
being disposed to bear good Grapes, out of which they press their
Wine, and from the Wine-fat set it to Work in great Earthen

Chests.</P>

is Deposed and cast into Prison, laden with Irons, as a Capital Of∣fender,

Fifteen Miles distance from <HI>Siras.</HI></P>
<P>From hence to the River <HI>Bindamire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Araxes,</HI> now <HI>Bindamire.</HI></NOTE> or the River <HI>Araxes,</HI> (fa∣mous
for its untraced Windings upon the Mountains, and sometimes
under their very Bottoms, till by its rapid course it vents its self in∣to
the Sea), were Twelve Mile more; which having passed, I be∣gan
to revolve whether ever <HI>Alexander,</HI> the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Victor, had
been over it or no; which because it is Recorded he passed his Army
over <HI>Araxes</HI> by a Bridge of his own Building, I know not if that
be proof enough of this being that River, or of his passing this
place more than that; the Stream runs with a Torrent whereby it is
unsafe Fording the River without such a Suppliment.</P>
<P>Though as if that were too Trite and Common, I cannot forbear
without some Mirth, relating what I had from a <HI>Persian</HI> in this
Journy, pointing to an Hill; There, quoth he, stands the Monu∣ment
of a Miracle performed by <HI>Band Haimero,</HI> the Prophet who
gave Name and Credit to this Plain, and consequently to the Bridge
athwart this River, which is a thing beyond Human reach to effect,
otherwise too mean to exact our Belief.</P>
<P>This Prophet was one of the Twelve Apostles, or Succes∣sors
of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> nor was this Fact unworthy of so great a Title; for
he leading an Host this way, after a notable descent of Rain, which
caused this place to overflow, the progress of his Forces was thereby
impeded; which he peceiving, thus bespoke that Mountain, <HI>March
into the middle of the Waters Confluence, and lay thy self in that man∣ner,
that there be sure Footing for my Host;</HI> to whom it readily obey∣ing,
became an high Road for his Soldiers to pass over dry shod:
But when after this device he had Ferried over his Multitude, it was
told him an huge Casm, or Hell-Kettle was left where the Mountain
had emptied its self; not being much concerned at the Accident, and
meeting a Country Fellow who by chance had a Cheese, he cast it
into the Well; which was not filled so, but that it gave occasion to
the Satyrists of that time to Lampoon it in their own Language,
<Q><L>Band Haimero has</L>
<L>Agger hau tauk k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onet As</L>
<L>Colobe Painer has.</L></Q>
<Q><L>What wanting is to fill the place,</L>
<L>Not from <HI>Band Haimer</HI> is, but the Cheese.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Band</HI> was the Epithet to the Prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why called <HI>Bindamire.</HI></NOTE> which signifies Abstemious,
a Virtue more admired than followed, and <HI>Haimero</HI> his Proper
Name, wherefore both the Bridge and Plain, as well as River, by
<HI>Boterus</HI> is corruptly called <HI>Bindamire,</HI> as appears by this ridiculous
<PB N="251" REF="145"/>
Tale; which I mention for this end, that the true Appellation the
<HI>Persians</HI> now give them, and their Reason for it may be recovered.</P>
<P>The Bridge over the River is very old, raised high by four Arches,
in the middle a Watch-Tower for the <HI>Rhadars</HI> to look out on, to ap∣prehend
such as shall by By-ways attempt to deprive them of their
Customs, as also to be at hand to secure those that Travel the Road.</P>
<P>Unless sometimes they connive at Excursions for their own Booty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We suspect the <HI>Rhadars</HI> to be Robbers at <HI>Meergoscoon.</HI></NOTE>
as this Day we had cause to suspect; for this Evening the Rear of
our <HI>Caphala</HI> we had taken with us, being only Servants with Arms
(the other coming more leisurely, kept the direct Road), were set
upon twice; but finding them in a condition to receive them, they
wheeled off in the Dusk, but with an intention to take us napping
when we were in our Lodgings at <HI>Meergoscoon,</HI> Twelve Mile off the
Bridge, smooth Way, full of Farms and Country Towns; among
which Plain dealing seems most an end to be their only Guard; for
they being alarmed by the Rogues that dogged us, rose immediately
in our defence, and gave us notice of our Danger, after one of the
Villains, on pretence to light his Pipe, had rudely broke in upon us,
to discover in what Posture we were, who perceiving their Pains
would be only Blows, gave us no farther disturbance.</P>
<P>However we were the more willing on this account to get up by
the crowing of the Cock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persepolis <HI>now</HI> Chulminor.</NOTE> to pursue our Journy to <HI>Persepolis,</HI> whose
Ruins we had reached by Break of Day; when having compassed
its Marble Foundations (being above, an Area of a large Extent, on
the Plain an high Wall, giving some Pains to the attollent Muscles of
the Neck, to give the Eyes leave to reach its Height), we clambred
a spacious Staircase united some part of the Way up, when on each
hand it led to the several Apartments two different Ways; at top
were the Portals, and the Heads of the Columns worn with Age
(<HI>damnosa enim quid non imminuit dies</HI>) which consumes every thing;
whose Bodies were <HI>Corinthian,</HI> but the Pedestals and Capitals of <HI>Do∣rick</HI>
Order, as might be gained from what had resisted the corroding
Jaws of Time, hardly lifting up their Reverend Crowns, though
of most durable Stone.</P>
<P>Being entred the <HI>Pomaerium</HI> of <HI>Cambyses</HI> Hall (if Faith be to be
given to the most Learned of these Relators), at the Hall Gates we
encountred two horrid Shapes both for Grandeur and Unwontedness,
being all in Armour, or Coat of Mail, striking a Terror on those
about to intrude; their Countenances were of the fiercest Lions,
and might pass for such, had not huge Wings made them flying Gryf∣fons,
and their Bulk and Hinder-Parts exceeded the largest Ele∣phants.</P>
<P>In this August Place only Eighteen Pillars of Forty remain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stocks build on the Pillars.</NOTE> about
Fifty Foot high, and half an Ell Diameter, of the distance of eight
Paces one from another, though we could count the Twenty two
Bases; which agree with the <HI>Persian</HI> Memoirs, who therefore still
call it <HI>Chulminor, The Palace of Forty Pillars:</HI> These may be seen on
the Plain a great way, and at present are the Residence only of the
Tyrants of the Lakes and Fens, Storks only keeping their Court
here, every Pillar having a Nest of them.</P>
<Q><PB N="252" REF="146"/>
<L>Nutrit ubi implumes peregrina Ciconia faetus,</L>
<L>Ad nidos abies confita primo fuit.</L></Q>
<P>Which may serve to contradict the received Opinion, of Storks
abiding only where Commonwealths are; this always having been
an Empire, and at this time is the most Absolute in all the Earth.</P>
<P>Beyond these, many Pieces and Scraps of Antiquity offer us a
View, and great <HI>Colossus's</HI> supporting vast Giants, as if they had
been Yeomen of the Guard in the Anti-room to the Presence-Cham∣ber,
which was Eighty Foot Square, where on the Fragments of
Walls standing, and over the Porticoes especially, were most curi∣ously
cut out of delicate White Shining Marble, Men in Military
Habit, like the Old <HI>Grecian Phalanx</HI> (if there be leave for Con∣jecture)
encompassing a Monarch represented sitting on his Throne,
with a Moving Canopy, such as the <HI>Eastern</HI> Kings have carried over
them: On other parts <HI>Bucephalus,</HI> or if that please not, some <HI>Per∣sian</HI>
Steed priding himself to carry an Emperor, or some Demi-god.
Because neither <HI>Quintus Curtius,</HI> nor after him <HI>Plutarch,</HI> mention
the reedifying this Palace either by <HI>Alexander</HI> or any of his Cap∣tains,
yet I cannot let it pass without this Remark, That they are
habited more like the Ancient <HI>Grecians,</HI> than <HI>Persians</HI> now are; be∣sides,
the Hair of their Heads is hanging down, and not tied up,
which is different from the Modern Fashion of this Country.</P>
<P>In this Apartment Eight Doors seem to answer each other, Two
on each side of every Square; which Conformity is attended with
extraordinary Elegance and Workmanship; the Roof seems never to
have had any intervening Pillars, and whether the Beams were of
Cedar, it is not so fortunate as to have a Voucher of its own Nation.
Many other Parts declared Cost and Pains enough, but nothing
more worthy Study than the Characters fairly impressed and engra∣ven,
which would unfold the Truth of the Founders of this Build∣ing,
were they as Intelligible as Legible; for they remain like the
Hand-writing on the Wall (<HI>Mene Tekel</HI>), till some Divine Expo∣sitor
interpret them; yet I must needs say, many of the Characters
may be found in the <HI>Greek</HI> Alphabet.</P>
<P>This vast Fabrick is made bigger, by being joined to a great
Mountain, out of whose Entrails were worn, rather than digged,
Noble Caverns with Stately Sculptures, and wide Ponds of living
Water constantly distilling from the Marble Rocks, either for bath∣ing
or necessary uses: It is an admirable Piece, overlooking all the
Plain, where we took this day's Repast, and over Head saw the
Cornish of the Frontispiece embellished with the Royal Arms of the
<HI>Persian</HI> Emperor, immediately on the Union of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per∣sians</HI>
into one Empire, which was a Ram's Head delineated as far as
the Chest.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon we saw another of the same Make,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Ram's-head the Arms of <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE> answering
the other part of the Palace, and underneath on the Plain took no∣tice
of Two Pillars at a fit distance, the one for the Goal, and the
other for the Starting-place of their Coursers when they run Races.
Having thus finished our Perambulation, we descended on the con∣trary
<PB N="253" REF="146"/>
side we came up, and found there Goats and Sheep grazing on
the Grass between the Joints of the Pavements; but on the Walls of
the Staircase (which consisted of an Hundred and twenty Stairs of
Black Marble on each side, till they united to Forty more, which de∣livered
us to the Plain) were the Portraictures both of Men and
Beasts on each side, and more of this Ancient Writing distinct in
large Panes; at the Bottom whereof our Horses waiting us, we
mounted, and returned to <HI>Meergoscoon,</HI> not a full <HI>Pharsang</HI> from
hence.</P>
<P>The following Day drove us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rustam</HI> a Prince of the <HI>Gaurs.</HI></NOTE> out of the same Curiosity, over se∣veral
Branches of <HI>Bindamire</HI> River, to enquire for other Structures
of the like Nature, of which these Mountains afford plenty, bating
the great Area of <HI>Persepolis,</HI> which distinguishes it from these; but
we did not alight for these, satisfying our selves to stare on them
from beneath, they being fit only for <HI>Atlasses,</HI> or for Winged Folk
to look into, there being no passage to them, appearing like Dens or
open Holes on the sides of the Rocks, from their very Mouths per∣pendicular
to the Ground: Only one above the rest attracted our
Sight and Animadversion, reported and still averred to be of old
the Court of <HI>Rustam,</HI> an Ancient King of the <HI>Gaurs</HI> or <HI>Gabers</HI> (the
true Original <HI>Persian</HI> Race), whose Statue was of a Gigantine Sta∣ture,
on as large a sized Horse, triumphing over his Foes at the Front
of his Cave, with many Attendants clad down to the Heels, with
Caps on their Heads (not Turbats) and their Hair loose about
their Shoulders.</P>
<P>From whence observing frequent Numbers of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncertain whether it be <HI>Persepolis.</HI></NOTE> I was apt to
collect, that even what goes now for the <HI>Persepolis</HI> which <HI>Alexander</HI>
gave leave in a Drunken Fit to be set on Fire at the Request of the
Costly <HI>Thais,</HI> may be the Ruins of some Heathen Temple, having
seen of the same Recesses among the Idolatrous <HI>Indians,</HI> which they
still pay Adoration to, and own to be the Temples of their Gods.</P>
<P>But that that City might stand in this Plain, not only the recei∣ved
Tradition among all <HI>European</HI> Travellers, but the concurrent
Opinion of undoubted Historians, certify with all the probable Con∣jectures.</P>
<P>From hence under these high Hills we kept our Course, proving it
to be a Wealthy Plain, stored with all Cattel, Corn, and Wild Fowl,
by the plentiful Afflux of Water to the River from the Mountains,
and Cuts from the River into the Plain, whereby it might be a fit
Situation for the mighty <HI>Persepolis,</HI> as it now is for store of Country
Towns, besides whole Armies of <HI>Nomades,</HI> or wandring Shepherds,
who pitch their Tents with all their Families, wherever they find a
Soil suitable to their Employment. Not far from whom were mul∣titudes
of such Tombs as we met with at <HI>Bonaru</HI> Level, which perhaps
may give some surer Account than that more Romantick one in ap∣pearance
we met with there, of their being the dying Trophies of
former Battels; though here wants not matter to countenance such
Tales to those of easy Faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Straits where <HI>Artiba∣zanes</HI> repulsed <HI>Alexander.</HI></NOTE> For two Mountains shut up this hap∣py
Campaign so, as if Nature had taken special Care of its Security;
which as formerly they terminated the Territories of the contending
<HI>Gaurs,</HI> by their opposite Position, that nothing could creep between
<PB N="254" REF="147"/>
them unexamined, so it is not unlikely that these were the Strong∣holds
<HI>Artibazanes</HI> defended against <HI>Alexander,</HI> when he repulsed
him, and had put a Stop to the Torrent of his Victories, had not a
<HI>Persian</HI> Rustick shewed him an unknown Passage by the <HI>Pylae Per∣sicae,</HI>
or Postern-Gates on the back of these Mountains, which open∣ed
a Way to his farther Progress, as well as to the ravishing this
thus basely betray'd Country to the Lawless Rape of an ungovern'd
Ambition. To conclude therefore from hence, That these Burial-Places
took their beginning so long ago, as it would savour of small
Judgment in the Affirmative, yet it may leave some ground to the
credulous, that it is possible some as notable Fights might succeed,
for the gaining such a Key to so Rich and Spacious a Valley, as well
from time to time after <HI>Alexander,</HI> as that not a Century since, this
Part remained almost unsubdued, till <HI>Shaw Abas</HI> the Great brought
it to perfect Obedience, when there might be occasion for such In∣terments,
if their Piety extended to such a Care of the Dead.</P>
<P>But these Field-Inhabitants incline me to think it their Work, being
far from any Town; though the common Fame give it to the other
Report, as well to aggrandize their foregoing Ancestry, as to cast a
Lustre on the present Posterity. This may serve also to prove their
<HI>Scythian</HI> Antiquity; for as the Worthy Mr. <HI>Sheringham</HI> observes,
<HI>Sacae opiliones Asiam incolentes;</HI> that the <HI>Sacae</HI> were wandring Shep∣herds;
whose Names, to shew their Original, he derives from the
<HI>Hebrew</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. <HI>Tabernaculum,</HI> or Tent in <HI>English;</HI> from whence
came the <HI>Getae,</HI> as well as present <HI>Persians,</HI> from their frequent dis∣burthening
themselves by Colonies dispersed both into <HI>Scythia,</HI> so to
<HI>Europe</HI> as well as <HI>Asia,</HI> where they first inhabited.</P>
<P>From <HI>Meergoscoon</HI> to this Strait is measured Twenty Mile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maijm.</NOTE> which
finishes not this Stage, for now we were encompassed again with
Rocks and Stones among the Mountains, (which we know whose In∣stigation
it was to command they should be made Bread), our Provi∣sions
being spent which we had taken for this Deviation; wherefore
we were forced to march Twenty Miles farther, to <HI>Maijm,</HI> before
either we or our Cattel baited; where we arriv'd before our <HI>Capha∣la</HI>
we had left at <HI>Siras,</HI> they pretending they had lost their Way, but
more truly lingred, not having us to spur them on; wherefore we
were obliged this Night to make the Earth our Lodging, our Arms
our Bolsters, and the uneven Stones our Feather-beds; which though
we Travellers often do in this Journey out of choise, yet we found
it disagreeable, because the Nights now were as intensely Cold, as
the Days were Hot. In the Forenoon to the next Day the <HI>Caphala</HI>
came, which created us this Day's Stay at <HI>Maijm,</HI> a Town where
grows the best Walnuts, of the same bigness with the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and
the choicest Tobacco <HI>Persia</HI> affords.</P>
<P>After a sweet Night's Repose, early in the Morn between the
Straits of the Mountains, we traced the Source of the River <HI>Araxes,</HI>
purling under slippery Pebbles, which no sooner removed, than the
Crystal Water bubbles forth, by which means, though a little sup∣pressed
at first, in Half a Mile's space it emits a Stream able to drive
Three Mills, which notwithstanding were not forcible enough to
restrain the impetuous Blasts of Heat pent in between the Hills:
<PB N="255" REF="147"/>
Although on the other side when we approached in the Night, all
the Cloaths we had wrapped about us, could hardly preserve the in∣nate
Warmth, when the Sun had shrowded its self under the Horizon.</P>
<P>At Noon-day we overcame an high Mountain after a troublesome
Luctation, this delivering us to another Golden Plain of <HI>Ojoan,</HI>
gilded over with Ripe Wheat, being no more than Five Miles from
<HI>Maijm.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Ojoan</HI> glories in the Sepulchre of another Royal Prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ojoan.</NOTE> which
is well endowed with neat Dwellings and Orchards for the <HI>Mullahs,</HI>
who take their Service by turns to officiate in their Priesthood, by
loud Exclamations and Musick calling People to their Devotions: In
this Mansion we were permitted to make our Abode this Day;
which because it was so short a <HI>Munsel,</HI> and these Gardens so de∣lightful,
I could not but give my self the Pleasure to reflect as well on
those Plants we had met wild, as these more cultivated which grew
here.</P>
<P>The Bitter Almond-Tree we met formerly in the Highways
wild, if it may be called a Tree, and not a Shrub; the Body resem∣bles
an Hasle, but slenderer, from whence come Stalks like Broom,
on which sprout Leafs synonimous to our Privet; it brings forth
Fruit in <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April,</HI> and delights in Hot and Barren Countries.</P>
<P>The Sweet Almond grows on a taller Tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sweet Almond.</NOTE> whose Leafs are like
Ash, and ripen about the same time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pistacia</HI> sends forth its Branches on high,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pistacia</HI> Nut.</NOTE> and renders its Nuts
edible in <HI>Autumn,</HI> whose Leafs are as big as a Walnut's, covered un∣derneath
with a soft Grey Down; all these are covered with a succu∣lent
Green Shell like a Walnut without, which includes an harder
within, in the Shape and Substance we have them brought: Though
I find them differently described both by <HI>Gerard</HI> and <HI>Lobelius.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Capper</HI>-Shrub accompanies us in the Valleys from <HI>Caifer</HI> hi∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Capper</HI> Shrub.</NOTE>
and is encompass'd with Prickles something emulating our
Goosberries; the Leaf is shaped like Purslain; the Seeds or Fruit,
which we call <HI>Cappers,</HI> have a Cod not different from the Cod of the
<HI>Major Cardamom,</HI> in which they are inclosed: In <HI>May</HI> the Flower is
white and open, like a Sweet-Briar's.</P>
<P>The lofty Pine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pine.</NOTE> the Top of the Woods, as well as of those float∣ing
on the Main, is not so Tall in <HI>Asia</HI> as in <HI>Europe,</HI> though strait
up to the very Top, and is not bunched till the Boughs aloft thrust
out the Leafs to embrace the Woody Substance of its Cone-like Ap∣ple;
the Body is scaled like the Palm-Tree.</P>
<P>The Peach by way of Excellence is termed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peach.</NOTE> <HI>The Persian Apple;</HI>
nor does it lessen the Repute, it far exceeding here what can be said

<P>Early the next Morning we departed from <HI>Ojoan,</HI> beginning to
alter our Course, the Air being more moderate, crossing a River
(by a Bridge) running the whole length of the Plain, in whose
Bosom great store of Corn was nourished, it looking yellow, and fit
for the Sickle: On the other hand, in the Meadows and Marshes
<PB N="256" REF="148"/>
were Droves of Fat Cattle, and all things appeared with the same
Face as in <HI>England;</HI> we enjoyed this Accommodation till we came to
<HI>Asspass,</HI> four <HI>Pharsangs;</HI> it is a Village shelter'd by the Mountains
on the <HI>North,</HI> from whence spring many Rivulets of Fountain-Water,
dispersed among the Under-Grounds a little too much; by
whose Exuberance, Flags, Reeds, and Osiers offer Covert to Wild
Boars, and Habitation to some Water-Fowl.</P>
<P>Here a Countryman of ours is remembred to be Governor of a
Castle (whose Ruins still are extant) for <HI>Shaw Abas</HI> the Great,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Asspass</HI> once governed by an <HI>Englishman.</HI></NOTE> in
the beginning of King <HI>James</HI> the First's Reign; <HI>viz.</HI> Sir <HI>Anthony
Shirley,</HI> who took Pay under the Emperor to defend this Pass: It is
now inhabited by <HI>Georgian</HI> Christians, who are Tillers of the Ground
and Planters of Vines, which are very productive on the sides of
the Hills: They are Whiter than the present <HI>Persians,</HI> and of a flo∣rid
Complexion, being Portly well-limb'd Fellows: Many of them
have embraced the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith after the <HI>Persian</HI> Sect, being
Vassals to the Emperor.</P>
<P>By the favour of the rising Moon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuscuzar.</NOTE> <HI>August</HI> the first, we brought
the highest part of another Mountain under our Feet, it dividing
this Plain from another Rich Valley cloathed with Green Grass, and
therefore dedicated to the Pasture of the King's Breed of Horses,
among which were Choice Ones of very great Value: We passed
two <HI>Pharsangs</HI> to <HI>Cuscuzar,</HI> giving both Name to the Valley and
Village: Here is a small but delicate <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI> though some∣thing
improvidently built, the Upper Part being too heavy for the
Foundation, it being paved with large Square Stone over the Cloy∣sters,
which already begin to press down the Walls, which are most
elegantly adorned with Painted Bricks and Polished Marble, both
too weak for so great a Weight.</P>
<P>As we strove early the next Morning to reach the end of the
Plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moun∣tains capped with Snow.</NOTE> being Thirty Miles, and very wide withal, our shivering
Joints made us as sensible of Cold, as if the Frozen Bear had hung
over our Heads: Nor must we wonder, since the Air is rarified, being
soiled by no Lake, River, or Standing Pools, nor near any Sea or
Gulph for some Hundreds of Miles; and to this Thinness of the
Air another Reason is joined, the Mountain-Tops around this Plain
all the Year long are capped with Snow; from whose Ribs the Sun
dissolving them, is the only occasion of watering this Valley, where
no other Supply can be had, or not so frequent as this; and his
hottest Rays are not powerful enough (as 'tis credibly reported by
all, though my Eyes I must confess were too short-sighted to inform
me, the Summer being far spent, and this more extremely hot than
usual), to melt all that fell in the Winter-Season; to which I ap∣pearing
unbelieving, there was present a poor Rustick, who for a
small Reward proffered to bring me a Piece to convince me; but
having seen it nearer the Port, I did not think it impossible.</P>
<P>We kept on to <HI>Degurdu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Degurdu.</NOTE> signifying the Walnut Town, where
grew never an one, and lodged our selves here before Noon, the
Sun not in the least annoying us.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="148"/>
The Day after we Marched Two and Thirty Miles to <HI>Esduchos:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. V.</NOTE>
But before we exchanged <HI>Degurdu</HI> for this place, we accosted a Black
Marble Mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Ditch at <HI>Esducho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> parts <HI>Persia</HI> from <HI>Parthia.</HI></NOTE> worn as smooth as Glass, and as slippery as Ice,
by the constant footing of all sorts of Animals, so that we slode
step by step, as our Horses do in deep Way, with this only advan∣tage,
that we had sound Bottom: Beneath this a small Plain led us
to the brink of a vast Precipice, the utmost Limits of <HI>Pharsestan,</HI> or
the Old <HI>Persian</HI> Realm; here a deep broad Ditch, through which a
troubled muddy Rivulet runs under a Stone Bridge, (the whole being
not Broader than our <HI>Thamesis</HI>) parts this Country from <HI>Parthia:</HI>
We remained this Night on the <HI>Persian</HI> side, in a Magnificent Brick
<HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI> Built on the descent into the Trench, which <HI>West∣ward</HI>
on the dry Banks was stored with fine Gardens and fruitful Or∣chards;
over which on the other side was truly verified what might
be Fabulously delivered of <HI>Semiramis</HI>'s Pendulous Gardens and Sum∣mer-Houses,
there being Tenements made over this Moat out of
the ancient Fortifications, barring the <HI>Persian</HI> Incroachments on
their Confines, whose Mouldring Sands have left the jetting Rocks
the bare supporters of these hanging Buildings. The finest Wheat
of all the Emperor's Dominions is of the growth of this Soil, the
Bread whereof is in highest Esteem.</P>

is Foreign.</P>
<P>These Dirt-Forts might lie buried in silence, were it not for
the worthy Memory of the Person who first undertook to de∣molish
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tragical fall of <HI>Imaum Cooly Caun.</HI></NOTE> thereby expressing his Faith and Loyalty to his

<P>For the Renowned <HI>Shaw Abas</HI> being placed in his Throne by the

opposite Factions of Court and Empire, he could not be reckoned
to sit firm on his Throne, so long as these Impediments remained in
the Hands of either Friend or Foe, because that they not only en∣abled
the Possessors to stand on Terms with the Emperor, but were
a sure Refuge, not only to Villains and Traitors, but to Thieves and
Robbers, as well as Fugitives that fled from the hands of Justice;
<PB N="258" REF="149"/>
whereby they became at once an Obstacle to Trade, Preying
on the Subjects at their own pleasure, and became Lurking places,
as well as Sanctuaries, to the King's Enemies, bidding Defiance,
and many times opposing the Forces of the Empire.</P>
<P>To Suppress which Insolencies, and Revenge himself on Offended
Majesty, none under the Imperial Banners appeared a more vigorous
Chastiser than this General, behaving himself with that Prowess,
that he overthrew the Nests of Robbers, released the People from
their Fears, and restored an entire Tranquility to the Monarchy:
For which mighty Deeds he received a Reward altogether Injurious
and Undeserved; for at his return to Court, being Courteously re∣ceived
with all the Marks of Favour and Royal Complements, his
Jealous Master Invited him far from the City into the Woods to
Hunt, remote from the Army, whose Life and Delight he was,
the better hereby to Intrap him, not being able otherwise to per∣form
his Design; but even here, when he was Seized by the Com∣mand
of the Emperor, he was proffered his Escape by his Keepers,
which he refused, knowing his Innocence; but this served to enrage
<HI>Shaw Abas</HI> the more, so that he could not be quiet till he had the
Death of this Great Man; who fell for no other Cause, than Vir∣tue
emulated and envied by his Lord, he being too much the Peo∣ple's

a Convenient Room, formerly designed for a Coffee-House, having
a Tank of Water in the middle, with broad Seats around, either to
Lie or Sit on.</P>
<P>Here among the Tombs I took notice of several Figures on the
Grave-Stones; which, because repugnant to the Command of their
Prophet, I had a mind to be informed the meaning of, which they
told me was only to express the several Ages of the Departed; as
one that Died in the strength of his Age (speaking of whom, they
term King of the World) had a Lion Deciphered on his Grave-Stone;
many of which I found in sundry places; whereby I am
confirmed, that Representations, or Emblems, were not wholly
abdicated by the <HI>Persians;</HI> which I suppose also to be a Relick of
their <HI>Scythian</HI> Extract, what Power, notwithstanding Religion since
introduced, may have over their Consciences, yet this shews their
natural Inclination to their Primitive Custom; for <HI>Getae siquidem

Twenty four Miles more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Come Shaw.</NOTE> which was a Town of <HI>Caravan Ser

to take up this Summer time, desiring more Air; and for that
purpose chose the <HI>Mausolaeum</HI> of another Prophet of theirs, <HI>Shaw Rezin,</HI>
in the middle of a great Grove of Elms.</P>
<P>Under these ran a purling Brook,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Supersti∣tion of the <HI>Persians.</HI></NOTE> which fed a Sacred Fishpond full
of Fish Dedicated to this Tomb, as appears by their Noses and Finns
being hung with Gold Rings; with which odd, and doubtless to
them unvalued Adornment, they Swam up and down in the clear
Water, and tamely would visit all Comers, for Meat; besides these,
here were Ducks devoted to as soppish a Maintenance; which no
one dare meddle with under pain of Excommunication and dread∣ful

<P>As we drew nigher <HI>Spahaun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dovecots for Salt-Petre.</NOTE> the Dovecots were more thick and
more stately, they being covered over with a white Plaister, and
neater than those we first saw: Of such concern is it to the King to
preserve these.</P>
<P>The next Day brought us to <HI>Mayar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mayar.</NOTE> Twenty Miles farther, (ano∣ther
Town of Country Caravans) through Gravelly, Unfruitful,
but Plain way, and good to Travel.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirge.</NOTE> we went to <HI>Mirge,</HI> Eight Miles more,
to an old lonely Inn, where was the last place we rusticated. The
Morning following being met by the Citizens of <HI>Spahaun</HI> beyond
the <HI>Ʋrchin</HI> Hills, Three Miles from <HI>Mirge,</HI> who Congratulating our
Arrival, spread in the Highway a noble Table on Carpets furnished
with the Delicacies of this Country, which is enough to commend
it both for Cold Treat, Fruit, and Wine.</P>
<P>After we had received their Complements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Met by the Citizens.</NOTE> they undertook to be
both our Guide and Guard to <HI>Ispahaun,</HI> Three Miles farther, defend∣ing
us against the unwary Insults of Thieves, with which this place
is infested; being a fit place for Robbery among the undiscovered
Mazes of the Mountains, especially while the Emperor is Resident
with his Army; who living beyond their Pay, are often attempting
to maintain their Luxury by such unlawful Enterprises.</P>
<P>From this Avenue we had a fair Prospect of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Prospect of <HI>Ispahaun.</HI></NOTE> filling the
one half of an ample Plain, few Buildings, (besides the High Towers
of the Mosques and Palace Gates) shewing themselves, by reason of
the high <HI>Chinors,</HI> or Sicamores shading the choicest of them; yet
the Hills begin to keep a more decent distance, and we passed part
of a spacious Field before we Saluted the City; into which we en∣tred
by Two fair Rows of Elms, on each hand one, planted by the
sides of the Chrystal Streams, reaching a long way through a
broad Street, whose Paved Cawseys Conducted us to the River;
<Q><L>Sic Angustiis à nobis devictis
ad Augusta ferimur.</L></Q>
<PB N="260" REF="150"/>
Which River was Fifty Ells wide, but not Navigable; this Summers
drought having made it Fordable in many places, especially now
the Emperor fills this place with his Court and confluence of Mili∣tary
Men; the great Commanders and Ministers of State diverting
the Channel to their own private Commodity, and for want of this
Years Rains, it is hardly sufficient, (they Watering their Gardens
therewith) by reason of which unkindly Nurture, both the Beauty
and Goodness of the Fruit and Trees do Flag this Autumn.</P>
<P>Here at the Foot of the Bridge waited to bid us Welcome the
<HI>Jelfeline</HI> Christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Stately Bridge.</NOTE> with the several <HI>Europe</HI> Residents, as <HI>Dutch,
French, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Russian,</HI> with their respective Trains, Trum∣peters
with their Ensigns, and Led Horses richly Trapped, with
<HI>Shotters</HI> and Pages, besides those of our own, appearing in their
greatest Glory; thus Attended we were brought over a most Mag∣nificent
Bridge with Arches over our Heads, and on both sides Rails
and Galleries to view the River, the Cloysters whereof were Paved
with broad Marble, in which were several Niches and open Portals;
the upper part was all Brick, the Foundations Black Marble with
gradations to the bottom.</P>
<P>Which led us to a stately large Street,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Covered <HI>Buzzars.</HI></NOTE> continued on the other side
with equal Gallantry of Buildings and Trees, till we were carried under
their Lofty-Ceiled and Stately-Erected <HI>Buzzars;</HI> these Edifices run∣ing
into all the busy parts of the City in an almost-joined Stack of
Structures, (sometimes directly, other times interfereing) not
much unlike our <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> with Shops on either Hand, just
like them, which is, I confess, the surprizingest piece of Greatness in
Honour of Commerce the whole World can boast of, our <HI>Burses</HI> be∣ing
but Snaps of Buildings to these famous <HI>Buzzars.</HI></P>
<P>Yet to let you know I am not so foppish an Admirer of Foreign
Splendour, as to forget to give the due Reverence to my own Nation;
they, as they exceed any thing of that kind with us, the extremity
of Heat and Cold which this Country is subject to, obliging them
to this Contrivance, for their Customers sake as well as their own,
to defend them from the Injury of the Weather; so it would be
vain in our Countrymen to attempt it, who enjoy better Houses
than these dare seem to Erect; and have a Warehouse in every
Shop, when these, at best, have no more to shew than their Stalls,
however specious Fabricks they are shrowded under; admitting
Lights by Lanthorns a-top, or open Holes, not on the sides, the
better to Illustrate their Goods, and cast False Lights on them.</P>
<P>Through these we were directed to the <HI>Midan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Midan,</HI> or <HI>Hypodrome.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Hypodrome,</HI> an
Oblong Square Court, where the Horses are Exercised before the

possesses the highest end, on whose left hand runs the Front of

on Duty, over which is the Imperial Throne, all Covered with
Gold:

From whence the Emperor beholds the Combats between Lions and
Bulls, or <HI>Persian</HI> Rams set to run at one another; the Tournaments
of the Nobles Tilting at each other, or on Coursers full Speed, stri∣ving
to Shoot backward with Bow and Arrow, (after the <HI>Parthian</HI>
Custom) at a Golden Bowl fixed on an high Pole, which who Hits by

the Prize away, and is taken notice of as a Candidate for the

<P>At the lower end the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> or <HI>Queshery,</HI> (filled with
Plate and Jewels, like our <HI>Lombardstreet</HI>) opens its folding Doors,
over whose rising Porch, in stately Turrets, the King's Musick
alternately resound and compleat this Noble Square, whose Court is
so large, except on such Days as these, as to make room enough for a
great Fair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Exchange</HI> and <HI>English</HI> House.</NOTE> Through this <HI>Queshery</HI> we passed under many Fine
<HI>Buzzars,</HI> till we came to our own Palace, which was a noble one,
both <HI>Siras</HI> and this being the King's Bounty; nor are these mean, being
as high as any bestowed, under the Blood-Royal; the Porches shining
with Gilded Foliages, Architrave and Marble Pillars, as all the Pa∣laces
of their Nobles do; here being resigned we returned Thanks
with the best Entertainment this City could afford, before our Friends
departed.</P>
<P>Thus we accomplish'd, on the Seventh of <HI>August,</HI> a tedious
Journy in the hottest Season of the Year, over desolate parching
Sands, and naked Rocks, through all <HI>Persia</HI> into the heart of <HI>Par∣thia</HI>
to <HI>Ispahaun,</HI> not only the Chief City of this vast Empire, where
the present Emperor sets up his Standard, with all his moving
Forces, but of <HI>Parthia</HI> especially; in which Itinerary the Moun∣tains
never forsook us, nor for the greatest part met we with other Wa∣ter
than what was Impure and Filthy, being devoid of the shelter
of thick Woods, or Forests to shade us from the fultriness of the
Sun; which was the worst inconvenience that pursued us till within
a few Days Journy of this City; which though it appear a large
Wood spread over the Plain by reason of the abundance of Orchards
and Gardens, yet it wants more on that account than any other,
(sending at least Twelve Days Journy for their Fuel, which is
dearer than Victuals) and is Built with Brick and Mud for lack of
Timber.</P>
<P>To the Store of Provisions we carried with us, we never
failed of a supply in some part where-ever we came; and for
Deer, Antilope, Wild Goat, and Sheep of the Mountains, most

places made us Presents of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter V.</NOTE> which with Young Kids is not only

<P>We were not long here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pillar of Skulls.</NOTE> but we must return the Civilities of those
who had honoured us with their Company; when riding through
the Town, we lighted on an huge stupendious Pillar, composed of
the Skulls of all sorts of Creatures, occasioned by an Oath of <HI>Shaw
Abas</HI> the Great (of whom they hardly speak without Idolizing his
Memory, his Name being invoked when any Commendable or Fa∣mous
Action is performed; saying, <HI>Shaw Abas,</HI> or <HI>Shabas,</HI> as we are
wont to say, <HI>Well done;</HI>) for that the Great Men of this Place stand∣ing
out against his then unsettled Authority, he vowed, That if they
persisted to dispute, he would rear a vast Column of their Heads, to
the eternal Reproach of their Disobedience; who after some small
Capitulation, surrendred upon discretion, considering his implacable
Revenge to the Obstinate, and his Natural Propensity to Clemency
towards the Submissive; which was not effected so soon, but that
he was forced to make use of an Equivocation to salve his Oath,
commanding every one of them to bring a decollated Head of some
Beast, and lay at his Feet, which accordingly they did; and he pla∣ced
them into an entire <HI>Coloss,</HI> as a Monument of Obloquy to their
Indifferency, and an everlasting Trophy of his subduing them.
It is more than Sixty Feet in height, with a proportionable Circum∣ference
enlarged about the Basis, which we could not measure, by
reason of Market-Sheds built about it.</P>
<P>Here by the King's Permission are not only allowed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Romish</HI> Friars.</NOTE> but nourished
from the King's Table, all the Begging Friars of the <HI>Romish</HI> Order,
with a small Annuity to maintain them in a Pious Manner of Life;
this same <HI>Shaw Abas</HI> bestowing on them pretty Dwellings for Con∣vents,
with Orchards and Gardens, which they cultivate with their
own Hands, live meanly, and up to the Rules of the Poverty prescri∣bed
them; gaining for that reason a Reputation and Reverence not
only from the Emperor, but the well inclined Subjects; who often
by the King's Example send them Meat, Bread, and other Provisi∣ons
for their Sustenance, and pay them a Respect equal to their own
Devotes: And I must needs confess some of them are not only Holy
Men, but Discreet and Learned, the Chief of whom is Father <HI>Ra∣phael,</HI>
a Capuchin, who has lived exemplary among them many
Years, and is well acquainted with the Country, from whom I must
own I received the best and most Authentick Information: And this
I speak knowingly of him, That he is no Intruder on Mens Princi∣ples,
when about to depart this Life, as most of them are, but re∣commends
them to God with their own Conscience.</P>
<P>These walk humbly about the Streets and Markets, discalceated,
and in their distinct Habits, none of them mounting an Horse on∣ly

<P>Having undergone the Pompous Fatigues of Saluting, and being
thereby taught the Formalities of Compliments, more than truly
acquainted with the Current of Affairs here; I found it true, That
an exalted Pitch of State is more tiresome than a meaner Condition,
it being only a more conspicuous Confinement; for not to move
abroad without a Retinue, is to have a Supervisor to every Motion,
and a Man is less free either to observe or act: Wherefore being
tutored before-hand what a Disrepute it was to the Nation whose
Title we bore, to appear to its Disgrace, I resolved to avoid that In∣decency,
and change my <HI>European</HI> Cloaths for a <HI>Persian</HI> Vest and
Turbat, that I might walk about undiscovered, without any Re∣flection
to the Publick Minister of my Country, and give my Eyes
that Satisfaction my Ears were not capable of receiving; by which
Expedient my View was less transient, and I had time to dwell lon∣ger
on any Object.</P>
<P>The first whereof that attracted my Stay,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jews</HI> are Drug∣gists.</NOTE> was to examine the
Druggists, whom I found to be all <HI>Jews,</HI> who are very numerous,
and live apart, though their Shops are in common with the Natives
in the <HI>Buzzars,</HI> mixed among a Crowd of other Tradesmen; who
sell by Retail, and pass without any Brand, having their Synagogues
open every Sabbath day. These are the greatest Brokers, and as
cunning, if not exceeding the <HI>Banyans,</HI> who also are in every Cor∣ner,
lurking to make a Prize.</P>
<P>The Fruiterers place themselves at the Entry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruiterers.</NOTE> and in the wide open
Places under the Chief Cupuloes of their <HI>Buzzars,</HI> vending, besides
Fruit, Sherbets of Pomgranats, Prunellaes, Limes and Oranges,
with Ice and Snow to cool them. Ice dissolved in their Liquors, is
as prevalent here as at <HI>Siras,</HI> so that the Poor, have they but a Penny
in the World, the one half will go for Bread, and dried Grapes, or
Butter-milk, and the other for Snow and Tobacco.</P>
<P>Besides these common <HI>Buzzars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Silk <HI>Buzzars.</HI></NOTE> there are others set apart for choice

with Gold and Silver very costly, which are the peculiar Ma∣nufacture
of the Country: In these we meet with Merchants of all

who furnish this City with all Foreign Wares, and in exchange car∣ry

the mix'd Concourse of other Merchants from all Parts it is, that the
Commodities of all the Earth are seen in distinct <HI>Buzzars</HI> in this one
City, as cheap as in their separate Homes. For beholding the Sack-cloth
<HI>Buzzar,</HI> for so they call <HI>English</HI> Cloth, I thought it exceeded
<HI>Blackwell</HI>-Hall, or any Cloth-Fair in <HI>England,</HI> being piled in huge
Quantities both in their Shops around the <HI>Buzzar,</HI> and Heaps amidst
thereof, of all Sorts, Colours, and Conditions; where I bought a
Coat of Broad-Cloth to line with Furrs against the Winter, for
Fourteen Shillings the <HI>Cobit,</HI> almost equal with our Yard, for what
I am sure I have paid Twenty Shillings the Yard at home.</P>
<P>Whereby it was easy to guess,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>English</HI> Cloth and Tin come to a Bad Mar∣ket.</NOTE> that the Company's Broad-Cloth
came to a Bad Market, the Merchants bringing it in Truck for their
Goods cheaper from the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> than the Company could
send it, of which at present there is a great Glut: Nor will their
Tin fare much better, for that <HI>Tuthinage</HI> brought from the <HI>South</HI>-Seas
answers in all respects, if not surpasses the finest of that Metal.</P>
<P>From hence I went to the <HI>Caravan Ser Raws,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Caravans</HI> of the City.</NOTE> stately huge Fabricks
of Brick and Stone, bigger than our Inns of Court, but far more
uniform, being Three or Four Stories high, with Walks and Galleries;
every Country has a separate one, where they lodge whole <HI>Caphalaes</HI>
for Sale of <HI>Indian</HI> Cloth, <HI>Turkish, Arabian, European,</HI> and all manner
of Goods from the Four Quarters of the Universe. Here they Rent
the Warehouses and Apartments, not Let them out at free-cost, as up∣on
the Roads: The King and Queen, as they have built Royal Ones,
receive from them a great Annuity: Some of these <HI>Caravan Ser Raws</HI>
with their Goods and Chapmen, resemble most our <HI>Leadenhall</HI> Mar∣ket
and Market-house (not for the Shambles there, which is be∣yond
any other, but) for Hides and Leather from <HI>Bulgaria, Turky,</HI>
and of their own dressing, which excels that we call <HI>Spanish,</HI> or the
best Cordevan for Fineness, and Shagreen for Durableness; for Bri∣dles,
Harnesses, Boots, and Shooes, here are beyond compare.</P>
<P>The next great Buildings are the <HI>Balneos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Balneos.</NOTE> to which they go with
as much Devotion as to their Temples, not permitting any Hetero∣dox
to their Opinion, to Bathe with them.</P>
<P>Their Coffee-houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coffee-houses.</NOTE> as they are more publick, are fine Rooms,
shining with Lamps in all their <HI>Buzzars.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can we forget another sort of Black Traders, burning Light
at Noon day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Necroman∣cers.</NOTE> which are the Necromancers, whose Shops are bestuck
with Candles lighted in every Hole, who pretend to unravel the
Secrets of Nature, to discover Things lost, help the foolishly-inqui∣sitive

command Fate, and prophesy all things to wheedle their Admirers;
which is so general, that they have Proselytes of all Qualities and

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Carries us to Jelfa; where is treated of the Gabers, or Original
Persians, the Armenians, Georgians, and Europe Artisans.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Interim therefore I shall attend the Agent to <HI>Jelfa,</HI> the
Abode of the <HI>Armenian</HI> Christians, from whence they receive
the Name of <HI>Jelfalines:</HI> We pass to this City through two or three
of the Palace-Yards, by a great Gate that brought us to a long Walk
planted on both sides with high Sycamors, aspiring like the lofty
Cedar, whose Roots are washed with two Streams all the length of it.
In the middle is a neat Bridge, built more politely than the other
(though the Water has long since forsook the Channel): Leaving
the Bridge on the left, we cross the old bottom of the River to the
Town, situate in the same manner <HI>Southwark</HI> is from <HI>London.</HI> Here
inhabit not only <HI>Armenians,</HI> but the Ancient <HI>Gabers,</HI> who remain
here with their Tribes; with some Mechanick <HI>French</HI> (as Jewellers,
Gunsmiths, and Watchmakers); and some few <HI>Musslemen,</HI> as Spies
rather than Inmates.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Armenian</HI> Christians here are more than Six thousand
Families,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6000 Families of <HI>Armenians</HI> in <HI>Jelfa.</HI></NOTE> besides an innumerable Company of dispersed Husband∣men
in the Villages, following their Patriarch in the same Faith.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are all <HI>Calvinists.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gabers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gabers</HI> the Old <HI>Persi∣ans.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Gaures,</HI> are the true <HI>Persian</HI> Race, the undoubted
Heirs both of their <HI>Gentilism</HI> and Succession, attributing Divine
Honour to the Fire, maintaining it always alive in their <HI>Delubriums,</HI>
or Places set apart for their Worship; and if by Chance they should
let it go out, they must take a Pilgrimage to <HI>Carmania;</HI> where their
most Sacred Fire was never extinguished, as if it were a Piacular
Wickedness to attempt the renewing of it elsewhere, that being
preserved by a more than Vestal Care, from the first time the Sun,
their Chief Deity, was pleased to enlighten it with Sparks from its
own Rays.</P>
<P>The Men and Women are clad with long Vests and Breeches to
their Heels, the Hair of the Men appearing under their Caps or
Bonnets; the Women have a long Mantle, and are bound about the
Head with an Hair-lace, like the Description <HI>Curtius</HI> gives of those
conquered after the Ruin of <HI>Persepolis,</HI> who bound their Heads with
the Slings they used to slay the Venison they fed on, straggling on
the Mountains, and kept in Dens and Caverns of the Earth, which
made it a matter of great difficulty to overcome them.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="153"/>
These seem to me the most lively Representations of the Figures
both on the Rocks, and on the Palace it self at <HI>Persepolis:</HI> These
are Instances how momentary the Grandeur of this World is:
These, once the Lords of all the Earth that the Ocean washes on
this Side, and the <HI>Hellespont</HI> shuts in on the other, forgetful of the
Everlasting Name of the <HI>Grand Cyrus,</HI> who first subjugated the
<HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Assyrians</HI> under the <HI>Persian</HI> Yoak, and established the
Seat of the Empire among their Renowned Ancestry: These, un∣happy
for their Sloth and Cowardise, are the reproachful Relicks,
nay, Dregs rather of the former Glory of their Name and Nation,
which once gave her Laws, as Unalterable Decrees to all People,
Nations, and Languages: These thus dwindled and degenerated,
are the miserable Posterity of the <HI>Persians;</HI> who for so many Ages
have with a tame Patience submitted by a sordid Servitude to those
whom their Forefathers would have scorn'd to have admitted to be
their Slaves; only that they might idely enjoy their Country Gods,
Adore the Eternal Fire, and the Influence of the Sun upon their Al∣tars,
now Beastly and Impious more than ever, because they have
contaminated them with the Impure Rites and Diabolical Customs
of the worst of <HI>Pagans.</HI></P>
<P>For there are some of them Couple together in their Sacred
Feasts (as they term them) promiscuously,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Impure Feasts.</NOTE> when they meet in
their <HI>Delubriums;</HI> where they spread a clean Table-cloth on the Floor,
on which they place their Banquets to inflame their Lascivious Hear,
which must be acknowledged to be set on Fire by Hell, whatever the
Extract that they Worship as a Spark of the Sun, may be defended
to be. When they take away, they strew the foul Cloth with Meal-Flower,
and the better to perpetrate their Incestuous Lusts, they
put out the Lights, and shifting themselves stark naked, both Men
and Women, the Men cast their Breeches on an heap in a Cor∣ner
of the Room: Which being done, the Women run in the dark
to catch as catch can; and whatever Lot they light on, the Lamps
being again lighted, they firmly embrace for their Lover, if it be
Father or Brother, or any other Relation: And which is still worse,
the Night being spent in Bestiality, the nasty Flower (which by
their Filthiness either of Vomit or Excrement in which they wallow∣ed
like Brutes) is kneaded into a Past, and eaten as a Sacrament to re∣peat
the same ungodly Festival Annually, as if it were a Sacrifice
well-pleasing to their Deities. But Propagation after this kind is as odi∣ous
to Mankind, as offering Children to <HI>Moloch,</HI> or making them run
through the Fire is execrable and abhorrent to Nature: Which made
an Ancient Heathen, in detestation of such horrid Crimes offered as
grateful Services to the Gods, burst out into this Exclamation: <HI>Eve∣ry
one indeed ought to have a Sense of Religion, and a profound Vene∣ration
for their Country-Gods transmitted by Tradition; but that the
Immortal Gods should be appeased or pleased with such Wickedness, is
the highest Frenzy to believe.</HI></P>
<P>From these, those of <HI>India</HI> have learnt the same Principles of Reli∣gion;
and hence it is they agree in their Ceremonies of exposing
their Dead in an open Sepulcher, to be torn in pieces by Birds of
Prey, and to adore the Sun as a Chief Being, and, subordinate to it,
<PB N="267" REF="153"/>
the Four Elements; and here, as there, they are Preferred to no
higher Employments than to Cultivate the Earth as Villains, not
Inheritors.</P>
<P>Out of the Women are chosen Whores,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Wo∣men are Co∣medians.</NOTE> or Dancers for the
Court, and Comedians for the Emperor; who by Gesture, Voice,
or Shew, are Licensed to utter things Prophane, Lewd, and Ridi∣culous
to Chast Ears; only to move the itching Vanity of the Cour∣tiers,
indulging themselves in Obscenity.</P>
<P>They Feed on Flesh, Live Nastily; whereby that of <HI>Ovid</HI> is
appropriated to them, <HI>Trux caper in alis;</HI> being of a Goatish Smell,
as well as of a Rampant Temper, that they are rather an Antidote
than Provocative to Lechery; so much fallen are they from their
primitive Worth, according to the Observation of the <HI>Lyrick</HI>
Poet:
<Q><L>Aetas Parentum, pejor Avis, tulit</L>
<L>Nos nequiores mox daturos</L>
<L>Progeniem vitiosiorem.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Our Fathers Life much worse than Grandsires Age,</L>
<L>Sees us more Wicked to produce</L>
<L>An Offspring fuller of Abuse.</L></Q>
Contrary to what has been reported by a Laureat in their Com∣mendation:
<Q><L>Ille penes Persas Magus est qui sidera norit,</L>
<L>Qui scit herbarum vires cultumque deorum,</L>
<L>Persepoli facit ista Magos sapientia triplex.</L></Q>
<Q><L>He 'mong the <HI>Persians</HI> was a Wise Man thought,</L>
<L>Who knew the Stars and Worship'd as he ought,</L>
<L>Was Skill'd in Plants, and Virtues of them Taught.</L></Q></P>
<P>Proper Names among them, are <HI>Cusset, Biram, Rustam,</HI> but the
most general is <HI>Asa;</HI> whereupon I shall let them pass with this Re∣mark,
Whether we mayn't here find the Industrious Mr. <HI>Shering∣ham</HI>'s
Labour in search of Truth answer'd in his far-fetch'd <HI>Asae;
Asa</HI> being the Commonest Name among the <HI>Gabers,</HI> whom he makes
the Companions of <HI>Woden</HI> in his <HI>German</HI> Expedition; which still
confirms our Assertion, both of the World's being Repeopled from
the <HI>Scythian</HI> Mountains, and of these being Allied to our First Plan∣ters,
however Degenerate they now appear. Among this Off-scum
left to upbraid their Predecessors, are placed the <HI>Armenians,</HI> who are
forced to comply to an over-ruling Fate, out of the same necessity
that attends the Chance of War, but with a better reserve to their
Virtue, which is not altogether so much depressed.</P>
<P>Though the State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Armeni∣ans</HI> have a Ci∣vil Governor of their own, as well as one of the <HI>Moors.</HI></NOTE> for publick Ends, think it convenient to inter∣sperse
<HI>Moors</HI> among them, as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> wisely enough did Task-Masters
over the <HI>Israelites</HI> in the Land of <HI>Goshen,</HI> to suppress, by a
timely foresight, what might prove irremediable by an overgrowing
<PB N="268" REF="154"/>
Strength; wherefore one of the <HI>Suffean</HI> Creed is Constituted Go∣vernor,
to put an end to those Differences they cannot Compose
themselves; who have for that purpose a Civil Magistrate of their
own, Elected Yearly, to whose Arbitriment, if they submit not,
it is their own sault, nor can it be by any means imputed to the
Tyranny of the Government, who leave them freely to try their
own Causes.</P>
<P>For so it was provided by <HI>Shaw Abas</HI> when he deprived them of
their own Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are un∣der Protecti∣on of the Em∣press since their Tran∣splanting to <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fa.</HI></NOTE> and redeemed them from the <HI>Turkish</HI> Slavery;
between whose Arms and the <HI>Persians,</HI> they hung miserably harras∣sed,
according to the Successes of eithers Forces, for a long time;
removing them from <HI>Erewan, Taberez,</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> their Native
Soil, he Transplanted them to <HI>Jelfa,</HI> and shaded them under the
Protection of the Queen-Mother, asserting thereby their Rights and
Privileges in an higher manner (abating some little Circumstances)
than the <HI>Moors</HI> themselves; by which they became not only safe
from their Enemies, but they improved the Glory of <HI>Spahaun</HI> by
their unwearied Industry, there being many of them Credible Mer∣chants
at this time, accounted worth an Hundred thousand <HI>Tho∣mand</HI>
(each <HI>Thomand</HI> being Three Pound and a Noble); so mightily
do they increase under this Umbrage, in Riches and Freedom; for
whilst they sit lazily at Home, their Factors abroad in all parts of
the Earth return to their Hives laden with Honey; to which Exer∣cise,
after they themselves have been brought up, they train
their Children under the safe Conduct of Experienced Tutors,
who instruct them first to Labour for a Livelihood, before they are
permitted to Expend.</P>
<P>Thus this Prince not only expressed himself a good Patron, but a
prudent Emperor, by Favouring their Designs, and taking all Occa∣sions
from their Adversaries of Injuring them, exposed as they were
to open Violence; and at Home Securing them from the Treachery
and Envy of his own Subjects; not only allotting them a place
over-against his own Palace to Build their City, but encouraging
them to Rear Costly and well Endowed Temples, without any
Molestation, to the Honour of the Blessed Name of Christ; shaking
off thereby the dreadful fear of Captivity, they began to hope for
better things, than they could promise themselves in their distressed
Condition.</P>
<Q><L>Atque illi primum sperare salutem</L>
<L>Sic Ausi, afflictis melius confidere rebus.</L></Q>
<P>Nor was this hope founded on a vain confidence; for he distinguished
them neither in Habit, Excise, or Custom, from his own <HI>Persians,</HI> only
excepting in one thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their being forbid <HI>Coleons</HI> the cause of Apostatizing.</NOTE> small and inconsiderable in its self, being but
an exterior piece of Honour; for it is not lawful, even for those of the
best Rank, to Ride into <HI>Spahaun</HI> with their Servants bearing after
them their <HI>Coleons,</HI> or Glass Vessels, out of which they Smoak To∣bacco,
by a long Reed, or Cane, fixed into Golden, Silver, or Brass
Heads, with other Magnificent Appendices, carried stately behind
them, invented to signalize Men of better Fortune among them; and
<PB N="269" REF="154"/>
only forbid the <HI>Armenians;</HI> whereby letting them know, however
Blessed they are with this World's Goods, yet they were to appear in
the Royal City only as Merchants: Which thing, how silly and
trivial it is in reality, and to Wise Men is but an wholesome Admo∣nition,
yet it has been but too often the ground of Apostatizing from
their Heavenly Institution; it seeming a Curb to Ambitious and
Aspiring Spirits, who prefer the Pleasures and Pomp of this Life,
short and uncertain as they are, before those more Permanent in the
Assurance of the Life to come; and are as little in love with their
own Country Manners, as they are tenacious of the Religion of their
Forefathers; shipwrecking thereby, Faith and a good Conscience, for
the affectation of the adulterate and glossy Customs in esteem
among the <HI>Persians,</HI> to which indeed they generally incline.</P>
<P>On which score it is their Women are little conversant with the
Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They Restrain their Women.</NOTE> so that Women here, (more than any where else) are truly
Women, and nothing more; the Men here being unexpert how far
the Friendly Offices, a Graceful Mein, and Innocent Discourse,
wins among more refined Christians from the becoming Behaviour
of that Sex.</P>
<P>In heaping up Riches they stoop to any base means,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tem∣per.</NOTE> for they
arise from the most avaritious Temper: In their Profuseness they are
rather Specious and for Shew, than Generous.</P>
<P>They have sumptuous Houses, Enriched either by being Mer∣chants,
or Interpreters to Foreign Ministers, they being addicted to
Learn Languages; few care for Manual Arts, or Mechanick Trades,
though some apply themselves to Husbandry.</P>
<P>They are great Revellers, and like long Feasting; have as much
Religion as serves their turn: Their Rusticks are truly such; and
such as are employed in necessary Vocations and inferior Callings, are
Sluttish and Slothful.</P>
<P>Their Speech, as well as Character, is their own, and if it bor∣row
any thing, it is from the <HI>Greek;</HI> by which it is polished from
its Barbarity, and reduced to a more Modish Dialect.</P>
<P>Established thus by the King's Favour, they cannot but be excited
as a grateful return to the Disposer of the Hearts of Kings, and
the Giver of all things, to pay a Tribute of their Increase in Build∣ing
and Adorning stately Churches to that God who is King of
kings, and Lord of lords; bestowing largely both towards their
Beautifying in every kind, as being sufficiently stored with the best
Patterns, as well as precious Substance, by their constant Tra∣velling
and rich Adventures, as also towards a plentiful Allowance.</P>
<P>By whose Munificence and Charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirteen Pa∣rish Churches, a Cathedral, and Convents.</NOTE> besides Colleges and Con∣vents
for Monasticks, are Thirteen Parish Churches, and a Cathe∣dral,
whose Description shall serve for all: The Majesty of the Mo∣ther-Church
at <HI>Jelfa,</HI> rises not to that Loftiness, either to Offend the
Eyes with its Splendor, or to create a Jealousy, from its prodigious
Structure, of another Tower of <HI>Babel;</HI> but keeps the mean, as
truly becomes the place separated for the Service of the only True
God; not so spacious as neat, leaning on Four Pillars, which bear an
Oval Lanthorn, or Crown, over the Center of the Dome, by which
the chief Lights are transmitted to the rest of the Building, and by
<PB N="270" REF="155"/>
them the Temple divided into four parts; the first whereof is almost
all taken up by the High Altar, Garnished with the Images of the
Blessed Mother, and the Holy Child Jesus, unless a small Ascent
left for the Singers, the Bishops Chair, and for Persons of Quality
among them; the Side-Wings and the Middle half way down the
Nave, being left for the Men; all the rest is Occupied by the
Women, even to the very Folding Doors of the Temple; the Roof
or Vault of the Arches, the Side-Walls and Posts of the Cathedral,
are all Painted with Sacred Histories; and had it not been for fear of
the <HI>Moors,</HI> after the Decease of their Patron <HI>Shaw Abas,</HI> who envied
them so Magnificent a Pile, they would have known no measure to
the desire of enlarging, nor could have ever thought it venust
enough, whilst they abounded with Pious Benefactors; but to this
Enterprize there wanted not Obstructions, even in their own Bowels.
For every perverse Apostate, on any pretence of Quarrel among
themselves, to obtain an unjust Victory over his Antagonist, has
no more to do, but throw away his Soul, Renounce his Saviour,
be Cut, and made a <HI>Musselman;</HI> offering himself a Sacrifice to his
Malice, Pride, and Revenge, and thence of a Convert, becomes an
implacable Enemy to Christianity; and endeavouring to shew him∣self

and the more to ingratiate himself with Antichrist, studiously bends
himself to the Ruin of that Church he deserted; whence follows
an assured Spoil, and Sacrilegious Rapin, when he declares the exu∣berant
Treasure, the vast Profuseness and Prodigality of the Chri∣stians
on their Churches, concluding all with an Invective against
their Idolatrous Worship: However such as pertinaciously adhere to

under <HI>Sanatrughio</HI> the King of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> who Slew them, not

<P>From which time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Gregory</HI> the first Patriarch.</NOTE> Two hundred Years being past, arose the Va∣liant

Fifteen Years Maceration in a Well, where he was privately relieved

who reflecting afterwards with Remorse on his rash Precept,
took him from that stinking Dungeon, and endured his Reproof for
his Bestiality towards the Good Man, and became an hearty Penitent

from a Salvage Prince rendred himself a tame Follower of the Pa∣triarch

to the Sacred Synod held at <HI>Chalcedon.</HI> This Blast pestered not
only the inferior <HI>Syria,</HI> but spread its deadly Effects over all <HI>Egypt,</HI>
by the Contagion <HI>Severus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Antioch</HI> had sucked in, from
whom they were denominated <HI>Severians:</HI> And as the Saying is, <HI>Ill
Weeds grow with speed,</HI> so from the same Root grew that horrible
shap'd and preposterous <HI>Julian</HI> Birth, from whom came the <HI>Julia∣nists;</HI>
and from their several ill-begetting Sires, the <HI>Gaunits, Theodo∣sians,
Bersanians;</HI> and at last the most deformed of all, by the unhap∣py
Labour of <HI>Jacob</HI> the <HI>Syrian,</HI> was produced the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> who
jumbling together with the <HI>Acephali</HI> and <HI>Monosyphites,</HI> they confess
the One Nature in Christ to be compounded of Two after the Uni∣on:
With the <HI>Theodosian Theopassits,</HI> they assert the Divinity of our
Saviour to be Passible; and with the <HI>Julianists, Gaianists,</HI> and <HI>Apthar∣docits,</HI>
affirm the Body of Christ to be altogether Corruptible; from
whence they are nicknamed <HI>Corrupticulae</HI> and <HI>Phantaistae.</HI></P>
<P>Under <HI>Abraham Rusidianus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Georgians</HI> depart from the <HI>Armenians.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Iberians,</HI> now called <HI>Georgians,</HI> de∣parted
from the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and embracing the <HI>Chalcedonian</HI> and
<HI>Ephesian</HI> Councils, were reconciled to the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.</P>
<P>In the Year of our Redemption, 551, <HI>Moyses Arcazuodanus</HI>
placed the <HI>Turkish</HI> Computation in the <HI>Armenian Kalender,</HI>
which began about this Time; which number, if it be added
to the Thousand of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> makes out their <HI>Gregorian</HI>
Account, which they follow, and not that of our Lord. In
the Reign of this Patriarch, while the Universal Church were busied
in corroborating the Four General Councils, to wit, the <HI>Nicene, Con∣stantinopolitan,
Ephesian,</HI> and <HI>Chalcedonian, Armenia</HI> was employed in
resisting and opposing their Determination. When was revived that
filthy Sect of the <HI>Manechites;</HI> which sort of Hereticks had inhabi∣ted
<HI>Armenia</HI> before, receiving their Name from a <HI>Persian,</HI> who was
called <HI>Manes;</HI> he denied the Trinity and the Old Testament, and
held Two Principles, the one of Good, and the other of Evil: By
whose Inauspicious Influence, and the Incursions of the <HI>Saracens</HI> and
<HI>Tartars</HI> invading and subduing the <HI>Persians,</HI> all the hopes of recon∣ciling
the <HI>Grecian</HI> Church, and extirpating those Heresies, vanished.</P>
<P>But on the contrary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Patriar∣chate branch∣ed into Three Divisions.</NOTE> in Process of Time they withdrew from their
Primitive Patriarch, into the setting up of Two more; so the See of
St. <HI>Gregory</HI> became divided, and they despised the Holy Well of <HI>Va∣garsciebat;</HI>
for at <HI>Erewan,</HI> near <HI>Taberez,</HI> or <HI>Taurus,</HI> they translated
the Metropolitan; which gave occasion to the Bishop of <HI>Sis</HI> to set
<PB N="273" REF="156"/>
up for Patriarch at <HI>Sis</HI> in <HI>Cilicia;</HI> and the Monastry of <HI>Causabar</HI> plead∣ing
Antiquity, lying towards <HI>Candahar,</HI> on that Prescript refused
Obedience to any but their own Patriarch.</P>
<P>By which Seraphick Triumvirate they are now governed, own∣ing
no other Head of the Church.</P>
<P>But before we descend into the particular Tenents still maintained
by them, it will not be amiss to note, That from the Time of St. <HI>Gre∣gory</HI>
to this Division, was Four hundred twenty five Years, in which
there were Thirty three Patriarchs, agreeable to their own Annals;

the Papal Authority.</P>

<P>The Series after this Succession of Patriarchs, as it was immediate∣ly
puddled with the Mud of Heresy, so it often was disturbed by
the Imposition of the Secular Power, forcing not only Ignorant but
Ungodly Men upon them; who now at this Time have their <HI>Conge
d' Eslire</HI> from a Prince of another Religion, and many times purchase
it by Simoniacal Contracts: So that the Purity of Christianity can∣not
be expected, where Gain is made of Godliness, and these high
Cures of Souls are bought and sold; entring upon them with the
Emperor's License, not the Approbation of their own Clergy; not
by Desert and Merit, but by Fraud and Circumvention: And where∣as
Humility and Godliness, Learning and Ingenuity, should be the
Qualifications, now Pride and Envy, great Gifts with Stupidity are
exalted: And which is most deplorable, generally such Men are put
into the Patriarchates as are most odious to them; whence it comes
to pass, that these Prelates have as little Integrity as Orthodoxy,
they favouring the <HI>Jacobites</HI> even to this day.</P>
<P>They are confident in the Superstitious Omens of the Heathens.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Te∣nents.</NOTE></P>
<P>Judaize in the Choice of Meats, not eating Conies or Pork.</P>
<P>Assert the One Nature in Christ, according to <HI>Dioscorus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="157"/>
Hold that the Holy Ghost proceeds not from the Son, according
to the Error of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.</P>
<P>That the Souls of Saints departed enter not into the Kingdom of
Heaven, nor of the Wicked into Hell, but are in the Middle Region of
the Air, expecting the Day of Judgment.</P>
<P>And therefore Pray for the Dead.</P>
<P>Detest the Council of <HI>Chalcedon.</HI></P>
<P>They have Five Sacraments, leaving out Confirmation and Ex∣treme
Unction, which makes theirs less by Two than the Papists.</P>
<P>They buy and sell the Sacraments of the Church for a Price.</P>
<P>The Clergymen Merchandize.</P>
<P>They make Divorces for Money.</P>
<P>The Substance of the Deceased fall into their hands, till the Right
Heir redeem them.</P>
<P>They administer the Sacraments to Children, before the Use of
Right Reason.</P>
<P>They deny the Superiority or Primacy to the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, and
they use this Interrogation for an Argument, <Q>Why rather That than
the Church of <HI>Antioch,</HI> in which City we were first called Christians,
by the Preaching of St. <HI>Peter?</HI></Q></P>
<P>They are against Purgatory. For which reason the <HI>Romanists</HI> affix
the Error of the <HI>Abassins</HI> upon them, Of Cauterizing when they
Baptize Infants, or initiate any into the Church; according to the
Words of St. <HI>John, He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with
Fire;</HI> taking the Words literally: Wherefore the <HI>Abassins,</HI> not the
<HI>Armenians,</HI> are called St. <HI>John</HI>'s Christians.</P>
<P>They distribute the Eucharist in both kinds to the People, in Com∣memoration
of the Body of Christ, dipping the Wafer into the
Wine and Water mixed together, and then give it to the Commu∣nicants.</P>
<P>They wrap the Word of God in a clean Piece of Silk, which
when the Priest unfolds, he kisses the Bible, and bows: The like
Ceremony is used at the Elevation of the Host, which he gives to all
alike to salute, as also both the Testaments.</P>
<P>These are the Customs and Opinions divulged and maintained by
their Patriarchs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Patri∣archs install'd with Pomp.</NOTE> to whom great Honour is paid; being introduced
into their several Sees as well by the Pomp of the <HI>Moors</HI> as the Solem∣nity
of the Christians: The <HI>Cauns</HI> of the Provinces conducting them
with all their Train, and Forces of Horse and Foot, with Banners
flying, and loud Musick resounding, great Guns discharging, and
all the Expressions of Joy congratulating their Instalment, and the
King's Favour towards them.</P>
<P>The Clergy meet them in their several Habits; the Laity also shew
their Gallantry, and the Patriarchs themselves are in their Holy Vest∣ments,
Rich Copes, Mitres, and Crosiers, beset with inestimable
Jewels. They are distinguished from the Bishops by wearing Rings
on their Fingers, embellished with Diamonds, whereas the Bishops
wear only plain Gold Rings. Their Pontificals being put off, they
walk in a Black Gown with a Mitred Hood and Pastoral Staff, as do
the <HI>Vortobeeds,</HI> who are the learned'st and best esteem'd of all their
<PB N="275" REF="157"/>
Orders, and in absence of the Patriarch and Bishops exercise all the
Pontifical Functions: These are Eloquent Preachers in their Pulpits;
these only vow Chastity, and what is more strict, endure not the
sight of a Woman; and if in the Street by chance they meet one,
they presently turn their Backs; and if they have any Business in
that part of the Church allotted them by Custom, they commit not
themselves to them, but cause them to be drove away, before they
will read the Service.</P>
<P>At <HI>Jelfa</HI> some Forty of these live a Celibate Life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Vortobeeds</HI> or Monasticks.</NOTE> at the Monastry
joining to the Cathedral, in Cells and Cloysters, with an Archbishop
of the same Order, faring hardly, and living devoutly.</P>
<P>The Archbishop of <HI>Jelfa</HI> submits his Province to the Patriarch of
<HI>Vagarsiabat;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Archbi∣shop.</NOTE> he is a goodly Reverend Old Man, snowed with Age,
but not worn with it; he has a Countenance of Sanctity apparent in
his Looks, worthy the Gravity of so Eminent a Dignity.</P>
<P>The other Orders of the Clergy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Clergy marry.</NOTE> whether Priests, Deacons, Ca∣nons,
or Choristers, use Christian Liberty in respect of Matrimony,
it being disallowed none but the <HI>Vortobeeds:</HI> They are distinguished
no other ways from the Rusticks, than their wearing Blue Vests,
Turbats, and Tunicks, as they do, unless a long Cloak, or Gown of
Black over all, points them out to be an <HI>Armenian</HI> Father, or an Ec∣clesiastick
in Orders: They are shaved as the <HI>Romans</HI> are, and unco∣ver
their Heads in Salutation; they are constant Frequenters of their
Churches, and have Lamps always burning in them; and every one
takes his turn in the Order of the Priesthood, to wait Day and Night
in the Temples, according to the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Institution, to whom are
appointed Lodgings adjoining to their Churches; at other Times
they live with their Families in the City: Every one approaching
them pays them a Reverence, and begs their Blessing, kissing the
Hem of their Garments, which the Priests return to the <HI>Vortobeeds,</HI>
the <HI>Vortobeeds</HI> to the Bishops, and the Bishops to the Patriarchs.</P>
<P>Having been present at their Masses for the Dead, for Infants in
Baptism, and for the Husband and Wife new-married; I shall thence
take occasion to relate in short their Banquets, Fasts, and Ceremo∣nies
used on their Celebrating these Rites.</P>
<P>We shall begin with their first Admission into the Pale of the
Church.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baptism.</NOTE> While they are at Divine Service a proper Mass is said,
when the Midwife or Nurse brings the Child to Church, with a Tribe
of Women, where she delivers it to the Godfather, who carries it to
the Minister waiting at the Font on the Right Side beneath the Altar,
who unwinding the Swathes, receives the Infant naked, and his
Thumb being anointed with consecrated Oyl or Balsom, signs it
with the Sign of the Cross, not only on the Forhead, but on the
Breast and Back, Feet and Arms, and all the other Parts of the Bo∣dy:
After this, pouring of the same Chrysm into the warm Water
in the Font, reciting some special Prayers, and dipping the Crucifix
into it, it becomes an Hallowed Bath, in which the Babe is washed
all over by the Priest: When it is taken out, it is crossed from Head
to Foot, and spitting into the Ears and Eyes it is dismiss'd with an
Amulet hung at its Breast for Eight Days, as a Charm against Witch∣craft,
<PB N="276" REF="158"/>
and restored to the Women to be cloathed. The Mass being
done, the Guests return to the House of the Parents, with a Noise
of Musick before them, and the Choir in Procession singing Anthems,
where they all make merry before they depart. If it be a Girl it is
Espoused immediately after Baptism, to prevent its being sent for into
the <HI>Haram</HI> by the Emperor, who pretends a Power over them to
chuse for his own use out of those not betrothed.</P>
<P>The great Festivity of the Birth and Baptism of our Saviour, ob∣served
on the 6<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>January,</HI> is celebrated with Rites of the like na∣ture,
for they consecrate the Tank or Cistern, filled with Water and
Odoriferous Oyls, which, after the Sacrament received, is given out
among the People with great Clamour and Striving.</P>
<P>This Solemnity has been so Splendid, that the Emperors and the
Court were wont to honour it with their Presence, when they were
entertained with Interludes, and Representations of the Birth, the
Morning being ushered in with Vocal and Instrumental Musick,
with Millions of Flambeaus, and shewing the Angels and Shepherds,
with the Heavenly Host, <HI>Singing praises to God on high, and good will
towards Men.</HI></P>
<P>When this was performed, the Rich Merchants strove to express
their Sense of these Favours, by inviting them to extraordinary Ban∣queting
and Feasting; and after Expensive Repasts, the River being
consecrated for the purpose, the Ceremonies of Baptism were per∣formed,
when notwithstanding it is extreamly cold, those of Riper
Years were baptized, and swam about for the Diversion of the Court;
concluding all with a Night of Jollity.</P>
<P>The modestest account of which Pranks must be, The Hopes of
gaining Proselytes by such Shews, rather than to expose their most
Holy Religion to the Contempt of Infidels, out of any Design or In∣terest;
otherwise this Practice admits of a scandalous Interpretation:
But alas! it is too true in the affirmative, That in <HI>India</HI> among the
Idolatrous it might take, but among those that abhor all manner of
Forms and Shapes in their Worship, it turns to the Reproach, and not
Advancement of Christianity.</P>
<P>The next thing after being Baptized,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matrimony.</NOTE> is to commit Matrimony,
the only way they have of propagating their Faith; it being a Pu∣nishment
no less than Capital, to attempt by any means to persuade a
<HI>Mussleman</HI> to abjure his besotted Fancy concerning their False Pro∣phet;
but that is not so much the Reason, as prevailing Custom,
which has from Age to Age led them to marry their Children very
young; chiefly because the Advantage made by their Bargain is not
of such Concern as in <HI>Europe,</HI> where Portion, more than Honesty of
the Family, is considered; but here the greatest Dowry is the Credit
of the Relations, and the Women not the Men make the Price, they
being Mistresses of nothing more than their Beauty and Virtue; so
that they never are snatch'd up for their Great Fortunes, however
Wealthy their Parents are, they being wholly at their Disposals who
make the Matches, without the Courtship or Knowledge of the Cou∣ple
to be married; wherefore they are entred into that sort of Life
before they know how to get out of it; for they rarely pass their
<PB N="277" REF="158"/>
Childhood before they are tied in that indissoluble Band; whence
some Excuse may be made, for the Priests so frequently taking Mo∣ney
to Unmarry them; a thing I have heard more than once wish'd
for in other Countries, but in vain; though they promise to be as
liberal to the Parson who had that Knack, as any one grieved with
the Gout, would be to the Physician who had an infallible way to
Cure that Distemper.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies enjoined by the Church are agreeable enough to
the <HI>Romish</HI> Institution: Returning home, the Wedded Pair are kept
close up together for Forty Days, loaded with Rosaries and Images,
and none suffered to come at them, that are Strangers, nor the
Womankind to speak to any but their Husband; lest an evil Tongue
should have a Sorcerous effect, or a bad Eye should Inchant their fu∣ture
Bliss.</P>
<P>This <HI>Quadragessimal</HI> Restraint being over (if no Fast intervene,
of which their Church is full) they prepare themselves to Cele∣brate
the Nuptials with their Kindred, which is on this manner:
The Eldest of the Family on the Husband's side, opens the Festival
by first Inviting the Guests to the Marriage Feast, where the Bride∣groom
appears in a mean Dress and poorly Habited, till the Priests
have received Richer Habiliments of the Grandfathers, or Eldest
Uncles Gift, and brought them covered into the middle of the
Guest Chamber, where they Sanctify them and Bless them for his
use, the Youth standing by; to verify what <HI>Paladius</HI> used for a Pro∣verb,
<HI>Investem Puerum quasi imberbem,</HI> when he called a Beardless
Boy by the Epithet of an Undressed Lad; and every one taking their
Places, the Servants lay them down on the Carpets, and unwinding
the Silk Embroidered for to wrap them in, discover only the Bride∣groom's
Suit, with an old rusty Sword of the Family's, not worn
since <HI>Shaw Abas</HI> reduced them; for in these Countries it is not the
Custom that Women of good Fame, or Repute, should meet in
Publick Conventions with the Men, but they Transact their own
Affairs in their own House of Parliament among themselves.</P>
<P>On the Heels of the Servants come the Clerks with their Choir,
and taking the Cloaths, only one (which is all Cloth of Gold) being
the uppermost Garment, is a loose Coat of <HI>London</HI> Cloth, without
Sleeves, Lined with Sables to keep off the Winters Cold; when the
Reverend Sages call forth the new Married Stripling, whom they place
between Two Bridemen about his own Age, they all Three Kneel∣ing,
while they Sing the <HI>Epithalamium,</HI> not so much as lifting up
their Heads till all the Rites are finished; then they wait on the Bride∣groom
into another Room, whither his Robes are carried, and when
he is shifted, he returns attended by his Bridemen; when every one
of them Salute the Hands of all that are called to this Solemnity,
and, after an Ancient Custom, Invite them to take a Cold Ban∣quet
among the Tombs, to put them in mind of Mortality at the
same time they are contriving to continue the World.</P>
<P>The Young Spark being lift up on Horseback, and some time
carefully held on each side on Foot, leads the way to the Cavalcade,
Riding in State, after a Noise of Fidlers, Drummers, Pipers, and
other Lacquies, Pages, and Footmen; after whom an innumerable
<PB N="278" REF="159"/>
Concourse of Horsemen follow to the Graves, near a Mile out of
the City (among whom are some very noble Sepulchres fit to re∣ceive
so great a Company) but in fair Weather they spread their
Carpets, and set up their Tents near the side of a Brook, almost
washing their Burial place.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Bacchus</HI> having shewn their good will to <HI>Venus,</HI>
(for it is known without them no hearty Sacrifice is paid her) <HI>Hymen</HI>
delivers out his Torches, the Sun having withdrawn his; and every
one there takes a Wax Light in his Hand, and Mounting, direct
themselves towards the City, in the same manner they came out,
only Bonfires, Flambeaus, and Fireworks Illuminate the Road all
along: Entring <HI>Jelfa,</HI> the stately Gates of their Friends and Rela∣tions,
especially such as are present at the Collation, are bestuck with
Tapers in divers Coloured Paper Lanthorns; which look gracefully
and divert the Company with variety of Artful Fires, each striving
to outvie others; and are Entertained at the same time with Wine
and Sweetmeats, Drinking of Healths, and at last dismiss'd with
fresh Tapers given to all the Guests.</P>
<P>This continues in the Way to the Cathedral, where about Mid∣night
the Bridegroom arriving, begs the Blessing of the Archbishop,
and they hardly return to the House from whence they set out, till
almost Break of Day.</P>
<P>Where they are scarcely composed to Sleep, before the Father of
the Bride knocks on the same Errand, calling the Guests to accept of
a Treat at his House; where those Invited are carried into a noble
open Banquetting-House in a Garden, with Tanks and Adornments
very Magnificent, after their Fashion; the Room is Persumed with
costly Odours, Smoaking out of Antick, Weighty, Silver Perfu∣ming
Pots, or Pans; and being Seated, Voiders of Sweatmeats
(with a <HI>Russian</HI> Coat, as they call it) a Dram of Brandy is set be∣fore
every one; and then the Servants bring the best Raiments yet
presented the Bridegroom, being the Father-in-laws, or his Repre∣sentatives;
the Ceremonies are the same of the Clergy, only with
this addition, the Bridemen which Kneeled yesterday, to day stand
upright with flaming Flambeaus in their Hands.</P>
<P>These Ceremonies ended, and the Sweatmeats taken off, a Table
is spread, and more than twice Seven Plates are differently Modified
to invite the Palate to Luxury; to which that of <HI>Muturantius,</HI> for
which <HI>Juvenal</HI> Lampoons him, is a modest piece of Temperance:
<Q><L>—Quis fercula septem</L>
<L>Secreto cenavit Avus—</L></Q>
But here are such loads of Provisions, that none need fear a quicker
Eye than Appetite, at leisure to take notice what each Eats; for
should they do nothing but devour, their Stomachs must be cloied
before their Portions sink.</P>
<P>Yet all these Preparations, with the enticing Poinant Sawces,
and provoking Pickles, prevail not on the Bridegroom to fall to,
till the Father-in-Law lays to his new Son's double Mess, a Purse of
Gold; and this is the only thing they bear away by way of Dowry:
<PB N="279" REF="159"/>
After this Debt is cancelled, no Cloud appears to disturb the Mirth,
Eating, Drinking, and facetious Discourse is all the Business; and in
earnest it is one, and a tedious one where it lavishes into such
Excess.</P>
<P>For what was reported of Old, still holds good, The <HI>Persians</HI>
Drink Wine in Bowls; and they observe <HI>Gellius</HI> his Rule, <HI>de Lege
Caenarum,</HI> as a Law to their Feasts, <HI>Dum libentissime edas, tunc aufer∣tur,
&amp; alia esca melior atque amplior succenturiatur, isque flos coenae ha∣betur;</HI>
as if they never thought you Welcome before you had Eat
like a Glutton, and Drank like a Swine: After shifting of Plates
unaccountably, and every one's Health has reason done it, they take
off the Table-Cloth, but not remove their Seats; Fruit, Wine, To∣bacco,
and Salt Bits for a Whet, being placed before them, they
continue Drinking till Midnight, being diverted by Stage-Players,
Dancers, and Mountebanks all Day; nor will they themselves dis∣dain
to take up a Tabor and Roar out a Song behind that, and a
Flute Playing to them.</P>
<P>At Night Fireworks begin again, having had the constant ones of
the Water all the time, arising in Crowns and Garlands, with other
Figures; at last they bring the News that the Matrons had dismissed
the Bride Adorned with all her Wealth and Gallantry; when they
rise, but proceed not till she is delivered to her Groom, who waits on
her to her Horse; when they are both Mounted, the Ecclesiasticks
marshal the Procession; all the Streets are Illuminated, the loud
Drums and Trumpets proclaim their approach; in the Front is car∣ried
a Tree full of Fruit; after it follows the <HI>Europeans,</HI> then the <HI>Ar∣menians</HI>
in order; in the midst of them the Canonical Gentlemen
and Boys, singing and Playing on Musical Instruments, all in their
peculiar Habits, which were Rich, and the Choiristers Surplices full
of Red Crosses; after these the Bride and Bridegroom, He nobly
Mounted and splendidly Accoutred with Magnificent Trappings;
his Horse led, and the Bride held on by Matrons, Cross-legg'd, after
the Country Fashion for Women to Ride, but Vailed all over with
a Saffron-coloured Vail;
<Q>Lutea demissos velârunt flammea vultus.</Q>
Lest if the Blushes of the Virgin Bride should be discovered, or if too
high a Colour should be discerned in the Maiden Face, it may be im∣puted
to the Vail, not the Floridness of the Cheeks; after all, in
the close of the Procession, come the Matrons Attired in White
Sheets.</P>
<P>Nor do they go far before they repeat their Banquets, with Presents
of Tapers, Sweetmeats, Squibs, Serpents and Rockets, as they pass;
the Glory of this Night is always designed to pay their Respects to
their Governor in Chief, who receives them very great, and grants
a License for the Youth to carry his Spouse home, which he does,
departing from hence to his Father's House, where the Company
end their <HI>Thalasses,</HI> and leave them to Contemplate the Joys of
Matrimony.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="160"/>
The next day, if it be a Fast, is intermitted; but the Feast holds
on till the Relations have finished their Course, which is sometimes
more than a Month; so profuse are they of their Time and Money
on this occasion.</P>
<P>After Marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purification.</NOTE> of right succeeds Child-bearing, which keeps
the same state in Lying in as with us, only they are something long∣er
before their Purification, agreeing therein with the <HI>Jewish</HI> Account
of Forty days; when they enter their Baths to Cleanse, and bring
the New-born Babes with them to the Church, that the Priest may
at once give his Benediction to the Infant, and the Mother return
Thanks to God, who assists at their Births and their own Delivery.</P>
<P>From these Festivals thus Celebrated at large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Feasts and Fasts Or∣dained by their Church.</NOTE> it is meet we should
see how those enjoined by the Church are tempered with days of Ab∣stinence,
as well to fit them for the studies of Piety and Moderation,
as on their Feast-days by a Christian Chearfulness, to declare to the
World the excellency of their Original, and that they were Ordained
as a Refreshment after sincere Humiliation and Penance.</P>
<P>Two Days in every Week they hold a strict Fast, not only from
all manner of Wine, Oil, and Butter, but from Flesh and all Nou∣rishment
whatever indued with a sensitive Being; living like the
<HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> on Herbs and Roots, especially the Ecclesiasticks, who
Macerate themselves severely; these Days are <HI>Wednesdays</HI> and <HI>Fri∣days,</HI>
unless <HI>Christmass</HI> Day, or the Baptism of our Saviour, hap∣pen
on either of them: Before which they prepare themselves by
a Weeks continued Fast. The Laics indeed indulge themselves
with Wine, but the Clergy by no means: Their much admired
St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> has exempted Women with Child, the Infirm and
Children, from the Rigour of these Observances, leaving them this
as a Maxim, <HI>That Health is not to be impaired, but the Mind strengthned
by a due subjection.</HI></P>
<P>On the Dawn of the Gospel, which had been Gloriously dis∣played
by the Angels Appearance to the Shepherds tending their
Flocks, we have already related the Solemnity; yet because here re∣mains
a dispute among the <HI>Armenians,</HI> which Day to affix the fol∣lowing
Tradition to, I shall only mention it here, and leave it to
their own decision; for it is a question among them, If it be not most
probable, that after the bright Phosphor of the Heavenly Host, the
Shepherds Eyes might not be dazled, and for that reason wanting
more than the Light of the Stars, were constrained to kindle dry
Twigs, or Boughs of Trees to light them in quest of the declared
Messias? However this satisfies not the Generality, but that it has
many Opposers, and they say, it was on the Morning to the Purifi∣cation
of the Blessed Virgin, when Old <HI>Simeon</HI> had his Age Re∣newed
and became Young enough to Embrace the Child Jesus, and
being Divinely Inspired, Prophesied of the Salvation of all Nations,
and brought the Holy Babe in at the Folding Doors of the Temple;
which, by a received Belief among the <HI>Jews,</HI> were never to be opened
till those Days of Peace should come wherein Christ should appear;
the Novelty of which Accident being spread about the City of <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI>
all sorts of People came flocking before day with such com∣bustible
Torches, to be Witnesses of the truth: On which day
<PB N="281" REF="160"/>
therefore it being more universally received, the <HI>Armenian</HI> Divines
and Interpreters of these Mysteries appoint Fires to be kindled in
their Churches, and Annually rejoice for that they have found their
Lord and Master.</P>
<P>On the 13<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>January,</HI> for a less Apocryphal Story, they pro∣claim
a Fast, and humble themselves in Dust and Ashes on their
Heads, and Sackcloth on their Bodies, for the Denunciation <HI>Jonas</HI>
made of God's Judgment against <HI>Niniveh;</HI> and on the 20<SUP>th</SUP> rejoice
for the Aversion thereof on their unfeigned Repentance.</P>
<P>The Preparation for, and Continuation of their <HI>Lent</HI> till the <HI>Passion</HI>
Night, they religiously keep with almost a <HI>Suguntin</HI> Fast, that is, al∣most
famish themselves to Death; when they repair to the Tombs of
their Friends and Relations, with burning Incense and lighted Can∣dles;
where they pray for the Dead, or more charitably recommend
them to a quiet Repose by the Mouth of their Priests, and at the
same time refresh themselves with Fruit and Melons, the Women
with their Husbands and Infants drinking to their pious Memory,
freely taking off their Cups, and weeping plentifully with a sad La∣mentation and mighty Outcry; till the Wine make them have a
Light Heart and a Merry Countenance; which course they take till
the Ascension, Weeping and Wailing, Drinking and Quaffing.</P>
<P><HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Whitsuntide</HI> they keep as the Primitive Christians did.</P>
<P>From the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> they castigate themselves with cutting
Disciplines; for that <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great when Emperor, marching
out to fight, breathed nothing but Slaughter against the Christians,
till convinced by an Apparition of the Sign of the Cross in the Hea∣vens,
with this Advertisement, <HI>In hoc Signo tantum vinces,</HI> where∣upon
he became the first Christian Emperor, defending that Religion
against all its Adversaries: For which miraculous Conversion, they
find now, as the Christians then did, Matter for Thanksgiving.</P>
<P>For their Patriarch and Martyr St. <HI>Gregory,</HI> on the 9<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>June</HI>
they afflict themselves for his being soaked, Six Days, and on the
Seventh they magnify his more than Human Patience.</P>
<P>Before the Transfiguration of our Saviour on the 19<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>June,</HI>
they Fast, and end that Day with a Feast.</P>
<P>From the 18<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August,</HI> for the Death of the Blessed Virgin,
they have instituted six days of Mourning, and the next after is a
Thanksgiving for her being translated from this Life to a better.</P>
<P>On the 17<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>September</HI> they reiterate their Devotions for the
Dead, which is preceded by six days of strict Penance.</P>
<P>On the same day they commemorate St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s Invention of the
Cross at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> being Empress to the forementioned <HI>Constantine.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Guywark</HI> has a Fast of the same length, and a Feast at the end
of it, on the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of the same Month.</P>
<P>The 17<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>November</HI> they put themselves on distress for the
Health and Safety of their Cattle, to free them from Rot, and pray
for their Increase; this at first lasted but seven days, but it is now so
many Weeks, all which time they keep <HI>Lent.</HI></P>
<P>Last of all for St. <HI>James</HI> they are grievously concerned six days
together, and are content with one day only to Feast on: So that the
Year round there are more Fasting than Feasting-days.</P>

Through all these Scenes, Time keeps jogging on, and <HI>it is ap∣point<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
for all men once to dye;</HI> at which Article the Neighbours and
Acquaintance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fune∣rals.</NOTE> especially those of the Blood, come to bewail and
weep for the loss of their Friend or Relation; when, and not till
then, the Parish-Priest is sent for, that he should pray by him, and
put him into an happy Posture of Departure, by minding him of his
Soul's Health, notwithstanding his Bodily Indisposition; which being
recommended into the same Hands that bestowed it, and having ta∣ken
its Flight from Earth to its assigned Place, there are no Words
made of Anatomizing or Embalming the Body; but washing it often
with Aromatick Waters while it is purified and kept clean, and then
apparelling it as when alive, in its best Cloaths, it is wrapped about
with a Sheet, and bound with Swathings to the Bier, his Arms being
first placed across, over which is thrown a Pall of divers Colours.
The Parish-Priest with his Collegues and others bearing Ensigns of
Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the Chanters singing, manage the Solemnity, and lead
the Way to the Church, no matter whether before or after Noon;
immediately after these the Bearers bring the Corps, when many of
the Funeral Train with Heads hung down, and smiting of their
Breasts, make a dismal Cry: Being entred the Church-Porch, the
Prior of the Convent with his Associates receive the Procession, a
<HI>Vortobeed</HI> being present, who leads the Choir up to the High Altar,
the Body being left on the Bier among the Women, while they say
High Mass, and perform the Office for the Dead. In the mean
time the Relict or next of Kin to the Defunct, uncovering his Face
and throwing by the Burial-Cloaths, with neglected Dress and dis∣shevel'd
Hair falls on the Face of the Dead, deploring the Loss of her
Father, Husband, or Relation, by often kissing his cold Lips, and
piteously lamenting; which is seconded in so mournful a Consort by
all the other Women, that one would think the Shades themselves
could not entertain their new-come Guests with a more doleful
Dirge: Thus she continues, and hardly suffers her self to be pulled
away, till Mass is said, and the <HI>Vortobeeds</HI> are turning towards the
Coarse, when all the Women are driven out of the Church, and
Candles lighted are given to every Man there: The <HI>Vortobeed</HI> stand∣ing
at the Head, the other Clergy possess the Sides, and the Prior
with his Fellows enclose the Feet.</P>
<P>At the Reading the Epistle and Gospel, they change their Cope,
Mantle, and Hood, and Whine them forth; as also does the Prior
when he chants the Liturgy, to whose Key the other Priests tune the
Responses: In the Interim they Fumigate the Body with holy Incense,
and sprinkle it with holy Water; which Ceremonies being ended, the
Bearers are ready to carry the Body to the Burial-place, far from the
Town; before which only one <HI>Vortobeed</HI> with the Parish Priests in
course, and their Clerks with Tapers lighted compleat the Exequies,
and commit it to the Ground: As if they had respect to the Law of
the Twelve Tables, <HI>Mortuum infrà Ʋrbem ne sepelito, neve urito:</HI>
Though more truly to the Emperor's Commands, who has granted
them Ground for that purpose, with a strict Injunction to bury no
where else.</P>

Those whose Cowardice has made their Lives uneasy either by
Temper or Misfortune, and thereby precipitated their Deaths by
laying Violent Hands on themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Burial of Self-Murder∣ers.</NOTE> are reproached with this odd
distinction in their Funeral from other Mortals; in what part of the
House soever they are found to commit this Self-Murder, there the
Wall is broken down to make a Passage to their Graves; signifying
thereby, That if they would not expect the common Period of Life
with other Men, they ought to be carried forth by an unaccustomed
Way, and not through the Doors of the House, throwing them un∣concernedly
and unpitied into any Pit, like the Burial of a Dog,
without any Solemnity.</P>
<P>Thus having dispatched the Formalities attending every Stage of
Life, something ought to be mentioned of the Excellencies of their
Minds and Faculties, and how far qualified in common with the rest
of Mankind. In order hereunto first may be considered their Pro∣pensity
to Languages, they making <HI>Syriac, Arabic, Turkish,</HI> and
<HI>Persian,</HI> their own at Home; and by <HI>Lingua-Franca</HI> become conver∣sant
with most of the <HI>Western</HI> Foreigners; which Language is a Mix∣ture
of <HI>Portugueze, Italian, French,</HI> and <HI>Spanish,</HI> and thereby made
intelligible to <HI>European</HI> Traders as universally as <HI>Latin</HI> to the Gentry
and Scholars: So that it has often been Matter of Wonder to hear a
Merchant disown any Skill in the above recited Speeches, yet con∣verse
severally with those of each Nation.</P>
<P>They as much hate the <HI>Greek</HI> Language as their Church, although
they derive their <HI>Armenian</HI> Elegancies from its Themes. But what
cannot Religion persuade? Because they have dissented in Opinions,
therefore do they abhor the very Words of the <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>In Philosophy they utter some Specious and Trifling Things, but
nothing Pithy or Nervous.</P>
<P>Some things they boast of Antiquity:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Anti∣quity.</NOTE> For <HI>Armenia,</HI> famous here∣tofore
for many notable Transactions, owns <HI>Japhet</HI> as its first Foun∣der
and Planter; or, as others will have it, to grow from <HI>Aram</HI> the
Son of <HI>Sem:</HI> However, it is certain that after the General Deluge it
was inhabited by the Sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> and it afforded Landing-place
for all Living Creatures after their Transport from the Ark, accord∣ing
to the Literal Sense of the Divine Testimony;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 8. 4.</NOTE> <HI>And the ark rested
on the twenty seventh day of the seventh month, on the mountains of Ar∣menia;</HI>
that is to say, on the Mount <HI>Ararat;</HI> which we know admits
of a large Interpretation.</P>
<P>It contains in it <HI>Iberia, Albania,</HI> and <HI>Colchis;</HI> which latter, as it
abounded in the days of King <HI>Aegeas</HI> with Massy Treasures, which
occasioned that perilous Voyage of the <HI>Argonauts</HI> under <HI>Jason,</HI> for
the Golden Fleece; so now it remains fruitful in all manner of Na∣ture's
Riches, flowing with Milk and Honey, and stored with Pa∣stures,
Corn, Woods, and Cattel; but I hear of no other Discove∣ries
either of Gold or Silver made there since.</P>
<P>Their Country formerly enjoyed mighty Kings and Potentates, and
some the most Pious in Story; among whom <HI>Abagares</HI> is related to
have wrote an Answer to an Epistle of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ; which thing, whether a Figment or no, is not in my Power
<PB N="284" REF="162"/>
to determine: Yet thus much I am sure of, that neither Riches, Ho∣nour,
or High Birth, make any either happier or better, unless this
World's Goods be seasoned with a Mind endued with Virtue, and
Moderation suitable to such extraordinary Benefits.</P>
<P>The next Neighbours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Georgians</HI></NOTE> if not the same with the <HI>Armenians,</HI> were
the <HI>Iberians,</HI> now called <HI>Georgians,</HI> who underwent the same Cala∣mities
with them; but with a contrary Disposition of Humour, be∣ing
a Martial People bred up to the Wars, and now serve the Emperor
as his best Infantry; of these, Forty thousand are at present in Arms
under Military Pay, in and about <HI>Spahaun.</HI> Their Country at this
time bears the Name of <HI>Gurgestan,</HI> from whence they are Christen'd
<HI>Georgians;</HI> not from the famous St. <HI>George,</HI> but because they follow
Husbandry, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. They were converted to the Christian Faith
near the same time with the <HI>Armenians;</HI> which they still retain,
and maintain their State and Country; but both Christianity and
their Country are past their Vertical Point, and are upon their De∣clension.</P>
<P>Their Princes, to uphold their Prerogative, are inclined to
submit to the <HI>Persian</HI> Yoke with the Ignominy of Apostatizing, ra∣ther
than by a stout defiance resist the Temptations and Allurements
of Government under the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Bestiality: Such Power has the
Ambitious Thirst of Rule.</P>
<P>They are Proper, Fresh-colour'd, Well-limb'd People: Their Wo∣men
so Fair and Beautiful, that the Queen-Mother is always of the
Family of the <HI>Georgian</HI> Princes; and for that reason is it their Chil∣dren
are so often sold to Insidels, because they make good Markets
of them. <HI>Mars</HI> has the Ascendent over this Nation, as <HI>Mercury</HI> has
over the <HI>Armenians.</HI></P>
<P>There is therefore an inveterate Contrariety of Tempers between
them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a different humour from the <HI>Armenians.</HI></NOTE> and since the <HI>Armenians</HI> deserted the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, this
Breach is widen'd; being impatient at the performance of each
others Services in the Churches, the <HI>Georgians</HI> frequently interrupt∣ing
them in their Devotions, and doing despite to their Altars on
their most Publick Solemnities: Such Absurdities does Religion in∣troduce,
which should be the only means to cement and unite Man∣kind
in the Bond of Humanity.</P>
<P>The Blame whereof must chiefly lye at the doors of their Pre∣lates,
whose Obstinacy and Perverseness, abdicating all Force of
Reason, are guided by no other Impulse than the present Enjoyments
of this Life, and keep on foot particular Piques and Animosities,
purposely to distract and vex the Church, thereby to carry on their
own Interest or Ambition: Otherwise, how should it come to pass
that those baptized under the same Symbol, and in many (and the
most difficult) Points of Religion are agreeing, should not be all of
one Mind in every respect, unless the Idle. Dreams and Malicious
Practices of the Inorthodox should inculcate Debates and sow Divi∣sions,
only to be Head of a Party?</P>
<P>On which occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How far the Pope is con∣cerned here.</NOTE> whether the Pope hath been aiding or studi∣ous
to compose these Differences, I know not: But sure I am, as it
is the Duty of a good King, that would avoid the Imputation of a
Tyrant, so to govern, that the Laws as well as Arms should be a Safe∣guard
<PB N="285" REF="162"/>
to his People that have intrusted themselves to his Protection,
not only to defend them in time of War, but conserve them by
those wholsome Sanctions in time of Peace; so is it the Office of
the Chief Pastor to instruct the People committed to his Charge,
with the saving knowledge of sound Doctrine, and then by an Ex∣emplary
and Christian Conversation, to pray for the Expiation of
their Sins by the Death and Merits of our Saviour Christ, the only
acceptable Sacrifice on that score, incontinently imploring an
happy and perpetual Union of the Mystical Body of the Church
Militant here on Earth, and persisting in an holy Presidency all the
days of his Life: By which method they will clear to the World
what is their end, as the Apostle did, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>6. when he told the
<HI>Corinthians</HI> he sought not their Earthly Substance, but their Eternal
Welfare. And were this the design of either the Pope or their Pa∣triarchs,
we could not find fault with the Emissaries of the one, or
the Conduct of the others compassing Sea and Land to make Prose∣lytes,
but for having gained them they become sevenfold worse
Children of the Devil than before.</P>
<P>Nor, to speak truth, are the Popelings slothful in these Parts: At
<HI>Jelfa</HI> is a College of the Jesuits; and both in <HI>Georgia</HI> and <HI>Armenia</HI>
they have had many Monasteries beyond the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea, as far as the
<HI>Chersonese,</HI> looking towards <HI>Scythia,</HI> at the City <HI>Theodosia,</HI> now cal∣led
<HI>Caffa;</HI> but these Places being over-run with the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per∣sians,</HI>
they were expelled thence by the Cruelty of the Heathens on
one hand, and Persuasion of the Hereticks of the several foremen∣tioned
Sects on the other, that they were at last crowded into the
Province only of <HI>Nockshuan</HI> in the greater <HI>Armenia,</HI> three days
Journy from <HI>Erewan;</HI> where are only left in Ten poor Villages as
many starveling Convents of the Order of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> settled
by Bishop <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> sent out by Pope <HI>John</HI> the 22<SUP>d</SUP>, to reconcile
the <HI>Armenians</HI> to that See.</P>
<P>But he could obtain no more than the reducing his own Order to
that Obedience; which lest they should be wholly extirpated, the
succeeding Popes provide for them Eleemosynaries by way of <HI>Goa:</HI>
Besides these, some say the Pope defrays the Charges of those at <HI>Spa∣haun,</HI>
of whom we have spoken before; from whence it is needless,
if they be content with what may serve to be instrumental to honest
Studies, for the King is their Almoner. And as he is bountiful to
these for their seeming Integrity and pious Behaviour, so he is muni∣ficent
to the Handicrafts-men which come from <HI>Europe;</HI> to these he
has given large Salaries, and graceful Houses in <HI>Jelfa,</HI> besides their
peculiar Offices at Court, where they attend when in waiting.</P>
<P>All these when they encounter one another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of Salute.</NOTE> pay the Civility
of uncovering the Head, but salute the <HI>Moors</HI> after their own
manner.</P>
<P>Besides these Christians in <HI>Jelfa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nunneries at <HI>Jelfa.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Rhipsima</HI> has her Devotes, who
live in a Nunnery, and vow Virginity all their Life; they are about
Forty, and profess Poverty for Christ's sake, having nothing but
what they get by begging; they go in Black Hoods over a
Blue Vest.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="163"/>
Here are two other Orders that are more recluse, resembling <HI>San∣cta

<P>HAving been taken up thus long among the <HI>Armenians,</HI> we in
our Return cannot but take notice of the famous Walk be∣tween
the two Cities of <HI>Jelfa</HI> and <HI>Ispahaun:</HI> It is planted with two
Rows of Sycamores (which is the tall Maple, not the Sycamore of
<HI>Alkair</HI>) upwards of two Miles: It is called the <HI>Chaurbaug,</HI> from
Four Gardens belonging to the Palace, opposite one to another;
these take up all the Ground on the side of the Bridge towards <HI>Spa∣haun;</HI>
on the other side, Seats of Noblemen and Great Ministers of
State grace the Way up to the biggest of all, the Emperor's, which
is at the End of this Stately Place, over-looking with a pleasant Pro∣spect
all the rest up to the Palace-Gates, which are directly answer∣ing
the Majestick ones of this Garden, they fronting one the
other.</P>
<P>Over the Portal are curiously painted Men and Women in <HI>European</HI>
Dresses:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Garden at the end of the <HI>Chaurbaug.</HI></NOTE> From the Entrance up to the Mountains, Marble Steps make
the Ascent easy, which Nature had framed difficult enough other∣wise;
up which the Limpid Streams are forced to send their Currents
through Five several Channels laid with Marble, two at the feet of
the Sycamores, which railed in two Foot pads, and ran immediately
to the River; the other three emptied themselves into the Tanks,
to which two Stone Causeways gave an Even Walk to Foot-men,
by the middle Channel parting them, and at every Tank ascended
or descended by Marble Grades, while the Horse-way was sloped
for their Passage, entring on one side, and coming back the other;
and every Two hundred Paces, Bathing-places of a large Circumfe∣rence
receive great plenty of Water from the three Channels in the
middle, into which the Marble Steps go down to the Bottom, which
is paved with a cleanly Floor of the same Polished Stones; and this
is begun from the beginning of the <HI>Chaurbaug,</HI> whence it descends
to the River, and thence rises the same height to the End of the Gar∣den:
In the Garden its self, variety of Green Trees flourishing,
sweet Odors smelling, clear Fountains and Rivers flowing, charm
all the Senses; nor is there less surprizal at the ravishing Sight of
the delicate Summer-houses by each Pond's side, built with all the
Advantages for Recreation and Delight.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="163"/>
In a Wilderness beneath this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. VII.</NOTE> are kept the Bears, Leopards, and
Lions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild Beasts for the Empe∣ror's Diversi∣on.</NOTE> belonging to the Emperor: And from this place up to the
Palace Gate, are seen every Evening all the Gentry of the City
Riding to and fro with Hawks on their Fists; managing their Steeds,
making of Matches for Shooting, Hunting, Coursing, or Hawk∣ing;
shewing their Gallantry in Apparel and Retinue, as well as
disposition to Sport; being as much frequented as our <HI>Hide Park,</HI>
and for as little purpose, only to fee and be seen, though the whole
pretence be to take the Air.</P>
<P>Near these Ponds, or <HI>Tanks,</HI> are Coffee-Houses, which furnish
them when they dismount, with Coho, Tea, or Sherbets; while they
sit in State, and smoak Tobacco with their Attendance about them.</P>
<P>The adjacent Houses, Orchards, and Gardens, may be truly said
to be in the Virge of the Court, many of them serving only for the
Emperor to shift with his Seraglio, while the other Apartments are
Aired; though the great <HI>Divan,</HI> or Council be always held in that
place respecting the <HI>Midan,</HI> or <HI>Pomoerium,</HI> in the heart of the City;
and the rest are but given during Pleasure, to the chief Officers at
Court: Wherefore reckoning all these Dwellings as Appendices
(which indeed they are) few Monarchs will appear to have a larger
extent to hold their Court in, it being above a Third part of the
whole City; which being granted, it will not be hard to imagine so
Great and Absolute a Potentate should be Courted by all the World,
and from all the parts of the Earth the wonderful Works of the
Creation should be brought as Honorary Presents; nor can it be sup∣posed
that so wide and spacious a Palace should not afford room for
more than the ancient Ark, though not freight with Pairs of all the
Species, yet more of several.</P>
<P>Whence it is, that here is to be seen more readily, and with less
hazard, the Offspring of most Soils, except Human, and the Creatures
of every Nation, rather than the Women of this Court, which are
at less liberty than the Beasts, being Cooped up in their Sties, more
strictly than these are kept in their Dens; many of the fiercest and
untamedst of these being allowed only to breath in the open Air as
Nature Ordained them: But not to tire my self, nor you with Parti∣culars,
I shall only mention what were strange to me.</P>
<P>The first whereof was the Rhinoceros,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rhinoce∣ros, not the <HI>Indian Ouager.</HI></NOTE> who is a Cruel Beast,
of a large Size, there coming from his Nose an Horn a Cubit
long, (Brown towards the Bottom, Whiter near the Point)
and Six Inches Diameter, whence the derivation of his Name from
<HI>Pìv, Nasus,</HI> a Nose, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Cornu,</HI> an Horn; between this Ani∣mal
and the Elephant, is a mortal strife, for which Nature seems to
have armed it on purpose; it being a Four-footed Beast, with Three
Partings of the Hoof, built on thick strong Thighs, but short, con∣sidering
the great bulk of its Body which presses them; it is Tall
enough to reach the Bowels of its Antagonist with its Horn, with
which it Gores him to Death; nor has she given him less firm Bones
to the Trunk, if by chance it should be crushed by the Elephant, de∣fending
its very Hide with a Coat of Mail; wherefore before on the
Neck and Shoulders, and behind in the Quarters, the Skin lies in
Folds, like Fish Scales, over one another; the Face bears much of
<PB N="288" REF="164"/>
an Hogs Countenance, unless the upper Lip, which resemble a
Cows, and the lower, the form of a Whales; the Mouth discovers a
mishaped Tongue, set about with Two rowes of Teeth; it is of the
same Mouse Colour, and Tailed as an Elephant is, and Feeds of the
same Fodder, and is kept facing Two mighty, but lean Elephants.</P>
<P>Whether the Rhinoceros be the Unicorn, I suspend my belief,
since I have seen an Horn turned with Furrows and Ridges from the
Basis to the Point, and Tapering like that of our King's Arms: But
what <HI>Petrus Angelius</HI> relates concerning the <HI>Onager,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Ass,
can have no congruity with this, unless in respect of the Virtues;
for though his Verses are most Elegant in his 5. <HI>lib. Cyneget,</HI> yet the
description is very wide:
<Q><L>—Quos India pascit Onagros,</L>
<L>Jam primum niveo corpus candore teguntur,</L>

His words in Prose are these; <Q>The Wild Asses of <HI>India</HI> are as big,
or bigger than Horses, whose Heads are of a Purple die, their
Eyes Blew, the rest of their Body White; on their Foreheads they
have an Horn a Cubit in length, whose lower part for Two Hands
breadth is White, and the Top, which is sharp, inclining to a
bright Red, but the Middle part is blood Red; of these they make
Cups, out of which whosoever Drinks, neither Cramp nor Falling
Sickness seizes them; nor has any manner of Poison any force, if
that immediately before or after taking of the same, either Water,
Wine,</Q> or other Liquid thing be taken out of these Cups.</P>
<P>That this Opinion is taken up upon the account of the Rhino∣ceros
his Horn, I can certainly verify, and that great Prices are of∣fered
for those that are inadulterate; which they in <HI>India</HI> pretend to
try by the Liquors presently fermenting in them; but notwithstand∣ing
that Experiment they are often deceived by false Horns made
into drinking Cups; thus much is true of the Rhinoceros, but the
other part of it holds not Water; they come from <HI>Bengala,</HI> and are
esteemed terrible and indomitable Creatures: And these must be
(or none) what this Author calls Asses, there being no other
Beasts in these Parts with but one Horn; and I am afraid he is mista∣ken
as to the <HI>African</HI> Ass also, some Writers having called <HI>Africa
India,</HI> which might have been urged in his excuse, whose Skin I
having formerly admired when in <HI>India,</HI> you will easily be convinced
it is no such Creature, it having never an Horn; Two Live ones
were sent hither from the <HI>Abassin</HI> Emperor, as an Expression of Re∣spect
to this Court; which, with other valuable Rarities brought by
his Ambassadors, were lately graciously received.</P>
<P>They are as large as a Mule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Abassin</HI> Ass mistaken for the <HI>Sabean</HI> Wild Ass.</NOTE> but for the exact Symetry of the
Lineaments, <HI>Zeuxis</HI> his Pencil would but faintly shadow over the
lively Portraicture of their Skins, the ground whereof was of a light
Ash Colour, over which along the Back strait black Streaks in Rows
at length reached to the Tail; the Shoulders, Flanks, and Haunches
<PB N="289" REF="164"/>
had the same waving towards the extremity of their several Mem∣bers;
but that which was the oddest was on the Forehead, they had
so many Geometrial Figures, like the <HI>Trapezium,</HI> or Square, in which
the opposite sides are parallel one with another, so distinctly painted,
as at last to fill up a black spot of a Diamond cut in the very Centre
of the Face.</P>
<P>What Family to mix this Kind with, I am at a loss, unless they
be a-kin to the <HI>Onager,</HI> or Wild Ass, mentioned by <HI>Xenophon</HI> in the
Expedition of the Lesser <HI>Cyrus;</HI> the same we read in <HI>Pliny</HI> in his
8. <HI>Lib.</HI> and 4<SUP>th</SUP> <HI>Chap.</HI> where he ascribes them to <HI>Phrygia</HI> and <HI>Lycao∣nia;</HI>
but the Words of the before-recited Author have it thus; <Q>The
<HI>Onager</HI> is a Wild Ass, excelling at pleasure the swiftest Courser;
whose Flesh differs not much from Stags Flesh, were it not some∣thing
tenderer;</Q> <HI>Arabia,</HI> says he, abounds with Flocks of them.
Now nothing can be Tamer than these before us, and therefore un∣likely
to be the Wild ones of <HI>Xenophon</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> but are most assu∣redly
the Breed of <HI>Africa;</HI> however <HI>Petrus Angelius Bargaeus</HI> comes
pretty near the Mark in this, though not the other; however he is
mistaken in the Place, as well as the Race of both:

Hence we were carried to the Ducking Ponds, where Swam Out∣landish,
as well as Native Wild Fowl; and thence to the Aviaries,
where Nature presents not only divers Species, but she has plaid the
Wanton, even in diversifying those of the same Kind, either adding
or diminishing, as she was provided with Matter; some Birds having
more Feet, Wings, or Bills, than belongs to the wonted Frame of
the same sort; others again, are deficient in the Parts usually be∣stowed
on the Individuals of the same Race, some exceeding, and
others wanting in Stature. But these being accounted Monstrous
and out of the Road, I shall forsake them to follow a Couple of long
<PB N="290" REF="165"/>
striding Ostriches robbed of their Feathers, which must be certainly
very Glorious; they are of the largest size of Birds, wherefore by
an Irony called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ostrich.</NOTE> as if one should say of a Giant, such

<P>Night drawing on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Flower of <HI>Spahaun</HI> meet a nights in the Walk belonging to the Palace.</NOTE> we unwillingly left these Spectacles, and fell
into a lovely one between these Groves; for now all the Pride of
<HI>Spahaun</HI> was met in the <HI>Chaurbaug,</HI> and the Grandees were Airing
themselves, prancing about with their numerous Trains, striving to
outvie each other in Pomp and Generosity; but come short of those
Incentives to Chivalry that spur on our Gallants; the Graces Adorn
our Parks and Malls Crowned with Virgin-Garlands, whose loose
Garments wave with the flowing Wind, and provoke the Amorous
Spark to list himself a Volunteer under those Banners; whose Maiden
Faces bear the fresh Colour of the blooming Roses on the Lilly
White of their natural Complexion, being wonderfully taking both
in their Shape and Meen; Chearful and Free in their Discourse, but
with an awful Comeliness; Facetious and Pleasant, but with an un∣spotted
Innocence; enough to make <HI>Cato</HI> shake off his Severity
and reconcile himself to Good Nature: Such <HI>Daphnes</HI> as these
(worthy the great <HI>Apollo</HI>) alas! this Cursed Soil knows not the
Blessing of, nor dare they trust them out of Doors; for their fiery
Spirits (like Water cast on Sea-Coal) by the Society of such
Nymphs, would render their Heat more intense by intemperate
Jealousies.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Armenians</HI> had treated us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> Artisans di∣vert us.</NOTE> the <HI>French</HI> Artisans thought
themselves concerned to do the like; that they might not be
thought to live here in Slavery, but in a Condition to Entertain, not
only their Friends, but to equal the highest Flights the <HI>Armenians</HI>
could pretend to; and for the Honour of their King and Nation,
we were called on St. <HI>Lewis</HI> his Day, which they Solemnized with
fresh Devices of Fireworks, Illuminations, Interludes, and Farces;
besides the Extravagances of Banquetting and Carowsing, Drink∣ing
the <HI>Sophi</HI>'s Health, and their Master's, after all the <HI>European</HI>

<P>The next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">River Fishes.</NOTE> with the Noise of loud Musick, we were Invited
by them into the Country to a Fish Dinner by the River side, as of
Mullets, Crey Fish, Pickeril, and the like; for it is not for every
one to feed on Lampry, Turbat, Goldney, or Sturgion, formerly
held as dainty Bits by the Rich <HI>Roman</HI> Gluttons, as <HI>Apicius, Vitellus,</HI>
and <HI>Lucullus.</HI> However here are Salmon from the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and
the Urchin (though not that admired one of the Ocean for its de∣licious
Taste) this being not for Food but Diversion, under the
Hedges and Trees of an Orchard by the Bank of the River.</P>
<P>The sly Nature and cunning Thefts of which Creature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hedge-Hog.</NOTE> though

some <HI>Erinaceus,</HI> of which there are two sorts, and in our Tongue
are called Hedge-hogs, the one with a Snout like an Hog's, and the
other a Nose like a Dog's, both which are beset with sharp Thorns
or Prickles on their Backs; and when they fear any harm towards
them, gather themselves into a round Fuz ball.</P>
<P>In some few places where the Water was purposely pent in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water-Fowl.</NOTE> we
saw some Flocks of Water Fowl, which the <HI>Persians</HI> are skill'd, by
their long▪ Case-harden'd Guns, to shoot flying.</P>
<P>The best Hawks of <HI>Muscovia</HI> are purchased here at great Rates,
nor undeservedly, for they will strike down those <HI>Colum</HI> that are as
big as Wild Turkies, and visit <HI>India</HI> in the Cold Season, eleven or a
dozen one after another, as they fly in Trains like Wild Geese, and
come down with the last themselves: Some of these we saw tried,
which was pleasant Sport: They have some Hawks of their own,
but they are of a Cowardly Breed to these, they teaching the Crows
of the Country to be too hard for them; whereby it is familiar to
give an Hundred <HI>Thomands</HI> for a right <HI>Muscovia</HI> Hawk; of which
they are so great Lovers, that they seldom appear abroad without
one of them on their Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="166"/>
Some of them in their Swoops are so couragious, as to seize the
Heads of Deer or Antelopes, and seating themselves with their Ta∣lons
between their Horns, pick out their Eyes, or doze them with
their Beaks, or stupify them with their Strokes; so that no Hunting
in the World is like it, to see them soaring in a wide Plain where
Herds of these are, (especially if there be these Water-pits for the
Courses under Ground), at once to observe them guarding their
Fronts, scampering with their Heads to the Earth, to avoid the
tow'ring Enemy aloft; sometimes unawares to fall Captives into
these Wells, not suspecting the Danger under foot, so much as
avoiding that which threatens them over head, whereby they run
into Thickets, or against Shrubs and Stumps of Trees, tumbling
and leaping unadvisedly, so that Greyhounds being set upon them,
easily overtake them.</P>
<P>Not by this Stratagem to derogate from their Greyhounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greyhounds.</NOTE> which
are as good as most of that kind, well-shap'd and swift, but shagged
with long Hair, yet for all that are kept cloathed as their Horses in
Winter, and all the Year besides rubbed, dressed, and covered with
lighter Cloaths: The other Dogs are but Curs; they are Strangers
to our Bloodhounds; but have many <HI>English</HI> Mastiffs in good Repute,
which breed, and are very serviceable to keep their Houses, stri∣king
Terror into the Assailants more than a Guard of Watchmen.</P>
<P>Here are no Parks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Woods or Forests about <HI>Spahaun.</HI></NOTE> Forests, or Chaces for Sport, nor Meres or
Decoys for Game, nor indeed Medows yielding Hay for their Cat∣tel,
their Fodder being chopped Straw, and Barley their Provender
all over the Empire; nor are here any Woods more than inclosed in
Gardens, which is unfit for Building or Firing; yet of the tall Ma∣ple
or Sycamore they have slit Boards for their Chests for Wine and
Fruit; neither is there any Turf or Coal, so that Firing is more
worth than Food, being forced to send Camels to fetch it many
days Journy hence, as has been said at our first coming hither.</P>
<P>In our Return we observed several Tombs of the Ancient <HI>Gabers,</HI>
after the same manner as the <HI>Parsies</HI> in <HI>India;</HI> and at top of the
Mountains such Monuments as are on the sides of the Plain of <HI>Per∣sepolis,</HI>
and one more eminent, in Honour of their great Champion,
<HI>Rustam;</HI> but who this <HI>Rustam</HI> was, both their Annals and Tradition
give an unsatisfactory Account.</P>
<P>On the 19<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August</HI> an Eclypse of the Sun made us take notice
of the Alteration of the Weather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Eclypse of the Sun.</NOTE> which was stormy and tempestu∣ous;
as well as the lamentable plight all the <HI>Mahometans</HI> were in,
they supposing that Orb to be in Labour, and therefore by Pray∣ers
and Incantations concerned at its Delivery, all the time beating
Pots of Brass, making a Noise as dreadful as the Day of Doom:
The Eclypse being over, the Weather cleared up again, as also the
Madness of the People was allay'd.</P>
<P>All <HI>September</HI> the Mornings and Evenings were sharp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Suburbs.</NOTE> and the
<HI>North-West</HI> Winds began to bring the Winter's Cold, though the Day-time
was Hot and Serene; wherein we made another Excursion
through the Suburbs on the farther side of the Court, to <HI>Jelfa,</HI>
through new <HI>Buzzars,</HI> finer and better Arch'd than those in the City,
terminating in the Squares of divers Noblemen, who had reared
<PB N="293" REF="166"/>
them at their own Charge and Advantage; whereby they were
more Costly and Neat, broad enough for two Coaches to pass
abreast, though this City is unacquainted with those Carriages; nor
indeed would they be convenient, by reason of the Narrow Streets
within, and Mountains without.</P>
<P>These brought us a long way to the River-side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Third Bridge.</NOTE> adorned with
Dwellings of their Great Men, over which, to the Christian Town,
lay another Bridge, inferior neither for Length, or Elegancy of
Structure, to either of the former two, but much later built. At
the Foot of it is a large Coppice of Willows, reaching a great way
by the Water-side; here the <HI>Jelfalines</HI> met us with their usual Noise
of loud Musick, and led us directly up to a Mountain, where the
Emperors have digged a Grotto overlooking all the City, at their
Retirements hither shading them from the Sun's Violence: This is
fabled to be also <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Throne, as we remarked before in <HI>Duccan;</HI>
others pretend it was projected by <HI>Darius,</HI> but for what end, unless
for a Prospect of this large place hid in a Wood, I cannot guess.</P>
<P>Hence in two days we compassed the two Cities of <HI>Ispahaun</HI> and
<HI>Jelfa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">We were two days encom∣passing <HI>Spa∣haun.</HI></NOTE> taking more Ground by far than <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Southwark</HI> with
their Suburbs, but then the most part is filled with Gardens; how∣ever
I believe them not to be so populous: Yet the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> here
avouch, That more Melons, Cucumbers, and other Horary Fruits
are consumed in this Place in a Month, than in <HI>Italy, France,</HI> and
<HI>Spain,</HI> in half a Year, estimating by Balance of Six thousand Ass or
Mules Loads of them expended every day: For though they have
good Butchers Meat and Poultry, their chiefest Diet is on Fruit; and
if such vast Quantities be brought out of the Country daily, besides
what may be planted within their own Walls, it may be concluded
some Thousands of Inhabitants contribute to the devouring of them;
though it must not be credited what is spoken hyperbolically by these
Citizens, That it is the biggest City in the World, and therefore by
way of Excellency called, <HI>The World.</HI></P>
<P>It is not fenced by Walls, nor has it more than one strong Tower
with Mud Walls, fitter for Butts for Bows and Arrows, than to re∣pulse
a Cannon-Bullet; only serviceble at present to be the Exche∣quer
of the Emperor, where are laid up great Treasures, the present
<HI>Sophi</HI> being an intolerable Hoarder, beneath the Majesty of so migh∣ty
a Prince, repining even at mean Expences.</P>
<P>But leaving him to his Covetous Humour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Changes of the Weather.</NOTE> it remains only to
take notice of the Season at the end of this Month, inasmuch as
Bodies undergo herein the Autumnal Changes, which afflicts them
with Pleurisies, Catarrhs, Hoarseness, Consumptions, Coughs, Ma∣lignant,
Putrid, Intermitting, as also continued Fevers, under this

regard, when it says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <HI>Dispicere

Furrs; and the Sky, which hitherto had been clear (except a little

at the Change of the Moons), near the middle of <HI>October,</HI> wears a

<P>Which I mention only to see what relation it has to what grows in
<HI>England,</HI> and have set down thus to avoid Tautology.</P>
<P>To shut up therefore this Discourse, I shall borrow an Indication
from the Tall Trees growing in a free Air; for from their bending
towards any Point of the Compass, thence is collected from what
Quarter of the Heavens the most forcible and frequent Winds do
come, in what Region soever they blow; so Trees growing near the
Sea-shore, incline towards the Land, but up-land in <HI>Persia</HI> they
grow upright, which shews no constant Winds to have any such In∣fluence;
though from the <HI>Autumnal Equinox,</HI> the <HI>North-West</HI> ushers
in the Wet Weather, to make way for the Frost and Snow till <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI>
yet it is often variable, and veres to the <HI>East,</HI> when it is pinch∣ing
Cold, from <HI>January</HI> to the middle of <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>The first New Moon in <HI>October</HI> brings the <HI>Musslemens</HI> Lent of <HI>Ra∣mazan,</HI>
which hapned on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> this Year, and was the same day
our Agent set forth for <HI>Bunder,</HI> leaving me sick behind. The 16<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>November</HI> put an end to their Fast, and began a Day of Jubilee;
when the Leafs were all dropped off, and the Earth and Trees were
naked; after which, Bodies indisposed sue for a Writ of Ease, and
as the Winter is more piercing, they recover Health.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> locks up all in Ice and Snow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sharp Winter here.</NOTE> and constipates the Pores
of the Earth that it cannot be tilled; the Tops of Mountains are
all capped, and the Sharp Winds and Serene Air make it less tolera∣ble
than in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it being ready to cut you through; though
then in the Sun it is so warm, that the Poor are beholden to it for
their Stores: It seldom snows above three or four days together, but
that is sufficient to load the Mountains, and to fill the Valleys for
many days, before it be dissolved. And then it proves fatal to the
Houses built only of Mud; for whilst they seek to secure the Roof,
many times by sweeping it thence, the Snow melts at the bottom,
and undermines their Foundations, that oftentimes they become
mixt with the Dirt in the Streets.</P>
<P>In this Season Stoves are no less in use in <HI>Persia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Use of Stoves in <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE> than in the ex∣tremest
Cold Parts of the World, by which they cherish the innate
Heat, otherwise like enough to be opprest; which they do after a
peculiar manner: In the middle of a Square close Room, they dig
an Hearth Foursquare (not raised, as in our College-halls), over
which is set a Square, Low, but Large Table, whereon is thrown
a Quilt, and upon the Hearth is only set an Earthen Pot of Char∣coal;
<PB N="296" REF="168"/>
all the rest of the Room is spread with Beds and Quilts, into
which, whoever comes (after his Slippers are put off) he thrusts
his Feet under the Quilt covering the Table; which way, though
it keep them warm, is prejudicial to the Nerves and Brain, by rea∣son
of the Mercurial Fumes arising from the Charcoal; being obli∣ged
to use that for want of plenty of Wood to Burn in Chimnies;
the Conveniency whereof they are unacquainted with, having ne∣ver
seen any Chimney but what is in the <HI>English</HI> Factory.</P>
<P>Their Kitchins are all over of a Smoak like our Malt Kills,
with such ventilating Tiles as they have, they rounding their Cook
Rooms with small Furnaces, such as our Chymists make in their
Laboratories, setting their Earthen, or Copper Pots thereon, not
hanging them on Pothooks as we do.</P>
<P>And last of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A pure Air without Soil.</NOTE> for a final and undeniable Experiment of the
Pureness and Clearness of the Air here, let a Sword, never so well
Polished, (and they have the best Damascened Swords) lie un∣sheathed
a whole Night, or longer, in Snow, or Water; take it
thence and never wipe it, and it shall not Rust: Besides, now at
<HI>Christmas</HI> time the Grapes sold for Food in the Market are so dry
they may be powdered; Carry these individual Grapes down to Port,
and you shall in Four or Five days (short of the <HI>Bunder</HI>) sensibly
perceive them to imbibe the thicker Air, and contract a Clammi∣ness;
which proceeds from the remoteness of <HI>Spahaun</HI> from any Sea,
Navigable River, Lake, or Fenn; the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea being the nearest,
which is Five hundred Miles off; besides its being environed with
dry barren Mountains, whence come fine, rare, and thin Blasts;

<P>THE Agent of <HI>Persia</HI> having left <HI>Gombroon</HI> to go to fill up
the Chair at <HI>Surat,</HI> the Second at <HI>Spahaun</HI> was obliged to re∣pair
thither to take care of the Company's Concerns there; with
whom, I being now Recovered, on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>January,</HI> with a
<HI>French</HI> Chirurgeon in our Company, in the depth of Winter we set
forth for the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf.</P>
<P>We return'd the same way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Valleys filled with Snow.</NOTE> Travelling only in the Day time till
we came to <HI>Esduchos,</HI> where because the Snow had shut up the
Valleys, we were forced to leave it on the right, and go about by
the high Road, not frequented in Summer time so much by light
Horsemen, as now, there being no Passage the other way; wherefore
our Entertainment this Journy is less Hospitable, and the Caravan
generally more rude, it being the usual Tract for Camels and their
Drivers (they most an end providing only for themselves) and better
Guests being seldom or never expected; so that in all probability we
might expect to encounter Hardships; but the Silver Bait procu∣red
all things that Man could furnish us with; and we met with no
other Difficulties than what the Weather created us.</P>
<P>Against which we guarded our selves by good warm Furs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We defend our selves with Furs.</NOTE> which
are some of Sables, Fox-Furs, or Sheeps-Wool artificially Crisped, and
others for Servants of Sheep Skins undressed, and their Coats lined
therewith, the shaggy Fleece remaining untouched; and over all,
to prevent the sharp Winds deglubating us, we Housed our selves
Cap-a-pee under Felts, or <HI>Yaupengees,</HI> kneaded into Coats with
Sleeves, with a Scapular to pull over our Heads and Face; a well
fixed Nose being hardly Proof against such cutting Cold. Whether
these Coats we wore against this Season, might not be such as our

little afore our Arrival); and at <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hid,</HI> Six <HI>Pharsangs</HI> more, we
left the Plains on the Hills all along Planted with Vines, to ascend
the piled <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>cae,</HI> now covered with Snow, horribly bleak, and pe∣rilously
cold with frosty Winds, that either Pole might possibly be
more tolerable, they being fenced with Thicker Air, this being so
sharp that it passed our skill to keep our Skins whole; for if the Sun
did favour one side, the other side was shaved with cruel Blasts;
nor did that fare better which was exposed to the scorching Beams;
that had we not been provided with the Pomatum mentioned before
(the Butter of the greater cool Seeds) we had been in a sore con∣dition;
but Anointing our Hands and Face going to Bed, the next
Morning healed them.</P>
<P>At <HI>Conacurgu</HI> we found a Bridge necessary to pass upon the dissol∣ving
of the Snow from the Ridges of the Hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conacurgu <HI>and</HI> Mushat.</NOTE> and tracing the
Mountains, we came in Eight <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sangs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mushat;</HI> notable for the
Scpulchre of one of their Twelve Apostles to their false Prophet;
here we were glad to take up in a Farmer's House, in an Apartment
whereof having caused a Fire to be kindled, where I was to lie, my
Servant, after I was in Bed and asleep, hulking about the Fire, fell
with his Felt Coat, being Drowsy, upon the Embers; which Burn∣ing
made such a smother, that I was almost stifled in the close
Room before I could find the Way out; yet he lay Snoaring and
unconcerned, when I could not get rid of the stench in my Throut
some Days after.</P>
<P>The Day following, we by Two Bridges crossed Two Rivers more,
or it may be the same that run to <HI>Bindamire;</HI> and in a rainy wet
Day took up our Lodgings at <HI>Zevan,</HI> but Five <HI>Pharsangs,</HI> and the
next Day saw <HI>Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>polis</HI> again; entring the Plain by Two Pillars,
upon whose Cornish was delineated double-headed Horses as far as
the Chest; leaving those Ruins <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> so much Celebrated,
<PB N="299" REF="169"/>
despoiled of their Riches, we went through <HI>Meergoscoon,</HI> at the back∣side
whereof the Plain was covered all along with Wild-Fowl, which
were so Tame they would almost permit us to knock them on the
head with our Sticks, not offering to stir till we came on them, they
being not used to be disturbed.</P>
<P>At Night we reached <HI>Zergoon,</HI> through slippery and slabby Way,
and the Day after we brought with us the first Snow to <HI>Siras.</HI></P>
<P>Here we rested Five Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cold Weather makes our <HI>In∣dian</HI> Servants useless.</NOTE> having lost Two Mules and One Pack∣horse
out of Seven and twenty, and One Houshold-Servant out of
Ten that attended us; another we left behind at <HI>Moxutebeggy,</HI> who
was our Cook; and had it not been for the <HI>French</HI> Chirurgeon, we
had been put to our shifts, he both shooting and dressing most of our
Victuals after the most exquisite <HI>French</HI> Way of Cookery: Nor must
any of us at this time take State upon him; for our Servants, not
used to such Weather, became rather an Impediment than Help to
us; listless, and loth to stir, but always crowding in among us,
cringing, and never at ease but when about the Fire; not to be rowz'd
on any occasion; rather looking for Service from us; by whose
Slothfulness we became as lowsy as Beggars, their huge Shags har∣bouring
such Vermin, and they by no means being to be drove out
out of our Company, but laid themselves a-nights on the same
Floor with us. In this short space the Sun began to recover Strength,
dissolving the Snow as fast as it fell.</P>
<P>Having shifted our Lowzy Companions, they began to brisk up
by degrees, as they felt the Warmth to increase upon them: Here
our Interpreter, a <HI>Georgian</HI> Soldier, and a <HI>Carmelite</HI> Friar, joined us;
(the <HI>French</HI> Chirurgeon being bound for <HI>Bunder Reek,</HI> left us):
And the 29<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>January,</HI> shaking off the hospitable Impertinencies
of such as followed us out of the City, we gained that Night <HI>Bobba-Hodge;</HI>
and the next Day travelled Fasting, for the Execrable Death
of the Martyr <HI>Charles</HI> the First; which something discountenanced
the <HI>Carmelite,</HI> seeing a Table spread, as Customary, at Noon, and
not an <HI>Englishman</HI> to eat a Bit, or drink a Drop; but being informed
of the Reason, he was more amazed, saying, He wonder'd at our
Strictness, since on their Fasting-days they were allowed a Buccado
of Sweetmeats and a Glass of Wine before Noon, and at Noon a
small Repast, and so likewise in the Afternoon, but at Night a good
plentiful Supper: With the latter part we promised we would agree
with him, but for the other we thought there was no great Restraint
put upon Nature.</P>
<P>On the last Day of the Month we found <HI>Caifar,</HI> a pleasant Village,
bearing the first Fruitful Palm this Way, where the Myrtle and the
Orange-Tree is always Green, yielding Flowers in Blossoms, Ripe
and Green Fruit all at one and the same time: Here springs up the
Bell-Flower, Violet, and Primrose; so that we may now sing with
<HI>Horace;</HI>
<Q><L>Solvitur acris hyems gratâ vice veris &amp; Favoni,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ode <HI>IV.</HI> ad Sextium.</NOTE></L>

<L>Or Flowers, which the mellow Earth doth spread.</L>
<L>To <HI>Faunus</HI> now in Groves I do advise,</L>

<P>Which Counsel we took, not out of an <HI>Epicurean</HI> Fancy, to live
merrily, because of the common Necessity of Death, as in this Ode
he exhorteth <HI>Sextius;</HI> but to compensate for our past Labours, and
enable us the better to undergo this troublesome Journy: Here we
indulged in a never-dying Green Orchard, mixing the Flavour of
the Oranges, which are as good as grow, with our new <HI>Siras</HI> Wine,
exhilarating our selves with the true Relish, and Natural Sweets of
this delightful Rural Seat.</P>
<P>But the Checquer-work of this World prepared other Business for
the succeeding Day, bringing us over high Rocks, made plain by
Cost and Pains: Here on the Tops of Mountains we only saw the
Snow; however, the Winds blowing off thence, made us feel our
quaking Joints struck through with horrid Numbness; by which
means nothing more frequently happen'd, than one quarter of an
hour to be seized with shivering Blasts; and when they were over,
the Sun by its powerful Heat another Quarter to scorch our Skin,
exposed to his Rays; by which sudden Alterations, not only our
Hands and Faces were vexed, but our whole Bodies suffered Lan∣guishment,
as <HI>Ovid</HI> before us had tried in his Exile.

<P>After we had run this Gantlope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We begin to lose the Win∣ter.</NOTE> the <HI>West</HI> Winds setting in, the
Season grew more mild, and the 5<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>February</HI> we set out long
before Day, which hitherto we had not done; and in our way found
sprouting between <HI>Bonaru</HI> and <HI>Rhadar, Sanctonicum,</HI> Wormwood,
Maudlin, Tansy, Sowthistles, White Horehound, or rather Hermo∣dactyl,
bearing such a Flower as Saffron, on which the breeding
Bezoar-Goats do feed; the Lilly of the Valley, as also, which is
rare, Grass, or rather a kind of Grass like our Moss, or such as we
see grow among Pavements after a Shower of Rain with us: This
was admired by our Interpreter, as if no Place in the World ex∣celled
this; which must be imputed to the home-bred Temper of
those <HI>Persians</HI> who never stir abroad, or the <HI>nescio quâ dulcedine cun∣ctos,</HI>
which adopts a Fondness of their own: In which I pronounce
these People happy; for they have small regard either to Foreigners
or their Countries, in respect of their Native Soil or Abilities, con∣ceiting
<PB N="301" REF="170"/>
themselves superlative in every thing: And from this Habit
of Affectation, I have often, I confess, declared them the <HI>French</HI> in
these Parts, though they raise themselves a small degree from the
Traditions and Rudiments of the Old World.</P>
<P>In the middle Way between <HI>Pokutal</HI> and <HI>Bury,</HI> we were threatned
with Showers, but got in before they fell: This <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI>
since the time of our being here, is almost Thunder-struck a-pieces;
and <HI>Lhor</HI> has endured the shock of two terrible Earthquakes.</P>
<P>From whence the Air daily thicken'd in the Atmosphere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air grows thick.</NOTE> and the
Sweat began to pour through our Pores, which in a more subtle
Air we could not perspire, though Urine flowed there more plenti∣fully;
for a Thin Air gathers and contracts the Pores, forbidding the
Efflux of Heat or Spirits, constraining the Matter which otherwise
would gently breathe forth, precipitating the <HI>Serum</HI> through the
Urinary Conduits, and separating it from the Blood, either by Colla∣tion
in the Reins, or by virtue of some particular Ferment, accord∣ing
to the Doctrine of the Learned <HI>Willis.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Cormoot</HI> we met a Lion and a Spotted Deer carrying up as Pre∣sents
to the <HI>Sophi</HI> from the <HI>Mogul:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our <HI>English</HI> Mastiffs ma∣ster their Li∣ons.</NOTE> The Lion seemed rather a Cata∣mountain,
than such a Majestick Creature as ours in <HI>Europe,</HI> being
nigher a Dun Colour than a Dark Red, without Beard, nor haired
all from the Head down to the Crest and Thighs; about the Lips it
had Bristles like a Cat, and when the Keeper streaked it, it would
make a Noise much the same as a Cat when she purls: These are
kept to set upon Bulls before the Emperor, which they do sneaking∣ly,
coming behind them to leap upon their Quarters, which one of
our right bred <HI>English</HI> Mastiffs would scorn to do; a true Bull dog
being too hard a Match for one of these Lions, which has often been
proved at the Court of <HI>Persia,</HI> to the Commendation of their
Courage.</P>
<P>Hereabouts the Locusts have for these Three Years successively
made such waste, that they are almost famished for want of Dates;
and though this Town used to supply other Parts, they are forced to
seek Sustenance elsewhere for themselves.</P>
<P>On <HI>Valentine</HI>'s Eve, two Days before we could see the Sea, we per∣ceived
its Stench, the Sun being up some time every day, before he
could dispel the Vapours raised thence.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Agent came to us at <HI>Band Ally,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Returned to <HI>Gombroon▪</HI></NOTE> before the Cock∣crow
on the 15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>February,</HI> and at Noon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commodore
welcomed our Return, and conducted us to <HI>Gombroon</HI> from the <HI>Caun</HI>'s
Garden; as did all the Merchants congratulate our Arrival, as well
as all the Ships in the Road saluted us upon our entring the Factory.</P>
<P>Since our Departure from <HI>Gombroon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> President af∣fronted by the <HI>Caun.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Caun</HI> has been playing his
Pranks, having expended vast Sums to buy off his former Offences
and Rapins committed in his Government, and endeavouring now by
unjust means to reimburse himself: Wherefore no sooner was our
Agent come to Port, but he caught our Broker, a Rich <HI>Banyan,</HI> and
clapt him into Prison, contrary to the Royal Mandat granted him,
extorting from him Five hundred <HI>Thomands,</HI> denying Leave for our
Agent in the mean time to go Aboard Ship, in order to embark for
his Presidency at <HI>Surat;</HI> begirting the House with Soldiers, lest he
<PB N="302" REF="171"/>
should clancularly get away, as he had plotted, and which at last he
did, adorning the first Step to his new Province with a foul Dis∣grace;
when he might have done more honourably as the <HI>Dutch</HI> did,
by defending their House, and driving away the Guards, keeping
their Broker safe in their House, sending a Courier on purpose to ac∣quaint
the Emperor; with Orders to let him know, That if this
<HI>Caun</HI> were not removed, he must give them License to be gone.</P>
<P>Whilst these things were transacting, Two Stout Ships from <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI>
well appointed with Men and Arms, came before <HI>Gombroon,</HI>
when the <HI>Caun</HI> began to comply; and our Two Ships sent to fetch
the President, sneak'd away, doing nothing. Upon our Arrival at
Port the <HI>Flemish</HI> Ships were braving it in the Road, and the <HI>Caun,</HI>
to hinder our protesting against his Proceedings, was very humble,
and sent to let us understand he would upon the <HI>English</HI> Account
submit to any thing: Wherefore to avoid being deluded by his pre∣tended
Friendship, which we were not strong enough to affront; and
fearing we should have been used as Properties to an Arbitrament,
we feigned Excuses to leave the Town for <HI>Asseen.</HI></P>

<P>The Story is this: Having cruelly butchered one of these Hea∣thens
to possess himself of his Wealth, by ripping up his Belly, inso∣much
that his Entrails issued forth with his Blood, he was so brutish
and hard-hearted as to sport at the Misery of this helpless Wretch,
fallen into the bloody Hands of this Merciless Hellhound: His Friends
not being able to deliver him by Force, made use of a directer way
to Revenge, and engaged by their Money the great Favourites at
Court; thinking no other means so proper to restore to them the
Loss of their Assassinated Relation, as by procuring the Overthrow
of the <HI>Caun:</HI> Which while they were endeavouring, and had cast
him under a Cloud, yet they failed in that Power, whereby he was
able to fight against them with their own Weapons, he squeezing
them here, while the Great Men drained them like Courtiers, let∣ting

nor were we less taken with productive Nature, that lets not the

our Minds, this being the moderatest Season, so we had some pleasure
afforded for the exercise of our Bodies, as Hunting the Wild Boar,

stinking like that Water the Mariners call Bilge Water; their Taste

of Particles, in greater or lesser quantities▪ or in different places,
<PB N="305" REF="172"/>
as they flow through the several Caverns or Cavities, so they partake
of several conditions in their passage; which distinguishes them,
as Sea-Water, River-Water, Rain-Water, Spring-Water, Well-Water,
Salt, Bitter, Vinous, or Warm Waters, deriving their
Name <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, constantly arising Hot out of the Ground from
the nearness of some Hot Minerals; and for this reason it is almost
all of them have an Hot and Dry quality, whereby they help
Moist and Cold Tempers most of all; which Faculty <HI>Platerus</HI> at∣tributes
to the nature of Lime; which leans on the Sentence of
<HI>Aristotle,</HI> who in his <HI>Second Part, Chap.</HI> 2. says, there is left in Lime
a kind of Mother, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Adusta fere omnia habent aliquid cali∣ditatis,
ut calx, cinis, &amp;c.</HI> Almost all Burnt things have remaining in
them something of Heat. But to let that pass as not being much to the
purpose: All Waters, in general, participate of the Mixture and
Nature of those Places through which they take their Current,
though all do not alike strike the Senses, because some have a lesser
Tincture than others; and Heterogeneous Particles confounded, or
confused, in a larger Vehicle, are not so easily perceived by the
Tongue; which proves no more than this, That whatever Water
has a singular propriety from the common Water, must come under
the denomination of Mineral Water.</P>
<P>Which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mineral Wa∣ters distin∣guished from Common.</NOTE> with <HI>Varenius,</HI> we draw from a threefold Fountain, <HI>viz.</HI>
from Corporeal, Spiritual, and a Mixture of either; those which
run through Subterranean Meanders, in which the Metalline Earths
are not over dense, they carry with them the Grains of those Mi∣nerals,
and therewith beget the first Corporeal Waters.</P>
<P>If the Ores are less dense, as Vitriol, Sulphur, and Salts, which
dissolve of themselves in Water, these create the second Class of Cor∣poreals,
or Mixed.</P>
<P>And those in their passage which are impregnated with the Fumes
of these Minerals, are, as it were, rectified Spiritual Waters, and
make the most refined Order of them all.</P>
<P>Out of these Three proceed Mineral Waters, which are either
Golden, Silver, Tin, Lead, or Iron, Waters; Waters of common
Salt, Aluminous, Vitriolated, Bituminous, Sulphurious, or Anti∣monial:
Waters of several Earths, Stones, Lime, Chalk, and
Ochre, Cinnabar, Marble, Alabaster, and last of all, Mercurial
Waters.</P>
<P>The differences are to be referred to the individual Species of every
Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their differ∣ences.</NOTE> as far as relates to their Essence; but because to inferior
Capacities such do not so readily occur, they are made more familiar
by Sower, Bitter, and the like: The Explanation whereof, both as
to their Causes and Generation, is the Business in hand.</P>
<P>Sea-Waters, Salt or Bitter (Bitterness being only an exalted de∣gree
of Saltness) come rather from the Pores through which they
are strained, than from the grosser Particles remaining after the heat
of the Sun has Boiled off the Flegmy parts: Rain-Waters extracted
by Rarefaction, are again Condensed, and become Sweet in their
falling: River-Waters vary according to their Colour and Taste
from the Qualities of those Conduits through which they take their
Course, as do Spring-Waters, which have a double Origination;
<PB N="306" REF="173"/>
either from the Deep, or from Above; the one from the Ocean, the
other from Snow or Rain; for by an obscure Conveyance, the Wa∣ter
of the Sea issues through the Bowels of the Earth, leaving both
Salt and Bitter Taste behind, and forces it self in nature of a <HI>Syphon</HI>
up to the highest Clifts, as is demonstrated by those Hydraulick En∣gines
commonly known among us, supposing at the same time the
Sea to equal the Tallest Peak the Land can brag of.</P>
<P>Sower Waters have for their Progenitors Vitriol and Alum, (not
the Smoke of Sulphur) either of which are imbued with Acidity or
Acerbity, whereas Sulphur enjoys neither; which is found true,
however the Chymical Spirit of Sulphur drawn off, as also of Salt,
become so sharp. But to obviate that, If Sowerness must be beholden
to the Sulphurious Vapours, how comes it to pass that all Hot Baths
have not that very Taste? Which both sufficient Authority and Ex∣perience
prove to have their Entity from these Two Causes.</P>
<P>1. By the Admixture of Sulphurious Effluviums, while the Water
creeps through these Mines, for to break out of the Fountains from
which they are strained.</P>
<P>2. From Fumes, Vapours, or Exhalations, within the Earth,
where the Brimstone is Pure or Impure, as from Pit-Coals, Am∣ber,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But these Waters of <HI>Genoe,</HI> as far as I could gather by Spagyrical
Solutions, have to their Sulphur an Addition both of Antimony and
Nitre, whence arise their sweet Salt, and fore-recited Operations.</P>
<P>Besides these Baths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Medical Benefits of their Baths or Hummums.</NOTE> which are rare, there are more commonly
<HI>Balneo's</HI> to be hired at easy Rates; of which I shall say no more than
of the Benefits received by them (not to note the Injunction of their
Law); when Bodies are parched by intolerable Heat, and the Dust
galls and frets the Skin by Travel, then are they not only cleansed,
but highly refreshed by bathing in sweet Water; so that they are
convenient both in Dry and Moist Airs; for in Dry, without these
they could no more breathe, than those <HI>Aristotle</HI> testifies of, could with∣out
Bags of Water on the Top of <HI>Olympus;</HI> and in Moist, they are
as necessary to wash Dirt and Sand out of the Pores of their Bodies.</P>
<P>As for the Medical Intent, many Distempers caused by Fulness of
Humours, or ill-bred Chyme, are expelled by this Exorcism; but
the Grand Expectation relating to Venereal Diseases, is baffled and
defeated by a groundless Fallacy.</P>
<P>On the Day of the Vernal <HI>Equinox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Noe Rose.</NOTE> we returned to <HI>Gombroon,</HI>
when the <HI>Moors</HI> introduce their New-Year <HI>Aede,</HI> or <HI>Noe Rose,</HI> with
Banquetting and great Solemnity.</P>
<P>The Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air moist.</NOTE> which at <HI>Spahaun</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Serene that it leaves no Impurity
upon Metals, is of another Temper here, all things contracting Soil and
Tarnish, be they never so carefully preserved from the daily Increase
of a thick corrupting Air. Which proceeds from the Reign of the
<HI>South</HI> Wind usual at this Season, from whence the Brain and Nervous
Offspring suffer under an unnatural Moisture; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
<HI>Capiti aqua est perniciosa,</HI> Hern. Paraph. in Part. Hyp. Aph. 22. Lib. 5.
Sicut Aph. 5. lib. 5. The <HI>South</HI> Wind dulls the Hearing, and Quick∣ness

whole Body: To which Inconveniences, not only of the Wind,
<PB N="307" REF="173"/>
Sand, and eating of Dates, we may add the constant feeding upon
Fish also, as an Enemy to the Eyes; for by such Food the Body is
filled with putrid Humours, whence proceed Malignant Fevers, Gout,
Falling-sickness, and an Iliad of Distempers. The reason to be ren∣dred
for all this, may be, Because the Strength of the Nerves con∣sist
in a Mediocrity of Heat; for what comes nearest to Heat, agrees
better with their Constitution; but what brings Moisture is most pre∣judicial,
according to the Mind of the great Author of Physick,
<HI>Aph. 16. lib.</HI> 5. Which notwithstanding, as every Nature is disposed,
so it is affected with this or that Disease: For the Fountain of all
Maladies, with their several kinds, spring either from the Irregu∣larities
of Air or of Diet, since we are nourished by both, and can
no longer live than while we breathe and suck in Air, than we can
subsist without Food: Such therefore as the Air is, such are the Spi∣rits
and Humours generated thereby; such as the Humours, such
are the solid Parts of the Body, and in general the whole Microcosm.</P>
<P>By Repletion therefore of the Brain, the Optick Nerves are debi∣litated
and clouded by the Impurity of the Innate and Adventitious
Air: The beginning of the Nerves being filled with Humidity, not
only the forementioned Sicknesses, but Ulcerous and Foul Sores, by
the aptness of the Air at this Juncture combining with other con∣curring
Accidents, make an open Way for their Procreation. Hence
the Maritime Coasts, from the filthy Exhalations and nasty Vapours
diffusing themselves, impress a Dyscrasy, or undue Mixture over the
Mass of Blood: <HI>To wit;</HI> As if the Sulphurous Saline Particles should
be exalted, a Rankness of Temperament follows; by which means
the Spirits are depress'd, and the Blood alter'd into a sickly corroding
Habit, for want of liberal Evacuation through the Emunctuaries,
and so are quite degenerated. As we see, for instance, now daily,
the Clouds hovering about the bottom of the Mountains, so the Hu∣mours
profligated no other way, settle in the extreme Parts, till they
break out into ungovernable Ulcers, Scurvy, and the like.</P>
<P>To avoid therefore the Stench of the Port, as well as Commu∣nication
with the <HI>Caun,</HI> we often exchange <HI>Gombroon</HI> for <HI>Asseen,</HI> which
now is perfumed with Jasmine of all sorts, Roses, Violets, and Prim∣roses,
with other fragrant Flowers; here grow also the Black Hore∣hound,
Spurge, Catminth or Nepe, Liverwort, the lesser Centaury,
Hedg Mustard, Wintercress, Grunsel, Field-Poppy, Broom, Goose∣foot,
Arach, Cichory and Dill: The Barley growing here is now
fit for the Scythe, being their first Harvest. In this Place as we rode
to take the Air through Stony and Barren Places, we met a Channel
of living Waters, brought from the Mountains (whence it breaks
forth) by an Aquaduct, sometimes over little Bridges, some∣times
piercing the very Mountains, at the Cost of the <HI>Dutch Banyan</HI>
(the first of this Tribe of Men that deserves Praise for his Contempt
of Money, lavished in many Places for the Publick Utility), to the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Garden, where it disembogues its self into a great Stone Ci∣stern,
for the use of the Farms on that side of the Town.</P>
<P>All these Plains bear <HI>Indian</HI> Shrubs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Indian</HI> Plants grow here.</NOTE> such Milky ones as we have
described there; but near the Head of the Channel, in an Hollow
made by the falling of the Water in the Rains, grows Willow-wort;
<PB N="308" REF="174"/>
<HI>Lysimachia cum flore albo quinque foliis expanso è rubescente calice prognato
floret;</HI> which discovers a Participation or Communication of this side
of <HI>Persia</HI> with <HI>India:</HI> But that which farther confirms it, is, that as
in our Way home we made <HI>Nabond</HI> our Road, a Fishing-Town a
<HI>Pharsang</HI> to the <HI>Eastward</HI> of <HI>Gombroon,</HI> on the Brink of the Gulph,
we found two Temples after the Custom of the Idolatrous <HI>Indians,</HI>
where a Devote of theirs had drawn a great Concourse, at the Re∣port
of his Fasting Nine Days; which being ended, the rich <HI>Bany∣ans</HI>
made a Feast and Presented him with Gifts; for which he return∣ed
them an Ear of Grain spiked, in that time Sown before their
Mammon, or God, with a Silver Head, which they bore away as a
thing Sacred.</P>
<P>Here are many Tombs of their Religious Men, who are wholly
devoted to their Superstitions; and because of the diversity of in∣huming
them, I shall give you the manner as I received it; A round
Pit, in fashion of a Well, being made, they place a stone of <HI>Ormus</HI>
Salt for him to stand on, and another weighty one is put on his
Head; a Lamp being lighted, they lay Bread and a Jarr of Water by
him, and give him a Staff in his Hand with some <HI>Deneiros</HI> for his
Journy; then they cover the Hole with Molds, and build a Turbi∣nated
Tomb, without any Hollow more than for a burning Lamp.</P>
<P>Thus as this part bears the fruits of their Superstition, so the
Earth brings forth the Weeds of their Idolatrous Worship; the
<HI>Arbor de Rais</HI> by the <HI>Portugals;</HI> by the <HI>Banyans</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, for the
Reverence paid by them to it, the <HI>Banyan</HI>-Tree: Besides this, this
Soil yields good Mango's, Water Melons, and Sweet Onions, with
that rank Poyson <HI>Dutry,</HI> nighest our <HI>Solanum Lethale.</HI></P>
<P>At our return from our Country Delights to <HI>Gombroon,</HI> we found
it clear of the <HI>Caun,</HI> he being absent, otherwise no Grist was like to
come to the <HI>Shaw Bunder;</HI> for during his stay no <HI>Banyans</HI> could be
invited hither; but no sooner was he gone, than they came to their
Stalls, as Sheep do after the fear of the Wolf is over, to their
wonted Pasture.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>April</HI> Fifteen Tall Ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Portugal</HI> Fleet and our new Agent arrive.</NOTE> with Gallies of

the middle of the same Month, the same Ship that carried off the
President, brought us a New Agent; who being sickly, was willing
to leave the Port with all expedition, to be at <HI>Spahaun</HI> before the

Rocks and Stony Paths; for this, the Company had provided Shooes
for them, which they found more troublesome than is reported of

they set upon the <HI>Rhadars</HI> as they were on Duty in the Caravan

of the <HI>Caravan Seraw,</HI> and assaulted the rest unawares, slaying Eight

Four more were wounded in making their Escape, and died of their

<P>Thus having secured their Prey, they carried it off in the sight of

one <HI>Armenian</HI> discharging a Gun; not one else, either Merchants or

Cowardly Drovers, daring to make any Defence, but resigned
themselves tamely to their Wills, while they rifled and took away
above a Thousand <HI>Thomands,</HI> which amounts in our Coin to Four
thousand Pound in Silver, and are hitherto undiscovered.</P>
<P>I cannot but reflect on this Faint-heartedness with some Astonish∣ment:
Only when I consider the Merchant is Insured by the <HI>Shaw∣bunder,</HI>
it abates something of the Wonder; for he must restore the
whole Sum to the right Owner, it being his business to find out the

<P>Hence we came to <HI>Gerom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diary Fevers.</NOTE> and by labouring in the Heat of the

In this Munsel we found <HI>Aven</HI>'s Mother of Thime, <HI>Mullen, Ro∣man</HI>

for all Wild Beasts.</P>
<P>The <HI>North</HI> Winds about the middle of <HI>May</HI> raised many a Whirl∣wind;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains in the Joints, and Putrid Fevers</NOTE>
and before we came to <HI>Caifar,</HI> we found a sensible Alteration
from scorching Heat to a searching Cold; by which Change, our
Garments that before hung loose about us, are gathered together to
wrap us close; for all which, few escaped without complaining of a
sudden Pain in the Joints; and many were incident to putrid Fevers,
who had indulged too largely on Raw Fruits.</P>
<P>This sudden Mutation of the Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Occasioned as well by the Water as Air.</NOTE> brought not only on Mankind,
but Beasts also, Catarrhs, and Defluctions of all sorts; to wit, from
Hot and Moist (whereby we were bedew'd all over with Sweat)
into Hot and Dry in the Day, and at Night Cold and Dry, by rea∣son
of Impetuous Blasts from the <HI>North East,</HI> by which the Pores
being shut, the inclosed Humours are put into a Fluor; there being
not a Man among us, nor hardly an Horse, but ran freely at the
Nose: Here, as the Air varied, we left off drinking Rain-Water;
which might have some Influence upon us, it being preferred before
all others, as having the Sun and Ocean for its Parents: The River-Water
here is muddy, and is often carried under Ground by Pits,
wherefore it passes not, without leaving some Putrefaction behind;
but the most indigested is Well-water, which is wholly deprived of
the Sun.</P>
<P>Nor must we slip without Remark what happen'd in our Winter-March;
as we there carried the Winter with us, so now we bring the
Summer; for Harvest is beginning every where, where we arrive:
Though here the Barley be mowing, yet the Wheat stands, to en∣dure
a farther ripening, being kept back by the Chill Winds, which
<PB N="311" REF="175"/>
still attend us; whereby we found Fevers of all sorts (except Pe∣stilential)
at <HI>Siras;</HI> Rheums distilling from the Head, Falling down
of the <HI>Ʋvula,</HI> Aches and Pains, Hoarseness, and violent Coughs; as

Spring entring with the <HI>North</HI> Winds, which are Dry, made us re∣tain
that Phlegm; by which means we are followed by pertinacious
and continued Fevers, as well as those that accompany Catarrhs,
from the Intemperament of the Spirable Parts, whereby the Hu∣mour
expressed from the Brain, distills upon the Lungs, by translati∣on
of Evacuation from the Habit of the Body, where it was wont
to perspire; but now those Channels being stopt, it drops from the
Head, to the disturbance of the whole Frame. This Comment
relates only to us; for the Natives make light of such things as we
call Colds, though they are affected with them this Season, but not
to so high a degree as we; for they eat and drink rather the more for
them, and slight them at this time of the Year, but towards the
Winter Quarter they are more cautious. I must confess it was al∣ways
my Opinion, Colds were not hurtful, so long as they keep
within the Bounds of a simple Cold, but rather a means to rack off
the Impurities from the Blood, as the Fermentation of Wines is of
the like Advantage to them; but when instead of clarifying it con∣founds
the Humours, it is then to be taken care of, which daily
Experience teaches it transgresses often; as almost all our <HI>English</HI>
being now down, can witness.</P>
<P>The 29<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Agent leaves <HI>Siras.</HI></NOTE> the Agent, weary of these uncertain Turns of
Weather, proceeded to make Trial of more steddy at <HI>Ispahaun;</HI> but
most of the rest being sick, and the Father Visitador of the <HI>Carme∣lites,</HI>
a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and a good Scholar, having been long grieved
<PB N="312" REF="176"/>
with a continued Fever, and finding no Relief from the Country
Physicians, persuaded the Agent to leave me at <HI>Siras,</HI> which he com∣plied
with, perceiving an urgent necessity on the part of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>In which Stay I fell sick my self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I fall sick.</NOTE> after the Father was recovered;
and before I was got up (for this Sickness had well nigh cost me my
Life, being one of these peevish Fevers), a great Saint, because Rich
and one of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Kindred, prevailed with the Father, who he
heard was restored to his Health by my means, and their Convent
being seated here by his Permission (he being Treasurer of the Pro∣vince,
and as wealthy, though by unjust means, as any in the Em∣pire,
next the <HI>Sophi</HI>), to speak to me to give him a Visit, being laid
up by Debaucheries both of Wine and Women.</P>
<P>The Respect I had to the <HI>Padre,</HI> made me yield to be carried to
his Court in one of his <HI>Palenkeens</HI> or Chairs, at a time I was more
fit to be kept at Home and in Bed; for that all the <HI>Armenian</HI> Chri∣stians,
as well as Foreign, seemed to be concerned, not out of Love,
but fear of this powerful Man to mischief them: Whereupon my
Attendance is engaged, and a Million of Promises, could I restore
him to his Health, laid down from his Wives, Children, and Rela∣tions,
who all (with the Citizens, as I could hear going along,
pray to God that the <HI>Hackin Fringi,</HI> the <HI>Frank</HI> Doctor, might kill
him) play'd the Hypocrites, wishing his Death; the first to com∣pleat
their Expectation of what he might leave them, the other for
his being a Plague to them; as it proved after his Recovery, for they
performed as much as he, dismissing me with a Compliment, and no
other Reward.</P>
<P>After my Strength came again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On my Reco∣very I set for∣ward for <HI>Spa∣haun.</HI></NOTE> though this Blade had provided
for my Diversion at his Summer-houses, (which are built (as the en∣slaving
Friars do on Penances their most stately Buildings) by his
usurped Authority, of the Obligation they had to serve him, as <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>'s
Kindred, and the meritorious Tye he had on their Conscien∣ces
that way, by which means the Emperor has not more stately
Palaces;) yet I refused his Offer.</P>
<P>Tarrying here from the 23<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> till the 6<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>July,</HI> I am ca∣pable
of giving some Account how the Air proves so fatal to Stran∣gers:
It seems to enjoy a Mean between <HI>Lhor</HI> and <HI>Ispahaun;</HI> not so
hot as the former, nor so subtile as the latter; for which reason it
would be generally more healthy, were it not for these <HI>North</HI>-Winds,
which set in every Afternoon, and continue till the Sun is a good
height next Morning: Insomuch that in the space of Twenty four
Hours, there is a Turn from the highest degree of Heat into the ex∣tremest
degree of Cold, which infers the former Diseases (<HI>ad Aph.</HI> 1.
<HI>lib.</HI> 3. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) these last Three Months together
mostly. After these are spent, the Heats bring Health, for no other
reason but because they are constant; which lasts from <HI>June</HI> till <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI>
when these Winds begin their Reign afresh; and according
to the Observation of the 4<SUP>th</SUP> <HI>Aph.</HI> in the same Book, <HI>In singulis an∣ni
partibus cum eodem die modo caloris modo frigoris dominatu Coelum
tenetur Autumnales morbos expectare oportet, hoc est,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>:
Diseases are unequal for Matter, Symptoms, Invasions, Judgments,
and Determinations; which I experienced to be true all this time,
<PB N="313" REF="176"/>
both in respect of Judgment and Ill Habit; for if it happen'd to be
a Tertian, Quotidian, or Quartan, they were all uncertain; the
uncertainty of the Season broke that Vicissitude of Motion and Rest
belonging to the Humours, which interruption occasioned the diffi∣culty
of their Cure.</P>
<P>And now taking the direct Road for <HI>Spahaun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Polygore <HI>and</HI> Aubgurrum.</NOTE> I had joined with me
an <HI>Armenian▪ Frenchman</HI> (a Wealthy Trader), a <HI>Dominican</HI> and a
<HI>Carmelite</HI> Friar. Early in the Morning of the following Day we had
forsaken <HI>Siras,</HI> we made <HI>Polygore,</HI> Six <HI>Pharsangs;</HI> it is a famous Cara∣van
without Entertainment, by reason of bad Water; wherefore at
Night we reached <HI>Aubgurrum,</HI> an old <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI> better provi∣ded
with Water, though the Name of the Place would intimate no∣thing
less, being called the <HI>Hot Water;</HI> this is Three <HI>Pharsangs</HI> be∣yond
<HI>Polygore.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we entred a Fenny kind of Ground, occasioned by the
Overflow of <HI>Bindamire;</HI> over which, Stone Causeways and Bridges
were laid, where convenient, for half a <HI>Pharsang:</HI> In this Way,
though we met not with Towns so frequently, yet we found the
Plain overspread with Husbandmen and Shepherds, dwelling in
Tents made of Hair-Cloth, at the End of the Plain of <HI>Persepolis,</HI>
which we could discover plainly with our naked Eyes, but came not
near it, cutting a shorter Way to <HI>Maijm,</HI> over a Bridge almost con∣sumed
with Age, and Force of the Waters; at which Town, after
sufficient Thunder and Lightning, it shower'd apace. The Harvest
is backwarder in these Fruitful Valleys than whence we came from;
but these kindly Rains plump and clear it for an hopeful Crop.</P>
<P>Two Days after, we took <HI>Imaum Zadah</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imaum Zadah.</NOTE> in our Course, where <HI>Ma∣stick</HI>
is made; the Mountains hereabouts are productive of Wines.
<HI>Imaum Zadah</HI> was another of their adored Prophets or Successors to
<HI>Mortis Ally,</HI> who lies buried here in a Neat Stone Sepulchre; all
the Town therefore belongs to the <HI>Mullahs</HI> or Priests attending here,
and is surrounded with a Wall, having only Admission at one Gate.</P>
<P>In the Medows between <HI>Ogoan</HI> and <HI>Asspass,</HI> we met with two
Troops of stroling Shepherds, moving with their Families, Flocks,
Herds, and Substance, with their Hairy Houses on their Camels
Backs. As also huge Droves of Horses for the Emperor's Breed:
But the most surprizing was to see Corn mowing and newly sprung
up at one and the same time.</P>
<P>Arriving at <HI>Cuscusar</HI> as soon as it was Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reproof of a <HI>Goloomy Shaw.</HI></NOTE> and having laid my
self to Repose, a Courier, or <HI>Goloomy Shaw,</HI> from the Emperor, wait∣ing
the coming in of our <HI>Caphala,</HI> to press the best Horse he could
lay his Hands on, seeing my Sumpture-horse come in, seized it for
the King's Use; which alarmed the whole <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI> desiring
my Servant to wake me, and inform me I was in danger to lose my
Horse, and withal beseeched my Protection for theirs, some of
them being high priz'd: The thing was new to me, nor did I under∣stand
till then my Authority; for none of them durst oppose a <HI>Chu∣per</HI>
or Horse-Post sent from the King on an Errand (which Privilege
is granted only to <HI>Europe</HI> Nations), they being wholly at the Devo∣tion
of their Sovereign, (Foreign Ministers with their Retinues be∣ing
exempted); but seeing me refractory to his Proceedings, he
<PB N="314" REF="177"/>
came to me full mouth'd in the King's Name; I returned Answer, in
that Name I refused to obey him: He persisting in his Demands af∣ter
it was made known who I was, the Servants and People there
were ready to beat him, had I encouraged them; I bad them only
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inder him from taking any manner of Beast belonging to them, and
do no manner of Violence to him. He finding no good to be done
with me, began to terrify the <HI>Caphala Bashee</HI> and his Crew; but I
undertaking their Quarrel, he departed, not without some bouncing
Curses in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language, finding himself defeated of his ex∣pectation,
and was content to make the Villages find him one;
which indeed he should have done at first, had he not hoped to have
been brought off by their mollifying him with Gilt; but missing
that End, he went away with Shame and Fury, while I staid gratu∣lated
with the Thanks of all the Travellers, and on the 19<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>July</HI>
was handsomly conducted by them into <HI>Spahaun.</HI></P>
<P>For the defect of Rain-water this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Want of Rain.</NOTE> this Woody City suffers,
the Trees decay, the River is dried up, Corn is scarce, and a general
Drought invades all things, so that a Famine is mightily dreaded:
For to supply these Wants, Well-water is made use of; which not
being so familiar, by its deadly Coldness defrauds both Men, Brutes,
and Plants, of their Natural Nourishment; whereupon Diseases
ensue.</P>
<P>Nor is the winding Quarter of the Year less contributing, the Ra∣ging
Dog having not only shewed his Teeth, but bit hard, the latter
part of <HI>August</HI> passing into <HI>Autumn</HI> with unsteady Heats and Colds;
introducing sore Eyes, Lasks, spitting of Blood, dejected Appetite,
ill Concoction, Fistulaes <HI>in Ano,</HI> Leprosy, St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Fire, creep∣ing
Ulcers, Tetters, Morphew. Last Years Honour is not paid to
this, for the Trees every where shed their imperfect Leaves, not
bringing their Fruit in due season; so that the Autumnal Tribute
falls short, the Summer going out without bringing things to Matu∣rity,
by reason of the too hasty approach of the blustring Fall;
though the Skies clear up to a Misfortune, whereby <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, from

<P>This notwithstanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heste Behest,</HI> Paradise upon Earth.</NOTE> we are tempted at the Fame of one of the
Emperor's Gardens, called <HI>Heste Behest,</HI> i. e. <HI>Paradise upon Earth,</HI> in
Imitation of <HI>Cosroes,</HI> their former King, to make a pleasant Pilgri∣mage:
It is a sweet Place doubtless, were it cloathed with its Glory;
but as it is, it is a Rich Piece; the Summer-house in the middle is sa∣luted
by two Channels, in which are Ships and Boats to represent a
Naval Scene of War; Swans and Pelicans find here their diversion;
the Summer house is built entirely of polished Marble, the Arch of
the <HI>Cupilo</HI> is Inlaid with Massy Gold; upon the Walls are depainted
the famous Actions of their Heroes; the Tank in the middle is all
of Silver, the Posts are stuck with Looking-glasses, reflecting the Po∣stures
of the Body, and the Figures of the whole Fabrick; an Hemi∣spherical
Turret presses on Four Pillars, which are the main Sup∣porters.</P>
<P>For all this Excess the Poor do murmur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murmurers a∣gainst the Go∣vernment.</NOTE> who have not any Care
taken for their Subsistence; and not only the Inferior Rank, but
<PB N="315" REF="177"/>
the <HI>Patricii,</HI> begin to exclaim against the Negligence of the Govern∣ment,
while those who should provide for them in this Exigency,
(from Provinces blessed with more Increase) instead thereof squander
or sell abroad what should be applied to their Maintenance at home.
In these Straits they find Pretences to cast an Odium on the <HI>Divan</HI> or
Council; and to that purpose have recriminated the Chief Favourite
at Court, laying to his Charge not only the Miscarriage of his Ma∣ster,
but the effeminating and debauching him with Wine and Women,
and enervating him by Witchcraft, (he being neither able to Stand
or Ride); and for Proof of this latter, they had taken from his
Surcoat a Paper wrote in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue, full of Magick:
Which whether true or false, half a dozen <HI>Jewish Levites,</HI> accused
as Accessories, were ripped open; but not confessing in their bitterest
Torments, any thing against the Steward of the King's Houshold,
he was again received into Grace, and intrusted with the Manage∣ment
of Affairs; they having no Redress by this Complaint, but ra∣ther
a Continuation of their Miseries, a sad Cry for Want of Bread
continuing.</P>
<P>Although the Emperor espoused this Great Man's Cause,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Steward restored to Fa∣vour, the Phy∣sician hang'd.</NOTE> at once
to assert his own Authority, and skreen him from the Fury of his
Persecutors; yet another Menial Servant in Disgrace never recover∣ed,
till he had given full Satisfaction to his Revenge; <HI>viz.</HI> his Chief
Physician: He being dismiss'd the Court, lived in Repute some time
in the City, till the Emperor discarded his Chamberlain; when
being informed that this imprudent Physician was entertaining at a
Feast the Eunuch he had turned out of his Service, sent a Messenger
to call his Physician; who supposing it was to be readmitted, spruc'd
himself, that he might be the better accepted before the King, and
went on chearfully, till coming under the Palace-Gate he saw a Rope
prepared to tye him up; which was the Reward he received for his
Unadvisedness.</P>
<P>Amidst these Distractions and Heats, it was no time for our Agent
to move for an Audience; and the Time of Shipping drawing on,
it was convenient some should appear at Port; whereupon I am
again commanded to <HI>Gombroon,</HI> the Agent staying for the Benefit of
the Air, as well as to watch a Time to appear before the <HI>Sophi;</HI>
which was a thing of great Difficulty and Expence to the Company,
by reason of the several Officers of different Interests, employed as
Instruments to procure it, besides the little Leisure the Emperor af∣fords
himself for Business; it seldom costing less than a Thousand
<HI>Thomands</HI> in Fees and Presents. The <HI>Irish</HI> Buckhounds brought up
for that end, were admired and talked of by all, and represented to
be as big as Camels; and though they were young, proved swift
Creatures, I seeing the Bitch in our Journey turn an Antelope, which
none of their Hounds ever came near; and had the Dog been yare,
no doubt but they had seized it.</P>
<P>The Rarity of them is a thing of Moment for the Emperor's De∣light;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Irish</HI> Grey∣hounds a Pre∣sent for the Emperor.</NOTE>
nor may we be less assured of the Terror they strike on their
Fancy, when I shall relate what passed at <HI>Mussaferry</HI> in the <HI>Caravan
Ser Raw</HI> there, as they were bringing up to <HI>Spahan:</HI> The Dog, which
was the biggest, and at other times less voracious, and better con∣ditioned
<PB N="316" REF="178"/>
than the Bitch, being let loose, rambled about the Caravan
for what he could get to satisfy his Hunger; whilst an <HI>Hodge</HI> (one
of their Pilgrims to <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb) who was at his Devotion on
the most conspicuous place of the <HI>Ser Raw</HI> (they loving to be seen
of Men), had placed a Bowl of Buttermilk tempered for his Tooth,
ready by him, to fall to after his Prayers; he bowing his Face to the
Ground, as their Custom is to worship, and there lying prostrate:
The Dog scenting the Bowl, mounted the Quadrangle, and clap∣ping
one Leg on the Neck of the <HI>Hodge,</HI> kept him in that Posture,
while he had made cleaner Work than the Pilgrim, who for fear
durst neither stir nor cry out, lest he should provoke so terrible a
Monster to devour him; but silently passed by both the Affront
(for if a Dog touch them they are <HI>Nigess, i. e.</HI> defiled) and the Loss;
while in the mean time it was occasion of much Laughter to the
whole <HI>Caravan Ser Raw,</HI> to behold the Man of lofty Thoughts of
his own Purity, thus handled by the Beast, and none offering to
step in to his Rescue, till we had called him off; for which the <HI>Hodge</HI>
thought himself obliged to return us Thanks, for delivering him
from so great danger.</P>
<P>At <HI>Moxutebeggy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Robber.</NOTE> as we were returning to <HI>Gombroon,</HI> we met with
one of the Robbers (or one apprehended as one of them) that so
boldly set upon the Caravan at <HI>Chawtalk,</HI> being under a Guard of
Soldiers, pinion'd, and loaded with Chains: He is a long-hair'd Black,
of the Province of <HI>Ketchemacroon,</HI> formerly <HI>Hyrcania,</HI> lately reduced by
the Valour of the now-imprison'd <HI>Caun</HI> of <HI>Siras:</HI> They are carrying
him to <HI>Ispahaun,</HI> to receive his Sentence and Judgment from the
Emperor; it being an Enterprize of that Fame, and so much in
every one's Mouth, that the Punishment is to be as Exemplary, as
the Fact Notorious. Some people more than whisper, as if the ne∣cessitous
<HI>Caun</HI> of <HI>Bunder</HI> were not only an Abettor, but an Accom∣plice
in this Villany: But a Man had as good be out of the World,
as lye under the Scandal of an Ill Name.</P>
<P>In this Passage the Evenings and Mornings were so intensely Cold,
as to fix Icicles to our Metarrhaes, as they hung under our Horses
Belly; although from Nine in the Forenoon until Three in the Af∣ternoon,
it was extremely Hot.</P>
<P>When we left <HI>Spahaun;</HI> Cotton had just broke the Cod, and an
imperfect sort of Barley, sown only to soil their Cattel, was crept
out of the Hose, being as Green as Grass; but as we drew nearer
<HI>Siras,</HI> all was mowed, and the Vintage being over, they were left
common to the Cattel, who fatten on these Shrubs; so that what once
tickled the Spleen of a Philosopher, might here hourly give him
the Diversion, Thistles being their choicest Fodder.</P>
<P>The Forerunners of the approaching Cold are the <HI>Colums,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colums</HI> the Forerunners of the Colds.</NOTE> who fly
in Flocks daily over our heads; these, impatient of the Extremity
of Heat or Cold, take now their Flight towards the Warm Coun∣tries,
and when the Ram ends his Reign, return to their <HI>Northern</HI>
Quarters. <HI>Bartholin</HI> Junior relates something of the Swan, agree∣able
to what I observed in <HI>India</HI> of this Bird, concerning the <HI>Aspera
Arteria,</HI> from whence is conceived the reason of its obstreperous
and loud Note: His Words are these, <HI>Diversum tamen esse situm in

<P>The latter end of <HI>October</HI> we departed from <HI>Siras,</HI> not before my
Customer the <HI>Siad</HI> had sent for me, to desire those Medicines where∣with
he had been so unexpectedly recovered: I delay'd going to him
till I was certain the <HI>Caphala</HI> was out of the City, when waiting on
him I reaped the same fair Promises and Expressions I had done be∣fore;
wherefore I told him my Physick was packed up, and my Ser∣vant
gone with the <HI>Caphala;</HI> he told me he would send a Couple of
his trustiest Domesticks, which were a Priest and another, to the
end of the <HI>Munsel,</HI> which I told him he might do: At my Return to
the Factory, there being present a Number of Christians and others
to attend our Motion out of the City, most thought I had received
a Rich Reward, therefore they demanded how I had sped? I answered,
As I had before; at which one that knew the Temper of the Man,
replied in <HI>Linguo Frank, Foi multo ben ill non tenho terardo voso Chapeo;</HI>
It was very well you came home with your Hat, and that he took
not that off your Head: However, at the end of the <HI>Munsel</HI> I was
not at Leisure to speak with his Messengers, who understanding the
reason, had Ingenuity enough to blush at their Master's unhandsome
dealing with me.</P>
<P>This Varlet, of the Race of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> two or three days before our
Arrival at <HI>Siras,</HI> at the Funeral of one of his Wives, sent Fifteen hun∣dred
of his own She-Slaves to attend her to the Grave, out of his
own Family; so superfluously abounding is he in all manner of
Luxury.</P>
<P>We came into <HI>Siras</HI> with frowning Weather:
<Q>Horrida tempestas Caelum contraxit &amp; imbres.</Q></P>
<P>But parted thence with a suitable Remainder of Autumn; for the
Grapes were in the Press, and the new Wines in the Ferment, yet
the Pomgranats were on the Trees, nor was the Fall of the Leaf set
in: In the Fields were Millet, hurtful to Pullen, but Food for the
Poor for Bread; in the Garden, Wall-Flower, and Violets, Garden
Mallows, and Crocus: For all that, at Night the Cold was severe;
the reason whereof (besides the length of the Nights) is, the Moun∣tains
about <HI>Siras</HI> are rather Stony than Sulphurious; for which
cause we find the Winds blow as sensibly as at <HI>Spahaun;</HI> whence may
be collected, that the Seasons depend not so immediately on the Sun
and its Motion, as from the Specifick Determination of the Winds,
the Aspects of the Stars diversified, the Innate Quality of the Coun∣try,
and peculiar Site in respect of the Heavenly Bodies. As for the
difference of Stars, none here could be observed, distinct from those
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Temperate Zone, by reason of the indeterminate Horizon,
every where occasioned by the interfering Mountains.</P>

The Crows here are like our <HI>Royston</HI> Crows, Grey on their Backs
and Wings;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crows of se∣veral Colours.</NOTE> at <HI>Jerom</HI> their Beaks and Feet are as Red as Vermilion;
where also at our appearance Barley is ripe, and new Barley sow'd;
and as we travelled, we now and then let fly an Hawk at <HI>Hoberaes,</HI>
a Bird larger and of the same Colour with our Kites; at first being
brought to the Ground by the Hawk, it parries, and makes some
false Shew of Defence, brisking up its Plumes about the Neck, as a
Cock does when going to engage; but the Controversy is soon deci∣ded,
after the Hawk seizes it with his direful Talons, and instead
of denouncing farther War, it resigns its self an humble Victim to
the Conqueror: The inward Coats of the Gizzard are stuffed with
Wormseed, of which it smells strong, which dried and beaten to
Powder, and given with Sugar, is a <HI>Panacaea</HI> for an <HI>Asthma,</HI> or dif∣ficulty
of breathing, and the whole Body is delicate Meat.</P>
<P>On the right hand of the King's Highway, between <HI>Siras</HI> and
<HI>Gerom,</HI> at <HI>Derab,</HI> on the side of a Mountain, issues the <HI>Pissasphaltum</HI>
of <HI>Diascorides,</HI> or Natural Mummy, into a large Stone Tank or
Storehouse, sealed with the King's Seal, and that of the <HI>Calentures,</HI>
and all the Noblemen of that City, and kept with a constant Watch,
till at a stated Time of the Year they all repair thither, to open it
for the King's Use, to prevent its being stole: Which notwithstand∣ing,
though it be Death if discovered, yet many Shepherds follow∣ing
their Flocks on these Mountains, by chance light on great Por∣tions
of the same Balsam, and offer it to Passengers to Sale, and
sometimes play the Cheat in adulterating it.</P>
<P>The First of <HI>November</HI> entring upon the Plains of <HI>Dedumbah,</HI> we
found it all frosted with Salt; for the Waters from the Mountains
mixing with the Superficies of the Earth, together with the Sun and
drying Winds, incrustate; nor have I met with sharper Colds than
here, for that the invironing Hills as well as Dales are full of Salt,
and the Sun rising with horrid Winds presses the Ambient Air from
the high Tops by its Circular Motion; so that it hurricanes us with
such dismal chilling Gusts, that had we not been active here in cour∣sing
Hares and Wild Goats, we might sooner have frozen than kept
our Innate Heat entire; the Sun being constantly attended all the
Day with blustering Weather, leaving a quiet Calm at setting.</P>
<P>From this Plain to <HI>Lhor,</HI> both in the Highways, and on the high
Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monuments of Robbers.</NOTE> were frequent Monuments of Thieves immured in Terror
of others who might commit the like Offence; they having literally
a Stone-Doublet, whereas we say metaphorically, when any is in
Prison, <HI>He has a Stone Doublet on;</HI> for these are plastered up, all but
their Heads, in a round Stone Tomb, which are left out, not out of
Kindness, but to expose them to the Injury of the Weather, and As∣saults

the 8<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> all which time it was grievous to the <HI>Moors</HI> to

permitted to eat; for which they plead their being unaccustomed to
Labour; which exempts them from an Imposition they lay on the
more hardy, not touching such heavy Burthens with the least of
their Fingers: Wherefore the poor Mule-men made hard shift to get
to <HI>Lhor</HI> the Morning before the Evening the New Moon appeared
on, <HI>viz.</HI> the 4<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>November,</HI> when I saw the Old Moon go out on the
Hills at <HI>Lhor,</HI> and the Night following, the Horns reversed, the
whole Body or Circumference having only as it were a dark Veil or
Curtain of Air drawn over it, that part alone which was Crescent,
being illuminated.</P>
<P>But it was some Damp to their designed Mirth, when by too much
haste to come to this Capital City, they perceived they had lost a
Mule with its Lading, by driving in the Dark all Night; whereupon
I was employ'd to inform the <HI>Caun,</HI> who immediately dispatched
the <HI>Rhadary</HI> in quest, and before Night restored the Lading, which
was Shagreen Leather, such as they make their best Boots of, but
the Mule was found dead under its Burthen, strayed a little way out
of the Road; such Care is there taken to satisfy Merchants.</P>
<P>This Night passed with great Rejoicing among the <HI>Musselmen,</HI> and
retarded us three Days, before we could make our Muliteers settle to
their Gears again.</P>
<P>Here the doubtful Autumn inclines towards Winter, resigning the
Dates, Citrons, Oranges, and Lemons, to the expecting Planter:
Here grows the Emblem of Peace, the Olive-Tree; and though the
Leafs are fallen, yet here is an uninterrupted Spring, all things keep∣ing
a perpetual Green, though they observe the appointed Times of
bringing forth their Increase.</P>
<P>And now we begin to enjoy Temperate and Shorter Nights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Hot Coun∣tries to the <HI>North</HI> the Year centers in our Winter.</NOTE> in
exchange of Cold and Longer; and although the Goat is not yet
ascended with his Constellation, yet I pronounce it Winter, since all
Terrestrial Things move with a Pace as if they were just almost at the
Centre of the Year; but after the Sun, carried by the rapid Course
of the Heavenly Impulse, in order with the other Glorious Stars, has
reached its utmost <HI>Southern</HI> Bounds, then a new Face of things re∣turns,
and the alternate Accretion and Diminution render an Ever∣lasting
Constancy; which with the admirable Frame and manifold
Courses of the Celestial Spheres, witness and declare, That the Praise
of so great and wonderful Works, are not to be attributed to Chance
and Fortune, but to an All-wise Creator, who constituted the Uni∣verse
from the Beginning, and will govern and preserve the same to
all Eternity; who also brought us safe to <HI>Gombroon</HI> the 13<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>No∣vember:
To whom be Honour now and for ever.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Voyage to Congo for Pearl; a Discourse of their Generation;
Departure from Persia, and Return to India.</HEAD>
<P>TWO days after our Arrival at <HI>Gombroon,</HI> I went to <HI>Congo,</HI> lea∣ving
only the <HI>George,</HI> a Ship our Agent had built, in this
Port; I was rowed in one of their Boats till the Wind grew strong
enough to Sail: These Boats have been in use time out of mind; the
Keel is made of one piece of Timber, and the Planks are sewed to∣gether,
with an high Prow and a low Poop. The next Morning
we had brought <HI>Loft</HI> on the left hand of the Island <HI>Kismash,</HI> leaving a
Woody Island uninhabited between <HI>Kismash</HI> and the Main: At Noon
we came to <HI>Bassatu,</HI> an old ruined Town of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> fronting
<HI>Congo,</HI> where we touched till the Turning of the Tide and the Sea-Breeze
were forcible enough to deliver us to that Port, where were
Five Merchant Ships, and Two Trading to <HI>Mocha</HI> for Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Congo</HI> is something better built than <HI>Gombroon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Come to <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> and has some small
Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antage of the Air, and is about Twenty Leagues nearer the
Mouth of the River <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P>As upon Land we have observed the Fruit and all things flag for
want of Rain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Dearth in the Water as well as on Land.</NOTE> so we found the same Cry to respect the Sea for want
of frequent Showers, the Oysters neither bringing forth, nor are any
Pearls produced; such Influence does common Fame allow the Hea∣venly
Moisture to have in their Generation; insomuch that little
Choice is to be had, and whatever is of any Value, is very dear.
Here is great Plenty of what they call <HI>Ketchery,</HI> a Mixture of all
together, or Refuse of Rough, Yellow, and Unequal, which they
sell by Bushels to the <HI>Russians,</HI> who carry them over Land to <HI>Archan∣gelo,</HI>
and disperse them through the <HI>Northern</HI> Coasts, for Ornaments
to their Furr Caps; which being no Purchase, I returned.</P>
<P>Sailing abreast of <HI>Kismash,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Come again to <HI>Bunder Abassee.</HI></NOTE> I put in at <HI>Loft,</HI> the chief Place of the
Island, and loaded with Oysters, which were the nearest our <HI>English</HI>
I had yet tasted; here are Creyfish, Crabs, Shrimps, Place, Soles,
and Smelts, besides Mountains of Salt-fish for Sale: From hence
<HI>Gombroon</HI> is furnished with Wood; where arriving, we saw the
<HI>Phaenix,</HI> another <HI>English</HI> Ship; on which before I embark, I shall
premise somewhat material, according to my Promise, of Pearls in
general.</P>
<P>The Pearl is a Jewel supposed to be the Geniture of a Shell-fish cal∣led
<HI>Margaritifer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pearl.</NOTE> congealed into a very fair, transparent, Diaphanous,
beautiful Stone, which is the <HI>Partus</HI> or Birth of this Fish. As con∣cerning
their Original and Conception, there is some difference
among Authors, as betwixt <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Anselmus Boetius,</HI> and between
them and <HI>Cardanus: Pliny</HI> saith that they are conceived in Oysters,
by a certain Maritime Dew, which these Fish (and so likewise Scol∣lops)
do at a Set Time of the Year most thirst after; and according
as the Heavens are more Cloudy or Clear in the time of the taking
<PB N="321" REF="180"/>
in of this Dew, so they are generated more Fair, or Obscure; as may
be seen in his Book, where he speaks of those Pearls called <HI>Ʋnions,</HI>
and of the Shell-fish in which they are found, <HI>lib. 9. c.</HI> 28. But this
Opinion of <HI>Pliny</HI> concerning their Conception, is not, by <HI>Anselmus
Boetius,</HI> thought consentaneous to Truth: For, saith he, I have ta∣ken
out of these Shell-fish many <HI>Margarites,</HI> and they are generated
in the Body of the Creature, of the same Humour of which the
Shell is formed; which Viscous Humour is expelled sometimes (not
always) for the Fabrick of another Shell; for whenever this little
Creature is ill, and hath not strength enough to belch up or expel
this Humour which sticketh in the Body, it becometh the Rudi∣ments
or beginning of the Pearls; to which, new Humour being ad∣ded
and assimulated into the same Nature, by concreting and con∣gealing
begets a new Skin or Film for the former Rudiments; the
continual Addition of which Humour generates an <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> or Pearl;
even as Stones are generated in the Gall or Bladder of a Man; and
after the same manner the <HI>Bezoar</HI> is generated in the <HI>Persian</HI> Goat.
<HI>Cardanus, lib. 7. de Lapidibus,</HI> saith, It is a Fabulous thing that the
Pearl should be generated by the Dew of Heaven, seeing the Shell∣fishes
in which they are conceived have their Residence in the very
bottom of the Deep. That which is reported of them, That they
are soft in the Water, and grow hard, like Coral, as soon as they are
taken out, is not true, saith <HI>Boetius, p.</HI> 84. For the first, not only
common Fame, but common Experience avouches; for the latter, I
know not why it may not be as probable, as for an Egg newly laid, to
have the Shell harden'd as soon as dropped into the Air, when before
in the <HI>Ovarium</HI> it participated of a Slippery, Tough, Glewy Sub∣stance;
not otherwise to be supposed to come forth, than by endan∣gering
the <HI>Foetus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ʋnions</HI> are so much the more esteemed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Adultera∣tion.</NOTE> because they cannot easily
be adulterated. There are fictitious Jewels made of double Glass,
which being set in Gold, Jewellers cannot discern from Pearl, except
they take them out: Some will adulterate them with the Powder of
the Shell of the <HI>Margarite,</HI> and others with Chalk covered with
Leafs of Silver, and then anointed with the White of an Egg. Some
adulterate them with the Powder of Pearl mix'd with the White of
an Egg, and dried, and then polished; but these will easily be disco∣vered
from the True, by their Weight and Colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ʋnion</HI> is in <HI>Hebrew</HI> called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Names.</NOTE> as <HI>Job</HI> 28. 20. And so the
Word <HI>Gabish</HI> is interpreted by <HI>Rabbi Sevi Gerson:</HI> It is also taken for
<HI>Margarita,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; but in the <HI>Proverbs</HI> it is interpreted by <HI>Junius,
Carbunculi, Prov.</HI> 11. If they be great, they are called <HI>Ʋnions,</HI> be∣cause
then they are found single in a Shell. If they be small, they
are called <HI>Margaritae,</HI> many of which may be found in one Shell to∣gether.
In <HI>Greek</HI> they are called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
In <HI>Latin</HI> the great Pearls are called <HI>Ʋniones, &amp; Margaritae simplicitèr.

<PB N="322" REF="181"/>
Mutu:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter V.</NOTE> The <HI>Lusitanians</HI> call it <HI>Aljofar,</HI> which in <HI>Arabic</HI> sounds
as much as <HI>Julfar,</HI> the Port in <HI>Sinu Persico</HI> where the most excellent
Pearls are caught.</P>
<P>The kinds of Pearl are no otherwise distinguished,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kinds of Pearl.</NOTE> but either first
from their Greatness or Littleness, that is, either as they are <HI>Ʋnions,</HI>
or <HI>Margarites,</HI> or Seed-Pearl; and secondly, as they are of tran∣scendent
Purity, Beauty, and Glory; or Cloudy, Reddish, and so
less beautiful.</P>
<P>The best are found in the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Places where caught.</NOTE> (shared between the
<HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Arab,</HI> they farming the Fishery yearly to those that bid
most), between the Island <HI>Ormus</HI> and <HI>Byran;</HI> and were heretofore
brought into the Island <HI>Ormus,</HI> while the <HI>Portugals</HI> were Lords there;
whence the Distich;
<Q><L>If all the World were but one Ring,</L>
<L><HI>Ormus</HI> should the <HI>Union</HI> bring.</L></Q></P>
<P>They are also found between Cape <HI>Comory</HI> and <HI>Ceilon,</HI> as I for∣merly
declared; but these are not to be compared with the <HI>Persian,</HI>
which are the true Oriental ones: There are of them in the Island
<HI>Sumatra,</HI> by those that place the Golden <HI>Chersonese</HI> in <HI>Java,</HI> disputed
to be the Ancient <HI>Taproban.</HI> Betwixt the greater <HI>Java</HI> and <HI>India</HI>
there are very many; between <HI>Panana</HI> and <HI>Cochin</HI> are good store,
but very small, as also all along the Coast of <HI>Malabar.</HI> In <HI>Borneo</HI> and
<HI>Anian,</HI> there are great ones. The Occidental are of a Milkish Co∣lour,
and of a Silver-like Splendor, and therefore not so commenda∣ble
as the Oriental.</P>
<P>It is consented to by some, That by how much the deeper the
Shell-fish resides, by so much they are Parents of the lesser <HI>Mar∣garites.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> call the brighter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cheripo,</HI> or Seed-Pearl.</NOTE> candid, or splendid Shell-fish, <HI>Che∣ripo,</HI>
which is a kind of Oyster, of which they make Spoons, or
little Cups: These Fishes do generate excellent <HI>Margarites,</HI> or Seed-Pearl.</P>
<P>There are others they call <HI>Chanquo;</HI> the Shells of which are the Mo∣ther
of Pearl:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chanquo,</HI> or Mother of Pearl.</NOTE> These bring not forth so fair Pearl as the other, be∣cause
their Shells are very smooth and bright within; they are used
to adorn Tables, Escritores, and other things with; they are brought
to <HI>Bengala</HI> for Bracelets and other Embellishments; the Custom
there was to have the Virgins Arms to be set off with Monelaes of
this kind, lest they should be corrupted.</P>
<P>They are also found in many places of <HI>Europe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scallops.</NOTE> as in <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> there having been very excellent ones found in Scallops
and common Oysters, as I my self have found at <HI>Sheerness</HI> in <HI>Eng∣gland.</HI>
They are no Strangers in <HI>Silesia, Frisia,</HI> and <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P>About the Promontory of <HI>Comory</HI> they are found of the Weight
of an Hundred Grains of Wheat, and near the Island of <HI>Borneo,</HI> of
the Weight of an Hundred and sixty Corns of Wheat, though not
so fair as the other.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="181"/>
It is delivered from Authentick Authors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. X.</NOTE> That <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> Queen
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> drank one dissolved at a Supper, of which Draught she
boasted she had a more costly Supper than ever <HI>Antonius</HI> had; the
Value of which Draught then must amount to, according to <HI>Bu∣daeus,</HI>
an Hundred and fifty thousand <HI>Aureos,</HI> for thus much did
one Supper of <HI>Antonius</HI> cost him, as related by <HI>Pliny, lib. 9. cap.</HI> 35.
<HI>&amp; Macrob. 3. Saturnal. c.</HI> 27. The same <HI>Budaeus</HI> doth also mention
an <HI>Ʋnion</HI> of the Bigness of a <HI>Filbert,</HI> which was bought in
<HI>France</HI> for Three thousand <HI>Aureos,</HI> and another for Four thou∣sand.</P>
<P><HI>Solinus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Properties.</NOTE> and <HI>Scrap Hager Alkali,</HI> say that these Stones are cold
and dry in the Second Degree, and that they are good against
Syncopes and Cardiacal Passions; that they comfort the Spirits,
stop Fluxes of Blood, cure Lienteries and Diarrhaeas, and that they
are good for the Sight: The same say <HI>Cardanus, Rulandus,</HI> and
<HI>Baceius,</HI> in their Books <HI>de Gemmis.</HI> But the more Mechanical So∣lution
of their operating, is (as all Conchous things do) either by
precipitating the Saline or Acid Particles, or else as all Alkalies do,
by imbibing the same, obtund their Fury by sheathing their sharp
Points, and so render them capable of assisting such Diseases.</P>
<P>They are of great Worth for their Sacred Use:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Dignity and Value.</NOTE> St. <HI>Austin</HI> in
his Explication of the <HI>Psalms,</HI> speaking of the Twelve Stones men∣tioned
in the Book of the <HI>Revelations, Rev.</HI> 21. 21. and of the
Gates of the New <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which were every one of one Pearl;
saith, That the Twelve Apostles are signified by the Twelve Stones,
and Christ the Spotless Lamb by the Pearl.</P>
<P>Their own Glory, Beauty, and Excellency, surpass their In∣trinsick
Worth: If they be of the Weight of Four Grains, they are
worth Three Crowns apiece; so according to their Bigness, Weight,
Roundness, and Fairness, their Price is raised, doubled, or trebled,
according to the following Scale.</P>

in our teeth, that very Line we should steer. This contrary Wind
detain'd us some days, but the continued Calms more; for in Seven
and twenty days we gained but Nine Degrees out of Thirteen <HI>East,</HI>
and but Three out of Seven in Latitude; nor could we reach any
Shore, or meet with any Ship, whereby we began to want both
Wood and Water; being Twelve <HI>Europe</HI>-men, Seventeen <HI>Lascars,</HI>
Two <HI>Armenian</HI> Servants, and as many Black Slaves, with one <HI>Moor</HI>-man
Servant; Ten Sheep with large Tails, and as many <HI>Carmania</HI>

Goats, for to waft to the Company's Island at St. <HI>Helena,</HI> to create

more than Three Hogsheads of Water left, and Wood for Firing no
more than for six days; nor yet (<HI>Christmass-day</HI> being past) had we
any Hopes of a favourable Wind. This made us melancholy, since
we were already put to Allowance, and all through the Negligence
of the Master and his Mate, who lay Revelling ashore, when they
should have provided better for their Voyage.</P>
<P>Nor had they taken other Care in loading their Vessel, which
being most <HI>Carmania</HI> Wool and light Loading, had required a suffi∣cient
Ballast at Bott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; but on the contrary, the heavy Goods
were upon Deck; which Error when it was too late to remedy, they
perceived, being out at Sea; <HI>&amp; jam seriò de lanâ caprinâ controver∣sia

or not worth our discourse (Goats-wool) becomes a thing of
serious Controversy; therefore it was God's Mercy we were not
try'd with Stormy Weather hitherto: But now we were dilemma'd,
not knowing what to wish, when the Divine Providence sent us a

the Gusts blowing horribly from Shore, we were again drove to Sea
till Night, and anchored very uneasily while Two the next Morning,
when the Tide horsed us towards the Shore, we not being able
otherwise to prevail against the Wind with our Sails; but anchor∣ing

<P>But from our Want there sprang this Commodity; our Water
being well nigh all spent, the Ship was better able to live, her Bur∣then
sinking aloft, and thereby gave occasion to bear a steadier Poise
below, while we expected the abating of the Tempest, in order to
our happy Deliverance; which at last permitted us to come more

<P><HI>PERSIA</HI> by Classick Authors is fabled to have its Name
from King <HI>Perseus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Names.</NOTE> Son of <HI>Andromeda;</HI> it was anciently
called <HI>Elam</HI> by the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and now by the Inhabitants,
<HI>Phursistan.</HI></P>
<P>It is sited in the Temperate Zone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Bounds.</NOTE> under the Third, Fourth, Fifth,
and Sixth Climates: In time of Yore the Monarchy of the whole
World devolved upon it, and which is miraculous, is not quite ex∣tinguished
to this day; although the Bounds of the Empire were
straitned or enlarged, according to the ebbing or flowing of Fortune.
In its Infancy it was mighty, for <HI>Nimrod</HI> was a Powerful Hunter,
that is, a great Prince; and as it grew up it increased in Strength;
but from the <HI>Grand Cyrus</HI> to <HI>Darius</HI> the <HI>Mede,</HI> it seemed to be in the
Flower of its Age, when it was Mistress of all the Earth which the
vast Ocean washes on this side, and the <HI>Hellespont</HI> on the other.
After the Death of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, it was miserably divided

of the <HI>Saracens</HI> it has been declining, unless where it has healed
its self towards those Parts bordering on <HI>India;</HI> by which means it
has not lost much of its Modern Greatness, though the <HI>Turks</HI> within
this Century have forced the Low Countries of <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Mesopo∣tamia,</HI>
which the <HI>Persians</HI> were as willing to resign as they to take,
they being a continual Charge to defend, and no Advantage to the
<HI>Persians,</HI> but rather an unnecessary Trouble: On which Reflections
there is nothing forbids, but that with the Judicious <HI>Boterus</HI> we may
state its Limits between the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph, the Lake
<HI>Stoke,</HI> with the Rivers <HI>Oxus</HI> and <HI>Tigris,</HI> and the Bay and Kingdom

whereby the Days are prolonged or shortned three Hours.</P>
<P>Under this Account is to be reckoned the greater part of <HI>Georgia,</HI>

I have not been certainly informed.</P>
<P><HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> erred something when he said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperance of the Air.</NOTE> <HI>Regio non alia in
tota Asiâ salubrior habetur, temperatum Coelum; hinc perpetuum jugum
opacum et umbrosum, quod Aestas laevat; illinc Mare adjunctum quod mo∣dico
tepore terras fovet.</HI> There is not a Region in all <HI>Asia</HI> esteemed
healthier, the Air being temperate; on this hand the Heaven is
shaded and the Vales defended by the Tops of Mountains, which
qualifies the Heat; on the other, surrounded with Seas and Rivers,
which by a friendly Warmth cherish the Land; for that Places near
the Tropicks make some Exceptions, where in the Summer they en∣dure
great Heat, not only from the nearness of the Sun (because
we often observe strange differences to happen in the same Climate),
but from the Sands, and Sulphurous Exhalations steaming from the
Mountains, which are impregnated herewith; whenas Reason per∣suades,
the Time must be hotter than in other Seasons of the Year:
As also in the Midland Country the Cause holds good for its intense
Coldness in Winter, and almost through every Quarter at Nights;
the Penury of Vapours where the Earth is Rocky and Mountainous,
the Rivers are scarce and small, the Snows lye undissolved, nor are
there any Woods of that Bigness to hinder the freedom of the Blasts
descending pure upon the Vales: On which account immoderate
Driness invades the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Parts, the Air is Serene and Vo∣latile,
which as it is highly serviceable to the Respiration of all Li∣ving
Creatures, so it mightily contributes to their Preservation as
well as Generation: Moreover, from this Rarity of the Air, follows
an undeniable Argument of its Frigidity, and thence a farther con∣comitant
of its Siccity; from all which results a Dry Constitution;
for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <HI>Siccitas hu∣mores
facit qualitate sicciores;</HI> Driness of the Air makes the Hu∣mours
drier, which the Inland of <HI>Persia</HI> enjoys from a Concatena∣tion
of Causes both of Heat and Cold.</P>
<P>The whole Region is very fruitful of Barren Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">High Moun∣tains.</NOTE> inclosing
the Valleys, being Excrescencies of the Mountain <HI>Taurus;</HI> nor can I
disbelieve in many places, but that the Plains do more than enough
<PB N="329" REF="184"/>
abound with Plenty, since no Place is unprovided with store of all
good things; but on the contrary, like the Promised Land, it over∣flows.
What <HI>Archiseles</HI> relates of the Island <HI>Ithica,</HI> may be applied to
this Country, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <HI>fragosum esse quidem,
sed juvencularum optimum nutritorem:</HI> That it was craggy indeed,
but an excellent Breeder of Cattel; the Sheep it brings forth are
prodigiously large, trailing Tails after them, of the Weight, some
of them, of Thirty Pound, full of Fat, they being stalled to that
pitch, that Hogs fed among us with the most Care and Skill, cut
not thicker than these do, especially after Vintage, and the Cotton-Harvest,
when they are turned in to crop the Leafs and tender
Branches of the Vine, and gather up the scattered Seeds of the Cot∣ton,
with which they thrive so infinitely, that little Flesh is to be
seen, it all being converted to Suet: At other times, for want of
Pasture they brouze on Shrubs and Thistles spread to and again, and
in Winter are foddered with Barley-Straw, and now and then with
a little Barley.</P>
<P>Their Neat, though small, are sleek and well-liking, whose Milk
is very good for present spending, but it's better to make Butter on
than Cheese. This Country has Goats in Herds, Tame ones, as
well as both Sheep and Goats on the Mountains, which are
Fierce and Wild, producing <HI>Bezoar;</HI> which together with Stags and
Antelopes are caught by Hawks instructed for that purpose.</P>
<P>Their Horses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Four∣footed Beasts.</NOTE> though they have degenerated from their Primitive
Race, (<HI>inest enim Equis patrum virtus;</HI> for even in Horses the Vir∣tue
of their Sires are communicated to their Breed;) still are they
the best of all the <HI>East,</HI> unless the <HI>Arabian</HI> be preferred for swifter
Coursers and light Horses: However for Charging Horses, and Stout
Warlike Steeds, they are valued above all others.</P>
<P>The Asses, though little, yet will they amble with a quick Pace
over Mountains where Horses cannot pass, and those used to Packs
are such as no other Nation can equal. The Mules and Camels are
their over Land Ships, by which they transport their Merchandise
over all the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Hyrcania</HI> brings forth Wild Beasts, such as Foxes, Wolves, and
Tygres, but for want of Dens and Lurking-places, and by reason
of the untilled and waste Desarts being devoid of Food, is less in∣fested
with them than other places; wherefore in long travelling
here they go more unconcerned than in those parts where they are
constantly alarmed by them, and are forced to be on their Guard,
lest at unawares they should be surprized, they snorting every where
securely under the wide Canopy of Heaven; and those that set upon
the Flocks by chance are easily mastered by the Shepherds Curs,
which are sharp Biters.</P>
<P>Wild Fowl, both for Wing and Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild Fowl</NOTE> are brought forth in great
Plenty of all sorts, near the Fountain-heads, and Inundations of the
melted Snow, falling not into Channels, but overspreading the Bot∣toms,
where they dissolve, whereby they seldom stretch into Rivers
at length, but stagnate in the Low Grounds, which they wash.</P>
<P>In which Washes sometimes are spawned Mud-Fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishes.</NOTE> and such as
Fens and Lakes are famous for. The <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea nourishes Salmon,
<PB N="330" REF="185"/>
Trouts, and Sturgion, and the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph sends abroad much
Fish for salting; the Rivers are not very full, nor are they stocked
with great Variety.</P>
<P>Bread<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Corn in many places admits a threefold Crop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Valleys made fruitful by the Snow from the Hills.</NOTE> and generally
without that Toil by Water-Courses as between the Tropicks, the
Rains in most places bestowing a more welcome Nutriment; but
more especially from the white Spume of the Celestial Waters (with
which the Hills are coated all the Seasons of the Year), in Winter
crusted by Frost, in Summer (by reason of the Sun's Heat, and
more exalted Motion) thawed, thereby constantly distilling on the
humble Vales an inexhausted Store, as wealthy as what flows from
<HI>Aemus</HI> Tops to enrich the <HI>Thessalian</HI> Fields.</P>
<P>Where these Supplies are not so lasting (or altogether wanting)
as nearer the Zodiac, there often under Ground a Vault is continued
for many Leagues, with open Pits at a fit distance to let in the Air,
and the Water carried deep to keep it from tasting of the Salt Sur∣face
(after the manner of common Sewers in our great Cities), which
it would do, were not the Wells Mouths left open: For Houshold
Service Rain-Water is only used.</P>
<P>In all this Country neither Oats nor Grass are found, because lon∣ger
Time is required to their springing up, than either the Intervals
of Heat or Cold will grant; for no sooner does the Spring enter, than
the Sun defaces their Verdure by parching up the Blades of either;
and when Autumn claims Preeminence at its Equinox, then no soon∣er
do they peep out, than they are nipped by the Recess of the Innate
Heat: Wherefore no Green Meadows or spangled Fields are here ex∣pected,
but such as are created by indefatigable Labour, unless they be
hoped to be seen in Vintages, or under Groves or Orchards, or by
Rivulets sides gliding from the declining Hills.</P>
<P>The first are set generally on Fruitful Ridges of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Mounts,
<Q><L>—Denique apertos</L>
<L>Bacchus amat Colles—<HI>Virg. Georg.</HI> 2.</L></Q></P>
<P>The latter are the frequent Advantages to Villages, and the sweet
Pleasure of the larger Towns; where Trees and Flowers grow up
together, that the one may yield a safe shelter to the other, against
the Extremes of Heat or Cold; in both whose Prime a fragrant
Blandishment conspire no less, than to entice the willing Senses: But
for Elegancy of Culture and choice of Slips, I see them not over
emulous; which Neglect gives just occasion of Wonder, since their
Worldly Happiness is placed in fine Gardens, which no Nation ap∣pears
to me more to Idolize.</P>
<P>For Fuel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> the combustible Heath is more common than flourish∣ing
Trees for Timber; but for Sallads it yields all that are desirable,
both Herbs and Roots; and some of the most Medicinal Plants are of
the Natural Growth of this Country.</P>
<P>There is an heavy Tax laid upon Tobacco,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tobacco.</NOTE> though it be the
choicest in these Parts.</P>
<P>To these Blessings for Pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manufacto∣ries.</NOTE> Necessity, and Physick, are added
others for Profit: Gums, the most Rich, distil every where: From
<HI>Carmania,</HI> Goats-Wool (as much to be prized as <HI>Jason</HI>'s Golden Fleece)
<PB N="331" REF="185"/>
with which our Hatters know well how to falsify their Bevers; and
the Natives how more honestly to weave both Cloth and Carpets
very fine, which they sell at dear Rates. The Flocks and courser
Wool of their Sheep stand them in some stead, they kneading it
into Felts, for Seamless Coats for the ordinary sort of People, for
their common wearing; and their Skins with the Wool on, are both
an Ornament and Safeguard against the roughest Weather: But
Lambs-skins with their crisped Wool are of more Credit, (they being
excellent Artists to make them keep their Curl), and not disdained
to be worn by the chiefest Gentry; of whose Leather they make
good Merchandise, it being esteemed better than <HI>Turkish,</HI> their Tan∣ners
being expert at dressing, not only these and Kid, but other Hides
of larger size, which therefore are bought up with Greediness by all
Foreigners, for their real Excellency.</P>
<P>Goats and Camels, after other good Services performed, be∣queath
their Hair to their Weavers, of which they make water'd
Camlets.</P>
<P>But above all, the Wool-bearing Cotton-Shrub renders by its
Wealthy Down those Riches which are deeper digg'd for.</P>
<P>Nor does the Silk-worm lay it self out less for the Publick Weal,
while it spins out its own Bowels, until nothing be left within its Cask
but Air; contrary to the Trite Saying of <HI>Aristotle, Ex nihilo nihil fit;</HI>
Out of Nothing comes Nothing; for by the Industry of this Infect,
the first Foundation of the <HI>Persian</HI> Silks, Velvets, and Rich Embroider'd
Carpets, are laid, with which the greatest part of the habitable
World do Pride themselves.</P>
<P>And since we descend to these busy Tutors of Mankind, who up∣braid
the slothful and oscitantly idle, let us step through the Mo∣narchy
of the Bees, and taste the Sweets they suck from Nature's
ample Storehouse, and see how they return with Thighs laden with
Honey, to stock themselves, and build their Mansionss to nourish
their young, and enough to spare to feed Mankind besides; and in
their Last Testament make the <HI>Persians</HI> Legatees, by leaving them
huge Cakes of Wax.</P>
<P>Let's look a little lower,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Persian</HI> Pearl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the best.</NOTE> and ransack the Deep, and we shall find
the <HI>Persian</HI> Pearls excelling all others that are generated in Sea-shells,
from which Beds are brought forth <HI>Ʋnions,</HI> adorning the Necks and
Ears of the greatest Princesses, and the Crowns and Diadems of the
mightiest Emperors, begot at certain Seasons of the Year in the
Flesh of Oysters, as the Concrete Grains or Hardness in Swines-Flesh
(I suppose scrophulous Tumors), by the Dew of Heaven,
says <HI>Tertullian.</HI> Whence if it Thunders or Lightens, says <HI>Pliny,</HI> the
Oysters are straitned, or miscarry; but others render it quite con∣trary:
So that I should leave their Original as disputable here as
ever, if no Belief could be fixed on Experience, which confirms
their Increase to be chiefly owing to the Virtue both of Showers and
Thunder.</P>
<P>Before we launch too far,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gombroon</HI> Ware made of Earth, the best, next <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> let us examine with what Faculties

Excellencies, it is not altogether a dead Soil, though it be

right enough termed so by <HI>Paracelsus,</HI> speaking generally; for it is
not to be understood as comprehensible in the Element, but as it
subsists and lives impregnated in the Microcosm, it receiving its Foe∣cundity
through its Virtue, whereby it vegetates, and takes upon
it the Nature of Minerals, Stones, Gaults, or Clay, and of Animals,
as well as Plants. We having yet but lightly turned up the Glebe,
have hardly given the Potter his handful of White Marble to form
into Vessels without <HI>Fucus,</HI> deservedly challenging the Superiority;
unless the Ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> would restore the true Porcelin, which
they cannot, it requiring the Growth of some Ages, which their
late Civil Wars and Tumults has forbidden to be effected, while
they wreak their Anger on these Treasuries, to the Ruin of their
Enemies, and the utter loss of their own Reputation in that Point.</P>

<P>But the <HI>Lapis Lazuli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lapis Lazuli.</NOTE> vulgarly called the <HI>Armenian</HI> Stone, is
imputed to be a Native of that Region; for the true <HI>Lapis Lazuli</HI> is
brought hither only by the <HI>Tartars</HI> inhabiting beyond the <HI>Caspian</HI>
Sea; and then, but when they come on Embassies to the <HI>Suffee,</HI>
(for others of their Nation are not permitted to expatiate the Uni∣verse,
or wander from their own Homes, nor for Strangers is it law∣ful
to enter their Dominions): Wherefore neither can they trans∣port
it on this side, nor on the other side will they hold any Cor∣respondence
with these: However it happens, under these Difficul∣ties
and Restraints the <HI>Armenians</HI> sometimes do attempt to acquire
it, leaving no Stone unturn'd to purchase it; and having once
gained it, they suck thence as much Profit, as they please to value the
Hazard of the Enterprize at, wherein they use little Conscience;
whence it comes to pass it is sold for such vast Rates to the <HI>Europeans.</HI>
From this Stone is made that Colour they name <HI>Ʋltra-marine</HI> Blue,

to that Science, and the Dens and Caves Mouths of the old
<HI>Gaurs</HI> bear some deformed ones, (unless the King's Palaces have some
Tanks, and the Princes and Great Men some Gate-Posts and Lintels
smoothly polished), few others are seen; for what reason I know not,
unless their Religion prohibit, or they delight more in Brick and
Muddy Walls, though less durable, or that it is so decreed by Fate,
even as Things or Times naturally decline from bad to worse: Thus
it is, from Marble Cities they are now become hardly Brick; by
which means the most sumptuous Tombs of the foregoing Emperors
hardly declare to the succeeding Generation in whose Memory they
were intended.</P>

<P>At the Foot of the high Mountain <HI>Barmuch</HI> are found several sorts

finding of these, as their Ingenuity is slow, so for certain they are less
apt to put themselves upon extraordinary Labours in Spagyrical Ope∣rations;
having hitherto been content with the dull Metals of Lead
and Iron, had not lately <HI>Hermes</HI> Wand directed them to the Scru∣tiny
of a Copper Vein; from whence they reap not greater Emolu∣ment
than the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do Detriment: For formerly as they
brought great Quantities from <HI>Japan,</HI> that turned to good Account,
now that Trade falls off; and whereas before it yielded them besides
Cloth of Gold and Silver, Silks and Velvets, Carpets and other Ma∣nufactories,
which they are obliged by Compact to take off their
hands every Year, to the entire Sum of Fifty thousand <HI>Thomands,</HI>
all which they more than cleared, carrying away moreover several
Tuns of Gold and Silver in Coin; at present they can but just pay,
and make even the aforesaid Indenture.</P>
<P>About <HI>Siras</HI> are to be digged Mines of Gold and Silver, but they
quit neither Cost nor Pains, wherefore they have laid aside the far∣ther
Inquest into them.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have run through a spacious Field, though perhaps
not every where equally fortunate in every thing; for,
<Q><L>Hic Segetes, illic veniunt foelicius Ʋvae</L>
<L>Arborei foetus alibi.—</L></Q>
<Q><L>Here Corn grows best, there Vines do flourish more;</L>
<L>Woods in another place produce their Store.</L></Q>
Though for the most part this is an hospitable Soil, cherishing in its
Matrice whatever is kindly sowed.</P>
<P>And this Increase is continued without any notable River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> that
hath either Breadth or Depth for to bear laden Vessels of any Bulk:
For, as <HI>Varenius</HI> writes, the manner whereby any Rivers of conside∣rable
or indifferent Bigness exist, are twofold; either from the con∣junction
of many Rivulets into one Stream, or that they flow from
great Lakes; the former of which every one hinders, while they
draw every Brook to their own Use; so that instead of filling large
Channels, they almost drein them quite, which might otherwise
merit to be called great Rivers; to wit, that of <HI>Siras</HI> and <HI>Persepo∣lis,</HI>
which washing its Plain, makes a long Journy before it mixes
with the Salt Sea: And lastly, the River at <HI>Suffahaun,</HI> which never
runs with a full Current, only about the Autumnal Quarter, when
sometimes by Rain, but always by the dissolved Snows after Summer
is over, the Husbandmen breaking down their Dams, purposely rai∣sed
to keep the Waters up for the sake of the Rice, the Waters being
<PB N="334" REF="187"/>
let loose, return to the Main Channel, and raise themselves to the
Brims of its Banks, otherwise passable in most places: This first
way failing, we shall see what Supply is to be expected from the
Lake <HI>Stoke,</HI> which lies too low to ascend the High Countries; and
for the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea or Lake, I doubt not it will appear as impossi∣ble,
if it be true what is said in behalf of it, That many mighty
Rivers empty themselves into it, which it receives without the least
Augmentation, and therefore cannot return their Kindness recipro∣cally.</P>
<P>Which being consider'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Springs.</NOTE> this Land is chiefly beholden to whole∣some
Springs of Living Water, to quench the Thirst of Plants as
well as living Creatures, which are to that End bestowed on them
apart by a more Liberal Providence, than either of the former by a
joint Consent.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the impending Clouds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Rain.</NOTE> they are mostly without
Rain; and though they lowre some Weeks together, they rarely
drop Moisture.</P>
<P>The sudden Gusts and impetuous Blasts from the Mountains hin∣dring
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Showers of Sand.</NOTE> oftner cause near the Maritime Coasts, Hurricanes of
Wind, and wonderful Tempests of Sand, so Thick and Black, that
the Clouds raised thereby benight the very Day, and while the
Storm lasts (which is not long) induces a Darkness to be felt; and
the Fury over, it leaves the Effects of a Fired Air: Unless when the
Seven Stars arise on this Horizon at the beginning of Spring, when
a mellifluous Dew lies not long on the Trees and the Plants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dew turned into Manna.</NOTE> before
it be concrete into the choicest Manna.</P>
<P>And although at stated Times the Snow does furnish them with
Water, yet it suffers in nothing more than in extreme Drought.
Which is the reason Eminent Cities and Market-Towns stand not
thick, but are at vast distances one from another; nor are the Villa∣ges
less straggling, two scarcely falling under the Eye from the Tops
of their highest Mountains, excepting in some few of their Wealthi∣est
Plains.</P>
<P>The most principal Cities I have seen, are <HI>Gombroon,</HI> and <HI>Bunder-Congo,</HI>
two great Ports in the Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI> famous for Traffick
on that side of the World. <HI>Lhor,</HI> the Granary for these Ports. <HI>Je∣rom,</HI>
excelling in Dates. <HI>Siras,</HI> like another Phoenix-sprung out of
the Ashes of <HI>Persepolis,</HI> which still retains the Dignity and Majesty
of the Metropolis of <HI>Persia,</HI> strictly so called; after the same man∣ner
as <HI>Ispahaun, Spahaun,</HI> or <HI>Suffahaun,</HI> most properly is of <HI>Parthia;</HI>
only so much the more Honourable, by how long it shall please the

<P>Those Cities which Fame has brought to our Ears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cities.</NOTE> are <HI>Casbin,</HI> ano∣ther
Royal City, bordering on the <HI>Caspian,</HI> sicklier than <HI>Spahaun,</HI> tho

not far from Mount <HI>Ararat,</HI> now the Seat of the Chief Pa∣triarchate;
it is conterminous to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the most Trading
Empory on that side. For weaving and transporting Silks and Vel∣vets,
<HI>Gillan</HI> stands in the first Rank; in the second, <HI>Sherwan. Jouscan</HI>

At <HI>Nerez, Assa Foetida:</HI> At <HI>Shabanat</HI> are the best <HI>Bezoar</HI>-Stones.</P>
<P>The Buildings of their Cities are of Three Sorts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> the Houses being
diversified in respect of the Place, Time, and Persons; for the Forms
of those of the Citizens, Nobles, and Peasants, are not all alike: As
those in Sandy and Hot Places are of one Shape, and those in Rocky,
Stony, and Cold Parts of another: So likewise the Anniversary Mu∣tations
in any of these, make them fit their Habitations for those
Quarters.</P>
<P>The Palaces of the Potentates are built mostly after this manner:
Towards the Street appears little or no Frontispiece, more than the
Porch, which makes a square stately Building, arched at top, under
which is a stately Balcony, open on every side, over the Hastle,
which compasses neat Apartments, and are defended from the Sun's
Heat by large Umbrelloes or Penthouses, stretching themselves wide
to draw in the cool Air, the embowed parts whereof are fretted, and
the out-parts shine with Blue inlaid with Gold: The Casements, or
Folding-doors rather, sparkle with Glorious Panes of Glass of several
Colours, and declare the Workmanship of the Carvers; as does the
outside Slates the Skill of the Tilers in Glazing and Painting, as
well as the Marble Facing the Ingenious Design of the Surveyor.</P>
<P>From the Portal runs on each hand round the Garden a Mud-Wall
very high, though not very thick, which another Wall thwarts just
in the middle, from the Porch to the main Building, thereby to part
the Mens Quarters from the Womens; the latter whereof encloses
the Kitchen-Garden; the other is destined for Fragrant Plants, Aro∣matick
Flowers, and outstretching Trees for Pleasure, as well as
bearing Fruit for Use. The Houses are so contrived, that in the
Summer they are open Banqueting-Houses, refreshed with Fountains
as they sit in <HI>Frisco,</HI> which descend thence to all the Quadrangles
by Water-Courses. Since the greatest part of this Empire is not far
off the <HI>Northern</HI> Tropick, it is therefore no wonder it should com∣plain
of Heat, especially in the Summer, at which Season the Sun
strikes the Earth more directly with its Rays; for which cause,
amongst all of them, Aquaducts and Fountains in the very Rooms
below Stairs, are mightily prized, with Water-works playing to cool
the burning Particles of the incensed Air; and the whole Structure
is constituted so, that it may receive these Refreshments every way it
is capable: Wherefore they defend their Dwellings from the Sun,
and are constantly sprinkling Water around their Seats from these
Currents; and from their Tops have many Breathing-places to re∣ceive
the Wind, which are so fixed, that whatever Breezes stir, they
shall suck them in, and transmit them to all the Rooms of the
House, as they list.</P>
<P>In Winter, if they be remote from the Sea, they shut up their
open Halls and Parlours, and make them close Apartments, by let∣ting-down
those Umbrelloes that shaded them in Summer, to keep
them warm in the cold Winter, till its Severity be past, spreading all
the Floor with Quilts thick and warm, and kindling Stoves in all
their Bedchambers: These also are of a different Model from those
nearer the Sea, They being mostly flat, These arched: Their Roofs
<PB N="336" REF="188"/>
are made of Wood fetch'd from <HI>India,</HI> with transverse Beams upon
Clay walls, or Stone with untempered Mortar, till they come to
the just Altitude of their Houses, when the <HI>Interstitia</HI> or Spaces be∣tween
Beam and Beam are filled with Palm-Leafs neatly laid and
painted, which serve for Cieling.</P>
<P>It is universally common to Spherical, Arched, or Plain Buildings, to
lay vast Loads of Mud at top; and what is more wonderful, only with
Mud and Clay, they will rear most spacious Arches, without other
matter of Assistance; whereupon either against Snows or Rains,
should they continue (which they never do long) they would make
but faint Resistance; for being soaked thoroughly, they would re∣solve
into their first Entity: Whence in great Snows, to defend and
keep their Dwellings standing, they shovel it all from the Tops of
their Houses into the Lanes, and thereby obstruct the Passages of
their most Publick Streets, when the Snow has not fallen above
two days, and also endanger the Foundations; which the Rich bet∣ter
secure by Brick Bottoms, than the Poor, whose Fabricks often
totter on such occasions: However, they have a better Opportunity
against Fire, their Mansions affording little combustible Substance
for that to feed on.</P>
<P>The Citizens are not so sumptuous as the Nobles; and the Villages
are content with Cottages, with either Plain or Arched Roofs, nei∣ther
presuming to exalt them to an unbecoming Height, in regard
of either of their Stations: Their Casements are latticed, not going
to the Price of Glass, which is Foreign, and for that reason scarce.
Concluding then with these Tenements, we are brought to view on
what Basis their Government stands: For the Welfare and Support
of Cities, are the Observation of their Laws;
<Q>Salus Civium in Legibus consistit.</Q>
<Q><L>Wholsome Laws the City's Safety are,</L>
<L>Against all Violence the surest Bar.</L></Q>
<Q>Justitia una alias virtutes continet omnes.</Q>
<Q>Justice alone all other Virtues holds.</Q></P>
<P>And as a Patern of all their Politicks, I shall propose <HI>Spahaun</HI> (or
rather <HI>Suffahaun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spahaun</HI> pro∣posed as a Pa∣tern of their Politicks.</NOTE> as by and by shall be declared), not only the Head
of <HI>Parthia,</HI> but of the whole Nation; which Region by <HI>Mercator</HI> is
named <HI>Arac,</HI> placed between <HI>Media, Persia, Carmania,</HI> and <HI>Hyrcania:</HI>
By some is is called <HI>Charasan;</HI> by the Inhabitants, <HI>Airoon;</HI> it lies al∣most
under the Fifth Climate, in Thirty seven Degrees of Latitude
<HI>North,</HI> and Eighty six of Longitude <HI>East;</HI> the Days differ Three
Hours in the Course of the Year: Nor are the Seasons so calm and
sedate, that they should be esteemed temperate, so as not to exceed
in either Extreme, where in Summer they must use Caves, Vaults,
and Grottoes, and in Winter Stoves and Hot-houses.</P>
<P>The Air is very rare at <HI>Spahaun,</HI> and the Wind drying: The City has
no need of Walls, where so many Marble Mountains stand as a
<PB N="337" REF="188"/>
Guard, or Bulwark of Defence; it has indeed a Tower, but it is a
Mud one, rather serving as an Armory, than to be relied on as a
place of Strength; so that I shrewdly suspect whether ever this were
the <HI>Hecatompylos</HI> of <HI>Ortellius,</HI> as is related by more than one. The
Circumference of the Body of the City I guess may measure Seven
Miles; but if the dispersed Gardens and Seats of the Great Men,
with the Palace Royal be brought into that Computation, we must
allow it as many <HI>Pharsangs.</HI></P>
<P>The Journy to it is difficult in Bands, Troops, or Companies,
by reason of the uneven Way encompassing every side for many
Miles together; therefore to attempt coming to it with an Army
or Warlike Force, must not be ascribed to Prudence of Conduct or
Valour, unless there should arise another <HI>Alexander</HI> (which must
be imputed to his good Fortune, rather than Prowess or Virtue)
hairbrain'dly resolute to undergo no Repulse, tho the Exterprize sur∣pass
all human Probability: For it must unavoidably fare with him
literally, as it did hyperbolically only with <HI>Xerxes</HI> his Host, who
are reported to have been so numerous as to drink whole Rivers dry
as they passed; what then would Cisterns of Rain-water do, or now
and then a small Brook, to quench the Thirst even of an ordinary
Detachment, not likely to put so Populous a City in the least Con∣sternation?
But to find Food in such Bye and Desolate Paths for any
considerable Force, would be past possibility, unless at the Expence
of a Miracle. By these Bars, whereby the Passes are easily secured
(an Handful of Men being able to withstand an Host) and the
Avenues inaccessible, the Hostile Arms of the <HI>Turks</HI> have been put
to a stop, who otherwise would have set no Bounds to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r Desires,
could they have conquered these Obstacles, whereby they would at
the same time have carried the Empire too.</P>
<P>The small Attendance we carried up to <HI>Spahaun,</HI> was demonstra∣tion
enough of this Truth; for though we fared well, yet it was
tiresome, and few else meet with the like Conveniences, they being
assured that we would more than reward their readiness to provide
for us, whereby we the better overcame those Straits, which prepa∣red
an Entrance into the large Field where this invincible City lay
open to us; deriving its Annual Nutriment from a clear River, which
it bestows plentifully from its hollow Womb: But that which it
bears the Bays away for, is its being seated in the very Heart of the
Empire.</P>
<P>For sake whereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shaw Abas</HI> well advised in his Choice of <HI>Spahaun</HI> for the Imperial City.</NOTE> its Founder (or at least, Adorner) <HI>Shaw Abas</HI>
the Great, advisedly chose it for his Imperial Throne, that thence
he might more readily disperse his Mandates, and be assisting by his
Auxiliaries, to any suffering Part, assaulted by the bold Incursions of
his Enemies; irradiating like the Sun in the Firmament (by the In∣fluence
of his Power) all within the Sphere of his Government: So
that while the utmost of his Dominions are seasonably supplied with
the comfortable Warmth of his Protection, he safely resides within,
invulnerable from Foreign Strokes, and reigns in this his Capital
City without Controul. And as the Founders of Old <HI>Rome</HI> promi∣sed
Eternity to their Empire as well as City, in digging up a Man's
Skull, and thence, as from the best Omen, were encouraged; as
<PB N="338" REF="189"/>
not being persuaded the Capitol could be a fit Basis for the Monar∣chy
of the World, unless it were built on the Foundation that was
so luckily offered them: So from the same Auspicious Sign <HI>Shaw Abas</HI>
presaged the like happy Event, building a Pillar of his Enemies Heads,
raised as a Trophy to his Valour. What else is August in <HI>Suffa∣haun,</HI>
are the remaining Products of his Brain, more truly than <HI>Mi∣nerva</HI>
was said to be the Offspring of <HI>Jove.</HI></P>
<P>The magnificently-arch'd Buzzars, which form the Noble Square
to the Palace; the several Publick Inns, which are so many Sera∣glios;
the stately Rows of Sycamores, which the World cannot pa∣rallel;
the glorious Summer-houses, and pleasant Gardens, the stu∣pendious
Bridges, sumptuous Temples, the Religious Convents, the
College for the Professors of Astronomy, are so many lasting Pyra∣mids
and Monuments of his Fame; though many of them begin to
sink in their own Ruin, for want of timely Repair; such is the fatal
Calamity of human Structures, Time corroding the most durable:
But to speak properly and truly, the Cause of so early a Decay is
the slothful Nature, and disregard of their Forefathers Honour, that
possesses the improvident <HI>Persians,</HI> lest any thing tending to perpe∣tuate
their Memories, should by reviving their Virtues be made use
of as a Reproach to their instant Supineness; and for that reason
they let all fall to the Ground, never offering to underprop a decli∣ning
Building.</P>
<P>This City has <HI>Caesar</HI> for its principal Patron;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cauns.</HI></NOTE> under him the <HI>Caun,</HI>
who is President of the Province, or County-Sheriff, (who is ever
one of the Prime Nobility, and of the highest Rank among the
Courtiers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lways on Duty near the Emperor's Person, that he may
be ready to give an account of his Charge upon demand, and at hand
to introduce all Addresses that concern his Office to represent; being
as it were a Skreen between so high a Majesty, and the meanness of
the Popularity under his Protection, lest they should intrude too pro∣phanely,
or be struck blind by the too bright Rays of an Absolute
Power) is interposed as a fit Medium, to qualify by a suitable
Intercession the necessary distance each Condition ought to
be kept at, to maintain the mutual Benefit expected on both sides.
Whilst he is thus employed, and receives the greatest Profits of his
Lordship, he deputes his Lieutenant to the Trust of governing, who
transacts all in his Name, as his Chief Vicar.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Suffee</HI>'s Vicar-General is by his Place the Second Person
in the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Etimundoulet,</HI> or Chancellor.</NOTE> and always the First Minister of State, called by
them <HI>Etimundoulet, The Chief Slave;</HI> under whose Jurisdiction the
Provinces of lesser Note do fall, and are at his disposing immediate∣ly
next the Emperor's; whose <HI>Cauns</HI> or Dukes therefore are obliged to
constant Residence in their several Districts; and if it fortune that at
any time they have Business with the Emperor, they apply them∣selves
to the <HI>Etimundoulet,</HI> as to the Lord Chancellor of the whole
Kingdom, to whose Management they commit themselves and their
Cause; who cannot be absent from their Metropolis at any time, be∣fore
they have constituted a <HI>Ganizeen,</HI> which is an Under-Sheriff,
who, thereby transmit their Authority to him, only reserving the Ho∣nour
to themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="189"/>
All these Prefects in their Dominions behave themselves after the
Example of the Emperor himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Ganiseen</HI> is Deputy to the <HI>Caun.</HI></NOTE> in respect of Grandeur as well as
Rule, only remembring they are but Tenants at Will, and therefore
fail not to present their Master and his Family with the First Fruits of
the Growth of each Province; which Annual Commemoration is a
Monitor of their Homage and Fealty to their Supreme Lord, which
he exacts as a due Debt, and they pay as an acknowledgment of
their Servitude to him; in which as long as they continue in his
Grace, at every New-Year's Day he sends them a Livery, or Robe
of Honour, to be retained his Slaves, which they receive as a Mark
of the highest Favour; and to be called a <HI>Goloomy Shaw, The King's
Vassal,</HI> is the highest <HI>Apex</HI> of their Ambition.</P>
<P>Subordinate to the forementioned Officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Droger.</HI></NOTE> is the <HI>Droger,</HI> or
Mayor of the City, or Captain of the Watch or the Rounds: It is
his Duty to preside with the Main Guard a-nights before the Palace-Gates,
and thence to make Excursions through the City, to disperse,
secure, and apprehend Idle and Vagrant Persons, that can give no
Account of themselves, to punish Offenders of that nature, and to
keep the Peace.</P>
<P>In all their Buzzars, which are locked up in the dead of the Night,
there are Watches to prevent Thieves, at the common Expence of
every Shopkeeper.</P>
<P>The next in Office is the <HI>Questor Zygostates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Calenture.</HI></NOTE> or Clerk of the Mar∣ket,
known among them by the Title of <HI>Calenture;</HI> he fixes the
Price of Corn, has the Oversight of all Bakers, Cooks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and by
his own Authority can not only confiscate their Goods to the Poor,
but mulct with loss of Life such Offenders as are notoriously irre∣claimable
otherwise; many times throwing a Baker into his own
Red-hot Furnace, that vends poysonous Corn, or cheats in the
Weight; and the Cook into his own Boiling Caldron, for imposing
on the People Carrion, or ill-nourishing Flesh, found in Highways
or Ditches: Thus deals he with Malefactors of this Batch. Besides,
he is Receiver of all the Rents of the City, and pays it into the
King's Treasury.</P>
<P>The last Person to be treated of is the <HI>Cazy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cazy.</HI></NOTE> or Publick Justiciary,
who will deserve a special Treatise by himself, and therefore is to be
reserved for a fitter season.</P>
<P>But in the mean time we may observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spahaun</HI> the chief Empory.</NOTE> That by such Cyclops as
these are formed the Thunderbolts of the Almighty <HI>Jove,</HI> whereby
he both makes the whole <HI>Olympus</HI> shake, and preserves the Laws of
every private City as well as Country to which they belong. As all
things by a Natural Tendency move from the Circumference to the
Centre, so from the Confluence of all Nations of the World hither,
it becomes the Chief Empory, as well as an Exemplar of their Go∣vernment;
although it hath declined much since the <HI>Europeans</HI> have
discovered the way by Sea to <HI>India:</HI> For long before that it was the
Storehouse and general Market for <HI>Indian</HI> Wares as well as its own;
and by consequence, as it was the Staple of the Universe, it was the
common Receptacle of all the Money ebbing and flowing from all
Parts: But this <HI>Bosphorus</HI> being stopped, from a Sea it became a
<PB N="340" REF="190"/>
Lake, in which Riches do now stagnate, not circulate, or at least not
with that Force they did before.</P>
<P>However, as long as the busy Merchant from the uttermost Coasts,
gapes after its Commodities to advance his Pelf, and for his sake the
Publick Buzzars are kept in better Repair than less-frequented Buil∣dings,
it must be allowed it is so far from a Total Decay of Trade,
that few Cities in the World surpass it for Wealth, and none come
near it for those stately Buildings; which for that reason are kept
entire, while others made of Lime and Slate, belonging to private
Persons, hardly last their Founders Lives, for want of timely Care.</P>
<P>For the Citizens rather chuse to dwell in a tottering House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citizens humbled.</NOTE> than
appear lavish in Costly Building or Apparel, for fear their Governors
should suspect they have too much Riches, when they are sure ne∣ver
to be at rest till they have dived into the bottom of their Trea∣suries;
which Extortion is returned by the King upon their Rulers,
whereby the Emperor's Treasure grows exuberantly great: Which
is the cause the Citizens so often lay up their Talents in Napkins,
since it is a Crime to expose their Wealth by specious or luxurious
Shews, according to the accustomed Pride of Wealthiest Corpora∣tions
among us.</P>
<P>Whence it proceeds that only Courtiers and Soldiers in this Coun∣try,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Courtiers and Soldiers live great.</NOTE>
who are maintained by Annual Pensions, are permitted to live
gallantly; whose regard of the Publick Utility is rarely so much
considered, as to spare any thing from their manner of enjoying
themselves, either to adorn or benefit the Cities in which they reside:
On which ground it is, that their best Cities seldom have splendid
Edifices to commend them, from mean or private Hands; though in
the Suburbs of their Capital City <HI>Spahaun,</HI> there are many by the
Rivers side, both of the Nobles and the Emperors stately Palaces.</P>
<P>But what celebrates it most, are the covered Buzzars, or Market∣places,
continued through the whole City; and the Inns of Stran∣gers,
occupying them in the time of their Business; their Baths,
Temples, and Convents, which have Stipends to support them
from being an Eyesore and Blemish in their principal Places; all
which deserve a particular Description.</P>
<P>And therefore I shall begin with their Inns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cara∣vans.</NOTE> or <HI>Caravan Ser Raws,</HI>
which are divided into Three Species, both in respect of their Site
and Form, as well as Matter, through the whole Empire. Those
near the Sea-shore for Seven Days Journey or thereabouts, are com∣monly
of this Figure; they are reared of unpolished Stones, on an
Area Three Foot high, to keep out the Horses, and leave an out∣ward
Space for Servants to lye on, whereon are erected Four Pillars,
which support Four bowed Roofs, surrounding an Hemispherical
Arch in the middle, where at each side over head are large open
Windows (or Doors rather) to receive the Air, and at every Cor∣ner
of the Square, Forms within a separate Apartment for their Men
of Note, which are in open Cloysters; and without, Four more,
close, for those that connot endure the Air, or for their Women;
every Quarter has a wide Entrance or open Gate to add to its Airy∣ness;
to which Inns are no Stables or shady Places for the Beasts of
Burthen, unless there happen to be Trees, which is a great chance in
<PB N="341" REF="190"/>
such Sandy, Wild, and Desert Places. To the most famous of
these now and then happens to be an Host provided with Necessaries
for Travellers, slenderly provided to furnish them at easy Rates with
Cheese and Fruit, Bread and Barley, the first whereof the Poor
make their Meals on, and their Beasts on the latter: But they must
dress both their Victuals and their Beasts themselves, for he affords
neither Cook nor any other to the best that come, no more than
to the lowest; offering at no more than to sell Mans-Meat and Horse-Meat.</P>
<P>They mostly nest in common,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Priority at Church, Bath, or <HI>Cara∣van Ser Raw.</HI></NOTE> and observe no distinction among
themselves either at Church, in the Bath, or in the <HI>Caravan Ser Raw;</HI>
he that comes first, is first served, none give way to another; where∣by
there is in the same Inn a multitude of all sorts, Footmen, Horse∣men,
Merchants, together with an hideous Confusion of People
within, and the Noise of Beasts, Packers, and Servants.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding which, if a Foreign Ambassador with a great
Retinue arrive, or any of their Nobles (whom they only respect as
Men among them) pitch his Tent, or take up his Quarters with
them, these will remove, and proffer him Room, seeking Lodgings
on the Outward Lodge, or Advance-Border of the <HI>Caravan Ser Raw</HI>
for themselves; but then this must be esteemed a great Mark of
their Compliance, and indeed almost forced, they usually stomaching
such a Disturbance with frowning Countenances, and sometimes open
Revilings.</P>
<P>This Form, after Seven Days travelling, is from an huddled Stack of
Buildings expatiated into a large Square in the middle of the Area,
where in the Summer-time both the Cattel and Packs are shut in by
Doors lock'd a-nights, and open'd early in the Morn, to keep in the
straying Troop together, and for the safety of their Bundles, lest any
should be stollen: In the heart of this Square is raised a place as large
as a Mountebank's Stage, where the <HI>Gelabdar,</HI> or Master Muliteer, with
his prime Passengers or Servants, have an opportunity to view their
whole <HI>Caphala.</HI></P>
<P>This Office in <HI>Turky</HI> is held a Place of Trust and Honour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gelabdar</HI> not so esteem∣ed in <HI>Persia,</HI> as the <HI>Caphala Basha</HI> in <HI>Turky.</HI></NOTE> he
being Captain of all the Troops going together, and hires Soldiers,
and lists them in his Pay, being a Churlish <HI>Nabal</HI> to Christians; but
he is here of no other Account than to look after his Number of
Mules, Camels, or Asses, and to see they bring their Lading safe
where consigned, and often becomes subject himself to Bastinadoes
on the Soles of the Feet: Whereas the other in his Journey takes
upon him a kind of a Bassaship, and never fails to lay any Miscarri∣age
or Misfortune on the Bones of the <HI>Fringi,</HI> or <HI>Franks:</HI> But it is
otherwise here, because of the <HI>Rhadary</HI> undertaking to secure Tra∣vellers;
which is easily done in an entirely-subjected Empire, not
liable to Treacherous Insults of Ravening Thieves in Companies, as
they are to the Wild <HI>Arabs</HI> and other Outlaws.</P>
<P>In Winter-time there are Stables capacious of holding Four hun∣dred
Carriers Horses together with their Burthens, on the backside
of little Chambers, fronting the <HI>Peristylium</HI> or Cloyster'd Entry, all
black with Smoke when they retire into them in the Winter; lying
else before them on open Cloysters, which are so many Anticham∣bers
<PB N="342" REF="191"/>
to every one of them, and at first appearance make a Piatza,
were not every distinct Arch on each side separated by a Party-Wall,
being all alike, and did not the Middle Arch of each side make a diffe∣rence
by a more spacious and exalted distinction, each answering
the Loftiness of the Porch within, though that rises higher into an
aspiring square Tower, with lightsome Summer-Chambers aloft,
which makes a Magnificent Entry; and thence the Covering of the
Caravan runs on a plain Terras, convenient for the whole Number of
Guests to spread their Carpets, Matrasses, Plads, or Beds, for lodg∣ing
in the Night time.</P>
<P>Since the Architecture to these in View and Variety (by their
alternate Chambers and Cloysters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They may make Forts of their Cara∣vans.</NOTE> which by distinct Arches keep
their due Order) is no deformed sight, it yields besides a double
Utility, for the defence of Strangers against both the Injuries of
Heat and Cold: And those of them that are built of Stone or Brick,
have not once only stood it out in the nature of strong Forts against
their Opposers, but have many times been made tenable, being
stored with Ammunition and Provision.</P>
<P>Those nearer <HI>Spahaun</HI> have most an end the same Form or Shape
below, but are oftner tubilated than tabulated above, and are made
of Mud for the most part; but in <HI>Spahaun</HI> its self, where Strangers
abide longer, they are more splendid, and larger than any where
else; for to this lower Order we have been describing, they add ano∣ther,
and sometimes a third, which bear Proportion and exact Syme∣try
with each other.</P>
<P>Their Temples represent no great Bulk to the Beholders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tem∣ples.</NOTE> nor exalt
themselves much towards Heaven, unless some Obelisks, which are
sometimes joined with, at other times separate from them: But most
an end they observe this Form; The Foundation being laid in a
Square, the Roof is supported by four Pillars, in whose middle a
great Cupilo lifts up its Head, which the Priests visit Day and Night
at every Fourth Hour to call the people to Prayers; the Whole par∣ticipates
more of <HI>Mosaick</HI> than any other Work. In the Dome is no
Ornament, nor Seat; on the Ground Mats are strewed; any manner
of Carving or Representation whatsoever is banish'd hence.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Pomaerium</HI> to the outward Court they ascend by Steps,
where they bare their Feet, alluding to the Command in <HI>Moses</HI> his
Vision, <HI>Pull off thy shooes, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
Ground.</HI> As soon as they have washed themselves in the Porch, where
always is a Baptistery, or Tank for that purpose, they pluck off
their upper Garments, especially if they be Cloth of Gold, for Gold
also is to them <HI>Nigess, i. e.</HI> unclean; wherefore they cast from them
Gold Rings, or whatever is set in Gold, not being suffered either to
sleep or pray with them upon them; but at the same time they open
their Silver Phylacteries and Rosaries, wherein in Aggat are engraven
some Scraps of their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and uncovering their Heads they enter
their Churches, and fall down on the Ground, and as they recite
their Prayers, often kiss the same, always bowing towards the rising
and setting of the Sun, and agree with the <HI>Indian Moors</HI> in saluting
their <HI>Genii,</HI> and then they depart; unless on their Sabbath-day,
which is <HI>Friday</HI> every Week, the <HI>Mullah</HI> detain them by a Preach∣ment,
<PB N="343" REF="191"/>
or with a Chapter out of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. XI.</NOTE> which he undertakes
to expound by a large, and, no doubt, learned <HI>Periphrasis,</HI> to whom
on the <HI>South</HI>-side they have appropriated a Pulpit raised on Steps, if it
may be said to be one without any Desk or Rails, on which he sits,
not stands, it being placed in an Oratory apart.</P>
<P>Sometimes they pass about by little Portals to the Door of the
Temple, such an Ostle being left open, as we see in great Gates of
Noblemens Houses, that he who is about to go in, must first take
heed lest he break his Shins, before he stoop to make his Entrance:
This Place carries something solemn about it; when it is shut up,
the Pulpit receives a small Light through Grates instead of Windows.</P>
<P>The Colleges in <HI>Spahaun</HI> are mostly founded and endowed by
Royal Donation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colleges.</NOTE> partly by others.</P>
<P>There are Twenty or Thirty Fair Ones that have Incomes, and
many more whose Mannors are devolved by a tacit Prescript into
Secular Hands. To every College there is a President over the Stu∣dents,
and another over the Fabrick, who lets out the Chambers,
and receives the Rents, disposing them as he pleases, and displacing
at pleasure: Every Chamber has One, Two, Three, or more Stu∣dents,
where they sit and lye; to this the ordinary Door stands for
a Window; there are no Forms or Benches, more than an old
Moth-eaten Carpet, not fit for a Gypsy's Mantle, for to use, either
for Repose or other purpose.</P>
<P>The Number of Scholars in each depends upon the Number of
Chambers, and the Constancy of the Revenues, there being in
some not above Forty, in others from an Hundred to an Hundred
and fifty: He who is elected into these, lives sparingly and sepa∣rately,
not eating in common Halls, having no more allowed than
two or three <HI>Gosbeeks</HI> a Day, which is about so many <HI>Stivers</HI> or Far∣things,
from the President; if these are not enough, then he assigns
the Transcription of such and such Books to his Aid, for which
they are paid. There are also three, four, or more Servants in con∣stant
Salary from the College, which any Student may of Right
command to buy Fruit for their Food, and fetch them other Neces∣saries;
who sometimes, Illiterate as they are, go away with some
of the College Revenues, and are reckoned among the Students;
being fitter to shooe Horses, or drive a Wain with <HI>Vespasian</HI>'s Cha∣rioteer,
than to share in that Character.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Balneos</HI> or Hummums are the most sumptuous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hummums, or <HI>Balneos.</HI></NOTE> which are
in all their Cities, always hot; and it is lawful for every one of both
Sexes, on stated times of the Day to bath for a small Price: The
Prepositor of each House gives Notice to all Comers by blowing
an Horn, when the Houses are ready to attend them; of which
there are innumerable destined to these uses, each striving to outshine
the other; insomuch that no time either of Day or Night passes, but
you shall hear perpetual Noises of Horns to invite you to them; for
no sooner is the Fire kindled under them, but they let every one
know by those loud Instruments.</P>
<P>In which Places the Treatment is alike to all; for as before was
said in the Church and Inns, so in the Hot-Houses all things are com∣mon
to all: Wherefore if any one desire to be freed from the Vul∣gar
<PB N="344" REF="192"/>
Rout, he must hire an House for a whole Day; which may be
done, if he pay the usual Expence and Income of that Day, which
Christians are always obliged to, where they have not <HI>Balneos</HI> of
their own to resort to; for the <HI>Persians</HI> presume too Pharisaically on
these Baths, judging thereby all their Offences to be washed away;
according to that of <HI>Lactantius, Flagitiis omnibus inquinati veniunt,
&amp; semet sacrificasse opinantur, si cutem laverint; tanquam libidines in∣tra
pectus inclusas, ulla amnis abluat aut maria ulla purificent:</HI> They
come polluted with the heinousest Sins, and think when they have
washed they have attoned by a sufficient Sacrifice; as if any River or
Sea could purify their Lusts included in their Hearts.</P>
<P>These Houses are beneath the Earth, only some little round Globes
embellish'd with Painted Glass peep out above the Ground to give
Light, and are well clos'd, lest the ambient Air should offend by too
forcible a Ventilation through any neglected Crevise: They are built
with divers distinct Cells one from another, in which Men sit, are
rubbed, and cleansed: Immediately within the Porch is the greatest
Cell, or rather a large Room, where they d'off their Cloaths, and
being undressed leave their Garments; in the middle of this Place
is a Cystern of cold Water coming into it by several Pipes: All the
other Cells are so conveniently framed, that every one may breathe
a different Air as to the degrees of Heat, such as may suit with the
divers Temperaments of several Bodies, since every Constitution re∣quires
not the same Bath: For as <HI>Galen</HI> has left it written <HI>in lib.</HI> 7.
<HI>Morb. Med.</HI> Some want an Hot, others a Tepid, and others a Cold
Bath, as Hectical Habits declare.</P>
<P>The Pavements are all Marble, on which, the more Hot Water is
thrown, the more it increases the Heat, although at the same time
the Subterranean Fire be as Hot as it can be: On these Marble Floors
they at last extend themselves, when they think they have tarried in
long enough, that the Barbers, whose business it is, should wind
and turn every Limb and Joint of the Body, before, behind, and on
every side, with that Dexterity and Slight, that it is admirable to
behold them perform it; whereby they leave no Muscle, Nerve, or
superficial Joint, either unmov'd, or not rubb'd: Then with a course
Hair-cloth and Hot Water they scrape off all the Filth and Sweat;
and last of all by a Depilatory they take clean away all manner of
Hairs growing either in Secret Parts, or any Emunctuary to cause
either nasty Smells, or troublesome chasing.</P>
<P>When they retire to put on their Cloaths, (this is to be only un∣derstood
of Great Men) there waits them a Collation of Fruit,
Sweetmeats, and variety of Perfumes, as Rosewater, Rackbeet, and
the like, with all befitting Attendants, besides the usual Servitors, to
administer either Coho, Tea, Tobacco, or Brandy, if faint. When
they are dress'd, they emplaister their Feet and Hands with a Red
Paste, which wonderfully helps sweaty and moist Palms, as also
stinking Feet.</P>
<P>These things being premised, the Benefits coming from the use of
these are, when the Body is inflamed and dried by immoderate Heat,
it is finely refreshed by sweet Water, and the Pores become moisten'd;
the farther prosecution of which Advantages having been spoken of
<PB N="345" REF="192"/>
before, I refer you thither, and proceed to the other Houses of Re∣sort,
which are only for the Men, and not for the Women.</P>
<P>Their Coffee-houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Coffee-houses.</NOTE> where they sell <HI>Coho,</HI> better than any among
us, which being boiled, has a Black Oil or Cream swimming at
top, and when it has not, they refuse to drink it: Hither repair all
those that are covetous of News, as well as Barterers of Goods;
where not only Fame and common Rumour is promulged, but Poe∣try
too, for some of that Tribe are always present to reherse their
Poems, and disperse their Fables to the Company; so true is it,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Ex Otio Negotium,</HI> That their Business pro∣ceeds
from Idleness.</P>
<P>They are modell'd after the Nature of our Theatres, that every
one may sit around, and suck choice Tobacco out of long <HI>Malabar</HI>
Canes, fasten'd to Chrystal Bottles, like the Recipients or Bolt-heads
of the Chymists, with a narrow Neck, where the Bole or Head of the
Pipe is inserted, a shorter Cane reaching to the bottom, where the
long Pipe meets it, the Vessel being filled with Water: After this
sort they are mightily pleased; for putting fragrant and delightful
Flowers into the Water, upon every attempt to draw Tobacco, the
Water bubbles, and makes them dance in various Figures, which
both qualifies the Heat of the Smoke, and creates together a pretty
Sight.</P>
<P>At Night here are abundance of Lamps lighted, and let down
in Glasses from the Concave Part of the Roof, by Wires or Ropes,
hanging in a Circle.</P>
<P>The Buzzars having been mentioned before, I shall only add,
That however Great all their other Buildings are, yet these carry
away the Glory from them all; as much as the Halls of the Ci∣tizens
of <HI>London</HI> exceed Noblemens Houses about the City, being the
Work and Business of Joint-Stocks; and their Shews and Entertain∣ments
are as Pompous as Princes, however sparingly they live at
their own Homes: For these being the joint Advantage both of the
Emperor and his Subjects, he encourages their forwardness in adorn∣ing
these, though he suppresses all their Extravagancy of Garb, or
Exorbitancy in Building, if it bears not with it the becoming Design
of giving him the greatest Share of Honour in the Foundation.</P>
<P>Their Bridges are made either of Brick or Stone, and want neither
for Skill or Ornament in their Contrivance; and are chiefly built for
Ostentation, or to preserve their Memories, as their other great
Buildings are: They are of more Use to join divided Rocks for Pas∣sengers,
than to lay over Rivers; the former of which are more
frequent in the Road to the Port than the other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the present Inhabitants; of the Jews being interspersed ever
since the Captivity of Babylon; the Custom of exoculating
their Princes; Nobility among the Persians; the Esteem they
have of the Emperor's Person being Divine; his Name and
Succession: Of the English overthrowing the Portugals at
Ormus; the Procession of the Court; its Grandeur, and
Reception of Ambassadors: Of the Suffees; of their Ca∣valry,
Infantry, Seamen, and Navy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Inhabitants of this City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The present <HI>Persians Scy∣thians.</HI></NOTE> as well as of all <HI>Persia</HI> (the
Ancient Stock being, as it were, extinct) spring from the
Overflow of the <HI>Northern Scythians,</HI> by whom the Native <HI>Persians</HI>
were either totally expell'd, or so suppress'd, as to remain of no Ac∣count
among them: These notwithstanding, by the Benefit of the
Climate, have chang'd so much of their innate Roughness, as they
have acquired the more coruscant Beauty inherent in the Temper of
the Air; for they are of a delicate Composure of Body, Tall and
Strait, especially the Women, who though not generally so proper,
yet excel in Softness of Texture, and Comeliness of Form: Their
Outside is no false Indication of their Natural Ingenuity, which ex∣ceeds
all the <HI>Eastern</HI> People both for Facetiousness of Wit, Civil Be∣haviour,
and Gallantry in Appearance, as much as they do the Bar∣barous
<HI>Africans.</HI></P>
<P>They cohabit generally with their Relations together in one
House, or at least as near one the other as it is possible.</P>
<P><HI>Jews</HI> are among them of the same Antiquity as the Exportation
from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Babylon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jews</HI> here ever since the Cap∣tivity.</NOTE> who live in the same Cities, though in
distinct Streets, and with less Mark of Reproach here than elsewhere:
But how far their Liberties extend, I pretend not to tell; only they
congregate their Sabbaths, New Moons, and Feast days, in full
Synagogues, without any Disturbance.</P>
<P>Here are store of <HI>Banyans,</HI> dwelling in their great Inns, but de∣generate
from the strict <HI>Indian Banyans,</HI> indulging themselves in most
sorts of Flesh, and all kind of Wines.</P>
<P>In this City of <HI>Spahaun,</HI> besides the <HI>Romish</HI> Monks, Us, the <HI>Bel∣gian</HI>
Representative, and the <HI>Polish</HI> Ambassador, are no Christians
suffered to live; the rest repair to <HI>Jelfa</HI> among the <HI>Armenians,</HI> unless
accidentally some Strangers tarry a Night or two in a <HI>Caravan Ser
Raw,</HI> which are the Receptacles of all Foreigners.</P>
<P>These being of a lower Orb,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On the Death of their Em∣peror, the new one causes his Brothers and near Relations Eyes to be put out.</NOTE> creep safely on the Ground, while
those exalted to an higher Sphere, like Fortune its self, are set on slip∣pery
Places, and are deprived of their Eye-sight. Long since that
Barbarity has been exploded here, which as soon as the Witnesses of
Virility appeared, to testify their being Men not of an Hours Birth,
or of a Minutes rather, were delivered to bloody Villains, crueller
<PB N="347" REF="193"/>
than Beasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. XII.</NOTE> (whose unrelenting Mercy spar'd not the Royal Infants
Cries) to make away inhumanly, or at least suddenly dispatch them.
Such is the fatal necessity of Tyrants, that least can credit those that
are most allied to them; which addition to their Crimes they think
is somewhat extenuated by exoculating them only at this Court;
whereby they are render'd uncapable of the Throne, (being to be
presented to the Supreme Government, like the <HI>Levites</HI> in the Old
Law, without Blemish, being whole in every Member): But cer∣tainly
those are bound up in hard Circumstances, who to avoid
Disputes of Succession to the Crown, unmercifully butcher Tender
Innocents, hurrying them to Execution as soon as they have escaped
Imprisonment from their Mothers Womb: On this Basis the Old
Monarchy of the <HI>Persians</HI> was founded, as if no other Cement could
so firmly knit, as Blood.</P>
<P>And at this Instant their Jealousy is so fervent, that they keep
their Sons like Captives, till the Father's Death enlarges the Eldest;
when the Younger Brothers, Uncles, and Nephews on both sides,
on the Appearance of the Rising Sun, see their last: As if the Blood-Royal
were prophan'd, unless they fled to the Hot Iron, as the only
means to expiate for its Affinity; which being drawn over the most
sensible Parts (their Eyes), strikes from the Rays of their Kinsman's
Diadem such a Sparkling Lustre, as for ever after makes them irre∣coverably
blind; to seek Recovery whereof, or any for them, is a
Treason unpardonable. So abhorrent are they of a Partner or a Ri∣val
in Empire, that they endure not any to emulate or outdo them by
an overforward Strain of Loyalty, whereby they might seem obliged
to their Subjects, or that they should outshine them by a Popular Af∣fection,
however meritorious their Deeds have been; whereby they
teach their Children perfect Obedience, before they permit them to
think of Command.</P>
<P>But whether by this way it is best; to be conversant with Toothless
Old Women, Ignorant and Effeminate Eunuchs, a Tutor more ver∣sed
in Books than the Affairs of the World, and all these bound in
the highest Allegiance to their Liege, is a fitter Topick for the
<HI>Machiavilians</HI> of our Age, than for me to handle. Although <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI>
has delivered this as a Maxim to Posterity, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e who are ge∣nerously
and Princely instructed, let them be compared with these,
and the difference will presently discover its self which is the more
eligible Education: But for the Good of the Chief Ministers of State,
it is more profitable, I confess, to keep their Princes Judgments al∣ways
in Minority, provided they can thereby make them more plia∣ble
to their Ends and Designs.</P>
<P>Contrary to the Principles of the rest of the <HI>East,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nobles by Birth among the <HI>Persians.</HI></NOTE> Nobility is re∣garded
and maintained among the <HI>Persians,</HI> confiding rather in their
Homebred Honesty; than entertaining Mercenary Foreigners in
their Armies, to whose Fidelity and Conduct most other Countries
commit their greatest Strength, while these rely on their own Sub∣jects:
For though they claim Nobility of Race, yet they are not of
the same Stock with the Royal Line, and therefore (content to
move beneath) aspire not to the Top of Empire; nor can they
stretch out their Hands to the Diadem, without apparent Usurpa∣tion,
<PB N="348" REF="194"/>
which those of an Equal Order would oppose, as having as
good a Title thereto as the bold Violator himself; which they who
are of a more sublime Spirit would never brook, much less bear such
an Indignity, or pay Homage and Respect to One they must have in
Scorn and Contempt. On this Account it is they have ample Lord∣ships
assigned them, which they possess by Inheritance and Lawful
Right, with the same Tenor as our Barons, who are before others
in Wealth and Honour, but are something restrained in their Power,
lest they should take up Arms against their King.</P>
<P>The Emperor often rewards these with great Offices and high
Employments, where he finds Desert meet with the Grandeur of
their Birth; gracing them with his Commands the rather, because
(to their Eternal Renown be it spoken) they seldom desert their
Sovereign, or prove unfaithful to the Throne: So innate a Sted∣diness
being ingrafted in their Souls, to conform themselves to their
Master's Wills, that they are always found obsequious; which if
it be not altogether to be attributed to their Virtue, must admit of
the Dread the Anger of their Emperor impresses (being like the
Roaring of a Lion), which frights the trembling Herds among the
Woods; for their Lives are immediately at his Dispose, which keeps
them in Awe.</P>
<P>They esteem their Emperors not only as Lords Paramount,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Govern∣ment Hierar∣chical.</NOTE>
but reverence them as Sons of the Prophets, whose Dominion
therefore is grounded more on Hierarchy than bare Monarchy. For
as of old the <HI>Persians</HI> adored the Sun as a Deity, and celebrated his
rising with Morning Hymns, and were daily employed in Sacred An∣thems
to its Praise; so now from Idolaters becoming Infidels, they
still espouse the Divine Right as well as Lineage of their Sovereigns:
From which fond Belief, the Potentest General at the Head of a
Puissant Army, or the Provincial <HI>Cauns,</HI> though surrounded with
Legions of Soldiers, upon the Arrival of a single <HI>Chuper</HI> (that is,
a Post with Royal Order), attended with no other Warrant than
being one of the King's Creatures, and he pronouncing Death from
the Emperor, they lay down their Heads without any Tumult, with
an entire Resignation to their Master's Pleasure.</P>
<P>And what is yet more ungrateful to men of their Jealousy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They refuse the Emperor nothing he commands.</NOTE> (it
being so base and dishonest, that no Reparation can be made among
the <HI>Moors</HI> for an Indignity of that kind) if he commands them on
the great Festival (begun by <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> and continued to this Day
by the <HI>Persian</HI> Monarchs, an Hundred and Fourscore Days every
Year) to bring their own proper Wives to Court, to remain there
all that time prostitute to his Lust; this so hated a thing they are so
far from refusing, that they obey him in every thing, no less than an
Immortal God.</P>
<P>From which piece of Service, no Man that is known to have an
Handsome Woman to his Wife, is exempted; for after his Pimps
and Panders have had the Scent, he is not long from the Hunt with
a full Cry: To that end, in whatsoever Quarter of the City the
Puss squats, he sets up his Crook, or Interdict, that no Man pre∣sume
to stay within doors, till he be passed whither he intends; but
in the mean while, the Females are permitted, nay, commanded to
<PB N="349" REF="194"/>
stay at home, and so he comes and finds the Form, and then is sure
not to miss of his Game. But to close up this; so devoted are they to
him, that as the Ancient <HI>Hebrews</HI> swore by their King's Health; the
<HI>Egyptians,</HI> by the Life of <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> the <HI>Romans,</HI> by <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Honour;
they have no more obliging Test, than <HI>Seir Pedeshaw,</HI> By the Em∣peror's
Head.</P>
<P>On these Terms it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whereon is grounded the Emperor's Se∣curity.</NOTE> that the Affairs at home, and of the Mi∣litia
abroad, are so negligently treated, by the Emperor's being tho∣roughly
assured of his Peoples Integrity and Allegiance; all the strong
Castles and Places through the whole Realm hereupon being demo∣lished,
or lying in Ruins; unless some few near the Confines of
<HI>Turky,</HI> and <HI>Candahar,</HI> taken from the <HI>Indians;</HI> slighting them only
as Nests for Thieves and Robbers, well knowing when it comes to
the Push, the Mountains will prove the better Security: Nor is the
Army at present in a much forwarder Posture for Fight, it being
vilely defective in its Musters; but the worst provided of all are
the Fleets in either Seas.</P>
<P>When at the same time the Treasury never more abounded in
Cash,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Wealth.</NOTE> holding thereby the Sinews of War in his own hands; for
which reason he sleeps, while the Burthen of the Kingdom is re∣jected,
and the Weight thereof lies on the Chancellor's Shoulders.
He has not for these Eleven Months past stirred out of his Pa∣lace,
nor on any occasion shewed himself in publick; which hath
created matter of doubt to the Populacy, whether he be well, or
seized with any Distemper: But those that are better informed (for
even the Actions of Princes cannot escape being canvass'd, however
absolute they are) suspect him to be wallowing in his Libidinous
Course of Life.</P>
<P>He lives like a Tyrant in his Den;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Course of Life.</NOTE> for his Domesticks and his
Whores, with whom he commits Bestialities (which are innume∣rable)
often feel his Cruelty by unheard of Tortures; as witness the
dilacerated Bodies found after the Removal of his Tents on any Pro∣gress;
in confirmation whereof are many living Examples about this
City, of those that have been his Menial Servants, conversant about
his necessary Affairs, who slipping in any one Point, are daily to be
seen escaping with their Lives, but not without the loss of some
Member, sacrific'd to the Rage of an unreasonable Master. He is a
Winebibber and a Drunkard; they reporting, That he is able, after
his full Dose has already made him reel, to drink a large Flask, more
than a Gallon, of <HI>Siras</HI> Wine, before he can be said to finish this Ex∣ploit
by a silent consenting to have had enough: Nor can Sleep heal
him, for as soon as he hath outworn his Dose, he with most greedy
haste returns to his Vomit before he comes to himself; or if by
chance he happen to be sober, the Brute gets up, and he is lost
among the Women: To crown all, he is cursedly Covetous, beneath
the Majesty of so great a Monarch, repining even at ordinary Ex∣pences:
Whose Name, for fear it should perish, we come next to
mention.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Name is <HI>Shaw Schelymon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Name and Genealo∣gy.</NOTE> or King <HI>Solomon,</HI> the Son

her Worthy Husband; so that he is sprung from Kings of long Con∣tinuance:
Which to understand the more clearly, we are to unfold
the Succession from <HI>Sardanapalus</HI> his Reign, the last from <HI>Nimrod:</HI>
After his killing himself, the Empire was divided into the Monarchy
of the <HI>Assyrians, Chaldeans,</HI> and <HI>Medes.</HI></P>
<P>Begun by <HI>Arbaces</HI> in the Year of the World, 3146. and ended by
<HI>Cyrus,</HI> who restored the Ancient Honour to the <HI>Persian</HI> Sway; to
whom succeeded <HI>Cambyses.</HI> After him, the Impostor <HI>Smerdis</HI> ob∣tained
the Kingdom by the Craft of the <HI>Magi,</HI> until the Noble

When by the general Suffrage it was agreed, That he of
Seven Competitors should be Emperor, whose Horse should Neigh
first after they came to the Place appointed for the Choice; which
Lot fell upon <HI>Darius Hydaspes,</HI> through the Cunning of his Groom,
who caused his Masters Horse to Leap a Mare the Day before in the

elevated to the Supreme Dignity; from whom <HI>Darius</HI> the <HI>Mede,</HI> van∣quished
by <HI>Alexander,</HI> was the Fifth in order; at whose Decease the
Power was distracted among the Captains of the Conqueror; till
<HI>Artabaces</HI> reunited it to <HI>Parthia</HI> first of all; then <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> by

<PB N="351" REF="195"/>
as among us Papists and Protestants we dispute about the Lawful Suc∣cessor

Lawfully inducted into the Caliphship; and though hereby in pro∣cess
of time the Caliphship and Empire were united, <HI>Adir Suffee</HI>
maintaining his Claim and his Sons, at last got honourably enough
into the Throne; yet here arose matter of perpetual Animosity, ne∣ver

<P>Lastly, Should have the First Seat in the Council, and their
Agents be looked on with equal Grace to their Prime Nobility.</P>
<P>The Articles being Ratified on either side, the Enterprise is under∣taken;
though of it self it was too great an Action for one Ship to
perform, or even a well-appointed Navy, had they been upon their
Guard (or any Commander to Promise without the Consent of the
King his Master) wherefore the <HI>English</HI> betake themselves to Stra∣tagem,
and gaining leave to Careen their Ship under their Guns,
whilst the <HI>Portugals</HI> dreamt nothing less, they poured in Men (the
<HI>Persians</HI> being hid under Deck) at unawares, that they were put
into a Consternation before they could think of their Defence;
whereby they became Masters presently of the Castle, strengthned
both by Sea and Land, by this unexpected Attempt Vanquished,
which otherwise was Invincible; being possessed whereof by this
Rape, the rest of the Island soon fell prostrate to the Lust of the Sur∣prisers;
and the <HI>English</HI> having got their Booty, left the Christians
(Oh Impiety)! to be spoiled by the Infidels.</P>
<P>Which thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vengeance persues the Enterprisers.</NOTE> as it gained us Esteem among the <HI>Persians,</HI> was the
utter Ruin of the <HI>Lusitanian</HI> Greatness, it ever since declining, and
is almost at its fatal Catastrophe; for immediately upon this, their
Fleet before <HI>Muschat</HI> is Defeated, and they were driven out of all
their strong Places in the Gulf, so that the Loss was greater than if
they had lost <HI>Mosambique,</HI> from whence they have their Gold;
because all the Trade of the World centred here, all Merchandize
both going and coming paid them Tribute; that the Wealth of this
place thus entred was incredible; yet to see the just Vengeance
<PB N="353" REF="196"/>
(where private Avarice and Pelf is preferred before Virtue and Ho∣nesty,
and a due Respect to the only Supreme Deity) overtakes
those Wretches who were the cause of their Overthrow. How it
fell out with the <HI>Persians,</HI> who seemed to have the juster Cause, I
cannot tell; but some of Those People now alive, who were the Un∣doers
of These, are as Miserable, and it may be more, than
those they made so; the Captain's Children having been known to
go anights to the Brew-house for Grains for their Subsistence, and the
rest of them who are still surviving are the unhappy scorn of all that
know them; whereas they thought by this deed to have purchased a
lasting Fame, and lived to have enjoyed their Ill-got Goods; which
how it did thrive at home, those from whose Information I take this,
have been, in part, Eye-witnesses; but here I am sure, at this time
both <HI>Persians, Arabs,</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> fare the better for it, while they
have divided among themselves what was entirely the <HI>Portugals;</HI>
the <HI>Persians</HI> in the mean while doing what they please with us, so
that at this present, all things considered, they allow us little more
than a Name; but even here the truth must be confessed, it is be∣cause
we have no Ships to guard the Gulf; which if done, and the
<HI>Persians</HI> could be made to stand to their first Terms, in my Opinion
must turn to a good account, and be a thing of greater concern than
can be well managed by less than a Royal Company; though as things
now stand they have free recourse to <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> this Sea
being open, which was always kept shut by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> to their no
small profit.</P>
<P>This Emperor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shaw Abass</HI> Kills his Son <HI>Mirza.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Shaw Abas,</HI> in whose time this was Atchiev'd, was
Cotemporary with our King <HI>James</HI> I. who had been happy in a Son,
if the Fates had not envied so great a Man his Father's Favour; but for
his Virtue he reaped Hatred; for there were not wanting fawning
Parasytes, who abused the Emperor's Ears by spreading abroad, and
casting out words, as if his Son <HI>Mirza Suffee</HI> courted the Popular
Air; whereupon he withdrew his Countenance, and deprived him
of the common Light, by that barbarous Custom of the hot Iron
drawn over his Eye-balls; but seeing that could not sufficiently break
his Spirit, he having gone thus far, could not rest till he had per∣fected
his Mortality by Poyson: Thus what Virtue had raised to
full growth, Jealousy soon cut off, although he could leave no bet∣ter
Effigies of his Manners, Virtue, Constancy, Piety, and towardly
Disposition, than his Son <HI>Suffee;</HI> to whom our Countryman <HI>Dreyden</HI>
has ventured to give Immortality in his Tragedy called, <HI>The Sophy;</HI>
which</P>
<P><HI>Suffee</HI> after his Grandfather's death enjoyed the Throne; who
when he gave place to Death; permitted</P>
<P><HI>Shaw Abas</HI> the Good, who was the Father of</P>
<P><HI>Shaw Scholymon,</HI> the present Emperor:</P>
<P>Who is a Man of a good Presence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The present Emperor given up to Debauchery.</NOTE> and of no mean Capacity, unless
by indulging his Body he thickens his Understanding, as well as he
has made his Body Gross; he is Tall and very Fleshy, so that when
he stirs or laughs, all the Muscles of the Scapula, as well as Ribs,
<PB N="354" REF="197"/>
move together. In the beginning of his Reign, like another <HI>Nero,</HI>
he gave good Specimens of his Inclinations, not unworthy the He∣roes
that were his Ancestors; but when he began to hearken to Flat∣terers,
and give himself over to Idleness, he left off to Govern, and
listed himself in the service of Cruelty, Drunkenness, Gluttony,
Lasciviousness, and abominable Extortion, where he perpetrated
things not only uncomely to be seen, but even offensive to the Ears;
wherefore at his libidinous Feasts, to enquire what he transacts, or
how he behaves himself, is fitter for an <HI>Aretin</HI> than a modest
Author.</P>
<P>But when he is enthroned and encompassed with the flower of his
Courtiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of receiving Ambassadors.</NOTE> and gives Audience to Foreign Ministers; the manner is
thus:</P>
<P>An Ambassador is Introduced his Presence by the Master of the
Ceremonies, who instructs him and tells him his Duty; the Emperor
is Seated on a Throne alone, boulstred up by Embroidered Cushions;
his Counsellors are placed behind him, with Caps on, proper to the
Kings and Magi of <HI>Persia,</HI> the Emperor being distinguished only
by one White Plume of Feathers from theirs; when the Ambassa∣dor
enters his Presence, he makes three profound Obeysances, after
which he is permitted to deliver his Message, and then produces his
Presents to the Emperor, having gratified the Chief Officers before
his Admission.</P>
<P>Those Men of Note that are Governors, or <HI>Cauns,</HI> stand now at∣tending
with Guns hung over their Shoulders, performing the Ser∣vice
of our Gentlemen Pensioners: If the Emperor is pleased to
Honour the Person entring, or is pleased with the Message, he or∣ders
him to sit at his Feet, and a Table to be richly spread: About
the King stand Vessels of Gold beset with Gems, and the Carpets,
are of high Value, one of which, not a Yard Square, I saw
worth Fourscore <HI>Thomands;</HI> and all his Plates he Eats out of, are Gold
inlaid, or beset with Jewels, as well as the Cups he Drinks out of;
as <HI>Lipsius</HI> Notes the Custom of Old; <HI>Capacibus gemmis inter se
propinarent:</HI> So <HI>Lucan, Gemmaeque capaces excipere Merum;</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI>
confirms it in <HI>ver. 4. Non pauca pocula ex auro, quoe ut mos est, Regibus
&amp; maxime in Syria gemmis erant distincta clarissimis.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever Cup the Ambassador is drunk to out of by the Empe∣ror,
whether of Gold Enammelled, or beset with Jewels, it is fil∣led
with the same Liquor, and the Cup is his Fee of Right, which,
first Pledging the Emperor, he receives and carries away with him:
The Civility of the Court being passed, he is Clothed with his Reti∣nue
in an honourable Habit; and if the Petition be granted, he
wears the <HI>Pharmond</HI> open in his Turbat, to be seen by all as he is re∣conducted
from the Palace to his Lodging.</P>
<P>When the King pleases to Mount on Horseback, he is guarded by
a mighty Band of Horsemen that follow him; before him pass a
Legion of Footmen, all with Guns, and Shotters, or Pages, about
his Horse in great Crouds; these all wear Feathers; the first in a
kind of Hat or Steeple-Crowned Cap, the other in their Turbats,
which are covered with them, but the Gunmen have only one Plume
<PB N="355" REF="197"/>
bolt upright; the others are of any Colour, and sometimes many
Colours.</P>
<P>When the Emperor marches out with his Women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Processi∣on of the <HI>Se∣raglio,</HI> or <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ram.</HI></NOTE> and all the Se∣raglio,
it is forbidden the Day before by a Publick Cryer, for any
Man on pain of Death to invade his Walks; nor is it lawful for any
one to stay within doors, though sick or decrepit with Age, till the
Female Procession is passed by; which observes this Order; The
King, like a Dunghil Cock, struts at the Head of the <HI>Amazonian</HI>
Army; him, his Mother follows, and the Royal Consorts, which
are reckoned as Wives; all the rest, Concubines or Slaves, accord∣ing
to the Grace they have merited; carrying Hawks on their Fists,
get a straddle on Horseback, bearing Consort to the Musick
<HI>Gereed, i. e.</HI> Tilt and Turnament, play with the Ball as Men do.
For this Effeminate Shew, <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Description for <HI>Dido</HI> may serve:
<Q><L>Oceanum interea surgens Aurora reliquit,</L>

<Q><L>The early Morn had left the Sea,</L>
<L>And flaming Day bore Company;</L>
<L>When the Gelt Youth afore the doors,</L>

<L>Where in as ample manner wait</L>
<L>The fiery Courser, full of State;</L>
<L>Bedeck'd with Gold he chews the Bit,</L>
<L>And paws and foams as he were hit.</L>
<L>At length comes forth with a great Train,</L>
<L>The mighty Monarch through a Lane:</L>
<L>A Scarlet Cloak, edg'd with a Welt,</L>
<L>Was thrown him o're, and hid his Belt.</L>
<L>But the Women that went with him,</L>
<L>Were clad with Silk, and may be Linen.</L>
<L>Yet all their Hair was ti'd in Braids,</L>
<L>And Bow and Arrow by their sides.</L></Q></P>
<P>If he chuse a Nocturnal Perambulation, he makes them put on the
Dress of the several Nations they belong to; <HI>Europeans</HI> in Hat and
Feather; <HI>Turks, Indians,</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> in their own Habit; and
having Tapers in their hands they go two and two abreast; and be∣tween
every third File an Eunuch with a large Flambeaux marches,
bot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spy and Guard.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="198"/>
The Soldiers that are to guard the Outskirts, are relieved by a
Band of Eunuchs, who line the Way for their Passage, and spare none
that are led out of Curiosity to behold this Sight; but upon disco∣very,
never examining who they are, discharge their Pieces, as if
they had found a Wild Beast; for which they receive great Com∣mendation
from the King, and are rewarded with great Gifts, get∣ting
thereby into the Chief Places of Trust in the Family.</P>
<P>The most ready for this Mischief are the Black Eunuchs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cruelty of the Black Eunuchs.</NOTE> the
White being generally more sparing of Life, and less inclined to such
unnatural Barbarities; wherefore he has Regiments of both, the
one to serve his Pleasure, the other his Black Purpose.</P>
<P>Thus is the Life of this Prince taken up, rarely permitting him∣self
to be seen either by Strangers or his own Subjects; according
to that Ancient Axiom of the Empire, <HI>Majestati major è longinquo re∣verentia;</HI>
as if they feared that of <HI>Livy, Continuus aspectus minus
verendos magnos homines facit;</HI> Lest an often appearing to the Vulgar
should make them contemptible and common.</P>
<P>But that which he least cares for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cavalry.</NOTE> is to go forth armed at the Head
of his Army, against his Enemies, chusing rather to be Terrible at
Home under the <HI>Persian</HI> Banner, (which when displayed, is, A
Bloody Sword with a double Point, in a White Field, and is always
carried next the Emperor's Person) than become Formidable abroad
to his Foes: Let others reap those hazardous Praises of Grinning
Honour, he has no Stomach nor no Mind to Feats of Arms, whilst
<Q><L><HI>Colorogosse,</HI> the <HI>Generalissimo,</HI> leads the Host.</L>
<L><HI>Corgee Bashee,</HI> Adjutant-General, is next him, Commander of
Twelve thousand Horse.</L>
<L><HI>Min Bashee</HI> is a Colonel of a Thousand Horse.</L>
<L><HI>Eus Bashee,</HI> Captain of an Hundred Horse.</L></Q></P>
<P>Below this Office none of Noble Extract will accept, chusing ra∣ther
to ride Volunteers till they gain Preferment, being listed <HI>Goloomy
Shaws,</HI> the King's Slaves, which is a Title they of the highest
Dignity pride themselves in.</P>
<P>Under these, those who compose the Main Body of the Cavalry,
are the <HI>Cusle Bashees,</HI> or with us, the Chevaliers; who are not left
quite without hopes of rising by a just Desert, for the Prize lies open
to them as well as others; and they are often advanced on that score
to great Authority, both to animate them to atchieve, and their
Superiors to prevent their being put over their heads; for, <HI>Ʋbi ho∣nos
non est, ibi cupiditas gloria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> esse non potest:</HI> Where Honour is not
the Recompence, there can hardly be a desire of Glory. Where∣fore
of these are made Sub-centurions, Commanders of Fifty, and
so downwards to Ten Horses.</P>
<P>These,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms, and manner of fighting.</NOTE> agreeable to the Old <HI>Scythian</HI> Custom, smite their Enemies
with Arrows at a distance, and Hand to Fist fight with Sword and
Spear, (though they are long since skill'd in Weapons of another
nature, as Guns and Pistols.) Their Bows are shorter than ours, not
made of Wood, but glutinated Horn; which being not so long, makes
them more serviceable on Horseback; but being made of Horn, they
<PB N="357" REF="198"/>
are less fit for Rainy Weather: They draw their Bows with the
Thumb armed with an Horn Ring, not after the same manner as
our Archers do. The full number of their Cavalry may be Sixty
thousand Horsemen compleat, many whereof are double-hors'd;
out of so great a Strength, Six thousand Horsemen are upon constant
Duty every day.</P>
<P>More than these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Suffees,</HI> a War like Or∣der of Church Militants.</NOTE> as a <HI>Guard du Corps</HI> to the King's Majesty, when
he is to take the Air abroad (within doors they are Footmen, abroad
Horsemen) a select Band wait on his Person, of the same Race with
the King, challenging Kindred with <HI>Adir Suffee,</HI> but of a lower
Stock than to conspire against the Empire, and are therefore bound
in a common Tye of Consanguinity to preserve a firm Faith for the
Head of their Tribe, as well as the Common Father of the Coun∣trey:
And since their Pretence reaches no higher than a Superstitious
Affinity, or Adoption rather, the Throne is so far out of danger by
them, that they are the Chief Pillars that support it; they being
allowed to brag both of their being of the Blood of their Emperor
and their Prophet, which obliges them to a double Obedience both
of Children and Subjects.</P>
<P>The countenancing of this Sect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Erected to check the <HI>Siads.</HI></NOTE> is not to be ascribed to this plau∣sible
Argument, more than to put a Check to the growing Perverse∣ness
of the <HI>Siads,</HI> boasting their Original from <HI>Mahomet</HI> himself, and
to be more immediately sprung from his House and Lineage: These
are so bold as to infringe the Royal Prerogatives, and to let the Em∣peror
know, That whenever he girts his Sword about him, he ought
to draw it only in their Defence, and at their Commands; not de∣spotically
to rule according to his own Dictates, but patiently sub∣mit
to their Instructions: This Order is uneasy under Monarchy,
nor are they for any Government where they are not uppermost. A
Doctrine unpleasant to the Absoluteness of the <HI>Persian</HI> Emperors;
and had not the Sword of the one the prevalency of the others Preach∣ing,
it were no ways to be redressed; for as the one keeps them in
Awe, so the Reverence paid the other on account of their Religion,
makes them presume to inveigh, and often raise Factions against their
Princes.</P>
<P>Wherefore the Foresight of their August Ancestry is commenda∣ble,
in providing another Church-Militant Tribe to suppress and re∣claim
the Insolencies of the <HI>Siads;</HI> for out of respect to their own
Laws, which are still unalterable, as well as to withhold their Hands
from violating what the People repute as Sacred, they rather sought by
one Nail to drive out another, than openly to denounce War against
them: Wherefore when they find themselves perplexed with the
same Dilemma, they seek not to abrogate any former Decree of their
Emperors by a direct Contradiction, but study to impugn it some
other ways: As for Example; In <HI>Shaw Abas</HI> the Great's time, on
the days of their Feasts and Jubilees, Gladiators were approved and
licensed; but feeling afterwards the Evils that attended that Liberty,
which was chiefly used in their <HI>Hossy Gossy,</HI> any private Grudge being
then openly revenged; it never was forbid, but it passed into an
Edict by the following King, That it should be lawful to kill any
found with Naked Swords in that Solemnity. And on these substan∣tial
<PB N="358" REF="199"/>
grounds this new Order enjoys not only the Name of <HI>Suffees,</HI>
but the Emperor himself will be their Captain, and suffers none else
to head them, and thence takes on him the specious Name and Title
of <HI>Grand Suffee;</HI> and to perpetuate their Memory, has given it in∣delibly
to <HI>Spahaun,</HI> for this reason joined with the former, to be cal∣led
<HI>Suffahaun.</HI></P>
<P>To distinguish these from the others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Habit, and the <HI>Persi∣an</HI> Standard Red and White.</NOTE> who cloathe themselves in
Green Attire, and forbid it to any else, they wear an high Red Vel∣vet
Cap, plaited at top like a Cap of Maintenance; whence on a
Wooden Crest they fix a little Brass Ball, tied on with three wreathen
Chains, which they bring down strait to the fore-part of the Bonnet,
whose lower Brim is bound about with a White Sash, and some∣times
a Plume of one Feather is set up with the Crest, much after the
same Fashion the Noble Senators wear in the King's Presence: Besides
which they have a Surcoat of Scarlet Cloth, as it were in defiance
to the Grass green of the <HI>Siads;</HI> so much monopolized by them,
that in <HI>Turky,</HI> if any other wear it, he pays dearly for his Folly:
The <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Standard is also of that Colour, being called
<HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Banner: In opposition to whom, the <HI>Grand Suffee</HI> erects a
double-pointed Bloody Sword in a White Field, and brings it out in
honour of <HI>Mortis Ally.</HI></P>
<P>To his adopted Kindred (now Regulars under him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Privi∣leges.</NOTE> their Chief)
are many Privileges granted, and by them to be held inviolable.</P>
<P>They are allowed a peculiar <HI>Missa,</HI> or Service, in a Chappel apart
in the <HI>Alacoppe,</HI> or place where the Grand Council sit, where they
attend the King, or one in his stead, every <HI>Friday</HI> Night, at the Sa∣crament
of <HI>Holway,</HI> (or Wafer made up in Sweetmeats,) in Imita∣tion
of the Shew-bread.</P>
<P>When any one has run into Debt, or committed any Capital Crime,
as Murther, Adultery, Theft, or the like; if the one to defraud
his C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>editor, and the other to avoid the hands of Justice, make their
Escape to the <HI>Alacoppe,</HI> the first Gate of the Palace-Royal, or to the
King's Stables, and implore their Protection, and they engage for
their Refuge, it is a Piacular Offence to force them thence; nor will
they resign them to the Emperor, though he command them to be
taken from their Sanctuary.</P>
<P>Nor are they so wholly devoted to compassionate others Afflicti∣ons,
as to defend their own Rights; for whosoever's Face the Em∣peror
commands them to cover, they are dead in Law; nor will
they scruple being Executioners, no more than the <HI>Roman</HI> Lictors,
who bore the Rods and Axes; the latter of which are their proper
Weapons of War, as well as a fit Badge of their Office.</P>
<P>Their prescribed Number cannot enlarge its self to all of their
Sect; wherefore they are interspersed among the common People,
some following Trades and Husbandry, and others other Employ∣ments;
retaining always their Habit, which none of the Vulgar
dare affront or strike, however provoked; but taking off their <HI>Suf∣fean</HI>
Cap first, and kissing it, laying it down reverently, they will not
then be afraid to cuff them, or drub them to purpose; being careful
in the mean while to offer no Indignity to the Order, while they
revenge themselves on the Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="199"/>
Besides these, there is another Mark of Honour wholly in the
King's Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Knights.</NOTE> and never bestowed but on those of the Prime No∣bility,
and those who have endeared him by some famous Perfor∣mance,
for which they are signalized by wearing a small Kettle∣drum
at the Bow of their Saddles in their Cities; which at first was
invented for the training of Hawks, and to call them to the Lure, and
is worn in the Fields by all Sportsmen for that end; but he who is
rewarded with it from the King, is a Man of Supreme Dignity; and
therefore,
<Q><L>—Titulo dignatus equestri</L>
<L>Virtutem titulis titulos virtutibus ornans.</L></Q>
<Q><L>—A Knight of high Degree</L>
<L>Adorns his Title by his Chivalry.</L></Q></P>
<P>And thus having muster'd the Horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Infantry.</NOTE> let us dismount and take an
Account of the Foot, who are not so formidable for Multitudes as
Valour; the Infantry are all Gun-men, and are better in Garison,

because having been brought up under that Discipline, they are un∣acquainted
with any other way of Engagement. But the <HI>Georgian</HI>
Veterans (who are in the same nature among the <HI>Persians,</HI> as the

<P>The lowest Degree of all these are the Watchmen on the Roads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Watch∣men.</NOTE>
maintained at the Charge of the <HI>Shawbunder,</HI> to clear the Ways of
Robbers, and to demand Custom; for which, if any are set upon, in

no Charge, neither does the Merchant or Traveller suffer the Da∣mage;
but whatever is entred at the Custom-house, the <HI>Shawbunder</HI>
becomes obliged to see safe through the Kingdom, and makes full Sa∣tisfaction

<PB N="361" REF="200"/>
Books are all written with the Pen by great Industry and Pains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. XIII.</NOTE> not
committed to the Press; wherefore they are chargeable, and less free
from Errors; to correct which, they compare with others more cor∣rect,
one reading with a loud Voice, while the other takes notice of
the Faults: They reckon Fifty Letters to a Verse, and for a Thou∣sand
Verses of ordinary Writing, they give Two <HI>Abcees;</HI> from Five
to Ten and upward, for that which is more exquisite; after this rate
are their Books for Sale valued. An Account of the Character being
stated, they numerate the Verses of any one Page, and multiplying
the other Pages thereby, the Price of the Book is produced: If there
be Lines of Gold, Silver, Oker, or the like, surrounding the Mar∣gin,
for Ornament, as is their Custom, they reckon nothing for
them, but bestow them <HI>gratis</HI> on the first Buyer, and only pass as
a better Grace to set off the Book; they being mightily taken with
a fair Hand and good Writing. This agrees with the Custom of the
Ancient <HI>Romans:</HI>

<P>They use <HI>Indian</HI> Ink,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pens made of Reeds.</NOTE> being a midling sort, betwixt our common
Ink, and that made use of in Printing: Instead of a Pen, they make

<P>The Children of Nobles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Education of Youth.</NOTE> or other Rich Men, are brought up at
home, not stirring out of their Houses without a Train of Eunuchs
and Servants, for fear of Sodomy, so much practised among the
pestilent Sect of <HI>Mahometans:</HI> Other Children of Inferior Rank are
taught in their Publick Schools for a small matter.</P>
<P>Their Childhood being passed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preposterous way of Learn∣ing.</NOTE> and they beginning to write Man,
they frequent the Schools and Colleges, and every one chuses a Ma∣ster
where he pleases; and having chose him, after a few Months
leaves him at his own Will, and goes over to another: For such a
strange Itch is here of Learning, that before they are half way in∣structed
in one Book, they are desirous to be perfected in another;
and before they have read Philosophy, Morality, or any other Sci∣ence
to qualify them, they leap into the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> for here are neither
Publick Professors to examine, or Publick Acts to be kept, either in
Divinity, Law, or Physick: They are constituted by the Primate of
their cursed Fabulous Doctrine, without formal Disputation, or other
Approbation than the Popular Fame, Interest of Friends, and a false
Appearance of a Pious Life, and are introduced by these means into
the Pensions and Benefices of their Wealthiest Mosques.</P>
<P>Whence it comes to pass that they are so inclinable to read to all
Comers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Emulation in gaining Disci∣ples.</NOTE>
for he whose Lectures are most frequented, stands fairest
in the Noisy Applause of the Town, and seldom misses of Promo∣tion;
though it is known many of them consume their Patrimony
in purchasing Disciples, and after all, reap nothing but Poverty for
their Pains: Which kind of Philosophers are always attended with
<PB N="362" REF="201"/>
Envy and Ambition; nor care they who they defame, may they
but extol themselves: And after a long Invective both of Master
and Scholar, against whomever they think fit to bespatter, or they
are in danger of being outdone by, insulting in the mean while
over them as the greatest Dunces and Asses in Nature; at length, out
of kindness to themselves, having stretched their own Worth to the
highest pitch (lest the swoln Bladder should burst by too much Wind)
they feign an humble self-reprehension; which because nothing
is more practised, I will use their own Phrase: <HI>Ezked tacrit goufton
ai behest amma hemme kess me donet.</HI> <Q>It is indecent for a Man to
speak his own Praise; but were I silent, this is a Justice you would
do me,</Q> it being nothing but what you know. Whereby it is vi∣sible,
if they abate of their own Tumour, it is likely to be very
little to the favour of him they declaim against.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these Tricks and disingenuous Insinuations, yet
this scabby Herd increases so, that they are at their Wits ends how to
live: Some find <HI>Mecoenas's</HI> among the Noblemen, and content them∣selves
to live slavishly, according to their Humours, for a Morsel of
Bread: Others, by saving what they have scraped up from the poor
Trade of Scribes, and teaching School, hire an House, purchase an
Horse, and a Servant to run before them, (it being a sign of the
greatest Poverty to foot it through the City); and if by good
Luck they get a Name, and are reputed Men of Note for Learning,
they then enlarge their Stock and Family: And these are they that
pride themselves in being the greatest Doctors among them, and so
set up for Academies of their own; and teach <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Dialect,
and the Four Figures of Syllogism; though the Question being pro∣pounded,
they bind not themselves up to the strict Rules thereof;
but they beg the Premise by way of Interrogation, as a Truth grant∣ed,
and from thence draw their Conclusions.</P>
<P>The Terms of Negation and Concession are exotic among the
<HI>Persians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Logick.</NOTE> contending that Distinctions and <HI>Laconical</HI> Evasions, on
which the Stress of the <HI>Aristotelian</HI> Doctrine seems to be laid, are
not to be held for the true Solution of the Argument; but by a long
Harangue and Affluence of Speech, the Auditors are brought both
to admire them, and be of their side; whereupon the greater the
Convention of Auditors is, the more earnest will their Contention
be; for to yield in such Assemblies, is not at all to be expected, un∣less
he that holds his Tongue first, intends to lose both his Credit and
his Cause.</P>
<P>Universals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Phy∣sicks.</NOTE> Catagories, and their depending Questions, they of∣ten
reject; concerning the nature of a Body, Place, Vacuum, Cor∣ruption,
Quantities, and Qualities, they inform their Students
after the <HI>Aristotelian</HI> way; being unacquainted with the Resolution
of Causes of Sublunary Beings by Atoms, according to our modern
<HI>Cartesian</HI> Disciples, revived in honour of <HI>Epicurus;</HI> whom they sup∣pose
they have sufficiently Confuted by the Name of <HI>Zimorat,</HI>
with some vain and boyish Instances against Composition without
Interruption and infinite Particles; preaching up a Vacuum, where∣by
they believe the Absurdity to be demonstrated.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="201"/>
In their Theology, after the Contemplation of One Eternal Di∣vinity,
after its Unity and Attributes, which they maintain to be
all one with its Essence; they hold the World to be from Eternity,
and such a Treatise of the Soul and Passions, with the other precisi∣ons
of the Intellect, which is no where to be found in Metaphysicks.
In these, as in their other Speculations, they cleave so pertinaciously
to their Books and undoubted Authors, as if it were piacular to de∣part
from their Traditions.</P>
<P>They fancy to themselves a Chimerical Creation of the World by
Ten Intelligencies, which by the same inexpugnable Reason passes in∣to
their Creed; and being freight with this Notion, they say, from
one most simple Cause can proceed no more than one Effect; and
therefore God framed the first Intelligence, and that mediating the
First Heaven, and so in their subaltern order to the Tenth.</P>
<P>That the World was many Ages before <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Metaphysicks</NOTE> (our first
Parents Eduction out of the Earth) Inhabited by Devils; and that
the Possession thereof was so long entrusted in their Hands, till they
had extirminated the true Worship of God (which at first they
applied themselves Religiously to observe) and gave themselves up
to Uncleanness and Prophaneness; when Man was Created in their
room, and they cast out of any farther Possession, and Men took
their Places.</P>
<P>That Souls were from all Eternity, and commanded by God on
the actual Exigency of any Body to enter a Relation, or a certain
dependency with them, not an Information, or real Presence, <HI>tota
in toto &amp; tota in quâlibet parte corporis vitam habentis;</HI> being all in all,
and all in every part where Life does exist; from this foolish Con∣ception
of theirs, they attribute Place and Circumscription to the
Soul; therefore they Object not a Spiritual, but a Corporal Sub∣stance
to be inferred.</P>
<P>They acknowledge Four kinds of Causes, <HI>viz.</HI> Material, Formal,
Efficient and Final; they allow not of an exemplary, but admit of
a total Cause; by which they understand such an one as no conditi∣on
is defective to put it into Act; and on these Foundations they
suppose the World's Creation from Eternity to be enough proved.</P>
<P>The Books of greatest vogue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Books in Esteem</NOTE> are those of <HI>Corge Nessir Tussi,</HI> of
the City <HI>Tuss,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Korasam,</HI> wrote Five hundred
years ago; he, as it is credible, understood the <HI>Greek</HI> Lan∣guage
as well as others; from whence he has explained some Anci∣ent
Authors, as <HI>Euclid, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olomy's</HI> Alguma and Opticks, and has re∣duced
them into a Compendium, as also the Works of <HI>Plato.</HI>
Some Expositors they have of their Law, with Rules of Justice and
Morality; which they admire and extol to the Skies, and rest impli∣citly
on the <HI>ipse dixit</HI> of their Prophet, never enquiring farther:
If any thing happen to oppose common Sense, they protract the
meaning Mysteriously or Anagogically, not to the disquisition of the
Truth, but to defend their Fopperies. Among which they have in
the first esteem, the Written Letter of their Prophet, as immediately
prescribed by him, and these are Oracular. In the Second place,
those who are since published by the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Sectators, and these
are look'd upon as Human; any whereof, if they appear foolish, yet
<PB N="364" REF="202"/>
they doubt not but their Prophet uttered them, that he might bring
himself to the Capacities of his Hearers, and of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> to
whom he was sent to call them from Idolatry to the Worship of the
only One God; for which the <HI>Persians</HI> make this Answer, Should a
Doctor talk to a Rustick, and speak as if he were discoursing with
a Professor, and not conform himself to the apprehension of the
Countryman, How should he be understood? Which course, say
they, <HI>Mahomet</HI> took for the better Information of his Proselytes.</P>
<P>Who leaving Natural Causes, declares these Secrets were Revealed
to him: That</P>
<P>The Winds were raised by an Angel's moving his Wings.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Re∣velations.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Flux and Reflux of the Sea was caused by an Angel's putting
his Foot on the middle of the Ocean, and compressing the Waves,
the Waters ran to the Shores, which being removed, they retired
to their proper station.</P>
<P>Falling Stars are the Firebrands wherewith the Good Angels
drive away the Bad when they are too sawcily inquisitive, and ap∣proach
too near the Empyreum (the Virge of the Heavens) to
hearken to, and eves-drop the Secrets there.</P>
<P>Thunder is nothing else but the Cracking of an Angel's Whip,
while he slashes the dull Clouds to such and such a place, where Rains
are wanting to make the Earth fertile and remedy its Driness.</P>
<P>Eclipses, he delivers, happen not by the mutual Interjection of
the Heavenly Bodies, but that the Sun and Moon are shut in a Pipe
(a Cupboard as well) and turned up and down, and that from
each Pipe is a Window by which they enlighten the World; but
when God is angry at the Inhabitants thereof for their Transgressi∣ons,
he bids an Angel clap to the Window, and turn the Lights
towards Heaven from the Earth; then the Light is taken away from
the unworthy Miscreants, and an Eclipse is made; for which occasi∣on
he has left them Forms of Prayers to be used by the <HI>Mahometans,</HI>
that God would be pleased to avert his Judgments and restore Light
to the World. In an Eclipse of the Moon they beat Pots and Pans,
or any other brazen Instrument, as in time of Idolatry it was a pre∣vailing
Custom, even in <HI>Europe</HI> (as well as here and in <HI>India</HI>)
which still some ignorant Old Women, and the dregs of the People
are ready enough to continue; for the Tradition was handed
down to them, wherewith they were seduced of Yore, that the
Moon might be Inchanted, and unless it were roused up by this
Noise would certainly fall down dead asleep upon the Earth from
Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Juvenal</HI> in his Satyrs Comments pleasantly enough on the Garrulity
of the Female Sex, by this Invective on one of them:

<L>Recover its Lethargick Swoon.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the incomparably witty <HI>Persians</HI> have an evasion for this,
<PB N="365" REF="202"/>
telling this Tale; Their Learned Doctor <HI>Nessir</HI> (on whose Words
they'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Swear) had Predicted to the Reigning King an Eclipse of
the Moon, but fearing lest the drowsy King should be asleep, and so
he should lose the fruit of his Prediction, persuaded the Vulgar,
that to drive away the ill Influences the Eclipse Presaged, they
would smite with all their force on such Instruments; whereby the
King being perfectly awaked, he lift up both his Hands and his Eyes
in Astonishment, and admired the Skill of his Astrologer, for which
he was well Rewarded. But this is but a Story, however positive
they are, since it was a Custom all the World over long before.</P>
<P>Their Thick-scull'd Prophet has set another Angel at work for
Earthquakes, who is to hold so many Ropes tied to every Quarter of
the Globe; and at God's Command, he is to pull and so shakes that
part of the Globe; and if a City, Mountain, or Tower, be to be
overturned, then he tuggs harder at the Pulley, till the Rivers dance
and the Valleys are filled with Rubbish, and the Water swallowed
up in the Precipices. Such Stuff as this he has abundance of; and
the most impartial Interpreter of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> as the <HI>Mahometans</HI>
themselves confess, can afford no better: But for all that they hold
that it contains profound meanings; for it has several degrees of
Senses, the second of which it is hardly possible for the greatest
Doctor to apprehend; wherein are couched Words of such efficacy,
which if they were pronounced by Unpolluted Lips, and whoever
should understand them and Pray, might both Raise the Dead and
work Miracles; and that of an unquestioned truth this Book came
from God, as both the Foecundity of Stile, and admirable Eloquence
doth testify. For they are not afraid prophanely to say, That God
accommodated his Missions to Place, Age, and the exigency of
Times; in the Days of Christ there were excellent Physicians,
<HI>Irlenus,</HI> i. e. <HI>Galen, Pichagor, Pockate, Afflaton,</HI> (prodigious Re∣concilers
of Time!) all these Healed Diseases by their Plants and
Herbs; but God to outdo these, gave Christ Power to Raise those
from the Dead who had been Buried; acknowledging withal, that
this Prophet exceeded the degree of meer Man.</P>
<P>When <HI>Moses</HI> lived, many Magicians and Cunning Men were
entertained by <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> God therefore gave <HI>Moses</HI> a more wonder∣ful
Art, that his Serpent should devour theirs, whereby they were
compelled to own him sent from God.</P>
<P>And now to nick <HI>Mahomet,</HI> when he had the Impudence to set
up for a Prophet, Oratory was in its full perfection; wherefore <HI>Ma∣homet,</HI>
by the Ministration of the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> brought forth the
Chapters of his <HI>Alcoran;</HI> which when he had proposed to the Wisest
Men of that Age to pronounce but Three or Four thereof, and
they not being able, were forced to confess, that That Work must
be certainly of God, since they knew <HI>Mahomet</HI> to be Illiterate;
which he relates in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and takes thence an opportunity to
boast, undervaluing the <HI>Psalms</HI> of <HI>David</HI> in the mean while (which
are <HI>David</HI>'s <HI>Psalms</HI>) because they know not with what Figures of
Words and Sentences they are Illuminated, nor with what vehe∣mency
they incite a Devout Soul; that the <HI>Persian</HI> Interpreter,
could he express the Numbers and Elegancies of Speech contained
<PB N="366" REF="203"/>
in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> would leave off to admire the Nonsense of the
<HI>Alcoran,</HI> and look upon the mistake with detestation: Nor would
they dare to call their Impostor, as they do, the <HI>continual flowing
Miracle of Rhetorick,</HI> but rather a meer <HI>Stammering Fool,</HI> and his
Bastard-brood the <HI>Alcoran, Sottishness.</HI></P>
<P>The Antiquaries among the Christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assisted by <HI>Sergius</HI> the Monk.</NOTE> who have searched more
narrowly into this upstart Religion-Monger, have scented who was
his real Instructor, though he belied the Archangel <HI>Gabriel;</HI> for
this Hodge podge was forged between him and one <HI>Sergius</HI> a Monk,
who fled to him in <HI>Arabia,</HI> when the <HI>Nestorian</HI> Heresy, which he
professed, was Condemned in <HI>Syria; Mahomet</HI> received him,
being now risen to Power from a poor Lad, of the Father's side a
<HI>Pagan,</HI> by the Mother a <HI>Jew;</HI> by their joint perverting the Holy
Bible, sprang up this Motly of Blasphemous Dotages; in which that
he made use of <HI>Sergius</HI> as his Tutor, may be discovered by some
Footsteps still appearing out of the very <HI>Alcoran;</HI> for in the Chapter
entitled <HI>Nahil,</HI> thus it is rendred word for word; <HI>The People accuse
thee, that whatever thou pretendest to utter as from God, thou art taught
all this by thy Companion.</HI></P>
<P>But the whole matter is related by <HI>Pomponius Loet.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Blasphe∣mous Opini∣ons.</NOTE> and <HI>Igna∣tius;</HI>
thus <HI>Sergius</HI> the Master of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> was, as many believe,
the Author of the <HI>Monothelites</HI> also: He cherished the wicked Heresy
of <HI>Arius</HI> and <HI>Nestorius;</HI> therefore being Excommunicate, by the
Orthodox, he was sent a Vagabond into Banishment, and at length he
came into <HI>Arabia,</HI> where the false Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> obliged him by his
Friendship, and by him learn'd to corrupt the Holy Scriptures, so as
to frame a New Religion, which was neither Christian, nor altoge∣ther
Jewish, but a Composition of both, obliterating what was not
to their purpose; whereupon the <HI>Hagareens</HI> and <HI>Saracens,</HI> held <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>
not only as their King, but also as a Prophet Divinely Inspi∣red,
and follow him in all his Absurdities.</P>
<P>He denied the Trinity, affirming it to be ridiculous to believe
Christ to be God; wherefore with <HI>Socinus</HI> and <HI>Eumenius,</HI> he allowed
him to be only a Creature, but with <HI>Carpocrates,</HI> an Holy Prophet.
He held with <HI>Cedren,</HI> that it was a thing impossible that God should
Beget a Son who never had a Wife.</P>
<P>With the <HI>Manachites</HI> he would not have Christ Crucified, but ano∣ther
so like him that he could not be distinguished.</P>
<P>With the Disciples of <HI>Origen,</HI> he held that after a Revolution of
time the Devils might be Sav'd; ascribing with the <HI>Anthropomorphites,</HI>
Members and Human Shape to the Deity; placing, with <HI>Cerinthus,</HI>
all Felicity in Pleasure.</P>
<P>He has Commanded Circumcision, with <HI>Elion,</HI> though with <HI>Eu∣crates,</HI>
he has forbidden Wine to his Disciples; he Damns those to
Hell that speak against the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> asserting it to be given by
Inspiration.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> is his Sabbath;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Friday</HI> his Sabbath</NOTE> and two Fasts are by his appointment,

with what Women they please; although to Eat Swines Flesh be a
<PB N="367" REF="203"/>
Crime unpardonable; attributing to Beasts, as well as Men, a capa∣bility
of a Resurrection.</P>
<P>The Holy Baptism he explodes as insignificant, preferring thereto
his Superstitious Washing before Prayers, and at Exonerating the
Body; he lets them not Cut the Foreskin before the Eighth Year;
he esteems the Eucharist given in Commemoration of Christ, as fri∣volous,
because he confesses not that he suffered Death; but that the
Eucharist was instituted of God for the benefit of worthy Receivers,
and for the destruction of such as should not receive it worthily.</P>

strictness of Manners, and eminent Knowledge for a Director and
Guide to the People, that all Affairs and Strifes concerning Con∣science
may be determined by him; but what is more, all Prefer∣ments
relating to the Church are at his Disposal. Where this Car∣cass
is, there the Eagles will be gathered; for to this High-Priest is
not lacking wherewith to maintain his Inferior Brethren, would he
spare something from his own Hoards; but he is a-kin to that sort of
Animal which the more it hath, the more it craveth; nor is any
thing more griping than he.</P>

presumes on that Office, he becomes the greatest Grievance thereof;
whereby it is plain he is an Amphibious Creature, only affording the
Priests an half Patronage, from whom he receives his Dignity; but
the Lawyers give him Power and Wealth; so that though he delight
to be called Primate of the <HI>Mullahs,</HI> yet he covets more the Rule of
the <HI>Cadies</HI> or <HI>Cazies,</HI> from whom there is no Appeal.</P>
<P>For as in <HI>Nuncupatives</HI> the irrevocable Decrees and Commands of
the Emperor stand firm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Autho∣rity.</NOTE> so his Determinations in the Written Law
are as Authentick; so that where he has Wit to keep his Canons
from interfering with the King's Prerogative, he acts as he pleases:
They were formerly so resolute to interpose where they found their
Sovereigns about to do a rash Mischief; but that Permission is laid
aside, and he sings that Lesson to King <HI>Solomon,</HI> as to one that is deaf,
he being impatient of any Reproof; not being willing to be drawn
off from his Cups and his Gormandizing, nor at leisure to be present
even at their Sacred Rites, having not saluted the Temple Twelve
times since he began to Reign, which is Eleven Years; which his
Forefathers were wont to do once a Week with great Pomp and
State.</P>
<P>Godliness is not only the chief, but the Foundation of all other
Virtues; for therein is a great Tye upon Men to keep them in their

<P>The greatest Burthen here too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fune∣rals more Pompous than the <HI>Turk∣ish</HI> Sects are.</NOTE> is to perform the Funeral Obse∣quies,

and carried by Four Bearers, it lying on the Herse arrayed in

she is put into a Coffin, or Chest, and an <HI>Awning</HI> made over the Herse,
covered with a White Sheet instead of a Pall; after these come the

Sponded for them; and this is a Task impos'd mostly on their new
Proselytes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cadies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">No Garb to distinguish their Clerks.</NOTE> or Justices, can both Marry and Unmarry: Which
Lay-Clergy, with the whole Bookish Tribe, is hard to be known
from the Gross of their Nation, by Strangers; unless some affect
White Vestments in token of Purity, and walk with Eyes fixed on
the Ground, a Rosary in their Hands, an outward Appearance of
Demureness and Sanctity, and a Neglect of the World; a Book of
<HI>Hadis</HI> in their Breast; and if any seem to mind them, they tune
their Pipes to the Uncertainty of Riches; the Frailty of Human
Nature; that all things are vain and fleeting; that our Minds ought
to be fix'd on our End; with all the Train of Hypocrisy well per∣sonated.</P>

as if they had been defiled with some unclean thing, a Dog or Hog;
undervaluing all but their own Sect, as if there were no Holier

<P>And now having dispatch'd this Crew, moulded up in dull Clay,

<P>And first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poets.</NOTE> They have some (though few) set up for Admirers of
the Muses, and value themselves in being call'd the Wits of the
Age, and these are their Poets; who confine themselves to Rhime
and Numbers, and sometimes to Quantity, inferring their Verses
with Comparisons, Exaggerations, Flights of Ingenuity, and Ficti∣ons,
which they repeat with Gestures both of Hands, and Body,
and Mouth contorted, animating them with suitable Tones and Arti∣culations,
proclaiming them dead without such Information.</P>
<P>They have Romances of Famous Heroes and their Deeds; among
which are pleasant Rancounters, Huntings, Love-Intrigues, Ban∣quetings,
descriptions of Flowers and delightful Groves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limners.</NOTE> emphatical∣ly
set down, with Cuts and Pictures represented lively enough,

<P>The exactest History they have to brag on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Historians.</NOTE> is <HI>Rouze el Saphet,</HI> a Book
of Three or Four Volumes, in <HI>Folio;</HI> which gives an account from
the first Habitation of Men upon Earth, till the Two last Centuries.
They are but bad at Chronology, making nothing of a Thousand
Years confounded together: Had they the Aera of <HI>Augustus,</HI> or the
<HI>Julian</HI> Period, or a faithful State of Time, there might be some

likelihood of Truth in their Histories; but they being Convicted
of inadvertency in these Points, the whole Superstructure must
fall; which to defend even in their very <HI>Alcoran,</HI> they are forced
to Forge Aspersions to confront the lameness of its Stories, whereby
they endeavour thus to come off: A Wicked Emperor having ob∣tained
the Rule of the World, got the Sacred Writs together by
force, and burnt them; after which, what occurred to the Memory
of the Christians, were committed to Paper just as every one could
recollect or fancy; and hence arose the several Mistakes and Diffe∣rences.</P>
<P>Others pretending to a farther reach, follow our Saviour to the
Fourth Heaven, where they affirm he now is, whither he carried
the Gospel with him from the unworthy Nations, excited by the
same Zeal <HI>Moses</HI> was, when he brake the Two Tables of the Deca∣logue.
With such Artifices as these they studiously bespatter the
Christians and their Religion, to uphold their own Dogmatical
Tenents.</P>

sleeping while he was reading this Piece, that fell down from the
Upper-Room to the Ground, whereby he brake his Skull, and his

Gold; a sottish and imprudent thirst of Wealth, as if it were in the

a scandal on the Noble Profession of Chymistry, to which is owing
the true Knowledge of Physick, by an Analytical Separation of the

whereout may be sucked such Particles, as are applicable for the
Remedies of Human Infirmities, while they depart not from the

Latitudes, and Aspects of the Stars, the Eclipses sometimes
agreeing, sometimes disagreeing with ours. In this Book are the
suspicions of War, scarcity of Corn, and other Incidents not dis∣cernible
in Human Learning; but so adapted, that like the sound of
Bells to the Fancies of some, so these admit of an interpretation
agreeable to every one's sense, that the Prognosticator may not be
reproved of unskilfulness. Such an itch of knowing Contingencies
reigns here, that no Journey is undertaken, no New Book read, no
Change of Garments put on, no fresh Dwelling entred upon before
the Stars are consulted; here is controverted when is the good,

Hands lift up to Heaven; then casting the Dye, he observes the
Points, and aenigmatically canvesses the Event; sometimes hitting
the Case, and sometimes as wide from it as the East is from the West;
and though by Experience they have found them tripping an Hun∣dred
times, and upbraid them for the Cheat; they put it off as if
they had not stated the thing fairly; that a Minute in the Calcula∣tion
varies the truth; that this is the true profession <HI>Daniel</HI> trans∣mitted
to Posterity; and if it answer not the Question, it is not be∣cause
the Art is defective, but because few are so happy as to attain
its perfection; and thus do they willingly continue in their belief
of the Gull: They encourage an infinite number of these South∣sayers,
as many as can invent new Tricks to get Money by it.</P>
<P>When they consult for future success in Matters of great conse∣quence,
they go to some Learned Doctor, who Divines by the <HI>Al∣coran;</HI>

dictates the good hour or bad hour, when to rise, when to go to

the Sand; whose Advice is always followed, though some Stories
are upon Record to their disadvantage: Two whereof I shall re∣late.</P>
<P>About Eighteen Years ago, it being famous, and no longer since,
remains fresh in memory, and is made use of to make sport with the
Astrologers: The <HI>Cossaks</HI> on the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> came thence over the
<HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and made a Descent into <HI>Persia,</HI> and carried off a great
Booty, loading their small Ships without any opposition: The
Emperor of <HI>Persia</HI> incensed with this Affront, and Depredation made
on his Subjects, arms such a Fleet as he thought sufficient to correct
their Insolence with his Soldiers, and bad them take the Sea at the
precise time the Astrologers should direct, that the Heavens also
conspiring, they should effectually chastise their Enemies; which
being without doubt carefully studied, should as infallibly come to
pass to that upon their invading them, not one of them should escape:
And for the better obtaining their end, advised'em to fasten their Ships
together by strong Chains, that so they should keep their Body intire,
lest the <HI>Cossacks</HI> should set upon any single Vessel, and at the same
time should enclose the Pirates so, that they should by no means
get out of their hands: But the cunning <HI>Cossacks</HI> being used to Stra∣tagems,
foreseeing their Design, fell upon the first Ship with their
Guns, which so bored her Sides, that she sunk, and by her weight
occasioned the rest to sink one after another, so that 500 Men, and
Twelve Ships were sent to the bottom in a well-chosen hour, and
the <HI>Cossacks</HI> by this Exploit left Masters of the Sea, and the Borders
thereon liable to their continual Incursions.</P>
<P>Three Years after, one of the same Tribe contriving how to aug∣ment
his Pension, in a chosen time, presented a Petition to the Em∣peror,
when he happened to be out of humour; and therefore com∣manded
an exact Account to be given him of the expence he was at
in maintaining this Vermin; the return whereof amounting to 20000
<HI>Thomands</HI> Yearly, made him exceeding wroth, so that he not only
denied an addition of Salary, but had extirpated the Function had not
great intercession been made.</P>
<P><HI>Des Cartes,</HI> the Prince of Philosophy in this Age, gives his Sectators
caution <HI>nè nimis superbe de nobis ipsis sentiremus decreta Dei à nobis
intelligi supponamus;</HI> lest we should too vainly conceit the Decrees
of God to be understood by any of us; and these had done better
had they stuck to their primitive Astronomy.</P>

<P>Which thing is but slightly touched by them; but because they
do foretel some Revolutions of the heavenly Bodies, they are migh∣tily
admired by the Vulgar; and not only by them, but by those
<PB N="374" REF="207"/>
of better fashion also: Which here opens a Gap for all pretending
Knaves, who fatten themselves on the folly of this Licence, which
in all civil Governments is punished by the severest Laws; whose
execution are so far neglected in <HI>Persia,</HI> that even now in the King's
Court an old Hagg is respected; a relation of which, because it has as
much of rarity as truth, I shall not think tedious to insert.</P>
<P>A certain <HI>Turkish</HI> Woman, born at <HI>Constantinople</HI> (by these People
named <HI>Stambole,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Pythonissa,</HI> or Witch.</NOTE> and <HI>Romeree</HI>) now an old Witch, in her young
days provoked by the heat of her Lust, ran from her Husband
with her Paramour; with whom enjoying her beastly pleasure
for some time, at length she was carried into a Wood, where she
lived five years without remembring how she came there, or what
befel her in that space; but that time being spent, she perceived her
self possessed with the Devilish Spirit of Prophecy, and so returned
to the City from whence she had fled a Strumpet, a <HI>Pythonissa;</HI>
which being noised abroad, and coming to the Grand <HI>Seignior</HI>'s Ears,
he caused her to be banished as a Portentous Evil out of <HI>Constanti∣nople:</HI>
Who thence wandering here and there, found small encou∣ragement,
till she came to <HI>Suffahaun,</HI> where being arrived, and
the News brought to Court, without imprecation of the Gods to
avert the mischief, she is the daily diversion of the <HI>Persian</HI> Monarch,
and he delights to discourse her often.</P>
<P>She calls every one by their proper Name, though never seen
before: She gives an account of actions past, both ridiculous and se∣rious;
which though it be the Emperor's sport to hear, the Cour∣tiers
are shy of her Company, because of reaping up their old Sins;
and being proved in this point to answer expectation, it is granted
that she can Divine future Contingencies; toward which the Genius
of this Nation being disposed, she is esteemed not only by the King,
but by all People as a Prodigy.</P>
<P>When she is seized with a Fit of Prophecy, the first insult begins,
(where the Devil first entred,) at her Belly, which works strangely;
and at such times there may be heard as it were the noise of Three
or Four Kitlins, sucking and crying when she falls into an Extasy. Af∣ter
which, the Spirit seems to answer from the bottom of her Belly
to all questions propounded; and being in this transport, gives this
account of her self: <Q>I (says she) am a Daemon, whether of an
airy, fiery, or either substance compounded, I know not; nor of
what Principles I am made, either heavenly or human; but that
we are many and divided into Three Tribes or Orders; in eve∣ry
of which we have learned and wise, foolish and illiterate among
us; the same Religions and Opinions prevail as are upon Earth;
some professing Christianity, others Mahometism; and again others
are Pagans and Idolaters, and there are some few Atheists among
us: As for my share, I follow the <HI>Persian</HI> Sect of <HI>Mahometism,</HI> and
confess my self an Ideot, understanding no other Language than
<HI>Turkish</HI> (where under a Cloven Foot may be discerned conform∣ing
to a Foreign Religion,</Q> though skilled in no other Language but
her Native; a pretty Wheedle to insinuate into the <HI>Suffee</HI>'s favour)
<Q>if therefore any thing be asked beyond my reach, that needs an
Expositor, I betake my self to some OEdipus of our Order, who
<PB N="375" REF="207"/>
unfolds the Mystery to me, whose Sense I only render for satisfa∣ction
of my Inquirers.</Q></P>
<P>This being a new Doctrine to the <HI>Suffee,</HI> he commanded her to
give him some Demonstration of the truth of what she had told;
and therefore put her upon discovering how he might believe the
airy Region to be peopled after this rate; she consented to convince
him, and ordered all the Nobles attending the Emperor, to retire
with him into one part of the Room, and leave her to work their
Conviction, which she did after this manner:</P>
<P>Falling into her usual Trance, she at that instant wrought their
Fancies to be persuaded of the confused Articulation of Multitudes
met as in a Fair, conversing and making a chattering, to the amazing
of them all.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Raphiel</HI> the <HI>Capuchin,</HI> who gave me this account, was set
upon by the Emperor to encounter her; but he prudently enough
avoided it, lest he might be brought into some Praemunire about
Disputes of their Religion, in which he found the crafty Slut would
involve him; but besides his single Testimony of this Affair, here are
many <HI>Turkish</HI> Merchants in Town who all declare the same as to her
being possessed, having known her many Years ago at <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI>
from whence she was expelled by a special Precept of their
<HI>Sultan.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a large Field of Controversy offered, to wit the Possessi∣ons
of <HI>Cardan,</HI> and the <HI>Lapland</HI> Witches; but these being Foreign
to this intended Account, I purposely omit what might be said on
this Subject, referring it to more acurate Pens.</P>

though within doors they chuse the other, where the Stage players,

<P>At length I convert my self to that Noble and Excellent Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Medicks.</NOTE> so
beneficial to the Life of Man, Physick; which though it be here
in good Repute, yet its Sectators are too much wedded to Antiquity,

Prescripts, and sell them to his Patients, the half of which Gain
comes into his Pocket: Thus by degrees increasing in Fame, he co∣vets

In the matter of their Physick, Extracts, or Essences of Plants,
Roots, or Minerals, are beyond their Pharmacy; only they use
cooling Seeds, and Medicines of that nature; so that in repelling a
Fever, they make but one work of that and the Innate Heat, where
most an end both become extinguished at once; or at least, the Body
is left in that condition, that Obstructions or an Ill Habit succeeds;
although I am not ignorant, that sometimes after the greatest Care
in Chronical Distempers, such things will happen, according to the

this heterogeneous Broath, sometimes Three or Four Pints at a time;
so that if it fails moving the Belly by its excitative Faculty, yet by
its excessive Dose it makes way for Evacuation: And this they do re∣peat
most an end for a Fortnight or Three Weeks together; which
if it succeed not, another Physician is consulted; for among such
store they think it hard to miss of a Cure; and in that are so opiniona∣ted,
that if their own Nation cannot give them Remedy, they think
none other can. (Though as to Chyrurgery they are of another
mind, thinking the <HI>Europeans</HI> better at Manual Operation than them∣selves.)
But to proceed, being severely handled by one, they fly
to another; and he from extreme Cold things runs upon the other
extreme; so that between these two Rocks its no wonder the Pati∣ent
so often miscarries, and so many concurring Causes joined with
their Distemper, hurry them to another World.</P>
<P><HI>Rhabarb,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Purges approved.</NOTE> <HI>Turbith,</HI> and <HI>Scammony,</HI> are dreadful to them; but <HI>Sena,
Cassia, Manna,</HI> and <HI>Turpentine,</HI> are swallowed without any appre∣hension
of evil. Many of their Physicians insist on Diets unusual
elsewhere, as Goats-flesh, Horses, Asses, and Camels flesh; for which
reason they have distinct Shambles for the same purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Avicen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Authors in Esteem.</NOTE> <HI>Averroes,</HI> and <HI>Rhasis,</HI> are known Authors among them;

<P>Their Law forbids them to inspect a dead Carkass; they therefore
lean implicitly on what they find among Ancient Anatomists, and
yet think themselves at no loss in that Science; whence it is their
Practice is lame, and their Theory no more than the prating of a
Parrot.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="209"/>
Hence it follows they are imperfect in the Chyrurgeons Art;
they can tell how to protract slight Wounds into Length of Time,
but for things of real danger they are to seek which way to handle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unskilful in Chyrurgery.</NOTE>

<Q><L>The Knife is us'd to part the dead, and give</L>

<P>The Endemial Diseases of this Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Endemial Diseases.</NOTE> are Phrensies, Plurisies,
Peripneumonies, Empyemaes, Catarrhs, distempers of the Eyes;
Red Gum, which besets our Children in <HI>Europe,</HI> is pernicious to
Old Age here; St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Fire, or more properly the <HI>Persian</HI> Fire,
impressing on the adust Blood the nature of Atrabile: But the fa∣shionable
Malady of the Country is a Clap, scarce One in Ten being
free from it; which the unbounded Liberty of Women, Cheapness
of the Commodity, and the Encouragement of their filthy Law, are
main Incentives to. And to back this Lewdness, they bring the
Example of their Prophet <HI>Haly,</HI> who lying down without a Female
Companion, is reported to be Author of this doughty Dialogue be∣tween
the Earth and him, wherein the Earth upbraided him by say∣ing,
<Q>Whilst you lye on the Ground an unfruitful Log, a burthen to
my sides, I sweat and labour in producing Vegetables, Minerals,
and Animals for your use; Why then do you not busy your self in
getting Children,</Q> to transmit your Offspring to Posterity?
Which pleasing Reproof of the Venerable Prophet's recommending
to his easy Disciples, they embrace with both Arms, while the Poy∣son
creeps into the Marrow of their Bones, so that they are not
come to Maturity, before they are rotten; though by reason of the
Pureness of the Air, it seldom or never arrives to that height of
Cruelty as in <HI>Europe;</HI> inasmuch as when any are so dealt by it, they
reproach it with the <HI>Frank</HI> Disease, <HI>Atecheque Fringi,</HI> when it breaks
out into Sores and Ulcers, after it has seized the whole Mass of
Blood, and eats them up alive; while they wear theirs dormant al∣most
to extreme Old Age, which makes them not much solicitous
for Remedy, nor are there any who profess its Cure.</P>
<P>There is another Infirmity as general almost, proceeding from
their Ceremonial Washing, when they exonerate, too frequent using
of Baths, which causes a Relaxation of the Muscles of the <HI>Anus,</HI>
whereby the great Gut of the Fundament falls down: Most of them
by a Fulness of Body are subject to the <HI>Hemorrhoids;</HI> but what
chiefly vexes them, walking or riding, (putting them into misera∣ble
Pain, and contorted Postures of the Back, and whole Trunk of
the Body), is a <HI>Fistula in Ano,</HI> which they contract from their
Athletick Temper, and constant being on Horseback; as has been
observed not only by <HI>Sennertus,</HI> but <HI>Platerus, Fernelius,</HI> and others:
Nor does it seldom fall out, from their aptness to Venery, and prone∣ness
to make use of Boys, that they are afflicted with terrible <HI>Ma∣riscae,</HI>
<PB N="379" REF="209"/>
or swoln Piles of several forms, by them called <HI>Obne;</HI> where∣in
Worms, as they perswade themselves, are bred, that excruciate
them with such an Itch as they cannot lay, without adding Sin to
Sin, and therein they report their Cure to be compleated; and this
brings on them a white Leprosy, not incommoding the Body with
Illness, but disgracing it with Spots in the Face, Arms, Thighs,
Breast, and other parts about them. Children have frequently
Scald Heads, which makes them keep close shav'd.</P>
<P>The Plague has not been known among them this Eighty Years
and upwards, but the Spotted-Fever kills them presently, yet is not
contagious: The <HI>Bezoar</HI>-stone in this Case is highly approved.</P>
<P>The Gout afflicts few here, the Pox commonly securing them from
it; however as painful as that proves to their Bones, or rather Mem∣branes
surrounding them, they applaud all Provocatives in Physick,
and will purchase them at any Rates; which are sometimes so strong,
that they create a continued Priapism to these Goats and Satyrs, and
by their Bows being always bent, are brought to an Inability of re∣ducing
them.</P>
<P>To divert their Care and Labours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Large quanti∣ties of <HI>Opium</HI> eaten at a time.</NOTE> they are great Devourers
of <HI>Opium,</HI> and <HI>Koquenar</HI> (which is Poppy-heads boil'd), which
they quaff when they have a mind to be merry; for which
reason, as Hemp is sown among our Fens and Fields, so they
sow Poppies, and when ripe, make Incision for the Juice, which ga∣thering,
they inspissate and eat; to do which, those unaccustomed
adventuring unadvisedly upon too large a Dose, instead of the ex∣pected
effect of cheering the Spirits, chain up the Vitals so that they
are never loosed more, for they never awake from the Lethargy it
intrances them in: So that they begin gradually, and then arrive
to great Quantities; as from a Grain to half an Ounce, without any
Harm, besides a frolicksome sort of Drunkenness; by means where∣of,
without any other Sustenance, they are qualified to undergo
great Travels and Hardships: But having once begun, they must
continue it, or else they dye; whereby it becomes so necessary, that
if they mis-time themselves, as in their <HI>Ramzan,</HI> or on a Journey,
they often expire for want of it: Yet those that live at this rate
are always as lean as Skeletons, and seldom themselves; but such is
their love towards it, that they give themselves up to the study of
infatuating themselves by all the ways they can, never smoaking a
Pipe without the Leafs of the intoxicating <HI>Bang,</HI> and Flowers of the
same, mixed with their Tobacco; besides which, they contrive ma∣ny
more Medicines to put a Cheat upon the Pungency of their Cares,
and drive Sorrow from their Hearts; which indeed diverts them for
some few hours, till they return with a more fixed Melancholy, bur∣thensome
to themselves and others: While the Operation of their
forced Mirth lasts, they are incapable at that time of any Business;
Whence they proverbially say, <HI>Belque Teriac ne resid,</HI> to any Trifler,
or Fiery Spirit; That the Force of your Treacle you have eaten,
still remains.</P>
<P>Moreover, they have other Treacles, such as are taken notice to
be sold in the Markets, by <HI>Apulcies,</HI> and the <HI>Circe</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> prepa∣red
as Counter-Poysons, which are compounded of Garlick, Mother
<PB N="380" REF="210"/>
of Thyme, and other Herbs beaten together: That Rich one made
use of only by the Nobles, is adventitious, and is brought by their
Merchants from <HI>Venice,</HI> the Poor not being able to go to the Price
of such Medicines or Physicians as exceed the common Rates; and
therefore is it that their great Towns and Buzzars are full of Mounte∣banks,
Charmers, and <HI>Quacksalvers,</HI> to gull them of their Cash.</P>
<P>After these Sons of Fate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Lawyers.</NOTE> follow the Lawyers, who hold the
Chief <HI>Cazy</HI> or <HI>Codre</HI> for their Oracle, which is here usurped by the
<HI>Mufti,</HI> who substitutes others under him; who though the Course of
Law meet mostly with quicker dispatch here than in <HI>Europe,</HI> yet
they know well enough how to retard a gainful Cause; which is
consentaneous enough to the Comedian,
<Q><L>—O Lernaeam vere sobolem</L>
<L>Pragmaticorum, qui lites ex litibus serunt</L>

<P>Here are no Inns of Courts, or Courts of Chancery; no Moot∣ings,

or a select, Learned, and upright Bench, which justly concert the
Right of the Community; no distinct Courts, or subalternate Cham∣bers
to appeal to, which are illustrated with Venerable Knowledge
of Eloquence and Oratory, besides the Splendor of Nobility and
Majesty to adorn them: Here are no Counsellors, Advocates, or Se∣cretaries
distinguished by their Robes.</P>
<P>Here only a <HI>Mullah</HI> is chosen by the <HI>Codre</HI> or <HI>Mufti,</HI> to be <HI>Cadi</HI>
(corruptly called <HI>Kazy</HI>) or Judge, in his own House, at his own
time, and in no other Garment than usual, unless a Red Cap make
some Note of Dignity.</P>
<P>To him comes the injured Party to complain of his Adversary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cadi.</HI></NOTE>
and implores the <HI>Cadi</HI> to do him Justice: At the <HI>Cadi</HI>'s Elbow stand
several Officers ready to execute his Commands, to whom he pays no
Wages, but what they get by Catchpolling; to one of these he gives
his Mandates, saying, <HI>Fetch such an one hither;</HI> who, glad of the
Employment, seizes him by the <HI>Cadi</HI>'s Authority, and brings him
before him; nor shall he be let go, till he have discharged his Fees,
guilty or not guilty; so close do these Harpies hold their Prey, that
they never let go their Grasp, unless a Morsel be offered to their
Mouths, in lieu of their Purchase.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="210"/>
Sometimes when the <HI>Cadi</HI> sits, one of the Parties is present, and
the other absent; then a fresh Messenger is sent, and fresh Money
must be paid; at other times both Contenders are present, and the
<HI>Cadi</HI> sits not, and the Cause hangs in suspence while the Charges go
on: But after delays of this kind, suppose they at length meet, and
it prove matter of Debt contracted in the time of a former <HI>Cadi,</HI>
whose Writing is produced and attested, when the <HI>Cadi</HI> gravely re∣proves
the Debtor, Why dost thou not fear God and pay thy Debts?
He nothing concerned at the Admonition, replies, this Bond and
Hand-writing I know not, it may be Counterfeit, I never had any
thing to do with this man. Here Bonds unattested are of no force, by
reason of most impudent Cheats, but they must have not only One
or Two Witnesses, but Thirty or Forty, and so to Sixty, who must
be approved Men of Integrity, never accused to have told a Lie;
and even then they will oppose their Evidence, insinuating, That
for a small matter Knights of the Post may be Suborned, because
that Interest may sway a many to be against one, and that a plain
Truth may suffer through the conspiracy of a multitude: Moreover,
if they should be detected, they only undergo a Reprimand from the
<HI>Cadi,</HI> and no corporal Punishment, either of Death, or other
Chastisement; and should it be like to go hard with the Defendant,
or either Party, Plaintiff, or Defendant prove faulty, the conscious
Party seeks out some Familiar of the <HI>Cadi</HI>'s, employed on this ac∣count
to sollicit the <HI>Cadi</HI> in his behalf, and secretly he obliges him∣self,
either by Bond or Deed, to Bribe the <HI>Cadi</HI> to be his Friend,
and therefore, either a Pledg is deposited, or good Sureties brought
to satisfy the <HI>Cadi.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while both being driven away from the Judgment-Seat,
the <HI>Cadi</HI> with severe looks and angry words, threatens the
Delinquent to clear his Debt; when begging for readmittance, he
entertains the Creditor with a pleasing smile, and tells him, Justice
is from God; at the which he chears himself up with the hopes of
receiving his Money, and the corrupt Judge acts his Cue so well, that
few suspect otherwise; when the other Party, as if hard measure
were offered him, creeps with a dejected countenance to the feet of
the <HI>Cadi,</HI> calling him <HI>Mirza,</HI> (a Title for the most noble Courtier)
let me beg the favour of being heard but one word; the <HI>Cadi,</HI>
as if provoked to wroth, bids him speak; when he goes on, Your
Worship knows in this City there are such who on purpose are set
to practise Cheats, that will do it so exactly, that the most discern∣ing
Eye shall not discover the Fallacy, and that Money will pur∣chase
Witnesses, therefore let the Oath be put to me against my
Adversary, otherwise by these Tricks what Wealthy Man in <HI>Suffahaun</HI>
can escape Poverty?</P>
<P>This Gap being opened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Corrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judge.</NOTE> the <HI>Cadi</HI> with a milder countenance asks
him, if he dear swear this Debt to be unjust; then lays open to him
the horrid Sin of Perjury, how that Hell flames are prepared both by
God and their Prophet for breaches of Faith, and those that presume
on that manner can never escape Damnation; whereat shaking the
Borders of his Garments, as it were with pure hands brushing them,
he answers, I fear God, and from my Youth hitherto have never

omitted our prescribed Prayers, or the Fasts enjoined by our Law,
and for my Honesty none can reprove me; besides, I am an <HI>Hodgee,</HI>
and have the Honour conferred on me to be one of the Sons of the
Prophet, and can any of that Sacred Stock tell a Lie? Then the
<HI>Cadi</HI> calls for the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which being brought, he rises out of re∣verence
to the Divine <HI>Code,</HI> and Exhorts, Admonishes, and Preach∣es;
yet he fearless lays his Hand on the Book, and by Swearing
with a loud Voice that he owes him nothing, is dismissed from ever
being accountable more; for here are no other judiciary proceedings
or Tribunals to appeal to, where Mistakes may be rectified, or Inad∣vertency
by too precipitate a Sentence corrected.</P>
<P>Punishment in Criminal Causes are mightily biassed by Gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lex Talionis.</NOTE>
which at any time or place shall prevail more than Right; but if it

they are disabled to walk a long time after.</P>
<P>The Law of like for like, affords us this memorable passage of the
Emperor <HI>Severus,</HI> who made a bold Impostor in his Court undergo a
suitable Punishment for his Offence, who had deluded several of his
Courtiers with great Promises, and never had effected any; where∣fore
on their complaint, the Emperor commanded him to be stifled
with Smoak, and the Crier at the same instant to make proclamation,
<HI>qui fumum vendidit eodem paenas dat,</HI> Who Sold Smoak perishes
therewith. But this Law, though it seems the most equal among
many Nations, cannot square in all points without difficulty, there∣fore
it is the more prudently among us referred to the determinati∣ons
of the Judges in Life and Death; who are to give Sentence ac∣cording
to their discretion and the common usages in Capital Of∣fences.</P>
<P>Since Celibacy is exploded by their Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poligamy al∣lowed.</NOTE> simultaneous Poligamy

Lawful Wives in Matrimony at one and the same time, besides
Concubines, an indefinite Number, as every one's substance is able
to provide for with Serving-maids and Slaves; besides which they
may have for a determinate Price, such as they shall hire for an
Hour, Day, Month, or Year; and any Born in these Three Fami∣lies
of Bedfellows, may be reputed as Legitimate, provided the re∣puted
Father claim two parts, and the Woman one of the Child;
whereby however speciously they boast of the Clarity of their
Stock, it is apparent from what Puddle it is derived.</P>
<P>All Women here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They Buy their Wives.</NOTE> contrary to our Custom, are Bought with a

Wive's Virginity by strict Indentures before the <HI>Cadi.</HI></P>
<P>Divorces are common among the ordinary People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are often Di∣vorced▪</NOTE> though seldom
among the great ones, who count it a shame. A Bill of Divorce called
<PB N="383" REF="211"/>
<HI>Talak</HI> is taken out when there is either an aversion from the Bed, or
there are conceived home-bred troubles on account of the former
Obligation, or when they have engaged themselves to perform more
than they are able, then they make quarrels among the Wives, set∣ting
them together by the Ears, and the Man grows surly to the
new married Wife, not only giving her ill Language, but cruel
Blows more than she can bear; who presently runs to the <HI>Cadi</HI> for a
Divorce; but he willing to pacify them, returns her to her Husband
with Exhortation to live peaceably; whereupon the Siege is re∣newed,
and fresh Assaults are made by new Torments, till she have
remitted part of her Dowry, if not the whole.</P>
<P>Sometimes she retires to her Father's House, the Portion being
retained, whence arise new Jars. The Husband going to the <HI>Cadi</HI>
complains the Father keeps his Wife from him, and intreats his
Warrant to fetch her back; where being brought afore the <HI>Cadi,</HI>
and the Father with her to demand her Portion, she opens against
her Husband, and he against her, with that noise and thunder, that
often the <HI>Cadi</HI> being tired with their bellowing and roaring on all
sides, cries out, they kill me with their bawling; and though he com∣mand
silence, it is to no purpose, till being thoroughly vexed, he
cause the men to be <HI>Bastinadoed,</HI> who though they were deaf to
Words, must give ear to Blows, for they esteem it even indecent to
lay hand on a Woman, or to strike her before Folks.</P>
<P>If the Man propound the Divorce, and the Woman accept it, the
<HI>Cadi</HI> pronounces the decisive Sentence, because the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Law
observes to keep the right thereof in the power of the Man, not
the Woman: But if the perverse Woman insists in her resolution
of Divorce after the <HI>Cadi</HI> hath persuaded her to cohabit, and the
Man refuse to give it her, the <HI>Cadi</HI> declares them to be separated;
but the Woman in this condition cannot marry again, as being bound
to her Husband; wherefore the <HI>Cadi</HI> commands the Man to give
her Alimony, and maintain her at his own Charges while they re∣fuse
to live together; but if they can reconcile themselves, they
may come together without the <HI>Cadi</HI>'s revoking his Interdict for the
first and second time of Divorce; but after the third time they
cannot come together without abominable Sin; yet such is the
Heat of Lust in these Countries, that the Women cannot abstain
from the Man, no more than the Men from the Women; wherefore
if she takes another Husband, and some Months or Years living
with him, if she will, she may be Divorced from him, and return
to her first Husband.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Cadi</HI>'s Cognizance belongs all manner of Contracts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Contracts made before the <HI>Cadi.</HI></NOTE> Con∣veyances,
and Settlements; to which purpose near his Door are
such as make Instruments ready written for sale, in the Stile of

the Names of <HI>John-a-Nokes,</HI> and <HI>John-a-Stiles, Zeid,</HI> and
<HI>Ambre,</HI> the <HI>Cadi</HI> calls aloud, <HI>Zeid,</HI> where art thou? Who answers
here, upon appearance: When the <HI>Cadi</HI> proceeds; This House,
Garden, or Land, or any thing of that kind, Dost thou sell wil∣lingly,

for themselves; the <HI>Cadi</HI> asks them, Do you know this to belong
to <HI>Zeid?</HI> Who affirm, it is known to all the Town, even to the
Children.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cadi</HI> after these Interrogatories, lifts up his Voice, and says, Does
no one forbid this Contract? At which, they jointly cry aloud, no one
forbids: Whereupon the <HI>Cadi</HI> calls for his Seal, which are words
Engraven on Silver; and dipping it in Ink, stamps it three or four
times in three or four places, especially at the junctures of the In∣denture,
that no room may be left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or fraudulent dealing, they not
putting their own Hands, nor delivering it as their Act and Deed;
but the <HI>Cadi</HI> makes the Obligation firm on this wise.</P>
<P>Usury is forbid by <HI>Mahomet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Usury forbid by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> yet his Disci∣ples are cruel Extortioners.</NOTE> yet no place extorts more for Mo∣ney

in, or the Pledge become forfeited; and for the first Months In∣terest
he subducts aforehand, a <HI>Thomand,</HI> constraining the Borrower
to return the Ten intire, or else seize the Pawn; such intolerable
exactions befitting only <HI>Turk, Jew,</HI> and <HI>Indian Banyan,</HI> who reap
such unconscionable Gain by this Trade.</P>
<P>Those who desire to secure their Money thoroughly, come to
the <HI>Cadi</HI> for a Bond, being agreed first on their Contract among
themselves to pay Fifteen, Twenty, and sometimes Thirty <HI>Thomands</HI>
for the use of one Hundred for one year. When the Money is
brought in Two Bags, with a Knife, Book, or Mantle, and the
Owner <HI>Zeid</HI> cries out before the <HI>Cadi,</HI> sitting on the Seat of Ju∣stice:
<Q>I <HI>Zeid</HI> do give frankly for the space of one year One hun∣dred
<HI>Thomands;</HI> but I sell this Book for Fifteen, Twenty, or Thirty
<HI>Thomands</HI> to <HI>Ambre,</HI> and he is content to give it; therefore I de∣sire
in the presence of the <HI>Cadi,</HI> that <HI>Ambre</HI> may be obliged at
the years end to repay me my Hundred <HI>Thomands,</HI> according to
agreement,</Q> and then seizes the Fifteen, Twenty, or Thirty <HI>Tho∣mands,</HI>
according to agreement for the Book; or if he lets him
have the whole hundred, the <HI>Cadi</HI> asks <HI>Ambre,</HI> Art thou content to
give this Sum? And he answering, <HI>aree,</HI> yes, goes on, so thou art
Debtor to <HI>Zeid</HI> an Hundred and Fifteen, Twenty, or Thirty <HI>Tho∣mands,</HI>
payable this time Twelve Months, being fully expired; to
which he replying <HI>aree,</HI> it is <HI>valid</HI> in Law: In which Form of Wri∣ting
such caution is used, that they trust not Figures, nor bare
Words that express the Sum intire, and at length, but half it and
part it to prevent equivocation. For Example, the Sum of an Hun∣dred
Fifteen <HI>Thomands</HI> is the Principal, the half whereof is Fifty
seven, and an half; the Fifth part is Twenty three; deluding here∣by
the skill of the most subtle Sophister, since the Subsequents so
inexpugnably strengthen the Antecedents.</P>
<P>They have another way of borrowing Money upon an House,
which they pawn for a certain Sum for so many years, and Hire
their own House of the Creditor at his terms, till the Sum be
<PB N="385" REF="212"/>
payed; in which if there happen any lapse or failure, the House
becomes forfeit at the end of the time, and is seized for the use of
the Creditor, as well as if the Principal be not restored: And this is
held good in Law among them.</P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Cadi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</NOTE> they have another Splitter of Causes, called

let any one judge, where Bribery and Extortion get the
upper-hand: For where Nature has prescribed that Rule as a Fun∣damental
Maxim, That every man without respect to any ought to
Patronize the innocent, or help the injured, whereby we seek to
uphold the Community, and therein indeed preserve our selves,
how can this come to pass, unless it should be alike diffusive to all,
whereby every one of us become united in the same Law of Na∣ture?
which if Magistrates would consider, they would find the
Press of the Argument lie thus, To preside is to do right and pro∣fitable
things, agreeable to the Laws of self-preservation; for as
the Rulers are over the People, so the Laws ought to be above the
Rulers, I mean so far as to Govern by them, and act nothing con∣trary
to them: Nor can that Man be just or vertuous, who con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orms

than those whose Senses being depraved have not the true relish

full Tide of Glee, which is never to Ebb into dull Sadness, but con∣tinue
an uninterrupted course of self-complacency: These are the
Excellent Attainments of their Coelestial Happiness, and those that
think these Promises of no avail, their Prophet denounces Hell-fire
and Brimstone for their Unbelief.</P>

<P>For Man, to speak with the Philosopher, whether God or Nature

well be concluded with what the Author of <HI>Religio Medici</HI> writes
on this Subject: The <HI>Alcoran</HI> is a Book composed unadvisedly,
stuffed with idle and ridiculous Errors in Philosophy; sustained by
apparent Solicisms, Subterfuges of Ignorance, the decrying of Aca∣demies,
and the banishing of all manner of Learning, upheld
by Force more than Reason, the Fortune of their Arms be∣ing
their greatest Argument. To which <HI>Lypsius</HI> consents, <HI>O Nuga∣menta,</HI>
&amp;c. which made <HI>Avicenna,</HI> (of an extraordinary Happiness
of Wit, though unhappily born under the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Sect,
after he had seriously reflected on the Imposture,) blush to
think their Prophet had placed Eternal Felicity in a life of
Carnal Pleasures; insomuch that he was forced to confess he
could do no otherwise than abjure his Faith to become Master of his
Reason. <Q>For, says he, The Law <HI>Mahomet</HI> has delivered to us, has
limited both Beatitude and Misery under Corporal Terms; but the
Promises and Hopes of Eternity, must be of other Blessings more
refined sure and solid, which can no ways be conceived but by
an immaculate and rectified Intellect,</Q> and the highest pitch of In∣genuity.

<PB N="387" REF="213"/>
what our Divines have rightly determined, That Spiritual Bene∣dictions,
abstracted from Earthly (as too mean) are the chief Ob¦ject
of Happiness, whereby we are united to the first Truth: And
for no other end were we created by God, and a Soul stamped on
our Body, and on our Soul Intelligence or Understanding, says the
same <HI>Lypsius,</HI> but that we should live faithfully and godly on the
Earth, and thereby proceeding towards Heaven, we should, being
blessed together with him, reap Everlasting Felicity, which should
be so, because Spiritual, which is Eternal; not Carnal, which va∣nisheth
of its self, and passeth away, being but Temporary: And
then, if the Happiness expected hereafter by all wise men, is Spiri∣tual,
our present Worship here ought to be directed thither, of which

The adoring of the Gods ought to be the best Service we can
pay them, which must be most chast, and holy, and full of Piety,
that we may always reverence them with a pure, intire, uncorrupt
Mind and Voice. And <HI>Hermes,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>

What better Conduct, what holier Guide than the Captain of our
Salvation, the ever Blessed Jesus? who hath by his Apostle given us
the true Characteristick of the Right Religion, <HI>which is first pure,
then peaceable.</HI></P>
<P>Then what depravity of understanding hath corrupted the Minds
of these Sectators, that hath framed to themselves a nasty Stable,
more full of Filth than <HI>Augeus</HI> his, instead of that beautiful and un∣defiled
Structure of the Gospel; and for the most Holy and Pure
Doctrine taught by Christ, embrace with prostrate Body and bended
Knees, the Libidinous and Lascivious Worship of <HI>Mahomet?</HI> What
Stupidity, what Inchantment bewitches them to admit an Impostor
for a Prophet, a Deluder for a Saviour; for a <HI>Juno,</HI> as <HI>Ixion</HI> did, to

<P>Nor let Success animate them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Success no Argument</NOTE> since it is an Argument might serve
the <HI>Gentiles</HI> as well as them, whose numbers exceed all the Contro∣verted
Religions put together, whom St. <HI>Paul,</HI> their professed Emis∣sary,
brands with unadvised Piety, and lays them under equal Con∣demnation;
where he conjoins the Folly, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e.
<HI>What can be known of God, is manifested among them;</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>their foolish heart is darkened;</HI> which is the fault of the <HI>Mahometans</HI>
as well as them, because the pravity of their Understandings has cor∣rupted
their knowledge of God, the only True God, whereby they
should know his only Son Christ Jesus, and him crucified, to fulfil
both the Law and the Prophets. Thus from the previous Knowledge
or Idea of Religion, as it is either true or false, so it happens there
results a true Piety, Superstition or Idolatry, which would clearly
appear, were Reason Master of our Conceptions.</P>

<P>AND now being about to dismiss the Two Upper Forms from

the Gown-man priding himself in the courteous Name of <HI>Miirza;</HI>
who being thus Marshalled with Respect, and passed by with what Or∣der
they are allowed,</P>
<P>The Crowding Multitude press for Admittance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mer∣chant.</NOTE> scarcely affording
Priority to the Wealthy Merchant; the most Honourable of whom
are the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and therefore styled <HI>Cogee,</HI> or Rich, by the <HI>Per∣sians;</HI>
though even among the <HI>Persians</HI> many covet to be so reputed,
but care not to measure the wide World, like them, venturing no far∣ther

<Q><L>By Sea and Land does search for Store,</L>

The <HI>Moors</HI> are by Nature, heavy, dull and lazy; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd were they not
stimulated by Necessity, would not trot from their own Homes; for
they are content with the Rags of Poverty, rather than to put their
Hands to labour; and when they do exert their Faculties, they rather
study to impose by Fraud, than by Industry and honest Gain to re∣pair
their Fortunes.</P>
<P>Underpullers to these are the Shopkeepers, whose Mercurial Parts
are fitted to put off the worst Wares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cheats in all Professions</NOTE> by making appearance of the
best, either by false Lights, or crafty obtruding the Choisest to the
view on their Stalls, and foisting Goods disagreable to the Patterns

<P>Nor are the Handicraft free from Sophistry, having tasted the
same <HI>Philtre;</HI> the Cook, a Cheating Knave, will sell Asses, Camels,
or Horse Flesh, instead of Ox's; and that often fetched out of the
High-ways, being killed with Labour, or dead of Diseases, while the
Unwary Buyer pays for wholsome Food.</P>
<P>The Baker mixes with his Meal some Chalky Earth, which the
Imprudent suppose to be good Wheat; though these when detected
(as intimated already) suffer severely for it.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="214"/>
The Artizans also conspire in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. XIV.</NOTE> that Strangers are to be cozen∣ed;
from whence results the necessity of employing Broakers or
<HI>Banyans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Make the Broakers ne∣cessary.</NOTE> that the <HI>Cretes</HI> may deal with the <HI>Cretes;</HI> or as our <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Proverb hath it, <HI>Always set a Knave to catch a Knave.</HI></P>
<P>For all these Miscarriages, not the Government so much, as the
Administrators of Justice, are to be blamed: For the Laws are sound
enough, were not the Magistrates faulty in the Execution; and the
Reason is plain, their Offices being purchased at high Rates, indirect
Courses must be taken to repay themselves: Wherefore there is
hardly any Villany unconnived at, if they bribe but honestly, and
have the wit not to be open in their Cheats; so that those, whose
duty it is to preserve the Commonweal, are so far from being intent
thereon, that on the contrary, their main scope is directed how to
vex and oppress the Innocent; whereby, instead of being Dispensers
of Equity and Right to the Citizens, they are the only Plague and
Grievance they lie under: For their Gain arises mostly from the Ills
they contrive for those under their malevolent Authority, as may ap∣pear
by the subsequent, much to be lamented Story.</P>
<P>A certain <HI>Droger</HI> or <HI>Calenture</HI> of a City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Villany of a <HI>Droger.</HI></NOTE> being introduced by the
power of Gold, that he might the better make himself whole, began to
ruminate within himself (nor is the Devil wanting to such Servants;)
wherefore, besides the usual Exactions, to wit, to load the Rich
with Injuries, Tributes, Prison, Stripes and Shackles; whereas he
could not bring that to account to all, he devised a more sure and
available Stratagem; he enters a League and Amity with all the Men
of Note, treats them civilly abroad, and invites them friendly at
home, but not without design; entertaining at the same time corre∣spondence
with all the Pimps, Panders and Bawds of the Town, and
charges the latter to mix with all the lawful Wives in the publick
Baths (since only Men of the highest Rank have them in their
Houses) and to observe their Manners, Gestures, Garments, Shoes,
and their very Smocks, and give him an account; nor dare they be
deficient in their part: At the next Assembly, where every one strives
to the utmost of his Gravity to behave himself, he puts on a sober
Vizor, looks concerned, and out of order; after many Expressions
of sincerity, and a deep sense of Honour, he bursts out into heavy sighs,
at which the Good Man, to whom he directs his Discourse, afflicted
to see him in these Dumps, must to his own ruin ask the occasion of
his sudden alteration: He craftily returns, The business is no other∣wise
mine, than as it relates to my Friend, whose Credit is dearer to
me than mine own, nor can I endure to see him abused; then the de∣ceived
<HI>Coxe</HI> grows more instant, begging that he would not conceal
it from him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Droger</HI> being Master of his Science, persists; What comfort can
I reap from your disturbance? It were better I should be silent; yet—
whereat the other inflamed, thinking the Miscarriage aimed at him,
greedily swallows the Bait; and whilst he endeavours to clear the
doubt, is much more intricated than before, and therefore leaves
not off till he have wrought him to discover the dangerous Secret;
the <HI>Droger</HI> with much ado suffers himself to be overcome, and then
<PB N="390" REF="215"/>
he declares, to his great grief, he took his Wife in Adultery with a
Scoundrel, on whom, according to the Law, he inflicted sudden
Death, as he deserved; but for the Respect born to him, he permitted
his Lady to escape; nor had he made more words of it, had not he
extorted this Confession; nor should he have known it, even at this
time, had he not feared some less affected to him might have re∣proached
him openly, with what he now privately advised him only
of, otherwise it should have been buried in silence for all him.</P>
<P>The Husband astonished, by degrees hardly recovers himself, but
speaking incoherently as his Temper provokes him; sometimes
breaks forth in a passion and hurries to the destruction of his Wife
and Children, sacrificing all to his Fury, cutting off both Root and
Branch by a desperate depriving them of their Lives; than which
the <HI>Droger</HI> desires not a greater benefit, seising both him and his
Goods for satisfaction of the Law: But if he begins to consider, and
cooly to examin how can this be? Such a night I am sure she lay
with me, or was so and so employed at such a time in her own
House.</P>
<P>The <HI>Droger</HI> in nothing abashed, goes on, Has not your Wife such
a sort of Smock? Such a Pair of Breeches? Such a Vest? And then
particularizes her Habit; which things are too well known by him
to be denied, and so is possessed with a belief of the Levity of his
Wife, and the Kindness of the <HI>Droger</HI> not to publish his Shame;
which compells him to gratify the Favour by good Sums of Mo∣ney,
and either Repudiate, Beat, or Kill his Innocent Wife for the
malicious and wicked Invention of an unjust Magistrate.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have taken notice of little change in Apparel to
distinguish them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persian</HI> in his City Dress.</NOTE> the <HI>Patricii,</HI> or Nobles, being of the same make
with the meaner Multitude, only their every-day Cloaths surpass in
Richness, being <HI>Surbaffs,</HI> or Cloath of Silver or Gold, and the
middle Sort only appear so on great days, otherwise they are Habit∣ed
alike, unless Business, or Necessity of the Weather create a dif∣ference;
they Ride shorter, and are booted over their Stockins, with
a kind of Buskin with flat Heels, only shod with an Iron Horse shoe;
in the Winter they wrap themselves in Furs, and in the Summer∣time
go in looser as well as lighter Garments: Most an end their
Stockins and upper Jerkins are made of <HI>English</HI> Broad Cloth; within
doors they are clad more carelesly, as also when they are on Foot
near their own Homes.</P>
<P>But the set Dress of the <HI>Persian</HI> is after this manner; His Head be∣ing
Shaved, a large Turbat is placed upon his Crown, of divers Co∣lours,
either Silk or Cotton, in the Figure of an over-grown Cabage,
with a great broad Leaf a top, which is wrought of Gold or Silver,
and spread to make a shew; his Beard is Cut neatly, and the
Whiskers kept in Cases, and encouraged from one Ear to the other,
in fashion of an Half-Moon on the upper Lip, with only a decent
Peak on the under; not so mossy or slovenly, as either <HI>Turkish</HI> or <HI>In∣dian
Mahometans:</HI> Next, upon his Body is a Shirt, which he covers
with a Vest, tied double on his Breast, and strait to his Body as far as
the Waste, from whence it hangs in Pleats to his Ancles, sometimes
Quilted, sometimes not; his Loins are Girt with <HI>Phrigian</HI> Girdles
<PB N="391" REF="215"/>
or rich Sashes, above which his Belt carries a Falched Sword or
Scimiter; from his Hips long close Breeches of Linnen, come down
to his Hose, of <HI>London</HI> Sackcloth of any Colour, which are cut
loose, not respecting the shape of the Leg; over all a loose Coat of
the same, without Sleeves, Lined with Furs, or Sables, or else Silk;
the outside either Scarlet, or the finest Wool of <HI>Europe,</HI> or Cloath
of Silver or Gold of their own Manufactory; his Shoes of the best
Shagreen Leather, mostly Green, with narrow Toes, high narrow
Heels, shod with neat Iron Half-moons, without Shoe-ties or Quar∣ters
to pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l up about their Heels, being the readier to slip off and on
as occasion requires; instead of Gloves they Tincture not only their
Hands, but Feet, with a dark Red Colour, which they do with the
<HI>Alkana,</HI> or <HI>Hen</HI> of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> small Twigs of which Plant <HI>Lobeli∣us</HI>
writes, are brought out of <HI>Africa</HI> to be Sold, wherewith they
Dye their Hair Yellow, or of a sandy Red; and not only the <HI>Turks,</HI>
who are delighted with that Colour, stain their Hair, but their
Hands and Feet, with the Nails on each, and other parts of the
Body, to restrain Sweating and filthy Smells proceeding therefrom,
<HI>Plat. p. 165. de Discoloratione.</HI> Both which are mistakes, in relation
to the staining of the Hair, but as to the other part it is true.</P>
<P>They only use a Glove when they carry their Hawks on their
Fists, with which they are as often seen to carry them on Foot, as
on Horseback. And thus have we Robed the Sparkish <HI>Persian</HI> in his
City Dress; and now we shall attend the Ruder and less carefully At∣tired
Rustick about his Country Affairs; which we shall bring under
a Threefold consideration; for whether they be Carriers, Herdsmen,
or Farmers, or rather Hinds, they are all Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sals to supreme
Masters.</P>
<P>The first therefore are such as Travel to and again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Drove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> who must not
enter upon that Trust without a sure Return, <HI>non est abire domum
vacuumque redire;</HI> for they, for so many Beasts of Burthen, with
their Bells and Trappings, much like our Pack-Horses, (suppose
Twenty Mules, Thirty Asses, Forty, Fifty, Hundred, Two hun∣dred,
more or less committed to their Care,) stipulate for an
equivalent Profit to the Owners; the Pack <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>saddles are a Load them∣selves,
being thick and broad, and made afore with an high Steeple,
or Pyramid, and the Ridge in the middle is like a Mountain, over
which they hang their Carriages; the like is to be said of their Ca∣mels.
The Chief Drover is called <HI>Golabdar,</HI> and is priviledged only
to Command over his Fellow-Servants, not to Domineer over any
Passengers, whether <HI>Franks</HI> or Natives, as among the <HI>Turks</HI> is pra∣ctised,
but rather to yield themselves to the Obedience of those who
employ them.</P>
<P>Those that breed up Cattel are wandring Shepherds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Herds∣men.</NOTE> and have
no stated Habitation; but where they find the best Pasture they
pitch their Tents, together with their Wives, Children, and Fami∣lies,
with all their Troops, in the fattest Vallies, living abroad far
from great Towns, like the Wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> whose Chief, or Father of
the Tribe, is owned by them, and no other, he giving account to
the Emperor for the Number of their Flocks, and the Annual In∣crease;
for they are Morose and Untamed, and are apt enough to
<PB N="392" REF="216"/>
Worry any who fall unadvisedly among them: Their Dogs, with
which they guard the Folds, are like Wolves, as fierce and stronger
than their Wolves are here.</P>
<P>Among these we must reckon those that bring up the King's Breed
of Horses, because they lead a Life very like these, though under
the Jurisdiction of a Prime Courtier, who lives like a <HI>Persian</HI> both
for Eating and Pomp in his Pavilions of State in the open Fields,
keeping there a kind of a Court with his Fellows and Companions,
while the Inferior Servants provide for innumerable Droves of
Cattle; for whose Foles newly colted, the Mules are the best de∣fence,
(securing them from the attempts of the wildest Creatures
when their Mares shall desert them, by a vigorous resistance with
their Heels,) never leaving to prosecute them till they have drove
them from their designed Rape; and to this End shall muster them∣selves
together when they perceive any danger threaten the Young
ones in their respective Droves, and for the same purpose are nou∣rished
to be their Keepers.</P>
<P>These then are Vagrants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hus∣bandman.</NOTE> while the Husbandman fixes himself in
the Villages, to whom the native Soil is sweet, who reaps the Fruit
of his Labour, provided he take care to discharge his Landlord, who
generally is the Emperor, or else as bad a Task-master.</P>
<P>These go clad in course Cloths underneath, above with Felts,
kneaded into the form of a Coat, and are covered with Hats of the
same, but their Hats are grey, bound about with a Linnen Cloth
either of White, Green or Blew; their Coats are of what Colour
they please, but mostly Blew; their Hats are high-crowned, and
the Brim slit be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re and behind, which if it be cold, they pull down
and bind with their Cloth; if the Sun offend their Eyes, they draw
it over their Faces, or cock up when it is shady: When they rest,
the upper Garment is put on with Sleeves, armed with an undressed
Sheep's-skin against the injury of the Weather; their Shirt next their
Skin is rugged enough; over it a plain Jirkin is tied with an hard
Linnen Girdle of the same wooft with the Shirt: About the Calves
of their Legs they bind Rowlers for want of Stockins; and their
Shoes are soled with Wood, and the upper part wrought over with
Packthread.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dervises</HI> professing Poverty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dervis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI></NOTE> assume this Garb here, but not
with that State they ramble up and down in <HI>India;</HI> being without
Beasts of Burthen, without Wallets full of Provisions, which the others
seize by force, without Attendance, without other Ensigns or Wea∣pons
more than a Staff and Horn; travelling without Company, or
indeed any Safe-pass; and if they fix up their Standard, it is among
the Tombs; none giving them harbour, or encouraging this sort of
Madness, as well for the natural Antipathy to Beggery, as for that
under this Cloak many Intrigues and ill Designs have been car∣ried
on.</P>
<P>The Christians labour in their Vineyards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vine-dressers.</NOTE> as do the <HI>Jews</HI> also.</P>
<P>In all other Servility and Slavery the Old <HI>Gabers</HI> or <HI>Gaurs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaves made of the Old <HI>Persians.</HI></NOTE> the true

reduce them to; being once Lords of all the World, are no more
now than the Off-scum of the Earth, and the meanest on whom

<P>And these being the Lowest of Mankind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Eunuchs.</NOTE> made so by their Sloth;
we sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll pass from them, to those disabled from being Men by the
Barbarous Custom of these Nations; whose Favour must be courted
before we can come to the speech of their Women, I mean the
Eunuchs; who barking, straitly wake their Masters; to whom being
well disposed, it is hard to cast a seducing Bait before them; for
since they are incapable of Enjoyments, though not of the Thoughts
of Venery, their Masters conside in their Impotency to preside over
the Female Senate, setting them as Spies over their Incontinency,
and as faithful Keepers of their Vertue of Necessity: They order all
their Cloths, and see that every one be arraid as becomes them, and
that nothing indecent be committed among them; so pertenacious are
they in the Authority placed in them, out of a tyrannical Humour, that
they are never brought over to their Mistresses Designs, but are ever
trusty to their Master's Pleasure, being most exquisite in the Art of
Bawdery, and impure Assistants to Lechery; insomuch, that whoever
beholds them, must pronounce them a Map of Villany; for they look
as if they had stolen an Old Woman's Face, and a Puppit's Voice,
seldom Fat in Body, but always Lean in Visage, without Beard,
that not so much as the Hair of a Good Man appears, and the very
Image of that Divine Creature seems utterly eraced; that one would
suspect them to be <HI>Gypsies</HI> inverted, transformed from Young Men in∣to
Deformed Old Beldams, unless their Cloaths were allowed to be
the same as the Mens; for they have no other Testimony left of
their once being of the same Sex; for they are Gelded so inartificially,
or Butcherly rather, that All is cut off, nothing of witness being left,
but as clear as the Skin will permit; and thus are they given over to
Nature to cicatrize: If they live, it is well; if not, they try others
till they do; wherefore a Chyrurgion skilled in this Art, is of
greater value, than if he were expert in every other part, and defi∣cient

of the Female Sex,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Old Women.</NOTE> had they not been found faulty in their often
contriving and helping their Young Mistresses out in their Assigna∣tions;
of which they being conscious, they the more quietly admit
them into their Quarters, not to say more contentedly; for they
look upon them to be Overseers of their Actions, and imposed as so
many <HI>Argus</HI>'s to discover all their Intrigues.</P>
<P>In the mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Wo∣men.</NOTE> the Women of this Country are in a bad State,
where Jealousy reigns with such a sway, (and it is said not without
cause;) for which reason they are without hope of redress, or any
one so much as to pity them, since they'r known above once to
break through those Bars; nor is it wonderful when their Profoundest
Divines teach them to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, without Rational Souls, and there∣fore
<PB N="394" REF="217"/>
exclude them their Mosques; nor are they trained up in those
Principles from their Youth, which should render them fit to be∣come
prudent Matrons; but measuring from extraneous things the
sweetness of their Being, are instructed in Affairs of the Bed, Ban∣quetting,
Luxury, and Brutish Obsequiousness.</P>
<P>They are taught to Ride a Straddle like Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Excel∣lencies.</NOTE> to Leap, to Dart,
and drink Tobacco.</P>
<P>None, though of the Royal Lineage, are permitted in Matters of
State to meddle, or have their Cabals or Instruments, whereby to
convey their Policies; nor must they stir abroad unvailed, unless
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hut up in <HI>Cedgewaies,</HI> and then well attended.</P>
<P>They have little care over their Children, nor have they much
businesss with the Reel or Spindle; as if they were created only to
be Idle Companions for the Men; their Garments differ no farther
from the Mens than Conveniency requires; their Hair is braided
with Elegancy under their Veils, with a Golden Crown or Gar∣land,
bestuck with Jewels and precious Stones in pretty Knots and
Fancies.</P>

<P>The <HI>Plebean</HI> Women walk without Doors, either on Foot, or else
Ride on Horse-back covered with White Sheets, with Holes for their
Eyes and Nose; content to enjoy Day at a little Hole rather than
prostitute their Face to publick View; the honest Women have no
Borders to their Sheets.</P>
<P>Those that desire to be reputed Whores have large Borders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mark of a Whore.</NOTE> and
wear them as a Sign of their Trade; with which to disgrace a Mar∣ried
Woman, and to shave her Head, is the greatest Mark of Infamy
she can be branded with; unless to add a perpetual stigmatizing
Note, she be carried on an Ass, with her Face to the Tail, quite
through the City.</P>
<P>The Women are fair, with rather too much Ruddiness in their
Cheeks; their Hair and Eyes most black; a little Burly, by reason
they wear their Cloths loose, yet not altogether so, but more at ease
than our Dames; a Plump Lass being in more esteem than our Slen∣der
and Strait-laced Maidens.</P>
<P>The Lovers court not one another; for the Recluseness of their
Condition is such, that should they attempt to carry on a Secret
Amour, it could not long lie hid; wherefore when they are at leasure
to Love, they ask the Parents of the Daughter for their Consent,
which if they gain, the Match is struck up: That of <HI>Catullus</HI> being
granted,

She is led through the Streets in all her best Apparel vailed, with∣out
Dowry, more than what Goods and Chattels are sent with
lusty Slaves, by her several Relations, with a pompous Procession
and Illuminations, with noisy Musick for several Nights together;
and thus the Men, do as it were, buy their Wives, while the Women
are ignorant of the Chapman till they come together; it being not
reputable for Women of good Fame to enter upon such Bar∣gains.</P>
<P>Only professed Whores are tollerated to make the best of their
Markets;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Curtezans.</NOTE> Curtezans therefore are dispensed by the King, they gi∣ving
him so much for their License when they first set up, and An∣nually
as long as they practise, not exceeding the number of Forty
thousand in his Chief City of <HI>Suffahaun;</HI> and these are always Mar∣rying,
as the Poet pleasantly relates,

<P>When they go to Bed, they Clamber not up to them, as we do,
but throw themselves on the Ground after Carpets are laid, and a
Bed made in a Summer-House in some Garden, left open in Sum∣mer-time,
or else on the Tablets upon the Tops of their Houses;
where, if they observe any peeping upon them, or their Wives, an
Arrow drawn up to the head is let fly; nor does any blame the
Marks-man when he hits. In Winter-time they keep all close.</P>
<P>If a Curtezan conceive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Chil∣dren how provided for.</NOTE> and it proves a Girl, she is registred of
her Mothers Profession; if a Son, she fixes it on some Father.</P>
<P>There are costly Whores in this City, who will demand an hun∣dred
Thomands for one Nights Dalliance, and expect a Treat besides
of half the price; these while their Wit and Beauty last, outshine
the Ladies of the highest Potentate, and brave it through the Town
with an Attendance superior to the wealthiest.</P>
<P>In their Lyings in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lyings in, and Purifyings.</NOTE> it is common for the ordinary Peoples Wives
to meet together to assist the Woman that Cries out: And the Mo∣ther,
and the Babe, are purified by washing in their Hummums
after forty Days.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="218"/>
When their Husbands dye they make great Lamentations; the
Widows howling with their Neighbours and Relations, crying out,
Who will take care for us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Widows reckoned Mutes.</NOTE> who will defend the Cause of the Widow
and the Fatherless; after the Custom of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> where in Sa∣cred
Scripture they are termed Mutes, because there is none to
plead for them; and if by chance they offer to urge any thing for
themselves, no one regards their Complaints: For three Days after
their Kindred's Death they change not their Garments; the Men
shave not their Heads, or trim their Beards; the Women shear their
Heads, vow Widowhood, and go carelesly Clad, only in a Sheet
or mean Dress.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sodomy.</NOTE> when they let go their Modesty, put no bounds to
their lascivious Desires, not being content with Natural Inclinati∣ons,
outdo the Sensuality of the hottest Beasts, who never attempt
on other than the Females of their own Species; but these, oh
shame! covet Boys as much as Women; and to speak an horrid
Truth, are too guilty of Buggering other Creatures; these poor
Children thus abused are sad Spectacles, looking diseased, and are
not long liv'd.</P>
<P>So wholly bent on Pleasures are these People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Addicted to Pleasures.</NOTE> that to grow
Rich, be saluted with Honour, appear magnificently, be account∣ed
Noble and speciously Great, to Play, to Ride on Horseback with
Gold Trappings on Prancing Steeds, to feast Day and Night, they
will venture on any Evil Enterprize, and sell themselves to any
Mischief, well knowing without Money they can arrive at none
of these, so that they are intent to get it right or wrong: There∣fore
neither in Court, Camp, or in Judicature, is there catching
any thing without a Golden Hook; no one sues in <HI>forma pauperis,</HI>
Justice is not to be had without a Bribe; and if you Appeal to <HI>Caesar,</HI>
he is deaf, if you knock not at the Door with the Showre that opened
the way to <HI>Danae</HI>'s close Confiners.</P>
<P>On the other hand, commit any Wickedness, cast but a Golden
Mist before the Chief Ministers, and the King shall know nothing
of it; but if the Clamour of the Subject force a <HI>Magless,</HI> the Case
is not represented fairly to the Emperor, but as a Blend they mix
Falsities with Truth.</P>
<Q>Atque ita mentuntur, sic veris falsa remiscent.</Q>
<P>No Court in the World is fuller of Corruption than the <HI>Persian</HI> Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corruptness of the Cour∣tiers.</NOTE>
whereupon the Crowd is sent away no better satisfied than it came;
which causes ill Blood, a perpetual Reproach to the King, and if they
durst, Insurrections, which whether Fear, or want of Courage restrain
them, or the innate Fidelity and Passive Obedience on the formerly
mentioned grounds, I shall not determine: Since at this time they seem
to be more provoked by the Supiness of the Emperor, and the Ill
Management of the Government, and the general out-cry of the Mo∣bile;
but yet, even in this Confusion I do not perceive a Propensity
to Rebellion, though they refrain not from open Curses, especially
the Womenkind, who are set on by the Men to bellow their Oppres∣sions,
which they roar at the Palace Gates, by Troops of Women,
<PB N="397" REF="218"/>
in a Tumultuous manner some Weeks together; to which Vocal
Weapons they are sparing.</P>
<P>When as should the Men come in a Riot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Women made use on to com∣plain.</NOTE> they would handle them
otherwise; which is the reason they thrust them on to complain,
when they dare not speak their own Grievances, it being not held
manly to fight with a Woman.</P>
<P>And hence it comes to pass that the Law loses its Authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persian</HI> places Felicity in Prosperity.</NOTE> and
the Subject becomes a Prey to the Avarice and Violence of the Ma∣gistrate;
and while the one grows exorbitantly Rich, the other be∣comes
miserably Poor, through an unproportionable distribution;
and by these Exactions is verified the Proverb, <HI>Homo homini Lupus;</HI>
One Man devours another more cruelly than a Wolf. Nor is it pos∣sible
for one that is Poor ever to rise without a Miracle, there being
no Mean between extreme Poverty and the height of Wealth or
Honour, which makes the Great ones truly Great, while the deject∣ed
Wretches have no other Sanctuary than to appear under the shel∣ter
of the Mighty; and to be reckoned of their Retinue is all the
Favour to be expected in recompense for the most notorious Injury;
which would augment the Affliction of a Generous Spirit, to follow
on Foot the exalted Extortioner that has undone him, who climbed
over others Ruin to be eminently Rich, and is still upheld by their
Downfall. And this must ever be the state of those Kingdoms where
Goodness is banished, and Virtue must give place to Vice; and this
unavoidably happens where ever the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion takes
place; which makes a voluptuous Life the only Benediction both on
Earth and in their Heaven; and this squares more peculiarly with the
Climat and the Temper of the <HI>Persians,</HI> than any other Nation un∣der
the cope of Heaven: For since Misfortunes are looked on as the
most grievous Curses, they all aim either to be, or to be thought
Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perous; whence it is not only indecent, but unhappy to walk
on Foot out of Necessity; and he that comes abroad with the finest
Palfry, the richest Accoutrements, the most Followers, with Foot∣men
with Bells at their Wastes, Feathers in their Turbats, Em∣broidered
Horse-Cloaths over their Shoulders, delicately wrought
Saddles for War and Housings, Golden Bridles, Breast-Plates and
Cruppers often beset with Precious Stones; has his Golden Headed
<HI>Coleon</HI> behind him magnificently carried, with change of Vests in
rich <HI>Buy-Shoes</HI> or Portmantles; he is the Favourite of Heaven and
the Darling of Fortune, is courted by all, and esteemed the chief
care of Providence. Thus mightily are the gaudy Bubbles of For∣tune
admired here; on which account to be most Impious is most
emulated, since to arrive at these Ends there is no other method than
what has already been related.</P>
<P>And thus Equipped they appear in their Martial Camps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Recrea∣tions and Ex∣ercises.</NOTE> not to
out-do, but out-shine each other, where they have <HI>Obelisks</HI> for
Goals, where they try their Steeds, not giving them a long Race,
but short and swift; they, as most of the <HI>East</HI> do, Ride short, and
stop with a Jerk; for which, as has been said in <HI>India,</HI> their Curbs
are useful, that on a motion they Obey; otherwise they (being placed
with a sharp Cone, in a round Ring pointing on the Tongue,) so
pierce it that it Bleeds as if struck with a Fleme; here they <HI>Gerede,</HI>
<PB N="398" REF="219"/>
or cast Darts, play with Balls on Rackets, bringing their Steeds to
observe the Rebound; here they train their Hawks to fly at Crows,
and Crows to fly at Sparrows: Here they Exercise among themselves
what the King requires to be presented before him; and the Nobility
learn to Shoot backward, as the <HI>Parthians,</HI> their Predecessors, were
wont, and in that were dreaded more on flight than when they stood
to it; nor is this the only Skill they pretend to with Bows and Ar∣rows,
but Shoot at Marks not far distant, though they seldom pra∣ctise
Rovers.</P>
<P>On these Sands the Anointed Wrestler keeps himself in Breath,
and the undaunted Fencer bares his Livid Arm; Rams are set against
Rams, and against Bulls, Lions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and against all, our <HI>English</HI> Mastiffs,
who carry the Prize from the Combatants, when they Celebrate the
<HI>Boetian</HI> Games.</P>
<P>They are frequent Huntsmen:<NOTE PLACE="marg">They Hunt a long time to∣gether.</NOTE> When they go out on this sport
they return not in a Days time, as we do, but remove from place to
place, where Game is to be had; take with them their Wives and
Family, and Travel in state with full prepared Tables, and act the
<HI>Bacchinals</HI> like <HI>Alexander;</HI> for which purpose they have their Tents
and close Carriages, their <HI>Gogdans</HI> for Provisions; they carry also
<HI>Bulgar</HI>-Hides, which they form into Tanks to Bathe themselves,
and Women, in their Progress; for drinking Cups they have both
Gold and Silver ones, as also large Flasks of that Metal; besides
Earthen Jars for Water, and <HI>Puckeries,</HI> which are porous Vessels to
keep their Liquor Cool.</P>
<P>Upon their Return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Treated on their re∣turn.</NOTE> or Entrance of any Magistrate into any great

Train of Servants, and especially those bearing their Tobacco-Ves∣sels,
Tea, and Coffee-Pots; which, with hot Rose-Water, and Su∣gar-Candy,
is their preparatory Fore runner to a splendid Entertain∣ment;
which they are sure to have at the return to their Palaces,

<P>Alighting they are introduced the Guest-Chamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Immoderate in their Feast∣ing.</NOTE> all bestrewed
with Flowers and sweet Herbs, besides perfumed with Odoriferous
Gums, or the Aloes Wood alone, or other resiny Matters made into
Candles, and in Massy Silver Fuming-Pots very costly and delicate;
leaving their Slippers where they begin to tread on Carpets; they
take their Seats on <HI>Susanees,</HI> a rich Tapestry of Needle-Work that
Borders the Carpets, behind which are placed huge Velvet Bolsters,
before them Spitting Pots to void their Spittle in when they Smoak
Tobacco, or Eat <HI>Pawn;</HI> these Rooms are large and airy, and open fold∣ing
Windows on every side, where being placed they bring their
<HI>Coloons;</HI> after which they Welcome you by a flood of Rose-Water,
or other Compound Water poured on your Head and Beard, then
they bring in, in neat Voiders, China Plates of Fruit, as Pistachia's,
Walnuts, Almonds, Haslenuts, Grapes, Prunes, Prunello's, Apri∣cots
Dried, and Sweatmeats Wet and Dry of all sorts, amidst
whereof they fill out Coffee, Tea, and Hot Rose-Water, and all the
while have Mimicks, Stage-Players, and Dancers to divert, between
<PB N="399" REF="219"/>
whose Interludes is mixed the Custom, as ancient as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI>
of certain Wife <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en repeating Verses in their Praise, or reading Mo∣numents
of Antiquity, which continues till Victuals are brought in,
and the Cloath spread on the Carpets, every one keeping their places;
First, Water being brought in great Silver Basons and Ewers to
Wash, the Courses are ushered in with loud Musick, and the Table
being filled, the Servitors are placed so as to furnish every one with
Plates of the several Varieties, which they place before each,
and give them long Wheaten Cakes, both for Napkins, Trencher,
and Bread, and sometimes thin Pancakes made of Rice; though
Boiled Rice serves usually for Bread, which they mix with their
Soops and Pottage.</P>
<P>The usual Drink is <HI>Sherbet,</HI> made of Water, Juice of Lemmons,
and Ambergreece, which they drink out of long thin Wooden
Spoons, wherewith they lade it out of their Bowls.</P>
<P>The most admired Dainty, wherewith they stuff themselves, is
<HI>Pullow,</HI> whereof they will sill themselves up to the Throat and re∣ceive
no hurt, it being so well prepared for the Stomach. After
they have Eaten well, and the Cloath is removed, they Wash again.</P>
<P>And then most of them will freely take off their Bowls of Wine,
(which is brought to each by their several Servants) most of Silver,
some of Gold, which we call a <HI>Toss,</HI> and is made like a Wooden
Dish, purposely so shap'd for convenient Carriage, at the bottom of
their <HI>Coosdans</HI> placing their <HI>Gurgulets</HI> upon it, which <HI>Coosdan</HI> is a
Case made neatly of Rattans or Canes, covered with a Coverlet
of Scarlet, Bordered with Silk for Shew as well as to keep the
Dust off.</P>
<P>When they have tired themselves with Feasting (which is not
suddenly) as they depart, they return Thanks, by Inviting every
one in course to an Entertainment of the like nature, where they
strive to outdo each other. Thus extravagantly Luxurious and im∣moderately
Profuse are they in their great Feasts, stately Dining-Rooms,
magnificent Gardens, and Water-Courses; exceeding the
<HI>Roman</HI> Voluptuousness, of whose Prodigality <HI>Seneca.</HI></P>

<P>In their Weddings, Childbearings, Circumcisions and Purifying Ban∣quets,
they make great Revellings, Fireworks and Rejoycings Night
and Day for a Month together, that it is troublesome living in great
Cities by reason of their Nocturnal Perambulations, when they Shoot,
Shout, and make great Acclamations, with hideous thundring Ket∣tle
Drums and Trumpets; and however obscure they live at other
times, they are wholly taken up in Expences at these Times, and
<PB N="400" REF="220"/>
sometimes forgetting the main Chance, they say out all, and more,
to imitate Men of Fame.</P>
<P>But the greatest Festivities are injoined by the Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Religi∣ous Feasts.</NOTE> some
whereof are common to the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> others belong only
to the <HI>Persian</HI> Sect; as those in the end of their great Fast of the

<HI>Archflamen,</HI> or one for him, should sacrifice a Ram in memory of

<P>But as if nothing were owing either to the Affections of the Vulgar,

within doors, with his Pimps and Panders comes abroad like
a <HI>Royster,</HI> neither regarding the Temple, or the Grandure of the

the Homage of all his Great Slaves, and they should pay their
Feuditory Tributes, for which he should return them <HI>Colluts,</HI> or Robes
of Honour, either by themselves or Substitutes, and at the same time
entertain them Royally; where, besides the usual Sports, on this Day
there is a peculiar Diversion of the <HI>Shotters</HI> or Footmen, begun at

which space the <HI>Shotter</HI> that is appointed, fetches Twelve Small
Streamers placed a <HI>Pharsang</HI> distant from the Starting-Post, which
is before the Palace-Gate, which reckoning four Miles to a <HI>Pharsang,</HI>
is four times Twelve, or Forty eight Miles backwards and forwards,
but at a modest computation it is full Three Miles that they run,
and then it will amount to Seventy two Miles that they run in
Twelve hours time; which I once saw performed at the <HI>Caun</HI> of

He sets out with his Fellows, who by Turns wait his return, and
are obliged to attend him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foot-racing.</NOTE> both to make way, and to fan him in his
passage, and to be ready with Towels to rub the Sweat off his Body:
Two or three hours before Noon the Prime Nobility gather to re∣ceive
the King's Commands; some to be Spectators, others to act
afore the <HI>Mageless;</HI> where at the appearance of the <HI>Shotter,</HI> with his
Streamer in his Hand, the loud Musick proclaims his coming: When
he has fetched the last, the King has notice, and all with him ascend∣ing
their Steeds, wait on the Emperor, who meeting him, the <HI>Shotter</HI>
runs chearfully afore his Horse, and holds his Horse till he alights,
and prostrate before him, delivers the Streamer, for which, after he is
cleansed, and the <HI>Mageless</HI> is seated, he is brought before the Emperor
of the <HI>Suffees,</HI> clothed with nothing more than his running Breeches,
and then a Rich Vest is thrown over him, and receives a Gratuity
besides from the <HI>Suffee,</HI> whose Example all there present following,
he is plentifully rewarded, and made Chief <HI>Shotter</HI> for the ensuing
Year: After the <HI>Shotter</HI>'s Race is over, the <HI>Suffee</HI> calls all his No∣bles
to a Sumptuous Feast, which concludes with demonstrations of
Excessive Joy.</P>
<P>At the beginning of <HI>April</HI> they have a proper Feast of their own,
where the Emperor is to give the People of <HI>Suffahaun</HI> a Camel to be
slain, which they lead about the Streets with a confused Noise, be∣ing
dressed very fine with Flowers and Garlands for the Altar; and
being brought to the Priest, he cuts the Throat, and burns the En∣trails,
distributing to each Principal Ward of the City the several
Quarters to be eaten publickly after they are roasted, the Head only
being presented to an Old <HI>Sybil,</HI> the only Relict of the Tribe to
which it appertains by right, which she preserves till next Year, and
then produces it at the Feast, for which she has a setled Pension;
and the Blood of the fresh slain is scrambled for to besmear their Lin∣tels
and Side-posts, signing them with the Sign of the Cross: What
relation it has to the Passover ordained to the <HI>Jews,</HI> I could never
learn from them; but they say it is to keep their Houses free from
Hobgoblins and Evil Spirits: It is called <HI>Aede Corboon.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>December</HI> they observe a Feast for the happy Conjunction

Conveyance than the direct Ancestry) through the repea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
Alterations of Fortune, to the present Possessors, who were originally
of a morose Extract; yet have they put off their Native Ferity, to
comply with the over-ruling Influence of the Climate.</P>
<P>For the very Plebeans in other Parts, surly and unconversable,
are here Affable and Kind, not Rude and Unmannerly; where-ever
you meet them, before you salute them, they accost you with <HI>Sa∣lam
Aleekum,</HI> God's Peace be with you; and if you do the like to
them, they resalute you, and bowing with their Hands across their
Breast, return <HI>Aleekum Salam,</HI> God save you; approaching nigher,
they Embrace with the Appellation of <HI>mi Sahab,</HI> my Friend, or
more properly, my Lord; <HI>Cuddah ne gardin,</HI> God be propitious to
you; in passant, they cry with some vehemence, <HI>Chehauldore;</HI>
how fare you? to which they reply, <HI>Choukossee,</HI> at your Service;
at Departure, <HI>Salamut basheet,</HI> Peace be your Companion; at
Meeting, <HI>Nosajun Bashut,</HI> I am glad to see you; at Meals, <HI>Aupheat
Bashut,</HI> much Good may it do you; if any fail the appointment
after Invitation, or come late, being called, they say <HI>Ja Shamau
collee booth pishee eauroon,</HI> Your Seat is empty among so many good
Friends; and what I wonder at more, many Words in use among
the <HI>High Dutch,</HI> are in Common Discourse with them, as <HI>Fader</HI>
signifies Father; <HI>Moder,</HI> Mother; <HI>Broder,</HI> Brother; <HI>bad, beeter,</HI>
and innumerable of the like sort; which not only confirms their
being <HI>Scythians,</HI> but corroborates the Learned Antiquary, Mr. <HI>She∣ringham</HI>'s
Opinion of <HI>Woden,</HI> and his <HI>Asas</HI> or <HI>Asiaticks, (Asa</HI> being
a Common Name among the <HI>Parsys</HI> in <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Gaurs</HI> here) and
of our being derived from them, as appears in his <HI>Anglorum Gentis
Origine.</HI></P>
<P>The Courtiers think the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language more commanding,
and therefore addict themselves to that Speech, which is neither so
Polite or Verbose, but more Gutteral; the present Dialect of the
<HI>Persians</HI> is much more smooth and neat, yet not agreeable with the
old Character, as may appear by our <HI>Polyglot</HI> Bible, which they
understand no more than they do <HI>Welch.</HI></P>
<P>But to perfect their Urbanity; when they Encounter, they pluck
not off their Caps, but with a pleasing Modesty bow their Heads;
within Doors they bare their Feet by pulling off their Shoes,
<PB N="403" REF="221"/>
which they leave at the Entrance upon the <HI>Bucchanno's;</HI> not that they
salute thereby, but out of Cleanliness to preserve their Carpets, from
which when they descend, their Servants stand ready to help them
to their Shoes, and while they are seated, glory to be incircled with
Servitors; nor do they presume afore their Betters to use any other
Seat than their Heels, till they have License to sit at ease.</P>
<P>They are formal in the matter of going First, and shall protract
the Ceremony into a tedious Contention, and generally are pressed
hard to Precedency, and will strain a Courtesy to Strangers.</P>
<P>The Custom of carrying <HI>Aves</HI> one to another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Custom of carrying <HI>Aves.</HI></NOTE> is not Obsolete.</P>
<Q>Prima Salutantes atque altera continet hora.</Q>
<P>No more than among <HI>Martial</HI>'s Parasites, the very Slaves Reveren∣cing
the Threshold of their Lord's Doors; so extravagant are they
of their Courtesies, with an hundred such good Morrows; but if
any weighty thing be to be presented, it is with an eye to Profit.</P>
<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Virtues.</NOTE> not to exempt them from all good Inclinations, could
we excommunicate Self-Praise, <HI>Philautia,</HI> from their Pious Acts, we
might discern some noble Deeds for which they merit to be extolled,
as the Building of Temples, Publick Hospitals for Travellers, (not
for Sick or Wounded) which are the <HI>Caravan Seraws,</HI> Colleges,
Bridges, Fountains, plaining Mountains, and raising Vallies, for to
facilitate the Way for long and troublesome Journies.</P>
<P>The Colleges that are not of Royal Foundations, are Adjuncts to
the Prophets Tombs, or Built in Commemoration of some Noble
Warrior; to be Buried near which, is the desire of these <HI>Martis A∣lumni,</HI>
as much as for Catholicks to be Buried in St. <HI>Francis</HI> his Ha∣bit;
which Sepulchres are, as it were, Triumphant Arches, after
the Figures of their Mosques, in the middle whereof is deposited the
Corps in a Stone Tomb, like a Chest, or Coffin, with Four Golden
or Silver Apples, at each Corner One, commonly covered with a
Purple wrought Pall, with curious Artifice; over head hang Stream∣ers
and Banners, and it is Railed with Iron Rails, in which are
Lamps always Burning; nor do any enter with their Shoes on,
the Floor being Matted, or spread with Carpets; and if a <HI>Mullah</HI>
attends, he goes to Prayers for the Quiet of the deceased Soul.
They never Bury in the Church, and seldom in the City; they per∣mit
Representations of Lions or Tigers, on Grave-Stones, as has been
said, to express a Man taken away in the prime of his Age; have
Inscriptions and Places for Incense; they always lay the Body <HI>North</HI>
and <HI>South,</HI> in opposition to us <HI>Christians,</HI> who Bury our Dead <HI>East</HI>
and <HI>West;</HI> agreeing in most things with the other <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>To this Magnificence and Civility of Temper, we may add a
Third Virtue, their Fidelity to their Princes.</P>
<P>For which Excellencies they seem to be beholden to the pureness
of their Air; for it is Hot and Dry for the most part, whereby their
Hearts are more firm and solid, which makes them more constant
and resolute, they being of a more refined Head than the other
<HI>Easterns,</HI> their Brain being more spirituous and clear.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="222"/>
To which Three Graces, notwithstanding, there are a Trine
Aspect of Vices; to Magnificence, Oppression and Covetousness;
to Munificence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vices.</NOTE> Intemperance and Lust; to Fidelity, Jealousy and
Revenge.</P>
<P>The Philosophers agree not with <HI>Galen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How far be∣holden to Constitution of Body and Air.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
that the Body suffers from the Affections of the Mind;
they saying, That they depend not on the Texture of the Body,
but are Conjoined with it; yet Experience teaches, That as often as
the Mind is Troubled, the Spirits are variously Agitated, which
move the Blood and put it on a Fret, whereby the Heart is Con∣vulsed,
and many times the whole Frame of the Body is put out of
Order.</P>
<P>And therefore is it necessary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Diet.</NOTE> that to the excellency of the Air,
and disposition of the Body, a requisite Diet, as well for Meat as
Drink, should correspond with both; and indeed Nature seems to
have provided them with both, for those they desire are these:</P>
<P><HI>Cabob</HI> is Rostmeat on Skewers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabob.</NOTE> cut in little round pieces no bigger
than a Sixpence, and Ginger and Garlick put between each. Thus
sparingly do they feed on Flesh alone, ordered after this manner; and
if at any time they intend a Meal thereon, they have it well Boiled,
Baked, Fried, or Stewed, or made into <HI>Pullow;</HI> which is a general
Mess, as frequent with them as a good substantial piece of Beef is
with us, and reckoned their standing Dish; which is made either of
Flesh, Fish, or Fowl, as the <HI>Indian Moors</HI> do; but the best is made
of the fattest Meat, for which the pondrous Tails of Suet (which
their Sheep bear) is most coveted, in regard it saves Butter.</P>
<P>To make <HI>Pullow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pullow.</NOTE> the Meat is first Boiled to Rags, and the Broth or
Liquor being strained, it is left to drain, while they Boil the Rice in the
same; which being tender, and the aqueous parts evaporating, the
Juice and Gravy incorporates with the Rice, which is Boiled almost
dry; then they put in the Meat again with Spice, and at last as
much Butter as is necessary, so that it becomes not too Greesy or Of∣fensive,
either to the Sight or Taste; and it is then Boiled enough
when it is fit to be made into Gobbets, not slabby, but each Corn of
Rice is swelled and filled, not burst into Pulp; and then with <HI>Mango</HI>
or other <HI>Achar,</HI> they will devour whole Handfuls (for Spoons are
not in use, unless to drink <HI>Sherbet</HI> with, they mixing their Pottage
with dry Rice, and cramming themselves with their Fingers) and
never Surfeit; always taking this for a Rule, never to Drink till they
are satisfied, it causing them otherwise to swell too soon; and then
they will Eat as much at a Meal, as an Horse or Mule can of Barly.</P>
<P>Baked Meat they call <HI>Dumpoke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dumpoke.</NOTE> which is dressed with sweet
Herbs and Butter, with whose Gravy they swallow Rice dry
Boiled.</P>
<P>Their Stews are also made of Cooling Fruits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stews.</NOTE> as Cucumbers,
Gourds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they mingle Rice with.</P>
<P>But the bulk of their Diet consists of the Fruits of the Teeming
Earth, sowre Milk, with soft Cheese, Grapes and Wheaten Bread.</P>
<P>They have a kind of Cooling Musilage of Seeds, like <HI>Psyllium;</HI>
in the Maritime parts they use Dates instead of Bread, or Bread
made Pancake Fashion of Rice.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="222"/>
They have a Dish they call <HI>Cookoo Challow,</HI> which is dry Rice and
a Fritter of Eggs, Herbs, and Fishes,</P>
<P>They seldom Eat fresh Butter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cookoo Chal∣low.</NOTE> and as seldom Beefs Flesh; the
Poor near the Sea live only on Fish and Dates; the Rich live plenti∣fully
every where.</P>
<P>No Country is more taken with Sweetmeats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No good Con∣fections.</NOTE> not even the <HI>Lusi∣tanians;</HI>
wherefore Sugar is a good Commodity from <HI>India,</HI> for <HI>Persia</HI>
produces none of its own; they are not such Confectioners, not∣withstanding,
as might be expected from so constant a desire and
practice; the chief reason I can impute it to is Custom, which in
every thing they are very tenacious of.</P>
<P>They mightily covet cool things to the Palat, wherefore they
mix Snow, or dissolve Ice in their Water, Wine, or Sherbets.</P>
<P>Out of Taylets of Willows they make a compound Cool-Water,
very sweet smelling and refreshing.</P>
<P>Sherbets are made of almost all Tart pleasing Fruits as the Juice
of Pomegranets, Lemmons, Citrons, Oranges, Prunella's, which
are to be bought in the Markets. Thus by Diet, as well as Air,
they procure not only a firmness of Constitution, but Properness
and Tallness of Body, for none excel them either for Beauty or
Stature.</P>
<P>But before we part with this Subject, since they are not so starch'd
and precisely bent as the more rigorous <HI>Mahometans,</HI> we may be ac∣quainted
with their constant course of Eating, and lie down with
them at Meals, and receive a good Welcome.</P>
<P>Their Breakfast is begun with Melons, Cucumbers, Gourds,
Grapes, or other Fruits, as Peaches, Apricots, Cherries, or the
like, with soft Cheese or Butter-Milk; which is about Ten in the
Morning, from which time they abstain from all manner of Food
(I mean when they observe their set Meals till near Sun-set) when
they feed heartily on Flesh, or any other hot Meats, and enlarge
sometimes till Midnight.</P>
<P>They observe the same usage for going to Stool as the other
<HI>Easterns,</HI> washing away the Filth with the Left hand, for no other
cause than that they feed themselves with the Right.</P>
<P>They sit down to make Water, but whether that way empties
the Bladder better I leave to conjecture; though their continual sit∣ting
within doors with their Legs up to their Bellies helps digestion,
is a thing beyond dispute.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Persians</HI> never Spit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persians</HI> Spit as much as other Peo∣ple.</NOTE> I cannot allow to be true, since
they Smoak Tobacco in their most solemn Assemblies, and for that
purpose we have already shewed they are provided with Spitting-Pots,
or <HI>Pigdans;</HI> but since <HI>Xenophon</HI> relateth it in the <HI>First Paedia
Cyri,</HI> as a reproach for any to Spit in Company, and brings it as an
argument of Gluttony, or Laziness, <HI>Nunquam sputant in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conventu Per∣sae,
quia maximum ignominioe argumentum, quasi indicaret eos aut plus cibi,
quam par esset sumere, aut nullis corporis exercitationibus uti;</HI> I must add,
that I find them to indulge both; nor are they ashamed to Carouse
or Eat lustily, but on the contrary Gormandize to excess; there is
therefore nothing but the Thinness of the Air, expressing their super∣fluous
Humours can bespeak this Virtue; nor indeed do I find them
differ much in that point from other Nations.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="223"/>
To conclude then; to the Endowments of Mind, they have an
Happiness of Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Happi∣ness of Body.</NOTE> through the extraordinary Fineness of Air,
which by a suitableness of Food nourishes a well-mix'd Temper both
of Soul and Body; for as they have the start in the first, so they sur∣pass
all their Neighbours in the latter, being not only Ingenuous
and Free, but Fair, Tall, and Comely, with a Stock of Health not
easily to be impaired, unless violent Debauchery root up the Stabi∣lity
they enjoy by Nature.</P>
<P>Thus having run through their Distributive Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commutative Justice.</NOTE> their Religion,
and Morality, their several Rites, Usages, and Ceremonies; it re∣mains
then, as we have declared their Wealth and Merchandize, so
we should shut up all with their Commutative or Trading Justice,
which keeps an Arithmetical Proportion; as buying, selling, letting,
and hiring. The Valuation of every thing is made either by Num∣ber,
Weight, or Measure: Number is the same, and common to all
People, Tongues, and Nations; but Weight and Measure are not so,
there being a great Variety of these, and every Country has a Sta∣tutable
Account of Weight and Measure after their own form.</P>
<P>All things in <HI>Persia</HI> are put into Balance, but Silk woven and
Cloath; wherefore they weigh all Liquids, as well as Wood, Straw,
and Metals; and measure by the <HI>Cobit,</HI> or Cubit, what comes from
the Loom, even their most fine Carpets.</P>
<P>Which brings us to examine their Weights, Measures, and Coins,
or Current Money.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last I had thought to have presented you with my own
hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. I.</NOTE> but being still detained, I must persist to give you
farther Trouble.</P>
<P>Forty Course <HI>Northward</HI> of <HI>Surat</HI> lies <HI>Broach;</HI> it therefore being
esteemed in relation to the <HI>English</HI> as a Branch of this Factory, up∣on
any one of our Merchants being ill, they can easily and suddenly
send a Messenger for Assistance; which gave me opportunity of see∣ing
that City, soon after I had returned with the President to <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>The Way thither is twofold, either by Sea or Land; the first,
from <HI>Swally-hole,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author sent for to <HI>Broach.</HI></NOTE> makes an easy Passage up that Creek, or rather
Arm of the Sea, to <HI>Broach</HI> River's Mouth, into which the River
empties its self: The latter is measured over a spacious Plain, and is
travelled either by Coach or on Horseback, both which I had for my
Conveyance, together with the Attendance of a good Guard of the
Company's <HI>Peons,</HI> because of frequent Robberies hereabouts. Going
out by <HI>Broach</HI>-Gate, we fell into a notable beaten Way;
<Q>Hoc iter manifesta rotae vestigia cernes.</Q>
Contrary to whatever we found in any Place of <HI>Persia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Different Modes of tra∣velling in <HI>In∣dia,</HI> from that of <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE>
where are neither Carts, Coaches, or Wains: There we sel∣dom
meet any to turn us out of our Way; here the Roads
are pester'd with Caphalaes of Oxen, Camels, and Bufolaes, with
heavy Waggons drawn by Teams of Oxen, yok'd Eight, some∣times
a Dozen or Sixteen times double, bringing and carrying Goods
of all sorts: There with Guides, here with Guards, for fear of Thieves
descending from the Mountains, or lying in Ambuscado among the
<PB N="410" REF="225"/>
Thickets:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter VI.</NOTE> There they journey at all Seasons, secure from Weather
or Assaults; here they must observe the set times, and move with a
good Force, both to defend them from their own Armies, and the
Insults of Outlaws: Here are no Caravans or Inns to shut them
in a-nights, for then is their time of travelling; and when they
rest, if they have no Tents, they must shelter themselves under
shady Trees, or sometimes great Tombs in the Highways, unless
they happen on a <HI>Chowkre, i. e.</HI> a Shed, where the Customer keeps a
Watch to take Custom: Yet good Rivers are more often found here
than there; and where they are deficient, they want not great Tanks
or Ponds of Rain-Water mostly uncover'd and open to the Heavens,
or else deep Wells many Fathom under Ground, with stately Stone
Stairs, Cool Apartments, and Grottoes, whence Oxen (as has been
said) draw Water, with huge Leathern Buckets or Pots around a
Wheel, to water their Gardens: But one thing you are more sure of
here than there, and that is, Provisions of all sorts, in almost every
Village, which stand thick hereabouts.</P>
<P>The Coaches (unless those called the President's) and Carts are
much alike,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Chariots for travelling.</NOTE> the last being only stronger built with main Timber for
strength. But it being no unpleasant spectacle to see one of these
Chariots equipped, I cannot forbear giving it you; though I am
sensible it cannot be so well express'd in writing, as the Sight is now
comically represented unto me: Two large Milk-white Oxen are
putting in to draw it, with circling Horns as black as a Coal, each
Point tipped with Brass, from whence come Brass Chains across to
the Headstall, which is all of Scarlet, and a Scarlet Collar to each,
of Brass Bells, about their Necks, their flapping Ears snipped with
Art, and from their Nostrils Bridles covered with Scarlet: The Cha∣riot
it self is not swinging like ours, but fasten'd to the main Axle
by neat Arches, which support a Foursquare Seat, which is inlaid
with Ivory, or enriched as they please; at every Corner are turn'd
Pillars, which make (by twisted Silk or Cotton Cords) the Sides,
and support the Roof, covered with <HI>English</HI> Scarlet Cloth, and lin'd
with Silk, with Party-colour'd Borders; in these they spread Car∣pets,
and lay Bolsters to ride cross-legg'd, sometimes three or four
in one: It is born on two Wheels only, such little ones as our Fore∣wheels
are, and pinn'd on with a Wooden Arch, which serves to
mount them: The Charioteer rides afore, a-straddle on the Beam
that makes the Yoke for the Oxen, which is covered with Scarlet,
and finely carved underneath; he carries a Goad instead of a Whip:
In Winter (when they rarely stir) they have a <HI>Mumjuma,</HI> or Wax-Cloth
to throw over it. Those for Journeying are something strong∣er
than those for the Merchants to ride about the City, or to take
the Air on; which with their nimble Oxen they will, when they
meet in the Fields, run Races on, and contend for the Garland as
much as for an Olympick Prize; which is a Diversion, <HI>To see a Cow
gallop,</HI> as we say in scorn; but these not only pluck up their Heels
apace, but are taught to amble, they often riding on them.</P>
<P>Four-wheel'd Coaches, and to sit with the Legs hanging down,
here are none, unless some few the <HI>Europe</HI> Merchants have, covered
with Scarlet, and ill hung, being much like those sold at <HI>London</HI> to
<PB N="411" REF="225"/>
please little Children with, only larger, and lin'd with Velvet; they
having no Horses managed for the Coach, or any skill'd to drive
them, so that these also are drawn by Oxen.</P>
<P>Setting out about Sun rise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bereaw.</NOTE> we passed by pleasant Inclosures spread
far from the City, and flourishing Fields of Corn, and Plantations of
Tobacco; we came Three Course, and then ferried over the River to
<HI>Bereaw,</HI> a Village on the Bank of the other side; and at <HI>Persaw,</HI> two
Course more, we broke our Fast; when it growing hot, we went
but a Course and a half over another small River, before we baited
under a Grove of Palms, or Toddy-Trees.</P>
<P>When the Crows came hither to roost (which they did in great
Flocks) we departed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncliseer.</NOTE> and at Midnight arrived at <HI>Vncliseer,</HI> the
most <HI>Northern</HI> Extent of the Province of <HI>Guzerat</HI> (after the old ac∣count)
where Custom is exacted, a Bar of Thorns being stuck into an
high Gate, opposing such as are to pay at each end of the Town.
Here we slept at our Broker's House, and at Sun-rise proceeded over
delicate Medows to <HI>Broach</HI>-River, where round about it is all Cam∣paign;
betwixt where, we met more than Five hundred Oxen laden
with Salt for the Inland Countries; and betwixt Nine and Ten passed
<HI>Broach</HI> River in a Boat; which is a broad, swift, and deep River,
but choaked up with drifts of Sand, by reason of Rains forced into
the very Channel, so that good Pilots are required, to steer clear of
them; by whose directions good lusty Vessels are brought up to the
City-Walls, where they are laden with Salt and Corn, to be carried
to those Parts that are not so well furnished; here being excellent
Wheat and good Cottons, of the Growth of this Country.</P>
<P>It is likewise the Thoroughfare to <HI>Lhor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Broach</HI>-City.</NOTE> <HI>Dhely, Agra,</HI> and <HI>Ami∣davad,</HI>
which is the chief City now of this Province, as well as of

Empire, which was before the <HI>Portugals</HI> were strong in these Parts,
who made way for the <HI>Mogul</HI> to make an entire Conquest thereof:
But as to what concerns its peculiar History, it was dismantled, and
the Walls thrown down, for refusing Passage to <HI>Shaw Juan</HI>'s Army,
the Father to the present <HI>Auren Zeeb;</HI> which, as appears by the
Ruins, were very strong of old, being doubly wall'd and trench'd,
into which Nin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gates still lead the way; wherein was an Heathen

the same Booty, Burning and Spoiling the Country about till they
send him a Peace Offering; of which they having informed the
Emperor now the Walls are built, that he Taxes them as much as
before, and that his Musters are not half filled for the defence of the

fled all but one, which was easily vanquished; and the Pink feign∣ed

and blew some Hundreds up from her Prow and Poop, and then
plying her great Guns, on those who were Board and Board, sunk Four
of their Gallies, and put the rest to flight; which made them more

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMidst these Wars and rumours of Wars, we quietly lay
down our Arms, and leave <HI>Seva Gi</HI> and the <HI>Syddy</HI> alone to
contend for our stony piece of Ground on <HI>Henry Kenry;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Syddy</HI> and <HI>Seva</HI> left to contend for <HI>Henry Kenry.</HI></NOTE>
how much to our Honour or Reproach, may be gathered
from the Language we have daily cast in our Teeth; <Q>Why Vaunts
your Nation? What Victories have you atchieved? What has your
Sword done? Who ever felt your Power? What do you possess?
We see the <HI>Dutch</HI> outdo you; the <HI>Portugals</HI> have behaved them∣selves
like Men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> Reproach'd.</NOTE> every one runs you down; you can scarce keep
<HI>Bombaim,</HI> which you got (as we know) not by your Valour,
but Compact; And will you pretend to be Men of War, or Cope
with our Princes? It's fitter for you to live on Merchandise and sub∣mit
to us.</Q></P>
<P>But for all these Revilings <HI>Seva Gi</HI> makes them tremble here,
forgetting that twice their Safety has been owing to us, from falling
into the hands of that terrible Plunderer.</P>
<P>For all which the <HI>Mogul</HI> continues a double Poll on the Heathens
this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mogul</HI> in∣flicts a double Poll.</NOTE> and breaks down their Idolatrous Images where-ever he
finds them; whereupon the Heathens begin to Worship in Dens and
Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and solitary Places, being forbidden their open Celebrations.</P>
<P>In the heat of all these Combustions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seva Gi <HI>Dies.</HI></NOTE> the Firebrand <HI>Seva Gi</HI> is
called to pay the common Debt to Nature, he Expiring <HI>June</HI> 1.
1680. though after some time his Arms are carried on by his Son
<HI>Sambu Gi Raja,</HI> whose first care was to solemnize his Father's Exequies
with hellish and cruel Rites, after the barbarous Custom of these
Princes, to Burn all that were grateful to them when living, to at∣tend
them in the other state of Life; doubtless deriving it (which
is more than alluding to) from the ancient <HI>Getae,</HI> their first Parents,
and not theirs alone, but of all the World since the Deluge; who,
as <HI>Nich. Damascen</HI> reports, <HI>Tauri gens Scythica una cum Regibus mortuis
gratissimos quosque amicorum humare solent;</HI> and <HI>Solinus,</HI> as well as
<HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> says the same of their Wives, <HI>Funera Festa sunt, &amp;
veluti sacra cantu lusuque celebrantur, ne foeminis quidem segnis est ani∣mus,
super mortuorum virorum corpora interfici simulque sepeliri votum
eximium habent; &amp; quia plures simul singulis nuptoe sunt cujus id sit decus

<PB N="416" REF="228"/>
said to be slain and buried with their Husbands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter VII.</NOTE> is the same as to be
burned, since the Custom of burying also with their Husbands has
been before declared, and still is maintained to be put in execution
among these Heathen Princes. <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> while living, as he delignted
in Fire and Sword, so he was sent out of the World with a numerous
Company consumed in his Flames: Yet not such a Train as <HI>Raja
Jessinsin</HI> had when he died, which was far greater, being a more Po∣tent,
though less Barbarous <HI>Raja;</HI> but his Widow now holding out
against the <HI>Mogul,</HI> though his Prime Lady, being then big with
Child, was excused, and she still is preserved to bring up the Young
Prince, whom they own for their <HI>Raja.</HI></P>
<P>Thus these two great <HI>Rajas</HI> being disposed of by Fate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heats about Succession</NOTE> the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI>
seem to be under hatches (the <HI>Mogul</HI> for the present persecu∣ting
them with the utmost severity and hatred) and the rather, for
that the great Ministers of the deceased <HI>Seva Gi,</HI> were at variance
about the Promotion of the Successor: <HI>Anna Gi Pundit,</HI> Chief Mini∣ster
of State, setting up the Younger Son, and <HI>Morad Pundit</HI> decla∣ring
for <HI>Sambu Gi,</HI> the Eldest; who after punishing his Opposers,
was before the time fit for Expedition in the Low Countries, pro∣claimed
<HI>Maw Raja,</HI> or the lawful Heir to his Father's Conquests.</P>
<P>In this Interim the <HI>Mogul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Moguls</HI> Eldest Son sent to the <HI>Post.</HI></NOTE> jealous of his Eldest Son, had sent him
to the <HI>Joualar</HI> or <HI>Post;</HI> but the next being commanded from their
Kingdoms where they were fixed, the one <HI>Sultan Assum</HI> in <HI>Bengala,</HI>
the other <HI>Sultan Massum</HI> in <HI>Aurengabad,</HI> have refused to resign, and
stand upon defiance if they be farther moved; which Resentments
the Father must smother a while, having been twice out this Year
against the Infidels with a numerous Army, which have been as
often distressed by Famine, and forced to return without engaging;
the <HI>Rashpoots</HI> leading them into Straits, while they shift from Moun∣tain
to Mountain, and studiously avoid coming to blows.</P>
<P>The Emperor being returned to Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Withdraws his Army.</NOTE> makes much of his young∣est
Son, whom all give out he intends to raise to the Throne after his
Death, whose Name is <HI>Sultan Eckbar;</HI> but at present being wholly
bent on the Ruin and Extirpation of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> he forbears to no∣minate
him as yet.</P>
<P>And to weaken the Conspirators, has order'd the Governor of <HI>Ami∣davad</HI>
to join him, who being originally a <HI>Gentile,</HI> inclines to favour
the <HI>Ranna,</HI> seeking to deliver her from the Tricks of the Intriguing
Generals, who while she committed her Cause and her self to their
Instructions, had almost ruined her, pretending they would represent
her State to the Emperor in favour of her; who meaning nothing
less than to delude her (while she bribed well), bid her not be soli∣citous,
or take thought for her safety, till her chief City of <HI>Chetore</HI>
was surprized; wherefore <HI>Mahmud Emir Caun,</HI> being of the Juncto,
and privy to the Designs of the Court, discovers to the Emperor not
only how the Generals <HI>Badur Caun</HI> and others had been treating with
the <HI>Ranna,</HI> and that she was bought and sold by them, with the Mo∣ney
she had sent to the <HI>Mogul</HI> himself to purchase Peace, which they

about his Intention to make all the Heathen <HI>Musselmen;</HI> and told his
Chief Scrivan seriously one day, That he must lose his Place, unless
he would be of his Religion: To which the subtle Heathen replied,
<Q><HI>Sahab, (i. e.</HI>) Sir, why will you do more than the Creator ever
meant? You see hardly two Faces bear exactly the same Features:
Look farther into the World, and behold the variety of Creatures!
God has made Elephants, Tygres, Horses, Camels, Sheep, and Oxen,
of different Figures, and Man of a more exalted Composure than
the rest; whereas had the All-wise Disposer of Things thought it
convenient, he might have rested contented in one only Form;
but every one of these in their several Species glorifies their Maker:
And so it has pleased God to permit Variety of Religions, by which
Men worship and call upon him; nor can they go on in any one
against his Will, to which whatever is contrary cannot continue;
and till he make Men to be of one mind, in vain does any go about
to compel what he has ingrafted in their hearts.</Q> This rational
Discourse kept the <HI>Brachmin</HI> in his Office, but could not quite extin∣guish
his conceived Prejudice against their Superstitions.</P>
<P>Which he made appear, by giving Order to demolish all the Tem∣ples,
and deface the Pagods his Army had possessed themselves of in
<HI>Asmire,</HI> the Country of <HI>Raja Jessinsin;</HI> and chiefly <HI>Chetore</HI> felt in a
few days the Overthrow of what many years could not entirely fi∣nish,
most magnificent Marble Structures being levell'd to the ground,
and laid prostrate to his Rage and Fury: A Draught of which City is
her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inserted, being transmitted by an <HI>English</HI> Gunner in that Ser∣vice,
an Eye witness both of its Glory and Destruction. A Place
by Site invincible, had not the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Commanders Treachery
gained on the Faith of an easy Woman; who relying on their Me∣diation,
neglected the Means of her own Security, there being nei∣ther
Men nor Ammunition to oppose his Entry; whereupon they
left all open, and retreated in disorder from the approaching Foe, to
Places better provided, and inaccessible to any but those who are
acquainted with the Recesses: Sullying hereby the brave Provoca∣tion
that drew on her the Emperor's Arms; which she might have
prevented at first by a mean Compliance, or more nobly now by a
stout Resistance; rather than by a base Flight yield to the Will of a
devouring Enemy, which not only keeps fast hold by a sufficient
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ece, but does despite to their Altars, and lays waste their Coun∣try
Gods. This shews either want of Conduct, or an abject Spirit
in the <HI>Rashpoots,</HI> or at least an irresolute Temper in the <HI>Ranna,</HI> who
<PB N="418" REF="231"/>
did unadvisedly dare, when she was impotent, to maintain the
Challenge; or, which is worse, she foolishly applied her sell to the
Servants, when the Master was proud of her Fetters (she being a
Rare Creature): So that the ground of this Quarrel, however hy∣pocritically
gilded with an Holy War, is Love; as is demonstrable
from the kind Offers left with the Plenipotentiaries towards an Ac∣commodation;
unless the fordid and unfaithful humour of his <HI>Cauns</HI>
should prompt him to clap up a Peace, that he might be more at
leisure to ward himself, and free his Affairs from such corrupt Mini∣sters.
What the Cause is, (though unknown yet,) that his Forces
were withdrawn from following his good Fortune in the midst of
his Career against the Infidels, appears a Riddle; if it be not to car∣ry
on the Custom of this Empire, never to go through with any
Conquest.</P>

<P>At the same time Mr.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Set Sall for <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Rolt</HI> the late President took his Passage in
the <HI>Josiah:</HI> The Second of <HI>India,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chamberlane,</HI> in the <HI>Success</HI>
as I took mine in the <HI>Massenberg:</HI> Mr. <HI>John Child</HI> being removed
from the Government of <HI>Bombaim</HI> to the Presidency; which was
the <HI>19th.</HI> of <HI>January</HI> in the Year 1681-82.</P>
<P>Till the Twelfth of <HI>February</HI> we directed a Southern Course,
when about Two in the Morning the Moon suffered an Eclipse,
and in half an hours time was almost totally hid, which endured
till Four in the Morning: In Four or Five days after, about the
Seventh Degree of North Latitude, we met the Sun coming to∣wards
the North, and passed him to the Southward, when he
often raised Vapours from the Sea to thicken the Air, and obscure
his Face, which were as often poured down upon us, we having
here uncertain Weather, sometime wet, sometime calm, though
most an end, according to <HI>Varenius</HI>'s Position, the Winds hold
Easterly from the First of <HI>January</HI> till the End of <HI>July,</HI> as far as
Ascension, and then turn Westerly: We met hereabouts with a
Tree bestuck with Sea-Shells, which made us lie by a-nights for
fear of the Chango's.</P>
<P>And now dreadful Thunders cause the Sea to tremble,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Young Man lost Over-Board.</NOTE> and
Lightnings fly through the Heavens in frightful Flashes; by reason
of these alterations we went but slowly, being but Ten Degrees
Southward of the Sun on the First of <HI>March,</HI> when a South<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>East
Wind favoured us; with which sailing fortunately enough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
we were damped by a Mischance on one of our Young m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

perished, the Ship having fresh Way, and the Boats lying on
Board; they threw over several Planks and Vessels, but he made
no sign of contending with the Waves, or Motion to save himself:
Wherefore it was judged he had his bane against the Ships side, or
some Gun in his Fall before ever he came at the Water; and in
this hurry we were presently carried out of sight, so that he was
left for desperate, and given over as lost.</P>
<P>Before the Tenth of this Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We Sail on the Backside of S. <HI>Lawrence.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Brandon</HI> an Island on the East,
and <HI>Diego Rais</HI> to the South, were passed by; as also St. <HI>Maurice</HI>
kept lately by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for no other end but to prevent others
setling there; as <HI>Mascarenas,</HI> not far from it, by the <HI>French,</HI> for
the same reason. The day after the Sun was possessed of the <HI>Aequi∣no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
we made the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> from whence the <HI>Platonists</HI>
feign the Souls descend upon the Earth; but more truly it decla∣red
that we drew near the Coasts of <HI>Africa;</HI> for having hitherto
measured a Southern Way almost directly, we now incline towards
the West, having not more Meridional distance from <HI>Joanna</HI> than
Nine Degrees; but now we begin to bend our Course Westward,
which we should do in a strait Line, were it not for St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI>
the outside whereof our Navigators always pass by homeward bound,
it lying Twelve Degrees South, to Six and Twenty and an half,
which we suppose to be Three hundred Leagues West of us, though
here being a strong Current to the West, itmakes our Judgment
very unsteady; however to make the Cape, it is necessary to ele∣vate
our Longitude more than our Latitude, which we did till we
had made Fourteen Degrees West from our supposed Meridian of
<HI>Joanna,</HI> whereby we reckon our selves clear of the Island <HI>Madagas∣car,</HI>
or as the <HI>Portugals</HI> call it, St. <HI>Lawrence;</HI> when the East Wind
failed us, and the West blew hard upon us, contrary to the assertion
of the forementioned Author; the Winds, as we formerly Noted,
beyond the Tropicks being unaccountable, for that they observe
no Rule; and hereupon it happened we were so long beating about
the Cape, and had been much longer, had we not made for the
Shore; which we did about the middle of <HI>April,</HI> when it is high
Winter in these parts, wherein we tried all Weathers, the worst
of which were Calms, according to our <HI>English</HI> saying,
<Q><L>Worse is a Winters Calm,</L>
<L>By far than Summers Storm.</L></Q></P>
<P>Which we suffered till we got under the Shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We Weather the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI></NOTE> whence we were
assisted with fine Briezes, we falling first in with Cape <HI>d' Aguthas</HI>
the low Land being bare and naked, the high Land, a Ridge of
Mountains only gaping in one place, from which the <HI>Portugals</HI>
gave it the name <HI>d' Agutha,</HI> or of the Needles: Fifteen Miles North∣ward
of it lies the <HI>Promontory</HI> called <HI>Cape Falso,</HI> which we wea∣thered
in the Morning, and afore Night did the like to the Cape
of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> which in respect of the Heavenly Position is 34
Degrees and a half South Latitude, Longitude 47, in a strait Line
from <HI>Joanna</HI> 1800 Leagues. The Marks of this <HI>Promontory</HI> are
agreeable to <HI>Sellier</HI>'s Atlas: It is inhabited by a Barbarous People
<PB N="422" REF="233"/>
called <HI>Hottentots:</HI> As Nature designed their Looks deformed, so they
are untractable in Manners, and harsh in their Voice; these wind
the Guts of Beasts Excrements all about their Necks, both for
Food and Ornament, consenting to what <HI>Job Ludolphus,</HI> Author of
the <HI>Ethiopick Lexicon,</HI> relates of the <HI>Abassinians,</HI> under which Go∣vernment
(if any they have) this Region must be comprehend∣ed,
who says, they prefer the Meat digested in the Maws of Beasts,
before the best Sallads, supposing those Animals better at distin∣guishing
the good Plants from bad, than Men. Here in <HI>Soldania
Bay</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a strong Fort, for the same purpose we keep
St. <HI>Helena,</HI> to refresh and water our Fleet on their return home;
but these touch here both going and coming; whereas ours put in
at <HI>Joanna</HI> in their Voyage to <HI>India:</HI> In these Seas are the Sea-Calves,
and Sun-Fishes; the Nights are very cold, and the Days
are shortned near Two hours.</P>
<P>The end of <HI>April</HI> we lost sight of the high Tops of these Hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Land on St. <HI>Helena.</HI></NOTE>
and in thirty and two Degrees <HI>South,</HI> met with the stated <HI>South-east</HI>
Winds, when we left the Cape-Birds behind us, daily depressing our
<HI>Southern</HI> Latitude, directing our Course full <HI>North-west,</HI> being too
often retarded by frequent Calms, and sometimes contrary Winds,
(a thing not known between the Tropicks) till at last we made seven∣teen
Degrees <HI>South;</HI> when we altered our <HI>North</HI> Course to the <HI>West</HI>
only, for fear of out-sailing St. <HI>Helena;</HI> which is a thing full of ha∣zard
and difficulty, since the Season proved Cloudy, though not
Rainy, yet often so Dewy, that it wetted to the skin; the supputa∣tion
of the Longitude on which we depend, being no less obscure
than fallible: Besides, the Island its self is but a small Rock in the
middle of the Main Ocean, which cannot be seen far, unless in a
clear Day; but by the Grace of God, the 19<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> it lay fair be∣fore
our eyes like a little Cloud by eight in the Morning; from whence
are small White Birds floating sometimes on the Sea, at other times
taking their flight to and from the Island, which they stir not far
from: It is very high Land, and may be discerned twenty Leagues
off at Sea; wherefore we gained not the Harbour till Ten at Night,
where we silently let go our Anchor, neither we nor the Fort salu∣ting
one another till next Morning.</P>
<P>When going ashore, the Guns roared, and the Governor Mr. <HI>John
Blackmore</HI> received us on the Beech, which was stony and troublesome
ascending; we passed through Rows of Soldiers, called to their Arms
on this occasion, into a Valley surrounded with high Mountains,
except towards the Sea, where stood the Fort and Platform for the
great Cannon, which reach farther than there is any Anchor-hold,
so that no Ships can come in, or endure their Force, without their
Leave.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding which, it is yet fresh in memory, that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
landing on the backside of the Island, gained the Tops of the Hills,
and invading the Island, drove the <HI>English</HI> from their Fort, for all
they had two Ships in the Road at the same time, which did no
farther service than carry off the Inhabitants, leaving the <HI>Dutch</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Possession, till Captain <HI>Munday</HI> by the King's Command was sent out
to retake it that very Year we came out for <HI>India</HI> (which was the
<PB N="423" REF="233"/>
very Fleet that set out with us, and bore us company to St. <HI>Iago</HI>);
which the said Captain retook also by Surprize; and added to his
good fortune the seizing of Four of their <HI>East-India</HI> Ships richly
laden; which, after he had left sufficient Strength upon the Island,
he brought as Trophies of his Victory into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Island thus reduced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The story of the Island and Islanders.</NOTE> was governed immediately by the Royal
Commission, till at the Importunity of the Company, his Majesty
reinstated the former Colony planted by the Honourable Company,
and restored them to their first Possessions, advising them to be more
cautious for the future. It is seated in Sixteen Degrees <HI>South</HI> in
the vast <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, distant from Cape <HI>Bon Esperanzo</HI> Six hun∣dred
Leagues; placed opportunely for the <HI>English</HI> in their return to
<HI>Europe</HI> from the <HI>East Indies,</HI> both for Wood, Water, and fresh Pro∣visions;
which are comfortable Refreshments these long Voyages;
those Ships that miss it being in an ill state, ready to be eaten up
with the Scurvy, and most an end make for <HI>Barbados</HI> in their
distress; which makes the Company to be at some expence for this
benefit, supplying them with <HI>English</HI> Beeves, Cows, Hogs, Turkies,
Ducks, Geese, and all manner of Pullen, with Tools for Husban∣dry,
and a constant Guard of Soldiers. The <HI>Portugals</HI> first found
it out, as is said, by an unhappy Accident; one of their great Car∣racks
being cast away here, or not able to proceed farther, they
drew on shore her weather-beaten sides, and all the Armory and
Tacklin, Building with the Timber a Chappel in this Valley, from
thence called <HI>Chappel-Valley,</HI> and stocked it with Goats, Asses, Hogs,
and other Cattel, lest any other time they should be under the
same misfortune; but as their Credit fell in these parts, they grew
more careless of Futurity, and long since deserted it, that it became
free to the next comer to make his own; and now by the Industry
of the <HI>English</HI> it is much improved, yielding, partly by the good∣ness
of the Soil, and the care of the Husbandmen, all things neces∣sary
for human subsistence to its own Inhabitants, and to spare,
good Cheap to such as need.</P>
<P>Yet to whet their Diligence and Labour, here is a mischievous
Virmin sorely vexatious to them, which are Wild Rats, which in∣fest
all their Grounds, whereby they can have no Bread-Corn, they
destroying it all; instead whereof they have a large Root, very
biting when it is Raw, so that they will not touch it, but being Boi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed,
it is both nourishing and pleasing; and of this they make an in∣toxicating
Liquor, called <HI>Mobby;</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Name of this Root is
<HI>Yaum.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t is very troublesome clambering these Hills; yet to acquaint my
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the Country delights, I assayed it; at top it is something
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ener, where were many Rural Seats of the Planters, Cows grazing,
Goats seeding; their Cottages placed near Rivulets, whose next
Downfal hurried them into the Sea; from these advanced places we
discovered Two Sail making in hither, which is noticed by the
Firing of so many Guns and hoisting of the Flag, who proved to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Josiah,</HI> being an heavy Sailer, we lost Company about the <HI>Cape,</HI>
where keeping off at Sea, the <HI>Golden Fleece</HI> came up with it; upon
the Hills the Air makes a great difference from the Vallies, it being
<PB N="424" REF="234"/>
purer above, and something harsh by reason of the constant <HI>Easterly</HI>
Blasts, which is not so kind to the Fruits on the Mountains as in the
Dales.</P>
<P>The course taken to People the Island is this; they indent either
as Servants or Soldiers for Five Years with the Company, at the ex∣piration
of which Term, they are free either to go or stay; if they
stay, they have liberty to chuse Twenty Acres of Ground unoccu∣pied,
as their own proper Portion, on which they live and maintain
themselves and Families; of which Islanders there may be Four
hundred <HI>English,</HI> reckoning Men, Women, and Children.</P>

Sail for <HI>Ascension,</HI> another meer Wart in the Sea, being a Barren

burnt by the Sun, and incrusted by the filth and slime of the
Sea-Fowl, who both Nest and Roost here: Here is no covering or
shade from the Heavens, more than the Holes or Tops of Rocks, no
Turf nor Grass, but all is scorched by the Sun's heat; and here I ap∣prove,
rather than consent to the general Opinion, of its having been
once a <HI>Vulcano,</HI> or Island of Fire; but since no such matters appear
for such a subject, I shall deem it Fabulous, since it would be altoge∣ther
strange, had it e'er been so, that no Footsteps of Bitumen, Sulphur,
or Combustible substance should remain, which most an end flow
from an unexhausted Fountain, bred as fast as the Fire can feed up∣on
it; otherwise those ancient Fiery Mountains in <HI>Italy,</HI> and else∣where,
had many Ages since been consumed; and we might have
admired them as Poets Fictions handed by Tradition, but not have
had ocular Demonstration to convince the incredulous: Besides,
the continual confluence of Flocks of Water-Fowl declare they ne∣ver
feared Smoak or Fire here; they having paved or pargetted the
whole Rock with their Filth, that it seems incorporated with it.</P>
<P>These Birds are so heedless or fool-hardy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foolish Birds.</NOTE> which I cannot tell, that
they will fly so near as to be struck down with a Cane.</P>
<P>When I went to Land (if such it may be called) bating the
Sands around the Rocks, we could tread no other Ground but on
Stones cemented by the Sun's heat; all the advantage or pleasure
proposed was to stretch our Legs, and see the Seamen turn the Tur∣tles,
or Tortoises, which they did anights when they came ashoar
to lay their Eggs, which these Sands hatch, they lying in ambush be∣twixt
them and the Sea, and with Hand-spikes casting them on their
Back; at which they must be yare; for they perceiving themselves
pursued, make towards the Sea, and cast a cloud of Sand upon the
Assailants with their Feet or Claws; they are very big, and some∣times
as much as Three or Four Men can do to lay them sprawling,
where as fast as one is conquered they leave it to master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;
for they cannot rescue themselves out of that posture; so that
what they serve thus in the Night they are sure to find them in
the Day where they left them, and so bring them aboard Ship for
their fresh Food, the Flesh of some being as much as our little <HI>Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
Bullocks.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="234"/>
Of these (we gathering for the Four Ships that were behind) to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no time, they turned One hundred and twenty, whereof
Eight and twenty came to our share; which (without any other
sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stence than three or four times a day throwing Sea-water on
them) we kept alive above a Month, on which the Ship's Crew
fed daily with great eagerness while they lasted, dressing their Flesh se∣veral
ways; and besides that, these are reckoned the best in the World,
and to which they fall the more greedily, because they are esteemed
specifical for the Scurvy, Pox, or Gout, they fancying their whole Mass
of Blood to be altered by them, and their Flesh to become new and
sound again; and this Opinion takes the rather, because through all
the Emunctuaries, and especially near the Genitals, they see the
col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of their Sweat altered to a nasty yellow Green: And indeed
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peak the truth, whether Fancy or real virtue in this sort of
Dyet be the cause, they continue healthy and lively while they feed
thereon, and will mightily lament the want of it when spent, be∣cause
they must return again to their salt Meats.</P>
<P>In catching of these we tarried five Days, in which I had time
enough to recollect my Thoughts about these Creatures; but ha∣ving
already been particular thereon, I shall forbear to add more:
Only the Custom of this place is to leave Letters of what Ships have
been here, in a great Hollow of a Rock, sealed in a Glass Bottle;
and where the <HI>Portugals</HI> have erected a Wooden Cross to affix

the North-East Winds; which was the Twelfth of <HI>July</HI> before we
