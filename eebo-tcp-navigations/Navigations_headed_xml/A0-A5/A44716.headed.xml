<P>I Should be much wanting to my self, and to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> obligation of Duty, the Law of God, and his <HI>Handmaid</HI> Nature hath imposed upon me, if I should not acquaint you with the course and qua∣lity of my affairs and fortunes, specially at this time, that I am upon point of erossing the Seas to eat my bread abroad. Nor is it the common relation of a Son that only induc'd me hereunto, but that most indulgent and costly Care you have been pleased (in so extraordinary a manner) to have had of my breeding (though but one child of <HI>fifteen</HI>) by placing me in a choice me∣thodicall <HI>School</HI> (so far distant from your dwelling) under a lear∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed (though <HI>lashing</HI>) Master; and by transplanting me thence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>o <HI>Oxford,</HI> to be graduated; and so holding me still up by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hin, untill I could swim without Bladders. This Patrimony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>f liberall Education you have been Pleased to endow me withal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> now carry along with me abroad, as a sure inseparable Tre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ure; nor do I feel it any burden or encumbrance unto me at all: And what danger soever my person, or other things I have about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e, do incur, yet I do not fear the losing of this, either by Ship∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rack or Pyrats at Sea, nor by Robbers, or Fire, or any other Casualty ashore: And at my return to <HI>England,</HI> I hope, at leastw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> shall do my endeavour, that you may finde this Patrimony im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>roved somewhat to your comfort.</P>
<P>The main of my employment, is from that gallant Knight Sir <HI>Robert Mansell,</HI> who, with my Lord of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> and divers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ther of the prime Lords of the Court, have got the sole Patent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>f making all sorts of Glass with Pit-cole, onely to save those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>uge proportions of Wood which were consumed formerly in the Glasse Furnaces: And this Business being of that nature, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e Workmen are to be had from <HI>Italy,</HI> and the chief Mate∣rials from <HI>Spain, France,</HI> and other Forren Countries, there is need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>f an Agent abroad for this use; (and better then I have offered

their service in this kind) so that I believe I shall have Employ∣ment in all these Countreys, before I return.</P>
<P>Had I continued still Steward of the Glasse-house in Broad∣street, where Captain <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> hath succeeded me, I should in a short time have melted away to nothing, amongst those hot <HI>Venetians,</HI> finding my self too green for such a Charge; therefore it hath pleased God to dispose of me now to a Condition more su∣table to my yeers, and that will, I hope, prove more advantagious to my future Fortunes.</P>
<P>In this my Peregrination, if I happen, by some accident, to be disappointed of that allowance I am to subsist by, I must make my addresse to you, for I have no other Rendevous to flee unto; but it shall not be, unlesse in case of great indigence.</P>

<P>I Could not shake hands with <HI>England,</HI> without kissing your hands also: and because, in regard of your distance now from <HI>London,</HI> I cannot do it in person, I send this paper for my depu∣ty.</P>
<P>The News that keeps greatest noise here now, is the return of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> from his myne of Gold in <HI>Guiana</HI> the South parts of <HI>America,</HI> which at first was like to be such a hopeful boon Voyage, but it seems that that golden myne is proved a meer <HI>Chymer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> an imaginary ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y myne; and indeed, his Majestie had never any other conceipt of it: But what will not one in Cap∣tivity (as Sir <HI>Walter</HI> was) promise, to regain his Freedom? who would not promise not onely mynes, but mountains of Gold, for Liberty? &amp; tis pity such a knowing well-weigh'd Knight had not had a better Fortune; for the <HI>Destiny</HI> (I mean that brave Ship which he built himself of that name, that carried him thither) is like to prove a <HI>fatall</HI> Destiny to him, and to some of the rest of those gal∣lant Adventurers which contributed for the setting forth of thir∣teen Ships more, who were most of them his kinsmen and young∣er brothers, being led into the said Expedition by a generall con∣ceipt the world had of the wisedom of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh;</HI> and many of these are like to make <HI>Shipwrack</HI> of their estates by this
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
Voyage. Sir <HI>Walter</HI> landed at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> whence he thought to make an escape; and some say he hath tampered with his body by Phisick, to make him look sickly, that he may be the more pitied, and permitted to lie in his own house. Count <HI>Gondamar</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador speaks high language, and sending lately to desire Audience of his Majestie, he said he had but one word to tell him, his Majestie wondring what might be delivered in one word; when he came before him, he said onely, <HI>Pyrats, Pyrats, Pyrats,</HI> and so departed.</P>
<P>Tis true that he protested against this Voyage before, and that it could not be but for some praedatory designe: And that if it be as I hear, I fear it will go very ill with Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> and that <HI>Gon∣damar</HI> will never give him over, till he hath his head off his shoul∣ders; which may quickly be done, without any new Arraignment, by vertue of the old Sentence that lies still dormant against him, which he could never get off by Pardon, notwithstanding that he mainly laboured in it before he went; but his Majestie could ne∣ver be brought to it, for he said he would keep this as a Curb to hold him within the bounds of his Commission, and the good be∣haviour.</P>
<P><HI>Gondamar</HI> cryes out, that he hath broke the sacred Peace twixt the two Kingdoms, That he hath fired and plundered <HI>santo Thoma</HI> a Colony the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had planted with so much blood, neer under the <HI>Line,</HI> which made it prove such a hot service unto him, and where, besides others, he lost his eldest son in the Action; and could they have preserved the Magazin of <HI>Tobacco</HI> onely, be∣sides other things in that Town, something mought have bin had to countervail the charge of the Voyage. <HI>Gondamar</HI> alleadgeth further, that the enterprise of the myne failing, he propounded to the rest of his Fleet to go and intercept some of the Plate-Ga∣leons, with other Designes which would have drawn after them apparent acts of Hostility, and so demands Justice: besides other disasters which fell out upon the dashing of the first designe, Cap∣tain <HI>Remish,</HI> who was the main Instrument for discovery of the myne, pistol'd himself in a desperate mood of discontent in his Cabin, in the <HI>Convertine.</HI></P>
<P>This return of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> from <HI>Guiana,</HI> puts me in minde of a facetious tale I read lately in <HI>Italian</HI> (for I have a little of that Language already) how <HI>Alphonso</HI> King of <HI>Naples</HI> sent a <HI>Moor</HI> who had been his Captive a long time, to <HI>Barbary,</HI> with a consider∣able sum of money to buy horses, and to return by such a time.
<PB N="8" REF="17" MS="y"/>
Now there was about the King a kinde of <HI>Buff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n</HI> or Jester who had a Table-book, or Journall, wherein he was used to register any absurdity, or impertinence, or merry passage that happened about the Court. That day the <HI>Moor</HI> was dispatched for <HI>Barbary,</HI> the said Jester waiting upon the King at supper, the King call'd for his Journall, and askt what he had observed that day: thereupon he produced his Table-book, and amongst other things, he read how <HI>Alphons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> King of <HI>Naples</HI> had sent <HI>Beltran</HI> the <HI>Moor,</HI> who had been a long time his Prisoner, to <HI>Morocco</HI> (his own Countrey) with so many thousand Crowns, to buy horses. The King asked him why he inserted that: Because, said he, I think he will ne∣ver come back to be a Prisoner again, and so you have lost both man and money. But if he do come, then your Jest is marr'd, quoth the King: No Sir; <HI>for if he return I will blot out your name, and put him in for a</HI> Fool.</P>
<P>The Application is easie and obvious: But the world wonders extremely, that so great a wise man as Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> would return to cast himself upon so inevitable a Rock, as I fear he will; and much more, that such choice men, and so great a Power of Ships, should all come home, and do nothing.</P>
<P>The Letter you sent to my Father, I conveyed safely the last week to <HI>Wales.</HI> I am this week, by Gods help, for the <HI>Nether∣lands,</HI> and then I think for <HI>France.</HI> If in this my forren employ∣ment I may be any way serviceable unto you, you know what pow∣er you have to dispose of me; for I honor you in a very high de∣gree, and will live and die,</P>

<P>I Have made your friendship so necessary unto me, for the con∣tentment of my life, that happinesse it self would be but a kind of infelicity without it: It is as needfull to me, as Fire and Water, as the very Air I take in, and breath out; it is to me not onely <HI>neoessitudo,</HI> but <HI>necessitas:</HI> Therefore I pray let me injoy it in that fair proportion, that I desire to return unto you, by way of corre∣spondencee and retaliation- Our first ligue of love, you know, was contracted among the Muses in <HI>Oxford;</HI> for no sooner was I <HI>matriculated</HI> to her, but I was <HI>adopted</HI> to you; I became her <HI>son,</HI> and your <HI>friend,</HI> at one time: You know I followed you then to <HI>London,</HI> where our love received <HI>confirmation</HI> in the <HI>Temple,</HI> and else-where. We are now far asunder, for no lesse then a Sea se∣vers us, and that no narrow one, but the <HI>German</HI> Ocean: <HI>Di∣stance sometimes endear's friendship, and absence sweetneth it, it much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the value of it, and makes it more precious:</HI> Let this be ve∣rified
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
in us, Let that love which formerly used to be nourished by personall communication, and the Lips, be now fed by Letters; let the Pen supply the Office of the Toung: Letters have a strong operation, they have a kind of art like embraces to mingle souls, and make them meet though millions of paces asunder; by them we may converse and know how it fares with each other, as it were by entercours of spirits. Therefore amongst your civill speculations, I pray let your thoughts sometimes reflect off me (your absent self) and wrap those thoughts in Paper, and so send them me over: I promise you they shall be very welcome, I shall embrace and hug them with my best affections.</P>
<P>Commend me to <HI>Tom Bowyer,</HI> and enjoyn him the like: I pray be no niggard in distributing my love plentifully amongst our friends at the Innes of Court; Let <HI>Iack Toldervy</HI> have my kind commends with this caveat, <HI>That the Pot which goes often to the water, comes home crack'd at last;</HI> therefore I hope he will be care∣full how he makes the <HI>Fleece</HI> in <HI>Cornhill</HI> his thorowfare too often.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am lately arrived in <HI>Holland</HI> in a good plight of health, and continue yet in this Town of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> a Town I beleeve, that there are few her fellows, being from a mean Fishing Dorp, come in a short revolution of time, by a monstrous encrease of Comerce and Navigation, to be one of the greatest Marts of <HI>Eu∣rop:</HI> Tis admirable to see what various sorts of Buildings, and new Fabrics, are now here erecting every where; not in houses onely, but in whole Streets and Suburbs; so that tis thought she will in a short time double her proportion in bigness.</P>
<P>I am lodg'd in a <HI>French-mans</HI> house, who is one of the Deacons of our <HI>English Brownists</HI> Church here; 'tis not far from the <HI>Syna∣gog</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
of <HI>Iews,</HI> who have free and open exercise of their Religion here: I beleeve in this Street where I lodg, ther be well near as many Religions as there be houses; for one Neighbour knows not, nor cares not much, what Religion the other is of, so that the number of Conventicles exceeds the number of Churches here. And let this Countrey call it self as long as it will, the <HI>united</HI> Provinces one way, I am perswaded in this point, there's no place so <HI>Disunited.</HI></P>
<P>The Dog and Rag Market is hard by, where every Sunday morning there is a kind of public Mart for those commodities, notwithstanding their precise observance of the Sabbath.</P>
<P>Upon Saturday last I hapned to be in a Gentlemans company, who shew'd me as I walk'd along in the Streets, along Bearded old <HI>Iew</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Aaron;</HI> when the other <HI>Iews</HI> met him, they fell down and kiss'd his Foot: This was that Rabbi, with whom our Countrey-man <HI>Broughton</HI> had such a dispute.</P>
<P>This City, notwithstanding her huge Trade, is far inferiour to <HI>London</HI> for populousnes; and this I infer out of their weekly Bills of Mortalitie, which come not at most but to fifty or thereabout; whereas in <HI>London,</HI> the ordinary number is twixt two and three hundred, one week with another: Nor are there such Wealthy∣men in this Town as in <HI>London;</HI> for by reason of the generality of Commerce, the Banks, Adventures, the Common shares and stocks which most have in the <HI>Indian</HI> and other Companies, the Wealth doth'diffuse it self here in a strange kind of equality, not one of the Bourgers being exceeding rich or exceeding poor; Insomuch, that I beleeve our four and twenty Aldermen, may buy a hundred of the richest men in <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> It is a rare thing to meet with a Begger here, as rare, as to see a Horse, they say, upon the Streets of <HI>Venice,</HI> &amp; this is held to be one of their best peeces of Government; for besides the strictnes of their Laws against Mendicants, they have Hospitals of all sorts for young and'old, both for the relief of the one and the employment of the other; so that there is no object here to exercise any act of cha∣rity upon. They are here very neat, though not so magnificent in their Buildings, specially in their Frontispices, and first Rooms; and for cleanlines, they may serve for a pattern to all People. They will presently dresse half a dozen Dishes of Meat, without any noise or shew at all; for if one goes to the Kitchin, ther will he scarce apparance of any thing, but a few covered Pots upon a Turf-fire, which is their prime fuell; after dinner they fall a
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
scowring of those Pots▪ so that the outside will be as bright <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the inside, and the Kitchin suddenly so clean, as if no meat had bin dress'd there a month before: They have nei∣ther Well or Fountain, or any Spring of Fresh-water, in, or about all this City, but their Fresh-water is brought unto them by Boats; besides they have Cesterns to receive the Rain-water, which they much use: So that my Laundresse bringing my Lin∣nen to me one day, and I commending the Whitenesse of them, she answered, That they must needs be White and Fair, for they were washed in <HI>Aqua Coelestis,</HI> meaning Skie-water.</P>
<P>Twere cheap living here, were it not for the monstrous Accises which are impos'd upon all sorts of Commodities, both for Belly and Back; for the Retailer payes the <HI>States</HI> almost the one Moity as much as he payed for the Commodity at first, nor doth any murmur at it, because it goes not to any Favourit, or private Purse, but to preserve them from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> their common Enemy as they term him; so that the saying is truely verified here, <HI>Desend me, and spend me:</HI> With this Accise principally, they maintain all their Armies by Sea and Land, with their Garrisons at home and abroad, both here, and in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and defray all other public charges besides.</P>
<P>I shall hence shortly for <HI>France,</HI> and in my way take most of the prime Towns of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> specially <HI>Leyden</HI> (the Uni∣versity) where I shall sojourn some days. So humbly craving a continuance of your Blessing and Prayers, I rest</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is the Royall Prerogative of Love, not to be confined to that small Locall compasse which circumscribes the Body, but to make his Sallies, and Progresses abroad, to find out, and enjoy his desired object, under what Region soever: Nor is it the vast Gulph of <HI>Neptun,</HI> or any distance of place, or difference of Clime, can bar him of this priviledge▪ I never found the experiment here∣of, so sensibly, nor felt the comfort of it so much, as since I shook hands with <HI>England:</HI> For though you be in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and I at <HI>Leyden,</HI> albeit you be upon an Island, and I now upon the Conti∣nent, (though the lowest part of <HI>Europ</HI>) yet those swift Postillions my <HI>thoughts</HI> find you out daily, and bring you unto me: I be∣hold you often in my Chamber, and in my Bed; you eat, you drink, you sit down, and walk with me▪ and my fantasie enjoyes you often in my sleep, when all my sences are lock'd up, and my soul wanders up and down the World, sometimes through plea∣sant Fields and Gardens, sometimes through odd uncouth places, over Mountains and broken confused Buildings. As my love to you doth thus exercise his power, so I desire yours to me may not be idle, but rows'd up sometimes to find me out, and summon me to attend you in <HI>Iesus</HI> Colledge.</P>
<P>I am now here in <HI>Leyden,</HI> the onely Academy besides <HI>Franiker</HI> of all the <HI>United</HI> Provinces: Here are Nations of all sorts, but the <HI>Germans</HI> swarr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> more then any: To compare their <HI>University</HI> to yours, were to cast <HI>New-Inne</HI> in counterscale with <HI>Christ-Church</HI> Colledge, or the Alms Houses on <HI>Tower Hill</HI> to <HI>Suttons</HI> Hospitall.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough you be now a good way out of my reach, yet you are not out of my remembrance; you are still within the Hori∣zon of my Love: Now the Horizon of Love is large and spaci∣ous, it is as boundlesse, as that of the imagination; and where the imagination rangeth, the memory is still busie to usher in, and present the desired object it fixeth upon: it is <HI>love</HI> that sets them both on work, and may be said to be the highest sphear whence they receive their motion.

<P>I desire to know how you like <HI>Ployden;</HI> I heard it often said, That ther is no study requires patience and constancy more then the Common-Law, for it is a good while before one comes to any known perfection in it, and consequently to any gainfull prac∣tise.

<P>THe same observance that a Father may challenge of his child, the like you may claim of me, in regard of the extraor∣dinary care you have bin pleas'd to have alwayes, since I had the happines to know you, of the cours of my Fortunes.</P>
<P>I am now newly come to the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Court of the six (and almost seven) <HI>confederated</HI> Provinces; the Counsell of State with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> makes his firm Residence here, unlesse he be upon a march, and in motion for some design abroad. This Prince (<HI>Maurice</HI>) was cast in a mould▪ suitable to the temper of this peo∣ple: he is slow and full of warines, and not without a mixture of fear, I do not mean a pusillanimous, but politic fear: he is the most constant in the quotidian cours and carriage of his life, of any that J have ever heard or read of; for whosoever knows the customs of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> may tell what he is a doing here evry hour of the day, though he be in <HI>Constantinople.</HI> In the morning he awaketh about six in Sommer, and seven in Winter; the first thing he doth, he sends one of his Grooms or Pages, to see how the wind sits, and he wears or leaves off his Wascot accordingly, then he is about an hour dressing himself, and about a quarter of an hour in his Closet, then comes in the Secretary, and if he hath any privat or public Letters to write, or any other dispatches to make, he doth it before he stirs from his Chamber; then comes he abroad, and goes to his Stables if it be no Sermon day, to see some of his Gentlemen or Pages (of whose breeding he is very carefull) ride the great Horse: He is very accessible to any that hath busines with him, and sheweth a winning kind of familiari∣ty, for he will shake hands with the meanest Boor of the Coun∣trey, and he seldom hears any Commander or Gentleman with his Hat on: He dines punctually about twelve, and his Table is free for all comers, but none under the degree of a Captain useth to sit down at it; after dinner he stayes in the Room a good while, and then any one may accost him, and tell his tale; then he re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>res to his Chamber, where he answers all <HI>Petitions</HI> that were de∣livered

him in the Morning, and towards the Evening, if he goes not to Counsell, which is seldome; he goes either to make some visits, or to take the Air abroad, and according to this constant method he passeth his life.</P>
<P>Ther are great stirs like to arise twixt the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> and their elected King the Emperour, and they are com already to that height, that they consult of deposing him, and to chuse some Pro∣testant Prince to be their King, som talk of the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> others of the <HI>Palsgrave:</HI> J beleeve the States here, would rather be for the latter, in regard of conformity of Religion, the other being a <HI>Lutheran.</HI></P>

<P>I pray when you write next, to sond me a dozen pair of the best White Kidskin Gloves, the <HI>Royall-Exchange</HI> can afford; as also two pair of the purest White Wosted Stockins you can get of Women size, together with half a dozen pair of Knifs.

When I go to <HI>Paris,</HI> I shall send you som curiosities, equivalent to these; I have here inclos'd re∣turn'd an answer to those two that came in yours, I pray see them safely delivered. My kind respects to your Brother <HI>Sergeant</HI> at Court, to all at <HI>Batter say,</HI>' or any wher else, wher you think my Commendations may be well plac'd.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOurs of the third of <HI>August,</HI> came to safe hand in an inclos'd from my Brother; you may make easie conjecture how wel∣com it was unto me, and to what a height of comfort it rais'd my spirits, in regard it was the first I received from you, since I cross'd the Seas; I humbly thank you for the blessing you sent along with it.</P>
<P>I am now upon the fair Continent of <HI>France,</HI> One of Natures choicest Master-peeces; one of <HI>Ceres</HI> chiefest Barns for Corn; one of <HI>Bacchus</HI> prime Wine-Cellars, and of <HI>Neptu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s</HI> best Salt-Pits; a compleat self-sufficient Countrey, wher ther is rather a super∣fluity, then defect of any thing, either for necessity or pleasure, did <HI>the policie of the Countrey correspond with the bounty of Nature, in the equall distribution of the Wealth amongst the Inhabitants;</HI> for I think there is not upon the Earth, a richer Countrey, and poorer peeple. Tis true, <HI>England</HI> hath a good repute abroad for her fer∣tility, yet be our Harvests never so kindly, and our Crops never so plentifull, we have evry yeer commonly som Grain from hence, or from <HI>Danzic,</HI> and other places imported by the Marchant: Besides, ther be many more Heaths, Commons, Bleak-b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rren-Hills, and waste Grounds in <HI>England,</HI> by many degrees, then I find here; and I am sorry <HI>our</HI> Countrey of <HI>Wales,</HI> should give more instances hereof, then any other part.</P>
<P>This Province of <HI>Normandy,</HI> once an <HI>Appendix</HI> of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> though it want Wine, yet it yeelds the King as much desmeans as any one of the rest: The lower <HI>Norman</HI> hath <HI>Syder</HI> for his common drink; and I visibly observ'd, that they are more plump and replet in their bodies, and of a clearer complexion then those that drink altogether Wine. In this great City of
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
<HI>Roüen</HI> ther be many Monuments of the <HI>English</HI> Nation yet extant. In the outside of the highest Steeple of the great Church ther is the word <HI>GOD</HI> engraven in huge Golden Characters, evry one almost as long as my self, to make them the more visible. In this Steeple hangs also the greatest Bell of Christendom, call'd d'<HI>Am∣boise;</HI> for it weighs neer upon▪ fourty thousand pound weight. Ther is also here Saint <HI>Oen,</HI> the greatest Sanctuary in the Citie, founded by one of our Compatriots, as the name imports: This Province is also subject to <HI>Wardships,</HI> and no other part of <HI>France</HI> besides; but whither the Conqueror transported that Law to <HI>England</HI> from hence, or whither he sent it over from <HI>England</HI> hi∣ther, I cannot resolve you. Ther is a marvailous quick trade beaten in this Town, because of the great Navigable River <HI>Sequana</HI> (the Seine) that runs hence to <HI>Paris,</HI> wheron ther stands a strange Bridge that ebbs and flows, that riseth and fall's with the River, it being made of Boats, whereon Coach, and Carts may passe over as well as men: Besides, this is the neerest Mercantil City that stands twixt <HI>Paris</HI> and the Sea.</P>
<P>My last unto you was from the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI> wher I was in motion to and fro above four months; but I fear it miscarried in regard you make no mention of it in yours.</P>
<P>I begin more and more to have a sense of the sweetnes, and advantage of forren Travell: I pray when you com to <HI>London,</HI> to find a time to visit Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> and acknowledge his great fa∣vours unto me, and desire a continuance thereof, according as I shall endeavour to deserve them. So with my due and daily Prayers for your health, and a speedy successefull issue of all your Law-businesses, I humbly crave your blessing, and rest.</P>

<P>I Received two of yours in <HI>Roüen</HI> with the Bills of Exchange, ther inclos'd, and according to your directions I sent you those things which you wrote for.</P>
<P>I am now newly com to <HI>Paris,</HI> this huge Magazin of men, the Epitome of this large populous Kingdom, and rendevouz of all Forreners. The structures here are indifferently fair, though the Streets generally foul all the four Seasons of the yeer, which I impute first to the Position of the Citie being built upon an Isle (the Isle of <HI>France,</HI> made so by the branching and serpentin cours of the River of <HI>Seine</HI>) and having som of her Suburbs seated high, the filth runs down the Channell, and settles in many places within the body of the Citie, which lieth upon a flat; as also for a world of Coaches, Carts, and Horses of all sorts that go to and fro perpetually, so that somtimes one shall meet with a stop half a mile long of those Coaches, Carts, and Horses, that can move neither forward nor backward by reason of some sudden encoun∣ter of others coming a crosse-way; so that oftentimes it will be an hour or two before they can dis-intangle: In such a stop the great <HI>Henry</HI> was so fatally slain by <HI>Ravillac.</HI> Hence comes it to passe, that this Town (for <HI>Paris</HI> is a <HI>Town,</HI> a <HI>City,</HI> and an <HI>univer∣sity</HI>) is alwayes dirty, and 'tis such a dirt, that by perpetual mo∣tion is beaten into such a thick black onctious Oyl, that wher it sticks, no art can wash it off of some colours, insomuch, that it may be no improper comparison to say, That an ill name is like the <HI>Crot</HI> (the dirt) of <HI>Paris,</HI> which is indelible; besides the stain this dirt leaves, it gives also so strong a sent, that it may be smelt many miles off, if the wind be in ones face as he comes from the fresh Air of the Countrey: This may be▪ one cause why the Plague is alwayes in som corner or other of this vast Citie, which may be call'd as once <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ythia</HI> was <HI>Vagina Populorum,</HI> or (as mankind was call'd by a great Philosopher) a great Mole-hill of Ants: Yet I believe this Citie is not so populous as she seems to be, for her form being round (as the whole Kingdom is) the Passengers wheel about, and meet oftner then they use to do in the long

continued Streets of <HI>London,</HI> which makes <HI>London</HI> appear lesse po∣pulous then she is indeed; so that <HI>London</HI> for length (though not for latitude) including <HI>Westminster,</HI> exceeds <HI>Paris,</HI> and hath in <HI>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hnelmas</HI> Term more souls moving within her in all places.

<P>I am lodg'd here hard by the <HI>Bastile,</HI> because it is furthest off from those places where the <HI>English</HI> resort; for I would go on to get a little Language as soon as I could.

<P>LOve is the marrow of Friendship, and Letters are the Elixir of Love; they are the best fuell of affection, and cast a sweeter <HI>odour</HI> then any Frankincense can do; such an <HI>odour,</HI> such an <HI>A∣romatic</HI> perfume your late <HI>Letter</HI> brought with it, proceeding from the fragrancy of those dainty Flowers of eloquence, which I found

blossoming as it were in every Line; I mean those sweet expres∣sions of Love and Wit, which in every period were intermingled with so much Art, that they seem'd to contend for mastery which was the strongest: I must confesse, that you put me to hard shifto to correspond with you in such exquisit strains and raptures of <HI>Love,</HI> which were so lively, that I must needs judg them to pro∣ceed from the motions, from the <HI>Diastole</HI> and <HI>Systole</HI> of a Heart truly affected; certainly your heart did dictat every syllable you writ, and guided your hand all along: Sir, give me leave to tell you, that not a dram, nor a doze, not a scruple of this pretious <HI>love</HI> of yours is lost, but it is safely tresur'd up in my Brest, and an∣swer'd in like proportion to the full, mine to you is as cordiall, it is passionat and perfect, as <HI>love</HI> can be.</P>
<P>I thank you for the desire you have to know how it fares with me abroad; I thank God I am perfectly well, and well contented with this wandring cours of life a while, I never enjoyed my health better, but I was like to endanger it two nights ago; for being in som joviall company abroad, and coming late to our lodging, we were suddenly surprized by a crue of <HI>Filous</HI> of night Rogues, who drew upon us, and as we had exchang'd some blow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, it pleas'd God, the <HI>Chevatieur de Guet,</HI> an Officer, who goe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> up and down the Streets all night a horseback to prevent disorders, pass'd by, and so rescued us; but <HI>Iack White</HI> was hurt, and I had two thrusts in my Clock.

one had a paper in his hand, which he said, he had casually took up in the streets, and the difference between them was about that Paper; therefore they desir'd the Secretary to read it, with a great deal of complement, the Secretary took out his spectacles, and fell a reading of the said Paper, whereof the substance was, <HI>That it should be known to all men, that whosoever did passe over that Bridge after nine a Clock at night in Winter, and ten in Summer, was to leave his Cloak behind him, and in case of no Cloak, his Hat.</HI> The Secretary starting at this, one of the Camerades told him; That he thought that Paper concern'd him, so they unmantled him of a new Plush Cloak, and my Secretary was content to go home quietly, and <HI>en Cuerpo.</HI> This makes me think often, of the excel∣lent Nocturnall Government of our City of <HI>London,</HI> wher one may passe and repasse securely all hours of the night, if he give good words to the Watch.

<P>I Am to set forward this week for <HI>Spain,</HI> and if I can find no com∣modity of embarcation at Saint <HI>Malos,</HI> I must be forc'd to jour∣ney it all the way by Land, and clammer up the huge <HI>Pyreney∣hills,</HI> but I could not bid <HI>Paris</HI> adieu, till I had conveyed my true and constant respects to you by this Letter. I was yesterday to wait upon Sir <HI>Herbert Croft</HI> at Saint <HI>Germains,</HI> where I met with a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, who amongst other curiosities, which he pleased to shew me up and down <HI>Paris,</HI> brought me to that place where the late King was slain, and to that wher the Marquis of <HI>Ancre</HI> was shot, and so made me a punctuall relation of all the circumstances of those two acts; which in regard they were rare, and I beleeve two of the notablest Accidents that ever happen'd in <HI>France,</HI> I thought it worth the labour to make you partaker of som part of his discours.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> as all Christendom besides (for ther was then a truce twixt <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Hollander</HI>) was in a profound Peace, and had continued so twenty yeers together, when <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth fell upon some great Martiall design, the bottome whereof is not known to this day; and being rich (for he had heap'd up in the <HI>Bastile</HI> a mount of Gold that was as high as a Lance) he levied a huge Army of 40000 men, whence came the Song, <HI>The King of France with fourty thousand men,</HI> and upon a sudden he put this Army in perfect equippage, and some say he invited our Prince <HI>Henry</HI> to come unto him to be a sharer in his exploits: But going one afternoon to the <HI>Bastile,</HI> to see his Tresure and Ammunition, his Coach stopp'd suddenly, by reason of some Colliers and o∣ther Carts that were in that narrow street; whereupon one <HI>Ra∣villac</HI> a lay Jesuit (who had a whole twelve month watch'd an op∣portunity to do the act) put his foot boldly upon one of the wheels of the Coach, and with a long Knife stretch'd himself over their shoulders who were in the Boot of the Coach, and reach'd the King at the end, and stab'd him right in the left side to the heart, and pulling out the fatall Steel, he doubled his thrust; the
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
King with a ruthfull voice cryed out, <HI>Ie suis blesse</HI> (I am hurr) and suddenly the bloud issued at his mouth: The Regicide villain was apprehended, and command given, that no violence should be offered him, that he might be reserv'd for the law, and som exquisit torture. The Queen grew half distracted hereupon, who had been crown'd Queen of <HI>France</HI> the day before in great tryumph; but a few days after she had something to countervail, if not to overmatch her <HI>sorrow;</HI> for according to Saint <HI>Lewis</HI> law, she was made Queen Regent of <HI>France</HI> during the Kings Minori∣ty, who was then but about years of Age: Many consultations were held how to punish <HI>Revillas,</HI> and ther were some <HI>Italia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> Physitians that undertook to prescribe a torment, that should last a constant torment for three days, but he scap'd onely with this, His body was pull'd between four horses, that one might hear his Bones crack, and after the dislocation, they were set again, and so he was carryed in a Cart standing half naked, with a Torch in that hand which had committed the murrher; and in the place where the act was done, it was cut off, and a Gauntlet of hot Oyl was clap'd upon the stump, to stanch the bloud, whereat he gave a dolefull shrike, then was he brought upon a stage, wher a new pair of <HI>Boots</HI> was provided for him, half fill'd with boyling Oyl, then his body was pincer'd, and hot Oyl powr'd into the holes; in al the extremity of this torture, he scarce shew'd any sense of pain, but when the Gauntlet was clap'd upon his Arms to stanch the Flux at which time he of reaking bloud, gave a shrike onely; He boar up against all these torments about three hours before he dyed: all the <HI>confession</HI> that could be drawn from him, was, <HI>That he thought to have done God good service, totake away that King, which would have embroil'd all Christendom in an endlesse War.</HI></P>
<P>A fatall thing it was, that <HI>France</HI> should have theee of her Kings com to such violent deaths, in so short a <HI>revolution</HI> of time. <HI>Henry</HI> the second running at Tilt with Monsieur <HI>Montgomery,</HI> was kill'd by a Splinter of a Lance that pierc'd his eye: <HI>Henry</HI> the third, not long after, was kill'd by a young Fryer, who in lieu of a <HI>Letter</HI> which he pretended to have for him, pull'd out of his long sleeve a Knife, and thrust him into the <HI>Bottom</HI> of the belly, as he was coming from his <HI>Close stool,</HI> and so dispatcht him, but that Regicide was hack'd to peeces in the place by the Nobles: The same destiny attended this King by <HI>Ravillac,</HI> which is becom now a common name of reproach and infamy in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Never was King so much lamented as this, ther are a world not onely of his Pictures, but Statues up and down <HI>France,</HI> and ther's
<PB N="31" REF="28"/>
scarce a Market Town, but hath him erected in the Market place, or ore some Gate, not upon Sign-posts, as our <HI>Henry</HI> the eight; and by a publick Act of Parliament which was confirmed in the Consistory at <HI>Rome,</HI> he was enti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>led, <HI>Henry</HI> the Great, and so plac'd in the Temple of Immortality.

<P>BEing to morrow to part with <HI>Paris,</HI> and begin my journey for <HI>Spain,</HI> I thought it not amisse to send you this, in regard I know not when I shall have opportunity to write unto you a∣gain.</P>
<P>This Kingdom since the young King hath taken the Scepter into his own hands doth flourish very much with quietnes and Commerce; nor is there any motion or the least tintamar of trou∣ble in any part of the Countrey, which is rare in <HI>France.</HI> Tis true, the Queen Mother is discontented since She left her Regency, being confin'd, and I know not what it may com unto in time, for she hath a strong party, and the murthering of her Marquis of <HI>Ancre</HI> will yet bleed as som fear.</P>
<P>I was lately in societie of a Gentleman, who was a Spectator of that Tragedie, and he pleas'd to relate unto me the particulars of it, which was thus: When <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth was slain, the Queen Dowager took the Reins of the Government into her hands during the young Kings Minority; and amongst others whom she advanc'd Signor <HI>Conchino,</HI> a <HI>Florentin,</HI> and her Foster-Brother was one; Her countenance came to shine so strongly up∣on him, that he became her onely confident and favourit, inso∣much, that she made him Marquis of <HI>Ancre,</HI> one of the twelve

Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> Governour of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and conferr'd di∣vers other Honours, and Offices of trust upon him, and who but he; The Princes of <HI>France</HI> could not endure this domineering of a stranger, therefore they leagu'd together, to suppresse him by Arms; The Queen Regent having intelligence hereof, sur∣priz'd the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and clap'd him up in the <HI>Bastile;</HI> the Duke of <HI>Main</HI> fled hereupon to <HI>Peronne</HI> in <HI>Pycardie,</HI> and other great men put themselves in an Armed posture, to stand upon their guard: The young King being told, that the Marquis of <HI>Ancre</HI> was the ground of this discontentment, commanded Mon∣sieur <HI>de Vitry,</HI> Captain of his Guard, to Arrest him, and in case of resistance, to kill him: This busines was carried very closely till the next morning, that the said Marquis was coming to the <HI>Louvre</HI> with a ruffling train of Gallants after him, and passing over the Draw-Bridge at the Court-Gate, <HI>Vitry</HI> stood there with the Kings Guard about him, and as the Marquis entred, he told him, that he had a Commission from the King to apprehend him, therefore he demanded his Sword; the Marquis hereupon put his hand upon his Sword, some thought to yeeld it up, others to make opposition; in the mean time <HI>Vitry</HI> discharg'd a Pistoll at him, and so dispatch'd him: The King being above in his Gal∣lery, ask'd what noise that was below, one smilingly answer'd▪ nothing Sir, but that the Marshall of <HI>Ancre</HI> is slain; who slew him? The Captain of your Guard; why? Because he would have drawn his Sword at Your Majesties Royall Commission, then the King replied, <HI>Vitry hath done well, and I will maintain the act:</HI> Presently the Queen Mother had all her Guard taken from her, except six men and sixteen Women, and so she was banish'd <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> and commanded to retire to <HI>Blois: Ancre's</HI> Body was buried that night in a Church hard by the Court, but the next morning, when the Laquays and Pages (who are more unhappy here then the <HI>Apprentises</HI> in <HI>London</HI>) broke up his Grave, tore his Coffin to peeces, rip'd the Winding-Sheet, and tied his Body to an Asses Tail, and so dragg'd him up and down the Gutters of <HI>Paris,</HI> which are none of the sweetest; they then slic'd off his Ears, and nail'd them upon the Gates of the City, they cut off his Genito∣ries (and they say he was hung like an Asse) and sent them for a present to the Duke of <HI>Main,</HI> the rest of his Body, they carried to the New-Bridg, and hung him his Heels upwards, and Head downwards upon a new Gibbet, that had bin set up a little before to punish them who should speak ill of the present Government, and it was his chance to have the Maiden-head of it himself: His

and leads the will as it were by a silken thred to cooperat with them all: I have felt these motions often in me, specially at this time, that my memory fixed upon you: But the reason that I fell first upon you in <HI>Spain,</HI> was, that I remembred I had heard you often discoursing how you had received part of your educati∣on here, which brought you to speak the Language so exactly well: I think often of the Relations I have heard you make of this Countrey, and the good instructions you pleas'd to give me.</P>

<P>Ther is a Tradition, that ther were divers Mynes of Gold in Ages pass'd amongst those Mountains: And the Shepherds that kept Goats then, having made a small fire of Rosemary stubs, with other combustible stuff to warm themselves, this fire graz'd along, and grew so outragious, that it consum'd the very Entrails

of the Earth, and melted those Mynes, which growing fluid by liquefaction, ran down into the small Rivelets that were in the Valleys, and so carried all into the Sea, that monstrous Gulph which swalloweth all, but seldom disgorgeth any thing; and in these Brooks to this day som small Grains of Gold are found.</P>
<P>The <HI>Viceroy</HI> of this Countrey hath taken much pains to clear these Hills of Robbers, and ther hath bin a notable havock made of them this yeer; for in divers Woods as I pass'd, I might spie som Trees laden with dead Carcases, a better Fruit far then <HI>Dio∣genes</HI> Tree bore, wheron a Woman had hang'd her self, which the <HI>Cynic</HI> cryed out to be the best bearing Tree that ever he saw.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF this Letter fail, either in point of Orthography or Style, you must impute the first to the tumbling posture my body was in at the writing hereof being a shipboard, the second to the muddi∣nesse of my Brain, which like Lees in a narrow Vessell, hath been shaken at Sea in divers Tempests neer upon fourty days, I mean naturall dayes, which include the nights also, and are compos'd of four and twenty hours, by which number the <HI>Italian</HI> computes his
<PB N="44" REF="35"/>
time, and tells his Clock, for at the writing hereof, I heard one from <HI>Malamoeca</HI> strike one and twenty hours: When I shall have saluted yonder Virgin City that stands before me, and hath tantaliz'd me now this sennight, I hope to cheer my spirits, and settle my Pericranium again.</P>
<P>In this voyage we pass'd thorow, at least touch'd, all those Seas, which <HI>Horace</HI> and other Poets sing of so often, as the <HI>Iornian,</HI> the <HI>Aegean,</HI> the <HI>Icarian,</HI> the <HI>Tyrrhene,</HI> with others, and now we are in the <HI>Adrian</HI> Sea, in the mouth whereof, <HI>Venice▪</HI> stands like a Gold Ring in a Bears Muzzle: We pass'd also by <HI>Aetna,</HI> by the <HI>Infames Scopules, Acroceraunia,</HI> and through <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis,</HI> about which the ancient Poets, both Greek, and Latin, keep such a coyl, but they are nothing so horrid or dangerous, as they make them to be; they are two white keen-pointed Rocks, that lie under water diametrically opposed, and like two Dragons defying one a∣nother, and ther are Pylots, that in small Shallops, are ready to steer all ships that pasle: This amongst divers other, may serve for an instance, That the old Poets used to heighten and hoise up things by their ayrie fancies above the reality of truth: <HI>Aetna</HI> was very furious when we pass'd by, as she useth to be somtimes more then other, specialy when the wind is Southward, for then she is more subject to belching out flakes of fire (as Stutterers use to flammer more when the wind is in that hole) som of the sparkles fell aboard of us; but they would make us beleeve in <HI>Syracusa</HI> now <HI>Messina,</HI> that <HI>Aetna</HI> in times pass'd, hath eructated such huge gob∣bets of fire, that the sparks of them have burnt houses in <HI>Malta,</HI> above fifty miles off, transported thither by a direct strong wind: We pass'd hard by <HI>Corinth,</HI> now <HI>Ragusa,</HI> but I was not so <HI>happy</HI> as to touch there, for you know</P>
<Q>Non cuivis homini contingit adire corinthum:</Q>

<HEAD><HI>XXIX.</HI> To my Brother, from <HI>Venice.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Found a Letter of yours that had lain dormant here a good while in Mr. <HI>Symns</HI> hands, to welcom me to <HI>Venice,</HI> and I thank you for the variety of news wherwith she went sreighted; for she was to me, as a Ship richly laden from <HI>London</HI> useth to be to our Marchants here, and I esteem her Cargazon at no lesse a va∣lue, for she inrich'd me with the knowledg of my Fathers health, and your own, with the rest of my Brothers, and Sisters, in the Countrey, with divers other passages of content∣ment; besides, she went also ballasted with your good instructi∣ons, which as Marchants use to do of their commodities, I will turn to the best advantage, and <HI>Italy</HI> is no ill Market to improve any thing; the onely <HI>procede</HI> (that I may use the mercantil term) you can expect, is thanks, and this way I shall not be wanting to make you rich returns.</P>
<P>Since I came to this Town I dispatch'd sundry businesses of good value for Sir <HI>Robert Mansell,</HI> which I hope will give content: The art of Glasse-making here is very highly valued, for whoso∣ever be of that profession, are Gentlemen <HI>ipso facto,</HI> and it is not without reason, it being a rare kind of knowledg and chymistry, to transmute Dust and Sand (for they are the onely main Ingre∣dients) to such a diaphanous pellucid dainty body as you see a Crystal-Glasse is, which hath this property above Gold or Silver or any other minerall, to admit no poyson; as also, that it never, wastes or loseth a whit of its first weight, though you use it ne∣ver so long: When I saw so many sorts of curious Glasses made here, I thought upon the complement which a Gentleman put upon a Lady in <HI>England,</HI> who having five or six comly Daughters, said, <HI>He never saw in his life, such a dainty Cupboard of Crystall-Glasses;</HI> the complement proceeds it seems from a saying they have here, <HI>That the first handsom Woman that ever was made, was made of Venice-Glasse,</HI> which implies <HI>Beuty, but brittlenes withall</HI> (and <HI>Venice</HI> is not unfurnish'd with som of that mould, for no place abounds more with Lasses and Glasses) but considering the brittlenes of the Stuff, it was an odd kind of melancholly in him,
<PB N="48" REF="37"/>
that could not be perswaded, but he was an <HI>Urinal,</HI> surely he de∣serv'd to be piss'd in the mouth: But when I pried into the Ma∣terials, and observ'd the Furnaces and the Calcinations, the Transubstantintions, the Liquefactions that are incident to this Art, my thoughts were rais'd to a higher speculation; that if this small Furnace-fire hath vertue to convert such a small lump of dark Dust and Sand into such a specious clear Body as Crystall, surely, that gran Universall-site, which shall happen at the day of judgment, may by its violent-ardor <HI>vitrifie</HI> and turn to one lump of Crystall, the whole Body of the Earth; nor am I the first that fell upon this conceit.</P>
<P>I will in large my self no further to you at this time, but conclude with this Tetrastic which my Brain ran upon in my Bed this mor∣ning.</P>

<P>I Was plung'd in a deep fit of melancholly, <HI>Satum</HI> had cast his black influence ore all my intellectuals, me thought I felt my heart as a lump of Dow, and heavy as Lead within my Brest; when a Letter of yours of the third of this month was brought me, which presently begot new Spirits within me, and made such strong impressions upon my Intellectuals, that it turn'd and transform'd me into another man.

A Car∣dinall is made by a short <HI>Breve</HI> or <HI>Writ</HI> from the <HI>Pope</HI> in these words, <HI>Creamus te Socium Regibus, superiorem ducibus &amp; fratrem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ostrum: We creat thee a Companion to Kings, Superior to Dukes, and our Brother:</HI> If a Cardinall Bishop should be questioned for any offence, ther must be twenty four Witnesses produc'd against him.</P>
<P>The Bishop of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ia</HI> hath most priviledg of any other, for he consecrats and instals the <HI>Pope,</HI> and goes always next to him: All these Cardinals have the repute of Princes, and besides other in∣comes, they have the Annats of Benefices to support their great∣nesse.</P>
<P>For point of power, the <HI>Pope</HI> is able to put 50000 men in the field, in case of necessity, besides his navall strength in Gallies. We read how <HI>Paul</HI> the third sent <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth twelve thousand Foot, and 500. Horse. <HI>Pius</HI> the fifth sent a greater ayd to <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth▪ and for riches, besides the Temporall Dominions he hath in all the Countreyes before named, the Datary or Dis∣patching of <HI>Bulls,</HI> the Trienniall Subsidies, Annats, and other Ec∣clesiastic Rights, mount to an unknown sum; and it is a common saying here. <HI>That as long as the</HI> Pope <HI>can finger a pen, he can want no pence. Pius</HI> the fifth, notwithstanding his expences in Buil∣dings left four Millions in the Castle of Saint <HI>Angelo,</HI> in lesse then five yeers, more I beleeve then this <HI>Gregory</HI> the fifteenth will, for
<PB N="63" REF="44"/>
he hath many Nephews; and better it is to be the <HI>Popes</HI> Nephew, then to be favorit to any Prince in Christendom.</P>
<P>Touching the Temporall Government of <HI>Rome,</HI> and Oppidan Affairs; ther is a Pretor, and som choice Citizens which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>it in the Capitoll: Amongst other peeces of policy, ther is a Synagog of Jews permitted here (as in other places of <HI>Italy</HI>) under the Popes nose, but they go with a mark of distinction in their hats, they are tolerated for advantage of commerce, wherin the Jews are won∣derfull dextrous, though most of them be only Brokers and Lom∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rdeers; and they are held to be here, as the <HI>Cinic</HI> held Women to be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>alum necessarium.</HI> Ther be few of the <HI>Romans</HI> that use to pray heartily for the Popes long life, in regard the oftner the change is, the more advantagious it is for the City, because com∣monly it brings strangers, and a recruit of new people. This Ayr of <HI>Rome</HI> is not so wholsom as of old, and amongst other reasons one is because of the burning of Stubble to fatten their fields; For her Antiquities, it would take up a whole Volumn to write them, those which I hold the chiefest are <HI>Vespasia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s Amphitheater,</HI> wher fourscore thousand people might sit; The Stoves of <HI>Anthony,</HI> di∣vers rare Statues at <HI>Belveder</HI> and Saint <HI>Peters,</HI> specially that of <HI>Laocoon,</HI> the <HI>Obelisk;</HI> for the genius of the <HI>Roman</HI> hath alwayes bin much taken with Imagery, Limming, and Sculptures, inso∣much, that as in former times, so now, I beleeve the Statues and Pictures in <HI>Rome,</HI> exceed the number of living people: One an∣tiquity among other, is very remarkable, because of the change of Language; which is an ancient <HI>Column</HI> erected as a Trophey for <HI>Duillius</HI> the <HI>Consull,</HI> after a famous Navall Victory obtain'd against the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> in the second Punic War, wher these words are ingraven and remain legible to this day. <HI>Exemet leciones Maci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rates Castreis exfocient pugnandod cepet enque <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>avebos marid Con∣sull, &amp;c.</HI> And half a dozen lines more it is call'd <HI>Columna restrata,</HI> having the Beaks and Prores of ships ingraven up and down, wherby it appears, that the <HI>Latin</HI> then spoken was much differing from that which was us'd in <HI>Ciceros</HI> time 150. yeers after. Since the dismembring of the Empire <HI>Rome</HI> hath run through many Vieissi∣tudes, and turns of Fortune; and had it not bin for the residence of the Pope, I beleeve she had becom a heap of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tones, a mount of Rubbish by this time; and howsoever that she bears up indifferent well, yet one may say,</P>

<P>Present <HI>Rome</HI> may be said to be but the Monument of <HI>Rome</HI> pass'd, when she was in that flourish that Saint <HI>Austin</HI> desired to see her in: She who tam'd the world, tam'd her self at last, and falling under her own weight, fell to be a prey to <HI>Time;</HI> yet ther is a providence seems to have a care of her still; for though her Ayr <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e not so good, nor her circumjacent Soyl so kindly as it was, yet she hath wherwith to keep life and soul together still, by her Ec∣clesiastic Courts, which is the sole cause of her peepling now: So that it may be said, When the Pope came to be her head, she was reduc'd to her first principles; for as a shepherd was founder, so a shepherd is still her Governour and preserver.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am now in the Gentle City of <HI>Naples,</HI> a Citie swelling with all delight, Gallantry and Wealth; and truely, in my opinion, the King of <HI>Spains</HI> greatnes appears here more emminently, then in <HI>Spain</HI> it self: This is a delicat luxurious Citie, fuller of true-bred Cavaliers, then any place I saw yet. The Clime is hot, and the constitutions of the Inhabitants more hot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Napolitan</HI> is accounted the best Courtier of Ladies, and the greatest embracer of pleasure of any other peeple: They say ther is no lesse here then twenty thousand Courtizans registred in the office of <HI>Savelli.</HI> This Kingdom with <HI>Calabria,</HI> may be said to be the one Moytie of <HI>Italy,</HI> it extends it self 450. miles, and spreds in bredth 112; it contains 2700 Towns, it hath 20 Arch∣bishops 127 Bishops, 13 Princes, 24 Dukes, 25 Marquisses, and 800 Barons. Ther are three Presidiall Castles in this Citie; and though the Kingdom abound in rich Staple commodities, as Silks, Cottons, and Wine, and that ther is a mighty Revenue comes to the Crown; yet the King of <HI>Spain</HI> when he casts up his account at the yeers end, makes but little benefit therof, for it is eaten up twixt Governours, Garrisons, and Officers. He is forc'd to main∣tain 4000 <HI>Spanish</HI> Foot, call'd the <HI>Tercia</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> in the Castles he hath 1600 in perpetuall Garrison; he hath 1000 men of Arms, 450 Light-Horse; besides ther are five Footmen enroll'd for evry hundred Fire; And he had need to do all this, to keep this voluptuous people in aw; for the Story musters up seven and twenty famous Rebellions of the <HI>Neapolitans</HI> in lesse then 300 yeers: But now they pay soundly for it, for one shall hear them groan up and down under the <HI>Spanish</HI> yoak; And commonly the King of <HI>Spain</HI> sends som of his <HI>Grandes</HI> hither, to repair their decayed fortunes, whence the saying sprung, <HI>That the Viceroy of</HI> Sicily <HI>gnaws, the Governour of</HI> Milan <HI>Eats, but the Viceroy of</HI> Naples <HI>devoures.</HI> Our <HI>English</HI> Merchants here, beat a considerable Trade, and their Factors live in better Equippage, and in a more splen∣did manner, as in all <HI>Italy</HI> besides, then their Masters and Prin∣cipalls in <HI>London,</HI> they ruffle in Silks and Sattins, and wear good <HI>Spanish</HI> Leather-Shooes, while their Masters-Shooes upon our

At <HI>Puzzoli</HI> not far off amongst the <HI>Grotts,</HI> ther are so many strange stupendous things, that nature her self seem'd to have studied of purpose how to make her self there admir'd: I reserve the discoursing of them with the nature of the <HI>Tarantola,</HI> and <HI>Manna</HI> which is gatherd'd here and no wher else, with other things, till I shall see you, for they are fitter for discours then a Letter.

<HEAD><HI>XLI.</HI> To Sir <HI>J. C.</HI> from <HI>Florence.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis Letter comes to kisse your hands from fair <HI>Florence,</HI> a Citie so beutifull, that the great Emperour (<HI>Charls</HI> the fifth) said, <HI>That she was fitting to be shewn, and seen onely upon Ho∣lidayes:</HI> She marvailously flourisheth with Buildings, with Wealth and Artisans; for it is thought that in Serges, which is but one commodity, ther are made two millions evry yeer: All de∣grees of people live here not onely well, but splendidly well, not∣withstanding the manifold exactions of the Duke, upon all things: For none can buy here Lands or Houses, but he must pay eight in the hundred to the Duke; none can hire or build a House, but he must pay the tenth penny; none can marry, or commerce suite in Law, but ther's a Fee to the Duke; none can bring as much as an Egg or Sallet to the Market, but the Duke hath share therinna: Moreover, <HI>Ligorn</HI> which is the Key of <HI>Toscany,</HI> being a Maritim, and a great Mercantil Town, hath mightily inrich'd this Countrey by being a Frank Port to all comers, and a safe rende∣vouz to Pyrats, as well as to Marchants. Add hereunto, that the Duke himself in som respect is a Marchant, for he somtimes ingrosseth all the Corn of the Countrey, and retails it at what rate he pleaseth. This inables the Duke to have perpetually 20000 men inroll'd, train'd up, and payed, and none but they can carry Arms; he hath 400 Light-Horse in constant pay, and 100 men at Arms besides; and all these quartered in so narrow a compasse, that he can command them all to <HI>Florence</HI> in twenty four hours. He hath twelve Gallies, two Galeons, and six Ga∣leasses besides, and his Gallies, are call'd, <HI>The black Fleet,</HI> be∣cause they annoy the <HI>Turk</HI> more in the bottom of the <HI>Straits,</HI> then any other.</P>
<P>This State is bound to keep good quarter with the Pope, more then others; for all <HI>Toscany</HI> is fenc'd by Nature her self, I
<PB N="70" REF="48"/>
mean with Mountains, except towards the Territories of the Apostolic <HI>See,</HI> and the <HI>Sea</HI> it self, therfore it is call'd a <HI>Countrey of Iron.</HI></P>
<P>The Dukes Palace is so spacious, that it occupieth the Room of fifty Houses at least; yet though his Court surpasseth the bounds of a Duke's, it reacheth not to the Magnificence of a King's: The Pope was sollicited to make the gran Duke a King, and he answer'd, That he was content he should be King <HI>in Tos∣cany,</HI> not of <HI>Toscany;</HI> wherupon one of his Counsellors replied, That it was a more glorious thing to be a <HI>gran</HI> Duke, then a <HI>petty</HI> King.</P>
<P>Among other Cities which I desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>'d to see in <HI>Italy, Genoa</HI> was one wher I lately was, and found her to be the proudest for buil∣dings of any I met withall, yet the people go the plainest of any other, and are also most parsimonious in their diet: They are the subtillest, I will not say the most subdolous dealers; they are wonderfull wealthy specially in Money: In the yeer 1600 the King of <HI>Spain</HI> owed them eighteen millions, and they say it is double as much now.</P>
<P>From the time they began to finger the <HI>Indian</HI> Geld, and that this Town hath bin the <HI>Scale</HI> by which he hath conveyed his Tre∣sure to <HI>Flanders,</HI> since the VVars in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> for the sup∣port of his Armies, and that she hath got som priviledges for the exportation of VVools, and other commodities (prohibited to others) out of <HI>Spain,</HI> she hath improv'd extremely in riches, and made Saint <HI>George</HI>'s Mount swell higher then Saint <HI>Marks</HI> in <HI>Ve∣nice.</HI></P>
<P>She hath bin often ill favouredly shaken by the <HI>Venetian,</HI> and hath had other enemies, which have put her to hard shifts for her own defence, specially in the time of <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleventh of <HI>France;</HI> at which time, when she would have given her self up to him for Protection, King <HI>Lewis</HI> being told that <HI>Genoa</HI> was con∣tent to be his, he answerd, <HI>She should not be his long, for he would give her up to the devill, and rid his hands of her.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Genowaies</HI> have not the Fortune to be so well be∣lov'd, as other people in <HI>Italy,</HI> which proceeds I beleeve from their cunningnes, and over-reachings in bargaining, wherin they have somthing of the <HI>Iew.</HI> The Duke is there but Bienni∣al, being chang'd evry two yeers: He hath fifty <HI>Germans</HI> for his Guard; ther be four <HI>Centurion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> that have 100 men a peece, which upon occasions, attend the Signory abroad in Velvet
<PB N="71" REF="48"/>
Coats; ther be eight chief Governours, and 400 Counsellours, amongst whom ther be five Soverain Syndics, who have autho∣rity to censure the Duke himself, his time being expir'd, and pun∣ish any Governour else, though after death, upon the Heir.</P>
<P>Amongst other customs they have in that Town, one is, That none must carry a pointed Knif about him, which makes the <HI>Hol∣lander,</HI> who is us'd to <HI>Snik and Snee,</HI> to leave his Horn-sheath and Knif a Shipboard when he comes a shore: I met not with an <HI>Englishman</HI> in all the Town; nor could I learn of any Factour of ours that ever resided there.</P>
<P>Ther is a notable little active Republic towards the midst of <HI>Toscany,</HI> call'd <HI>Luca,</HI> which in regard she is under the Empe∣rours protection, he dares not meddle withall, though she lie as a Partridg under a Faulcons Wings, in relation to the gran Duke; besides ther is another reason of the State, why he meddles not with her, because she is more beneficiall unto him now that she is free, and more industrious to support this free∣dom, then if she were becom his vassall; for then it is probable, she would grow more carelesse and idle, and so could not vent his commodities so soon, which she buyes for ready money, wherin most of her wealth consists: Ther is no State that winds the peny more nimbly, and makes quicker returns.</P>
<P>She hath a Counsell call'd the <HI>Discoli,</HI> which pryes into the profession and life of evry one, and once a yeer they rid the State of all Vagabonds: So that this petty, pretty Republic, may not be improperly parellell'd to a Hive of Bees, which have bin al∣wayes the emblems of industry and order.</P>
<P>In this splendid City of <HI>Florence,</HI> ther be many rarities, which if I should insert in this Letter, it would make her swell too big, and indeed they are fitter for Parol Communication. Here is the prime dialect of the <HI>Italian</HI> spoken, though the pronunciation be a little more guttural, then that of <HI>Siena,</HI> and that of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> which occasions the Proverb,</P>
<Q>Lingua Toscana in boca Romana.</Q>
<Q>The Toscan toung sounds best in a Roman mouth.</Q>
<P>The peeple here generally seem to be more generous, and of a higher comportment then elsewhere, very cautious
<PB N="72" REF="49"/>
and circumspect in their negotiation; whence ariseth the Pro∣verb,</P>
<Q><L>Chi há da far con <HI>Tosco,</HI></L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am now upon point of shaking hands with <HI>Italy;</HI> for I am com to <HI>Turin,</HI> having already seen <HI>Uenice</HI> the rich, <HI>Padoua</HI> the learned, <HI>Bologna</HI> the fat, <HI>Rome</HI> the holy, <HI>Naples</HI> the gentle, <HI>Genoa</HI> the proud, <HI>Florence</HI> the fair, and <HI>Milan</HI> the great; from this last, I came hither, and in that City also appears the <HI>Grandeur</HI> of <HI>Spains</HI> Monarchy very much: The Governour of <HI>Milan</HI> is alwayes Captain Generall of the Cavalry to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> thorowout <HI>Italy:</HI> The Dnke of <HI>Feria</HI> is now Gover∣nour, and being brought to kisse his hands, he us'd me with extraordinary respect, as he doth all of our Nati∣on, being by the maternall side a <HI>Dormer.</HI> The <HI>Spaniard</HI> entertains there also 3000 Foot, 1000 Light-Horse, and 600 men at Arms in perpetuall pay; so that I beleeve the benefit of that Dutchy also, though seated in the richest Soyl of <HI>Italy,</HI> hardly countervails the charge. Three things are admir'd in <HI>Milan,</HI> the <HI>Dome</HI> or great Church (built all of white Marble, within and without) the Hos∣pitall, and the Castle, by which the Cittadell of <HI>Antwerp</HI> was trac'd, and is the best condition'd Fortresse of Christendom: Though <HI>Nova Palma</HI> a late Fortresse of the <HI>Venetian</HI> would go beyond it, which is built ac∣cording to the exact Rules of the most modern Engin∣ry, being of a round form with nine Bastions, and a street levell to evry Bastion.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="50"/>The Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> though he passe for one of the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> yet the least part of his Territories lie there, being squander'd up and down amongst the <HI>Alps;</HI> but as much as he hath in <HI>Italy,</HI> which is <HI>Piemont,</HI> is a well peepled, and passing good Countrey.</P>
<P>This Duke of <HI>Savoy Emanuel,</HI> is accounted to be of the ancient'st and purest extraction of any Prince in <HI>Eu∣rop,</HI> and his Knights also of the <HI>Anunciade,</HI> to be one of the ancient'st Orders; though this present Duke be little in Stature, yet is he of a lofty spirit, and one of the best Souldiers now living; and though he be valiant enough, yet he knows how to patch the Lions-skin with a Fox-Tail; and whosoever is Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> had need be cunning, and more then any other Prince, in regard, that lying between two potent Neighbours, the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> he must comply with both.</P>
<P>Before I wean my self from <HI>Ital<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> a word or two touch∣ing the genius of the Nation. I find the <HI>Italian</HI> a de∣gree higher in complement then the <HI>French,</HI> he is longer and more grave in the delivery of it, and more prodigal of words, insomuch, that if one were to be worded to death, <HI>Italian</HI> is the fittest Language, in regard of the flu∣ency and softnes of it; for throughout the whole body of it, you have not a word ends with a consonant, except som few Monosyllable Conjunctions and Propositions, and this renders the Speech more smooth; which made one say, <HI>That when the confusion of toungs happen'd at the building of the Tower of</HI> Babel▪ <HI>if the</HI> Italian <HI>had bin there,</HI> Nimrod <HI>had made him a Playsterer.</HI> They are gene∣rally indulgent of themselves, and great embracers of pleasure, which may proceed from the luscious rich Wines, and luxurious Food, Fruits, and Roots, wherwith the Countrey abounds, Insomuch, that in som places, Na∣ture

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am now got ore the <HI>Alps,</HI> and return'd to <HI>France;</HI> I had cross'd and clammer'd up the <HI>Pyreneans</HI> to <HI>Spain</HI> before, they are not so high and hideous as the <HI>Alps;</HI> but for our <HI>Mountains</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> as <HI>Eppint</HI> and <HI>Penwinm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ur,</HI> which are so much cry'd up amongst us, they are <HI>Mole∣hills</HI> in comparison of these, they are but <HI>Pigmeys</HI> com∣par'd to <HI>Giants,</HI> but <HI>blisters</HI> compar'd to <HI>Impostumes,</HI> or <HI>Pimples</HI> to <HI>Werts:</HI> Besides, our <HI>Mountains</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> bear always somthing usefull to man or beast, som grass at least; but these uncouth huge monstrous excrescences of Nature, bear nothing (most of them) but craggy Stones: The tops of som of them are blanch'd over all the yeer long with Snows, and the people who dwell in the Valleys drinking, for want of other, this <HI>Snow-water,</HI> are subject to a strange swelling in the Throat, called <HI>Goytre,</HI> which is common amongst them. As I scal'd the <HI>Alps,</HI> my thoughts reflected upon <HI>Hannibal,</HI> who with <HI>Vinegar</HI> &amp; <HI>Strong-Waters,</HI> did eat out a passage through those Hills, but of late yeers they have found a speedier way to do it by <HI>Gun-Powder.</HI></P>
<P>Being at <HI>Turin,</HI> I was by som disaster brought to an extreme low ebb in money, so that I was forc'd to foot it along with som <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> and with gentle pace and ea∣sie journeys, to clime up those Hills till I came to this Town of <HI>Lions,</HI> where a Countrey man of ours, one Mr.
<PB N="77" REF="51"/>
<HI>Lewis,</HI> whom I knew in <HI>Alieant</HI> lives Factour, so that now I want not any thing for my accommodation.</P>
<P>This is a stately rich Town, and a renowned Mart for the Silks of <HI>Italy,</HI> and other Levantin commodities, and a great bank for mony, and indeed the greatest of <HI>France.</HI> Before this Bank was founded, which was by <HI>Henry</HI> the first, <HI>France</HI> had but little Gold and Silver, insomuch, that we read how King <HI>Iohn</HI> their Captive King, could not in four yeers, raise sixty thousand Crowns to pay his Ransome to our King <HI>Edward;</HI> And Saint <HI>Lewis</HI> was in the same case when he was pri∣soner in Egypt, wher he had left the Sacrament for a gage; But after this Bank was erected, it fill'd <HI>France</HI> full of money; They of <HI>Luca, Florence,</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> with the <HI>Venetian,</HI> got quickly over the Hils, and brought their moneys hither to get twelve in the hundred profit, which was the interest at first, though it be now much lower.</P>
<P>In this great Mercantil Town, ther be two deep na∣vigable Rivers, the <HI>Rhone</HI> and the <HI>Sone,</HI> the one hath a swift rapid cours, the other slow and smooth: And one day as I walk'd upon their Banks, and observed so much difference in their cours, I fell into a contemplation of the humors of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniard,</HI> how they might be not improperly compar'd to these Rivers; the <HI>French</HI> to the <HI>swift,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to the <HI>slow</HI> River.</P>
<P>I shall write you no more Letters untill I present my self unto you for a speaking Letter, which I shall do as soon as I may tread <HI>London</HI> stones:</P>

<HEAD><HI>XLIIII.</HI> To Mr. <HI>Tho. Bowyer,</HI> from <HI>Lions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEing so neer the Lake of <HI>Geneva,</HI> curiosity would carry anyone to see it: The Inhabitants of that Town, me thinks, are made of another past differing from the affable nature of those peeple I had convers'd withall formerly; they have one policy, lest that their pretty Republic should be pester'd with fugitives, their Law is, <HI>That what stranger soever flies thither for sanctua∣ry, he is punishable there, in the same degree, as in the Country wher he committed the offence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Geneva</HI> is govern'd by four Syndncs, and four hundred Senators: She lies like a Bonetwixt three Mastiffs, the Emperour, the <HI>French</HI> King, and the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> they all three look upon the Bone, but neither of them dare touch it sing∣ly, for fear the other two would flie upon him: But they say the Savoyard hath the justest Title, for ther are Imperiall Records extant, <HI>That al∣though the</HI> Bishops <HI>of</HI> Geneva <HI>were</HI> Lords Spiri∣tuall and Temporall, <HI>yet they should acknowledge the</HI> Duke of Savoy <HI>for their</HI> Superiour: This man's Ancestors went frequently to the Town, and the Keys were presently tender'd to him. But since <HI>Calvins</HI> time, who had bin once ba∣nish'd,

and then call'd in again, which made him to apply that speech unto himself, <HI>The stone which the builders refused, is becom the head stone of the corner;</HI> I say, since they were refin'd by <HI>Cal∣vin,</HI> they seem to shun and scorn all the World besides, being cast as it were into another mould, which hath quite alter'd their very naturall dis∣position in point of Morall Society.</P>
<P>Before I part with this famous City of <HI>Lions,</HI> I will relate unto you a wonderfull strange ac∣cident that happen'd here not many yeers ago: Ther is an Officer call'd <HI>Le Chevalier du Guet</HI> (which is a kind of Night-guard) here as well as in <HI>Paris,</HI> and his Lieutenant call'd <HI>Iaquette,</HI> ha∣ving supp'd one night in a rich Marchants house, as he was passing the round afterwards, he said, <HI>I wonder what I have eaten and drunk at the Mar∣chants house, for I find my self so hot, that if I met with the</HI> Divels Dam <HI>to night, I should not forbear using of her;</HI> hereupon, a little after he overtook a young Gentlewoman mask'd, whom he would needs usher to her lodging, but discharg'd all his Watch, except two: she brought him, to his thinking, to a little low lodging hard by the City Wall, wher ther were only two Rooms: and af∣ter he had enjoyed her, he desir'd, that according to the custom of <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen, his two Camerads might partake also of the same plea∣sure; so she admitted them one after the other:
<PB N="82" REF="53"/>
And when all this was don, as they sat together, she told them, if they knew well, who she was, none of them would have ventur'd upon her; thereupon she whissel'd three times, and all va∣nish'd: The next morning, the two souldiers that had gon with Lieutenant Jaquette were found dead under the City Wall, amongst the ordure and excrements, and <HI>Iaquette</HI> himself a little way off half dead, who was taken up, and coming to himself, confess'd all this, but died presently af∣ter.</P>
<P>The next week I am to go down the <HI>Loire</HI> to∣wards <HI>Paris,</HI> and thence as soon as I can for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> wher amongst the rest of my frends, whom I so much long to see after this Trienniall sepa∣ration, you are like to be one of my first objects; In the mean time, I wish the same happinesse may attend you at <HI>home,</HI> as I desire to attend me <HI>hom-ward;</HI> for I am</P>

That wonder of <HI>Nature</HI> is a Church-Mo∣nument, where an Earl and a Lady are engraven with 365 Chil∣dren about them, which were all delivered at one birth; they were half male, half femal; the Bason hangs in the Church which carried them to be Christned, and the Bishops Name who did it; and the Story of this Miracle, with the year and the day of the month mentioned, which is not yet 200 years ago; and the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ory is this: That Countesse walking about her door after dinner, ther came a Begger-woman with two children upon her back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beg alms, the Countesse asking whether those children were her own, she answered, she had them both at one birth and by one father, who was her husband; The Countesse would not onely give her a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y alms, but revil'd her bitterly, saying, it was impossible for one man to get two children at once: The begger-woman being thus provok'd with ill words and without alms fell to imprecations, that it should please God to shew his judgment upon her, and that she might bear at one birth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> many children as ther be dayes in the year, which she did before the same years end, having never born child before. We are now in North <HI>Holland,</HI> where I never saw so many, amongst so few, sick of L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>prosies; and the reason is, because they commonly eat abundance of fresh Fish.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO attempt a precise description of each of the seventeen <HI>Pro∣vinces,</HI> and of its Progression, Privileges and Primitive government, were a task of no lesse confusion than labour: Let it suffice to know, that since <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> were erected to Earldoms, and so left to be an apendix of the Crown of <HI>France▪</HI> som of them have had absolut and supreme Governors, som subaltern and subject to a superior Power. Amongst the rest the Earls of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> were most considerable, but of them two he of <HI>Holland</HI> being homegeable to none, and having <HI>Friestand</HI> and <HI>Ze∣land</HI> added, was the more potent: In processe of time all the se∣venteen met in one; som by conquest, others by donation and legacie, but most by alliance: In the House of <HI>Burgundy</HI> this union receivd most growth, but in the House of <HI>Austria</HI> it came to its full perfection; for in <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth they all met as so many lines drawn from the circumference to the centre, who Lording as supreme head not only over the fifteen Temporall, but the two Spirituall, <HI>Liege</HI> and <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>recht,</HI> had a def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>in to reduce them to a Kingdom, which his Son <HI>Philip</HI> the second attempted after him, but they could not bring their intents home to their aym, the cause is imputed to that multiplicitie and difference of privileges which they are so eager to maintain, and wherof som cannot stand with a Monarchie without incongruity. <HI>Philip</HI> the second at his inauguration was sworn to observe them, &amp; at his departure he ob∣lig'd himself by oath, to send still one of his own bloud to govern them: Moreover, at the request of the Knights of the golden
<PB N="17" REF="61"/>
Fleece, he promised that all Forren souldiers should retire, and that he himself would come to visit them once every seventh year, but being once gon, and leaving in lieu of a Sword a <HI>Distaff</HI> an unweldy woman to govern, he came not only short of his pro∣mise, but procur'd a Dispensation from the Pope to be absolv'd of his Oath, and all this by the counsell of the Cardinall <HI>Granvill,</HI> who, as the States Chronicler writes, was the first firebrand that kindled that lamentable and longsome war wherein the <HI>Nether∣lands</HI> have traded above fifty years in bloud: For intending to encrease the number of Bishops, to establish the decrees of the Counsell of <HI>Trent,</HI> and to clip the power of the Counsell of State compos'd of the natives of the Land, by making it appealable to the Counsell of <HI>Spain,</HI> and by adding to the former Oath of Alle∣geance, (all which conduc'd to settle the inquisition, and to curb the conscience) the broyls began; to appease which, Ambassa∣dors were dispatch'd to <HI>Spain,</HI> wherof the two first came to vio∣lent deaths, the one being beheaded, the other poysond: But the two last <HI>Egmont</HI> and <HI>Horn</HI> were nourish'd still with hopes, untill '<HI>Phi∣lip</HI> the second had prepar'd an Army under the conduct of the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> to compose the difference by arms▪ For as soon as he came to the government, he established the <HI>Blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t-rad,</HI> as the com∣plainants term'd it, a Counsell of Bloud, made up most of <HI>Spani∣ards, Egmont</HI> and <HI>Horn</HI> were apprehended, and afterwards behea∣ded; Cittadells were erected, and the Oath of Allegeance, with the Politicall government of the Countsey in divers things alter'd: This powr'd oyl on the fire formerly kindled, and put all in com∣bustion; The Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> retires, therupon his eldest son was surpriz'd and sent as Hostage to <HI>Spain,</HI> and above 5000. Fa∣milies quit the Countrey, many Towns revolted, but were after∣wards reduc'd to obedience, which made the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> say, that the <HI>Netherlands</HI> appertain'd to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> not only by <HI>descent</HI> but <HI>conquest,</HI> and for cumble of his victories when he at∣tempted to impose the tenth peny for maintenance of the Garrisons in the Cittadels he had erected at <HI>Grave, V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>echt,</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> (where he caus'd his Statue made of Canon brasse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>o be erected, trampling the <HI>Belgians</HI> under his feet) all the Towns withstood this imposition, so that at last matters succeeding ill with him, and ha∣ving had his cosen <HI>Pacecio</HI> hang'd at <HI>Flushing</HI> gates after he had trac'd out the platform of a Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>dell in that Town also, he receiv'd Letters of revocation from <HI>Spain;</HI> Him succeeded <HI>Don Luys de Re∣quiseus,</HI> who came short of his predecessor in exploits, and dying suddenly in the field, the government was invested for the time in

The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Ambassadors interc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ding for a peace, had a short answer of <HI>Philip</HI> the second, who said, that he needed not the help of any to reconcile himself to his own subjects, and reduce them to conformity, but the difference that was he would refer to his co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>en the Emperor: Hereupon the busines was agitated at <HI>Colen,</HI> where the <HI>Spaniard</HI> stood as high a tipto as ever, and notwithstanding the vast expence of treasure and bloud he had bin at for so many years, and that matters began to exasperat more and more, which were like to prolong the wars <HI>in infinitum,</HI> he would abate nothing in point of Ecclesiastic government: Hereupon the States perceiving that King <HI>Philip</HI> could not be wrought either by the sollicitation of other Princes, or their own supplications so often rei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>erated, that they might enjoy the freedom of Religion, with other infranchise∣ments, and finding him inex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rable, being incited also by that ban which was published against the Prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> that whosoever killd him should have 5000. crowns, they at last absolutely re∣nounced and abjur'd the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for their Soverain; They bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>k his Seals, chang'd the Oath of Allegeance, and fled to

Having thus made sure work with the <HI>English,</HI> they made young <HI>Count Maurice</HI> their Governor, who for five and twenty years together held rack with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and during those tra∣verses of war was very fortunat: an overture of Peace was then propounded, which the States would not hearken unto <HI>singly</HI> with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> unlesse the <HI>Provinces</HI> that yet remaind under him would engage themselfs for performance of what was Articled, besides they would not treat either of Peace or Truce, unless they were declar'd <HI>free States,</HI> all which was granted, so by the inter∣vention of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors, a Truce was con∣cluded for 12 years.</P>
<P>These wars did so drain and discommodat the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by reason of his distance (every Soldier that he sent either from <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> costing him nere upon a hundred crowns before he could be rendred in <HI>Flanders,</HI>) that notwithstanding his mines of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru▪</HI> it plung'd him so deeply in debt, that having taken up moneys in all the chief banks of Christendom he was forcd to pub∣lish a <HI>Diplo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>a</HI> wherein he dispens'd with himself (as the <HI>Holland</HI> Story hath it) from payment, alleging that he had employed those moneys for the public Peace of Christendom: this broak ma∣ny great Banquers, and they say his credit was not current in <HI>Se∣vill</HI> or <HI>Lisbon</HI> his own Towns: and which was worse, while he stood wrastling thus with his own Subjects, the <HI>Turke</HI> took his op∣portunity
<PB N="20" REF="63"/>
to get from him <HI>Tunis</HI> and the <HI>Goletta</HI> the Tropheys of <HI>Charles</HI> the fift his Father. So eager he was in this quarrell that he imployd the utmost of his strength and industry to reduce this peo∣ple to his will, in regard he had an intent to make these <HI>Provinces</HI> his main Randevous and Magazin of men of war, which his neigh∣bors perceiving, and that he had a kind of aym to be <HI>Western Mo∣narch,</HI> being led not so much for love as reasons of State, they stuck close to the revolted <HI>Provinces,</HI> and this was the bone that Se∣cretary <HI>Walsingham</HI> told Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> he would cast the King of <HI>Spain</HI> that should last him 20 years, and perhaps make his teeth shake in his head.</P>
<P>But to return to my first discours whence this digression hath snatchd me, The <HI>Netherlands</HI> who had bin formerly knit and con∣centred under one Soverain Prince, were thus dismembred; And as they subsist now, They are a <HI>State</HI> and a <HI>Province:</HI> The <HI>Pro∣vince</HI> having ten of the 17. at least, is far greater, more populous, better soyld, and more stor'd with Gentry. The <HI>State</HI> is the rich∣er and stronger, the one proceeding from their vast Navigation and Commerce, the other from the qualitie of their Countrey, be∣ing defensible by Rivers and Sluces, by meanes wherof they can suddenly overwhelm all the whole Countrey, witnes that stupen∣dious siege of <HI>Leyden</HI> and <HI>Haerlam,</HI> for most of their Towns the marks being taken away are inaccessible by reason of shelfs of sands. Touching the transaction of these <HI>Provinces</HI> which the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> made as a dowry to the Archduke <HI>Albertus,</HI> upon marri∣age with the <HI>Infanta</HI> (who therupon left his red Hat, and <HI>Toledo</HI> Miter the chiefest spirituall Dignity in Christendom for revenue after the Papacy) it was fringd with such cautelous restraints, that he was sure to keep the better end of the staff still to himself: for he was to have the tutele and ward of his children, that they were to marry with one of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Family recommended by <HI>Spain,</HI> and in default of issue, and in case <HI>Albertus</HI> should survive the <HI>Infanta,</HI> he should be but Governor only: Add hereunto that King <HI>Philip</HI> reserv'd still to himself all the Cittadells and Castles, with the order of the golden Fleece, wherof he is Master, as he is Duke of <HI>Burgundy.</HI></P>
<P>The Archduke for the time hath a very princely command, all Coyns bear his st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>mp, all Placarts or Edicts are publishd in his name, he hath the election of all civill Officers, and Magistrats; he nominats also Bishops and Abbars, for the Pope hath only' the Confirmation of them here, nor can he adjourn any out of the Countrey to answer any thing, neither are his Bulls of any
<PB N="21" REF="63"/>
strength without the Princes <HI>placet,</HI> which makes him have alwayes som Commissioners to execute his Authority. The people here grow hotter and hotter in the <HI>Roman</HI> Cause, by reason of the mix∣ture with <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Italians;</HI> as also by the example of the Archduke, and the <HI>Infanta,</HI> who are devout in an intense degree. Ther are two supreme Counsells, the Privy Counsell, and that of the State; this treats of confederations and intelligence with for∣ren Princes, of Peace and War, of entertaining or of dismissing Co∣lonells and Captains, of Fortifications, and they have the surinten∣dency of the highest affairs that concern the Prince and the policy of the <HI>Provinces.</HI> The privat hath the granting of all Patents and Requests, the publishing of all Edicts and Proclamations, the prising of Coin, the looking to the confines and extent of the <HI>Pro∣vinces,</HI> and the enacting of all new Ordinances. Of these two Counsells ther is never a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but in the actuall Counsell of War their voices are predominant: Ther is also a Court of Finan∣ces or Exchequer, whence all they that have the fingring of the Kings money, must draw a discharge. Touching matters of Ju∣stice, their Law is mixt between Civill and common with some clau∣ses of Canonicall: The high Court of Parliament is at <HI>Maline,</HI> whither all Civill Causes may be brought by appeal from other Towns, except som that have municipall Privileges, and are soverain in their owne jurisdictions, as <HI>Mons in Henalt,</HI> and a few more.</P>
<P>The prime <HI>Province</HI> for dignity is <HI>Brabant,</HI> which amongst many other privileges it enjoyeth, hath this for one, not to appear upon any summons out of its owne precinct, which is one of the reasons why the Prince makes his residence there: but the prime for extent and fame is <HI>Flanders</HI> the chiefest Earldom in Chri∣stendom, which is three dayes journey in length; <HI>Ghent,</HI> its Me∣tropolis, is reputed the greatest town of Europe, whence arose the Proverb, <HI>Les flamen tient un gan, qui tiendrá Paris dedans.</HI> But the beautifullest, richest, strongest, and most privileg'd City is <HI>Ant∣werp</HI> in <HI>Brabant,</HI> being the <HI>Marquisat</HI> of the holy Empire, and drawing nere to the nature of a <HI>Hans</HI> Town, for she payes the Prince no other Tax but the Impost. Before the dissociation of the seventeen <HI>Provinces,</HI> this Town was one of the greatest Marts of Europe, and greatest bank this side the <HI>Alpes,</HI> most Princes having their Factors here, to take up, or let out moneys, and here our <HI>Gre∣sham</HI> got all his wealth, and built our Royall Exchange by modell of that here. The Merchandise was brought hither from <HI>Germany, France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> by Land, and from <HI>England, Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Hans</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="64"/>
towns by Sea, was estimated at above twenty Millions of Crowns every year; but as no violent thing is long lasting, and as tis fatall to all Kingdomes, States, Towns and Languages to have their pe∣riod, so this renown'd Mart hath suffer'd a shrewd eclipse, yet no utter downfall, the Exchange of the King of <HI>Spains</HI> money and some small land trafic, keeping still life in her, though nothing so full of vigor as it was. Therfore there is no town under the Arch∣duke where the States have more conceal'd friends than in <HI>Antwerp,</HI> who would willingly make them her Masters in hope to recover her former commerce which after the last twelve years truce began to revive a little, the States permitting to passe by <HI>Lillo's</HI> sconce which cōmands the river of <HI>Skeld</HI> and lyeth in the teeth of the Town som small cross-saild ships to passe hither: There is no place hath been more passive than this, and more often pillag'd; amongst other times she was once plunder'd most miserably by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> un∣der the conduct of a Priest, immediatly upon <HI>Don Iohn</HI> of <HI>Au∣stria's</HI> death, she had then her <HI>Stat-house</HI> burn'd, which had cost a few years before above twenty thousand Crowns the building, and the spoils that were carried away thence amounted to forty Tuns of gold: Thus she was reduc'd not only to poverty, but a kind of captivity, being commanded by a Citadell, which she preferr'd be∣fore a Garrison; this made the Merchant retire and seek a more free Randevous, som in <HI>Zeland,</HI> som in <HI>Holland,</HI> specially in <HI>Amster∣dam</HI> which rose upon the fall of this Town, as <HI>Lisbon</HI> did from <HI>Ve∣nice</HI> upon the discovery of the Cape of good Hope, though <HI>Venice</HI> be not nere so much crestfall'n.</P>
<P>I will now steer my discours to the united <HI>Provinces</HI> as they term themselves, which are six in number, <HI>viz. Holland, Zeland, Frisland, Overyssell, Gronninghen</HI> and <HI>Utrecht,</HI> three parts of <HI>Gilderland,</HI> and some Frontire Towns and places of contribution in <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Flanders:</HI> In all these ther is no innovation at all introduc'd, not∣withstanding this great change in point of Government, except that the College of States represents the Duke or Earl in times pass'd, which College consists of the chiefest Gentry of the Coun∣trey, surintendants of Towns, and the principall Magistrates: E∣very <HI>Province</HI> and great Town choose yearly certain Deputies, to whom they give plenary power to deliberat with the other States of all affairs touching the public welfare of the whole <HI>Province,</HI> and what they vote stands for Law. These being assembled consult of all matters of State, Justice and War, the Advocat who is prime in the Assembly propounds the busines, and after collects the suf∣frages, first of the <HI>Provinces,</HI> then of the Towns, which being put in
<PB N="23" REF="64"/>

This keeps the common Treasury always full, that upon any extraordi∣nary service or dessein ther is seldom any new tax upon the people. Trafic is their generall profession, being all either Merchants o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Ma∣riners, and having no land to manure, they furrow the Sea for their living; and this universality of trade and their banks of adven∣tures distributes the wealth so equally, that few amongst them are exceeding rich or exceeding poor: Gentry amongst them is very thin, and as in all Democraties little respected, and comming to dwell in Towns they soon mingle with the Merchant, and so dege∣nerat: Their soyl being all 'twixt marsh and medow is so fat in pasturage, that one Cow will give eight quarts of milk a day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>o that as a Boor told me, in four little dorps near <HI>Herlam,</HI> 'tis thought ther is as much milk milk'd in the year, as ther is Rhenish wine brought to <HI>Dort,</HI> which is the sole Staple of it. Their towns are beautifull and neatly built, and with uniformity, that who sees one, sees all: In some places, as in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the foundation costs more than the superstructure, for the ground being soft, they are con∣strain'd to ram in huge stakes of timber (with wooll about it to pre∣serve it from pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rifaction) till they com to a firm basis; so that as one said, whosoever could see <HI>Amsterdam</HI> under ground, should see a huge winter Forrest.</P>

<P>I have been long in the survay of these <HI>Provinces,</HI> yet not long enough, for much more might be said which is fitter for a Story than a Survay; I will conclude with a mot or two of the people, wherof som have been renownd in times past for feats of war: a∣mongst the States, the <HI>Hollander</HI> or <HI>Batavian</HI> hath been most known, for som of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors have had a selected guard of them about their persons for their fidelity and valeur, as now the King of <HI>France</HI> hath of the <HI>Swisse:</HI> The <HI>Frisons</HI> also have bin famous for those large privileges wherwith <HI>Charlemain</HI> endowd them; The <HI>Flemins</HI> also have bin illustrious for the martiall exploits they a∣chiev'd in the East where two of the Earls of <HI>Flanders</HI> were crownd Emperors.

<P>Ther is no part of Europ so hanted with all sorts of <HI>Forrener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> as the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> which makes the Inhabitants as well women as men so well vers'd in all sorts of languages, so that in Ex∣change time one may hear 7. or 8. sorts of toungs spoken upon their Bourses: nor are the men only expert herein, but the wo∣men and maids also in their common hostries, and in <HI>Holland</HI> the wif's are so well vers'd in bargaining, cifring and writing, that in the absence of their Husbands in long Sea voyages they beat the trade at home, and their words will passe in equall credit: These women are wonderfully sober, though their Husbands make com∣monly their bargains in drink, and then are they most cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>elous.

<P>That which for the present affords most plenty of news, is <HI>Rochell,</HI> which the King threatneth to block up this Spring with an army by sea, under the comand of the D. of <HI>Nevers,</HI> and by a land army under his own conduct: both sides prepare, he to assault, the <HI>Rochellers</HI> to defend. The King declares that he proceeds not against them for their Religion which he is still contented to tolerat, but for holding an Assembly against his Declarations. They answer that their As∣sembly is grounded upon his Majesties royal Warrant, given at the dissolution of the last Assembly at <HI>Lodun,</HI> wher he solemnly gave his word to permit them to re-assemble when they would six months as∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>er, if the breaches of their liberty, and grievances which they then propounded wer not redressed; and they say this being unperform'd, it stands not with the sacred Person of a King to violat his promise, being the first that ever he made them. The King is so incens'd a∣gainst them, that their Deputies can have neither accesse to his Per∣son, nor audience of his Counsell, as they stile themselves the De∣puties of the Assembly at <HI>Rochell;</HI> but if they say they com from the whole body of Them of the pretended reform'd Religion, he will hear them. The breach between them is grown so wide, that the King resolves upon a fiege. This resolution of the Kings is much
<PB N="31" REF="68"/>
somented by the <HI>Roman</HI> Clergy, specially by the <HI>Celestines,</HI> who have 200000 Crowns of gold in the <HI>Arsenal</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> which they would sacrifice all to this service, besides the Pope sent him a Bull to levy what sums he would of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church, for the ad∣vancement of this design: This resolution also is much push'd on by the Gentry, who besides the particular emploiments and pay they shall receive hereby, are glad to have their young King train'd up in Arms to make him a Martiall man; But for the Merchant and poor Peasan, they tremble at the name of this War, fearing their teeth should be set on edge with those soure grapes their fa∣thers tasted in the time of the <HI>League,</HI> for if the King begin with <HI>Rochell,</HI> 'tis fear'd all the four corners of the Kingdom will be set on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>re.</P>
<P>Of all the Towns of surety which They of the Religion hold, <HI>Rochell</HI> is the chiefest; a place strong by nature, but stronger by Art; It is a Maritim town, and landward they can by sluces drown a leagues distance: 'tis fortified with mighty thick walls, bastions, and counters<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>arps, and those according to the modern rules of Engin∣ry. This amongst other cautionary Towns, was granted by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, to them of the Religion for a certain term of years, which being expir'd, the King saith they are devolv'd again to the Crown, and so demands them. They of the Religion pretend to have divers grievances; first they have not been paid these two years the 160000 Crowns which the last King gave them annually to maintain their Ministers and Garrisons: They complain of the Kings carriage lately at <HI>Bearn (Henry</HI> the greats Countrey) which was merely Protestant, where he hath introduc'd two years since the public exercise of the Masse, which had not bin sung there fifty years before; he alter'd also there the Government of the Countrey, and in lieu of a <HI>Viceroy,</HI> left a Governor only: and wheras <HI>Navarrin</HI> was formerly a Court of Parlement for the whol Kingdom of <HI>Navar,</HI> (that's under <HI>France</HI>) he hath put it down and published an Edict, that the <HI>Navarrois</HI> should com to <HI>Tolo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>se,</HI> the chief town of <HI>Lan∣guedoc;</HI> and lastly, he left behind him a Garrison in the said Town of <HI>Navarrin.</HI> These and other grievances they of the Religion pro∣pos'd to the King lately, desiring his Majesty would let them enjoy still those privileges his Predecessor <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and his Father <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth afforded them by Act of Pacification: But he made them a short answer, that what the one did in this point, he did it out of <HI>fear;</HI> what the other did, he did it out of <HI>love;</HI> but he would have them know that he neither <HI>lov'd</HI> them, nor <HI>fear'd</HI> them: so the busines is like to bleed sore on both sides; nor is ther yet any apea∣rance of prevention.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="69"/>Ther was a scuffle lately here 'twixt the Duke of <HI>Navers</HI> and the Cardinal of <HI>Guise,</HI> who have had a long sute in law about an Abbey, and meeting the last week about the Palace, from words they fell to blows, the Cardinall struck the Duke first, and so were parted, but in the afternoon ther appear'd on both sides no lesse than 3000 horse in a field hard by, which shews the populousnes and sudden strength of this huge City, but the matter was taken up by the King himself, and the Cardinall clapt up in the <HI>Bastile,</HI> wher the King saith he shall abide to <HI>ripen;</HI> for he is but young, and they spake of a <HI>Bull</HI> that is to come from <HI>Rome</HI> to decardinalize him.

<P>I Was afraid I should never have had ability to write to you a∣gain, I had lately such a dangerous fit of sicknes, but I have now pass'd the brunt of it, God hath been pleas'd to reprieve me, and reserve me for more days which I hope to have grace to num∣ber better; Mr. <HI>Altham</HI> and I having retired to a small Town from <HI>Paris</HI> for more privacy, and sole conversation with the na∣tion; I tyed my self to a task for the reading of so many books in such a compasse of time, and therupon to make good my-word to my self, I us'd to watch many nights together, though it was in the depth of Winter, but returning to this Town, I took cold in the head, and so that mals of rheum which had gather'd by my former watching turn'd to an impostume in my head, wher∣of I was sick above forty days, at the end they caute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>is'd and made an issue in my check to make vent for the impostume, and that sav'd my life: At first they let me bloud, and I parted with above fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y ounces in lesse than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ortnight, for <HI>phlebotomy</HI> is so much practis'd here, that if ones little finger ake, they presently open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> vein, and to ballance the bloud on both sides, they usually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>et bloud in both arms.

was eighteen dayes and nights that I had no sleep but short im∣perfect slumbers, and those too protur'd by potions; the tumor at last came so about my throat that I had scarce vent left for res∣piration, and my body was brought so low with all sorts of Phy∣sic, that I appeard like a meer <HI>Skeleton.</HI> When I was indifferent∣ly well recover'd, som of the Doctors and Chirurgions that ten∣ded me, gave me a visit, and amongst other things they fell in discours of wines which was the best; &amp; so by degrees they fell upon other beverages, and one Doctor in the company who had bin in <HI>England,</HI> told me that we have a drink in <HI>England</HI> cal'd Ale, which he thought was the wholsomst liquor that could go into ones guts, for wheras the body of man is supported by two columns, <HI>viz.</HI> the naturall heat, and radicall moysture, he said, ther is no drink conduceth more to the preservation of the one, and the encrease of the▪ other than Ale, for while the <HI>Englishmen</HI> drank only Ale, they were strong brawny able men, and could draw an arrow an ell long, but when they fell to wine and beer, they are found to be much impaird in their strength and age; so the Ale bore away the bell among the Doctors.</P>
<P>The next week we advance our course further into <HI>France</HI> to∣wards the river of <HI>Loire</HI> to <HI>Orleans,</HI> whence I shall continue to con∣vey my duty to you.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honble <HI>SIR.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THat of the fifth of this present which you pleasd to send me, was receiv'd. and I begin to think my self somthing more then I was, that you value so much the slender endevors of my pen to do you service. I shall continue to improve your good opinion of me as opportunity shall serve.</P>
<P>Touching the great threats against <HI>Rochell,</HI> wherof I gave you
<PB N="35" REF="70"/>
an ample relation in my last, matters are becom now more calm and rather inclining to an accommodation, for 'tis thought a sum of money will make up the breach; and to this end som think all these bravado's were made. The Duke of <HI>Luynes</HI> is at last made Lord high Constable of <HI>France</HI> the prime Officer of the Crown, he hath a peculiar Court to himself, a guard of a 100. men in rich liveries, and a hundred thousand livers every year Pension: The old Duke of <HI>Lesdiguieres,</HI> one of the ancientst soldiers of <HI>France,</HI> and a Protestant, is made his Lieutenant.</P>
<P>But in regard all Christendom rings of this Favorit, being the greatest that ever was in <HI>France</HI> since the <HI>Maires of the Palace,</HI> who came to be <HI>Kings</HI> afterwards, I will send you herein his Legend. He was boru in <HI>Province,</HI> and is a Gentleman by descent, though of a pettie extraction, in the last Kings time he was preferr'd to be one of his pages, who finding him industrious, and a good wai∣ter, allow'd him 300. Crowns pension <HI>per annum,</HI> which he hus∣banded so well, that he maintaind himself and his two brothers in passable good fashion therwith. The King observing that, doub∣led his Pension, and taking notice that he was a serviceable in∣strument and apt to please, he thought him fit to be about his son, in whose service he hath continued above fifteen years, and he hath <HI>flown</HI> so high into his favor by a singular dexteri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ie and Art he hath in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>aulconrie,</HI> and by shooting at birds flying, wherin the King took great pleasure, that he hath <HI>soard</HI> to this pitch of honor. He is a man of a passable good understanding and forecast, of a mild comportment, humble and debonnair to all, and of a winning con∣versation, he hath about him choice and solid heads who prescribe unto him rules of policie, by whose Compas he steers his course, which is likely will make him subsist long: He is now com to that transcendent altitude, that he seems to have mounted above the reach of envy, and made all hopes of supplanting him frustrate, both by the politic guidance of his own actions, and the powerfull alliances he hath got for himself and his two brothers: he is maried to the Duke of <HI>Montbazons</HI> daughter, one of the prime Peers of <HI>France.</HI> His second brother <HI>Cadanet</HI> (who is reputed the wisest of the three) maried the heiress of <HI>Picardy,</HI> with whom he had 9000 l. lands a year. His third brother <HI>Brand</HI> to the great heiress of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> of which house ther have bin five Emperor; so that these three brothers and their allies would be able to coun∣ter balance any one faction in <HI>France,</HI> the eldest and youngest be∣ing made Dukes, and Peers of <HI>France,</HI> the other Marshall. Ther are lately two Ambassadors extraordinary com hither from <HI>Venice</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="71"/>
about the <HI>Valtolin,</HI> but their negotiation is at a stand, untill the re∣turn of an Ambassador extraordinary which is gone to <HI>Spain:</HI> Ambas∣sadors also are com from the <HI>Hague</HI> for payment of the <HI>French</HI> Re∣giment there, which hath bin neglected these ten years, and to know whether his Majesty will be pleasd to continue their pay any longer; but their answer is yet suspended: They have brought news that the seven ships which were built for his Majesty in the <HI>Tess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ll</HI> are ready, to this he answerd, that he desires to have ten more built; for he intends to finish that design which his Father had a foot a little before his death to establish a royall company of Merchants.</P>
<P>This is all the news that <HI>France</HI> affords for the present, the re∣lation wherof if it prove as acceptable as my endeavors to serve you herein are pleasing unto me, I shall esteem my self happy: So wishing you and my noble Lady continuance of health, and en∣crease of honor, I rest</P>

My Lord <HI>Digby</HI> is preparing for <HI>Spain</HI> in qualitie of Ambassador Extraordinary, to perfect the match twixt our Prince and the Lady <HI>Infanta,</HI> in which business <HI>Gondamar</HI> hath waded already very deep, and bin very active, and ingratiated himself with divers persons of qualitie, Ladies espe∣cially, yet he could do no good upon the Lady <HI>Hatton,</HI> whom he desird lately that in regard he was her next neighbor (at <HI>Ely</HI> House) he might have the benefit of her back gate to go abroad into the fields, but she put him off with a Complement, wherup∣on in a privat audience lately with the King amongst other passa∣ges of merriment, he told him that my Lady <HI>Hatton</HI> was <HI>a strange Lady, for she would not suffer her Husband Sir</HI> Edward Coke <HI>to com in at her foredore, nor him to go out at her back dore;</HI> and so related the whole business: He was also dispatching a l'ost lately for <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Post having receivd his packet, and kisd his hands, he calld him back and told him he had forgot one thing, which was, that when he came to <HI>Spain he should commend him to the Sun,</HI>

<P>I was at a dead stand in the cours of my Fortunes, when it pleas'd God to provide me lately an employment to <HI>Spain,</HI> whence I hope there may arise both repute and profit.

Now the business is this: Ther was a great <HI>Turky</HI> ship call'd the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> sailing through the Streights towards <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but by distress of weather she was

great <HI>Britain</HI> since the beginning of these <HI>German</HI> wars hath labourd to merit well of this Crown, and of the whole House of <HI>Austria,</HI> by a long and lingring patience, grounded still upon assurances hence, that care should be had of his honor, his Daughters joyn∣ture, and grand-childrens patrimony; yet how crosly all things had proceeded in the Treaty at <HI>Bruxells,</HI> manag'd by Sir <HI>Richard Weston,</HI> as also <HI>that</HI> in the <HI>Palatinat</HI> by the Lord <HI>Chichester:</HI> how in treating time the Town and Castle of <HI>Heidelberg</HI> were taken, <HI>Man∣beim</HI> besieg'd, and all acts of Hostility us'd, notwithstanding the fair professions made by this King, the <HI>Infanta</HI> at <HI>Bruxells,</HI> and other his Ministers: How meerly out of respect to this King, he had neg∣lected all Martiall means which probably might have preserv'd the <HI>Palatinat:</HI> those thin Garrisons which he had sent thither being ra∣ther for honors sake to keep a footing untill a generall accommoda∣tion, than that he relyed any way upon their strength: And since that there are no other fruits of all this but reproach and scorn▪ and that those good Offices which he us'd towards the Emperor on the behalf of his Son in law, which he was so much encouraged by Letters from hence should take effect, have not sorted to any other issue, than to a plain affront and a high injuring of both their Ma∣jesties, though in a different degree; The Earl is to tell him that his Majesty of great <HI>Britain</HI> hopes and desires that out of a true ap∣prehension of these wrongs offerd unto them both, he will as his dear and loving brother faithfully promise and undertake upon his honor, confirming the same under his hand and seal, either that <HI>Heidelberg</HI> shall be within seventy days rendred into his hands; as also that ther shall be within the said term of seventy days a su∣spension of arms in the <HI>Palatinat,</HI> and that a Treaty shall recom∣mence upon such terms as he propounded in <HI>November</HI> last, which this King held then to be reasonable: And in case that this be not yeelded unto by the Emperor, that then this King joyn forces with his Majesty of <HI>England,</HI> for the recovery of the <HI>Palatinat,</HI> which upon this trust hath been lost; or in case his <HI>forces</HI> at this time be o∣therwise employ'd, that they cannot give his Majesty that assistance he desires and deserves, that at least he will permit a free and friendly passage through his Territories, for such Forces as his Me∣jesty of great <HI>Britain</HI> shall employ into <HI>Germany:</HI> Of all which, if the Earl of <HI>Bristoll</HI> hath not from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> a direct as∣surance under his hand and Seal ten days after his audience, that then he take his leave, and return to <HI>England</HI> to his Majesties pre∣sence, els to proceed in the negotiation of the match according to former instructions.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="81"/>This was the main substance of his Majesties late letter, yet there was a postill added, that in case a rupture happen 'twixt the two Crowns, the Earl should not com instantly and abruptly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>way, but that he should send advice first to <HI>England,</HI> and carry the busines so, that the world should not presently know of it.</P>

<P>YOurs of the second of <HI>October</HI> came to safe hand with the in∣clos'd; you write that there came dispatches lately from <HI>Rome,</HI> wherin the Pope seems to endevour to insinuat himself into a di∣rect treaty with <HI>England,</HI> and to negotiat immediatly with our King touching the dispensation, which he not only labours to e∣vade, but utterly disclaims, it being by Article the task of this King to procure all dispatches thence: I thank you for sending me this news. You shall understand there came lately an express from <HI>Rome</HI> also to this Court, touching the business of the match which gave very good content; but the dispatch and new instructions, which Mr. <HI>Endymion Porter</HI> brought my Lord of <HI>Bristoll</HI> lately from <HI>England</HI> touching the Prince <HI>Palatinat,</HI> fills us with apprehensions of fear: Our Ambassadors here have had audience of this King already about those Propositions, and we hope that Master <HI>Porter</HI> will carry back such things as will satisfie.

in the Treaty wherin the two Kings differ'd most, <HI>viz.</HI> about the education of the children, and the exemption of the <HI>Infanta's</HI> Ec∣clesiastic servants from secular jurisdiction: both these points are clear'd, for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> is com from fourteen years to ten, and for so long time the <HI>Infant</HI> Princes shall remain under the mothers go∣vernment.

<P>THe great busines of the match was tending to a period, the Articles reflecting both upon Church and State, being ca∣pitulated, and interchangeably accorded on both sides, and ther wanted nothing to consummate all things, when to the wonder∣ment of the world the Prince and the Marquis of <HI>Buckingham</HI> ar∣riv'd at this Court a friday last, upon the close of the evening▪ they lighted at my Lord of <HI>Bristols</HI> house, and the Marquis (Mr <HI>Thomas Smith</HI>) came in first with a Portmantle under his arm, then (Mr <HI>Iohn Smith</HI>) the Prince was sent for, who staid a while the to'ther side of the street in the dark, my Lord of <HI>Bristoll</HI> in a kind of astonishment brought him up to his bed chamber, where he pre∣sently calld for pen and ink, and dispacht a Post that night to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> to acquaint his Majesty how in lesse then sixteen daies he was come safely to the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> that Post went lightly laden, for he carried but three letters: the next day came Sir <HI>Francis Co∣tington</HI> and Mr <HI>Porter,</HI> and darke rumors ran in every corner how som great man was com from <HI>England,</HI> and som would not stick to say amongst the vulgar, it was the King, but towards the evening on saturday the marquis went in a close coach to Court, where he had privat audience of this King, who sent <HI>Olivares</HI> to ac∣company him back to the Prince, where he kneeld and kisd his hands, and hugd his thighs, and deliverd how unmeasurably glad his Catholic Majesty was of his coming, with other high comple∣ments, which Mr <HI>Porter</HI> did interpret. About ten a clock that night, the King himself came in a close coach with intent to visit

the Prince, who hearing of it, met him halfway, and after salu∣tations and divers embraces which past in the first interview they parred late: I forgot to tell you, that Count <HI>Gondamar</HI> being sworn Counseller of State that morning, having bin before but one of the Counsell of War, he came in great hast to visit the Prince saying, he had strange news to tell him, which was that an <HI>English∣man</HI> was sworn privy Counseller of <HI>Spain,</HI> meaning himself, who he said was an <HI>Englishman</HI> in his heart. On Sunday following, the King in the afternoon came abroad to take the air with the Queen, his two brothers and the <HI>Infanta,</HI> who were all in one coach, but the <HI>Infanta</HI> sat in the boot with a blew riband about her arm, of purpose that the Prince might distinguish her: ther were above twenty coaches besides of Grandes, Noble men and Ladies that at∣tended them.

<P>I Received lately one of yours, which I cannot compare more pro∣perly than to a posie of curious flowers, ther was therin such variety of sweet strains and dainty expressions of love: And though it bore an old date, for it was forty days before it came to safe hand, yet the flowers were still fresh, and not a whit faded, but did cast as strong and as fragrant a sent, as when your hands bound them up first together, only ther was one flower that did not savor so well, which was the undeserved Character you please to give of my smal abilities, which in regard you look upon me through the prospective of affection, appear greater unto you than they are of themselvs; yet as smal as they are I would be glad to employ them all to serve you upon any occasion.</P>
<P>Wheras you desire to know how matters pass here, you shall un∣derstand that we are rather in assurance, than hopes that the match will take effect, when one dispatch more is brought from <HI>Rome</HI> which we greedily expect. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> generally desire it, they are much taken with our Prince, with the bravery of his journey, and his discreet comportment since, and they confess ther was never Princess courted with more gallantry. The wits of the Court here, have made divers Encomiums of him, &amp; of his affection to the L <HI>Infanta.</HI> Amongst others, I send you a Latin Poem of one <HI>Marnieri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s a Valenciano,</HI> to which I add this ensuing <HI>Hexastic,</HI> which in regard of the difficulty of the Verse consisting of all <HI>Ternaries</HI> (which is the hardest way of versifying) and of the exactness of the translation, I believe will give you content.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe long look'd-for Dispensation is come from <HI>Rome,</HI> but I hear it is clogg'd with new clauses; and one is, that the Pope who allegeth that the only aim of the Apostolicall See in granting this Dispensation, was the advantage and case of the Ca∣tholics in the King of great <HI>Britaines</HI> Dominions, therfore he de∣sir'd a valuable caution for the performance of those Articles which were stipulated in their favor; this hath much puzled the busi∣nes, and Sir <HI>Francis Cotington</HI> comes now over about it: Besides ther is som distast taken at the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> here, and I heard this King should say he will treat no more with him, but with the Ambassadors, who he saith, have a more plenary Com∣mission,
<PB N="67" REF="86"/>
and understand the busines better. As ther is som dark∣nes hapned twixt the two Favorits, so matters stand not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ight twixt he Duke and the Earl of <HI>Bristoll;</HI> but God forbid that a busines of so high a consequence as this which is likely to tend so much to the universall good of Christendom, to the restitution of the <HI>Pa∣latinat,</HI> and the composing those broils in <HI>Germany,</HI> should be ran∣versd by differences twixt a few privat subjects, though now pub∣lic Ministers.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Washington</HI> the Prince his Page is lately dead of a Calenture, and I was at his buriall under a Figtree behind my Lord of <HI>Bristols</HI> house. A little before his death one <HI>Ballard</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Priest went to tamper with him, and Sir <HI>Edmund Varney</HI> meeting him coming down the stairs out of <HI>Washingtons</HI> chamber, they fell from words to blows; but they were parted. The busines was like to gather very ill bloud, and com to a great height, had not Count <HI>Gonda∣mar</HI> quasht it, which I beleeve he could not have done, unles the times had bin favorable; for such is the reverence they bear to the Church here, and so holy a conceit they have of all Ecclesi∣astics, that the greatest <HI>Don</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> will tremble to offer the mean'st of them any outrage or affront: Count <HI>Gondamar</HI> hath also helpt to free som <HI>English</HI> that were in the Inquisition in <HI>Toledo</HI> and <HI>Sevill,</HI> and I could allege many instances how ready and chearfull he is to assist any <HI>Englishman</HI> whatsoever; notwithstan∣ding the base affronts he hath often receivd of the <HI>London buys</HI> as he calls them. At his last return hither, I heard of a merry saying of his, to the Queen, who discoursing with him about the great∣nesse of <HI>London,</HI> and whether it was as populous as <HI>Madrid,</HI> yes <HI>Madame,</HI> and more populous when I came away, though I beleeve ther's scarce a man left there now but all women and children; for all the mem both in Court and City were ready booted and spurd to go away. And I am sorry to hear how other Nations do much tax the <HI>English</HI> of their incivility to public Ministers of State, and what ballads and pasquils, and fopperies and plays, were made against <HI>Gondamar</HI> for doing his Masters busines. My Lord of <HI>Bristoll</HI> coming from <HI>Germany</HI> to <HI>Brussells,</HI> notwithstanding that at his arrivall thither, the news was fresh that he had reliev'd <HI>Frankindale</HI> as he past, yet was he not a whit the less welcom, but valued the more both by the Archdutchess her self and <HI>Spino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> with all the rest; as also that they knew well that the said Earl had bin the sole adviser of keeping Sir <HI>Robert Mansell</HI> abroad with that Fleet upon the coast of <HI>Spain</HI> till the <HI>Palsgrave</HI> should be restord.

<P>I Receiv'd the letter and commands your Lopp. pleas'd to send me by Mr <HI>Walsingham Gresley;</HI> and touching the Constitutions and Orders of the Contratation House of the <HI>West Indies</HI> in <HI>Sevill,</HI> I cannot procure it for love or money, upon any terms, though I have done all possible diligence▪ therin: And som tell me it is dangerous, and no less then Treason in him, that gives the copy of them to any, in regard 'tis counted the greatest Mystery of all the <HI>Spanish</HI> government.</P>
<P>That difficulty which hapned in the busines of the match of gi∣ving caution to the Pope, is now overcome; for wheras our King answer'd that he could give no other caution than his Royall word and his sons, exemplified under the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> and confirm'd by his Counsell of State, it being impossible to have it done by <HI>Parliament,</HI> in regard of the aversnes the common peo∣ple have to the alliance; And wheras this gave no satisfaction to <HI>Rome,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> now offers himself for caution, for put∣ting in execution what is stipulated in behalf of the <HI>Roman Catho∣lics</HI> throughout his Majestie of great <HI>Britain's</HI> Dominions; but he desires to consult his ghostly fathers to know whether he may do i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> without wronging his conscience; hereupon there hath bin a <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣ta</HI> form'd of Bishops and Iesuits, who have bin already a good while about it, and the Bishop of <HI>Segovia,</HI> who is as it were Lord Threasurer, having written a Treatise lately against the match, was outed of his Office, banisht the Court, and confin'd to his Diocess. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> hath bin ill dispos'd a good while, and lies sick at Court, where the Prince hath no public exercise of devotion, but only bedchamber prayers, and some thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> that his lodging in the Kings house is like to prove a disadvantag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>

to the main business, for wheras most sorts of people here hardly hold us to be Christians, if the Prince had had a Palace of his own, and bin permitted to have us'd a room for an open Chappell to ex∣ercise the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> it would have brought them to have a better opinion of us; And to this end ther were som of our best Church plate, and vestments brought hither, but never us'd. The slow place of this <HI>Iunta</HI> troubles us a little, and to the Divines ther are som Civilians admitted lately, and the <HI>quae∣re</HI> is this, whether the King of <HI>Spain</HI> may bind himself by oath in the behalf of the King of <HI>England,</HI> to perform such and such Arti∣cles that are agreed on in favour of the <HI>Roman Catholics</HI> by vertue of this match, whether the King may doe this <HI>salva conscientia.</HI></P>
<P>Ther was a great show lately here of baiting of bulls with men for the entertainment of the Prince; it is the chiefest of all <HI>Spanish</HI> sports, commonly ther are men killd at it, therfore ther are Priests appointed to be there ready to confess them: It hath hapned often∣times that a Bull hath taken up two men upon his horns with their guts dangling about them; the horsemen run with lances and swords, the foot with goads. As I am told the Pope hath sent di∣vers <HI>Bulls</HI> against this sport of bulling, yet it will not be left, the Nation hath taken such an habituall delight in it. Ther was an ill favord accident like to have hapned lately at the Kings house, in that part wher my Lord of <HI>Carlile,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Denbigh</HI> were lodg'd; for my Lord <HI>Denbigh</HI> late at night taking a pipe of To∣bacco in a <HI>Balcone</HI> which hung over the Kings garden, he blew down the ashes, which falling upon som parchd combustible mat∣ter, began to flame and spread, but Master <HI>Davis</HI> my Lord of <HI>Carliles</HI> Barber leapt down a great height, and quencht it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Court of <HI>Spain</HI> affords now little news, for ther is a <HI>Remo∣ra</HI> sticks to the busines of the match, till the <HI>Iunta</HI> of Di∣vines
<PB N="70" REF="88"/>
give up their opinion: But from <HI>Turky</HI> ther came a Letter this week wherin ther is the strangest and most tragicall news, that in my small reading no Sory can parallell, or shew with more pregnancie the instability and tottering estate of human greatnes, and the sandy foundation wheron the vast <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em∣pire is reard upon: For <HI>Sultan Osman</HI> the grand <HI>Turk.</HI> a man ac∣cording to the humor of that Nation, warlike and fleshd in bloud, and a violent hater of Christians, was in the flower of his yeers, in the heat and height of his courage, knockt in the head by one of his own slaves, and one of the meanest of them, with a battle axe, and the murtherer never after proceeded against or questi∣oned.</P>
<P>The ground of this Tragedy was the late ill success he had a∣gainst the <HI>Pole,</HI> wherin he lost about 100000. horse for want of forrage, and 80000. men for want of fighting, which he imputed to the cowardize of his <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> who rather than bear the brunt of the battell, were more willing to return home to their wives and merchandizing, which they are now permitted to do contrary to their first institution, which makes them more worldly, and less venturous. This disgracefull return from <HI>Poland</HI> stuck in <HI>Osmans</HI> stomach, and so studied a way how to be revengd of the <HI>Ianiza∣ries;</HI> therfore by the advice of his grand <HI>Visier</HI> (a stout gallant man who had bin one of the chief <HI>Beglerbegs</HI> in the East) he inten∣ded to erect a new Soldiery in <HI>Asia</HI> about <HI>Damasco,</HI> of the <HI>Coords</HI> a frontier people, and consequently hardy and inur'd to Arms. Of these he purpos'd to entertain 40000. as a lifegard for his pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣son, though the main design was to suppress his lazie and lust∣full <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> with men of fresh new spirits.</P>
<P>To disguise this plot, he pretended a pilgrimage to <HI>Mecha,</HI> to visit <HI>Mahomets</HI> Tomb, and reconcile himself to the Prophet, who he throught was angry with him, because of his late ill success in <HI>Poland:</HI> but this colour was not specious enough, in regard he might have performd this Pilgrimage with a smaller train and charge; therfore it was propounded that the <HI>Emir</HI> of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>dm</HI> should be made to rise up in arms, that so he might go with a greater power and treasure, but this plot was held disadvantagious to him, in regard his <HI>Ianizaries</HI> must then have attended him: so he pre∣tends and prepares only for the Pilgrimage, yet he makes ready as much treasure as he could make, and to that end he melts his plate, and furniture of horses, with divers Church lamps; this fomented som jealousie in the <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> with certain words which should drop from him, that he would find soldiers shortly should
<PB N="71" REF="88"/>
whip them. Hereupon he hath sent over to <HI>Asias</HI> side his pavili∣ons, many of his servants, with his jewells and treasure, resolving upon the voyage, notwithstanding that divers petitions were deli∣vered him from the Clergy, the civill Magistrate and the Soldi∣ery that he should desist from the voyage, but all would not do: therupon upon the point of his departure, the <HI>Ianizaries</HI> and <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ies</HI> came in a tumultuary manner to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and in a high insolent language disswaded him from the Pilgrimage, and demanded of him his ill counsellors. The first he granted, but for the second, he said that it stood not with his honor, to have his neerest servants torn from him so, without any legall proceeding, but he assur'd them that they should appear in the <HI>Divan</HI> the next day, to answer for themselves; but this not satisfying, they went away in a fury and plunderd the <HI>Grand Visiers</HI> Palace, with divers others; <HI>Osman</HI> hereupon was advis'd to go from his private gardens that night to the <HI>Asian</HI> shore, but his destiny kept him from it: so the next morning they came armd to the Court, (but having made a cove∣nant not to violate the Imperiall Throne) and cut in peeces the <HI>Grand Visier</HI> with divers other great Officers, and not finding <HI>Os∣man,</HI> who had hid himself in a small lodge in one of his gardens, they cried out they must have a <HI>Musulman</HI> Emperor; therfore they broke into a Dungeon, and brought out <HI>Mustapha Osmans</HI> Unkle, whom he had clapt there at the beginning of the tumult, and who had bin King before, but was depos'd for his simplicity, being a kind of <HI>santon</HI> or holy man, that is, twixt an Innocent and an Idi∣ot: This <HI>Mustapha</HI> they did reinthronize and place in the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>toman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>The next day they found out <HI>Osman,</HI> and brought him before <HI>Mustapha,</HI> who excus'd himself with tears in his eyes for his rash at∣tempts, which wrought tendernes in som, but more scorn and fu∣ry in others, who fell upon the <HI>Capi Aga,</HI> with other Officers, and cut them in peeces before his eyes: <HI>Osman</HI> thence was carried to Prison, and as he was getting a horsback, a common soldier took off his Turban, and clapt <HI>his</HI> upon <HI>Osmans</HI> head, who in his pas∣sage begd a draught of water at a Fountain: The next day the new <HI>Visier</HI> went with an Executioner to strangle him, in regard ther were two younger brothers more of his to preserve the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>to∣mans</HI> race, where after they had rushd in, he being newly awakd, and staring upon them, and thinking to defend himself, a robust boysterous rogue knockt him down, and so the rest fell upon him and strangled him with much adoe.</P>
<P>Thus fell one of the greatest Potentats upon earth by the hands
<PB N="72" REF="89"/>
of a contemptible slave, for ther is not a free born subject in all that vast Empire: Thus fell he that Entitles himself most puissant and highest Monarch of the <HI>Turks,</HI> King above all Kings, a King that dwelleth upon the earthly Paridise, son of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> keeper of the grave of the Christian God, Lord of the Tree of Life, and of the River <HI>Flisky,</HI> Prior of the earthly Paridise, Conqueror of the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> the seed of great <HI>Alexander,</HI> Prince of the Kingdoms of <HI>Tartary, Mesopotamia, Media,</HI> and of the martiall <HI>Mammaluck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, Anatolia, Bithynia, Asia, Armenia, Servia, Thracia, Morta, Valachi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, Moldavia,</HI> and of all warlike <HI>Hungary,</HI> Soverain Lord and Com∣mander of all <HI>Greece, Persia,</HI> both the <HI>Arabia's,</HI> the most noble king∣dom of <HI>Egypt, Tremisen</HI> and <HI>African,</HI> Empire of <HI>Trab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>sond</HI> and the most glorious <HI>Constantinople,</HI> Lord of all the white and black Seas, of the holy City <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Medina,</HI> shining with divine glory, com∣mander of all things that are to be commanded, and the strongest and mightiest Champion of the wide world, a Warrior appoin∣ted by Heaven in the edge of the sword, a Persecutor of his Enemies, a most perfect jewell of the blessed Tree, the chie∣fest keeper of the crucified God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with other such bombar∣dicall Titles.</P>
<P>This <HI>Osman</HI> was a man of goodly Constitution, an amiable as∣pect, and of excesse of courage, but sordidly covetous, which drove him to violat the Church, and to melt the Lamps therof, which made the <HI>Mufti</HI> say that this was a due judgment faln upon him from Heaven for his Sacrilege. He us'd also to make his person too cheap, for he would go ordinarily in the night time with two men after him like a petty Constable, and peep into the Cauph∣houses and Cabarets, and apprehend Soldiers there. And these two things it seems was the cause, that when he was so assaulted in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> not one of his Domestic servants, wherof he had 3000, would li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t an Arm to help him.</P>
<P>Som few days before his death, he had a strange dream, for hee dreamt that he was mounted upon a great <HI>Camell,</HI> who would not go neither by fair nor foul means, and lighting off him, and thin∣king to strike him with his <HI>Cimitier,</HI> the body of the beast vanisht, leaving the Head and the bridle only in his hands; when the <HI>Muf∣ti</HI> and the <HI>Hoggies</HI> could not interpret this dream, <HI>Mustapha</HI> his Uncle did it, for he said, the <HI>Camell</HI> signified his Empire, his moun∣ting of him his excesse in Government, his lighting down his depo∣sing. Another kind of Prophetic speech dropt from the <HI>Grand Vi∣sier</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> our Ambassador there, who having gone a little before this Tragedy to visit the said <HI>Visier,</HI> told him what
<PB N="73" REF="89"/>
whisperings and mutterings there were in every corner for this <HI>A∣siatic</HI> voyage, and what ill consquences might ensue from it; ther∣fore it might well stand with his great wisdom to stay it; but if it held, he desir'd him to leave a charge with the <HI>Chimacham</HI> his De∣puty, that the <HI>English</HI> Nation in the <HI>Port,</HI> should be free from out∣rages: wherunto the <HI>Grand Visier</HI> answer'd, Trouble not your self about that, for I will not remove so far from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but I wil leave one of my legs behind to serve you, which prov'd too true, for he was murther'd afterwards, and one of his legs was hung up in the <HI>Hippodrome.</HI></P>
<P>This fresh Tragedy makes me to give over wondring at any thing that ever I heard or read, to shew the lubricity of <HI>mundan</HI> great∣nes, as also the fury of the vulgar, which like an impetuous Torrent gathereth strength by degrees as it meets with divers Dams, and being come to the hight, cannot stop it self: for when this rage of the soldiers began first, there was no design at all to violat or hurt the Emperor, but to take from him his ill Counsel∣lors, but being once a foot, it grew by insensible degrees to the ut∣most of outrages.</P>
<P>The bringing out of <HI>Mustapha</HI> from the Dungeon, where he was prisoner, to be Emperor of the <HI>Musulmans,</HI> puts me in mind of what I read in Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> of our late Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> how she was brought from the Scaffold, to the <HI>English</HI> Throne.</P>
<P>They who profess to be Criticks in policy here, hope that this murthering of <HI>Osman</HI> may in time breed good bloud, and prove advantageous to Christendom; for though this be the first Empe∣ror of the <HI>Turks</HI> that was dispatcht so, he is not like to be the last, now that the soldiers have this precedent: others think that if that design in <HI>Asia</HI> had taken, it had been very probable the <HI>Con∣stantinopolitans</HI> had hoisd up another King, and so the Empire had been dismembred, and by this division had lost strength, as the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Empire did, when it was broken into East and West.</P>
<P>Excuse me that this my Letter is become such a Monster, I mean that it hath past the sise and ordinary proportion of a Letter, for the matter it treats of is monstrous, besides it is a rule that Histori∣call Letters have more liberty to be long than others: In my next you shall hear how matters pass here, in the mean time, and always I rest</P>

<P>THe procedure of things in relation to the <HI>grand</HI> busines the match, was at kind of a stand when the long winded <HI>Iunta</HI> deliver'd their opinions, and fell at last upon this result, that his Catholic Majesty for the satisfaction of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> might oblige him∣self in the behalf of <HI>England,</HI> for the performance of those capitu∣lations which reflected upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholics in that Kingdom; and in case of non-performance, then to right himself by war; since that, the matrimoniall Articles were solemnly sworne unto by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and his Highness, the two Favorits, our two Ambas∣sadors, the Duke of <HI>Infantado</HI> and other Counsellors of State being present; hereupon the eighth of the next <HI>September,</HI> is appoin∣ted to be the day of Desposorios, the day of affiance, or the be∣trothing day; ther was much gladnes exprest here, and lumina∣ries of joy were in every great street throughout the City: but there is an unlucky accident hath interven'd, for the King gave the Prince a solemn visit since, and told him Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> was dead, who was so great a friend to the match, but in regard the bu∣sines was not yet com to perfection, he could not proceed further in it till the former Dispensation were ratified by the new Pope <HI>Vr∣ban,</HI> which to procure he would make it his own task, and that all possible expedition should be us'd in't, and therfore desir'd his pati∣ence in the interim. The Prince answer'd, and prest the necessity of his speedy return with divers reasons, he said ther was a generall kind of murmuring in <HI>England</HI> for his so long abseuce, that the King his Father was old and sickly, that the Fleet of shipe were already, he thought, at Sea to fetch him, the winter drew on, and withall that the Articles of the match were sign'd in <HI>England,</HI> with this <HI>proviso,</HI> that if he be not com back by such a month they should be of no validity. The King replyed, that since his Highness was resolv'd upon so suddain a departure, he would please to leave a <HI>Proxy</HI> be∣hind to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ish the marriage, and he would take it for a favor if he would depute <HI>Him</HI> to personat him, and ten days after the ratifica∣tion shal come from <HI>Rome</HI> the busines should be don, and afterwards
<PB N="75" REF="90"/>
he might send for his <HI>wife</HI> when he pleas'd. The Prince rejoyn'd, that amongst those multitudes of royall favors which he had re∣ceiv'd from his Majesty, this transcended all the rest, therfore hee would most willingly leave a <HI>Proxy</HI> for his Majesty and another for <HI>Don Carlos</HI> to this effect; so they parted for that time without the least ombrage of discontent, nor do I hear of any engendred since. The last month 'tis true the <HI>Iunta</HI> of Divines dwelt so long upon the busines, that ther were whisperings that the Prince intended to go away disguis'd as he came, and the question being ask'd by a per∣son of quality, ther was a brave answer made, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <HI>love</HI> brought him thither, it is not <HI>fear</HI> shall drive him away.</P>
<P>There are preparations already a foot for his return, and the two <HI>Prexies</HI> are drawn and left in my Lord of <HI>Bristolls</HI> hands. Notwith∣standing this ill favord stop, yet we are here all confident the busi∣nes will take effect: In which hopes I rest</P>

<P>I Receiv'd lately one of yours, but it was of a very old date: we have our eyes here now all fixd upon <HI>Rome,</HI> greedily expecting the Ratification, and lately a strong rumor ran it was com, in so much Mr <HI>Clerk</HI> who was sent hither from the Prince being a ship∣board, (and now lies sick at my Lord of <HI>Bristolls</HI> house of a Calen∣ture) hearing of it, he desired to speak with him, for he had som∣thing
<PB N="79" REF="92"/>
to deliver him from the Prince, my Lord Ambassador being com to him, Mr <HI>Clerk</HI> delivered a letter from the Prince; the con∣tents wherof were, that wheras he had left certain <HI>Proxies</HI> in his hand to be deliverd to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> after the Ratification was com, he desir'd and requir'd him not to do it till he should re∣ceive further order from <HI>England;</HI> my Lord of <HI>Bristoll</HI> hereupon went to Sir <HI>Walter Aston,</HI> who was in joynt Commission with him for concluding the match, and shewing him the Letter, what my Lord <HI>Aston</HI> said I know not, but my Lord of <HI>Bristoll</HI> told him that they had a Commission Royall under the broad Seal of <HI>England</HI> to conclude the match; he knew as well as he how earnest the King their Master hath bin any time these ten years to have it don; how ther could not be a better pawn for the surrendry of the <HI>Palatinat,</HI> than the <HI>Infanta</HI> in the Prince his arms, who would never rest till she did the work to merit love of our Nation: He told him al∣so how their owne particular fortunes depended upon't, besides if he should delay one moment to deliver the <HI>Proxy</HI> after the Ratifi∣cation was com according to agreement, the <HI>Infanta</HI> would hold her self so blemish'd in her honor, that it might overthrow all things. Lastly, he told him that they incurr'd the hazard of their heads if they should suspend the executing his Majesties Commission upon any order but from that power which gave it, who was the King him∣self; hereupon both the Ambassadors proceeded still in preparing matters for the solemnizing of the mariage: the Earl of <HI>Bristoll</HI> had caus'd above thirty rich Liveries to be made of watchet Vel∣vet, with silver lace up to the very capes of the Cloaks, the best sorts wherof were valued at 80 l. a Livery: My Lord <HI>Aston</HI> had also provided new Liveries, and a fortnight after the said politic re∣port was blown up, the Ratification came indeed complete and full; so the mariage day was appointed, a <HI>Terrass</HI> cover'd all over with Tapestry was rais'd from the Kings Palace to the next Church, which might be about the same extent, as from <HI>White-Hall</HI> to <HI>West∣minster Abbey,</HI> and the King intended to make his sister a <HI>Wife,</HI> and his daughter (wherof the Queen was deliver'd a little before) a <HI>Christian</HI> upon the same day; the <HI>Grandes</HI> and great Ladies had been invited to the mariage, and order was sent to all the Port Towns to discharge their great Ordnance, and sundry other things were prepar'd to honor the solemnity: but when wee were thus at the hight of our hopes, a day or two before; there came Mr. <HI>Killegree, Gresley, Wood</HI> and <HI>Davies,</HI> one upon the neck of another with a new Commission to my Lord of <HI>Bristoll</HI> immediatly from his Majesty, countermanding him to deliver the <HI>Proxy</HI> aforesaid, untill a full
<PB N="80" REF="93"/>
and absolut satisfaction were had for the surrendry of the <HI>Palatinat</HI> under this Kings hand and Seal, in regard he desir'd his Son should be married to <HI>Spain,</HI> and his Son in law remarried to the <HI>Palatinat</HI> at one time; hereupon all was dasht to peeces; and that frame which was rearing so many years, was ruin'd in a moment. This news strook a damp in the hearts of all people here, and they wisht that the Postillons that brought it, had all broke their necks in the way.</P>
<P>My Lord of <HI>Bristoll</HI> hereupon went to Court to acquaint the King with his new Commission, and so propos'd the restitution of the <HI>Palatinat,</HI> the King answer'd 'twas none of his to give, 'tis true he had a few Towns there, but he held them as Commissioner only for the Emperor, and he could not command an Emperor; yet if his Majesty of great <HI>Britain</HI> would put a Treaty a foot, hee would send his own Ambassadors to joyn; In the interim, the Earl was commanded not to deliver the foresaid <HI>Proxy</HI> of the Prince, for the desposorios or espousall untill <HI>Christmas:</HI> (And herein it seems his Majesty with you was not well inform'd, for those powers of <HI>Proxies</HI> expir'd before) the King here said further that if his Uncle the Emperor, or the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> would not be conformable to reason, he would raise as great an Army for the Prince <HI>Palsgrave▪</HI> as he did under <HI>Spinola</HI> when he first invaded the <HI>Palatinat;</HI> and to secure this, he would ingage his Contratation House of the West <HI>Indies,</HI> with his Plate Fleet, and give the most binding instrument that could be under his hand and Seal. But this gave no satisfa∣ction, therfore my Lord of <HI>Bristoll</HI> I beleeve hath not long to stay here, for he is commanded to deliver no more Letters to the <HI>Infan∣ta,</HI> nor demand any more audience, and that she should be no more stiled Princess of <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Wales.</HI> The foresaid Caution which this King offer'd to my Lord of <HI>Bristoll,</HI> made me think of what I read of his Grandfather <HI>Philip</HI> the second, who having been maried to our Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and it being thought she was with child of him, and was accordingly prayed for at <HI>Pauls</HI> Cross, though it proved af∣terward but a tympany, King <HI>Philip</HI> prepos'd to our Parliament that they would pass an Act that he might be Regent during his or her minority that should be born, and he would give good caution to surrender the Crown, when <HI>he</HI> or <HI>she</HI> should com to age: the motion was hotly canvas'd in the house of Peers, and like to pass, when the Lord <HI>Paget</HI> rose up and said, <HI>I, but who shall sue the Kings bond?</HI> so the busines was dasht.

Touching the procedure of matters here, you shall understand that my Lord <HI>Aston</HI> had speciall audience lately of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and afterwards presented a Memorial wherin ther was a high complaint against the miscarriage of the two <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadors now in <HI>England</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Inopifa</HI> and <HI>Don Carlos Coloma,</HI> the substance of it was that the said Ambassadors in a privat audience his Majesty of great <HI>Britain</HI> had given them, informd him of a perni∣cions plot against his Person and royall authority, which was that at the beginning of your now Parliament, the Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham</HI> with others his complices often met and consulted in a clan∣destin way, how to break the treatie both of <HI>Match</HI> and <HI>Palatinat:</HI> and in case his Majesty was unwilling therunto, he should have a Countrey house or two to retire unto for his recreation and health, in regard the Prince is now of years &amp; judgment fit to govern. His Majesty so resented this, that the next day he sent them many thanks for the care they had of him, and desird them to perfect the work, and now that they had detected the treason to discover also the trai∣tors, but they were shy in that point, the King sent again desiring them to send him the names of the Conspirators in a paper, seald up by one of their own confidents, which he would receive with his own hands, and no soul should see it els; advising them with∣all, that they should not prefer this discovery before their own ho∣nors, to be accounted false Accusers: they replied that they had don enough already by instancing in the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and it might easily be guest who were his Confidents, and Creatures. Hereupon his Majesty put those whom he had any grounds to sus∣pect to their oaths: And afterward sent my Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> and Sir <HI>Francis Cotington,</HI> to tell the Ambassadors that he had left no means unassaid to discover the Conspiration, that he had sound upon oath such a clearness of ingenuity in the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> satisfied him of his innocency: Therfore he had just cause to

conceive that this information of theirs, proceeded rather from ma∣lice and som politicall ends then from truth, and in regard they would not produce the Authors of so dangerous a Treason, they made themselves to be justly thought the Authors of it: And therfore though he might by his own royall justice, and the law of nations punish this excesse and insolence of theirs, and high wrong they had done to his best servants, yea to the Prince his Son, for through the sides of the Duke they wounded him, in regard it was impossible that such a design should be attempted without his privi∣ty, yet he would not be his own Judge herein, but would refer them to the King their Master whom he conceiv'd to be so just, that hee doubted not but he would see him satisfied, and therfore hee would send an express unto him hereabouts to demand Justice, and repara∣tion: this busines is now in agitation, but we know not what will become of it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOu have had knowledge (none better) of the progression and growings of the <HI>Spanish</HI> match from time to time; I must acquaint you now with the rupture and utter dissolution of it, which was not long a doing; for it was done in one audience that my Lord of <HI>Bristoll</HI> had lately at Court, whence it may be inferr'd, that 'tis far more easie to pull down, than reare up, for that stru∣cture which was so many years a rearing, was dasht as it were in a trice: Dissolution goeth a faster pace than Composition. And it may be said, that the civill actions of men, specially great af∣fairs of Monarchs (as this was) have much Analogie in degrees of progression with the naturall production of man. To make man there are many acts must procede, first a meeting and copulation
<PB N="84" REF="95"/>
of the Sexes, then Conception, which requires a well-disposed womb to retain the prolificall seed, by the constriction and occlusi∣on of the orifice of the <HI>Matrix,</HI> which seed being first bloud, and af∣terwards cream, is by a gentle ebullition coagulated, and turnd to a crudded lump, which the womb by vertue of its naturall heat pre∣pares to be capable to receive form, and to be organiz'd; wherup∣on Nature falls a working to delineat all the members, beginning with those that are most noble: as the Heart, the Brain, the Liver; wherof <HI>Galen</HI> would have the Liver, which is the shop and source of the bloud, and <HI>Aristotle</HI> the Heart to be the first fram'd, in re∣gard 'tis <HI>primùm vivens, &amp; ultimùm moriens:</HI> Nature continues in this labor untill a perfect shape be introduc'd, and this is call'd <HI>For∣mation</HI> which is the third act, and is a production of an organicall body out of the spermatic substance, caus'd by the plastic vertue of the vitall spirits: and somtimes this act is finisht thirty days after the Conception, somtimes fifty, but most commonly in forty two, or forty five, and is sooner don in the male. This being done, the <HI>Em∣bryon</HI> is animated with three souls; the first with that of Plants call'd the vegetable soul, then with a sensitive, which all brute A∣nimals have, and lastly, the Rationall soul is infus'd, and these three in man are like <HI>Trigonus</HI> in <HI>Tetragono;</HI> the two first are gene∣rated <HI>ex Traduce,</HI> from the seed of the Parents, but the last is by im∣mediat infusion from God, and 'tis controverted 'twixt Philosophers and Divines, when this infusion is made.</P>
<P>This is the fourth act that goeth to make man, and is called <HI>A∣nimation:</HI> and as the Naturalists allow <HI>Animation</HI> double the time that Formation had from the Conception, so they allow to the ripe∣ning of the <HI>Embryo</HI> in the womb, and to the birth therof treble the time that <HI>Animation</HI> had, which hapneth somtimes in nine, somtimes in ten months. This <HI>Grand</HI> busines of the <HI>Spanish</HI> match, may be said to have had such degrees of progression; first there was a meeting and coupling on both sides, for a <HI>Iunta</HI> in in <HI>Spain,</HI> and som select Counsellors of State were appointed in <HI>England;</HI> After this Con∣junction the busines was conceiv'd, then it receiv'd form, then life, (though the quickning was slow) but having had nere upon ten years in lieu of ten months to be perfected, it was infortunately strangled when it was ripe and ready for birth; and I would they had never been born that did it, for it is like to be out of my way 30: ol, And as the <HI>Embryo</HI> in the womb is wrapt in three mem∣branes or tunicles, so this great busines, you know better than I, was involv'd in many difficulties, and died so intangled before it could break through them.</P>

<P>YOur Lopps. of the third Current, came to safe hand, and being now upon point of parting with this Court I thought it worth the labor to send your Lopp<SUP>s</SUP> a short survey of the Monarchy of <HI>Spain;</HI> a bold undertaking your Lopp. will say, to comprehend within the narrow bounds of a Letter such a huge bulk, but as in the bosse of a small Diamond ring one may discern the image of a mighty mountain, so I will endeavour that your Lopp. may behold the power of this great King in this paper.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> hath bin alwaies esteemd a Countrey of ancient renown, and as it is incident to all other, she hath had her vicissi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>udes, and turns of Fortune: She hath bin thrice orecome; by the <HI>Romans,</HI> by the <HI>Goths,</HI> and by the <HI>Moors▪</HI> the middle conquest continueth to this day; for this King and most of the Nobility proses themselves to have descended of the <HI>Goths;</HI> the <HI>Moores</HI> kept here about 700. years, and it is a remark∣able Story how they got in first; which was thus upon good record. There raignd in <HI>Spain Don Rodrigo,</HI> who kept his Court then at <HI>Malaga;</HI> He emploid the Conde <HI>Don Julian</HI> Ambassador to <HI>Barbary,</HI> who had a Daughter, (a young beautifull Lady) that was maid of Honor to the Queen: The King spying her one day refreshing her self under an Ar∣bour, sell enamour'd with her, and never left till he had deslowrd her: She resenting much the dishonor, writ a letter to her Father in <HI>Barbary</HI> under this Allegory, <HI>That there was a fair green Apple upon the table, and the Kings poignard fell upon't and clest it in two. Don Iulian</HI> apprehending the meaning, got letters of revocation, and came back to <HI>Spain,</HI> wher he so complied with the King, that he became his Favorite: Amongst other things he advis'd the King that in regard he was now in Peace with all the world, he would dismisse his Gallies and Garrisons that were up and down the Sea coasts, because it was a su∣perfluous charge. This being don and the Countrey left open to any In∣vader, he prevaild with the King to have leave to go with his Lady to see their friends in <HI>Tarragona,</HI> which was 300. miles off: Having bin there a while, his Lady made semblance to be sick, and so sent to pe∣tition the King, that her daughter <HI>Donna Cava</HI> (whom they had left at Court to satiat the Kings lust) might com to comfort her a while;
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>
<HI>Cava</HI> came, and the gate through which she went sorth is call'd af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> her name to this day in <HI>Malaga: Don Iulian</HI> having all his chief kin∣dred there, he saild over to <HI>Barbary,</HI> and afterwards brought over the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and others with an Army, who suddenly invaded <HI>Spain,</HI> lying armles and open, and so conquer'd it. <HI>Don Rodrigo</HI> di∣ed gallantly in the field, but what became of <HI>Don Iulian,</HI> who for a particular revenge betrayed his own Countrey, no Story makes men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>. A few yeers before this happend, <HI>Rodrigo</HI> came to <HI>Toledo,</HI> where un∣der the great Church ther was a vault with huge Iron doors, and none of his Predecessors durst open it, because ther was an old Prophesie, <HI>That when that vault was open'd</HI> Spain <HI>should be conquered; Rodrigo</HI> slighting the Prophesie, caus'd the doors to be broke open, hoping to find there som Treasure, but when he entred, there was nothing sound but the pictures of <HI>Moores,</HI> of such men that a little after fulfilled the Pro∣phesie.</P>
<P>Yet this last conquest of <HI>Spain</HI> was not perfect, for divers parts North∣west kept still under Christian Kings, specially <HI>Biscay,</HI> which was ne∣ver conquer'd, as <HI>Wales</HI> in <HI>Britanny,</HI> and the <HI>Biscayners</HI> have much Analogy with the <HI>Welsh</HI> in divers things: They retain to this day the originall Language of <HI>Spain,</HI> they are the most mountainous people, and they are reputed the ancientst Gentry; so that when any is to take the order of Knighthood, ther are no Inquistors appointed to find whether he be cleer of the bloud of the <HI>Moors</HI> as in other places. The King when he comes upon the confines, pulls off one shoo before he can tread upon any <HI>Biscay</HI> ground: And he hath good reason to esteem that <HI>Province,</HI> in regard of divers advantages he hath by it, for he hath his best timber to build ships, his best Mariners, and all his iron thence.</P>
<P>Ther were divers bloudy battells 'twixt the remnant of Christians, and the <HI>Moors</HI> for seven hundreth yeers together, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> getting ground more and more, drive them at last to <HI>Granada,</HI> and thence al∣so in the time of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabella</HI> quite over to <HI>Barbary:</HI> their last King was <HI>Chico,</HI> who when he fled from <HI>Granada</HI> crying and wee∣ping, the people upbra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ded him, <HI>That he might well weep like a wo∣man, who could not defend himself and them like a man.</HI> (This was that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> who obtaind from <HI>Rome</HI> the Title of <HI>Catholic,</HI> though some Stories say that many ages before <HI>Ricaredus</HI> the first Ortho∣dox King of the <HI>Goths,</HI> was stil'd <HI>Catholicus</HI> in a Provinciall Synod held at <HI>Toledo,</HI> which was continued by <HI>Alphonsus</HI> the first, and then made hereditary by this <HI>Ferdinand.)</HI> This absolute conquest of the <HI>Moors</HI> hapned about <HI>Henry</HI> the sevenths time, 'when the soresaid <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI> and <HI>Isabella</HI> had by alliance joynd <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Aragon,</HI> which with the discovery of the <HI>West Indies,</HI> which happend a little after,
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>
was the first foundation of that greatnes wherunto <HI>Spain</HI> is now moun∣ted. Afterwards ther was an alliance with <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Austria,</HI> by the first House the seventeen <HI>Provinces</HI> fell to <HI>Spain,</HI> by the second <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth came to be Emperor: and remarkable it is how the House of <HI>Austria</HI> came to that height from a mean Earl, the Earl of <HI>Hasburgh</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI> who having bin one day a hunting, he over∣took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Priest who had bin with the Sacrament to visit a poor sick body, the Priest being tyr'd, the Earl lighted off his horse, helpt up the Priest, and so waited upon him afoot all the while till he brought him to the Church: The Priest giving him his benediction at his going away, told him that for this great act of humility and piety, <HI>His Race should be one of the greatest that ever the world had,</HI> and ever since, which is som 240. yeers ago, the Empire hath continued in that House, which afterwards was calld the House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Philip</HI> the seconds time the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy came to its highest cumble, by the conquest of <HI>Portugall,</HI> wherby the <HI>East Indies,</HI> sun∣dry Islands in the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Sea, and divers places in <HI>Barbary</HI> were ad∣ded to the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI> By these steps this Crown came to this Grandeur; and truly give the <HI>Spaniard</HI> his due, he is a mighty Mo∣narch, he hath Dominions in all parts of the world (which none of the four Monarchies had) both in <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> (which he hath solely to himself) though our <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh had the first proffer made him: So the Sun shines all the foure and twenty houres of the naturall day upon som part or other of his countreys, for part of the <HI>Antipodes</HI> are subject to him. He hath eight Viceroys in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> two in the <HI>East Indies,</HI> two in the <HI>West,</HI> two in <HI>Afric,</HI> and about thirty provinciall soverain Commanders more; yet as I was told lately, in a discours twixt him and our Prince at his being here, when the Prince sell to magnifie his spacious Dominions, the King answer'd, <HI>Sir, 'tis true, it hath pleas'd God to trust me with divers Nations and Countreys, but of all these ther are but two which yeeld me any clear revenues,</HI> viz. Spain, <HI>and my</HI> West Indies, <HI>nor all</HI> Spain <HI>neither, but</HI> Castile <HI>only, the rest do scarce quit cost, for all is drunk up twixt Governors and Garrisons; yet my advantage is to have the opportunity to propagate Christian Religion, and to employ my Subjects.</HI> For the last, it must be granted that no Prince hath better means to breed brave men, and more variety of commands to heighten their spirits with no petty but Princely employments. This King besides hath other means to oblige the Gentry unto him, by such a huge number of <HI>Commendams</HI> which he hath in his gift to bestow o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> whom he please of any of the three Orders of Knighthood; which <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>France</HI> want. Som Noble men in <HI>Spain</HI> can despend 50000 l.
<PB N="90" REF="98"/>
some forty, some thirty, and divers twenty thousand pounds per annum. The Church here is exceeding rich both in revenues, plate, and buildings; one cannot go to the meanest Countrey Chappell, but he will find Chalices, lamps and candlesticks of silver. There are some Bishopricks of 30000l. per annum, and divers of 10000 l. and <HI>Toledo</HI> is 100000 l. yearly re∣venue. As the Church is rich, so it is mightily reverenced here, and very powerfull, which made <HI>Philip</HI> the second rather depend upon the Clergy, than the secular Power: Therfore I do not see how <HI>Spain</HI> can be call'd a poor Countrey, considering the revenues aforesaid of Princes and Pre∣lats; nor is it so thin of People as the world makes it, and one reason may be that ther are sixteen Universities in <HI>Spain,</HI> &amp; in one of these there were fifteen thousand Students at one time when I was there, I mean <HI>Salamanca,</HI> and in this <HI>Village</HI> of <HI>Madrid</HI> (for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> cannot keep his constant Court in any <HI>City</HI>) there are ordinarily 600000 souls. Tis true that the colonizing of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the wars of <HI>Flan∣ders</HI> have much drain'd this Countrey of people: Since the expulsion of the <HI>Moors,</HI> it is also grown thinner, and not so full of corn; for those <HI>Moors</HI> would grub up wheat out of the very tops of the craggy hills, yet they us'd another grain for their bread, so that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had nought els to do but go with his Ass to the Market, and buy corn of the <HI>Moon.</HI> Ther liv'd here also in times past a great number of <HI>Jews,</HI> till they were expell'd by <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and as I have read in an old <HI>Spanish</HI> Legend, the cause was this; The King had a young Prince to his son, who was us'd to play with a <HI>Jewish</HI> Doctor that was about the Court, who had a Ball of gold in a string hanging down his brest, the little Prince one day snatcht away the said gold Ball, and carried it to the next room, the Ball being hollow, opend, and within there was painted our Savi∣our kissing a Iews tail: Hereupon they were all suddenly disterr'd and exterminated, yet I beleeve in <HI>Portugall</HI> there lurks. yet good store of them.</P>
<P>For the soil of <HI>Spain,</HI> the fruitfulnes of their vallies recompences the sterillity of their hills, corn is their greatest want, and want of rain is the cause of that, which makes them have need of their neighbors; yet as much as <HI>Spain</HI> bears is passing good, and so is every thing else for the quality, nor hath any one a better horse under him, a better cloak on his back, a better sword by his side, better shooes on his feet, than the <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI> nor doth any drink better Wine, or eat better fruit than he, nor flesh for the quantity.</P>
<P>Touching the People, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> looks as high, though not so big a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> a <HI>German,</HI> his excesse is in too much gravity, which som who know him not well, hold to be a pride, he cares not how little he labours, for poor <HI>Gascons</HI> and <HI>Morisco</HI> slaves do most of his work in field and vineyard;
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
he can endure much in the war, yet he loves not to fight in the dark, but in open day, or upon a stage, that all the world might be witnesses of his valor; so that you shall seldom hear of <HI>Spaniards</HI> employed in night service; nor shall one hear of a <HI>Duell</HI> here in an age: He hath one good quality, that he is wonderfully obedient to Government: for the prou∣dest <HI>Don</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> when he is prancing upon his Ginet in the streets, if an <HI>Alguazil</HI> (a Sargeant) shew him his <HI>Vare,</HI> that is a little white staff he carrieth as badge of his Office; my <HI>Don</HI> will down presently off his horse, and yeeld himself his prisoner. He hath ano∣ther commendable quality, that when he giveth Alms, he puls off his Hat, and puts it in the beggars hand with a great deal of humility. His gravity is much lessned since the late Proclamation came out against ruffs, and the King himself shewd the first example, they were come to that hight of excess herein, that twenty shillings were us'd to be paid for starching of a ruff: and som, though perhaps he had never a shirt to his back, yet would be have a toting huge swelling ruff about his neck. He is sparing in his Ordinary diet, but when he makes a Feast he is free and bountifull. As to Temporall Authority, specially Martiall, so is be very obedient to the Church, and beleeves all with an implicit faith: he is a great servant of Ladies, nor can he be blam'd, for as I said be∣fore he coms of a <HI>Gotish</HI> race; yet he never brags of, nor blazes a∣broad his doings that way, but is exceedingly carefull of the repute of any woman, (A civility that we much want in <HI>England</HI>) Hee will speak high words of <HI>Don Philippo</HI> his King, but will not endure a stranger should do so: I have heard a <HI>Biscayner</HI> make a <HI>Rodomonta∣do,</HI> that he was as good a Gentleman as <HI>Don Philippo</HI> himself, for <HI>Don Philippo</HI> was half a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> half a <HI>German,</HI> half an <HI>I∣talian,</HI> half a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> half I know not what, but he was a pure <HI>Biscayner,</HI> without mixture. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> is not so smooth and oyly in his Complement as the <HI>Italian,</HI> and though hee will make strong protestations, yet he will not swear out Complements like the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> as I heard when my Lord of <HI>Carlile</HI> was Ambassador in <HI>France,</HI> there came a great Monsieur to see him, and having a long time banded, and sworn Complements one to another who should go first out at a dore, at last my Lord of <HI>Carlile</HI> said, ô <HI>Mon∣seigneur ayez pitie de mon ame,</HI> O my'. Lord have pity upon my soul.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> is generally given to gaming, and that in excesse; he will say his prayers before, and if he win he will thank God for his good fortune after; their common game at cards (for they very seldom play at dice) is <HI>Primera,</HI> at which the King never shews his game, but throws his cards with their faces down on the Table: He is Merchant
<PB N="92" REF="99"/>
of all the cards and dice through all the Kingdom, he hath them made for a penny a pair, and he retails them for twelve pence; so that 'tis thought he hath 30000 l. a year by this trick at cards. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> is very devout in his way, for I have seen him kneel in the very dirt when the <HI>Ave Mary</HI> bell rings: and som if they spy two straws or sticks lie cross-wise in the street, they will take them up and kisse them, and lay them down again. He walks as if he marcht, and seldom looks on the ground, as if he contemnd it. I was told of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> who having got a fall by a stumble, and broke his nose, rose up, and in a disdainfull manner said, <HI>Voto a tal esto es caminar por la tierra,</HI> This is to walk upon earth. The <HI>Labradors</HI> and Countrey Swains here are stur∣dy and rationall men, nothing so simple or servile as the <HI>French Peasan who is born in chains.</HI> Tis true, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> is not so con∣versable as other Nations; (unlesse hee hath travel'd) els hee is like <HI>Mars</HI> among the Planets, impatient of Conjunction: nor is he so free in his gifts and rewards: as the last Summer it hapned that Count <HI>Gon∣damar</HI> with Sir <HI>Francis Cotington</HI> went to see a curious house of the Constable of <HI>Castiles,</HI> which had been newly built here; the keeper of the house was very officious to shew him every room with the garden, grotha's, and aqueducts, and presented him with some fruit; <HI>Gondamar</HI> having been a long time in the house, comming out, put many Complements of thanks upon the man, and so was going away, Sir <HI>Francis</HI> whis∣per'd him in the ear and askd him whether he would give the man any thing that took such pains, Oh quoth <HI>Gondamar,</HI> well remembred <HI>Don Francisco,</HI> have you ever a double Pistoll about you? If you have, you may give it him, <HI>and then you pay him after the</HI> English <HI>man∣ner, I have paid him already after the</HI> Spanish. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> is much improv'd in policy since hee took footing in <HI>Italy,</HI> and there is no Nation agrees with him better. I will conclude this Character with a saying that he hath▪</P>
<Q><L>No ay bombre debaxo d'el sol,</L>
<L>Como el <HI>Italiano</HI> y el <HI>Español.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>Wherunto a</HI> Frenchman answerd,</P>
<Q><L>Dizes la verdad, y tienes razon,</L>
<L>El uno es puto, el otro <HI>ladron.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>Englished thus,</HI></P>
<Q><L>Beneath the Sun ther's no such man,</L>
<L>As is is the <HI>Spaniard and Italian.</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB N="93" REF="99"/>The Frenchman answers,</P>
<Q><L>Thou tell'st the truth, and reason hast,</L>
<L>The first's a <HI>Theef,</HI> a <HI>Buggerer</HI> the last.</L></Q>
<P>Touching their women, nature hath made a more visible distinction twixt the two sexes here, than else where; for the men for the most part are swarthy and rough, but the women are made of a far finer mould, they are commonly little; and wheras there is a saying that to make a com∣pleat woman, let her be <HI>English</HI> to the neck, <HI>French</HI> to the wast, and <HI>Dutch</HI> below; I may add for hands and feet let her be <HI>Spanish,</HI> for they have the least of any. They have another saying, a <HI>French-woman</HI> in a dance, a <HI>Dutch-woman</HI> in the kitchin, an <HI>Italian</HI> in a window, an <HI>English-woman</HI> at board, and the <HI>Spanish</HI> a bed. When they are ma∣ried they have a privilege to wear high shooes, and to paint, which is ge∣nerally practised here, and the Queen useth it her self. They are coy e∣nough, but not so froward as our <HI>English,</HI> for if a Lady go along the street, (and all women going here vaild and their habit so generally like, one can hardly distinguish a Countess from a Coblers wife) if one should cast out an odd ill sounding word, and ask her a favour, she will not take it ill, but put it off and answer you with some wittie retort. After 30 they are commonly past child-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>earing, and I have seen women in <HI>England</HI> look as youthfull at 50, as some here at 25. Money will do miracles here in purchasing the favor of Ladies, or any thing els, though this be the Countrey of money, for it furnisheth well-near all the world besides, yea their very enemies, as the <HI>Turk</HI> and <HI>Hollander;</HI> insomuch that one may say the <HI>Coyn</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> is as <HI>Catholic,</HI> as her <HI>King.</HI> Yet though he be the greatest King of gold and silver Mines in the world, (I think) yet the common currant Coin here is Copper, and herein I beleeve the <HI>Hollander</HI> hath done him more mischief by counterfeiting his Copper Coins, than by their armes, bringing it in by strange surreptitious waies, as in hollow Sows of Tin and Lead, hol∣low Masts, in pitcht Buckets under water and other waies. But I fear to be injurious to this great King to speak of him in so narrow a com∣pass, a great King indeed, though the <HI>French</HI> in a slighting way com∣pare his Monarchy to a <HI>Beggars Cloak made up of patches,</HI> they are patches indeed, but such as he hath not the like: The <HI>East Indies</HI> is a patch embroyder'd with Pearl, Rubies, and Diamonds: <HI>Peru</HI> is a patch embroider'd with massie gold, <HI>Mexico</HI> with silver, <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Milain</HI> are patches of cloth of Tissue, and if these patches were in one peece, what would become of his cloak embroyderd with flower deluces?</P>

<P>YOu writ to me long since, to send you an account of the Duke of <HI>Ossuna's</HI> death, a little man, but of great fame and fortunes, and much cried up, and known up and down the World. He was revok'd from being Vice-roy of <HI>Naples</HI> (the best employ∣ment

Ther were divers accusations against him, amongst the rest, I remember these, <HI>That he had kept the Marquis</HI> de Campolataros <HI>wife, sending her husband out of the way upon employment; That he had got a bastard of a Turkish woman, and suffer'd the child to be brought up in the</HI> Mahumetan <HI>religion; That being one day at High Masse, when the host was elevated, he drew out of his pocket a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ece of Gold, and held it up, intimating that that was his god: That he had invited som of the prime Courtisans of</HI> Naples <HI>to a Feast, and after dinner made a banquet for them in his Garden, wher he commanded them to strip themselves stark naked, and go up and down, while he shot Sugar-Plums at them out of a Trunk, which they were to take up from off their high Chapins;</HI> and such like extra∣vagancies. One (amongst divers other) witty passage was told me of him, which was, That when he was Vice-roy of <HI>Sicily,</HI> ther died a great rich Duke, who left but one Son, whom with his whole estate, he bequeath'd to the Tutele of the Iesuits, and the words of the Will were, <HI>When he is pass'd his minority (Dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>te al mio figli∣volo quelque voi volete) you shall give my son what you will.</HI> It seems the Iesuits took to themselves two parts of three of the estate, and gave the rest to the heir, the young Duke complaining hereof to the Duke of <HI>Ossuna,</HI> (then Vice-roy) he commanded the Iesuits to appear before him; he ask'd them how much of the estate they would have, they answer'd, two parts of three, which they had almost employed already to build Monasteries, and an Hospitall, to erect particular Altars, and Masses, to sing Dirges and Refrigeriums, for the soul of the deceased Duke: Hereupon, the Duke of <HI>Ossuna</HI> caus'd the Will to be produc'd, and found therin the words afore recited, <HI>When he is pass'd his minority, you shall give my son (of my estate) what you will;</HI> Then he told the Iesuits, you must by vertue and tenor of these words, give <HI>what you will</HI> to the son, which by your own confession is two parts of three; and so he determin'd the bu∣sines.</P>

<P>It was my fortune to be on Sunday was fortnight at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> wher his late Majestie King <HI>Iames</HI> departed this life, and went to his last rest upon the <HI>day</HI> of <HI>rest,</HI> presently after Sermon was don: A little before the break of day, he sent for the Prince, who rose out of his bed, and came in his Night-Gown; the King seem'd to have som earnest thing to say unto him, and so endea∣vour'd to rowse himself upon his Pillow, but his spirits were so spent, that he had not strength to make his words audible. He di∣ed of a Feaver which began with an Ague, and som <HI>Scotch</HI> Doctors mutter at a Plaster the Countess of <HI>Buckingham</HI> applied to the outside of his stomack: Tis thought the last breach of the march with <HI>Spain,</HI> which for many yeers he had so vehemently de∣fir'd, took too deep an impression in him, and that he was forc'd to rush into a war, now in his declining Age, having liv'd in a con∣tinuall uninterrupted peace his whole life, except som collaterall aydes he had sent his Son in Law: as soon as he expir'd, the Pri∣vy Counsell sate, and in less then a quarter of an hour, King <HI>Charls</HI> was proclaimed at <HI>Theobalds</HI> Court Gate, by Sir <HI>Edward Zouch</HI> Knight Marshall, Master Secretary <HI>Conway</HI> dictating unto him, <HI>That wheras it hath pleas'd God to take to his mercy, our most gracious Soveraign King</HI> Iames <HI>of famous memory, We proclaim Prince</HI> Charles, <HI>His rightfull and indubitable Heir, to be King of</HI> England, Scotland, France, <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Knight Marshall mi∣stook, saying, <HI>His rightfull and dubitable Heir,</HI> but he was rectified by the Secretary. This being don, I took my Horse instantly, and came to <HI>London</HI> first, except one, who was com a little before me, insomuch, that I found the Gates shut. His now Majesty took Coach, and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> with him, and came to Saint <HI>Iames;</HI> In the evening he was proclaim'd at <HI>White-Hall</HI> Gate, in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> and other places, in a sad showre of Rain; and the Weather was sutable to the condition wherin he finds the King∣dome which is Cloudy; for he is left engag'd in a War with a po∣tent

<P>The Plague is begun in <HI>White-Chappell,</HI> and as they say in the same house, at the same day of the moneth, with the same num∣ber that died twenty two yeers since, when Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> de∣parted.</P>

<P>I am not setled yet in any stable condition, but I lie Windbound at the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> expecting som gentle gale to launch out into an imployment.</P>

<P>My Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon</HI> is lately dead of a long languishing weaknes; he died so poor, so that he scarce left money to bury him, which though he had a great <HI>Wit,</HI> did argue no great <HI>Wisdom,</HI> it being one of the essentiall properties of a Wiseman to provide for the main chance. I have read, that it hath bin the fortunes of all
<PB N="108" REF="107"/>
<HI>Poets</HI> commonly to die Beggars; but for an <HI>Orator,</HI> a <HI>Lawyer,</HI> and <HI>Philosopher,</HI> as he was, to die so, 'cis rare. It seems the same fate befell him, that attended <HI>Demosthenes, Seneca,</HI> and <HI>Cicero,</HI> (all great men) of whom, the two first fell by <HI>corruption;</HI> the falrest Diamond may have a flaw in it, but I beleeve he died poor out of a contempt of the pelf of Fortune, as also out of an exeess of genero∣sity, which appear'd, as in divers other passages, so once when the King had sent him a Stag, he sent up for the Underkeeper, and having drunk the Kings health unto him in a great Silver. Guilt-Bowl, he gave it him for his fee.</P>
<P>He writ a pittifull Letter to King <HI>Iames,</HI> not long before his death, and concludes, <HI>Help me dear Soverain Lord and Master, and pity me so far, that I who have bin born to a Bag, be not now in my age forc'd in effect to bear a Wallet; nor I that desire to live to study, may be driven to study to live:</HI> Which words, in my opinion, argued a little abjection of spirit, as his former Letter to the Prince did of prophanes, wherin <HI>be hoped, that as the Father was his Creater, the Son will be his Redeemer.</HI> I write not this to derogat from the no∣ble worth of the Lord Viscount <HI>Verulam,</HI> who was a rare man, a man <HI>Reconditae scientiae, &amp; ad salutem literarum natus,</HI> and I think the eloquentst that was born in this Isle. They say he shall be the last Lord Chancelor, as Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> was the last Lord Chief Iustice of <HI>England;</HI> for ever since they have bin term'd Lord Chief Iustices of the Kings Bench; so hereafter ther shall be onely <HI>Ket∣pers</HI> of the Great Seal, which for Title and Office, are deposable; but they say the Lord <HI>Chancelors</HI> Title is indelible.</P>
<P>I was lately at <HI>Grayes-Inne</HI> with Sir <HI>Eubule,</HI> and he desir'd me to remember him unto you, as I do also salute <HI>Meum</HI> Prichardum <HI>ex imis</HI> praecordiis, <HI>Vale</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>

<P>YOu have a great work in hand, for you write unto me, that you are upon a treaty of mariage; a great work indeed, and
<PB N="109" REF="107"/>
a work of such consequence, that it may <HI>make</HI> you or <HI>marr</HI> you; it may make the whole remainder of your life uncouth, or comforta∣ble to you; for of all civill actions that are incident to man, ther's not any that tends more to his infelicity or happines; therfore it concerns you not to be over-hasty herein, not to take the <HI>Ball before the Bound;</HI> you must be cautious how you thrust your neck into such a yoke, whence you will never have power to withdraw it a∣gain; for the <HI>toung</HI> useth to tie so hard a knot, that the <HI>teeth</HI> can never untie, no not <HI>Alexanders</HI> Sword can cut asunder among us Christians. If you are resolv'd to marry, <HI>Choose wher you love, and resolve to love your choice;</HI> let <HI>love,</HI> rather than <HI>lucre,</HI> be your guide in this election, though a concurrence of both be good, yet for my part, I had rather the latter should be wanting than the first; the one is the <HI>Pilot,</HI> the other but the <HI>Ballast</HI> of the Ship which should carry us to the <HI>Harbour</HI> of a happy life: If you are bent to wed, I wish you another gets wife then <HI>Socrates</HI> had; who when she had scoulded him out of doors, as he was going through the Portall, threw a Chamber pot of stale Urine upon his head, wherat the Philosopher having bin silent all the while, smilingly said, <HI>I thought ofter so much Thunder we should have Rain:</HI> And as I wish you may not light upon such a <HI>Xantippe,</HI> (as the wisest men have had ill luck in this kind, as I could instance in two of our most eminent <HI>Lawyers, C. B.</HI>) so I pray that God may deliver you from a Wife of such a generation, that <HI>Strowd</HI> our Cook here at <HI>Westminster</HI> said his Wife was of, who, when (out of a mislike of the Preacher) he had on a Sunday in the Afternoon, gon out of the Church to a Tavern, and returning towards the Evening pretty well heated with <HI>Canary,</HI> to look to his Roast, and his Wife falling to read him a lowd lesson in so furious a manner, as if she would have basted him insteed of the <HI>Mutton,</HI> and amongst other revi∣lings, telling him often, <HI>Thut the devill, the devill would fetch him,</HI> at last he broke out of a long silence, and told her, <HI>I prethee good Wife hold thy self content, for I know the devill will do me no hurt, for I have married his Kinswoman:</HI> If you light upon such a Wife (a Wife that hath more <HI>bene</HI> then <HI>flesh</HI>) I wish you may have the same measure of patience that <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Strowd</HI> had, to suf∣fer <HI>the Gray-Mare</HI> somtimes to be <HI>the better Horse.</HI> I remember a <HI>French</HI> Proverb:</P>
<Q><L>La Maison est miserable &amp; Meschante,</L>
<L>Où la Poule plus haut que le Coc chante,</L></Q>
<Q><PB N="110" REF="108"/>
<L>That House doth every day more wretched grow,</L>
<L>Wher the Hen lowder than the Cock doth crow.</L></Q>
<P>Yet we have another <HI>English</HI> Proverb almost counter to this▪ <HI>That it is better to marry a Shrew then a Sheep;</HI> for though <HI>silence be the dumb Orator of beuty, and the best ornament of a Woman, yet a Phleg∣matic dull wife is fulsom and fastidious.</HI></P>
<P>Excuse me Cousin, that I Jest with you in so serious a busines: I know you need no counsell of mine herein, you are discreet enough of your self; nor, I presume, do you want advice of Pa∣rents, which by all means must go along with you: So wishing you all conjugall joy, and a happy <HI>confarreation,</HI> I rest</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> is lately return'd from <HI>Holland,</HI> ha∣ving renewed the peace with the States, and Articled with them for a continuation of som Navall forces, for an expedition against <HI>Spain;</HI> as also having taken up som moneys upon privat jewells (not any of the Crowns) and lastly, having comforted the Lady <HI>Elizabeth</HI> for the decease of his late Majesty her Father, and of Prince <HI>Frederic</HI> her eldest Son, whole disasterous manner of death, amongst the rest of her sad afflictions, is not the least: For passing over <HI>Haerlam Mere,</HI> a huge Inland Lough, in compa∣ny of his Father, who had bin in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to look how his bank of money did thrive, and coming (for more frugality) in the common Boat, which was oreset with Merchandize, and other passengers, in a thick Fog, the Vessell turn'd ore, and so many perish'd; the Prince <HI>Palsgrave</HI> sav'd himself by swimming, but the young Prince clinging to the Mast, and being intangled among the Tacklings, was half drown'd, and half frozen to death: A sad de∣stiny.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="108"/>Ther is an open rupture twixt us and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> though he gives out, that he never broke with us to this day: Count <HI>Gonda∣mar</HI> was on his way to <HI>Flanders,</HI> and thence to <HI>England</HI> (as they say) with a large Commission to treat, for a surrender of the <HI>Pa∣lainat,</HI> and so to peece matters together again; but he died in the journey, at a place call'd <HI>Bunnol,</HI> of pure apprehensions of grief, as it is given out.</P>
<P>The match twixt his Majesty and the Lady <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> youngest Daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> the great (the eldest being maried to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the second to the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>) goes roundly on, and is in a manner concluded; wherat the Count of <HI>Soissons</HI> is much discontented, who gave himself hopes to have her; but the hand of Heaven hath predestin'd her for a far higher condi∣tion.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors who were sent hither to conclude the busines, having privat audience of his late Majesty a little before his death, he told them pleasantly, <HI>That he would make war against the Lady</HI> Henrietta, <HI>because she would not receive the two Letters which were sent her, one from himself, and the other from his son, but sent them to her Mother; yet he thought he should easily make peace with her, because he understood she had afterwards put the latter Letter in her bosome, and the first in her Coshionet, wherly he gather'd, that she intended to reserve his son for her Affection, and him for Coun∣sell.</HI></P>
<P>The Bishop of <HI>Lucon,</HI> now Cardinall <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> is grown to be the sole Favorit of the King of <HI>France,</HI> being brought in by the Queen-Mother, he hath hin very active in advancing the match, but 'tis thought the wars will break out afresh against them of the Religion, notwithstanding the ill fortune the King had be∣fore <HI>Mountauban</HI> few yeers since, wher he lost above 500 of his No∣bles, wherof the great Duke of <HI>Main</HI> was one; and having lain in person before the Town many months, and receiv'd som af∣fronts, as that inscription upon their Gates shew, <HI>Roy sans foy, vil∣le sans peur, a King without faith, a town without fear;</HI> yet he was forc'd to raze his works, and raise his siege.</P>
<P>The Letter which Mr. <HI>Ellis Hicks</HI> brought them of <HI>Mountauban</HI> from <HI>Rechell,</HI> through so much danger, and with so much gallan∣try, was an infinit advantage unto them; for wheras ther was a politic report rais'd in the Kings Army, and blown into <HI>Mountau∣ban,</HI> that <HI>Rochell</HI> was yeelded to the Count of <HI>Soissons,</HI> who lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hen before her, this Letter did inform the contrary, and that <HI>Rochell</HI> was in as good a plight as ever; wherupon, they made a sally the
<PB N="112" REF="109" MS="y"/>
next day upon the Kings Forces, and did him a great deal of spoil.</P>
<P>Ther be summous out for a Parliament, I pray God it may prove more prosperous than the former.</P>
<P>I have been lately recommended to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> by som noble friends of mine that have intimacy with him, about whom, though he hath three Secretaries already, I hope to have som employment; for I am weary of walking up and down so idly upon <HI>London</HI> streets.</P>

<P>I Convers'd lately with a Gentleman that came from <HI>France,</HI> who amongst other things, discours'd much of the Favourit <HI>Richelieu,</HI> who is like to be an active man, and hath great designs.

<P>Monsieur is lately maried to <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Mon∣pensiers</HI> Daughter, he told her, <HI>That he would be a better Husband, than he had been a Suter to her,</HI> for hee hung off a good while: This mariage was made by the King, and Monsieur hath for his apennage 100000 Liures, annuall Rent from <HI>Chartres</HI> and <HI>Blois,</HI> 100000 Liures Pension, and 500000 to be charg'd yearly upon the generall receipts of <HI>Orleans,</HI> in all about 70000 pounds.

<P>For forrain tidings, your Lordship may understand, that the Town of <HI>Breda</HI> hath bin a good while making her last will and testament, but now ther is certain news com, that she hath yeel∣ded up the Ghost to <HI>Spinalo's</HI> hands after a tough siege of thirteen months, and a circumvallation of nee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>r upon twenty miles com∣pas.</P>
<P>My Lord of <HI>Southampton</HI> and his eldest son sickned at the siege, and died at <HI>Berghen;</HI> the adventrous Earl <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> see∣ming to tax the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> of slacknes to fight, was set upon a desperat Work, wher he melted his grease, and so being carried to the <HI>Hague,</HI> he died also: I doubt not but you have heard of Graye <HI>Maurice's</HI> death, which happen'd when the Town was pass'd cure, which was <HI>his</HI> more than the <HI>States,</HI> for he was Marquis of <HI>Breda,</HI> and had neer upon thirty thousand dollars annual rent from her: Therfore he seem'd in a kind of sympathy to sicken with his Town, and died before her. He had provided plentifully for all his Naturall children, but could not, though much importun'd by Doctor <HI>Roseus,</HI> and other Divines upon his death bed, be induc'd to make them legitimat by marying the mother of them, for the Law there is, That if one hath got children of any Woman, though unmaried to her, yet if he mary her never so little before his death, he makes her honest, and them all legitimat; but it seems, the Prince postpos'd the love he bore to his <HI>woman and chil∣dren,</HI> to that which he bore to his <HI>brother Henry;</HI> for had he made the children legitimat, it had prejudic'd the brother in point of command and fortunes; yet he hath provided very plentifully for them and the mother.</P>
<P>Grave <HI>Henry</HI> hath succeeded him in all things, and is a gallant Gentleman, of a <HI>French</HI> education and temper; he charg'd him
<PB N="118" REF="112" MS="y"/>
at his death to marry a young Lady, the Count of <HI>Solms</HI> Daughter, attending the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> whom he had long courted, which is thought will take speedy effect.</P>
<P>When the siege before <HI>Breda</HI> had grown hot, Sir <HI>Edward Vere</HI> being one day attending Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> he pointed at a rising place call'd <HI>Terbay,</HI> wher the enemy had built a Fort, (which might have bin prevented) Sir <HI>Edward</HI> told him, he fear'd that Fort would be the cause of the loss of the Town; the <HI>Grave</HI> spatter'd and shook his head, saying, 'twas the greatest error he had com∣mitted since he knew what belong'd to a Soldier; as also in mana∣ging the plot for surprising of the Cittadell of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> for he re∣pented that he had not imployed <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> in lieu of the slow Dutch who aym'd to have the sole honour of it, and were not so fit instruments for such a nimble peece of service. As soon as Sir <HI>Charls Morgan</HI> gave up the Town, <HI>Spinola</HI> caus'd a new Gate to be erected with this inscription in great Golden Characters.</P>

<P>I Send you my humble thanks for those worthy Hospitable fa∣vours you were pleas'd to give me at your lodgings in <HI>Westmin∣ster.</HI> I had yours of the fifth of this present, by the hands of Mr. <HI>Ionathan Field.</HI> The news which fills every corner of the Town at this time, is the sorry and unsuccessfull return that <HI>Wimbledons</HI> Fleet hath made from <HI>Spain:</HI> It was a Fleet that deserv'd to have had a better destiny, considering the strength of it, and the huge charge the Crown was at; for besides a squadron of sixteen <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> wherof Count <HI>William</HI> one of Prince <HI>Maurice's</HI> naturall Sons was Admirall, ther were above fourscore of ours; the grea∣test joynt navall power (of Ships without Gallies) that ever spred sail upon Salt-Water, which makes the World abroad to stand a∣stonish'd how so huge a Fleet could be so suddenly made ready.

properly to Sir <HI>Robert Mansell,</HI> Vice-Admirall of <HI>England,</HI> to have gon in case the High-Admirall went not; then they speak of the incertainty of the enterprize, and that no place was pitch'd upon to be invaded, till they came to the height of the South Cape, and to sight of shore, where the Lord <HI>Wimbledon</HI> first cal'd a Coun∣sell of War, wherin som would be for <HI>Malaga,</HI> others for Saint <HI>Ma∣ry-Port,</HI> others for <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> but most for <HI>Cales,</HI> and while they were thus consulting, the Countrey had an alarum given them; Add hereunto the blazing abroad of this expedition ere the Fleet went out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> for <HI>Mercurius Gallobelgicus</HI> had it in print, that it was for the Streights mouth; <HI>Now 'tis a rule, that great designs of State should be mysteries till they com to the very act of per∣formance, and then they should turn to exploits:</HI> Moreover, when the locall attempt was resolv'd on, ther wer seven ships (by the ad∣vice of one Captain <HI>Love</HI>) suffer'd to go up the River, which might have bin easily taken, and being rich, 'tis thought they would have defrayed well neer the charge of our Fleet, which ships did much infest us afterwards with their Ordnance, when we had ta∣ken the Forr of <HI>Puntall:</HI> Moreover, the disorderly carriage and excess of our Land-men (wherof ther were 10000) when they were put a shore, who broke into the Fryers Caves, and other Cellers of Sweet-Wines, wher many hundreds of them being surprizd, and found dead-drunk, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came and toar off their Ears, and Noses, and pluck'd out their Eies: And I was told of one merry fellow escaping, that kill'd an Asse for a Buck: Lastly, it is laid to the Admiralls charge, that my Lord <HI>de la Wares</HI> Ship being in∣fected, he should give order, that the sick men should be scatter'd in o divers ships, which dispers'd the contagion exceedingly, so that som thousands died before the Fleet return'd, which was don in a confus'd manner without any observance of Sea Orders: Yet I do not hear of any that will be punish'd for these miscarriages, which will make the dishonour fall more fouly upon the State: but the most infortunate passage of all was, that though we did nothing by Land that was considerable, yet if we had stayd but a day or two longer, and spent time at sea, the whole Fleet of Ga∣leons, and <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI> had faln into our mouths, which came presently in, close along the Coasts of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and in all likeli∣hood, we might have had the opportunity to have taken the rich∣est prize that ever was taken on salt-water.

<HEAD><HI>XVIII.</HI> To my Lord Duke of <HI>Buckinghams</HI> Grace at <HI>New-Market.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MAy it please your Grace to peruse and pardon these few Ad∣vertisements, which I would not dare to present, had I not hopes that the goodnes which is concomitant with your greatnes, would make them veniall.</P>
<P>My Lord, a Parliament is at hand, the last was <HI>boisterous,</HI> God grant that this may prove more <HI>calm:</HI> A rumor runs that ther are Clouds already ingendred, which will break out into a storm in the <HI>lower Region<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> and most of the drops are like to fall upon your Grace: This, though it be but vulgar Astrology, is not altogether to bee contemn'd, though I believe that His Majesties coun∣tenance reflecting so strongly upon your Grace, with the brightnes of your own innocency, may be able to dispell and scat∣ter them to nothing.</P>
<P>My Lord, you are a great Prince, and all eyes are upon your actions, this makes you more subject to envy, which like the Sun beams, beats alwayes upon rising grounds. I know your Grace hath many sage and solid heads about you; yet I trust it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> will prove no offence, if out of the late relation I have to your Grace, by the recommendation of such Noble personages, I put in also my Mite.</P>
<P>My Lord, under favor, it were not amiss if your Grace would be pleased to part with som of those places you hold, which have least relation to the Court, and it would take away the mutte∣rings that run of multiplicity of Offices, and in my shallow ap∣prehension, your Grace might stand more firm without an <HI>Anchor:</HI> The Office of High Admirall in these times of action requires one whole man to execute it, your Grace hath another Sea of busi∣nesses
<PB N="122" REF="114"/>
to wade through, and the voluntary resigning of this Of∣fice would fill all men, yea even your enemies, with admirati∣on and affection, and make you more a Prince, than detract from your greatnes: If any ill successes happen at Sea (as that of the Lord <HI>Wimbledons</HI> lately) or if ther be any murmur for pay, your Grace will be free from all imputations, besides it will afford your Grace more leasure to look into your own affairs, which lie con∣fus'd, and unsetled: Lastly, (which is not the least thing) this act will be so plausible, that it may much advantage His Majesty in point of Subsidy.</P>
<P>Secondly, it were expedient (under correction) that your Grace would be pleas'd to allot som set hours for audience and access of Suters, and it would be less cumber to your Self, and your Ser∣vants, and give more content to the World, which often mutters for difficulty of access.</P>
<P>Lastly, it were not amiss, that your Grace would settle a stan∣ding Mansion-house and Family, that Suters may know whither to repair constantly, and that your Servants evry one in his place, might know what belongs to his place, and attend accordingly; for though confusion in a great Family carry a kind of state with it, yet order and regularity gains a greater opinion of vertue and wisdom. I know your Grace doth not (nor needs not) affect popu∣larity: It is true, that the peoples love is the strongest Cittadell of a Soveraign Prince, but to a great subject, it hath often prov'd fatall; for he who pulleth off his <HI>Hat</HI> to the People, giveth his <HI>Head</HI> to the Prince; and it is remarkable what was said of a late infortunat Earl, who a little before Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> death, had drawn the Ax upon his own Neck, <HI>That he was grown so popular, that he was too dangerous for the times, and the times for him.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, now that your Grace is threatned to be heav'd at, it should behove evry one that oweth you duty and good will, to reach out his hand som way or other to serve you; Amonst these, I am one that presumes to doe it, in this poor impertinent Paper; for which I implore pardon, because I am</P>

<P>The Lord Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> is now in <HI>Paris</HI> accompanied with the Earl of <HI>Montgomerie,</HI> and hee went in a very splendid equipage.

<P>Touching the first, I refer my self to your Honours favourable opinion, and the Character which my Lord <HI>S.</HI> and others shall give of me▪ for the second, I hope to overcom it; for the third, I weigh it not, so that I may merit of my King and Countrey; for the last, I crave leave to deal plainly with your <HI>Lopp.</HI> that I am a Cadet, and have no other patrimony or support, but my bree∣ding, therfore I must breath by the imployment; And my Lord, I shall not be able to perform what shall be expected at my hands, under one hundred pounds a quarter, and to have bills of credit accordingly.

<HEAD><HI>XXVIII.</HI> To Mr. <HI>R. L.</HI> Merchant.</HEAD>
<P>I Met lately with <HI>I. Harris</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and I had not seen him two years before, and then I took him, and knew him to be a man of thirty, but now one would take him by his Hair to be near three∣score, for he is all turnd gray. I wonderd at such a Metamorpho∣sis in so short a time, hee told me 'twas for the death of his Wife, that nature had thus antidated his years, 'tis true that a weighty setled sorrow is of that force, that besides the contraction of the Spirits, it will work upon the radicall moisture, and dry it up, so that the Hair can have no moisture at the Root. This made me remember a Story that a <HI>Spanish</HI> Advocat told me, which is a thing very remarkable. <HI>When the Duke of</HI> Alva <HI>was in</HI> Brussels, <HI>about the beginning of the tumults in the</HI> Netherlands, <HI>he had sat down before</HI> Hulst <HI>in</HI> Flanders, <HI>and ther was a Provost Marshall in his Army, who was a Favorit of his; and this Provost had put som to death by secret Commission from the Duke: Ther was one Captain</HI> Bolea <HI>in the Armie, who was an intimat friend of the Provosts, and one evening late, he went to the said Captains Tent, and brought with him a</HI> Confessor, <HI>and an</HI> Executioner, <HI>as it was his custom; He told the Captain, that he was com to execut his Excellencies Commission, and Marshall Law upon him; the Captain started up suddenly, his hair standing at an end, and being struck with amazement, ask'd him wherin he had offended the Duke; the Provest answer'd, Sir I com not to expostulat the busines with you, but to execut my Commission, therfore I pray prepare your self, for ther's your</HI> Ghostly Father <HI>and</HI> Executioner: <HI>so he fell on his knees before the Priest, and having don, the</HI> Hangman <HI>going to put the Halter about his neck, the Provost threw it away, and breaking into a laughter, told him, ther was no such thing, and that he had don this to try his courage, how be could bear the terror of death, the Captain look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> ghastly up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> him, and said, then Sir get you out of my Tent, for you have don me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> very ill office: The next morning the said Captain</HI> Bolea, <HI>though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> young man of about thirtie, had his hair all turnd grav, to the admira∣tion of all the world, and of the Duke of</HI> Alva <HI>himself, who questio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> him about it, but he would confess nothing.

The Captain having obtaind this, went to the</HI> Warden <HI>and told him, that the Duke would com to vi∣sit the House the next day, and the chiefest occasion that mov'd him to it, was, that he had an unruly Provost about him, who was subject often∣times to fits of frenzie, and because he wisheth him well, he had tried divers means to cure him, but all would not do, therfore he would trie whether keeping him close in</HI> Bedlam <HI>for som days, would do him any good: The next day the Duke came with ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ffling train of Captains af∣ter him, amongst whom was the said</HI> Provost, <HI>very shining brave; being entred into the house, about the Dukes person, Captain</HI> Bolea <HI>told the</HI> Warden, <HI>pointing at the</HI> Provost, <HI>that's the man; so hee took him aside into a dark Lobby, wher he had plac'd som of his men, who muffled him in his Cloak, seiz'd upon his gilt Sword, with his Hat and Feather, and so hurried him down into a Dungeon: My</HI> Provost <HI>had lain there two nights and a day, and afterwards it happen'd that a Gentleman com∣ming out of curiosity to see the house, peep'd in at a small grate where the</HI> Provost <HI>was; The</HI> Provost <HI>conjur'd him as he was a Christian, to go and tell the Duke of</HI> Alva, <HI>his</HI> Provost <HI>was there clap'd up, nor could be imagin why. The Gentleman did the Arrand, wherat the Duke being astonish'd, sent for the</HI> Warden <HI>with his prisoner; so he brought my</HI> Provost en cuerpo <HI>Madman like, full of straws and Feathers before the Duke, who at the sight of him, breaking out into a laughter, ask'd the</HI> Warden, <HI>why he had made him his Prisener; Sir, said the</HI> War∣den, <HI>'twas by vertue of your Excellenci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s Commission brought me by Cap∣tain</HI> Bolea: Bolea <HI>step'd forth and told the Duke; Sir, you have ask'd me oft, how these hairs of mine grew so suddenly gray, I have not re∣veal'd it yet to any soul breathing, but now Ile tell your Excellency, and so sell a relating the passage in</HI> Flanders. <HI>And Sir I have been ever since beating my Brains how to get an equall revenge of him, and I thought no revenge to be more equall or corresponding, now that you see he hath made me old before my time, than to make him mad if I could, and had he staied som days longer close Prisoner in the</HI> Bedlam <HI>House, it might haply have wrought som impressions upon his</HI> pericranium: <HI>The Duke was so well pleas'd with the Story, and the wittines of the re∣venge, that he made them both friends; and the Gentleman who told me this passage, said, that the said Captain</HI> Bolea <HI>was yet living, so that he could not be less than ninety years of age.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Lay yesternight at the Post House at <HI>Stilton,</HI> and this morning betimes the Post-master came to my beds head and told me the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was slain; my faith was not then strong e∣nough to believe it, till an hour ago I met in the way with my Lord of <HI>Rutland</HI> (your Brother) riding Post towards <HI>London,</HI> it pleas'd him to alight, and shew me a Letter, wherin ther was an exact relation of all the circumstances of this sad Tragaedy.</P>
<P>Upon Saturday last, which was but next before yesterday being <HI>Bartholmew</HI> yeeve, the Duke did rise up in a well disposed hu∣mor out of his bed, and cutt a Caper or two, and being rea∣dy, and having been under the Barbers hands (wher the Murtherer had thought to have don the deed, for hee was lea∣ning upon the Window all the while) hee went to breakfast at∣tended by a great Company of Commanders, where Monsieur <HI>Soubize</HI> came unto him, and whispered him in the ear that <HI>Ro∣chell</HI> was relieved, the Duke seem'd to slight the news, which made som think that <HI>Soubize</HI> went away discontented; After Breakfast the Duke going out, Colonell <HI>Fryer</HI> stepped before him, and stopping him upon som busines, one Lieutenant <HI>Fel∣ton</HI> being behind, made a thrust with a common tenpeny knife over <HI>Fryers</HI> arm at the Duke, which lighted so fatally, that hee slit his heart in two, leaving the knife sticking in the body; The Duke took out the knife, and threw it away, and laying his hand on his Sword, and drawn it half out said, the Villain hath killd me (meaning as som think Colonell <HI>Fryer</HI>) for ther had been som difference 'twixt them, so reeling against a Chimney hee fell down dead; The Dutchess being with child hearing the noise below, cam in her night geers from her Bed Chamber, which was in an upper room, to a kind of Rayl, and thence beheld him weltering in his own bloud. <HI>Felton</HI> had lost his Hat in the croud, wherin ther was a Paper sowed, wherin he declared that the reason which mov'd him to this act was no grudg of his own, though hee had been far behind for

his pay, and had bin put by his Captains place twice, but in re∣gard he thought the Duke an enemy to the <HI>State,</HI> because he was branded in Parliament, therfore what he did was for the public good of his Countrey. Yet he got clearly down, and so might have gon to his horse which was tied to a hedg hard by, but he was so amazed that he missd his way, and so struck into the pastry, where though the cry went that som <HI>Frenchman</HI> had don't, he think∣ing the word was <HI>Felton,</HI> he boldly confessed twas he that had don the deed, and so he was in their hands, <HI>Iack Stamford</HI> would have run at him, but he was kept off by Mr. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> so being carried up to a Tower Captain <HI>Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e</HI> toare off his spurrs, and asking how he durst attempt such an act, making him beleeve the Duke was not dead, he answerd boldly that he knew he was dispatchd, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>was not he, but the hand of heaven that gave the stroak, and though his whole body had bin coverd over with armour of proof he could not have avoyded it. Captain <HI>Charles Price</HI> went Post presently to the King four miles off, who being at prayers on his knees when it was told him, yet he never stirrd, nor was he di∣sturbd a whit till all divine service was don. This was the relation as far as my memory could bear, in my Lord of <HI>Rutlands</HI> Let∣ter, who willd me to remember him unto your Ladyship, and tell you that he was going to comfort your neece (the Dutches) as fast as he could: and so I have sent the truth of this sad story to your Ladyship, as fast as I could by this post, because I cannot make that speed myself, in regard of som busines I have to dispatch for my Lord in the way; So I humbly take my leave, and rest</P>

<HEAD><HI>XII.</HI> To Captain <HI>Tho. B.</HI> from <HI>York.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>NOble Captain,</HI> Yours of the first of <HI>March</HI> was deliverd me by Sir <HI>Richard Scott,</HI> and I held it no profanation of this Sunday evening considering the quality of my subject, and having (I thank God for it) performed all Church duties, to employ som hours to <HI>meditat</HI> on you, and send you this frendly salute, though I confess in an unusuall monitory way. My dear Captain, I love you perfectly well, I love both your person and parts which are not vulgar, I am in love with your disposition which is generous, and I verily think you wer▪ never guilty of any Pusillanimous act in your life: Nor is this love of mine conferr'd upon you gra∣tis, but you may challenge it as your due, and by way of corre∣spondence, in regard of those thousand convincing Evidences you have given me of yours to me, which ascertain me, that you take me for a true frend: Now I am of the number of those, that had rather commend the vertue of an enemy, than soeth the vi∣ces of a friend; for your own particular, if your parts of vertue, and your infirmities were cast into a ballance, I know the first would much out-poise the other; yet give me leave to tell you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ther is one frailty, or rather ill favor'd custom that reigns in you, which weighs much, it is a humor of <HI>swearing</HI> in all your discour∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s, and they are not slight, but deep, far fetch'd Oathes that you are wont to rap out, which you use as flowers of Rhetoric to en∣force a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>aith upon the hearers, who beleeve you never the more, and you use this in cold bloud when you are not provok'd, which makes the humor far more dangerous; I know many, (and I can∣not say I my self am free from it God forgive me) that being trans∣ported with choler, and as it were made drunk with passion, by som sudden provoking accident, or extreme ill fortune at play will let fall Oaths and deep Protestations▪ but to belch out, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="147" REF="126"/>
send forth, as it were, whole volleys of Oaths and Curses in a calm humor, to verifie every triviall discours is a thing of horror. I knew a King that being cross'd in his game would amongst his Oaths fall on the ground, and bite the very earth in the rough of his passion; I heard of another King (<HI>Henry</HI> the fourth of <HI>France</HI>) that in his highest distemper would swear but <HI>Ventre de Saint Gris,</HI> by the belly of Saint <HI>Gris;</HI> I heard of an Italian, that having been much accustomed to blaspheme, was wean'd from it by a pretty wile, for having been one night at play, and lost all his money, after many execrable Oathes, and having offerd money to another to go out to face heaven and defie God, he threw himself upon a Bed hard by, and there fell asleep; The other Gamsters plaid on still▪ and finding that he was fast asleep, they put out the can∣dels, and made semblance to play on still, they fell a wrangling, and spoke so loud, that he awaked, he hearing them play on stil fell a rubbing his eyes, and his conscience presently prompted him that he was struck blind, and that Gods judgment had deservedly fallen down upon him for his blasphemies, and so he fell to sigh and weep pittifully, a ghostly Father was sent for, who undertook to do som acts of penance for him, if he would make a vow never to play again or blaspheme, which he did, and so the candles were lighted again, which he thought were burning all the while; so he becam a perfect Convert. I could wish this Letter might produce the same effect in you; Ther is a strong Text, that the curse of heaven hangs always over the dwelling of the swearer, and you have more fearfull examples of miraculous judgments in this particular, than of any other sin.</P>
<P>Ther is a little town in <HI>Languedoc</HI> in France that hath a multitude of the Pictures of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> up and down, but she is made to carry Christ in her right arm contrary to the ordinary custom, and the reason they told me was this, that two gamsters being at play, &amp; one having lost all his money, and bolted out many blasphemies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e gave a deep Oath that that whore upon the wall, meaning the pi∣cture of the blessed Virgin▪ was the cause of his ill luck, hereup∣on the child removed imperceptibly from the left arm to the right, and the man fell stark dumb ever after'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, thus went the tradition there; This makes me think upon the Lady <HI>Southwells</HI> news from <HI>Utopia</HI> that he who sweareth when he playeth at dice, may challenge his damnation by way of purchase. This in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>andous custom of Swearing I observe reigns in <HI>England</HI> lately more than any wher els, though the German in his highest puff of pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ion swear by a hundred thousand Sacraments, the Italian by the whore of God,
<PB N="148" REF="127"/>
the French by his death, the Spaniard by his flesh, the Westiman by his sweat, the Irish man by his five wounds, though the Scot com∣monly bids the devill hale his soule, yet for variety of Oaths the English Roarers put down all: Consider well what a dangerous thing it is to tear in pieces that dreadfull name which makes the vast fabric of the world to tremble, that holy name wherein the whol Hierarchy of Heaven doth triumph, that blisful name wher∣in consists the fulnes of all felicity. I know this custom in you yet, is but a light <HI>disposition,</HI> tis no <HI>habit</HI> I hope, let me therfore con∣jure you by that power of frendship, by that holy ligue of love which is between us, that you would suppress it before it com to that, for I must tell you that those who could find in their hearts to love you for many other things, do disrespect you for this, they hate your company, and give no credit to whatsoever you say, it being one of the punishments of a swearer as well as of a lyar not to be beleeved when he tells truth.</P>
<P>Excuse me that I am so free with you, what I write proceeds from the clear current of a pure affection, and I shall heartily thank you, and take it as an argument of love, if you tell me of my weaknesses, which are (God wot) too too many, for my body is but a Cargazon of corrupt humors, and being not able to overcome them all at once I do endeavor to doe it by degrees, like <HI>Sertorius</HI> his soldier who when he could not cut off the Horse tayl with his sword at one blow, fell to pull out the hair one by one: And touch∣ing this particular humor from which I disswade you, it hath rag'd in me too often by contingent fits, but I thank God for it I find it much abated, and purg'd. Now the only Physic I us'd was a precedent fast and recours to the holy Sacrament the next day, of purpose to implore pardon for what was pass'd, and power for the future to quell those exorbitant motions, those ravings and fea∣vourish fits of the soul, in regard ther are no infirmities more dangerous, for at the same instant they have <HI>being</HI> they becom im∣pieties. And the greatest symptom of amendment I find in mee is, because whensoever I hear the holy name of God blasphem'd by any other, it makes my heart to tremble within my brest: Now it is a penitentiall Rule <HI>that if sins present do not please thee, sins pass'd will never hurt thee.</HI> All other sins have for their object, ei∣ther pleasure or profit, or some ayme and satisfaction to body or mind, but this hath none at all, therfore fie upon't, my dear Cap∣tain t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e whether you can make a conquest of your self in subdu∣ing this execrable custom. <HI>Alexander</HI> subdued the World, <HI>Caesar</HI> his <HI>Enemies, Hercules▪ Monsters,</HI> but he that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ecomes himself

transported to a true Elysium all the while, ther were such flexa∣nimous strong ravishing strains throughout it. To deal plainly with you, it wer an injury to the public good, not to expose to open light such divine raptures, for they have an edifying power in them, and may be tearm'd the very quintessence of devotion; you discover in them what a rich talent you have, which should not be buried within the walls of a privat study, or pass through a few particular hands, but appear in public view, and to the sight of the world, to the enriching of others, as they did me in reading them. Therfore I shall long to see them pass from the Bankside to <HI>Pauls</HI> Churchyard, with other precious peeces of yours, which you have pleas'd to impart unto me</P>

<P>I Doubt not but your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ordship hath had intelligence from time time what firm invasions the King of <HI>Sweds</HI> hath made into <HI>Germany,</HI> and by what degrees he hath mounted to this height, ha∣ving but six thousand foot and five hundred horse, when he entred first to <HI>Meclenburg,</HI> and taken that Town while Commissioners stood treating on both sides in his tent; how therby his Army much encreas'd, and so rush'd further into the heart of the Countrey, but passing neer <HI>Magdenburg,</HI> being diffident of his own strength he suffer'd <HI>Tilly</HI> to take that great Town with so much effusion of bloud, because they would receive no quarter; your Lordship
<PB N="173" REF="139"/>
hath also heard of the battell of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> where <HI>Tilly</HI> notwithstan∣ding the Victory he had got ore the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> a few daies be∣fore, receav'd an vtter discomfiture, upon which victory the King sent Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> a present of two thousand pounds and in his letter calls him his <HI>strenuum consultorem,</HI> he being one of the first who had advis'd him to this <HI>German</HI> war after he had made peace 'twixt him and the <HI>Polander.</HI> I presume also your Lordship heard how he met <HI>Tilly</HI> again neer <HI>Auspurg,</HI> and made him go up∣on a woodden leg wher of he died, and after soundly plunder'd the <HI>Bavarian,</HI> and made him flee from his own house at <HI>Munchen,</HI> and rifled his very Closets.</P>
<P>Now your Lordship shall understand, that the said King is at <HI>Mentz,</HI> &amp; keeps a Court there like an Emperour, there being above twelve Ambassadors with him. The King of <HI>France</HI> sent a great Marquis for his Ambassador to <HI>put</HI> him in mind of his Articles, and to tell him that his Christian Majesty wondred he would cross the <HI>Rhine</HI> without his privity, and wondred more that he would invade the Church-lands, meaning the Archbishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> who had put himself under the protection of <HI>France;</HI> The <HI>Swed</HI> answer'd, That he had not broke the least title of the Articles agreed on, and touching the said Archbishop, he had not stood Neutrall as was promised, therfore he had justly set on his skirts. The Ambassa∣dor replied, in case of breach of Articles, his Master had eighty thousand men to pierce <HI>Germany</HI> when he pleas'd; The King an∣swer'd that he had but twenty thousand, and those should be soo∣ner at the walls of <HI>Paris,</HI> then his fourscore thousand should be on the frontiers of <HI>Germany.</HI> If this new Conquerer goes on with this violence, I beleeve it will cast the pollicy of all Christendom into another mould, and be get new maximes of State, for none can foretell wher his monstrous progress will terminat; Sir <HI>Henry Vane</HI> is still in <HI>Germany,</HI> observing his motions, and they write that they do not agree well; as I heard the King should tell him that he spoke nothing but <HI>Spanish</HI> to him: Sir <HI>Robert Anstruther</HI> is also at <HI>Vienna,</HI> being gon thither from the Diet at <HI>Ratisbon.</HI></P>
<P>I hear the Infante Cardinal is design'd to com Governor of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and passeth by way of <HI>Italy,</HI> and so through <HI>Ger∣many:</HI> his brother <HI>Don Carlos</HI> is lately dead. So I humbly take my leave, and rest</P>

<P>THough any comand from your Lordship be welcom to me at all times, yet that, which you lately injoynd me in yours of the twelfth of <HI>August,</HI> that I should inform your Lordship of what I know touching <HI>the Inquisition,</HI> is now a little unseasonable, be∣cause I have much to do to prepare my selfe for this employment to <HI>Germany,</HI> therfore I cannot satisfie you in that fulnes as I could do otherwise. The very name of the <HI>Inquisition</HI> is terrible all Christendom over, and the King of <HI>Spaint</HI> himself, with the chie∣fest
<PB N="178" REF="142"/>
of his <HI>Grandes</HI> tremble at it. It was sounded first by the Ca∣tholic King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> (our <HI>Henry</HI> the eighths Father-in-law) for he having got <HI>Granada,</HI> and subdued all the <HI>Moors,</HI> who had had firm sooting in that Kingdom about 700. years, yet he suffer'd them to live peaceably a while in point of conscience; but afterwards he sent a solemn <HI>Mandamus</HI> to the Jacobin Fryars to endeavour the conversion of them by preaching, and all other meanes; They finding that their paines did little good, (and that those whom they had converted turn'd Apostats) obtain'd power to make a re∣search, which afterwards was call'd <HI>Inquisition,</HI> and it was rati∣fied by Pope <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>xtus,</HI> that if they would not conform themselves by fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>anes, they should be forc'd to it. The Jacobins being sound too severe herein, and for other abuses besides, this <HI>Inquisition</HI> was taken from them, and put into the hands of the most sufficient Ec∣clesiasticks. So a Counsell was established, and Officers appoin∣ted accordingly: Whosoever was found pendulous and branling in his Religion was brought by a Serjeant call'd <HI>Familiar,</HI> before the said Counsell of <HI>Inquisition,</HI> His accuser or <HI>delator</HI> stands be∣hind a peece of Tapistry, to see whether he be the party, and if he be, then they put divers subtill and entrapping interrogatories unto him, and whether he confess any thing or no, he is sent to prison. When the said <HI>Familiar</HI> goes to any house, though it be in the dead of night (and that's the time commonly they use to com, or in the dawn of the day) all doors and trunks and chests fly open to him, and the first thing he doth he seizeth the parties breeches, searcheth his pockets, and take his keyes, and so rum∣mageth all his closets and trunks: and a public Notary whom he carrieth with him, takes an Inventory of every thing, which is sequestred and despositated in the hands of som of his next neigh∣bours; The party being hurried away in a close Coach, and clap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> in prison, he is there eight daies before he makes his appearance, and then they present unto him the Cross, and the Missall book to swear upon; if he refuseth to swear, he convinceth himself, and though he sweare, yet he is remanded to prison: This Oath commonly is presented before any accusation be produc'd; His Goaler is strictly comanded to pry into his actions, his deport∣ment, words, and countenance, and to ser spies upon him, and whosoever of his fellow prisoners, or others can produce any thing against him, he hath a reward for it: At last after divers appa∣rances, examinations, and scrutinies, the Information against him is read, but the witnesses names are conceal'd, then is he appoin∣ted a Proctor and an Advocat, but he must not confer or advise
<PB N="179" REF="142"/>
with them privatly, but in the face of the Court; The Kings At∣torney is a party in't, and the accusers commonly the solé witnes∣ses. Being to name his own Lawyers oftentimes others are disco∣vered and fall into trouble: while he is thus in prison, he is so abhor'd, and abandoned of all the world, that none will, atleast none dare visit him. Though one cleer himself, yet he cannot be freed, till an <HI>Act of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>aith</HI> pass; which is don seldom, but very so∣lemnly; Ther are few who having fallen into the gripes of the <HI>In∣quisition</HI> do scape the rack; or the <HI>Sambenito</HI> which is a streight yellow coat without sleeves, having the pourtrait of the Devill painted up and down in black, and upon their heads they carry a Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>er of paper, with a man frying in the flames of hell upon't, they gag their mouths, and tie a great cord about their necks: The Iudges meet in som uncouth dark dungeon, and the Executi∣oner stands by, clad in a close dark garment, his head and face cover'd with a Chaperon, out of which ther are but two holes to look through, and a huge Link burning in his hand: When the Ecclesiastic Inquisitors have pronounced the Anathema against him, they transmit him to the secular Iudges to receave the sen∣tence of death, for Church-men must not have their hands imbru'd in bloud, the King can mitigat any punishment under death, nor i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> a Noble-man subject to the rack.</P>

<P>The <HI>Hans</HI> or <HI>Hansiatic l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>gue</HI> is very ancient, som would de∣rive the word from <HI>hand,</HI> because they of the society plight their faith by that action: Others derive it from <HI>Hansa,</HI> which in the <HI>Gothic</HI> toung is Counsell: Others would have it com from <HI>Han der see,</HI> which signifies neer or upon the Sea, and this passeth for the best Etymology, because their Towns are all seated so, or upon som navigable River neer the sea. The extent of the old <HI>Hans</HI> was from the <HI>Nerve</HI> in <HI>Livonia</HI> to the <HI>Rhin,</HI> and contain'd 62 great <HI>Mercantil Towns,</HI> which were divided to four Precincts: The chiefest of the first Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>cinct was <HI>Lub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ck,</HI> wher the Archiss of their ancient Records, and their prime Chancery is still, and this Town is within that Verge: <HI>Cullen</HI> is chief of the second Precinct: <HI>Erurs∣wic</HI> of the third: and <HI>Danzic</HI> of the fourth. The Kings of <HI>Pe∣land</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> have sued to be their Protector, but they refus'd them, because they were not Princes of the Empire; they put off also the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> with a Complement, nor would they ad∣mit the King of <HI>Spain</HI> when he was most potent in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> though afterwards when 'twas too late, they desir'd the help of the <HI>Ragged Staff;</HI> nor of the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> notwithstanding that, the world thought he should have married our Queen, who interce∣ded for him, and so 'twas probable, that therby they might reco∣ver their privileges in <HI>England;</HI> so that I do not find they ever had any Protector, but the great Master of <HI>Prussia;</HI> and their want of a Protector did do them som prejudice in that famous difference they had with our Queen.</P>
<P>The old <HI>Hans</HI> had extraordinary immunities given them by our <HI>Henry</HI> the third, because they assisted him in his wars with so ma∣ny

ships, and as they pretend, the King was not only to pay them for the service of the said Ships, but for the Vessells themselves if they miscarried: Now it happen'd, that at their return to <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> from serving <HI>Henry</HI> the third, ther was a great Fleet of them cast away; for which, according to Covenant, they demanded re∣paration; Our King in lieu of money, amongst other Acts of Grace, gave them a privilege to pay but one <HI>per cent,</HI> which con∣tinued untill Queen <HI>Mories</HI> reign; and she by advice of King <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> her husband, as 'twas conceiv'd, enhanc'd the one to twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> The <HI>Hans</HI> not onely complain'd, but clamor'd loudly for breach of their ancient Privileges confirm'd unto them, time out of mind, by thirteen successive Kings of <HI>England,</HI> which they pre∣tended to have purchased with their money. King <HI>Philip</HI> undertook to accommode the busines, but Queen <HI>Mary</HI> dying a little after, and he retiring, ther could be nothing don▪ Complaint being made to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> she answerd, <HI>That as shee would not innovat a∣ny thing, so she would maintain them still in the same condition she found them:</HI> hereupon their Navigation and Trafic ceas'd a while: Wherfore the <HI>English</HI> tryed what they could do themselves, and they thrive so well, that they took the whole trade into their own hands, and so divided themselves (though they bee now but one) to <HI>Sta∣plers,</HI> and Merchant <HI>Adventurers,</HI> the one residing constant in one place, wher they kept their Magazin of Wool, the other stirring and adventuring to divers places abroad with Cloth, and other Manufactures; which made the <HI>Hans</HI> endevor to draw upon them all the malignancy they could from all Nations: Moreover the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns being a body politic incorporated in the Empire, com∣plain'd hereof to the Emperor, who sent over persons of great quality to mediat an accommodation, but they could effect nothing. Then the Queen caus'd a Proclamation to be punish'd, that the <HI>Easterlings</HI> or <HI>Merchants</HI> of the <HI>Hans,</HI> should be intreated and us'd as all other strangers were within her Dominions, without any mark of difference, in point of commerce. This netled them more, therupon they bent their Forces more eagerly, and in a <HI>Diet</HI> at <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> they procurd, that the <HI>English</HI> Merchants who had associ∣ated themselves into <HI>Fraternities</HI> in <HI>Embd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n,</HI> and other places, should bee declar'd <HI>Monopolists;</HI> and so ther was a <HI>Comitiall Edict</HI> publishd against them, that they should be exterminated, and ba∣nisht out of all parts of the Empire, and this was don by the acti∣vity of one <HI>Suderman</HI> a great <HI>Civilian;</HI> Ther was there for the Queen <HI>Gilpin,</HI> as nimble a man as <HI>Suderman,</HI> and he had the Chan∣celor of <HI>Embden</HI> to second and countenance him, but they could
<PB N="185" REF="145"/>
not stop the said <HI>Edict</HI> wherin the Society of <HI>English</HI> Merchants Ad∣venturers was pronounc'd to bee a <HI>Monopoly;</HI> yet <HI>Gilpin</HI> plaid his game so well, that he wrought under hand, that the said Imperiall <HI>Ban</HI> should not be publish'd till after the dissolution of the <HI>Diet,</HI> and that in the interim, the Emperor should send Ambassadors to <HI>England,</HI> to advertise the Queen of such a <HI>Ban</HI> against her Mer∣chants: But this wrought so little impression upon the Queen, that the said <HI>Ban</HI> grew rather ridiculous than formidable, for the Town of <HI>Embden</HI> harbour'd our Merchants notwithstanding, and after∣wards <HI>Stode,</HI> but they not being able to protect them so well from the Imperiall <HI>Ban,</HI> they setled in this Town of <HI>Hamburgh:</HI> After this, the Queen commanded another Proclamation to be divulg'd, that the <HI>Easterlings</HI> or <HI>Hansiatic</HI> Merchants should bee allowed to Trade in <HI>England</HI> upon the same conditions, and payment of duties, as her own Subjects; provided, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the <HI>English</HI> Merchants might have interchangeable privilege, to reside and trade peace∣ably in <HI>Stode</HI> or <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> or any wher els, within the precincts of the <HI>Hans:</HI> This incens'd them more, therupon they resolv'd to cut off <HI>Stode</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh</HI> from being members of the <HI>Hans,</HI> or of the Empire; but they suspended this dessein, till they saw what success the great <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet should have, which was then preparing in the yeer eighty eight, for they had not long before had recours to the King of <HI>Spain▪</HI> and made him their own, and he had don them som materiall good Offices; wherfore to this day the <HI>Spanish</HI> Counsell is tax'd of improvidence, and imprudence, that ther was no use made of the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns in that expedi∣tion.</P>
<P>The Queen finding that they of the <HI>Hans</HI> would not be con∣tented with that equality she had offer'd 'twixt them and her own Subjects, put out a <HI>Proclamation,</HI> that they should carry neither Corn, Victualls, Arms, Timber, Masts, Cables, Mineralls, nor any other materialls or Men to <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugall.</HI> And after the Queen growing more redoubtable and famous, by the over∣throw of the Fleet of <HI>Eighty eight,</HI> the <HI>Osterlings</HI> fell to despair of doing any good: Add hereunto another disaster that befell them, the taking of sixty sailes of their Ships about the mouth of <HI>Tagus</HI> in <HI>Portugall,</HI> by the Queens Ships that were laden with <HI>Ropas de contrabando, viz.</HI> Goods prohibited by her former <HI>Proclamation</HI> into the dominions of <HI>Spain:</HI> And as these Ships were upon point of being discharg'd, she had intelligence of a great Assembly at <HI>Lub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ck,</HI> which had met of purpose to consule of means to be reveng'd of her; therupon she staid and seiz'd upon

the said sixty Ships, only two were freed to bring news what became of the rest. Hereupon the <HI>Pole</HI> sent an Ambassador to her, who spake in a high tone, but he was answer'd in a higher.</P>
<P>Ever since our Merchants have beaten a peacefull and free un∣interrupted Trade into this Town, and elswhere within and with∣out the <HI>Sound,</HI> with their Manufactures of Wool, and found the way also to the White-Sea to <HI>Archangel</HI> and <HI>Mosco:</HI> Insomuch, that the premisses being well considered, it was a happy thing for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> that that clashing fell out 'twixt her and the <HI>Hans,</HI> for it may be said to have been the chief ground of that Shipping and Mer∣chandising, which she is now com to, and wherwith she hath flou∣rish'd ever since: But one thing is observable, that as that Impe∣riall or <HI>Comitial Bat,</HI> pronounc'd in the <HI>Diet</HI> at <HI>Ratisbon</HI> against our Merchants and Manufactures of Wooll, incited them more to industry: So our <HI>Proclamation</HI> upon Alderman <HI>Cockeins</HI> project of transporting no white Cloths but Died, and in their full manufa∣cture, did cause both <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>German</HI> to turn <HI>necessity</HI> to a <HI>ver∣tue,</HI> and made them far more ingenious to find ways, not only to Die, but to make Cloth, which hath much impair'd our Markers ever since; for ther hath not been the third part of our Cloth sold since, either here or in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, I pray be pleas'd to dispense with the prolixity of this Discours, for I could not wind it up closer, nor on a lesser bottom; I shall be carefull to bring with me those <HI>Furrs</HI> I had instructions for: So I rest</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am newly return'd from <HI>Germany,</HI> whence ther came lately two Ambassadors extraordinary in one of the Ships Royall, the Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Anstruther;</HI> the latter came from <HI>Vien∣na,</HI> and I know little of his negotiations; but for my Lord of <HI>Leicester,</HI> I beleeve ther was never so much busines dispatch'd in so short a compas of time, by any Ambassador, as your Lordship, who is best able to judg, will find by this short relation: When my Lord was com to the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> Court, which was then at <HI>Rhensberg,</HI> a good way within <HI>Holstein:</HI> The first thing he did, was to condole the late Queen <HI>Dowagers</HI> death (our Kings Gran-Mother) which was don in such an equipage, that the <HI>Danes</HI> con∣fess'd, ther was never Queen of <HI>Denmark</HI> so mourn'd for: This cere∣mony being pass'd, my Lord fell to busines; and the first thing which he propounded, was, That for preventing of further effusion of Christian blood in <HI>Germany,</HI> and for the facilitating a way to re∣store peace to all Christendom, His Majesty of <HI>Denmark</HI> would joyn with his Nephew of great <HI>Britain,</HI> to send a solemn Ambassie to the Emperour, and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> (the ends of whose pro∣ceedings were doubtfull) to mediat an accommodation, and to appear for <HI>him,</HI> who will be found most conformable to reason. To this, that King answer'd in <HI>writing</HI> (for that was the way of proceeding) that the <HI>Emperour</HI> and the <HI>Swede</HI> were com to that height, and heat of war, and to such a violence, that it is no time yet to speak to them of peace; but when the fury is a little pass'd, and the times more proper, he would take it for an Honour to joyn with his Nephew, and contribut the best means he could to bring about so good a Work.</P>
<P>Then ther was computation made, what was due to the King of great <HI>Britain,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> out of their Gran-Mothers Estate,: which was valued at neer upon two Millions of Dollars, and your Lordship must think it was a hard task to liquidat such an account: This being don, my Lord desird that part which was due to his Majesty (our King) and the <HI>Lady</HI> his Sister, which appear'd to amount unto eightscore thousand pounds sterling:
<PB N="189" REF="147"/>
That King answer'd, That he confess'd ther was so much money due, but his Mothers Estate was yet in the hands of Commissio∣ners; and neither he, nor any of his Sisters, had receiv'd their portions yet, and that his Nephew of <HI>England,</HI> and his Neere of <HI>Holland,</HI> should receive theirs with the first; but he did intimat besides, that ther were som considerable accounts 'twixt him and the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> for ready moneys he had lent his Brother King <HI>Iames,</HI> and for the thirty thousand pounds a moneth, that was by Covenant promis'd him for the support of his late Army in <HI>Germany.</HI> Then my Lord propounded, That His Majesty of Great <HI>Britains</HI> Subjects were not well us'd by his Officers in the <HI>Sound:</HI> for though that was but a Transitory passage into the <HI>Bal∣tic</HI> Sea, and that they neither bought nor sould any thing upon the place, yet they were forc'd to stay there many daies to take up money at high interest, to pay divers Tolls for their Merchandize, before they had expos'd them to vent: Therfore it was desired, that for the future, what <HI>English</HI> Merchant soever should pass through the <HI>Sound,</HI> it should be sufficient for him to Register an invoice of his Cargazon in the Custom-House Book, and give his Bond to pay all duties at his return, when he had made his Mar∣ket. To this my Lord had a fair answer, and so procur'd a pub∣lic Instrument under that Kings Hand and Seale, and sign'd by his Counsellors, which he had brought over, wherin the Propo∣sition was granted; which no Ambassador could obtaine before. Then 'twas alledg'd, that the <HI>English</HI> Merchant <HI>Adventurers</HI> who trade into <HI>Hamburgh▪</HI> have a new Toll lately impos'd upon them at <HI>Luckstad,</HI> which was desir'd to be taken of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>. To this also, ther was the like Instrument given, that the said Toll should be levied no more, Lastly, my Lord (in regard he was to pa's by the <HI>Hague</HI>) desir'd that Hereditary part which belong'd to the Lady <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> out of her Gran-Mothers Estate, because His Majesty knew well what Crosses and Afflictions she had pass'd, and what a nu∣merous Issue she had to maintain; And my Lord of <HI>Leicester</HI> would ingage his Honour, and all the Estate he hath in the World, That this should no way prejudice the accounts he is to make with his Majesty of Great <HI>Britain.</HI> The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> highly extoll'd the Noblenes of this motion; but he protested, that he had bin so drain'd in the late Wars, that his Chests are yet very empty. Here∣upon my Lord was feasted, and so departed.</P>
<P>He went then to the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI> to <HI>Sleswick,</HI> wher he found him at his Castle of <HI>Gothorp,</HI> and truly I did not think to have found such a magnificent building in these bleak parts; Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e
<PB N="190" REF="148"/>
also my Lord did condole the death of the late Queen that Dukes Gran-Mother, and he receiv'd very Princely entertain∣ment.</P>
<P>Then he went to <HI>Husem,</HI> where the like ceremony of Condole∣ment was perform'd at the Dutchess of <HI>Holsteins</HI> Court, His Maje∣sties (our Kings) <HI>Ant.</HI></P>
<P>Then he came back to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> wher that instrument which my Lord had procur'd, for remitting of the new Toll at <HI>Gluckslad,</HI> was deliver'd the Company of our Merchant Adventurers; and som other good offices don for that Town, as matters stood twixt them and the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>Then we came to <HI>Stode,</HI> wher <HI>Lesly</HI> was Governour, who carried his foot in a scarfe for a wound he had received at <HI>Bucks<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>obo,</HI> and he kept that place for the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI> And som busines of con∣sequence was don there also.</P>
<P>So we came to <HI>Broomsbottle,</HI> wher we staid for a Wind som daies; and in the midway of our voyage, wee met with a <HI>Hol∣land</HI> ship, who told us, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was slain; and so we return'd to <HI>London</HI> in less then three moneths: And if this was not busines enough for such a compass of time, I leave your Lord∣ship to judg.</P>

<P>I Am safely return'd from <HI>Germany,</HI> thanks be to God, and the news which we heard at Sea by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, about the midst of our voyage from <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> it seems proves too true, which was of the fall of the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> One <HI>Ierbire,</HI> who saies that he was in the very action, brought the first news to this Town, and e∣very corner rings of it; yet such is the extravagancy of som, that they

will lay wagers he is not yet dead, and the <HI>Exchange</HI> is full of such peeple. He was slain at <HI>Lutzen</HI> field battle, having made the Im∣periall Army give ground the day before; and being in pursuance of it, the next morning in a sudden Fog that fell, the Cavelry on both sides being engag'd, he was kill'd in the midst of the Troops, and none knows who kill'd him, whether one of his own men or the enemy; but finding himself mortally hurt, he told <HI>Saxen Way∣mar, Cousin, I pray look to the Troops, for I think I have enough:</HI> His body was not only rescued, but his forces had the better of the day; <HI>Papenheim</HI> being kill'd before him, whom he esteem'd the greatest Captain of all his enemies; for he was us'd to say, that he had three men to deal withall, a <HI>Pultron,</HI> a <HI>Iesuit,</HI> and a <HI>Souldier;</HI> by the two first, he meant <HI>Walstein,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ba∣varia,</HI> by the last <HI>Papenheim.</HI></P>
<P>Questionles this <HI>Gustavus</HI> (whose anagram is <HI>Augustus</HI>) was a great Captain, and a gallant man, and had he surviv'd that last victory, he would have put the Emperour to such a plunge, that som think he would hardly have bin able to have made head against him to any purpose again.

<P>He was not much affected to the <HI>English,</HI> witnes the ill usage Marquis <HI>Hammilton</HI> had with his 6000 men, wherof ther return'd not 600, the rest died of hunger and sicknes, having never seen the face of an enemy; Witnes also, his harshnes to our Ambassadors, and the rigid terms he would have tied the Prince <HI>Palsgrave</HI> unto.

<P>I Thank you a thousand times for the Noble entertainment you gave me at <HI>Berry,</HI> and the pains you took in shewing me the An∣tiquities of that place. In requitall, I can tell you of a strange thing I saw lately here, and I beleeve 'tis true; As I pass'd by St. <HI>Dunstans</HI> in Fleet street the last Saturday, I stepp'd into a Lapi∣dary or Stone-cutters shop, to treat with the Master for a stone to be put upon my Fathers Tomb: and casting my eyes up and down, I might spie a huge Marble with a large Inscription upon't, which was thus to my best remembrance:</P>
<Q>Here lies <HI>John Oxenham,</HI> a goodly young man, in whose Chamber, as he was strugling with the pangs of death, a Bird with a white brest was seen fluttering about his Bed, and so vanish'd.</Q>
<Q>Here lies also <HI>Mary Oxenham,</HI> the sister of the said <HI>John</HI> who died the next day, and the same Apparition was seen in the Room.</Q>
<P>Then another Sister is spoke of.</P>
<Q><HI>Then,</HI> Here lies hard by <HI>James Oxenham,</HI> the son of the said <HI>John,</HI> who died a child in his Cradle a little after, and such a Bird was seen fluttering about his head, a little before he expir'd, which va∣nish'd afterwards.▪</Q>
<P>At the bottom of the Stone ther is,</P>
<Q>Here lies <HI>Elizabeth Oxenham,</HI> the Mother of the said <HI>John,</HI> who died sixteen years since, when such a Bird with a white brest was seen about hex Bed before her death.</Q>
<P>To all these ther be divers Witnesses, both Squires and Ladies, whose names are engraven upon the Stone: This Stone is to be sent to a Town hard by <HI>Exeter</HI> wher this happen'd.</P>

<P>I Receiv'd your Lordships of the last of <HI>Iune,</HI> and I return m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> most humble thanks for the choice Nagg you pleas'd to send me, which came in very good plight. Your Lordship desires me to lay down what in my Travells▪ abroad I observ'd of the present condition of the <HI>Iews,</HI> once an Elect peeple, but now grown con∣temptible, and strangely squander'd up and down the World.
<PB N="199" REF="152" MS="y"/>
Though such a Discours, exactly fram'd, might make up a Vo∣lume, yet I will twist up what I know in this point, upon as nar∣row a Bottom as may be shut up within the compass of this Let∣ter.</P>
<P>The first Christian Countrey that expell'd the <HI>Iews,</HI> was <HI>Eng∣land; France</HI> followed our example next, then <HI>Spain,</HI> and after∣wards <HI>Portugall;</HI> nor were they exterminated these Countreys for their Religion, but for Villanies and cheatings; for clip∣ping Coins, poisning of Waters, and counterfeiting of Seals.</P>
<P>Those Countreys they are permitted to live now most in amongst Christians, are <HI>Germany, Holland, Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> but not in those parts where the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath to do. In the <HI>Levant</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> they swarm most, for the gran <HI>Vizier,</HI> and all other great <HI>Boshawes,</HI> have commonly som <HI>Iew</HI> for their Counsellor or Spie, who inform them of the state of Christian Princes, possess them of a hatred of the Religion, and so incense them to a war against them.</P>
<P>They are accounted the subtill'st and most subdolous peeple up∣on Earth; the reason why they are thus degenerated from their primitive simplicity, and innocence, is their often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ptivities, their desperat fortunes, the necessity and hatred to which they have been habituated, for nothing depraves ingenuous spirits, and cor∣rupts cleer wits more than want and indigence. By their profession they are for the most part <HI>Broakers,</HI> and <HI>Lombardeers,</HI> yet by that base and servile way of <HI>Frippery</HI> trade, they grow rich whersoever they nest themselves; and this with their multiplication of Chil∣dren, they hold to be an argument that an extraordinary providence attends them still. Me thinks that so cleer accomplishments of the Prophecies of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> touching that peeple, should work up∣on them for their conversion, as the destruction of their City and Temple; that they should becom despicable, and the tail of all Nations; that they should be Vagabonds, and have no firm ha∣bitation.</P>
<P>Touching the first, they know it came punctually to pass, and so have the other two; for they are the most hatefull race of men up∣on earth; insomuch, that in <HI>Turkie</HI> where they are most valued, if a <HI>Musulman</HI> com to any of their houses, &amp; leave his shoos at the door, the <HI>Iew</HI> dare not com in all the while, till the <HI>Turk</HI> hath don what he would with his Wife: For the last, 'tis wonderfull to see in what considerable numbers they are dispers'd up and down the World, yet they can never reduce themselves to such a coalition and unity as may make a Republic, Principality, or Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="153"/>They hold that the <HI>Iewes</HI> of <HI>Italy, Germany,</HI> and the <HI>Levant,</HI> are of <HI>Benjamins</HI> Tribe; ten of the Tribes at the destruction of <HI>Ieroboams</HI> Kingdom were led Captives beyond <HI>Euphrates,</HI> whence they never return'd, nor do they know what became of them ever after; yet they beleeve they never became Apostats and Gen∣tiles. But the Tribe of <HI>Iuda,</HI> whence they expect their <HI>Messias,</HI> of whom one shall hear them discours with so much confidence, and self-pleasing conceit, they say, is setled in <HI>Portugall;</HI> wher they give out to have thousands of their race, whom they dispense withall to make a semblance of Christianitie, even to Church de∣grees.</P>
<P>This makes them breed up their children in the <HI>Lusitanian</HI> Lan∣guage; which makes the <HI>Spaniard</HI> have an odd saying, that <HI>El Portuguez se criò del pedo de un Iudia. A Portugues was engendred of a Iews Fart;</HI> as the <HI>Mahu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ans</HI> have a passage in their <HI>Alcaro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, That a Cat was made of a Lions breath.</HI></P>
<P>As they are the most contemtiblest peeple, and have a kind of fulsom sent, no better then a stink, that distinguisheth them from others, so are they the most timorous peeple on earth, and so, utterly incapable of Arms, for they are made neither Souldiers nor Slaves: And this their <HI>Pusillanimity</HI> and <HI>cowardise,</HI> as well as their <HI>cunning</HI> and <HI>craft,</HI> may be imputed to their various thral∣do us, contempt, and poverty, which hath cow'd and dast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rdiz'd their courage▪ Besides these properties, they are light and giddy headed, much symbolizing in spirit with our Apolalypticall ze∣lots, and fiery interpreters of <HI>Daniel</HI> and other Prophets, wherby they often sooth, or rather fool themselves into som illumination, which really proves but som egregious dorage.</P>
<P>They much glory of their mysterious <HI>Cabal,</HI> wherin they make the reality of things to depend upon Letters, and Words: but they say that <HI>Hebrew</HI> onely hath this priviledg: This <HI>Cabal,</HI> which is nought else but Tradition, they say, being transmitted from one age to another, was in som measure a reparation of our knowledge lost in <HI>Adam,</HI> and they say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>was reveal'd four times; First to <HI>Adam,</HI> who being thrust out of Paradise, and sitting one day very sad, and sorrowing for the loss of the knowledg he had of that dependance the creatures have with their Creator; the An∣gell <HI>Raguel</HI> was sent to comfort him, and to instruct him and repair his knowledg herein: And this they call the <HI>Caball,</HI> which was lost the second time by the <HI>Floud,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>abell▪</HI> then God discover'd it to <HI>Moses</HI> in the bush.

of times, and so wrote divers Books, which were lost in the gran captivity The last time they hold, that God restor'd the <HI>Cabal</HI> to <HI>Esdras</HI> (a Book they value extraordinarily) who by Gods command withdrew to the Wildernes forty daies with five Scribes, who in that space wrote two hundred and four Books: The first one hundred thirty and four, were to be read by all; but the other seventy were to pass privatly amongst the <HI>Levites,</HI> and these they pretend to be <HI>Cabalistic,</HI> and not yet all lost.</P>
<P>Ther are this day three Sects of <HI>Iews;</HI> the <HI>Africans</HI> first, who besides the holy Scriptures, embrace the <HI>Talmud</HI> also for authen∣tic; the second receive only the Scriptures; the third, which are call'd the <HI>Samaritans</HI> (wherof ther are but few) admit only of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> the five Books of <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Iews</HI> in generall drink no Wine, without a dispensation; when they kill any creature, they turn his face to the East, say∣ing, <HI>Be it sanctified in the great name of God;</HI> they cut the throat with a knif without a gap, which they hold very prophane.</P>
<P>In their <HI>Synagogs</HI> they make one of the best sort to read a Chap∣ter of <HI>Moses,</HI> then som mean Boy reads a peece of the Prophets; in the midst, ther's a round place arch'd over, wherin one of their <HI>Rabbies</HI> walks up and down, and in <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tuguez</HI> magnifies the <HI>Messias</HI> to com, comforts their captivity, and rails at Christ.</P>
<P>They have a kind of Cupboard to represent the Tabernacle, wherin they lay the Tables of the Law, which now and then, they take out and kiss; they sing many Tunes, and <HI>Adonai,</HI> they make the ordinary name of God: <HI>Iehovah</HI> is pronounc'd at high Fe∣stivalls; at Circumcision Boys are put to sing som of <HI>Davids Psalms</HI> so lowd, as drowns the Infants cry: The <HI>Synagog</HI> is hung about with Glass.

<P>Women are not allow'd to enter the <HI>Synagog,</HI> but they sit in a Gallery without, for they hold they have not so divine a soul as men, and are of a lower creation, made only for sensuall pleasure and propagation.</P>
<P>Amongst the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> ther is no <HI>Iew</HI> capable of a <HI>Turkish</HI> habit, unless he acknowledg Christ as much as <HI>Turks</HI> do, which is to have bin a great Prophet, wherof they hold ther are three onely, <HI>Moses, Christ,</HI> and <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>

<P>Som hundred and odd yeers since, ther was in <HI>France</HI> one Cap∣tain <HI>Coucy</HI> a gallant Gentleman of an ancient extraction, and▪ Kee∣per of <HI>Coucy▪</HI> Castle, which is yet standing and in good repair. He fell in love with a young Gentlewoman, and courted her for his wife: ther was reciprocall love between them, but her parents understan∣ding of it, by way of prevention they shuffled up a forced Match twixt her and one <HI>Monsieur Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>l,</HI> who was a great Heir: Captain <HI>Coucy</HI> hereupon quitted <HI>France</HI> in discontent, and went to the wars in <HI>Hungary</HI> against the Turk, where he received a mortall wound, not far from <HI>Buda.</HI> Being carried to his lodging, hee languished som days; but a little before his death, he spoke to an ancient Ser∣vant of his, that he had many profs of his fidelity and truth, but now he had a great busines to intrust him with, which hee conjur'd him by all means to do, which was, That after his death, he should get his body to be opened, and then to take his heart out of his brest, and put it in an earthen Pot to be bak'd to powder, then to put the powder into a hansome Box, with that Bracelet of hair he had worn long about his left wrist, which was a lock of <HI>Madamois<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>lle Faiels</HI> hair, and put it amongst the powder, together with a little Note he had written with his own bloud to her; and after hee had
<PB N="208" REF="157"/>
given him the Rites of Buriall, to make all the speed he could to <HI>France,</HI> and deliver the said box to <HI>Madamoiselle Faiel.</HI> The old Ser∣vant did as his Master had commanded him, and so went to <HI>France,</HI> and comming one day to Monsieur <HI>Faiels</HI> house, he suddenly met him with one of his servants, and examin'd him, because he knew he was Captain <HI>Coucy's</HI> servant, and finding him timerous, and faltering in his speech, hee search'd him, and sound the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>aid Box in his pocket, with the Note which expressed what was therin: He dismiss'd the Bearer with menaces that he should com no more neer his house. Monsieur <HI>Faiel</HI> going in, sent for his Cook and deli∣ver'd him the Powder, charging him to make a little well-relish'd dish of it, without losing a jot of it, for it was a very costly thing; and commanded him to bring it in himself, after the last cours at Supper. The Cook bringing in the Dish accordingly, Monsieur <HI>Faiel</HI> commanded all to void the room, and began a serious discours with his wife, how ever since he had married her, he observ'd she was always melancholly▪ and he feared she was inclining to a Consumption, therfore he had provided for her a very precious Cordiall, which he was well assured would cure her: Therupon he made her eat up the whole dish; and afterwards much importu∣ning him to know what it was, he told her at last she had eaten <HI>Coucy's</HI> heart, and so drew the Box out of his pocket, and shewed her the Note and the Bracelet: in a sudden exultation of joy, she with a far-fetch'd sigh said, <HI>This is a precious Cordiall indeed,</HI> and so lick'd the Dish saying, <HI>It is so pretious, that tis pity to put ever any meat upon't.</HI> So she went to bed, and in the morning she was found stone-dead.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT seems ther is som angry Star that hath hung over the busines of the <HI>Palatinat</HI> from the beginning of these <HI>German</HI> Wars to this very day; which will too evidently appear, if one should mark and deduce matters from their first rise.</P>
<P>You may remember how poorly <HI>Prague</HI> was lost: The Bishop of <HI>Halverstat</HI> and Count <HI>Mansfelt</HI> shuffled up and down a good while, and did great matters, but all came to nothing at last. You may remember how one of the Ships-Royall was cast away in car∣rying over the last, and the 12000 men he had hence perish'd many of them very miserably, and he himself, as they write, di∣ed in a poor Hostrey with one Laquay, as he was going to <HI>Venice</HI> to a bank of money he had stor'd up there for a dead lift. Your Lordship knows what success the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> had (and our 6000 men under Sir <HI>Charles Morgan</HI>) for while he thought to make new acquests, he was in hazard to lose all that he had, had not he had favorable Propositions tendred him. Ther were▪ never poor Christians perished more lamentably than those 6000 we sent under M. <HI>Hamilton</HI> for the assistance of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who did much, but you know what became of him at last: How disa∣strously the Prince <HI>Palatin</HI> himself fell, and in what an ill conjun∣cture of time, being upon the very point of being restor'd to his Country.</P>
<P>But now we have as bad news as any we had yet; for the young Prince <HI>Palatin,</HI> and his Brother Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> having got a jol∣ly considerable Army in <HI>Holland,</HI> to try their fortunes in <HI>Germa∣ny</HI> with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> they had advanc'd as far as <HI>Munsterland,</HI> and <HI>Westphalia,</HI> and having lain before <HI>Lengua,</HI> they were forc'd to raise the siege; and one Generall <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>zfield</HI> pursuing them, ther was a fore battell fought, wherin Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> my Lord <HI>Craven,</HI> and others were taken prisoners. The Prince <HI>Palatin</HI> himself, with Major <HI>King,</HI> thinking to get over the <HI>Weser</HI> in a Coach, the Water being deep and not sordable, he sav'd himself by the help
<PB N="216" REF="161"/>
of a Willow, and so went a foot all the way to <HI>Minden,</HI> the Coach and the Coach-man being drown'd in the River: Ther wer neer upon 2000 slain on the <HI>Palsgraves</HI> side, and scarce the twentieth part so many on <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>zfields,</HI> Major <HI>Gaeuts,</HI> one of the chiefe Com∣manders, was kil'd.</P>

<HEAD><HI>XXXII.</HI> To Sir <HI>Ed. B.</HI> Knight.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Receiv'd yours this Maunday-Thursday: and wheras amongst other passages, and▪ high endearments of love, you desire to know what method I observe in the exercise of my devotl∣ons, I thank you for your request, which I have reason to be∣lieve doth proceed from an extraordinary respect unto me; and I will deal with you herein, as one should do with his Confessor.</P>
<P>Tis true, though ther be rules and rubrics in our <HI>Liturgy</HI> suf∣ficient to guide evry one in the performance of all holy duties, yet I beleeve evry one hath som mode and modell or formula∣ry of his own, specially for his privat cubicular devotions.</P>
<P>I will begin with the last day of the week, and with the latter end of that day, I mean Saturday evening, on which I have fasted ever since I was a youth in <HI>Venice,</HI> for being delivered from a very great danger: This yeer I use som extraordinary acts of devotion to usher in the ensuing Sunday in Hymns, and various prayers of my own penning, before I go to bed. On Sunday Morning I rise earlier than upon other dayes, to prepare my self for the Sancti∣fying of it; nor do I use Barber, Tailor, Shoo-maker, or any o∣ther Mechanick that morning; and whatsoever diversions, or lets, may hinder me the week before, I never miss, but in case of sicknes, to repair to Gods holy House that day, wher I com before prayers begin, to make my self fitter for the work by some praevious Me∣ditations, and to take the whole Service along with me; nor do I love to mingle speech with any in the interim about news or world∣ly negotiations. In Gods holy House I prostrat my self in the hum∣blest
<PB N="219" REF="162"/>
and decent'st way of genuflection I can imagin; nor do I be∣leeve ther can be any excess of exterior humility in that place; therfore I do not like those squatting unseemly bold postures upon ones tail, or muffling the face in the Hat, or thrusting it in so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> hole, or covering it with ones hand; but with bended knee, and an open confident face, I fix my Eyes on the East part of the Church, and Heaven. I endeavour to apply evry tir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>le of the <HI>Service</HI> to my own Conscience and Occasions; and I believe the want of this, with the huddling up, and careless reading of som Ministers, with the commoness of it, is the greatest cause that many do undervalue and take a Surfet of our pub∣lic Service.</P>
<P>For the reading and singing <HI>Psalmes,</HI> wheras most of them are either Petitions or Eucharisticall ejaculations, I listen to them more attentively, and make them mine own: When I stand at the <HI>creed,</HI> I think upon the custom they have in <HI>Poland,</HI> and else-where, for Gentlemen to draw their Swords all the while, intimating therby, that they will defend it with their lives and bloud; And for the <HI>Decalog,</HI> wheras others use to rise, and sit, I ever kneel at it in the humblest and trembling'st posture of all, to crave re∣mission for the breaches pass'd of any of Gods holy Command∣ments (specially the week before) and future grace to observe them.</P>
<P>I love a holy devout Sermon, that first checks and then cheers the Conscience, that begins with the Law and ends with the Gos∣pell; but I never prejudicat or censure any Preacher, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>aking him as I find him.</P>
<P>And now that we are not only <HI>Adulted</HI> but <HI>ancient</HI> Christians, I beleeve the most acceptable Sacrifice we can send up to Heaven, is <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>praise,</HI> and that <HI>Sermons</HI> are not so essentiall as either of them to the tru practice of devotion. The rest of the holy Sab∣bath, I sequester my body and mind as much as I can from worldly affairs.</P>
<P>Upon Monday morn, as soon as the <HI>Cinq-ports</HI> are open, I have a particular prayer of thanks, that I am reprieved to the be∣ginning of that week; and evry day following, I knock thrice at Heavens gate, in the Morning, in the Evening, and at Night; besides, Prayers at Meals, and som other occasionall ejaculations, as upon the putting on of a clean Shirt, washing my hands, and at lighting of Candles, which because they are sudden, I do in the third person.</P>
<P>Tuesday morning I rise Winter and Summer as soon as I awake,
<PB N="220" REF="163"/>
and send up a more particular sacrifice for som reasons; and as I am dispos'd, or have busines, I go to bed again.</P>
<P>Upon Wensday night, I always fast, and perform also som ex∣traordinary acts of Devotion, as also upon Friday night; and Saturday morning, as soon as my senses are unlock'd I get up. And in the Summer time, I am oftentimes abroad in som privat field, to attend the Sun-rising: And as I pray <HI>thrice</HI> evry day, so I fast <HI>thrice</HI> evry week, at least I eat but one meal upon Wens∣days, Fridays, and Saturdays, in regard I am jealous with my self, to have more infirmities to answer for, than other.</P>
<P>Before I go to bed, I make a scrutiny what peccant humors have reign'd in me that day, and so I reconcile my self to my Crea∣tor, and strike a <HI>tally</HI> in the Exchequer of Heaven for my <HI>quie∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>us est,</HI> ere I close my eyes, and leave no burden upon my Con∣science.</P>
<P>Before I presume to take the Holy Sacrament, I use som ex∣traordinary acts of Humiliation to prepare my self som days be∣fore, and by doing som deeds of Charity; and commonly I compose som new Prayers, and divers of them written in my own bloud.</P>
<P>I use not to rush rashly into prayer without a trembling prece∣dent Meditation, and if any odd thoughts intervene, and grow upon me, I check my self, and recommence; and this is incident to long prayers, which are more subject to mans weaknes, and the devils malice.</P>
<P>I thank God I have this fruit of my forrain Travels, that I can pray unto him evry day of the week in a severall Language, and upon Sunday in seven, which in Orisons of my own I pun∣ctually perform in my privat Pomeridian devotions.</P>
<Q>Et sic aeternam contendo attingere vitam.</Q>
<P>By these steps I strive to clime up to heaven, and my soul prompts me I shall thither; for ther is no object in the world delights me more, than to cast up my eyes that way, specially in a Star-light night; and if my mind be overcast with any odd clouds of me∣lancholly, when I look up and behold that glorious Fabric, which I hope shall be my Countrey heerafter, ther are new spirits begot in me presently, which make me scorn the World, and the plea∣sures thereof, considering the <HI>vanity</HI> of the one, and the <HI>inanity</HI> of the other.</P>
<P>Thus my soul still moves East-ward, as all the Heavenly bo∣dies
<PB N="221" REF="163"/>
doe; but I must tell you, that as those bodies are over-ma∣ster'd, and snatch'd away to the West, <HI>raptu primi mobilis,</HI> by the generall motion of the tenth sphere, so by those Epidemicall infir∣mities which are incident to man, I am often snatch'd away a clean contrary cours, yet my soul persists still in our own pro∣per motion: I am often at variance, and angry with my self (nor do I hold this anger to be any breach of charity) when I con∣sider, That wheras my Creator intended this body of mine, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> lump of Clay, to be a <HI>Temple</HI> of his holy Spirit, my affections should turn it often to a <HI>Brothell-house,</HI> my passions to a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and my excesses to an <HI>Hospitall.</HI></P>
<P>Being of a Lay profession, I humbly conform to the Constitu∣tions of the Church, and my spirituall Superiors; and I hold this obedience to be an acceptable Sacrifice to God.</P>
<P>Difference in opinion may work a <HI>disaffection</HI> in me, but not a <HI>detestation:</HI> I rather pity, than hate, <HI>Turk</HI> or <HI>Insidell,</HI> for they are of the same metall, and bear the same stamp as I do, though the Inscriptions differ. If I hate any, 'tis those Scismatics that puzzle the sweet peace of our Church, so that I could bee content to see an <HI>Anabaptist</HI> go to Hell on a <HI>Brownists</HI> back?</P>
<P>Noble Knight, now that I have thus eviscerated my self, and dealt so clearly with you, I desire by way of correspon∣dence that you would tell me, what way you take in your journey to Heaven; for if my Brest lie so open to you, 'tis not sitting yours should bee shut up to mee; therfore I pray let me hear from you when it may stand with your Conveni∣ence.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur being then in the Country, when I began my journey for <HI>Ireland,</HI> was the cause I could not kiss your hands, therfore I shall do now from <HI>Bath,</HI> what I should have don at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Being here for a distillation of Rheum that pains me in one of my Arms, and having had about three thousand stroaks of a pump upon me in the Queens Bath: ▪And having bin here now divers daies and view'd the severall qualities of these Waters, I fell to contemplat a little what should be the reason of such an extraordi∣nary actuall heat, and medicinall vertue in them. I have seen and read of divers Baths abroad, as those of <HI>Caldanel</HI> and <HI>Avinian</HI> in <HI>agro Senensi,</HI> the <HI>Grotta</HI> in <HI>Viterbio,</HI> those between <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Puteolum</HI> in <HI>Campania;</HI> And I have bin a little curious to know the reason of those rare Lymphaticall properties in them above other waters. I find that som impute it to Wind, or Ayr, or som Exha∣lations shut up in the Bowels of the Earth, which either by their own nature, or by their violent motion and agitation, or attrition upon Rocks, and narrow passages do gather heat, and so impart it to the Waters.</P>
<P>Others attribut this <HI>balneal</HI> heat unto the Sun, whose all∣searching Beams penetrating the Pores of the Earth, do heat the Waters.</P>
<P>Others think this heat to proceed from quicklime, which by com∣mon experience we find to heat any Water cast upon't, and also to kindle any combustible substance put upon't.</P>
<P>Lastly, ther are som that ascribe this heat to a subterranean fire kindled in the bowels of the Earth upon sulphury and bituminous matter.</P>
<P>'Tis true, all these may be generall concurring causes, but not the adaequat proper and peculiar reason of <HI>balneal</HI> heats; and herein truly our learned Countryman Dr. <HI>Iorden</HI> hath got the start of any that ever writ of this subject, and goes to work like a solid Philosopher; for having treated of the generation of mine∣ralls, he finds that they have their Seminaries in the Womb of the Earth replenish'd with active spirits; which meeting with apt
<PB N="225" REF="165"/>
matter and adjuvant causes, do proceed to the generation of se∣verall species, according to the nature of the efficient, and fitnes of the matter: In this work of generation, as ther is <HI>generatio uni∣us,</HI> so ther is <HI>corruptio alterius;</HI> and this cannot be don without a superiour power, which by moysture dilating it self, works upon the matter like a leav'ning and ferment, to bring it to its own purpose.</P>
<P>This motion 'twixt the agent spirit, and patient matter, produ∣ceth an actuall heat; <HI>for motion is the fountain of heat,</HI> which serves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s an instrument to advance the work; for as cold dulls, so heat quickneth all things: Now for the nature of this heat, it is not a destructive violent heat, as that of fire, but a generative gentle heat joyn'd with moysture, nor needs it ayr for eventilation: This naturall heat is daily observ'd by <HI>Digg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n</HI> in the Mynes; so then while Mineralls are thus engendring, and in <HI>solutis principiis,</HI> in their liquid formes, and not consolidated into hard bodies, (for then they have not that vertue) they impart heat to the neighbou∣ring Waters. So then it may be concluded, that this soyl about the Bath is a minerall vein of earth, and the fermenting gentle temper of generative heat that goes to the production of the said Mineralls, do impart and actually communicat this <HI>balneal</HI> vertue and medicinall heat to these Waters.</P>
<P>This subject of Minerall <HI>Waters</HI> would afford an <HI>Ocean</HI> of mat∣ter, wer one to compile a solid discours of it: And I pray excuse me, that I have presum'd in so narrow a compas as a Letter, to com∣prehend so much, which is nothing I think, in comparison of what you know already of this matter.</P>

<P>I made an humble motion to my Lord, that in regard busines∣ses of all sorts did multiply here daily, and that ther was but one <HI>Clerk</HI> of the Counsell (Sir <HI>Paul Davis</HI>) who was able to dispatch busines, (Sir <HI>Will.

<P>THe greatest news we have heer now, is a notable navall fight that was lately 'twixt the <HI>Spanierd</HI> and <HI>Hollander</HI> in the <HI>Downes;</HI> but to make it more intelligible, I will deduce the busi∣nes from the beginning.</P>
<P>THe King of <HI>Spain</HI> had provided a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fleet of Galeons, wherof the Vice-Admiralls of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Portugall</HI> wer two, (wher∣of he had sent advice to <HI>England</HI> long before.) The design was to meet with the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, under the command of the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and in default of that, to land som treasure at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with a <HI>recruit</HI> of <HI>Spaniards</HI> which wer grown very thin in <HI>Flanders.</HI> These <HI>recruits</HI> wer got by an odd trick; for som of
<PB N="231" REF="168"/>
the Fleet being at Saint <HI>Anderas,</HI> a report was blown up of pur∣pose, that the <HI>French</HI> were upon the Coasts; heerupon all the youngmen of the Country came to the Sea-side, and so a great number of them were tumbled a shipboard, and so they set sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e to∣wards the Coasts of <HI>France;</HI> but the Archbishop it seems had drawn in his Fleet: Then striking into the Narrow-Seas, they met with a Fleet of about sixteen <HI>Hollanders,</HI> wherof they sunk and took two, and the rest got away to <HI>Holland,</HI> to give an alarum to the States, who in less than a moneth, got together a Fleet of a∣bout one hundred sail, and the wind being a long time Easterly, they came into the <HI>Downes,</HI> where <HI>Don Antonio d' Oquéndo,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admirall had stayed for them all the while. Sir <HI>Iohn Pen∣nington</HI> was then abroad with seven of His Majesties Ships: and <HI>Don Antonio</HI> being daily warn'd what forces were preparing in <HI>Zea∣land</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and so advis'd to get over to the <HI>Flemish</HI> Coasts: in the interim with a haughty spirit, he answer'd, <HI>Tengo de quedar∣me aqui para castigar estos Rebeldes: I will stay here to chastise these Rebels.</HI> There were ten more of His Masties Ships appointed to go joyn with Sir <HI>Iohn Pennington,</HI> to observe the motions of these Fleets, but the wind continuing still East, they could not get out of the River.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet had Fresh-waters, Victualls, and other neces∣saries from our Coasts for their money, according to the capitula∣tions of peace, all this while; at last, being half surprized by a cloud of <HI>Hollanders,</HI> consisting of one hundred and fourteen ships, the launc'd out from our Coasts, and a most furious fight began, our ships having retir'd hard by all the while: The Vice-Admi∣rall of <HI>Portugall,</HI> a famous Sea Captain, <HI>Don Lope de Hozes,</HI> was engag'd in close fight with the Vice-Admirall of <HI>Holland,</HI> and after many tough rancounters they were both blown up, and burnt to∣gether. At last, night came and parted the rest; but six <HI>Spanish</HI> ships were taken, and about twenty of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> perish'd. <HI>O∣quendo</HI> then cross'd over to <HI>Nardic,</HI> and so back to <HI>Spain,</HI> where he died before he came to the Court; and 'tis thought, had he liv'd, he had bin question'd for som miscarr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ages; for if he had suffer'd the <HI>Dunkerkers,</HI> who are nimbler and more fit for fight, to have had the Van and dealt with the <HI>Hollander,</HI> 'tis thought matters might have gon better with him; but his ambition was, that the great <HI>spa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ish</HI> Galeons should get the glory of the day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> give out that they had the better, in regard they did the main work, for <HI>Oquendo</HI> had conveyed all his recruits and tresure to <HI>Flanders,</HI> while he lay hovering on our Coasts.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="169" MS="y"/>One thing is herein very observable, what a mighty Naviga∣ble power the <HI>Hollander</HI> is com to, that in so short a compas of time, he could appeare with such a numerous Fleet of one hun∣dred and fourteen Sails of Men of War, in such a perfect equip∣page.</P>

When the King of <HI>Spain</HI> told <HI>Olivares</HI> of it first, he slighted it, saying, <HI>That he was but Rey de Havas, a Bean-cake King.</HI> But it seems strange to me, and so strange, that it transforms me to wonder, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> being accounted so politic a Nation, and so full of pre∣caution, could not foresee this; specially, ther being divers in∣telligences given, and evident symptoms of the generall discon∣tentment of that Kingdom (because they could not be protected a∣gainst the <HI>Hollander</HI> in <HI>Brasil</HI>) and of som designes a yeer before, when this Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> was at <HI>Madrid.</HI> I wonder I say, they did not secure his person by ingaging him in som employment out of the way: Truly, I thought the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was better sighted, and could could see further off than so. You know what a huge lim the Crown of <HI>Portugall</HI> was to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, by the Islands in the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Sea; the Towns in <HI>Afric;</HI> and all the <HI>East-In∣dies,</HI> insomuch, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hath nothing now left beyond the <HI>Line.</HI></P>
<P>Ther is no <HI>offensive</HI> war yet made by <HI>Spain</HI> against King <HI>Iohn,</HI> she only stands upon the <HI>defensive</HI> part, untill the <HI>Catalan</HI> be re∣duc'd; and I beleeve, that will be a long-winded busines; for this <HI>French</HI> Cardinall stirs all the devills of Hell against <HI>Spain,</HI> in∣somuch, that most men say, that these formidable fires which are

now raging in both these Countreys, were kindled at first by a <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>anado</HI> hurl'd from his brain: Nay, som will not stick to say, that this breach 'twixt us and <HI>Scotland</HI> is a reach of his.</P>
<P>Ther was a ruthfull distaster happen'd lately at Sea, which makes our Merchants upon the <HI>Exchange</HI> hang down their heads very sadly. The Ship <HI>Swan,</HI> wherof one <HI>Limery</HI> was Master, ha∣ving bin four yeers abroad about the Streights, was sailing home with a <HI>Cargazon,</HI> valued at eight hundred thousand pounds, wher∣of four hundred and fifty thousand was in Money, the rest in Je∣wells and Merchandise; but being in sight of shore, she sprung a leak, and being ballasted with Salt, it choak'd the Pump, so that the <HI>Swan</HI> could swim no longer: Som sixteen were drown'd, and som of them with ropes of Pearl about their necks, the rest were sav'd by an <HI>Hamburgber</HI> not far off. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> loseth little by it (only his affairs in <HI>Flanders</HI> may suffer) for his Money was insur'd, and few of the <HI>Principalls,</HI> but the <HI>Insurers</HI> onely, who were most of them <HI>Genowayes</HI> and <HI>Hollanders:</HI> A most infortunat chance, for had she com to safe port, she had bin the richest ship that ever came into the <HI>Thames;</HI> so that <HI>Neptun</HI> never had such a morfell at one bit.</P>

<P>God preserve us from public calamities; for Serpentin Monsters have been often ill favoured presages.

<P>I Saw such prodigious things daily don these few yeers, that I had resolv'd with my self to give over <HI>wondering</HI> at any thing; yet a passage happen'd this week, that forc'd me to wonder once more, because it is without parallel. It was, that som odd fellows went skulking up and down <HI>London</HI>-streets, and with Figs and Reasons allur'd little Children, and so pourloyn'd them away from their Parents, and carried them a Ship-board for beyond Sea, where by cutting their hair, and other devises, they so dis∣guis'd them, that their Parents could not know them.

The said Town of <HI>Hamelen</HI> was annoyed with Rats and Mice; and it chanc'd, that a Pied-coated Piper came thither, who covenanted with the chief Burgers for such a reward, if he could free them quite from the said Vermin, nor would he demand it, till a twelve-month, and a day after: The agreement being made, he began to play on his Pipes, and all the Rats, and the Mice followed him to a great Lough hard by, where they all perish'd; so the Town was in∣fected no more. At the end of the yeer, the Pied-Piper return'd for his reward, the Burgers put him off with slightings, and neg∣lect; offring him som small matter, which he refusing, and stay∣ing som dayes in the Town, on Sunday morning at High Mass, when most peeple were at Church, he fell to play on his Pipes, and all the children up and down, follow'd him out of the Town, to a great Hill not far off, which rent in two, and opened, and let him and the children in, and so clos'd up again: This happen'd a matter of two hundred and fifty yeers since; and in that Town, they date their Bills and Bonds, and other Instruments in Law, to this day, from the yeer of the going out of their children: Besides, there is a great piller of stone at the foot of the said Hill, wheron this story is ingraven,</P>

That which sinks deepest into me, is the sense I have of the common calamities of this Nation; ther is a strange Spirit hath got in amongst us, which makes the Idaea of holines, the formality of good, and the very facultie of reason to be quite differing from what it was. I remember to have read a tale of the Ape in <HI>Paris,</HI> who having got a child out of the cradle, &amp; carried him up to the top of the tiles, and there sat with him upon the ridg; The parents behol∣ding this ruthfull spectacle, gave the Ape fair and smooth language, so he gently brought the child down again, and replac'd him in the cradle.

<P>THough I never had the least umbrage of your love, or doubt∣ed of the reality therof, yet since I tell into this plunge, it hath been much confirm'd unto me. It is a true observation, that amongst other effects of affliction, one is, <HI>to try a frend;</HI> for those proofs that are made in the fawnings, and dazling Sun-shine of prosperity, are not so clear, as those which break out, and trans∣peer through the dark clouds of adversity. You know the diffe∣rence the Philosophers make twixt the two <HI>extreme</HI> colors <HI>black</HI> and <HI>write,</HI> that the one is <HI>congregativum,</HI> the other <HI>disgregativum visus:</HI> Black doth congregate, unite, and fortifie the sight; the other doth disgregat, scatter, and enfeeble it, when it fixeth upon any object: So, through the Sable clouds of advers fortune, one may make a truer inspection into the brest of a frend. Besides this, affliction produceth another far more excellent effect, it brings us to a bet∣ter, and a more clear knowledge of our Creator; for as the rising, and setting Sun, appears bigger unto us, than when he is in the <HI>Meridian</HI> (though the distance be still the same) the cause wher∣of is ascrib'd to the interposition of mists, which lye twixt our eyes and him; so through the thick fogs of adversity (which in this point are as pellucid and diaphanous as any Chrystall) we com to see God, and the immensity of his love in a fuller proportion. Ther cannot be clearer evidences of his care, than his corrections; when he makes the world to frown, then he smiles most upon us, though it be through a <HI>mask;</HI> besides, it is always his method, to <HI>stroke</HI> them whom he <HI>strikes.</HI> We have an ordinary salute in English, <HI>God blesse you;</HI> and though the verb be radically deriv'd from the <HI>Dutch</HI> word, yet it would bear good sense, and be very pertinent to this purpose, if we would fetch it from the <HI>French</HI> word <HI>blesser,</HI> which is to <HI>hurt:</HI> This speculation raiseth my spirits to a great hight of comfort, and patience, that notwithstanding they have been a long time weigh'd down and quashd, yet I shall at last ore∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>om all these pressures, survive my debts, and surmount my ene∣mies.</P>

<P>THe earth doth not always produce Roses and Lillies, but shee brings forth also Nettles and Thistles: So the world affords us not always contentments and pleasure, but somtimes afflictions and trouble; <HI>Ut illa tribulos, sic iste tribulationes producit:</HI> The Sea is not more subject to contrary blasts, nor the Surges therof to tos∣sings and tumblings, as the actions of men are to encombrances and crosses: The Ayr is not fuller of meteors, than mans life is of miseries; but as we find that it is not a clear skie, but the <HI>clouds that drop fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>es,</HI> as the holy Text tells us, so adversity is far more fer∣til than prosperity, it useth to water and mollifie the heart, which is the <HI>center</HI> of all our affections, and makes it produce excellent fruit, wheras the glaring Sun-shine of a continuall prosperity would enharden and dry it up, and so make it barren.</P>
<P>Ther is not a greater evidence of Gods care and love to his crea∣ture than affliction; for as a <HI>French</HI> Author doth illustrat it by a familiar example, If two Boys should be seen to fight in the streets, and a ring of peeple about them, one of the standers by parting them, lets the one go untouch'd, but he falls a correcting the other, wherby the beholders will infer, that he is his child, or at least one whom he wisheth well unto: So the strokes of adversity which fall upon us from heaven, shew that God is our Father, as well as our Creator: This makes this bitter <HI>cup of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ffliction</HI> becom <HI>Nectar,</HI> and the <HI>bread of carefulnes</HI> I now eat, to be true <HI>Ambrosia</HI> unto me.

<P>I Receiv'd yours of the fifth of <HI>March,</HI> and 'twas as welcom to me as flowers in <HI>May,</HI> which are now comming on apace▪ You seem to marvell I do not marry all this while, considering that I am past the <HI>Meridian</HI> of my age, and that to your knowledge ther have been overtures made me of parties above my degrees. Truly in this point I will deal with you as one should do with his Confessor; Had I been dispos'd to have married for wealth without affection, or for affection without wealth, I had been in bonds before now; but I did never cast my eyes upon any yet, that I thought I was born for, wher both these concurr'd. Tis the custom of som (and tis a common custom) to chuse Wives by the weight, that is, by their wealth: Others fall in love with light wives, I do not mean <HI>Vene∣rean</HI> lightnes, but in reference to portion: The la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e Earl of <HI>Salis∣bury</HI> gives a caveat for this, <HI>That beauty without a Dowry</HI> (without that <HI>unguentum Indicum) is as a gilded shell without a kernell;</HI> ther∣fore he warns his son to be sure to have somthing with his Wife, and his reason is, <HI>Because nothing can bee bought in the Market without money.</HI> Indeed tis very fitting that <HI>Hee</HI> or <HI>Shee</HI> should have wher∣with to support both, acording to their quality, at least to keep the Woolf from the door, otherwise 'twere a meer madnes to marry:
<PB N="255" REF="180"/>
But he who hath enough of his own to maintain a Wife, and mar∣rieth only for money, discovereth a poor sordid disposition. Ther i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> nothing that my nature disdaines more, than to be a slave to silver or gold; for though they both carry the Kings face, yet they shall never reign over me, and I would I were free from all other infirmities as I am from this: I am none of those Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>monists who adore white and red earth, and make their Prince's picture their Idoll that way; such may be said to be under a perpetuall eclips, for the earth stands alwaies 'twixt them, and the fair face of Heaven. Yet my genius prompts me, that I was born under a Planet, not to die in a Lazaretto. At my nativity, my ascen∣dant was that hot constellation of <HI>Cancer</HI> about the midst of the Dog-daies, and as my <HI>Ephemerides</HI> tells me, <HI>Mars</HI> was then pre∣dominant: Of all the Elements <HI>fire</HI> swayes most in me; I have many aspirings▪ and airy od thoughts swell often in me, according to the quality of the ground wheron I was born, which was the bel∣ly of a huge Hill situated South-East, so that the house I came from (besides my Father and Mothers Coat) must needs be <HI>Illu∣strious,</HI> being more obvious to the Sun-beams than ordinary. I have upon occasion of sudden distemper, sometimes a madman, somtimes a fool, somtimes a melancholy od fellow to deal withall, I mean my self, for I have the humors within me that belongs to all three, therfore who would cast herself away upon such a one? Besides, I came tumbling out into the World a pure <HI>Cadet,</HI> a true <HI>Cosmopolite,</HI> not born to Land, Lease, House or Office; 'tis true, I have purchas'd since, a small spot of ground upon <HI>Parnassus,</HI> which I hold in fee of the Muses, and I have endeavoured to ma∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e it as well as I could, though I confess it hath yeelded me little fruit hitherto: And what woman would be so mad, as to take that only for her joynture?</P>
<P>But to com to the point of <HI>Wiving,</HI> I would have you know, that I have, though never married, divers children already; som <HI>French,</HI> som <HI>Latin,</HI> one <HI>Italian,</HI> and many <HI>English;</HI> and though they be but poor bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s of the brain, yet are they legitimat, and <HI>Apollo</HI> himself vouchsafed to co-operat in their production: I have expos'd them to the wide world, to try their fortunes; and som (out of comple∣ment) would make me believe they are long liv'd.</P>
<P>But to com at last to <HI>your</HI> kind of <HI>Wiving,</HI> I acknowledge, that marriage is an <HI>honourable</HI> condition, nor dare I think otherwise without profanenes, for it is that Epithet the Holy Text gives it: Therfore it was a wild speech of the Philosopher to say, That <HI>if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rsasition could be without women, Angells would com down and</HI>

<P>But I wonder why you write to me of <HI>Wiving,</HI> when you know I have much ado to man or maintain my self, as I told you be∣fore; yet, notwithstanding, that the better part of my daies are already threeded upon the string of <HI>time,</HI> I will not despair, but I may have a Wife at last, that may perhaps enable me to build Hos∣pitalls; for although nine long lustres of yeers have now pass'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>re my head, and som <HI>winters</HI> more, (for all my life, considering the few Sun-shines I have had, may be call'd nothing but <HI>win∣ters</HI>) yet, I thank God for't, I find no symptom of decay, either in body, senses, or intellectualls. But writing thus extravagant∣ly, me thinks I hear you say, That this <HI>Letter</HI> shews I begin to dote, and grow idle, therfore I will display my self no further unto you at this time.</P>
<P>To tell you the naked truth my dear <HI>Tom;</HI> The highest pitch of my aym is, that by som condition or other, I may be enabled at last (though I be put to <HI>sow,</HI> the time that others use to <HI>reap</HI>) to quitt scores with the World, but never to cancell that precious obligation, wherin I am indissolubly bound to live and die</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have more thanks to give you then can be folded up in this narrow paper, though it were all writ in the closest kind of <HI>Stenography,</HI> for the rich and acurat account you please to give me of that renowned City wherin you now sojourn: I find you have most iudiciously pryed into all matters both <HI>civill</HI> and <HI>clericall,</HI> es∣pecially the latter, by observing the <HI>poverty</HI> and penances of the <HI>Fryer,</HI> the <HI>policy</HI> and power of the <HI>Iesuit,</HI> the pomp of the <HI>Prelat</HI> and <HI>Cardinall:</HI> Had it not bin for the two first, I beleeve the two last, and that <HI>See</HI> had bin at a low <HI>ebb</HI> by this time; for the lear∣ning, the prudentiall state, knowledge and austerity of the one, and the venerable opinion the peeple have of the abstenious and rigid condition of the other, specially of the Mendicants, seem to make som compensation for the lux and magnificence of the two last: Besides, they are more beholden to the Protestant then they are aware of, for unles he had rise up about the latter end of the last century of yeers, which made them more circumspect and wary of their waies, life, and actions, to what an intollera∣ble high exces that Court had com to by this time, you may easily conjecture. But out of my small reading I have observed that no age ever since <HI>Gregory</HI> the great hath passed, wherin som or other have not repind and murmurd at the pontificall pomp of that Court, yet for my part I have bin alwaies so charitable as to think that the <HI>Religion</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> were different things. The counterbuffe that happen'd 'twixt <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth, and <HI>Francis</HI> the first of <HI>France</HI> is very remarkeable, who being both met at <HI>Bolonia,</HI> the King seemd to give a light touch at the Popes pomp, saying, '<HI>twas not used to be so in former time. It may be so, said</HI> Leo, <HI>but it was then when Kings kept sheep,</HI> (as we read in the old Testament.) no, the King replyed, I speak of times under the Gospel, then, rejoind the Pope, '<HI>twas than when Kings did visit Hospitalls,</HI> hinting by those words at St. <HI>Lewis</HI> who used oft to do so. It is memorable what is recorded in the life of <HI>Robert Grosted</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> who liv'd in the time of one of the <HI>Leo's,</HI> That he feard <HI>the same sia would overthrow</HI> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>o, <HI>as overthrew</HI> Lucifer.</P>

<P><PB N="10" REF="188" MS="y"/>The first Religion that ever was reduced to exact rules and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>i∣ruall observances was that of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> the ancient peeple of God, called afterwards <HI>Iudaisme,</HI> the second <HI>Christianity,</HI> the third <HI>Mahometisme</HI> which is the youngest of all religions; Touch∣ing <HI>Paganisme,</HI> and heathenish Idolatrie they scarce deserve the name of Religion, but for the former three ther is this analogy be∣tween them, that they all agree in the first person of the Trinity and all his attributes; What kind of Religion ther was before the Floud, it is in vain to make any researches, ther having bin no monuments at all left, (besides that little we find in <HI>Moses</HI> and the Phaenician story) but <HI>Seths</HI> pillars, and those so defac'd, that no∣thing was legible upon them, though <HI>Iosephus</HI> saith that one was ex∣tant in his daies: as also the oke under which <HI>Abraham</HI> feasted God Almighty, which was 2000 yeers after.

<P>The Jews at this day are divided to three Sects, the first, which is the greatest, are call'd the <HI>Talmudists,</HI> in regard that besides the Holy Scriptures they embrace the <HI>Talmud,</HI> which is stuff'd with the traditions of their Rabbins and Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ams; The second re∣ceive the Scripture alone; The third the Pentateuch only, <HI>viz.</HI> the five Books of <HI>Moses</HI> which are called <HI>Samaritanes.</HI> Now touch∣ing what part of the earth is possessed by Jews, I cannot find they have any at all peculiar to themselves, but in regard of their mur∣murings, their frequent Idolatries, defections, and that they cru∣cified the Lord of life, this once select Nation of God, and the Inhabitants of the Land flowing with milk and hony, is becom now a scorned squandered peeple all the earth over, being ever since incapable of any coalition or reducement into one body po∣litic; There where they are most without mixture is <HI>Tiberias</HI> in <HI>Palestine</HI> which <HI>Amurath</HI> gave <HI>Mendez</HI> the Jew, whither, and to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> upon any conveniency they convey the bones of their dead friends from all places to be reinterred: They are to be found in all Mercantile <HI>Towns</HI> and great Marts, both in <HI>Africk, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> the dominions of <HI>England,</HI> of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and <HI>French</HI> excepted, and as their <HI>persons</HI> so their <HI>profession</HI> is despicable, be∣ing for the most part but Brokers every where: Among other places they are allowed to be in <HI>Rome</HI> her self near St. <HI>Peters</HI> chair,

for they advance trade whersoever they com; with the banks of mony, and so are permitted as <HI>necessary evills:</HI> but put case the whol Nation of the Jews now living were united into one colle∣ctive body, yet, according to the best conjecture and exactest com∣putation that I could hear made by the knowingst men, they would not be able to peeple a countrey bigger then the seventeen Provinces: Those that are dispersed now in Christendom, and Turky, are the remnants only of the Tribes of <HI>Iuda,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> with som <HI>Levites</HI> which returned from <HI>Babylon</HI> with <HI>Zerubbabel:</HI> The common opinion is, that the other ten are utterly lost, but they themselves fancy that they are in <HI>India</HI> a mighty nation environed with stony rivers, which alwaies cease to run their course on their Sabbath, from whence they expect their Messias who shall in the fulnes of time ore run the world with fire and sword, and reesta∣blish them in a temporall glorious state; But this opinion swayes most among the <HI>Orientall</HI> Jews, wheras they of the West attend the coming of their Messias from <HI>Portugall;</HI> which language is more common among them then any other: and thus much in brief of the Jews as much as I could digest, and comprehend within the compas of this paper-sheet and let it serve for the accomplishment of the first part of your desire; In my next I shall give you the best satisfaction I can concerning the extent of <HI>Christianity</HI> up and down the globe of the earth, which I shall speedily send, for now that I have undertaken such a task my pen shall not rest till I have finished it, so I am</P>

<P>HAving in my last sent you somthing touching the state of <HI>Iu∣daisin</HI> up and down the world, in this you shall receive what extent <HI>Christianity</HI> hath, which is the second Religion in succes∣sion of time and truth; A Religion <HI>that makes not sense so much subject to reason, as reason succumbent to Faith:</HI> Ther is no Re∣ligion so harsh and difficult to flesh and bloud, in regard of divers

mysterious positions it consists of, as the Incarnation, Resurrecti∣on, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nity, &amp;c. which as one sayd, <HI>are bones to Philosophy, but milk to Faith.</HI> Ther is no Religion so purely spirituall and ab∣stracted from common naturall idea's, and sensuall happines as the Christian: No Religion that excites man more to the love and practise of vertue, and hatred of vice, or that prescribes grea∣ter rewards for the one, and punishments for the other: A Reli∣gion that in a most miraculous manner did expand her self and propagat by simplicity, humblenes, and by a meer passive way of fortitude, growing up like the palm tree under the heavy weight of persecution; for never any Religion had more powerfull op∣position, by various kinds of punishments, oppressions and tor∣tures which may be said to haue deckd her with <HI>rubies</HI> in her very cradle; In so much that it is granted by her very enemies, that the Christian in point of <HI>passive</HI> valour hath exceeded all other na∣tions upon earth: And ▪tis a thing of wonderment how at her ve∣ry first growth, she flew over the heads of so many interjacent vast Regions into this remote Isle so soon, that her rays should shine up∣on the Crown of a British King first of any, I mean King <HI>Lucius,</HI> the true Proto <HI>Christian</HI> King in the daies of <HI>Eleutherius,</HI> at which time she receiv'd her <HI>propagation;</HI> but for her <HI>plantation</HI> she had it long before by som of the Apostles themselves. Now, as Christian Religion hath the purest and most abstracted, the har∣dest and highest spirituall notions, so it hath bin most subject to differences of opinions and distractions of conscience, the purer the wheat is the more subject 'tis to tares, and the most precious gems to flaws. The first bone that the Devill flung was into the Ea∣stern Churches, then twixt the Greek and the Roman, but it was rather for jurisdiction and power then for the fundamentalls of faith, and lately twixt <HI>Rome</HI> and the North-west Churches: Now the extent of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Church is larger far then that of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> (excluding <HI>America</HI>) which makes som accuse her as well of uncharitablenes as of arrogance that she should positively damne so many millions of Christian souls who have the same common simboll of faith with her, because they are not within the close of her fold.</P>
<P>Of those Eastern and Southeast Churches, ther are no less the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> eleven Sects, wherof the three principallest are the <HI>Grecian,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <HI>Iacobite,</HI> and the <HI>Nestorian,</HI> with whom the rest have som depen∣dence or conformity, and they acknowledg canonicall obedience either to the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> of <HI>Ierus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣lem,</HI> or <HI>Antioch:</HI> They concur with the Western Reformed Chur∣ches
<PB N="13" REF="189"/>
in divers positions against <HI>Rome,</HI> as in deniall of Purgatory; in rejecting extremeunction, and celebrating the Sacrament un∣der both kinds; in admitting their Clergy to marry▪ in abhor∣ring the use of massie statues, and celebrating their Liturgie in the vulgar language; Among these the <HI>Russe,</HI> and the <HI>Habassi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> Emperours are the greatest, but the latter is a <HI>Iew</HI> also from the girdle downward, for he is both <HI>circumcised</HI> and <HI>christened,</HI> having received the one from <HI>Salomon,</HI> and the other from the Apostle Saint <HI>Thomas;</HI> They observe other rites of the Leviticall Law; they have the <HI>cross</HI> in that esteem that they imprint the signe of it upon som part of the childs body wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n he is baptized; that day they take the holy Sacrament they spit not till after sunset, and the Emperour in his progresses as soon as he comes to the fight of a Church, lights off his camell, and foots it all along, till he loseth the sight of it.</P>
<P>Now touching that proportion of ground that the Christians have on the habitable earth, (which is the main of our task) I find that all <HI>Europe</HI> with her adjacent Isles is peepled with Christians, except that ruthfull Country of <HI>Lapland</HI> where Idolaters yet in∣habit; towards the <HI>East</HI> also that Region which lieth 'twixt <HI>Tana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> and <HI>Boristhenes</HI> the ancient Countrey of the <HI>Goths</HI> is possessed by Mahumetan Tartars; but in these Territories which the Turk hath 'twixt the <HI>Danube</HI> and the sea, and 'twixt <HI>Ragusa,</HI> and <HI>Buda,</HI> Chri∣stians are intermixt with Mahometans, yet in this cohabitation Christians are computed to make two third parts at least, for here and elsewhere, all the while they pay the Turk the <HI>quarter</HI> of their encrease, and a <HI>Sulta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y</HI> for every poll, and speak nothing in derogation of the Alcoran, they are permitted to enjoy both their religion and lives securely. In <HI>Constantinople</HI> her self under the Grand signiours nose, they have twenty Churches, in <HI>Saloni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e</HI> (or <HI>Thessa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>onica</HI>) 30. Ther are 150 Churches under the Me∣tropolitan of <HI>Philippi,</HI> as many under him of <HI>Atheus,</HI> and he of <HI>Corinth</HI> hath about an hundred suffragan Bishops under him.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Africk</HI> (a thing which cannot be too much lamented) that huge extent of Land which Christianity possessed of old 'twixt the Mediterranean Sea, and the Mountaine <HI>Atlas,</HI> yea as far as <HI>Egypt,</HI> with the large Region of <HI>Nubia,</HI> the Turkes have overma∣stered: We read of 200 Bishops met in Synods in those parts; and in that Province where old <HI>Carthage</HI> stood, ther wer 164 Bi∣shops under one Metropolitan; but <HI>Mahometisme</HI> hath now over∣spread all there about, only the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath a few Maritim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ownes under Christian subjection, as <HI>Septa, Tonger, Oran</HI> and
<PB N="14" REF="190"/>
others. But through all the huge continent of <HI>Afric,</HI> which it e∣stimated to be thrice bigger then <HI>Europe,</HI> ther is not one Region entirely Christian, but <HI>Habassia</HI> or <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> besides ther is in <HI>Egypt</HI> a considerable number of them yet sojourning: Now <HI>Ha∣bassia</HI> according to the itineraries of the observingst travellers in those parts, is thought to be in respective magnitude as big as <HI>Germany, Spain, France,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> conjunctly; an estimate which comes nearer truth then that which som make, by stretching it from one <HI>tropic</HI> to the other, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Red Sea to the We∣stern Ocean; ther are also divers Isles upon the Coast of <HI>Afric</HI> that are coloniz'd with Christians, as the <HI>Madera,</HI> the <HI>Canari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, Cape Verd,</HI> and Saint <HI>Thomas;</HI> but on the Eastside ther's none but <HI>Zoeotora.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Asia</HI> ther's the Empire of <HI>Russia</HI> that's purely Christian, and the Mountain <HI>Libanus</HI> in <HI>Syria;</HI> in other parts they are mingled with Mahometanes, who exceed them one day more then ano∣ther in numbers specially in those Provinces (the more's the pitty) where the Gospel was first preached, as <HI>Anatolia, Armenia, Siris, Mesopotamia, Palestina, Chaldea, Assiria, Persia,</HI> the north of <HI>Ara∣bia,</HI> and south of <HI>India;</HI> in som of these parts I say, specially in the four first, Christians are thick mixt with Mahometanes, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> also in East <HI>India</HI> since the <HI>Portugalls</HI> discovery of the passage by the cape of good hope, christians by Gods goodnes have multiplyed in considerable numbers, as likewise in <HI>Goa</HI> since it was made a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Archbishoprick, and the Court of a Viceroy: They speak also of a Christian Church in <HI>Quinsay</HI> in <HI>China</HI> the greatest of all earthly Cities; but in the Islands thereabouts called the <HI>Philippinas,</HI> which they say are above 1100 in number, in thirty wherof the Spani∣ard hath taken firm footing. Christianity hath made a good pro∣gres, as also in <HI>Iaponia:</HI> in the North-east part of <HI>Asia</HI> som 400 yeers since, Christianity had taken deep root under the King of <HI>Tenduc,</HI> but he was utterly overthrown by <HI>Chingis</HI> one of his ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> vassalls, who came therby to be the first founder of the Tartarias Empire, this King of <HI>Tenduc</HI> was the true <HI>Prester Iohn,</HI> not the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> King of the <HI>Habassins,</HI> as <HI>Scaliger</HI> would have it, whose opinion is as far distant from truth in this point, as the Souther∣nest part of <HI>Afric</HI> from the Northeast part of <HI>Asia,</HI> or as a <HI>Ie∣cobite</HI> is from a <HI>Nestorian:</HI> Thus far did Christianity find enter∣tainment in the old world, touching the new, I mean <HI>America▪</HI> which is conjectured to equall, well near, the other three parts i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> magnitude, the Spanish Authors and Merchants (with whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> have conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>sed) make report of a marvelous growth that Chri∣stianity

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY two former were of <HI>Iudaisme and Christianity,</HI> I ▪com now to the <HI>Mahometane</HI> the modernst of all Religions, and the most mischievous, and destructive to the Church of Christ, for this fatall sect hath justled her out of divers large Regions in <HI>A∣fric,</HI> in <HI>Tartarie,</HI> and other places, and attenuated their number in <HI>Asia</HI> which they do whersoever they com; having a more poli∣tic and per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>icious way to do it then by fire and fagot, for they ha∣ving understood well that the <HI>dust</HI> of Martyrs were the thrivingst <HI>seeds</HI> of Christianity, and observ'd that ther r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ignes naturally in mankind, being compos'd all of one lump, and carrying the same stamp, a generall kind of compassion and sympathy, which ap∣peares most towards them who lay down their lives, and postpose all worldly things for the preservation of their consciences, (and never any diedso, but he drew followers after him) therfore the Turk goes a more cunning way to work, he meddles not with life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nd limbe to prevent the sense of compassion which may arise that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ay, but he grinds their faces with Taxes, and makes them inca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>able of any offices either of authority, profit or honor, by which meanes he renders them despicable to others, and makes their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>yes irksom to themselves: yet the Turks have a high opinion of

<P>It is the <HI>Alfange</HI> that ushers in the <HI>faith</HI> of <HI>Mahomet</HI> every where, nor can it grow in any place, unles it be planted and sown with Gunpowder intermixt; when planted, ther are divers waies of policy to preserve it, they have their <HI>Alcoran</HI> in one only lan∣guage, which is the <HI>Arabic,</HI> the mother toung of their Prophet, 'tis as bad as death for any to raise scruples of the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> Ther∣upon ther is a restraint of the study of Philosophy, and other lear∣ning, because the impostors of it may not be di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>cernd; the <HI>Mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> is in as great reverence among them, as the <HI>Pope</HI> is among the Ro∣manists; For they hold it to be a true principle in divinity, that <HI>no one thing preserves and improves Religion more then a venerable big<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> pious esteem of the chiefest ministers;</HI> They have no other guide o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>aw both for temporall and Church-affairs then the <HI>Alcoran</HI> which they hold to be the <HI>rule of civill justice, as well as the divine cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of their salvation;</HI> so that their Judges are but expositors of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> only, nor do they trouble themselves, or puzle the plaintiffe with any moth-eaten records, or precedents to entangle the busines, but they immediately determine it, according to the fresh circum∣stances of the action, <HI>&amp; secundum allegata, &amp; probata</HI> by wit∣nesses; They have one extraordinary piece of humanity to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tender of the rationall soul, as not to put Christian, Jew, Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> or any other to his Oath, in regard that if for som advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gain or occasion of inconvenience and punishment any should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sweare himself, they hold the imposers of the Oath to be accessary to the damnation of the perjurd man; By these and divers oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> reaches of policy (besides their arms) not practis'd elsewhere they conserve that huge bulk of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire which exten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> without interruption (the <HI>Hell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>spont</HI> only between) in one cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>-nued peece of earth two and thirty hundred miles, from <HI>Buda</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Hungary</HI> to a good way into <HI>Persia;</HI> by these means they keep al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> their Religion from distracting opinions, from every vulgar fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣cy, and Scismes in their Church, for ther's no where fewer th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> heer; the difference that is, is only with the <HI>Persian,</HI> and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in fundamentalls of faith, but for priority of Government in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>That part of the world wher <HI>Mahomet</HI> hath furthest expanded himself is <HI>Asia,</HI> which as I said before, exceeds <HI>Afric</HI> in greatnes, and much more in peeple; he hath firm footing in <HI>Persia, Tartary</HI> (upon the latter of which the <HI>Musulman</HI> empire is entayld) in <HI>Tur∣comania</HI> it self, and <HI>Arabia,</HI> four mighty Kingdomes; the last of these was the nest wher that Cocatrice egge was hatched, which hath diffus'd its poyson so far and near, through the veines of so many Regions; All the Southerly coasts of <HI>Asia,</HI> from the <HI>Arabian</HI> Bay to the river <HI>Indus</HI> is infected therwith, the vast Kingdom of <HI>Cambaia</HI> and <HI>Bengula,</HI> and about the Southpart of the inhabitants of <HI>Malabar</HI> have drank of this poyson; insomuch that by no wrong computation it may well be said that <HI>Mahometisme</HI> hath dispersed it self over almost one half of the huge continent of <HI>Asia,</HI> besides those multitudes of Isles, specially seven, <HI>Moldivia,</HI> and <HI>Ceylan,</HI> the sea coasts of <HI>Sumatra, Iava, Sunda,</HI> the ports of <HI>Banda, Borneo,</HI> with divers other wherof ther are many thousands about <HI>Asia,</HI> who have entertaind the <HI>Alcoran:</HI> In <HI>Europe</HI> the <HI>Mahometanes</HI> possess all the Region twixt <HI>Don</HI> and <HI>Meper,</HI> call'd of old <HI>Tanais,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> being about the twentieth part of <HI>Europe,</HI> the King of <HI>Poland</HI> dispenceth with som of them in <HI>Lituania:</HI> Touching <HI>Greece, Mace∣don, Thracia, Bulgaria, Servia, Bosnia, Epire,</HI> the greatest part of <HI>Hungary and Dalmatia,</HI> although they be wholy under Turks o∣bedience, yet <HI>Mahometans</HI> scarce make the third part of the Inhabi∣tants.

<P>The vast propagation of this unhappy Sect may be ascribed first to the <HI>Sword,</HI> for the <HI>conscience commonly is apt to follow the Con∣querer;</HI> Then to the loose reines it gives to all sensuall liberty, as to have eight wives and as many concubines as one can main∣tain, with the assurance of <HI>Venerean</HI> delights in a far higher degree to succeed after death to the religious observers of it, as the fruiti∣on

<P>HHaving in my three former letters washed my hands of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> and the <HI>Iew,</HI> and attended <HI>Christianity</HI> up and down the earth, I com now to the <HI>Pagan, Idolater, or Heathen,</HI> who (the more to be lamented) make the greatest part of mankind; <HI>Europe</HI> her self, though the beames of the cross have shin'd upon her above these sixteen ages, is not free of them; for they possess to this day <HI>Lappia, Corelia, Biarmia, Scrifinnia,</HI> and the north parts of <HI>Finmark,</HI> there are also som shreds of them to be found in divers places of <HI>Lutuania,</HI> and <HI>Somogitia</HI> which make a region nine hundred miles in compas.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Afric</HI> their number is incredible, for from <HI>cape Blanc</HI> the most westerly Point of <HI>Afric</HI> all southward to the Cape of good Hope, and thence turning by the back of <HI>Afric</HI> to the Cape of <HI>Mo∣zambric,</HI> all these coasts being about the one half of the circumfe∣rence of <HI>Afric</HI> is peepled by <HI>Idolaters,</HI> though in som places inter∣mixt with <HI>Mahometans and Christians,</HI> as in the Kingdom of <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>Angola:</HI> But if we survey the inland territories of <HI>Afric</HI> be∣tween the river of <HI>Nile,</HI> and the west sea of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> even all that Countrey from about the north paralell of ten degrees, to the south paralell of six degrees, all is held by <HI>Idolaters,</HI> besides, the Kingdom of <HI>Borno,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Nubia</HI> and <HI>Lybia,</HI> continue still in their old <HI>Paganisme,</HI> so that by this account above one half of that immence continent of <HI>Afric</HI> is peepled by <HI>Idolaters.</HI> But in <HI>Asia,</HI> which is far more spatious and more populous then <HI>Afric, Pagans, Idolaters, and Gentiles, Swarm</HI> in greater numbers, for from the River <HI>Pechora</HI> Eastward to the Ocean, and thence Southward to the Cape of <HI>Cincapura,</HI> and from that point returning Westward by the South coasts to the out-lets of the River <HI>Indus,</HI> all that ma∣ritine tract which makes a good deal more then half the circumfe∣rence of <HI>Asia</HI> is inhabited by <HI>Idolaters;</HI> so are the inland parts: Ther are two mighty mountaines that traverse all <HI>Asia, Taurus and Imaus,</HI> the first runs from West to East, the other from North to South, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quarter and cut that huge mass of earth into e∣quall parts, this side those mountaines most of the peeple are <HI>Ma∣hometans,</HI>

but tother side, they are all Idolaters: And as on the firm continent <HI>Paganisme</HI> thus reigns, so in many thousand Islands that lye squandred in the vast Ocean, on the East and South east of <HI>A∣sia,</HI> Idolatry orespreads all, except in some few Islands that are possess'd by <HI>Spaniards and Arabs.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly if one take a survey of <HI>America</HI> (as none hath done yet exactly) which is estimated to be as big as all the old earth, <HI>Idola∣ters</HI> ther possesse four parts of five; 'Tis true som years after the first Navigation thither, they were converted daily in great multitudes, but afterwards observing the licentious lives of the Christians, their greedines for gold, and their cruelty, they came not in so fast: which made an Indian answer a Spanish Fryer who was dis∣coursing with him of the joyes of Heaven, and how all Spaniards went thither after this life, Then said the Pagan, <HI>I do not desire to go thither if Spaniards be there, I had rather go to Hell to be free of their Company: America</HI> differs from the rest of the earth in this, that she <HI>hath</HI> neither <HI>Iew</HI> nor <HI>Mahometan</HI> in her, but <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> only: Ther are besides all those Religions and peeple before mentioned, an irregular confus'd nation in <HI>Europe</HI> call'd the <HI>Mor∣duits;</HI> which occupy the middle confines betwixt the <HI>Tartars</HI> and the <HI>Russe,</HI> that are mingled in Rites of Religion with all those that have been fore-spoken; for from the privy members upward they are <HI>Christians</HI> in regard they admit of Baptisme, from the Navell downward they are <HI>Mahometans</HI> or <HI>Iews</HI> for they are circumcis'd, and besides they are given to the adoration of heathenish Idolls: In <HI>Asia</HI> ther are the <HI>Card<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> which inhabit the mountanous Country about <HI>Mozall,</HI> between <HI>Armenia and Mesop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tamia,</HI> and the <HI>Druci</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> who are demi <HI>Mahometans, and Christians.</HI></P>
<P>Now concerning Pagans and heathenish Idolaters wherof ther are innumerable sorts up and down the surface of the earth, in my opinion those are the excusablest kind who adore the Sun and Moon with the Host of Heaven, and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the kerns of the mountains, with some of the Scotch Isles, use a fashion of adoring the new Moon to this very day, praying <HI>she would leave them in as good health as she found them,</HI> this is not so gross and Idolatry as that of other Heathens; for the adoration of those glorious Celestiall bodies is more excusable than that of Garlick, and Onions with the <HI>Egyptian,</HI> who I think (with the <HI>Sicyonian</HI>) was the ancientest Idolater upon earth which he makes thrice older than we do, for <HI>Diodorus S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>culus</HI> reports that the <HI>Egyptian</HI> had a Religion and Kings, eighteen thou∣sand yeers since: yet for matter of Philosophy and Science, he had it from the <HI>Chaldean,</HI> He from the <HI>Gymnotophists</HI> and <HI>Brachmans</HI> of

<HI>India,</HI> which Countrey as she is the next neighbor to the rising Sun, in reference to this side of the Hemisphear, so the beams of learn∣ing did first enlighten her: <HI>Egypt</HI> was the Nurse of that famous <HI>Hermes Trismagistus,</HI> who having no other scale but that of naturall reason, mounted very high towards heaven, for he hath many very divine sayings, wherof I think it not impertinent to insert here a few, first he saith, <HI>that all humane sins are veniall with the Gods, impiety excepted.</HI> 2.

<P>From <HI>Egypt</HI> Theoricall knowledg came down the <HI>Nile</HI> and lan∣ded at som of the <HI>Greek</HI> Islands, wher 'twixt the 33, 34, and the 35 Century of yeers after the Creation, there flourished all those renowned Philosophers that sway now in our Schools; <HI>Plato</HI> flew highest in divine notions, for som call him another <HI>Moses speaking athenian;</HI> In one of his Letters to a friend of his, he writes thus, <HI>When I seriously salute thee, I begin my Letter with one God, when otherwise with many,</HI> his Schollar <HI>Aristotle</HI> commended him∣self at his death to the <HI>Being of Beings;</HI> and <HI>Socrates</HI> may be said to be a Martyr for the first Person of the <HI>Trinity:</HI> these great Se∣cretaries of Nature by studying the vast Volume of the World came by main strength of reason to the knowledg of one Deity or <HI>primus motor,</HI> and of his attributes; they found by undenyable consequences that he was <HI>infinite, eternall, ubiquitary, omnipotent, and not capable of a definition;</HI> which made the Philosopher, being com∣manded by his King to define God, to ask the respite of a day to meditat theron, then two, then four, at last he ingeniously confes∣sed that the more he thought to dive into this mystery, the more he was <HI>ingulph'd in the speculation of it:</HI> for the quiddity and essence of the incomprehensible Creator, cannot imprint any formall con∣ception upon the finite intellect of the Creature, to this I might refer the Altar which Saint <HI>Paul</HI> found among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> with this Inscription, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>▪ To the unknown God.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Greek</HI> Isles, Philosophy came to <HI>Italy,</HI> thence to this Western world among the <HI>Druydes,</HI> whereof those of this Isle were most celebrous, for wee read that the <HI>Gauls</HI> (now the <HI>French</HI>) came to <HI>Britanny</HI> in great numbers to be instructed by them. The <HI>Romans</HI> wer mighty great Zelots in their Idolatry, and their best Authors affirm, that they extended their Monarchy so far and neer, by a particular reverence they had of their Gods, (which the <HI>Spani∣ard</HI> seems now to imitate) though those Gods of theirs wer made of men, and of good fellows at first, besides in the course of their
<PB N="22" REF="194"/>
conquest, they adopted any strange Gods to the society of theirs, and brought them solemnly to <HI>Rome,</HI> and the reason as one saith was, that they believed the <HI>more Gods they had the safer they were, a few being not sufficient to conserve and protect so great an Empire:</HI> The <HI>Roman Gentiles</HI> had their Altars and Sacrifices, their Arch∣flamins, and vestall Nuns; And it seems the same genius reigns still in them, for in the Primitive Church, that which the Pagans misliked most in Christianity was, that it had not the face and form of a religion, in regard it had no Oblations, Altars &amp; Images, which may be a good reason why the Sacrifices of the Mass and other Ceremonies wer first instituted to allure the Gentiles to Christia∣nity. But to return a little further to our former subject in the condition that man-kind stands now, if the Globe of the earth wer divided to thirty parts, tis thought that Idolaters (with hor∣ror I speak it) having as I said before, the one half of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>A∣fric,</HI> both for the inland Country and Maritim Coasts with four parts of five in <HI>America</HI> inhabit twenty parts of those Regions that are already found out upon earth, besides in the opinion of the know∣ingst and most inquisitive Mathematitions, ther is towards the <HI>sou∣thern</HI> clime as much land yet undiscovered as may equal in dimen∣sion the late new world, in regard, as they hold ther must be of necessity such a portion of earth to balance the Centre on all sides, and tis more than probable, that the Inhabitants there must be <HI>Pa∣gans.</HI> Of all kind of Idolaters those are the horridest, who adore the Devill whom they call <HI>Tantara,</HI> who appears often unto them specially in a <HI>Haraucane</HI> though he be not visible to others; In som places they worship both God and the Devill, the one, that he may do them good, the other, that they may do them no hurt; the first they call <HI>tantum,</HI> the other <HI>squantum.</HI> 'Twere presumption beyond that of <HI>Lucifers</HI> or <HI>Adam's</HI> for man to censure the justice of the Creator in this particular, why hee makes daily such innume∣rable vessells of dishonor; It is a wiser and safer course far to sit down in an humble admiration and cry out, on the profound in∣scrutable judgments of God! his ways are past finding out, and so to acknowlege with the divine Philosopher, <HI>Quod oculus vesper∣tilionis ad solem, idem est omnis intellectus humanus ad Deum,</HI> what the Eye of a Bat is to the Sun, the same is all human understan∣ding to God-wards.</P>
<P>Now to draw to a Conclusion, touching the respective largnes of <HI>Christianity</HI> and <HI>Mahometisme</HI> upon the earth, I find the first to exceed, taking the new world with the old, considering the spa∣cious Plantations of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> the Colonies the
<PB N="23" REF="194"/>
<HI>English</HI> have there in <HI>Virginia, New-England</HI> and <HI>Charibbi</HI> Islands; with those of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> and of the <HI>Hollander</HI> in <HI>East India:</HI> nor do I find that ther is any region purely <HI>Mahometan</HI> without intermixtures, as <HI>Christianity</HI> hath many: which makes me to be of a differing opinion to that Gentleman, who held that <HI>Christianity added little to the generall religion of man-kind.</HI></P>
<P>Now touching the latitude of Christian faith, in reference to the differing Professors therof, as in my former I shewd that the Eastern Churches were more spacious than the <HI>Latin or Roman</HI> (ex∣cepting the two Indies) so they who have fallen off from her in the Western parts are not so far inferior to her in <HI>Europe</HI> as som would make one beleeve; which will appear if we cast them in counterbalance.</P>
<P>Among <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> ther is the Emperor, and in him the King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> the three Kings of <HI>Spain, France,</HI> and <HI>Poland;</HI> all <HI>Italy,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Savoy, Bavaria,</HI> and <HI>Lorain,</HI> the three spirituall Electors with som few more; Touching them who have renounc'd all obedience to <HI>Rome,</HI> ther are the three Kings of <HI>great Britain, Den∣mark</HI> and <HI>Swethland,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxon, Holstein,</HI> and <HI>Wittemberg:</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and <HI>Baden,</HI> the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse;</HI> most of the <HI>Hansiatic</HI> Towns which are 88 in number▪ som wherof are equall to Republiques, the (almost) seven Provinces the <HI>Hol∣lander</HI> hath.

<P>THer are two sayings which are father'd upon Secretary <HI>Wal∣singham</HI> and Secretary <HI>Cecil,</HI> a pair of the best weighd Statesmen this Island hathbred: one was used to say at the Coun∣cell Table, <HI>My Lords stay a little, and we shall make an end the sooner:</HI> the other would oft-times speak of himself, <HI>It shall never be said of me that I will d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>fer till to morrow what I can do to day:</HI> At first view these sayings seem'd to clash with one another, and to be diametrically opposite, but being rightly understood, they may be very well reconcil'd: Touching the first, 'Tis true, <HI>that hast and choler are enemies to all great actions;</HI> for as it is a principle in Chimistry that <HI>omnis festinatio est a Diabolo,</HI> all hast comes from Hell; so in the consultations, contrivings and conduct of any bu∣sines of State, all rashnes and precipitation comes from an ill spi∣rit: Ther cannot be a better pattern for a grave and considerat way of deliberation than the ancient course of our High Court of Parliament, who when a Law is to be made, which concerns the welfare of so many thousands of men, after a mature debate and long discussion of the point beforehand, cause the bill to be read solemnly three times in the House, ere it be transmitted to the Lords, and there also 'tis so many times canvas'd and then presen∣ted to the Prince: That which must stand for law, must be long stood upon, because it imposeth an universall obedience, and is like to be everlasting according to the <HI>Ciceronian</HI> maxime, <HI>Deliberandum est diu quod stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>endum est semel:</HI> such a kind of cunctation, ad∣visednes, and procrastination is allowable also in all Councells of State and War, <HI>for the day following may be able commonly to be a ma∣ster to the day passed,</HI> such a world of contingencies human actions are subject unto: yet under favour I beleeve this first saying to meant of matters while they are in agitation and upon the anvill, but when they have receiv'd form and are fully resolv'd upon, I beleeve then nothing is so advantagious as speed; And at this, I am of opinion, the second saying aimes at, for when the weights that use to hang to all great businesses are taken away, 'tis good then to put wings unto them, and to take the ball before the bound,

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir <HI>Edward,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had a shrewd disease hung lately upon m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, proceeding as the Physicians told me from this long reclused life, and close re∣straint, which had much wasted my spirits and brought me low: when the <HI>Crisis</HI> was past, I began to grow doubtfull, that I had but a short time to breath in this elementary world, my feaver still encreasing, and finding my soule weary of this muddy mansion, and me thought more weary of this prison of flesh, than this flesh was of this prison of the Fleet. Therfore after som gentle slum∣bers, and unusuall dreames about the dawnings of the day, I had a <HI>lucid</HI> intervall, and so I fell a thinking how to put my little house in order, and to make my last will. Heerupon my thoughts ran upon <HI>Grunnius sophista's</HI> last Testament, who having nothing else to dispose of but his body, he bequeathed all the parts therof in Legacies, as his skin to the Tanners, his bones to the Dice makers, his guts to the Musitians, his fingers to the Scrive∣ners, his toung to his fellow sophisters, (which were the Lawyers of those times) and so forth: as he thus dissected his <HI>body</HI> so I thought to divide my <HI>mind</HI> into legacies, having as you know lit∣tle of the outward pelf and gifts of fortune to dispose of, for ne∣ver any was less beholden to that blind baggage. In the highest degree of Theoricall contemplation, I made an entire sacrifice of my soul to her maker, who by <HI>infusing created her, and by creating infused her</HI> to actuate this small bulk of fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>sh, with an unshake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> confidence of the redemption of both in my Saviour, and conse∣quently of the salvation of the one, and resurrection of the other: my thoughts then reflected upon divers of my noble frends, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ell to proportion unto them what Legacies I held most proper▪ I thought to bequeath unto my Lord of <HI>Cherbery,</HI> and Sir <HI>K. Dig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y</HI> that little Philosophy and knowledg I have in the Mathematicks; My historicall observations and criticall researches I made into antiquity, I thought to bequeath unto Dr. <HI>Vsher</HI> Lord Primate of <HI>Ireland;</HI> My observations abroad, and inspection into forrein States, I thought to leave to my Lord <HI>G. D.:</HI> My poetry such as it is, to Mistress <HI>A. K.</HI> who I know is a great minion of the Mu∣ses:

F.</HI> (my dear Frend) to have inlayed a small peece of black marble, and caus'd this mot∣to to have bin insculp'd upon it, <HI>Huc usque peregrinus, heic domi,</HI> or this, which I would have left to his choice, <HI>Huc usque Erraticus, beie fixus;</HI> and instead of strewing my grave with <HI>flowers,</HI> I would have desired him to have grafted theron som little <HI>Tree</HI> of what sort he pleas'd, that might have taken root downward to my dust, because I have bin alwaies naturally affected to woods and groves, and those kind of vegetables, insomuch that if ther wer any such thing as a <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Metempsuchosis, I think my soul would transmigrat into som Tree, when she bids this body farewell.</P>
<P>By these extravagancies, and od Chimera's of my brain, you may well perceive that I was notwell, but distemper'd, specially in my intellectualls, according to the Spanish proverb <HI>siempre desvarios <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> la calentura,</HI> fevers have alwaies their fits of dotage.

<P>Ad to all these disasters that he hath lost within the revolution of the same yeer the Prince of <HI>Spain</HI> his unic Son in the very flow∣er of his age being but seventeen yeers old. These with the falling off of <HI>Catalonia</HI> and <HI>Portugall,</HI> with the death of his Queen not a∣bove forty, are heavy losses to the Catholick King, and must needs much enfeeble the great bulk of his Monarchy, falling out in so short a compas of time one upon the neck of another, and we are not to enter into the secret Counsells of God Almighty for a rea∣son. I have read 'twas the sensuality of the flesh that drave the <HI>Kings</HI> out of <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> out of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and brought the <HI>Moores</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI> where they kept firm footing above seven hundred yeers: I could tell you how not long before her death the late Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> took off one of her chapines, and clowted <HI>Olivares</HI> about the noddle with it, because he had accompanied the King to a Lady of pleasure, telling him, <HI>that he should know, she was Sister to a King of</HI> France, <HI>as well as wife to a King of</HI> Spain; For my part, <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> is all one to me in point of affecti∣on.

<P>Walking a little further I spyed a young boysterous Bull brea∣king over hedge and ditch to a heard of kine in the next pasture, which made me think that if that fierce strong Animal, with others of that kind knew their own strength, they world never suffer

man to be their Master; Then looking upon them quietly grasing up and down, I fell to consider that the flesh which is daily dish'd upon our Tables is but concocted grass, which is recarnified in our stomacks, and transmuted to another flesh; I fell also to think what advantage those innocent Animalls had of man, who, as soon as nature casts them into the world, find their meat dress'd, the cloth laid, and the table cover'd, they find their drink brew'd and the buttery open, their beds made, and their cloaths ready; And though man hath the faculty of reason to make him a compensa∣tion for the want of these advantages, yet this reason brings with it a thousand perturbations of mind, and perplexities of spi∣rit, griping cares, and anguishes of thought, which those harm∣les silly creatures were exempted from: Going on, I came to re∣pose my self upon the trunk of a tree, and I fell to consider fur∣ther what advantage that dull <HI>vegetable</HI> had of those feeding A∣nimalls, as not to be so troublesom and beholding to nature, nor to be so subject to starving, to diseases, to the inclemency of the weather, and to be far longer liv'd: I then spyed a great stone, and sitting a while upon't, I fell to weigh in my thoughts that that stone was in a happier condition in som respects, than either those <HI>sensitive</HI> creatures or <HI>vegetables</HI> I saw before, in re∣gard that that stone, which propagates by <HI>assimilation</HI> as the Philo∣sophers say, needed neither grass nor hay, or any aliment for re∣stauration of nature, nor water to refresh its roots, or the heat of the Sun to attract the moisture upwards to encrease growth as the other did: As I directed my pace homeward, I spyed a Kite soa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ing high in the ayr, and gently gliding up and down the clear Region so far above my head, I fell to envy the Bird extremely, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>epine at his happines that hee should have a privilege to make a nearer approach to heaven than I.</P>

<P>It is without controversie that in the nonage of the world, men and beasts had but one buttery which was the fountaine and river, nor do we read of any vines or wines till two hundred yeers after the flood, but now I do not know or hear of any nation that hath <HI>water</HI> only for their drink except the <HI>Iaponois<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> and they drink it hot too; but we may say that what beverage soever we make either by brewing, by distillation, decoction, percolation or pressing, it is but <HI>water</HI> at first, nay <HI>wine</HI> it self is but water sublim'd, be∣ing nothing else but that moysture and sap which is caus'd either by rain or other kind of irrigations about the roots of the vine and drawn up to the branches and berries by the virtuall attractive heat of the Sun, the bowells of the earth serving as a limbec to that end, which made the Italian vineyard-man (after a long drouth, and an extream hot summer, which had parch'd up all his grapes,) to complain that <HI>per mancamento d'acqua, bevo del'acqua, se io havessi acqua, beverei el vino,</HI> for want of water, I am forc'd to drink water, if I had water I would drink wine; it may be also applied to the Miller when he hath no water to drive his mills.</P>
<P>The vine doth so abhor cold, that it cannot grow beyond the 49 degree to any purpose; Therfore God and nature hath furnish'd the Northwest Nations with other inventions of beverage. In this Island the old drink was <HI>Ale,</HI> noble <HI>Ale,</HI> than which, as I heard a great forren Doctor affirm, ther is no liquor that more encreaseth the radicall moisture, and preserves the naturall heat, which are the two pillers that support the life of man; but since <HI>Beer</HI> hath
<PB N="71" REF="218"/>
<HI>hopp'd</HI> in among us, <HI>Ale</HI> is thought to be much adulterated, and nothing so good as Sir <HI>Iohn Old Castle</HI> and <HI>Smug</HI> the Smith was us'd to drink: Besides Ale and Beer, the naturall drink of part of this Isle may be said to be <HI>Metheglin, Braggot, and Mead,</HI> which differ in strength according to the three degrees of comparison: The first of the three, which is strong in the superlatif, if taken immoderately, doth stupifie more than any other liquor, and keeps a <HI>humming</HI> in the brain, which made one say that he lov'd not <HI>Metheglin</HI> because he was us'd to speak too much of the <HI>house</HI> he came from, meaning the hive: <HI>Sider and Perry</HI> are also the na∣turall drinks of part of this Isle; But I have read in som old Au∣thors of a famous drink the ancient Nation of the <HI>Picts,</HI> who li∣ved 'twixt <HI>Trent</HI> and <HI>Tweed</HI> and were utterly extinguished by the over-powring of the <HI>Scot,</HI> wer used to make of decoction of flowers, the receipt wherof they kept as a secret and a thing sacred to them∣selves, so it perish'd with them: These are all the common drinks of this Isle, and of <HI>Ireland</HI> also, where they are more given to milk and strong waters of all colours, the Prime is <HI>Vsquebagh</HI> which cannot be mado any where in that perfection, and wheras we drink it heer in <HI>aqua vitae</HI> measures, it goes down there by beer glassfulls, being more naturall to the nation.</P>
<P>In the seventeen Provinces hard by, and all low <HI>Gernmany, beer</HI> is the common naturall drink, and nothing else, so is it in <HI>Westfalia,</HI> and all the lower circuit of <HI>Saxony,</HI> in <HI>Denmark, Sweth∣land, and Norway;</HI> The <HI>Prusse</HI> hath a beer as thick as hony, in the Duke of Saxes Country, ther is beer as yellow as gold made of wheat, and it inebriates as soon as Sack. In som parts of <HI>Ger∣many</HI> they use to spice their beer, which will keep many yeers, so that at som weddings ther will be a but of beer drunk out as old as the Bride. <HI>Poland</HI> also is a beer Country, but in <HI>Russia, Muscovie,</HI> and <HI>Tartary</HI> they use <HI>mead,</HI> which is the naturallest drink of the Country, being made of the decoction of water, and hony, this is that which the Ancients call'd <HI>Hydromel;</HI> Mares milk is a great drink with the Tartar, which may be a cause why they are bigger then ordinary, for the Physicians hold, <HI>that milk enlargeth the bones, Beer strengtheneth the nerves, and wine breeds bloud sooner than any other liquor.</HI> The <HI>Turke</HI> when he hath his tripe full of pelaw, or of Muton and Rice, will go to natures cellar, either to the next Well or River to drinke water, which is his naturall common drink, for <HI>Mahomet</HI> taught them, that ther was a devill in evry berry of the grape, and so made a strict in∣hibition to all his sect from drinking of wine as a thing prophane;

<P>In <HI>Asia</HI> ther is no <HI>beer</HI> drunk at all, but Water, Wine, and an incredible variety of other drinks made of Dates, dried Raisons, Rice, divers sorts of Nutts, fruits and roots: In the Orientall Countries as <HI>Cambaia, Calicut, Narsingha,</HI> ther is a drink call'd <HI>Banque,</HI> which is rare and precious, and 'tis the height of entertain∣ment they give their guests before they go to sleep, like that <HI>Nepen∣the</HI> which the Poets speak so much of, for it provokes pleasing dreames, and delightfull phantasies, it will accommode it self to the humor of the sleeper, as if he be a souldier he will dream of victories and taking of towns, if he be in love he will think to en∣joy his mistress, if he be covetous he will dream of mountaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of Gold, &amp;c. In the <HI>Moluccas</HI> and <HI>Philippines</HI> ther is a curious drink call'd <HI>Tampoy,</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>de of a kind of Gilliflowers, and another drink call'd <HI>Otraqua</HI> that comes from a Nut, and is the more generall drink. In <HI>China</HI> they have a holy kind of liquor made of such sort of flowers for ratifying and binding of bargaines, and having
<PB N="73" REF="219"/>
drunk therof, they hold it no less than perjury to break what they promise, as they write of a River in <HI>Bythinia,</HI> whose water hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> peculiar vertue to discover a perjurer, for if he drink therof, it will presently boyl in his stomack, and put him to visible tortures; this makes me think of the River <HI>Styx</HI> among the Poets which the Gods were used to swear by, and it was the greatest oath for per∣formance of any thing.</P>
<Q>Nubila promisse <HI>Styx</HI> mihi testis erit.</Q>
<P>It puts me in mind also of that which som write of the River of <HI>Rhine</HI> for trying the legitimation of a child being thrown in, if he be a basterd he will sink, if otherwise he will not.</P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> they speak of a tree called <HI>Maguais,</HI> which affords not only good drink being pierced, but all things else that belong to the subsistence of man; they bore the trunk with a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>wger, and ther issueth out sweet potable liquor; 'twixt the rinde and the tree ther is a cotton or hempie kind of moss which they wear for their cloathing; it beares huge nuts which have excellent food in them; it shoots out hard prickles above a fathom long, and those arme them, with the bark they make Tents, and the dotard trees serve for firing.</P>
<P><HI>Afric</HI> also hath a great diversity of drinks, at having more need of them being a hotter Countrey far: In <HI>Guiney</HI> or the lower <HI>Ethi∣opia</HI> ther is a famous drink call'd <HI>Mingol,</HI> which issueth out of a tree much like the Palm, being bored; But in the upper <HI>Ethiopia</HI> or the <HI>Habassi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> countrey, they drink <HI>Mead</HI> decocted in a different manner, ther is also much wine there; the common drink of <HI>Barbary,</HI> after water, is that which is made of Dates: But in <HI>Egypt</HI> in times passed ther was beer drunk, call'd <HI>Zithus</HI> in latin, which was no other than a decoction of Barly and water, they had also a famous composition (and they use it to this day) called <HI>Chiffi,</HI> made of divers cordialls and provocative ingredients, which they throw into water to make it gustfull, they use it also for fumigati∣ons, But now the generall drink of <HI>Egypt</HI> is <HI>Nile</HI> water, which of all waters may be said to be the best, insomuch that <HI>Pindars</HI> words might be more appliable to that than to any other <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It doth not only fertilize, and extremely fatten the soil which it covers, but it helps to impregnat barren women, for ther is no place on earth wher peeple encrease and multiply faster; 'tis yel∣lowish and thick, but if one cast a few Almonds into a potfull of it, it will becom as clear as rock water, it is also in a degree of luke∣warmnes as <HI>Martialls</HI> boy</P>
<Q><PB N="74" REF="220"/>Tolle puer calices <HI>tepidique</HI> toreumata Nili.</Q>
<P>In the new world they have a world of drinks, for ther i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> no root, flower, fruit or pulse but is reducible to a potable liquor, as in the <HI>Barbado</HI> Island the common drink among the <HI>English,</HI> is <HI>Mobbi</HI> made of Potato roots: In <HI>Mexico,</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> which is the great continent of <HI>America,</HI> with other parts, it is prohibited to make Wines under great penalties for fear of starving of trade, so that all the Wines they have are sent from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the pure Wine Countries, <HI>Greece</HI> with all her Islands, <HI>Italy, Spain, France,</HI> one part of foure of <HI>Germany, Hungary,</HI> with divers Countries therabouts, all the Islands in the mediterranean and <HI>Atlantic</HI> sea, are Wine Countries.</P>
<P>The most generous wines of <HI>Spain,</HI> grow in the mid-land parts of the continent, and Saint <HI>Martin</HI> beares the bell which is near the Court; Now as in <HI>Spain</HI> so in all other wine Countries one cannot pass a daies journey but he will find a differing race of wine▪ those kinds that our Merchants carry over are those only that grow upon the sea-side, as <HI>Malagas, Sheries, Tents,</HI> and <HI>Aligants;</HI> of this last ther's little comes over right, therfore, the Vinteners make <HI>Tent</HI> (which is a name for all Wines in <HI>Spain</HI> except white) to sup∣ply the place of it; Ther is a gentile kind of white wine growes among the mountains of <HI>Galicia,</HI> but not of body enough to bear the sea, call'd <HI>Ribadavia; Portugall</HI> affords no wines worth the transporting; they have an od stone we call <HI>Yef</HI> which they use to throw into their Wines, which clarifieth it, and makes it more lasting. Ther's also a drink in <HI>Spain</HI> call'd <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>sha,</HI> which they drink between meales in hot weather, and 'tis a <HI>Hydromel</HI> made of water and hony, much of the tast of our <HI>Mead:</HI> In the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> ther's a <HI>German</HI> or two that brews beer; but for that ancient drink of <HI>Spain</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> speaks of, compos'd of flowers, the receit ther∣of is utterly lost.</P>
<P>In <HI>Greece</HI> ther are no wines that have bodies enough to bear the sea for long voyages, som few Muscadells, and Malm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>es are brought over in small Casks; nor is ther in <HI>Italy</HI> any wine trans∣ported to <HI>England</HI> but in bottles, as <HI>Verdé</HI> and others, for the length of the voyage makes them subject to <HI>pricking</HI> and to lose colour, by reason of their delicacy.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> participating of the clymes of all the Countries about her, affords wines of quality accordingly, as towards the Alpes and <HI>Italy</HI> she hath a luscious rich wine call'd <HI>Frontiniac;</HI> In the

<P>The prime wines of <HI>Germany</HI> grow about the Rhine specially in the <HI>Pfalts</HI> or lower Palatinat about <HI>Backrag,</HI> which hath its Etimo∣logie from <HI>Bacchi a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>a,</HI> for in ancient times ther was an Altar ere∣cted there to the honour of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> in regard of the richnes of the wines. Here and all <HI>France</HI> over 'tis held a great part of in∣civility for maidens to drink wine untill they are married, as it is in <HI>Spain</HI> for them to wear high shooes or to paint till than; The Germain mothers, to make their sons fall into hatred of wine, do use when they are little to put som owles eggs into a cup of Rhe∣nish, and somtimes a little living eel which twingling in the wine while the child is drinking so scares him that many com to abhor and have an antipathy to wine all their lives after.

When Sacks and Canaries were brought in first among us, they were us'd to be drunk in <HI>Aquavita</HI> measures, and 'twas held fit only for those to drink of them who us'd to carry their <HI>leggs in their hands, their eyes upon their noses,</HI> and an <HI>Alma∣nack in their bones;</HI> but now they go down every ones throat both young and old like milk.</P>
<P>The Countries that are freest from exces of drinking are <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> If a Woman can prove her Husband to have been thrice drunk, by the the ancient laws of <HI>Spain</HI> she may plead for a divorce from him: Nor indeed can the <HI>Spaniard</HI> being hot brain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> bear much drink, yet I have heard that <HI>Gondamar</HI> was once too hard for the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> when he was here in <HI>England;</HI> But the Spanish Souldiers that have bin in the Wars of <HI>Flanders</HI> will take their cups freely, and the Italians also; when I liv'd to' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> side the Alpes, a Gentleman told me a merry tale of a Liguria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Souldier who had got drunk in <HI>Genoa,</HI> and Prince <HI>Doria</HI> going horseback to walk the round one night, the Souldier took his horse by the bridle, and ask'd what the price of him was for he wanted horse, the Prince seeing in what humor he was, caus'd him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be taken into a house and put to sleep: In the morning he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for him and askd him what he would give for his horse, Sir, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the recovered Souldier, <HI>the Merchant that would have bought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yyesternight of your Highnesse, went away betimes in the morning</HI>

<P>'Tis true that in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> she made deeper impressions, the reason may be in regard ther wer far more Roman Colonies planted there, for wheras ther wer but four in this Isle, ther wer nine and twenty in <HI>France,</HI> and fifty seven in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the grea∣test entertainment the Latine Tongue found out of <HI>Italy</HI> her self, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> in these two Kingdoms; yet I am of opinion that the pure con∣gruous

grammaticall Latine was never spoken in either of them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> a vulgar vernacular Language common amongst women and children; no nor in all <HI>Italy</HI> it self except <HI>Latium:</HI> In <HI>Afric,</HI> though ther wer sixty Roman Colonies dispers'd upon that continent, yet the Latine Tongue made not such deep impressions ther nor in <HI>Asia</HI> either, nor is it to be thought that in those Colonies themselves did the common Souldier speak in that congruity as the Flamins, the Judges, the Magistrates and chief Commanders did: When the <HI>Romans</HI> sent Legions, and planted Colonies abroad 'twas for divers politicall considerations, partly to secure their new acquests, partly to abate the superfluous numbers and redundancy of <HI>Rome,</HI> then by this way they found means to employ and reward men of worth, and to heighten their minds, for the Roman spirit did rise up, and take growth with his good successes, conquests, commands and em∣ployments.</P>
<P>But the reason that the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue found not such entertain∣ment in the orientall parts, was that the Greek had fore-stall'd her, which was of more esteem among them because of the learning that was couch'd in her, and that she was more usefull for negotiation and trafic, wherunto the Greeks wer more addicted than any pee∣ple: therfore though the <HI>Romans</HI> had an ambition to make those for∣ren Nations that wer under their yoak to <HI>speak</HI> as wel as to <HI>do</HI> what pleased them, and that all orders, edicts, letters, and the Lawes themselves civill as well as martiall, wer publish'd and executed in Latine, yet I believe this Latine was spoken no otherwise among those Nations than the Spanish or <HI>Castillian</HI> Tongue is now in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> in <HI>Sicily, Sardinia, Naples,</HI> the two Indies, and other Provinciall Countreys which are under that King: Nor did the pure Latine Tongue continue long at a stand of perfection in <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Latium</HI> it self among all sorts of peeple, but she receiv'd chan∣ges and corruption, neither do I beleeve that she was born a per∣fect Language at first, but she receiv'd nutriment, and degrees of perfection with time, which matures, refines and finisheth all things: The verses of the <HI>Salii</HI> compos'd by <HI>Numa Pompilius</HI> wer scarce in∣telligible by the Flamins and Judges themselves in the wane of the Roman Common-wealth, nor the Laws of the <HI>Decemviri:</HI> And if that Latine wherin were couch'd the capitulations of peace 'twixt <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Carthage</HI> a little after the expulsion of the Kings, which are yet extant upon a pillar in <HI>Rome,</HI> wer compar'd to that which was spo∣ken in <HI>Caesars</HI> reign 140. after, at which time the Latine Tongue was mounted to the Meridian of her perfection she would be found a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> differing as Spanish now differeth from the Latine: After <HI>Caesar</HI>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last was a discourse of the <HI>Latin</HI> or Primitive <HI>Roman</HI> tongue, which may be said to be expir'd in the <HI>mark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> though living yet in the <HI>Schools,</HI> I mean she may be said to be de∣funct in point of vulgarity any time these 1000 yeers pass'd: Out of her urne have sprung up the <HI>Italian,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> wherof I am now to treat, but I think it not improper to make a research first what the radicall prime mother tongues of these Countreys wer before the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagle planted her talons upon them.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Italy,</HI> doubtles ther wer divers before the <HI>Latin</HI> did spread all over that Countrey, the <HI>Calabrian</HI> and <HI>Apulian</HI> spoke Greek, wherof som reliques are to be found to this day, but it was an <HI>adventitious</HI> no mother language to them; 'tis confess'd that <HI>Latium</HI> it self and all the territory about <HI>Rome</HI> had the <HI>Latine</HI> for its maternall and common first vernacular tongue, but <HI>Toscany</HI> and <HI>Lig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ria</HI> had others quite discrepant, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Hetruscane</HI> and <HI>Mesapian,</HI> wherof though ther be som records yet extant, yet ther are none alive that can understand them; the <HI>Oscan,</HI> the <HI>Sabin</HI> and <HI>Tusculan,</HI> are thought to be but dialects to these.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue with the coincidence of the <HI>Goths</HI> lan∣guage, and other Northern peeple, who like waves tumbled off one another, did more in <HI>Italy</HI> then any where else, for she ut∣terly abolished (upon that part of the continent) all other ma∣ternall tongues as ancient as her self, and therby her eldest daughter the <HI>Italian</HI> came to be the vulgar universall tongue to the whole Countrey; yet the <HI>Latine</HI> tongue had not the sole hand in doing this, but the <HI>Goths</HI> and other septentrionall Nations who rush'd into the <HI>Roman</HI> dition, had a share in't as I said before, and pegg'd in som words which have been ever since irremovable not only in the <HI>Italian,</HI> but also in her two younger sisters the <HI>Spanish</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> who felt also the fury of those peeple: Now the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> is the smoothest and softest running language that is, for ther is not a word except som few Monosyllables Conjunctions and
<PB N="89" REF="227"/>
Propositions, that ends with a Consonant in the whole language, nor is ther any vulgar speech which hath more subdialects in so small a tract of ground, for <HI>Italy</HI> it self affords above eight. There you have the <HI>Romane,</HI> the <HI>Toscane,</HI> the <HI>Venetian,</HI> the <HI>Mi∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tz,</HI> the <HI>Neapolitan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> the <HI>Calabresse,</HI> the <HI>Genoevais,</HI> the <HI>Picmon∣lez,</HI> you have the <HI>Corsican, Sycilian,</HI> with divers other neigh∣bouring Islands; and as the cause why from the beginning ther wer so many differing dialects in the <HI>Greek</HI> tongue was because it was slic'd into so many Islands; so the reason why ther be so many subdialects in the <HI>Italian</HI> is the diversity of governments that the Countrey is squandred into, there being in <HI>Italy</HI> at this day two Kingdomes, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Calabria;</HI> Three Republicks, <HI>viz. Venice, Genoa</HI> and <HI>Luca,</HI> and divers other absolute Prin∣ces.</P>
<P>Concerning the originall language of <HI>Spain</HI> it was without any controversie, the <HI>Bascuence</HI> or <HI>Cantabrian,</HI> which tongue and ter∣ritory neither <HI>Roman, Goth,</HI> (whence this King hath his pedigree, with divers of the Nobles) or <HI>Moore,</HI> could ever conquer; though they had overrun and taken firm footing in all the rest for many ages, therfore as the remnant of the old <HI>Britaines</HI> heer, so are the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>scainers</HI> accounted the ancient'st and unquestionablest Gentry of <HI>Spain;</HI> insomuch that when any of them is to be dubbed Knight, ther is no need of any scrutiny to be made whether he be clear of the bloud of the <HI>Morisco's</HI> who had mingled and incorporated with the rest of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> about 700 yeeres: And as the <HI>Arcadians</HI> and <HI>Attiques</HI> in <HI>Greece</HI> for their immemoriall antiquity, are said to vaunt of themselves, that the one are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> before the Moone; the other <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> issued of the earth it self, so the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>iscayner</HI> hath such like <HI>Rodomontados.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>Castilian</HI> language hath but few subdialects, the <HI>Portugues</HI> is most considerable touching the <HI>Catalan,</HI> and <HI>Valen∣tiane;</HI> they are rather dialects of the <HI>French, Gascon</HI> or <HI>Aquitani∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>;</HI> The purest dialect of the <HI>Castilian</HI> tongue is held to be in the Town of <HI>Toledo,</HI> which above other Cities of <HI>Spain</HI> hath this pri∣viledg to be arbitress in the decision of any controversie that may a∣rise touching the interpretation of any <HI>Castilian</HI> word.</P>
<P>It is an infallible rule to find out the mother and ancient'st tongue of any Countrey, to go among those who inhabit the bar∣ren'st and most mountainous places, which are posts of security and fastnes, wherof divers instances could be produc'd, but let the <HI>Biscayner</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>VVelsh</HI> in great <HI>Britain,</HI> and the Moun∣taineers in <HI>Epire</HI> serve the turn, who yet retain their ancient un∣mixt

mother tongues, being extinguish'd in all the Countrey be∣sides.</P>
<P>Touching <HI>France</HI> it is not only doubtfull, but left yet undeci∣ded what the true genuine <HI>Gallic</HI> tongue was, som would have it to be the <HI>German,</HI> som the <HI>Greek,</HI> som the old <HI>British</HI> or <HI>Welsh,</HI> and the last opinion carrieth away with it the most judicious An∣tiquaries; Now all <HI>Gallia</HI> is not meant by it, but the Countrey of the <HI>Celtae</HI> that inhabit the middle part of <HI>France,</HI> who are the true <HI>Gaules; Caesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> tell us that these <HI>Celtae,</HI> and the old <HI>Britains</HI> (wherof I gave a touch in my first letter) did mutually understand one another, and som do hold that this Island was tied to <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>Sycily</HI> was to <HI>Calabria,</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> to <HI>Germany</HI> by an Istmos or neck of land 'twixt <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Bullen,</HI> for it one do well observe the rocks of the one, and the cliffes of the other, he will judge them to be one homogeneous piece, and that they wer cut and shivered asunder by som act of violence.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Gallic</HI> tongue hath divers dialects, the <HI>Picard,</HI> that of <HI>Iersey</HI> and <HI>Garnsey</HI> (appendixes once to the Dutchy of <HI>Nor∣mandy</HI>) the <HI>Provensall,</HI> the <HI>Gascon</HI> or speech of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> which <HI>Scaliger</HI> would etymologize from <HI>Languedo'uy,</HI> wheras it comes ra∣ther from <HI>Langue de Got,</HI> for the <HI>Saracens</HI> and <HI>Goths</HI> who by their in∣cursions and long stay in <HI>Aquitain</HI> corrupted the language of that part of <HI>Gallia:</HI> Touching the <HI>Britain</HI> and they of <HI>Bearn,</HI> the one is a dialect of the <HI>Welsh,</HI> the other of the <HI>Bascuence;</HI> The <HI>VVall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n</HI> who is under the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Liegois</HI> is also a dialect of the <HI>French,</HI> which in their own Countrey they call <HI>Romand:</HI> The <HI>Spaniard</HI> also terms his <HI>Castilian Roman,</HI> whence it may be infer'd that the first rice and derivation of the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> wer from the <HI>Romane</HI> tongue, not from the <HI>Latine,</HI> which makes me think that the language of <HI>Rome</HI> might be degenerated and becom a di∣alect to our own mother tongue (the <HI>Latine</HI>) before she brought her language to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Ther is besides these subdialects of the <HI>Italian, Spanish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> another speech that hath a great stroke in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> call'd <HI>Franco,</HI> which may be said to be compos'd of all the three, and is at this day the greatest language of comerce and negotiation in the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I given your Lordship the best account I could of the sister dialects, of the <HI>Italian, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>French;</HI> In my next I shall cross the Mediterranean to <HI>Afric</HI> and the <HI>Hellespont</HI> to <HI>Asia,</HI> wher I shall observe the generall'st languages of those vast con∣tinents where such numberless swarmes and differing sorts of Na∣tions

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving in my former letters made a flying progress through the Europaean world, and taken a view of the severall lan∣guages, dialects, and subdialects wherby people convers one with another, and being now windbound for <HI>Afric,</HI> I held it not altoge∣ther supervacaneous to take a review of them, and inform your Lordship what languages are Originall independent mother tongues of Christendom, and what are dialects, derivations, or de∣generations from their originalls.</P>
<P>The mother toungs of <HI>Europe</HI> are thirteen, though <HI>Scaliger</HI> would have but eleven; Ther is the <HI>Greek</HI> 1, the <HI>Latine</HI> 2, the <HI>Dutch</HI> 3, the <HI>Slavonian</HI> 4, the <HI>VVelsh</HI> or <HI>Cambrian</HI> 5, the <HI>Bascuence</HI> or <HI>Cantabrian</HI> 6, the <HI>Irish</HI> 7, the <HI>Albanian</HI> in the Mountaines of <HI>Epire</HI> 8, the <HI>Tartarian</HI> 9, the old <HI>Illirian</HI> 10, remaining yet in <HI>Li∣burnia,</HI> the <HI>Iazrgian</HI> 11, on the North of <HI>Hungary,</HI> the <HI>Cauchian</HI> 12, in East <HI>Frizeland,</HI> the <HI>Finnic</HI> 13, which I put last with good rea∣son, because they are the only heathens of <HI>Europe;</HI> all which were known to be in <HI>Europe</HI> in the time of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; Ther is a learned antiquary that makes the <HI>Arabic</HI> to be one of the mother toungs of <HI>Europe,</HI> because it was spoken in som of the mountains of South <HI>Spain,</HI> 'tis true 'twas spoken for divers hundred yeers all <HI>Spain</HI> over after the conquest of the Moors, but yet it could not be call'd a mother toung, but an adventitious toung in refe∣rence to that part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>And now that I am to pass to <HI>Afric</HI> which is far bigger than <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and to <HI>Asia</HI> which is far bigger than <HI>Afric,</HI> and to <HI>America</HI> which is thought to be as big as all the three, if <HI>Europe</HI> her self hath so many mother languages quite discrepant one from the o∣ther,
<PB N="92" REF="229"/>
besides secondary tongues and dialects which exceed the number of their mothers, what shall we think of the other three huge continents in point of differing languages? Your Lordship knowes that ther be divers meridians and clymes in the heavens whence influxes of differing qualities fall upon the inhabitants of the earth, and as they make men to differ in the idea's and concep∣tions of the mind, so in the motion of the tongue, in the tune and tones of the voice, they com to differ one from the other: Now, all languages at first were imperfect confus'd sounds, then came they to be syllables, then words, then speeches and senten∣ces, which by practice, by tradition, and a kind of naturall in∣stinct from Parents to children, grew to be fix'd. Now to attempt a survay of all the languages in the other three parts of the habita∣ble earth wer rather a madness than a presumption, it being a thing of impossibility, and not only above the capacity, but beyond the search of the activ'st, and knowingst man upon earth: Let it therfore suffice while I behold those Nations that read and write from right to left, from the Liver to the heart, I mean the <HI>Afri∣canes,</HI> and <HI>Asians,</HI> that I take a short view of the <HI>Arabic</HI> in the one, and the <HI>Hebrew</HI> or <HI>Syriac</HI> in the other, for touching the <HI>Turkish</HI> language, 'tis but a dialect of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> though it have recei∣ved a late mixture of the <HI>Armenian,</HI> the <HI>Persian,</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> tongues, but specially of the <HI>Arabic,</HI> which was the mother tongue of their Prophet, and is now the sole language of their <HI>Alchoran,</HI> it be∣ing strictly inhibited, and held to be a prophaness to translate it to any other, which they say preserves them from the encroachment of Schismes.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Arabic</HI> is a tongue of vast expansion, for besides the three <HI>Arabia's</HI> it is becom the vulgar speech of <HI>Syria, Mesoptoamia, Palestine</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> from whence she stretcheth her self to the streight of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> through all that vast tract of earth, which lieth 'twixt the Mountain <HI>Atlas</HI> and the Mediterranean Sea, which is now call'd <HI>Barbary,</HI> where Christianity and the <HI>Latine</HI> tongue with divers famous Bishops once flourished. She is spoken like∣wise in all the Northern parts of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire, as also in petty <HI>Tartary,</HI> and she above all other hath a reason to learn <HI>Ara∣bic,</HI> for she is in hope one day to have the <HI>Crescent</HI> and the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, it being entail'd upon her in case the present race should fail, which is now in more danger than ever, in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> whersoever the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion is profes'd, the <HI>Arabic</HI> is either spoken or taught.</P>
<P>My <HI>last</HI> view shall be of the <HI>first</HI> language of the earth, the an∣cient
<PB N="93" REF="229"/>
language of <HI>Paradice,</HI> the language wherin God Almighty himself pleas'd to pronounce and publish the Tables of the Law, the language that had a benediction promis'd her because she would not consent to the building of the Babylonish Tower; yet this holy tongue hath had also her Eclypses, and is now degene∣rated to many dialects, nor is she spoken purely by any Nation up∣on the earth, a fate also which is befallen the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine;</HI> The most spacious dialect of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is the <HI>Syriac</HI> which had her begining in the time of the captivity of the Jews at <HI>Babylon,</HI> while they cohabited, and wer mingled with the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> in which tract of seventy yeeres time the vulgar sort of Jewes neglecting their own matern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ll tongue (the <HI>Hebrew</HI>) began to speak the <HI>Chaldee,</HI> but not having the right accent of it, and fashioning that new learn'd language to their own innotation of points, affixes and conjugations, out of that intermixture of <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Chaldee,</HI> resulted a third language call'd to this day the <HI>Syri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>c,</HI> which also after the time of our Saviour began to be more adulterated by ad∣mission of <HI>Greek, Roman,</HI> and <HI>Arabic:</HI> in this language is the <HI>Talmud</HI> and <HI>Targum</HI> couch'd, and all their Rabbins, as Rabby <HI>Ionathan,</HI> and Rabby <HI>Oakelos</HI> with others have written in it: Inso∣much that as I said before, the ancient <HI>Hebrew</HI> had the same for∣tune that the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> tongues had, to fall from being naturally spoken any where, to lose their generall communica∣bleness and vulgarity, &amp; to becom only School &amp; book languages.</P>
<P>Thus we see, that as all other sublunary things are subject to corruption and decay, as the poten'st Monarchies, the proudest Republiques, the opulentest Cities have their growth, declinings, and periods; As all other elementary bodies likewise by reason of the frailty of their principles, com by in sensible degrees to alter and perish, and cannot continue long at a stand of perfection; so the learnedst and more eloquent languages, are not free from this common fatality, but they are liable to those alterations and re∣solutions, to those fits of inconstancy, and other destructive con∣tingencies which are unavoidably incident to all earthly things.</P>
<P>Thus my noble Lord have I evertuated my self, and strech'd all my sinnews, I have put all my small knowledge, observations and reading upon the tenter to satisfy your Lordships desires touching this subject; If it afford you any contentment I have hit the white I aimed at, and hold myself abundantly rewarded for my oyl and labour: so I am,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOurs of the 7th current was brought me, wherby I find that you did put your self to the penance of perusing som <HI>Epistles,</HI> that go imprinted lately in my name; I am bound to you for your <HI>pains</HI> and patience (for you write, you read them all tho∣rough) much more for your candid <HI>opinion</HI> of them, being right glad that they should give entertainment to such a choice and ju∣dicious Geetleman as your self: But wheras you seem to except against somthing in one <HI>Letter,</HI> that reflects upon Sir <HI>VValter Ra∣leigh's</HI> voyage to <HI>Guyana,</HI> because I tearm the gold Mine he went to discover, an <HI>ayrie and supposititious Mine,</HI> &amp; so infer that it toucheth his honour; Truly sir, I will deal clearly with you in that point, that I never harbour'd in my brain the least thought to expose to the world any thing that might prejudice, much less traduce in the least degree that could be, that rare and renowned Knight, whose fame shall contend in longaevity with this Island it self, yea with that great <HI>VVorld</HI> which he <HI>Historiseth</HI> so gallantly; I was a youth about the Town when he undertook that expedition, and I remember most men suspected that <HI>Mine</HI> then to be but an imagi∣nary politic thing, but at his return, and missing of the enter∣prise, these <HI>suspitions</HI> turn'd in most to reall <HI>beliefs</HI> that 'twas no o∣ther. And king <HI>Iames</HI> it that Declaration which he commanded to be printed and published afterwards touching the circumstan∣ces of this action (upon which my Letter is grounded, and which I have still by me) tearms it no less; And if we may not give faith to such publick regall instruments, what shall we credit? besides, ther goes another p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>inted kind of Remonstrance annex'd to that Decla∣ration which intimates as much; And ther is a worthy Captain in this Town, who was a coadventurer in that expedition, who, upon the storming of St. <HI>Thoma,</HI> heard young Mr. <HI>Rawleigh</HI> en∣couraging his men in these whods, com <HI>on my noble hearts, this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the Mine we com for, and they who think ther is any other, are fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>lt.</HI> Add heerunto that Sir <HI>Richard Baker</HI> in his last Historicall collecti∣ons intimates so much, therfore 'twas far from being any opini∣on broach'd by my self, or bottom'd upon weak grounds, for I was carefull of nothing more, than that those <HI>Letters,</HI> being to
<PB N="95" REF="230"/>
breath open air, should relate nothing but what should be derived from good fountains; And truly sir, touching that Apologie of Sir <HI>Walter Rawleighs</HI> you write of, I never saw it, and I am very sorry I did not, for it had let in more light upon me of the cariage of that great action, and then you might have bin well assur'd that I would have don that noble Knight all the right that could be.</P>
<P>But sir, the severall arguments that you urge in your Letters are of that strength, I confess, that they are able to rectifie any indifferent man in this point, and induce him to believe that it was no Chymera, but a reall Mine; for you write of divers pieces of gold brought thence by Sir <HI>Walter</HI> himself, and Captain <HI>Ke∣mys,</HI> and of som Ingotts that wer found in the Governours Clo∣set at St. <HI>Thoma,</HI> with divers crusibles, and other refining instru∣ments; yet, under favour, that might be, and the benefit not countervail the charge, for the richest Mines that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath upon the whole Continent of <HI>America,</HI> which are the Mines of <HI>Potos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>,</HI> yeeld him but six in the hundred all expences de∣frayed, You write how King <HI>Iames</HI> sent privately to sir <HI>VValter</HI> being yet in the Tower, to intreat and command him, that he would impart his whole designe unto him under his hand, promi∣sing upon the word of a King to keep it secret, which being don accordingly by Sir <HI>VValter Rawleigh,</HI> that very originall paper was found in the said Spanish Governours closet at St. <HI>Thoma;</HI> wherat, as you have just cause to wonder, and admire the active∣ness of the Spanish Agents about our Court at that time, so I won∣der no less at the miscariage of som of His late Majesties Mini∣sters, who notwithstanding that he had pass'd his royall word to the contrary, yet they did help Count <HI>Gondamar</HI> to that paper, so that the reproach lieth more upon the English than the Spanish Ministers in this particular: Wheras you allege that the dan∣gerous sicknes of Sir <HI>VVatler</HI> being arrived neer the place, and the death of (that rare sparke of courage) your brother upon the first landing, with other circumstances discourag'd Captain <HI>Ke∣mys</HI> from discovering the Mine, but to reserve it for another time, I am content to give as much credit to this as any man can; as also that Sir <HI>VValter,</HI> if the rest of the Fleet according to his ear∣nest motion had gon with him to revictuall in <HI>Virginia</HI> (a Coun∣try wher he had reason to be welcom unto, being of his own dis∣covery) he had a purpose to return to <HI>Guyana</HI> the Spring follo∣wing to pursue his first designe: I am also very willing to believe that it cost Sir <HI>VValter Rawleigh</HI> much more to put himself in equi∣page for that long intended voyage, than would have payed for

his liberty, if he had gon about to purchase it for reward of mo∣ney at home, though I am not ignorant that many of the co-ad∣venturers made large contributions, and the fortunes of som of them suffer for it at this very day. But although <HI>Gondamar,</HI> as my Letter mentions, calls Sir <HI>Walter</HI> Pyrat, I, for my part am far from thinking so, because as you give an unanswerable reason, the plundering of St. <HI>Thoma,</HI> was an act done beyond the Equator, wher the Articles of Peace 'twixt the two Kings do not extend; yet, under favor, though he broke not the <HI>Peace,</HI> he was said to break his <HI>Patent</HI> by exceeding the bounds of his Commission, as the foresaid Declaration relates, for King <HI>Iames</HI> had made strong promises to Count <HI>Gondamar,</HI> that this Fleet should com∣mit no outrages upon the King of <HI>Spain's</HI> Subjects by Land, un∣less they began first, and I beleeve that was the main cause of his death, though I think if they had proceeded that way against him in a legall course of triall, he might have defended himself well enough.</P>
<P>Wheras you alledg that if that action had succeeded, and after∣wards been well prosecuted, it might have brought <HI>Gondamar's</HI> great Catholic Master to have been begg'd for at the Church dores by Fryars, as he was once brought in the latter end of Queen <HI>E∣lizabeths</HI> days; I believe it had much damnified him, and interrup∣ted him in the possession of his West Indies, but not brought him, under favor, to so low an ebb; I have observed that it is an ordina∣ry thing in your Popish Countreys for Princes to borrow from the Altar, when they are reduc'd to any straights, for they say, <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>iches of the Church are to serve as anchors in time of a storm;</HI> divers of our Kings have don worse, by pawning their Plate and Jewels: Wheras my Letter makes mention that Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> mainly laboured for his Pardon before he went, but could not compas it, this is also a passage in the foresaid printed Relation, but I could have wish'd with all my heart he had obtaind it, for I beleeve, that neither the transgression of his Commission, nor any thing that he did beyond the <HI>Line,</HI> could have shortned the line of his life other∣wise, but in all probability wee might have been happy in him to this very day, having such an Heroic heart as he had, and other rare helps, by his great knowledg, for the preservation of health; I beleeve without any scruple what you write, that Sir <HI>William St. geon</HI> made an overture unto him of procuring his pardon for 1500 l. but whether he could have effected it I doubt a little, when he had com to negotiat it really: But I extremely wonder how that old sentence which had lain dormant above sixteen yeers against

<P>I Received those <HI>sparkes of piety</HI> you pleas'd to send me in a manu∣script, and wheras you favour me with a desire of my opinion concerning the publishing of them; Sir I must confess that I found among them many most fervent and flexanimous strains of devotion; I found som prayers so piercing and powerfull that they are able to invade Heaven, and take it by violence, if the heart doth i'ts office as well as the toung: But Sir, you must give me leave (and for this <HI>leave</HI> you shall have <HI>authority</HI> to deal with me in such a case) to tell you, that wheras they consist only of requests being all supplicatory prayers, you should do well to in∣tersperse among them som eucharisticall ejaculations, and doxo∣logies, som oblation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of thankfulnes; we should not be allwayes whining in a puling petitionary way (which is the tone of the time now in fashion) before the gates of Heaven with our fingers in our <HI>eyes,</HI> but we should lay our <HI>hands</HI> upon our <HI>hearts</HI> and break into raptures of joy and praise, a soul thus elevated is the most pleasing sacrifice that can be offer'd to God Almighty, it is the best sort of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ense: <HI>Prayer</HI> causeth the first showr of rain, but <HI>praise</HI> brings down the second, the one fructifieth the earth, the other makes the Hills to skip; all prayers aim at our own ends and in∣terest, but praise proceeds from the pure motions of love and gra∣titude, having no other object but the glory of God, that soul which rightly dischargeth this part of devotion may be said to do the duty of an Angell upon earth. Among other attributes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> God, <HI>praescience</HI> or fore-knowledge is one, for he knowes ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> thoughts, our desires, our wants long before we propound them▪ And this is not only one of his attributes but prerogative royall, therfore to use so many iterations, inculcatings, and tautologie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, as it is no good manners in morall Philosophy, no more is it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <HI>divinity,</HI> it argues a pusillanimou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> and mistrustfull soul: of the two, I had rather be overlong in praise, than prayer: yet I wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> be carefull it should be free from any Pharisaicall babling; <HI>pray∣er</HI> compar'd with praise, is but a fuliginous smoak issuing fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>

the sense of sin, and human infirmities, <HI>prayses</HI> are the true cleer sparks of pietie, and sooner fly upwards.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Noble Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had yours upon Maunday Thursday late, and the reason that I suspended my answer till now, was, that the season engaged me to sequester my thoughts from my wonted negotiations to con∣templat the great work of mans <HI>Redemption,</HI> so great, that wer it cast in counterballance with his <HI>creation,</HI> it would out-poyze it far, I summond all my intellectuals to meditat upon those passions, upon those pangs, upon that despicable and most dolorous death, upon that cross wheron my Saviour suffer'd, which was the first Christian altar that ever was, and I doubt that he will never have benefit of the <HI>sacrifice</HI> who hates the harmeles resemblance of the <HI>altar</HI> wheron it was offer'd; I applied my memory to fasten up∣on't, my understanding to comprehend it, my will to embrace it; from these three faculties, me thought I found by the mediation of the fancy som beames of love gently gliding down from the head to the heart, and inflaming all my affections▪ If the human soul had far more <HI>powers</HI> than the Philosophers afford her, if she had as many faculties within the head as ther be hairs without, the speculation of this mystery would find work enough for them all; Truly the more I scrue up my spirits to reach it, the more I am swallowed in a gulf of admiration, and of a thousand im∣perfect notions, which makes me ever and anon to quarrell my soul that she cannot lay hold on her Saviour, much more my heart, that my purest affections cannot hug him as much as I would.</P>
<P>They have a custom beyond the Seas (and I could wish it wer the worst custom they had) that during the passion week divers of their greatest Princes, and Ladies will betake themselves to som covent or reclus'd house to wean themselves from all world∣ly encombrances, and convers only with heaven, with perfor∣mance of som kind of penances all the week long; A worthy Gentleman that came lately from <HI>Italy,</HI> told me that the Count of <HI>Byren</HI> now Marshall of <HI>France,</HI> having bin long persecuted by Cardinall <HI>Richelieu,</HI> put himself so into a Monastery, and the
<PB N="114" REF="241" MS="y"/>
next day news was brought him of the Cardinalls death, which I believe made him spend the rest of the week with the more de∣votion in that way. <HI>France</HI> braggs that our Saviour had his face turnd towards her when he was upon the Cross, ther is more cause to think that it was towards this Island, in regard the rays of Christianity first reverberated upon her, her King being Christian 400 yeers before him of <HI>France,</HI> (as all Historians concur) not∣withstanding that he arrogates to himself the title of the first Son of the Church.</P>
<P>Let this serve for part of my Apologie: The day following, my Saviour being in the grave, I had no list to look much abroad, but continued my retirednes; ther was another reason also why, because I intended to take the holy Sacrament the Sunday ensuing, which is an act of the greatest consolation, and consequence that possibly a Christian can be capable of; it imports him so much that he is made or marr'd by it, it tends to his damnation, or salvation, to help him up to heaven, or tumble him down head∣long to hell: Therfore it behoves a man to prepare and recol∣lect himself, to winnow his thoughts from the chaff and tares of the world beforehand; This then took up a good part of that day to provide my self a wedding garment, that I might be a fit guest at so precious a banquet, so precious, that manna and angels food are but cours viands in comparison of it.</P>
<P>I hope that this excuse will be of such validity that it may pro∣cure my pardon for not corresponding with you this last week. I am now as freely as formerly▪</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough you know well, that in the carriage and cours of my rambling life, I had occasion to be as the <HI>Dutchman</HI> saith, a <HI>Landloper,</HI> and to see much of the world abroad, yet me thinks, I have travell'd more since I have been immur'd and martyrd 'twixt these walls than ever I did before, for I have travelled the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI> I mean this little world, which I have carryed about me and within me so many yeers, for as the wisest of Pagan Philoso∣phers said, that the greatest learning was the knowledg of ones self, to be his own Geometrician: If one do so, he need not gad abroad to see new fashions, he shal find enough at home, he shal hourly meet with new fancies, new humors, new passions within doors.</P>
<P>This travelling o're of ones self, is one of the paths that leads a man to Paradice; it is true, that 'tis a dirty and a dangerous one, for it is thick set with extravagant desires,' irregular affections and concupiscences, which are but od Comerades, and often times do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ly in ambush to cut our throats; ther are also som melancholy companions in the way, which are our thoughts, but they turn ma∣ny times to be good fellows, and the best company; which makes

me, that among these disconsolat walls, I am never less alone, than when I am alone, I am oft times <HI>sole,</HI> but seldom solitary: som ther are, who are over-pestered with these companions, and have too much <HI>mind</HI> for their bodies, but I am none of those.</P>
<P>Ther have been (since you shook hands with <HI>England</HI>) many strange things happened heer, which posterity must have a strong faith to believe, but for my part I wonder not at any thing, I have seen such monstrous things: you know ther is nothing that can be casuall, ther is no success good or bad, but is contingent to man, somtimes or other, nor are ther any contingencies present or fu∣ture, but they have their parallels from times passed: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ot the great Wheel of <HI>Fortune,</HI> upon whose Rim (as the twelve signs upon the <HI>Zodiac</HI>) all Worldly chances are emboss'd, turns round perpetually, and the Spokes of that Wheel, which point at all human Actions, return exactly to the same place after such a time of revolution; which makes me little marvail at any of the strange traverses of these distracted times, in regard ther hath been the like, or such like formerly; if the <HI>Liturgy</HI> is now sup∣press'd, the <HI>Missall</HI> and Roman <HI>Breviary</HI> was us'd so a hundred yeers since; If <HI>Crosses, Church-Windows, Organs</HI> and <HI>Fonts</HI> are now battered down, I little wonder at it, for <HI>Chapells, Mo∣nasteries, Hermitages, Nunneries,</HI> and other Religious Houses, wer us'd so in the time of old King <HI>Harry;</HI> If <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Deans</HI> are now in danger to be demolished, I little wonder at it, for <HI>Abbots, Priors, and the Pope himself</HI> had that fortune heer an age since: That our King is reduc'd to this pass, I doe not much wonder at it, for the first time I travell'd <HI>France, Iewis</HI> the thirteenth (afterwards a most triumphant King as ever that Countrey had) in a dangerous civill War was brought to such streights, for he was brought to dispence with part of his Co∣ronation Oath, to remove from his <HI>Court of Iustice,</HI> from the <HI>Counsell Table,</HI> from his very <HI>Bed-chamber</HI> his greatest Favourtis; Hee was driven to bee content to pay the expence of the War, to reward those that took Arms against him, and publish a De∣claration that the ground of their quarrell was good, which was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ame in effect with ours, viz. <HI>A discontinuance of the Assemb∣ly of the three Estates, and that Spanish Counsells did praedominat in France.</HI></P>

Now to descend from the substance and the smoak to the ashes, 'tis well known that the medicinall virtues therof are very many, but they are so common

that I will spare the inserting of them heer: But if one would try a pretty conclusion how much smoak ther is in a pound of Tobac∣co, the ashes will tell him▪ for let a pound be exactly weighed and the ashes kept charily and weigh'd afterwards, what wants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a pound weight in the ashes cannot be denied to have bin smoak which evaporated into air; I have bin told that Sir <HI>Walter Rawleih</HI> won a wager of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> upon this nicity.</P>

<P>THe subject of this letter may peradventure seem a <HI>Paradox</HI> to som, but not, I know, to your Lordship when you have pleas'd to weigh well the reasons. <HI>Learning</HI> is a thing that hath bin much tried up, and coveted in all ages, specially in this last century of yeers, by peeple of all sorts though never so mean, and mechani∣call; every man strains his fortunes to keep his children at School, the Cobler will clout it till midnight, the Porter will carry bur∣thens till his bones crack again, the Ploughman will pinch both back and belly to give his son <HI>learning;</HI> and I find that this ambi∣tion reigns no wher so much as in this Island. But under favour, this word <HI>learning</HI> is taken in a narrower sense among us, than a∣mong other nations, we seem to restrain it only to the <HI>Book,</HI> wher∣as, indeed, any artisan whatsoever if he know the secret and myste∣ry of his trade may be call'd a learned man; A good <HI>Mason,</HI> a good <HI>Shoomaker</HI> that can manage Saint <HI>Crispins</HI> lance handsomly, a skillfull <HI>Yeoman,</HI> a good <HI>Shipwright,</HI> &amp;c. may be all call'd learned men, and indeed the usefullest sort of learned men, for without the two first, we might go barefoot, and ly abroad as beasts having no other canopy than the wild air, and without the two last we might starve for bread, have no commerce with other nations, or ever be able to tread upon a <HI>Continent:</HI> these with such like dextrous A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tisans may be tearmed learned men, and the more behoovefull for the subsistence of a Countrey, than those <HI>Polymathists,</HI> that stand poring all day in a corner upon a moth-eaten Author, and con∣verse only with dead men; The <HI>Chineses</HI> (who are the next neigh∣bours to the rising sun on this part of the hemisphere, and conse∣quently the acutest) have a wholsom peece of policy, <HI>that the son is alwaies of the fathers trade,</HI> and 'tis all the learning he aimes at,
<PB N="14" REF="257"/>
which makes them admirable artisans, for besides the dextrou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣nes and propensity of the child, being descended lineally from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many of the same trade, the father is more carefull to instruct him and to discover unto him all the mystery therof; this general<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> custom or law, keeps their heads from running at random after book learning and other vocations: I have read a tale of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Grosthead</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> that being com to his greatnes he had a brother who was a husbandman, and expected great matters from him in poinc of preferment, but the Bishop told him, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> he wanted money to mend his plow or his Cart, or to buy tacklings for his horses, with other things belonging to his husbandry, he should not want what was fitting, but he <HI>wish'd him to aim no high∣er, for a husbandman he found him, and a husbandman he would leav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> him.</HI></P>
<P>The extravagant humour of our Countrey is not to be altoge∣ther commended, that all men should aspire to bocke learning: Ther is not a simpler animall, and a more superfluous member of a state, than a meer Scholer, than a only self pleasing student, he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>—<HI>Tellur is inutile pondus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Goths</HI> forbore to destroy the libraries of the Greeks and Ita∣lians, because <HI>books</HI> should keep them still soft, simple, or too cautious in warlike affairs. <HI>Archymedes</HI> though an excellent En∣gineer when <HI>Syracusa</HI> was lost, was found at his book in his study intoxicated with speculations; who would not have thought ano∣ther great learned Philosopher to be a fool or frantic, when being in a bath he leapd out naked among the peeple and cryed <HI>I have found it, I have found it,</HI> having hit then upon an extraordinary conclusion in Geometry? Ther is a famous tale of <HI>Thomas Aqui∣nas,</HI> the <HI>Angelicall</HI> Doctor, and of <HI>Bonadventure</HI> the <HI>Seraphicall</HI> Doctor, of whom <HI>Alex. Hales</HI> (our Countreyman and his <HI>Master</HI>) reports whether it appeard not in him that <HI>Adam</HI> had sinn'd: Both these great Clerks being invited to dinner by the French King of purpose to observe their humors, and being brought to the room where the table was layed, the first fell a eating of bread as hard as he could drive, at last, breaking out of a brown study he ery∣ed out <HI>conclusum est contra Manichaeos;</HI> The other fell a gazing up∣on the Queen, and the King asking him how he lik'd her, he an∣swered, on Sir, <HI>if an earthly Queen be so beautifull, what shall we think of the Queen of Heaven;</HI> The later was the better Courtier of the two. Hence we may infer, that your meer bookmen, your deep Clerks, whom we call the only learned men, are not alwaies the civillest or the best morall men, nor is too great a number of
<PB N="15" REF="257"/>
them convenient for any state, leading a soft sedentary life, spe∣cially those who feed their own fancies only upon the publike <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ocke. Therfore it wer to be wishd that ther raignd not among the peeple of this land such a generall itching after book-learning, and I beleeve so many <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rce Schools</HI> do rather hurt than good: Nor did the Art of Printing much avail the Christian Common wealth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t may be said to be well near as fatall as <HI>gunpowder,</HI> which came up in the same age; For, under correction, to this may be part∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y ascribd that spirituall pride, that variety of Dogmatists which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> among us; Add heerunto that the excessive number of those which convers only with Books, and whose profession consists in them, is such, that one cannot live for another, accor∣ding to the dignity of the calling; A Physitian cannot live for the Physitians, a Lawyer (civill and common) cannot live for Lawyers, nor a Divine for Divines; Morcover, the multitudes that profess these three best vocations, specially the last, make them of far less esteem. Ther is an odd opinion among us that he who is a contemplative man, a man who wedds himself to his study and swallowes many books, must needs be a prosound Scholler, and a great learned man, though in reality he be such a dolt that he hath neither a retentive faculty to keep what he hath read, nor wit to make any usefull application of it in common discours, what he drawes in, lieth upon dead lees, and never grows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>it to be broachd: Besides, he may want judgement in the choice of his Authors, and knows not how to turn his hand either in weighing or winnowing the soundest opinions: Ther are divers who are cryed up for great Clerks who want discretion. Others, though they wade deep into the causes and knowledg of things, yet they are subject to scrue up their wits, and soar so high, that they lose themselves in their own speculations, for, thinking to transcend the ordinary pitch of reason, they com to involve the common principles of Philosophy in a mist, instead of illustrating things they render them more obscure, instead of a plainer and shorter way to the palace of knowledg, they lead us through bryery odd uncouth paths, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>o fall into the fallacy call'd <HI>notum per ignotius.</HI> Som have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ap to be tearmed learned men, though they have gatherd up but the scraps of knowledg heer and there, though they be but smat∣terers, and meer sciolists scarce knowing the Hoties of things, yet like empty casks, if they can make a sound, and have a gift to vent with confidence what they have suckd in, they are accounted great Schollers. Amongst all book-learned men, except the <HI>Divine</HI> to whom all learned men should be laquays, The Philosopher who
<PB N="16" REF="258" MS="y"/>
hath waded through all the Mathematiques, who hath div'd into the secrets of the elementary world, and converseth also with ce∣lestiall bodies, may be term'd a learned man: The criticall <HI>Hi∣storian</HI> and <HI>Antiquary</HI> may be call'd also a learned man, who hath convers'd with our fore fathers, and observ'd the carriage, and contingencies of matters pass'd, whence he drawes instances and cautions for the benefit of the <HI>Times</HI> he lives in: The <HI>Civilia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> may be call'd likewise a learned man if the revolving of huge vo∣lums may entitle one so, but touching the Authors of the <HI>Com∣mon Law,</HI> which is peculiar only to this Meridian, they <HI>may be all carried in a wheelbarrow,</HI> as my Countreyman Doctor <HI>Gwin</HI> told Judge <HI>Finch:</HI> The Physitian must needs be a learned man, for he knows himself inward and outward, being well vers'd in <HI>Au∣tology,</HI> in that lesson <HI>Nosce Teipsum,</HI> and as <HI>Adrian</HI> the sixt said, he is very necessary to a populous Countrey, for <HI>were it not for the Physitian, men would live so long, and grow so thick, that one could not live for the other, and he makes the earth cover all his faults.</HI></P>
<P>But what Doctor <HI>Guyn</HI> said of the common law-books, and Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> of the Physitian, was spoken, I conceive, in meriment; for my part, I honour those two worthy professions in a high degree: Lastly, a <HI>polygot</HI> or good <HI>linguist</HI> may be also term'd a usefull lear∣ned man, specially it vers'd in School languages.</P>
<P>My Lord, I know none of this age more capable to sit in the Chair, and censure what is true learning, and what not, then your self, therfore in speaking of this subject to your Lordship, I fear to have committed the same error, as <HI>Phormio</HI> did in discoursing of War before <HI>Hanniball.</HI> No more now, but that I am,</P>

<P>I Have many sorts of Civilities to thank you for, but among the rest, I thank you a thousand times (twice told) for that delightfull fit of Society, and conference of Notes we had lately in this little <HI>Fleet</HI>-Cabin of mine upon divers Problems, and upon som which are exploded (and that by those who seem to sway most in the com∣mon-wealth of Learning,) for <HI>Paradoxes</HI> meerly by an <HI>implicit</HI> faith without diving at all into the reasons of the Assertors: And wheras you promised a further expression of your self by way of a Discoursive Letter what you thought of <HI>Copernicus</HI> opinion tou∣ching the <HI>movement</HI> of the earth which hath so <HI>stirr'd</HI> all our mo∣dern wits; And wherof Sir <HI>I. Browne</HI> pleased to oblige himself to do the like touching the Philosophers stone, the powder of Proje∣ction, and potable gold, provided that I would do the same con∣cerning a <HI>peepled Countrey,</HI> and a species of moving creatures in the concave of the Moon, which I willingly undertook upon those con∣ditions, To acquit my self of this obligation, and to draw on your performances the sooner, I have adventured to send you this fol∣lowing Discourse such as it is touching the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nary</HI> World.</P>
<P>I believe 'tis a Principle which no man will offer to controvert, that as <HI>Antiquity cannot priviledg an Error, so Novelty cannot prejudice Truth:</HI> Now, <HI>Truth</HI> hath her degrees of growing and expanding her self as all other things have, and as Time begets her, so hee doth the obstetritious office of a Midwise to bring her sorth; Many truths are but Embryos or Problemes, nay som of them seem to bee meer Paradoxes at first; The opinion that ther were <HI>Antipodes</HI> was exploded when it was first broach'd, it was held absurd and ridiculous, and the thing it self to be as impossible as it was for men to go upon their heads with their heels upwards, nay 'twas adjudged to be so dangerous a Tenet, that you know well the Bi∣shops name who in the Primitive Church was by sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ned of condemnation sent out of this world without a Head to go and dwell amongst his <HI>Antipodes,</HI> because he first haten'd and held that opinion; But new our late Navigators, and East-India Mariners,
<PB N="18" REF="259"/>
who use to cross the Equator and Tropiques so often, will tell you, that it is as gross a Paradox to hold ther are no <HI>Antipodes,</HI> and that the negative is now as absurd as the affirmative seem'd at first: For man to walk upon the Ocean when the Surges were at the highest, and to make a heavy dull peece of wood to swim, nay fly upon the water was held as impossible a thing at first, as it is now thought impossible for man to fly in the aire, sails were held then as uncouth, as if one should attempt to make himself wings to mount up to heaven <HI>a la volee:</HI> Two hundred and od yeers agoe he would have been taken for som frantic fool that would undertake to batter and blow up a Castle with a few barrell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of a small con∣temptible black powder.</P>
<P>The great Architect of the world hath been observ'd not to throw down all gifts and knowledg to man-kind consusedly at once, but in a regular parsimonious method, to disperse them by certain degrees, periods, and progress of time, leaving man to make in∣dustrious researches and investigations after truth, <HI>He left the world to the disputations of men</HI> as the wisest of men saith, who in acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>i∣tion of naturall truths went from the Hysope to the Cedar; <HI>One day certifieth another,</HI> and one age rectifieth another; The morrow hath more experience than the precedent day, and is oft-times able to be his School-master; The Granchild laughs at some things that were don in his Gransires dayes: Insomuch that hence it may well be inferr'd, that naturall humane knowledg is not yet mounted to its Meridian, and highest point of elevation. I confess it cannot be denyed without gross ingratitude, but we are infinitely obliged to our fore-fathers for the fundamentalls of Sciences, and as the He∣rald hath a Rule <HI>mallem cum patribus, quàm cum fratribus errare, I had rather erre with my Fathers than brothers,</HI> so it holds in other kinds of knowledg. But those times which we term vulgarly the <HI>old world,</HI> was indeed the youth or <HI>Adolescence</HI> of it, and though if respect be had to the particular and personall acts of generation, and to the relation of father and Son, they who fore-liv'd and pre∣ceded us may be called our <HI>Ancestors,</HI> yet if you go to the age of the world in general, and to the tru length and longaeui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y of things, <HI>We</HI> are more properly the older Cosmopolites: In this respect the <HI>Cadet</HI> may be term'd more ancient than his elder brother, because the world was older when he entred into it; Moreover, besides <HI>Truth, Time</HI> hath also another daughter which is <HI>Experience,</HI> who holds in her hands the great Looking-glass of Wisdom and Know∣ledg.</P>
<P>But now to the intended task, touching an <HI>habitable World, and a</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="259"/>
<HI>species of living Creatures in the Orb of the Moon, which may hear som analogie with those of this Elementary world;</HI> Although it be not my purpose to maintain and absolutely assert this Problem, yet I will say this, that whosoever cryeth it down for a new <HI>neotericall opinion,</HI> as divers do, commit a grosser error than the opinion may be in its own nature: For 'tis almost as ancient as Philosophy her self, I am sure, 'tis as old as <HI>Orpheus,</HI> who sings of divers fair Cities and Ca∣stles within the Circle of the Moon; Moreover the profoundest Clerks and most renowned Philosophers in all ages have affir∣med it: Towards the <HI>first</HI> Age of learning among others <HI>Pythagoras</HI> and <HI>Plato</HI> avouch'd it, the first of whom was pronounc'd the wisest of men by the Pagan Oracle, as our <HI>Solomen</HI> is by holy Writ. In the middle age of <HI>Learning Plutarch</HI> speaks of it, and in these mo∣dern times the most speculative and scientificall'st men, both in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> seem to adhere to it; subinnuating that not only the sphear of the Moon is peepled with <HI>Selenites</HI> or Lunary men, but that likewise evry Star in Heaven is a peculiar world of it self, which is Coloniz'd and replenish'd with <HI>Astrean</HI> Inhabitants, as the Earth, Sea and Air are with Elementary, The body of the Sun not excepted, who hath also his <HI>Solar</HI> Creatures, and <HI>they</HI> are accounted the most sublime, the most pure and perfectest of all: The <HI>Elementary</HI> Creatures are held the grossest of all, having more matter than form in them; The <HI>Solar</HI> have more form than matter, the <HI>Selenites</HI> with other Astraean Inhabitants are of a mix'd na∣ture, and the nearer they approach the body of the Sun, the more pure and spirituall they are: Were it so, ther were som grounds for his speculation who thought that humane souls be they never so pious and pure ascend not immediatly after their dissolution from the corrupt Mass of flesh before the glorious presence of God pre∣sently to behold the <HI>Beatificall Vision,</HI> but first into the body of the <HI>Moon,</HI> or som other Star according to their degrees of goodnes, and actuat som Bodies there, of a purer composition; when they are re∣find theie they ascend to som higher Star, and so to som higher than that, till at last by these degrees they be made capable to behold the lustre of that glorious Majesty in whose sight no impurity can stand; This is illustrated by a comparison, that if one after hee hath been kept close in a dark Dungeon a long time, should be taken out, and brought suddenly to look upon the Sun in the Miridian, it would endanger him to be struck stark blind; so, no humane soul suddenly fallying out of a dirty prison as the body is, would be possibly able to appear before the incomprehensible Ma∣jesty of God, or be susceptible of the brightnes of his all-glorious
<PB N="20" REF="260"/>
countenance, unless he be fitted therunto before hand by certain degrees, which might be don by passing from one star to another, who, we are taught differ one from the other in glory and splen∣dor.</P>
<P>Among our Modern Authors that would furbish this old opi∣nion of lunary creatures, and plant colonies in the orb of the Moon with the rest of the celestiall bodies, <HI>Gasper Galileo Galilei</HI> is one, who by artificiall prospectives hath brought us to a neerer commerce with Heaven, by drawing it sixteen times nearer the earth then it was before in ocular appearance by the advantage of the said optic Instrument.</P>
<P>Among other arguments which the Assertors of Astrean Inha∣bitants do produce for proof of this high point, one is, that it is neither repugnant to <HI>Reason</HI> or <HI>Religion</HI> to think, that the All∣mighty Fabricator of the Univers, who doth nothing in vain, nor suffers his handmaid Nature to do so, when he created the Er∣ratic and fixed stars, he did not make those huge immense bo∣dies, wherof most are bigger than the earth and sea though con∣globated, to twinkle onely, and be an ornament to the roose of heaven, but he plac'd in the convex of every one of those vast capacious spheres som living creatures to glorifie his name, among whom ther is in evry one of them one supereminent like <HI>man</HI> upon <HI>Earth</HI> to be Lord paramount of all the rest; To this haply may allude the old opinion that ther is a peculiar <HI>Intelligence</HI> which guides and governs every orb in Heaven.</P>
<P>They that would thus colonize the stars with Inhabitants do place in the body of the Sun, as was said before the purest, the most immateriall and refined'st Intellectuall creatures, whence the Allmighty calls those he will have to be immediately about his person, and to be admitted to the Hierarchy of Angels; This is far dissonant from the opinion of the <HI>Turk,</HI> who holds that the Sun is a great burning globe design'd for the damned.</P>
<P>They who are transported with this high speculation that ther are Mansions and habitable conveniences for creatures to live within the bodies of the Celestiall Orbs, seem to tax <HI>Man</HI> of a high presumption, that he should think all things were created principally for <HI>Him,</HI> that the Sun and Stars are serviceable to him in chief, <HI>viz.</HI> to measure his daies, to distinguish his seasons, to direct him in his navigations, and powr wholsom influences upon him.</P>
<P>No doubt they were created to be partly usefull and comforta∣ble to him, but to imagine that they are solely and chiefly for <HI>him,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="260"/>
is a thought that may be said to be above the pride of Lucifer: They may be beneficiall unto him in the generation and encrease of all Elementary creatures, and yet have peculiar Inhabitants of their own besides to concur with the rest of the world in the service of their Creator. 'Tis a fair prerogative for <HI>man</HI> to be Lord of all <HI>Torestirall, Aquatic,</HI> and airie creatures; that with his harping Iron he oan draw ashore the great Leviathan, that He can make the Camell and huge Dromedary to kneel unto him, and take up his burthen, That he can make the fierce Bull though ten times stronger than himself to endure his yoke, that he can fetch down the Eagle from his nest, with such priviledges, but let <HI>Him</HI> not pre∣sume too far in comparing himself with heavenly bodies, while he is no other thing than a worm crawling upon the surface of this Earth: Now the <HI>Earth</HI> is the basest creature which God hath made therfore 'tis call'd his <HI>footstool,</HI> and though som take it to be the <HI>Centre,</HI> yet it is the very <HI>sediment</HI> of the Elementary world, as they say the Moon is of the celestiall; tis the very sink of all corruption and frailty, which made <HI>Trismegist</HI> say that <HI>Terra, non mundus est nequitiae locus,</HI> The <HI>Earth,</HI> not the <HI>World</HI> is the seat of wickednes; And though, tis true, she be susceptible of light, yet the light terminats only on her superficies, being not able to en∣lighten any thing els, as the stars can do.</P>
<P>Thus have I proportioned my short discours upon this spacious problem to the size of an Epistle, I reserve the fulnes of my opi∣nion in this point, till I receave yours touching <HI>Copernicus.</HI></P>
<P>It hath bin alwaies my practice in the search and evenulation of naturall verities, to keep to my self a Philosophicall freedom, as not to make any ones opinion so magisteriall and binding, but that I might be at liberty to recede from it upon more pregnant and powerfull reasons: For as in theologicall tenet 'tis a rule, <HI>Quicquid non descendit a mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Scripturae ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>em authoritate con∣temnitur, qua approbatur,</HI> Whatsoever descends not from the mount of holy Scripture, may be by the same authority rejected as well as receiv'd: So in the disquisitions and winn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>wing of phy∣sicall truths, <HI>Quicquid non descend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t a monte Ratio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s, &amp;c.</HI> whatsoever descends not from the mount of Reason may be as well rejected as approved of.</P>
<P>So longing after an opportunity to pursue this point by mix∣ture of oral discours, which hath more elbow room than a letter, I rest, with all candor and cordiall affection,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SAint <HI>Paul</HI> cannot reascend to Heaven before he gives you also a salute, my Lord, your father having bin a star of the greatest magnitude in the Firmament of the Church. If you please to observe the manner of his late progress upon earth, which you may do by the guidance of this discours, you shall discover ma∣ny things which are not vulgar, by a curious mixture of Chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>h and State-affaires; you shall feel heerin the pulse of <HI>Italy,</HI> &amp; how it beats at this time since the beginning of these late Wars 'twixt the Pope and the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> with the grounds, procedure, and success of the said War, together with the interest and grie∣vances, the pretences and quarrells that most princes there have with <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>I must confes, my Genius hath often prompted me that I was never cut out for a Translator, ther being a kind of servility therin; For it must needs be somwhat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>dious to one that hath a∣ny free-born thoughts within him, and genuin conceptions of his own (wherof I have som though shallow ones) to enchain himself to a verball servitude, and the sense of another. Moreover <HI>Tran∣slations</HI> are but as turn-coated things at best, specially among lan∣guages that have advantages one of the other, as the <HI>Italian</HI> hath of the <HI>English,</HI> which may be said to differ one from the other as <HI>silk</HI> doth from <HI>cloth,</HI> the common wear of both Countries where they are spoken: And as <HI>cloth</HI> is the more substantiall▪ so the English toung by reason 'tis so knotted with consonants is the stronger, and the more sinewy of the two; But <HI>silk</HI> is more smo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>th and slik, &amp; so is the <HI>Italian</HI> toung compar'd to the <HI>English.</HI> Or I may say <HI>Translations</HI> are like the wrong side of a Turky carpet, which useth to be full of thrums and knots, and nothing so even as the right side: Or one may say (as I spake elsewhere) that Transla∣tions are like Wines tane off the lees, and powr'd into other ves∣sels, that must needs lose somwhat of their first strength and brisknes, which in the powring, or passage rather evaporates into air.</P>
<P>Moreover touching Translations, it is to be observ'd that evry
<PB N="34" REF="267"/>
language hath certain <HI>Idiomes,</HI> proverbs and peculiar expression<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of its own which are not rendible in any other but paraphrastical∣ly, therfore he overacts the office of an Interpreter who doth es∣slave himself too strictly to words or phrases: I have heard of an exces among Limmers call'd too much to the life, which hap∣pens when one aimes at similitudes morethan skill; So in versi∣on of languages one may be so over-punctuall in words, that he may mar the <HI>matter;</HI> The greatest fidelity that can be expected in a Translator is to keep still a foot and entire the tru genuin sense of the Author, with the main design he drives at; And this was the principall thing which was observ'd in this <HI>Version.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore let it not be thought strange that ther are som <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> words made free denizens of <HI>England</HI> in this discours, for by such meanes our language hath grown from time to time to be so copious, and still growes more rich, by adopting or <HI>naturalizing</HI> rather the choicest forren words of other Nations, as a Nosegay is nothing els but a tuft of flowers gatherd from divers beds.</P>
<P>Touching this present version of Italian into English, I may say 'tis a thing I did, when I had nothing to do; 'Twas to find somthing wherby to pass away the slow houres of this sad condition of captivity.</P>
<P>I pray be pleas'd to take this as a <HI>small</HI> argument of the great respects I ow you for the sundry rare and high vertues I have disco∣ver'd in you, as also for the obligations I have to your noble La∣dy whose hands I humbly kiss, wishing you both, as the season in∣vites me a good New yeer (for it begins but now in <HI>Law</HI>) as also a holy Lent, and a healthfull Spring.</P>

<P>Touching Diviners of things to com which is held a species of <HI>VVitchcraft,</HI> we may read they were frequent among the <HI>Romanes,</HI> yea they had Colleges for their Augu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s and Aruspices, who us'd to make their predictions somtimes by fire, somtimes by flying of fowl, somtimes by inspection into the entrails of beasts, or in∣voking the dead, but most frequently by consulting with the Oracles, to whom all Nations had recours except the <HI>Iew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s.</HI> But you will say that since Christianity displayed her banners, the <HI>Cross</HI> hath scar'd away the Devill, and struck the Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>cles dumb, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> reports a notable passage of <HI>Thamus</HI> an Italian Pilot, who a little after the birth of Christ, sailing along the coasts of <HI>Ca∣labria</HI> in a still silent night, all his passengers being asleep, an airie cold voice came to his eares saying <HI>Thamus, Thamus, Thamus, The great God Pan is dead,</HI> who was the chiefest Oracle of that Country; yet though the light of the Gospell chas'd away those great Owls, ther be som Bats and little night birds that fly still a∣broad, I mean petty spirits that by secret pactions, which are made alwaies without witnes, enable men and women to do e∣vill. In such compacts beyond the seas the party must <HI>first renounce</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="269"/>
<HI>Christ, and the extended woman meaning the blessed Virgin, he must contemn the Sacraments, tread on the cross, spit at the host, &amp;c.</HI> Ther is a famous story of such a paction which Fryer <HI>Louis</HI> made som half a hundred yeers ago with the Devill in <HI>Marseilles,</HI> who appear'd to him in shape of a Goat and promis'd him the enjoy∣ment of any woman whom he fancied, with other pleasures for 41. yeers, but the Devill being too cunning for him put the figure of I before, and made it 14 yeers in the contract, (which is to be seen to this day with the Devills claw to it) at which time the Fryer was detected for Witchcraft and burnt, and all those children whom he had christned during that term of 14 yeers were rebaptized, and the Gentlewomen whom he had abus'd, put themselves into a Nunnery by themselves. Heerunto may be ad∣ded the great rich Widdow that was burn'd in <HI>Lions,</HI> because 'twas prov'd the Devill had lain with her; as also the history of Lieu∣tenant <HI>Iaquette</HI> which stands upon record with the former, but if I should insert them heer at large it would make this letter swell too much.</P>
<P>But we need not cross the sea for examples of this kind, we have too too many (God wot) at home: King <HI>Iames</HI> a great while was loth to beleeve ther were Witches, but that which happend to my Lord <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Rutlands</HI> children convinc'd him, who were be∣witch'd by an old woman that was servant at Belvoir Castle, but being displeas'd, she contracted with the Devill who convers'd with her in form of a cat, whom she call'd <HI>Rutterken</HI> to make away those children, out of meer malignity, and thirst of revenge.</P>
<P>But since the beginning of these unnaturall Wars ther may be a clowd of witnesses produc'd for the proof of this black tenet, for within the compas of two yeers neer upon three hundred Witches were arraign'd, and the major part executed in <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Suf∣folk</HI> only: <HI>Scotland</HI> swarmes with them now more than ever, and persons of good quality executed daily.</P>
<P>Thus, sir, have I huddled together a few arguments touching this subject, because in my last communication with you, me thought I found you somwhat unsatisfied, and staggering in your opini∣on touching the affirmative part of this thesis, the discussing wher∣of is far fitter for an elaborat large treatise than a loose letter.</P>

<P>AMongst other reasons which make the <HI>English</HI> Language of so small extent, and put strangers out of conceit to learn it, one is, That we do not pronounce as we write, which proceeds from di∣uers superfluous Letters, that occur in many of our words, which adds to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e difficulty of the Language: Therfore the <HI>Author</HI> hath taken pains to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>trench such redundant, unnecessary Letters in this Work (though the <HI>Printer</HI> hath not bin so carefull as he should have bin) as amongst mul∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>itudes of other words may appear in these few, <HI>done, some, come;</HI> which though wee, to whom the speech is <HI>connaturall,</HI> pronounce as mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>syllables, yet when strangers com to read them, they are apt to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>em dissillabls, as <HI>do-ne, so-me, co-me;</HI> therfore such an <HI>e</HI> is superfluous.</P>
