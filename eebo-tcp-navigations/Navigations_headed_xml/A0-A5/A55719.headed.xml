<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Ʋch cannot be ex∣pected (upon a Subject of this Nature) from a private Person, and one who was seconded with few other helps to accomplish his desires herein, than to consult his own thoughts, and a mall number of Books that lay by him. However, the Reader may be well assured, there is no∣thing offered here to his conside∣ration in relation to the Present, or Antient State of <HI>Ireland</HI> (as
<PB REF="3"/> far as the Subject would possibly admit of the same) but what is back'd with good Authority, and faithfully related by the Author, according to the best information he could obtain. As for other mat∣ters here Essayed by way of con∣jecture, the Author well hopes this mean attempt will shortly administer a fit occasion for a more knowing Person, and abler Pen, to render the World more ample satisfction touching the Publick Affairs, and State of that King∣dome; wherein it may seem strange, how that this our Age affords ma∣ny Treatises entituled <HI>The pre∣sent State of</HI> Enngland, France, Italy, Holland, Venice, Muscovy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet not any thing of that Na∣ture (since his Majesties happy Restauration) hath been hitherto presented to publick view in rela∣tion to the State of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though it be one of the chiefest Members
<PB REF="3"/> of the <HI>British</HI> Empire; as if either there were no such thing in Na∣ture; Or at least, that the Affairs thereof afforded not any thing wor∣thy of Note: whereas indeed the continued infelicity of that un∣happy Kingdome (till of late) might alone (besides many other remarkes made mention of in this ensuing Treatise) justly breed some curiosity in any knowing per∣son to take into his consideration, what were the true causes why that Realm, whereof our Kings of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> have born the Title of Sove∣reign Lords for the space of four hundred and odd years (a period of time wherein divers great Monar∣chies have risen from Barbarism to Civility, and fallen again to Ruine) was not in all that space of time throughly subdued, &amp; reduced to the obedience of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> although there hath been almost a continual War between the <HI>English</HI>
<PB REF="4"/> and the <HI>Irish;</HI> and why the man∣ners of the meer <HI>Irish,</HI> were so little altered (till King <HI>James</HI> his Reign) since the days of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second (as appeareth by the descrip∣tion made by <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> who lived and wrote in that time) although there hath been since that time so many <HI>English</HI> Colonies plan∣ted in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as that if the peo∣ple had been numbred by the Poll, such as were descended of <HI>English</HI> race, would have been found more in number, than the antient Na∣tives. To give therefore a brief ac∣count of the true causes of those dis∣orders, as also of the exquisite re∣medies applyed (by the late Settle∣ment of <HI>Ireland</HI>) in order to a per∣fect Reformation of the same, is one of the chief ends and design of this discourse, wherein if it gives the Reader any competent satisfaction, the Author will deem himself there∣by well rewarded for his pains.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONTENTS OF THE First Part.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THat <HI>Ireland</HI> is supposed to be first Inhabited by the <HI>Britains. page 1.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That it was first Invaded by the <HI>Sax∣on</HI> Monarchs. <HI>p. 3.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Next by the <HI>Northern</HI> Nations (a∣bout the year <HI>830.</HI>) of <HI>Danes, Swedes</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> all passing under the Names of <HI>Norwegians. p. ib.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>And last of all by the <HI>English,</HI> in K. <HI>Henry</HI> the Seconds time. <HI>p. 4.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the Conquest of <HI>Ireland</HI> by the <HI>English,</HI> ever since <HI>Henry</HI> the Seconds time, till now of late, was imperfect, by reason of two great Defects; the first whereof consisted in faint prosecution of the War; and the next, in in the loos∣ness of the Civil Government. <HI>p. 6.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Of the faint prosecution of the War, and the causes of it. <HI>p. ib.</HI></ITEM>
<PB REF="5"/>
<ITEM>That notwithstanding many obstructi∣ons, yet the first <HI>English</HI> Adventurers (during the first forty years) gained many large proportions of Land in the Provinces of <HI>Leinster, Munster, Con∣naght</HI> and <HI>Ulster. p. 8.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>English</HI> being (for a long time) necessitated to maintain a border∣ing War with the <HI>Irish,</HI> wholy at the charge of the <HI>English</HI> Planters, the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Plantations in <HI>Ireland</HI> began there∣upon to decay. <HI>p. 9, 10, 11.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Morrice Fitz-Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Desmond</HI> was the first began that wick∣ed Extortion of Coine, Livery and Pay (in K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Seconds time) which soon after proved the utter ruine of all the <HI>English</HI> Colonies in <HI>Ireland,</HI> except those few within the Pale; which Interest of the <HI>English</HI> could never be put in a way of recovery again, till about the beginning of Queen <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>izabeths</HI> Reign. <HI>p. 12, 13.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That by reason of the said Earl of <HI>Desmond,</HI> and divers other Grandees of the first <HI>English</HI> Conquerors, getting vast Estates from the <HI>English</HI> Colonies in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by those horrible oppressioins of Coin and Livery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> many of the
<PB REF="5"/> <HI>English</HI> fled into <HI>England;</HI> and the rest, in a small tract of time, so much degene∣rated into <HI>Irish</HI> manners, as that they hated the very name of the <HI>English,</HI> and took upon them <HI>Irish</HI> Nick-names. <HI>p. 14, 15.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That those great <HI>English</HI> Lords, the better to maintain their said unlawful Acquisitions, became thereupon Arch E∣nemies both to the Government, and the Laws of <HI>England:</HI> refusing to appear at Parliaments, and no way observing the Dictates and Command of the Chief Governors of that Realm. <HI>p. 16, 17.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That by these means; and by reason of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility and Gentry pas∣sing (afterwards) out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into <HI>England</HI> to be engaged in the Civil-Wars between <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> wherein most of them perished, the <HI>Irish</HI> became victorious over all the <HI>English,</HI> except those within the Pale, without bloud or sweat. <HI>p. 17, 18.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That it was a great hindrance to the full Conquest of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that the first <HI>English</HI> Conquerors, did not equally com∣municate the <HI>English</HI> Laws to the <HI>Irish,</HI> as well as to <HI>English</HI> Planters. <HI>ib.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That by means thereof, the <HI>English</HI>
<PB REF="6"/> Conquerors, maintained perpetual En∣mity, and War, with the <HI>Irish,</HI> for their own private ends and advantages, to the distruction of the Country. <HI>p. 19.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That this was contrary to the practice of the <HI>Roman</HI> State, who never re∣fused to communicate their Laws to the rude and barbarous people they conquer∣ed. <HI>p. 20.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>And to the practice of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, who Governed both <HI>Nor∣mands</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> under one Law. <HI>p. 21.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>And against the prudent course <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the First observed in the reducing of <HI>Wales. p. ib.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the next Error in the Civil pol∣licy, was the over great proportions of Land, with great Royalties and Liber∣ties granted to the first <HI>English</HI> Adven∣turers in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which occasioned ma∣ny notorious inconveniencies <HI>p. 22.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The reason why such vast proporti∣ons of Land were given to the first Ad∣venturers in <HI>Ireland. p. 30.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The manner how <HI>Ireland</HI> was divi∣ded among the <HI>English</HI> Conquerors, in <HI>Henry</HI> the Seconds time, and soon after. <HI>p. 23.</HI></ITEM>
<PB REF="6"/>
<ITEM>That when the <HI>Roman</HI> Generals had with the publick charge Conquered many Kingdoms and Common-wealths, they were rewarded with honorable Offices and Triumphs, and not made Lords and Proprietors of whole Kingdoms and Provinces. <HI>p. 31.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI> in the Conquest of <HI>England</HI> (which he made his own work) distributed sundry Lordships and Monnors unto his follow∣ers, but gave not away whole Shires and Counties, as was done in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in <HI>Demesne</HI> to any of his Servitors whom he desired to advance. <HI>p. ib.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The like did <HI>Edward</HI> the First in the Conquest of <HI>Wales, p. 32.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That as the best policy was not obser∣ved in the distribution of the Conquered Lands in <HI>Ireland</HI> by the first <HI>English</HI> Adventurers; so were they deceived in the choice of the fitttest places to settle their Plantations in. <HI>p. 34.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the Nature of the <HI>Irish</HI> Customs are such, that of necessity they make those people Rebels, who make use of the same, to all good Government, and to the de∣struction of the Common-wealth wherein they live. <HI>p. 37.</HI></ITEM>
<PB REF="7"/>
<ITEM>That the frequent Rebellions in <HI>Ire∣land</HI> in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign, espe¦cially that notorious one of the Earl of <HI>Tyrone</HI> and his Adherents, chiefly fo∣mented by the Pope and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> did so far provoke the Queen, as that she made an absolute Conquest of the <HI>Irishry p. 44</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That upon the finishing of the said Conquest, to the end the long for wished perpetual Peace and Settlememt of that Kingdom might be established on firm foundations, 'twas propounded, as the fittest expedient, that all the forfeited Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> might be disposed of to such <HI>English</HI> as should be brought out of <HI>England</HI> to plant the same, paying thereout yearly, by way of Quit-Rent, a reasonable consideration, to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> towards the maintenance of a Standing Army in <HI>Ireland. p. 46.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The same method being observed by the <HI>Romans</HI> to continue their Conquered Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tries in due Obedience to them; And which should also have been also put in practice by the first <HI>English</HI> Con∣querors of the Realm of <HI>Ireland p. 48.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That all such <HI>Irish</HI> who had forfeited the said Lands, were to be transplanted
<PB REF="7"/> from one Province into another, and to become only Tenants to the <HI>English. p. 50.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That King <HI>James</HI> (being swayed by wilder Councels) wholy waving the Transplantation, &amp; of laying hold on the said forfeited Lands; did (by an Act of Olivion) remit all manner of offences committed against the Crown by the said Earl of <HI>Tyrone</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Irish;</HI> which mild resolution of his, was like to be (soon after) ill requited by the said Earl and his Adherents: who practicing a new Rebellion in the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and failing therein, fled (upon the guilty conscience thereof) to the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> giving thereby an excel∣lent opportunity to settle a brave <HI>British</HI> Plantation within the fix forfeited Coun∣ties in the Province of <HI>Ulster p. 50, 51.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>How far King <HI>James</HI> proceeded in the Reformation and Settlement of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> by dividing the same into Counties, and thereby consequently making way for the Laws of <HI>England</HI> to be put in execu∣tion in all parts of the Kingdome; and by ascertaining also all mens Estates according to <HI>English</HI> tenure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with many other publick Acts, tending to the
<PB REF="8"/> future good Government and welfare of that Realm. <HI>p. ib.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That notwithstanding all those excel∣lent Constitutions, yet the foundation of that settlement of <HI>Ireland</HI> (not long af∣ter) received a shake, by the <HI>Irish</HI> denying to contribute towards the maintenance of a standing Army in <HI>Ireland An. 1627.</HI> (except they might first obtain a Tolle∣ration of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion) though the Lord Primate <HI>Usher</HI> in a set Speech (in the presence of the Lord Deputy <HI>Falkland</HI>) made use of many strong Ar∣guments and reasons to press them there∣unto. <HI>p. 53.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the loss of this rare opportunity by the <HI>Irish,</HI> to express the height of their Loyalty to his Majesty of <HI>England,</HI> can never be sufficiently repented of by them. <HI>p. 54.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the Lord Primate <HI>Usher</HI> wise∣ly foresaw a storm impending, which was (not long after) unhappily verified by the bloody Rebellion in <HI>Ireland, Anno 1641.</HI> without the least provocation gi∣ven by the <HI>English</HI> to the <HI>Irish</HI> to per∣petrate so wicked an Act, wherein were barbarously destroyed (in a very short space of time) by the Sword and Famin
<PB REF="8"/> above a hundred and fifty thousand Pro∣testants. <HI>p. 54</HI> to <HI>64.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>English</HI> could not obtain an opportunity to be throughly revenged on the <HI>Irish,</HI> for their inhumane slaughter∣ing of their Country-men, till the year <HI>1649.</HI> from what time (within the com∣pass of about three years) it is conceived there was not left undestroyed (by the Sword, Plague and Famin) above the eighth part of all the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation; Be∣ing a just judgment of God fallen upon them for their impious carriage towards the poor Protestant <HI>British</HI> Planters <HI>p. 66.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation being thus broken, all the <HI>Romish-Irish</HI> Proprie∣tors were commanded upon pain of death by a certain day to transplant themselves from the Provinces of <HI>Lynster, Munster</HI> and <HI>Ulster,</HI> into the Province of <HI>Con∣naght</HI> and County of <HI>Clare;</HI> which was performed accordingly. <HI>p. 67.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>A brief description of the admirable Strength of the Province of <HI>Connaght,</HI> as well by Art as Natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; As also of the lamentable waste condition all <HI>Ire∣land</HI> was reduced unto, in the close of the War <HI>An. 1652, 1653. p, 67</HI> to <HI>70.</HI></ITEM>
<PB REF="9"/>
<ITEM>That immediately after the said Transplantation of the <HI>Irish,</HI> (being in the year <HI>1653.</HI>) certain Regiments of the <HI>English</HI> Army were disbanded, and setled upon the Lands fallen by Lot to them for their Arrears within the Pro∣vinces of <HI>Lynster, Munster</HI> and <HI>Ulster. p. 68. &amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> (with∣in three years after) were setled upon their respective proportions of Land as∣signed to them, or fallen by Lot, in all parts of <HI>Ireland. p. 68, 69.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That within three years ensuing the said Settlement, there appeared a strange alteration in the general state of <HI>Ireland,</HI> from a most ruinous, to a reviving Com∣mon-wealth. <HI>p. 70, 71.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That as his Majesties Restauration crowned the joy of oll the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> so it did as much deject the <HI>Irish,</HI> who immediately expected thereupon to be generally restored to their former E∣states. <HI>p. 72.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>What alteration hapened to the Set∣tlement of <HI>Ireland,</HI> since his Majesties Restauration. <HI>p. 73,</HI> &amp; <HI>216,</HI> &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>How that that perpetual Peace and Settlement of <HI>Ireland</HI> which was so
<PB REF="9"/> solidly discoursed of, and stoutly fought for in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign; and very far proceeded in King <HI>James</HI> his time; Is now fully perfected, and con∣firmed by our Gracious Sovereign King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, to the glory of God, and the great honor and profit of his Majesty, and security of his three King∣doms. <HI>p. 74</HI> to <HI>79.</HI></ITEM>

<PB N="10" REF="20"/> Governours of the Realm, and the <HI>English</HI> Lords who had gotten such great Possessions and Royalties (as that they presumed to make War and Peace at their pleasure, with∣out the least advice or direction from the State) being forced to le∣vy all their Forces within the Land, who being ill Paid and worse Go∣verned, it so came to pass, (the publick Revenues of <HI>Ireland</HI> being then inconsiderable to sustain such a charge) that as well the Ordina∣ry Forces which stood continually, as the extraordinary, which were levied by the chief Governour, up∣on Journeys and general Hostings, were for the most part laid upon the poor Subjects descended of <HI>English</HI> race; which burden was in some measure tollerable during the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the First; but after∣wards became insupportable in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Second; For <HI>Morrice Fitz-Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Desmond</HI> being chief Commander of the Army against the <HI>Scots,</HI> be∣gan that wicked extortion of Coyn

<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
<P>These possessions being thus un∣lawfully gained, could not be main∣tained by the just and honorable Laws of <HI>England,</HI> which would have restored the true owners to their Land again; And therefore this Great Man found no better means to continue and uphold his ill purchased greatness, then by re∣jecting the <HI>English</HI> Laws and Go∣vernment, and assuming in lieu thereof the barbarous Customs of the <HI>Irish,</HI> whereupon followed the defection of those four Counties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which pro∣ved the ut∣ter ruine of the first, <HI>English</HI> Colonies in <HI>Ireland,</HI> (except those within the Pale.)</NOTE> containing the greatest parts of <HI>Munster,</HI> viz. <HI>Kerry, Limrick, Cork,</HI> and <HI>Waterford,</HI> from the obedience of the Law; and so successively by the same means, and much about the same time, the rest of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Lords, and Free-holders in <HI>Ire∣land</HI> (except those of the <HI>English</HI> Pale) fell away from the <HI>English</HI> Law and Government in the end of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Second's Reign, and in the beginning of King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the third.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="23"/> (who had been long Lord Lieute∣nant of <HI>Ireland</HI>) at the Battle of <HI>Wakefield</HI> in <HI>York-shire,</HI> after whose death, while the Wars between the two Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca∣ster</HI> were in their heat, almost all the good <HI>English</HI> blood which was left in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was spent in these ci∣vil dissentions; so as the <HI>Irish</HI> be∣came Victorious over all, without blood or sweat, except onely that little Canton of Land (as aforesaid) called the <HI>English</HI> Pale, containing the Counties of <HI>Dublin, Louth, Kil∣dare,</HI> and <HI>Meth,</HI> (which last hath since the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight been subdivided into three Counties; that is to say, <HI>East-Meath, West-Meath,</HI> and <HI>Longford</HI>) which onely maintained a border∣ing War, and retained the form of an <HI>English</HI> Government; so that by the fourteenth of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, the State of <HI>Ireland</HI> was grown to so low an ebbe upon an <HI>English</HI> account, that at their erect∣ing a Fraternity of men of Armes, called the Brotherhood of S. <HI>George,</HI> for the defence of the said Pale,
<PB N="17" REF="23"/> they exceeded not in number above 200. being all the standing Forces that were then in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and as they were Natives of the Kingdom, so the Kingdom it self did pay their wages, without expecting any Treasure out of <HI>England;</HI> However (the great Lords of the natural <HI>Irish,</HI> and degenerate <HI>English</HI> being divided into many factions, and ne∣ver conjoyned in any one principle of common interest, and thereby consequently becoming very incon∣siderable) this small spot of ground was valiantly maintained for a long time by the weak (but united Forces) of the Kings of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<PB N="18" REF="24"/> doth first consist in this; That the Crown of <HI>England</HI> did not from the beginning give Laws to the <HI>Irishry,</HI> though the <HI>Irish</HI> did often desire to be admitted to the benefit of it, and protection of the <HI>English</HI> Laws, but could not obtain it. For although King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second before his return out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> held a Coun∣fel or Parliament at <HI>Lismore,</HI> where the Laws of <HI>England</HI> were willing∣ly accepted off by all the <HI>Irishry,</HI> and that confirm'd by their Oaths; And though King <HI>John</HI> in the twelfth year of his Reign, did establish the <HI>English</HI> Laws and Customes here, and the Courts of Judicature at <HI>Dublin,</HI> and placed Sheriffs and o∣ther Ministers to rule and govern the people according to the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> yet it is evident by all the Records of this Kingdome, that onely the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, and some few Septs of the <HI>Irishry</HI> (as <HI>O Neal</HI> of <HI>Ʋlster, O Malaghlin</HI> of <HI>Meath, O Connagher</HI> of <HI>Connaght, O Brien</HI> of <HI>Thomond,</HI> and <HI>Mac Muorrogh</HI> of <HI>Lynster,</HI> who were en∣franchised by special Charters)
<PB N="19" REF="24"/> were admitted to the benefit and protection of the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> for in them onely the <HI>English</HI> Laws were published, and put in execu∣tion; and in them onely did the I∣tinerant Judges make their Circuits and Visitations of Justice, as name∣ly in the Counties of <HI>Dublin, Kil∣dare, Meth, Ʋriel, Catherlogh, Kil∣kenny, Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Limrick, Kerry,</HI> and <HI>Typperary,</HI> and not in the Countries possessed by the <HI>Irishry,</HI> which contained at least two third parts of the King∣dome, and even in these Counties the said Laws stretcht no farther then the Lands of the <HI>English</HI> Colo∣nies did extend; so that the <HI>Irish</HI> were not only disabled to bring any acti∣ons, but they were so far out of the protection of the Law, as it was of∣ten adjudged no Fellony, to kill a meer <HI>Irish</HI> man in time of Peace; from whence it came to pass, that in all the Parliament Rolls which are ex∣tant, from the 40th year of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, when the Statutes of <HI>Kil∣kenny</HI> were enacted, till the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, we find
<PB N="20" REF="25"/> the degenerate and disobedient <HI>English</HI> called Rebels; but the <HI>Irish</HI> which were not in the Kings Peace, are called Enemies: Whereby it it is manifest, that such as had the Government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> under the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> did intend to maintain a perpetual Separation and Enmity between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Irish,</HI> pretending that the <HI>English</HI> should in the end be able to root out the <HI>Irish,</HI> which the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> not being able to effect, caused a perpetual War between both Na∣tions, which continued four hun∣dred and odd years, and might have continued to the worlds end, if in the end of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign, the <HI>Irishry</HI> had not been bro∣ken and Conquered by the Sword; and since the beginning of King <HI>James</HI> his Reign had not been pro∣tected and governed by the Law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contrary to the pra∣ctice of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and others, &amp;c. who communi∣cated their Laws to the Conquered.</NOTE></P>

This was also against the practise <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror used, who governed both the <HI>Normans</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> under one Law; And against the prudent course that hath been observed in the reducing of <HI>Wales,</HI> partly perform'd by King <HI>Edward</HI> the First, and altogether finished by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, by dividing the whole Countrey in∣to Shires and Circuits, and estab∣lishing a Common-wealth amongst them, according to the <HI>English</HI> Go∣vernment; by means whereof, that entire Countrey was in a short time so securely setled in Peace and Obe∣dience, and hath attained to that

<PB N="25" REF="28"/> for Criminal and Civil Causes, and for their own Revenues; in the same form as the Kings Courts were established at <HI>Dublin;</HI> made their own Judges, Seneschalls, Sheriffs, Coroners, and Escheators; so as the Kings Writ did not run in those Counties (which took up more then two parts of the <HI>English</HI> Colo∣nies) but onely in Church Lands lying within the same, which were called the Cross, wherein the King made a Sheriff: And so in each of these Counties Palatines, there were two Sheriffs; one of the Liberty, and another of the Cross: whereby it is manifest, how much the Kings Jurisdictions was restrained, and the power of these Lords enlarged by these high Priviledges. Again, these great undertakers were not tied to any form of Plantation, but all was left to their discretion and pleasure. And although they build∣ed Castles, and made Freeholders, yet were there no tenures or servi∣ces reserved to the Crown, but the Lords drew all the respect and de∣pendancy of the common people
<PB N="26" REF="29"/> unto themselves. Now let us see what inconveniences did arise by these large and ample Grants of Lands and Liberties, to the first Ad∣venturers in the Conquest.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great inconveni∣ences that ensued the Grant of whole Pro∣vinces and petit King∣doms to the first <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Con∣querors of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE>Without doubt by these Grants of whole Provinces and petty King∣doms, these few <HI>English</HI> Lords pre∣tended to be Proprietors of all the Land, so as their was no possibility left of settling the Natives in their Possessions, and by consequence the Conquest became impossible, with∣out the utter extirpation of all the <HI>Irish;</HI> which these <HI>English</HI> Lords were not able to perform, nor per∣haps willing if they had ability. Notwithstanding, because they did still hope to become Lords of those Lands which were possessed by the <HI>Irish,</HI> whereunto they pretended Title, by their large Grants; And because they did fear, that if the <HI>Irish</HI> were received into the Kings protection, and made Liege-men, and Free Subjects; the State of <HI>England</HI> would establish them in their possessions by Grants from the Crown; reduce their Countries in∣to
<PB N="27" REF="29"/> Counties, ennoble some of them, and enfranchise all; and make them amensurable to the Law, which would have abridged, and cut off a great part of that greatness which they had promised unto themselves: They therefore perswaded the King of <HI>England,</HI> that it was unfit to communicate the Laws of <HI>England</HI> unto them; and that it was the best policy to hold them as Aliens and Enemies, and to prosecute them with a continual War; whereby they obtained another Royal Prero∣gative and Power: Which was, to make War and Peace at their Plea∣sure, in every part of the Kingdom, which gave them an absolute com∣mand over the Bodies, Lands and Goods of the <HI>English</HI> Subjects there. And besides the <HI>Irish</HI> inhabiting the Lands fully Conquered, and redu∣ced, being in the condition of Slaves and Villains, did render a greater Profit and Revenue, than if they had been the Kings Free Subjects, and therefore for these two causes last expressed, they were not willing to root out all the <HI>Irishry.</HI></P>
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
<P>Again, Those large Scopes of Land, and great Liberties, with ab∣solute Power to make War and Peace, did raise the <HI>English</HI> Lords to that height of Pride and Ambiti∣on, as they could not endure one another, but grew to a mortal War and Dissention amongst themselves; insomuch, that whole Towns and Countries have often times been de∣stroyed by their Contentions, which brought forth divers mischiefs that did not onely disable the <HI>English</HI> to finish the Conquest of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> but did endanger the loss of what was already gained; And of Con∣querors, made themselves Slaves to that Nation, which they did intend to Conquer. For, whensoever one <HI>English</HI> Lord had vanquished ano∣ther, the <HI>Irish</HI> waited, and took the opportunity, and fell upon that Country which had received the blow; and so daily recovered some part of the Lands, which were pos∣sessed by the <HI>English</HI> Colonies.</P>
<P>Besides, The <HI>English</HI> Lords to strengthen their Parties, did Ally themselves with the <HI>Irish,</HI> and drew
<PB N="29" REF="30"/> them in to dwell amongst them, and gave their Children to be foster∣ed by them; and having no other means to pay or reward them, suf∣fered them to take Coyn and Live∣ry, upon the <HI>English</HI> Free-holder; which oppression was so intollera∣ble, as that the better sort were en∣forced to quit their Free-holds, and fly into <HI>England;</HI> and never return∣ed, though many Laws were made in both Realms, to remand them back again: and the rest which re∣mained, became degenerate and meer <HI>Irish,</HI> as is before declared. And the <HI>English</HI> Lords finding the <HI>Irish</HI> Exactions to be more profita∣ble then the <HI>English</HI> Rents and Ser∣vices, and loving the <HI>Irish</HI> tyranny which was tyed to no Rules of Law or Honor, better than a just and lawful Seigniory, did reject and cast off the <HI>English</HI> Law and Govern∣ment, received the <HI>Irish</HI> Laws and Customes, took (as aforesaid) <HI>Irish</HI> Sir-names, refused to come to the Parliaments which were summoned by the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Authority, and scorned to obey the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="31"/> Knights which were sent to com∣mand and govern this Kingdome.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Kings of <HI>England</HI> Granted such large Proportions of Land to the first Conquerors of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE>But this ought withal to be taken into consideration, that as these Grants of little Kingdomes, and great Royalties, to a few private persons, did produce the mischiefs spoken of before: So the true cause of making those Grants, did pro∣ceed from this; That the Kings of <HI>England</HI> being otherwise imployed, and diverted, did not make the Conquest of <HI>Ireland</HI> their own work, and undertook it not royally at their own charge; but as it was first begun by particular Adventurers, so they left the prosecution thereof to them, and other Adventurers, who came to seek their Fortunes in <HI>Ireland;</HI> wherein if they could pre∣vail, they thought it in Reason and Honor, they could do no less than make them Proprietors of such Scopes of Land as they could Con∣quer, People and Plant at their own charge, reserving only the So∣vereign Lordship to the Crown of <HI>England:</HI> But if the Lyon had gone to hunt himself, the shares of the
<PB N="31" REF="31"/> inferiour Beasts had not been so great. If the Invasion had been made by an Army, transmitted, fur∣nished, and supplyed onely at the Kings charges, and wholly paid with the Kings Treasure, as the Armies of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> were, as the Conquest had been sooner atchieved, so the Servitors had been contented with lesser proportions.</P>
<P>For when <HI>Scipio, Pompey</HI> and <HI>Cae∣sar,</HI> and other Generals of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Armies, as Subjects and Ser∣vants of that State, and with the Publick Charge, had Conquered many Kingdomes and Common-Weals, we find them rewarded with Honorable Offices and Tri∣umphs at their return; and not made Lords and Proprietors of whole Provinces and Kingdomes, which they had subdued to the Em∣pire of <HI>Rome.</HI> Likewise, when the Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI> had Conquer∣ed <HI>England,</HI> which he made his own work, and perform'd it in his own person, he distributed sundry Lord∣ships and Manners unto his Follow∣ers,
<PB N="32" REF="32"/> but gave not away whole Shires and Countries in Demesne to any of his Servitors, whom he most desired to advance.</P>
<P>Again, From the time of the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest, till the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the First, many of our <HI>English</HI> Lords made War upon the <HI>Welch-men,</HI> at their own charge; the Lands which they gained, they held to their own use, were called Lords Marchers, and had Royal Liberties within their Lordships. Howbeit these particular Adventurers could never make a Conquest of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>But when King <HI>Edward</HI> the First came in person with his Army thi∣ther, kept his Residence and Court there; made the reducing of <HI>Wales</HI> an enterprize of his own; he finish∣ed that work in a Year or two, whereof the Lords Marchers had not perform'd a third part, with their continual Bordering War, for two hundred Years. And withall we may observe, that though this King had now the Dominion of <HI>Wales, in jure proprietatis,</HI> (as the Statute of <HI>Rutland</HI> affirmeth) which
<PB N="33" REF="32"/> before was subject unto him, but in <HI>jure feodali:</HI> And though he had lost divers principal Knights and Noble men in that War, yet did he not reward his Servitors with whole Countries or Counties, but with particular Mannors and Lordships: As to <HI>Henry Lacie,</HI> Earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> he gave the Lordship of <HI>Denbigh;</HI> and to <HI>Reighnold Gray,</HI> the Lordship of <HI>Ruthen,</HI> and so to others.</P>
<P>If the like course had been used in the winning and distribuiting of the Lands of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that Island had been fully conquered before the Continent of <HI>Wales</HI> had been redu∣ced. But the truth is, when pri∣vate men attempt the Conquest of Countries at their own charge, com∣monly their enterprizes do perish without success: as when in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> undertook to recover the <HI>Ardes:</HI> and <HI>Chatterton,</HI> to recon∣quer the <HI>Fues,</HI> and <HI>Orier.</HI> The one lost his Son; and the other himself; and both their Adventures came to nothing. And as for the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> it hath had the like For∣tune
<PB N="34" REF="33"/> in the Conquest of this Land, as some Purchasers have; who de∣sire to buy Land at too easie a Rate: they find those cheap Purchasers so full of trouble, as they spend twice as much as the Land is worth, be∣fore they get the quiet possession thereof.</P>
<P>And as the best policy was not observed in the distribution of the Conquered Lands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the first <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Ad∣venturers in <HI>Ireland,</HI> were decei∣ved in the choice of the fittest places to settle their Plan∣tations in</NOTE> so as I conceive, that the first Adventurers intending to make a full Conquest of the <HI>Irish,</HI> were deceived in the choice of the fittest places for their Plantation. For they sate down, and erected their Castles and Habitations in the Plains, and open Countries; where they found most fruitful and profita∣ble Lands, and turned the <HI>Irish</HI> in∣to the Woods and Mountains: Which as they were proper places for Out-laws and Thieves, so were they their Natural Castles and For∣tifications; thither they drave their preys and stealths; there they lurkt, and lay in wait to do mischief. These <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st places they kept unknown, by making the ways and entries there∣unto
<PB N="35" REF="33"/> impassable; there they kept their Creaghts or Herds of Cattle, living by the Milk of the Cow, with∣out Husbandry or Tillage; there they encreased and multiplyed un∣to infinite numbers by promiscuous generation among themselves; there they made their Assemblies, and Conspiracies without discovery: But they discovered the weakness of the <HI>English</HI> dwelling in the open plains, and thereupon made their Sallies and Retreats with great ad∣vantage; Whereas on the other side, if the <HI>English</HI> had builded their Castles and Towns in those places of fastness, and had driven the <HI>Irish</HI> into the plains and open Countries, where they might have had an eye and observation upon them, the <HI>Irish</HI> had been easily kept in order, and in short time reclaimed from their wildness; There they would have used Tillage, dwelt together in Town ships, learned Mechanical Arts and Sciences. The Woods had been wasted with the <HI>English</HI> Habi∣tations, as they were afterwards a∣bout the Forts of <HI>Mariborough,</HI> and
<PB N="36" REF="34"/> <HI>Philipston,</HI> which were built in the fast places in <HI>Leinster,</HI> and the ways and passages throughout <HI>Ireland,</HI> would have been as clear and open, as they are in <HI>England,</HI> (or <HI>Ireland</HI>) at this day.</P>
<P>Having thus far recounted the manifold defects, mischiefs and im∣pediments that both in the Civil and Martial Affairs so long obstructed the ful Conquest of <HI>Ireland,</HI> I should have here also briefly recited the many good Laws and Ordinances made and enacted from time to time, by the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and the Parliaments in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for re∣dressing the said mischiefs and in∣conveniences; but all fair endea∣vours and purposes of this kind proving abortive and ineffectual, for want of the Sovereign Sword, as well as the Royal Scepter to put the same in execution; I shall now onely set forth the Nature of the <HI>Irish</HI> Customs, with the evil Conse∣quences thereof; and then proceed to a conclusion of this discourse, con∣taining those Affairs that shall ap∣pear most remarkable in the reigns
<PB N="37" REF="34"/> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, and es∣pecially in the Reign of our present Gratious Sovereign King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, in order to the Refor∣mation and good Government of this Realm.</P>
<P>If we consider the Nature of the <HI>Irish</HI> Customs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Na∣ture of the <HI>Irish</HI> Cu∣stoms de∣structive to all good Govern∣ment.</NOTE> we shall find that the people which doth use them, must of necessity be Rebels to all good Government, destroy the Common-Wealth wherein they live, and bring Barbarisme and Desolation upon the richest and most fruitful Land of the World. For whereas by the just and honorable Law of <HI>England,</HI> and by the Laws of all other well governed Kingdoms and Common∣wealths, <HI>Murder, Manslaughter, Rape, Robbery</HI> and <HI>Theft,</HI> are puni∣shed with Death; By the <HI>Irish</HI> Cu∣stom, or <HI>Brehen</HI> Law, the highest of these offences was punished one∣ly with Fine, which they called an <HI>Erick.</HI> Therefore, when Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Fitz-Williams</HI> (being <HI>Lord De∣puty</HI>) told <HI>Maguire</HI> that he was to send a Sheriff into <HI>Farmannagh,</HI> be∣ing
<PB N="38" REF="35"/> lately before made a County; your Sheriff (said <HI>Maguire</HI>) shall be welcome to me, but let me know his <HI>Erick,</HI> or the price of his head before hand, that if my people cut it off, I may cut the <HI>Erick</HI> upon the Country. As for Oppression, Ex∣tortion, and other trespasses, the weaker had never any remedy a∣gainst the stronger: whereby it came to pass, that no man could en∣joy his Life, his Wife, his Lands or Goods in safety; if a mightier man then himself had an appetite to take the same from him. Wherein they were little better then <HI>Cannibals,</HI> who do hunt one another, and he that hath most strength and swift∣ness, doth eat and devour all his followers.</P>
<P>Again, In <HI>England</HI> and all well ordered Common-wealths, men have certain Estates in their Lands and possessions, and their in∣heritances descend from Father to Son, which doth give them an en∣couragement to Build, and Plant, and to improve their Lands, and to make them better for their Posteri∣ties.
<PB N="39" REF="35"/> But by the <HI>Irish</HI> Custome of <HI>Tanistry,</HI> the Chieftains of every Country, and the Chief of every Sept, had no longer Estate then for life in their Chieferies, the inheri∣tance whereof did rest in no man. And these Chieferies, though they had some portions of Land allotted to them, did consist chiefly in Cut∣tings and Cosheries, and other <HI>Irish</HI> Exactions, whereby they did spoil and impoverish the People at their pleasure. And when their Chief∣tains were dead, their Sons or next Heirs did not succeed them, but their Tanists, who were Elective, and purchased their Elections by strong hand; And by the <HI>Irish</HI> Custom of <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> the inferiour Tennanties were partible amongst all the Males of the Sept, both Bastards and Le∣gitimate: and after partition made, if any one of the Sept had died his portion was not divided among his Sons, but the Chief of the Sept made a new partition of all the Lands belonging to that Sept, and gave every one his part according to his antiquity.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="36"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That the <HI>Irish</HI> Cu∣stome of Tanistry made all their posses∣sions un∣certain.</NOTE>These two <HI>Irish</HI> Customs made all their Possessions uncertain, being shuffled, changed, and removed so often from one to another, by new Elections, and partitions; which uncertainty of Estates hath been the true cause of such Desolations and Barbarismes in this Land, as the like was never seen in any Country, that professes the name of Christ. For, though the <HI>Irish</HI> be a Nation of great Antiquity, and wanted nei∣ther Wit nor Valour; and though they had received the Christian Faith, above twelve hundred years since, and were Lovers of Musick and Poetry, and all kind of Learn∣ing, and possessed a Land abound∣ing with all things necessary for the Civil life of man; yet (which is strange to be related) they did never build any houses of Brick or Stone (some few poor Religious Houses excepted) before the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, though they were Lords of this Island for many hundred years before, and since the Conquest attempted by the <HI>English:</HI> Albeit, when they saw
<PB N="41" REF="36"/> as Build Castles upon their Borders, they did onely in imitation of us, erect some few piles for the Cap∣tains of the Country: yet may it be confidently affirm'd that never any particular person, either before or since, did build any Stone or Brick House for his private Habitation; but such as have lately obtained E∣states, according to the course of the Law of <HI>England.</HI> Neither did any of them in all this time, plant any Gardens or Orchards, Inclose or improve their Lands, live together in settled Villages, or Towns, nor made any provision for Posterity; which being against all common sense and reason, must needs be im∣puted to those unreasonable Cu∣stoms, which made their Estates so uncertain and transitory in their possessions.</P>
<P>For, who would plant, improve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And there∣fore un∣willing to improve.</NOTE> or build upon that Land, which a stranger whom he knew not should possesse after his death? For that (as <HI>Solomon</HI> noteth) is one of the strangest vanities under the sun. And this was the true reason, why
<PB N="42" REF="37"/> <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> and all the <HI>Irish</HI> Countries were found so wast and desolate a∣bout the beginning of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign; and so would have conti∣nued to the worlds end, if these Customs were not abolished by the Law of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill con∣consequen∣ces of Ga∣velkind Custom in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE>Again, That <HI>Irish</HI> Custome of <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> did breed another mis∣chief; for thereby, every man be∣ing born to Land, as well Bastard as Legitimate, they all held them∣selves to be Gentlemen. And though their Portions were never so small, and themselves never so poor, (for <HI>Gavelkind</HI> must needs in the end make a poor Gentility) yet did they scorn to descend to Hus∣bandry or Merchandize, or to learn any Mechanical Art or Science. And this is the true cause, why there were never any Corporate Towns erected in the <HI>Irish</HI> Countries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mari∣tine Towns in <HI>Ireland</HI> first built by the <HI>Ost∣men</HI> or <HI>Easterlings</HI></NOTE>As for the Maritine Cities and Towns, most certain it is, that they were Built and Peopled by the <HI>Ost∣men,</HI> or <HI>Easterlings:</HI> for the Natives of <HI>Ireland</HI> never performed so good a work, as to build a City. Besides,
<PB N="43" REF="37"/> these poor Gentlemen were so af∣fected unto their small portions of Land, as they rather chose to live at home by Theft, Extortion, and Co∣shering, then to seek any better for∣tunes abroad: which encreased their Septs or Sir-names into such num∣bers, as there are not to be found in any Kingdome of <HI>Europe</HI> so ma∣ny Gentlemen of one Blood, Fami∣ly, and Sir-name, as there were of late of the <HI>O Neals</HI> in <HI>Ʋlster;</HI> of the <HI>Bourkes</HI> in <HI>Cannaght;</HI> of the <HI>Geral∣dines</HI> and <HI>Butlers</HI> in <HI>Munster</HI> and <HI>Leinster.</HI> And the like may be said of inferiour Bloods and Families; whereby it came to pass in times of trouble and dissention, that they made great parties and factions ad∣hering to one another with much constancy; because they were tyed together, <HI>Vinculo Sanguinis;</HI> where∣as Rebels and Malefactors which are tyed to their Leaders by no bond, either of Duty or Blood, do more easily break and fall off one from another. And besides, their Co-habitation in one Territory or Country, gave them opportunity

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The waies propounded in <HI>Q.

<PB N="47" REF="39"/> agreed upon, that the fittest remedy and expedient to prevent all those future mischiefs and incon∣veniences, would be (upon the sub∣duing of <HI>Tyrone,</HI> and his Confede∣rates) to transplant the Rebels of <HI>Ʋlster</HI> into <HI>Leinster,</HI> and those of <HI>Leinster</HI> into <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> and to give all their Lands to such <HI>English</HI> as should be invited to come out of <HI>England</HI> to Plant the same, with such E∣states as should be thought meet, and for such rents, as in the whole would maintain four thousand five hundred Soldiers, and those dispo∣sed of (as now they are) in very advantageous, and well fortified Garrisons, which might prove an exceeding good thing both to her Highness, to have so many old Sol∣diers alwaies ready at a call, to what purpose soever she please to imploy them, and also to have that Land thereby so strengthened, that it should neither fear any forreign Invasion nor practice, which the <HI>Irish</HI> should ever attempt, but should keep them under in continual awe, and firm obedience. This was there∣fore
<PB N="48" REF="40"/> a notorious Error, and proved (as you have heard) of sad conse∣quence to the first <HI>English</HI> Adven∣turers, and Conquerers of this Kingdome, not to have ascertained (by way of Chiefry to be raised yearly out of the Conquered Lands) a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompetent maintenance for the perpetual continuing of five or six thousand Soldiers in pay, which should have been disposed of in se∣veral strong Garrisons through all <HI>Ireland</HI> as aforesaid; then would have followed, that the Laws of <HI>England</HI> might have been as freely communi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated to the <HI>Irish,</HI> as well as to the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, without any need of turning the <HI>Irish</HI> into Desarts and Mountains, still to con∣tinue them in their Barbarisme, but rather to have made use of them (as the present <HI>English</HI> Planters do) for their Tenants and Labourers, to the great benefit and security of the Publick, as well as the Private ad∣vantage of the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> And this was the course which the <HI>Romans</HI> observed in the Conquest of <HI>England,</HI> for they planted some of
<PB N="49" REF="40"/> their Legions in all places conveni∣ent, the which they caused the Counntry to maintain, by cutting upon every portion of Land a rea∣sonable rent, which they called <HI>Romescot,</HI> the which might not sur∣charge the Tenant or Free-holder, and might defray the pay of the Garrisons. And this hath been al∣waies observed by all Princes in all Countries to them newly subdued, to set Garrisons amongst them, to keep them in duty, whose burthen they made them to bear, and the want of this Ordinance in the first Conquest of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, was the cause of the so short decay of that Government, and the quick recovery again of the <HI>Irish,</HI> therefore by all means this was to be provided for; And this was thought to be worthy of blame, that in the Planting of <HI>Munster</HI> (after the suppression of the Earl of <HI>Des∣mond</HI>'s Rebellion <HI>Anno</HI> 1580.) that no care was had of this Ordinance, nor any strength of Garrison provi∣ded for, by a certain allowance out of all the forfeited Lands, but only

<P>Under every of those <HI>English</HI> men, were to be placed some of those <HI>Irish,</HI> to be Tenants for a cer∣tain Rent, according to the quanti∣ty of such Land as every man should have alloted to him, and should be able to Weild, wherein this special regard was to be had, that in no place under any Landlord, there should be many of them placed to∣gether, but dispersed wide from their acquaintance, and scattered far abroad through all the Country: for that was the evil which was then found in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that the <HI>Irish</HI> dwelt together by their Septs, and several Nations, so as they might practice, or conspire what they pleased; whereas, if there had been <HI>English</HI> well placed amongst them, they should not have been able once to stir or murmur, but that it should be known, and they shortned ac∣cording to their demerits.</P>

<PB N="52" REF="42"/> and Governing all things therein, according to the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> But being it was impossible to make a Common-wealth in <HI>Ireland,</HI> with∣out performing another service, which was the settling of all the E∣states and Possessions, as well of <HI>Irish</HI> as <HI>English,</HI> throughout the King∣dome.

<PB N="53" REF="42"/> of the Private and Publick Reve∣nues; These proceedings bred such comfort and security in the hearts of all men, as thereupon ensued for the space of about forty years, the calmest and most universal Peace that ever was seen in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>But the foundation of this so long for wished,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Foun∣dation of that settle∣ment sha∣ken <HI>Anno 1627.</HI> by the <HI>Irish</HI> refusing to contribute towards the pay of a standing Army in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> and most delectable Peace, was not so deeply laid, but but that it received a shake by the first storm that threatned <HI>England;</HI> for being engaged in a War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> about the begin∣ning of his Majesties Reign King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, and having there∣fore occasion to send some addition∣al Forces into <HI>Ireland,</HI> for the better assuring the Peace thereof in such a doubtful time of trouble; A pro∣position was made by the then Lord Deputy <HI>Falkland,</HI> to the chief of the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation, for the contribu∣ting of a competent sum of Money, towards the maintenance of those Forces to be established by way of a stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Army in <HI>Ireland;</HI> To which they would not condescend without a Toleration of Religion

<PB N="55" REF="43"/> that they had onely an eye to the freeing of themselves from that in∣cumbrance, without looking at all to the Desolations that were like to come upon them by a long and hea∣vy War, which the having of an Army in a readiness, might be a means to have prevented; The la∣mentable effects (said he) of our last Wars in this Kingdome doth yet freeshly stick in our memories: Nei∣ther can we so soon forget the depo∣pulation of our Land, when besides the cumbustions of War, the extremi∣ty of famine grew so great that the very Women in some places by the way side, have surprized the men that rod by, to feed themselves with the flesh of the Horse of the Rider: and that now again (said he) here is a storm towards wheresoever it will light, every wise man will easily foresee, which if we be not careful to meet with in time, our State may prove irrecoverable, when it will be too late to think of had I wist.</P>
<P>Proceeding farther, he recount∣ed to them, how that in the days of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, the Earl
<PB N="56" REF="44"/> of <HI>Desmond</HI> had made an offer of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ireland</HI> offered to Sale to the <HI>French</HI> King, in days of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth.</NOTE> (the Instrument whereof re∣mains yet upon Record in the Court of <HI>Paris</HI>) and that the Bi∣shop of <HI>Rome</HI> afterwards transfer'd the Title of all our Kingdoms unto <HI>Charles</HI> the Fift; which new Grants were confirmed unto his Son <HI>Philip,</HI> in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> with a resolution to settle the Crown of <HI>Ireland</HI> upon the <HI>Spanish Infanta:</HI> Which Donations of the Popes, howsoever they were in themselves of no value, yet would they serve for a fair colour to a Potent Preten∣der, who is able to supply, by the power of the Sword, whatsoever therein may be thought defective. Whereunto, might be added; that, of late in <HI>Spain,</HI> at the very same time, when the Treaty of the Match was in hand; there was a Book published with great approbation there, by one of <HI>Irish</HI> Birth, <HI>Philip O Sullevan:</HI> wherein the <HI>Spaniard</HI> is taught; that the ready way to e∣stablish his Monarchy (for that is the only thing he mainly aimeth at,
<PB N="57" REF="44"/> and is plainly there confessed) is first to set upon <HI>Ireland,</HI> which being quickly obtained; the Conquest of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of <HI>England</HI> next, then of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> is foretold, with great facility will follow after.</P>
<P>Neither have we more cause (saith my Lord) in this regard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A distin∣ction of the <HI>Irish.</HI></NOTE> to be afraid of a forreign Invasion, than to be jealous of a Domestick Rebellion. Where, least I be mista∣ken, as your Lordships have been lately, I must of necessity put a dif∣ference betwixt the Inhabitants of this Nation: some of them are des∣cended of the Race of the antient <HI>English;</HI> or otherwise hold their Estates from the Crown, and have Possessions of their own to stick to, who easily may be trusted against a forreign Invader, although they differ from the State in matter of Religion: for proof of which fideli∣ty in this kind (he saith) he need go no farther, than the late Wars in the time of the Earl of <HI>Tyrone;</HI> wherein they were assaulted with as powerful Temptations, to move them from their Loyalty, as possib∣ly
<PB N="58" REF="45"/> could be afterwards presented unto them; for at that time, not only the King of <HI>Spain</HI> did confede∣rate himself with the Rebels, and landed his Forces at <HI>Kingsale</HI> for their assistance: but the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> also, with his <HI>Breves</HI> and <HI>Bulls</HI> sollicited the Nobility, and Gentry of <HI>Ireland</HI> to Revolt from their Obe∣dience to the Queen, declaring that the <HI>English</HI> did fight against the <HI>Ca∣tholick</HI> Religion, and ought to be op∣pugned as much as the <HI>Turks;</HI> im∣porting the same favours, to such as should set upon them, as he doth un∣to such as fight against the <HI>Turks;</HI> and finally, promising unto them, that the God of Peace would tread down their Enemies under their feet speedily. And yet for all the Popes promises and threatnings, which were also seconded by a Declatati∣on of the Divines of <HI>Salamanca</HI> and <HI>Valledolid,</HI> not only the Lords and Gentlemen, did constantly continue their Allegiance to the Queen, but were also encoura∣ged so to do by the Priests of the <HI>Pale,</HI> that were of Popish Profes∣sion:
<PB N="59" REF="45"/> who were therefore vehement∣ly taxed by the Traytor <HI>Suellevan,</HI> for exhorting them to follow the Queens side; which he is pleased to term <HI>Insanam &amp; venenosam Doctri∣nam, &amp; tartareum Dogma,</HI> a mad and venemous Doctrine, and a hel∣lish Opinion.</P>
<P>But besides these, there were a great number of <HI>Irish,</HI> who either bore a secret grudge against the <HI>English,</HI> planted among them; or having nothing at all to lose, upon the first occasion, are apt to joyn with any forraign Invader; for we have not used that pollicie in our Plantations that wise States have u∣sed in former times. They, when the setled new Colonies in any place, did commonly translate the antient Inhabitants to other dwel∣lings. We have brought new Plant∣ers into the Land, (meaning those got by <HI>Desmonds</HI> Rebellion, and six Counties in <HI>Ʋlster</HI> by <HI>Tyrone</HI> and his Adherents departing into <HI>Spain</HI>) and have left the old Inhabitants to shift for themselves; who being strong in body, and daily increasing
<PB N="60" REF="46"/> in number, and seeing themselves deprived of their means and main∣tenance; which they and their An∣cestors had formerly injoyed, would undoubtedly be ready, when any occasion offered it self, to disturb our quiet; whether then (saith he) we cast our eyes abroad, or look at home, we see our danger is very great.</P>

<PB N="61" REF="46"/> as by the advice, not long since, pre∣sented by them unto the Council of <HI>Spain;</HI> wherein they would not have so much as the <HI>Irish</HI> Priests and Jesu∣its that are descended of <HI>English</HI> bloud to be trusted, but would have you, and all yours to be accounted Enemies to the designs of <HI>Spain.</HI> In the Declaration published about the begining of the Insurrection of <HI>James Fitz-Morrice</HI> in the South, the Rebels professed it was no part of their meaning to subvert <HI>Honora∣bile Anglorum solium;</HI> their quarrel was only against the Person of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and her Govern∣ment. But now the case is otherwise; the Translating of the Throne of the <HI>English</HI> to the Power of a Forreign∣er, is the thing that mainly is inten∣ded, and the re-establishing of the <HI>Irish</HI> in their Antient Possessions, which by the the Vallour of our An∣cestors were gained from them. This (saith my Lord) you may as∣sure your self, <HI>Manet alta mente re∣postum,</HI> and makes you more to be hated of them, than any other of the <HI>English</HI> Nation whatsoever. The

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Irish</HI> refuse to contribute towards a standing Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI> except they might first obtain a toleration of the <HI>Ro∣mish</HI> Re∣ligion.</NOTE>But all these strong arguments, with many more, could not prevail in the least with the <HI>Irish</HI> to contri∣bute one peny, in answer to his Ma∣jesties desires on this so important an occasion, without they might first obtain a Toleration of their <HI>Religion;</HI> To which the Lord Primate told them, that the onely way was, to grant to his Majesty freely, what they would give, without all man∣ner of conditions that might seem unequal unto any side; and to refer unto his own sacred breast, how far he would be pleased to extend or abridge his favours; of whose Lenity in forbearing the execution of the Statute (he said) the Recu∣sants of <HI>Ireland</HI> had found such ex∣perience, that they could not expect a greater liberty, by giving any thing that was demanded, then now al∣ready they did freely enjoy.

<PB N="64" REF="48"/> Conditions, as they were out of all hopes to obtain from him in a Calm∣er season.

<P>I have more largely insisted upon this of my Lord Primates Speech, then did well consist with my design∣ed brevity; First, because it doth ex∣cellently set forth the General State of <HI>Ireland,</HI> both as touching points of Interest, and also transactions, since the beginning of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beths</HI> Reign, down almost as far as the last <HI>Irish</HI> Rebellion, <HI>Anno</HI> 1641.

Thirdly
<PB N="65" REF="48"/> and lastly, because I find my Lord Primate a true Prophet by this his Speech, wherein he foresaw the storm that afterwards fell upon <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> in the year 1641.

<P>Now that I may draw to an end of this Discourse, and endeavour to prove what I formerly proposed;
<PB N="74" REF="53"/> That that Eternal Peace of <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">That per∣petual Peace is now esta∣blished in <HI>Ireland</HI> by the late settlement thereof, be∣ing the conclusion of this discourse.</NOTE> which was so solidly discoursed of, and stoutly fought for in Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeths</HI> time; And very far proceed∣ed in by King <HI>James;</HI> But is abso∣lutely perfected (as I said accord∣ing to all humane appearance) by the last settlement of <HI>Ireland</HI> con∣firmed by his gracious Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, I desire the Reader to take these things into his consideration; As first, to ob∣serve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The good consequen∣ces by the late settle∣ment of <HI>Ireland,</HI> By divid∣ing the great <HI>Irish</HI> Lords and Gentry, from their numerous Train of Adherents and Te∣nants.</NOTE> that by the Transplantation of the <HI>Irish</HI> Proprietors into the Pro∣vince of <HI>Connaght</HI> and County of <HI>Clare,</HI> those <HI>Irish</HI> so Transplanted were not onely provided of a liveli∣hood to support them; settled in such a place of security, as that they are wholly dis-enabled thereby to work any prejudice to the <HI>English</HI> Government; And separated (for the most part) from their numerous train of Tenants and Adherents, (who willingly staid behind them, becoming Tenants to the no small Advantage of the <HI>English,</HI> but to the great disadvantage of the <HI>Irish</HI> Lords, and Great ones of that Na∣tion,
<PB N="75" REF="53"/> who at all times chiefly relied upon these kind of people to pro∣mote their many Rebellions in <HI>Ireland</HI>) all which matters (though of very great importance) were not∣withstanding wholly neglected or o∣mitted by the <HI>English</HI> in all their former Settlements of this Realm; But also by this Transplantation of the said <HI>Irish</HI> Proprietors, the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> being invested by way of Pro∣priety and Tenancy in above three parts of four, of all the Lands in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> there will hereafter be no need to fear as formerly (the <HI>English</HI> be∣ing now the greater Number in all their Publick Assemblies and Parlia∣ments) that there shall be any far∣ther obstruction given by the Popish <HI>Irish</HI> party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By increas∣ing the Number of Protestant Justices of Peace and Parlia∣ment men, &amp;c in <HI>Ire∣land.</HI></NOTE> either to the making of good Laws, or putting the same in execution; or to the imposing of Money towards the payment of the Army, or any other publick charges; Or that the <HI>English</HI> shall henceforth fear to be any way degenerated by reason of their marrying and foster∣ing with the <HI>Irish,</HI> having there peo∣ple enough of their own Nation and
<PB N="76" REF="54"/> Religion upon the place, as well to supply their continual wants there∣in, as also by those their dispersed, and growing Numerous habitations in most parts of the Kingdome, will prove a singular good means to ci∣vilize the <HI>Irish</HI> from their wonted Barbarism.</P>
<P>Secondly, That by having now (which was otherwise formerly) all the strong Towns and Cities of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">By the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> having the possessi∣on (by way of habita∣tion) of all the strong Towns and Cities of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> for the most part inhabited by Protestants, and being withall better fortified, as not only environed with strong Walls about them, but also mightily strengthened by well forti∣fied Cittadels within them, to pre∣sent surprisals, and bravely man'd with Men, Arms and Amunition to defend them, the whole Kingdome is thereby become better secured from future Rebellions, and conse∣quently the <HI>Brittish</HI> Planters from having any more their throats cut by the <HI>Irish;</HI> It being observed for∣merly, that there was nothing did more stay and strengthen this realm, then the well fortified Corporate Towns, as by proof hath manifestly
<PB N="77" REF="54"/> appeared in many Rebellions (till the last) in which when all the Coun∣tries have swerved, the Towns have stood fast, and yielded good relief to the <HI>English</HI> Soldiers in all occasi∣ons of service; The want of which supply, by the Revolt of most of the Corporate Towns of this Kingdom, <HI>Anno</HI> 1641, First occasioned the in∣humane slaughter of the greatest part of the <HI>Brittish</HI> Planters there, who in their extremity sought the protection of those Towns but could not obtain it; Secondly, the conti∣nuance of the War so long; And last of all, the universal desolation of the Country, and almost a total extir∣pation of the whole <HI>Irish</HI> Nation out of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, and lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And by in∣creasing of his Maje∣sties Re∣venue in <HI>Ireland</HI> beyond all former ex∣amples.</NOTE> that by the late increase of his Majesties stand∣ing Revenue in <HI>Ireland,</HI> beyond all former Examples; As namely by the Imposition of Quit-Rents upon all the Lands of the Adventurers, Soldiers, and Transplanted <HI>Irish,</HI> Hearth Money, Excise, &amp;c. which wil be much more encreased beyond what it now is, by the Industry of
<PB N="78" REF="55"/> so great and universal a <HI>Brittish</HI> Plan∣tation, as will inhabite this Coun∣try, when fully Planted; It may therefore be very well hoped that <HI>Ireland</HI> will in a short time become so well improved thereby, as to be sufficiently able not onely to main∣tain a good standing Army upon the account of its own proper Revenues, to make the <HI>Irish</HI> desist from doing themselves and the <HI>English</HI> harm, (the want whereof proved the ruine of all former Settlements there, since the first Conquest of it by the <HI>Eng∣glish</HI>) and discharge all other Publick Expences; But will also (ere long) afford yearly some competent supply of money towards the filling of the <HI>English</HI> Exchequer, by way of re∣taliation, in lieu of those many and great Summs sent at several times out of <HI>England</HI> for the support of this so long unhappy Kingdom; The pre∣misses being therefore seriously and duly considered, I think I may safe∣ly conclude, that that Eternal Peace of <HI>Ireland</HI> so solidly discoursed of, and stoutly fought for in Q. <HI>Eliza∣beths</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="55"/> time: And very far proceeded in by K. <HI>James;</HI> Is now absolutely established (as I said according to all humane appearance) by his gra∣cious Majesty, our dread Sovereign K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, who long may he live in all earthly happiness; so that (I suppose) it may be now more truly said then ever, that <HI>Ire∣land</HI> which formerly served but as a Grave to bury our best men, and a Gulf to swallow our greatest Trea∣sures, is brought by the prudence and policy of her late Kings and Lord Deputies, to be an Orderly Common-Wealth, civil in it self, and in time like to prove profitable to the Prince, and at all times a good additional strength to the <HI>Brittish</HI> Empire.</P>

<P>The Aire<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aire.</NOTE> is clear and gentle, mixt with a temperate disposition, yeil∣ding neither extremity of Heat or Cold, according to the seasonable times of the Year, and the natural condition of the Continent. The Soil is generally Fruitful, Plentiful both in Fish and Flesh, and in other Vict∣uals, as Butter, Cheese and Milk.

<P>The general Commodities<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣ties.</NOTE> of this Province, are Corn, Cattel, Wood, Wool and Fish.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣ties.</NOTE>This equal temperature causeth the ground to bring forth great store of several Trees, both fit for Building &amp; bearing of Fruit; plentiful of grass for feeding of Cattle, and is abun∣dantly furnished with Horses, Sheep and Oxen; The Rivers likewise pay double Tribute, deep enough to carry Vessels either for pleasure or profit, and Fish great store, both for their own uses, and commodity of others. <HI>Salmons</HI> in some Rivers of this Country abound more in

<P>The Aire<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aire.</NOTE> is not altogether so pure and clear, as in the other Provinces of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by reason of certain moist places (covered over with grass) which of their softness are usually termed Boghs, both dangerous, and full of vaporous and foggy mists.</P>
<P>This Country as it is divided into several portions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣ties.</NOTE> so is every portion severally commended for the Soil, according to the seasonable times of the year. <HI>Thomond</HI> or the County of <HI>Clare,</HI> is said to be a County so conveniently situated, that either from the Sea or Soil there can be no∣thing wish'd for more, than what it doth naturally afford of it self, were but the industry of the Inhabitants answerable to the rest. <HI>Galaway</HI> is a Land very thankful to the painful
<PB N="92" REF="62"/> Husbandman, and no less Commo∣dious and profitable to the Shep∣heard. <HI>Maio,</HI> is replenished both with pleasure and fertility, abun∣dantly rich in Cattle, Deer, Hawks, and plenty of Honey. <HI>Slego</HI> (coast∣ing upon the Sea) is a plentiful Country for feeding and raising of Cattle. <HI>Letrim</HI> (place rising up throughout with Hills) is so full of rank grass and Forrage, that (as <HI>So∣linus</HI> reporteth) if Cattle were not kept sometims from grasing, their fulness would endanger them.

But <HI>Buckhurst,</HI> Lord Treasu∣surer, a man very skilful in Money matters, with much ado extorted from the Queen, out of necessity (for that is the Law of Time) which
<PB N="100" REF="66"/> he urged, that the Money should be changed for a time, to be called back again afterwards to the highest value; for she many times said, that this would depress her Fame, and be grievous to the Army. Yet did the Army continue without tumult, and commotion, through the Queens rare happiness, which retained her Authority with her People, joyned with love. To the Army certainly it proved a great loss, whether it turned to the benefit of the Queen or no, is not known; But to the Treasurers and Paymasters, without doubt it brought in good gain, whose avarice (which is a diligent searcher of hidden gains) may seem to have devised it.</P>
<P>The Money now generally used in <HI>Ireland</HI> (there being little of <HI>English,</HI> because prohibited to be transported thither beyond the summe of five pounds, as I take it; for the better encouragement of Trade between both Kingdoms) is most of all <HI>Spanish</HI> Coyn; to wit, pieces of Eight, at 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> the piece, consisting of Plate pieces, <HI>Mexico</HI>

<P>A piece of old <HI>English</HI> Gold is hardly to be seen in <HI>Ireland,</HI> (ex∣cept what is closely kept in private hands) though there was a great proportion thereof before the late Wars, which commonly passed from hand to hand in ordinary Pay∣ments.

<P>I have already hinted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buildings.</NOTE> how that the <HI>Irish</HI> (by reason of their Barba∣rous Laws and Customs) did never build any Houses of Brick or Stone, (some few poor Religious Houses excepted) before the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, which seems as manifest (as strange) by the entertainment of the said King

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Inhabitants, their Laws, Re∣ligion and Manners; Of their Number, Language, Stature, Dy∣et, Attire, Recreations, Names and Sir-names.</HEAD>
<P>I have already declared how it is most probable that the first In∣habitants of this Island came hi∣ther out of <HI>Britain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabi∣tants and Laws.</NOTE> now called <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> And therefore shall proceed to give some farther Ac∣count, touching the Laws of this Realm, both Ancient and Modern. The <HI>Brehon</HI> Law, by which the <HI>Irish</HI> governed themselves, was a Rule of Right unwritten, but delivered by Tradition from one to another, in which often times there appeared great shew of Equity, in determi∣ning the Right between party and party; but in many things repug∣ning quite both to Gods Law and Mans:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The parti∣ality and impiety of the <HI>Brehon Irish</HI> Law.</NOTE> As for example in the case of Murder, the <HI>Brehon,</HI> that is their Judge, would compound between

And this Judge being as he was call∣ed the Lords <HI>Brehon,</HI> adjudged for the most part, a better share unto this Lord, that is the Lord of the Soil, or the head of that Sept, and also unto himself for his judgment a grea∣ter portion, then unto the Plaintiffs or parties grieved.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Poy∣nings</HI> the best Refor∣mer of the Laws of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE>He that gave the fairest beginning to the Reformation of the Laws of <HI>Ireland,</HI> of any till his time, was Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, who finding in that Realm nothing but a common mise∣ry, took the best course he possibly could to establish there a well go∣verned Common-wealth: and to that end he held a Parliament no less fa∣mous, than that of <HI>Kilkenny;</HI> and
<PB N="107" REF="69"/> more available for the Reformation of the whole Kingdom. For where∣as all wise men did ever concur in opinion, that the readiest way to Reform <HI>Ireland,</HI> was to settle a form of Civil Government there, confor∣mable to that of <HI>England:</HI> To bring this to pass, Sir <HI>Edward Poynings</HI> did pass an Act, whereby all the Statutes made in <HI>England</HI> before that time, were enacted, established, and made of force in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Nei∣ther did he only respect the time past, but provided also for the time to come. For he caused an other Law to be made, that no Act should be propounded in any Parliament of <HI>Ireland,</HI> but such as should be first Transmitted into <HI>England,</HI> and ap∣proved by the King and Council there, as good and expedient for that Land, and so returned back again, under the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI> This Act, though it seem <HI>Prima facie</HI> to restrain the Liberty of the Subjects of <HI>Ireland;</HI> yet was it made at the Prayer of the Commons, upon just and important cause.</P>
<PB N="108" REF="70"/>
<P>For the Governors of that Realm, especially such as were of that Coun∣try Birth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poynings</HI> Act made at the re∣quest of the Commons of <HI>Ireland</HI></NOTE> had laid many opprssions upon the Commons: And amongst the rest they had imposed Laws up∣on them, not tending to the general good, but to serve private turns, and to strengthen their particular fa∣ctions. This moved them to refer all Laws, that were to be past in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be considered, corrected, and al∣lowed, first by the State of <HI>England</HI> which had alwaies been tender and careful of the good of this people, and had long since made them a Civil, Rich, and Happy Nation, if their own Lords and Governors there, had not sent bad intelligence into <HI>England.</HI> Besides this, he took special Order, that the Summons of Parliament should go into all the Shires of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and not to the four Shires onely within the <HI>English</HI> Pale; (for out of that little Precinct there were no Lords, Knights or Burgesses, Summoned to the Parlia∣ment; neither did the Kings Writ run in any other part of the King∣dom) and for that cause specially,
<PB N="109" REF="70"/> he caused all the Acts of Parliament, lately before holden by the Viscount of <HI>Gormanston</HI> to be repealed and made void. On these foundations they have raised many superstru∣ctures both of Law and Govern∣ment, enacted in their own Parlia∣ments, summoned by the Lord De∣puty at the Kings appointment. A∣mongst many inconveniences which have been observed in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> in relation to the Govern∣ment of <HI>Ireland</HI> (whereof a reforma∣tion was wisht) this was a main one; That when any of the <HI>Irish</HI> intended to go into Rebellion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Entailing of Lands supported the Rebel∣lions in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> they would convey away all their Lands, and Lordships to Feoffees in trust, whereby they reserved to them∣selves, but a State for term of life; which being determined by the sword, or by the halter, their Lands straight came to their heirs, and the Crown of <HI>England</HI> defrauded of the intent of the Law, which laid that grievous punishment upon Traytors, to forfeit all their Lands to the Prince, to the end that men might the rather be terrified from commit∣ting
<PB N="110" REF="71"/> treasons, for many which would little esteem of their own lives, yet for remorse of their Wives and Children would be with-held from that heinous crime. This ap∣peared plainly in the late Earl of <HI>Desmond.</HI> For before his breaking forth into open Rebellion, he had conveyed secretly all his Lands to Feoffees of trust, in hope to have cut off her Majesty from the Escheat of his Lands; which inconvenience, though well enough avoided at that time by an Act of Parliament (ob∣tained with much difficulty) which (by cutting off, and frustrating all such conveyances as had at any time by the space of twelve years before his Rebellion, been made, within the compass whereof, the fraudu∣lent Feoffment, and many the like of others his accomplices and fellow traytors were contained) gave all his Lands to the Queen; yet were it not an endless trouble (supposing such Acts were easily brought to pass) that no Traitor or Fellon should be attainted, but a Parlia∣ment
<PB N="111" REF="71"/> must be called for bringing of his Lands to the Crown which the Law giveth it.</P>
<P>Although since the time of St. <HI>Pa∣trick (Anno</HI> 430) Christianity was never extinct in <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> yet the Go∣vernment being hailed into contrary factions, the Nobility lawless, the multitude wilful, it came to pass that Religion waxed with the temporal common sort cold and fee∣ble, untill the Conquest by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second did settle it. The Honourable state of Marriage they much abused, either in contracts, unlawful meetings, the Levitical and Canonical degrees of prohibiti∣on, or in divorcements at pleasure, or in omitting Sacramental solemni∣ties, or in retaining either Concu∣bines or Harlots for Wives: yea, where the Clergy were faint, they could be content to Marry for a year and a day of probation, and at the years end, to return her home upon any light quarrels, if the Gen∣tlewomans friends were weak and unable to avenge the injury. Never was there heard of so many dispen∣sations
<PB N="112" REF="72"/> for Marriage, as those men show, I pray God grant they were all authentick, and builded upon sufficient warrant.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dis∣orders of the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> about the latter end of Q. <HI>Eli∣zabeths</HI> Reign, and the causes of it.</NOTE>About the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign, the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> was infested, not onely with gross <HI>Symony,</HI> greedy covetousness, fleshly incontinency, careless sloath, and generally a disordered life in the common Clergy-men: But besides all these had their particular enormi∣ties; for all the <HI>Irish</HI> Priests, which then enjoyed the Church-livings, were in a manner meer Lay-men, saving that they had taken holy Or∣ders, but otherwise they did go, and live like Lay-men, follow all kind of Husbandry, and other world∣ly affairs, as other <HI>Irish</HI> men did. They neither read Scriptures, nor preach to the People, nor administer Communion, but Baptism they did: for they Christened then after the Popish fashion, onely they took the Tithes and Offerings, and gathered what fruit else they might of their Livings, the which they converted as badly, and some of them (they
<PB N="113" REF="72"/> said) paid as due Tributes and Shares of their Livings to their Bi∣shops (I mean those which were <HI>Irish</HI>) as they received them duly.</P>
<P>Which shameful abuses the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Governours could not redress, because they knew not the parties so offending; for the <HI>Irish</HI> Bishops had their Clergy in such aw and subjecti∣on under them, that they durst not complain of them, so as they might do to them what they pleased, for they knowing their own unworthi∣ness, and incapacity, and that they were still removeable at their Bi∣shops will, yielded to what pleased him, and he took what he listed: yea, and some of them whose Diocesses were in remote parts, somewhat out of the Worlds eye, did not at all bestow the Benefices, which were in their own donation, upon any, but kept them in their own hands, and did set their own Servants and horse∣boys to take up the Tithes and Fruits of them; with the which, some of them purchased great Lands, and built fair Castles upon the same. Of which abuse, if any question
<PB N="114" REF="73"/> were moved, they had a very seem∣ly colour and excuse, that they had no worthy Ministers to bestow them upon, but kept them so unbestowed for any such sufficient person, as should be offered unto them.</P>
<P>To meet with this mischief, there was a Statute enacted in <HI>Ireland</HI> which seems to have been grounded upon a good meaning; That what∣soever <HI>English-man</HI> of good conver∣sation and sufficiency, should be brought to any of the Bishops, and nominated unto any Living, within their Diocess that were presently void, that he should (without any contradiction) be admitted there∣unto, before any <HI>Irish:</HI> which good Law, though it had been well obser∣ved, and that none of the Bishops had transgressed the same, yet it wrought no Reformation thereof for many defects.</P>
<P>First, there were no such suffici∣ent <HI>English</HI> Ministers sent over as might be presented to any Bishop for any Living; but the most part of such <HI>English</HI> as came over thither of themselves, were either unlearned,
<PB N="115" REF="73"/> or men of some bad note, for which they had forsaken <HI>England.</HI> So as the Bishop to whom they should have been presented, might justly reject them as incapable and insuf∣ficient. Secondly, the Bishop himself being perhaps an <HI>Irish man</HI> who being made Judge by that Law, of the sufficiency of the Mini∣sters, might at his own Will, dis∣like of the <HI>English man,</HI> as unwor∣thy in his Opinion, and admit of a∣ny <HI>Irish,</HI> whom he should think more for his turn. And if he should at the Instance of any <HI>English man</HI> of coun∣tenance there, whom he would not displease, accept of any such <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Minister as should be tendered unto him, yet he would under-hand, carry such a hard hand over him, or by his Officers wring him so sore, that he would soon make him wea∣ry of his poor Living. Lastly, the Benefices themselves were so mean, and of so small profit in those <HI>Irish</HI> Countreys, through the ill husban∣dry of the <HI>Irish</HI> people which did inhabit them, that they would not yeild any competent maintenance
<PB N="116" REF="74"/> for any honest Minister to live upon, scarcely to buy him a Gown. And had all this been redressed, yet what good should any <HI>English</HI> Minister have done amongst them, by teach∣ing or preaching unto them, which either could not understand him, or would not hear him? Or what com∣fort of life could he have, where his Parishoners were so insatiable, so intractable, so ill affected to him, as they usually are to all the <HI>English?</HI> Or finally, how durst almost any ho∣nest Ministers, that were peaceable civil men, commit their safety to the hands of such Neighbours, as the boldest Captains durst scarce dwell by?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> much Re∣formed of late.</NOTE>But these Obstructions (by the special Providence of God appear∣ing in the late Revolutions of <HI>Ire∣land</HI>) seems upon the matter to be wholly taken away; for first, there are now in <HI>Ireland</HI> (together with other Divines that commonly repair thither out of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI>) a sufficient number of able Ministers bred up in <HI>Trinity</HI> Colledge at <HI>Dub∣lin</HI> to supply the above mentioned
<PB N="117" REF="74"/> first Defect. Secondly, all the Bi∣shops of <HI>Ireland</HI> are now worthy learned Protestants, who with all the endeavours they can, do incourage Protestant Ministers to settle them∣selves in such convenient places, as they may do God and that Countrey good service, and themselves have thereby a comfortable subsistance. Besides, the <HI>English</HI> Magistracy and Gentry being now so generally dis∣persed through all parts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> do give great countenance to the Protestant Ministry to proceed cheerfully and industriously in their Vocations. Lastly, the Benefices themselves are now (by the indu∣stry and good husbandry of the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Planters, together with the uni∣ting of two or three Parishes into one to supply the imperfect Plantation thereof) become so considerable (and will much more hereafter when fully Planted) as to be able to yeild a competent maintenance for honest learned Ministers to live upon; and which is a farther encouragement to them, have already very considera∣ble Congregations of Protestant-Plantres

<P>Secondly, King <HI>James,</HI> out of the forfeited Lands of the six Counties in <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> allowed fair proportions of Land, as Gleabable to those Pa∣rishes within the said forfeited Coun∣ties, which has caused them (for so much) to be counted better Livings for Ministers, than in any other part of that Kingdom.</P>

<P>Having thus far briefly rendered an account touching matter of fact,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the <HI>Irish</HI> can pretend no grievances, as motives to the last Rebellion <HI>An. 164<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> transacted in this most bloudy Re∣bellion; I shall in the next place take an occasion to enquire, whether this desperate resolution of the <HI>Irish</HI> proceeded from the sense of some grievous oppressions imposed upon by their <HI>English</HI> Governours, or ra∣ther meerly from an impetuous de∣sire they had to draw the whole Government of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> into their own hands: Upon due consideration whereof, I cannot find they had the least cause to com∣plain of oppression; for his late Ma∣jesties Indulgence was so great to∣wards his Subjects of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as that in the year 1640. upon their complaints, and a general Remon∣strance sent over unto him from both Houses of Parliament then sitting at <HI>Dublin,</HI> by a Committee of four Temporal Lords of the Upper House, and twelve Members of the
<PB N="130" REF="81"/> House of Commons, with instructi∣ons to represent the heavy pressures they had for some time suffered un∣der the Government of the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> He took these Grievan∣ces into his Royal Consideration, descended so far to their satisfacti∣on, as that he heard them himself, and made present Provisions for their redress. And upon the decease of Mr. <HI>Wandsford,</HI> Master of the Rolls in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and then Lord De∣puty there, under the said Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> who still continued Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom (though then accused of High Treason, and imprisoned in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> by the Parliament of <HI>England</HI>) His Majesty sent a Commission of Go∣vernment to the Lord <HI>Dillon</HI> of <HI>Kil∣kenny</HI> West, and Sir <HI>William Parsons,</HI> Knight and Baronet, Master of the Wards in <HI>Ireland;</HI> yet soon after, finding the choice of the Lord <HI>Dillon</HI> to be much disgusted by the Com∣mittee, he did at their Motion, cause the said Commission to be Cancell'd, and with their consent and approba∣tion, placed the Government upon
<PB N="131" REF="81"/> Sir <HI>William Parsons,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Borlace</HI> Knight, Master of the Or∣dinance, both esteemed persons of great Integrity; and the Master of Wards, by reason of his very long continued imployment in the State, his particular knowledge of the Kingdom, much valued and well beloved amongst the People. They took the Sword upon the ninth of <HI>February</HI> 1640. And in the first place they aplyed themselves with all gen∣tle lenitives to mollifie the sharp hu∣mours raised by the rigid passages in the former Government. They de∣clared themselves against all such proceedings lately used, as they found any ways varying from the Common Law: They gave all due encouragement to the Parliament then sitting, to endeavour the reaso∣nable ease and contentment of the people, freely ascenting to all such Acts as really tended to a Legal Re∣formation: They betook themselves wholly to the advice of the Councel, and caused all matters, as well of the Crown as Popular Interest, to be handled in his Majesties Courts of
<PB N="132" REF="82"/> Justice: no way admitting the late exorbitancies (so bitterly decryed in Parliament) of Paper-Petitions or Bills, in Civil Causes, to be brought before them at the Councel-board, or before any other by their Authority: They, by his Majesties gracious directions, gave way to the Parliament to abate the Subsidies (there given, in the Earl of <HI>Straffords</HI> time, and then in Collection) from forty thousand pounds each Subsidy, to twelve thousand pounds a piece, so low did they think fit to reduce them: And they were farther con∣tent (because they saw his Maje∣sty most absolutely resolved to give the <HI>Irish</HI> Agents full satisfaction) to draw up two Acts to be passed in the Parliament, most impetuously desi∣red by the Natives; The one was the Act of Limitations, which un∣questionably settled all Estates of Land in the Kingdom, quietly en∣joyed without claim or interruption for the space of sixty years immedi∣ately preceding; The other was for the relinquishment of the right and title which his Majesty had to the
<PB N="133" REF="82"/> four Counties in <HI>Connaght,</HI> legally found for him by several Inquisitions taken in them, and ready to be di∣sposed upon a due Survey, to <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> undertakers; as also to some Territories of good extant in <HI>Moun∣ster,</HI> and the County of <HI>Clare</HI> upon the same title.</P>
<P>Thus was the present Govern∣ment most sweetly tempered, and carryed on with great lenity and moderation; the Lords Justices and Councel wholly departing from the rigour of former courses, did gently unbend themselves into a happy and just compliance with the seasonable desires of the people. And his Majesty, that he might farther testify his own settled resolution for the continuation thereof, with the same tender hand over them, having first given full satisfaction in all things to the said Committee of Par∣liament still attending their dispatch, did about the latter end of <HI>May</HI> 1641. declare <HI>Kobert</HI> Earl of <HI>Lei∣cester,</HI> Lord Lieutenant General of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland.</HI> He was Heir to Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI> his Unckle,
<PB N="134" REF="83"/> as well as to Sir <HI>Henry Sidney,</HI> his Grandfather, who with great Ho∣nour and much Integrity long con∣tinued Chief Governour of <HI>Ireland</HI> during the Reign of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth;</HI> and being a person of excellent Abilities by Nature, great Acquisi∣tions from his own private Industry, and publick Imployment abroad, of exceeding great Temper and Mode∣ration, was never engaged in any publick pressures of the Common∣wealth, and therefore most likely to prove a just and gentle Governour, most pleasing and acceptable to the people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ro∣mish</HI> Catho∣licks pri∣vately en∣joyed the exercise of their Reli∣gion through all <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE>Moreover, the <HI>Romish</HI> Catholicks privately enjoyed the free exercise of their Religion throughout the whole Kingdom, according to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> They had, by the over great indul∣gence of the late Governours, their Titular Arch-bishops, Bishops, Vi∣cars general, Provincial Consistories, Deans, Abbots, Priors, Nuns, who all lived freely, though somewhat covertly among them, and without controul exercised a voluntary juris∣diction
<PB N="135" REF="83"/> over them, they had their Priests, Jesuits and Fryars, who were of late years exceedingly mul∣tiplyed, and in great numbers re∣turned out of <HI>Spain, Italy</HI> and other forreign parts, where the Children of the Natives of <HI>Ireland</HI> that way devoted, were sent usually to receive their Education. And these without any manner of Restraint, had quiet∣ly settled themselves in all the chief Towns, Villages, Noblemen and private Gentlemens houses through∣out the Kingdom. So as the private exercise of all their Religious Rites, and Ceremonies were freely enjoy∣ed by them without any manner of disturbance, and not any of the Laws put in execution, whereby heavy penalties were to be inflict∣ed upon transgressors in that kind.</P>
<P>Now seeing we have manifestly found by woful experience that all those Princely favours and tender proceedings of his late Majesty to∣wards the <HI>Irish,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">That no Princely favors can oblige the <HI>Popish-I∣rish</HI> part to be Loyal to the Crown of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE> proved altogether ineffectual to contain them within the due bounds of Loyalty and Obe∣dience; The world may easily be∣lieve,

<P>Sixthly, That onely the ancient Nobility of the Kingdome should stand, and of them, such as should refuse to conform to the <HI>Romish</HI> Re∣ligion, to be removed, and others put in their room; howsoever the then present Earl of <HI>Kildare</HI> was to be excluded, and another establish∣ed in his place.</P>
<P>Seventhly, All Plantation Lands to be recalled, and the antient pro∣prietors to be reinvested in their for∣mer estates, with the limitations in their Covenant expressed; That they had not formerly sold their in∣terests on valuable considerations.</P>
<P>Eighthly, That the respective Countries of the Kingdom, should be sub-divided, and certain Bounds or Barronies assigned to the chief Septs, and others of the Nobility, who were to be answerable for the Government thereof: And that a standing Army might be still in be∣ing, the respective Governors being
<PB N="143" REF="87"/> to keep a certain number of men to be ready at all risings out (as they term'd it:) They also being to build and maintain certain Fortresses, in places most convenient within their Precincts: And that these Governours should be of absolute power, only responsible to the Parliament.</P>
<P>Lastly, for maintaining a corre∣spondency with other Nations, and for securing the Coasts, that also they might be rendered considera∣ble unto others, a Navy of a cer∣tain number of Ships was to be maintained. That to this end five Houses were to be appointed, one in each Province, accounting <HI>Meath</HI> for one of them; That to those hou∣ses should be allotted an annual pen∣sion of certain thousands of pounds to be made up of part of the Lands appropriate to Abbeys: And a far∣ther Contribution to be raised in the respective Provinces to that end: That these Houses were to be assign∣ed to a certain Order of Knights, answerable to that of <HI>Malta,</HI> who were to be Sea-men: And to Main∣tain
<PB N="144" REF="88"/> this Fleet: that all Prizes were to be apportioned; some part for a Common Bank, the rest to be divi∣ded; to which purpose the felling of Woods serviceable for this use was to be forbidden: The house for this purpose to be assigned to the Pro∣vince of <HI>Leinster,</HI> was <HI>Kilmainham,</HI> or rather <HI>Houth,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Ho∣with</HI> being otherwise to be accommo∣dated, provided he joyn with them; that place being esteemed most con∣venient, in respect of scituation, which they had small grounds to hope for.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trans∣plantation justified, by reason of the late barba∣rous carri∣age of the <HI>Irish</HI> to∣wards the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE>The serious consideration of this strange behaviour of the <HI>Irish,</HI> to∣wards the <HI>English,</HI> hath given them just cause to place a wall of seperati∣on between them and such dange∣rous Neighbours, by whose barba∣rous carriage and inhumanity, there were (since the Rebellion first brake out unto the time of the cessa∣tion made <HI>Sept.</HI> 15. 1643. which was not full two years after) three hundred thousand <HI>British</HI> and Prote∣stants cruelly murthered in cold
<PB N="145" REF="88"/> bloud, destroyed some other way, or expelled out of their habitations, according to the strictest conjecture, and computation of those who seem∣ed best to understand the numbers of <HI>English</HI> planted in <HI>Ireland,</HI> besides those few which perished in the heat of fight, during the War:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The losses sustained by the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Plan∣ters in the space of <HI>2.</HI> years from <HI>Oct. 23. 1641.</HI> a∣mounted to <HI>635375</HI> l.</NOTE> And upon an enquiry made in <HI>Ireland An.</HI> 1641. of their losses sustained in their Estates, Fortunes and Livelyhoods, by Spoil and Robbery, from the 23. of <HI>October</HI> 1641. till the 8. of <HI>March</HI> following, by estimation they a∣mounted to six hundred thirty five thousand, three hundred seventy five pounds. And if a right informa∣tion could have been taken, as I sup∣posed, would have amounted to neer five hundred times as much.</P>
<P>It hath been said (of late) by some,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> that the people of <HI>England</HI> are quadrubled, within four hundred years, as doubling every two hun∣dred years: How true this may be in relation to <HI>England</HI> I know not; but I am perswaded that this obser∣vation may be more properly ap∣plyed to <HI>Ireland,</HI> which has been
<PB N="146" REF="89"/> (within these four hundred years) mightily improved by clearing of grounds from a Wilderness, and thereby consequently giving way for the enlargment of peoples Habitati∣ons, <HI>Ireland</HI> being reported to be generally overgrown with Woods in <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> his time. Though <HI>Ireland</HI> was very populous before the last War, and is compu∣ted to be half as big as <HI>England,</HI> yet I dare not say that it contained half as many people as <HI>England</HI> did, be∣cause above one fourth part of <HI>Ire∣land</HI> is taken up with unprofitable Boggs, Lakes and barren Moun∣tains; and for that the Towns Cities of <HI>England</HI> are far greater and more numerous in proportion, than those of <HI>Ireland;</HI> in so much, as that the City of <HI>London</HI> it self may be thought to contain more people, than one half of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> in the best of times; But whether <HI>Ireland</HI> did (in its prime) contain two millions of people, or what more, I will not take upon me to determin, but do submit the de∣cision of so doubtful a matter to
<PB N="147" REF="89"/> more knowing persons, together with the enquiry, whither in time to come (when <HI>Ireland</HI> shall be ful∣ly inhabited) it may be thought (though mixedly) the <HI>English</HI> may inhabit the proportion of about one Province and an half of it, though most numerous in the Provinces of <HI>Mounster</HI> and <HI>Leinster:</HI> The <HI>Irish</HI> the like proportion of one Province and an half more, though most numerous in the Province of <HI>Connnaght;</HI> And the <HI>Scots</HI> inhabiting the proportion of a fourth part of <HI>Ireland,</HI> but more numerous in the Province of <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> than in any other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Irish</HI> tongue is sharp and sen∣tentious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Language.</NOTE> offereth great occasion to quick Apothegms and proper allusi∣ons, wherefore their common Je∣sters, Bards, and Rymers, are said to delight passingly those that con∣ceive the grace and propriety of the tongue. But the true <HI>Irish</HI> indeed differeth so much from that they they commonly speak, that scarce one amongst five score, can either write, read, or understand it. There∣fore it is prescribed among certain
<PB N="148" REF="90"/> their Poetes, and other Students of Antiquity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italian, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Tongues are compounded of the La∣tine. The <HI>German</HI> (high and low Country) <HI>Saxon, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> have great affinity. <HI>North-Wales, South-Wales, Cornwall,</HI> and Little <HI>Britain</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>Cam∣brensis</HI> and Sir <HI>John Price</HI> have learn∣edly discoursed; but the <HI>Irish</HI> (ex∣cept the <HI>Redshanks,</HI> and the <HI>Scottish</HI> of the <HI>High-lands</HI>) have affinity with no Tongue (as I can learn) more then with the <HI>British</HI> Language.</P>
<P>Many reasons there are to induce one to be of this opinion; first of all according to the first command, the <HI>Celtick</HI> Tongue was of force in all these Northern parts. <HI>Bodinus</HI> writeth, that the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Celtick</HI> Language was all one. <HI>Pausanius</HI> the <HI>Greecian</HI> maketh mention how the <HI>Celts</HI> in their Language called a Horse <HI>Marc,</HI> and three Horses, <HI>Trimarc;</HI> the which, the <HI>Welchman</HI> useth to this day with a guttural alteration, <HI>Margh,</HI> and <HI>Treemargh.</HI> Also <HI>Cam∣den,</HI> the learned Antiquary of this
<PB N="149" REF="90"/> our Age, is of this opinion (remem∣bring the Story of <HI>Gurguntius,</HI> and the infinite number of <HI>British</HI> Words in use among the <HI>Irish,</HI> the which he termeth <HI>infinitam vim Britannicarum dictionum</HI>) that the <HI>Britains</HI> first peopled this Land. And although of a long time (by reason of troubles, and alterations) the speech grew wholly out of use; yet afterwards in success of time it was revived. Secondly, the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> oft <HI>Matched</HI> together, so that there grew among them great alliance and af∣finity, to the fartherance of the Lan∣guage. Thirdly, the first Conquer∣ors in <HI>Henry</HI> the Seconds time, that brake the Ice into this Land, were <HI>Welch-men,</HI> whose Names and Seats to this day are fresh in memory. As for instance, in the Dioces of <HI>Leigh∣lin,</HI> there is a Town called <HI>Villa Wallicorum,</HI> the Town of <HI>Welch men. Careg</HI> and <HI>Craig</HI> in the <HI>British</HI> or <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue is a Stone or Rock, and of the <HI>Britains, Carreggferggus, Carreggmont-Griffiin, Carregg</HI> in <HI>Shurie, Carrigguaspin,</HI> and <HI>Craigwa∣ding,</HI> have their Names. Likewise,
<PB N="150" REF="91"/> <HI>Llis</HI> in <HI>British</HI> is a Court or Palace, of that in <HI>Ireland</HI> you have <HI>Lismore, Lisfenyn, Lislofty, Lismakery. Glan</HI> and <HI>Glyn</HI> are <HI>British</HI> words, of them have you <HI>Glangibbon, Glandoboy, Glanreynold, Glynburry, Glyndelory, Glynmoloura,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Inis</HI> an Island, is <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> of which kind are <HI>Inissirocan, Inishoven, Inisdiok, Inis∣uag, Iniscorthie,</HI> and the like. <HI>Rath,</HI> a Moat or round Trench (whereof there are many in <HI>Ireland</HI> made by the <HI>Danes</HI>) if <HI>Beda</HI> had not said that it was a <HI>Saxon</HI> word, I would have said it had been <HI>British,</HI> and how ma∣ny names of places are compound∣ed with it in <HI>Ireland,</HI> were too long to reherse. I will here give <HI>Stainhurst</HI> leave to conclude, <HI>Omnes Insulae locos &amp; lucos Wallici nominis gloria imple∣vit;</HI> the renown of the <HI>Welch</HI> name (saith he) hath filled all the ways and woods of the Island. The <HI>Irish</HI> are now generally bred both to read and speak the <HI>English</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Irish</HI> are commonly of a large and handsome proportion of body, clear of Skin and Hue. Their Wo∣men are well Favoured, clear Co∣loured,
<PB N="151" REF="91"/> fair handed, big and large, suffered from their infancy to grow at Will, nothing curious of their feature and proportion of body.</P>
<P>The Common sort of People in <HI>Ireland</HI> do feed generally upon Milk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dyet.</NOTE> Butter, Curds and Whey, New bread made of Oat meal, Beans, Bar∣ly and Pease, and sometimes of Wheat upon Festivals, their bread be∣ing baked every day against the fire. Most of their Drink is Butter-milk and Whey; They feed much also upon Parsnips, Potatoes, and Water∣cresses, and in those Countreys bor∣dering on the Sea, upon Sea weeds, as Dullusck, Slugane, but seldome eat Flesh. The middle sott of the <HI>Irish</HI> Gentry differ not much from the same kind of Dyet, save only that they oftner feed upon Flesh, eat better Bread, and drink Beer more frequently. They are all of them (when opportunity offers it self) too much inclined to drink Beer and <HI>Ʋsquebagh</HI> to an excess; And both Men and Women of all sorts, extreamly addicted to take Tobacco in a most abundant manner.
<PB N="152" REF="92"/> The best sort of <HI>Irish</HI> do imitate the <HI>English</HI> both in Dyet and Apparel, but not without a palpable difference (most commonly) in the mode of their Entertainment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e.</NOTE>Trouses and Mantles were (till King <HI>James</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> his Reign) the general habit of the <HI>Irish;</HI> their Mantles serving many times as a fit house for an Out-Law, a meet bed for a Rebel, and an apt cloak for a Thief; But now the Men wear their cloaths altogether after the <HI>English</HI> fashion, having converted their Mantles into Cloaks, with which kind of wear they are much affected. Formerly they used no Hats, but Caps made of <HI>Irish</HI> Frize, called <HI>Cappeenes,</HI> and even now the middle sort of Gentry sel∣dome wear Bands, unless they go abroad amongst Strangers. The Common sort of People both Men and Women wear no <HI>English</HI> Shoos, but things called <HI>Irish Brogues,</HI> thin soled, somewhat like our Poumps, and sowed altogether with Leather. The ordinary sort ef <HI>Irish</HI> Women wear a kind of loose Gowns with∣out
<PB N="153" REF="92"/> stiffening, with Petticoats, and Wascoats without any Bodys; ha∣ving linnen Kerchers about their heads, instead of head-cloaths, and never using hats, but covering their heads with their Mantles to save themselves from rain, or the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>The <HI>Irish</HI> Gentry are musically disposed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recreati∣ons.</NOTE> &amp; therefore many of them play singular well upon the <HI>Irish-Harp;</HI> they affect also to play at Tables; The Common sort meet oftentimes in great numbers (in plain Meadows or Ground) to re∣create themselves at a play called <HI>Bandy,</HI> with Balls and crooked Sticks, much after the manner of our play at <HI>Stoe-ball;</HI> they are much given to Dancing after their Coun∣trey way, and the men to play up∣on the <HI>Jews-Harp,</HI> and at Cards, but for no great value.</P>
<P>The <HI>Irish</HI> Names<NOTE PLACE="marg">Irish <HI>Names.</HI></NOTE> of Baptism are generally, <HI>Teig, Patrick, Turlough, Murrogh, Mortoch, Donoch, Lough∣lin, Dermot,</HI> &amp;c. with many other Names made use of there as well as here in <HI>England;</HI> as namely, <HI>John,
<PB N="154" REF="93"/> Edmund, Edward, Thomas, William, James,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sirnames</NOTE>For the better breaking of the Heads, and Septs of the <HI>Irish,</HI> which was one of their greatest strength, and motive to lead them to Rebellion, there was a law made in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, by which it was command∣ed, that whereas all men then used to be called by the name of their Septs, according to the several Na∣tions, and had no Sirnames at all, that from thenceforth each one should take upon himself a several Sirname, either of his trade and fa∣culty, or of some quality of his body or mind, or the place where he dwelt, so as every one should be distinguish∣ed from the other, or from the most part, whereby they should not only; not depend upon the head of their Sept, as then they did, but also in time, learn quite to forget the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation. And herewithall would I also wish all the <HI>O's</HI> and <HI>Mac's,</HI> which the Heads of Septs have taken to their names, to be utterly for∣bidden and extinguished. For that
<PB N="155" REF="93"/> the same being an Ordinance (as some say) first made by <HI>O Brien</HI> for for the strengthning of the <HI>Irish,</HI> the abrogating thereof will as much in∣feeble them. The custome of prefix∣ing the vowel <HI>O,</HI> to many of the chief <HI>Irish</HI> Sirnames began in the Reign of <HI>Brien Boria</HI> the son of <HI>Ken∣nethy</HI> King of <HI>Ireland.</HI> As for <HI>Mac</HI> in Sirnames, it beareth no other sig∣nification, then <HI>Fitz</HI> doth amongst the <HI>French,</HI> and (from them) the <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Ap</HI> with the <HI>Welch.</HI> And although it were more anciently used then the other, yet it varied according to the Fathers Name, and became not so soon fully settled in families.</P>

<P>THe Government<NOTE PLACE="marg">Govern∣ment</NOTE> of <HI>Ireland</HI> by <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> or Deputies, were from the first entrance of the <HI>English</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, till King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third's days, called Ju∣sticers of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and Justicers and Keepers of the Land of <HI>Ireland;</HI> then Lieutenants, and their Vicegerent Deputies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vice-Roys or Deputies of <HI>Ireland</HI> di∣versly na∣med at sundry times.</NOTE> Afterward, they were at the Prince his pleasure tearmed, som∣times Deputies, somtimes Justicers, and sometimes Lieutenants, (which is a little more honour) but for the most part with one and the same au∣thority. And without doubt those first Justicers of <HI>Ireland</HI> (as the Ju∣sticer of <HI>England,</HI> who in that age was also for brevity called Justice,) were ordained for keeping of the Peace, and Ministring of Justice to all and every person; as were the

<PB N="166" REF="99"/> worthily observed by <HI>Machiavel</HI> in his discourses upon <HI>Livie,</HI> where he commendeth the manner of the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> Government, in giving abso∣lute Power to all their Councellors and Governors, which if they abused they afterwards should dearly answer And the contrary thereof he repre∣hendeth in the States of <HI>Venice,</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> and many other Principa∣lities of <HI>Italy:</HI> who use to limit their chief Officers so strictly, as that thereby they have oftentimes lost such happy occasions, as they could never come unto again: The like whereof, who so hath been conver∣sant in the Government of <HI>Ireland</HI> (especially during Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign) hath too often seen to their great hindrance and hurt.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That be∣sides the want of Power, there were eminent defects ob∣served in the man∣agemet of the publick Affairs of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE>Besides this want of Power which did hinder the good Reformation of <HI>Ireland,</HI> there were eminent defects noted in the mangement of the pub∣lick Affairs of that Kingdom, by some of the chief Governors there∣of, who seeing the end of their Go∣vernment to draw nigh, and some mischiefs and practices growing up,
<PB N="167" REF="99"/> which afterwards might work trou∣ble to the next succeeding Governor, would not attempt the redress, or cut∣ting off thereof, either for fear they should leave the Realm unquiet at the end of their Government, or that the next that came, should receive the same too quiet, and so happily win more praise thereof, than they before. And therefore they would not seek at all to repress that evil, but would either by granting pro∣tection for a time, or holding some emparlance with the Rebel, or by treaty of Comissioners, or by other like devices, only smother and keep down the flame of the mischief, so it might not break out in their time of Government, what came af∣terwards they cared not, or rather wish'd the worst</P>
<P>To this may be added,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The savor∣ing of the <HI>Irish,</HI> and depressing of the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> an ill practice by some of the Lord Deputies of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> that when the <HI>Irish</HI> have been broken by the Sword of one Governour, and there∣by consequently made fit and capa∣ble for subjection, another succeed∣ing (as it were) into his harvest, and finding an open way made for what course he pleased, bent not to that
<PB N="168" REF="100"/> point which the former intended, but rather quite contrary, and as it were in scorn of the former, and in vain vaunt of his own Councels, would tread down and disgrace all the <HI>English,</HI> and set up and counte∣nance the <HI>Irish</HI> all that he he could, thereby to make them more tracta∣ble and buxome to his Government, (wherein he thought much amiss) for surely his Government could not be sound and wholsome for that Realm, it being so contrary to the former. For it was even as two Phy∣sicians should take one sick body in hand, at two sundry times: of which, the former would minister al things meet to purge and keep un∣der the body; the other, to pamper and strengthen it suddenly again; whereof, what is to be looked for, but a most dangerous relapse? Therefore, by all means it ought to be fore-seen, and assured, that after once entering into this course of Re∣formation, there be afterwards no remorse nor drawing back for the sight of any such rueful objects, as must thereupon follow, nor for com∣passion
<PB N="169" REF="100"/> of their Calamities, seeing that by no other means it is possible to cure them, and that these are not of will, but of very urgent ne∣cess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Title al∣tered from <HI>Lord</HI> to <HI>King.</HI></NOTE>SIR <HI>Anthony Saint-Leger</HI> Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in a Parlia∣ment which he held the 33. of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> 8. caused an Act to pass, which gave unto King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, his Heirs and Successors, the Name, Stile and Title of <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Ireland;</HI> Whereas, before that time, the Kings of <HI>England</HI> were stiled but Lords of <HI>Ireland:</HI> Although indeed, they were absolute Monarchs there∣of, and had in right all Royal and Imperial Jurisdiction and Power there, as they had in the Realm of <HI>England.</HI> And yet because in the vulgar conceit the name of <HI>King</HI> is higher than the name of <HI>Lord;</HI> assu∣redly the assuming of this Title, hath
<PB N="171" REF="101"/> not a little raised the Sovereignity of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> in the minds of this people. And because it hath been doubted by some whether we might Lawfully fight against the <HI>Irish,</HI> I shall (for farther satisfacti∣on) here insert the Right and Ti∣tle the Crown of <HI>England</HI> hath to the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as to every part of it, and to the whole divers ways.</P>
<P>I will begin with the Pedigree of <HI>William Earl Marshal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Title to <HI>Leinster.</HI></NOTE> for thereup∣on depend many Records in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Right to <HI>Leinster. Walter Fitz Richard,</HI> who came from <HI>Normandy</HI> with <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> died Lord <HI>Strongbow</HI> of <HI>Strigule, alias Chepstow</HI> without Issue, to whom succeeded his Sisters Son, who was created the first Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and had Issue, <HI>Richard</HI> the inheritor of <HI>Leinster,</HI> by a Cove∣nant and Marriage of <HI>Eva,</HI> the Sole Daughter of <HI>Mac Murrough</HI> King of <HI>Leinster.</HI> This <HI>Richard</HI> conveyed to <HI>Henry</HI> the Second all his Title, and held of him the Lordship of <HI>Leinster</HI> in four Counties, <HI>Wexford,
<PB N="172" REF="102"/> Catherlagh, Ossory</HI> and <HI>Kildare. Richard</HI> left Issue, a Daughter <HI>Issabel,</HI> married to <HI>William</HI> Earl <HI>Marshal</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> Lord <HI>Strongbow,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Leinster. William</HI> had Issue, five Sons, who died without Issue, when every of them, except the youngest, had suc∣cessively possessed their Fathers Lands; and five Daughters, <HI>Maud, Jone, Issabel, Sibil</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> among whom the Patrimony was parted <HI>Anno</HI> 31. <HI>H.</HI> 3. Of these Daughters bestowed in Marriage, are descend∣ed many Noble Houses, as the <HI>Mor∣timers, Bruises, Clares,</HI> &amp;c. born Subjects to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> paying ever to the King his Duties reserved.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Title to <HI>Mounster.</HI></NOTE>At the very first arrival of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, the Princes of <HI>Mounster</HI>

<P><HI>Connaght</HI> descended to divers Heirs, owing service to the Prince, but <HI>Ʋlster</HI> returned by devolution to the special Inheritance and the Re∣venues of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> in this manner; The said <HI>de Burgo,</HI> had Issue, <HI>Richard,</HI> who had Issue, <HI>John,</HI> who had Issue <HI>William,</HI> who was slain without Issue, and a Daughter <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> entitled to thirty thousand Marks yearly, by the Earldome of <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> whom <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the Third gave in marriage to <HI>Lionel</HI> his second Son, Duke of <HI>Cla∣rence,</HI> who had Issue a Daughter <HI>Philippe,</HI> married to <HI>Edward Mor∣timer,</HI>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Several Claims to the Land of <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several claims to the Land of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE>1. <HI>Mac Gil-murrow</HI> King of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> with all his Petty Princes, Lords and Captains, summoned to King <HI>Arthurs</HI> Court held in <HI>Carlion Anno</HI> 519. did accordingly their homage, and attended all the while his great Feast and Assembly lasted.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Monarch of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> and all other, both <HI>Reges</HI> and <HI>Reguli</HI> for them and for theirs for ever, betook themselves to <HI>Henry</HI> the Second <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1172. namely those of the South, whiles he lay at <HI>Waterford,
<PB N="175" REF="103"/> Dermot</HI> K. of <HI>Corke,</HI> which is the Na∣tion of the <HI>Mac Cartyes,</HI> at <HI>Cashel, Do∣nald</HI> K. of <HI>Limrick,</HI> which is the Nati∣on of the <HI>Obrenes, Donald</HI> K. of <HI>Osso∣ry, Mac Shaghlon</HI> King of <HI>Ophaly,</HI> at <HI>Divelin</HI> did the like, <HI>Okernel</HI> King of <HI>Ʋriel, Ororick</HI> King of <HI>Meth, Rode∣rick</HI> King of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> and of <HI>Con∣naght.</HI> This did they with consents and shouts of their People; and King <HI>Henry</HI> returned without any Battle given. Only <HI>Ʋlster</HI> remained, which <HI>John de Courcy</HI> soon after conquered, and <HI>Oneale</HI> Captain of all the <HI>Irish</HI> there, came to <HI>Dublin</HI> to <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, <HI>An.</HI> 1399. and freely bound himself by Oath and great Sums of Money, to be true to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The same time <HI>O Brien</HI> of <HI>Thomond, Oconar</HI> of <HI>Connaght, Ar∣thur Mac Murrow</HI> of <HI>Leinster,</HI> and all the <HI>Irish</HI> Lords which had been somewhat disordered, renewed their Obedience.</P>
<P N="4">4. When <HI>Ireland</HI> first received the Christian Faith, they gave them∣selves into the Jurisdiction both Spi∣ritual and Temporal, of the See of
<PB N="176" REF="104"/> <HI>Rome.</HI> The Temporal Lordship, Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> conferred upon <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, and he gave the same to <HI>John</HI> his younger Son, afterwards King of <HI>England,</HI> and so it returned home to the Crown.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third confirm∣ed the Gift of <HI>Adrian</HI> as in both their Charters is expressed at large.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Vivian</HI> the Legate on the Popes behalf did Accurse and Ex∣communicate all those that fell from the Obeysance of the Kings of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The Clergy twice Assembled, once at <HI>Cashell,</HI> secondly at <HI>Armagh,</HI> plainly determined the Conquest to be Lawful, and threatnad all peo∣ple, under pain of Gods, and holy Churches indignation, to accept of the <HI>English</HI> Kings for their Lords, from time to time.</P>
<P N="8">8. It would ask a Volume to recite the Name of such <HI>Irish</HI> Princes, who since the Conquest have continually, upon Occasions, Revolts, or Peti∣tions, sworn Truth and Faith to the Kings of <HI>England;</HI> and from time to time received Honors, Wages, Fees,
<PB N="177" REF="104"/> Pardons, and made Petitions. And thus I think no reasonable man will doubt of a Right so old, so continu∣ed, so ratified, and so many ways confessed.</P>
<P>The Kings Revenue in <HI>Ireland</HI> was spent and wholy exhausted in the publick service; and therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Revenue in <HI>Ireland</HI> wholy spent on that Kingdome.</NOTE> in all the ancient Pipe-Rolls in the times of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the First, <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, and <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, between the Receipts and Allowances, there is this entrie; <HI>In Thesauro nihil.</HI> For the Officers of the State and the Ar∣my, spent all; so, as there was no surplusage of Treasure; And here I may well take occasion, to shew the vanity of that which is reported in the Story of <HI>Walsingham,</HI> touching the Revenue of the Crown in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> which he saith did amount to thirty thousand Pounds a year, in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vain story of <HI>30000 l.</HI> yearly Re∣venue in <HI>E,</HI> 3ds time refuted.</NOTE></P>
<P>If this Writer had known, that the Kings Courts had been establish∣ed in <HI>Ireland</HI> more than a hundred years before King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third
<PB N="178" REF="105"/> was born, or had seen either the Parliament Rolls in <HI>England,</HI> or the Records of the Receits and Issues in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he had not left this vain re∣port to Posterity, for both the Ben∣ches and Exchequer were erected in the twelfth year of King <HI>John.</HI> And it is Recorded in the Parliament Rolls of 21. of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, remaining in the Tower, that the Commons of <HI>England</HI> made Petition that it might be enquired why the King received no benefit of his Land in <HI>Ireland,</HI> considering he possessed more there, than any of his Ancest∣ors had before him. Now, if the King at that time, when there were no standing Forces maintained there, had received thirty thousand pounds yearly at his Exchequer in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he must needs have made profit by that Land, considering that the whole charge of the Kingdome in the 47th year of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third (when the King did pay an Army there) did amount to no more than eleven thousand and two hundred pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> as appeareth by the Contract of <HI>William Winsore.</HI></P>
<PB N="179" REF="105"/>
<P>Besides it is manifest by the Pipe-Rolls of that time, whereof many are yet preserved in <HI>Breminghams</HI> Tower; and are of better credit than any Monks story, that during the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, the Revenue of the Crown of <HI>Ireland,</HI> both certain and casual, did not rise unto ten thousand pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> though the me∣dium be taken of the best seven years that are be found in that Kings time. The like Fable hath <HI>Holling∣shead,</HI> touching the Revenue of the Earldome of <HI>Ʋlster;</HI> which (saith he) in the time of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, was thirty thousand Marks by the year; Whereas in truth, though the Lordships of <HI>Connaght</HI> and <HI>Meath</HI> (which were then parcel of the Inheritance of the Earl of <HI>Ʋlster</HI>) be added to the Accompt, the Revenue of that Earldome came not to the third part of that he writeth. For the Accompt of the Profits of <HI>Ʋlster</HI> yet remaining in <HI>Breminghams</HI> Tower, made by <HI>Wil∣liam Fitz-Warren,</HI> Seneschall and Farmer of the Lands in <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> seized
<PB N="180" REF="106"/> into the Kings hands after the death of <HI>Walter de Burgo,</HI> Earl of <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> from the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, until the eighth year, do a∣mount but to nine hundred and odd pounds, at what time the <HI>Irishry</HI> had not made so great an invasion upon Earldome of <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> as they had done in the time of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>As vain a thing it is, that hath been seen written in an ancient Ma∣nuscript touching the Customes of <HI>Ireland</HI> in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, that those duties in those days should yearly amount to ten thousand Marks, which to search and view of the Records there, can justly be controlled. For upon the late reducing (about the beginning of King <HI>James</HI> his Reign) of this ancient Inheritance of the Crown which had been deteined in most of the Port Towns of that Realm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cu∣stoms of <HI>Ireland</HI> of little value till King <HI>James</HI> his Reign be∣ing but <HI>1000 l. per An.</HI></NOTE> for the space of one hundred years and upwards, some pains being taken to visit all the Pipe Rolls, wherein the Accompts of Customs are con∣teined, those duties were found to
<PB REF="106"/> be answered in every Port, for two hundred and fifty years together, but could not find that at any time they did exceed a thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI> and no marvel, for the Subsidy Poundage was not then known, and the greatest profit did arise by the Cocquet of Hides; for Wooll and Wooll-fells were ever of little value in that Kingdome till of late.</P>
<P>The Profit of the Custome-house in <HI>Ireland</HI> in the last year of King <HI>James</HI> his Reign did amount to thir∣ty thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cu∣stomes of <HI>Ireland</HI> advanced to <HI>30000 l. per An.</HI> in the last year of K. <HI>James</HI> his Reign.</NOTE> And what great improvements were made thereof by the Earl of <HI>Straf∣ford</HI> in the time of his Government, I cannot find, because they fell to∣gether with him; But what that branch of the Revenue now comes to, together with the rest paid year∣ly to his Majesties Exchequer in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> I shall here render a particular account of, (which at first view (considering that Countrey is not yet half Planted with People) may be much wondred at. But when I call to mind Sir <HI>Audley Mervyns</HI> ex∣pressions
<PB N="182" REF="107"/> (Speaker of the House of Commons in <HI>Ireland</HI>) delivered in a Speech of his to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> then Lord Lieute∣nant of that Kingdome, <HI>Feb.</HI> 13. 1662. being these, <HI>viz. That they did understand the usual proceedings of Parliaments, to begin at Grievances, and to conclude with Supplies:</HI> But that they had inverted that Order, by applying themselves in the first place to the settling a constant Re∣venue for his Majesty, and granting other Temporary Aides far above their Abilities, though far less than what his Majesties goodness might challenge from them; then the won∣der ceases; for as I have already ob∣serv'd, while the Popish <HI>Irish</HI> par∣ty bore sway in the Publick Assem∣blies of that Realm, they appeared averse, not only to contribute to∣wards the Publick Charge (unless up∣on their own Terms) though the occa∣sions were never so urgent, and they in a condition more able to discharge the same than now of late; But re∣pented themselves of those good Acts they had once consented to in this
<PB N="183" REF="107"/> kind: in order to his Majesties Ser∣vice, which they evidently expres∣sed by their forward accepting the abatement of the fore-mentioned Subsidies in the Earl of <HI>Straffords</HI> time, from forty thousand Pounds each Subsidy, to twelve thousand pounds a piece; An Act far diffe∣rent from the behaviour of those Loyal <HI>English</HI> hearts in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who contribu∣ted so freely to supply her Maje∣sties necessities in the Publick Con∣cern, as that sometimes she refused their kindnesses, accounting the Mo∣ney in the purses of her good Sub∣jects, to be as ready for her Service (when occasion required) as if they had been lock'd up in her own Coffers.</P>
<P>The particulars of his Majesties present Revenue in <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The parti∣culars of his Maje∣sties pre∣sent Reve∣nue in <HI>Ire∣land</HI> a∣mounting to <HI>219500</HI> l.</NOTE> accor∣ding the Demise made by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second to <HI>John Forth</HI> and his Partners by Indenture, bearing date <HI>July</HI> 12. 1669. are as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI> His Revenue arising by Hearth-Money, Licenses to Retail Wine, and Strong-Waters, the New Quit-Rents
<PB N="184" REF="108"/> given to his Majesty by the Acts of Setlement, and Explanati∣on; the Chief Rents, Fee Farm Rents, Rent-Service, Rent-Charge, Rents See, Rents reserved upon Leases exceeding one and twenty years, Copy hold, and all other an∣tient Crown Rents set for seven years, commencing at <HI>Christmas</HI> 1668. rendring yearly for the same, ninety one thousand and five hun∣dred Pounds. And his Majesties Re∣venue arising by Customes and im∣ported Excise; set for six years commencing at <HI>Christmas An.</HI> 1669. rendering yearly seventy five thou∣sand Pounds. And his Majesties Re∣venue arising by Inland Excise, and by Licenses to retaile Ale and Beer; set for four years and three quarters from <HI>March</HI> 25. 1671. rendering yearly fifty three thousand Pounds for the first four years, and thirty nine thousand seven hundred and fifty three thousand Pounds during the last three quarters; amounting in the whole yearly, to two hundred nineteen thousand five hundred Pounds. The Grant made to the
<PB N="185" REF="108"/> Lord <HI>Ranelagh</HI> of all the Revenue of <HI>Ireland,</HI> continues to <HI>Decemb.</HI> 26. 1675. So that by this we may see in part, what hopeful advantages are like in time to accrew to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> by having <HI>Ire∣land</HI> for the most part) inhabited by Protestant <HI>British</HI> Planters, whose Loyalty and Industry, will (I make no doubt) cause that Kingdome to become in a short time, a most flou∣rishing Countrey.</P>

For the first, they had in regard of their Knowledge in the Laws of the Land, very great reputation and trust, they now be∣gan to stand up like great Pa∣triots for the vindication of the liber∣ties of the Subject, and redress of
<PB N="207" REF="119"/> their pretended grievances:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Irish</HI> Lawyers drew a great party in the house of Com∣mons to adhere to them.</NOTE> and ha∣ving by their bold appearing there∣in, made a great party in the House of Commons then sitting at <HI>Dublin,</HI> some of them did there Magisteri∣ally obtrude, as undoubted maxims of Law, the pernicious speculations of their own brain; which though plainly discerned to the full virulen∣cy and tending to Sedition, yet so strangely were many of the Prote∣stants and well meaning men in the House blinded with an apprehension of ease and redress, and so stupified with their bold accusations of the Government, as most thought not fit, others durst not stand up to contradict their fond Assertions; so as what they spake was received with great acclamation, and much applause by most of the Protestant Members of the Hou e; many of which, under specious pretenses of publick Zeal to that that Countrey, they had inveigled into their party: And then it was, that having im∣peached Sir <HI>Richard Bolton,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>Ireland,</HI> of High Trea∣son, together with the prime Offi∣cers
<PB N="208" REF="120"/> and Ministers of State that were of <HI>English</HI> birth: some of those great Masters took upon them with much confidence to declare the Law, to make new Expositions of their own upon the Text, to frame their Queries, challenges fitter to be taken to a long, wilfully, overgrown misgovernment, than to be made a∣gainst an an Authority, that had for many years strugled against the be∣loved irregularities of a stubborne people, and which had prevailed far beyond former times, towards the allaying of the long continued distempers of the Kingdom: They disdained the moderate quallificati∣ons of the Judges, who gave them modest answers, such as the Law and duty to their Sovereign would admit. But those would not serve their turn, they resolved upon an alteration in the Government, and drawing of it wholly into the hands of the Natives, which they knew they could not compass in a Par∣liamentary way, and therefore only made preparatives there, and deli∣vered such desparate Maxims, which
<PB N="209" REF="120"/> being diffused abroad, would fit and dispose the people to a change: As they declared it to be Law, that being killed in Rebellion, though found by matter of Record, would give the King no forfeiture of E∣state; that though many thousands stood up in Arms in a Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Irish</HI> Lawyers offer'd to maintain absurd po∣sitions in point of Law, to promote the Rebellion <HI>An. 1641.</HI></NOTE> working all manner of destruction, yet if they professed not to rise a∣gainst the King, that it was no Re∣bellion: That if a man were Out∣law'd for Treason, and his land there∣by vested in the Crown, or given away by the King, his Heir might come afterwards and be admitted to reverse the Outlawry, and reco∣ver his Ancestors Estate. And many other positions of perilous conse∣quence, tending to sedition and di∣sturbance, did they continue to pub∣lish during that Session, and by the power and strength of their party, so far did they prevail at last, as they, presumed to attempt a sus∣pension of <HI>Poynings</HI> Act, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indeed intended the utter abrogation of that Statute, which remains as one of the greatest tyes and best monu∣ments
<PB N="210" REF="121"/> the <HI>English</HI> have of their en∣tire dominion over the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation, and the annexion of that Kingdom to the Imperial Crown of <HI>England</HI> They farther assumed power of Ju¦dicature to the Parliament in Crimi∣nal and Capital Offences: a Right which no former age hath left any president for, neither would this ad∣mit the Example.</P>
<P>And thus carrying all things before them, they continued the Session of Parliament begun in <HI>May,</HI> till about two months before the first break∣ing out of the last Rebellion; it be∣ing very ill taken, that then they were adjourned. And this they have since aggravated as a high Crime a∣gainst the Lords Justices, and as one of the chief moving causes to the ta∣king up of Arms generally, through∣out the Kingdome.</P>
<P>But to let these things pass, how finely soever these proceedings were carried on, and being covered over with pretences of Zeal and publick affection, passed then currant with∣out any manner of suspition; yet now the eyes of all men are open,
<PB N="211" REF="121"/> and they are fully resolved that all these passages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fair, but perni∣cious pre∣tences of the <HI>Irish</HI> fully disco∣vered by their Re∣bellion <HI>An. 1641.</HI></NOTE> together with the o∣ther high contestations in Parlia∣ment, not to have the newly raised <HI>Irish</HI> Army disbanded, the importu∣nate solicitation of their Agents in <HI>England,</HI> to have the old Army in <HI>Ireland</HI> cashiered, and the Kingdom left to be defended by the Trained Bands of their own Nation. As like∣wise the Commissions procured by several of the most eminent Com∣manders afterwards in Rebellion, for the raising men to carry into <HI>Spain,</HI> were all parts of the Plot, Prologues to the ensuing Tragedy; Preparatives, such as had been long laid to bring on the sodain executi∣on of that most bloudy design, all at one and the same time throughout the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now for the Jesuits, Priests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The means used by the Priests and Jesuits to stir up the people to Rebel.</NOTE> Fry∣ars all the rest of their Viperous Fra∣ternity belonging to their Holy Or∣ders; who, as I said, had a main part to Act, and did not fail with great assiduity and diligence to dis∣charge the same. They lost no time but most dexterously applyed them∣selves
<PB N="212" REF="122"/> in all parts of the Countrey to lay other such dangerous impressi∣ons in the minds, as well of the meaner sort, as of the chief Gentle∣men, as might make them ready to take fire upon the first occasion. And when this Plot was so surely, as they thought, laid, as it could not well faile, and the day once per∣fixed for Execution; they did in their publick Devotions long before, recommend by their Prayers, the good success of a great Design, much tending to the prosperity of the Kingdome, and the advancement of the Catholick Cause. And for the facilitating of the work, and stir∣ring up of the people with greater animosity and cruelty to put it on at the time perfixed; they loudly in all places declaimed against the Prote∣stants; telling the people that they were Hereticks, and not to be suf∣fered any longer to live among them; that it was no more sin to kill an <HI>English-man,</HI> than to kill a dog; and that it was a most mortal and unpardonable sin to relieve or pro∣tect any of them. Then also they
<PB N="213" REF="122"/> represented with much acrimony, the several courses taken by the Par∣liament in <HI>England,</HI> for suppressing of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion in all parts of of the Kingdom, and utter extirpa∣tion of all Professors of it. They told the people that in <HI>England</HI> they had caused the Queens Priest to be hang∣ed before her own face, and that they held her Majesty in her own person under a most severe disci∣pline: That the same cruel Laws a∣gainst Popery were ordered to be put suddenly in execution in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and a design secretly laid for bring∣ing and seizing upon all the princi∣pal Noble-men and Gentlemen in <HI>Ireland</HI> upon <HI>November</HI> 23. next en∣suing; and so to make a general Massacre of all that would not de∣sert their Religion and presently be∣come Protestants.</P>
<P>And now also did they take occa∣sion to revive their inveterate hatred and antient animosities against the <HI>English</HI> Nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Irish</HI> revive their antient a∣nimosities against the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> whom they repre∣sented to themselves as hard Masters, under whose Government, how pleasant; comfortable and advanta∣geous
<PB N="214" REF="123"/> so ever it was, they would have the world believe they had en∣dured a most miserable Captivity and Envassalage. They looked with much envy upon their prosperity, considering all the Land they pos∣sessed (though a great part bought at high rates of the Natives) as their own proper Inheritance. They grudged at the great multitudes of their fair <HI>English</HI> Cattel; at their goodly Houses, though built by their own industry at their own char∣ges; at the large improvements they made of their Estates, by their own travels and careful endeavours. They spake with much scorne and contempt of such as brought little with them into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and having there planted themselves, in a little time contracted great Fortunes. They were much troubled, especi∣ally in the <HI>Irish</HI> Countries, to see the <HI>English</HI> live handsomly, and to have every thing with much decency a∣bout them, while they lay nastily bu∣ried, as it were, in mire and filthiness, the ordinary sort of people common∣ly bringing their Cattle into their
<PB N="215" REF="123"/> own stinking Creates or Cabins, and there naturally delighting to lie amongst them. These malignant considerations made them with an envious eye impatiently to look up∣on all the <HI>British</HI> lately gone over in that Kingdome. Nothing less than a general extirpation would now serve their turn; they must have re∣stitution of all the Lands to the pro∣per Natives, whom they took to be the ancient Proprietors, and only true owners, most unjustly despoil∣ed by the <HI>English,</HI> whom they held to have made undue acquisitions of all the Land they possessed by gift from the Crown, upon attainder of any of their Ancestors.</P>
<P>And so impetuous were the desires of the Natives to draw the whole Government of the Kingdom into their own hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ends proposed by the first plotters of the Rebel∣lion.</NOTE> to enjoy the pub∣lick profession of their Religion, as well as disburthen the Countrey of all the <HI>British</HI> Inhabitants seated therein, as they made the whole body of the State to be universally disliked; represented the several Members as persons altogether cor∣rupt
<PB N="216" REF="124"/> and ill affected; pretended the ill humours and distempers in the Kingdome to be grown into that height as required Cauteries, deep incisions; and indeed nothing able to work so great a cure, but an uni∣versal Rebellion. This was certain∣ly the Disease, as appears by all the Symptoms, and the joynt concur∣rence in opinion of all the great Phy∣sicians that held themselves wise e∣nough to propose remedies, and prescribe fit applications to so de∣sparate a Malady. And thus we see those persons, who by the ad∣vantage of their Education, and duty of Profession, should have been the great lights to direct the foot∣steps of the unwary and giddy-head∣ed multitude, to walk steddily in the right path of Obedience and Loyalty to their Prince, and of Love and Charity towards their Neigh∣bours, by a notorious abuse of the same, did wilfully mislead them to ruine and destruction.</P>

<PB N="220" REF="126"/> difficult War. This puts me in mind of another like passage I have read in a discription of <HI>Novum Belgium,</HI> or <HI>New Netherland</HI> in <HI>America</HI> (now called <HI>New-Yorke</HI>) where relating the story how upon complaint made by King <HI>Charles</HI> the first to the States of <HI>Holland</HI> (a little before the last un∣happy Civil Wars in <HI>England</HI>) of some of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> incroaching upon some parts of his Territories in <HI>Virginia,</HI> then called <HI>New-Neder∣land</HI> (but now <HI>New-Yorke</HI>) the States having by publick Instrument utterly disclaimed any pretensions thereunto, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> then in∣habiting there, did seem willing to be gone, and leave all they had there for the sum of two thousand five hundred pounds, yet taking advan∣tage of the trouble which not long after followed in <HI>England;</HI> they not only raised their demands to a great∣er height; but furnished the Native <HI>Indians</HI> with Arms, and taught them how to use their Weapons. A most mischievous and wicked act, not only tending to the dammage, and discouragement of the then present
<PB N="221" REF="126" MS="y"/> Adventurers, but even to the Ex∣tirpation of all the Christians out of those Countries. But the best was, they were the first that smarted by it, the Savages thus Armed and Trained, fell foul upon them, de∣stroying their Farm-houses, and for∣cing them to betake themselves to their Forts, and Fortresses. How far the application of this Story may fit the Subject in hand as the matter stands in controversie, between the Protestant party, and Papists in <HI>Ireland,</HI> I refer to the consideration of the judicious Reader.</P>
<P>The manner of Electing Parlia∣ment Men in this Kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Election.</NOTE> is the same with that in <HI>England,</HI> but the Acts are drawn up and pass'd diffe∣rently, as also those in <HI>Scotland</HI> where the Lords of the Articles, af∣ter the Parliament is met, prepare the Bills, but here the Lord Lieute∣nant and Councel usually draw up such Bills as they think fit, and transmit them to his Majesty, and Councel in <HI>England,</HI> where they come under a new Debate, and if approved, returned back under
<PB N="222" REF="127"/> the Great Seal to the Lord Lieute∣nant, who offers them to the Par∣liament. Each House may reject them, or else must consent to them <HI>in terminis</HI> without any alteration. When any Bills are thus by both Houses agreed to, then they are presented to the Lord Lieutenant who gives the Royal Assent. The Law whereby the Houses are not trusted with the framing of their own Bills, is called <HI>Poynings</HI> Law, of which look back to <HI>page</HI> 106.</P>

<SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Ow much it concerns the future well-fare and security of the Protestant <HI>British</HI> Planters, to be for the most part, if not who∣ly possessed (by way of Habitation) of the chief Cities and strong Towns of <HI>Ireland,</HI> doth very evidently appear by these two Examples, which may serve as sufficient Instances for all the rest; <HI>viz.</HI> That of the City of <HI>Dublin;</HI> And the other, those of <HI>Limrick,</HI> and <HI>Gal∣laway.</HI> As for <HI>Dublin,</HI> though it ow∣ed
<PB N="249" REF="140"/> its whole being (upon the matter) and especially the sole cause of its late flourishing state and condition, to the constant residency of the Lords Lieute∣nants, and Lords Deputies of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the four Courts of Judicature there; yet so ungrateful were the Popish <HI>Irish</HI> party therein, and so little sensible of their own good; as that when the Lords Commissioners (upon the first discovery of the Conspiracy in <HI>October 1641.</HI>) having happily provided for the security of the Castle of <HI>Dublin;</HI> Their Lords took next into their care how to secure the City in some sort against any sudden attempts, which proved a work not easie to be effected; not only in regard of the crasiness of the Walls, the large Su∣burbs and weakness of the place; but much more in respect of the corrupt ill af∣fection of the Popish <HI>Irish</HI> Inhabitants within the City: who for the most part were so strangely deluded with the ill in∣fusions of their Priests, as they did cer∣tainly (as was found afterwards by wo∣ful experience) do all that in them lay, to promote the Rebellious designs then set on foot (as they believed) only for the re-settlment of their Religion, and
<PB N="250" REF="141"/> recovery of their Liberties. They were the Instruments to convey away privat∣ly most of the chief Conspirators, who would have surprised the Castle on the 23d of <HI>October.</HI> They secretly enter∣tained many of the Rebels that came out of the Country, they likewise sent them relief that were abroad, by secret ways; conveying as well Ammunition, as intelligence of all passages from thence. And such wrong aversions had they a∣gainst all Contributions for the mainte∣nance of his Majesties Army; as in the very beginning of the Rebellion, when the Lords sent for the Mayor and Al∣dermen, and laying before them the high necessities of the State, together with the apparan danger of the City and Kingdom, desired to borrow a considera∣ble sum of money for the present, which they undertook to repay out of the next Treasure that should arive out of <HI>England.</HI> The Popish party amongst them was so prevalent, as that after a most serious consultation &amp; very solemn debate among themselves, they most impudently return∣ed this answer, that they were not able to furnish above forty pounds, and part of that was to be brought in in Cattle:
<PB N="251" REF="141"/> And when in the heighth of the distracti∣ons there were no fortifications about the Suburbs, nor any manner of defence for the City, but an old ruinous Wall, part whereof fell down about that very time; so careless were the Citizens, and so slowly went they about the making up that breach, as that under pretence of want of money, they let it lie open till the Lords sent unto them forty pounds to∣wards the reparation.</P>
<P>As for those of <HI>Limrick</HI> and <HI>Galla∣way,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And those of <HI>Lymrick</HI> &amp; <HI>Gallaway.</HI></NOTE> they had no less obligations laid upon them by the State of <HI>England,</HI> un∣der whose prosperous and benigne Go∣vernment, they flourished (during the last forty years peace) in such an ex∣traordinary manner (witness those ma∣ny stately Buildings erected, and vast Estates acquired by their Citizens du∣ring the said time) as neither they, nor any of their Ancestors did ever hope to enjoy, or expect to ever see the like: who by reason of the foule dealings of their neighbour country men, were (till of late times) at such perpetual enmity with them, as that they never trusted them (as the old saying is) <HI>No farther than they could see them;</HI> and for
<PB N="252" REF="142"/> this cause continually intermarried a∣mongst themselves, and so became (as it were) of one Kindred and Relation through each Town; all being compre∣hended under a very few Sir names. But surfeiting with too much prospe∣rity, and trusting too much to their own strength, they declared themselves at last, as rank Rebels as any of the rest of their Country-men; for though by reason of the miscarriage of the maine plot of surprizing <HI>Dublin</HI> Castle, it made them at first to stand at a gaze, were put to take up second Counsels; yet, (which seems miraculous) notwith∣standing they saw the power of the Nor∣thern Rebels begin to decline, and that the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> had with great alacrity and readiness undertaken the War, and not only engaged them∣selves to his Majesty to send over power∣ful supplies both out of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land,</HI> but by their publick order of both Houses, sent over to the Lords Ju∣stices, and Printed at <HI>Dublin</HI> in the month of <HI>November,</HI> fully declared their resolutions for the vigorous prose∣cution of the War of <HI>Ireland;</HI> And that some Forces were arrived at <HI>Dublin</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="142"/> out of <HI>England,</HI> the Siege of <HI>Droge∣dah</HI> or <HI>Tredagh</HI> raised, those bold perfidious Traitors beaten back into the North, the Lords of the Pale ba∣nished by force of his Majesties Armies, of their own Habitations, which were all spoiled and laid waste; yet I say, Such was the strength of the Conspiracy, and so deeply were they engaged in it, as that <HI>Limrick</HI> and <HI>Gallaway</HI> did open∣ly declare themselves for the Rebels; The one, by besieging the <HI>English</HI> (who had betaken themselves for protection) in the Castle of <HI>Limrick;</HI> And the other, those who had (upon the like score) pos∣sessed themselves of the Fort of <HI>Galla∣way;</HI> both being at last forced to yeild for want of timely relief; by means whereof many thousands of the <HI>English</HI> were exposed to the slaughter of their barbarous Enemies, in a great part of the Provinces of <HI>Connaght, Leinster</HI> and <HI>Munster,</HI> which otherwise might have been wholy preserved from ruine, if these two Towns alone (which are ad∣mirable for their strength and situation) had but cheerfully opened their Gates to the destressed, and firmly continued in their ancient Loyalty to the Crown of
<PB N="254" REF="143"/> <HI>England;</HI> But seeing they so wilfully acted this mad part by the powerful ad∣vice of their Popish Priests and Lawyers (wherewith they did at that time migh∣tily abound) having then but a very in∣considerable number of Protestant Fa∣milies to bear any sway amongst them; I shall therefore conclude, that next to a good Standing Army, the most infallible way (under God) to secure both the Government and the <HI>British</HI> Planters in <HI>Ireland,</HI> is to have the chief Towns and Fortresses thereof, for the most part (if not altogether) Inhabited by Prote∣stant Families; A brief Character of the principal of which, are here present∣ed to your view and consideration, in hopes that many more (well worthy of notice) will shortly be added to this number, by such ingenious persons as are throughly acquainted with, and well affected to that Country.</P>

<PB N="266" REF="151"/> the <HI>British</HI> Planters in the adjacent Counties, the Countey of <HI>Letrim</HI> being one of the strongest Fastnesses, by reason it overmuch abounds with Boggs and Woods, fit places for Rebels to shelter themselves in, of any one County in <HI>Ireland;</HI> And bor∣dering upon the Province of <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> being formerly the very Nest for them, caused it to be too often frequented by those kind of unhap∣py Creatures.</P>

It took the name <HI>Droghedah</HI> from the Bridge there built upon the River for the con∣veniency of passage (as the word signifieth in that Language) and therefore called <HI>Pontena</HI> by some <HI>La∣tine</HI> Writers.</P>
<P><HI>Dublin</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dublin.</NOTE> supposed to be the <HI>Ebla∣na</HI> of <HI>Ptolomie;</HI> by the <HI>Irish</HI> called <HI>Balacleigh,</HI> because being seated in a fenny and moorish Soil, it was built on Piles as the word doth signi∣fie in that Language: Situate at or neer the mouth of the River <HI>Liffe,</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="154"/> which affordeth it a commodious Haven, but that the entrances thereof are many times encumbred with heaps of Sand. The City ve∣ry Rich and Populous, as being the Metropolis of all the Island, the Seat of the Lord Deputy, an Arch-bishops See, and an Uni∣versity, besides the benefit redoun∣ding from the Courts of Justice. In those respects well fortified a∣gainst all emergencies; and adorn∣ed with many goodly Buildings both private and publick. The Principal of which, are the Castle, wherein the Lord Deputy resideth, built by <HI>Henry Loundres</HI> once once Arch-Bishop here; a Col∣ledge founded by Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> to the honor, and by the name of the Blessed <HI>Trinity;</HI> The Cathedral Church dedicated to Saint <HI>Patrick,</HI> the Apostle of the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation; a fair Collegiate Church called <HI>Christ-Church;</HI> be∣sides thirteen others destinated to Parochial Meetings. Being destroy∣ed almost to nothing in the <HI>Da∣nish</HI> War, it was re-edified by
<PB N="274" REF="155"/> <HI>Harald,</HI> sirnamed <HI>Harfarger,</HI> King of the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> then Masters of most part of the Island; and after the subjection of it to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> was peopled with a Colonie of <HI>Bristol</HI> men.</P>
<P>This may be farther observed, that though <HI>Dublin</HI> is not seated in the best and most convenient place, that is in the middle, yet it is seated in the second best, that is, over against the middle of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and directly opposite to the neerest passage into <HI>England,</HI> being <HI>Holy Head,</HI> twelve hours Saile with a prosperous Gale of Wind, and about twenty Leagues distance from this place. The first affords it an excellent conveniency for all manner of businesses to be trans∣acted to and from this City (as well by Water as Land) into all parts of the Kingdome, with as little charge as possibly may be. The other, a rare advantage for the maintenance of Traffick and Commerce with <HI>England,</HI> and all other parts of the World, especi∣ally with the City of London, from
<PB N="275" REF="155"/> whence (upon the least notice given) Merchantable Goods of all kinds are soon dispatched hither, or into any other parts of this Realm, as occasion requires; And that with far more speed than formerly, by reason of the late e∣recting of Post-houses in all the principal Towns and Cities of this Kingdome, which accommodates all persons with the conveniency of keeping good correspondency (by way of Letters, and that most commonly twice a week) with any, even the remotest part of <HI>Ireland,</HI> at the charge of eight pence or twelve pence, which could not formerly be brought to pass under ten or twenty shillings, and that sometimes with so slow a dispatch, as gave occasion ma∣ny times of no small prejudice to the parties concern'd. All these conveniencies and advantages have so far contributed to the present splendor and great increase of this City, as that it now may be justly con∣ceived to be grown (within this fifty or sixty years) twice as large, and
<PB N="276" REF="156"/> for handsomness of Building, be∣yond all compare, of what it might any way pretend unto in any former Age.</P>
<P><HI>Dublin</HI> thus wholy deriving her present lustre and happiness from the late prosperous Settlement of <HI>Ireland</HI> under the <HI>English</HI> Govern∣ment, being but a very mean and inconsiderable <HI>Metropolis</HI> for so No∣ble a Kingdom, during the long continued misgovernment of that Realm, bares in some particu∣lars somewhat a like resemblance with that of the City of <HI>London;</HI> Which, first, since quitting our selves from our expensive Relation and Correspondency with the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> The declining of our unprofitable Contests with <HI>France;</HI> The Reducing of <HI>Ireland</HI> to an Orderly Common-wealth; And last of all by the happy Union of the two Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Person of King <HI>James</HI> of blessed memory, thereby succesfully affording us a veny fit opportunity of turning the cur∣re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of all our vast former expen∣ces
<PB N="277" REF="156"/> both of Blood and Treasure, into the honorable, and profitable undertaking of a gallant Trade with both the <HI>Indies,</HI> and many other parts of the World; But especially by planting of already very considerable Colonies in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> hath grown, since the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign till this present (being a∣bout an hundred and twelve years) to be twice as large, and much more beautiful then ever it was, since the first foundation thereof, being some two thousand five hun∣dred years agoe.</P>
<P>It is therefore well observed; That there is required to the Mag∣nificence and Splendor of Cities; First a Navigable River, or some such easie passage by Sea, which will bring thither a continual Concourse and Trade of Mer∣chants; as at <HI>Venice, London, Amsterdam.</HI> Secondly, some Sta∣ple-Manufactories and Commodi∣ties which will draw the like re∣sort of Merchants, though the con∣veniency of Sea or Rivers invite
<PB N="278" REF="157"/> them not; As at <HI>Newremberge</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> a drie Town, but migh∣tily Traded. Thirdly, the Palace of the Prince; for <HI>ubi Imperator, ibi Roma,</HI> where the Court is, there will be a continual conflu∣ence, of Nobles, Gentry and Mer∣chants, and all sorts of Trades: And by this means <HI>Madrid</HI> not long since a poor and beggerly Village, is grown the most popu∣lous City in all <HI>Spain.</HI> Fourthly, the residence of the Nobility beau∣tifieth a City with Stately, and Magnificent Buildings; which makes the Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> so much excel our in <HI>England,</HI> their Nobles dwelling in the Cities, and ours for the most part in their Coun∣try-Houses. Fiftly, the Seats or Tribunals of Justice, on which both Advocates and Clients are to give attendance; as in the Parlia∣mentary Cities in <HI>France,</HI> and in <HI>Spires</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI> Sixthly, Uni∣versities and Schools of Learning, to which the Youth from all parts are to make resort; which hath been long the chief cause of the
<PB N="279" REF="157"/> flourishing of <HI>Oxford, Cambridge, Bononia</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and other Cities of good Note beyond the Seas. Seventhly, Immunity from Tolls and Taxes, most men being desi∣rous to inhabite there, where their Income will be greatest, their Pri∣viledges largest, and their disburs∣ments least: So <HI>Naples, Venice, Flo∣rence</HI> having been dessolated by Plagues, were again suddenly re-peopled by granting large Immu∣nities to all comers in; All which Requisites, are (as I conceive) inherent and inseparable in, and to the above mentioned two Ci∣ties, to wit, <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Dublin</HI> in times past, for the due Administration of Civil Government, had a Pro∣vost for the Chief Magistrate: But in the year of Mans Redemption, 1409. King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth granted them liberty to Elect eve∣ry year a Mayor and two Bay∣liffs, and that the Mayor should have a guilt Sword carried before him for ever. And <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth (to heap more honour up∣on
<PB N="280" REF="158"/> this place) changed the two Bayliffs afterwards into Sheriffs: And of late, our Gracious Sove∣reign King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, ho∣nored this City with a Lord Mayor; So that there is nothing wanting here that may serve to make the State of a City most magnificent and flourishing.</P>
