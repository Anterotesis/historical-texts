<HEAD>THE Present State OF HUNGARY: OR An Historical, and Geographical Description of that Kingdom.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of its Names, Bounds, Division, Ri∣vers, Lakes and Mountains.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> belonging by Right to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> but, in a great part, invaded and
<PB N="2" REF="4"/> usurped by the <HI>Turks,</HI> lies betwixt the 39. and 47. degree of Longitude, and from the 45. to the 49. of North Lati∣tude, or thereabouts: It is part of the Ancient <HI>Pannonia,</HI> called <HI>Magiar</HI> by the <HI>Turks; Wegierska,</HI> by the <HI>Sclavoni∣ans; Hungerland,</HI> by the <HI>Germans; On∣garia,</HI> by the <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards; Hongrie,</HI> by the <HI>French;</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The Bounds of it are <HI>Transilvania</HI> to the East; <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Russia</HI> to the North; <HI>Moravia, Austria</HI> and <HI>Styria</HI> to the West; and <HI>Servia</HI> and <HI>Bosnia</HI> to the South.</P>
<P>The Figure of this Kingdom is square, its Corners looking to the four parts of the World.</P>
<P>It is divided into the Upper and Lower <HI>Hungary;</HI> the Upper is on the side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> towards <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Transilvania;</HI> and the Lower on the other side of the same River.</P>
<P>Heretofore it contained above Sea∣venty Counties, but at present it has only about fifty; whereof before this last War Twenty six were subject to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Tyranny. It may be also divided into the part held by the Em∣perour,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/> and that which is under the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominion.</P>
<P>Its chief Rivers are, the <HI>Raab,</HI> the <HI>Wag,</HI> the <HI>Gran,</HI> the <HI>Teisse,</HI> the <HI>Sarvilise,</HI> which comes out of the lake <HI>Balathon,</HI> and the <HI>Donau.</HI> The less considerable are the <HI>Newsidl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, Reckzkerle,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P>The highest Mountains of <HI>Hungary</HI> are the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Mountains, towards <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Transilvania.</HI> The richest are betwixt <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Strigonium,</HI> which have Mines affording excellent Mettals, and especially Quick-silver.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of the Country of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and its Inhabitants.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Air of this Country is un∣wholesom, and especially to Stran∣gers; and it is observed to engender a great deal of Vermine. The Waters, excepting that of the <HI>Danube,</HI> are not good, and the Author <HI>de Mirabilibus Hungariae</HI> observes, that there are Foun∣tains
<PB N="4" REF="5"/> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> whose Waters are Poysonous, which increase and dimi∣nish with the Moon, and are quite dried up when that Luminary is in the Full. There are other Fountains in it also, that turn into Stone any thing that is cast into them; others which are hot in Winter, and freeze in Sum¦mer; and others whose Waters are sowrish, salt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also several Mines of Salt, Gold, Sil¦ver, Copper, Steel and Iron. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Soil is very fruitful, in so much, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some have thought, that <HI>Hungary</HI> alone was sufficient to furnish all <HI>Europe</HI> with Corn. Its Pasturages are wonderful and so great is the plenty of Wild Beasts and Fowl, of Fish and Cattle that the Country People live for mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part on the Flesh of Wild Boars an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Venison. An hundred Carps hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been sold there for a <HI>Noble;</HI> and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath been observed, that in one yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above Fourscore thousand Oxen hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been brought from thence into <HI>Germa¦ny.</HI> The <HI>Hungarians</HI> are Warlike, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cruel, proud, revengeful, and so i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> united together, that it is no wonde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they have been a Prey to the <HI>Barbar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ans.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/> They speak several Languages, and especially <HI>Latin,</HI> which is very familiar to them; the Gentry are magnificent, and all great Lovers of Horses, Hunting and good Chear. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> love not the <HI>Germans;</HI> yet the Nobility adhere to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> to secure themselves from the Oppression of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who va∣lue a Peasant as much as a Gentleman. The strength of the Country consists in light Horse-Men. The Troopers there are called <HI>Hussars,</HI> and the Foot <HI>Heydukes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of the Princes and Nations, who have made any Progress in <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE first of the <HI>Romans</HI> that made any Progress in <HI>Hungary</HI> was <HI>Julius Coesar,</HI> other Captains con∣tinued them after him, untill the time of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> who entirely subjected that Kingdom. Afterwards upon the Fall of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the <HI>Goths</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/> seiz'd it, and that Kingdom became Prey to the <HI>Huns</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> who were driven out by the former in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eighth Century. For certain crue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People of <HI>Scythia,</HI> called <HI>Hongres,</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lived only on Blood, possessed them selves of all that Country, which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present we call <HI>Hungary.</HI> They who treat of <HI>Hungary,</HI> reckon <HI>Balamir</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Balamber</HI> amongst the Kings of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Countrey; he reigned fifty six years and had a Son <HI>Mundsur</HI> or <HI>Mundiaque</HI> who died before his Father. <HI>Aptar</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also reckoned amongst those Kings and the two Brothers, <HI>Bleda,</HI> killed in the Year, 444. and <HI>Attila,</HI> called the Scourge of God, who died in the year 453. His Children made a cruel Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against one another, and lost the Con¦quests of their Father. The <HI>Huns</HI> made another Irruption into <HI>Pannonia,</HI> about the Year 744. under the Conduct o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one named <HI>Amie,</HI> who had <HI>Arphad</HI> for his Successor. These gave the name to <HI>Hungary. Sultan,</HI> one of the issue of that <HI>Arphad,</HI> was, as it is said, the Father of <HI>Toxa</HI> or <HI>Toxis,</HI> and this Man begot <HI>Geiza,</HI> the Father of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> with whom I shall begin the Chrono∣logical
<PB N="7" REF="6"/> Succession of the Kings of <HI>Hun∣gary.</HI> He was Crowned in the year, 1000. or 1020. according to others. Since that time the <HI>Hungarians</HI> had Kings, who governed them peaceably▪ enough, until after the Death of <HI>Loüis,</HI> called the Great, whose Daughter and Heiress <HI>Marie</HI> was Married to the Em∣perour <HI>Sigismond</HI> of <HI>Luxemburg;</HI> but his Government displeasing them, they called in <HI>Charles de Duras</HI> King of <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> and <HI>Stephen,</HI> Vaivod of <HI>Transilva∣nia,</HI> who had his recourse to <HI>Bajazet</HI> the First, Emperour of the <HI>Turks;</HI> from thence began the Miseries of that Kingdom, which since the year 1394. hath been always almost the seat of War, and became a Prey to the <HI>Turks;</HI> and especially under <HI>Amurath, Solyman,</HI> and others. The Kingdom of <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> is partly possessed by the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and partly by the <HI>Infidels.</HI> The former rendred it Hereditary af∣ter the Death of <HI>Loüis</HI> the Young, who perished at the Battle of <HI>Mohacs,</HI> in the year 1526. <HI>John de Zapol,</HI> Count of <HI>Scepua,</HI> was saluted King by part of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> by the rest, who carried it
<PB N="8" REF="7"/> from his Competitor. The Estates of this Kingdom are divided into four Bodies. 1. The Clergy. 2. The Ba∣rons. 3. The Nobles. 4. The Roy∣al and Free Towns. The Religion of it is divided, and the Manners of the People odd. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> were converted to the Faith by <HI>Gisle</HI> Sister to St. <HI>Henry,</HI> who married their King St. <HI>Stephen.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PRESBOURG.</HEAD>
<P>This Town lies upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> and is the Capital City of the <HI>Upper Hungary,</HI> and of all that belongs to the Emperor within that Kingdom.

<P>Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the Fifth being inform∣ed that the <HI>Hungarians</HI> were in Arms, and would not submit to <HI>Charles Mar∣tel,</HI> Son to <HI>Charles</HI> II. King of <HI>Naples,</HI> thought himself obliged to send a Le∣gat thither, either for composing these Disorders, or strengthening the Party of the Lawful Soveraign. For that effect he pitched upon <HI>Gentil de Monteffiore,</HI> whose Merit had raised him from a Franciscan Frier to the Dignity of a Cardinal, and who ac∣quitted
<PB N="14" REF="10"/> himself extraordinarily well in his Commission. At first he used all ways of Mildness; but finding them to be unprofitable, he employed Ec∣clesiastical Censures, and reclaimed the <HI>Hungarians</HI> to their Duty. He ce∣lebrated a Council at <HI>Presbourg,</HI> in the year 1309. Where sound Cannons were made; which were afterwards approved by the Pope. In this Town there are a great many Houses built after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, which con∣tribute much to the Beauty thereof.</P>

<P>This Town by the <HI>Germans</HI> is cal∣led, <HI>Eger,</HI> and by the <HI>Hungarians, Er∣law,</HI> lying upon a River of the same Name: It is but a small place, hut ex∣traordinarily well fortified, and hath always been the Seat of a Bishop, Suf∣fragan to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Strigoni∣um,</HI> and the Bulwark of Christendom, and therefore it was Besieged, but in vain, by the Army of <HI>Solyman:</HI> But at length, <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Third carried it the 12. of <HI>October,</HI> 1596. Since that time it hath been in the hands of the
<PB N="18" REF="12"/> <HI>Turks,</HI> who keep a strong Garison in it. Three Leagues from this Town the River of <HI>Agria</HI> falls into the <HI>Tyssa</HI> or <HI>Teisse,</HI> which is the <HI>Tibiscus</HI> of the Latins. In the year 1552. the <HI>Turks</HI> first besieged <HI>Agria,</HI> with an Army of Threescore and ten thousand Men. It was then no strong place, neither by Nature nor Art; and yet the Cou∣rage of the Garison supplied the Weak∣ness of the place. There were within it Two thousand <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and Three∣score of the chief Gentlemen of the Country, who brought thither their Wives, Children, and all their Goods. They all took an Oath, that they would suffer the utmost Extremity, ra∣ther than render the place; they put all their Provision into publick stores, and when the <HI>Turks</HI> summoned them to render the place, they put out a Cof∣fin upon the Battlements of the Walls, to shew that they had resolved to die, rather than to yield. The Town was for Forty days time incessantly Batter∣ed with Fifty pieces of Cannon; but all that daunted not the Besieged. Nay the <HI>Turks</HI> having made three Assaults in one day, were still beaten off, and
<PB N="19" REF="12"/> lost Eight thousand men. Above all things the Valour of the Women was conspicious in so bloody an Action. One of them was fighting in presence of her Mother and Husband, who was killed hard by her, and her Mother bidding her carry off the Body and Bury it: God forbid, answered she, that I should Bury my Husband be∣fore I revenge his death: and with that snatching up the Buckler and Sword of her dead Husband, she threw her self into the midst of the Enemy's, and left not off Fighting till she had revenged the death of her Husband by the slaughter of three <HI>Turks.</HI> Ano∣ther Woman carrying a great stone to cast down upon the Enemy, was shot with a Canon Bullet, that carried off her head. Her Daughter who fol∣lowed her, without standing to be∣wail her loss, took up the stone, and all bloody as it was with her Mo∣thers Blood, threw it down upon a croud of the Enemy, who endeavour∣ed to mount the Wall. The <HI>Turks</HI> be∣ing Witnesses of such obstinate Reso∣lution, raised the Siege the Nineteenth of <HI>October;</HI> and the Besieged sallying

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of the Towns of Lower <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BUDA.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore the <HI>Turks</HI> invaded <HI>Hungary,</HI> the City of <HI>Buda</HI> was the <HI>Metro∣polis</HI> of the Kingdom; the Ancients called it <HI>Curta,</HI> and the <HI>Germans Offen.</HI></P>
<P>It is divided into the Upper and Lower Town, lying upon the side of a Hill, the Foot whereof is washed by the <HI>Danube,</HI> which at that place is a∣bove half a mile over: It hath a Bridge of Boats over it, that joins the City of <HI>Buda,</HI> to the little Town of <HI>Pest,</HI> ly∣ing on the opposite side. In <HI>Buda</HI> are to be seen the Ruines of several stately Palaces, built heretofore by <HI>Matthias Corvinus</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and his Predecessours; which the <HI>Turks</HI> neg∣lect, and let fall into decay.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="22"/>
<P>This is a large, fair, and well built Town, but ill peopled, and hath hard∣ly any Inhabitants, but the <HI>Spahies</HI> and <HI>Janisaries</HI> of the Garrison, which is al∣ways very numerous.</P>
<P>After the Death of <HI>John Zapol,</HI> Count of <HI>Scepus</HI> and <HI>Elba</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> his Widow <HI>Elisabeth</HI> of <HI>Po∣land</HI> and his Son <HI>Stephen,</HI> called in the <HI>Turks</HI> to their Assistance, against <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> who was elected King. The <HI>Germans</HI> besieged <HI>Buda,</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> having defeated them, made themselves Masters of the Town under pretext of Friendship, sending the Queen, her Son, and <HI>George Martinisius,</HI> who had been chief Minister to the late King, into <HI>Transilvania.</HI></P>
<P>This Town is the Residence of a <HI>Beglerbey,</HI> whose Authority extends o∣ver twenty <HI>Sangiacks.</HI> The <HI>Bassa</HI> of <HI>Buda</HI> hath more Authority than the others have, and the Garrison consists commonly of eight or ten Thousand Men. Some take it to be the <HI>Curta</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> and others for the <HI>Aguincum</HI> of the Itinerary of <HI>Antonine.</HI> It is ve∣ry hard to be positive as to that, and all that can be said are but Conje∣ctures.
<PB N="40" REF="23"/> But it is a Fable, that the Brother of <HI>Attila</HI> built it, and called it by his Name <HI>Budaeus:</HI> For that Bro∣ther of <HI>Attila</HI> was named <HI>Bleda,</HI> and not <HI>Budaeus,</HI> as the Fabulous pretend.</P>
<P><HI>Solyman</HI> rendered himself Master of <HI>Buda</HI> the 20eth. of <HI>August,</HI> 1526. and in the year 1527. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> I. King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> Brother to the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> V. after the overthrow of <HI>Loüis</HI> the Young, in the Plain of <HI>Mohacz,</HI> was proclaimed King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> by <HI>Stephen Bathori</HI> Palatin of the Kingdom, and by the sounder part of the Nobi∣lity; <HI>John Zapoliha,</HI> Vaivod of <HI>Tran∣silvania,</HI> having been before tumultua∣rily elected by the rest.</P>
<P>The same year, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> made himselt Master of the greatest part of the Kingdom, and of <HI>Buda</HI> the Capi∣tal City, of which he made <HI>Thomas Nadasti</HI> Governour; until the year 1529. that <HI>Solyman</HI> took it by the Trea∣chery of the Garrison, and shortly af∣ter laid siege to <HI>Vienna,</HI> which he was forced shamefully to raise, after he had made many B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oody Assaults.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="23"/>
<P>From whence, retreating to <HI>Buda,</HI> he re-established <HI>John</HI> Vaivod of <HI>Tran∣silvania</HI> in the Kingdom; having left in <HI>Buda, Gritti,</HI> a Renegado, with three Thousand <HI>Janisaries,</HI> to defend it in Name of the Vaivod.</P>
<P>Afterwards <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> made General <HI>Rogendorf</HI> besiege it, in the year 1530. but in vain.</P>
<P>In the year 1540. he commanded his General <HI>Leonard Fessius</HI> to Besiege it a second time, having first possest himself of the Forts of <HI>Vicegrad, Vac∣cia,</HI> and <HI>Pest;</HI> and <HI>John Zapoliha</HI> be∣ing dead the year before, who left for his Successor <HI>John Sigismond,</HI> a Pupil under the tuition of the Princess <HI>Isabel</HI> his Mother, and <HI>George Monck;</HI> but <HI>Fessius</HI> having there endured the fati∣gues of a long and troublesom Siege, was again obliged to draw off.</P>
<P>In the year, 1541. General <HI>Rogen∣dorf</HI> renewed the Siege again a Third time; but upon the coming of <HI>Soly∣man,</HI> he thought it best to retreat. In the mean time that <HI>Ottoman</HI> Prince surprised the Town by Cunning, drove the young Prince and his Mother out of it, and sent them to Reign in <HI>Tran∣silvania,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="24"/> publishing that he would keep it until <HI>John Sigismond,</HI> the Son of <HI>John Zapoliha</HI> the Usurper, were of Age.</P>
<P>In the year, 1542. the Marquess of <HI>Brandebourgh,</HI> made as if he intended to Besiege <HI>Buda,</HI> and in that design marched towards it. He attacked <HI>Pest,</HI> on his march, but in vain, and retreated without any success.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Swartzenbourgh</HI> ha∣ing in the Month of <HI>March</HI> 1598. by a Wonderful Stratagem retaken <HI>Java∣rin,</HI> or <HI>Raab,</HI> from the <HI>Turks,</HI> marched the same year in the Month of <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI> under the Auspices of the Arch∣duke <HI>Matthias,</HI> and laid Siege to <HI>Buda,</HI> which after thirty days Attack he was forced to raise, because of the conti∣nual Rains: And it is remarkable, that the <HI>Turks,</HI> who at the same time Besieged the Town of <HI>Waradin</HI> in <HI>Tran∣silvania,</HI> were likewise obliged to quit their Enterprise for the same Rea∣son.</P>
<P>The Christians again attacked that Town in the year 1602 under General <HI>Roswurm,</HI> but having ruined the Bridge ever the <HI>Danube,</HI> and pos∣sessed
<PB N="43" REF="24"/> the Town of <HI>Pest,</HI> the Rigour of the Season obliged them to desist from their Design.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> Generalissimo of the Imperial Armies, attempted the Siege of the same place, having first made himself Master of the Castle of <HI>Vicegrad, Vaccia</HI> and <HI>Pest,</HI> and thrice defeated the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army; but the Season being too far advanced, that he might not endanger the Army, he thought it convenient to raise the Siege in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> 1684.</P>

<P>A very strong Town situated where the Rivers of <HI>Raab</HI> and <HI>Rabuits,</HI> fall into the <HI>Danube,</HI> is the Seat of a Bishop Suffragan to <HI>Gran,</HI> or <HI>Strigoni∣um.</HI> The <HI>Germans</HI> call it <HI>Raab,</HI> the <HI>French Javarin,</HI> the <HI>Hungarians Gever,</HI> the <HI>Italians Giavarin,</HI> and the Latin Authors, <HI>Javarinum, Arabo</HI> and <HI>Ha∣rabo.</HI> The Fort was made by <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> be∣fore he came to be Emperor in the year, 1550. and is one of the com∣pleatest Strengths in <HI>Europe.</HI> It hath two Bridges, one on the side of <HI>Au∣stria,</HI> and the other on the side of <HI>Al∣ba Regalis,</HI> or <HI>Stael-Weissenbourgh,</HI> it is
<PB N="56" REF="30"/> fortified with Seven Bastions, and hath Four high Mounts, from whence all the Country about may be disco∣vered. The First is the Bastion, on which the Castle or Governours Pa∣lace is built. The Second is upon the brink of the River of <HI>Danube.</HI> The Third stands upon the Holy Hill; and when the <HI>Turks</HI> blew it up, there was a Man upon it on Horse back, who was carried by the force of the Gun∣powder into the <HI>Danube,</HI> without the least hurt either to Man or Horse. The Fourth is that in the middle, which looks East-ward into the Coun∣trey. The Fifth is that which is cal∣led the New Bastion. The Sixth the Imperial Bastion. And the Seventh is that of <HI>Hungary,</HI> on the brink of the River of <HI>Raab.</HI> Here it was that the <HI>Turkish</HI> Governour was killed, when the Christians surprised the Town, in the night time. It is very near the Isle of <HI>Schut</HI> in a Plain that reaches out of sight, environed by a Branch of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and the River of <HI>Raab,</HI> which makes many to give it that name: And it would seem that nothing can be able to hurt it; unless it be a little Hill
<PB N="57" REF="30"/> which is at a pretty good distance from it too, and might be blown up when they pleased, if there were occa∣sion for it. Beyond it there is also a little Tower, in the middle of the Plain, from whence the approach of an Enemy, may easily be discovered. This Town may be near Three hun∣dred paces in Circuit, and at each Angle of the Figure, there is a Cava∣lier which commands the Fortification faced with brick. <HI>Sinam Bassa</HI> besieg∣ed it in the Reign of Sultan <HI>Amurath</HI> III. He lost a great many men there, and Twelve thousand were killed in one Attack; but at length it rendred in the year 1591. by the Treachery of the Count of <HI>Hardeck,</HI> who was Go∣vernour of the place, for which base Action he had his Head struck off at <HI>Vienna.</HI> Some years after it was re∣taken by the Count of <HI>Swartszenbourg,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Palfy</HI> who surprised it in the night time, in the year 1606. under the Emperor <HI>Rodolph,</HI> and made a great slaughter of all the <HI>Turks</HI> that were in it: A piece of the Gate, which was broken down by a Petard, is still kept in the Cathedral Church, as the
<PB N="58" REF="31"/> Instrument of the Victory; in memo∣ry whereof, the Town fires yearly all their Guns, and make a Solemn Pro∣cession. Whilst the <HI>Turks</HI> were Ma∣sters of that Town, they made a Dungeon for the Christian Prisoners, into which there enters no Light but through a Grate that looks to the Market-place. But at present there are commonly <HI>Turks</HI> shut up in it, who beg the Charity of those that pass that way, and sell a kind of Whips, which they make in their wretched Confine∣ment. <HI>George Drascovitz</HI> Bishop of that Town held a Synod there in the year 1579.</P>
<P>The Emperor finding himself in∣commoded by the great number of <HI>Chiaus</HI> or Ordinary Envoys who came often to <HI>Vienna,</HI> from the Vizier of <HI>Bu∣da,</HI> and never went back again with∣out some Present, ordered for the fu∣ture, that they should advance no far∣ther than <HI>Raab,</HI> unless they had a Per∣mission, and that they should receive their dispatches there. In consequence whereof there was in <HI>December,</HI> 1685. a <HI>Turkish Aga</HI> there named <HI>Aga Scelebi,</HI> waiting for the Emperours Answer,
<PB N="59" REF="31"/> from whom he came to beg a Peace.</P>

The Valiant Count <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> Se∣cond of that Name, burnt this Town, and the Bridge of <HI>Esseck,</HI> in the year 1664. and shortly after signalized him∣self in a particular manner at the Bat∣tle of <HI>Raab,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> having ingenu∣ously confessed, that the Terror of his Name was the cause of the gaining of that Battle. Not long after that brave Count ended his Life, in a very Tra∣gical manner, for being separated from his Attendance, and engaged in the Thickets of a Wood, a Wild Boar enraged by the Wounds which it had received, fell upon him, and having hurt him in the Knee, threw him down. The Count had not the leisure to come to him again; for the violent Beast struck one of its Tusks into his Head, and gave him that Mortal wound, whereof he shortly af∣ter died in his Page's Arms. Such
<PB N="66" REF="35"/> was the end of that Illustrious Cap∣tain, whom Death seemed to have respected amidst the greatest Dangers to which he daily exposed himself, and yet became a prey to an inconsi∣derable Beast. He was a sworn Ene∣my to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and had for them as implacable a Hatred as ever <HI>Hanibal</HI> had for the <HI>Romans.</HI> He was undaunted in Dangers, brave in Acti∣on, indefategable in Labour, Mild in Peace, and moderate in his Pleasures. He was very sober and took greatest pleasure in Hunting in the Woods, be∣cause it was an Exercise that resem∣bled the Labours of War. He was a man of a profound and solid Judg∣ment; and in a Word, one of the most zealous Defenders of the Christi∣an Religion, whose Courage, Valour, and brave Actions, ought in History to procure him a place amongst the greatest <HI>Hero</HI>'s. He died the 18th. of <HI>November,</HI> 1664. about the four and fortieth year of his Age, and his Body was Buried near to <HI>Sacathurne,</HI> the place of his Residence in <HI>Croatia,</HI> in the Chap∣ple that hath been built in the same place of the Wood where he was killed,

<HEAD><HI>ESSECK</HI> and its <HI>BRIDGE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Town of <HI>Esseck</HI> or <HI>Osseck,</HI> is thought to be the Ancient <HI>Mursa,</HI> or at least it is not far from it. History will have it to be in this place, that <HI>Constantus</HI> Son to the Emperor <HI>Con∣stantine</HI> defeated the Tyrant <HI>Magnen∣tius</HI> in the year 359. This Town lies very low, and there are Trees grow∣ing in all the Streets. On one side of
<PB N="68" REF="36"/> the Gate there is part of a <HI>Roman</HI> in∣scription, which begins thus: <HI>M. Aeli∣an,</HI> &amp;c. And on the other, the Head of a Maid on a Stone. There is a very pret∣ty Dial there also, brought thither from <HI>Serinwar;</HI> and one of the finest pieces of Cannon that ever was seen in those parts: It is not upon a Carriage, as o∣thers are, but upon great beam of Wood. This is a great and populous Town, there being in it at least five hundred shops, many Mosques and <HI>Haccars,</HI> which are large Inns for Tra∣vellers.</P>
<P>But that which is most considerable, is the lovely Wooden Bridge, (not to be matched in the World) which was built by <HI>Solyman,</HI> in the year 1521. immedi∣ately after he took <HI>Belgrade,</HI> partly over the <HI>Drave,</HI> and partly over the River of <HI>Fenues</HI> close by, both which do often o∣verflow. On this side the <HI>Drave</HI> it is about Eleven Hundred paces long, and on the other side almost Eight Thousand, all of good Oak. It is about Twelve yards broad, so that three <HI>Turkish</HI> Wag∣gons, that are bigger than ours, can go a Breast upon it. The River of <HI>Drave</HI> is not broad at that place, and there are
<PB N="69" REF="36"/> but sixteen Boats that support the Bridge with great Trees that make the Arches. All who well consider that Bridge, and the several Wood∣en Towers which are built upon it, with the vast number of Beams that were needful to uphold so great a Fa∣brick, cannot sufficiently admire, how they could find Timber enough to build or to support it. The Brave Count <HI>Nicholas</HI> of <HI>Serini,</HI> Second of that Name, burnt the part of the Bridge that is over the <HI>Drave</HI> in the year 1664. but in six Weeks time they made ano∣ther Bridge of Boats, a little lower than the first. The <HI>Turks</HI> would not re-build it in the same place, because the Piles that supported it, and that were under Water when the Fire was out, stuck so fast in the ground, that it would have cost them too much Trouble to get them out. Over this Bridge march all the Armies that come into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and here it was that the unfortunate King <HI>Loüis</HI> thought to have put a stop to the <HI>Turks,</HI> that were co∣ming against him, under the Conduct of <HI>Solyman,</HI> in the year 1526. and in∣deed, if that Pass had been well defen∣ded
<PB N="70" REF="37"/> at that time, it is probable <HI>Soly∣man</HI> might not so easily have marched forwards to <HI>Buda.</HI> Count <HI>Serini</HI> burnt the part of the Bridge that was built o∣ver the <HI>Drave,</HI> to hinder the <HI>Grand Vi∣sier</HI> from receiving Succours from the other Counties of <HI>Turky;</HI> and upon his return, he also burnt <HI>Five-Churches,</HI> that lyes West-ward from <HI>Esseck. Count Le∣slie,</HI> General of the Imperial Army, set fire again to the Bridge of <HI>Esseck,</HI> which for twelve hundred Paces length was immediately in a flame; at the same time he took the Town of <HI>Esseck,</HI> put all he met to the Sword, and ha∣ving plundred it, and blown up the Magazin and Arsenal, that were full of Ammunition and Provisions, he put Fire to it, and reduced it to A∣shes.</P>

But there is no good fish∣ing in it with Nets, because the Chan∣nel of it is triangular. This great Fer∣tili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y is attributed to the Communica∣tion that its Water hath with the salt Mines under Ground, which impreg∣nates it with a Principle of Fecun∣dity.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of the Division of the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> into Counties, and their Names.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have said before, that the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary</HI> is divid∣ed into Counties as well as <HI>England</HI> is. These Counties are the parts of the Kingdom, which are called Provin∣ces, and by the <HI>Greeks</HI> Monarchies, and the Lords who are Counts of them, have the jurisdiction therein; it having been for the more easie and exact Administration thereof, that the <HI>Hungarians</HI> thought fit to make that division. The Soveraignty of part of these Counties is at present lodged in his Imperial Majesty, as King of <HI>Hun∣gary;</HI> and the other is usurped by the <HI>Turks:</HI> The Counties subject to the King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> are these that follow.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of the State of the Palatin of the King∣dom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> his Quality, Au∣thority, and Preheminence, with a List of those who in this last Age have been Elected to that Office.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE chief Dignity of this King∣dom next to the King, is that of <HI>Palatin,</HI> who calls the Estates during an Inter-reigne, and who hath the first and most powerful voice in the Electi∣on of the King. He also decides the controversies that happen betwixt the King and his Subjects, since the Kings there are subject to the Laws, and must not Transgress them. He hath abso∣lute Power in the Armies, so that he can punish and reward all, as he thinks good, and bestow asmuch Land as Twenty or Thirty men are able to Labour. He hath great Revenues, not only from the Salt-pits, but from other things also; and heretofore he had the Rents of the two Isles on the Coast
<PB N="90" REF="47"/> of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> which now are possessed by the <HI>Venetians.</HI> In short, so great is his Authority, that right or wrong the <HI>Hungarians</HI> obey his Will, and fol∣low his Resolutions; and it is a Digni∣ty that cannot be given to Strangers, but belongs only to the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who many times oppose their King by means of that Magistrate. It is not an Hereditary but Elective Office. Here I shall mention those who in this last Age have been Chosen to that Dignity.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Stephen Illishazi</HI> Count of <HI>Trens∣chin,</HI> Palatine of <HI>Hungary,</HI> chosen in the year 1601. died at <HI>Vienna</HI> the 26. of <HI>May</HI> 1609.</P>

<P>THE Inhabitants of <HI>Hungary</HI> have had in Ages past many Brushes with the <HI>Romans,</HI> and fought several Bat∣tles with them: that which was given in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Adom,</HI> a Town of the Lower <HI>Hungary,</HI> upon the Bank of the <HI>Danube,</HI> was one of the Bloodiest.

<P>Some time after the Inhabitants of <HI>Hungary</HI> having recollected their For∣ces, gave the <HI>Romans</HI> a Second Battle in the precincts of <HI>Solna,</HI> wherein they again obtained the Victory, and drove out the <HI>Romans,</HI> though they lost on their side above Forty thousand of their own Souldiers.</P>

<P>MOST Illustrious Lord, and most dear to us. Being
<PB N="106" REF="55"/> called to the relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which was in danger of being lost, we make no doubt, but that you have been in∣formed by the com∣mon Report, in how short a time, not∣withstanding the dif∣ficulties and length of the way, we came to the Banks of the <HI>Danube,</HI> sur∣mounted the tops of Mountains, and cros∣sed the Forrests of <HI>Vienna,</HI> with Forces that we raised in di∣ligence; but with Pleasure now we ac∣quaint your Illustri∣ous Lordship with that which we cannot conceal without pre∣judice to the com∣mon Consolation of Christendom. Know then that Yesterday the Christian Ar∣mies, the command whereof was by all given to us, fight∣ing under the Pro∣tection of God; and
<PB N="107" REF="55"/> assisted by the good Fortune of the Princes, ann Dukes and Ele∣ctors, obtained in the Camp where we are, a signal Victory and Memorable to all posterity, over the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI> For the <HI>Grand Visier</HI> of the <HI>Turks</HI> proud with the Forces of all the East and of the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI> and think∣ing of nothing less than swallow∣ing up not only <HI>Vienna,</HI> which in three days space must have perished (had it not been reliev∣ed) but also all Christendom, is in one days fight overthrown and put to flight. The Infantry, whom they call <HI>Jani∣saries,</HI> not being able to fly so
<PB N="108" REF="56"/> nimbly as the Horse, seeing they are slower and more pestered, were left in the Camp, and aban∣doned to the dis∣cretion of the Vi∣ctorious. Their Camp, which took up near two <HI>German</HI> miles in <HI>length,</HI> and as much in breadth, was taken, their Can∣non, Ammuniti∣on, with rich spoils became the re∣ward of the victo∣rious Armies. <HI>Vi∣enna</HI> is relieved from a dreadful Siege, and immi∣nent dangers, and the Emperour a∣gain restored to the place of his Residence. The Night put a stop to the course of the Victory, and Darkness favoured the Ignominious flight of the E∣nemy, who smit∣ten
<PB N="109" REF="56"/> with a Panick Fear is retreated towards <HI>Hungary.</HI> Our Light Horse, nevertheless pur∣sue them at the Heels, and kill or make Prisoners all whom they over∣take in the way. We, moreover, in the name of God pursue the same Victory, being re∣solved not to de∣sist, untill (if kind Heaven so think fit) we have opened for the Christian Armies Winter quarters in the Enemies Country. And such at present is the Confus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Af∣fairs, that if the Princes of Europe, will speedily Arm and undertake somewhat worthy of the Christian Name, a more favourable Jun∣cture than this
<PB N="110" REF="57"/> can never be of∣fered unto them; for if the News of this Victory were seconded by some shew of arm∣ing by Land and by Sea, there is no doubt but <HI>Greece,</HI> that groans under the Ty∣ranny of an U∣surper, and <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI> it self would revolt from their perfidious Master, and endea¦vor to reco∣ver their pristine-Liberty. Upon no slight grounds we may assert the same thing of <HI>Epyrus, Macedonia, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Dalma∣tia, Valachia, Mol∣davia,</HI> and other Kingdoms and Provinces that have been sub∣dued by the <HI>Turks.</HI> Perhaps, also the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Em∣pire, may now have a tryal of
<PB N="111" REF="57"/> the vicissitude of Humane Affairs, and from small Beginnings being grown so great, that it labours under its own weight, by a change of Fate and a turn of the Wheel of fickle Fortune, it may relapse in∣to its Original, and from so high an Elevation have a greater fall. But all these things are to be left to the su∣pream Will and Pleasure of Em∣pires and King∣doms. As for your Illustrious Lordship, we are fully perswaded that you have so great Piety and such Generous In∣clinations towards the concerns of Christianity, that you will not on¦ly congratulate
<PB N="112" REF="58"/> these happy suc∣cesses; but one day also contri∣bute to the pro∣moting of the same, and omit no Occasion of furthering the ad∣vantage of <HI>Chri∣stendom.</HI> This we desire from the bottom of our Heart, praying God to give your Illustrious Lord∣ship perfect health and all sort of Prosperity.

<P>Now this happy Victory and Relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> is so much the more to be pri∣sed, that it is certain, according to the List which was afterwards found in the Grand Viziers Tent, that the Army of the <HI>Turks</HI> which Besieged it, consisted of 191800. men, and the Christian Army only of 81600. The great Standard, the Horses Tail, and the Grand Viziers own Horse were taken by the <HI>Poles,</HI> who obstinatly pursued them in their Retreat, and there was much booty found in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Camp, which was wholly plundered even to the Tent of the Grand Vizier, where they found great Riches in Gold, Silver, and other pre∣cious things: All their Artillery, which consisted of above an hundred pieces
<PB N="117" REF="60"/> of Cannon, was also gained with store of Ammunition.</P>
<P>The great Standard we mentioned before, was carried before the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> when he made his entry into <HI>Vienna,</HI> immediately after it was Relieved, and was sent presently by that King to the Pope. On the one side of it was this Inscription,
<Q>We prophecy to you prosperity and good Success, God Pardon your Sins, and grant you all his grace.</Q></P>
<P>And on the other side.
<Q>God Assist and Bless you, and dwell in the Hearts of Believers, that the purity of the Faith may encrease therein. Besides him there is no other God, and <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> is his Prophet.</Q></P>
<P>It will not be amiss here to insert the List of the great Lords, who be∣sides the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> were present at that Battle; of whom the Names follow,

</LIST></P>
<P>And since the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had so great a Hand in this Victory, I hope the Curious will not be dissatisfi∣ed, to see the League offensive and de∣fensive, which was happily made and concluded in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> 1683. betwixt their <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Polo∣nian</HI> Majesties, of which the substance follows:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="119" REF="61"/>1. There shall be only an Alliance defensive betwixt the two high Con∣tractors; but against the <HI>Turks</HI> there shall be also an Alliance offensive, which shall last untill both Parties find themselves in Rest and good Security.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Alliance shall be Sworn and Sacredly confirmed by Oath, in presence of the Pope, by the two Cardinals <HI>Pio</HI> and <HI>Barberino,</HI> aswell in name of his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty, as of his Majesty of <HI>Poland,</HI> and of his States.</P>
<P N="3">3. His <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty renounces all pretentions for the Charges he hath been at, for the good of the Republick of <HI>Poland,</HI> during the late War of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> and the <HI>Diploma de Electione Regis</HI> shall be given back and an∣nulled.</P>
<P N="4">4. On the other hand the Crown and Republick of <HI>Poland</HI> renounces all pretentions it can have against the House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The one shall not make a sepa∣rate Peace, without the consent of the other.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="120" REF="62"/>6. The Heirs of the two parties and Successors in the Government, shall be obliged to observe this Alli∣ance.</P>
<P N="7">7. This only is to be understood of a War against the <HI>Turks,</HI> and not of any other.</P>
<P N="8">8. His <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty declares, that he will entertain 60000. men, whereof he will send 40000. into the Fields, and keep the other 20000. in Garrisons.</P>
<P N="9">9. His <HI>Polonian</HI> Majesty offers to bring 40000. men into the Fields un∣der his own command.</P>
<P N="10">10. To the end the Preparations of War may be the sooner in readiness, His <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty promises by Antici∣pation to remit 200000. Crowns to the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> on condition that that sum be raised out of the Tenth of the Pope in the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> which he hath granted for that effect.</P>
<P N="11">11. His <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty shall be obliged to recover the places that he hath lost in <HI>Hungary.</HI> The <HI>Poles</HI> in like manner shall be obliged to regain theirs in <HI>Podolia, Walachia,</HI> and the <HI>Vkrain,</HI> and to act against <HI>Teckely</HI> with 6000. men.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="121" REF="62"/>12. Other Christian Kings and Po∣tentats may be also received into this Alliance; but not without the mutu∣al consent of both Parties, and above all the two <HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> shall be earnestly entreated to enter in∣to it.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this Chapter, without calling to mind a pretty Em∣bleme made upon occasion of this Victory, by a young Prince, who reckons Emperors amongst his Ance∣stors: The Emblem represents a <HI>Turk</HI> pitching a Net to surprise and catch the Eagle; but who wandering and engaging too far in his own Toile, be∣came himself therein the prey of the Eagle, with this Inscription: <Q><HI>Qui captat, capitur,</HI> or <HI>Turca à capiendis captus.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><L>Turca parans Aquilae insidias ac retia tendens</L>
<L>In somnis nuper visus adesse mihi.</L>
<L>O miseram! mecum tacitus, te funera, dixi,</L>

<HEAD>THE BATTLE OR DEFEAT OF THE TURKS NEAR <HI>PRESBOƲRG.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Turks</HI> who were before <HI>Vienna,</HI> in the year 1683. find∣ing it difficult to bring their Provisions and Ammunition from the City of <HI>Buda,</HI> to the place where they were on the side of the <HI>Danube;</HI> be∣cause the Garrisons of <HI>Raab</HI> and <HI>Co∣mora</HI> way laid all their Convoys, and much annoyed them; the <HI>Grand Visier</HI> sent orders to <HI>Basha Husani,</HI> to join
<PB N="124" REF="64"/> Count <HI>Teckely</HI> with some Troops, who was on the other side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> near the River of <HI>Waag,</HI> and to en∣deavour to make himself Master of the City of <HI>Presbourg,</HI> to the end they might have the passage of the <HI>Danube</HI> free, make a Bridge of Boats over it, and be provided of all things on that side. The thing was well undertaken; for Twenty thousand of their Men marched towards that Town: But the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who at that time resolved to encrease his Army with the Regiments of <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>Baden,</HI> which were in <HI>Raab,</HI> and were not so necessary there, seeing the <HI>Turks</HI> had Besieged <HI>Vienna,</HI> and who therefore had drawn near to <HI>Presbourg,</HI> to secure that Town from the attempts of the <HI>Turks;</HI> having had notice of it, sent immediately against them Prince <HI>Louis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> (who that day commanded the Van-Guard) with some Squadrons of Prince <HI>Lubomirski</HI>'s men, and the Two Regiments of <HI>Palfi</HI> and <HI>Styrum,</HI> who at first charged <HI>Teckely</HI>'s men in such a manner, that presently they be∣took themselves to flight. The <HI>Turks</HI> made a little longer Resistance; but at
<PB N="225" REF="64"/> length also they were forced to give ground with the loss of Eight hundred of their Men, and a considerable <HI>Aga.</HI> The <HI>Imperialists</HI> gained there a Thou∣sand Wagons with Baggage; and cer∣tainly it was a lucky Hit for them to have beat the Enemy at that time, be∣cause if they had delayed but one day longer, <HI>Presbourg</HI> had been lost, see∣ing those within had promised to ren∣der next day to <HI>Teckely,</HI> and to furnish him with all that was necessary for the Bridge of Boats: whereas the <HI>Im∣perialists</HI> thereby not only preserved that Town, whither soon after they sent Six hundred men to re-inforce the Garrison; but also hindred the passage of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and the means of pro∣viding the Army before <HI>Vienna</HI> with necessaries; besides that they also ru∣ined the Boats which Count <HI>Teckely</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> had gathered together for making a Bridge: These last re∣treated towards the River of <HI>Waag,</HI> from whence Count <HI>Teckely</HI> wrote a Letter, to Justifie himself to the <HI>Grand Visier,</HI> which was intercepted by the <HI>Imperialists.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE BATTLE OF BARKAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE Generals of the Christian Armies, on the 10th. of <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI> 1683. advanced towards <HI>Barkan</HI> (the <HI>Poles</HI> on that occasion be∣ing on the left Wing;) the <HI>Turks</HI> see∣ing them approach, fell upon them with a dreadful Shout, and chiefly up∣on the left Wing, commanded by the Lord High Marshal of <HI>Poland Jabla∣nowisky,</HI> who having the former Vict∣ory in his thoughts, charged the <HI>Turks</HI> so furiously, that he constrained them to give ground; but the Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain</HI> with the Cavalry of the right Wing, broke in upon them, with so great Impetuosity, that he put them entirely to the Flight. Afterwards some Regiments were commanded out to pursue the <HI>Turks,</HI> who fled, and by
<PB N="127" REF="65"/> them were driven partly in a Marish, and partly into the <HI>Danube;</HI> because the Bridge, betwixt <HI>Barkan</HI> and <HI>Gran,</HI> broke in the middle, so that most of them fell into the River, and were drowned, and the rest who saved themselves in the Marish were killed, seeing in the first heat they gave the <HI>Turks</HI> no Quarters; and it was not till towards the end that they took a Thousand Prisoners, a∣mongst whom was the Basha of <HI>Silistria.</HI> Prince <HI>Loüis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> signalized him∣self on this occasion, and was by his Conduct the chief cause of the Victo∣ry, because the <HI>Imperial</HI> Cavalry act∣ed all along without the Foot. The Christians gained all the Colours, Tents, Cannon, Baggage, and in a word, all that was in the Camp of the <HI>Turks,</HI> besides a Thousand Horses that they made booty of. There are various Relations of the loss that the <HI>Turks</HI> suf∣fered in this Fight; some will have it that being Thirteen thousand strong before the Defeat, they saved but Three or Four Thousand at most, and amongst those the <HI>Basha</HI> of <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> who Commanded them; all the rest,
<PB N="128" REF="66"/> who were the Choice of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, being either killed or taken. However it be, the Waters of the <HI>Da∣nube</HI> were died with their Blood; this Fight lasted about five hours.</P>
<P>From thence the <HI>Imperalists</HI> advanc∣ed towards <HI>Barkan,</HI> and Battered that place so violently with great and small Shot, that presently they in the Town beat a Parley, which being granted them, the <HI>Imperialists</HI> enter∣ed the place; but shortly after a Fire happening in it, this little Hold was burnt down, and no body could tell how the Fire happened. This Victory was followed by the taking of <HI>Gran,</HI> which surrendered the 27th. of <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI> after four days Siege: These were the Articles of Capitulation;</P>
<P N="1">1. All the Cannon, Mortars, Ammu∣nition, Magazines, and other Arms shall remain in the Fort, except what is hereafter specified.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Garrison shall have leave to provide themselves of Bread and Meat for two days, and to carry with them all their Coffee, Sharbet, Cloaths and other Moveables.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="129" REF="66"/>3 His Highness of <HI>Lorrain</HI> shall fur¦nish the Garrison a certain Number of Waggons, to carry their Goods to the Water, to be Transported down∣wards.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some Boats shall also be given to the said Garrison, to be made use of for transporting their Effects; and if they cannot carry them off all at once, they may send for them at several times.</P>
<P N="5">5. That if the afore said Baggage can∣not be Transported all at once, the Garrison may put what is left behind into some Houses of the Lower Town, which shall be kept by some of their Men, that all the rest may honestly and without Let or Molestation follow after.</P>
<P N="6">6. Since the Boat-men cannot be spared at present, the Garrison shall be obliged to make use of their own men, to go down and up the River with the Boats.</P>
<P N="7">7. The afore-mentioned Articles being granted to the Garrison, the Gate of the Castle shall immediately be opened to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Troops, that they may take their Post there,
<PB N="130" REF="67"/> and so soon as the aforesaid Waggons and Boats shall be ready, the Garrison of the Fort of <HI>Gran,</HI> that is to say, they who are capable to bear Arms, shall march out all at once.</P>
<P N="8">8. All the Christian Prisoners in the Castle shall be released.</P>
<P N="9">9. Lastly, the Garrison may freely march out, as hath been said, with their Wives and Children, Arms and Baggage, Horses and Camels, observ∣ing the Conditions above-mentioned, in the manner as they are expressed.</P>
<P>In consequence of this Capitulation, the Prince of <HI>Alepah</HI> of <HI>Syria,</HI> Comman∣der in <HI>Gran,</HI> and <HI>Basha</HI> of <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and <HI>Samson Basha</HI> Colonel of the <HI>Janissa∣ries,</HI> marched out of the place with Five hundred Men carrying Arms to go to <HI>Offen;</HI> whereupon the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> made Governor of <HI>Gran</HI> Co∣lonel <HI>Calowith</HI> Governor of the Castle of <HI>Presbourg,</HI> with a Garrison of 1000. <HI>Imperial</HI> Souldiers, and some Hundreds of <HI>Hussars.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of the Ceremonies observed in the Coro∣nations of the Kings and Queens of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter all necessary Preparations have been made for the Solem∣nity of the Coronation, the Ceremo∣nies of it are performed in this manner: In the first place, an Election is made of those who are to go and fetch the Crown, Scepter, Globe, representing the World, Sword, Coat of Arms, the Royal Habits, and Cross, in the City of <HI>Presbourg,</HI> where they are kept, with the Standards of the King∣dom. They discharge this Duty, and carry them to the Church. The Pa∣latin takes the Crown, and places it on the right side of the Altar, where the Arch-bishop of <HI>Strigonium</HI> says Mass; the Prelates sit about the Steps of the Altar, and some of them lead the King from the Throne to the Al∣tar, or from the Altar to his Seat; the
<PB N="134" REF="69"/> rest serve for some other Action of the Coronation. The Kings Throne dec∣ked with Cloth of Gold, is pretty near the Altar, and opposite to the middle of it, having over it a Cloth of State, of the same Stuff as that of the Seat. The King kneels first upon the Steps of the Altar, and Kisses the Cross, which the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Stri∣gonium</HI> presents to him; then takes the Oath contained in the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontifi∣cal, saying the Words after the Arch-bishop, and laying his Right hand on the Gospel, with Eyes lifted up to Heaven, as if he called God to wit∣ness. After the Oath, he is anointed by the Arch-bishop on the right Arm near the Elbow, and betwixt the two Shoulders: Then being cloathed with the Coat of Arms of King St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> he receives from the same Arch-Bishop, the naked <HI>Cuttelas</HI> of the same Saint, then gives it back to the Arch-bishop, who returns it into the Scabbard, and then girds it to his side. That being done, the King turned towards the Altar, as Defender of the Altars, Re∣ligion, and the Church, draws the Sword out of the Scabbard,
<PB N="135" REF="69"/> and brandishing it three ways in the Air gives so many blows; then the Arch-Bishop taking the Crown, gives it to the Palatin, who holding it up on high with both his Hands, and being upon the Steps of the Altar, asks aloud all that are present, if they would have him Crown'd for their King, and having three times put the same que∣stion unto them, upon their answer∣ing in the Affirmative, he is crowned, and receives from the Arch-Bishop the Scepter in the right hand, the Globe in the left, and all the marks of Roy∣al Dignity: After that he sits down on the Throne, as taking Possession of the Kingdom. Then all the <HI>Hun∣garians</HI> make loud Shouts and Accla∣mations, wishing the King a long and prosperous Reign, and at the same time, the Vocal and Instrumental Mu∣sick, the Trumpets, Drums, and Can∣non, mingle their noise with the confused Voices. Mass being said, and the Streets, through which the King is to go, being Boarded and co∣vered with White, Green, and Red Cloth, the King walks from the Church, where he was, to another,
<PB N="136" REF="70"/> wearing the Crown and Coat of Arms, some carrying before him the Royal Ornaments and Standards, and a great many others walking before and after him. At the same time pieces of Gold and Silver are scattered a∣mong the People, in all the Streets through which the King passes, who coming to the other Church, sits down on the Royal Throne erected there, and makes some Knights, striking them thrice on the Back with the naked Sword of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> as they are knee∣ling before him. This being done, he comes out of the Church, and mount∣ing on Horse back, with the Crown and Coat of Arms, having the same per∣sons on Horse-back, who walked be∣fore or followed him on foot, as he came in the same Order he goes out of the Town, and alighting, with the Arch-bishop of <HI>Strigonium</HI> mounts up upon a Theater, where lifting up the Right hand he takes an Oath to the <HI>Hungarians</HI> to maintain the Priviledges of the Nobility, do Justice to all, ob∣serve the Laws of the Kingdom, and procure the good of the Publick.</P>
<P>In the mean time all are uncovered, and when he hath taken the Oath, all
<PB N="137" REF="70"/> again shout, and amidst the noise of great Guns wish him all sort of Prospe∣rity. Afterwards he mounts a stately and well-managed Horse, and spurs him towards an adjoyning ground, where putting him upon the Carrier, and drawing the Sword of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> he makes in form of a Cross, four stroaks in the Air, turning his Horse very nimbly, as threatning the four Corners of the World, and then there is nothing to be heard but Volleys of great Guns. After this the new King putting his Horse to a Walk, draws near the Lords who are Spectators, and with them goes to his Pallace, where he feasts them, sitting at Table with his Crown and Coat of Arms, and being served by some Ba∣rons and Grandees of the Kingdom, appointed for that Office; and when Dinner is over, they who have the charge of the Crown, and Royal Orna∣ments carry them back to their place.</P>
<P>Now to shew you the Ceremonies of the Coronation of the Queens of <HI>Hungary,</HI> I'll give you here an Abridg∣ment of what past when the present Emperess <HI>Anna Maria of Bavaria</HI> Pa∣latiness
<PB N="138" REF="71"/> of <HI>Newbourg</HI> was Crowned Queen of <HI>Hungary</HI> in the Town of <HI>Edimbourg</HI> in the year 1681. The Emperor in his <HI>Imperial</HI> Habits, and the Domestick Crown of the Empire on his Head, went with his Attendants to the Church of the <HI>Recollets,</HI> where he was received and sprinkled with Holy Water by the Clergy of <HI>Hunga∣ry.</HI></P>
<P>The Train of the Empress came after, before whom Count <HI>John Dras∣kowich</HI> walked with the Scepter, in place of Count <HI>Draskowich,</HI> the Ste∣ward of the Kingdom went before. The Counts <HI>Stephen Zichy</HI> and <HI>Christo∣pher Erdedy,</HI> both Keepers of the Crown, came next, with the Lords who carried the Royal Jewels upon Cushions of Crimson Velvet. Count <HI>Illishazi</HI> carried the Silver Cross, Count <HI>Nicholas Erdedy</HI> the Scepter, the Pala∣tin of <HI>Hungary</HI> the Crown, and Count <HI>Nicholas Draskowich</HI> the Globe of the Empire. The <HI>Empress</HI> came after these, led by the Duke of <HI>Diederichstein</HI> Master of the Palace. The Countess of <HI>Rapach</HI> chief Governante carried up her Train, which was embroidered
<PB N="139" REF="71"/> with Gold, Diamonds and Pearls, and after her came the Palatiness and other Ladies of Court. The Emperess was received at the Entry into the Church, by the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Colocza</HI> and <HI>Neutra,</HI> who led her to the Throne. In the mean time the Emperour ha∣ving taken his place on the side of the Gospel, went also to his Throne in the middle of the Quire over against the great Altar, behind the Throne sate the Palatiness with the chief Go∣vernante and other Ladies of Court, in Chaires prepared for them. On the left hand of the Empresses Throne were the Lords of <HI>Hungary,</HI> who carri∣ed the Jewels of the Kingdom, which were taken from them by the Arch-Bishop who put them upon the Altar. Before the Throne there was a Silver Stool, where the Domestick Crown, which was brought to the Church un∣der a Cover, was placed. That being done the Gospel was read, at the end whereof the Emperour went to the Altar with the Crown on his Head, the Scepter in his Right Hand, and the Globe in the Left, and presented the Empress to the
<PB N="140" REF="72"/> Arch-bishops to be crowned. When his Imperial Majesty had taken his place, the Empress advanced towards the Altar, assisted by the Arch-bishops, and kneeled upon the first Step, whilst the Arch-bishop of <HI>Gran</HI> kissed the end of the Cross, and presented her the Scepter and Globe of the Empire, which she took, the Scepter in her right hand, and the Globe in the left, the Prelate all the while saying some Prayers. That Ceremony being over, the Empress was led back to the Throne, where the Arch-bishop hav∣ing again said some Prayers, <HI>Te Deum</HI> was sung during a Volly of 480. Musket∣shot, and a discharge of the Artillery upon the Rampart. Then Count <HI>John Draskowich</HI> took the Scepter and Globe of the Empire out of the hands of the Empress, in place of the Steward of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and gave them back to those who had carried them before. That being done, the Empress was led to the Offering by the Arch-bishops, and put a rare piece of Gold of Gold-Smiths work into a Silver Bason that was up∣on the Altar, and then returned to her Throne. The Domestick Crown was
<PB N="141" REF="72"/> taken off of the Head of the Empress by the Bishop of <HI>Neutra,</HI> during the Offering and Communion, and given to be held by the Duke of <HI>Diedericksteyn,</HI> who after the Communion gave it back to the said Prelate, to be put up∣on the Head of the Empress again. The aforesaid Bishop led her to the Communion, which being given her by the hand of the Arch-bishop of <HI>Gran,</HI> the Crown was put upon her Majesties head. The Ceremonies thus performed, they returned in the same Order as they came, with the noise of Cannon, and the Ladies were ad∣mitted to kiss her Hand. When they were at Table, his Imperial Majesty ordered the Artillery once more to play, which concluded the Solemnity.</P>

<P><HI>TRansilvania,</HI> a Principality of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> is part of the Ancient <HI>Dacia,</HI> to the West of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and to the East of <HI>Moravia,</HI> having the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Mountains to the North, and <HI>Walachia</HI> to the South. It is four days journey in length, and as much in breadth: That Name was given it by the <HI>Romans,</HI> because it is incompassed with Forrests as well as Mountains. The <HI>Hungari∣ans</HI> call it <HI>Erdely,</HI> and the <HI>Germans Si∣ben bergen;</HI> because of Seven Towns which the fugitive <HI>Saxons</HI> built there. Several other People settled there; but the <HI>Saxons</HI> I speak of cultivated the Country best. The <HI>Romans</HI> after∣wards became Masters of it under <HI>Tra∣jan:</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="73"/> In process of time it was united to <HI>Hungary,</HI> from which it was dismem∣bred in the year 1541. At present the Princes of it are Elective &amp; Tributary to the <HI>Turk.</HI> The Town of <HI>Transilva∣nia</HI> are <HI>Hermenstadt, Clausenbourg, Wei∣senbourg,</HI> or <HI>Alba-Julia,</HI> &amp;c. It is a fertile Country, and hath several Mines and Medicinal Plants. Most of the Inhabitants are <HI>Greeks, Schismaticks;</HI> there are in it also a great many <HI>Here∣ticks,</HI> and some <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>The Princes of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> who have reigned since the beginning of this Age, are these that follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sigismond Bathori,</HI> Knight of the Golden Fleece, Son to <HI>Christopher</HI> Prince of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> who died in the year 1581. succeeded to his Fa∣ther in that Principality, and died at <HI>Prague</HI> the 17. of <HI>March</HI> 1603.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Stephen Bodtskey</HI> introduced himself by force into that Principality, and his Usurpation was approved by the <HI>Turk,</HI> and at length by the Empe∣ror upon certain Conditions; he died of Poyson in the year 1606. and named for his Successor <HI>Valen∣tine Homonay;</HI> but the States of the
<PB N="144" REF="74"/> Country preferred <HI>Sigismond Ragot∣ski</HI> before him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sigismond Ragotski</HI> was elected Prince of <HI>Transilvania</HI> in the year 1606. but having reigned a year, he resigned that Dignity to <HI>Gabriel Ba∣thory</HI> Nephew to Prince <HI>Sigismond</HI> in 1608. <HI>Sultan Achmet</HI> confirmed that choice, and the King of <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> the Arch-Duke <HI>Matthias</HI> did not oppose it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Gabriel Bathory</HI> was elected Prince of <HI>Transilvania</HI> in the year 1608. and was assassinated at <HI>Valencze</HI> in the year 1613.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Bethlen Gabor</HI> who had had a great Hand in that Death, being suppor∣ted by the <HI>Turks,</HI> seized the State and caused himself to be proclaim∣ed Prince of <HI>Transilvania</HI> in the year 1613. and by a Treaty made with the Emperor in 1622. he continued Prince of <HI>Transilvania.</HI> He died the 15. of <HI>November</HI> 1629.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>George Ragotski</HI> Prince of <HI>Transilva∣nia</HI> succeeded to him; he died of his Wounds at <HI>Waradin</HI> in the Month of <HI>June</HI> 1660.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="145" REF="74"/>7. <HI>Achatius Barchay</HI> by the <HI>Turks</HI> intro∣duced into that Principality in place of <HI>Ragotski,</HI> resigned it some time after, and was beheaded about the end of the said year 1660,</P>
<P N="8">8. When <HI>John Kemeni</HI> was chosen Prince, who was killed in the year. 1661.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Michael Abafti</HI> Count of <HI>Sicules,</HI> Prince of <HI>Transilvania</HI> who Reigns at present, was chosen in the year 1661. by the Assistance of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Selim</HI> the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor, died of an Apoplexy the Thirteenth of <HI>De∣cember</HI> 1574.</P>
<P><HI>Amurath</HI> III. Son of <HI>Selim</HI> II. began to Reign about the end of the year 1574. He presently put to death five of his Brothers, according to the Cru∣el custom of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> and refus∣ed to prolong with the Emperor <HI>Maxi∣milian</HI> II. the Truce which he had concluded with <HI>Selim</HI> II. He took <HI>Tauris</HI> which he Plundered, and de∣feated the <HI>Marovites</HI> and <HI>Drus</HI> of Mount <HI>Libanus:</HI> After that he made a powerful Invasion into the Country of the <HI>Croats,</HI> who were worsted at first, but they afterwards killed Ten thousand <HI>Turks,</HI> and obliged the rest to let them live in quiet. <HI>Amurath</HI> di∣ed at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the 18th. of <HI>Ja∣nuary,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="78"/> 1595. at the Age of Forty eight.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> III. Son of <HI>Amurath</HI> III. began his Reign in the year 1595. by the death of One and Twenty of his Brothers, and Ten of his Fathers Wives whom he left with Child, and whom he caused to be thrown into the Sea. He never was at the Head of his Ar∣my but once. The Christians under the Conduct of Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> took <HI>Strigonium, Alba-Regalis</HI> under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Mercaur</HI> in the year 1601. and the Lower Town of <HI>Buda,</HI> under the Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria.</HI> He lost the Forts of <HI>Vice grad, Balbocz, Petrinia, Haduan, Palota</HI> and <HI>Vesprin;</HI> and on the other side the Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> seized <HI>Lepanto.</HI> The Armies of <HI>Mahomet</HI> were beaten by the Vaivod of <HI>Walachia,</HI> and by the Prince of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> who defeated <HI>Sinan Basha,</HI> and so <HI>Moldavia, Wala∣ohia</HI> and <HI>Transilvania</HI> shook off the <HI>Ottoman</HI> yoke. The <HI>Turks</HI> on the o∣ther hand had some advantages, and re-took two or three Towns, as <HI>Pest Canisa</HI> and <HI>Alba-Regalis,</HI> but that was not comparable to their losses. <HI>Maho∣met</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="78"/> demanded Peace of the Christi∣ans, who refused it. He was an In∣famous Man, so plunged into Debau∣chery, that neither domestick Disor∣ders, nor Forreign Wars could ever make him forsake it; that made the <HI>Janisaries</HI> mutiny; to pacifie whom <HI>Mahomet</HI> was forced to deliver up his greatest Friends to their Rage, and pre∣tended to banish his Mother, who was thought to be the cause of all the Ca∣lamities of the State. He caused his eldest Son to be Strangled, and the <HI>Sultana</HI> the Mother of him to be drow∣ned, having suspected her to be Guil∣ty of some Treason against his Person. He died of the Plague at <HI>Constantino∣ple</HI> in the year 1603. the Thirty ninth year of his Age, and Eighth year of his Reign.</P>
<P><HI>Achmet</HI> I. of that name, Emperor, of the <HI>Turks,</HI> Succeeded to his Father, <HI>Mahomot</HI> III. at the Age of Fifteen years, in the year 1603. His Mode∣ration was admired upon his coming to the Throne, in that having but one only Brother, he did not put him to death according to the Custom of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Princes; but shut him up in
<PB N="154" REF="79"/> a Cloyster of <HI>Mahometans.</HI> The <HI>So∣phy</HI> of <HI>Persia</HI> taking the advantage of his Minority, re-took <HI>Tauris</HI> and <HI>Er∣zerum. Achmet</HI> sent thither the <HI>Basha Ci∣gale,</HI> who not having acquitted himself well of his Commission, was upon his re∣turn Strangled by 50. <HI>Capigis</HI> who met him at <HI>Bursa. Achmet</HI> regained <HI>Transil∣vania, Walachia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia</HI> by the means of <HI>Botskay,</HI> who revolted from the Emperor, and sided with <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> against <HI>Sigismond Bathory</HI> Prince of <HI>Transilvania.</HI> Afterwards finding himself Attacked on all hands, he put Four Armies into the Field; one against the <HI>Persians,</HI> another against the <HI>Poloni∣ans,</HI> one to oppose the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> and the last to guard the Tribute of <HI>Egypt;</HI> but all of them having been unfortu∣nate, as he was preparing for greater designs, he died the 15th. of <HI>November</HI> 1617. in the Thirtieth year of his Age and Fourteenth of his Reign.</P>
<P><HI>Mustapha,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Turks</HI> was Son to <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. and Brother to <HI>Achmet</HI> I. he succeeded to him though he had a Son <HI>Osman</HI> Twelve years old in the year 1617. <HI>Mustapha</HI> being Twenty five years of Age was placed
<PB N="155" REF="79"/> upon the Throne by the <HI>Janisaries,</HI> who two Months after degraded him, being displeased at his reserved way of living. <HI>Osman</HI> his Nephew Succeeded to him, and <HI>Mustapha,</HI> as some say, led a recluse and solitary Life: But the truth is he was in Prison; howe∣ver being brought out by the <HI>Janisa∣ries,</HI> he was again set upon the Throne the 19. of <HI>May</HI> 1622. Next day after he caused his Nephew <HI>Osman</HI> to be put to death, and having Reigned six∣teen Months, the People being dis∣satisfied with his Conduct, he was again confined to perpetual Imprison∣ment in the Month of <HI>September</HI> 1623. and <HI>Amurath</HI> Brother to <HI>Osman</HI> was put in his place.</P>
<P><HI>Osman,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> was the Son of <HI>Achmet</HI> I. and succeeded to him at Twelve years of Age about the end of <HI>January</HI> 1621. He led an Army of almost Four hundred thou∣sand men against the <HI>Poles;</HI> but that Expedition was not prosperous; he lost above an Hundred thousand men, a∣tempting to force the Camp of Three∣score thousand <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Cosa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks,</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="80"/> Commanded by Prince <HI>Ladislaus. Os∣man</HI> was obliged to make a Peace on disadvantageous Conditions. He thought that the <HI>Janisaries</HI> had much contributed to that unhappy Success, which made him have a mind to ca∣shier them, and he was accused of having a design to remove the seat of the Empire unto <HI>Damascus</HI> in <HI>Syria.</HI> That insolent Militia revolted and the Unfortunate Prince was Strang∣led the 20. of <HI>May,</HI> 1622. dy Order of <HI>Mustapha</HI> his Uncle, whom the same <HI>Janisaries</HI> had raised to the Throne, as I said before. <HI>Osman's</HI> Reign lasted but Four years, and about four Months. Sultan <HI>Osman</HI> took the following Ti∣tles, in a Letter which he wrote at the desire of the most Christian King to Basha <HI>Ferrovi</HI> and to <HI>Mula Cadi</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to restore the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> to the possession of <HI>Bethlehem</HI> and of the Holy Sepulchre in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which places had been possessed by the <HI>Ar∣menians</HI> in the year 1625.</P>

<P><HI>Amurath</HI> IV. was the Son of <HI>Achmet,</HI> and Brother of <HI>Osman;</HI> after the Death of <HI>Achmet,</HI> the <HI>Janisaries</HI> as we have said, put <HI>Mustapha</HI> his Brother upon the Throne, and afterwards having sent him back again to Prison, they crowned <HI>Osman.</HI> But in the sequel the same Insolent Militia re-called <HI>Mustapha,</HI> who caused <HI>Osman</HI> to be strangled, and the Government of that Prince, being disagreeable unto them, they remanded him to Prison. <HI>Amurath</HI> at the Age of fifteen years was saluted Emperor in the Month of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> 1623. and in the year 1626. he besieged <HI>Bagdet;</HI> but the <HI>Persians</HI> de∣fended themselves so vigorously, that in the year 1630. the <HI>Turks</HI> were for∣ced to withdraw. <HI>Amurath</HI> had the Trouble of losing <HI>Hali Basha,</HI> and di∣vers places, which the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Ara∣bians</HI> took from him. Besides that, the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Cossacks,</HI> gave him the allarm so hot, that the <HI>Viziers</HI> were resolved to dethrone him, if the Peace, which he made with these People, had not al∣tered their minds. <HI>Amurath</HI> concerned

<P><HI>Ibrahim,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> was the Son of <HI>Achmet,</HI> and succeeded to his Brother <HI>Amurath</HI> IV. in the year 1640. When this last died the Officers of the Port had a great deal ado, to make him come out of the place where he had been in a manner Prisoner for three or four years, suspecting it to be only a pretext to render him Criminal. The <HI>Sultana</HI> his Mother persuaded him of the truth, having shown him the dead Body of his Brother, he came out, and having been crown'd, he gave himself wholly over to Voluptu∣ousness, which was fatal unto him. The loss of one of his <HI>Sultana</HI>'s, whom the Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> took in the year 1644. betwixt <HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> made him undertake to be revenged on <HI>Malta.</HI> But he turned his Arms a∣gainst <HI>Candie,</HI> and took the <HI>Canea</HI> in 1645. In the mean time he grew cru∣el, his Pleasures made him abandon all care of the Affairs of the Empire, and he became insupportable to all Men.
<PB N="161" REF="82"/> The Militia and Officers conspired a∣gainst him, and sent for the <HI>Mufti</HI> and other considerable Persons of the Law, on design at first to put to Death the <HI>Grand Visier:</HI> Then they resolved to depose <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> who expressing a great Contempt, and much Haughtiness, did so incense those mutinous Spirits, that they strangled him the 18th. of <HI>August</HI> 1649. and placed <HI>Mahomet</HI> his Son up∣on the Throne.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> IV. was Born the second of <HI>January</HI> 1642. and was raised to the Throne ten days after the Death of <HI>Sultan Ibrahim</HI> his Father, who was strangled by the <HI>Janisaries.</HI> In the years 1663. and 1664. He took in <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> the Towns of <HI>Newheusel, Fort-Se∣rin</HI> or <HI>Serin-wart,</HI> afterwards demolish∣ed, and some other places. The loss he sustained at the Battle of <HI>Raab</HI> or <HI>St. Godard</HI> made him resolve to make Peace, which he did the 17th. of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> 1664. He hath been more un∣fortunate in the present War, where∣in he hath lost <HI>Gran, Newheusel</HI> and a great many other strong Places and Battles mentioned before.

<PB N="162" REF="83"/> after a very long and tough Siege. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have taken many impor∣tant Places from him in this War, both in the <HI>Morea</HI> and elsewhere. His great∣est delight is in Hunting, wherein he spends most part of the year. For that reason it is that he resides commonly at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> that he may be near the places where there is most Game. He goes often to <HI>Larissa,</HI> and spends some∣times Eight or Ten Days together un∣der magnificent Tents, pitched half a League from that Town upon the Banks of the <HI>Peneus.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> in his time have made many Conquests from the <HI>Poles,</HI> from whom they have taken <HI>Caminiec,</HI> and some other places. <HI>Sobieski</HI> great Mareshal of the Crown, and at present King of <HI>Poland,</HI> was at that time General of the <HI>Polonian</HI> Ar∣my, who defeated the <HI>Turks</HI> at the Fa∣mous Battle of <HI>Gotzchin</HI> in the year 1673. He eluded their Projects the two years following, and at length re∣duced them to desire a Peace. Since that, the <HI>Turks</HI> undertook a War a∣gainst the <HI>Moscovites,</HI> and got some ad∣vantages over them in the year 1678. and the <HI>Poles</HI> having confederated with
<PB N="163" REF="83"/> the Emperor and Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> in the year 1683. continue to Harass and make head against them in <HI>Podolia, Russia,</HI> and the neighbouring Territo∣ries. These are the Titles that <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> IV. takes to himself.</P>

<P>This Prince <HI>Mahomet</HI> IV. has Chil∣dren: the <HI>Sultana</HI> Queen, who is his chief Wife, brought him his first Son, she is called <HI>Eumenia,</HI> a Greek by Nati∣on; he hath a Brother called <HI>Solyman</HI> and his eldest Brother named <HI>Osman,</HI> is a Dominican Monk, called <HI>Father Dominick of St.</HI> Thomas, who was ta∣ken with his Mother by the Galleys of <HI>Malta</HI> sayling to <HI>Alexandria</HI> upon a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecha.</HI> This Emperor is the greatest Enemy of Christendom: May Heavens grant, that the projects of that Infidel Prince against the Chri∣stian Religion, may be disapointed, and that the proud Empire of the Crescent may one day be subject to the glorious Standard of the Cross, un∣der the Auspices of that great <HI>Caesar,</HI> who under the lovely name of <HI>Leopold</HI> hath merited to be the first, and XIV. Emperor of the most <HI>August</HI> House of <HI>Austria,</HI> who by his great Prudence and exemplary Piety, by his Constant and indefatigable Pains, and by the Grace of the Great God of Armies, hath happily procured to Christendom, all these great Victories to the shame and confusion of that fierce and barbarous common
<PB N="166" REF="85"/> Enemy, and under the Conduct of the Valiant <HI>Charles</HI> IV. Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain,</HI> that brave <HI>Hero,</HI> to whom Chri∣stendom is obliged, that it had time to Relieve <HI>Vienna,</HI> when with unparal∣led Speed he marched thither, and in view of the Enemy supplied the place with Provisions, Ammunition and 12000 of the best men in the Army, who defeated the <HI>Turks</HI> and Rebels before <HI>Presbourg;</HI> that having taken that Town, had a design, to make a Bridge there over the <HI>Danube,</HI> thereby to fa∣cilitate the passage of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Con∣voys to their Camp before <HI>Vienna,</HI> who flew like lightening to save the King of <HI>Poland</HI> from the extream Dan∣ger wherein he was, being engaged with the Body of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army near <HI>Barkan,</HI> and who after gained the Battle of <HI>Barkan</HI> that we mention∣ed before. This is that Prince who considering that his Glorious Prede∣cessors have Reigned in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> when they had driven the <HI>Mahometans</HI> out of it, hath on that occasion given so many Proofs of his Courage, that it may be said he there revived the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Princes, who heretofore Con∣quered
<PB N="167" REF="85"/> the East. He hath spared nei∣ther Body nor Heart in following their Footsteps, that he might Crown him∣self with Glory in the Bloody Battle of <HI>Gran,</HI> which he gained. He is the very same who hath so often repulsed the Fury of the <HI>Turks,</HI> when they were most formidable: It is he, in short, who re-took from the Infidels the strong place of <HI>Newheusel,</HI> which serv∣ed them for a Key to open them a passage farther into the Countries of the Christians, and who after the ex∣ample of the Glorious <HI>Godfrey,</HI> who filled <HI>Europe</HI> with admiration in the year 1096. hath so signalized himself that if he Reign not in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as his Ancestors have done, he Reigns, at least, in the hearts of those, who have been the Spectators of his Fortitude and Prowess.</P>
