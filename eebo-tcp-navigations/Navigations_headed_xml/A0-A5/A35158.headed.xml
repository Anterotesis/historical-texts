<HEAD>To the LORDS Spiritual and Temporal, and COMMONS in Parliament Assembled.</HEAD>
<P>IF we look back, and consider how often, and to how high a degree His Majesty hath expos'd His Royal Person this War; and what immense Sums of Money have been rais'd during the same, upon the Success whereof not only the well-being of this Kingdom, but the Happiness of <HI>Europe</HI> depends; one would then conceive the very Apprehension of these things was sufficient to beget a generous Principle in all Persons in Places of Trust, and an Emulation in every Man to outvy each other in Acts of Duty and Loyalty: But they have had a quite different Effect; for many Persons in whom the King hath repos'd great Trust, (forgetting their Duty) have during the Course of this War misrepresented Persons and Things to His Majesty, and made a Prey of the Pub∣lick; and the better to cover and carry on their wicked Designs, have dispensed with the Law, perverted Judgment and Justice, pu∣nished innocent Persons for doing their Duty; and preferred Cri∣minals, to the great Hazard of the Common Safety: and from whence it is the Nation is now become so much in Debt.</P>
<P>All these Evils would I have twice laid open the last Session of Parliament; but was both times prevented by unjust and illegal Means, which causes me now to address my self to this most August Assembly for Relief: These Corruptions being, I conceive, of much more dangerous Consequence to the Government, (considering what a Faction there's in the Bowels of the Nation) than the War it self; having taken such deep root, and grown to that height, and so strongly supported, as not to be remedied but in Parliament.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
<P>I humbly conceive there's no Age can produce greater Instances of Oppression and Injustice, than what the Nation now labours un∣der, and which in part are here set forth: But God hath not left us without Means, Ability, and Opportunity of removing these Evils; for there are great and remarkable Instances of Persons (who have been found corrupt, and have made a Breach of their Trust) that have been censur'd in Parliament; and it's they who are truly and properly the Great Council (and Physician) of the Nation; and as the Effect of whose great Wisdom and Prudence, we now en∣joy our Religion and Laws, and the Government hath been kept so long upon its Basis. And when God is pleas'd to make publick Examples of some Men, and to punish them for their Cruelty and Oppression, in such Cases he often makes use of weak and mean In∣struments for the bringing his Purposes to pass; that so the World may (as it were) visibly see the hand of Providence: But I am not unsensible of my own Inability to manage so great an Ʋnder∣taking as that is in which I have engag'd my self, considering the great Interest and Power of my Adversaries: So I have nothing to depend upon but the Justice of my Cause, the Goodness and Sta∣bility of our Laws, and the Honour of the Representatives of the Nation; which I humbly conceive will not be wanting to protect me, being able by Substantial Evidence to prove what I have set forth. I am, my Lords and Gentlemen,</P>

<P>ALL Nations, even the most barbarous, have ever been jea∣lous of their Liberty; and have rather chose to die fighting in the Field, than be in Bondage to their Ad∣versaries: And in the dark and elder Times of the World, we have Instances of Persons that have sacrific'd their own Lives for the Liberty and Safety of their Native Country; who are to be admir'd and pity'd, but not imitated: Yet Nature hath stamp'd upon the Minds of all Men, an Affection to their Native Soil; and those who have deviated from it, have ever been look'd upon as Monsters, and treated accordingly. Now, notwithstand∣ing the manifest Danger the Government hath lain under during this War, it will appear that many Persons in Places of the greatest Trust, have fallen from their Duty, and used sinister and indirect Means to inrich themselves, to the great waste of the Publick Trea∣sure, and hazard of the Common Safety of the Nation: And those whom I accuse to have so done, are the Right Honourable the Lords of the Admiralty, Commissioners of the Navy, and the Com∣missioners for the Sick and Wounded, and exchanging Prisoners at War. But before I enter upon any Matter relating to any of these Commissions, I shall insert a Copy of a Deposition of a certain Merchant which was laid before the Lords of the Admiralty, and is as followeth.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="deposition">
<P><HI>H. B.</HI> of <HI>Gosport</HI> Merchant, maketh Oath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Deposition with several o∣thers, (being be∣fore the Publick Staters of Ac∣compts) I did desire might be produced, but it could not be ob∣tained; for which reason I print it.</NOTE> That he hath been an Inhabitant in the Parish of <HI>Alverstoke</HI> about Twenty eight Years; and his House lying about half a Mile from the Water-side, and about a Mile and a half up the Harbour, he did for some Years serve their Majesties Stores at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> with Rozin and Oil, and several other things: During which time, he hath often observ'd the Stores of that Yard were embezzled in considerable quantities, having met with several sorts in his walks: And doth upon his Oath acknowledg, that he hath dealt for some thousands of Pounds as his Neighbours have done in that Nature, that the Custom of that Yard running on, and ra∣ther improving for this three Years last past: And this Depo∣nent finding great quantities was daily carried up and down a∣bout
<PB N="6" REF="4"/> Town, and other places; and several Lads bringing up the Mill-Lake some Pitch and Tar at a distance from this Deponent's House, and offering him the same to sale: after several times he question'd where they had it; and one of them, by name <HI>John Hows,</HI> own'd to him they had it out of the King's Stores: He gave them fair warning of such a dangerous Trade, and forthwith went and inform'd the Commissioner. And this Deponent farther saith, That he received fourteen Barrels of Tar from Capt. <HI>Richard New,</HI> Foreman of the Yard; of which fourteen Barrels, the Commis∣sioner stop'd four, which he this Deponent sent over to <HI>Ports∣mouth.</HI> Upon which, some Question arising before the Commissio∣ner about 27 Barrels of Tar, said to be lost out of the Yard; and he taking the four Barrels to be part of them, order'd them to be carried into Stores, notwithstanding the said <HI>New</HI> own'd to have had the fourteen Barrels aforesaid, and clear'd the same to him at the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> in the name of one <HI>Thomas Grant.</HI> And this Deponent farther saith, That it was here observable, that he the said <HI>New,</HI> did very unwillingly own the Delivery of them to this Deponent before the Commissioner, till he was brought under a Necessity so to do. And farther he saith, When he inform'd the Commissioner, he used great Freedom with him, and remarked to him what Passages had fallen under his Observa∣tion; and told him unless greater Care was taken, the Nation would groan under its Burden before the War was half over; and that those Goods could not be carried off without the Consent of the Watch: And farther, he admir'd how the Store-keeper could pass his Accompts. To which, in a slighting manner, he told him, this Deponent, it was all stuff. He farther insisted, the great Ones set on the little Ones; and as it was none of this Deponent's Concern, he did not desire to bring Mens Names in question, but that it was great pity things was not better look'd after. To which he reply'd, He desir'd as little trouble as might be; and de∣sir'd to bring no body in question, and car'd not a Fart for the Service, nor how soon he was out of the Place, for he hinder'd himself more than his Salary in another Way: That in two or three days after, the Commissioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Captain</HI> Wilshaw.</NOTE> sent for this Deponent, and told him his Business was to consine him aboard a Yatch: Upon which he desir'd to know his Crime, and whether Bail might not be taken: To which he said no. Then he asked him who accused him? He answered, that <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Jonas Pod</HI> had sworn they
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> had sold this Deponent several Barrels of Pitch and Tar which they stole out of the Stores: And this Deponent desired to see them; and the Commissioner own'd he had given them leave to go away, but he had the Charge against him, this Deponent, un∣der their Hands and Seals. To which this Deponent told him, then he must have leave to say two things: First, that he was a Knave to his Trust, for letting the Principals run away: And Se∣condly, a Fool for expecting to father their Rogueries upon him. And farther, this Deponent saith, That the said Commissioner swore he would stop his this Deponent's Mouth; and came to him, and told him he was such a Prisoner as was seldom or never heard of, for he should eat, drink, and lie with him, and that he would not part with him this Deponent till he had brought him into a better Humour, or words to this effect: and accordingly car∣ried him this Deponent to his House to Dinner, and there took Recognizance for his Appearance; but where, this Deponent knows not. And this Deponent farther saith, That he being in∣form'd by <HI>John Hows</HI> and others, that a Parcel of the best Deals, and some Transom Windows, was carried out of the Yard to <HI>Pri∣ory</HI> in the <HI>Isle of Wight:</HI> In which this Deponent being willing to satisfy himself, went to the House, and bought four Load of Wheal of the Man that liv'd there: And then viewing the House, saw a quantity of very sine <HI>Prussia</HI> Deals sawed, one Part for Wainscot, the other for Flowers, and a great deal of other Stuff. And he this Deponent enquired of the Farmer, whether they were to be sold? And he told him they were sent there to repair the House. And this Deponent farther saith, That the Second Day of <HI>August</HI> 1691, one <HI>David Aldridge</HI> came to this Deponent's House, being on a Sunday; and he this Deponent just going to Church, the said <HI>Aldridge</HI> desir'd him to drink with him, for that he had something to say to him this Deponent: Upon which, he invited him into his own House; and sitting down with him, af∣ter they had drank, there passed the following Discourse between them. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> says Mr. <HI>Aldridge,</HI> I hear you and the Commissio∣ner had a sad Clash on Thursday last, and every one says you did him Justice, for certainly he's the greatest Rogue that ever came into the Place; and had lost his Commission not long ago, when Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI> charg'd him with the Business of the Hawser stop'd at <HI>Post-Bridg,</HI> but that he the said <HI>Aldridge</HI> was prevail'd with by the Commissioner and some others, to say it was only about ten Fa∣thom
<PB N="8" REF="5"/> of an old Hawser, fit only for Paper-stuff, and worth but two Shillings six Pence <HI>per</HI> hundred; when in truth he averr'd it to him this Deponent, to be as good as a new Hawser, cut into fifteen Fathom pieces, for conveniency of being open'd, and worth a great deal more Money, which he the said <HI>Aldridge</HI> declar'd he must have own'd if he had been put upon his Oath: But he was met with by Capt. <HI>Wilshaw,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Southern</HI> and others, and per∣swaded to say what he did, not being upon Oath.</P>

</DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P>This Deposition sufficiently discovers to what a sad Pass the Na∣tion is brought, in having the Publick Stores embezzled, and those concerned in't that by Duty and Oath are oblig'd to preserve them. I shall not now go about to say how ill a Man Capt. <HI>Wilshaw</HI> is; it does so manifestly appear in this, and other of his Actions, that he has sav'd me the labour of doing it.</P>
<P>But I shall make it obvious to the World, that what he has done is but agreeable to the Practice of the Majority of the Commissioners of the Navy, who have either notoriously wronged the King, or have all a long supported others that have done it.</P>
<P>But as I have charged three Commissions with making a Breach of their Duty and Trust, so I shall relate something in relation to each Commission, yet no more than what has already (for the most part) been laid before the Lords of the Admiralty upon Oath, (tho hitherto stifled;) and what has not, I am ready to make ap∣pear by good and substantial Evidence, and shall be as brief as po∣sible in relating these things; and so only lay down the nature of the Crimes, and some of the Facts that have been committed by each Commission; and afterwards give an Account by what Way and Means I was prevented laying open these things the last Session of Parliament.</P>
<P>Yet the Matters were so transacted, that I cannot put them is that Order I would, but shall place them in the best Method I can; and first lay down the evil Practices committed in the King's Yards.</P>
<P>It is the general Practice in the King's Yards, for the Joiners and other Workmen, to be imploy'd in making of Tables, Chests of Drawers, Scrutores, and other Goods, out of His Majesty's Ma∣terials, and this by Order of the Chief Officers of the said Yards. And the Officers do employ Men for making Models of Ships, (and
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> other Works) some of which may be worth 2 or 300 Pounds, that are given away or sold. The Iron Work is weigh'd in to the King twice or thrice over;<NOTE PLACE="marg">This prov'd be∣fore the Lords of the Admiralty upon Oath.</NOTE> and it is the daily and open Practice of the Workmen and Labourers, to split new Timber and Plank for Fi∣ring, for the Officers of the Yards and themselves.</P>
<P>I shall also relate some Matters referring to the Commissioners of the Navy.</P>
<P>A certain Contract was made with a Merchant on behalf of the King for Stores for the Use of his Majesty's Navy, but the Goods delivered were not of half the Value as by Contract they ought to have been: Yet notwithstanding they were received by order of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Captain</HI> Wilshaw.</NOTE> Commissioner upon the place; but an Officer of Trust seeing how grosly His Majesty was abus'd therein, would not admit of it: upon which the Commissioner highly threatned him, and in some measure oblig'd him to a Compliance; which was to His Majesty's Damage two or three hundred Pounds.</P>
<P>Another Contract was made, and great part of the King's Tim∣ber brought into the Yard as Merchants Goods; which an Officer by the Yard observing, refus'd to receive: Whereupon a great Dispute hapned between the said Officer, and the Commissioner and other Officers, who were all very angry with him that he should dispute the Matter; and never left the Affair till they had gain'd their End, which was to His Majesty's very great Loss.</P>
<P>Another fraudulent Contract was made on behalf of the King; wherein a Person's Hand was forged, (a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>Captain <HI>Wilshaw.</HI></P>
<P>All prov'd up∣on Oath before the Lords of the Admiralty.</P></NOTE> Commissioner being con∣cern'd) but they were detected therein; yet His Majesty suffer'd 2 or 300 Pound Damage, and had much more had it not been disco∣vered.</P>
<P>A great deal more of this nature might be recited, but I think here are sufficient Instances to convince all Men of the evil Practices of the Navy-board in reference to Contracts.</P>
<P>But to proceed; Sometime after the Embezlement of the King's Stores in <HI>Portsmouth</HI>-Yard broke out, the Commissioners of the Na∣vy were at the Admiralty-board; and then and there did approve of the Prosecution of such Persons as had embezled the King's Stores, tho before they had done what in them lay to prevent those Discoveries; and used their utmost Endeavour to ruin the Gentleman that was the occasion of bringing those Deeds of Dark∣ness to Light, tho the Facts were so plain they could no longer withstand it: But before that Matter came to trial, there were
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> far greater Discoveries; wherein most of the Officers of <HI>Portsmouth</HI>-Yard were concerned, as likewise some Commissioners of the Navy (as has been related;) so that when the Trial at the <HI>King's Bench</HI> Bar came on, they appear'd in a body in the face of Justice to bring off the Criminals (whose Prosecution they had before ap∣prov'd); which they effected by setting up a false Book of Loans, and thereby impos'd upon the Court and Jury, (then the Attorney-General could do no less than bring a <HI>Noli Prosequi</HI> to stop all far∣ther Proceedings, His Majesty having been at vast Charge in that Prosecution and no good ensued upon it); so that there were three other Informations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Wherein a mul∣titude of Persons were concerned as Offenders.</NOTE>, which at that time were dropt, and nothing done therein to this time.</P>
<P>There's another Business also of the very same Nature: The Mayor of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> was fin'd 200 <HI>l.</HI> at <HI>Winchester</HI> Assizes for not returning the Recognizance in his hands: Upon which the Com∣missioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Capt. <HI>Wil∣shaw</HI> now Com∣missioner in the <HI>Straits.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> sends an Attorney along with the Mayor to go after the Judg to <HI>Salisbury;</HI> where he interceded with the Judg in the Name and by the Order of the Commissioner to excuse the Fine, which was accordingly done, and the Commissioner bore all the Charge of that Journey;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All prov'd up∣on Oath before the Lords of the Ad∣miralty.</NOTE> and the very original Note the Attorney gave him of the Charge, is now in the hands of the Lords of the Admiralty: So this Affair as well as the other fell, and never came to any thing.</P>
<P>I shall relate another Passage of near kin to the foregoing: A certain Person here in Town, a Sail-maker by Trade, apply'd him∣self to Sir <HI>Richard Haddock</HI> Comptroller of the Navy, and acquaint∣ed him that there were very great Embezlements made of the King's Canvas, to that degree that it was a very great Injury to the Trade in general, by being under sold: And he told the Comp∣troller how and by what Means the Persons might be taken with the Goods upon them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov'd upon Oath before a Commission of Council.</NOTE> and if he would grant him a Commission, he said he would undertake the Matter himself: And after near an hour's Discourse, Sir <HI>Richard</HI> slighted it, telling him, That Kings and Princes were born to be cheated; and so there was nothing done therein.</P>
<P>And for Satisfaction of the Navy-board, I can shew a large List of Seizures that have been made (no ways relating to the <HI>Portsmouth</HI> Business), yet no Prosecution either against Buyer or Seller.</P>
<P>But during these Contests, in reference to the Embezlements of <HI>Portsmouth</HI>-Yard, it must be acknowledged the Lords of the Admi∣ralty
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> gave all imaginable Encouragement to such as were instru∣mental in those Discoveries, with assurance of their Favour; which they enjoyed so long as the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> my Lord <HI>Cornwallis</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Onsloe,</HI> were in Commission: but when their Lordships and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> left that Board, the Scene soon chang'd, and the Interest of the Navy-board prevail'd: Yet in the end, notwithstanding all the ill Actions of the Commissioners of the Navy, their Lordships might have dismist all such Officers their Employment (being under their Jurisdiction) as appeared to be Criminal, and thereby given a great check to those horrid Embezlements that were made; yet nothing was done therein: But on the contrary, the Commissioners of the Navy fell with great Vi∣olence upon those Gentlemen who had made those Discoveries, and suspended them their Employments; and there was Subordination endeavour'd and set on foot by a Commissioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Captain</HI> Wilshaw.</NOTE>, and other foul Practices used against them (too long here to insert) whereby to throw them out of their Employments; which after some time they did effect, yet no Crime (but their Faithfulness to His Majesty and their Trust) could be prov'd against them: And the Lords of the Admiralty, who ought to have protected them from the Violence of the Navy-board, slighted them, and turn'd them off with all imaginable Scorn and Contempt; and, to add to their Affliction, many of the most notorious Criminals were preferr'd.</P>
<P>The Navy-board having by these foul and wicked Means crush'd all those Persons that had made any Discoveries of embezled Stores, there must from thence consequently ensue infinite Em∣bezlements; and from that time I find not any Officer hath dar'd to oppose them, who have ever since acted as they please without Controll.</P>
<P>But to proceed; Sometime after these unjust Successes of the Navy-board, one Mr. <HI>George Everet,</HI> Shipwright, observing the great Abuses committed in the King's Yards by the Mens wasting their Time, and their daily Destruction of Timber and Plank, appli∣ed to the Lords of the Admiralty; and made a Proposal to them whereby to save His Majesty 100000 <HI>l.</HI> or more <HI>per Annum</HI> in the building and repairing the Royal Navy; and gave such Demonstra∣tion and Reason for what he said, that the Proposal had a general Acceptation, (being printed, and dedicated to the King and Parlia∣ment;) yet notwithstanding, he met with little Encouragement (as will appear by the Journal he has kept) from the Admiralty-board,
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> being from time to time delayed: But after much Impor∣tunity and Waiting, was referred to the Navy-board, before whom he often offered to prove the great Destruction and Waste made of the King's Timber; and at one time produced twelve Witnesses to prove the same, but they would hear but three of them, and very much ridicul'd what he offer'd, and threatned him with an Action of Scandal, whereby to cause him to desist: which not pre∣vailing, and he not being under their Jurisdiction, they found them∣selves oblig'd to make a Report, (it being then a Year and a half after he made his Proposal) which was transmitted to the Admi∣ralty: But Mr. <HI>Everett</HI> was not permitted a Copy of it till half a Year after; and tho' it's too long here to insert, yet it will appear how scandalous it was by the Memorial he deliver'd in answer to it, which is as followeth.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="deposition">
<HEAD>The humble Memorial of <HI>George Everett.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To the Lords of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council appointed a Com∣mittee of Trade and Plantations.</NOTE>THAT the said <HI>George Everett</HI> having received a Copy of the Navy-board's Report, which their Honours made to the Lords of the Admiralty in answer to my Proposals; and finding the same very large, and full of Reflections, Prevarications, and manifest Falshoods, a full Answer to which I have drawn up rea∣dy to produce: Yet I cannot conceive they would presume to offer such a Report to the Admiralty, or this most Honourable Board, unless with a Design to bring this matter to so great a Bulk, with long Reports, Answers and Replies, as to make your Lordships weary in examining into my Proposal, tho of so great Advantage to the Publick Good: Therefore to save your Lord∣ships much needless trouble, I shall here recite only three Parti∣culars in the Navy-board's Report; which if true, my Proposals ought wholly to be set aside, and I to suffer worse Punishment than the Navy-board have already threatned to inflict upon me; which three Particulars are as followeth.</P>
<P>The Navy-board about the middle of their Report, express themselves in these words:</P>
<Q>What Care is taken to prevent the Making and Carrying out any un∣lawful Ships, the Instructions before recited have inform'd your Ho∣nours,
<PB N="13" REF="8"/> which is hoped is duly executed by the Officers; but if any of them are wanting therein, we should be glad to know it, being altogether as willing to punish as reward, well knowing that on those Hinges hang the good Management of the Affairs of the Navy.</Q>
<P>'And about the next Leaf they also say these words:</P>
<P>And in case in his Observations any of them have acted other ways, <HI>(meaning the Officers of the Yards, or others, in embezling the Materials of old Ships)</HI> and he had thought sit to have discover'd, and made it appear to us, he would certainly have met with sutable Rewards, and Encouragement for it.</P>
<P>To which I answer, That I never declar'd the whole was em∣bezled, but a great part of it; and in order to prove this, I did on the Fourteenth of <HI>May</HI> last, lay before the Commissioners of the Navy a Note containing the Names of near forty Witnesses to prove these and other Miscarriages committed in His Majesty's Yards: Which being read, their Honours answer'd, that the Surveyor was not in Town, and that the same could not be deter∣mined without a full Board.</P>
<P>After this I received a Letter from the Navy-board in these words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

</LETTER>
<P>Pursuant to this Order, I did on the 23d of <HI>June</HI> (being Satur∣day) attend the Navy-board in the Morning, with twelve Per∣sons, most of them Master-Shipwrights, in order to prove the
<PB N="14" REF="9"/> said irregular and extravagant Practices: But two of them and my self, being only admitted, we did testify part thereof, and had a clamorous Debate of near three hours, till by degrees the Commissioners all departed, leaving one of the Evidences in the Board-Room, without order of withdrawing, or farther at∣tending.</P>
<P>This my Attendance was the 23d of <HI>June,</HI> and the Navy-board's Report is dated the 27th of <HI>June,</HI> which is four days after; wherein their Honours pretended they had not heard of any of these Miscarriages.</P>
<P>The third Particular is near the end of their Report; wherein the Commissioners of the Navy express themselves in these words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Nevertheless this Wiseaker says there may be <HI>100000</HI> l. a Year saved of what is now expended in the Navy in Shipwrightry, and Timber and Plank, if his Regulations, as he calls them, were put in execu∣tion; tho upon our computing the whole Charge of such Workmanship for all the six Yards together, with the Expence of Timber and Plank since the War, (which we have taken the pains to collect) we do not find the same amount to that Sum one Year with another.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>To which I answer, that this is a home Assertion, and strikes at the very foundation of my Proposal, and would represent me as a mad Man, that disturbs your Lordships and the Nation with Proposals to save 100000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year out of a less Sum: But I que∣stion not but to confute the Navy-board under their own hands and bring them as Witnesses against themselves. Therefore I most humbly pray, that the Commissioners of Accompts may be directed to lay before your Lordships an Account of the annual Charge of Building and Repairing the Royal Navy since the be∣ginning of the War; and likewise to direct the Lords of the Admiralty to lay before your Lordships a true Copy of the Esti∣mate for the same Service, which their Lordships laid before the House of Commons for the Year ensuing: For I may presume to assert, that the Building and Reparing the Royal Navy, has for the Years past, and will for the Year ensuing, cost the King a∣bove four hundred thousand Pound <HI>per Annum:</HI> All which your Lordships will find attested under the Commissioners of the Navy's own Hands, if your Lordships will please to send for the aforemention'd Accompts and Estimate.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
<P>May it please your Lordships, if herein I have said that which is false of the Navy-board, I am content to lose all the Labour and Expence I have been at, and that my Proposals should be wholly rejected as false and scandalous: But if on the contrary, their Honours Report proves to be as I have here represented it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Their Lordships were pleas'd to look upon the Navy-board's Report to be scandalous.</NOTE>, <HI>viz.</HI> full of Falsities and Prevarications, to weary and im∣pose upon your Lordships to set aside Proposals that may be so beneficial to the Publick Good and Safety of the Nation; then I shall humbly leave to your Lordships Justice, what Censure to pass on the Navy-board, for making such a Report to obstruct the King's Service; which is sign'd by no less than eight of their Members<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">R. Haddock, E. Dummer, G. Sergison, Tho. Wilshaw, D. Liddall, J. Hill, S. Pett, G. S. Loe.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>There's no rational Man but will conclude this Proposal of Mr. <HI>Everett</HI>'s practicable, tho the Navy-board took indirect Means to crade it.</P>
<P>In short, the Design of his Proposal is no other but to root out all those Evils which Custom, and the Corruption of the Age hath produced; and no ways to alter the Oeconomy of the Navy, (as is insinuated in the Lords of the Admiralty, and Commissioners of the Navy's Reports upon his Proposal:) So that had it been put in pra∣ctice, by this time His Majesty might have sav'd three or four hun∣dred thousand Pound. And for the Commissioners of the Navy to assert the Building and Repairing of the Royal Navy did not an∣nually amount to 100000 <HI>l.</HI> (which plainly appears to be a preva∣ricating with Mr. <HI>Everett</HI>'s words) when they knew at the same time the Estimate given into the House of Commons for the Wear and Tare of the Royal Navy for this present Year, was 780000 <HI>l.</HI> as appears by the Votes of the House of Commons, is a most noto∣rious Falshood. One would therefore think, any Man that had the least spark of Honour or Justice in him, would have been ashamed to sign such a Report: And why the Lords of the Admiralty should keep it so long by them, and not acquaint His Majesty there∣with, I know not; however, it's plain it was never intended it should have seen the light, it being forced from them, and the de∣sign being to weary out the Man, that he might waste and spend his Substance, and so be forced to decline. A most effectual Way in∣deed, and sufficient warning to all Men to take care how they
<PB N="16" REF="10"/> offer any thing for the Publick Service, tho never so advantagious. Besides this Proposal, Mr. <HI>Everett</HI> hath made appear, by a cloud of Witnesses, the great Embezlements made in the King's Yards, and proved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Before a Com∣mittee of Council.</NOTE> many things in the face of the Commissioners of the Navy, and made them eat and drink Shame: Yet still they stand as firm as a Rock, and say they have done no evil.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sailors be∣ing inhumanly and barbarously trea∣ted, is the only true Cause why they so much de∣cline the Publick Service.</NOTE>The poor Sailers that venture their Lives and Limbs to serve their King and Country, and who are one of the greatest Bulwarks of the Kingdom, have been all along most inhumanly and barba∣rously treated, and they and their Families reduced to a miserable and deplorable State, particularly by the wicked Practices of put∣ting Queries and Runs upon their pay: For amongst those great numbers that are set on Shore sick, those that die, and others that continue sick above thirty days, and those sent to the <HI>London,</HI> Ho∣spitals for cure, who are thereby disabled to return to their Ships, are for the most part made run: Others, whose Ships are sailed before recovery, having gone on Board other Ships, are prick'd run from the Ship they were sent from; and if a Seaman is turn'd over from Ship to Ship, and by that means has serv'd on Board four or five Ships in the Navy, yet if he happens to be prick'd run in the last Ship he serv'd in, he shall of consequence be prick'd run in all the preceding Ships. By this means a Query or Run takes away a Man's Pay worse than an Execution; and by the present Practice, no Seaman, or his poor Family, is at any certainty of having the Benefit of the King's Pay; for it is in the Power of the Captain, Captain's Clerk, Purser, Clerk of the Cheque, Muster-Master, or Clerks in the Navy-Office, when ever they please, to put a Run or Query upon any Seaman's Pay, without giving Reason for so doing, or the Name of the Person that put it: So that for these black pieces of Robbery, no one is liable to be called to accompt; but the poor Sailer is kept wholly in the dark, and he or his Wife may wait at the Navy-Office Month after Month, with Petitions to no purpose, till he has spent all his Substance: And when he begins to talk of his being thus cheated and robbed, he is threatned to be tried for his Life as a Mutineer. So that the Barbarity the poor Sailors do, and have suffered during this War, is unexpressible: The Blood of thou∣sands of Families are poured out as Sacrifices to the Covetousness of those whose Duty and Place it is to be their Guardians and Pro∣tectors. By all which it's plain, that whatever good Laws may be made for the Increase and Encouragement of Seamen, will prove in∣effectual so long as these Practices continue.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
<P>These Grievances have been at large set forth in Print by one Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> and a Scheme of their true Cause laid barefac'd be∣fore the Admiralty by Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI> in a Letter, and a Remedy for them propos'd in Writing to the Admiralty by Mr. <HI>Gibson</HI> by order of a Committee of Council; and why there's nothing done, but this Fraud and Robbery still practised and supported, is what no reason can be given for.</P>
<P>Since neither Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI>'s, nor Mr. <HI>Gibson</HI>'s Papers before mention'd, have ever been exploded; the Lords of the Treasury were so fully convinced of these Cheats, that their Lord∣ships did by Warrant under their Hands in <HI>December</HI> last, appoint Mr. <HI>Gibson</HI> to receive all Informations of Abuses in Paiment of Sea∣mens Tickets, which doubtless would have put a stop to these wic∣ked Practices: Notwithstanding which, the said Mr. <HI>Gibson</HI> has ne∣ver been suffered to act, and so their Lordships good Intentions have been wholly defeated: But why their Lordships have not been able to put their own Orders in execution, is another strange thing to me.</P>
<P>I shall now lay down Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI>'s Letter, (before mention'd) by which the Reader will be satisfied as to the Humour and Temper of these Gentlemen, and after what rate things are and have been carried on: It is as followeth.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="deposition">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving consider'd your Lordships Commands (to wit), That I lay before your Honourable Board a Proposal to pre∣vent false Tickets and Powers for the future, I find my self oblig'd humbly to represent the following Particulars, in order to satisfy your Lordships therein so far as I may at present, not be∣ing willing to take on my Shoulders (who am so much loaded already) such a burden as an effectual Proposal to that purpose must be: Therefore to let your Lordships see I am no Stranger to that Practice, such Proceedings have been open'd to me long since by Officers of several Ships; one of which, whose Con∣science was more tender, I remember told me, He trembled when he sign'd the Ships Books, and considered what the Consequence of a Discovery of this Practice might amount to; and gave me several Instances, telling me he must pass them or be ruined; and that he was well inclin'd to lay down his Employment to be
<PB N="18" REF="12"/> no longer under such Circumstances: Others declaring there was a Trade in fashion, and they would take share in it.</P>
<P>Your Lordships must find large Demonstrations of it by what has passed, as well relating to the <HI>Mary</HI> as other Ships: The Distemper so well known, a Proposal for the effectual preventing of it for the future carries no other difficulty with it than the Burden of the Interest against it, and might at any time have been redressed by just Men of no boasted Skill in Business. And, my Lords, I think there are two at hand from the nature of the Crimes, and their being carry'd on so long: One of which I shall open to your Lordships, because 'tis pertinent (in my weak Judgment) to the other Matters I lately laid before your Ho∣nourable Board. For the second, I pray leave to withhold it for the foregoing Reason; and because, as I would not plow with any Man's Heifer but my own, so am I not blameable to secure to my self if I can, some part of my dear-bought Experience, till it shall be my Duty to reform what I know to be amiss, and can therein be supported.</P>
<P>Now, my Lords, it's most manifest that these Practices are not wholly carried on by a Combination of the Officers on Board Ships, (as is alledged) who cover these Crimes to avoid their own ruin, many of them to my Knowledg detesting the Trade: It being well known what is, and has been the Practice of the Navy-Office, that if any such Tickets and Powers happen not to be in the hands of any relating to that Office, yet such may be found with their under-hand Agents, who tho of little Substance of their own, yet can buy up three or four thousand Pound value in Tickets, that being the only way such Frauds can long pass, and such true or false meet with no Obstruction: But if any Complaint happens, 'tis no easy matter to have Right done; which is as plain as the Forgery in <HI>Gawler</HI>'s Bills<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Prov'd before the Lords of the Admiralty.</NOTE>, tho committed in the Navy-Office, nevertheless gave occasion to the Commis∣sioners of the Navy to promote the very Actor to be Clerk of the Cheque at <HI>Sheerness,</HI> to avoid other Matters like to break upon him, where he may carry on the Trade at pleasure.</P>
<P>And if this be the case, which I presume does fully appear, the most effectual Remedy against the Disease is to remove the Cause, I mean such of the Commissioners of the Navy who have advo∣cated, and passed by knowingly, and with design, notorious Crimes already discovered; and that done, there will remain no
<PB N="19" REF="12"/> difficulty to form what must put a period to these Cheats, and all ground of such lamentable Complaints as your Lordships and the Government have been long troubled with.</P>
<P>All which arise from the barbarous Usage the innocent Subject have had, and a want of Tendency to their Complaints, and from false and designed Representations of Matters; the Guilty being protected, excused, and carried through most scandalous and obvious Offences against the Law, and afterwards encoura∣ged: which your Lordships find to be the Practice of the Com∣missioners of the Navy, by what I have long since and now lately laid before you; in particular, that of the Testimony of the Town-Clerk of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> wherein your Lordships find a Com∣missioner, after having used his utmost Skill to stifle so necessary a Discovery, paying the very Charges of disappointing the Go∣vernment, and getting off a Fine of 200 <HI>l.</HI> the better to conceal his own and others Crimes.</P>
<P>Now, my Lords, I must pray leave to relate, as well for the Information of such of your Members as were not of your Board, as for reminding such as were at the opening of my Case, and on the Proceeds of the Design against me by the Navy-board; they no less earnestly justified the well and regular Management of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> Yard, than furiously prosecuted me, the better to cover the Miscarriages I insisted on: In which it also lies prov'd before your Honourable Board, I rejected an Offer of two hun∣dred Pounds Bribe to pass them, the Person who made me that Tender (with other Accommodations) being nevertheless pro∣tected and preferred by them, tho it's plain both he and his Bro∣ther have from nothing advanced themselves to great Estates by such undue Proceedings: and I was not only advis'd if I desisted in that Matter, I should be quieted in my Imploy, but in the very heat of the Prosecution against me the Expedient to silence all that Affair, was propos'd to me, to bring Capt. <HI>Wilshaw</HI> to one of my Friends, and set him to rights there: Which being out of my power, it was carried on with the more Heat and Resolution against me: And at the opening of the Embezlements there, which I had all along complained of, then did meer Shame (for I cannot take it any otherways) occasion the Navy-board to own the Miscarriages of <HI>Portsmouth</HI>-Yard to be great, and to recom∣mend me by the Mouth of Mr. <HI>Sergison</HI> for Encouragement.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
<P>Which was very surprizing after a Design grounded on most palpable Perjury, and so scandalous a Representation thereof, yet worse than the Perjury it self, from that Board.</P>
<P>And after all this to find several of the Commissioners of the Navy, in the face of Justice, bringing off Criminals by a Sham-Book of Loans, and thereby encouraging such shameful Actions, and persecuting such as appear'd on the King's Part, even to the Death and Ruin of some, must surely aggravate these great Mis∣carriages, when it so plainly appears the King is thus cheated by Authority.</P>
<P>I come now, my Lords, to the particular Crimes your Lord∣ships have before you; which the Commissioners of the Navy have stifled or forgiven, contrary to Law; it being a common Practice, and of which there are not wanting yet more In∣stances.</P>
<P>And next to the Discovery made by the Rope-makers, in which the poor Men think they have made a fair step to their own Ruin; however, if it be follow'd it may put a great stop to that Trade.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, so long as there are Commissioners intrusted, who on such Occasions brand Discoverers for Informers, Rogues, and Villains, (tho they pursue Orders and Instructions) and in∣courage their being treated as the worst of Men, setting up false and scandalous Informations against them, what end can be put to these Miscarriages? Or till there is less Pride and Design at the Navy-Office, more Honesty, and a Readiness to hear, and relieve or satisfy all Complaints, without the accustomed Formality and Extorts of Money, with Attendance Month after Month to no purpose, it's not to be imagined any effectual Remedy can be applied. I am now humbly to pray that your Lordships will please to make report<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">To a Commit∣tee of Council.</NOTE> of what I have laid before your Honourable Board; upon which I depend your Lordships in Justice will take occasion to re∣commend me for my Services, in being the Original and only Instrument in the way of my Duty, hardy enough to break through and bring on these Discoveries, and exposing my self and Family in the Execution of your Orders, to the great Persecution and Pressure we have long lain under;
<PB N="21" REF="13"/> that so my Integrity may not effect the Ruin that has been indu∣striously endeavour'd by the Trading Multitude, Upon,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your Lordships most faithful humble Servant, <HI>John Trevor.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P>I shall now give farther Demonstration of evil Practices in rela∣tion to the Navy, by referring to what was published by order of the Lords of the Admiralty, as appears by the <HI>Gazette</HI> of the 7th of <HI>January</HI> 1694, which is as followeth:</P>
<Q>WHereas in pursuant of an Advertisement in the Gazette of the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>December</HI> last, a Paper sign'd <HI>R. W.</HI> has been sent to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, offering to discover several Frauds and illegal Proceedings relating to Seamens Pay, in case His Majesty shall be graciously pleas'd to extend His Pardon to the said <HI>R. W.</HI> and others that come in with him to make out the said Discoveries, for as much as they have been concerned in the said Offences: His Majesty being mov'd there∣upon, is pleas'd to promise His gracious Pardon to the said <HI>R. W.</HI> and these concern'd with him in the said Offences; Provided they make out the said Discoveries, and that they have not been guilty of any thing of the like Nature before.</Q>
<P>There are four or five of these Advertisements in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> some of them by order of the Commissioners of the Navy, but all of them to the same purpose: And any Man that has but half an Eye, may see a great deal of Fallacy in them, and that they have only the face of Justice, and were never intended to make Disco∣veries, but prevent them; as appears by the Clause at last, <HI>and that they have not been guilty of any thing of the like Nature before.</HI> Very pretty; there's no Man living but must conclude, that those whose Conscience will permit them to act such things, have long practised them; and 'tis not probable they will ever make Disco∣veries unless they can sit down secure, and have an ample and full Pardon: Therefore this does but encourage all those that are guil∣ty of these Practices, to proceed in the same, none being secure that shall go about to detect them.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
<P>Two of these Advertisements I read at the Bar of the House of Commons the last Session of Parliament, (being order'd to appear there, as you will see by what ensues) and the whole House was pleas'd to acquiesce in what I said: And there's no Man so weak, but knows it to be the Practice of all Governments, fully to par∣don Offenders (that make Discoveries) who have committed any Crime, even to the highest nature; and not only so, but often∣times reward them, of which we have sufficient Witness by Per∣sons now living: And it matters not what end he has to himself that makes the Discovery, whether it be thro' Good-will or Ill-will, Love or Hatred, so it conduce to the Publick Good; it's then the Interest of the Government to give him all due Encourage∣ment.</P>
<P>And until we come to act so, we can never think to prosper, but be in danger of ruin. Indeed as things are now managed, they look with an ill face; for notwithstanding all the great Pretensions to Loyalty, and the boasted Skill of some Persons, yet I say there have been great Discoveries laid before the Lords of the Admiralty long before these Advertisements, (in reference to the wronging His Majesty, and the poor Sailors) but no Prosecution of the Per∣sons that committed the Facts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commissioners for Sick and Wounded.</NOTE>But I fear I have dwelt too long upon these Matters, so shall pro∣ceed to the Commissioners for the Sick and Wounded: Against whom, one Mr. <HI>Baston</HI> exhibited a Complaint, and twice prov'd them guilty, so far as was sufficient to have given some of them their Passport (as they have done to many a poor Sailor) into the other World.</P>
<P>When he first brought his Articles against them, they were by His Majesty's Order referred to the Examination of the Lords of the Admiralty; and by their Lordships they were found guilty of what they were charg'd with: Upon which they petition'd His Majesty for a Rehearing at the Council-board; which was granted, and they were again prov'd guilty of Breach of Trust, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as appears by the Council's Report. And besides these Reports, there are other Matters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Whereby much innocent Blood has been spilt, and his Majesty's Treasure wasted; but they are too long here too insert.</NOTE> of dangerous consequence sworn and prov'd against them, which have long lain dormant in the hands of the Commissioners of Accompts; yet notwithstanding all this, these Men are still continued in Commission, and Mr. <HI>Baston</HI> deem'd the Offender.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
<P>I could lay down more things of this nature; but I am even a weary of raking in all this Filth, which must needs stink in the Nostrils of all good Men.</P>
<P>But I would not have any one now conclude, that all the Lords of the Admiralty, Commissioners of the Navy, and the Commissio∣ners for the Sick and Wounded, are guilty of these things, for I verily believe otherways: Yet in the mean time, I can do no less than charge the whole Board, for in these Cases the Major includes the Minor; and so there's no honest Gentleman can be any ways uneasy for what I have done, or use Endeavours to prevent the fair Examination thereof, but promote it, thereby to remove the Scandal he seems now to lie under; for when there comes a Discri∣mination, Truth will appear, as we have an Instance in the late Commissioners for Licensing Hackney-Coaches.</P>
<P>And now from all that has been related, it can no ways seem strange how some Men have arriv'd to such vast Estates: And if any Man impartially weighs the whole Matter, it must even astonish him to consider how it's possible any Government should be able to support it self so long as we have under such Corruptions, and at the same time have so great a War upon it: Indeed we only owe the Preservation of His Majesty's Sacred Person and Govern∣ment, to the Providence of God. However, the Nation feels the miserable Effects of these Corruptions, by the many great and pub∣lick Debts: But I shall leave those Gentlemen who have been the cause thereof, to the Justice of God and the Laws of the Nation, not doubting but they will meet with their due Reward, and be oblig'd to disgorge their ill-gotten Goods.</P>
<P>I think we may now fairly conclude, (without any breach of Cha∣rity) that the Commissioners of the Navy, and their Accomplices, plainly make a Prey of the Publick; and withal, not doubt but the Contracts made on behalf of the King, are for the most part frau∣dulent; which has prompted them all along to protect those Cri∣minals that have embezled the Publick Stores, (nothing else could induce them to do it, unless they really design'd to ruin the Go∣vernment, which then must be confessed to have been a most ef∣fectual way;) so that the Navy, which has been heretofore our Security, is now become a Gulf to swallow the Publick Treasure.</P>
<P>If any Man endeavours to lay these Evils open, he must undergo infinite Difficulties and Hardships, having a corrupt Party to con∣tend withal; who by Time and Interest have knit and link'd them∣selves
<PB N="24" REF="15"/> so fast together, that he's certainly crush'd by the Navy-board, or their Adherents; or otherways exposed to the World (as I have been) as a Fool or Madman, or both; and render'd to His Majesty as a vain idle Person, and look'd upon with as much Contempt and Scorn, as if he were the worst of Criminals.</P>
<P>I must confess I do not look upon this ill Treatment to be an Act of the Government, but that it arrives from the same Fountain all the rest of the Evils have done: nevertheless, such Proceedings are a Dishonour to the Nation and Government, and may at last prove fatal to them.</P>
<P>Some have assum'd to themselves a Power of dispensing with the Law: Tho we have good and wholesom Laws that are not put in execution, as those against Embezlements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet those that en∣deavour to have them put in practice, do even run themselves up∣on their own Destruction, as is seen by experience; he that disco∣vers any Breach of those Laws, being in far more danger than those that committed the Facts, which is highly pernicious, and strikes at the very foundation of the Government.</P>
<P>I shall now relate something I have cause to remember, and which is not altogether foreign to the Matter in hand. At the first opening of the Session of Parliament, begun and held in the fourth and fifth Year of his Majesty's Reign, I published a Book, en∣tituled, <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Glory Reviv'd;</HI> wherein I propos'd an Act of Tunnage for laying six Pence <HI>per</HI> Tun upon all Coasters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and likewise laid open the great Evil that attended the laying Embar∣go's upon Shipping, (which had been done every Year during the War until that time) giving full Demonstration there was no cause for it; and so there has been none laid since, tho far greater occa∣sion than at any time before.</P>
<P>All these Matters here related, (with some others) I would have laid open the last Session of Parliament; and in order to it, declar'd in Print I could discover 2 or 300 thousand Pounds of the Publick Money that had been embezled: Whereupon I was order'd to ap∣pear at the Bar of the House of Commons, which I did; and there declar'd the same, so I had the Assistance of that Honourable House: Upon which I was ordered to withdraw; and in a quarter of an hour's time one of the Commissioners for Taking and Stating the Publick Accompts, came to me in the <HI>Lobby,</HI> and told me I had given great Satisfaction to the House; and that I was referr'd to their
<PB N="25" REF="15"/> Board, where I should be heard with all imaginable Fairness: But several Gentlemen told me, that let my Cause be never so just, I must expect to be trick'd by that Board, none being more corrupt than they: Which seem'd strange, considering the care taken in Parliament in the Choice of those Persons; and withal it being well known they had good Fortunes, I thought it morally impossi∣ble they should ever be so corrupted as to act any thing against the Publick Good; yet, to my great Surprize, I found my self mistaken.</P>
<P>But to proceed; in obedience to the Order of the House, I waited on the Commissioners for Stating the Publick Accompts, and laid be∣fore them the great Injury done to the Souldiery by Agents and others in the Clothing of the Army, to the Discouragement of the Souldiery and Hindrance of His Majesty's Service; and then would have laid before them the Corruptions of the Navy, afore∣recited, but they would not receive it, all the Arguments I could use being to no purpose. All the Answer I could obtain, was, that it did not lie before that Board; and by way of Derision, they said they might as well examine a Justice of Peace why he did not do Justice, as to enquire into those Matters: But with Submission, they should have pursued the Order of the House of Commons, which was to receive what I should lay before them, and make report thereof with all convenient speed; and not made themselves Judges what was sit for them to receive: for as His Majesty and the Nation was injur'd, and the Publick Money and Stores em∣bezled, it was their Duty to have heard me, and left the House of Commons to be Judg. But they refusing to hear me, put me to such a Nonplus, that for sometime I knew not what to do; and fearing I should do little in the House of Commons that Session, I resolv'd to petition the House of Peers, and acquainted some of the Witnesses with my Intention, who very well approv'd on't. Whereupon I drew up a Petition with five Heads thereunto annex'd, and presen∣ted it to a Noble Lord; which his Lordship was pleas'd readily to receive and deliver to the House of Peers; where it was receiv'd with much Freedom and Readiness by their Lordships, and forth∣with order'd to be read. And that the ensuing Matter may be the better understood, I have here set down a true Copy of the same, which is as followeth.</P>

<P N="2">2. That the Lords of the Admiralty, and Commissioners of the Navy, have acted contrary to the Publick Good, by countenan∣cing, supporting, and preferring Criminals; and on the contrary, persecuting the Discoverers, and turning just Men out of their Offices.</P>
<P N="3">3. That their Lordships have had great Discoveries laid before them of Embezlements, and other great Frauds committed in the King's Yards, attended with Forgery and Perjury.</P>
<P N="4">4. That it is manifest some of the Commissioners of the Navy have in that Office advanced themselves from Salaries of 30 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> to vast Estates, having passed great Frauds, and total∣ly discouraged the Discovery of embezled Stores, to the great waste of the Publick Treasure.</P>
<P N="5">5. That it has been a long Practice in the Navy to make out false Tickets and Powers, suspending and delaying the poor Sai∣lors in their just Paiments, to the general Discouragement of them, and Starving their Families.</P>

<P>Upon the Reading of this Petition, Mr. <HI>Baston</HI> and I were call'd to the Bar of the House, to know if we could make good what I had set forth, (in reference to the first Head): Which we asser∣ting, in a little time their Lordships were pleas'd to order me to give in a List of my Witnesses; which I did in part, and so pro∣ceeded to the Examination of some of them upon the first Head, which was done with all imaginable Fairness. But there being some Depositions, and other Papers in the hands of the Commissio∣ners of Accompts, which I desired might be transmitted to the House of Peers: They thereupon sent their Secretary with some Papers, who said the Depositions were long, and would be so vo∣luminous as they had not leasure to draw them out; so begged the Favour they might have the Examination of the Matter: Which was soon granted by their Lordships, and an Order accordingly is∣sued out, bearing date the 20th of <HI>March,</HI> for their taking the Exa∣mination of the first Head; and for them to make their Observa∣tions upon the same, and to transmit both to the House of Peers. And by another Order of the 21st of <HI>March,</HI> they were order'd to take the Examination of the second and third Heads, and then to transmit the same to the House.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>
<P>But when I came to understand that the Commissioners of Ac∣compts had drawn this Matter to them again, which they had be∣fore rejected, I had just cause to fear they had a Design to prevent the Discovery of all these evil Practices; yet how to help my self I knew not, not knowing how corrupt that Board might be: All which put me to a great stand, foreseeing I should be baffled.</P>
<P>But I cannot omit relating one remarkable Passage, which is worthy of Observation: Upon the Reading my Petition in the House of Peers, and Order being given to call me to the Bar of the House, and a Door-keeper calling me with a loud Voice, one of the Commissioners of the Publick Accompts then accidentally pas∣sing by, and hearing my Name call'd, met me in the Painted-Chamber just as I was going into the House, (an honest Gentleman, only has wanted Resolution to withstand the Charms of these <HI>Si∣renes</HI>); who seem'd to be in great Confusion and Disorder of Mind, and was taken with such a Fit of Trembling as <HI>Belshazzer</HI> was when he saw the Hand-writing upon the Wall, not being able to hold one Joint still; and asked me if I accused the Justice of their Board? But I soon put him out of his pain by assuring him I did not; only I did seek for Relief and Justice, which I could not ob∣tain at their Board.</P>
<P>Thus we may see when Men are surprized, and a Guilt attends their Actions, how all their little Arts and Intrigues fail them.</P>
<P>But to return; Finding my self oblig'd to proceed with these Gentlemen the Commissioners of Aecompts, Mr. <HI>Baston</HI> and I wai∣ted on one of them at his House, whom we knew to be a leading Man at that Board; and acquainted him that we had not been well treated by their Board before, yet hoped we might now have things fairly examined. He bad Mr. <HI>Baston</HI> (whose Business was first to come on) not trouble himself with what was past, he should be fairly treated; for, says he, we'll take care to put our Finger upon the right place, (that was his Expression.) Which I must confess they did to the purpose, but to a wrong end, having thro' the whole Course of this Examination shew'd much Injustice and Partia∣lity; for when they went upon the Examination of the first Head, they brought three Informations (I can call them by no other name) against Mr. <HI>Baston;</HI> the Consequence of the first being High-Treason, and put him upon his Oath to clear himself from the other two: And when I waited on these Gentlemen first, be∣ing the 23d of <HI>March,</HI> I desir'd that the Witnesses as to the second
<PB N="29" REF="17"/> and third Heads, might have Precepts issued out for them, many of them living in the Country at a great distance: Upon which the Board did assure me they would take care it should be done; and as we proceeded upon the first Head, I desiring to know whether the Witnesses were order'd to appear in relation to the second and third Head, was several times answer'd, Care was taken therein; but I sound it otherways, there being no Precepts issued out for any Witnesses in the Country till the 12th of <HI>April:</HI> Yet during the time of examining the first Head, the Board sent for Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI> here in Town, who was a Witness to the second and third Head; and causing them to be read, asked him what he knew concerning them? He said he knew them to be true, and that they would be fully prov'd by good and substantial Evidence, and that things would appear to be much blacker than they were represented: With which they seem'd to be well pleas'd, and upon the 18th of <HI>April</HI> we began to examine Witnesses upon the second and third Head, and ended the 19th of the same Month; the Board declaring they bad so much Business upon them, they could proceed no farther that Session of Parliament. So there was little Progress made there∣in, the most material Witnesses not being examin'd: But during the Examination of these things, the Board did what in them lay to ri∣dicule the whole Affair; and one of the Commissioners who said he'd lay his Finger upon the right place, affirm'd the whole Matter was but a Contrivance of Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI>'s, and nothing in it. I ac∣quainted Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI> with it; who afterwards told the Commissio∣ners that a Gentleman of that Board had said that those Arti∣cles I had brought were a Contrivance of his: He said whoever did it acted very unworthily, for that it was none of his doing; and offer'd them his Oath, saying he had laid his Matters elsewhere: and farther told them, the Articles were true if they had but a mind to hear them: Upon which, the whole Board was silent, not one Man making any Reply; and the Gentleman who spoke the words hung down his Head as if he had been asleep, not that he valued what was spoken, but his Conscience smote him.</P>
<P>After these Things remain'd without any farther notice, till <HI>July</HI> the 12th, when I receiv'd a Letter from their Secretary, requiring me to be at the Office the 18th: Where I did appear, and sent in my Name to the Board: Upon which, their Secretary came to me with a Message; which I did not think fit to receive from him, so sent in my Name again, desiring to know if they had any farther
<PB N="30" REF="18"/> Commands. Whereupon I was call'd in, and told by the Chairman, that if I knew of any Persons that were guilty of any Crimes (in relation to those Articles I had brought) that were not within His Majesty's late Act of Grace, if I would lay it before that Board, I should be heard: This was twice repeated to me, for fear I should forget it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Some Persons have left the good old Way, and made new Paths to themselves; first crush a Man, then by their E∣missaries, spread abroad he can prove nothing: yet we see Time and Patience brings Truth to light, to the Shame and Dis∣honour of its Repugners.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But now, with these Gentlemens leave, neither they nor I had any thing to do with the Matter, as to judg who was pardon'd and who was not; therefore this was only an Evasion to prevent the farther opening thereof: for as the Articles were brought before the Act of Grace was passed, so with Submission it was their Duty to have receiv'd the whole Information; and if any Persons were afterwards found to be criminal, and within the Act of Grace, it were sufficient for them to plead it; and then the Nation might know and see who it was had abus'd them for so many Years run∣ning, and for the future take care to prevent the like Evils.</P>
<P>But this Method taken by these Gentlemen, was a Means utterly to overthrow all Discoveries of this kind; and the Kingdom like to be cheated, and kept as much in the dark as it has been hitherto.</P>
<P>For should I have proceeded only upon some part, it would have appear'd but a lame obscure Business, (especially as it might have been manag'd by them;) so in course it would be thrown out and rejected by the House of Peers as a Matter frivolous and idle: and if I did not proceed, it were still the same, (I having six Months time to do it in) their Lordships might then with a great deal of Justice throw it out; and after that no Punishment would be thought too great for me.</P>
<P>Therefore these Gentlemen have put me upon a Necessity of pub∣lishing these things; not only in reference to my own Safety, but in Justice to my Native Country: And I am sorry they, of all Men, should not behave themselves more like Englishmen, having all a∣long had the Character of being worthy Patriots of their Country.</P>
<P>For if we may judg of things by the Actions of these Gentlemen and others, it's a grand Question, whether there's any such thing as Religion, or we have any Laws or no? And by the same Rule disputable, whether I am a Man or a Woman? But let us not thus deceive our selves; for we must never expect to prosper until we make Duty, and not Interest, the Rule of our Actions.</P>
<P>And altho' God has been pleas'd to give Success to his Majesty's arms this last Campagn, yet it can be no Argument for the Conti∣nuance
<PB N="31" REF="18"/> of these Corruptions, thereby to oppress the Nation and gra∣tify the Appetite of particular Persons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Jeremiah 5.26, 27, 28, 29.</HI> wherein is lively set forth our pre∣sent State and Condition, so worthy the Pe∣rusal of every Man.</NOTE>, Matters being still dubi∣ous, the War not being brought to a period; but the Event thereof uncertain, and the Necessities of the Government apparently great: therefore we can no ways infer from thence the War will have a happy Issue; but may rather justly conclude, in the end God will punish us if we maintain and support such Cruelty and Oppression.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding, if by these evil Practices the Nation should be thrown into a Civil War, (which is no unreasonable Supposi∣tion, but what we have just cause to fear, considering what a Facti∣on we have in the very Bowels of us, which these Corruptions nourish, and from whence they gain strength;) none probably would be more ready to draw their Sword in defence of their Coun∣try, than the Authors and Abettors of these Corruptions: From whence we may see the Frailty of Humane Nature, and the mise∣rable Effects of Pride, Ambition and Covetousness, which darkens the Understandings of Men, while they make such eager pursuit af∣ter Riches; and it's that which hath produced all these great E∣normities.</P>
<P>If these things are passed over with Silence, the Nation can have no Security, by reason it will embolden Offenders, and excite and prompt others to commit the like Crimes <HI>ad Infinitum:</HI> For it's seen by Experience, the Generality of Mankind are more inclined to follow Example than Precept; but the fear of the Law and Punish∣ment to ensue, puts a Bridle upon the Appetite and Desires of Men, and keeps them closer to their Duty than the Dictate of Conscience does; and that excellent Saying of <HI>Polybius</HI> ought never to be for∣gotten: <HI>I believe</HI> (says he) <HI>that Nature her self has constituted Truth as the supream Deity, which is to be ador'd by Mankind; and that she has given it greater force than any of the rest: for being oppos'd, as she is on all sides, and Appearances of Truth so often passing for the Thing it self, in behalf of plausible Falshoods; yet by her wonderful Operation she insinuates her self into the Minds of Men, sometimes exerting her Strength imme∣diately, and sometimes lying hid in Darkness for Length of Time; but at last she struggles through it, and appears triumphant over Falshood.</HI></P>
