<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>NOT to cheat thee with a Preface instead of a Book, nor make this Brat of my own Brain such a Rickety Crea∣ture, as to have its Head bigger than all the rest of the Body, both middle and t'other end; I'll only dispatch a little ne∣cessary business, and then Gentlemen step in and take your Places: Or to be a little more Heroical, the Musick has played the last time, the Candles are all Snuffed, and the Curtain is just about to be drawn up.—Know ye, first and foremost, that the Name of this following Play relates to another part yet to come, which will more signally fill the Title; though this has enough of the <HI>Royal Voyage</HI> in it to make that good and proper in this, as well as the other. The <HI>Con∣quest of Granada</HI> is only begun in the first part, nay, no more than the Siege on't, yet the propriety of the Title none ever questioned to that part as well as the other.</P>
<P>The next thing I'm to do you, to wit, is, that the <HI>End</HI> of this Play is chiefly to expose the Perfidious, Base, Cowardly, Bloody Na∣ture of the <HI>Irish,</HI> both in this and all past Ages, especially to give as lively a Scheme as will consist with what's past, so far of the worse than Heathenish Barbarities committed by them on their Peaceable British Neighbours, in that Bloody and Detestable Massacre and Rebellion of <HI>Forty One,</HI> which will make the Nation stink as long as there's one Bog or Bog-trotter left in it.</P>
<P>Wherein, though every one knows this way of Writing al∣lows great Liberty; I protest 'twas impossible to invent more dread∣ful things than I found ready to my Hand; nay scarce could a single circumstance be any where added to set their Murders in a better
<PB REF="3"/>Light,—the Instances themselves, as History gives 'em, being such glaring ones, that Hell-Fire itself could scarce make 'em brighter. Nor even here have I taken any thing for granted, though there's so much abundant Evidence of the truth of all here asserted, even from the acknowledgment of some more ingenuous among 'em, <HI>Beling, Walsh,</HI> &amp;c. of their own Writers, and from the Pride and glory which others of them take in relating what then happened, instead of those few Hundred Thousands Murder'd, only wishing that All had gon the same way; but dropping that advantage, have confined my self even to the Chastness of an Historian, examining as the Reader will find, all the material Objections those wicked People can make to our Accusations, and all those thin Excuses where∣with they generally impose upon the Ignorant, and in vain en∣deavour to palliate their unheard of Inhumanities. I am confident I have herein done 'em Justice, and urged their Arguments as far and as home, perhaps closer, than any of them could have done for themselves. And if I have made one Exception from the general Rule, and introduced one Irishman amongst 'em all, brave and ho∣nest (as far as his Cause would let him be,) to foil the rest; if I have gone a little beyond the Pale, and left Truth behind me, 'tis a pardonable fault, and the more easily, because perhaps it mayn't be so common to err on the side of Good-nature. In his Character it's indeed designed to shew that there may possibly be some Individuals among 'em better than the rest of the Nation.—In that of all the rest, that if such a thing happens, 'tis but a chance, and won't often be brought into Example by the others. After all, let any Man take the pains but to read the Irish Histories, Foreigners as well as others, nay their own too, if he has any patience, into the bargain, and if he does not confess that I have not, nay cannot misrepresent the <HI>Irish,</HI> when I speak any thing ill of 'em, I'll be content to be sent over in∣to that blessed Island, and live there 'till I've forgot my Mother Tongue, and grow as Irish as <HI>O Hanlan's,</HI> &amp;c) as their mannerly Proverb has it.)</P>
<P>Tho on t'other side, so far is this piece from any Reflection on the British there, that one main end thereof is to give 'em their due En∣comiums, and just Honour.</P>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>In order whereunto, the principal brave Actions performed by them at the wonder of the World, and confusion of their Enemies, under all apparent disadvantages imaginable, Treachery of some, Cowar∣dise of others, want of Necessaries, a numerous well-provided Ar∣my pressing against 'em, are not (as many as could be handsomly brought in here) neglected, tho' the Historical order, unnecessary here, perhaps not observed.</P>
<P>For the manner in which those actions are introduced, 'tis done the most inoffensively that could be possibly contrived; —'tis out of choice that I have named no Persons, unless of the Enemies side. —As all shared in the Danger, so let 'em all in the Glory,—what∣ever parties there might then be, or are since, there shall be none in this Play, but <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Irish.</HI></P>
<P>That the desirable work of their entire Conquest may soon be ac∣complished, which all <HI>Europe</HI> as well as <HI>England</HI> groans for, the Second part of this Drama really acted, and our glorious King <HI>William</HI> there conquering all our Enemies, I am sure every honest Man wishes as heartily as I do; — for those who hope the contrary, tho' their own Countries, <HI>Europe</HI>'s, and Religion's implacable Enemies, I'd wish 'em no greater plague, than possessed with all the Rage, Ma∣lice, and defeated desperate Wickedness of an Irish-man, to stand by and see our great victorious Prince enter Triumphantly into his Royal City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> — which a few Weeks may in all fair pro∣bability produce, and a few more the <HI>Second Part</HI> of the <HI>Royal Voyage,</HI> or <HI>Irish Expedition.</HI></P>

<L>THus far the <HI>CAƲSE</HI> has with Success been crown'd;</L>
<L>And Great St. <HI>Patrick</HI> blest his sacred Ground;</L>
<L>Has been his own lov'd Country-men's Defence,</L>
<L>And chac'd the English Toads and Serpents hence.</L>
<L>Again shall <HI>Ireland</HI> her old Name renew;</L>
<L>'Tis now a <HI>Land of Saints</HI> and Heroes too;</L>
<L>Th' <HI>Asylum</HI> long before design'd for those</L>
<L>Sent into Exile by their faithless Foes;</L>
<L>That safe, that happy Sanctuary, where</L>
<L>By our great <HI>Faith's Defenders</HI> pious Care,</L>
<L>The Church it self can now glad Refuge find,</L>
<L>Leaving her cheated desperate Foes behind.</L>
<L><HI>Cash</HI> Like <HI>Arethusas</HI>'s Stream, her Fountain clear</L>
<L>Dives under Earth, and Sea, and rises here:</L>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<L>But never shall we her fair Spring restore,</L>
<L>As pure and limpid as it was before,</L>
<L>Unless we hollow the polluted Flood,</L>
<L>And purge out Heretick-Stains with Hereticks Blood.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prim.</SPEAKER>
<L>The very thought does my chill Age renew,</L>
<L>And almost make <HI>Armagh</HI> a Souldier too.</L>
<L>O <HI>Portendown!</HI> that happy Day is past;</L>
<L><HI>Grief</HI> stays too long, and <HI>Pleasure</HI> runs too fast:</L>
<L>I saw, and 'twas a wisht, a welcome sight</L>
<L>As e'er was shewn: By Heavens bright burning Light,</L>
<L>I saw the wandring Flood new-blacken'd o'er,</L>
<L>And shoals of Bodies washed down the shore,</L>
<L>Whilst fresh Supplies still o'er the Breach were thrown,</L>
<L>'Till there at last was hardly room to drown.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Macar.</SPEAKER>
<L>And thinks your Grace this was a sight so proper,</L>
<L>For one whose Character shou'd be Compassion,</L>
<L>Pity, and Love, all like our mighty Maker?</L>
<L>I, though long steel'd in Camps, and drench'd in War,</L>
<L>To Execution us'd, and Blood, and Carnage,</L>
<L>(Fatal Effects of necessary Cruelty)</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> rather shou'd have wish'd to have given the Lives</L>
<L>To all those Wretches, though at the expence</L>
<L>Even of my own.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prim.</SPEAKER>
<L>—Are you a Catholick?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maccar.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, and will die one. —But cou'd <HI>I</HI> believe</L>
<L>That my Religion taught the same that you do,</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> rather wou'd turn Heretick, Turk, or Pagan,</L>
<L>Than be so one hour longer.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prim.</SPEAKER>
<L>Scarce can the stupid Ignorance excuse you;</L>
<L>A Heretick himself could say no more.</L>
<L>Hath not the sacred <HI>Lateran</HI> Council made it</L>
<L>An Article as needful to Salvation,</L>
<L>As any of the <HI>Creed,</HI> That this curst Fry,</L>
<L>Rebels to <HI>Holy Church,</HI> shou'd be destroy'd</L>
<L>By Fire and Sword, or any other way,</L>
<L>Where-e'er they'r found, like other Beasts of Prey?</L>
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<L>While that of <HI>Constance</HI> makes this other easie,</L>
<L>And bids us keep no Faith with those that have none:</L>
<L>A pious, necessary, useful, comfortable Doctrine!</L>
<L>You are a Souldier—'Tis a Stratagem:</L>
<L>Those still in War are lawful —And I'll tell you</L>
<L>Once more, If this you know not, Sir, you'r guilty</L>
<L>Of Ignorance inexcusable—. Why 'tis</L>
<L>The very Cement of the <HI>CAƲSE,</HI> the <HI>Blood,</HI> the <HI>Life</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>Holy Mother:</HI> (Yet you are to learn</L>
<L>Your Catechise.) —'Tis what her eldest Son</L>
<L>Has practised many Years. See how he's blest,</L>
<L>How all succeeds. and he speaks Fate in <HI>Europe.</HI></L>
<L>If this you know, as how can you be ignorant</L>
<L>Of what each Catholick, especially</L>
<L>Each <HI>IRISH</HI>-Man sucks with his first-drawn Milk.</L>
<L>(Whoever here of all your Country-men,</L>

<L>My Lord, 'tis not a time for these Discourses:</L>
<L>Though his weak Conscience cannot yet digest</L>
<L>Such manly Food, we know he's firm to th' Cause;</L>
<L>Brave! and wou'd freely lose a Life i'th' Quarrel:</L>
<L>Rather let's <HI>think,</HI> and, with united Councels,</L>
<L>Consider what we've done, and where we are.</L>

<SPEAKER>Nug.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Think?</HI> What have we to think of? First let's act;</L>
<L>'Tis time enough to <HI>think</HI> when that is done:</L>
<L>'Tis a plain <HI>Imposition</HI> on our Natives.</L>
<L>To fall on such unnecessary Work:</L>
<L>We have an Hundred Thousand Men in Arms;</L>
<L>None but the wretched Relies of Rebellion,</L>
<L>That dare withstand us here: Let's o'er to <HI>England,</HI></L>
<L>That golden Land, where Palms and Laurels wait us,</L>
<L>Delicious Murthers, and sweet Massacres:</L>

<L>That will do well; 'tis excellently motion'd;</L>
<L>What brave <HI>Milesan</HI> wou'd not stake his Soul</L>
<L>On the <HI>Design?</HI> But first let's clear our own,</L>
<L>Ere we attempt on others Lands. Those Relies</L>
<L>You talk of, are like Vipers Spawn, if not</L>
<L>Crusht speedily, in time they'll grow too sturdy,</L>
<L>And send their Venome hissing o'er the <HI>Island:</HI></L>
<L>First send <HI>fair Words, good Terms, sweet-honied Proffers,</HI></L>
<L>(Which we know how to keep) clear once the <HI>North,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Derry,</HI> and <HI>Inniskilling,</HI> all's our own:</L>
<L>Give 'em what Articles they please themselves,</L>
<L>Promises cost not much; they may believe;</L>
<L>The <HI>English</HI> all are kind-believing FOOLS,</L>
<L>Or now had been our Masters: If this takes,</L>
<L>We have our Men, and vain Expence of Blood,</L>
<L>For better Purposes.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. <HI>Irish Lord.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Wou'd that were over;</L>
<L>I'd be content, cou'd we secure our own;</L>
<L>Nor ever much ambition'd Foreign Conquests:</L>
<L>The <HI>English</HI> sooner <HI>Cheated</HI> are, than <HI>Beaten;</HI></L>
<L>We must expect a formidable Army</L>
<L>Shortly in our Bowels: Though their Hands</L>
<L>Are raising long, they generally fall heavy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. <HI>Lord.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>My Lord, <HI>I</HI> must entirely join with you;</L>
<L>We owe our <HI>Safety</HI> to their <HI>Easiness:</HI></L>
<L>Had they not kindly thought we wou'd come over,</L>
<L>And yield the Sword, entreating they'd accept</L>
<L>That, and our Lives; we scarec had now been talking</L>
<L>How we shou'd conquer them: And, to say truth,</L>
<L>That was a Master-piece of <HI>Irish</HI> Cunning,</L>
<L>To drill 'em on with Promises and Oaths</L>
<L>Of free submission, when they'd please to take it,</L>
<L>Till we were able to laugh at 'em, and</L>
<L>Despise their Threatnings. <HI>I</HI> own 'twas justly managed,</L>
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y"/>
<L>And very pleasantly was that fine Fool</L>
<L>Entrapt, who promis'd <HI>England</HI> such Success,</L>
<L>Such Mountains of Foreign Hopes from Secret Treaties,</L>
<L>The end too crown'd the Work: When he perceiv'd</L>
<L>We were not quite so good to keep our Words</L>
<L>The Generous Fool dispatch'd himself for Shame,</L>
<L>To be out-witted by an <HI>Irish</HI> Man:</L>
<L>And heartily I wish, as any here,</L>
<L>The Frolick would go round, till we possess'd</L>
<L>Their Vacant Hives, without the toyl of Firing</L>
<L>The Drones away; (tho' then we lost the Pleasure</L>
<L>Of Killing, and the Lechery of Murder;)</L>
<L>But Since they won't go on in a good Work,</L>
<L>We must take Care to keep secure, by <HI>force,</HI></L>
<L>What we by <HI>Art</HI> have won; First, clear those Garrisons;</L>
<L>(Talk'd of, perhaps, more easily then done;)</L>
<L>Secure the Country next from Rapparees,</L>
<L>Who else will soon destroy the breed of Cattle,</L>
<L>And bring a Famine, spite of all our plenty,</L>
<L>That done, a Magazeen of Arms sufficient,</L>
<L>Provision too, against what casually</L>
<L>May happen, and that certain Desolation</L>
<L>Armies and War bring with 'em; then we may</L>
<L>Think on the other Projects.</L>

<L>A Curse on this Luke-warmness, in the Cause,</L>

<P>Rare times, by Saint <HI>Patrick;</HI> the best that <HI>Ire∣land</HI> ever saw, by my Soul Joy; why who wou'd be at the Trouble to raise and breed Cattle of their own, when the <HI>Heretick Dogs</HI> can do't to our Hands, without any pain?</P>

<P>Right Neighbour <HI>Teague;</HI> and besides they are all our <HI>Te∣nants,</HI> not we <HI>Theirs;</HI> for <HI>I</HI> heard <HI>Father Dominick, our Priest,</HI> make a Swear, that this was all our Country, Five Thousand Years before the <HI>New-Moon</HI> was made, and the <HI>English</HI> Thieves never came hither to rob us of our own till the next Year after the Flood was over.</P>

<SPEAKER>3. —</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, See what 'tis to have Learning; they must talk what they will, but if <HI>I</HI> know any thing, there's ne'r a Clergy, in Christendom to compare with the <HI>Irish;</HI> only the Truth is, they do lead a stray a Cheese, or a Flitch of Bacon, now and then; and sometimes the Bottle of <HI>Ʋsquebagh</HI> straggles after it. But all that's as easily forgiven as they do us, since they have so kindly prov'd the Lawfulness and Necessity of our plundering the <HI>English,</HI> their Snacks always reserved and reason good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>4. —</SPEAKER>
<P>But to see how stubborn and impudent some of these Pro∣testant Devils are; <HI>I</HI> went to one of 'em that had been once my Ma∣ster, (tho' now the Case is alter'd), and bid him give me a Cow; the impudent Pascal denied it to my Face, which so much provok'd me, as well it might, <HI>I</HI> had stuck my Skene in his Guts, had not some other of his Crew hindred me. who are all since fled together, to the Northern Rebels, where <HI>I</HI> hope, shortly, to have the hanging of Two or Three Dozen of 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. —</SPEAKER>
<P>They are e'n too kindly used, that makes 'em so malepert, what would they be Angels? Would they have more than their Lives? Unconscionable Dogs; their Brains deserved to be knock'd out if 'twere for no other Reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 —</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, That's the only way, after all. Ah Neighbours! had you seen, but what <HI>I</HI> ha' seen; we have made some sport on't for∣merly, but now this Foolish pity spoils all. If you had but heard how the Hereticks yelp'd, when we burnt a Hundred of them in a House together. Oh! <HI>I</HI> cou'd have humour'd it to the Life then; but now <HI>I</HI> grow hoarse, and have almost forgot it; <HI>I</HI> remember there was one sprawling Brat, of a Year or Two Old, that the Mother on't, or some body, had thrust out to save its Life; but how we all laugh'd when one of our Company stuck it a top of his Pike, to see the little Bastard sprawl about with his Legs and Arms, till he pitch'd it over again into the Fire, and made an end on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3. —</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that to the Invention of my Old Grand-Mother, rest her Soul, tho her Body was hang'd for't: My Father had ripp'd up Two or Three fat Persons Bellies, and the good saving Creature, finding they tallowed well, took out their Grease, and made Can∣dles of it: But never was a pleasanter sight, than to see how it dripp'd
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>in the Candle-stick, as if they had been sweating at it in their Pul∣pit agen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>5 —</SPEAKER>
<P>That was nothing neither, to what work we made with one of 'em; we ripp'd up his Belly, and tied one end of his small Guts to a Tree, driving him round till he had pull'd 'em all out, and then knock'd him o'th' Head, and with our common Farewel, tho' to good for 'em, sent his <HI>Soul to the Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. —</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! That was pretty well; but I think our Town was even with you; we had kill'd about Twenty, or some such small Business, of <HI>English</HI> Whores, and afterwards finding one of their Brats, in a Cradle, bawling for Meat, took it out, and put it to the Breast of the dead Jade his Mother, bidding the young Bastard suck if't had any mind to't, and there left it for the Dogs to eat them to∣gether.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>4. —</SPEAKER>
<P>All in good time, we may yet serve 'em the same sawce. In the mean while, let's be reveng'd on any thing that belongs to their Country. Their Lubberly Breed of Black-Cattle here, what shall we do with 'em all? We'll find some way or other to torment, as well as get rid of 'em, and they'll have little Cause to complain, that are used as well as their Masters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. —</SPEAKER>
<P>Let's serve 'em as we did the Fellow, I told you of, Tie 'em to a Stake, and cut off pieces of their Flesh alive; by this we shall have the double Pleasure of tormenting 'em, and seeing how finely they'll dance and roar to make us Musick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. —</SPEAKER>
<P>By Saint <HI>Pautrick,</HI> but that be a very good way, Joy! Agreed; all Hands to work here. What, Do these hang an Arse, and pretend to be Refractory, as well as their Masters? There, — this is fast enough: Come, — First let's have a Song, and then fall on, at the Word of Gommand.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[They Sing an <HI>Irish</HI> Song, Dancing round a fat <HI>English</HI> Ox, ti∣ed to a Stake; and as soon as that was over, fall all together upon it, cutting out pieces of them alive, and broiling it upon the Coals.

<L>We need not yet despair — A happy riddance</L>
<L>Of some we've made, whose Presence if still with us</L>
<L>Had done more harm than good: We have Provisions,</L>
<L>And while the Countrey's clear may yet bring more;</L>
<L>A Garrison, strong, numerous, and vigorous;</L>
<L>We've newly sent agen for aid to <HI>England,</HI></L>

<L>For our first taking Arms, 'twas on advice</L>

<L>To th' Deputy—. Those barbarous attempts</L>
<L>All Nations own 'tis lawful to repel</L>

<L>The last is not forgot—. For our remaining</L>
<L>In such a posture, 'tis for <HI>Englands</HI> King</L>
<L>And <HI>Ireland</HI>'s too we fight—. This ever was</L>
<L>Since Conquer'd, a Dependant held inseparable</L>
<L>From th' <HI>English</HI> Crown, when quitted, thrown away</L>
<L>And slighted by that Bigot Prince who wore it</L>
<L>Placed on two Royal Heads, the next in blood</L>

<L>Our rightful King and Queen, and you no better</L>

<SPEAKER>Talbot.</SPEAKER>
<L>The Massacre you talk of with such dread</L>
<L>Was no more real than that common place</L>

<L>When, after infinite insufferable</L>
<L>And odious provocations the poor Natives</L>
<L>Took for themselves and their Religion both</L>
<L>Just necessary Arms, Commission'd by</L>
<L>The King himself—. The Murthers buzz'd so loud</L>
<L>Were Executions which in War will ever</L>
<L>Be more or less—, and those you first begun</L>
<L>How many Thousands in the Isle <HI>Magee;</HI></L>
<L>Before a stroke was struck by ours— and then</L>
<L>We offer'd Murtherers on either side</L>
<L>Shou'd have fair Trial—, this you ne're accepted</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. <HI>Capt.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Only there you're right.</L>
<L>We dared not be indeed such hardy Fools</L>

<L>And before such you did propose a Tryal</L>
<L>Of which there was no need, for all the <HI>Irish</HI></L>
<L>Had been acquitted, all the <HI>English</HI> guilty.</L>
<L>That of <HI>Magee</HI> was a full year at least</L>
<L>After your horrid Massacre begun,</L>
<L>And only warm revenge for many Murthers.</L>
<L>Which you began er'e any provocation</L>
<L>The hour, the day prefixt all o're the Kingdom</L>
<L>Own'd by your own, and not by you denyed;</L>
<L>Who only say you were provoked to what</L>
<L>You did— but how— had you not your Estates,</L>
<L>Liberties, Lives, although a conquer'd Nation;</L>
<L>Were not your Lawyers, nay some Judges <HI>Irish,</HI></L>
<L>Was it Religion then? But was not that</L>
<L>Which you call so, allowed more bare then ever,</L>
<L>Convents and Nunneries every where connived at,</L>
<L>No man molested, Mass in publick said</L>
<L>All o're the Kingdom, spite of all the Laws</L>
<L>Point-blank against it— as for your Commissions</L>

<L>Or this or that can never now recall it.</L>

<L>The glorious Cause we now are all embarkt in</L>

<L>What are two Towns? they yet have won no more</L>

<L>Incurred by missing them, there are excuses</L>
<L>Sound plausibly enough, which wee'l transmit</L>
<L>To our Friends in <HI>England,</HI> as our selves wee'l use 'em.</L>
<L>—Alas, 'twas place, a little mean</L>
<L>And worthless Town, we only lay before it</L>
<L>For Recreation, might have taken it</L>
<L>When e're we pleased, at an hours warning had we</L>

<L>The Sword and Cannon, several brought Diseases</L>
<L>That left 'em there, tho' lives and all went with 'em.</L>

<L>—For what's to come we've still a numerous Army,</L>
<L>A noble body of Horse as are in <HI>Europe,</HI></L>
<L>Ten Thousand with the least— with these wee'l tug.</L>
<L>At least this Summer ore, the fickle English</L>
<L>By then perhaps will tired and weary grow</L>
<L>Of their new King, or <HI>France</HI> will be at leisure</L>
<L>To give their Arms a powerful diversion</L>
<L>And us assistance here. His Privateers</L>
<L>Will scowr our Seas, and pick each Vessel up</L>
<L>That peeps abroad, this will breed Discontents</L>
<L>In those enough inclin'd to't without Cause,</L>
<L>Besides we still have a strong party there</L>
<L>Desperate and Resolute—, they may produce</L>
<L>Something themselves thats not contemptible,</L>

<L>Which ever way they'r lost; if in defence</L>

<L>— But to that reason I before advance</L>
<L>Against Engagement, there's perhaps a greater,</L>
<L>A secret kept till now — I have Intelligence</L>
<L>There's a design form'd to betray the Camp</L>
<L>To th' Enemy — We shall hear more on't speedily;</L>
<L>The Guards are doubled, and I wait each minute</L>

<L>Now Gentlemen,</L>

<L>Proclaim immediate Death to every Papist,</L>
<L>Who owns not his Religion publickly.</L>
<L>Guard well the Avenues. To night my self</L>
