<HEAD>FROM VENICE THE thirtieth of <HI>July,</HI> 1622.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hey write from <HI>Millane</HI> that the Spa∣nish soldiers from diuers places of that State, were commanded to meet at a certaine rendeuou's, whereupon many of them were in∣stantly charged to march towards <HI>Bormio,</HI> to oppose themselues against the Grisons, a troupe of them being seene at <HI>Chiavenna</HI> intending to take a Spanish Post, but he was succoured by a 150 Musketteeres, of the company of Captaine <HI>Iohn Ser∣belliona,</HI> which skirmishing with the Grisons aforesaid, slue 14 of them and lost but fiue of their owne.</P>
<P>They had newes that the Grisons hauing inuaded the higher <HI>Aguedina,</HI> many of them had besieged the Fort of <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> and the rest making their ex∣cursions vpon the Frontiers of the Countie of <HI>Tyroll,</HI> droue great store of cattell from thence, into their owne territories.</P>
<P>And that there were daily held priuate consultati∣ons, touching the departure of the Duke of <HI>Feria,</HI> (Gouernour of <HI>Millane</HI>) towards <HI>Veltolina:</HI> as like∣wise
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> that his Excellencie hauing notice that from the said <HI>Veltolinat</HI> were fled and yet daily did fly about 60 soldiers at a time, and that (as they say) both for want of victuals and pay, he had giuen notice by a Proclamation that both Spaniards and Italians that here before abandoned the seruice of the king of Spaine, vnder whatsoeuer pretext or colour, should haue their pardon, returning into the same within the space of the next ensuing 15 daies after the Proclama∣tion. And those that came not in at the prefixed time, shall be banished and condemned to be hanged, and euery officer as well of lustice as Warre shall be authorised both to take and to kill them, not exemp∣ting them that were fled themselues, and afterwards reconciled.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Count di Monterei</HI> being there arriued, was royally lodged and entertained, at the charges of the said Gouernor: And going to view the Castle, the Ordnance was at his approach brauely dischar∣ged: As soone as he shall haue visited all the princi∣pall places of this city, he intends to goe on with his iourney for Spaine.</P>
<P>That the Grisons went from Towne to Towne, to confirme their new established vnion at <HI>Coyra.</HI></P>
<P>And that vpon the confines of the <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>SinZ,</HI> the Catholike Suissers which haue beset the passages to stop the troupes of their Enemies, had incountred one another, so that many of both sides were slaine.</P>
<P>By particular Letters from <HI>Veltolina,</HI> we vnder∣stand that the 26. of Iuly 30 companies of Grisons and Swissers, arriued in the territory of <HI>Chiavenna,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> and assaulting suddenly the Fort raised by the Spani∣ards (about a league distant from the Towne afore∣said) after they had killed seuen sentinels of the Spa∣nish Garison before they were aware of them, they tooke it presently, and hauing put in the same 2000 men for Garrison, they sate downe before <HI>Chiavenna</HI> and gaue two assaults to the towne, but were repul∣sed, seeing that a little before their comming, 9. com∣panies of foot, and 3 troupes of horse were receiued in the towne. And that vpon the same day arriued at <HI>Bormio,</HI> 130 Mule asses with Matches and Gun∣powder, which were sent from <HI>Millane</HI> for the seruice of the king of Spaine. As likewise that sixe Citi∣zens of <HI>Berganio</HI> were taken prisoners in the <HI>Veltolina,</HI> intending to buy wine.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lyons</HI> we heare, that the French King had sent <HI>Monsieur de Clandibront</HI> towards <HI>Piemonte,</HI> to perswade the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> (as they said) to de∣sist of his designe and enterprise vpon <HI>Momferat.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Genua</HI> is aduised, that the said Common∣wealth hauing promised vnto the Catholike King 4. Gallies (to assist his other in the safe keeping of the coastes of Spaine) tooke order to send them thi∣ther.</P>
<P>From <HI>Vienna</HI> they write that the Diet at <HI>Odenburgh</HI> in Hungary, went well on in the behalfe of the Em∣peror. But that there was a rumor that <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> leauied new forces, none knowing there to what purpose.

<P>There was of late a dissention risen betwixt the Vice-roy of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the Prior <HI>Aldobran∣dino,</HI> Generall of the Gallies of the Pope, which hapned by a fray or tumult, betwixt the Spa∣nish watch, and some of his, who seeing that one of the Galleys was taken prisoner; they re∣scued

<HEAD>The Copy of a Letter from Brussels, dated the 23 of <HI>Aug.</HI> concerning the Progresse and Resolution of <HI>Count Mansfield,</HI> since his being in Lorraine. With his last Conflict and Victory with <HI>Gonsalo,</HI> the 19. of <HI>Aug.</HI> in Brabant.</HEAD>
<P>SIr, I know you cannot be ignorant of the various reports spred abroad (throughout all these parts of Christendome) of <HI>Count Mansfields</HI> being for these two monthes past: Some affirming that hee is very weake; others, that he is very strong: some, that hee should be entertained by the French King, and that he should be falne off from the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> vpon a breach betwixt them; and that there should be a mutiny in their Army, whereupon they should bee vtterly dispersed.</P>
<P><HI>Count Mansfield</HI> being passed through <HI>Loraine,</HI> (where he payed for what he tooke, and commanded his Souldiers to forbeare doing any wrong, or taking any thing from any of the Duke of <HI>Loraines</HI> Subiects; notwithstanding, at a place or two his Souldiers of∣fered some violence.) ariuing in <HI>Champaigne,</HI> made his Randeuow vpon the Frontier thereof, almost for this two monthes. In the meane time the French King made great preparation, as fearing lest he should in∣uade
<PB N="6" REF="6"/> his Countrey: but vpon triall he found him to come not as an enemy, but as one who intended to doe him seruice, and did thereupon giue command to Duke <HI>Deniuers</HI> to treate with the said C. <HI>Mansfield</HI> vpon certaine Articles or propositions, namely, on the Kings behalfe: <HI>Deniuers</HI> propounded vnto him both honors and profits, as that he would make him a Mar∣shall of France, and a Generall of certain forces which he would send for the recouery of the <HI>Valtoline;</HI> that he would giue him 200000. Crownes in hand, and 20000. Crownes <HI>per annum. Mansfield</HI> on the other side was to bring to the Kings seruice of his Army 6000. foot, and 2000. Horse, which should presently receiue pay of his Maiesty. But <HI>Mansfield</HI> hauing a farther reach (as by the sequell appeares) intends no∣thing else by the said treaty, but to get himselfe more aduantage, and to preuent suspition in the matters which he directly intended, namely, for the ioyning with the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> For being at a towne called <HI>Mo∣soon,</HI> on the Frontiers of France, hee gaue out of pur∣pose that <HI>Brunswicke</HI> and he were fallen out, and that he was fallen from the said Duke of <HI>Brunswicke:</HI> and had secured himselfe in the strong Towne of <HI>Mosoon,</HI> and would ioyne with the French King; by which policy, the way to <HI>Brabant</HI> was the more secure, and his enemy <HI>Gonsalo</HI> made the lesse haste after him: For this treaty of his with the French King, did so amaze his enemies that they knew no other but that hee would haue concluded with him, on the contrary you shall vnderstand, about the 16 day of this month, in the night (hauing before selected out 6000. of his best horse, whereof 2. thousand are Carabins or light
<PB N="7" REF="6"/> horse, and 3000. speciall footmen: which said foote he likewise prouided horse for the most part of them) marched away from <HI>Mosoon</HI> vnexpected, towards <HI>Mouns</HI> in <HI>Henalt,</HI> where he ariued the 18 of this month near the Riuer of the <HI>Mozel</HI> with the D. of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> leauing behind 8000. foot, and 1000. horse, with all his Canon, and the most part of their baggage to the command of the Duke of <HI>Bulloin,</HI> and those of the religion. On the way before they came to <HI>Mouns,</HI> they burnt and pillaged diuers villages, and sacked two rich Monasteries in the Archdutches dominions.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>From Brussels.</HEAD>
<P>IT is likewise aduertised by other Letters on Satur∣day last, that they were come to a Castle called <HI>Montemaria</HI> on the borders of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and that com∣ming through <HI>Henalt</HI> the people of the Country made all the powers they could on the suddaine to resist them; those which resisted him were by the <HI>Mansfiel∣dians</HI> put to the sword, a great number of them, and the rest forced to flie for their liues.</P>
<P>That <HI>Cordua</HI> with 8000. foot and 2000. horse, most being <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> doe follow them, but are not within two daies iourney of them: Besides, they cannot march halfe so farre in a day as <HI>Mansfield</HI> doth with his horse, being quit of his Canon and Baggage. <HI>Gonsalo</HI> had thought to haue way-laid his passage through <HI>Henalt,</HI> by ioyning his ten thousand old Souldiers which those of the Country, had not <HI>Mansfield</HI> dealt the more politiquely in the businesse; as by this following Letter may appeare.</P>

<HEAD>The Letter.</HEAD>
<P>DEare and much respected friend, all the Newes that I haue to send you, is this, That <HI>Count Mansfield</HI> is come downe in∣to <HI>Brabant,</HI> and burneth and spoyleth the coun∣trie, marching his Army which consisteth of 6000. horse, and 3000. Musquiters on horse∣backe, for the speedy dispatching of his busi∣nesse.</P>
<P>The manner of his fight is thus; The tenth man of the Musquiteers, holding the horse of the rest, the rest set themselues in battaile: the 6000 horsemen first giues the assault, and the footmen powder vpon them with their Mus∣quiteers, whilst the horsemen wheele about and come in againe: and then if there be need, the Musquiteers returne againe for their suc∣cour: if otherwise the busines bee dispatched, they all on horse backe get them gone with the
<PB N="9" REF="7"/> prey that they deuoure and spoyle, no army of foot being able to doe any thing against them: and <HI>Spinola</HI> with all his horse being not able to make such an army.</P>
<P><HI>Brunswicke</HI> comes slowly forward with a great army; <HI>Mansfield</HI> hauing made way in re∣mouing the Obstacles for his safe passage: they are within 6. Leagues of <HI>Brussels.</HI></P>
<P>Hee that reported this, sayth he saw <HI>Mans∣field</HI> with his own eyes, being a Gentleman that came from the Palatinat.</P>

<HEAD>A LAMENTABLE RE∣lation of a great and fearefull storme and Tempest, of Winde, Thunder and Lightning, Which happened in <HI>Deuon</HI> and <HI>Somerset</HI>∣shire on Sunday and Munday the 18. and 19. day of <HI>August</HI> last.</HEAD>
<P>TO collect out of Stories the many and wonderfull iudgements of God from time to time shewed and executed vpon the sonnes of men, is a labour be∣yond my purpose at this time to vndertake, and there∣fore I will onely relate vnto you a story of a late won∣derfull and lamentable accident, which happened in <HI>Deuonshire,</HI> and there in chiefly of a shipwracke in <HI>Cat∣water</HI> rode by <HI>Plimouth,</HI> on Sunday night and Mun∣day morning the 18. and 19. of August last. There be∣ing floting in the Rode of <HI>Catwater</HI> diuers ships, some newly ariued, others bound out for seuerall places; among the rest, two Merchants ships hired by Moun∣seur <HI>Sabesa</HI> to transport certaine men for Rochell, both which ships being preparing, and partly proui∣ded of their men, the one was cast away with other ships and barkes riding in the said Rode aforesaid: The other onely buldge. But before this storme arose, I will not omit to set downe a strange accident which happened in one of the ships, there being in her both Mariners and Souldiers. About some three dayes before the storme, one man in her seeming to be fran∣ticke
<PB N="11" REF="8"/> or sicke of some violent disease, required leaue to goe a shore, for his time was come and hee must away. The Captaine notwithstanding would not suf∣fer him; insomuch that the fellow said, If they would not let him goe it would bee the worse for them all; for, said he, doe you not see two deuils yonder, and pointed with his finger; nay, said he, there will come three more anon. They notwithstanding caused him to be bound and put in the strongest hold of the ship, vnder hatches, the hatches being close kept downe: but about the euening when they were at prayers, hee came vp and walked on the hatches a while, whereat they were much amazed, till on a suddaine he leaped ouer board, and after him seemed to leape a thing like a great mastiffe dog; whereupon did arise such a tem∣pestuous storme of wind, thunder, and lightning, that the ship wherein this miserable wretch was, left her anckers, and was split on the Rockes, and all her men except about 8. were cast away; some of them being cast vp vpon the rockes, and a proper Gentleman a∣mongst the rest, was for certaine dayes standing vp∣right betwixt two rockes, as though he were aliue, and impossible to be got out vnlesse the rockes bee beaten away. In the said rode were likewise cast away seuen other Ships &amp; Barks, one wherof was driuen with the violence of the storme, vpon the top of a hie rock, not much impaired, so strangely that it is thought a thing impossible it should come there, and is as impossible to be gotten off againe without spoyling, beeing dri∣uen so farre from the water: In this storme is repor∣ted to bee lost out of these 8. ships 300. men, besides the Ships and goods. At the same time in diuers other
<PB N="12" REF="9"/> places besides, were many ships cast away, so that it is thought the losse by shipwracke in the west parts of England is 40. or 50000. pounds.</P>
<P>Now concerning the hurt done by land, by thun∣der and lightning the same time through <HI>Deuonshire</HI> and <HI>Summersetshire;</HI> in many places whole fields of Corne blasted, stackes of Corne blasted and scorched, nay the violence of the winde and thunder was such, that is scatttered and dispersed the Corne as if it had beene sowne againe, and as if God would not suffer vs to reape the fruits of the earth, but would scatter it againe, nay out of the eares, as if the flayle had beene vpon it. Let vs compare the mildew and blasting sent vpon our fields in generall, in the prime of our hope, before our haruest, and now in haruest (vpon that litle remainder) with this sudden judgement of winde and lightning, and consider whether we haue not cause to repent and to feare lest God may punish vs in greater measure hereafter.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>From the Hage the 18. of August.</HEAD>
<P>That his Excellency the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hath prepared Stables and all other proui∣sion for 8000. horse at <HI>Breda,</HI> against the com∣ming of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> and <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and hath ap∣pointed his brother <HI>Count Henry</HI> 6000. chosen foote, and 1500. speciall horse, to make al speed
