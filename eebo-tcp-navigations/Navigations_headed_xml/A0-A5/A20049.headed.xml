<HEAD>To the ryght noble and excellent Lady, the Lady Brigit, Countesse of Bed∣forde, my singuler good Lady and Mystresse.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>L studies haue theyr speciall tymes (Ryght noble Lady) all good partes, and singuler quali∣ties of the mynde are holden vp, and maynteyned with honour. The seely chylde learneth in his tēder age how to speake, to reade, to write: yoūg laddes bestowe theyr tyme in the study of other liberall sciences: as yeeres come on, and wyt en∣creaseth, so finally, the whole course of learnyng is runne ouer. Agayne, the arte of Grammer is wont erst to be learned, and than Logike after∣warde: naturall Philosophie goeth not before e∣loquence in our schooles: Geometry is first read, &amp; than Geography. So that the studies of good letters haue their times in respecte of mans age, they haue theyr tymes in the order of learning: yea they haue a tyme, that maketh vs all to be∣stowe therein our tyme, and to studie eche facul∣tie in due tyme, I meane that speciall tyme they floryshe in. I may not denye but that learnyng hath at all tymes ben well accompted of, in most countreys the skyll of dyuers languages well thought of, &amp; learned men to haue ben alwayes rewarded. what is than that speciall tyme wher∣in all studies doe flooryshe? Learnyng may bee ryght well compared vnto the floutes &amp; fruites
<PB REF="3"/>
of the earth, and the speciall tyme of learnyng, vnto theyr singuler seasons. In May, floures: in Iune, Cheries: at Haruest, corne: in September, Grapes: so fareth it in the study of good letters. There was a tyme whā the arte of grammer was so muche esteemed, that Gramariens proceeded masters thereof as woorshypfully, as other pro∣fessours now doe in any other facultie. Than was it honourable to be a Poet: honourable I say, for that the Poet Laureate enioyed the honour of a Palatine. that tyme is paste. There was a tyme whan Logike &amp; Astrology onely so weeried the heades of young schollers, yea and busied olde age also, that true Philosophie in deede was al∣most forgotten, eloquence defaced, the langua∣ges exiled. that tyme is past. Not long since hap∣py was he that had any skil in the greke tongue, he was thought a great scholler that could make a greeke verse. Nowe a dayes, who studieth not rather the Hebrue language? VVhere haue you almost any greeke aucthour printed? Geography laye hydden many hundred yeeres in darkenesse and obliuion, without regarde and price: of late who taketh not vppon him to discourse of the whole worlde, and eche prouince thereof parti∣culerly, euen by hearesay, although in the first principles of that arte, he bee altogeather igno∣rant and vnskylfull? This tyme is now. So long as Poetry was esteemed, the arte of grammer accompted of, Logike muche made of, Astro∣logy well thought of: Diuine Poets, good Gra∣mariens, perfecte Logiciens, excellent Astro∣nomers no where wanted.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/><HI>A Virgile can you neuer want where one Mecènas is.</HI> Honour &amp; promotion bestowed vppon the maynteyners of controuersies in religion, hath brought gray heares from endlesse Sophistry, from Scotus for∣malites, from Buridan and Burley, from Hol∣cot, from Bricot, from Vademecum, from Dor∣mi secure, and taught yonger yeeres rather to passe through Aristotle and his interpreters, than euer to dwell therein: caused them to studie the scriptures, to reade ouer the fathers, to conferre the counseyles, to learne the greeke and Hebrue languages, to searche the Chalday Paraphraste, to peruse the olde Doctours, to translate the newe wryters, to heape vp common places, to discourse of sectes, to wryte cunningly, to preach eloquently: and made them to be, for braulyng Sophisters, graue Philosophers, for formal Dun∣ses, plaine doctors, for rude questionaries, diuine Orators, for vnskilful schoolemen, eloquent and graue diuines.</P>
<P>It is nowe almost one hundred &amp; fiftie yeeres agoe, that Don Henrico, sonne of Iohn the fyrst of that name Kyng in Portugale, and Nepheu vnto our Kyng Henry the fourth, made his vy∣age after the conquest of Sep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a to the Canaries, and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uraged the Portugales to searche the coastes of Africa, and to seeke the landes therea∣bout not spoken of to fore. His grande Nepheu Iohn the seconde, so furthered this enterpryse, that the Portugale shyppes halled the Cape of good hope, discouered Aethiopia, and sayled where antiquitie denyed passage, beyond all A∣frica into the Indian seas. He sent also expert and
<PB REF="4"/>
cunning traueylers into Aegypt, and the redde sea coastes to espye what way the Portugales might looke for beyond the Cape of good hope to Calecut in India: the which viage in his sonne Emanuell his tyme, was prosperously taken in hand by Vasquez Gama, the nienth day of Iuly, in the yeere of our Lorde .1497. &amp; happely ended in Iuly againe, two yeeres after, to his great cre∣dit and preferment, to the immortal fame &amp; ho∣nour of his Prince and countrey. Here began the studie of Geographie, that euer since Ptolomeus raigne laye troden vnder foote, &amp; buried in dust and ashes, to spring vp agayne, and by the relati∣ons of skilful traueylers in Europe, Affrike, &amp; A∣sie: through the discouery of the far Indies, the Moluccaes, &amp; new founde landes, of late so to be wondred at, as no other facultie more. I dare be bold to say, that generally all Christians, Iewes, Turkes, Moores, Infidels, &amp; Barbares be this day in loue with Geographie. The wylde and rogishe Tartares myght for famine perishe in the winter, if they in the sommer skylfully followed not the sunne. The heathen Giapans diuided the worlde into three partes: Afrike was described by a Moore. The Iewes report the estates of all coun∣treyes to the Turkes. The Turkishe Basshaes go∣uerne the sweetest prouinces in Europe, A∣frike, and Asia, no men greater traueylers than Christians. VVho but Geographers doe teach vs what partes of the earth be cold, warme, or tem∣perate? Of whom doe we learne howe to diuyde the world into partes, the partes into prouinces, the prouinces into shyres? of Geographers. vnto
<PB REF="4"/>
whom haue wee to make recourse for Mappes, Globes, tables, and Cardes, wherein the dyuers countreys of the worlde are set downe? vnto Ge∣ographers. Set Geographie asyde, you shal ney∣ther be able to get intelligences of the situation and strength of any citie, nor of the limites and boundes of any countrey, nor of the rule and go∣uernement of any kingdome, nor be able wel to trauayle out of your owne doores. wil you see what wise and experte traueylers, skilful in geo∣metry and Astronomy, (for that is to bee a Geo∣grapher in deede) be able to doe?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kyng of Portugale &amp; Algarbs, Lorde of Guinea, of the cōquest, nauigation, and trafike into Ethio∣pia, Arabia, Persia, &amp; In∣dia.</NOTE> Looke you on the King of Portugales title: the two partes, of the three therein, were atchiued by Vasques Ga∣ma, and other traueylers aduentures. Consider the fruites, the drugges, the pearle, the treasure, the millions of golde and siluer, the Spanyardes haue brought out of the VVest Indies since the first viage of Columbus: The great commodities our nation reapeth by the traueyle of our coun∣treymen into Barbary, Guiny, and Moscouia, wil be a sufficient testimony vnto all vs Englishmen, what it is to be a skilful traueyler, what to bee a paineful Geographer, and learned. Desire of rule breedeth victories, victories come by cōquestes, conquestes are furthered by traueyle, traueyle can not bee maynteyned without great wealth, wealth maketh all traueyle pleasant. The North∣westerne vyage, be it neuer so full of difficulties, will become as plausible as any other iourney, if our passengers may returne with plentie of sil∣uer, silkes, and pearle. Let Columbus, Americus, Cortesius, be wel set foorth againe, and bounte∣fully
<PB REF="5"/>
rewarded, you shal heare of other newe found landes yet altogeather vnknowen. Let Gama be set in place, and Gama will tell you the situation, the maners, the force and wealth of forreyne na∣tions▪ for Gama his endeuor was, not onely by his friend Coelius to descrye the countrey wher∣soeuer he came, but also to learne him selfe the riches, strength, and conditions of the people. Honour maynteyneth arte: and the skill in Ge∣ography, as all other sciences, hath but a tyme of preferment, the whiche than chiefly myght bee looked for, whan it is most esteemed. This in the noble mynde of Cadamust bred that earnest de∣sire, after Don Henrico his example, to traueyle, to pen his owne aduentures into the Southeast and East partes, to make the nauigation of Gama and his companions knowen vnto the worlde. The occasions, the good successe, the great com∣modities wherof, Barros a counseller of the Por∣tugale Kyng, paynted out long agoe in manye bookes, Osorius of late, historically hath written the same in fewe. This made Marcus Paulus Ve∣netus a courtier in Tartary, Hayton the Arme∣nian to become a Frenchman, Lewes Vartoman∣ne a traueyler in Ethiopia, Brocardus an inhabi∣ter of Iury, &amp; eche one of them to leaue his pain∣ful iorney with posteritie in wrytyng. This enfla∣med the Spanyardes to take vppon them the dis∣couery of the VVest and Southwesterne landes, done and written by Columbus, Pinzonus, Al∣fonsus, Cortesius, and Americus, of whom that region America hath name. VVhose long letters and tedious reportes of thinges there brought to
<PB REF="5"/>
passe in the conquest of that halfe worlde, the straunge beastes, the sundry sortes of fruites, the ioyes and riches the whiche that countrey yeel∣deth, the manners and fashions of the people, their cities, and princely palaces, theyr nobilitie, their maner of gouernement, their warres, theyr seruile estate vnder the kynges of Spayne, their conuersion vnto the Christian fayth, P. Martyr a learned and graue man, borne at Angleria in the duchy of Milane, then President of the Spanish kinges counsell for the west Indies, gathered in∣to one volume, and leauing a side all superfluous narrations, made thereof, as it were, one briefe and continuall historie. This volume deuided he into eyght Decades, after the Greeke worde, so calling the sundry parcels thereof, for that eche one conteyneth in it ten particuler bookes or chapters. R. Eden our countreyman dyd into English, whan K. Philippe was in Englande, the three first Decades, and the fourth also, though vnder a wrong title, according to the Dutche Printers edition, wherin the fifte, sixte, seuenth, and eight Decades were lefte out. He translated moreouer Gonzales Ferdinandus Ouiedus bre∣uiary of the west Indies, &amp; geathered togeather out of many myghty and huge workes, some other prety pamflettes concernyng the Spany∣ardes and Portugalles voiages into the late dis∣couered lands, adding thereto certeine discour∣ses of the north partes. These his aforesayde do∣inges, as fewe mennes workes at the first come exactly abrode, this paynefull translatour myn∣ded, if not to amende, at the least to augment,
<PB REF="6"/>
by puttyng thereunto in English Lewes Varto∣mannus Nauigation into Aegypte, Arabia, Si∣ria, Persia, and India, with our Merchantes Mos∣couian and Persian trauelles: but death preuen∣ted his purpose, not suffryng him to accomplish his desire.</P>
<P>Christian charitie therefore vnto the party de∣parted, caused me to helpe his workes forwarde: Nature moued me to take some paynes in pla∣cing orderly, that whiche he had confusely gy∣uen out, the better to direct, and the more to profit the reader: My profession enforced me to cut of some superfluous translations, and to fill vp the rest of his doinges with P. Martyrs other writinges, and finally to furnishe his want with my owne store. Hoping and perswading with my selfe, that if God likewise call me from these worldly Nauigations, and earthly descriptions, before my other trauell in this facultye, taken long since in hande, be ended: some other profes∣sor of Cosmography wil so rewarde me after my death, as presently of this dead man I doe de∣serue. Other credite seeke I none therefore, I loke for no prayse, I hope not for honor, I gape for no gayne by this kind of studie. I knowe this day no place, no preferment, no publike chayre, no ordinarie lecture, no commune stipende, no special reward due vnto the studentes in Geo∣graphy: no not at this time, when this faculty was neuer more set by: no not in this realme, where yt neuer more florished. The honorable name of a Christian, and the infallible fruites thereof, euer inclined me, euen from my tender

In the smal number whereof, for amongst many wel willers I finde but few well doers, your Ho∣nor (right noble Lady) my Lorde &amp; you, his no∣ble children and yours, since my first returne from beyond the seas, must I confesse to haue stoode me chiefly in steede: &amp; humbly acknow∣ledge, the first yeerely pension I euer was assu∣red of in England, to haue ben by your Ladiship bestowed on me. VVherefore as I will most wil∣lingly yeelde vnto many other of your Honors gētlemē to come of great houses, to haue welthi∣er friendes, larger possessions &amp; reuenues than I, to be more actiue, more comely, more wyse, po∣litike, learned, &amp; to haue seene more: so in hūble duety, loyal seruice, sincere affection &amp; good wil to your Honor, I may, I can, I wyl contende with any of them all, euen to the vttermust force and power of my hart, head, body, life, blood, mynd, &amp; soule.

Eden newly encreased, my first labours in our language, his history &amp; mine of trauel in the west &amp; East Indies, altogeather in one volume, duetifully do I present vnto your Honour, with al humility praying &amp; most earnestly requesting your good Ladiship, that you will vouchsafe it, &amp; by leysure, in this iourney, the whiche my

Your Honours good lykyng thereof, wyll be to me no small contentation for this worke payne∣fully doone, a good occasion spedyly to finish the rest of my owne labours concerning this fa∣culty, a great encouragement and comfort to be∣stow my whole time hereafter only in that study, wherewith all my former knowledge in Philoso∣phy and Geography may ende.

<P><HI>A</HI> Certayne Carauel saylyng in the West Ocean, about the coastes of Spayne, had a forcybly and continuall wynde from the East, wherby it was dryuen to a land vnknowen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A harde begyn∣yng.</NOTE> and not described in any map or carde of the sea, and was dryuen styl along by the coaste of the same for the space of ma∣ny dayes, vntyll it came to a hauen, where in a short tyme the most part of the maryners, beyng long before very weake and fe∣ble by reason of hunger and trauayll, dyed: So that onely the Pilot, with three or foure other, remayned alyue. And not only they that dyed, dyd not inioye the Indies whiche they fyrst disco∣uered to theyr mysfortune, but the resydue also that lyued had in maner as litle fruition of the same: not leauyng, or at the least not openly publyshyng any memorie thereof, neyther of the place, or what it was called, or in what yeere it was founde: Albeit, the fault was not theyrs, but rather the malyce of other, or the enuie of that which we call fortune. I do not therfore marueyle, that the auncient histories affyrme, that great thynges proceede and in∣crease of small and obscure begynnynges, syth we haue seene the same veryfied in this fynding of the Indies, being so notable and newe a thyng. We neede not be curious to seeke the name of the Pilot, syth death made a shorte ende of his doynges. Some wyl, that he came from <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> and traded to the Ilandes of <HI>Cana∣ria,</HI> and the Iland of <HI>Madera,</HI> when this large and mortal naui∣gation chaunced vnto hym. Other say that he was a <HI>Byscanne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pylot that fyrst founde the Indies.</NOTE> and traded into Englande and Fraunce.

Agayne, some there be that say that he brought the Carauel to Portugale, or to the Iland of <HI>Madera,</HI> or to some other of the Ilandes called <HI>De los Azores.</HI> Yet do none of them affyrme any thyng, although they al affirme that the Pilot dyed in the house of <HI>Christopher Colon,</HI> with whom remayned all suche writynges and annotations as he had made of his voyage in the sad Carauell, aswell of such thynges as he obserued both by land and sea, as also of the eleuation of the pole in those landes whiche he had discouered.</P>

<HEAD>VVhat maner of man Christopher Colon (other∣wyse called Columbus) was, and how he came fyrst to the knowledge of the Indies.</HEAD>
<P>CHristopher <HI>Colon</HI> was borne in <HI>Cugureo,</HI> or (as some say) in <HI>Nerui,</HI> a vyllage in the territorie of <HI>Genua</HI> in Italie. He descended as some thynke, of the house of the <HI>Pelestreles</HI> of <HI>Placentia</HI> in <HI>Lumbardie.</HI> He beganne of a chylde to be a maryner: of whose arte they haue great exercise on the ryuer of <HI>Genua.</HI> He traded many yeeres into <HI>Suria,</HI> and other partes of the East. After this, he became a maister in makyng cardes for the sea, whereby he had great vantage. He came to Portugale to know the reason &amp; description of the south coastes of Affrica, and the nauigations of the Portugales, thereby to make his cardes more perfecte to be solde. He maryed in Portugale, as some say: or as many say, in the Ilande of <HI>Madera,</HI> where he dwelt at suche tyme as the sayd Carauell arryued there, whose Pilot soiorned in his house, and dyed also there, bequeathyng to <HI>Colon</HI> his carde of the description of suche newe landes as he had found, whereby <HI>Colon</HI> had the fyrst knowledge of the Indies. Some haue thought y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Colon</HI> was wel learned in y<SUP>e</SUP> Latine tongue and the science of Cosmographie: and that he was thereby fyrst moued to seeke the lands of <HI>Antipodes,</HI> and the rych Ilande of <HI>Ci∣pango,</HI> wherof <HI>Marchus Paulus</HI> wryteth. Also that he had redde what <HI>Plato</HI> in his dialoges of <HI>Timeus</HI> and <HI>Cricias,</HI> writeth of the great Ilande of <HI>Atlantide,</HI> and of a great land in the west Ocean vndiscouered, beyng bygger then Asia and Affrica. Furthermore that he had knowledge what <HI>Aristotell</HI> and <HI>Theophrastus</HI> saye in theyr bookes of maruayles, where they wryte that cer∣tayne merchauntes of Carthage, saylyng from the streyghtes of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> towarde the West and South, founde after many dayes a great Ilande not inhabited, yet replenyshed with al thynges requisite, and hauing many nauigable ryuers. In deede <HI>Colan</HI> was not greatly learned:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colon was not much learned.</NOTE> yet of good vnderstanding. And when he had knowledge of the sayde newe landes by the information of the dead Pilot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colon confer∣red with lear∣ned men.</NOTE> made relation thereof to certeyne learned men, with whom he conferred as touching y<SUP>e</SUP> like thinges mentioned of olde autours. He communicated this secrete
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
and conferred chiefely with a fryer, named <HI>Iohn Perez</HI> of <HI>Mar∣chena,</HI> that dwelt in the monastery of <HI>Rabida.</HI> So that I veryly beleeue, that in maner all that he declared, and many thynges more that he leaft vnspoken, were written by the sayde Spa∣nyshe Pilot that dyed in his house. For I am persuaded, that if <HI>Colon</HI> by science atteined to the knowledg of the Indies, he would long before haue communicat this secreate to his owne countrey men the <HI>Genueses,</HI> that trauayle all the worlde for gaynes, and not haue come into Spayne for this purpose. But doubtelesse he neuer thought of any such thyng, before he chaunced to be ac∣quainted with the sayde Pilot, who founde those landes by for∣tune, accordyng to the saying of Plinie, <HI>Quod ars docere non po∣tuit, casus inuenit.</HI> That is, That arte coulde not teache, chaunce founde. Albeit, the more Christian opinion is, to thynke that God of his singuler prouidence and infinite goodnesse, at the length with eyes of compassion as it were lookyng downe from heauen vppon the sonnes of Adam, so long kept vnder Sathans captiuitie, intended euen then (for causes to hym onely knowen) to rayse those wyndes of mercy whereby that Carauell (herein most lyke vnto the shyppe of Noe, whereby the remnante of the whole world was saued, as by this Carauel this newe worlde re∣ceyued the fyrst hope of theyr saluation) was dryuen to these landes. But we wyll now declare what great thynges folowed of this small begynnyng, and howe <HI>Colon</HI> folowed this matter, re∣uealed vnto hym not without Gods prouidence.</P>

<P>AFter the death of the Pilot &amp; maryners of the Spanyshe Carauell that discouered y<SUP>e</SUP> Indies, <HI>Christopher Colon</HI> pur∣posed to seeke the same. But in howe muche more he de∣syred this, the lesse was his power to accomplyshe his de∣syre. For, besyde that of hym selfe he was not able to furnyshe one shyppe, he lacked also the fauoure of a kyng, vnder whose protection he myght so enioye the ryches he hoped to fynde, that none other myght take the same from hym, or defeate him therof.
<PB REF="13"/>
And seyng the kyng of Portugale occupied in the conquest of Africa, and the Nauigations of the East, whiche were then fyrst attempted, the kyng of Castyle lykewyse no lesse busyed in the warres of <HI>Granada,</HI> he sent to his brother <HI>Bartholomewe Colon</HI> (who was also priuie to this secrete) to practise with the kyng of England (Henry the seuenth) beyng very ryche and without warres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kyng Henry the seuenth.</NOTE> promysyng to bryng hym great ryches in short tyme, if he woulde shewe hym fauour, and furnyshe hym with shyps to discouer the newe Indies, whereof he had certayne knowledge. But neyther here beyng able to bryng his sute to passe, he caused the matter to be moued to the kyng of Portugale <HI>Don Alonso,</HI> the fyfth of that name: at whose handes he founde neither fauour nor mony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barnarde knewe not all thynges.</NOTE> forasmuch as the Licenciat <HI>Calzadilla</HI> the bishop of <HI>Viseo,</HI> and one maister <HI>Rodrigo,</HI> men of credite in the science of Cosmo∣graphie, withstoode hym, and contended that there neither was nor coulde any golde or other ryches be founde in the west, as <HI>Colon</HI> affirmed. By reason whereof he was very sad and pensiue: but yet was not discouraged, or despaired of the hope of his good aduenture, which he afterwarde founde. This doone, he tooke shyppyng at <HI>Lisburne,</HI> and came to <HI>Palos</HI> of <HI>Moguer,</HI> where he communed with <HI>Martin Alonso Pinzon,</HI> an expert Pilot, who offered hym selfe vnto hym. After this, disclosyng the whole se∣cretes of his mynd to <HI>Iohn Perez</HI> of <HI>Marchena</HI> (a fryer of thor∣der of saint Frances in <HI>Rabida,</HI> &amp; well learned in Cosmographie) and declaryng vnto hym howe by folowyng the course of the Sunne by a temperate voyage, rych and great landes myght be founde: the fryer greatly commended his interpryse, and gaue him counsayle to breake the matter to the Duke of <HI>Medina Sido∣nia, Don Enrique</HI> of <HI>Guzman,</HI> a great lorde, and very rych: and al∣so to <HI>Don Luis</HI> of <HI>Cerda,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Medina Celi,</HI> who at that time had great prouision of shyps wel furnyshed in his hauen of <HI>Santa Maria.</HI> But whereas both these Dukes tooke the matter for a dreame, and as a thyng deuised of an Italian deceyuer, who (as they thought) had before with lyke pretence deluded the kynges of Englande and Portugale, the fryer gaue hym courage to go to the courte of the Catholyke princes <HI>Don Ferdinando,</HI> and lady <HI>Isabell</HI> princes of Castyle, affyrmyng that they woulde be ioyful of suche newes: And for his better furtherance herein, wrote

But they beyng more careful, and applying al theyr mynde howe they myght dryue the Moores out of the kyngdome of <HI>Granada,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The conquest of Granada.</NOTE> whiche greate enterprise they had alredy taken in hande, dyd lyttle or nothyng esteeme the matter. But <HI>Colon</HI> not thus discouraged, founde the meanes to declare his sute to suche as had sometymes priuate communication with the kyng. Yet because he was a straunger, and went but in simple apparell, nor otherwyse credited then by the letter of a gray frier, they beleeued hym not, neyther gaue eare to his woordes, where∣by he was greatly tormented in his imagination. Onely <HI>Alonso</HI> of <HI>Quintanilia,</HI> the kynges chiefe auditour, gaue hym meate and drynke at his owne charges, and hearde gladly such thynges as he declared of the landes not then founde: desyryng hym in the meane tyme to be content with that poore enterteynment, and not to despayre of his enterpryse: puttyng hym also in good con∣forte that he should, at one tyme or other, come to the speache of the Catholyke princes. And thus shortly after, by the meanes of <HI>Alonso</HI> of <HI>Quintanilia, Colon</HI> was brought to the presence and audience of the Cardinall <HI>Don Pero Gonzales</HI> of <HI>Mendoza,</HI> arch∣bishop of <HI>Toledo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The archb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shop of Toledo,</NOTE> a man of great reuenues and authoritie with the kyng and queene, who brought hym before them, after that he well perceiued and examined his intent.

India is properly called that great prouince of Asia, in the whiche great Alexander kepte his warres, and was so named of the ryuer <HI>Indus</HI>: and is diuided into many kyng∣domes confinyng with the same. From this great India (called the East India) came great companyes of men, as wrytteth <HI>He∣rodotus,</HI> and inhabited that part of Ethiopia that lyeth betweene the sea <HI>Bermeia</HI> (otherwyse called the red sea, or y<SUP>e</SUP> gulfe of <HI>Arabia</HI>) and the ryuer of <HI>Nilus</HI>: all whiche regions that great Christian prince <HI>Prester Iohn</HI> doth nowe possesse.

And hereupon came it that <HI>Aristotle, Seneca,</HI> and certayne other olde authours sayd, that India was not farre from Spayne. After this also, of later dayes our west India was so called, of the sayde India of <HI>Prester Iohn</HI> where the Portugales had theyr trade: For the Pilot of the Carauell that was fyrst dryuen by forcible wynde to an vnknowen lande in the west Ocean, called the same India, be∣cause the Portugales so called such landes as they had lately dis∣couered eastward. <HI>Christophor Colon</HI> also, after the sayd Pilot, cal∣led the west landes by the same name: Albeit some that take <HI>Colonus</HI> for an expert Cosmographer, thynke that he so named them of the East India, as to be the furthest and vnknowen ende thereof, reachyng into the West, vnder the other hemisphe∣rie or halfe globe of the earth beneath vs: affirming that when he fyrste attempted to discouer the Indies, he went chiefly to seeke the ryche Ilande of <HI>Cipango,</HI> whiche falleth on the part of great <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Cathay,</HI> as wryteth <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</HI> and other: And that he shoulde sooner come thyther by folowyng the course of the Sunne Westward, then agaynst the same.</P>

And as these colours are to be marueyled at, euen so is it to be considered, howe they dyffer one from an other, as it were by degrees, forasmuch as some men are whyte after dyuers sorts of whitnes, yelowe after diuers maners of yelowe, &amp; blacke after dyuers sorts of blackenes: &amp; how from white they go to yelow by discolouring to browne &amp; red, and to blacke by ashe colour, &amp; murry, somwhat lighter then blacke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The coloure of the west In∣dians.</NOTE> &amp; tawny like vnto the west Indians, which are altogether in general either purple or tawny,
<PB REF="15"/>
lyke vnto sodde Quinses, or of the colour of Chestnuttes or O∣lyues, which colour is to them naturall: and not by theyr goyng naked, as many haue thought: albeit theyr nakednesse haue some∣what helped therevnto. Therefore in lyke maner, and with suche diuersitie as men are commonly whyte in Europe, and blacke in Affrike, euen with lyke varietie are they tawney in these Indies, with diuers degrees diuersly inclinyng more or lesse to blacke or whyte. No lesse marueyle is it to consider, that men are white in Siuile, and blacke at the cape of <HI>Buena Speranza,</HI> and of Chestnut colour at the ryuer of <HI>Plata,</HI> being all in equall degrees from the Equinoctiall lyne. Lykewyse, that the men of Affrike and Asia, that lyue vnder the burnt line (called <HI>Zona Torrida</HI>) are blacke: and not they that lyue beneath, or on this syde the same lyne, as in <HI>Mexico, Iucatan, Quauhtema, Lian, Nicaragua, Pana∣ma, Santo Domingo, Paria, Cape Sainct Augustine, Lima, Quito,</HI> and other landes of <HI>Peru,</HI> which touche in the same Equinoctiall. For in all the tracte of these coastes, certayne blacke men were founde only in <HI>Quarequa,</HI> when <HI>Vaschus Nunnez</HI> of <HI>Balboa</HI> disco∣uered the sea of <HI>Sur.</HI> By reason whereof it may seeme, that such varietie of colours proceedeth of man, and not of the earth: which may wel be, although we be al borne of Adam &amp; Eue, &amp; know not the cause why God hath so ordeyned it, otherwise then to consider that his diuine maiestie hath done this, as infinite other, to declare his omnipotencie and wisedome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods wyse∣dome &amp; power is seene in his workes.</NOTE> in such diuersities of colours, as appeare not only in the nature of man, but the like also in beasts, byrdes, and floures, where diuers and contrary colours are seene in one litle feather, or the leaues growyng out of one litle stalke. An other thing is also greatly to be noted, as touching these In∣dians: and this is, that their heare is not curld, as is the Moores and Ethiopians that inhabite the same clime: neyther are they balde, excepte very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ildome, and that but litle. All whiche thynges may gyue further occasions to Philosophers to searche the se∣cretes of nature, and complexions of men, with the nouelties of the newe worlde.</P>

This <HI>Critia</HI> declared, that when <HI>Solon</HI> went into Egypt to a certayne citie named <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im,</HI> situate vpon the riuer of <HI>Nilus,</HI> where the diuisi∣on and recurryng of the riuer, maketh the Ilande <HI>Delta,</HI> he there spake with certayne learned priestes, very skylful in knowledge of antiquities of many worldes past. Insomuch that they made mention of manye thinges that were before the flood of Noe, or <HI>Deucalion,</HI> and also before the vniuersal conflagration or burning of the worlde in the tyme of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> forasmuche as the warres betweene the people of the sayde Ilande of <HI>Athlantides</HI> and the <HI>Atheniens,</HI> was long before the general flood, and the conflagra∣tion aforesayde. <HI>Plato</HI> induceth the priest, speaking to <HI>Solon</HI> in maner as foloweth.</P>
<P>Thinges most marueylous and true (<HI>O Solon</HI>) remayne in auncient writynges and memorie of our predecessours, and olde ages long before our tymes. But aboue all thynges, one exceedeth al admiration for the greatnesse and singularitie there∣of, whiche is this: It is in our recordes of moste antiquities, that in times past your citie of <HI>Athens</HI> hath oftentymes kepte warres agaynst an innumerable multitude of nations whiche came from the sea <HI>Athlantike,</HI> in maner into al <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia:</HI> whereas nowe appeareth no suche nation, forasmuche as the sayde sea is nowe al ouer nauigable: And yet at that tyme had,
<PB REF="16"/>
in the mouth, and as it were in the entrie (where you place the Columnes of Hercules) an Ilande whiche was sayd to be much greater then al <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> and that from thence was pas∣sage to many other Ilandes neare thereabout, and from the sayde Ilandes to the continent or fyrme lande, whiche was right ouer agaynst it neare vnto the sea: Yet, that within the mouth, there was a litle gulfe with a porte: the deepe sea without, was the true sea, and the lande without was the true continent. This Ilande was named <HI>Athlantides,</HI> and in it was a kyng of mar∣ueylous great power and myght, who had the dominion of the sayde Ilande, and many other, and also a great part of the conti∣nent lande whereof we haue spoken, and muche more towarde our partes also, forasmuche as they were dominatours of the thyrde part of the worlde conteynyng <HI>Africa, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> euen vnto the sea <HI>Tirrhenum.</HI> The power therefore of them be∣yng then so great, they came to inuade both your countrey and ours, and all other that are within the Columnes of Hercules. Then (<HI>O Solon</HI>) the vertue of your citie shewed it selfe famous in magnanimitie and feates of armes, with the assemblance of the other Grecians, in resystyng theyr great power, vntyl you had driuen them out of our lands, and restored vs to our libertie. But shortly after that this enterprise was atchiued, befel a mar∣ueylous great earthquake, and exundation or ouerflowing of the sea, which continued for the space of one day and nyght: In the whiche the earth opened it selfe, and inglutted all those vali∣ant and warlike men, and the sayde Ilande <HI>Athlantides</HI> sunke into the bottome of the sea, whiche was the occasion that neuer from that tyme forwarde, any shyp coulde sayle that way, by rea∣son of the great mudde and slyme whiche remayned of the drow∣ned Ilande.</P>
<P>This is the summe of those thynges whiche olde <HI>Critia</HI> sayde he had vnderstoode of <HI>Solon.</HI> And certaynely these wordes of <HI>Plato</HI> of the said Iland, haue caused great contention among ma∣ny great Philosophers, which haue written commentaries vpon the sayde Dialogue of <HI>Timeus</HI> composed by <HI>Plato:</HI> Insomuche that the same in those dayes being vtterly vnknowen, many haue taken this narration of <HI>Solon,</HI> for an allegorical fable, and haue interpreted the same in diuers senses and meanynges. But it
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
may nowe well appeare the true meanyng hereof to be this: that <HI>Plato</HI> intendyng to wryte of the vniuersall frame of the worlde, the whiche he knewe to be made an habitation for the diuine best man, and also beholdyng therin the great ornament and beautie of the heauen and starres, whereby man myght knowe his God and creatour, it myght seeme to hym a thyng to farre from rea∣son, that only two partes thereof shoulde be inhabited, and the other part desolate and depriued of men: and that the Sunne and starres might seeme to shewe theyr lyght only halfe theyr course without profite, shining only vpon the sea and desolate pla∣ces, destitute of man and other liuing creatures. And therefore <HI>Plato</HI> had in great admiration the hystorie of the sayde Egypti∣an priest, makyng mention of an other part of the worlde besyde <HI>Asia, Europa,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and thought it woorthy to be rehearsed in the beginning of his diuine Dialogue aforesayde. We ought therefore certainely to thinke our selues most bounde vnto God, that in these our tymes it hath pleased hym to reueale and disco∣uer this secrete in the fyndyng of this newe worlde, whereby we are certaynely assured, that vnder our Pole starre, and vnder the <HI>Equinoctial</HI> line, are most goodlye and ample regions, as well and commodiously inhabited, as are other partes of the worlde best knowen vnto vs.</P>

of thynges. I was therefore presente at the warres, from whence I writte to Cardinal Ascanius, and by sundry epistles certifyed hym of such thinges as I thought most woorthye to be put in memorie. But when I perceiued that his fortune was turned from a naturall mother to a stepdame, I ceassed from wrytyng. Yet after I sawe, that by thouerthrowe of the enimies of our fayth, Spayne was pourged of the Moores, as of an euil weede plucked vp by the rootes, leste I shoulde bestowe my slippery yeares in vnprofitable idlenesse, I was mynded to re∣turne to Italie. But the singuler benignitie of both the Catho∣lyke kyng and queene nowe departed, and theyr large promises towarde me vpon my returne from my legacie of Babylon, deteyned me from my purpose. Yet doth it not repent me that I drew backe my foote, aswel for that I see in no other place of the world at this tyme the lyke woorthy thinges to be done: as also that in maner throughout all Italie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Italy disquie∣ted with warres.</NOTE> by reason of the discorde of Christian Princes, I perceiued all thynges to runne headlong into ruine, the countreys to be destroyed and made fatte with humane blood, the cities sacked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sequeles of warre.</NOTE> virgins and matrones with theyr goods and possessions caried away as captiues, and mi∣serable innocentes without offence to be slayne vnarmed within theyr owne houses. Of the whiche calamities, I dyd not onely heare the lamentable outcryes, but dyd also feele the same: For euen the blood of myne owne kinsfolkes and frendes, was not free from that crueltie. As I was therefore musyng with my selfe of these thynges, the Cardinal of Arragone, after that he had seene the two fyrst bookes of my Decades wrytten to Asca∣nius, required me in the name of kyng Frederike his vncle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kyng Frede∣rike.</NOTE> to put foorth the other eyght epistle bookes. In the meane tyme also, whyle I was voyde of al care as touching the matters of the Ocean, the Apostolicall messengers of the byshop of Rome, Leo the tenth (by whose holsome counsayle and aucthoritie we trust the calamities of Italy shalbe fynished) raysed me as it were from sleepe, &amp; encoraged me to proceede as I had begun. To his holynesse I wrytte two Decades, comprysed in short bookes, after the maner of epistles, and added them to the fyrst, which was printed without mine aduise, as shal further appeare by the preface folowyng.

But not regardyng al these perylles, he determined to proceede, vntil he had certaine knowledge whether <HI>Cuba</HI> were an ilande, or firme lande. Thus he sayled forward, coastyng euer by the shore toward the West for the space of .CC.xxii. leagues, that is, about a thousande and three hundred myles, and gaue names to seuen hundred ilandes by the way, leauyng also on the left hande (as he feared not to report) three thousande here and there.

pounde weight, and two serpentes of eyght foote long apeece: whereat marueylyng, and lookyng about if they could espye any of the inhabitauntes, and that none appeared in syght (for they fledde al to the mountaynes at the commyng of our men) they fel to theyr meate, and ate the fyshe taken with other mens tra∣uayle, but they absteyned from the serpentes, which they affirme to differ nothing from the Crocodiles of Egypt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crocodiles of Egipte.</NOTE> but only in byg∣nesse: for (as <HI>Plinie</HI> sayth) Crocodiles haue sometymes ben found of .xviii. cubits long, but of these the biggest were but of eyght foote. Thus being wel refreshed, they entred into the next wood, where they found many of the same kynde of serpentes, hanging vpon boughes of trees, of the whiche, some had theyr mouthes tyed with strynges, and some theyr teeth taken out. And as they searched the places neare vnto the hauen, they sawe about .lxx. men in the top of a hygh rocke, whiche fled as soone as they had espyed our men, who by signes and tokens of peace callyng them agayne, there was one which came neare them, and stoode on the toppe of a rocke, seemyng as though he were yet feare∣full: but the Admiral sent one <HI>Didacus</HI> to hym, a man of the same countrey, whom he had at his fyrste voyage taken in the ilande of <HI>Guanahaini,</HI> being neare vnto <HI>Cuba,</HI> wyllyng hym to come neare, and not to be afraide. When he hearde <HI>Didacus</HI> speake to hym in his owne tongue, he came boldly to hym, and shortly af∣ter resorted to his company, perswading them to come without al feare. After this message was done, there dessended from the rockes to the shyps, about threescore and ten of the inhabi∣tantes, profering frendship and gentlenesse to our men: whiche the Admiral accepted thankfully, and gaue them diuers rewar∣des, and that the rather, for that he had intelligence by <HI>Didacus</HI> the interpreter, that they were the kynges fyshers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kinges fishers.</NOTE> sent of theyr lorde to take fyshe agaynst a solemne feast whiche he prepared for another kyng.

as many more the same nyght. Beyng asked why they fyrste rosted the fyshe whiche they entended to beare to theyr kyng? they answeared, that they myght be the fresher and vncorrupted. Thus ioynyng handes for a token of further frendshyp, euerye man resorted to his owne. The Admirall went forwarde as he had appoynted, folowyng the fallyng of the sunne from the be∣ginning of <HI>Cuba,</HI> called <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>O:</HI> the shores or sea bankes euen vnto this hauen, albeit they be full of trees, yet are they rough with mountaines:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blossomes &amp; fruites both at one time.</NOTE> of these trees, some were full of blos∣somes and flowres, and other laden with fruites. Beyonde the hauen, the lande is more fertile and populus, whose inhabitantes are more gentle, and more desyrous of our thynges: for as soone as they had espied our shyppes, they flocked all to the shore, bryngyng with them suche bread as they are accustomed to eate, and gourdes ful of water, offeryng them vnto our men, and fur∣ther, desyryng them to come alande. In al these Ilandes is a cer∣taine kinde of trees as bigge as Elmes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees which beare gourds.</NOTE> whiche beare Gourdes in the steade of fruites, these they vse only for drynkyng pottes, and to fetche water in, but not for meate, for the inner substance of them is sowrer then gall, and the barke as harde as any shell. At the Ides of May, the watchmen lookyng out of the top castle of the shyp, towarde the South, sawe a multitude of Ilandes standyng thycke togeather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A multitude of Ilandes.</NOTE> being al wel replenished with trees, grasse, and hearbes, and well inhabited: in the shore of the conti∣nent, he chaunced into a nauigable riuer, whose water was so hot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hotte water.</NOTE> that no man might endure to abyde his hande therein anye time. The day folowing, espying a farre of a <HI>Canoa</HI> of fyshermen of the inhabitantes, fearyng lest they shoulde flee at the syght of our men, he commaunded certayne to assayle them priuily with the ship boates: but they fearing nothing, taryed the commyng of our men. Nowe shall you heare a newe kynde of fyshyng. Lyke as we with Greyhoundes do hunt Hares in the playne feeldes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A straunge kinde of fis∣shing.</NOTE> so doo they, as it were with a hunting fishe, take other fishes: this fyshe was of shape or fourme vnknowen vnto vs, but the bodye thereof not muche vnlyke a great yeele, hauyng on the hynder parte of the head a very tough skynne, lyke vnto a great bagge or purse: this fyshe is tyed by the syde of the boate with a corde, let downe so farre into the water, that the fishe
<PB N="22" REF="32"/>
may lye close hid by the keele or bottome of the same, for she may in no case abyde the syght of the ayre. Thus when they espye any great fyshe, or Tortoyse (wherof there is great abundance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abundance of Tortoyses.</NOTE> byg∣ger then great targettes) they let the corde at length, but when she feeleth her selfe loosed, she inuadeth the fyshe or Tortoyse as swiftly as an arrowe, and where she hath once fastened her holde, she casteth the purse of skynne, whereof we spake before, and by drawyng the same togeather, so graspeleth her pray, that no mans strength is suffycient to vnloose the same, excepte by lytle and lytle drawyng the lyne, she be lyfted somwhat aboue the brymme of the water, for then, as sone as she seeth the bright∣nesse of the ayre, she letteth goe her holde. The praye therfore beyng nowe drawen nere to the brymme of the water, there leapeth sodenly out of the boate into the sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fisher men.</NOTE> so manye fyshers as may suffice to holde fast the praye, vntyll the rest of the company haue taken it into the boate. Whiche thyng doone, they loose so muche of the corde, that the huntyng fyshe may agayne returne to her place within the water, where by an other corde, they let downe to her a peece of the pray, as we vse to rewarde greyhoundes after they haue kylled theyr game. This fyshe, they cal <HI>Guaicanum,</HI> but our men cal it <HI>Reuersum.</HI> They gaue our men foure Tortoyses taken by this meanes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fishe Guaicanum.</NOTE> and those of suche byggenesse, that they almost fylled theyr fyshyng boate: for these fyshes are esteemed among them for delycate meate. Our men recompensed them agayne with other rewardes, and so let them depart. Beyng asked of the compasse of that lande, they aunsweared that it had no ende westwarde. Most instantly they desyred the Admirall to come a lande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humane people.</NOTE> or in his name to sende one with them to salute theyr <HI>Cazicus,</HI> (that is) their kyng, af∣firmyng that he woulde geue our men many presentes, yf they would goe to hym. But the Admirall, lest he shoulde be hindered of the voyage whiche he had begunne, refused to goe with them. Then they desyred to knowe his name, and tolde our men lyke∣wise the name of theyr king. Thus sayling on yet further euer towarde the West, within fewe dayes he came nere vnto a cer∣tayne excedyng high mountayne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A mountayne fruitfull and well inhabited</NOTE> wel inhabyted by reason of the great fertilitie of the same.

kyndes of wyldfoule, demaundyng relygiously of thinterpre∣tours, if this nation descended not from heauen. The kyng of this people, and dyuers other sage men that stoode by him, infor∣med hym that that lande was no Ilande. Shortly after, entring into one of the ilandes being on the lefte hande of this lande, they founde no body therin, for they fledde al at the comming of our men: Yet founde they there foure dogges of maruelous de∣formed shape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dogges of strange shape and dumme</NOTE> &amp; suche as coulde not barke. This kynd of doggs, they eate as we do goates. Here is great plentie of geese, duckes, and hearons. Betwene these ilandes and the continent, he en∣tered into so narowe streyghtes, that he coulde scarsely turne backe the shyppes, and these also so shalowe, that the keele of the shyppes somtyme rased on the sandes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">white and thicke water.</NOTE> The water of these strey∣ghtes, for the space of fourtie myles, was white and thycke, lyke vnto mylke, and as though meale had ben sparkeled throughout al that sea.

In the meane tyme, whyle the woodde was cuttyng, and the barrelles fyllyng, one of our archers went into the wood to hunt, where he espyed a certayne man with a whyte vesture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men appare∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d like white <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yers.</NOTE> so lyke a fryer of thorder of saynt Marye of <HI>Mercedis,</HI> that at the fyrste sight he supposed it had ben the Admirals priest, which he brought with hym, beyng a man of the same order: but two other folowed him immediatlye out of the same wooddes. Shortly after, he sawe a farre of a whole company of men clothed in apparel, being about xxx. in number.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pparelled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en.</NOTE> Then turning his backe, and crying out to his felowes, he made haste to the shyppes with all that he myght dryue. These apparelled men, made sygnes and tokens to hym to tary, and not to be afrayd, but that notwithstandyng he ceassed not to flee. The Admirall beyng aduertysed hereof, and not a lytle reioycyng that he had founde a ciuile people, in∣continently sent foorth armed men, with commaundement that yf neede should so requyre, they shoulde enter fourtie myles
<PB N="23" REF="33"/>
into the ilande, vntyl they myght fynde eyther those apparelled men, or other inhabitauntes of that countrey. When they had passed ouer the wood, they came into a great playne ful of grasse and hearbes, in whiche appeared no token of any pathway. Here attemptyng to goe through the grasse and hearbes, they were so entangled and bewrapt therein, that they were scarselye able to passe a myle, the grasse beyng there lytle lower then our ripe corne: beyng therefore weeryed, they were enforced to returne agayne, finding no pathway. The day folowyng he sent foorth xxv. armed men another way, commaundyng them to make dili∣gent search and inquisition what manner of people inhabited the lande: Who departyng, when they had found, not farre from the sea side, certayne steps of wyld beastes, of the which they suspec∣ted some to be of Lions feete, beyng strycken with feare, retur∣turned backe agayne. As they came, they founde a wood in the whiche were many natiue vines, here and there creepyng about hygh trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natiue vines. Trees bearyng spices &amp; sweete fruites.</NOTE> with many other trees bearyng aromatical fruites and spyces. Of these vines they brought with them into Spaine many clusters of grapes, very ponderous, and ful of licour: but of the other fruites they brought none, because they putrified by the way in the shyp, &amp; were cast into the sea. They say also that in the landes or medowes of those wooddes, they sawe flockes of great Cranes, twyse as bygge as ours. As he went forward, and turned his sayles towarde certayne other mountaynes, he espied two cotages on the shore, in the whiche he sawe only one man, who being brought to the shippe, signified with head, fyngers, and by al other signes that he coulde deuise, that the lande whiche lay beyonde those mountaynes was very full of people: and as the Admiral drew neare the shore of the same, there met him cer∣tayne <HI>Canoas,</HI> hauyng in them many people of the countrey, who made signes and tokens of peace and frendshyp. But here <HI>Dida∣cus</HI> the interpretour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers lan∣guages in the Ilande of Cuba.</NOTE> which vnderstoode the language of thinha∣bitantes of the beginning of <HI>Cuba,</HI> vnderstode not them one whit, whereby they consydered that in sundry prouinces of <HI>Cuba,</HI> were sundry languages. He had also intelligence, that in the inlande of this region was a king of great power, &amp; accustomed to weare apparell: he sayde that all the tracte of this shore was drow∣ned with water, and ful of mudde, besette with manye trees,
<PB REF="34"/>
after the maner of our maryshes: Yet whereas in this place they went alande for freshe water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearles in shel¦fyshes.</NOTE> they founde many of the shel∣fyshes in the whiche pearles are geathered. But that coulde not cause the Admirall to tracte the tyme there, entending at this viage, only to proue howe many landes &amp; seas he could discouer according to the kinges commaundement. As they yet proceded forwarde, they sawe here and there, al the way along by the shore, a great smoke rysing, vntyll they came to an other mountayne foure score myles distant, there was no rocke or hyll that coulde be seene, but the same was all of a smoke. But whether these fyres were made by thinhabitantes for their necessary busynes, or (as we are wont to sette beacons on fyre when we suspecte thapproche of our enimies) thereby to geue warning to theyr neyghbours to be in a redines, &amp; geather togeather, if per∣haps our men shoulde attempt any thyng against them, or other∣wyse as (seemeth most lykely) to cal them togeather, as to a won∣der, to beholde our shyppes, they knowe yet no certentie. In this tracte, the shores bended somtyme towarde the South, and sometyme towarde the West and west southwest, and the sea was euerye where entangled with Ilandes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sea entan∣gled with I∣landes.</NOTE> by reason whereof, the keeles of the shyppes often times rased the sandes for shalow∣nesse of the water: So that the shyppes being very sore bruised and appayred, the sayles, cables, and other tackelinges, in maner rotten, and the vytailes (especially the biskette bread) corrupted by takyng water at the ryftes euyll closed, the Admirall was en∣forced to turne backe agayne: This laste poynte where he touched of <HI>Cuba</HI> (not yet being knowen to be an ilande) he called <HI>Euangelista.</HI> Thus turning his sayles towarde other ilandes ly∣ing not farre from the supposed continent, he chaunced into a mayne sea, where was suche a multitude of great Tortoyses, that somtyme they stayed the shyppes:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>A multitude of great Tortoy∣ses.</P>
<P>A gulfe of white water.</P></NOTE> Not long after, he entred into a gulfe of whyte water, lyke vnto that wherof we spake before. At the length, fearing the shelfes of the ilands, he returned to the shore of <HI>Cuba</HI> by the same way whiche he came. Here a multitude of thinhabitantes, as well women as men, resorted to hym with cheerefull countenances, and with feare, bringyng with them popingayes, bread, water, and cunnyes, but especially stocke doues, much bygger then ours, which he affirmeth, in sauour and

As the Admirall harde masse on the shore, there came towarde hym a certayne gouernoure, a man of foure score yeeres of age, and of great grauitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The humanitie of a reuerende olde gouernour</NOTE> although he were naked sauing his pryuie partes. He had a great trayne of men wayting on hym. All the whyle the prieste was at masse, he shewed him selfe very humble, and gaue reuerent attendance, with graue and demure countenaunce. When the masse was ended, he presented to the Admirall a baskette of the fruites of his countrey, delyuering the same with his owne handes. When the Admirall had gentelly entertayned him, desyring leaue to speake, he made an oration in the presence of <HI>Didacus</HI> the inter∣preter, to this effect. I haue byn aduertised (most mighty prince) that you haue of late with great power subdued many lands and Regions, hytherto vnknowen to you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An oration of the naked go∣uernour.</NOTE> and haue brought no litle feare vppon all the people and inhabitauntes of the same: the whiche your good fortune, you shal beare with lesse insolencie, if you remember that the soules of men haue two iourneyes after they are departed from this body: The one, foule and darke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theyr opinion of the soule of man.</NOTE> pre∣pared for suche as are iniurious and cruell to mankynde: the other, pleasaunt and delectable, ordeyned for them which in theyr lyfe tyme loued peace and quietnes.

When he had saide these wordes and other lyke, which were declared to the Admirall by the interpreter, he marueyling at the iudgement of the naked olde man, answeared, that he was gladde to heare his opinion as touching the sundry iourneys and rewardes of soules departed from theyr bodyes, supposing that nother he, or any other of thinhabitantes of those Regions, had had any know∣ledge thereof: declaring further, that the chiefe cause of his

These comfortable words of the Admirall so pleased the olde man, that notwithstandyng his extreme age, he woulde gladly haue gone with the Admiral, as he had done in deede, yf his wyfe and chyldren had not hyn∣dered hym of his purpose: but he marueyled not a lytle, that the Admiral was vnder the dominion of another: and much more, when the interpretour tolde hym of the glorye, magnificence, pompe, great power, and furnimentes of warre of our kinges, and of the multitudes of cities and townes whiche were vnder theyr dominions. Intendyng therefore to haue gone with the Admirall, his wyfe and chyldren fell prostrate at his feete, with teares desyring him not to forsake them and leaue them desolate: at whose pitiful requestes, the woorthy olde man beyng moo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, remayned at home to the comfort of his people and familie, sa∣tisfiyng rather them then hym selfe: for not yet ceassyng to woonder, and of heauie countenance because he myght not de∣part, he demaunded oftentymes yf that lande were not heauen, whiche brought foorth suche a kynde of men?

ambassadours of the kynges of diuers regions were sent to <HI>Caunaboa,</HI> perswading him in no condition to permit the Chri∣stians to inhabite the Ilande, except he had rather serue then rule. On the other partie, <HI>Hoieda</HI> aduertised <HI>Caunaboa</HI> to goe to the Admiral, and to make a league of frendshyp with hym: but the ambassadours on the contrary part, threatned hym, that if he woulde so doo, the other kynges woulde inuade his region. But <HI>Hoieda</HI> aunswered them agayne, that whereas they conspired to maynteyne theyr libertie, they should by that meanes be brought to seruitude &amp; destruction, if they entended to resist or kepe warre against the Christians. Thus <HI>Caunaboa</HI> on the one side and the other beyng troubled, as it were a rocke in the sea beaten with contrary flooddes, and muche more vexed with the stormes of his gyltie conscience, for that he had priuily slayne .xx. of our men vnder pretence of peace, feared to come to the Admirall: but at the length, hauyng excogitated his deceyt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caunaboa con∣spireth the Ad∣mirals death.</NOTE> to haue slayne the Admirall and his companye, vnder the colour of frendshyp, yf oportunitie would so haue serued, he repayred to y<SUP>e</SUP> Admiral, with his whole familie, and many other wayting on him, armed after theyr manner.

they determined with them selues, not only to leaue sowyng and plantyng,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hunger of golde cau∣seth greate famine.</NOTE> but also to destroy and plucke vp by the rootes, euery man in his owne region, that whiche they had alredy sowen, of both kyndes of bread, whereof we made mention in the firste booke, but especially among the mountaynes of <HI>Cibana,</HI> other∣wyse called <HI>Cipanga,</HI> forasmuche as they had knowledge that the golde whiche aboundeth in that region, was the chiefe cause that deteyned our men in the Iland. In the meane tyme, he sent foorth a Captayne with a bande of men, to searche the South syde of the Ilande, who at his returne, reported that throughout all the regions that he trauayled, there was suche scarcenesse of bread, that for the space of .xvi. dayes, he ate nothyng but the rootes of hearbes, and of young date trees, or the fruites of other wylde trees: but <HI>Guarionexius</HI> the kyng of the vale, lying beneath the mountaynes of <HI>Cibana,</HI> whose kyngdome was not so wasted as the other, gaue our men certayne vyttualles. Within a fewe dayes after, both that the iourneys myght be the shorter, and also that our men myght haue more safe places of refuge, if the inhabitauntes shoulde hereafter rebell in lyke manner, he buylded another fortresse (whiche he called the Towre of Con∣ception) betweene the Citie of <HI>Isabella,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The tower of conception.</NOTE> and Saint Thomas for∣tresse, in the marches of the kyngdome of this <HI>Guarionexius,</HI> within the precincte of <HI>Cibana,</HI> vpon the syde of a hyll, hauyng a fayre riuer of holsome water runnyng harde by the same.

Thus as he, with a bande of armed men, had entred threescore myles
<PB REF="40"/>
further within the land, the people of the countrey here and there resortyng to hym, gaue hym a certayne portion of theyr bread, in exchaunge for other of our thynges: but he coulde not long tary here, because they lacked meate in the fortresse, whyther he hasted with such as he had now gotten. Leauyng therefore in the fortresse a garrison of ten men, with that portion of the Ilande bread whiche yet remayned, leauyng also with them a Hounde to take those kyndes of lytle beastes whiche they call <HI>Vsias,</HI> not muche vnlyke our Conies, he returned to the fortresse of Con∣ception. This also was the moneth wherein the kyng <HI>Guarione∣xius,</HI> and also <HI>Manicautexius</HI> borderer vnto hym, shoulde haue brought in theyr tributes. Remaynyng there the whole moneth of Iune, he exacted the whole tribute of these two kynges, &amp; vyt∣tualles necessary for hym and such as he brought with hym, whi∣che were about foure hundred in number.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vittualles brought from Spayne.</NOTE> Shortly after, about the Kalendes of Iuly, there came three Carauels from Spayne, bringing with them sundrye kyndes of vyttualles, as wheate, oyle, wine, bakon, &amp; Martelinas beefe, whiche were diuided to euery man accordyng as neede required, some also was lost in the caryage for lacke of good lookyng to. At the aryual of these shyppes, the Lieutenaunt receiued commaundement from the kyng and the Admiral his brother, that he with his men should remoue their habitation to the south syde of the Ilande, because it was nearer to the golde mynes: Also that he shoulde make diligent searche for those kinges whiche had slayne the Christi∣an men, and to sende them with theyr confederates bounde into Spayne. At the next voyage therefore he sent three hundred cap∣tiues, with three kynges, and when he had diligently searched the coastes of the south syde, he transported his habitation, and buylded a fortresse there, vpon the toppe of a hyll neare vnto a sure hauen:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint Domi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ikes towre.</NOTE> this fortresse he called saint Dominikes towre. Into this hauen runneth a riuer of wholsome water, replenished with sundry kyndes of good fyshes: they affyrme this ryuer to haue many benefites of nature, for where so euer it runneth, all thinges are exceedyng pleasaunt and fruitefull, hauyng on euery syde groues of Date trees, and diuers other of the Ilande fruites so plentifullye, that as they sayled along by the shore, oftentymes the braunches thereof, laden with flowres
<PB N="30" REF="40"/>
and fruites, hong so ouer theyr heades, that they might plucke them with theyr handes: also that the fruitfulnes of this ground, is eyther equall with the soyle of Isabella, or better. In <HI>Isabella</HI> he lefte only certayne sicke men, and shippe wryghtes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isabella.</NOTE> whom he had appoynted to make certayne carauels, the residue of his men, he conueighed to the south, to saynt Dominickes towre. After he had buylded this fortresse, leauyng therin a garryson of .xx. men, he with the remanent of his souldiers, prepared them selues to searche the inner partes of the West syde of the Ilande, hytherto knowen onely by name. Therefore about .xxx. leagues, (that is) fourescore and tenne myles from the fortresse, he chaunced on the ryuer <HI>Naiba,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Riuer of Naiba.</NOTE> whiche we sayde to defende from the mountaynes of <HI>Cibaua,</HI> ryght to∣warde the south, by the myddest of the ilande. When he had ouerpassed this ryuer with a companye of armed men diuyded into .xxv. decurions, that is, tenne in a company, with theyr ca∣pitaynes, he sent two decurions to the regions of those kynges in whose landes were the great woodds of brasile trees. Incly∣ning towarde the lefte hande, they founde the wooddes, entred into them, and felled the high and precious trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wooddes of Brasile trees.</NOTE> which were to that day vntouched. Eche of the decurions filled certayne of the ilande houses with the trunkes of brasile, there to be reserued vntil the shippes came which should cary them away. But the Lieutenaunt directing his iourney towarde the right hande, not farre from the bankes of y<SUP>e</SUP> riuer of <HI>Naiba,</HI> founde a certaine kyng whose name was <HI>Beuchius Anacauchoa,</HI> encamped against thin∣habitantes of the prouince of <HI>Naiba,</HI> to subdue them vnder his do¦minion, as he had done many other kings of the iland, borderers vnto him. The palace of this great king, is called <HI>Xaragua,</HI> &amp; is situate toward the West ende of the ilande, distant from the ry∣uer of <HI>Naiba</HI> .xxx. leagues. All the prynces which dwell betwene the West ende &amp; his palace, are ditionaries vnto him. All that region from <HI>Naiba,</HI> to the furthest marches of the west, is vtterly without golde, although it be full of mountaynes. When the kyng had espied our men, laying a part his weapons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountaynes without golde.</NOTE> &amp; geuyng signes of peace, he spake gentelly to them (vncerteyne whether it were of humanitie or feare) and demaunded of them what they woulde haue. The Lieuetenaunt aunsweared, That he should
<PB REF="41"/>
paye tribute to the Admirall his brother, in the name of the Christian kyng of Spayne. To whom he sayde, Howe can you requyre that of me, whereas neuer a region vnder my dominion bringeth forth golde? For he had heard, that there was a strange nation entred into the ilande, whiche made great search for golde: But he supposed that they desyred some other thyng. The lieu∣tenaunt answeared agayne, God forbydde that we shoulde en∣ioyne any man to paye such tribute as he myght not easely for∣beare, or such as were not engendered or growing in the region: but we vnderstande that your regions bryng foorth great plen∣tie of Gossampine cotton, and hempe, with such other, wherof we desyre you to geue vs parte. When he heard these woordes, he promysed with cherefull countenaunce, to geue hym as much of these thynges as he woulde requyre. Thus dismissing his army, and sending messengers before, he him selfe accompanied the Lieutenaunt, and brought him to his palace, being distant (as we haue sayde) .xxx. leagues. In al this tracte, they passed through the iurisdiction of other princes, beyng vnder his domi∣nion: Of the whiche, some gaue them hempe, of no lesse good∣nes to make tackelinges for shyppes then our wood: Other some brought bread, and some gossamppne cotton. And so euery of them payde trybute with suche commodities as theyr countreys brought foorth. At the length they came to the kin∣ges mansion place of <HI>Xaragua.</HI> Before they entered into the pa∣lace, a great multitude of the kynges seruauntes &amp; subiectes re∣sorted to the court, honorably (after their maner) to receyue their kyng <HI>Beuchius Anacauchoa,</HI> with the strangers which he brought with him to see the magnificence of his court. But now shal you heare howe they were intertained. Among other triumphes and syghtes, two are especially to be noted: Fyrst, there mette them a company of .xxx. women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kinges wiues.</NOTE> beyng al the kynges wyues and concubines, bearyng in theyr handes branches of date trees, singyng and daunsyng: they were all naked, sauyng that theyr pryuie partes were couered with breeches of gossampine cotton: but the virgins, hauyng theyr heare hangyng downe about their shoulders, tyed about the forehead with a fyllet, were vtterly naked. They affirme that theyr faces, breastes, pap∣pes, handes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Well fauored women.</NOTE> and other partes of theyr bodyes, were exceedyng
<PB N="31" REF="41"/>
smothe, and well proportioned, but somwhat inclynyng to a loue∣ly broune. They supposed that they had seene those most beuty∣full <HI>Dryades,</HI> or the natyue nymphes or fayres of the fountaynes whereof the antiques spake so muche.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Driades.</NOTE> The braunches of date trees, which they bore in theyr right handes when they daunced, they delyuered to the Lieuetenaunt, with lowe curtesy and smy∣lyng countenaunce. Thus enteryng into the kynges house, they founde a delycate supper prepared for them, after theyr maner. When they were well refreshed with meate, the nyght drawyng on, they were brought by the kynges officers, euery man to his lodgyng, according to his degree, in certayne of theyr houses about the pallaice, where they rested them in hangyng beddes, after the maner of the countrey, wherof we haue spoken more largely in an other place.</P>
<P>The day folowyng, they brought our men to their common hall, into the whiche they come togeather as often as they make any notable games or triumphes, as we haue sayde before. Here, after many daunsynges, synginges, maskinges, runnynges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A pretie pastyme.</NOTE> wrestlyngs, and other trying of mastryes, sodaynly there appea∣red in a large plaine neere vnto the hal, two great armies of men of warre, whiche the kyng for his pastyme had caused to be pre∣pared, as the Spaniardes vse the playe with reedes, which they call <HI>Iuga de Canias.</HI> As the armies drewe neere togeather, they assayled the one the other as fiersely, as if mortall enimies with theyr baners spleade, should fight for theyr goodes, theyr landes, theyr lyues, theyr libertie, theyr countrey, theyr wyues &amp; theyr children, so that within the momente of an houre, foure men were slayne, and many wounded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure men slayne in sport</NOTE> The battayle also shoulde haue contynued longer, yf the kyng had not, at the request of our men, caused them to ceasse. The thyrde day, the Lieuetenant coun∣saylyng the kyng to sowe more plentie of gossampine vppon the bankes neere vnto the waters syde, that they myght the better paye theyr trybute pryuately, accordyng to the multitude of theyr houses, he prepayred to <HI>Isabella,</HI> to vysite the sycke men whiche he had lefte there, and also to see howe his woorkes went forwarde. In the tyme of his absence .xxx. of his men were consumed with diuerse diseases.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prouision for diseased men.</NOTE> Wherefore beyng sore troubled in his mynde, and in maner at his wyttes ende,
<PB REF="42"/>
what he were best to doo, for as muche as he wanted al thynges necessarie, as wel to restore them to health whiche were yet acrased, as also vitayles to mayntayne y<SUP>e</SUP> whole multitude, where as there was yet no shyppe come from Spayne: at the length, he determyned to sende abrode the sicke men here and there to sundrye Regyons of the ilande, and to the castelles whiche they had erected in the same. For directly from the citie of Isabella to saynt Dominikes towre, that is, from the north to the south, through the ilande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The castels or towers of hispaniola.</NOTE> they had buylded thus many castles. Fyrst, xxxvi. myles distant from Isabella, they buylded the castell of <HI>Sperantia.</HI> From <HI>Sperantia</HI> .xxv. myles, was the castell of saynt Katharine. From saynt Katharines .xx. myles, was saynt Iames towre. Other .xx. myles from saynt Iames towre, was a strong∣er fortresse then any of the other, whiche they called the towre of Conception, which he made the stronger, because it was situat at the rootes of the golden mountaynes of Cibana, in the great and large playne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The golden mountaynes of Cibana.</NOTE> so fruiteful and well inhabited as we haue be∣fore described. He buylded also an other in the mydde waye be∣twene the towre of Conception, &amp; saynt Dominikes towre, the whiche also was stronger then the towre of Conception, because it was within the lymittes of a great kyng, hauyng vnder his dominion fiue thousande men, whose chiefe citie and head of the Realme, beyng called <HI>Bonauum,</HI> he wylled that the castell should also be called after the same name. Therefore leauyng the sicke men in these castels, and other of the ilande houses nere vnto the same, he hym selfe repayred to saynt Dominikes, exacting trybutes of al the kynges whiche were in his way. When he had taryed there a fewe dayes, there was a rumour spredde, that all the kynges about the borders of the towre of Concep∣tion, had conspyred with desperate myndes to rebell agaynst the Spaniardes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kinges rebell.</NOTE> When the Lieutenaunt was certified hereof, he tooke his iourney towarde them immediately, not beyng discoraged eyther by the length of the waye, or feeblenesse of his souldyers, beyng in maner foreweried with trauayle. As he drewe nere vnto them, he had aduertysement that kyng <HI>Guarionexius</HI> was chosen by other prynces to be the Capitayne of this rebellion, and that he was enforsed therto halfe vnwyl∣lyng, beyng seduced by perswasions and prouocations: the
<PB N="32" REF="42"/>
whiche is more lykely to be true, for that he had before had experience of the power and policie of our men. They came to∣geather at a daye appoynted, accompanyed with .xv. thousande men, armed after their manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An army of xv. thousand Barbarians.</NOTE> once agayne to proue the for∣tune of warre. Here the Lieutenaunt, consultyng with the Cap∣tayne of the fortresse and the other souldiers of whom he had the conducte, determyned to sette vpon them vnwares in their owne houses, before they coulde prepare theyr army. He sent foorth therefore to euery kyng a Centurion, that is, a captayne of a hundred, which were commaunded vpon a sudden to inuade theyr houses in the nyght, and to take them sleepyng, before the people (being scattred here &amp; there) myght assemble togeather. Thus secretly enteryng into their vyllages, not fortified with walles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kinges are taken pri∣soners.</NOTE> trenches, or bulwarks, they broke in vpon them, toke them, bound them, &amp; led away euery man his prisoner according as they were commaunded. The Lieuetenant hym selfe with his hundred men, assayled kyng <HI>Guarionexius</HI> as the worthier personage, whom he tooke prysoner, as did the other captaines theyr kings, and at the same houre appoynted. Foureteene of them were brought the same nyght to the towre of Conception. Shortlye after, when he had put to death two of the kynges whiche were the chiefe autours of this newe reuolte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">king Guari∣onexius is pardoned.</NOTE> and had suborned <HI>Guario∣nexius</HI> &amp; the other kynges to attempt the same, least the people for sorowe of theyr kinges shoulde neglecte or forsake their coun∣trey, whiche thyng myght haue ben great incommoditie to our men, who by thincrease of theyr seedes and fruites were often∣tymes ayded, he freely pardoned and dismissed <HI>Guarionexius</HI> and the other kynges, the people in the meane tyme flocking togea∣ther about the towre, to the number of fyue thousande without weapons, with pitiful houling for the deliuerance of their kinges: The ayre thundered, &amp; the earth trembled through the vehemen∣cie of theyr outcry. The Lieutenaunt warned <HI>Guarionexius</HI> and the other kynges, with threatenynges, with rewardes, and with promyses, neuer thereafter to attempt any suche thyng. Then <HI>Guarionexius</HI> made an oration to the people, of y<SUP>e</SUP> great power of our men, of theyr clemencie towarde offenders, &amp; liberalitie to suche as remaine faithfull, desyring them to quiet theyr mindes, and from thencefoorth neyther in deede nor thought to interpryse

any thyng agaynst the Chrystians, but to obeye and serue them, excepte they woulde dayly bryng them selues into further cala∣mities. When the oration was fynyshed, they tooke hym vp, and set hym on theyr shoulders, and so caryed hym home to his owne pallace: and by this meanes, this Region was paci∣fyed for a whyle. But our men, with heauy countenaunce wandered vp and downe, as desolate in a strange countrey, lack∣yng vittailes, and worne out of apparell, whereas .xv. monethes were nowe passed sence the Admirals departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lacke of vy∣tayles.</NOTE> duryng which tyme, they coulde heare nothyng out of Spayne.

In the meane tyme, <HI>Beuchius Anacauchoa</HI> (the kyng of the West partes of the Region of <HI>Xaragua</HI> (of whom we spake before) sent messengers to the Lieuetenaunt, to signi∣fye vnto hym, that he had in a redynes the gossampine cotton, and suche other thynges as he wylled hym to prepare for the payment of his trybute. Whereupon the Lieuetenaunt tooke his iourney thyther, and was honorably receiued of the kyng and his syster, somtyme the wyfe of <HI>Caunaboa</HI> the kyng of <HI>Cibana,</HI> bearyng no lesse rule in the gouernaunce of her brothers kyng∣dome, then he hym selfe: For they affirmed her to be a wyse woman, of good maners, &amp; pleasaunt in company.

These mountaynes, and also the inhabitauntes of the same, they call by one name, <HI>Ciguaios.</HI> The great king of all the kinges and regions of these mountaynes is called <HI>Maio∣banexius,</HI> and his court or pallace is named <HI>Capronus:</HI> the mountaynes are rough, high, and such as no man can passe to the toppes therof, they are also bending, and haue their corners reaching downe to the sea. Betweene both the corners of the mountaynes, is there a greate playne, by the whiche many ri∣uers fall from the mountaynes into the sea, the people are verye fierse and warlike men, hauing theyr original of the Canibales: for when they descend from the mountaynes to the playnes, to keepe warre with theyr borderers, they eate all such as they kil. <HI>Guarionexius</HI> therfore, fleeing to this kyng of these mountaynes, gaue him many presentes of such thinges as are wanting in his countrey, therwith declaring how vilely, villanously, and violent∣ly he had ben vsed of our men, with whom he coulde nothyng preuaile, neither by fayre meanes, nor by foule, nother by humi∣litie, nor by stoutnesse, and that to be the cause of his resorting, to hym at that tyme, most humbly desyring him to be his defence agaynst thoppressions of suche myscheuous people. <HI>Maioba∣nexius</HI> hereuppon, made hym promisse to ayde and helpe hym against the Christians al that he might. The Lieutenant there∣fore made haste to the fortresse of Conception, whither, as soone as he was come, he sent for <HI>Roldanus Xeminus,</HI> who with suche as folowed hym, lay in certayne of the Iland villages, xii. myles distant from the fortresse. At his commyng, the Lieuetenaunt asked him what al these sturres and tumultes meant? He answe∣red without abashment, Your brother the Admiral hath to doo therewith, and shall aunswere for the fame before the kyng, for we perceiue that the kyng hath so put hym in trust, that he hath had no regarde to vs: here we peryshe for hunger, whyle we folowe you, and are dryuen to seeke our vnhappye foode in the desartes: Your brother also assigned me assystaunt with you in gouernyng the Ilande. Wherefore, syth you haue na more

respecte vnto vs, we are determined no longer to be vnder your obedience. When <HI>Roldanus</HI> had spoken these wordes, and suche other, the Lieuetenaunt woulde haue layde handes on hym, but he escaped his fyngers, and fledde to the West partes of the regi∣on of <HI>Xaragua,</HI> hauyng with hym a trayne of threescore and ten men, whiche were of his confederacie. Here this fylthy synke of rebelles thus conspired, playde theyr vages, and lyued with loose brydles in al kynde of myscheefe, robbyng the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Licenciousnesse in libertie.</NOTE> spoyling the countrey, and rauishyng both wyues and virgins. Whyle these thynges were dooing in the Ilande, the Admiral had eight shippes appoynted him by the kyng, of the whiche he sent two laden with vyttualles, from <HI>Cales</HI> or <HI>Gades</HI> of Hercules pyllers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hercules pyl∣lers.</NOTE> directly to the Lieuetenant his brother. These shyps by chaunce arryued fyrst on that syde of the Ilande where <HI>Roldanus Xemi∣nus</HI> ranged with his companions. <HI>Roldanus</HI> in short tyme had se∣duced them, promysyng them in the steede of mattockes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A violent per∣swasion.</NOTE> wen∣ches pappes: for labour, pleasure: for hunger, abundance: and for weerynesse and watching, sleepe and quietnesse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The furie of Guarionexius.</NOTE> <HI>Guarionexius</HI> in the meane tyme assembled a power of his frendes and con∣federates, &amp; came oftentymes downe into the playne, and slue as many of the Christian men as he coulde meete conuenientlye, and also the Ilande men whiche were theyr freendes, wasting theyr grounde, destroying theyr seedes, and spoyling their vyl∣lages. But <HI>Roldanus</HI> and his adherentes, albeit they had know∣ledge that the Admiral woulde shortly come, yet feared they no∣thing, because they had seduced the newe men whiche came in the fyrst shyppes.

He sayled therefore fyrst to <HI>Madera,</HI> and sendyng from thence directly to <HI>Hispaniola</HI> the residue of the shippes laden with vittualles and other necessaries, he him selfe with one shyppe with deckes, and two Marchant Carauelles, coasted towarde the South to come to the Equinoctial lyne, and so foorth to folowe the tracte of the same towarde the West, to the intent to search the natures of suche places as he coulde finde vnder or neare vnto the same, leauing <HI>Hispaniola</HI> on the north side on his ryght hande. In the middle of this race, lye xiii.

to abide that extremitie of heate. Here the north pole was eleuate onely .v. degrees from the Hozizontall. For the space of .viii. dayes, in the which he suffered these extremites, onely the fyrst day was fayre, but al the other, clowdy and rayny, yet neuer∣thelesse feruent hotte: Wherefore it oftentymes repented hym not a litle, that euer he tooke that way. Being tossed in these dan∣gers and vexations eyght continuall dayes, at the lengthe an Eastsoutheast wynde arose, and gaue a prosperous blaste to his sayles. Whiche wynde folowing directly towarde the west, he founde the starres ouer that paralell placed in other order, and an other kynde of ayre, as the Admirall hym selfe toilde me. And they al affirme, that within three dayes sayling, they founde most temperate and pleasaunt ayre. The Admiral al∣so affirmeth, that from the clime of the great heate and vnholsome ayre, he euer ascended by the backe of the sea, as it were by a hygh mountayne towarde heauen, yet in all this tyme, coulde he not once see any land: But at the length, the day before the Ca∣lendes of Iuly, the watchman lookyng foorth of the toppe castel of the greatest shippe, cried out aloude for ioy that he espied three exceding hygh mountaynes, exhorting his felowes to be of good cheere, and to put away al pensiuenes: for they were very heauy and sorowfull, as well for the greefe which they susteyned by rea∣son of thintollerable heate, as also that their freshe water fayled them, whiche ranne out at the ryftes of the barels, caused by ex∣treme heate, as we haue sayd. Thus being wel comforted, they drew to the land, but at theyr fyrst approch they could not aryue, by reason of the shalownes of the sea neere the shore: Yet loking out of theyr shyppes, they myght well perceiue that the Region was inhabyted, and wel cultured, for they sawe very fayre gar∣dens, and pleasaunt medowes: from the trees and herbes wher∣of, when the mornyng deawes beganne to ryse, there proceaded manye sweete sauoures. Twentie myles distant from hence, they chaunced into a hauen, very apte to harborowe shyppes, but it had no ryuer running into it. Sayling on yet somwhat further, he founde at the length a commodious hauen, wherin he might repayre his shyppes, and make prouision of freshe water and fuel. <HI>Arenalis</HI> calleth this land <HI>Puta.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The iland of Puta.</NOTE> They found no houses nere vnto the hauen, but innumerable steppes of certeyn wilde

beastes feete, of the whiche they founde one dead, muche lyke a goate. The day folowyng, they sawe a Canoa commyng a farre of, hauyng in it foure and twentie young men of goodly corpora∣ture and high stature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">People of com∣ly corporature, and long heare, neere the Equi∣noctial.</NOTE> al armed with targets, bowes, &amp; arrowes: the heare of theyr heades was long and playne, and cutte on the forehead much after the manner of the Spanyards, their pryuie partes were couered with fyllets of gossampine cotton, of sun∣dry colours enterlaced, &amp; were beside al ouer naked. Here the Ad∣miral, consydering with him selfe the corporature of this people, and nature of the lande, he beleeued the same to be so muche the nearer heauen, then other regions of the same paralel, and further remooued from the grosse vapours of the vales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The higher, the colder.</NOTE> and maryshes, howe muche the hyghest toppes of the byggest mountaynes are distant from the deepe vales. For he earnestly affirmeth, that in al that nauigation, he neuer went out of the paralels of Ethi∣ope: So great difference is there betweene the nature of thinha∣bitauntes, and of the soyles of diuers regions, al vnder one clime or paralel, as is to see betweene the people and regions beyng in the fyrme lande of Ethiope, and them of the Ilandes vnder the same clime, hauyng the pole starre eleuate in y<SUP>e</SUP> same degree. For the Ethiopians are all blacke, hauing theyr heare curled, more like wool then heare: but these people of the Iland of <HI>Puta,</HI> (beyng as I haue sayde vnder the clyme of Ethiope) are white, with long heare, and of yelow colour Wherefore it is apparant, the cause of this so great difference, to be rather by the disposition of the earth, then constitution of heauen. For we knowe, that snowe falleth on the mountaynes of the Equinoctial, or burnt lyne, and the same to endure there continuallye: we knowe lykewyse, that the inhabitauntes of the regions farre di∣stant from that lyne towarde the north, are molested with great heate. The Admirall, that he myght alure the young men to hym with gentlenesse, shewed them lookyng glasses, fayre and bryght vessels of copper, haukes belles, and suche other thynges vnknowen to them. But the more they were called, so muche the more they suspected craft and deceyte, and fledde backe∣warde: Yet dyd they with great admiration beholde our men and theyr thynges, but styll hauyng theyr ores in theyr handes redy to flee. When the Admirall sawe that he coulde
<PB N="37" REF="47"/>
by no meanes allure them by gyftes, he thought to prooue what he coulde do with musicall instrumentes, and therefore com∣maunded that they whiche were in the greatest shyp, should play on theyr drummes and shawlmes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Musical in∣strumentes.</NOTE> But the young men suppo∣sing this to be a token of battayle, left theyr ores, &amp; in the twinc∣lyng of an eye had theyr arrowes in theyr bowes, and theyr tar∣gets on their armes: and thus directing theyr arrowes towarde our men, stoode in expectation to knowe what this noyse might meane. Our men likewyse preparyng theyr bowes and ar∣rowes, approched towarde them by litle and litle. But they de∣parting from the Admirals shyppe, and trusting to the dexteritie of theyr ores, came so neare one of the lesse shyppes, that one of them plucked the cloke from the gouernour of the shyppe, and as wel as they coulde by signes, required hym to come alande, promisyng fayth that they woulde commune with him of peace. But when they sawe him goe to the Admirals shyp, whyther he went to aske leaue that he might commune with them, suspecting hereby some further deceyt, they leapt immediatlye into the Ca∣noa, and fleedde as swyft as the wynde, so that to conclude, they could by no meanes be allured to familiaritie: Wherfore the Ad∣miral thought it not conuenient to bestowe any long time there at this voyage. No great space from this Ilande, euer towarde the West,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The violent course of the water from the East to the West.</NOTE> the Admiral sayth he found so outragious a fal of wa∣ter, runnyng with suche a violence from the East to the West, that it was nothyng inferior to a myghtie streame fallyng from hygh mountaynes. He also confessed, that synce the fyrst day that euer he knewe what the sea meant, he was neuer in suche feare. Proceedyng yet somewhat further in this daungerous voyage, he founde certayne gulfes of eyght myles, as it had ben the entraunce of some great hauen, into the whiche the sayde violent streames dyd fall. These gulfes or streyghtes he cal∣led <HI>Os Draconis,</HI> that is, the Dragons mouth: and the Ilande directly oueragaynst the same, he called <HI>Margarita.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The gulfe cal∣led Os Dra∣conis.</NOTE> Out of these strayghtes, issued no lesse force of freshe water, whi∣che encounteryng with the salte, dyd stryue to passe foorth, so that betweene both the waters, was no small conflycte: But entryng into the gulfe, at the length he founde the water thereof verye freshe and good to drynke. The Admirall
<PB REF="48"/>
hym selfe, and they which were his companions in this byoage, beyng men of good credit, and perceauing my dilygence in searchyng for these matters, tolde me yet of a greater thyng, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sea of fresh water.</NOTE> that for the space of .xxvi. leagues, amountyng to a hundreth and foure myles, he sayled euer by freshe water, inso∣much that the further he proceaded, especially towarde the west, he affirmed the water to be the fresher. After this, he came to a highe mountayne inhabited onely with Monkeyes or Mar∣masits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marmasets. Monkeyes.</NOTE> on that part towarde the East: For that syde was rowgh with rockye and stony mountaynes, and therefore not inhabited with men. Yet they that went a lande to searche the countrey, founde nere vnto the sea, many fayre fieldes, well tylled and sowen, but no people, nor yet houses or cotages: Parhappes they were gone further into the countrey, to sowe theyr corne, and applye theyr husbandry, as wee often see our husbandemen to leaue theyr stations and villages for the same purpose. In the west syde of that mountayne, they espyed a large playne, whither they made hast, and cast anker in the brode ryuer. As soone as the inhabitantes had knowledge that a strange nation was arryued in theyr coastes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fayre and large region of Paria.</NOTE> they came flockyng without all feare to see our men. We vnderstode by theyr sygnes and poyntynges, that this Region was called <HI>Paria,</HI> and that it was very large: in so muche that the further it reacheth towarde the weste, to be so muche the better inhabited and replenished with people. The Admiral therfore, takyng into his shippe foure of the men of that lande, searched the west partes of the same. By the temperatenes of the ayer, the pleasaūtnes of the ground, and the multitude of people which they sawe daily more &amp; more as they sayled, they coniectured that these thynges portended some great matter: as in deede their opinion failed them not, as we will further declare in his place. The sonne not yet rysen, but beginnyng euen nowe to ryse, being one day allured by the plea∣sauntnes of the place, and sweete sauours whiche breathed from the lande to the shyppes, they went a lande: Here they founde a greater multytude of people, then in any other place. As our men approched towarde them, there came certeine messengers from their <HI>Cacici,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humane people.</NOTE> that is, the kinges of the countrey, to desyre the Admirall in the name of theyr princes to come to theyr palaces
<PB N="38" REF="48"/>
without feare, and that they and al theyrs shoulde bee at his com∣maundement. When the Admirall had thanked them, and made his excuse for that tyme, there came innumerable people with theyr boates to the shyppes, hauyng for the most parte cheynes about theyr neckes, garlandes on theyr heades, and braselettes on theyr armes of pearles of India, and that so com∣monlye, that our women in playes and tryumphes, haue not greater plentie of stones of glasse and crystall in theyr garlands, crownes, girdels, and suche other tyrementes. Beyng asked where they gathered them, they poynted to the next shore by the sea bankes. They signified also, by certeyne scornefull iestures whiche they made with theyr mouthes and handes, that they no∣thyng esteemed pearles. Taking also baskettes in their handes, they made signes that the same myght be fylled with them in shorte space. But because the corne wherwith his shyppes were laden to be caryed into <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> had taken hurt by reason of the salt water, he determined to deferre this marte to a more conue∣nient tyme: Yet he sent to land two of the shyp boates laden with men, to thintent to fetch some garlands of pearles for exchange of our thynges, and also somwhat to searche the nature of the Re∣gion, and disposition of the people. They enterteyned our men gentelly, and came flocking to them by heapes, as it had ben to beholde some strange monsters. Fyrst there came to meete our men, two men of grauitie, whom the multitude folowed: One of these was well in age, and the other but young. They thinke it was the father, with his sonne whiche should succeede hym. When the one had saluted and embrased the other, they brought our men into a certeyne rounde house, neere vnto the whiche was a great courte.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chayers and stooles of He∣bene.</NOTE> Hyther were brought many chayers and stooles made of a certeyne blacke wood, and very cunnyngly wrought. After that our men and theyr Princes were sette, theyr waytyng men came in laden, some with sundry delycate dysihes, and some with wyne: But theyr meat, was only fruites, and those of dyuers kyndes, and vtterly vnknowen to vs. Theyr wyne was both whyte and redde, not made of grapes, but of the lycour of dyuers fruites, and very pleasaunte in drynkyng. After this banquet made in the olde mans house, the young man brought them to his tabernacle or mantion place, where
<PB REF="49"/>
was a great company both of men and women, but they stoode disseuered the one from the other. They are whyte, euen as our men are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whyte men neere the Equi∣noctiall.</NOTE> sauing suche as are much conuersant in the sunne. They are also very gentle, and full of humanitie towarde stran∣gers. They couer theyr priuie partes with gossampine cotton, wrought with sundry colours, and are besyde all naked. There was fewe, or none, that had not eyther a coller, a chayne, or a bracelet of golde and pearles, and many had all. Beyng as∣ked where they had that golde, they poynted to certayne moun∣taynes, seemyng with theyr countenaunce to disswade our men from goyng thither: For putting theyr armes in theyr mouthes, and grynnyng as though they bytte the same, styll poyntyng to the mountaynes, they seemed to insinuate that men were eaten there: but whether they meant by the Canibales, or wylde beastes, our men coulde not wel perceiue. They tooke it excee∣dyng greeuouslye, that they coulde neyther vnderstande our men, nor our men them. When they whiche were sent to lande, were returned to the shyppes about three of the clocke at after noone the same day, bryngyng with them certayne garlandes, and collers of pearles, they loosed theyr ankers to departe, min∣dyng to come agayne shortlye, when all thynges were set in good order in <HI>Hispaniola:</HI> but he was preuented by another, whiche defeated him of the rewarde of his trauayle. He was al∣so hyndered at this time by reason of the shalownesse of the sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shalownesse of the sea.</NOTE> &amp; violent course of the water, which with continuall tossyng, bruised the greatest shippe as often as any great gale of wind arose.

West, yet somewhat more southwarde, as the bendyng of the shore requyred, he entered into a sea full of herbes or weedes. The seede of the herbes whiche swymme on the water, are muche lyke the berryes of the tree called <HI>Lentiscus,</HI> whiche bear∣eth the sweete gumme called <HI>Mastix:</HI> they grewe so thycke, that they somtyme in maner stayed the shyppes. The Admiral reported, that here there is not one daye throughout all the yeere much longer or shorter then an other, and that the North pole is here eleuate onely fyue degrees as at <HI>Paria,</HI> in whose tracte all these coastes lye.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eleuation of the Pole a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Paria.</NOTE> He also declared certayne thinges as concernyng the variete of the north pole: the whiche because they seeme contrarye to thopinyons of all the Astronomers, I wyll touche them but with a drye foote, as sayth the prouerbe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note a secrete as concernyng the Pole starre.</NOTE> But it is well knowen (most noble prince) that whiche we call the pole starre, or north starre (called of the Italians <HI>Tramon∣tana</HI>) is not the very poynt of the pole Artyke, vppon the whiche the axes or extremities of heauens are turned about. The whi∣che thing may well be proued, if when the starres fyrst appeare, you beholde the pole starre through any narowe hole: For so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An experience.</NOTE> applying your instrument therto in the mornyng, somwhat be∣fore the daye spring haue blemished theyr light, yf then you looke through the same hole, you shall perceiue it to be moued from the place where you sawe it fyrst. But howe it commeth to passe, that at the begynnyng of the euenyng twilight it is eleuate in that Region only fyue degrees in the moneth of Iune, and in the mornyng twylyght to be eleuate .xv. degrees by the same quadrant, I doo not vnderstande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A marueylous secrete.</NOTE> nor yet doo the reasons whiche he bryngeth, in any poynt satysfye me. For he sayth, that he hereby coniectured, that the earth is not perfectly round: but that when it was created, there was a certayne heape raysed theron, muche hygher then the other partes of the same. So that (as he sayth) it is not rounde after the forme of an apple or a bal (as other thinke) but rather lyke a peare as it hangeth on the tree, and that <HI>Paria</HI> is the Region which possesseth the superminent or hyghest part therof nearest vnto heauen: In so muche that he earnestly contendeth, the earthly Paradyse to be sytuate in the toppes of those three hylles, whiche we sayde before, that the watchman sawe out of the toppe castel of

the shippe, and that the outragious streames of the freshe waters whiche so violentlye isshue out of the sayde gulfes, and stryue so with the salt water, fall headlong from the toppes of the saide mountaynes: But of this matter, it shall suffyce to haue sayde thus muche. Let vs nowe therefore returne to the hystorie from whiche we haue digressed. When he perceiued him selfe to be thus inwrapped in so great a gulfe beyonde his expecta∣tion, so that he had nowe no hope to fynde any passage towarde the north, wherby he myght sayle directly to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> he was enforced to turne backe the same way by the whiche he came, and directed his vyoage to <HI>Hispaniola</HI> by the north of that lande lying towarde the East. They whiche afterwarde searched this lande more curyouslye, wyll it to be parte of the continent or firme lande of India, and not of <HI>Cuba</HI> as the Admiral supposed: For there are many whiche affirme that they haue sayled round about <HI>Cuba.</HI> But whether it be so or not, or whether enuying the good fortune of this man, they seeke occasyon of quarelyng agaynst hym,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Time reuealeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l thynges.</NOTE> I can not iudge: But tyme shall speake, whiche in tyme appoynted, reuealeth both truth and falsehod.

But the Admirall agayne sent messengers to the kyng, whiche myght informe hym of theyr rebellyon, instant∣ly desyring his grace to sende hym a newe supplye of men, wherby he might suppresse theyr lecentiousnes, and punish them for theyr mischeuous actes. They accused the Admirall and his brother to be vniust men, cruel enimies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spaniar∣des accuse the Admiral.</NOTE> and shedders of the Spanyshe blood, declaryng that vppon euery lyght occasyon they woulde racke them, hang them, and head them, and that they tooke pleasure therin, and that they departed from them, as from cruell tyrantes and wylde beastes reioycyng in blood, also the kynges enimies: affyrmyng lykewyse, that they wel perceiued theyr entent to be none other then to vsurpe thempire of the Ilandes, whiche thyng (they sayde) they suspected by a thousande coniectures, and especially in that they woulde per∣mit none to resorte to the golde mynes, but only suche as were theyr familiers. The Admirall on the contrary part, when he desyred ayde of the kyng to infring theyr insolencie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Admiral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> answere.</NOTE> auouched that al those his accusers, which had deuised suche lyes agaynst hym, were noughtie felowes, abhominable knaues and vilains, theeues and bandes, ruffians, adulterers, &amp; rauishers of women, false periured vagaboundes, and such as had ben eyther conuict, in prysons, or fledde for feare of iudgement: so escaping punish∣ment, but not leauing vice, wherin they styll contynued, and brought the same with them to the iland, lyuing there in like ma∣ner as before, in thefte, lechery, &amp; all kyndes of mischeefe, and so gyuen to Idlenes and sleepe, that wheras they were brought thyther for myners, labourers, &amp; scullyans, they would not now goe one furlong from theyr houses, except they were borne on mens backes, like vnto them whiche in olde time were called <HI>Ediles Curules:</HI> For, to this office they put the miserable iland mē, whom they handled most cruelly.

These thyngs, and many suche other, the one of them laid to the others charge before the king. While these thinges were dooyng, the Admirall sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his brother the Leauetenaunt with an army of fourescore and tenne footemen, and a fewe horsemen (with three thousande of the Ilande men, whiche were mortall enimyes to the Ciguauians) to meete the people of <HI>Ciguaua,</HI> with Kyng <HI>Guarionexius</HI> theyr graunde capitayne, who had doone muche myscheefe to our men, and suche as fauoured them. Therefore when the Lieutenaunt had conducted his army to the bankes of a certeyne great ryuer runnyng by the playne, whiche we sayde before to lye betwene the corners of the mountaynes of <HI>Ciguaua</HI> and the sea, he founde two scoutes of his enimies lurkyng in certeyne bushes, where∣of the one, castyng hym selfe headlong into the sea, escaped, and by the mouth of the ryuer swamme ouer to his companions: the other being taken, declared that in the woodde on the other syde the ryuer, there lay in campe sixe thousande Ciguauians redy, vnwares to assaile our men passing bye. Wherefore the Lieute∣naunt finding a shalow place where he might passe ouer, he with his whole army entred into the ryuer, the which thing when the Ciguauians had espyed, they came runnyng out of the wooddes with a terrible crye, and most horrible aspect, much like vnto the people called <HI>Agathyrsi,</HI> of whom the poet virgil speaketh: For they were all paynted and spotted with sundry colours, and es∣peciall with blacke and red, which they make of certeyne fruites nooryshed for the same purpose in theyr gardens, with the iuyce wherof they paynt them selues from the forhead, euen to the knees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heare made long &amp; blacke by arte.</NOTE> hauyng theyr heare (whiche by art they make long and blacke, if nature deny it them) wreathed and rolled after a thou∣sande fashions, a man woulde thinke them to be deuylles incar∣nat newly broke out of hell, they are so like vnto helhoundes. As our men waded ouer the ryuer, they sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te at them, and hurled dartes so thycke, that it almost tooke the lyght of the sonne from our men: insomuche that if they had not borne of the force
<PB N="41" REF="51"/>
thereof with theyr targettes, the matter had gone wrong with them. Yet at the length, manye beyng wounded, they passed ouer the ryuer: which thyng when the enimies sawe, they fledde, whom our men pursuyng, slue some in the chase, but not manye, by reason of theyr swyftnesse of foote. Thus beyng in the wood∣des, they shotte at our men more safely, for they beyng accusto∣med to the wooddes, and naked without anye lette, passed through the bushes and shrubbes, as it had ben wylde bores or Hartes, whereas our men were hyndered by reason of theyr ap∣parell, targets, long iauelins, &amp; ignoraunce of the place. Wher∣fore, when he had rested there al that nyght in vayne, and the day folowyng he sawe no stirring in the wooddes, he went (by the counsel and conducte of the other Ilande men whiche were in his army) immediatly frō thence to the mountaynes, in the whi∣che kyng <HI>Maiobanexius</HI> had his cheefe mansion place, in the vil∣lage called <HI>Capronum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kyng Maio∣banexius.</NOTE> by the which name also the kyngs palace was called, beyng in the same village. Thus marching forwarde with his armie, about twelue myles of, he encamped in the vil∣lage of another kyng, whiche the inhabitauntes had forsaken for feare of our men: Yet makyng diligent searche, they found two, by whom they had knowledge that there was tenne kinges with <HI>Maiobanexius</HI> in his palace of <HI>Capronum,</HI> with an armie of eight thousand Ciguauians. At the Lieutenants fyrst approch, he durst not geue them battayle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An army of eight thousand Ciguauians.</NOTE> vntyll he had somewhat better searched the region: yet dyd he in the meane tyme skyrmyshe with them twyse. The next nyght about mydnyght, he sent foorth scoutes, and with them guides of the Ilande men whiche knewe the countrey: Whom the Ciguauians espying frō the mountaines, prepared them selues to the battayle, with a terrible crye or ala∣rum after their maner, but yet durst not come out of the woods, supposing that the Lieuetenant with his mayne army had ben euen at hande. The day folowyng, when he brought his army to the place where they encamped, leaping out of the wooddes, they twyse attempted the fortune of warre, fiercely assayling our men with a mayne force, and wounding many before they coulde coouer them with theyr targettes: Yet our men put them to flyght, slue manye, and tooke manye, the resydue fledde to the wooddes, where they kept them styll as in their

most safe holde. Of them whiche were taken, he sent one, and with him another of the Ilande men, which was of his part, to <HI>Maiobanexius,</HI> with commaundement in this effect, The Lieue∣tenaunt brought not hyther his army (O <HI>Maiobanexius</HI>) to kepe warre either against you, or your people, for he greatly desyreth your frendship: but his intent is, that <HI>Guarionexius,</HI> who hath per∣swaded you to be his ayde against him, to the great destruction of your people, and vndoyng of your countrey, may haue due correction, aswell for his disobedience towarde hym, as also for rays<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng tumultes among the people: Wherefore he requireth you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kyng Guari∣onexius.</NOTE> and exhorteth you to deliuer <HI>Guarionexius</HI> into his handes, the whiche thing yf you shal perfourme, the Admirall his brother wyll not only gladly admyt you to his freendshyp, but also en∣large and defende your dominion. And yf herein you refuse to accomplyshe his request, it wyll folowe, that you shal short∣lye repente you thereof: For your kyngdome shalbe wasted with sworde and fyre, and you shall abyde the fortune of warre, whereof you haue had experience with fauour, as you shall further know heareafter to your payne, yf with stubbernesse you prouoke him to shewe the vttermoste of his power. When the messenger had thus doone his arant, <HI>Maiobanexius</HI> answered, that <HI>Guarionexius</HI> was a good man, indued with many vertues as all men knewe, and therfore he thought him worthy his ayde, especially in as much as he fled to him for succoure, and that he had made him suche promise, whom also he had proued to be his faithfull frend: againe, that they were noughty men, violent, and cruell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naturall ha∣tred of vyce.</NOTE> desiring other mens goodes, and such as spared not to shed innocentes blood: in fine, that he would not haue to doo with suche myscheuous men, nor yet enter into frendshyppe with them. When these thynges came to the Lieuetenauntes eare, he commaunded the village to be burnt where he hym selfe encamped, with manye other villages there about: and when he drewe nere to the place where <HI>Maiobanexius</HI> lay, he sent mes∣sengers to him agayne, to common the matter with him, and to wyll hym to send some one of his moste faythfull frendes to entreate with hym of peace. Whereuppon the kyng sent vn∣to hym one of his cheefe gentelmen, and with hym two other to wayte on hym. When he came to the Lieuetenauntes pre∣sence,
<PB N="42" REF="52"/>
he frendly requyred hym to perswade his lord and maister in his name, and earnestly to admonishe hym,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lieuete∣naunts gentel∣nesse toward Maiobane∣xius.</NOTE> not to suffer his florishyng kyngdome to be spoyled, or hym selfe to abyde the ha∣sarde of warre for <HI>Guarionexius</HI> sake: and further to exhorte hym to delyuer hym, excepte he woulde procure the destruction both of hym selfe, his people, and his countrey. When the messenger was returned, <HI>Maiobanexius</HI> assembled the people, declaring vnto them what was doone: but they cryed out on him to deliuer <HI>Guarionexius,</HI> and began to curse the daye that euer they had re∣ceaued hym, thus to disturbe theyr quietnesse. <HI>Maiobanexius</HI> an∣swered them, that <HI>Guarionexius</HI> was a good man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rare faithful∣nesse in a bar∣barous kyng.</NOTE> &amp; had well de∣serued of him, geuing him many princely presentes, and had also taught both his wife and him to sing and daunce, which thing he did not little esteeme, and was therfore fully resolued in no case to forsake him, or agaynst al humanitie to betray hys frende, which fled to him for succoure, but rather to abide al extremities with him, then to minister occasion of obloquie to slaunderers, to reporte that he had betraied his ghest, whom he toke into his house with warranties. Thus dimissing the people, sighing and with sorowfull hartes, he called <HI>Guarionexius</HI> before him, promi∣sing him agayne, that he would be partaker of his fortune while life lasted: in so much that he thought it not best to send any fur∣ther woorde to the Lieuetenaunt, but appoynted him whom be∣fore he sent to him, to keepe the way with a garrison of men, to thintent, that yf any messengers should be sent from the Lieue∣tenaunt, to slay them by the way, and admit none to communica∣tion, or further entreatie of peace. In the meane time, the Lieu∣tenaunt sent two, wherof the one was a captiue Ciguauian, and the other an Iland man, of them which were frendes to our men: and they were both taken and slaine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lieuete∣nauntes mes∣sengers are slayne.</NOTE> The Lieutenaunt fo∣lowed them only with ten footemen &amp; foure horsemen, finding his messengers dead in the way, he was further prouoked to wrath, and determined more extremely to deale with <HI>Maioba∣nexius,</HI> &amp; therfore went forward incontinently with his whole ar∣my to his cheefe pallace of <HI>Capronum,</HI> where he yet lay incampe. At his approche, al y<SUP>e</SUP> kinges fled. euery man his way, &amp; forsoke their capitaine <HI>Maiobanexius,</HI> who also with al his famylye, fled to y<SUP>e</SUP> rough moūtaines. Some of the Ciguauians sought for
<PB REF="53"/>
<HI>Guarionexius</HI> to slay hym, for that he was the cause of all these troubles: but his feete saued his lyfe, for he fledde in tyme to the mountaines, where he lurked in maner alone among the desolate rockes. Wheras now the Lieuetenauntes souldiers were fore∣weryed with long warre, with watching, laboure, and hunger (for it was nowe three monethes sence the warres began) many desyred leaue to departe to the towre of Conception, where they had graneges, &amp; exercised tillage. He gaue them their passeports with alowance of vittayles, and so that onely thyrtie remayned with hym. These three monethes warre, they contynued very paynefull and myserablye: So that duryng al that tyme, they had none other meate but only <HI>Cazibi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spaniar∣des are painfull in the warres.</NOTE> that is, such rootes wher∣of they make theyr bread, and that but seldome to theyr fyll: al∣so <HI>Vsias,</HI> that is, lyttle beastes lyke Conyes, if by chaunce nowe and then they tooke some with theyr houndes. Their drinke was none other then water, such as they founde, somtyme sweete, and somtyme muddy, saueryng of the maryshes. Emong these delicates, that lyttle sleepe that they had, was euer for the most parte abrode vnder the firmament, and that not without watche∣men, and in continual remoouing, as the nature of warre requi∣reth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A desperate ad∣uenture with thirtie men.</NOTE> With these fewe therfore, the Lieuetenaunt determined to searche the mountaynes, dennes, and caues, if he coulde in any place fynde the steppes of <HI>Maiobanexius</HI> or <HI>Guarionexius.</HI> In the meane tyme certayne of his men (whom hunger enforced to goe a hunting, to proue if they coulde take any conies) chaunced vp∣pon two of <HI>Maiobanexius</HI> familyers, which were sent to certaine villages of his, to make prouision of bread. These he enforced to declare where theyr lorde lay hid, &amp; vsed the same also for guides, to bring our men to the place. Twelue of our men tooke this en∣terpryse in hand, painting them selues after y<SUP>e</SUP> maner of the Cig∣uauians: So that by this stratageme or policie, they came soden∣ly vppon <HI>Maiobanexius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A pollicie.</NOTE> and tooke hym prisoner, with his wyfe, children, &amp; family, and conueighed them to the towre of Concep∣tion to the Lieuetenaunt. Within a fewe dayes after, hunger compelled <HI>Guarionexius</HI> to come out of the dennes, whom cer∣taine of the people fearing the Lieuetenaunt, bewrayed to our hunters. The Lieuetenaunt being certified hereof, sent foorth a bande of foote men, commaunding them to lye in ambushe vn∣tyll
<PB N="43" REF="53"/>
suche tyme as <HI>Guarionexius</HI> went from the playnes to the mountaynes, and then sodenly to entrappe hym. They went as they were commaunded, tooke hym, and brought hym away with them, and by this meanes were al the regions neare about pacified and quieted. A certayne noble woman of neare kynred to <HI>Maiobanexius,</HI> and wyfe to another kyng, whose dominion was yet vntouched, folowed hym in all these aduersities. They affirme this woman to be the fayrest and most beautifull, that euer nature brought foorth in the Iland: Whom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A beautifull woman.</NOTE> when the king her husbande, who loued her most ardently (as her beautie deser∣ued) hearde say that she was taken prysoner, he wandered vp and downe the desartes lyke a man out of his wytte, not know∣yng what to doo or say. But at the length, he came to the Lieutenaunt, promisyng most faythfullye, that he woulde sub∣mit him selfe and al that he coulde make, vnder his power, so that he woulde restore hym his wyfe. The Lieutenaunt accep∣ted the condition, &amp; restored him his wife, with certaine other ru∣lers and gentlemen which he had taken prysoners before: char∣ging them, and bynding them with an othe, to be euer redy at his commaundement. Shortly after, this king of his owne free motion, came agayne to the Lieutenaunt, bryngyng with him fyue thousande men without weapons, sauyng only suche instru∣mentes as they vse in tyllage of theyr ground. He brought with hym also seedes to sowe, wherwith at his owne charge, he cau∣sed such plentie of theyr corne and fruites to growe in sundry pla∣ces of the larg vale, wherof we spake before, that shortly after, were seene many fayre and fruitfull feeldes that came therof: and for his gentelnesse being rewarded of the Lieuetenaunte with certayne of our thynges, he departed ioyfullye. When the report hereof came to the Ciguauians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kynges submit them selues to the Lieuetenaunt.</NOTE> it mooued the mindes of the kynges to hope of clemencie, whereuppon they came together to the Lieuetenaunt with humble submission and faith∣full promyse, euer after to be vnder his obedience, desyryng hym to restore vnto them theyr kyng with his familie. At theyr request, the kynges wyfe and his housholde was set at liber∣tie, but the king kept styl as a prysoner. These thynges dyd the Lieutenaunt in the Ilande, not yet knowyng what his aduer∣saries and accusers had layde to his charge before the kyng of
<PB REF="54"/>
Spaine: who being disquieted with theyr quarelinges and accu∣sations, and especially for that by reason of theyr discention, of so greate abundance of golde and other thynges, there was as yet but lyttle brought into Spayne, appoynted a newe gouernour, which shoulde see a redresse in these thynges:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A newe gouer∣nour of the Ilande.</NOTE> and eyther to pu∣nyshe such as were fautie, or els to sende them to him. What was founde agaynst the Admirall and his brother, or agaynst his aduersaries which accused hym, I do not well knowe. But this I am sure of, that both the brethren are taken, brought, and caste in prison, with theyr goodes confiscate. But as soone as the king vnderstode that they were brought bounde to Cales, he sent messengers in poste, with commaundement that they should be loosed and come freely to his presence: wherby he de∣clared that he toke their troubles greeuously. It is also said, that the new gouernour sent letters to the kyng, written with the Ad∣miralles hand in straunge and vnknowen sypheringes, to his brother the Lieuetenaunt being absent, wyllyng hym to be in a redynes with a power of armed men to come and ayd hym, if the Gouernoure should proffer hym any violence. Wherof the go∣uernour hauing knowledge (as he sayth) beyng also aduertised that the Lieuetenaunt was gone to his brother before the men whiche he had prepared were in a redines, apprehended them both vnwares, before the multitude came togeather. What wyl folowe, tyme, the most true and prudent Iudge wyll declare. Thus fare ye well.</P>

many had lycences graunted them of the kyng to seeke further at theyr owne charges, vpon condition to pay hym faythfully his portion, which is the fyfte part. But because amonge all other, one <HI>Petrus Alphonsus,</HI> called <HI>Nignus</HI> by his surname,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nauigati∣on of Petrus Alphonsus.</NOTE> sayled to∣warde the south with more prosperous fortune then any of the other, I thinke it best first to speake somewhat of his voyage. He therfore with only one shyp, well furnished at his owne char∣ges, after that he had his passeporte, with commaundement in no case to cast anker past fyftye leagues distant from anye place where the Admirall had touched, sayled fyrst to <HI>Paria,</HI> where the Admiral founde both the men and women so laden with cheines, garlandes, and braselettes of pearles, as we haue sayde before. Coastyng therfore along by the same shore, accordyng to the kings commaundement (yet leauing behynd hym the regions of <HI>Cumana</HI> and <HI>Manacapana</HI>) he came to the regions which thinha∣bitantes therof cal <HI>Curiana,</HI> where he found a hauen (as he saith) much lyke the port of <HI>Gades</HI> or <HI>Cales</HI>: into the which enteryng, he sawe a farre of certayne houses one the shore, and perceyued, when he drewe neere, that it was a village of only eyght houses. Proceading yet further for the space of three myles, he espied an other village well replenyshed with people, where there met hym fyftye naked men on a company, hauing with them a cer∣tayne ruler, who desyred Alphonsus to come to theyr coastes. He brought with hym at thys tyme, many haukes belles, pyn∣nes, nedels, braselettes, cheynes, garlandes, and rynges, with counterfet stones and glasses, and such other tryfelles, the which within the moment of an houre, he had exchaunged for fyfteene ounces of theyr pearles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearles for tryfles.</NOTE> which they wore aboute theyr neckes and armes.

He condiscended to theyr request: and the day folowing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great plentie of pearles.</NOTE> came to the place where they ap∣poynted hym: Lying there at anker, a great multitude of people resorted to hym, instantly requyring hym to come alande. But when he consydered the innumerable multitude of people which was there assembled, and he had only .xxxiii. men in his com∣pany, he durst not commit hym selfe to theyr handes, but gaue them to vnderstand by sygnes and tokens, that they shoulde
<PB REF="55"/>
come to the shyp with their <HI>Canoas</HI>: for their boates (which the men of the iland cal <HI>Canoas</HI>) are made only of one whole peece of wood as in the Ilandes, yet more rude, and not so artificially as theyrs are: these they call <HI>Gallitas.</HI> These swarmed therfore to the shyp as faste as they might, bringyng with them greate plenty of pearles (which they cal <HI>Tenoras</HI>) exchanging the same for our marchaundies. He founde this people to be of gentyll nature, simple, and innocent, being conuersant with them in theyr houses, for the space of xx. dayes. Theyr houses are made of wood, couered with the leaues of date trees. Their meate for the moste parte, is the shelfyshes in the which the pearles are en∣gendered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shel fyshes in which pearles are engendred.</NOTE> wherof their sea costes are full. They haue also greate plenty of wyld beastes, as hartes, wyld bores, and connies like vnto hares, both in coloure and bignesse, stocke doues also, and turtle doues: lykewyse geese and duckes, which they norishe in theyr houses as we doo. Peacockes flee aboute in maner in euery wood and groue, but they are not distinct with sundry co∣lours as ours are: for the cockes are like vnto the hennes. These people of <HI>Curiana</HI> are craftie hunters, and exceding cunning ar∣chers, so that they will not lyghtly misse any beaste or byrde that they shoote at. Our men consumed certayne dayes heare very plesauntely: duryng which time, whosoeuer brought them a peacocke, had for the same foure pinnes: he that brought a phea∣saunte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theyr manner of bargayning.</NOTE> had two, and for a stocke doue, or turtle doue, one, and for a goose, a smale looking glasse, or a litle stone of glasse. Thus they bought and solde with profering and bydding, denying and refusing, as it had byn in a greate market. When pinnes were profered them, they asked what they shoulde do with them, be∣ing naked: But our men satisfied them with a craftie answere, declaring by tokens that they were very necessary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vse of pynnes.</NOTE> to picke theyr teeth, and to pull thornes out of theyr fleshe. But aboue al thyn∣ges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haukes belles in great estima∣tion.</NOTE> haukes belles were most esteemed among them, for theyr sound &amp; faire colour, and woulde therfore geue much for one of them.

naked, with theyr bowes and arrowes, yet hath it not ben harde of, that any man hath ben slayne of any wylde beast. As many hartes or wylde bores as our men woulde desyre them to bryng, they woulde kyll in the woodes with their arrowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hartes and wylde bores.</NOTE> and not to fayle to bryng them. They lacke kyne, goates and sheepe. Theyr bread is made of rootes, as is theyrs of the Ilands. This nation, hath blacke heare, grosse and somwhat curlde, yet long also. They keepe theyr teeth very whyte, and for that purpose vse to cary a certaine herbe betwene theyr lyppes for the most part of the day, and to washe theyr mouthts when they cast it away. The women doo all theyr busynes at home in theyr how∣ses, and haue also the cure of tyllage of the grounde: but the men apply them selues to the warres and huntyng, to playe, syng∣yng and daunsyng. They haue sundry kyndes of water pottes, iugges, and drinkyng cuppes made of earth in other places about them, and brought thyther for exchaung of other thynges: For they vse fayres and markettes for the same purpose, and are greatly desyrous of such thynges, as are not brought forth or made in theyr countrey, as nature hath geuen a disposytion to al men, to desyre and be delyted with newe and strang thynges.

Whereupon our men directed theyr voyage thy∣ther immediatly, and aryued there at the Kalendes of No∣uember, in the yeere of Christe a thousande and fyue hun∣dred. The people of the countrey resorted to them without feare, bryngyng with them of the golde whiche we sayde to be natiue in that region. This people had also collers of pearles about theyr neckes, which were brought them from <HI>Curiana</HI> for exchaunge of theyr marchandises. None of them woulde ex∣chaunge anye of those thynges whiche they had out of other countreys: as neyther the Curians golde, nor the Canchietans pearles: yet among the Canchietans they founde but lytle golde redy geathered. They toke with them from thence certayne very fayre Marmasets or Munkeyes, and many Popyngayes of sun∣drye coloures. In the moneth of Nouember, the ayre was there most temperate, and nothyng colde.

These dryed carcases, they haue in great reue∣rence, and honour them for theyr houshoulde and famylier gods. They say that in this place they sawe a man, &amp; in an other place a woman, thus dryed and reserued. When they departed from <HI>Curiana,</HI> the .viii. day of the Ides of February, to returne to Spayne, they had threescore and .xvi. poundes weight (after .viii. vnces to the pounde) of pearles, which they bought for exchange of our thinges, amounting to the value of fyue shillinges. Depar∣ting therfore, they consumed threescore dayes in theyr iourney (although it were shorter then from <HI>Hispaniola</HI>) by reason of the continuall course of the sea in the west, which dyd not only great∣ly stey the shippe, but also somtymes dryue it backe.

There fore, at the rysyng of the sonne, fortie of our men well armed, wente towarde them: agaynst whom came forth .xxxii. of them, with bowes, slynges and dartes, euen redy to fyght.

It is therefore apparant by the images whi∣che they honour openly and commonly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idolatrie and idolles.</NOTE> that there appeare vnto them in the nyght seasons, certayne phantasies and illusions of euil spirites, seducing them into many fonde and foolish errours: for they make certayne images of Gossampine cotton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Illusions of euil spirites. Images of gossampine catton.</NOTE> folded or wreathed after theyr manner, and hard stopped within. These images they make syttyng, muche lyke vnto the pyctures of spirites and deuyls which our paynters are accustomed to paynt vpon walles: but forasmuche as I mee selfe sent you foure of these images, you may better presently signifie vnto the kyng your vncle, what manner of thynges they are, and howe like vn∣to paynted deuylles, then I can expresse the same by wrytyng. These images, the inhabitantes call <HI>Zemes,</HI> whereof the leaste, made to the lykenesse of young deuyls, they bynde to their fore∣heades when they goe to the warres agaynst theyr enimies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Young deuyls.</NOTE> and for that purpose haue they those stringes hangyng at them which you see. Of these, they beleeue to obteyne rayne, yf rayne be lackyng, lykewyse fayre weather: for they thynke that these <HI>Zemes</HI> are the mediatours and messengers of the great god, whom they acknowledge to be only one, eternal, without ende, omnipotent, and inuisible. Thus euery king hath his particuler <HI>Zemes,</HI> whiche he honoureth. They cal the eternal god by these two names, <HI>Iocauna</HI> and <HI>Guamaonocon,</HI> as theyr predecessours taught them, affyrmyng that he hath a father called by these fiue names: that is, <HI>Attabeira, Mamona, Guacarapita, Liella, Guima∣zoa.</HI> Nowe shal you heare what they fable on the earth as tou∣ching the original of man There is in the Iland, a region called <HI>Caunana,</HI> where they fayne that manknyde came fyrst out of two caues of a mountayne: and that the byggest sorte of men came forth of the mouth of the byggest caue, and the least sort out of the least caue.

They say furthermore, that a certayne ruler called <HI>Vagoniona,</HI> sent one foorth of the caue to goe a fyshyng, who by like chaunce was turned into a Nyghtingale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nygh∣tyngale.</NOTE> because the sunne was rysen be∣fore he came agayne to the caue: and that yeerely about the same time that he was turned into a byrde, he doth in the nyght with a mournyng song bewayle his mysfortune, and call for the helpe of his maister <HI>Vagoniona:</HI> And this they thynke to be the cause why that byrd syngeth in the nyght season.

I haue therfore chosen these fewe thynges, out of a greate heape of such as seemed to me most worthy to be noted among the large wrytynges of the aucthoures and searchers of the same. Wher∣fore, forasmuch as you haue endeuored to wrest out of my han∣des the whole example of all my woorkes, to adde the same to the innumerable volumes of your lybrarie, I thought it good nowe to make a breefe rehersall of those thynges which were done from that yeare of a thousand and fiue hundred, euen vnto this yeare which is the tenth from that:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The history fo∣lowyng, con∣teyneth the actes of ten yeeres.</NOTE> For I entend to wryte more largely of these thynges heareafter, if god graunt me lyfe. I had written a whole booke by it selfe of the superstytions of the people of the iland, supposyng therwyth to haue accomply∣shed the whole Decade consisting of ten bookes. But I haue ad∣ded this to the tenth as a perpendyculer lyne, and as it were a backe guide or rerewarde to the other: So that you may knytte the fyrst tenth to the nynth, &amp; impute this to occupye the place of the tenth to fyll vp the Decade.

Yet in some places, although they be naked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fiercenesse of the naked people.</NOTE> they ouercame our men, and slewe whole armyes. For they are exceedyng fyerce, and vse venemous arrowes, and

long staues lyke iauelens, made hard at the ende with fire. They founde many beastes, both creepyng and foure footed, much dyfferyng from ours, varyable and of sundrye shapes innume∣rable: yet not hurtfull, except Lions, Tigers, and Crocodiles. This I meane in sundry regions of that greate lande of <HI>Paria,</HI> but not in the ilandes: no not so muche as one, for all the beastes of the ilandes, are meeke and without hurte, except men, which (as wee haue sayde) are in many ilandes deuourers of mans fleshe. There are also dyuers kyndes of foules. And in many places battes of such bygnes, that they are equall with turtle doues.

In an other place, where certaine of them slept in the night season on the sands by the sea syde, a mon∣ster commyng out of the sea, came vpon one of them secretelye, and caryed hym away by the myddest out of the syght of his fe∣lowes, to whom he cryed in vayne for helpe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A man deuou∣red of a mon∣ster of the sea.</NOTE> vntyl the beast leapt into the sea with her pray. It was the kynges pleasure that they shoulde remayne in these landes, and buylde townes and fortres∣ses: whereunto they were so well wyllyng, that diuers profered them selues to take vpon them the subduyng of the lande, ma∣kyng great suite to the kyng that they myght be appoynted thereto.

When <HI>Fogeda</HI> had entred into the hauen, he enuaded, slue, and spoyled the people, whom he founde naked and scattered: for they were geuen him for a pray by the kynges letters patentes, because they had ben before tyme cruell agaynst the Christians, and coulde neuer be allured to permytte them quietlye to come within theyr dominions.

and seuen hundred fourescore and fyfteene men. For the greater number of souldyers folowed <HI>Nicuesa,</HI> bothe because free lybertye was geuen them to choose which of the capytaynes them lyst, and also that by reason of his age, he was of greater aucthorytie: But esspetially because the rumoure was that <HI>Beragua</HI> being by the kyngs commission appoynted to <HI>Nicuesa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The regions of Vraba and Beragua.</NOTE> was rycher in golde then <HI>Vraba</HI> assygned to <HI>Alphonsus Fogeda.</HI> Therfore, at the arryual of <HI>Nicuesa,</HI> they consulted what was best to be doone: and determyned fyrste to reuenge the deathe of theyr felowes.

East coastes of <HI>Vraba,</HI> whiche the inhabitauntes call <HI>Carihana,</HI> from whence the Caribes or Canibales of the Ilandes are sayd to haue theyr name and originall. Here he began to builde a for∣tresse, and a vyllage neere vnto the same, therein intendyng to place theyr fyrst habitation. Shortly after, beyng instructed by certayne captyues, that there was about twelue myles further within the lande, a certayne vyllage called <HI>Tirufi,</HI> hauyng in it a ryche golde myne, he determined to destroy the village, to the which when he came, he founde the inhabitantes redy to defende theyr ryght, and that so stoutlye, that encounteryng with them, he was repulsed with shame and domage: for these people also vse bowes and venemous arrowes. Within a fewe dayes after, beyng enforced for lacke of vittualles to inuade another village, he hym selfe was strycken in the thygh with an arrowe. Some of his felowes say, that he was thus wounded of one of the inha∣bitauntes whose wyfe he had ledde away captiue before. They say also that he had fyrst frendlye communed with <HI>Fogeda</HI> for re∣deeming of his wife, and had appoynted a day to bring a portion of golde for her raunsome, and that he came at the day assigned, not laden with golde, but armed with bowes and arrowes, with eyght other confederate with hym, which had ben before parta∣kers of the iniuries done to them fyrst at the hauen of <HI>Carthago,</HI> and afterward at the burnyng of the vyllage, in reuenge wher∣of, they had desperately consecrated them selues to death: But the matter beyng knowen, the captayne of this conspiracie was slayne of <HI>Fogeda</HI> his companions, and his wyfe deteyned in cap∣tiuitie. <HI>Fogeda</HI> also through the maliciousnesse of the venime, consumed and was dried vp by lytle &amp; litle.

departyng from <HI>Coiba,</HI> went to the prouince or Lieuetenaunt∣shyp of <HI>Fogeda</HI> his companion. Within a fewe dayes after, he hym selfe entryng into one of those marchaunt shyppes whi∣che the Spanyardes call <HI>Carauelas,</HI> commaunded that the big∣ger vessels should folow farre behinde. He tooke with hym two smal shyppes commonly called Bergandines or Brigandines. I haue thought it good in al the discourse of these bookes, to vse the common names of thinges, because I had rather be playne then curious, especially forasmuche as there do dayly aryse ma∣ny newe thynges vnknowen to the antiquitie, whereof they haue left no true names.

With the vyttualles which this shyppe brought, they refreshed them selues, and somewhat recouered theyr strengthes, muche weakened for lacke of meate. <HI>Fogeda</HI> his companions whyspered and muttered agaynst hym daylye more and more, that he fedde them foorth with vayne hope: for he had tolde them that he left <HI>Ancisus</HI> in <HI>Hispaniola</HI> (whom he chose by the kinges commission to be a iudge in causes, because he was learned in the law) to come shortly after him with a shyp laden with vyttualles, and that he marueyled that he was not come many dayes synce. And herein he sayd nothing but trueth: for when he departed, he left <HI>Ancisus</HI> halfe redye to folowe hym. But his felowes supposyng that al that he had sayde of <HI>Ancisus</HI> had ben fayned, some of them determined priuily to steale away the two Brigandines from <HI>Fogeda,</HI> and to returne to <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> But <HI>Fogeda</HI> hauyng knowledge hereof, preuented theyr deuice: for leauyng y<SUP>e</SUP> custodie of the fortresse with a certayne noble gen∣tleman called <HI>Francisco Pizarro,</HI> he him selfe thus wounded, with a fewe other in his companye, entred into the shyppe wherof we spake before, and sayled directly to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> both to heale the wounde of his thygh, yf any remedie myght be found,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fogeda retur∣neth to Hispa∣niola.</NOTE> and also to knowe what was the cause of <HI>Ancisus</HI> tarying: leauyng hope with his felowes (whiche were nowe brought from three hun∣dred to threescore, partly by famine, and partly by warre) that he woulde returne within the space of .xv. dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Famine.</NOTE> prescribyng

also a condition to <HI>Pizarro</HI> and his companions, that it should not be imputed to them for treason, to depart from thence yf he came not agayne at the day appoynted, with vyttuales, and a newe supplye of men. These .xv. dayes beyng nowe past, wheras they coulde yet heare nothyng of <HI>Fogeda,</HI> and were dayly more and more oppressed with sharpe hunger, they entred into the two Brigandines which were left, and departed from that land. And as they were nowe saylyng on the mayne sea towarde <HI>His∣paniola,</HI> a tempest sodaynely arysyng, swalowed one of the Bri∣gandines with all that were therein.

Proceeding there∣fore on theyr voyage, they mette by chaunce with <HI>Ancisus,</HI> be∣twene the hauen of <HI>Carthago,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The region of Cuchibacoa.</NOTE> and the region of <HI>Cuchibacoa</HI> in the mouth of the riuer whiche the Spanyardes called <HI>Boium gatti,</HI> that is, the house of the catte, because they sawe a catte fyrste in that place: <HI>Boium,</HI> in the tongue of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> is a house. <HI>Ancisus</HI> came with a shyppe laden with al thynges necessarie, both for meate, and drynke, and apparell, bryngyng also with hym an another Brigandine. This is he for whose commyng the cap∣tayne <HI>Fogeda</HI> looked for so long. He loosed anker from <HI>Hispani∣ola</HI> in the Ides of September: and y<SUP>e</SUP> fourth day after his depar∣ture, he espyed certayne hygh mountaynes, the whiche for the a∣bundance of snow which lieth there continually in the tops therof, the Spanyards called <HI>Serra Neuata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serra Neuata.</HI></NOTE> when <HI>Colonus</HI> the fyrst fyn∣der of those regions passed by the same.

The Brigandiners o∣beyed &amp; folowed him: yet made they humble suite vnto him that
<PB N="61" REF="71"/>
he woulde graunt them that with his fauour they myght eyther goe agayne to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> or that he hym selfe would bring them to <HI>Nicuesa:</HI> and that they woulde for his gentlenesse, declared to∣warde them in this behalfe, rewarde hym with two thousande drammes of golde: for they were ryche in golde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riche in golde, and poore in bread.</NOTE> but poore in bread. But <HI>Ancisus</HI> assented to neyther of theyr requestes, af∣fyrmyng that he myght by no meanes goe any other way, then to <HI>Vraba</HI> the prouince assigned to <HI>Fogeda.</HI> Whereupon, by theyr conduct, he tooke his voyage directly towarde <HI>Vraba,</HI> But nowe let it not seeme tedious to your holynesse, to heare of one thyng woorthy to be remembred, whiche chaunced to this Lieuetenant <HI>Ancisus</HI> as he came thyther: for he also cast anker in the coastes of the region of <HI>Caramairi,</HI> whiche we sayde to be famous, by rea∣son of the hauen of <HI>Carthago,</HI> and of the goodly stature, strength, and beautie both of men and women beyng in the same. Here he sent certayne to goe alande on the shore both to fetch fresh water, &amp; also to repayre the ship boate which was sore bruised. In this meane tyme, a great multitude of the people of the countrey, ar∣med after theyr manner, came about our men, as they were occu∣pyed about theyr busynesse, and stoode in a redynesse to fyght, for the space of three dayes continually, duryng whiche time, ney∣ther durst they set vpon our men, nor our men assaile them. Thus both parties keepyng theyr aray, stoode styll three whole dayes, the one gasyng on the other. Yet al this tyme our men applyed theyr woorke, placyng the shypwryghtes in the myddest of theyr armie. As they stoode thus amased, two of our company went to fyll theyr water pottes at the mouth of the ryuer neere vnto them both, where sodenly there came foorth agaynst them a cap∣tayne of the barbarians with tenne armed men, whiche inclosed them, and with terrible countenance bent theyr arrowes against them, but shot them not of. One of our men fledde, but the other remayned, callyng his felowe agayne, and rebukyng hym for his fearefulnesse. Then he spake to the barbarians in theyr owne language, whiche he had learned beyng conuersaunt with the captiues that were caryed from thence long before. They marueylyng to heare a stranger speake in theyr natiue tongue, put of theyr fiercenesse, and fell to frendly communication, de∣maundyng who were the captaynes of that company whiche
<PB REF="72"/>
were aryued in theyr lande. He aunswered that they were strangers passing by, and that he marueyled why they would at∣tempt to driue them from theyr coastes, and disturbe their shyps: arguyng them of follie and crueltie, and further threatnyng their ruine and destruction, except they woulde vse them selues more frendely towarde them. For he aduertised them that there woulde shortlye come into theyr lande armed men, in number like vnto the sandes of the sea, and that to theyr vtter destruction, not only yf they resysted them not, but also except they receiued them, and entertayned them honourably. In the meane time, <HI>Ancisus</HI> was enfourmed that his men were deteyned: wherefore suspectyng some deceyte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vse of tar∣gets agaynst venemous arrowes.</NOTE> he brought foorth all his target men, for feare of theyr venemous arrowes: and settyng them in battel araye, he marched forwarde towarde them whiche stayed his men. But he whiche communed with the barbarians, geuyng hym a signe with his hande to proceede no further, he stayed, and callyng to hym the other, he knewe that all was safe: for the bar∣barians profered hym peace, because they were not they whom they suspected them to haue ben, meanyng by <HI>Fogeda</HI> &amp; <HI>Nicuesa,</HI> who had spoyled the vyllage standyng there by the sea syde, and caryed away many captiues, and also burnt another vyllage fur∣ther within the lande. And therefore (as they sayde) the cause of theyr commyng thyther, was to reuenge those iniuries, yf by any meanes they coulde, yet that they woulde not exercise theyr weapons agaynst the innocent:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The barbari∣ans haue re∣spect to iustice.</NOTE> for they sayd, it was vngodly to fyght agaynst any, not beyng prouoked. Laying apart therefore theyr bowes and arrowes, they enterteyned our men gentelly, and gaue them great plentie of salted fyshe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salted fyshe.</NOTE> and bread of theyr countrey, and filled theyr vessels with Syder made of their coun∣trey fruites and seedes, not inferior to wine in goodnesse. Thus <HI>Ancisus</HI> hauing entred into frendship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wine of fruites and seedes.</NOTE> and made a league of peace with thinhabitantes of <HI>Caramairi,</HI> which were before sore prouo∣ked by other captaynes, he lanched from that lande, and directed his course to <HI>Vraba</HI> by the Ilande <HI>Fortis,</HI> hauing in his shippe a hundred and fyftie freshe men, whiche were substitute in the place of suche as were dead: also twelue Mares, and manye swine, and other beastes both males and females for encrease. Lykewyse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Artyllerie.</NOTE> fyftie peeces of ordinaunce, with great multi∣tude

of targettes, swoordes, iauelyns, and suche other weapons for the warres, but all this with euil speede, and in an euil houre: for as they were euen nowe entryng into the hauen, the gouer∣nour of the shyppe whiche sate at the helme, stroke the shyppe vpon the sandes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancisus shyp∣wracke.</NOTE> where it was so fast enclosed and beaten with the waues of the sea, that it opened in the myddest, and all lost that was therein, a thyng surelye miserable to beholde: for of all the vyttualles that they had, they saued only twelue barrelles of meale, with a fewe cheeses, and a lytle bysket bread, for al the beastes were drowned, and they them selues escaped hard∣ly and halfe naked, by helpe of the Brigandine and ship boate, carying with them only a fewe weapons. Thus they fell from one calamitie into another, beyng nowe more carefull for theyr lyues then for golde. Yet beyng brought alyue and in health to that lande whiche they so greatly desyred, they coulde do no lesse then to prouide for the susteynyng of theyr bodyes, because they coulde not lyue only by ayre: and whereas theyr owne fayled, they must needes lyue by other mens. Yet among these so many aduersities, one good chaunce offered it selfe vnto them: for they founde, not farre from the sea syde, a groue of Date trees, among the which, and also among the reeke or weedes of the marishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A groue of date trees.</NOTE> they espyed a multitude of wylde bores, with whose fleshe they fed thē selues wel certayne dayes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wylde bores.</NOTE> These they say to be lesse then ours, and with so short tayles, that they thought they had ben cut of. They differ also from ours in theyr feete: for theyr hinder feete are whole vndiuided, and also without any hoofe. But they affirme that they haue prooued by experience, theyr fleshe to be of better taste and more wholsome then ours. During this time, they fed also of Dates, and the rootes of young Date trees, whi∣che they eate likewise in Ciuile and <HI>Granata,</HI> where they call them <HI>Palmitos,</HI> of y<SUP>e</SUP> leaues wherof they make bees<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes in Rome.

as doth the orange tree. These apples are good to be eaten, and haue a certayne sweetenesse myxte with a gentyll sharpnesse, as haue the fruites called <HI>Sorbes.</HI> Thinhabytantes plant these trees in theyr orchyardes and gardens, and noryshe them with greate diligence as we do cheries, peaches, and quinses. This tree in leaues, heyght, and trunke, is very lyke vnto the tree that bea∣reth the fruyte called <HI>Zizipha,</HI> which the Apothecaries call <HI>Iuiuba.</HI> But whereas now the wylde bores began to fayle them, they were agayne enforced to consulte and prouyde for the tyme to come: Whereuppon with theyr whole armye, they entered further into the land. The Canibales of this prouynce, are most expert archers. <HI>Ancisus</HI> had in his companye, a hundred men. They mette by the way with only three men of thinhabitantes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men of despe∣rate boldenesse.</NOTE> naked, and armed with bowes &amp; venomous arowes, who with∣out all feare, assayled our men fyercesly, wounded manye, and slue manye, and when they emptyed theyr quiuers, fledde as swyftely as the wynde: For (as we haue saide) they are exceding swyfte of foote by reason of theyr loose gooing from theyr chyl∣des age, they affyrme that they lette slyp no arrowe out of theyr bowes in vayne. Our men therfore returned the same way that they came, muche more vnfortunate then they were before, and consulted among them selues to leaue the land, especialy because the inhabytantes had ouerthrowne the fortresse which <HI>Fogeda</HI> buylded, and had burnt thyrtie houses of the vyllage, as soone as <HI>Pizarrus</HI> and his company lefte of <HI>Fogeda,</HI> and forsaken the land. By this occasion therfore, being dryuen to seeke further, they had intelligence that the west syde of that goulfe of <HI>Vraba,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The gulfe of Vraba.</NOTE> was more fruitfull &amp; better to inhabite. Wherfore, they sent the one halfe of theyr men thither with the brigandine, and left the other neere to the sea syde on the east part. This gulfe, is fourteene myles in breadth, and howe muche the further it entereth into the fyrme lande, it is so much the narower. Into the gulfe of <HI>Vraba,</HI> there fall many ryuers, but one (as they saye) more fortu∣nate then the ryuer of <HI>Nilus</HI> in Egypt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great riuer of Darien.</NOTE> This ryuer is called <HI>Da∣rien,</HI> vpon the bankes whereof, being very fruitfull of trees and grasse, they entended to plante theyr newe colonye or habita∣tion. But the inhabytantes marueylyng at the brigandyne be∣ing bigger then theyr canoas, and specially at the sayles
<PB N="63" REF="73"/>
therof, fyrst sent away theyr chyldren and weakesse sort of theyr people with theyr baggage and houshould stuffe, and assembled all suche togeather both men and women, as were meete for the warres. Thus beyng armed with weapons and desperate min∣des, they stoode in a redynesse to fyght, and taryed the comming of our men vpon a lytle hyll, as it were to take the aduauntage of the grounde: our men iudged them to be about fiue hundred in number. Then <HI>Ancisus</HI> the captayne of our men, and Lieue∣tenaunt in the steede of <HI>Fogeda,</HI> settyng his men in order of bat∣tayle aray, and with his whole company kneeling on his knees, they all made humble prayers to GOD for the victorie, and a vowe to the image of the blessed virgin whiche is honoured in Ciuile, by the name of <HI>Sancta Maria Antiqua,</HI> promysyng to sende her many golden gyftes, and a straunger of that countrey: also, to name the vyllage <HI>Sancta Maria Antiqua</HI> after her name: lykewyse to erecte a temple called by the same name, or at the least to dedicate the king of that prouince his pallace to that vse, if it should please her to assist them in this dangerous enter∣prise. This done, al the souldiers toke an oth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The souldiers make an othe.</NOTE> that no man should turne his backe to his enimies. Then y<SUP>e</SUP> captayne commaunding them to be in a redynesse with theyr targets and iauelyns, and the trumpetter to blowe the battayle, they fiercely assayled theyr enimies with a larome: but the naked barbarians, not long able to abyde the force of our men, were put to flight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The barbari∣ans are dryuen to flyght.</NOTE> with theyr kyng and captayne <HI>Cemaccus.</HI> Our men entred into the vyllage, where they founde plentie of meate, such as the people of the countrey vse, sufficient to asswage theyr present hunger, as bread made of rootes, with certayne fruites vnlyke vnto ours, whiche they reserue for store, as we doo Chestnuttes. Of these people, the men are vtterly naked, but the women, from the nauel downe∣warde are couered with a fyne cloth made of gossampine cot∣ton. This region is vtterly without any sharpenesse of wynter: for the mouth of this ryuer of <HI>Darien,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The riuer of Darien, but vii. degrees from the Equi∣noctial lyne.</NOTE> is onlye eyght degrees distaunt from the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> lyne, so that the common sorte of our men, scarcely perceyue any dyfference in length betweene the day and nyght all the whole yeere: but because they are ig∣noraunt in astronomie, they can perceyue no small dyfference. Therefore we neede not muche passe if the degree differ some∣what

from theyr opinion, forasmuche as the dyfference can not be great. The day after that they aryued at the lande, they say∣led along by the ryuer, where they founde a great thycket of reedes, continuyng for the space of a myle in length, supposing (as it chaunced in deede) that the borderers thereabout whiche had fled, had eyther lyen lurkyng there, or els to haue hid theyr stuffe among those reedes: Whereupon, armyng them selues with theyr targets, for feare of the people lying in ambushe, they searched the thycket diligently,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Golde founde in a thycket of reedes.</NOTE> and founde it without men, but replenyshed with housholde stuffe and golde. They founde also a great multitude of shetes, made of the silke or cotton of the gos∣sampine tree: lykewyse diuers kyndes of vessels &amp; tooles made of wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brest plates of golde.</NOTE> and many of earth: also many brest plates of golde, and ouches wrought after theyr manner, to the summe of a hundred &amp; two pound weight: for they also take pleasure in the beautie of golde, and worke it very artificially, although it be not the pryce of thyngs among them as with vs. They haue it out of other re∣gions, for exchaunge of such thynges as theyr countrey bringeth forth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The golden regions are for the most part barren.</NOTE> for such regions as haue plentie of bread and gossampine, lacke golde, and suche as bryng forth golde, are for the most part rough with mountaynes and rockes, and therefore barren: and thus they exercise marchandies without the vse of money. Re∣ioysyng therefore with double gladnesse, aswel in that they sawe great lykenesse of golde, as also that fortune had offered them so fayre and fruiteful a countrey, they sent for theyr felowes whom they had left before in the East syde of the gulfe of <HI>Vraha.</HI> Yet some say, that the ayre is there vnwholsome, because that part of the region lyeth in a lowe valley, enuironed with mountaynes and maryshes.</P>

Yet of theyr soundeste plankes, wyth other newe, made of the trees of that Region (which they saye to be exceeding bigge and hygh) they framed a new carauell shortelye after, whiche they myght vse to serue for theyr necessitie.

After they had sayled about the space of sixteene myles, a certaine young man, whose name was Gre∣gorie, a Genues borne, and of a chylde brought vp with <HI>Colonus,</HI> called to remembraunce that there was a hauen not farre from thence: and to prooue his sayinges true, he gaue his felowes these tokens, that is, that they shoulde fynde vpon the shore, an anker of a lost shyppe halfe couered with sande, and vnder a tree next vnto the hauen a spryng of cleare water. They came to the lande, founde the anker and the spryng, and commended the wytte and memorie of the young man, that he onlye among manye of the Maryners which had searched those coastes with <HI>Colonus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The commen∣dation of a young man brought vp with Colonus. <HI>Portus Bellus.</HI></NOTE> bore the thyng so well in mynde.

They consulted to leaue the one halfe of theyr felowes in the ha∣uen of <HI>Portus Bellus,</HI> &amp; the other part <HI>Nicuesa</HI> toke with hym to∣warde the East, where about twentie and eyght myles from

<HI>Portus Bellus,</HI> he entended to buylde a fortresse harde by the sea syde, vpon the poynt or cape, whiche in tyme past <HI>Colonus</HI> named <HI>Marmor,</HI> but they were so feeble by reason of long hunger,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cape Mar∣mor.</HI></NOTE> that theyr strength serued them not to susteyne suche labour, yet he erected a lytle towre, able to resyst the fyrst assaulte of the inha∣bitauntes: this towre he called <HI>Nomen Dei.</HI> From the tyme that he left <HI>Beragua,</HI> what in the iourney among the sandie playnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nomen Dei.</HI></NOTE> then also for hunger while he builded the towre, of the fewe whi∣che remayned alyue, he lost two hundred. And thus by litle and lytle, the multitude of seuen hundred, fourescore, and fyue men, was brought nowe to scarcelye one hundred. Whyle <HI>Nicuesa</HI> lyued with these fewe miserable men, there arose a contention among them of <HI>Vraba,</HI> as concernyng the Lieuetenantshyppe: for one <HI>Vascus Nunnez,</HI> by the iudgement of al men, trustyng more to his strength then wit, styrred vp certayne light felowes agaynst <HI>Ancisus,</HI> saying that <HI>Ancisus</HI> had not the kyngs letters patentes for that office, and that it was not sufficient that he was aucthorised by <HI>Fogeda,</HI> and therefore forbode that he should execute the office of the Lieuetenauntshyp, and wylled them to choose certayne of theyr owne companye, by whose counsayle and aucthoritie they myght be gouerned. Thus being diuided into factions, by reason that <HI>Fogeda</HI> theyr captayne came not a∣gayne, whom they supposed to be nowe dead of his venemous wound, they contended whether it were best to substitute <HI>Nicue∣sa</HI> in his place. The wysest sort, suche as were familier with <HI>Ni∣cuesa,</HI> &amp; could not beare the insolencie of <HI>Vascus Nunnez,</HI> thought it good that <HI>Nicuesa</HI> shoulde be sought out throughout all those coastes: for they had knowledge that he departed from <HI>Beragua,</HI> because of the barrennesse of the grounde, and that by the exam∣ple of <HI>Ancisus,</HI> and suche other as had made shypwracke, it were possible that he myght wander in some secrete place, and that they coulde not be quiet in theyr myndes, vntyl they knewe the certayntie whether he with his felowes were aliue or dead. But <HI>Vascus Nunnez,</HI> fearyng lest at the commyng of <HI>Nicuesa,</HI> he shoulde not be had in aucthoritie among his felowes, sayd they were mad men to thynke that <HI>Nicuesa</HI> lyued, and although he were alyue, yet that they had no neede of his helpe: for he auouched that there was none of his felowes, that were not

Of the nauigation of this <HI>Colmenaris,</HI> I entend to speake somewhat more. He therfore departed from the hauen of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> called <HI>Beata</HI> (where they prepare and furnyshe them selues whiche make any voyage into these landes) about the Ides of October, in the yeere .1510. and landed the .ix. of Nouember in a region in the large prouince of <HI>Paria,</HI> founde by <HI>Colonus</HI> betwene the hauen <HI>Carthago,</HI> and the region of <HI>Cuchibachoa.</HI> In this voyage, what by the roughnesse of the sea, and fiercenesse of the barbarians, he suffered many in∣commodities: for when his freshe water fayled, he sayled to the mouth of a certayne riuer which thinhabitantes cal <HI>Gaira,</HI> beyng apt to receiue shippes. This riuer had his course from the toppe of an exceedyng hygh mountayne couered with snowe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An exceedyng high moun∣tayne couered with snowe.</NOTE> hygher then the whiche, al the companions of this captayne <HI>Rodericus</HI> say, that they neuer sawe: And that by good reason, yf it were couered with snowe in that region, which is not past ten degrees distant from the <HI>Equinoctial</HI> lyne. As they began to draw water out of theyr shyp boate, a certayne kyng made towarde them, ap∣parelled with vestures of gossampine cotton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apparelled men.</NOTE> hauyng twentie noble men in his company apparelled also: which thyng seemed straunge to our men, and not seene before in those parties. The kynges apparell hong loose from his shoulders to his elbowes, and from the gyrdle downewarde, it was much lyke a womans kyrtle, reaching euen to his heeles. As he drewe neere towarde our men, he seemed freendly to admonyshe them to take none of the water of that ryuer, affyrmyng it to be vnwholsome for men, and shewed them that not farre from thence, there was a ryuer, of good water. They came to the ryuer, and endeuouryng to come neere the shore, they were driuen backe by tempest. Also the burbuling of the sand, declared the sea to be but shalow there. They were therefore enforced to returne to the fyrste ryuer where they myght safely cast anker. This kyng layde wayte for our men: for as they were fyllyng theyr barrelles, he set on them with about seuen hundred men (as our men iud∣ged) armed after theyr manner, although they were naked:
<PB N="67" REF="77"/>
for only the kyng and his noble men were apparelled. They tooke away the shypboate, and broke it in manner to chips: so fiercely assaylyng our men with theyr venemous arrowes, that they slue of them fourtie and seuen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spanyardes slayne with ve∣nemous ar∣rowes.</NOTE> before they coulde couer them selues with their targets. For that poyson is of such force, that albeit the woundes were not great, yet they dyed therof im∣mediatly, for they yet knewe no remedie agaynst this kynde of poyson, as they after learned of the inhabitauntes of <HI>Hispaniola:</HI> for this Ilande bryngeth foorth an hearbe which quencheth and mortifieth the violent poyson of the hearbe, wherwith theyr ar∣rowes are infected, so that it be ministred in tyme.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remedie a∣gaynst vene∣mous arrowes</NOTE> Yet of our companye whiche went for water, seuen escaped that conflycte, and hydde them selues in a hollowe tree, lurkyng there vntyll nyght, yet escaped they not the handes of theyr enimies: for the shyppe departed from thence in the nyght season, and left them there, supposyng that they had ben slayne. Thus by manye suche peryls and daungers (which I lyghtly ouerpasse, because I wyll not be tedious to your holynesse) he aryued at the length at the hauen of <HI>Vraba,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The hauen of Vraba.</NOTE> and cast anker at the East syde thereof, from whence not long before, our men departed to the West syde, by reason of the barrennesse of that soyle. When he had continued a whyle in the hauen, and sawe no man styrryng, marueyled at the scilence of the places (for he supposed there to haue found his felowes) he could not coniecture what this should meane: and thereupon began to suspect that eyther they were dead, or that they had changed the place of theyr habitation. To knowe the certayntie hereof, he commaunded all the great ordi∣naunce, and other small gunnes whiche he had in his shyppes, to be charged, and fyers to be made in the night vpon the toppes of the rockes. Thus the fyers beyng kyndled, he commaunded al the gunnes to be shot of at one instant, by the horrible noyse whereof, the gulfe of <HI>Vraba</HI> was shaken, although it were .xxiiii. myles distant, for so brode is the gulfe. This noyse was hearde of theyr felowes in <HI>Dariena,</HI> and they aunsweared them agayne with mutual fyers. Wherefore, by the folowyng of these fyers, <HI>Colmenaris</HI> brought his shippes to the West syde.

who enterteyned them very frendly. They had nowe ben there eighteene monethes, and were therefore as vtterly naked as the people of the countrey.

Thus entryng into the vyllage whiche they had chosen to inhabite, they had knowledge that <HI>Valdiuia</HI> was returned within sixe monethes after his de∣parture, but with no great plentie of vyttualles, because he brought but a smal shyppe: yet with hope that shortly after, there shoulde be sent them abundance of vyttualles, and a newe supplye of men.

Wherefore, within a fewe dayes after <HI>Valdiuia</HI> his returne, they fel agayne into lyke scarcenesse: especially foras∣muche as a great storme and tempest whiche came from the hygh mountaynes, with horrible thunder and lyghtnyng in the moneth of Nouember,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horrible thun∣der and lyght∣nyng in the moneth of Nouember.</NOTE> brought with it suche a floodde, that it partly caryed away, and partly drowned al the corne and seedes which they had sowen in the moneth of September, in a fruite∣full grounde before they went to kyng <HI>Comogrus.</HI> The seedes whiche they of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> call <HI>Maizium,</HI> and they of <HI>Vraba</HI> call <HI>Hobba,</HI> whereof they make theyr bread, whiche also we sayde to be rype thryse euery yeere, because those regions are not bytten with the sharpenesse of wynter by reason of theyr neerenesse to the Equinoctial lyne. It is also agreeable to the principles of natural philosophie, that this bread made of <HI>Maizius</HI> or <HI>Hobba,</HI> shoulde be more wholsome for the inhabitauntes of those coun∣treys then bread made of wheate, by reason that it is of easier digestion: for whereas colde is wantyng, the natural heate is not dryuen from the outwarde partes into the inwarde partes and precordials, whereby digestion is muche strengthened. Beyng therefore thus frustrate of the increase of theyr seedes, and the kynges neere about them, spoyled of both vyttualles

The same <HI>Valdiuia</HI> was also sent on this message, cary∣ing with hym to the kynges treasurers (hauing theyr office of receipt in <HI>Hispaniola</HI>) three hundred poundes weyght of golde, after eyght ounces to the pounde, for the fyft portion due to the kynges excheker. This pound of eight ounces, the Spaniardes call <HI>Marcha,</HI> whiche in weight amounteth to fyftye peeces of golde called <HI>Castellani,</HI> but the Castilians call a pounde <HI>Pesum.</HI> We conclude therefore, that the summe hereof, was .xv. thou∣sand of those peeces of gold called <HI>Castellani.</HI> And thus is it appa∣rent by this accompt, that they receiued of the barbarous kinges, a thousande and fyue hundred poundes, of eyght ounces to the pounde: all the whiche they founde readye wrought in sundrye kyndes of ouches, as cheynes, braselets, tablets, and plates, both to hang before theyr brestes, and also at theyr eares, and nosethryls. <HI>Valdiuia</HI> therfore tooke shypping in the same Cara∣uell in the which he came last, and returned also before the thyrde day of the Ides of Ianuary, in the yeere of Christe M.D.XI.

But let vs now returne to them whiche remayned in <HI>Vraba.</HI> After the dismissyng of <HI>Valdiuia,</HI> beyng pricked for∣warde with outragious hunger, they determined to searche the inner partes of that gulfe in sundry places.

so falleth into the same. Saylyng along by the ryuer about the space of thyrtie myles (for they cal it niene leagues) and some∣what enclynyng towarde the ryght hande Southwarde, they founde certayne vyllages of thinhabitauntes, the kyng whereof was called <HI>Dabaiba.</HI> Our men also were certified before, that <HI>Cemacchus</HI> the kyng of <HI>Dariena,</HI> whom they put to flyght in the battayle, fledde to this <HI>Dabaiba,</HI> but at the commyng of our men, <HI>Dabaiba</HI> also fledde. It is thought that he was admonyshed by <HI>Cemacchus,</HI> that he shoulde not abyde the brunte of our men. He folowed his counsayle, forsooke his villages, and left all thynges desolate: yet our men founde heapes of bowes and arrowes, al∣so muche housholde stuffe, and many fyshyng boates. But those maryshe groundes were neyther apt for sowyng of seedes, or plantyng of trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maryshe grounde.</NOTE> by reason whereof, they founde there fewe suche thynges as they desyred, that is, plentie of vyttualles: for the inhabitauntes of this region haue no bread, but such as they geat in other countreys neare about them by exchange for their fyshe, onlye to serue theyr owne necessitie: yet founde they in the houses of those whiche fledde, golde wrought and grauen, a∣mountyng to the summe of seuen thousande of those peeces, whi∣che we sayde to be called <HI>Castellani:</HI> also certaine Canoas, of the whiche they brought away two with them, and great plentie of theyr houshold stuffe, with certaine bundels of bowes &amp; arrowes. They say, that from the maryshes of that riuer, there come cer∣tayne battes in the nyght season, as bygge as turtle doues, inua∣dyng men, and bytyng them with a deadly wounde, as some of them testifie whiche haue ben bytten of the same.

Other say, that the byting of some of them is venemous: yet that the same is healed incontinently, yf it be washed with water of the sea. <HI>Ancisus</HI> tolde me also, that the venemous woundes made by the Canibales arrowes infected with poyson, are hea∣led by washing with water of the sea, and also by cauterisyng

with whot irons, and that he had experience thereof in the regi∣on of <HI>Caribana,</HI> where many of his men were so wounded. They departed therefore from the poynt of the gulfe of <HI>Vraba,</HI> not wel contented, because they were not saden with victualles. In this theyr returne, there arose so great a tempest in that wyde gulfe, that they were enforced to cast into the sea al the houshold stuffe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A tempest.</NOTE> whiche they tooke from the poore wretches whiche liued only by fyshyng.

Theyr weapons are swoords of wood, &amp; long staues lyke iauelins, hardened at the ende with fyre: but they vse neyther bowes nor arrowes, nor any other of the inhabitauntes of the West syde of the gulfe.

certaine of his noble men. A common souldier of ours, whom the kyng had wounded, commyng to hym when he was taken, cut of his arme at one stroke with his swoorde: but this was done vnawares to the captaynes. The number of the Christian men whiche were here, was about an hundred and fyftie: the one halfe whereof the captaynes left here, and they with the resi∣due rowed vp the riuer agayne, with twelue of the boates of those regions, whiche they cal <HI>Vru,</HI> as they of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> cal them <HI>Ca∣noas</HI> as we haue sayde. From the ryuer of <HI>Riuus Niger,</HI> and the Ilande of <HI>Cannafistula,</HI> for the space of threescore and ten myles, leauyng both on the right hande and on the left, many riuers fal∣ling into it bygger then it selfe, they entred into one, by the con∣ductyng of one of the naked inhabitauntes, beyng appoynted a guyde for that purpose. Uppon the banke of this ryuer next vnto the mouth of the same, there was a kyng called <HI>Abibeiba,</HI> who because the region was ful of maryshes, had his pallace buylded in the toppe of a hygh tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King Abibeiba dwelleth in a tree.</NOTE> a new kind of buildyng, and seldome seene: but that lande bryngeth forth trees of such excee∣ding height, that among theyr branches a man may frame large houses: as we reade the lyke in diuers auctours, howe in many regions where the Ocean sea riseth and ouerfloweth the lande, the people were accustomed to flee to the hygh trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rysyng of the Ocean sea.</NOTE> and after the fall of the water, to take the fyshe left on the lande. This ma∣ner of buyldyng, is to lay beames crosse ouer the branches of the trees, fast bounde togeather, and thereupon to rayse theyr frame, strongly made agaynst wynde and weather. Our men suppose that they builde theyr houses in trees, by reason of the great floods and ouerflowyng of riuers, whiche oftentymes chaunce in those regions. These trees are of suche heyght, that the strength of no mans arme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees of mar∣ueilous height.</NOTE> is able to hurle a stone to the houses buylded therein.

suche bignes, that seuen men, yea sometimes eight, holdyng hande in hande with theyr armes stretched foorth, were scarsely able to fathame them about: yet haue they theyr cellers in the grounde, well replenyshed with such wynes wherof we haue spoken before. For albeit that the vehemencie of the winde is not of power to cast downe those houses, or to breake the bran∣ches of the trees, yet are they tossed therewith, and swaye som∣what from syde to syde, by reason whereof, the wyne shoulde be muche troubled with moouing. All other necessarye thinges, they haue with them in the trees. When the kyng or any other of the noble men, dyne or suppe in these trees, theyr wyues are brought them from the cellers by theyr seruauntes, whiche by meanes of exercise, are accustomed with no lesse celerytie to runne vp and downe the staires adherente to the tree, then doo our wayting boyes vppon the playne grounde fetche vs what wee call for from the cobbarde besyde our dyning table.

But he denyed that he woulde come out of his house, desy∣ring them to suffer hym to lyue after his fashion: but our men fell from fayre woordes to threatning, that except he woulde des∣cende with all his familie, they woulde eyther ouerthrowe the tree, or elles set it on fyre.

<HI>Iohannes Fonseca</HI> (to whom at the beginnyng the charge of these affayres was committed, whom also for his faythfull seruice to∣warde the kyng,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The procura∣tours of Da∣riena are ho∣nourably re∣ceiued at the court.</NOTE> your holynesse created general Commissarie in the warres agaynst the Moores) receiued them honourably, as men commyng from the newe worlde, from naked nations, and landes vnknowen to other men. By the preferment therefore of the Byshop of <HI>Burges, Quicedus</HI> and <HI>Colmenaris</HI> were brought before the kyng, and declared theyr legacie in his presence. Suche newes and presentes as they brought, were dilectable to the kyng and his noble men, for the newnesse and strangenesse thereof. They also soiourned with me oftentymes. Theyr coun∣tenaunces do declare the intemperatnesse of the ayre and region of <HI>Dariena,</HI> for they are yelowe, lyke vnto them that haue the ye∣lowe gaundies, and also swolne: but they ascribe the cause here∣of, to the hunger whiche they susteyned in tymes past.

But let vs nowe declare what folowed after the commyng of the procuratours of <HI>Dariena.</HI> Therfore, before theyr arryual, there was a rumor spred in the court, that the cheefe gouernours and Lieuetenantes <HI>Ni∣cuesa</HI> and <HI>Fogeda,</HI> also <HI>Iohannes de la Cossa</HI> (a man of such reputa∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great ma∣ster of the kings ships.</NOTE> that by the kinges letters patentes he was named the great maister of the kyngs shyppes) were al peryshed by mischaunce: and that those fewe whiche yet remayned alyue in <HI>Dariena,</HI> were at contention and discorde among them selues, so that they nei∣ther endeuoured theyr diligence to allure those symple na∣tions to our fayth, nor yet had regarde to searche the natures of those regions.

<PB REF="93"/>
to sende a newe captayne thyther, which should restore and set al thynges in good order, and put them out of aucthoritie whiche had vsurped the Empire of those prouinces without the kynges speciall commaundement.

Wherfore, to declare my opinion, vn∣der your graces fauour (whom it hath pleased to appoynt me a Commissioner in these affayres) I thynke it were vngodly that he shoulde be put from his office at the suite of any other, especi∣ally beyng thereto mooued by ambition and couetousnesse, who perchaunce would prooue them selues to be the same men in the office, if they should obteyne it, as they now shew them selues in the ambitious desyryng of the same.

more ample manner then before, wyllyng the byshop to appoynt hym a thousande and two hundred souldiers at his charges, ma∣kyng hym a warrant to the officers of his Exchequer, to delyuer hym money in prest for the same purpose. <HI>Petrus Arias</HI> therfore beyng thus put in office, and aucthorised by the kinges letters patentes vnder his brode seale, chose a great number of his souldiers in the court, and so departed from <HI>Valladoleto,</HI> about the Calends of October, in the yere .1513. and sayled first to Ciuile, beyng a very ryche citie, and wel replenished with people, where by the kynges magistrates, he was furnyshed with men and vyt∣tualles, and other necessaries parteynyng to so great a matter: for the kyng hath in this citie erected a house, seruyng only for the affayres of the Ocean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A house in Ci∣uile appoynted to the affayres of India.</NOTE> to the whiche al they that goe or come from the newe landes and Ilandes, resorte to geue accomptes, aswel what they cary thyther, as what they bryng from thence, that the kyng may be truely answered of his custome of the fyft part, both of golde and other thynges, as we haue sayde before.

But lest the ships shoulde be pestered with to great a multitude, or lest vittuals shoulde fayle them, the libertie of free passage was restraynt. It was also decreed that no stranger myght passe without the kynges licence. Wherefore I doo not a lytle mar∣uayle at <HI>Aloisius Cadamustus</HI> a Uenetian, and wryter of the Por∣tugales voyages, that he was not ashamed to wryte thus of the Spanyardes nauigations: we went, we sawe, we dyd: whereas he neuer went, nor any Uenetian sawe, but he stole certayne an∣notations out the three first bookes of my fyrst Decade, wryt∣ten to Cardinal <HI>Ascanius</HI> &amp; <HI>Arcimboldus,</HI> supposyng that I would neuer haue publyshed the same.

Portugales inuaded the kingdome of Castile, by reason wherof, they were encouraged fyrst to resyst, and then with open warre to assayle and expulse the Portugales, for the great treasure whi∣che kyng Henry brother to queene Helisabeth had geathered to∣geather there. This marquesse, while she liued, did euer shewe a manly and stoute mynde, both in peace and warre, so that by her counsayle, many noble thinges were brought to good effecte in Castile: vnto this noble woman the wyfe of <HI>Petrus Arias</HI> was niese by her brothers syde. She, folowyng the magnanimitie of her aunt, perceiuyng her husband nowe furnyshyng hym selfe to depart to the vnknowen coastes of the newe worlde, and those large tractes of lande and sea, spake these wordes vnto hym: My most deare and welbeloued husbande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wyfe of Petrus Arias.</NOTE> we ought not nowe to for∣geat that from our young yeeres we haue ben ioyned togeather with the yoke of holy matrimonie, to thintent that we shoulde so lyue togeather, and not asunder, duryng the tyme of our natural lyfe: wherefore for my part, to declare my affection herein, you shal vnderstande, that whither soeuer your fatall destenie shall dryue you, eyther by the furious waues of the great Ocean, or by the manyfolde and horrible daungers of the lande, I wyl sure∣ly beare you company: there can no peryll chaunce to me so terrible, nor any kynde of death so cruell, that shal not be muche easyer for me to abyde, then to liue so farre separate from you. It were muche better for me to dye, and eyther to be cast into the sea, to be deuoured of the fyshes, or on the lande to the Ca∣nibales, then with continual mournyng and bewaylyng, to liue in death, and dye lyuyng, whyle I consume in lookyng rather for my husbandes letters, then for hym selfe. This is my ful de∣termination, not rashly, nor presently excogitate, nor concei∣ued by the lyght phantasie of womans brayne, but with long deliberation and good aduisement. Nowe therefore choose to whether of these two you wyll assent, eyther to thruste your swoorde in my throte, or to graunt me my request. As for the children which god hath geuen vs as pledges of our inseparable loue (for they had foure sonnes, and as many daughters) shall not stay me a moment: let vs leaue vnto them such goodes and possessions as haue ben left vs by our parentes and freendes, whereby they may lyue among the woorshypfull of theyr order:

for other thynges I take no care. When this noble matrone of manly vertue had finished these woordes, her husbande seeyng the constant mynde of his wyfe, and her in a redynesse to do ac∣cordyng to her woordes, had no hart to denye her louyng petiti∣on, but embracing her in his armes, commended her intent, and consented to her request. She folowed hym therfore, as did <HI>Ipsicratea</HI> her <HI>Mithridates,</HI> with her heare hangyng loose about her shoulders: for she loued her husband, as dyd <HI>Halicarnassea</HI> of <HI>Caria</HI> hers, being dead, and as dyd <HI>Artemisia</HI> her <HI>Mausolus.</HI> We haue also had aduertisment since theyr departure, that she (beyng brought vp as it were amōg soft fethers) hath with no lesse stoute courage susteyned the roringes and rages of the Ocean, then dyd eyther her husbande, or any of the Maryners brought vp euen a∣mong the sourges of the sea. But to haue sayde thus muche here∣of, this shall suffise: let vs nowe speake of other thynges no lesse worthy memorie. Therfore, wheras in the first Decade we haue made mention of <HI>Vincentius Annez Pinzonus,</HI> ye shal vnderstand▪ that he accōpanied <HI>Christophorus Colonus</HI> the Admiral in his first voyage, and afterwarde made an other voyage of his owne char∣ges with only one shyppe. Agayne, the fyrst yeere after the de∣partyng of the Captaynes <HI>Nicuesa</HI> and <HI>Fogeda,</HI> he ran ouer those coastes from <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and searched al the South syde of <HI>Cuba,</HI> from the East to the West, and sayled rounde about that Iland, whiche to that day, for the great length thereof, was thought to haue ben part of the continent or firme land, although some other say that they dyd the lyke. <HI>Vincentius Annez</HI> therefore, knowyng nowe by experience that <HI>Cuba</HI> was an Ilande, sayled on further, and found other landes Westwarde from <HI>Cuba,</HI> but suche as the Admiral had first touched. Wherfore, beyng in manner encom∣passed with this newe lande, turning his course towarde the left hande, and rasing the coastes of that lande by the East, ouerpas∣sing also the mouthes of the gulfes of <HI>Beragua, Vraba,</HI> and <HI>Cuchi∣bachoa,</HI> he arryued at the region whiche in the first Decade we called <HI>Paria</HI> and <HI>Os Draconis,</HI> and entred into the great gulfe of freshe water, which <HI>Colonus</HI> discouered, beyng replenyshed with great abundance of fyshe, and famous by reason of the multitude of Ilandes lying in the same, beyng distant Eastwarde from <HI>Curiana</HI> about an hundred and thirtie myles, in the which tracte,

are the regions of <HI>Cumana</HI> and <HI>Manacapana,</HI> whiche also in the sixt booke of the fyrst Decade we sayd to be regions of the large prouince of <HI>Paria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plentie of pearles.</NOTE> where many affyrme to be the greatest plentie of the best pearles, and not in <HI>Curiana.</HI> The kynges of these re∣gions (whom they cal <HI>Chiacones,</HI> as they of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> cal them <HI>Cacici</HI>) beyng certified of the comming of our men, sent certayne spyes to enquire what new nation was arryued in theyr coastes, what they brought, and what they would haue, and in the meane tyme furnyshed a number of theyr <HI>Canoas</HI> (whiche they call <HI>Chi∣chos</HI>) with men armed after theyr manner: for they were not a lytle astonyshed to beholde our shippes with the sayles spread, whereas they vse no sayles, nor can vse but small ones yf they woulde, by reason of the narownesse of theyr Canoas. Swar∣myng therefore about the shyppe with theyr Canoas (whiche we may wel cal <HI>Monoxyla,</HI> because they are made of one whole tree) they feared not to shoote at our men, beyng yet within their shyppes, and keepyng them selues vnder the hatches, as safely as yf they had ben defended with stone walles.

With the golde and Frankencense whiche they presented to our men, they gaue them also a great multitude of theyr peacockes, both cockes and hennes, dead and alyue, as∣wel to satisfie theyr present necessitie, as also to carry with them into Spayne for encrease, lykewyse certayne carpettes, couer∣lettes, table clothes, and hangyngs, made of Gossampine silke, finely wrought after a strange deuice, with pleasant and variable colours, hauyng golden belles, and such other spangles and pen∣dauntes, as the Italians call <HI>Sonaglios,</HI> and the Spanyardes <HI>Cascaueles,</HI> hangyng at the purfles therof. They gaue them fur∣thermore speakyng popyngayes of sundry colours, as many as they woulde aske: for in <HI>Paria</HI> there is no lesse plentie of popyn∣gayes, then with vs of doues or sparows. Thinhabitants of these regions, both men &amp; women, are apparelled with vestures made of gossampine cotton, the men to the knees, and the women to the calfe of the legge. The fashion of theyr apparel is simple and playne, muche lyke vnto the Turkes: but the mens is double, and quilted, like that which the Turkes vse in the warres.

The Portugales, because they were the fyrst that durst attempt to searche the Ocean sea synce the memorie of man, affirmed that al the nauigations of the Ocean, ought to parteyne to them on∣ly. The Castilians argued on the contrary part, that whatsoeuer God by the ministration of nature hath created on the earth, was at the begynnyng common among men, and that it is therefore lawful to euery man to possesse such lands as are voyde of Chri∣stian inhabitours. Whyle the matter was thus vncertaynelye debated, both parties agreed that the controuersie shoulde be de∣syded by the byshop of Rome, and plighted fayth to stande to his arbitrement. The kyngdome of Castile was at that tyme gouerned by that great queene <HI>Helisabeth</HI> with her husband: for the Realme of Castile was her dowrie. She also and the kyng of Portugale, were cosyn germanes of two systers, by reason whereof, the dissention was more easyly pacified. By the assent therfore of both parties, Alexander the bishop of Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bishop of Rome diuideth the lande.</NOTE> the .vi. of that name, by thaucthoritie of his leaden bull, drewe a right lyne from the North to the South, an hundred leagues Westwarde,

Of certayne captiues whi∣che he tooke in the gulfe of <HI>Paria</HI> (whiche certaynely parteyneth to the dominion of Castile) he brought some with him to <HI>Hispa∣niola,</HI> and left them with the young Admirall to learne our lan∣guage: but he hym selfe repayred to the court, to make earnest suite to the kyng, that by his fauour he myght be gouernour of the Iland of <HI>Sancti Iohannis</HI> (otherwise called <HI>Burichena,</HI> being di∣stant from <HI>Hispaniola</HI> only .xxv. leagues) because he was the fyrst finder of golde in that Ilande.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ilande of S.

this abominable slaughter of our men, they came agayne from theyr owne Ilande of <HI>Sancta crux</HI> (otherwise called <HI>Ay Ay</HI>) to the Ilande of <HI>Sancti Iohannis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Canibales of the Iland of Sancta Crux.</NOTE> and slue a kyng whiche was a freende to our men, and ate hym, and al his family, vtterly subuertyng his village, vpon this occasion, that violating the law of hostage, he had slayne seuen Canibales whiche were left with hym by composition to make certayne Canoas, because the Ilande of <HI>Sancti Iohannis</HI> beareth greater trees, and apter for that purpose, then doth the Iland of <HI>Sancti crux,</HI> the cheefe habitatiō of the Ca∣nibales.

The thyng beyng vnderstoode by the interpretours, our men quarel∣ling with them, and calling them to accompt for that mischeuous deede, they immediatly directed theyr bowes and venemous ar∣rowes against them, and with cruell countenances threatned them to be quiet, lest it shoulde repent them of theyr commyng thyther. Our men fearyng theyr venemous arrowes (for they were not prepared to fyght) gaue them signes of peace. Beyng demaunded why they destroyed the vyllage, and where the king was with his familie, they answered, that they rased the vyllage, and cut the kyng with his familie in peeces, and ate them in the reuenge of theyr seuen woorkmen: and that they had made fag∣gottes of theyr bones, to cary them to the wiues and children of theyr slayne woorkemen, in wytnesse that the bodyes of theyr husbandes and parentes lay not vnreuenged, and therewith shewed the faggottes of bones to our men, who beyng astony∣shed at theyr fiercenesse and crueltie, were enforced to dissemble the matter, and holde theyr peace, quarellyng no further with them at that tyme.

They nouryshe a tree whiche they call <HI>Guaiana,</HI> that beareth a fruite muche resemblyng the kinde of Citrones which are commonly called Limones, of taste somwhat sharpe, myxt with sweetenes. They haue also abundance of nuts of pinetrees, and great plentie of Date trees, which beare fruites bigger then the Dates that are knowen to vs, but they are not apt to be eaten for theyr to much sowrenesse.

These growe so abundantly in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> that the hogges are fedde with the fruite therof, as with mast among vs. The hogges like this kynde of feedyng so wel, that when these fruites waxe ripe, the swineheards can by no meanes keepe them out of the woods of these trees, by reason whereof, a great multitude of them are become wilde.

The most puissant prince <HI>Ferdinandus,</HI> declared that he had eaten of another fruite brought from those landes, being full of scales, with keyes, much lyke a pineapple in fourme and colour, but in tendernes equal to melow pepons, and in taste exceedyng al garden fruites: for it is no tree, but an hearbe, much like vnto an archichoke, or <HI>Acantho</HI>: The king him selfe gaue the cheefest commendation to this. I haue eaten none of these fruits: for of a great number which they brought from thence, only one remay∣ned vncorrupted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruites putri∣fied on the sea.</NOTE> the other being putrified by reason of the long voyage. Al suche as haue eaten of them newly geathered in their natiue soyle, do marueylously commende theyr sweetenesse and pleasaunt taste.

Howsoeuer they be dressed, eyther fryed or sodde, they geue place to no suche kynde of meate in pleasant tendernes. The skinne is somwhat tougher then eyther the nauies or mushromes, and of earthy colour, but the inner meate therof is very white: These are nourished in gardens, as we sayd of <HI>Iucca</HI> in the first Decade. They are also eaten rawe,
<PB REF="99"/>
and haue the taste of rawe chestnuts, but are somewhat sweeter. We haue spoken sufficiently of trees, hearbes, and fruites, we wyl nowe therefore entreate of thynges sencitiue. The landes and desolate pastures of these regions, are inhabited and deuou∣red of wylde and terrible beastes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lions and Tygers.</NOTE> as Lions, Tygers, and suche other monsters as we nowe knowe, and haue ben described of olde auctours in tyme past.

Of the beast which beareth her whelpes about with her in her second belly as in a purse (beyng knowen to none of the olde wryters) I haue spoken in the fyrst Decade, which I doubt not to haue come to the handes of your holynesse. Let vs nowe therefore declare what resteth of the flooddes and ryuers of <HI>Vraba.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ryuers of Vraba.</NOTE> The riuer of <HI>Dariena</HI> falleth into the gulfe of <HI>Vraba,</HI> with a narow chanel, scarcely able to beare the Canoas or Ligh∣ters of that prouince, and runneth by the village where they chose theyr dwellyng place, but the ryuer in the corner of the gulfe whiche we sayde that <HI>Vaschus</HI> passed by, they founde to be .xxiiii. furlonges in breadth (which they call a league) and of exceedyng deapth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A league is xxiiii. fur∣longes.</NOTE> as of two hundred cubits, fallyng into the gulfe by diuers mouthes.

What I may there∣fore geather out of the wrytynges of so many learned aucthours as concernyng the riuer of <HI>Nilus,</HI> I knowe not: for they say that nature hath geuen two ryuers of that name to water the lande, whether they wyl them to spryng out of the mountaynes of the
<PB N="89" REF="99"/>
moone or the sunne, or out of the tops of the rough mountaines of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> affyrmyng one of the same to fall into the gulfe of E∣gypt toward the North, and the other into the south Ocean sea. What shal we say in this place? Of that <HI>Nilus</HI> in Egypt there is no doubt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Portuga∣les nauigati∣ons.</NOTE> The Portugales also which sayle by the coastes of the Ethiopians called <HI>Nigritae,</HI> and by the kyngdome of <HI>Melin∣da,</HI> passyng vnder y<SUP>e</SUP> Equinoctial lyne, among theyr marueylous inuentions haue found another toward the South, and earnestly affirme the same to be also deriued from the mountaynes of the moone, and that it is another chanel of <HI>Nilus,</HI> because it bringeth forth Crocodiles, whereas it hath not ben read before time, that any other riuer nourished Crocodiles sauing only <HI>Nilus.</HI> This riuer the Portugales cal <HI>Senega.</HI> It runneth through the region of the <HI>Nigritas,</HI> beyng very fruiteful toward the North shore, but on the South syde sandie and rough. Crocodiles are also engen∣dred herein. What shal we then say of this thirde? yea I may wel say the fourth: for I suppose them also to be Crocodiles, whi∣che <HI>Colonus</HI> with his company found, armed with scales as hard as shelles, in the ryuer called <HI>Delagartos,</HI> wherof we haue made mention before. Shal we say that these ryuers of <HI>Dariena</HI> also and <HI>Vraba,</HI> haue theyr original from the mountaynes of the moone, wheras they spryng out of the next mountaynes, and can by no meanes haue the same original with <HI>Nilus</HI> in Egypt, or that in <HI>Nigrita,</HI> or els that in the kyngdome of <HI>Melinda,</HI> from whence so euer they are deryued, whereas these other (as we haue sayde) spring out of the next mountaynes, which diuide another South sea, with no great distance from the North Ocean. Wherefore, it appeareth by experience of such as haue trauailed the world in our tyme, that other waters besyde the riuer of <HI>Nilus</HI> in Egypt, may lykewyse bryng foorth Crocodiles. In the Maryshes also and fennes of the regions of <HI>Dariena,</HI> are founde great plen∣tie of Phesantes and Peacockes (but not of variable colours) with manye other kyndes of byrdes and foules vnlyke vnto ours, aswel apt to be eaten, as also to delyte the eares of men with pleasaunt noyse. But our Spanyardes, because they are ignoraunt in fowlyng, take but fewe. Also innumerable po∣pingayes of sundry kyndes are founde chattering in the groues of those fennie places. Of these there are some equall to Ca∣pons
<PB REF="100"/>
in bygnesse, and some as lytle as sparowes. But of the di∣uersitie of popyngayes, we haue spoken sufficiently in the fyrste Decade: for in the rase of this large lande, <HI>Colonus</HI> hym selfe brought and sent to the courte a great number of euery kynde, the whiche it was lawfull for all the people to beholde, and are yet dayly brought in like manner. There remayneth yet one thyng moste woorthy to be put in hystorie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A philosophi∣cal discourse as concerning thoriginal of springes and ryuers.</NOTE> the whiche, I had ra∣ther to haue chaunced into the handes of <HI>Cicero</HI> or <HI>Liuie,</HI> then in∣to myne: for the thyng is so marueylous in my estimation, that I fynde my wytte more entangled in the discription hereof, then is sayde of the henne when she seeth her young chycken inwrap∣ped in towe or flaxe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The breadth of the lande at Vraba, from the North O∣cean to the South sea.</NOTE> The breadth of that lande from the North Ocean to the south sea, is only sixe dayes iourney, by relation of the inhabitauntes. The multitude therfore and greatnesse of the riuers on the one syde, and on the other syde the narownesse of the lande, bryng me into suche doubt howe it can come to passe, that in so lytle a space of three dayes iourney, measuryng from the high toppes of those mountaynes, I doo not vnderstande howe so many and so great ryuers may haue recourse vnto this North sea: for it is to be thought, that as many do flow toward thinhabitants of the south. These riuers of <HI>Vraba</HI> are but small, in comparison of many other in those coastes: for the Spany∣ardes say, that in the tyme of <HI>Colonus,</HI> they found and passed by an other riuer after this, whose gulfe fallyng into y<SUP>e</SUP> sea, they affirme to be litle lesse then a hundred myles in the fyrst coastes of <HI>Paria,</HI> as we haue sayde elsewhere: for they say, that it falleth from the toppes of high mountaynes with so swyft and furious a course, that by the violence and greatnesse thereof, it dryueth backe the sea, although it be rough &amp; enforced with a contrary wynd. They al affirme lykewyse, that in al the large tracte therof, they felt no sowre or salt water, but that all the water was freeshe, sweete, and apt to be drunke. Thinhabitauntes call this ryuer <HI>Marag∣nonum,</HI> and the regions adiacent to the same, <HI>Mariatambal, Ca∣mamorus,</HI> and <HI>Paricora:</HI> besyde those riuers whiche I haue na∣med before, as <HI>Darien▪ Grandis, Dabaiba, Beragua, Sancti Mathei, Boius gatti, Delagartos,</HI> &amp; <HI>Gaira,</HI> they which of late haue searched those coastes, haue founde many other. Deliberatyng there∣fore with me selfe, from whence these mountaynes, beyng so
<PB N="84" REF="100"/>
narowe and neare vnto the sea on both sydes, haue suche great holowe caues or dennes of such capacitie, and from whence they are fylled, to cast foorth suche abundance of water: hereof also as∣kyng them the opinions of the inhabitauntes, they affirme them to be of diuers iudgementes herein, alleaging fyrst the greatnes of the mountaynes to be the cause, whiche they say to be verye high, whiche thyng also <HI>Colonus</HI> the first fynder thereof affirmeth to be true, addyng thereunto that the paradise of pleasure is in the tops of those mountaynes whiche appeare from the gulfe of <HI>Paria</HI> &amp; <HI>Os Draconis,</HI> as he is fully perswaded. They agree there∣fore that there are great caues within these mountaynes, but it resteth to consyder from whence they are fylled. If therfore al the riuers of freshe waters, by the opinion of many, do so flowe out of the sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sea.</NOTE> as dryuen and compelled through the passages or pores of the earth, by the ponderous weyght of the sea it selfe, as we see them breake foorth of the sprynges, and directe theyr course to the sea agayne, then the thyng is lesse to be maruey∣led at here, then in other places: for we haue not read that in any other place, two suche seas haue enuironed any lande with so narowe lymyttes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lande en∣closed with two seas.</NOTE> for it hath on the ryght syde the great Oce∣an, where the sunne goeth downe on the left hande, and another on the other syde where the sunne ryseth, nothyng inferiour to the fyrste in greatnesse, for they suppose it to be myxte and ioyned as al one with the sea of East India. This lande therfore beyng burdened with so great a weyght on the one syde, &amp; on the other, (yf this opinion be of any value) is enforced to swalowe vp such deuoured waters, and agayne to cast foorth the same in open springes and streames. But yf we shall denye that the earth draweth humours of the sea, and agree that all fountaynes or sprynges are engendred of the conuersion or turnyng of ayre into water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conuersion of ayre into wa∣ter in the ca∣ues of moun∣taynes.</NOTE> distilling within the holow places of the mountaines (as the most part thinke) we wyll geue place rather to thauctho∣ritie of them whiche stycke to those reasons, then that our sense is satisfied of the ful trueth thereof. Yet do I not repugne, that in some caues of mountaynes, water is turned into ayre: for I mee selfe haue seene, howe in the caues of manye mountaynes in Spayne, in manner showres of rayne do fall continuallye, and that the water geathered by this meanes, doth sende foorth
<PB REF="101"/>
certayne riuers by the sydes of the mountaynes, wherewith all suche trees as are planted on the steepe or foote of the mountay∣nes, as vines, oliue trees, and suche other, are watered, and this especially in one place: as the right honorable Lodouike the Cardinal of Aragonie, most obsequious to your holynesse, and two other bishops of Italy, whereof the one is <HI>Siluius Pandonus,</HI> and the other an Archbishop (whose name and title I do not re∣member) can beare me witnesse: for when we were togeather at <HI>Granata,</HI> lately deliuered from the dominion of the Moores, and walked for our pastyme to certaine pleasant hilles (by the whiche there ranne a fayre ryuer)▪ while Cardinal Lodouike occupied hym selfe in shootyng at byrdes whiche were in the bushes neere vnto the ryuer, I &amp; thother two bishops determined to clime the mountaynes, to searche the original and spryng of the ryuer: for we were not farre from the toppes thereof. Folowyng therfore the course of the ryuer, we founde a great caue, in which was a continual fal of water, as it had ben a showre of rayne, the wa∣ter whereof, fallyng into a trenche made with mans hande, en∣creaseth to a ryuer, and runneth downe by the sydes of the moun∣taynes. The lyke is also seene in this famous towne of <HI>Vallado∣leto</HI> (where we nowe soiourne) in a certaine greene close, not past a furlong distant from the walles of the towne. I graunt there∣fore, that in certayne places, by conuersion of the ayrie deawe in∣to water, within the caues of suche mountaynes, many springes and riuers are engendred: but I suppose that nature was not sol∣licitate to bryng foorth suche great floods by this so small indu∣strie. Two reasons therfore do sounde best to my iudgement: wherof the one is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The often fal of rayne and con∣tinuall spryng tyme.</P>
<P>The Equinoc∣tiall.</P></NOTE> the often fal of rayne: the other, the continual autume or spryng tyme which is in those regions, being so neere vnto the Equinoctial, that the common people can perceiue no difference betweene the length of the day and the nyght through∣out all the yeere, where as these two seasons are more apt to en∣gender abundance of rayne, then eyther extreme wynter, or fer∣uent sommer. An other reason in effect much like vnto the fyrst, is this: If the sea be ful of pores, and that by the pores thereof, be∣ing opened by the south wyndes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pores of the sea, and the south wynde.</NOTE> we shal consent that vapours are lyfted vp, whereof the watery cloudes are engendred, this lande must needes be moysted with moe showres then anye o∣ther,
<PB N="91" REF="101"/>
yf it be as narowe as they say, and enuironed with two mayne seas collaterally beatyng on the same: howsoeuer it be, I can not but geue credite to the report of suche worthy men as haue recourse to those regions, and can no lesse then declare the same, albeit it may seeme incredible to some ignorant persons, not knowing the power of nature, to whom, Plinie was perswa∣ded, that nothing was impossible. We haue therefore thought it good to make this discourse by the way of argument, lest on the one syde, men of good learnyng and iudgement, and on the other syde, suche as are studious to finde occasions of quarel∣lyng in other mens wrytynges, shoulde iudge vs to be so vndis∣crete, lightly to geue credite to euery tale, not being consonant to reason: but of the force and great violence of those freshe wa∣ters, whiche repulsyng the sea, make so great a gulfe (as we haue sayde) I thynke the cause thereof to be the great multitude of floods and riuers, whiche beyng geathered togeather, make so great a poole, and not one ryuer, as they suppose. And foras∣much as the mountaines are exceeding high and steepe, I thinke the violence of the fall of the waters to be of suche force, that this conflict betweene the waters, is caused by thimpulsion of the poole, that the salt water can not enter into the gulfe. But here perhaps some wyll marueyle at me, why I should marueyle so muche hereat, speakyng vnto me scornefully, after this manner: Why doth he so marueyle at the great riuers of those regions? Hath not Italie his <HI>Eridanus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fludde Eridanus.</NOTE> named the kyng of ryuers of the old wryters? Haue not other regions also the lyke? as we reade of <HI>Tanais, Ganges,</HI> and <HI>Danubius,</HI> which are sayde so to ouercome the sea, that freshe water may be drawen fourtie myles within the same. These men I would satisfie with this aunswere. The famous ryuer of <HI>Padus</HI> in Italie (whiche they nowe call <HI>Po,</HI> and was of the Greekes called <HI>Eridanus</HI>) hath the great moun∣taynes called <HI>Alpes,</HI> diuiding Fraunce, Germanie, and Panno∣nie, from Italie, lying at the backe therof, as it were bulwarkes agger, full of moysture, and with a long tracte receiuyng <HI>Tici∣nam,</HI> with innumerable other great ryuers, falleth into the sea Adriatike.

as they also confesse whiche inhabite the Ilande of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and other Ilandes situate in the same. The Ilande therefore be∣ing nowe drye by the fall of the water, they resorted to theyr boates, which they founde al ouerwhelmed, &amp; ful of sande, and some sore bruised with great ryftes, and almost lost by reason theyr cables were broken: suche as were bruised, they tyed faste with theyr gyrdles, with slyppes of the barkes of trees, and with tough and long stalkes of certayne hearbes of the sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hard shyft in necessitie.</NOTE> stoppyng the ryftes or chynkes with grasse, according to the present neces∣sitie.

Of these thynges I was enfourmed of one <HI>Arbolantius,</HI> beyng one of <HI>Vaschus</HI> com∣panions, whom he sent to the kyng with many pearles, and cer∣tayne of those sea muscles.

Thus reioycing on both parties, they embrased, and made a league of continual frendshyp. <HI>Tumac∣cus</HI> thought hym selfe happie that he had presented our men with such thankefull gyftes, and was admitted to theyr frendshyp: and our men thinkyng them selues happie and blessed that they had founde such tokens of great ryches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The thyrst of golde.</NOTE> swalowed downe theyr spyttle for thyrst.

In the sea neere about this Ilande, sea muscles are engendred, of such quantitie, that many of them are as brode as bucklers.

Yet therefore raylyng further on hym with spytefull and approbrious woords, he swore great othes, that he woulde forthwith inuade the I∣lande, spoylyng, destroying, burnyng, drownyng, and hang∣yng, sparyng neyther swoorde nor fyre, vntyll he had re∣uenged theyr iniuries: and therewith commaunded his <HI>Culchas</HI> to be in a redynes.

And surely it seemeth vnto me vndecent, that we shoulde with silence ouerslyp so great a thyng, which aswel in the olde tyme, as in our dayes, hath and yet doth, drawe both men and women to the immoderate desire of superfluous plea∣sure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wanton and superfluous pleasures.</NOTE> Spayne therfore shalbe able hereafter with pearles to satisfie the greedy appetyte of such as in wanton pleasures are lyke vnto <HI>Cleopatra</HI> and <HI>Asopus</HI>: So that from hencefoorth we shall neyther enuie nor reuerence the nice fruitefulnesse of <HI>Stoi∣dum,</HI> or <HI>Taprobana,</HI> or the red sea.

concernyng the bygnesse of these sea muscles, they sent many of them into Spayne to the kyng, with the pearles, the fyshe beyng taken out: We thynke veryly that there may in no place bygger be founde.

selfe, but also promise his ayde, with all that he myght make: Protestyng furthermore, that he fledde not for feare that our men woulde doo them iniurie, but that he hyd hym selfe for verye shame and greefe of mynde, for that he was not able to receiue them honorablye, accordyng vnto theyr dignitie, be∣cause his store of vitayles was consumed. Yet in a token of obedience and frendeshyppe, he sent our men many vesselles of golde, desyring them to accepte them as the gifte of a frend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vessels of golde.</NOTE> whose good wyll wanted not in greater thynges, if his abilitie were greater. By whiche woordes, the poore man seemed to insinuate that he had ben robbed, and otherwyse cruelly handled of his borderers, by reason whereof, our men were enforced to depart from thence more hungerly then they came. As they went forwarde therefore, they espyed certayne naked men commyng downe from a hyll towarde them. <HI>Vaschus</HI> commaunded his armye to stay, and sent his interpretours to them, to knowe what they woulde haue.

He declared further, that a kyng whiche was their borderer and mortall enimie, was very ryche in golde, and that in subduyng of hym, they shoulde both obtayne great rychesse, and also delyuer them from dayly vex∣ations: whiche thyng myght easily be doone by their helpe, because they knewe the countrey. <HI>Vaschus</HI> put them in good comfort, and gaue them for rewarde certayne Iron axes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Axes of Iron more esteemed then any golde.</NOTE> whi∣che they more esteemed then great heapes of gold.

By rea∣son whereof, they take it for no shame to lacke cobordes of plate, whereas the pryde and wantonnesse of our tyme, doth in maner impute it to vs for ignominie, to be without that, whereof by nature we haue no neede. But theyr contentation with the benefites of nature, doth playnely declare, that men may leade a free and happye lyfe without tables, table clothes, carpets, napkyns, and towels, with such other innumerable, wherof they haue no vse, except perhaps the kynges furnysh theyr ta∣bles with a fewe golden vessels. But the common people driue away hunger with a peece of theyr bread in the one hand, and a peece of broyled fyshe, or some kynde of fruite in the other hand: for they eate flesh but seldome.

<PB N="107" REF="117"/>
many of <HI>Comogrus</HI> familiars had ben captyue, but our men now perceyued that they measured his power by theyr owne: For theyr kynges are but gnattes (compared to Elephantes) in res∣pect to the power &amp; policie of our men. Our men were also en∣fourmed by such as dwelt neare about <HI>Tumanama,</HI> that his regi∣on was not beyond the mountaynes as they supposed, nor yet so ryche in golde as young <HI>Comogrus</HI> had declared: Yet consul∣ted they of his subduing, whiche they thought they myght the easeliar bryng to passe, because <HI>Pocchorrosa</HI> was his mortal ene∣mie, who most gladly promised them his aduice and ayde here∣in. <HI>Vaschus</HI> therfore, leauyng his sicke men in the vyllage of <HI>Pocchorrosa,</HI> tooke with hym threescore of his most valyant soul∣diers, and declared vnto them, howe kyng <HI>Tumanama</HI> had often tymes spoken proude and threatnyng wordes agaynst them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A good po∣licie.</NOTE> Lykewyse that it nowe stood them in hand of necessitie to passe through his dominion, and that he thought it best to set vpon hym vnwares. The souldiers consented to his aduice, and exhorted hym to geue the aduenture, promising that they woulde folow hym, whyther soeuer he went. They determined therfore to goe two dayes iourney in one day, that <HI>Tumanama,</HI> not kno∣wyng of theyr sodayne commyng, myght haue no leysure to as∣semble an army: and the thyng came to passe euen as they had deuised. For in the first watche of the nyght, our men, with the <HI>Pocchorrosians,</HI> inuaded the village and pallace of <HI>Tumanama,</HI> where they tooke hym prysoner, suspectyng nothyng lesse. He had with hym two young men, whiche he abused vnnaturally, also fourescore women, whiche he had taken violently from di∣uers kynges: lykewyse, a great number of his gentlemen &amp; subiectes were taken straglyng in other vyllages neere about his pallace. For theyr houses are not adherent togeather as ours be, because they are oftentymes troubled with vehe∣ment whirlewyndes, by reason of the sodayne chaunges and mo∣tions of the ayer, caused by the influence of the planettes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of vehement windes neere the Equinoc∣ciall.</NOTE> in the equalitie of the day and nyght, beyng there in maner both of one length throughout all the yeere, forasmuch as they are neere vn∣to the Equinoctiall line, as we haue sayde before. Theyr hou∣ses are made of trees, couered, and after theyr maner thatched with the stalkes of certayne rough hearbes. To the pallace
<PB REF="118"/>
of <HI>Tumanama,</HI> was only one house adherent, and that euen as bygge as the pallace it selfe. Eyther of these houses were in length a hundred and twentye paces, and in breadth fiftie paces, as our men measured them. In these two houses the kyng was accustomed to muster his men, as often as he prepared an ar∣my. When <HI>Tumanama</HI> therfore was thus taken captiue, with all his Sardanapanicall familie, the <HI>Pocchorrosians</HI> bragged and threatened hym, beyng now bound, that he shoulde shortly be hanged: the other kynges also his borderers, reioyced at his mysfortune. Whereby our men parceyued that <HI>Tumanama</HI> was no lesse troublesome to his neyghbours, then was <HI>Pacra</HI> to the kynges of the south syde of the mountaynes. <HI>Vaschus</HI> also the better to please them, threatened hym greeuouslye, but in deede entended no euyll towards hym.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vaschus his Wordes to King Tuma∣nama.</NOTE> He spake therfore sharply vnto hym with these woords: Thou shalt now suffer punishment thou cruell tyrant, for thy pryde and abhominations.

he swore by the Sonne, that he euer loued and feared the Chri∣stians sence he fyrst hearde of theyr fame and victoryes: espe∣cyally when he harde say, that they had <HI>Michanas,</HI> that is, swor∣des sharper then theyrs, and suche as cutte in peeces all thinges that come in theyr wayes. Then directyng his eyes towarde <HI>Vaschus,</HI> who had his sworde in his hand, he spake thus, Who (except he were out of his witte) dare lyft vp his hande agaynst this sworde of yours, wherewith you are able with one strooke to cleaue a man from the head to the nauell? Let no man therfore perswade you (O most myghtye victourer) that euer such wordes proceeded out of my mouth. As <HI>Tumanama</HI> with tremblyng spake these wordes, therwith swalowyng downe the knot of death, <HI>Vaschus</HI> seemed by his teares to be moued to compassion, and speakyng to hym with chearfull countenance, commaunded hym to be loosed.

of <HI>Tumanama,</HI> where (as he sayth) he perceyued by the coloure of the earth, that it was lyke to bryng foorth golde. When they had dygged a pyt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The coloure of the golden earth, and a tri∣all of the same.</NOTE> not past a hand breadth and a halfe, and syfted the earth thereof, they founde certayne small graynes of golde, no bygger then lintell seedes, amountyng to the weyght of twelue graynes, as they proued with theyr balances of assaie, before a notarie and wytnesse, that the better credite myght bee geuen thereto. Whereby they argued, that the rychenesse of that land was agreeable to the report of the borderers, although <HI>Vaschus</HI> coulde by no meanes cause <HI>Tumanama</HI> to confesse the same. They suppose that he nothyng esteemed so small a por∣tion: but other say, that he denyed his countrey to be fruiteful of golde, least by reason thereof, the desyre of golde myght intyse our men to inhabyte his kyngdome, as in deede the seely kyng was a prophet in so thynkyng. For they chose that and the region of <HI>Pocchorrosa</HI> to inhabite, and determyned to buylde townes in them both, if it should so please the kyng of Castile: aswel that they myght be baytyng places and vittailyng houses for suche as shoulde iourney towarde the south, as also that both the regions were fruiteful, and of good ground to beare fruites and trees. Intendyng nowe therefore to depart from thence, he tryed the earth by chaunce in an other place, where the co∣lour of the ground, with certayne shynyng stones, seemed to be a token of golde, where causyng a small pyt to be dygged, litle beneath the vpper crust of the earth, he founde so muche golde, as weyghed the peece of golde whiche the Spaniardes call <HI>Castellanum aureum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tokens of great plentle of gold.</NOTE> and is commonly called <HI>Pesus,</HI> but not in one graine. Reioycyng at these tokens, in hope of great riches, he bad <HI>Tumanama</HI> to be of good comfort, promysyng hym that he woulde be his freende and defender, so that he troubled not any of the kynges, whiche were frendes to the Christians: He also perswaded hym to geather plentie of golde.

Also some of them whiche were somwhat feeble, and not able to trauayle, although not greeuously sycke, were led by the armes, vntyll they came to the dominion of kyng <HI>Comogrus,</HI> a great frende to the Chri∣stians, of whom we haue largely made mention before. At <HI>Vas∣chus</HI> commyng thyther, he founde that the olde kyng was dead, and his sonne (whom we so praysed for his wysedome) to reigne in his steade, and that he was baptised by the name of Charles. The palace of this <HI>Comogrus,</HI> is situate at the foote of a stiepe hyll well cultured, hauyng toward the south a playne of twelue leagues in breadth, and very fruitefull. This playne they call <HI>Zauana.</HI> Beyond this, are the great and hygh moun∣taynes, whiche diuide the two seas, whereof we haue spoken before.

These af∣fayres thus happely atchiued, he went forward on his voyage to the palaice of kyng <HI>Poncha,</HI> where he found foure young men, which were come from <HI>Dariena,</HI> to certifie hym that there were certayne shyppes come from <HI>Hispaniola</HI> laden with vyttayles, and other necessaries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vaschus retur∣neth to Dari∣ena.</NOTE> Wherfore takyng with hym twentie of his most lusty souldiers, he made hast to <HI>Dariena,</HI> with long ior∣neys: leauyng the residue behynd him, to folowe at theyr leysure.

Neuerthelesse he determi∣ned to searche the East partes of this land, reuoluyng in his minde that the regions of <HI>Paria</HI> &amp; <HI>Os draconis</HI> with other coastes founde before towards the East, shoulde be neere there about, as in deede they were. Departyng therfore from the large re∣gion of <HI>Quiriquetana,</HI> the .xiii. day of the calendes of September, when he had sayled thyrtie leagues, he found a ryuer, within the mouth wherof he drewe freshe water in the sea:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freshe water in the sea.</NOTE> where also the shore was so cleane without rockes, that he founde grounde e∣uery where, where he myght aptly cast anker. He writeth, that the swift course of the <HI>Ocean</HI> was so vehement and contrary, that in the space of fourtie dayes, he coulde scarcely sayle threescore and tenne leagues, and that with much dyfficultie, with many fetches and compassynges, fyndyng him selfe to be some tymes repulsed and dryuen farre backe by the violent course of the sea, when he woulde haue taken lande towarde the euening, leaste perhaps wanderyng in vnknowen coastes in the darcknesse of the nyght, he myght be in daunger of shypwracke. He wry∣teth, that in the space of eyght leagues, he found three great and fayre ryuers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fayre ryuers.

In these riuers was also great plenty of fyshe, and great Tortoyses:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Tor∣toyses.</NOTE> Lykewyse in many pla∣ces, multitudes of Crocodyles lying in the sande, and yanyng to take the heate of the sonne: besyde, dyuers other kyndes of beastes, wherunto he gaue no names. He sayeth also, that the soyle of that lande is verye diuers and variable, beyng some∣where stonye and full of rough and craggie promontories, or poyntes reachyng into the sea, and in other places as fruite∣full as may be. They haue also diuers kynges and rulers. In some places they call a kyng <HI>Cacicus</HI>: in other places
<PB REF="123"/>
they call hym <HI>Quebi,</HI> and somewhere <HI>Tiba.</HI> Such as haue be∣haued them selues valyantlye in the warres agaynst theyr enemies, and haue theyr faces full of scarres, they call <HI>Cupras,</HI> and honour them as the antiquitie dyd the gods whiche they cal∣led <HI>Heroes,</HI> supposed to be the soules of suche men, as in theyr lyfe tyme excelled in vertue and noble actes. The common peo∣ple they call <HI>Chiui,</HI> and a man, they call <HI>Homem.</HI> When they say in theyr language, take man, they say <HI>Hoppa home.</HI> After this, he came to an other ryuer apt to beare great shippes, be∣fore the mouth whereof, lye foure small Ilandes, full of flory∣shyng and fruitfull trees:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quatuor tempora.</HI></NOTE> these Ilandes he named <HI>Quatuor tem∣pora.</HI> From hence, sayling toward the East for the space of .xiii. leagues, styl against the violent course of the water, he found twelue other small Ilandes, in the which, because he founde a new kind of fruites, much like vnto our Lemonds, he called them <HI>Limonar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> Wanderyng yet further the same way for the space of .xii. leagues, he founde a great hauen entryng into the lande, after the maner of a gulfe, the space of three leagues, and in maner as brode, into y<SUP>e</SUP> which fel a great riuer. Here was <HI>Nicuesa</HI> lost afterward, when he sought <HI>Beragua,</HI> by reason whereof, they called it <HI>Rio de los perdidos,</HI> that is, the ryuer of the lost men. Thus <HI>Colonus</HI> the Admiral, yet further continuyng his course agaynst the furye of the sea, founde manye hygh mountaynes, and horrible valleys, with dyuers ryuers and hauens, from all the which (as he sayth) proceeded sweete sauours, greatly recre∣atyng and comfortyng nature: Insomuche that in al this long tract, there was not one of his men diseased, vntyll he came to a region whiche thinhabitantes call <HI>Quicuris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The region of Quicuri.</NOTE> in the whiche is the hauen called <HI>Cariai,</HI> named <HI>Mirobalanus</HI> by the Admirall, by∣cause the <HI>Mirobalane</HI> trees are natiue in the regions thereabout. In this hauen of <HI>Cariai,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The hauen of Cariai or Mi∣robalanus</NOTE> there came about two hundred of thin∣habitantes to the sea syde, with euerye of them three or foure dartes in theyr handes, yet of condition gentle yenough, and not refusyng straungers. Their commyng was for none other purpose, then to knowe what this newe nation meant, or what they brought with them. When our men had geuen them sygnes of peace, they came swymmyng to the shyppes, and de∣syred to barter with them by exchaunge. The Admiral, to
<PB N="113" REF="123"/>
allure them to frendshyppe, geue them many of our thynges: But they refused them, suspecting some disceyt thereby, bycause he would not receiue theirs. They wrought all by sygnes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciuile and hu∣mane people</NOTE> for one vnderstoode not a woord of the others language. Suche gyftes as were sent them, they left on the shore, and woulde take no part thereof. They are of suche ciuilitie and humanitie, that they esteeme it more honorable to geue, then to take. They sent our men two young women, beyng virgines, of commen∣dable fauour, and goodly stature, sygnifying vnto them, that they myght take them away with them, if it were their pleasure. These women, after the maner of their countrey, were couered from their ancles somwhat aboue their priuye partes, with a certayne cloth made of gossampine cotton, but the men are all naked. The women vse to cut their heare: but the men let it growe on the hynder part of their heades, and cut it on the fore part. Their long heare, they bynde vp with fyllettes, and wynde it in sundry rowles, as our maydes are accustomed to do. The virgines whiche were sent to the Admirall, he decked in fayre apparell, and gaue them many gyftes, and sent them home agayne. But lykewyse all these rewardes and apparel they left vppon the shore, bycause our men had refused their giftes. Yet tooke he two men away with hym (and those very wyllyngly) that by learnyng the Spanyshe tongue, he myght afterward vse them for interpretours. He considered that the tractes of these coastes were not greatly troubled with vehement motions, or ouerflowynges of the sea, forasmuche as trees growe in the sea not farre from the shore, euen as they doo vppon the bankes of ryuers: the whiche thyng also other do affirme, whiche haue latelyer searched those coastes, declaryng that the sea ryseth and falleth but litle therabout. He sayth furthermore, that in the prospect of this land, there are trees engendred euen in the sea, which after that they are growen to any height,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees growing in the sea after a strange sort.</NOTE> bend downe the toppes of theyr braunches into the ground: whiche em∣brasyng them, causeth other braunches to spring out of the same, and take roote in the earth, bryngyng foorth trees in theyr kynd successiuely, as dyd the fyrst root from whence they had theyr o∣ryginall, as do also the settes of vines, when onely both the endes thereof are put into the grounde.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plinie.</HI></NOTE> Plinie in the twelfth

booke of his natural historie maketh mention of suche trees, describyng them to be on the lande, but not in the sea. The Admiral wryteth also, that the lyke beastes are engendred in the coastes of <HI>Cariai,</HI> as in other prouinces of these regions, and such as we haue spoken of before:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange kynd of Monkeys.</NOTE> Yet that there is one founde here in nature muche differyng from the other. This beast is of the bygnesse of a great Monkey, but with a tayle much lon∣ger and bygger, it lyueth in the wooddes, and remoueth from tree to tree in this maner: Hangyng by the tayle vppon the braunche of a tree, and geatheryng strength by swaying her body twyse or thryse to and fro, she casteth her selfe from branche to branche, and so from tree to tree, as though she flewe. An ar∣cher of ours hurt one of them, who, perceiuyng her selfe to be wounded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Monkey fyghteth with a man.</NOTE> leapt downe from the tree, and fiercely set on him whi∣che gaue her the wound, in so much that he was fayne to defend hym selfe with his swoorde. And thus by chaunce, cuttyng of one of her armes, he tooke her, and with much a do brought her to the shyppes, where within a while she waxed tame. Whyle she was thus kept and bounde with cheynes, certayne other of our hunters had chased a wylde Bore out of the maryshes neere vnto the sea syde: for hunger and desyre of fleshe, caused them to take double pleasure in huntyng. In this meane tyme other which remayned in the shyppes, goyng a lande to recreate them selues, tooke this Monkie with them, who, assoone as she had espyed the Bore, set vp her brystels, and made towarde him. The Bore lykewyse shooke his bristels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A conflyct be∣twene a Mon∣key and a wyld Bore.</NOTE> and whet his teeth. The Monkie furiously inuaded the Bore, wrappyng her tayle about his body, &amp; with her arme, reserued of her victourer, helde him so fast about the throte, that he was suffocate. These people of <HI>Ca∣riai,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bodyes of kynges dryed and reserued.</NOTE> vse to drie the dead bodyes of theyr princes vppon hurdels, and so reserue them inuolued in the leaues of trees. As he went forwarde, about twentie leagues from <HI>Cariai,</HI> he founde a gulfe of suche largenes, that it contayned .xii. leagues in compasse, in the mouth of this gulfe was foure litle Ilandes, so neere togeather, that they made a safe hauen to enter into the gulfe: This gulfe is the hauen whiche we sayde before to be called <HI>Cerabaro</HI> of thinhabitantes. But they haue nowe learned, that only the land of the one syde therof, lying on the ryght hande
<PB N="114" REF="124"/>
at the enteryng of the gulfe, is called by that name, but that on the left syde, is called <HI>Aburema.</HI> He sayth that all this gulfe is full of fruitefull Ilandes, wel replenished with goodly trees, and the grounde of the sea to be very cleane without rockes, and commodious to cast anker: lykewyse the sea of the gulfe to haue great abundance of fyshe, and the lande on both the sydes to bee inferyor to none in fruitfulnes. At his fyrst arryuyng, he espyed two of thinhabitantes, hauyng cheynes about theyr neckes, made of ouches (whiche they call <HI>Guauines</HI>) of base golde, artificially wrought in the fourmes of Eagles, and Lions, with dyuers other beastes, and foules. Of the two Cariaians whiche he brought with hym from <HI>Cariai,</HI> he was en∣fourmed that the regions of <HI>Cerabaro</HI> and <HI>Aburema</HI> were rych in golde, and that the people of <HI>Cariai,</HI> haue al theyr gold from thence for exchaunge of other of theyr thynges. They tolde hym also, that in the same regions there are fiue villages, not farre from the sea syde, whose inhabitants apply them selues onely to the gea∣thering of gold. The names of these villages are these, <HI>Chirara, Puren, Chitaza, Iureche, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amea.</HI> All the men of the prouince of <HI>Cerabaro,</HI> go naked, &amp; are painted with diuers colours.

The women couer only theyr priuie partes with a fyllet of gossampine cotton. Depart∣ing from hence, &amp; coasting styll by the same shore for the space of xviii. leagues, he came to another ryuer, where he espyed about three hundred naked men in a company. When they sawe the shyppes drawe neare the lande, they cryed out aloude, with cruel countenaunces, shakyng theyr woodden swoordes, and hur∣lyng dartes, takyng also water in theyr mouthes, and spouting the same agaynst our men: whereby they seemed to insinuate, that they woulde receiue no condition of peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spytefull people.</NOTE> or haue ought to do with them. Here he commaunded certayne pieces of ordi∣naunce to be shot of cowarde them, yet so to ouershoote them, that none myght be hurt thereby: For he euer determined to deale quietly &amp; peaceably with these newe nations. At the noyse therefore of the gunnes, and syght of the fyre, they fel downe to the grounde, and desyred peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guns make peace.</NOTE> Thus enteryng into fur∣ther frendshyp, they exchaunged theyr cheynes and ouches of

golde, for glasses, and haukes belles, and suche other marchan∣dies. They vse drummes or tymbrels made of the shelles of certaine sea fyshes, wherewith they encorage them selues in the warres.

They defende them selues agaynst rayne and heat with certayne great leaues of trees, in the steade of clokes. Departyng from hence, he searched the coastes of <HI>Ebetere,</HI> and <HI>Embigar,</HI> into the whiche fall the goodly ryuers of <HI>Zohoran</HI> and <HI>Cubigar</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note wher the plentie of gold endeth</NOTE> And here ceasseth the plentie and fruitfulnes of gold, in the tract of fiftie leagues, or there about.

The kyng is paynted with blacke colours, but all the people with redde. The kyng and seuen of his noble men, had euery of them a litle plate of golde hangyng at theyr nosethrylles, downe vnto theyr lyppes: and this they take for a comely ornament. The men inclose theyr priuie mem∣bers in a shell, and the women couer theyrs with a fyllet of gos∣sampine cotton, tyed about theyr loynes. In theyr gardens they noryshe a fruite muche lyke the nut of a pine tree, the which (as we haue sayde in an other place) groweth on a shrubbe, muche lyke vnto an hartichoke, but the fruite is much softer, and meate for a kyng: also certayne trees whiche beare gourdes, whereof we haue spoken before: this tree they call <HI>Hibuero.</HI> In these coastes they met sometymes with Crocodiles lying on the sandes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crocodiles of sweet sauour.</NOTE> the whiche when they fled, or tooke the water, they left a very sweete sauoure behynde them, sweeter then muske or <HI>Castoreum.</HI> When I was sent ambassadoure for the catho∣lyke kyng of Castile, to the Soltane of Babylon, or Alcayre in Egypt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcayr or Baby¦lon in Egypt.</NOTE> thinhabitantes neere vnto the ryuer of <HI>Nilus</HI> tolde me the lyke of theyr female Crocodiles, affyrmyng furthermore, that the fat or shewet of them, is equall in sweetnes with the pleasaunt gummes of Arabie. But the Admirall was nowe at

the length enforced of necessitie to depart from hence, aswell for that he was no longer able to abyde the contrarie and vio∣lent course of the water, as also that his shyppes were dayly more and more putrified, and eaten through with certayne wor∣mes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shyppes eaten with wormes.</NOTE> which are engendred of the warmenesse of the water in al those tractes, neere vnto the Equinoctiall line.

They are a cubit in length, and somewhat more, not passing the quantitie of a fynger in big∣nesse. The Spanysh mariner calleth this pestilence <HI>Broma. Co∣lonus</HI> therfore, whom before the great monsters of the sea could not feare, now fearyng this <HI>Broma,</HI> being also sore vexed with the contrary fall of the sea, directed his course with the <HI>Ocean</HI> toward the west, and came first to the riuer <HI>Hiebra,</HI> distant only two leagues from the riuer of <HI>Beragua,</HI> because that was cōmodious to harborowe great shyps. This region is named after the riuer, and is called <HI>Beragua</HI> the lesse, because both the riuers are in the dominion of the kyng whiche inhabiteth the region of <HI>Beragua.</HI> But what chaunced vnto hym in this voyage on the ryght hand and on the left, let vs now declare. While therfore <HI>Co∣lonus</HI> the Admiral remayned yet in the riuer <HI>Hiebra,</HI> he sent <HI>Bar∣tholomeus Colonus</HI> his brother, and Liefetenaunt of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> with the shyp boates, and threescore and eyght men, to the riuer of <HI>Beragua,</HI> where the kyng of the region, beyng naked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Howe the kyng of Beragua en∣tertayned the Lieuetenant.</NOTE> and paynted after the maner of the countrey, came towards them, with a great multitude of men waytyng on hym, but all vnarmed and without weapons, geuyng also signes of peace. When he approched neerer, and entred communication with our men, cer∣tayne of his gentlemen, neerest about his person, remembring the maiestie of a kyng, and that it stoode not with his honour to bargayne standyng, tooke a great stone out of the riuer, wash∣yng and rubbing it very decently, and so put it vnder hym,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their reuerēce to their kyng.</NOTE> with humble reuerence. The kyng thus sittyng, seemed with signes and tokens, to insinuate that it should be lawful for our men to search and viewe al the riuers within his dominion. Wherfore, the syxt day of the Ides of February, leauing his boates with certayne of his company, he went by land a foote, from the

bankes of <HI>Beragua,</HI> vntyll he came to the ryuer of <HI>Duraba,</HI> which he affirmeth to be rycher in gold then eyther <HI>Hiehra</HI> or <HI>Beragua</HI>: For gold is engendred in all ryuers of that land, insomuch that among the rootes of trees growing by the bankes of the ryuers, and among the stones left of the water, and also wheresoeuer they dygged a hole or pyt in the grounde, not past the deapth of a handefull and a halfe, they founde the earth, beyng taken out therof, myxte with golde: whereuppon he determyned to fasten his foote there, and to inhabit. Whiche thing the people of the countrey perceiuing, and smellyng what inconuenience and mis∣chiefe myght thereof ensue to their countrey, if they should par∣mit straungers to plant theyr inhabitations there, assembled a great armie, and with horrible outcryes assayled our men (who had now begun to build houses) so desperatly, that they were scarcely able for to abyde the fyrst brunt. These naked Barbarians at theyr fyrst approche, vsed onely slynges and dartes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slynges and dartes.</NOTE> but when they came neerer to hande strokes, they fought with theyr woodden swoordes, whiche they cal <HI>Macha∣nas,</HI> as we haue sayde before. A man woulde not thynke what great malice and wrath was kyndled in theyr hartes agaynst our men, and with what desperate myndes they fought for the defence of theyr libertie, whiche they more esteeme then lyfe or riches:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Libertie more esteemed then ryches.</NOTE> For they were now so voyde of al feare, and contemning death, that they neyther feared long bowes or crosse bowes, nor yet (which is moste to be marueyled) were any thyng discoura∣ged at the terrible noyse of the gunnes, shotte of from the shyppes. They retyred once: but shortly after encreasyng theyr number, they returned more fiercely then at the fyrste. They woulde haue ben contented to haue receiued our men frendly as straungers, but not as inhabitours. The more instant that our men were to remayne, so much the greater multitude of bor∣derers flocked togeather dayly, disturbyng them both nyght and day, sometymes on the one syde, and sometymes on the other.

But theyr calamitie ceassed not heere: For as fast as theyr shyppes leaked, theyr strength diminished, so that they were no longer able to keepe them from sinkyng.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A miserable case.</NOTE> By reason whereof, fallyng into the handes of the Barbarians, and inclo∣sed without hope of departure, they led theyr lyues for the space of tenne monethes among the naked people, more miserablie then euer dyd <HI>Achemenides</HI> among the Giauntes, called <HI>Ci∣clopes,</HI> rather lyuyng, then beyng eyther contented or satisfied with the strange meates of that Ilande, and that onely at suche tymes as pleased the Barbarians to geue them part of theyrs.

That part of the mountaynes which includeth the limittes of <HI>Beragua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The moūtayns of Beragua higher then the cloudes.</NOTE> is thought to be hygher then the cloudes, insomuch that (as they say) the tops of them can seldome be seene for the multitude of thicke cloudes whiche are beneath the same. <HI>Colanus</HI> the Admi∣ral, the fyrst fynder of these regions, affirmeth that the toppes of the mountaines of <HI>Beragua,</HI> are more then fiftie myles in heyght.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountaynes of fiftie myles heyght.</NOTE> He sayth furthermore, that in the same region at the rootes of the mountaynes the way is open to the south sea, &amp; compareth it as it were betwene Uenice and <HI>Genua,</HI> or <HI>Ianua,</HI> as the Genues wyl haue it called, whiche fable that theyr citie was builded of <HI>Ianus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ianus other∣wase called Iaphet the son of Noe.</NOTE> He affirmeth also, that this land reacheth forth toward the south, and that from hence it taketh the begynning of breadth: lyke as from the Alpes, out of the narowe thygh of Italie, we see the large and mayne landes of Fraunce, Germanie, and Pannonie, to the Sarmatians and Scithians, euen vnto the mountaynes and rockes of Riphea, and the frosen sea, and embrase therewith, as with a continuall bonde, al Thracia, and Grecia, with all that is included within the promontorie or poynt of <HI>Malea,</HI> and <HI>Hellespontus</HI> southwarde, and the sea <HI>Euzinus,</HI> and the marys∣shes of <HI>Meotis</HI> in <HI>Scithia</HI> northwarde.

Deca. iii. lib. vi.</NOTE> but rather that that lande is adherent to the firme landes towarde the North, as we haue sayde before. It shall suffice to haue sayde thus muche of the length hereof: Let vs nowe therefore speake somwhat of the breadth of the same. We haue made mention before howe the south sea is diuided by narowe limittes from our Ocean, as it was proued by thexperience of <HI>Vaschus Nunnez</HI> and his com∣panions, which fyrst made open the way thyther. But as dyuers∣ly the mountaynes of our Alpes in Europe are somwhere na∣rowe, and in some place brode: euen so, by the lyke prouidence of nature, this land in some part therof reacheth farre in breadth, and is in other places coarcted with narowe limittes from sea to sea, with valleys also in some places, whereby men may passe from the one syde to the other. Where we haue described the regions of <HI>Vraba</HI> and <HI>Beragua</HI> to be situate, these seas are diui∣ded by small distaunce: Yet ought we to thynke the region, whiche the great ryuer of <HI>Maragnonus</HI> runneth through,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great riuer Maragnonus.</NOTE> to be very large, if we shall graunt <HI>Maragnonum</HI> to be a ryuer, and no sea, as the freshe waters of the same ought to perswade vs. For in suche narowe caues of the earth, there can be no swalowyng gulfes of suche bygnesse as to receiue or nooryshe so great a∣bundance of water.

This superstition hath been per∣suaded them by a craftie kynde of men, vnder pretence of reli∣gion, to thintent that they myght enioy suche gyftes and offe∣ringes as were brought to the place where she was honoured. This is sufficient for this purpose. They say furthermore, that the maryshes of the narowe land, whereof we haue spoken, bring forth great plentie of Crocodiles, Dragons, Battes, and Gnats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dragons and Crocodiles in the maryshes.</NOTE> beyng very hurtfull. Therefore whensoeuer they take any iour∣ney towarde the south, they go out of the way toward the moun∣taynes, and eschewe the regions neere vnto those perylous fennes or maryshes.

This land seemeth also to promise many precious stones:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Precious stones.</NOTE> For besyde those which I sayde to be founde neere vnto <HI>Cariai</HI> and <HI>Sancta Martha,</HI> one <HI>Andreas Moralis,</HI> a pilot (who had trauayled those coastes with <HI>Iohannes de la Cossa</HI> whyle he yet lyued) had a precious Dia∣monde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A precious Di∣amond of ex∣ceeding bignes.</NOTE> whiche he bought of a naked young man in the region of <HI>Cumana,</HI> in the prouince of <HI>Paria.</HI> This stone was as long as two ioyntes of a mans myddle fynger, and as byg as the fyrst ioynt of the thumbe, beyng also paynted on euery syde, con∣sisting of eyght squares, perfectly fourmed by nature. They say that with this they made scarres in anuylles and hammers, and brake the teeth of fyles, the stone remayning vnperyshed. The young man of <HI>Cumana,</HI> wore this stone about his necke among other ouches, &amp; solde it to <HI>Andreas Moralis</HI> for fyue of our coun∣terfect stones, made of glasse, of diuers colours, wherewith the ignorant young man was greatly delyted: They found also cer∣tayne Topases on y<SUP>e</SUP> shore.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Topasis.</NOTE> But the estimation of gold was so farre entred into the heades of our men, that they had no regarde to stones. Also the most part of the Spanyardes, do laugh them to scorne which vse to weare many stones, specially such as are common, iudging it to be an effeminate thyng, and more meete for women then men.

we ought to consyder that this lande bringeth foorth great plen∣tie of golde, and precious stones.

Yf your holynesse do aske to what purpose is all this: ye shal vnderstand, that I had scarsly finished the historie of such thynges as chaunced to <HI>Vaschus Nunnez</HI> and his compa∣nie in theyr voyage to the south sea, when sodenly there came new letters from <HI>Petrus Arias</HI> the new gouernour, whom the kyng had appoynted the yeere before with an army of men and a nauy of shyps to sayle to these newe landes.

Furthermore, <HI>Iohannes Cabedus</HI> (whom your holinesse at the re∣quest of the most catholique kyng had created Bishop of that prouince of <HI>Dariena</HI>) and three other of the cheefe officers ioyned in commission to be his assystantes, as <HI>Alfonsus de Ponte, Diegus Marques,</HI> and <HI>Iohannes de Tauira,</HI> confyrmed the same letters, and subscribed them with theyr names. The nauigation there∣fore of <HI>Petrus Arias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The nauigati∣on of Petrus Arias.</NOTE> was in this maner. The day before the Ides of Apryl, in the yeere of Christe .1514. he hoysed vp his sayles, in the towne of saint <HI>Lucar de Barrameda,</HI> situate in the mouth of the ryuer <HI>Baetis,</HI> which the Spanyardes nowe cal <HI>Guadalchebir.</HI> The seuen Ilandes of <HI>Canaria</HI> are about foure hundred myles distant from the place where this riuer falleth into the sea. Some thynke that these are the Ilandes whiche the olde wryters dyd call the fortunate Ilandes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ilande of Canarie.</NOTE> but other thynke the contrary. The name of these Ilandes are these. The two that appeare fyrst in sight, are named <HI>Lanzelota</HI> and <HI>Fortisuentura.</HI> On the back∣halfe of these, lyeth <HI>Magna Canaria</HI> or <HI>Grancanaria.</HI> Beyond that is <HI>Teuerif</HI> and <HI>Gomera</HI> somewhat towarde the north from that <HI>Palma</HI> and <HI>Ferrea</HI> lye behynde, as it were a bulwarke to al the o∣ther. <HI>Petrus Arias</HI> therfore, arriued at <HI>Gomera</HI> the eyght day af∣ter his departure, with a nauie of seuenteene ships, &amp; a thousand and fiue hundred men, although there were only a thousand and two hundred assigned hym by the kynges letters. It is sayd fur∣thermore, that he left behynde hym more then two thousande, very pensiue and sighing that they also myght not be receiued, proferyng them selues to goe at theyr owne charges. He taryed xvi. dayes in <HI>Gomera,</HI> to the intent to make prouision of fuel and freshe water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prouision of freshe water and fuel.</NOTE> but cheefely to repayre his shyppes, beyng sore broosed with tempestes, and especially the gouernours shyppe, which had lost the rudder: For these Ilandes are a commodious restyng place for al suche as intende to attempt any nauigations in that maine sea. Departing from hence in the Nones of May, he sawe no more lande vntyll the thyrde day of Iune, at the whi∣che he arryued at <HI>Dominica</HI> an Ilande of the <HI>Canibales,</HI> being di∣stant from <HI>Gomera</HI> about eight hundred leagues.

He passed also through the sea of hearbes or weedes, continu∣ing a long tract: Yet neyther he,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sea of hearbes.</NOTE> nor <HI>Colonus</HI> the Admiral (who fyrst found these Ilandes, and sayled through this sea of weedes) haue declared any reason how these weedes should come. Some thynke the sea to be verye muddye there, and that these weedes are engendred in the bottome thereof, and so beyng loosed, to ascende to the vppermost part of the water, as we see often∣tymes chaunce in certayne standyng pooles, and sometymes also in great ryuers. Other suppose that they are not engen∣dred there, but to be beaten from certayne rockes by the vio∣lence of the water in tempestes: And thus they leaue the mat∣ter in doubt. Neyther haue they yet any certayne experience whether they stycke fast and geue place to the shyppes, or wan∣der loose vpon the water: But it is to be thought, that they are engendred there, for otherwyse they shoulde be dryuen togea∣ther on heapes, by the impulsion of the shyppes, euen as a bea∣some geathereth the sweepynges of a house, and shoulde also let the course of the shyppes. The fourth day after that he depar∣ted from <HI>Dominica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">These moun∣taines are cal∣led Montes Niuales, or Serra Neuata, Decade .ii. lib. 1. and .ii.</NOTE> the hyghe mountaynes couered with snowe (whereof we haue spoken in the seconde Decade) appeared vn∣to hym.

From these mountaynes falleth the ryuer of <HI>Gaira,</HI> famous by the slaughter of our men, at such tyme as <HI>Rodericus Colmenares</HI> passed by those coastes, as we haue sayde before: Lykewyse many other fayre ryuers haue theyr original from the same mountaynes.

westward, about fyftie leagues. He wryteth marueylous things of the hauen of <HI>Sancta Martha,</HI> whiche they also confirme that came lately from thence: Of the which young <HI>Vesputius</HI> is one, to whom <HI>Americus Vesputius</HI> his vncle (beyng a florentine borne) left the exact knowledge of the mariners facultie, as it were by inheritance after his death, for he was a very expert maister in the knowledge of his carde, his compasse, and the eleuation of the pole starre, with all that parteyneth therto. This young <HI>Ves∣putius</HI> was assigned by the kyng to be one of the maisters of the gouernours shyp, because he was cunnyng in iudging the de∣grees of the eleuation of the pole starre by the quadrant: For the charge of gouerning the rudder, was cheefly committed to one <HI>Iohannes Serranus</HI> a Spaniard, who had oftentymes ouer∣runne those coastes. <HI>Vesputius</HI> is my very familier frende, and a wittie young man, in whose company I take great pleasure, and therfore vse hym oftentymes for my ghest. He hath also made many voyages into these coastes, and diligentlye noted suche thynges as he hath seene. <HI>Petrus Arias</HI> therfore wryteth, and he confirmeth the same, that thinhabitantes of these regions tooke theyr originall of the Caribbes or Canibales, as appea∣red by the desperat fyersnesse and crueltie which they oftentimes shewed to our men when they passed by theyr coastes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The stoutnes of the Barbari∣ans.</NOTE> Suche stoutnesse and fortitude of mynde is naturallie engendred in these naked Barbarians, that they feared not to assayle our whole nauy, and to forbyd them to come a lande.

thynkyng the same to be thunder and lyghtnyng, turned theyr backes, and fledde amayne. They greatly feare thunder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The generati∣on of thunder and lyghtning.</NOTE> because these regions are oftentimes vexed with thunder and lyght∣nynges, by reason of the hyghe mountaynes, and nearenesse of the same to the region of the ayre, wherein such fierie tempestes are engendred, whiche the philosophers call <HI>Meteora.</HI> And albeit that our men had nowe dryuen theyr enimies to flyght, and sawe them disparcled and out of order, yet doubted they, and were of diuers opinions, whether they shoulde pursue them, or not. On the one partie shame prycked them forwarde, and on the other syde, feare caused them to caste manye perylles, especi∣ally consyderyng the venemous arrowes whiche these Barba∣rians can direct so certaynely. To depart from them with a drye foote (as sayth the prouerbe) with so great a nauie, and suche an armye, they reputed it as a thyng greatly soundyng to theyr re∣proche and dishonour. At the length therefore, shame ouercom∣myng feare, they pursued them, and came to land with theyr ship boates. The gouernour of the nauie, &amp; also <HI>Vesputius</HI> do wryte, that the hauen is no lesse then three leagues in compasse, beyng also safe without rockes, and the water therof so cleare, that a man may see pybble stones in the bottome twentie cubits deepe. They say lykewyse, that there falleth two fayre ryuers of freshe water into the hauen: but the same to be meeter to beare the Canoas of these prouinces, then any bygger vessels. It is a delectable thyng to heare what they tel of the plentie and varie∣tie, and also of the pleasaunt tast of the fyshes, aswell of these ry∣uers, as of the sea therabout: By reason wherof they found here manye fysher boates and nettes woonderfully wrought of the stalkes of certayne hearbes or weedes, dryed and tawed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plentie of fysh.</NOTE> and wreathed with cords of spunne gossampyne cotton.

They eate mans fleshe but seldome, because they meete not oftentymes with strangers, except they goe foorth of theyr one dominions with a mayne army, of purpose to hunt for men, when theyr rauenyng appetite pricketh them forwarde: For they abstayne from them selues, and eate none but suche as they take in the warres, or otherwyse by chaunce. But suerly it is a miserable thyng to heare howe many myriades of men these fylthy and vn∣naturall deuourers of mens fleshe haue consumed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One myriade, is ten thou∣sande.</NOTE> and lefte thou∣sandes of most fayre and fruitefull Ilandes and regions desolate without men: by reason whereof, our men founde so manye Ilandes, whiche for theyr fayrenes and fruitefulnesse myght seeme to be certayne earthly Paradyses, and yet were vtterly voyde of men. Hereby your holynesse may consider howe perni∣tious a kynde of men this is. We haue sayde before, that the I∣lande named <HI>Sancti Iohannis</HI> (which thinhabitants cal <HI>Burichena</HI>) is next to <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> It is sayde, that only the Canibales which dwel in the other Ilandes neere about this, as in the Ilande cal∣led <HI>Hayhay</HI> or <HI>Sansta Crucis,</HI> and in <HI>Guadalupea</HI> (otherwyse called
<PB REF="133"/>
<HI>Queraqueiera,</HI> or <HI>Carucuiera</HI>) haue in our tyme violently taken out of the sayde Ilande of <HI>Sancti Iohannis,</HI> more then fyue thousande men to be eaten. But let it suffice thus muche to haue wandered by these monstrous bloodsuckers. We wyll nowe therfore speake somwhat of the rootes whereof they make theyr bread, forasmuche as the same shal hereafter be foode to Christian men, in steade of bread made of wheate, and in the steade of radyshe, with such other rootes as they haue been ac∣customed to eate in Europe. We haue oftentymes sayd before, that <HI>Iucca</HI> is a roote, whereof the best and most delicate bread is made, both in the firme lande of these regions, and also in the Ilandes: but howe it is tylled or husbanded, howe it groweth, and of how dyuers kyndes it is, I haue not yet declared. Ther∣fore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of plantyng the roote Iucca.</NOTE> when they entende to plant this <HI>Iucca,</HI> they make a hole in the earth, knee deepe, and rayse a heape of the earth taken out of the same, fashionyng it lyke a square bedde, of niene foote breadth on euery syde, settyng twelue trunkes of these roots (be∣yng about a foote and a halfe long a peece) in euery of the sayd beddes, contaynyng three rootes of a syde, so layde a slope, that the endes of them ioyne in maner togeather in the center or mid∣dest of the bedde within the ground. Out of the ioyntes of the rootes, and spaces betwene the same, spryng the toppes and blades of newe rootes, whiche by litle and litle encreasyng, growe to the bygnes and length of a mans arme in the brawne, and oftentymes as bygge as the thygh: so that by the tyme of theyr full rypenes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth turned into rootes.</NOTE> in maner all the earth of the heape is con∣uerted into rootes. But they say that these rootes are not rype in lesse then a yeere and a halfe, and that the longer they are suf∣fered to grow, euen vntyl two yeeres complete, they are so much the better, and more perfecte to make bread thereof. When they are taken foorth of the earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Howe bread is made of rootes</NOTE> they scrape them, and slyse them, with certayne sharpe stones, seruyng for the same purpose: And thus laying them betwene two great stones, or puttyng them in a sacke made of the stalkes of certaine tough hearbes and smal reedes, they presse them (as do we cheese or crabbes, to drawe out the iuice thereof) and so let them drye a daye before they eate them. The iuice or liquour they cast away: for (as we haue sayde) it is deadly poyson in the Ilandes. Yet is the iuice of
<PB N="123" REF="133"/>
suche as growe in the firme land wholesome, yf it be sodde, as is the whey of our mylke. They say that there are many kyndes of this <HI>Iucca,</HI> wherof some are more pleasaunt and delicate then the other, and are therefore reserued as it were to make fyue Manchet for the kynges owne table: But the Gentlemen eate of the meaner sort, and the common people of the basest. The fi∣nest they call <HI>Cazabbi,</HI> whiche they make rounde lyke cakes, in certayne presses, before they seethe it, or bake it. They say furthermore, that there are lykewyse diuers kyndes of the rootes of <HI>Ages,</HI> and <HI>Battata.</HI> But they vse these rather as fruites, and dyshes of seruice, then to make bread thereof, as we vse Rapes, Radishes, Mushromes, Nauies, Persnippes, and suche lyke. In this case, they moste especiallye esteeme the best kynde of <HI>Battatas,</HI> which in pleasant taste and tendernesse, farre exceedeth our Mushromes. It shal suffise to haue sayd thus much of rootes: We wyl nowe therefore speake of another kynde of their bread. We declared before, that they haue a kynde of grayne or Pulse, muche lyke vnto <HI>Panicum,</HI> but with somewhat bygger graynes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Panicum is a grayne some∣what lyke mil: The Italians cal it Melica.</NOTE> which they beate into meale, vpon certaine great hollow stones, with the labour of theyr handes, when they lacke <HI>Iucca,</HI> and of this is made the more vulgar or common bread. It is sowen thryse a yeere, so that the fruitefulnesse of the ground may beare it, by reason of the equalitie of the tyme, whereof we haue spoken sufficiently before. In these regions they founde also the grayne of <HI>Maizium,</HI> and sundry kyndes of fruites of trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He meaneth the equal length of day and nyght which is conti∣nualy in regi∣ons vnder the Equinoctiall line.</NOTE> diligentlye planted, and wel husbanded. The way betweene the regions of <HI>Caramairi</HI> and <HI>Saturma,</HI> is fayre, broode, and ryght foorth. They founde here also sundry kyndes of water pottes made of earth, of diuers colours, in the whiche they both fetche and keepe freshe water: Lykewyse sundry kyndes of iugges, god∣derdes, drynkyng cuppes, pottes, pannes, dyshes, and plat∣ters, artificially made. When the gouernour had geuen com∣maundement by proclamation, that the inhabitauntes should ey∣ther obey the Christian kyng, and embrace our religion, or els to depart out of theyr countrey: they answered with venemous arrowes. In this skyrmyshe, our men tooke some of them: whereof, clothyng the moste parte in fayre apparell, they sent them againe to their owne company: But leading the residue to

the shyppes, to thintent to shewe them the power and magnifi∣cence of the christians, that they might declare the same to theyr companions, therby to wynne their fauour, they appareled them lykewyse, and sent them after theyr felowes. They af∣fyrme, that in all the ryuers of these coast, they sawe great ar∣gumentes and tokens of golde. They founde here and there in their houses good store of Harts flesh, &amp; Bores fleshe, wherwith they fedde them selues delicately. They also haue great plentie of sundry kyndes of byrdes, and foules, whereof they bryng vp many in their houses, some for necessarye foode, and other for dayntie dyshes, as we do Hennes and Partriches. Our men hereby coniecture, that the ayre of these regions is very holsome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holsome ayre.</NOTE> forasmuche as slepyng all nyght vnder the fyrmament on the bankes of the ryuers, none of them were at any tyme offended with reumes or headache, by reason of any noysome humour, or vapour proceedyng from the earth, ayre, or water.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gossampine Cotton.

These thynges being thus brought to passe, the gouernour com∣maunded the trumpeter to blowe a retraite: Wheruppon they which were sent to lande (beyng fiue hundred in number) making a great shout for ioy of theyr victory, set them selues in order of battayle, and so keepyng theyr array, returned to the shyppes laden with spoyle of those prouinces, and shynyng in souldiers clokes of feathers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clokes of fethers.</NOTE> with fayre plumes and crestes of vari∣able colours.

good to let suche matter slyppe vntouched. The which whyle I consyder, I am drawen into no small ambiguitie and doubt, whyther those waters haue theyr course, whiche flowe with so continuall a tract in circuite from the East, as though they fledde to the west, neuer to returne, and yet neyther the west thereby any whit the more fylled, nor the East emptied. If we shall say that they fall to theyr centre (as is the nature of heauie thynges) and assigne the Equinoctiall line to bee the centre (as some affyrme) what centre shall we appoynt to be able to receiue so great abundance of water?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Equinoc∣tial line.</P>
<P>Why al waters moue towarde the south or E∣quinoctial, read <HI>Cardanus ae subtilit liber ii. de elementis.</HI> Strayghtes.</P></NOTE> Or what circum∣ference shall be founde wet? They whiche haue searched those coastes, haue yet founde no lyke reason to be true. Many thynke that there shoulde bee certayne large straightes or en∣trances in the corner of that great lande, whiche we described to be eyght tymes bygger then Italye, and the corner there∣of to be full of gulfes, whereby they suppose that some straygh∣tes shoulde passe through the same, lying on the west syde of the Ilande of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and that the sayde strayghtes shoulde swa∣lowe vp those waters, and so conuey the same into the west, and from thence agayne into our East Ocean, or north seas, as some thynke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">As by the strayght of Magelanus The north landes.</NOTE> Other wyll, that the gulfe of that great lande be closed vp, and the lande to reache farre towarde the north on the backe syde of <HI>Cuba,</HI> so that it embrace the north landes, whiche the frosen sea encompasseth vnder the north pole, and that all the lande of those coastes, shoulde ioyne togeather as one firme lande: Whereby they coniecture, that those waters shoulde be turned about by the obiecte or resistaunce of that land, so bendyng towarde the north, as we see the waters turned about in the crooked bankes of certayne ryuers. But this agreeth not in all poyntes. For they also whiche haue searched the frosen sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The frosen sea.</NOTE> and sayled from thence into the west, do lykewyse affyrme, that those north seas flowe continually towarde the west, al∣though nothyng so swiftely. These north seas haue ben searched by one Sebastian Cabot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sebastian Ca∣bot.</NOTE> a Uenetian borne, whom beyng yet but in maner an infant, his parentes caryed with them into Englande, hauyng occasion to resort thither for trade of mar∣chandize, as is the maner of the Uenetians, to leaue no part of the worlde vnsearched to obtaine rychesse.

two shyppes in England at his owne charges: And fyrst with three hundreth men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The voyage of Sebastian Ca∣bot from Eng∣lande to the frosen sea.</NOTE> directed his course so farre towarde the north pole, that euen in the moneth of Iuly he founde monstrous heapes of Ise swymming on the sea, and in maner continuall day lyght: Yet sawe he the lande in that tract free from Ise, whiche had ben moulten by heat of the Sonne. Thus seeyng suche heapes of Ise before hym, he was enforced to turne his sayles, and folowe the west, so coastyng styll by the shore, that he was thereby brought so farre into the south, by reason of the lande bendyng so muche southwarde, that it was there almost equall in latitude with the sea called <HI>Fretum Herculeum,</HI> hauyng the north pole eleuate in maner in the same degree. He sayled lykewyse in this tract so farre towarde the west, that he had the Ilande of <HI>Cuba</HI> on his left hande, in maner in the same degree of longitude. As he traueyled by the coastes of this great lande (whiche he named <HI>Baccallaos</HI>) he sayth, that he founde the lyke course of the waters toward the west, but the same to runne more softly and gentelly, then the swifte waters whiche the Spany∣ardes founde in their nauigations southwarde. Wherefore, it is not onely more lyke to be true, but ought also of necessitie to be concluded, that betwene both the landes hitherto vnknowen, there shoulde be certayne great open places, wherby the waters should thus continually passe from the East into the west: whiche waters I suppose to be dryuen about the globe of the earth by the vncessaunt mouyng and impulsion of the heauens, and not to beswalowed vp and cast out agayne by the breathyng of <HI>De∣mogorgon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Demogorgon is the spirite of the earth.</NOTE> as some haue imagined, bycause they see the seas by increase &amp; decrease, to flow &amp; reflow.

<PB REF="136"/>
the Beares beyng thus satisfied with fyshe, are not noysome to men. He declareth further, that in many places of these regi∣ons, he sawe great plentie of laton among the inhabitauntes. <HI>Cabot</HI> is my very frend, whom I vse fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lierlye, and delyte to haue hym sometymes keepe me company in my owne house: For beyng called out of Englande by the commaundement of the catholique kyng of Castile, after the death of Henry kyng of Englande, the seuenth of that name, he was made one of our counsayle and assistaunce as touching the affayres of the new Indies, lookyng dayly for shyppes to be furnished for hym to discouer this hyd secret of nature.

For from both the corners, as from the East angle and the West, he des∣cribed it to be indented &amp; eaten with many great gulfes, and the corners to reache foorth very farre, and placeth manye large and safe hauens in the great gulfe on the East syde:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A particuler carde of Hispa∣niola.</NOTE> But I trust short∣ly so to trauayle further herein, that a perfect carde of the perti∣cular description of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> may be sent vnto your holynesse.

For on the south syde, the day ascendeth scarcely an houre in length aboue the nyght, or contrarywyse.

But this shypmaister hath brought an other des∣cription, obserued of the inhabitauntes from the beginnyng.
<PB N="134" REF="144"/>
Let vs therfore diuide the whole Iland into fiue partes, cal∣lyng the regions of euery prouince by theyr olde names: and fi∣nally make mention of such thyngs as are worthy memory in euery of them. The beginning of the Ilande on the East syde, is conteyned in the prouince named <HI>Caizcimu,</HI> so named for that in theyr language <HI>Cimu</HI> signifieth the front or beginning of anye thyng. After this, foloweth the prouince of <HI>Huhabo,</HI> and then <HI>Caihabo,</HI> the fourth is <HI>Bainoa. Guaccaiarima</HI> conteyneth the west corner. But the last saue one, <HI>Bainoa</HI> is of larger boundes then the three other. <HI>Caizcimu</HI> reacheth from the fyrst front of the I∣land to the ryuer <HI>Hozama,</HI> which runneth by the citie of saint Dominicke. But towarde the North syde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The citie of S. Dominick.</NOTE> it is ended at the rough mountaynes of <HI>Haiti. Hubaho,</HI> is encluded within the mountaynes <HI>Haiti</HI> and the ryuer <HI>Iaciga. Caeiabo</HI> the thyrd pro∣uince, conteineth al that lyeth between <HI>Cubabo</HI> and <HI>Dahatio,</HI> euen vnto the mouth of the ryuer of <HI>Iaceha</HI> or <HI>Iache</HI> (one of the foure which diuide the Iland equally) &amp; ascendeth to the moun∣taynes of <HI>Cibaua,</HI> where the greatest plenty of gold is found, out of the which also the ryuer <HI>Demahus</HI> spryngeth: and ioining with the sprynges of the ryuer of <HI>Naiba</HI> (beyng an other of the foure which diuideth the Iland toward the south sea) falleth to an o∣ther banke of the riuer of saint Dominick. <HI>Bainoa,</HI> beginneth at the confines of <HI>Caiabi,</HI> and reacheth euen vnto the Iland of <HI>Cahi∣ni,</HI> which lyeth neare vnto the sea bankes of the North syde of the Iland, where we sayde that they erected y<SUP>e</SUP> first colonie or habita∣tion. The prouince of <HI>Guaccaiarima,</HI> occupieth the remanent to∣ward the west: this they named <HI>Guaccaiarima,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of prouinces diuided into regions.</NOTE> because it is the extreeme or vttermost part of the Iland. For <HI>Iarima</HI> in theyr lan∣guage, signifieth the tayle or end of any thing, and <HI>Gua,</HI> is an ar∣ticle which they vse oftentimes in the names of things, and espe∣cially in the names of theyr kinges, as <HI>Guarionexius</HI> &amp; <HI>Guaccana∣rillus.</HI> In the prouince of <HI>Cazium,</HI> are these regions, <HI>Higuei, Gua∣nama, Reyre, Xagua, Aramana, Arabo, Hazoa, Macorix, Caiacoa, Guaiagua, Baguauimabo,</HI> &amp; the rough mountaines of <HI>Haiti.</HI> Here let vs speake somwhat of their aspirations, which they vse other∣wise then the Latines do. It is to be noted that there is no aspira∣tion in their vowels, which hath not the effect of a consonant. So that they pronounce theyr aspirations more vehemently then
<PB REF="145"/>
we do the consonant .f. Yea, all suche wordes as in theyr tongue are aspirate, are pronounced with lyke breath and spirite as is f. sauyng that heerin the neather lippe is not moued to the vp∣permost teeth. With open mouthes and shakyng theyr breastes they breath out these aspirations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The pronunci∣ation of the He∣brues and Ara∣bians.</P>
<P>The Moores and Arabians possessed Spayne.</P></NOTE> <HI>ha, he, hi, ho, hu,</HI> as the Hebru∣es and Arabians are accustomed to pronounce theyrs. I fynde also that the Spanyardes vse the lyke vehemencie in the aspira∣tions of those wordes which they haue receyued of the Moores &amp; Arabians which possessed Spaine, and continued there many yeeres, as in these wordes <HI>Almohadda,</HI> which signifieth a pyllow or boulster, also <HI>Almohaza,</HI> that is a horse combe: with diuers such other wordes, which they speake in maner w<SUP>t</SUP> panting brea∣stes, and vehement spirite. I haue thought it good to rehearse these thyngs, because among the Latines it oftentimes so chaun∣ceth, that only the accent or aspiration, chaungeth the significati∣on of the worde, as <HI>hora,</HI> for an houre, and <HI>ora,</HI> for the plurale number of this worde <HI>os,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the aspi∣ration chaun∣geth the signi∣fication of woords.</NOTE> whiche signifieth the mouth: also <HI>ora,</HI> whiche signifieth regions or coastes.

But let vs now returne to the discription. In the pro∣uince of <HI>Hubabo,</HI> are these regions, <HI>Xamana, Canabacoa, Cubabo,</HI> with many other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers lan∣guages in the Iland.</NOTE> the names wherof I haue not yet learned.

Lykewyse the region of <HI>Baiohagua,</HI> hath a diuers tongue. There are also o∣ther regions, as <HI>Dahabon, Cybaho,</HI> and <HI>Manababo. Cotoy</HI> is in the middle of the Iland.

Taquenazabo, Nimaca, Baiona</HI> the lesse, <HI>Cabaini, Iamaici, Mana∣baxao, Zauana, Habacoa,</HI> and <HI>Ayquiora.</HI> But let vs entreate some∣what of the particulers of the regions. In the prouince of <HI>Caiz∣cimu,</HI> within the great gulfe of the beginning, there is a great caue in a hollow rocke vnder the roote of a high moūtayne, about two furlonges from the sea, the entry of this caue is not muche vnlyke the doores of a great temple, beyng very large, and tur∣ning many wayes. <HI>Andreas Moralis</HI> the shypmaister, at the commaundement of the gouernour, attempted to search the caue with the smalest vessels. He sayeth that by certayne priuie waies many ryuers haue concourse to this caue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riuers denou∣red of caues.</NOTE> as it were a syncke or chanel. After thexperience hereof, they ceassed to marueyle whi∣ther other riuers ranne, which comming fourscore and ten miles were swalowed vp, so that they appeered no more, nor yet fell in∣to the sea by any knowen wayes. Nowe therefore they sup∣pose that ryuers swalowed vp by the hollowe places of that stony mountayne, fall into this caue. As the shypmaister entred in∣to the caue, his shyp was almost swalowed. For he sayth, that there are many whyrlepooles and rysinges or boylynges of the water, whiche make a violent conflict and horrible roryng, one encounteryng the other:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whirlepooles, and conflict of waters.</NOTE> also many huge holes and hollowe pla∣ces, so that what on the one syde with whirlpooles, and on the other syde with the boylyng of the water, his shyppe was long in maner tossed vp and downe like a ball. It greatlye repented hym that he had entred, yet knew he no way how to come foorth. He now wandred in darknesse, aswell for the obscurenesse of the caue into the which he was farre entred, as also that in it were thicke clouds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cloudes in the caue.</NOTE> engendred of the moist vapours proceeding of the conflict of the waters, which continually fal with great violence into the caue on euery syde. He compareth the noyse of these waters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cataracts of Nilus.</NOTE> to the fal of the famous ryuer <HI>Nilus</HI> from the mountains of Ethiope, they were also deafe, that one coulde not heare what an other saide. But at the length with great daunger and feare, he came foorth of the caue, as it had been out of hell. About three∣score myles distant from the cheefe citie of sainct Dominicke, there are certayne hygh mountaynes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A standing poole in the top of a high mountayne.</NOTE> vpon the toppes where∣of is a lake or standing poole inaccessible, neuer yet seene of them which came latelye to the Ilande, both by reason of the rough∣roughnesse

of the mountaynes, and also for that there is no pathe or open way to the toppes of the same. But at the length the shypmaister beyng conducted thyther by one of the kynges, ascended to the toppes of the mountaynes, and came to the poole.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fearne and bramble bu∣shes, growe on∣ly in colde regi∣ons.</NOTE> He sayth that the colde is there of some force: and in token of wynter, he founde fearne and bramble bushes, whiche two growe only in colde regions.

Many small riuers or brookes fall into it. It hath no passage out, bycause it is on euery syde enclosed with the toppes of moun∣taynes. But let vs nowe speake of an other poole, whiche may well be called a sea in the mydlande, and be compared to the Caspian or Hircanian sea in the fyrme lande of <HI>Asia,</HI> with cer∣tayne other lakes and pooles of freshe water.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Caspian and Hircanian sea.</NOTE></P>

So it is, that our men hauyng granges adioyning neere vnto the thicke woods, certaine of them repaired thither in the moneth of Sep∣tember, in the yeere .M.D.xiiii. in the meane tyme, one of these wylde men came leapyng out of the wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A wylde man runnech away with a chylde.</NOTE> &amp; approchyng some∣what towarde them with smyling countenaunce, sodeinly snat∣ched vp a chylde of theyrs, being the sonne of the owner of the grange, which he begot of a woman of the Ilande: Hee ranne away with the chylde, and made signes to our men to folowe hym: Many folowed, aswell of our men, as of the naked inha∣bitantes, but all in vayne. Thus when the pleasaunt wande∣rer perceyued that the Christians ceassed to pursue hym, hee left the chylde in a crosse way by the which the swyneheardes were accustomed to dryue the swyne to theyr pasture.

This messenger, whether it were that he was thereto constrayned through hunger, or entysed by appetite, deuoured three of the Connies by the way. He to whom they were sent, wrote to his freende in a leafe howe many he receyued. When the maister had looked a whyle on the leafe in the presence of the seruaunt, he sayde thus vnto hym, Ah sonne, where is thy fayth? Coulde thy greedie ap∣petite preuayle so muche with thee, as to cause thee to eate the Connies committed to thy fidelitie? The poore wretche trem∣blyng and greatly amased, confessed his faulte, and therewith desyred his maister to tell hym howe he knewe the trueth there∣of. This leafe (quod he) whiche thou broughtest me, hath tolde me all. Then he further rehearsed vnto hym the houre of his commyng to his frende,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignorance causeth ad∣miration.</NOTE> and lykewyse of his departyng when he retourned. And thus they meryly deceyue these seely soules, and keepe them vnder obedience: insomuche that they take our men for Goddes, at whose commaunde∣ment leaues do disclose suche thynges as they thynke most hyd and secrete.

they myght bee, I consider by one pearle the which <HI>Paulus,</HI> predicessour to your holines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A pearle for a Pope.</NOTE> bought at the second hand of a mar∣chant of Uenice for foure &amp; fourtie thousand ducates: Yet among those which were brought from this Ilād, there was one bought euen in <HI>Dariena,</HI> for a thousand &amp; two hundred Castellans of gold: this was almost as byg as a meane walnut,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An other pearle of great price.</NOTE> &amp; came at y<SUP>t</SUP> length to the handes of <HI>Petrus Arias</HI> the gouernour, who gaue it to that noble and faythfull woman his wyfe, of whose maner of depar∣ture with her husbande, we haue made mention before. We must then needes thinke that this was very precious, whiche was bought so deare among such a multitude of pearles, where they were not bought by one at once, but by poundes, and at the least by ounces. It is also to be thought that the Uenecian marchaunt bought his for no great summe of money in the East partes: But he solde it the dearer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nyse and su∣perfluous pleasures.</NOTE> for that he chaunced to lyue in those lasciui∣ous and wanton dayes, when men were giuen to such nyse and superfluous pleasures, and met with a marchant for his purpose. But let vs now speake somewhat of the shelfyshes, in the which pearles are engendred.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dyuers opini∣ons of the ge∣neration of pearles.</NOTE> It is not vnknowne to your holynesse, that Aristotle, and Plinie his folower, were of dyuers opini∣ons as concernyng the generation of pearles. But these In∣dians, and our men, rest onely in one assertion, not assentyng to them in any other: as, eyther that they wander in the sea, or, that they moue at any tyme after they are borne. They will therefore that there be certayne greene places, as it were mea∣dowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hearbes in the bottome of the sea.</NOTE> in the bottome of the sea, bringing foorth an hearbe much lyke vnto Tyme, and affyrme that they haue seene the same, and that they are engendred, noryshed, and growe therein, as wee see thincrease and succession of Oysters to grow about them selues: Also that these fyshes delyghteth not in the conuersation or com∣pany of the sea dogges, nor yet to bee contented with onely one, two, or three, or at the most foure pearles, affyrmyng that in the fyshyng places of the kyng of this Ilande, there was founde a hundred pearles in one fyshe, the whiche <HI>Cas∣par Moralis</HI> the captayne him selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A hundred pearles in one shell fyshe.</NOTE> and his companions, di∣ligently numbred: For it pleased the kyng at theyr beyng there, and in their presence, to commaunde his dyuers to goe a fyshyng for those kynde of fyshes. They compare the matri∣ces

of these fyshes, to the places of conception in Hennes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The matrice of the pearle fyshe.</NOTE> in the whiche theyr egges are engendred in great multitudes and clusters, and beleue that these fyshes bryng foorth theyr byrth in lyke maner. For the better proofe whereof, they say that they founde certayne pearles commyng foorth of their matri∣ces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The byrth of pearles.</NOTE> as beyng nowe come to the tyme of theyr full rypenesse, and moued by nature to come out of theyr moothers wombe, o∣penyng it selfe in tyme conuenient: lykewyse, that within a whyle after, they sawe other succeede in lyke maner. So that to conclude, they sawe some commyng foorth, and other some yet abydyng the tyme of theyr perfection: which beyng com∣plete, they also became loose, and opened the matrice. They perceyued the pearles to bee inclosed in the myddest of theyr bellyes, there to bee nourished and increase, as an infant sucking his moothers pappes within her wombe, before hee moue to come foorth of her priuie places. And if it chaunce any of these shelfyshes to bee founde scattered in the sande of the sea (as I my selfe haue seene Oysters disparcled on the shores in dyuers pla∣ces of the Ocean) they affyrme that they haue been violently dry∣uen thither from the bottome of the sea by force of tempestes, and not to haue wandered thither of them selues: But, that they be∣come whyte by the clearenesse of the mornyng deawe, or waxe yelowe in troubled weather, or otherwyse that they seeme to re∣ioyce in fayre weather and cleare ayre, or contrarywyse, to bee as it were astonyshed and dymme in thunder and tempestes, with suche other: the perfect knowledge hereof, is not to bee loo∣ked for at the handes of these vnlearned men, whiche handle the matter but grossely, and enquyre no further then occasion ser∣ueth.

remayning in the water: And this they say to bee the cause why the oldest (&amp; therfore byggest) sea muscles inhabite y<SUP>e</SUP> deepest pla∣ces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sea mus∣cles wherein pearles are en∣gendred.</NOTE> from whence they are not lightly moued by tempestes. Fur∣thermore, how much the bygger &amp; older these fyshes are, they say that in their larger matrices, the greater number &amp; bigger pear∣les are founde, &amp; that for this cause there are fewer founde of the byggest sort. They thinke also, that when they first fall from their fyshes in the deepe places, they are deuoured of other fyshes, by∣cause they are not yet hearde. Againe, the smallest differ from the byggest in a certaine swelling or impostumation, which y<SUP>e</SUP> Spa∣niardes call a tympany: For they deny that to be a pearle which in olde muscles cleaueth faste to the shell, but that it is a wart, which being rased from the shell with a fyle, is rounde &amp; bryght but onely of one syde, and not precious, being rather of the nature of the fyshe it selfe, then of a pearle. They confesse that they haue seene certayne of these muscles cleauyng on rockes, yet these but fewe, and nothyng woorth. It is also to bee thought, that the pearle fyshes or sea muscles which are founde in India, Ara∣bia, the redde sea, or Taprobana, are ruled in suche order as the aforenamed famous aucthours haue written: For their opini∣on herein is not vtterly to bee reiected, forasmuch as they were learned men, and trauayled long in the searchyng of these thin∣ges. But wee haue nowe spoken sufficiently of these sea fyshes, and of their egges, which the fonde nysenesse and wantonnesse of men haue made deerer then the egges of hennes or geese. Let vs therefore entreate somewhat of other perticular thinges, which are come to our knowledge of late. Wee haue elswhere largely described the mouthes of the gulfe of <HI>Vraba,</HI> with sundry and variable regions diuided with the manifolde gulfes of that sea: But as concernyng the West coastes, in the which our men haue buylded houses, and planted their habitations on the bankes of <HI>Dariena,</HI> I haue no newe matter to wryte.

But they beyng stricken with feare through this example, durst not come foorth of their shyppes, or deuise how to reuenge the death of theyr Captayne and companyons. They departed therefore from these vnfortunate coastes, and by the way ladyng theyr shyppe with brasell, returned home agayne with losse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brasyle.</NOTE> and heauie cheare. Of these thynges I was aduertised of late by theyr owne letters. What they haue els doone, I shall haue more perticular knowledge heereafter. <HI>Iohannes Pontius</HI> was al∣so repulsed by the Canibales in the Iland of <HI>Guadalupea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohannes Pontius is re∣pulsed by the Canibales.</NOTE> beyng one of the chiefe Ilandes of theyr habitation. For when they sawe our men a farre of on the sea, they lay in ambushe, sodenly to inuade them when they shoulde come alande. Our men sent foorth a fewe foote men, and with them theyr Laundresses to washe theyr shertes and sheetes: For from the Iland of <HI>Ferrea,</HI> beyng one of the Ilandes of Canarie (euen vnto this Iland, for the space of foure thousand and two hundred myles) they had seene no land, where they myght fynde any fresh water, foras∣muche as in all this large space the Ocean is without Ilandes. At theyr commyng therefore to lande, the Canibales assayled them, caried away the women, and put the men to suche distresse, that fewe of them escaped. By reason whereof, <HI>Pontius</HI> beyng greatly discomfited, durst not inuade the Cani∣bales, fearyng theyr venomed arrowes, which these naked man∣hunters can direct most certaynely. Thus good <HI>Pontius</HI> fayling of his purpose, was fayne to geue ouer the Canibales, whom (being safe &amp; vnder the house roofe) he threatned to vanquish and destroy.

Beholde nowe a wonderfull thyng,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The South sea.</NOTE> that in a lande of suche marueylous longitude in other places, they founde it here to be onely about fyftie myles distant to the South sea: for they count it .xvii. leagues, as the maner of the Spanyardes is to recken, and not by myles: Yet saye they that a league consysteth of three myles by lande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A league con∣tayneth foure myles by sea and but three by lande.</NOTE> and foure by sea, as we haue noted before.

They spoyled all the countrey neare about his pa∣lace: yet had they but litle golde, for he had caryed all his stuffe with hym.

other kynde of foulyng, heeretofore neuer hearde of, and pleasant to consider.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A straunge kynde of fou∣lyng.</NOTE> Wee haue declared before howe that in certayne of the Ilandes, and especially in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> there are dyuers lakes or standyng pooles: In some of these (being no deeper then men may wade ouer them) are seene great multitudes of wa∣ter foules: as well for that in the bottome of these lakes there growe many hearbes and weedes, as also that by reason of the heate of the Sunne, pearsyng to the naturall place of genera∣tion and conception, where being doubled in force by reflection, and preserued by moyster there, are engendred of the slyminesse of the earth and water, and by the prouidence of the vniuersall creator, innumerable little fyshes, with a thousand sundry kyndes of frogges, wormes, gnattes, flyes, and such other. The foules which vse these lakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fyshes and worms engen∣dred of slyme. Foules.</NOTE> are of dyuers kyndes: as Duckes, Geese, Swannes, sea Newes, Gulles, and such other.

I haue heere for this cause entred into the declaration of theyr maner of huntyng and foulyng, that by these more pleasaunt narrati∣ons, I may somewhat mittigate and asswage the horrour con∣ceyued in your stomake by the former rehearsal of theyr blooddy actes and cruell maners. Let vs nowe therefore speake some∣what agayne of the newe and later opinions, as concernyng the swyft course of the sea towarde the West about the coastes of <HI>Paria,</HI> also of the maner of geatheryng of golde in the golde myne of <HI>Dariena,</HI> as I was aduertised of late: and with these two quiet and peaceable thinges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Later opinions of the swyft course of the Ocean toward the West.</NOTE> we will make an ende of the tragicall affayres of the Ocean, and therewith byd your holy∣nesse farewell. So it is therfore, that <HI>Andreas Moralis</HI> the pilot, and <HI>Ouiedus</HI> (of whom wee haue made mention before) repay∣red to mee, at my house in the towne of Matrite. As we met thus togeather, there arose a contention betweene them two, as concernyng this course of the Ocean. They both agree, that these landes and regions parteynyng to the dominion of Castile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The continent or fyrme lande.</NOTE> doe with one continual tract &amp; perpetual bond, embrase as one whole firme lande or continent, all the mayne lande lying on the North side of <HI>Cuba,</HI> &amp; the other Ilands, being also Northwest both from <HI>Cuba</HI> &amp; <HI>Hispaniola:</HI> Yet as touching the course of the water, they varry in opinion. For <HI>Andreas</HI> wil that this violent course of wa∣ter be receiued in the lappe of the supposed continent, which ben∣deth so much, and extendeth so farre towarde the North, as wee haue sayde: and that by the obiect or resistance of the lande, so bending and crookyng, the water should as it were rebounde in compasse, and by force thereof bee driuen about the North syde of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and the other Ilands, excluded without y<SUP>e</SUP> circle cal∣led <HI>Tropicus Cancri,</HI> where the largenes of y<SUP>e</SUP> sea may receiue the waters falling from the narow streames, &amp; therby represse that inordinate course, by reason that the sea is there very large and great. I can compare his meanyng to nothing more aptely, then to the swyft streame commyng foorth of a myll, and fallyng into the myll poole: For in all such places where waters runne with a violent fall through narowe chanelles, and are then receyued in large pooles, they are sodeynly disparcled, and theyr violence broken: So that whereas before they seemed of suche force as

to ouerthrowe all thinges beyng in theyr way, it can not then be perceyued which way they runne. The Admirall him selfe <HI>Diegus Colonus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The vyages of Diegus Colonus.</NOTE> sonne and heyre to <HI>Christiphorus Colonus,</HI> the fyrst fynder of these landes (who had nowe in commyng and go∣ing, foure tymes passed through these seas) being demaunded of me what he founde or perceyued in saylyng too and fro: answe∣red, that there was muche difficultie in returnyng the same way by the which they goe. But whereas they fyrst take the way by the mayne sea towarde the North, before they directe theyr course to Spayne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The viage from the new lands to Spain</NOTE> he sayth that in that tract hee felt the shyppe sometymes a lyttle dryuen backe by the contrary course of the water: Yet supposeth that this chaunceth onely by the ordinary flowyng and reflowyng of the sea, and the same not to bee enfor∣ced by the circumflection or course of the water, reboundyng in compasse as wee haue sayde: But thinketh rather, that this mayne lande or supposed continent, should somewhere bee o∣pen: and that the sayde open place, should bee as it were a gate, entrie, or streyght, diuyding the North partes of that lande from the South, by the which also the Ocean runnyng towarde the West, may by the rotation or impulsion of the heauens, bee dryuen about the whole earth. <HI>Ouiedus</HI> agreeth with <HI>Andreas Moralis</HI> as touchyng the continuall adherence and closenesse of the sayde continent: Yet neyther that the waters should so beate agaynst the bendyng backe of the West lande, or bee in such sort repulsed and driuen into the mayne sea: But sayth, that he hath diligently considered, that the waters runne from the deepest and myddest of the mayne sea, towarde the West: Also, that saylyng neere vnto the shore with small vessels, hee founde the same wa∣ters to returne againe towarde the East, so that in the same place they runne togeather with contrary course, as we oftentymes see the lyke to chaunce in ryuers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The contrary course of wa∣ters.</NOTE> where by the obiect of the bankes, dyuers whirlepooles and turnynges aryse in the water.

Therefore to all suche as are wyllyng to geather golde, there is of ordinarie custome appointed to euery man by the suruoy∣ers of the mynes, a square plotte of grounde, conteynyng twelue pases, at the arbitrement of the chooser, so that it be not grounde alredy occupyed, or left of other. The portion of grounde be∣ing thus chosen (as it were assigned of the augures to buylde a temple) they inclose their slaues within the same, whose helpe the Christians vse in tyllyng of their grounde, and geatheryng of golde, as we haue sayde. These places appointed vnto them, they keepe as long as them lyst: and if they perceyue tokens of little golde, they requyre an other plot of grounde of twelue pa∣ses to be assigned them, leauyng the first in common:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our inclosers would leaue no such commens</NOTE> And this is thorder which the Spaniardes inhabiting <HI>Dariena</HI> obserue in geatheryng of golde.

It hath been prooued, that these twelue pases of grounde, haue yelded to their choosers the summe of fourescore Castellanes of golde.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Auri sacra Fa∣mes.</HI></NOTE> And thus leade they theyr lyues in fulfillyng the holy hun∣ger of golde.

At the spryng of the day, the Bar∣barians approched to our mens campe, and called for the inter∣pretours of <HI>Cuba,</HI> whose language is much agreable vnto theirs.

They cut not theyr throtes, but open the very brestes of these seelye soules, and take out theyr hartes yet pantyng, with the hot blood whereof, they annoynt the lippes of theyr Idoles, and suffer the resydue to fall into the syncke: This doone, they burne the harte and bowels, sup∣posyng the smoke thereof to be acceptable to theyr goddes. Of theyr Idoles, one is made to the shape of a man, bowyng downe his head, and lookyng towarde the syncke of blood, as it were acceptyng the offeryng of the slayne sacrifyce. They eate the fleshe of the armes, thyghes, and legges, especially when they sacrifice an enimie taken in the warres. They founde a streame of coniealed blood, as though it had runne from a boo∣chery. For this mischeuous purpose, they bring these wretches from the next Ilandes.

The Barbarians both men and wo∣men fought very fiercely, aswell to recouer their libertie, as also to holde fast the praye which they had gotten: But in fine, the Spanyardes had the vpper hande, by reason they were more ex∣perte in handlyng of theyr weapons, &amp; rulyng of their Carauell. The Barbarians beyng thus ouercome, leapt into the sea, but the Spanyardes tooke them agayne with the shyppe boates.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Barbari∣ans are slayne and put to flyght.</NOTE> About a hundred of the Barbarians perished, being partly drow∣ned, and partely slayne with the swoorde, and but fewe of the Spanyardes. These thinges thus pacified, the resydue of the Barbarians were caryed to the towne of <HI>Sanctiago,</HI> and condem∣ned to labour in the golde mynes. Shortly after they made out a newe viage to an other of the Ilandes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A multitude of Ilandes.</NOTE> which lye there about so thicke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Archipelagus▪</HI></NOTE> that they commonly call the number of them <HI>Archipe∣lagus,</HI> as they in our sea of <HI>Ionicum</HI> are called <HI>Symplegades.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An other viage</NOTE> Here our men were cruelly handled, and as many of them as came a∣lande eyther slayne or wounded.

also that in this tracte they sawe .xxvi. Ilandes, which <HI>Colonus</HI> had ouerpassed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">xxvi.

It is a marueylous thyng to see what maner of rasers they haue, made of certayne yelowe stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rasers of stone.</NOTE> cleare and transparent lyke vnto chri∣stall, with these they shaue and carue, as though they were made of fyne steele: When the edges are blunt with long exercyse, they sharpen them not with a whetstone, or powder, or any other stone, but temper them onely with water. They haue also a thou∣sande kyndes of instrumentes or tooles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Instruments and tooles.</NOTE> and such other thinges of fyne deuice, which were to long to rehearse.

Therefore, after that it was knowen to our men of howe great moment these tractes were, the Spaniards which inhabited the Ilande of <HI>Cuba, Annunstus</HI> being the gouernour of the Ilande, furnished a new nauie of ten Carauelles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An other vyage of ten Cara∣uels and fyue hundred men.</NOTE> and fyue hundred men, with two small brigantines, as it were in the steade of lyght horsemen, or forerunners, whose ayde they myght vse as scoutes, to search the wayes for daunger of rockes and shalow sandes or shelfes. They shipte also certayne horses as fyue stoned horses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horses and mares.</NOTE> and .xxvi. mares, apt for the warres.

At the commyng of our men, thinhabitauntes fledde to the thicke woods, and forsooke theyr townes for feare: Our men entred into theyr houses, where they founde plentie of vittayles, and many ornamentes parteynyng to the furnyshyng of theyr hou∣ses, as hanginges and carpettes of dyuers colours, sheetes also of gossampine cotton (whiche they call <HI>Amaccas</HI>) and muche apparell. They haue furthermore innumerable bookes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Carpettes and sheetes.</P>
<P>Innumerable bookes.</P></NOTE> of the which with many other thinges sent to our newe Empe∣rour, wee will speake more largely heereafter. The souldiers wandered about the Ilande, and viewed all thinges diligently, keepyng them selues styll in battayle raye, least they myght bee sodeinly inuaded. They founde but a fewe of thinhabitauntes, and onely one woman in theyr company. By thinterpretours of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and other which the Spaniardes tooke first from <HI>Iucatana,</HI> they perswaded the woman to call the kynges that were absent. They came gladly, and made a league of friendshyp with our men, whereby they were restored to theyr houses, and a great parte of their stuffe. They are circumcised Idolatours, and sacri∣fyce children of both kyndes to their <HI>Zemes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Circumcised Idolaters.</NOTE> which are the Ima∣ges of their familiar and domesticall spirites, whiche they ho∣nour as goddes. When I enquired of <HI>Alaminus</HI> the pilot, also of <HI>Francis Montegius,</HI> and <HI>Portucarerius,</HI> from whence they had the children they offered in sacrifyce: they answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They Sacri∣fyce Children.</NOTE> that they bought them in the Ilandes thereabout, by exchaunge for golde and other of their trafycke: For in all this so large a space of land, the deuilyshe anxietie for the desyre of wicked money, hath not yet oppressed thinhabitauntes.

to eate, they gelde while they are whelpes, whereby they waxe very fat in the space of foure monethes. They reserue all the byt∣ches for increase, and but fewe dogges. Our men diswaded them from these superstitions, declaryng howe they were abhomina∣ble,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are soone perswaded to our religion.</NOTE> and detested of God. They were soone perswaded, and de∣syred a lawe which they myght folowe. Our men therfore decla∣red vnto them, that there was onely one God, which made hea∣uen and earth, the giuer of all good thinges, beyng of one in∣comprehensyble substaunce, vnder triplicitie of person. Assoone as they heard these wordes, they broke their <HI>Zemes,</HI> and pared, scraped, and washed the pauements and walles of their temples. Our men gaue them a paynted picture of the blessed virgine, which they placed reuerently in their temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This people leauing one kynde of Ido∣latry be taught another.</NOTE> &amp; about it a crosse, to be honoured in the remembraunce of God and man, and the saluation of mankynde. They erected also an other great crosse of wood in the toppe of the temple, whyther they oftentymes resorte togeather to honour the Image of the virgine. Thin∣habitauntes signifyed by thinterpretours, that in the Ilande of <HI>Iucatana,</HI> not farre from them, there were seuen Christians cap∣tiues, which in tyme past were driuen thither by tempest. The I∣lande of <HI>Cozumella,</HI> is onely fyue myles distant from <HI>Iucatana.</HI> The gouernour <HI>Cortesius</HI> being aduertised hereof, furnished two Carauels with fiftie men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An other viage</NOTE> willing them incōtinent to direct their viage thither, &amp; to make search for these mē. They tooke w<SUP>t</SUP> them iii. interpretors of <HI>Cozumella</HI> (whose lāguage agreeth w<SUP>t</SUP> theirs) with letters to the Christians if any might be founde. He further declared vnto them, howe goodly a matter they should bryng to passe, if they coulde bryng away any of them: For hee no wayes doubted but that by their information, he should be fully certified of the commodities of all those tractes, &amp; the maners of thinhabi∣tauntes. Thus they departed, with commaundement to returne within the space of six dayes. But when they had remayned there now .viii. dayes, &amp; heard no word of their Cozumellane interpre∣tours, whom they had sent alande with the message and letters, our men returned to <HI>Cozumella</HI> without them, suspectyng that they were either slaine, or deteyned.

<PB N="164" REF="174"/>
the west a Canoa commyng from <HI>Iucatana,</HI> and in it one of the Christian captiues (named <HI>Hieronimus Aquillaris</HI>) who had ly∣ued seuen yeeres in that Ilande:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquillaris .vii. yeeres captiue in the Ilande of Iucatana.</NOTE> With what ioye they embrased the one the other, the chaunce may declare. They were no lesse desyrous to heare, then he to tell of the mysfortune which befell to him and his companions. And heere it shall not bee greatly from my purpose, briefely to rehearse howe the thing chaunced. In my Decades I haue made mention of a certayne noble man named <HI>Valdiuia,</HI> whom the Spanyardes which inhabited <HI>Darie∣na</HI> in the supposed continent of the gulf of <HI>Vraba,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Valdiuia.</HI></NOTE> sent to the Iland of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> to <HI>Colonus</HI> the Admirall and viceroy, with the resi∣due of the Senate and counsaile there (to whom parteyneth the redresse and orderyng of all thinges in these new landes) to sig∣nifie vnto them in what extreme necessitie and penurie they ly∣ued. Unhappy <HI>Valdiuia</HI> therefore, takyng this matter in hande in an euyll houre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The shipwrack of Valdiuia.</NOTE> was with a sodeine and violent whirle wynde dryuen vppon certayne quickesandes, in the prospecte of the I∣lande of <HI>Iamaica,</HI> lying on the South syde of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> and <HI>Cu∣ba.</HI> These blynde and swalowyng sandes, the Spaniardes call vypers, and that by good reason, bycause in them many shyppes are entangled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The quicke sandes called vypers.</NOTE> as the Lisertes are implycate in the tayles of the vypers. While the Carauell thus wresteled with the water, it was so burst in sunder, that <HI>Valdiuia</HI> with thirtie of his felowes could scarcely with much difficultie discende into the shyp boate: where without ores, and without sayles, they were caryed away by the violence of the water. For (as we haue sayd before in our Decades) the seas doe runne there continually with a violent course toward the West. They wandered thus .xiii. dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The course of the sea toward the West.</NOTE> not knowing whither they went, nor yet fyndyng any thing to eate. Famine consumed seuen of them, which were cast into the sea to feede the fyshes. The residue lykewyse, in maner consumed by famyne, and fallyng from one calamitie into an other, were dry∣uen to <HI>Iucatana,</HI> and fell into the handes of a cruell kyng, who slue <HI>Valdiuia</HI> the gouernour, with certayne of his felowes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Valdiuia is sacrificed to Idoles.</NOTE> and when he had fyrst sacrifyced them to his <HI>Zemes,</HI> shortly after hee ate them, with his friendes of that conspiracie. For they eate onely their enemies &amp; straungers, &amp; doe otherwise absteyne from mans fleshe. In this meane tyme, while <HI>Hieronimus Aquillaris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Aquilla∣ris escaped.</NOTE>
<PB REF="175"/>
with syxe of his felowes, were reserued to be sacrifyced the thyrde day, they brake theyr bandes, escaped the handes of that cruell Tyrant, and fledde to an other kyng beyng his enimy, who re∣ceyued them, yet onely as bondmen. It is a straunge thyng to heare of the moother of this <HI>Aquillaris:</HI> For as soone as shee hearde that her sonne was fallen into the handes of the na∣tions that eate mans fleshe, shee fell madde incontinent: so that whensoeuer after, shee sawe any meate roastyng at the fyre, or onely redy spytted to laye to the fyre, shee ceassed not to crye out in this maner, O mee most wretched moother, be∣holde the members of my sonne. But to returne to our purpose. When <HI>Aquillaris</HI> had now receyued the gouernours letter, sent by the Cozumellane messengers, hee declared to the kyng his maister (whose name was <HI>Taxmarus</HI>) what was theyr errande thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kyng Tax∣marus.</NOTE> and wherefore they were sent: vsyng in the meane tyme many large discourses, in expressyng the great power and mag∣nificence of theyr kyng, who had of late arryued in those coastes: also of theyr humanitie and gentlenesse towarde theyr friendes and such as submitted them selues to them, &amp; againe their rigour and fiercenesse agaynst suche as stubbernly eyther contemned them, or denyed their requestes. With these wordes he brought <HI>Taxmarus</HI> into such feare, that the maister was now fayne to de∣syre his seruaunt so to handle the matter, that they myght quietly enter into his dominion as his friendes, and not as his enemies. <HI>Aquillaris</HI> promised in their behalfe y<SUP>t</SUP> they should not onely come in peace, but also to ayde him against his enemies if neede should so require. Whervppon he dismissed <HI>Aquillaris,</HI> &amp; with him three of his familiers and companions. Thus they sayled togeather from <HI>Cozumella</HI> to <HI>Iucatana,</HI> to the ryuer which they had founde before in the fyrst viage thither, by the gouernance of <HI>Alaminus</HI> the pilot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mouth of a ryuer stopped with sande.</NOTE> They founde the mouth of the ryuer stopped with sand, as we reade of the ryuer of <HI>Nilus</HI> in Egypte, when the wyndes (called <HI>Etesti</HI>) blow in summer, and especially in the canicular dayes. Therefore where as they could not enter into the ryuer with the biggest vesselles (although it be otherwyse apte to re∣ceyue great shyppes) the gouernour caused two hundred men to bee set alande with the Brigantines and shyppe boates, wyl∣lyng <HI>Aquillaris</HI> to offer peace to thinhabitauntes. They de∣maunded
<PB N="165" REF="175"/>
what our men requyred. <HI>Aquillaris</HI> aunsweared, vit∣tayles. There was a longe space of sande by the syde of the towne, whyther they wylled them to resort, promysyng to bryng them vittayles thyther the day folowyng. Our men went, and they came, accordyng to theyr promisse, and brought with them eyght of theyr Hennes, beyng as bygge as Peacockes, of brownyshe coloure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turky Hens.</NOTE> and not inferiour to Pea∣cockes in pleasaunt tast. They brought also as muche bread made of <HI>Maizium</HI> (whiche is a grayne not muche vnlyke vnto panyke) as woulde scarcely serue tenne hungry men, and here∣with desyred them to depart. But when they perceyued that our men made no hast away, immediately there came a great company of armed men towarde them, demaundyng what they had to do thus to wander in other mens landes. Our men made answeare by <HI>Aquillaris,</HI> that they desyred peace, vittayles, and golde, for exchange of other thynges. They answeared againe, that they woulde nother peace nor warre with them, but threatned them to auoyde the land, except they would be destroy∣ed euery man. Our men sayd that they woulde not depart, without sufficient vittayles to mayntayne their souldyers. They appoynted the day folowyng to bryng them more vittayles, but they broke promise: Yet perceyuing the seconde day that our men were encamped on the sande, and had reposed there that nyght, they brought them as much more vittayles, and com∣maunded them in the name of theyr kyng to departe. Our men sayde that they were desyrous to see the towne, and to haue yet more store of vittayles. The Barbarians denyed theyr request, and therewith departed, whisperyng and mutteryng among them selues. In the meane tyme our men were styll so oppressed with hunger, that they were enforced to seeke for meate. The gouernour therefore sent his vnder captaynes to lande with a hundred and fyftie men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A conflicte.</NOTE> As they went dispersed in dyuers com∣panyes about the villages of the countrey, the Barbarians met with one of theyr bandes, and put them to great distresse: But when theyr felowes, being not farre from them, hearde the noyse of theyr alarome, they came with al possible haste to theyr rescue. The gouernour on the other syde, placing his ordinaunce in the brygantines &amp; shippe boates, approched to the shorre, with
<PB REF="176"/>
the resydue of his souldiers. The Barbarians lykewyse, beyng redy furnyshed to the battayle, came runnyng to the sea syde, to disturbe them, that they shoulde not come alande, and with theyr arrowes wounded many a farre of vnprepared. The gouernoure discharged about .xx. peeces of ordinaunce agaynst them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Barbari∣ans ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> put to flyght.</NOTE> With the slaughter and terrible thunder wher∣of, and with the flame of the fyre, and smell of the brimstone, they were so astonied, and put to such feare, that they fled and dis∣parcled lyke wylde beastes: whom our men pursuing, entred in∣to the towne, which thinhabitantes forsoke in maner for feare of their owne men, whō they sawe so dismaide. On the banke of this ryuer there is a towne of such portentous biggnes as I dare not speake, but <HI>Alanimus</HI> the pilot, sayth that it contayneth in circuite fyue hundred myles, and that it consisteth of .xxv. thou∣sande houses:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great towne of Po∣tanchana or Victoria. A towne of xxv. thousande houses.</NOTE> Some make it somwhat lesse, but they all agree that it is exceedyng great and notable. The houses are diuided with gardens, and are buylded of lyme and stone, very artificiall, and of cunnyng woorkemanship. To theyr haules, chambers, parlers, or other places of habitation, they ascend by tenne or twelue stayres, and haue certayne spaces betwene euery house: so that it is not lawfull for any to lade his neygh∣bours wales with rafters or beames. Theyr houses are sepa∣rate one from an other by the space of three houses, and are for the most parte couered with reede and thatche, and many al∣so with slate or other stone. The Barbarians them selues con∣fessed that they were that day fourtie thousande men at the bat∣tayle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gunnes and horses.</NOTE> which were vanquished of a fewe, by reason of the newe and vnknowen kynde of feyght with gunnes and horses. For the gouernour had vnbarked .xvi. horses, which were also at the bat∣tayle, and so fyercely assayled the Barbarians on the backehalfe, that they brake theyr array, and scattered them as it had ben flockes of sheepe, ouerthrowing, woūding, &amp; killing them on eue∣ry syde: Which thing the seely wretches so imputed to a miracle, that they had not y<SUP>e</SUP> power to occupie their weapones.

<PB N="166" REF="176"/>
whyle the owners of the houses lay vnder the fyrmament, and durst not assayle our men, who had placed them selues in the stroungest part of the towne, where some kept contynual watch (lest the Barbarians shoulde sodenly inuade them) whyle other gaue them selues to rest and sleepe. The inhabitauntes call this towne <HI>Potanchana:</HI> but our men for the victorie which they obteyned here, named it <HI>Victoria.</HI> It is a marueilous thyng to consider, the greatnesse, magnificence, &amp; finenesse of the building of certayne palaces they haue in the countrey, to the which they resort somtymes for theyr solace and pastyme.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palaces of maruelous bygnes and well buylded.</NOTE> These are curi∣ously builded with many pleasaunt diuises, as galeries, solars turrettes, portals, gutters, with chambers boorded after the maner of our waynescot, and well floored. Foure of our Spa∣niardes went into one of them, of such greatnesse, that they wan∣dred in the same for the space of foure houres before they coulde fynde the way out. At the length by the interpretours, and cer∣tayne captiues, our men sent for the kyng, and suche rulers as were next vnder hym in aucthoritie, wyllyng them to submyt them selues, and to come into the towne vnarmed: geuyng the messengers further in commaundement, to certifie them that in theyr so doyng, they woulde commune with them as concerning conditions of peace, and restore them theyr towne. They came gladly, and entred euery man into his owne house, vpon conditi∣on, that they shoulde euer thereafter absteyne from such ceremo∣nies and horrible sacrifices of mans fleshe, to deuils, the mortal e∣nemies to mankinde, whose Images they honoured, &amp; to direct the eyes of theyr myndes to Christ our God, y<SUP>e</SUP> maker of heauen and earth, who was borne into this worlde of a virgin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They receyue our religion.</NOTE> and suf∣fred death on the crosse for the redemption of mankynde, and fi∣nally to professe them selues subiectes to the Christian kyng of Spayne. They promised both, and were instructed as farre as the shortnesse of tyme woulde permit. Beyng thus restored, they recompensed our men with many rewardes, supposyng suche men to be sent from heauen, whiche beyng so fewe in num∣ber, durst attempt battayle agaynst so great a multitude. They gaue our men also certayne golde, and twentie slaues. Depar∣tyng therefore from hence, and coasting styll along by the same shore, they came agayne to the gulfe whiche <HI>Alaminus</HI> the

They profered our men halfe the towne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A towne of a thousand and fyue hundred houses.</NOTE> if they would dwel with them for euer.

For (as I haue sayde before) they destroy one an other with contynuall warre, for the desire to enlarge theyr dominions. Our men refused par∣petuall habitation, and accepted theyr frendly proffer for a tyme. As they came alande, the people folowed them on euerye syde with bowes in theyr handes, whiche they helde ouer our mens heades, to defend them from the rayne, as though they had wal∣ked in a continuall arbour.

Un∣to this gulfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the sea runneth swyft∣ly from the East to the West.</NOTE> the course of the water was gentle enough and mo∣derate: but when they had sailed a litle further toward the West, they founde the sea running with so swift a course, as if it were a great riuer fallyng from the toppes of hygh mountaynes, inso∣much that in a short space of tyme it caried them fiftie myles from theyr felowes.

For theyr generall gouernoure, they elected <HI>Cortesius</HI> the gouer∣nour of the nauie, agaynst his wyll as some saye. For other ma∣gistrates to gouerne the citie which they intended to builde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Cortesius hath written a booke of these thynges.</NOTE> he chose <HI>Portucarerius</HI> and <HI>Montegius,</HI> of whom we haue made men∣tion before: They chose also certayne messengers to send to the kyng by the conduction of <HI>Alaminus</HI> the pilot: Furthermore, foure of the princes of this prouince, offered them selues wyllyngly to go with our men into Spayne, to thintent to see our landes, and that kyng whose power is so great, and whose auctoritie reach∣eth so farre: They brought lykewyse two women with them, whiche serued and obeyed them in all thinges, after the maner of their countrey. The people of this nation is of browne or yelow∣yshe colour. Both the men and the women haue pendauntes of gold &amp; pretious stones hanging at their eares: The men also bore theyr neather lippes full of holes, from the vppermost part of the lippe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They weare rynges and plates at theyr lyppes.</NOTE> euen vnto the neathermost part of the gumme. At these they hang certayne rynges, and plates of golde and syl∣uer, fastned to a smal and thynne plate, lying within betwene the lip &amp; the gumme. At the biggest hole in the middest of the lippe, there hangeth a rounde plate of syluer, as brode as the coyne called a Carolyne, &amp; as thicke as a mans finger.

They that are powled, thynke that more decent then to weare a bushe, and they that weare beardes, iudge it a deformitie to be shauen.

<P>Theyr bookes.</P></NOTE> whereof they make such Mases and Hammers as are vsed in the warres, dygging Mat∣tockes also, and Spades: for they haue neyther Iron nor steele. But let vs nowe speake of the presentes sent into Spayne to the kyng: and fyrst of the bookes. These procuratours therefore of the newe colonie of the prouince of <HI>Coluacana,</HI> among other their presentes, brought also a great number of bookes, the leaues whereof are made of the inner ryndes or barkes of trees, thinner then eyther that of the Elme or of y<SUP>e</SUP> Salowe: these they smeere or anoynt with the pitche of molten <HI>Bitumem,</HI> and whyle they be soft, extend them to what fourme them lysteth: When they bee cold and harde, they rubbe them ouer with a certayne playster. It is to be thought, that they beate the playster into fyne floure, and so temperyng it with some byndyng moysture, to make a crust therewith vppon the leaues, whereon they wryte with anye sharpe instrument, and blot the same agayne with a spunge or some suche other thyng, as marchaunt men and noble mens stewards are accustomed to do with their wryting tables made of the woodde of figge trees. The leaues of theyr bookes are not set in order after the maner of ours, but are extended many cu∣bittes in length. The matters whiche they write, are con∣teyned in square tables, not lose, but so bound togeather with the tough &amp; flexible clay called <HI>Bitumem,</HI> that they seeme lyke woodden tables whiche had been vnder the handes of cun∣nyng Bookbynders. Which way so euer the booke lieth open, there are two leaues seene, and two sydes wrytten, with as ma∣ny lying vnder them, except the booke be vnfoulded in length, For vnder one leafe there are many leaues ioyned togeather. The fourmes of theyr letters are nothyng lyke vnto ours, but are muche more crooked and entangled, lyke vnto fyshhookes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theyr letters.</NOTE> knottes, snares, starres, fyles, dyse, and suche other, muche lyke vnto the Egyptian letters, and wrytten in lines lyke vnto ours.

of histories in pictures, that men may therby be the more allu∣red to bye suche bookes. The coueringes of theyr bookes are al∣so artificially wrought, and paynted. When they are shut, they seeme to differ nothing from ours in fourme. In these bookes are furthermore comprehended theyr lawes, rytes of ceremonies and sacrifyces, annotations of Astronomie, accomptes, compu∣tations of tymes, with the maner of graffyng, sowing, and other thynges parteynyng to husbandry. They begyn the yeere from the goyng downe of the seauen starres, called <HI>Vergiliae,</HI> or <HI>Ple∣iades,</HI> and count theyr monethes accordyng to the mones. They name a moneth, <HI>Tona,</HI> of the Moone, for in theyr language they call the Moone <HI>Tona.</HI> They recken the dayes by the sonnes: therefore as many dayes as they name, they saye, so manye sonnes, the Sonne in theyr tongue, is called <HI>Tonatico.</HI> They distribute the yeere (without any reason why) into twentie mo∣nethes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temples richely adour∣ned.</NOTE> and the moneth into as many dayes. The temples whiche they frequent, they adourne with golden hangynges, and other ornamentes of golde and syluer, with precious stones intermyxt.

Our men perceyuyng his earnestnesse heerein, thought it best to choose the least euyll, perceyuyng that it was yet no tyme to disquiet theyr myndes, and therefore suffered them to exercyse their accustomed ceremonies. And although theyr priestes promise them immortall glorie, eternall felicitie, and perpe∣tuall conuersation with the goddes after the stormie dayes of this lyfe, yet doe they with heauy countenaunces giue eare to their promises, and had rather bee set at libertie.

<P>Two Images of golde and siluer.</P></NOTE> Let vs nowe therefore come to the other presentes whiche were brought to the kyng. Among these, there were two broade and rounde plates (whiche some haue named the Images of the Sunne and Moone) the one of siluer, and the other of golde,

in largenesse and roundnesse muche lyke to the stones of hande∣mylles: yet but thynne, and in maner both of one circumference, that is .xxviii. spannes in circuite. That of golde is of the weyght of three thousande and viii. hundred Castellanes, where as we haue sayd before y<SUP>t</SUP> a Castellane is a coyne of golde which weygheth more then a Ducate by a trient, that is, the thyrde parte of a pounde. In the center of this, was the Image of a kyng of halfe a cubite long, syttyng in a trone, and apparel∣led to the knee lyke vnto a mawmet, with suche countenaunce as our paynters are wont to paynte fayries or sprites: about the Image, were the shapes of trees and floures, so that it seemed to sitte as though it had been in a feelde. The other of syluer, was made to the same similitude, beyng also in maner of the same weyght, and both of pure mettall. They brought lykewyse certayne graynes of rude golde (that is, suche as was neuer mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten) about the bygnesse of Fytches, or the pulse called Lintels, in token of plentie of natiue golde: Also two cheynes of golde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two cheynes of golde mar∣ueylously beset with precious stones and iewelles.</NOTE> whereof the one conteyned .viii. lynkes, in the which were set two hundred, threescore, and two fayre and cleare redde stones, and yet no rubies, furthermore a hundred fourescore and three greene stones, and yet no emerodes: Ne∣uerthelesse, these are in lyke estimation with them, as the other are with vs. At the edge of this cheyne, there hang .xxvii. gol∣den belles, hauyng betweene euery of them foure iewels of pre∣cious stones inclosed in golde, at euery of the which in lyke ma∣ner hang certayne spangles of golde.

They vse also many dartes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dartes.</NOTE> which in the tyme of the battayle they hurle so thicke a farre of, that they take the lyght of the sunne from theyr enemies as it were with a cloude.

Of this mynde and opinion was Plinie, who better then any other aucthor hath written in .xxxvii. bookes all that parteyneth to the naturall historie, conteyned all in one volume, dedicated to <HI>Vespasian</HI> Themperour: Wherin, as a prudent historiographer, he declareth such thinges as hee had heard, attributing the second authoritie to such as he had redde in aucthours that wrote before him: And thyrdly ioyned to the same hystorie, such thinges as he him selfe had seene, as most certayne testimonie.

trust whyle the rest of my lyfe yet remayneth, to serue your ma∣iestie, as shall please you to commaunde. As touchyng whiche thinges, and suche other lyke, I haue more largely written in an hystorie begun assoone as my age was rype to take such matters in hande: Wherein furthermore I haue made mention of suche thinges as haue chaunced in Spayne, from the yeere .1494. vn∣to this tyme: addyng also therevnto suche thinges woorthy me∣morie, as I haue obserued in other realmes and prouinces where I haue trauayled, and haue lykewyse particulerly wrytten the lyues and worthy actes of the catholyke Princes of famous me∣morie <HI>Don Ferdinando,</HI> and Lady Elizabeth his wyfe, to theyr last dayes.

But forasmuch as that volume remayneth in the citie of <HI>San.

this <HI>India,</HI> discouered the same in the dayes of the Catholyke kyng <HI>Don Ferdinando,</HI> and the lady Elizabeth his wyfe, graund∣father and graundmother vnto your maiestie, in the yeere .1491. and came to <HI>Barzalona</HI> in the yeere .1492. with the fyrst <HI>Indians,</HI> and other shewes and proofes of the great ryches and notice of this west Empire: The which gyft and benefite was suche, that it is vnto this day one of the greatest that euer any subiecte or seruaunt hath done for his prince or countrey, as is manifest to the whole worlde. And to say the trueth, this shall doubtlesse bee so commodious and profytable vnto the whole realme of Spayne, that I repute him no good Castilian or Spanyarde that doeth not recognise the same. And (as I haue sayde be∣fore) forasmuche as in my sayde generall historie I haue more largely intreated of these thinges, I intende at this present on∣ly briefely to rehearse certayne especiall thinges, the whiche surely are very fewe in respecte of the thousandes that myght be sayde in this behalfe. Fyrst therefore I will speake somewhat of the nauigation into these parties, then of the generation of the nations which are founde in the same, with theyr rytes, cu∣stomes▪ and ceremonies: also of beastes, foules, byrdes, woor∣mes, fyshes, seas, ryuers, sprynges, trees, plantes, hearbes, and dyuers other thinges, whiche are engendered both on the lande and in the water. And forasmuche as I am one of thorder and company of them that are appoynted to returne into these regions to serue your maiestie, if therefore the thinges contey∣ned in this booke shall not be distincte in suche order as I promi∣sed to perfourme in my greater woorke, I desyre your maiestie to haue no respect herevnto, but rather to consider the noueltie of such straunge thinges as I haue herein declared, whiche is the chiefe ende that moued mee to wryte: Protestyng, that in this Summarie I haue written the trueth of suche thinges as came to my remembraunce, whereof not onely I my selfe can testifie, but also dyuers other worthy and credible men, which haue been in those regions, and are now present in your maiesties courte.

<HEAD>Of the ordinary nauigation from Spayne to the west Indies.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He nauigation which is commonly made from Spayne to the west <HI>In∣dia,</HI> is from <HI>Siuile,</HI> where your maie∣stie haue your house of contraction for those partes, with also your offy∣cers therevnto parteynyng, of whom the captaynes take theyr passeporte and lycence. The patrones of suche shippes as are appoynted to these vi∣ages, imbarke them selues at <HI>San Luca di Barameda,</HI> where the ri∣uer <HI>Cuadalchiber</HI> entreth into the Ocean sea, and from hence they folow their course toward the Ilands of Canarie. Of these seuen Ilandes, they commonly touche two, that is, eyther <HI>Grancanaria</HI> or <HI>Gomera:</HI> and here the shyppes are furnyshed with freshe wa∣ter, fuell, cheese, beefe, and suche other thinges, which may seeme requisite to bee added to suche as they bryng with them out of Spayne. From Spayne to these Ilandes, is commonly eyght dayes sayling, or little more or lesse, and when they are arryued there, they haue sayled two hundred and fyftie leagues, whiche make a thousand myles, accompting foure myles to a league, as is their maner to recken by sea. Departing from the sayd Ilands to folow their course, the shyppes tary .xxv. dayes, or a litle more or lesse, before they see the fyrst lande of the Ilandes that lye be∣fore that whiche they call <HI>La Spagnuola</HI> or <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and the lande that is commonly fyrst seene, is one of these Ilandes which they call <HI>Ogni sancti Marigalante</HI> (or <HI>Galanta) La Desseada</HI> (other∣wise called <HI>Desiderata) Matanino, Dominica, Guadalupea, San Christoual,</HI> or some other of the Ilandes, wherof there are a great multitude lying about these aforesayde. Yet it sometymes so chaunceth, that the shyppes passe without the sight of any of the sayd Ilandes, or any other that are within that course, vntill they come to the Ilande of <HI>Sancti Iohannis,</HI> or <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> or <HI>Iamaica,</HI> or <HI>Cuba,</HI> which are before the other. It may also chaunce that they o∣uerpasse all these lykewyse, vntyll they fall vppon the coastes
<PB REF="198"/>
of the firme lande. But this chaunceth when the pilot is not well practised in this nauigation, or not perfect in the true carde. But makyng this viage with experte maryners (whereof there is nowe great plentie) one of the sayde fyrst Ilandes shall euer bee knowen. And from the Ilandes of Canarie to one of the fyrst of these, the distaunce is niene hundred leagues by sayling, or more, and from hence to the citie of sainct Dominike, which is in the Iland of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> is a hundred and fyftie leagues: so that from Spayne hitherto, is a thousande and three hundred leagues. Yet forasmuche as sometymes the nauigation proceedeth not so di∣rectly, but that it chaunceth to wander euer on the one syde or on the other, we may well say that they haue now sayled a thousand and fyue hundred leagues, and more. And if the nauigation bee slow, by reason of some hynderaunce, it commonly chaunceth to be fynished in xxxv. or .xl. dayes: and this happeneth for the most parte, not accomptyng the extremes, that is, eyther of them that haue slowe passage, or of them that arryue in very short tyme: for we ought to consyder that which chaunceth most commonly. The returne from those partes to Spayne, is not fynished with∣out longer tyme, as in the space of fiftie dayes, or a litle more or lesse. Neuerthelesse in this present yeere of .1525. there came foure shyppes from the Ilande of <HI>San Dominico,</HI> to sainct <HI>Luca</HI> in Spayne, in .xxv. dayes: But (as I haue sayde) we ought not to iudge of that which chaunceth seldome , but of that which hap∣peneth most ordinarily. This nauigation is very safe, and much vsed, euen vnto the sayde Iland. And from this to the firme land, the shyppes trauerse diuers wayes for the space of fyue, sixe, or seuen dayes saylyng, or more, accordyng to the partes or coastes whither they directe theyr viages, forasmuch as the sayde fyrme lande is very great and large, and many nauigations and viages are directed to dyuers partes of the same: Yet to the firme land, which is nearest to this Ilande, and lyeth directly agaynst <HI>San Dominico,</HI> the passage is finished in the tyme aforesayde. But it shalbe much better to remit all this to the carde of these nauiga∣tions, and the new Cosmographie, of the whiche no parte was knowne to Ptolome, or any other of the olde wryters.</P>

<HEAD>Of two notable thinges as touching the west Indies, and of the great rychesse brought from thence into Spayne.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter my vniuersall discription of the histo∣rie of the Indies, there commeth to my re∣membraunce two thinges chiefly to be no∣ted as touchyng Thempire of these West Indies, pertaining to the dominion of your maiestie: and these, besyde the other perti∣culars whereof I haue sufficiently spoken, are to be considered as thinges of great importaunce. Whereof, the one is the shortnesse of the way, &amp; with what expedition your maiesties shyppes may passe beyonde the mayne firme lande of these Indies, into the new South sea, called <HI>Mare del Sur,</HI> lying beyond the same, &amp; this to thintent to come to the Ilandes where the spices grow, beside the other innumerable rychesse of y<SUP>e</SUP> king∣domes &amp; seigniories which confine with the said sea, where are so many people &amp; nations of dyuers tongues &amp; maners. The other thing, is to consider howe innumerable treasures are entred into Spayne by these Indies, aswell that which commeth dayly from thence, as also that is continually to be looked for, both of gold &amp; pearle, &amp; other marchaundies, which are first brought into this your realme of Spayne before they are seene of other nations, or traded into other realmes: Whereby not onely this your realme is greatly inriched, but also the benefite thereof redoundeth to the great profite of other countreys which are neare therevnto. A te∣stimonie of this, are the double ducades which your maiestie haue caused to bee coyned, and are dispearsed throughout the whole worlde: But after they are once passed out of this your realme, they neuer returne againe, because they are the best currant mo∣ney of the worlde. And therefore, if after they haue been in the handes of straungers, they chaunce to bee returned agayne into Spayne, they come disguised in an other habite, and are dimini∣shed of the goodnesse of theyr golde, with the stampe of your maiestie chaunged: So that if it were not for theyr suche de∣facynges in other realmes for the cause aforesayde, there should not bee founde so great quantitie of fyne golde of the coyne

<HEAD>Of the mynes of golde, and the ma∣ner of workyng in them.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His particuler of the mynes of gold, is a thing greatly to bee noted, and I may much better speake hereof thē any other man, forasmuch as there are nowe .xii. yeeres past since I serued in the place of the surueier of y<SUP>e</SUP> melting shops partey∣ning to the gold mynes of y<SUP>e</SUP> firme land, and was the gouernour of the mynes of the Catholike kyng <HI>Don Ferdinando,</HI> after whose departure from this lyfe, I serued long in the same roome in the name of your maiestie: By reason wherof, I haue had great occasion to know how gold is found and wrought out of the mynes, and doe know ryght well y<SUP>t</SUP> this land is exceeding rych, hauing by my accompt, and by the labour of my Indians &amp; slaues, geathered and fyned a great portion of the same, &amp; may therfore the better affyrme this by testimony of sight. For I am well assured, that in no part of <HI>Castilia del oro,</HI> that is, golden Castile (otherwise called <HI>Beragua</HI>) no man coulde aske mee of the mynes of golde, but that I durst haue bounde my selfe to haue discouered them in the space of ten leagues of the countrey where it should haue been demaunded me, and the same to be very rych: for I was alowed all maner of charges to make search for the same. And although gold be found in maner euery where in these regions of golden Castile, yet ought we not in euery place to bestow the trauel &amp; charge to geat it out, because it is of lesse quantitie and goodnesse in some place then in some. And the myne or veyne which ought to be folowed, ought to be in a place which may stand to saue much of y<SUP>e</SUP> charges of the labourers, and for the administration of other necessary thinges, that the charges may be recompenced with gaynes: for there is no doubt but that gold shalbe found more or lesse in euery place. And the golde whiche is founde in golden Castile, is very good, &amp; of .xxii. caractes or better in fynesse. Furthermore, besyde this great quantitie of gold, which I haue sayd to be found in the
<PB N="189" REF="199"/>
mynes, there is also from day to day found, or otherwyse gotton, great treasure of such wrought gold as hath ben in y<SUP>e</SUP> custodie of the subdued Indians &amp; theyr kynges, aswel of such as they haue geuen for theyr fyne and raunsome, or otherwyse, as frendes to the Christians, besyde that whiche hath ben violently taken from the rebelles: but the greatest parte of the wrought golde whiche the Indians haue, is base, and holdeth somewhat of copper, of this they make braslettes and chaynes, and in the same they close theyr iewels whiche theyr women are accusto∣med to weare, &amp; esteemed more then al the richesse of the worlde. The maner howe golde is geathered, is this, eyther of suche as is founde in <HI>Zauana,</HI> that is to saye in the playnes and ryuers of the champion countrey beyng without trees, whether the earth be with grasse or without, or of suche as is sometymes founde on the land without the ryuers in places where trees growe, so that to come by the same, it shalbe requisite to cut downe many and great trees. But after which so euer of these two maners it be founde, eyther in the ryuers or breaches of waters, or els in the earth, I wyl shewe howe it is founde in both these places, and howe it is separate and pourged. Therefore when the myne or veyne is discouered, this chaunceth by searchyng and pro∣uyng in such places as by certaine signes and tokens do appeare to skylful men apte for the generation of golde, and to holde golde: and when they haue found it, they folowe the myne, and labour it, whether it be in the ryuer, or in the playne, as I haue sayde. And if it be founde on the playne, fyrst they make the place very cleane where they entende to dygge, then they dygge eyght or tenne foote in length, and as muche in breadth: but they goe no deeper then a spanne or two, or more, as shal seeme best to the maister of the myne, dyggyng equally, then they washe all the earth whiche they haue taken out of the sayde space, and if herein they fynde any golde, they folowe it, and if not, they dygge a spanne deeper, and washe the earth as they dyd before: and if then also they fynde nothyng, they continue in diggyng and washyng y<SUP>e</SUP> earth as before, vntyl they come to the harde rocke or stone: and if in fine they fynde no golde there, they folowe no further to seeke golde in that place, but goe to an other part. And it is to be vnderstoode, that when they haue
<PB REF="200"/>
founde the myne, they folowe it in dyggyng, in the same mea∣sure in leuell and deapth, vntyll they haue made an ende of all the myne whiche that place conteyneth, if it appeare to be riche. This myne ought to consyst of certayne feete or pases in length or breadth, accordyng to certayne orders determined, and with∣in that compasse of earth, it is not lawefull for any other to digge for golde: And where as endeth the myne of hym that fyrste founde the golde, immediatly it is lawfull for any other man that wyll, with a staffe to assigne hym selfe a place by the syde of the same, inclosing it with stakes or pales as his owne. These mines of <HI>Zauana</HI> (that is, such as are found in the plaines) ought euer to be sought neare to some ryuer or brooke, or spring of water, or dyke, or standyng poole, to thende that the golde may be washed, for the which purpose they vse the labour of certayne Indians, as they do other in dyggyng of the myne. And when they haue dygged out the myne, they fyll certayne trayes with that earth, whiche other Indians haue the charge immediatly to receyue at theyr handes, and to cary those trayes of earth to the water, where it may bee washed: Yet do not they that bryng it, washe it, but delyuer it to other, puttyng it out of theyr owne trayes into theyrs, whiche they haue redy in theyr handes to re∣ceyue it. These washers for the most part are the Indian wo∣men, because this woorke is of lesse paine and traueyle then any other. These women when they washe, are accustomed to syt by the water syde, with theyr legges in the water euen vp to the knees, or lesse, as the place serueth theyr purpose: and thus hold∣yng the trayes with earth in theyr handes by y<SUP>e</SUP> handles thereof, and puttyng the same into the water, they moue them rounde about, after the maner of syftyng, with a certayne aptnesse, in suche sorte that there entreth no more water into the trays then serueth theyr turne, and with the selfe same apte mouyng of theyr trays in the water, they euer auoyde the foule water with the earth out of the one syde of the vessell, and receyue in cleane water on the other syde thereof, so that by this meanes by litle and litle, the water washeth the earth as the lyghter substaunce of the trays, and the golde as the heauyer mat∣ter resteth in the bottome of the same, beyng rounde and holowe in the myddest lyke vnto a barbars basen: And when
<PB N="190" REF="200"/>
all the earth is auoyded, and the gold geathered togeather in the bottome of the tray, they put it a part, and returne to take more earth, whiche they washe contynually as before. And thus they that labour in this woorke, do geather dayly suche portion of golde as shall please God to graunt to the Patrones of these In∣dians, and suche other as trauayle in the same. Furthermore it is to be noted, that for euery two Indians that washe, it is re∣quisite that two other serue them to bryng earth from the myne, and other two to breake the same small, and fyl theyr trayes ther∣with. Also besyde these labourers, it is necessarye that there be other people in the place where they woorke &amp; rest in the night: these are suche as make theyr bread, and prouide for victuals, and other necessaries. So that to conclude, there are in al, fyue persons ordinarilie assigned to euery tray of washers. There is an other manner of workyng the mynes, in ryuers or brookes of runnyng waters: and this is, that in auoydyng the water of his course, after that the beddes of the ryuers are drye and vtterly emptied, they fynde golde among the breaches, clyftes, and ryftes of stones, and among all that is in the bot∣tome of the chanell, and where naturally the ryuer runneth of greatest force: So that it chaunceth sometyme, that when the bedde of the ryuer is good and ryche, they fynde in it great quan∣titie of gold. And therfore your Maiestie ought to vnderstand for a general rule, as it appeareth in fact, that all golde is engen∣dred in the toppes and hyghest places of the mountaynes, and in continuance of tyme is by litle and litle brought downe to the vales and playnes by shewres of rayne, and the falles of sprynges, ryuers, and brookes, hauyng theyr originall in the mountaynes, and discending from the same, notwithstan∣dyng it is oftentymes founde in the playnes farre from the mountaynes. But when it chaunceth to be founde in great quantitie, it is for the most part among the mountaynes, and in the ryuers, or theyr braunches, more then in any other part of the playne: and in these two maners it is commoly founde most abundantly. And for the better proofe that golde is engen∣dred on hygh, and is brought downe into the lowe places, I haue one great token therof, whiche causeth me to beleeue it for certayne: and this is, to consyder that coles neuer putrifie nor
<PB REF="201"/>
corrupt vnder the grounde, if they be made of strong woodde. Wherby it chaunceth, that dyggyng the earth by the fouldes or indented places of the mountaynes, or on the sydes, &amp; breakyng a myne in the earth where it had been broken before, and hauing nowe dygged one or two or three Poles in measure, the my∣ners founde certayne coles of wood vnder the same leuel where they founde golde, and this I say in the earth whiche was taken for a Uirgin, that is to saye, such as had not before been opened for any myne: the whiche coles coulde not naturally be engendred there, or enter in by any meanes, but when the super∣fitiall part of the earth was equal with the leuel where the coles were founde, it is like that the coles were left there by some occa∣sion of fyre, and that they fastened there in tyme, and that after∣warde in long continuance of tyme, they were by litle and litle couered with the earth, whiche the often shewres of rayne wash∣ed from the mountaynes, so that by the course of yeeres the earth ouergrewe the coles vnto the sayd leuell &amp; measure, which had before tyme been the superfitial part of the earth, where the coles and golde were found togeather: whereby it may appeare that the golde was no more engendred there then were the coles, but brought thyther from the mountaynes by the falles of wa∣ters as we haue sayd, forasmuch as the mountaynes are the Ma∣trices and bowels of all ryche metals. Further and besyde this, I say that in howe muche more the golde is gone farre from the naturall place of his generation to the place where it is founde, it is so much the more purified and fined, and of a better caract, and the nearer that it is founde to his proper myne or veyne where it is engendred, it is so much the baser, fouler, and more crude, and of a baser alay and caract, and doth wast so muche the more in meltyng, and remayneth more brickle. Some∣tymes there are founde graines of golde of great quantitie, and of great weyght aboue the earth, and sometymes also vnder the earth: And the greatest of all other that was founde to this day in the Indies, was that whiche was lost in the sea about the Ilande <HI>Beata,</HI> whiche weyghed three thousande and two hundred Castellans of gold, which are in value foure thousand a hundred thyrtie and eyght ducades of golde, whiche weigh one <HI>Arroua</HI> and seuen pounde, or thyrtie and two pounde, after twelue oun∣ces
<PB N="191" REF="201"/>
to the pounde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A marke, is a pounde of viii. ounces summa .xvi.li. weyght .viii. ounces, after xii. ounces to the .li.</NOTE> whiche make threescore and foure markes of golde. And I sawe in the yeere .1515. in the handes of <HI>My∣chel Passamonte</HI> treasurer to your maiestie, two graines, of the whiche one wayed seuen poundes, which are .xiiii. markes, and are in value about threescore and fyue ducades of golde euery marke: the other was of .x. markes, whiche are fyue poundes of lyke value, and of very good golde of .xxii. caractes, and better: There are also founde many other great graynes, al∣though not equall vnto these in bygnesse. And forasmuch as I haue spoken of gold, I haue thought good to declare somewhat howe the Indians can very excellently gylte suche vesselles of copper and base golde as they make: for they can geue them so fayre and floryshyng a coloure, that al the masse which they gylt, appeareth as though it were golde of .xxii. caractes, and better. This colour they geue with a certayne hearbe, as though it were wrought by y<SUP>e</SUP> art of any goldsmith of Spayne or Italie, and woulde of them bee esteemed as a thyng of great ryches, and a secrete maner of gyldyng. And for as muche as I haue spo∣ken sufficiently of the mynes of golde, I wyl nowe speake somewhat of copper, because I haue made mention thereof. This metal is founde in many of the Ilandes of the Indies, and also in the firme lande, and is founde dayly in great quantitie, holdyng somewhat of golde. But for the desyre that our men haue to golde, they nothyng esteeme the copper, although there myght great commoditie and profyt be had thereby, and also by other metals, whiche they nothyng regarde, except syluer, which is founde abundantly in that parte of the firme lande whi∣che is called newe Spaine. But of this it shal suffise to haue saide thus muche, because I haue more particulerly entreated of these thynges in my generall hystory of India.</P>

<HI>Cubagua,</HI> for this purpose. Theyr custome is to go fyue, syxe, or seuen, or more in one of theyr <HI>Canoas</HI> or barkes, earely in the mornyng to some place in the sea thereabout, where it appeareth vnto them that there should be great plentie of those shell fyshes (which some call Muscles, and some Oysters) wherein pearles are engendred, &amp; there they plunge them selues vnder the water, euen vnto the bottome, sauyng one that remayneth in the <HI>Canoa</HI> or boate, which he keepeth styll in one place as neare as he can, lookyng for theyr returne out of the water: And when one of them hath ben a good whyle vnder the water, he ryseth vp, and commeth swymmyng to the boate, entryng into the same, and leauyng there al the Oysters which he hath taken and brought with hym (for in these are the pearles found) and when he hath there rested hym selfe a whyle, and eaten part of the Oysters, he returneth agayne to the water, where he remayneth as long as he can endure, and then ryseth agayne, and swymmeth to the boate with his pray, where he resteth hym as before, and thus continueth course by course, as do all the other in lyke maner, be∣yng al most expert swymmers and dyuers: and when the night draweth neare, they returne to the Ilande to theyr houses, and present all the Oysters to the maister or stewarde of the house of theyr lorde, who hath the charge of the sayde Indians, and when he hath geuen them somewhat to eate, he layeth vp the Oysters in safe custodie, vntyll he haue a great quantitie therof, then he causeth the same fysher men to open them, and they fynd in euery of them pearles, other great or small, two, or three, or foure, and sometymes fyue or syxe, and many small graines, ac∣cordyng to the liberalitie of nature. They saue the pearles both smal and great whiche they haue founde, and eyther eate the Oysters if they wyl, or cast them away, hauyng so great quan∣titie thereof, that they in maner abhorre them. These Oysters are of harde fleshe, and not so pleasaunt in eatyng as are ours of Spayne. This Iland of <HI>Cubagua</HI> where this maner of fyshing is exercised, is in the North coaste, and is no bygger then the Ilande of Zeland. Oftentymes the sea increaseth greatly, and much more then y<SUP>e</SUP> fishers for pearles would, because where as the place is very deepe, a man can not naturally rest at the bottome,
<PB N="192" REF="202"/>
by reason of the abundaunce of ayry substaunce whiche is in hym. as I haue oftentymes prooued. For although he may by vio∣lence and force discende to the bottome, yet are his feete lyfted vp agayne, so that he can contynue no tyme there: and there∣fore where the sea is very deepe, these Indian fyshers vse to tye two great stones about them with a cord, on euery syde one, by the weyght whereof they discende to the bottome, and remayne there vntyll them lysteth to ryse agayne, at whiche tyme they vnlose the stones, and ryse vp at theyr pleasure. But this theyr aptenesse and agilitie in swymmyng, is not the thyng that cau∣seth men most to marueyle: but rather to consyder howe ma∣ny of them can stande in the botome of the water for the space of one whole houre, and some more or lesse, accordyng as one is more apt heereunto then an other. An other thyng there is whiche seemeth to me very straunge: and this is, that where as I haue oftentimes demaunded of some of these Lordes of the Indians, yf the place where they are accustomed to fyshe for pearles, beyng but litle and narrowe, wyll not in short tyme be vtterly without Oysters, yf they consume them so fast. They all answered me, that although they be consumed in one part, yet if they goe a fyshyng in an other part, or an other coaste of the I∣lande, or at an other contrary wynde, and contynue fyshyng there also vntyll the Oysters be lykewyse consumed, and then returne agayne to the first place, or any other place where they fi∣shed before, and emptied the same in lyke maner, they finde them agayne as full of Oysters as though they had neuer been fyshed. Wherby we may iudge, that these Oysters eyther remoue from one place to an other, as do other fishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of this reade more largely in the decades.</NOTE> or els that they are en∣gendred and encrease in certaine ordinarie places. This Iland of <HI>Cumana</HI> &amp; <HI>Cubagua,</HI> where they fyshe for these pearles, is in the twelfe degree of the part of the said coast which inclineth toward the North.

I speake this as a trewe testimo∣nie of syght, hauing been long in that South sea, and makyng curious inquisition to be certaynely enfourmed of al that partey∣neth to the fyshyng of pearles. From this Ilande of <HI>Terarequi,</HI> there was brought a pearle of the fashyon of a Peare, weighing thyrtie and one Caractes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the compu∣tation of Ve∣nice, foure granes make a Caract.</NOTE> which <HI>Petrus Arias</HI> had among a thou∣sand and so many poundes weyght of other pearles, whiche he had when captayne <HI>Gaspar Morales</HI> (before <HI>Petrus Arias</HI>) pas∣sed to the sayde Ilande in the yeere .1515. whiche pearle was of great pryce. From the sayde Ilande also, came a great and very rounde pearle, which I brought out of the sea, this was as bygge as a smal pellet of a Stonebowe, and of the weyght of twentie and syx Caractes: I bought it in the citie of <HI>Panama,</HI> in the sea of <HI>Sur,</HI> and payde for it syx hundred and fyftie tymes the weyght therof of good golde, and had it three yeeres in my custo∣die, and after my returne into Spayne, sold it to the Earle of <HI>Nansao</HI> Marquesse of <HI>Zenete,</HI> great Chamberlayne to your Ma∣iestie, who gaue it to the Marquesse his wyfe, the Lady <HI>Mentia</HI> of <HI>Mendozza.</HI> I thynke veryly that this pearle was the greatest, fayrest, and roundest that hath been seene in those partes. For your maiestie ought to vnderstand, that in the coaste of the sea of <HI>Sur,</HI> there are founde a hundred great pearles rounde after the fa∣shyon of a Peare, to one that is perfectly rounde and great.

Thus when the agonie is past, and he lyeth quietly (yet without any sense or feelyng) the kyng, or some other in his stead, demaundeth of him what he desireth to know: and the spirit answereth by the mouth of the rapte <HI>Piaces,</HI> with a directe and perfecte answere to all poyntes: Insomuche that on a tyme certayne Spanyardes beyng present at these my∣steries with one of the kynges, and in the Spanyshe tounge de∣maundyng the <HI>Piaces</HI> of their shyppes which they looked for out of Spayne, the spirite answered in the Indian tounge, and tolde them what day and houre the shyppes departed from Spayne, how many they were, and what they brought, without fayling in any poynte. If he be also demaunded of the eclypse of the Sunne or Moone (which they greatly feare and abhorre) he giueth a per∣fect answere, and the lyke of tempestes, famin, plentie, warre or peace, and such other thinges. When all the demaundes are fini∣shed, his disciples call him aloude, ryngyng the siluer bell at his eare, and blowyng a certayne powder into his nosethrilles, whereby he is raysed as it were from a dead s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eape, beyng yet somewhat heauy headed and faynte a good whyle after. Thus beyng agayne rewarded of the kyng with more bread, hee de∣parteth agayne to the desartes with his disciples. But since the Christian fayth hath been dispearsed throughout the Ilande, these deuyllyshe practises haue ceassed, and they of the members of the deuyll, are made the members of Christ by baptisme, forsa∣kyng the deuyll and his workes, with the vayne curiositie of de∣syre of knowledge of thinges to come, whereof for the most parte it is better to be ignorant, then with vexation to know that which can not be auoyded.</P>

<PB REF="205"/>
they dyd before on the earth whyle hee lyued: and that all that refuse so to doe, when after they dye by theyr naturall death or otherwyse, theyr soules to dye with theyr bodyes, and to bee dissolued into ayre, and become nothyng, as doe the soules of Hogges, Byrdes, Fyshes, or other bruite beastes: and that on∣ly the other may enioy the priuiledge of immortalitie for euer, to serue the kyng in heauen. And of this false opinion commeth it, that they which sowe corne, or set rootes for the kynges bread, and geather the same, are accustomed to kyll them selues, that they may enioy this priuiledge in heauen, and for the same pur∣pose, cause a portion of the graine of <HI>Maizium,</HI> and a bundle of <HI>Iucca</HI> (whereof theyr bread is made) to be buryed with them in their graues, that the same may serue them in heauen, if per∣happes there should lacke seedes to sowe, and therefore they take this with them, to begyn withall, vntil <HI>Tuyra</HI> (who maketh them all these fayre promises) prouyde them of greater quantitie. This haue I my selfe seene in the toppe of the mountaynes of <HI>Guaturo,</HI> where hauing in pryson the kyng of that prouince (who rebelled from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bedience of your maiestie) and demaundyng of him to whom parteyned those sepultures or graues which I sawe in his house: hee answered, that they were of certayne Indians which slue them selues at the death of his father. And because they are oftentimes accustomed to bury great quantities of wrought gold with them, I caused twoo graues to be opened, wherein was no∣thyng founde but a vessell full of the graine of <HI>Maizium,</HI> &amp; a bun∣dle of <HI>Iucca,</HI> as I haue sayde. And demaundyng the cause here∣of, of the kyng and the other Indians: they answered, that they that were buryed there, were the labourers of the grounde, and men skylfull in sowyng of seedes, and makyng of bread, and ser∣uauntes to the kynges father, and to the ende that their soules should not dye with theyr bodyes, they slue them selues at the death of the kyng theyr maister, to lyue with hym in heauen, and to the intent that they myght serue him there in the same offyce, they reserued that <HI>Maizium</HI> and <HI>Iucca,</HI> to sowe it in heauen. Wherevnto I aunswered them in this maner, Be∣holde howe your <HI>Tuyra</HI> deceyueth you, and howe all that hee teacheth you is false. You see howe in so long a tyme since they are dead, they haue not yet taken away this <HI>Maizium</HI> and <HI>Iucca,</HI>
<PB N="195" REF="205"/>
which is nowe putrified and woorth nothyng, and not lyke to bee sowen in heauen. To this the kyng replyed, saying, in that they haue not taken it away, nor sowen it in heauen, the cause is, that they chaunced to fynde enough there, by reason whereof they had no neede of this. To this errour many thinges were sayd, which seemed of litle force to remoue him from his false opinion, and e∣specially any such as at that age are occupyed of the deuyl, whom they paynt of the selfe same fourme and colour, as hee appeareth vnto them in dyuers shapes and fourmes. They make also Ima∣ges of golde, copper, and wood, to the same similitudes, in terri∣ble shapes, and so variable, as the paynters are accustomed to paynt them at the feete of sainct Michaell tharchangell, or in any other place, where they paynte them of most horrible portiture. Lykewyse when the deuyll greatly intendeth to feare them, hee threatneth to sende them great tempestes, whiche they call <HI>Fura∣canas,</HI> or <HI>Haurachanas,</HI> and are so vehement, that they ouerthrow many houses, and great trees. And I haue seene in mountaynes, full of many and great trees, that for the space of three quarters of a league the mountayne hath been subuerted, and the trees o∣uerthrowen, and plucked out of the earth with the rootes: a thing doubtlesse so fearefull and terrible to beholde, that it may veryly appeare to bee done by the hande of the deuyll. And in this case the Christian men ought to consider with good reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctrine not worthy for a christian man.</NOTE> that in all places where the holy sacrament is reserued, the sayde tempestes are no more so outragious, or so perilous as they were wont to bee.</P>

<HEAD>Of the temperature of the regions vnder or neare to the burnt lyne, called <HI>Torrida Zona,</HI> or the Equinoctiall, and of the dyuers seasons of the yeere.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He landes and regions that are neare about the clymes of the Equinoctiall lyne, are na∣turally hot, although they be otherwise tem∣perate by the diuine prouidence: &amp; therfore such fleshe or fyshe as is taken and kylled in these regions, can not be preserued from pu∣trifaction, except it be rosted, sodden, or per∣boyld, the same day that it is kyld. And wheras I haue sayd, that
<PB REF="206"/>
such regions are naturally hotte, and yet temperate by the proui∣dence of God, it is so in deede: and therefore not without cause the auncient aucthours were of opinion, that the burnt lyne, or <HI>Torrida zona,</HI> where passeth the lyne of the Equinoctiall, shoulde be vnhabitable, by reason the Sun hath greater dominion in that place, then in any other of the sphere, remaynyng continually be∣tweene the two tropykes of Cancer and Capricorne: For when in these regions the earth is opened or dygged from the superfi∣ciall parte thereof to the deapth of a mans heyght, it is founde temperate, and within this space the trees and plants fasten and spread their rootes, and no deeper, extendyng the same as farre in breadth in the grounde as doe theyr braunches in the ayre, and enter no deeper into the grounde then I haue sayde, because that beneath the deapth of the sayde space of a mans heyght the earth is very hotte, the vpper part beyng temperate and very moyst, aswell by reason of the abundaunce of water whiche falleth from heauen vpon that earth at certayne ordinarie seasons of the yeere, as also for the multitude of great ryuers, brookes, sprynges, and maryshes, whereby the myghtie and supreme Lord which made these landes, hath most prudently prouided for the preseruation of the same.</P>
<P>There are also many rough and hygh mountaynes, with tem∣perate ayre, and pleasaunt, cleare, and moderate nyghtes: of the whiche particularitie the auncient wryters hauyng no certayne knowledge, affirmed the said burnt line or <HI>Torrida zona,</HI> or Equi∣noctiall, to be naturally vnhabitable. As touching which thing I am able to witnesse the contrary by testimonie of syght and fee∣lyng, as by most certayne senses, hauyng lyued many yeeres in these regions, by reason whereof better credite ought to be giuen to me, then to such as haue grounded their opininion onely vpon coniectures. And to speake further of the situation of these regi∣ons, you shall vnderstand that the coaste of the North sea, beyng in the gulfe of <HI>Vraba,</HI> and in the porte of <HI>Dariena,</HI> where the shyps arryue whiche come out of Spayne, is in the sixte degree and a halfe, and in the seuenth, and from sixe and a halfe, vnto eyght, ex∣cept a small poynt which entreth into the sea towarde the North. That poynt which of this lande and new parte of the worlde ly∣eth most towarde the East, is the cape of sainct Augustine, which
<PB N="196" REF="206"/>
is in the eyght degree: So that the sayd gulfe of <HI>Vraba,</HI> is distant from the Equinoctiall lyne, from a hundred &amp; twentie, to a hun∣dred and thirtie leagues, and three quarters of a league, after that accompte of .xvii. leagues and a halfe for euery degree from pole to pole: and thus for a litle more or lesse, goeth all the coast. By reason whereof, in the citie of <HI>Sancta Maria Antiqua</HI> in <HI>Dariena,</HI> and in all that course of the foresayde gulfe of <HI>Vraba,</HI> at all tymes of the yeere the dayes and nyghtes are in maner of equall length: and if there bee any difference betweene them by reason of this small distance from the Equinoctiall, it is so litle, that in .xxiiii. houres, makyng a naturall day, it can not bee perceyued but by the iudgement of speculatiue men, and suche as vnderstande the sphere: From hence the North starre is seene very lowe. And when the starres, whiche are called the guardens of the North starre, are vnder the Chariot, it can not be seene, because it is vn∣der the horizontall. And whereas I haue sayde before that it ray∣neth in these regions at certayne ordinarie tymes, it is so in deed: For it is wynter and summer there at contrary tymes to that which is in Spayne, where the greatest colde of frost and rayne is in December and Ianuary, and the greatest heate of sommer about saint Iohns day at Mydsommer, or in the moneth of Iu∣ly: But in golden Castile or <HI>Beragua,</HI> it is contrary, for the som∣mer and tyme of greatest drought &amp; without rayne, is at Christ∣mas, and a moneth before, and a moneth after, &amp; the tyme when it rayneth most, is about Mydsommer, and a moneth before, and a moneth after. And this season which they call wynter, is not for that it is any colder then, then at any other tyme of the yeere, or hotter at Christmas then at other seasons, the tyme in these regions being euer after one maner: but for that, that, in this tyme whiche they call wynter, the Sunne is hydde from theyr sightes, by reason of cloudes and rayne, more then at other times. Yet forasmuche as for the most part of the yeere they lyue in a cleare, open, and temperate ayre, they somewhat shrynke and feele a litle colde duryng the tyme of the sayde moyst and cloudy ayre, although it be not colde in deede, or at the least such colde as hath any sensible sharpenesse.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Any other thinges might be sayd, and much differyng from these wherof I haue spoken. But to lette passe the multitude of thinges whiche are as variable as the power of na∣ture is infinite, and to speake of such thinges as come chiefely to my remembraunce, as most worthie to be noted, I will first speake of certayne litle and troublous beastes, which may seeme to bee engendred of nature to molest &amp; vexe men, to shewe them &amp; giue them to vnderstand, how small and vyle a thing may offende and disquiet them, to thende that they may remember the principall end for the which they were created, that is, to know their maker and procurer of their saluation by the way whiche is open to all Christian men, and all other which will open the eyes of theyr vnderstandyng. And although the thinges whereof wee en∣tende nowe to speake, may seeme vyle and litle to be esteemed, yet are they worthy to bee noted and considered, to vnderstande the difference and variable workes of nature. So it is therefore, that whereas in many partes of the firme lande, by the whiche as well the Christians as Indians doe trauayle, there are suche maryshes and waters in the way, that they are fayne to go with∣out breeches among the hearbes and weedes, by reason whereof, certaine smal beasts or wormes (which they cal <HI>Garapates</HI>) much lyke vnto tykes, cleaue fast to their legges. These wormes are as litle as the pouder of beaten salt, and cleaue so fast, that they can by no meanes bee taken away, except the place bee noynted with oyle: and after that the legges be noynted a whyle with oyle, or the other partes where these litle tykes are fastened, they scrape the place with a knyfe, and so take them away. But the In∣dians whiche haue no oyle, smoke them, and burne them with fyre, and abyde great paynes in takyng them away by this meanes. Of other litle beastes whiche trouble men, and are engendred in theyr heades or other partes of theyr bodyes, I say that the Christian men which trauayle into these partes, haue them but seldome tymes, and that not past one or two, &amp; this al∣so

very seldome: For passyng by the lyne of the Diameter where the compasse maketh difference of saylyng by the wynde called <HI>Greco,</HI> (that is, Northeast) and <HI>Magistral</HI> (that is, southwest) whiche is in the course of the Ilandes of <HI>Azori,</HI> they sayle but a litle way folowyng our viage by the west, but that all the lyse whiche the Christians cary with them, or are engendred in theyr heades, or other places of theyr bodyes, dye and vtterly consume by litle and litle, and are not engendred in India, except in the heades of litle chyldren in those partes, aswell among the chyldren of the Christians whiche are borne there, as also among the naturall Indians, who haue them commonly in theyr heades, and sometymes in other partes of theyr bodyes, and especially they of the prouince of <HI>Cueua,</HI> whiche is a region contaynyng more then a hundred leagues in length, and embraseth the one and the other coast of the North sea, and of the East. When these Indians are infected with this fylthynesse, they dresse and cleanse one an other: And they that exercyse this, are for the most part women, who eate all that they take, and haue herein suche dexteritie by reason of theyr exercise, that our men can not lyghtly attayne therunto. There is also another thyng greatly to be consydered: and this is, howe the Christian men, beyng there cleane from this fyl∣thynesse of India, aswell in theyr heades as the rest of theyr bo∣dyes, yet when they returne to come agayne into Europe, and begyn to arryue in that place of the Ocean sea where we sayde before that these lyse dyed and forsoke them, sodenly in theyr re∣passyng by the same clyme (as though these lyse had taryed for them in that place) they can by no meanes auoyde them for the space of certayne dayes, although they change theyr shertes two or three times in a day: These lise are at y<SUP>e</SUP> fyrst as litle as nittes, and growe by litle and litle, vntyl they be of the byggenesse that they are in Spayne.

in the meane tyme it can neyther be seene nor taken) that from some it hath cut of theyr handes, and from other theyr feete, vntyll the remedy was founde to annoynt the place with oyle, and scrape it with a rasor. In the firme lande in golden Castyle or <HI>Beragua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vipers.</NOTE> there are many vipers lyke vnto them of Spayne: they that are bytten of them, dye in short space, for fewe lyue to the fourth day, except present remedy. Of these, some are of lesse kynde then other, and haue theyr tayle somewhat rounde, and leape in the ayre to assayle men, and for this cause, some call this kynde of vipers <HI>Tyro</HI>: theyr by∣tyng is most venomous, and for the most parte incurable. One of them chaunced to byte an Indian mayde whiche serued me in my house, to whom I caused the Surgians to mynister theyr ordinary cure, but they coulde do her no good, nor yet geat one droppe of blood out of her, but onely a yelowe water, so that she dyed the thyrde day for lacke of remedy, as the lyke hath chaunced to dyuers other: This mayde was of the age of .xiiii. yeeres, and spake the Spanyshe tongue as if she had been borne in Castyle: she sayde that the viper whiche byt her on the foote, was two spannes long, or litle lesse, and that to byte her, she lept in the ayre for the space of more then syxe pases, as I haue hearde the lyke of other credible persons. I haue also seene in the firme lande a kynde of adders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adders.</NOTE> very small, and of seuen or eyght foote long: these are so redde, that in the nyght they appeare lyke burnyng cooles, and in the day seeme as redde as bloodde, these are also venomous, but not so muche as the vipers. There are other muche lesse, and shorter, and blac∣ker: these come out of the ryuers, and wander sometymes farre on the lande, and are lykewyse venomous. There are also o∣ther adders of a russet colour: these are somewhat bygger then the viper, and are hurtful and venomous. There are lykewyse an other sort of many colours, and very long: of these I sawe one in the yeere of Christ .1515. in the Iland of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> neere vnto the sea coastes, at the foote of the mountaynes called <HI>Peder∣nales,</HI> when this adder was slayne, I measure her, and founde her to be more then .xx. foote long, &amp; somwhat more then a mans fyst in byggnesse: and although she had three or foure deadly woundes with a swoorde, yet dyed she not, nor stonke the

There are also in the Maryshes and desartes of the fyrme lande many other kyndes of Lysartes, Dragons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dragons.</NOTE> and other diuers kyndes of Serpentes, whereof I entende not heere to speake muche, because I haue more particulerly entreated of these thynges in my generall historie of the West Indies. There are also Spyders of marueylous byggenesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spiders</NOTE> and I haue seene some with the bodye and legges bygger then a mans hande extended euery waye, and I once sawe one of suche byggenesse, that only her bodye was as bygge as a Spar∣rowe, and full of that Laune whereof they make theyr webbes: this was of a darke russet coloure, with eyes greater then the eyes of a Sparowe, they are venomous, and of terrible shape to heholde. There are also Scorpions, and dyuers other such venomous wormes. Whereby we may see, that where as na∣turall causes and influence of the planettes are of strongest acti∣uitie, they ceasse not to engender and bryng foorth both good and badde, accordyng to the dispotion of the matter, whiche they also doo partly dispose, as the philosophers affyrme. Fur∣thermore in the fyrme lande, there are many Toades, beyng ve∣ry noyous and hurtfull by reason of theyr great multitude, they are not venomous, they are seene in great abundaunce in <HI>Darie∣na,</HI> where they are so bygge that when they dye in the tyme of drouth, the bones of some of them (and especialy the rybbes) are of suche greatnesse, that they appeare to be the bones of Cattes, or of some other beastes of the same byggenesse. But as the waters diminishe, and the moysture consumeth in the tyme of drouth (as I haue sayde) they also consume therewith, vntyl the yeere next folowyng when the rayne and moysture encrease, at whiche tyme they are seene agayne. Neuerthelesse, at this pre∣sent there is no such quantitie of them, as was wont to be, by rea∣son that as the lande is better cultured by the Christians, aswell by the fellyng of wooddes and shrubbes, as also by the pasture of Kyne, Horses, and other beastes, so is it apparent that this poy∣son diminisheth daylye, whereby that region becommeth more holsome and pleasaunt: these Toades syng after three or foure sortes, for some of them syng pleasauntly, other lyke ours of Spayne, some also whystle, and other some make an

There are also a straunge kynde of Crabbes, whiche come foorth of certayne holes of the earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crabbes.</NOTE> that they them selues make: the head and bodie of these make one rounde thyng, muche lyke vnto the hood of a Faulkon, hauyng foure feete commyng out of the one syde, &amp; as many out of the other: they haue also two mouthes, like vnto a payre of small Pinsers, the one bygger then the other, wherewith they byte, but doo no great hurt, because they are not venomous: theyr skynne and bodie is smooth, and thynne, as is the skynne of a man, sauyng that it is somewhat harder, theyr coloure is russet, or whyte, or blewe, and walke sydelong, they are very good to be eaten, insomuche that the Christians trauaylyng by the fyrme lande, haue been greatly nouryshed by them, because they are founde in maner euery where: in shape and fourme they are muche like vnto the Crabbe whiche we paynt for the signe Can∣cer, and like vnto those whiche are founde in Spayne in <HI>Anda∣lusia</HI> in the ryuer <HI>Guadalchiber,</HI> where it entreth into the sea, and in the sea coastes there about, sauyng that these are of the water, and the other of the lande: they are sometymes hurtfull, so that they that eate of them dye, but this chaunceth only when they haue eaten any venomous thyng, or of the venomous apples wherewith the Canible archers poyson theyr arrowes, whereof I wyll speake hereafter, and for this cause the Christians take heede how they eate of these Crabbes, yf they fynde them neare vnto the sayd apple trees. Furthermore in these Indies, aswel in the fyrme lande, as in the Ilandes, there is founde a kynde of Serpentes, whiche they call <HI>.Y.

kynde of smothnesse or barenesse, although of dyuers colours: vpon the rydge of theyr backes, they haue many long prickes, theyr teeth are very sharpe, and especially theyr fanges or dogge teeth, theyr throtes are long and large, reachyng from theyr beardes to theyr breastes, of the lyke skynne to the resydue of theyr bodyes: they are dumbe, and haue no voyce, or make any noyse, or crye, although they bee kept tyed to the foote of a cheste, or any other thyng, for the space of .xx. or .xxv. dayes, without any thyng to eate or drynke, except they geue them nowe and then a litle of the bread of <HI>Cazabbi,</HI> or some suche other thyng: they haue foure feete, and theyr fore feete as long as a mans fynger, with clawes lyke the clawes of a byrde, but weaker, and suche as can not grasple or take holde of any thyng: they are muche better to bee eaten then to beholde, for fewe that see them, wyll haue desyre to eate of them, by reason of theyr horrible shape, except suche as haue ben accusto∣med to the beastes of these regions, whiche are more horrible and feareful, as this is not, but onely in apparence: theyr fleshe is of muche better tast then the fleshe of Connies, and more holsome, for it hurteth none but onely suche as haue had the frenche poxe, insomuche that if they haue been touched of that infirmitie, although they haue ben whole of long tyme, neuer∣thelesse they feele hurte, and complayne of the earyng of these <HI>Iuannas,</HI> as hath been oftentimes prooued by experience. There are founde in the fyrme lande certayne byrdes, so litle, that the whole body of one of them is no bygger then the toppe of the byggest fynger of a mans hande, and yet is the bare body with∣out the feathers not halfe so bygge: This byrde, besyde her li∣tlenesse, is of suche velocitie and swyftnesse in fleeyng, that who so seeth her fleeyng in the ayre, can not see her flap or beate her winges after any other sort then do the Dorres, or humble bees, or Beetels: so that there is no man that seeth her flee, that would thynke her to be any other then a Dorre: they make their nestes accordyng to the proportion of their bygnes, and I haue seene that one of these byrdes with her nest put in a payre of golde weights, altogeather hath waide no more then .2. <HI>Tomini,</HI> which are in poise .24. graines, with the feathers, with out the which she shoulde haue wayed somwhat lesse.

Theyr feathers are of many fayre colours, as golden, yelowe, and greene, besyde other variable colours, theyr beake is very long for the proportion of theyr bodies, and as fyne and subtile as a sowyng nedle: they are very hardy, so that when they see a man clime y<SUP>e</SUP> tree where they haue their nests, they flee at his face, &amp; stryke hym in the eyes, commyng, goyng, and returnyng with such swyftnes, that no man woulde lyghtly beleeue it, that hath not seene it: and certaynly these byrdes are so litle, that I durst not haue made mention hereof, if it were not that diuers other which haue seene them as wel as I can beare witnes of my say∣ing: they make their nestes of flockes and heare of cotton, wherof there is great plentie in these regions, and serueth wel for theyr purpose. But as touchyng the byrdes, foules, and beastes of these Indies, because they are innumerable, both litle and great, I intende not to speake muche heere, because I haue spoken more largely hereof in my generall hystorye of the Indies. There is an other kynde of beastes seene in the firme lande, whiche seemeth very strange and marueylous to the Christian men to beholde, and much differyng from al other beastes whi∣che haue ben seene in other partes of the world: these beastes are called <HI>Bardati,</HI> and are foure footed, hauyng their tayle and al the rest of theyr bodyes couered onely with a skynne lyke the coper∣ture of a barbed horse, or the checkered skinne of a Lisarte or Cro∣codile, of coloure betwene white and russet, inclynyng somwhat more to whyte. This beast is of fourme and shape muche lyke to a barbed horse, with his barbes and flankets in al poynts, and from vnder that which is the barbe and coperture, the taile com∣meth forth, and the feete in theyr place, the necke also &amp; the eares in theyr partes, and in fyne al thynges in lyke sorte as in a bar∣bed courser: they are of the bygnesse of one of these common dogges, they are not hurtfull, they are fylthy, and haue theyr habitation in certaine hillockes of earth, where dygging with their feete, they make theyr dens very deepe, &amp; the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es thereof, in like maner as do Connies, they are very excellent to be eaten, &amp;
<PB N="200" REF="210"/>
are taken with nettes, and some also kylled with Crosbowes: they are likewise taken oftentymes when the husbandmen burne the stubble in sowyng tyme, or to renue the herbage for Kyne and other beastes. I haue oftentymes eaten of theyr flesh, which seemeth to me of better tast then Kyddes fleshe, and holsome to be eaten. And if these beastes had euer been seene in these partes of the worlde, where the fyrst barbed horses had theyr originall, no man woulde iudge but that the fourme and fashyon of the co∣perture of horses furnyshed for the warres, was fyrst deuised by the syght of these beastes. There is also in the fyrme lande an o∣ther beast, called <HI>Orso Formigaro,</HI> that is, the Ante beare. This beast in heare and coloure, is much lyke to the Beare of Spaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res.</NOTE> and in maner of the same makyng, saue that he hath a muche lon∣ger snout, and is of euyll syght: they are oftentymes taken on∣ly with staues, without any other weapon, and are not hurtful, they are also taken with dogges, because they are not naturally armed, although they byte somewhat, they are founde for the most part about and neare to the hyllockes where are great a∣bundaunce of Antes. For in these regions is engendred a cer∣tayne kynde of Antes, very litle and blacke, in the feeldes and playnes where as growe no trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antes▪</NOTE> where by the instinct of na∣ture these Antes separate them selues to engender farre from the wooddes for feare of these Beares, the which because they are fearefull, vyle, and vnarmed (as I haue sayde) they keepe euer in places full of trees, vntyll very famine and necessitie, or the great desire that they haue to feede on these Antes, cause them to come out of the woods to hunt for them: these Antes make a hil∣locke of earth to the heyght of a man, or somewhat more or lesse, and as byg as a great chest, &amp; sometymes as byg as a Butte or a Hogshead, &amp; as hard as a stone, so that they seeme as though they were stones, set vp to limit the endes &amp; confines of certaine lands. Within these hillocks, made of most harde earth, are innu∣merable and infinite litle Antes, the whiche may be geathered by bushelles when the hyllocke is broken: the whiche when it is sometymes moysted by rayne, and then dryed agayne by the heate of the Sonne, it breaketh, and hath certayne small ryftes, as litle and subtyle as the edge of a knyfe, and it see∣meth that nature hath geuen sense to these Antes to fynde
<PB REF="211"/>
suche a matter of earth, wherewith they may make the sayde hyl∣locke of suche hardnesse, that it may seeme a strong pauement made of lyme and stone: and whereas I haue proued and cau∣sed some of them to be broken, I haue founde them of such hard∣nesse, as yf I had not seene I could not haue beleeued, insomuch that they coulde scarcely be broken with pykes of Iron, so strong fortresses doo these litle beastes make for theyr sauegard against theyr aduersarie the Beare, who is chiefely nouryshed by them, and geuen them as an enimie, accordyng to the common pro∣uerbe whiche sayeth, <HI>Non e alcuna persona si libera, a chimanchi il suo Bargello,</HI> that is, there is no man so free, that hath not his per∣secutor or priuie enimie. And here when I consyder the mar∣ueilous prouidence whiche nature hath geuen to these litle bo∣dies, I cal to remembrance the wittie sentence of Plinie, where speakyng of such litle beastes, he sayeth thus, Why do we mar∣ueile at the Towrebearyng shoulders of Elephantes, and not rather where nature hath placed so many senses &amp; such industrye in such litle bodies? Where is hearing, smelling, seeing, and fee∣lyng, yea, where are the vaynes and arteries (without which no beast can lyue or moue) in these so litle bodies, whereof some are so small that theyr whole bodies can scarsly be seene of our eyes: What shall we then saye of the partes of the same? Yet euen a∣mong these there are many of such sagasitie and industry, as the like is not seene in beastes of greater quantitie, no nor yet in man. &amp;c. But to returne to the history. This enimie whiche na∣ture hath geuen to these litle beastes, vseth this maner to assayle them: When he resorteth to the hyllocke where the Antes lie hid as in theyr fortresse, he putteth his tongue to one of the ryftes whereof we haue spoken, being as subtile as the edge of a sword, and therewith contynuall lickyng, maketh the place moyst, the fome and froth of his mouth beyng of suche propertie, that by contynuall lickyng the place, it enlargeth the ryft in such sort by litle and litle, that at the length he easely putteth in his tongue, whiche he hath very long and thynne, and muche disproportio∣nate to his bodie, and when he hath thus made free passage for his tongue into the hyllocke, to put it easely in and out at his pleasure, then he thrusteth it into the hole as farre as he can reache, and so letteth it rest a good space, vntyll a great quan∣titie
<PB N="201" REF="211"/>
of the Antes (whose nature reioyceth in heate and moyster) haue laden his tongue, and as many as he can conteyne in the ho∣lownesse thereof, at which tyme hee sodeynly draweth it into his mouth, and eateth them, and returneth agayne to the same prac∣tise immediatly, vntyll he haue eaten as many as him lysteth, or as long as he can reache any with his tongue. The fleshe of this beast, is filthy and vnsauery, but by reason of the extreme shyftes and necessitie that the Christian men were put to at theyr fyrst commyng into these partes, they were inforced to proue all thin∣ges, and so fell to the eatyng of these beastes: but when they had found more delycate meates, they fel into hatred with this. These Antes haue thappearance of the place of theyr entraunce into the hyllocke, vnder the grounde, and this at so litle a hole, that it coulde hardely be founde, if certayne of them were not seene to passe in and out: but by this way the Beares could haue no suche power to hurte them as aboue at the sayde ryftes, as I haue sayde. There is an other strange beast, whiche by a name of contrary effecte, the Spanyardes call <HI>Cagnuolo leggiero,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange beast which seemeth a kind of Cameleon.</NOTE> that is, the lyght dogge, whereas it is one of the slowest beastes in the world, and so heauy and dull in mouyng, that it can scarse∣ty goe fyftie pases in a whole day: these beastes are in the firme lande, and are very strange to beholde for the disproporti∣on that they haue to all other beastes, they are about two spannes in length when they are growne to theyr full byggenesse, but when they are very young, they are somewhat more grosse then long: they haue foure subtile feete, and in euery of them foure clawes lyke vnto byrdes, and ioyned togeather, yet are nother theyr clawes or their feete able to susteyne theyr bodyes from the grounde, by reason whereof, and by the heauynesse of theyr bo∣dyes, they drawe theyr bellyes on the grounde: theyr neckes are hygh and streyght, and all equall lyke the pestle of a mor∣ter, which is altogeather equall euen vnto the toppe, without ma∣kyng any proportion or similitude of a head, or any dyfference except in the noddle, and in the toppes of theyr neckes: they haue very rounde faces muche lyke vnto Owles, and haue a marke of theyr owne heare after the maner of a cyrcle, which maketh theyr faces seeme somewhat more long then large: they haue small eyes and rounde, and nostrylles lyke vnto Munkeys:
<PB REF="212"/>
they haue litle mouthes, and moue theyr <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eckes from one syde to an other, as though they were astonyshed: theyr chiefe desyre and delyghte is to cleaue and sticke fast vnto trees, or some other thyng whereby they may clyme aloft, and therefore for the most parte, these beastes are founde vppon trees, wherevnto cleauyng fast, they mount vp by litle and litle, staying them selues by theyr long clawes: the colour of theyr heare, is be∣tweene russet and whyte, and of the proper colour of the heare of a Wesell: they haue no tayles, and theyr voyce is much diffe∣ryng from other beastes, for they syng onely in the nyght, and that continually from tyme to tyme, syngyng euer syxe notes one hygher then an other, so fallyng with the same, that the first note is the hyghest, and the other in a baser tune, as if a man shoulde say <HI>La, sol, fa, mi, re, vt,</HI> so this beast sayeth, <HI>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</HI> And doubtlesse, it seemeth vnto mee, that as I haue sayde in the Chapter of the beast called <HI>Bardati,</HI> that those beastes myght bee the original and document to imbarbe horses: euen so, the fyrst inuention of musycke myght seeme by the hea∣ryng of this beast, to haue the fyrst principles of that science, ra∣ther then by any other thyng in the worlde. But now to returne to the hystorie. I say that in a shorte space after this beast hath song, and hath paused a whyle, shee returneth agayne to the selfe same song, and doeth this onely in the nyght, and not in the day: By reason whereof, and also because of her euyll sight, I thynke her to bee a nyght beast, and the friende of darkenesse. Sometymes the Christian men fynde these beastes, and bryng them home to theyr houses, where also they creepe all about with theyr naturall slownesse, insomuch that nother for threatnyng or pryckyng they will moue any faster then theyr naturall and ac∣customed pase. And if they fynde any trees, they creepe thither immediatly, and mount to the toppe of the hyghest braunche thereof, where they remayne continually for the space of eyght, or tenne, or twentie dayes, without eatyng of any thyng, as farre as any man can iudge. And whereas I my selfe haue kept them in my house, I coulde neuer perceyue other but that they lyue onely of ayre, and of the same opinion are in maner all men of those regions, because they haue neuer seene them eate a∣ny thyng, but euer turne theyr heades and mouthes towarde
<PB N="202" REF="212"/>
that parte where the wynde bloweth most, whereby may be con∣sydered that they take most pleasure in the ayre. They byte not, nor yet can byte, hauyng very litle mouthes: they are not veno∣mous or noyous any way, but altogeather brutyshe, and vtterly vnprofitable, and without commoditie yet knowen to men, sa∣uyng onely to moue theyr myndes to contemplate the infynite power of God, who delyghteth in the varietie of creatures, wher∣by appeareth the power of his incomprehensible wysedome and maiestie, so farre to exceede the capacitie of mans vnderstanding. In these regions there are lykewyse founde certayne foules or byrdes, which the Indians call <HI>Alcatraz</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foules, and byrdes.</NOTE> these are muche byg∣ger then Geese,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alcatraz.</HI></NOTE> the greatest parte of theyr feathers are of rus∣set colour, and in some partes yelowe, theyr bylles or beakes are of two spannes in length, and very large neare to the head, and growyng small towarde the poynte, they haue great and large throtes, and are muche lyke to a foule which I sawe in Flaun∣ders in Brusselles in your maiesties pallace, whiche the Fle∣mynges call <HI>Haina:</HI> And I remember that when your maie∣stie dyned one day in your great hall, there was brought to your maiesties presence a Cauderne of water with certayne fyshes alyue, whiche the sayde foule dyd eate vp whole, and I thynke veryly that that foule was a foule of the sea, because shee had feete lyke foules of the water, as haue also these <HI>Alcatrazi,</HI> which are lykewyse foules of the sea, and of suche greatnesse, that I haue seene a whole coate of a man put into the throates of one of them in <HI>Panama,</HI> in the yeere .1521. And forasmuche as in that coast of <HI>Panama,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Panama,</HI></NOTE> there passeth and fleeth a great multi∣tude of these <HI>Alcatrazi,</HI> beyng a thyng very notable, I wyll de∣clare the maner heereof, as not onely I, but also dyuers other nowe present in your maiesties courte haue often tymes seene. Your maiestie shall therefore vnderstande, that in this place (as I haue sayde before) the sea of <HI>Sur</HI> ryseth and falleth two leagues and more from syxe houres to syxe houres: so that when it increaseth, the water of the sea arryueth so neare to the houses of <HI>Panama,</HI> as doeth our sea (called <HI>Mare Mediteraneum</HI>) in Barzalona, or in Naples: and when the sayd increasing of the sea commeth, there commeth also therewith suche a multitude of the smal fishes called Sardines, that it is so marueilous a thing to
<PB REF="213"/>
beholde, that no man would beleeue it that hath not seene it. In∣somuch that the <HI>Cacique</HI> (that is) the kyng of that lande, at such tyme as I dwelt there, was bounde dayly, as he was commaun∣ded by your maiesties gouernour, to bryng ordinarily three ca∣noas or barkes full of the sayde Sardynes, and to vnlade the same in the market place, whiche were afterwarde by the ru∣ler of the citie diuided among the Christian men, without any coste or charge to any of them: Insomuche that if the people had been a much greater multitude then they were, and as ma∣ny as are at this present in <HI>Toledo,</HI> or more, and had none other thyng to lyue by, they myght haue been sufficiently susteyned by these Sardynes, besyde the ouerplus which should haue re∣mayned. But to returne to the foules, whereof we haue spo∣ken. As the sea commeth, and the Sardynes with the same, euen so lykewyse come the sayde <HI>Alcatrazzi</HI> therewith, and flee continually ouer it, in such a multytude, that they appeare to co∣uer the vpper parte or floore of the water, and thus continue in mountyng and fallyng from the ayre to the water, and from the water to the ayre, duryng all the tyme of their fishing: and assoone as they haue taken any of these Sardines, they flee aboue the wa∣ters, and eate them incontinently, and sodeynly returne agayne to the water for more, continuing thus course by course without ceassyng▪ in lyke maner when the sea falleth, they folowe theyr fy∣shyng as I haue sayde. There goeth also in the company of these foules, an other kynde of foules, called <HI>Coda inforcata,</HI> (that is) the forked tayle, whereof I haue made mention before, &amp; assoone as the <HI>Alcatraz</HI> mounteth from the water with her pray of the Sardynes, sodeynly this <HI>Coda inforcata</HI> gyueth her so many strokes, and so persecuteth her, that shee causeth her to let fall the Sardynes which shee hath in her mouth: the which assoone as they are falne, and before they yet touche the water, the <HI>Coda inforcata</HI> catcheth them euen in the fall, in suche sorte, that it is a great pleasure to beholde the combat betweene them all the day long. The number of these <HI>Alcatrazzi</HI> is suche, that the Christian men are accustomed to sende to certayne Ilandes and rockes which are neare about <HI>Panama,</HI> with theyr boates or bar∣kes to take these <HI>Alcatrazzi,</HI> whyle they are yet young, and can not flee, and kyll as many of them with staues as they will, vntyll
<PB N="203" REF="213"/>
they haue therewith laden theyr Barkes or Canoas: these young ones are so fat and well fedde, that they can not bee eaten, and are taken for none other intent, but onely to make grease for candles to burne in the nyght, for the whiche purpose it serueth very well, and gyueth a cleare lyght, and burneth easily. After this maner, and for this purpose, innumerable of them are kyld: &amp; yet it seemeth that the number of them that fyshe for Sardynes doe dayly increase. There are other foules called <HI>Passere sem∣pie,</HI> that is, simple sparowes:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Passere sem∣pie.</HI></NOTE> these are somewhat lesse then Seamewes, and haue theyr feete lyke vnto great Malardes, and stande in the water sometymes, and when the shyppes sayle fyftie or a hundred leagues about the Ilandes, these foules be∣holdyng the shyppes commyng towarde them, breake theyr flyght, and fall downe vpon the sayle yardes, mastes, and ca∣bles thereof, and are so simple and folyshe, that they tary vn∣tyll they may easily bee taken with mens handes, and were ther∣fore called of the maryners simple sparowes: they are blacke, and vppon theyr blacke, haue theyr head and shoulders of feathers of a darke russet colour: they are not good to bee eaten, although the maryners haue sometymes been inforced to eate them. There is an other kynde of byrdes in the firme land, which the Christians call <HI>Picuti,</HI> because they haue very great beakes, in respecte of the litlenesse of theyr bodyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Picuti.</HI></NOTE> for theyr beakes are very heauy, and waye more then theyr whole bodyes be∣syde: these byrdes are no bygger then Quayles, but haue a muche greater bushement of feathers, insomuche that theyr fea∣thers are more then theyr bodyes: theyr feathers are very fayre, and of many variable coloures, theyr beakes are a quarter of a yarde in length or more, and bendyng downe toward the earth, and three fyngers brode neare vnto the head: theyr tongues are very quylles, wherewith they make a great hyssyng: they make holes in trees with theyr beakes, in the which they make their neastes. And surely these byrdes are marueylous to beholde, for the great dyfference whiche they haue from all other byrdes that I haue seene, aswell for theyr tongues (which are quylles as I haue sayd) as also for the strangenesse of their sight, &amp; dispro∣portion of their great beaste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in respect of the rest of their bodies. There are no byrdes found that prouide better for the safegard of
<PB REF="214"/>
theyr young in the tyme of theyr breedyng, to be without daun∣ger of wylde cattes, that they enter not into theyr neastes to de∣stroy their egges or young, and this aswell by the strange maner of buyldyng their nestes, as also by theyr owne defence: and ther∣fore when they perceyue that the cattes approche towarde them, they enter into theyr nestes, and holdyng theyr beakes towarde the entraunce of the same, stande at theyr defence, and so vexe the cattes, that they cause them to leaue their enterpryse. There are also other byrdes or sparowes, which the Christians by con∣trary effecte call <HI>Matti,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Folyshe spa∣rowes.</NOTE> that is fooles: Whereas neuerthelesse there is no byrde that sheweth more wyt and crafte in defendyng her young from peryl. These byrdes are litle, &amp; in maner blacke, and somewhat bygger then our Thrushes, they haue certayne whyte feathers in theyr neckes, and the lyke sagasitie or sharpe∣nesse of sense as haue the byrdes or Pyes called <HI>Gazzuole,</HI> they sildome tymes lyght vppon the earth: they make theyr nestes in trees separated from other, because the wylde cattes (called <HI>Mammoni</HI>) are accustomed to leape from tree to tree, not dis∣cendyng to the grounde for feare of other beastes, except when they are enforced by thirst to come downe to drinke, at such times as they are sure not to bee molested, and for this cause doe not these byrdes make theyr nestes but in trees farre diuided from o∣ther, they make them of a cubite in length, or more, after the maner of bagges or litle sackes, large at the bottome, and grow∣yng narower and narower towarde the mouth, whereby they are fastened, hauyng the hole whereat they enter into the sacke, of suche byggenesse as may onely suffyce to receyue them. And to the ende that the cattes may not deuour theyr young, if they chaunce to mount vppon the trees where they haue theyr nestes, they vse an other craft, which is, to make theyr nestes in thicke braunches of trees, and to defende the same with sharpe and strong thornes, implicate and set in suche order, that no ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is able to make the lyke, so that the cattes can by no meanes put theyr legges into the hole of the neaste to take out the young byrdes, as well for the sharpenesse of the thornes, as also for the deapth of the nestes, in the bottome wherof, the young birds rest without daunger of their enimie: for some of theyr nestes beyng
<PB N="204" REF="214"/>
three or foure spannes in length, the legge of the catte can not reache to the bottome thereof. They vse also an other pollicie, which is, to make many of theyr neastes in one tree, the which they doe for one of these two causes: that is, that eyther of theyr owne naturall disposition they are accustomed to goe in great multitudes, and reioyce in the company of theyr owne generati∣on, as doe the byrdes whiche wee call Stares, or els to the in∣tent that if it should so chaunce that the cattes shoulde clyme the trees where they make theyr neastes, they myght bee a greater company to resyst and molest the cattes, at whose approch they make a fearefull and terrible crye, whereby the cattes are put to flight. Furthermore, in the fyrme lande, and in the Ilandes, there are certayne byrdes called <HI>Piche,</HI> or <HI>Gazzuole,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cazzuole.</HI></NOTE> somewhat lyke vnto those which we call Woodwalles, or Woodpeckes, beyng lesse then ours of Spayne: these are altogeather blacke, and goe hoppyng and leapyng, theyr beakes are also blacke, and of the same fashion as are the Popingiays beakes, they haue long tay∣les, and are somewhat bygger then Stares. There are other byrdes called <HI>Pintadelli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pintadelli.</HI></NOTE> which are lyke vnto certayne greene byr∣des, which the Italyans call <HI>Fringuelli,</HI> and are of seuen colours: these byrdes for feare of the cattes, are euer wont to make theyr neastes ouer the bankes of ryuers, or the sea, where the braunches of trees so reache ouer the water that with a litle weyght they may bowe downe to the water: theyr neastes are made so neare the toppes of the braunches, that when the cattes come thereon, the braunches bende towarde the water, and the cattes turne backe agayne for feare of fallyng: For al∣though no beast in the worlde bee more malicious then this, yet whereas the most parte of beastes are naturally inclyned to swymme, this catte hath no maner of aptenesse therevnto, and is therefore soone drowned or strangeled in the water, and by a priuie sense of nature feareth the danger which he can not escape. These byrdes make their nestes in such sort, that although they be we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te and filled with water, yet doe they so sodeynly ryse vp a∣gayne, that the young byrdes are not thereby hurt or drowned.

or cotton of the gossampine trees. The fruite which is in the myddest of the sayde towe, is (as I haue sayde) as bygge as a mans fyst, and sometymes twyse as bygge, and more: It is in fourme lyke vnto a walnutte, or some other rounde thyng, somewhat more long then large, and very harde, the rynde or barke hereof, is as thycke as the cyrcle of letters of a ryall of plate, and within, there cleaueth fast to the rynde of the nutte a carnositie or substaunce of coornel, of the thyckenesse of halfe a fynger, or of the least fynger of the hande, and is very whyte, lyke vnto a fayre Almonde, and of better taste and more plea∣saunt.

Suche as haue accustomed to drynke in these vesselles, and haue been troubled with the disease called the frettyng of the guttes, say that they haue by experience founde it a marueylous remedie agaynst that disease, and that it breaketh the stone, and prouoketh vrine. This fruite was called <HI>Cocus,</HI> for this cause, that when it is taken from the place where it cleaueth fast to the tree, there are seene two holes, and aboue them two other natural holes, whiche alto∣geather do represent the gesture and figure of the cattes called <HI>Mammoni,</HI> that is, Munkeys, when they crye, which crye the Indians call <HI>Coca,</HI> but in very deede, this tree is a kinde of Date trees, and hath the same effecte to heale frettyng of the guttes, that Plinie descrybeth all kynds of Date trees to haue. There are furthermore in the firme lande, trees of suche byggenesse that I dare not speake therof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great trees.</NOTE> but in place where I haue so ma∣ny wytnesses whiche haue seene the same as well as I.

And forasmuche as the said tree had line long there, and by y<SUP>e</SUP> great weight therof was so shronke downewarde, and partly couered with water, that none coulde passe ouer it, but were wette to the knee, I beyng then in the yeere .1522. the official or Iustice in that citie at your maiesties appoyntment, caused an other great tree to be layde in that place, whiche in lyke maner trauersed the ryuer, and reached more then fyftie foote ouer the further syde: This tree was exceeding great, and rested aboue the water more then two cubytes, in the fall, it cast downe all such other trees as

were within the reache thereof, and discouered certayne vynes, whiche were so laden with blacke grapes of pleasaunt taste, that they satysfied more then fyftye persons whiche ate theyr fyl there∣of. This tree in the thyckest part therof, was more then syxteene spannes thycke, and was neuerthelesse but litle in respect of ma∣ny other trees whiche are founde in this prouince. For the In∣dians of the coaste and prouince of <HI>Cartagenia,</HI> make barkes or boates thereof (which they call <HI>Canoas,</HI>) of suche byggenesse, be∣yng all one whole tree, that some conteyne a hundred men, some a hundred and thirtie, and some more, hauyng neuerthelesse such voyde space within the same, that there is left sufficient roome to passe to and fro throughout all the <HI>Canoas.</HI> Some of these are so large, besyde the length, that they conteyne more then ten or twelue spannes in breadth, and sayle with two sayles, as with the maister sayle and the tryncket, which they make of very good cotton. The greatest trees that I haue seene in these partes, or in any other regions, was in the prouince of <HI>Guaturo,</HI> the kyng wherof rebellyng from the obedience of your maiestie, was pursued by me, and taken prisoner: at whiche tyme I with my companye, passed ouer a very hygh mountayne, full of great trees, in the top whereof, we founde one tree, whiche had three rootes, or rather diuisions of the roote aboue the earth, in fourme of a tryangle, or treuet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A marueylous tree.</NOTE> so that betweene euery foote of this tri∣angle or three feete, there was a space of twentie foote betwene euery foote, and this of such heyght aboue the earth, that a laden Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of those wherewith they are accustomed to bryng home corne in the tyme of haruest in the kyngdome of <HI>Toledo</HI> in Spayne▪ myght easely haue passed through euery of those par∣titions or wyndowes which were betweene the three feete of the sayd tree.

<PB REF="217"/>
Among certayne Spaniardes whiche clymed this tree, I my selfe was one, and when I was ascended to the place where it begunne to spreade the braunches, it was a marueilous thyng to beholde a great countrey of suche trees towarde the prouince of Abrayme. This tree was easy to clyme, by reason of certayne <HI>Besuchi,</HI> (whereof I haue spoken before) which grew wreathed about the tree, in suche sort that they seemed to make a scalyng Ladder. Euery of the forsayd three feete whiche bore the bodie of the tree, was twentie spannes in thickenesse, and where they ioyned all togeather aboute the Trunke or bodie of the tree, the principall Trunke was more then fourtie and fyue spannes in circuite. I named the mountayne where these trees growe, the mountayne of three footed trees. And this whiche I haue now declared, was seene of all the companie that was there with me when (as I haue sayde before) I tooke kyng <HI>Guaturo</HI> pryso∣ner in the yeere .1522. Many thynges more myght heere be spoken as touching this matter, as also howe there are many o∣ther excellent trees founde of diuers sortes and dyfference, as sweete Cedar trees, blacke Date trees, and many other, of the whiche some are so heauye that they cannot floote aboue the wa∣ter, but syncke immediatly to the bottome, and other agayne as lyght as a Corke. As touchyng all which thynges I haue writ∣ten more largely in my generall historie of the Indies. And for∣asmuche as at this present I haue entred to entreat of trees, be∣fore I passe any further to other thynges, I wyll declare the ma∣ner howe the Indians kindle fyre, only with wood and without fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kyndlyng of fyre without fyre.</NOTE> the maner wherof is this. They take a peece of wood, of two spannes in length, as bygge as the least fynger of a mans hand, or as an arrowe well pullyshed, and of a strong kynde of wood which they keepe only for this purpose: and where they entend to kyndle any fire, they take two other peeces of wood, of the dryest and lyghtest that they can fynde, and bynde them fast togeather one with an other, as close as two fyngers ioyned: in the myddest or betweene these, they put the poynt of the fyrst litle staffe made of harde and strong woodde, whiche they hold in theyr handes by the toppe thereof, and turne or rubbe it rounde about contynually in one place betweene the two pee∣ces of woodde which lye bounde togeather vppon the earth,

These are certayne putrifyed trunkes, whiche haue lyne so long rottyng on the earth, that they are very whyte, and shyne in the nyght lyke burnyng fyrebrandes, and when the Spa∣nyardes fynde any of this woodde, and intende priuily in the nyght to make warre and inuade any prouince, when case so requyreth that it shalbe necessary to goe in the nyght, in such places where they knowe not the way, the formost Chri∣stian man whiche guydeth the way, associate with an Indian to directe hym therein, taketh a litle starre of the sayde woodde, whiche he putteth in his cappe, hangyng behynde on his shoul∣ders, by the lyght whereof he that foloweth next to hym, direc∣teth his iourney, who also in lyke maner beareth an other starre behynde hym, by the shynyng whereof the thyrde foloweth the same way, and in lyke maner do al the rest, so that by this meanes none are loste or stragle out of the way. And forasmuch as this lyght is not seene very farre, it is the better policie for the Christians, because they are not therby disclosed before they inuade theyr enimies.

So it is therfore, that in the firme land there are many sorts of reedes, so that in many places they make their houses thereof, coueryng them with the toppes of the same, and makyng theyr walles of them in lyke maner, as I haue sayde be∣fore: and among these kyndes of reedes, there is one so great, that the canes therof are as bigge as a mans legge in y<SUP>e</SUP> knee, and three spanns in length from ioynt to ioynt, or more, insomuch that euery of them is of capacitie to contayne a litle bucket of water. In this kynde, there are founde some greater, and some lesse, of the whiche some they vse to make quyuers for arrowes. There is founde an other kynde, whiche suerly is marueylous, beyng litle bygger then a Iauelyn, the canes whereof are longer then two spannes: these reedes growe one farre from an other, as some tymes twentie or thirtie pases, and sometymes also two or three leagues: they growe in maner in all prouynces in the

Indies, and growe neere to very hyghe trees, whereunto they leane, and creepe vp to the toppes of theyr braunches, whiche they imbrase, and discende agayne downe to the earth. Theyr canes are full of most cleare water, without any maner of tast or sauour, eyther of the canes, or of any other thyng, and suche as yf it were taken out of the freshest spryng in the worlde, nor yet is it knowen that euer it hurt any that drunke therof. For it hath oftentymes so chaunced, that as the Christian men haue tra∣uayled in these regions in desolate wayes, where for lacke of wa∣ter they haue been in great daunger to die for thirst, they haue es∣caped that peryl by reason that they founde the sayd reedes, of the water of whose canes they haue drunke a great quantitie, with∣out any hurt thereof ensuing. Therfore when they fynde these in any place, they make water vessels of the canes thereof, and carry as many of them full of water as may suffice for one dayes iorney: and sometime they cary so many, that they take for euery man two or three quartes of water, which may serue them for many dayes, because it doth not corrupt, but remayneth styll freshe and good.</P>
<P>There are also certayne plantes, whiche the Christians call <HI>Platani.</HI> These are as hygh as trees, and become as byg in the trunke as the knee of a man, or more.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Platani.</HI></NOTE> From the foote to the toppe, they beare certayne long and large leaues, beyng more then three spannes in largenesse, &amp; about ten or twelue in length: the whiche when they are broken of the wynde, the stalke remai∣neth whole in the myddest. In the myddest of this plant, in the highest part therof, there groweth a cluster with fourtie or fyftie platans about it, euery of them beyng a spanne and a halfe in length, and as byg as a mans arme in the small, or more, or lesse, accordyng to the goodnesse of the soyle where they growe: they haue a rynde not very thycke, and easye to be broken, beyng within altogeather ful of a substaunce lyke vnto the mary of the bone of an Oxe, as it appeareth when y<SUP>e</SUP> rinde or barke is taken from the same. This cluster ought to be taken from the plant, when any one of the platans begin to appeare yelowe, at which tyme they take it, and hang it in theyr houses, where all the cluster waxeth rype, with all his platans. This cluster is a very good fruite, and when it is opened, and the rynde taken

This trunke or spryg which bryngeth foorth the sayd cluster, is a whole yeere in grow∣ing and brynging foorth fruite, in which tyme it hath put foorth rounde about it ten or twelue sprygges, as bygge as the fyrst or principall, and multiplieth no lesse then the principall in bring∣ing foorth of clusters, with fruites lykewyse at theyr tyme, and also in bryngyng foorth other and many sprygges, as is sayde before. From the whiche sprygges or trunkes, as soone as the cluster of the fruite is taken away, the plant beginneth to drye and wyther, whiche then they take out of the grounde, because it doth none other then occupie it in vayne, and without profyte. They are so many, and do so marueylously encrease and multi∣plie, that it is a thyng in maner encredible. They are exceeding moyst, insomuch that when they are plucked vp from the place where they grow, there ishueth foorth a great quantitie of wa∣ter, aswel out of the plant, as out of the place where it grewe, in suche sort, that al the moysture of the earth farre about, myght seeme to be geathered togeather about the truncke or blocke of the sayd plant, with the fruites whereof, the Antes are so farre in loue, that they are seene in great multitudes in the braunches of the plantes: so that for the multitude thereof, it sometyme so chaunceth, that men are enforced to take away the plantes from theyr possession: these fruites are founde at al tymes of the yeere.

For on a tyme as I made water, and sawe the colour of my vrine, I entred into a great suspition of my lyfe, beyng so astonyshed for feare, that I thought the same had chaunced to mee vpon some other cause, insomuche that surely my imagina∣tion myght haue done mee hurte, but that they which were with mee dyd comforte mee immediatly, declaryng the cause thereof, as they knew by experience, beyng auncient inhabitours in those regions.

They make also certayne chestes, which they call <HI>Ha∣uas,</HI> weaued after a strange sorte,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hauas.</HI></NOTE> and intermyxt with the leaues of this <HI>Bihaos.</HI> These chestes are wrought in such sorte, that al∣though it rayne vpon them, or they chaunce to fall into the water, yet are not suche thinges wet as are within them: they are made of the branches of the sayde <HI>Bihaos,</HI> with the leaues weaued to∣geather therewith: In these they keepe salte, and other subtile thinges. They vse them also for an other purpose, which is this: that fyndyng them in the fieldes at such tyme as they haue scarse∣nesse of vittayles, they dyg vp the rootes of these plantes while they are yet young, or eate the plant it selfe, in that parte where it is most tender, which is from a foote vnder the grounde, where it is as tender and whyte as a reede or bulrushe. And forasmuche as wee are nowe come to the ende of this narration, it commeth to my remembraunce to make mention of an other thyng, which is not farre from my purpose: and this is, howe the Indians doe slayne or dye cloath of bombage cotton, or any other thyng whiche they in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ende to dye, of dyuers colours, as blacke, tawny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dying of cot∣ton.</NOTE> greene, blewe, yelow, and redde, which they doe with the barkes,

<P>After that I haue sayde thus much of trees and plants, I haue thought good also to speake somewhat of hearbes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An hearbe that beareth cordes.</NOTE> You shal ther∣fore vnderstand, that in these Indies there is an hearbe much like vnto a yelow Lilie, about whose leaues there growe and creepe certayne cordes or lases, as the lyke is partly seene in the hearbe which we call lased sauery, but these of the Indies are much big∣ger, and longer, and so strong that they tye theyr hangyng beds thereby, whiche they call <HI>Hamacas,</HI> whereof we haue spoken elsewhere: these cordes they call <HI>Cabuia,</HI> and <HI>Henequen,</HI> whiche are all one thyng,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabuia and Henequen.</HI></NOTE> sauyng that <HI>Henequen</HI> is lesse and of a fyner substance, as it were line, and the other is grosser, lyke the weeke or twyst of hempe, and is imperfect in comparison to the other: they are of colour betweene whyte and yelow, lyke vnto abarne, and some also whyte.

I can not well determyne whether they be trees, or plantes: they haue certayne branches full of large and deformed leaues, which branches were fyrst leaues lyke vnto the other.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the sea coastes of the firme lande, there are dyuers &amp; sundry kyndes of fishes, muche differing in shape &amp; fourme. And although it be impossible to speake of all, yet will I make mention of some. And first to begin at Sardines, you shall vnderstand that there is found a kinde of these fishes very large and with red tayles, being a very delicate fyshe. The best kyndes of o∣ther fishes are these, <HI>Moxarre, Diahace,</HI> Brettes, <HI>Dahaos,</HI> Thorne∣backes, &amp; Salmons: All these, and dyuers other which I doe not now remember, are taken in great quantitie in ryuers.

<PB N="212" REF="222"/>
not be expressed without large wrytyng and long tyme. But to let passe to intreate particulerly of the multitude of fyshes, I in∣tende to speake chiefely, and somewhat largely, of three sortes of most notable fyshes: whereof the fyrst is, the great Tortoyses, the seconde is called <HI>Tiburon,</HI> and the thyrd <HI>Manate.</HI> And to begin at the fyrst, I say that in the Ilande of <HI>Cuba,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Tortoy∣ses.</NOTE> are found great Tor∣toyses (which are certayne shell fyshes) of suche byggenesse that tenne or fyfteene men are scarsely able to lyfte one of them out of the water, as I haue been infourmed of credible persons dwel∣lyng in the same Iland. But of that which I my selfe haue seene, I can testifie, that in the fyrme lande, in the village of <HI>Acla,</HI> there are of this sort some taken and kylled of suche byggenesse, that syxe men with muche difficultie coulde scarsely drawe them out of the water, and commonly the least sort of them are as much as two men may carry at a burden: that whiche I sawe lyfted vp by syxe men, had her shell a yarde and a quarter in length, and in breadth more then fyue yardes. The maner of takyng them, is this: It sometymes chaunceth that in theyr great nettes (whiche they call shoote nettes) there are founde certayne Tor∣toyses of the common sort, in great quantities, and when they come out of the sea, and bryng foorth theyr egges, and goe to∣geather by companyes from the sea, to feede on the lande, the Christians or Indians folowe theyr steppes which they fynde in the sande, and soone ouertake them, because they are very heauy and slowe in goyng, although they make all the hast they can to returne to the sea, assoone as they espie any bodie. When they that pursue them haue ouertaken them, they put a stake or staffe vnder theyr legges, and ouerturne them on theyr backes as they are yet runnyng, so that they can goe no further, nor yet ryse a∣gayne or turne, and thus they suffer them to lye styll whyle they folowe after the rest, which they ouerturne in lyke maner: and by this meanes take very many, at suche tymes as they come foorth of the sea as I haue sayde: This fyshe is very excellent and hol∣some to be eaten, and of good tast. The seconde of the three fyshes wherof I haue spoken, is the <HI>Tiburon:</HI> this is a very great fyshe, and very quycke and swyft in the water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tiburons.</NOTE> and a cruell de∣uourer: these are oftentymes taken, aswell when the shippes are vnder sayle in the Ocean, as also when they lye at anker, or at
<PB REF="223"/>
any other tyme, and especially the leaste kynde of these fyshes. When the shyppes are vnder sayle, the byggest sorte are taken after this maner. When the <HI>Tiburon</HI> seeth the shyppe saylyng, he foloweth it swymmyng behynde, the whiche thinges the mari∣ners seeyng, cast foorth all the fylth of the shyppe into the sea for the fyshe to eate, who neuerthelesse foloweth them with equall pase, although they make neuer suche haste with full wynde and sayles, and waloweth on euery syde and about the shyp, and thus foloweth it sometyme for the space of a hundred &amp; fyftie leagues, and more, and when the mariners are disposed to take them, they cast downe by the sterne of the shyppe a hooke of Iron, as bygge as the byggest fynger of a mans hande, of three spannes in length, and crooked lyke a fyshehooke, with beardes accor∣dyng to the bygnesse thereof, and fastened to an Iron cheyne of fyue or syxe lynkes neare vnto the ende, and from thence tyed with a great rope, fastnyng also on the hooke for a bayte, a peece of some fyshe, or hogges fleshe, or some other flesh, or the bowels and intralles of an other <HI>Tiburon</HI> which they haue taken before, whiche may easily be done, for I haue seene niene taken in one day, and if they would haue taken more, they myght also. Thus when the <HI>Tiburon</HI> hath pleasauntly folowed the shyppe a long viage, at the length he swaloweth the bayte with the hooke, and aswell by his stryuyng to flee or escape, as also by the swyft pas∣sage of the shyppe, the hooke ouerthwarteth and catcheth holde of his chappes: the whiche fyshe when it is taken, it is of such huge byggenesse, that twelue or fyfteene men are scarsely able to drawe it out of the water, and lyft it into the shyppe, where one of the mariners gyueth it many knockes on the head with a club or beetle, vntyll hee haue slayne it: they are sometymes founde of tenne or twelue foote long, and of fyue, sixe, or seuen spannes in breadth, where they are brodest: they haue very great and wyde mouthes, to the proportion of the rest of theyr bodyes, and haue two rowes of teeth, the one somewhat separate from the other, of cruell shape, and standyng very thycke. When they haue slayne this fyshe, they cut the body thereof in small peeces, and put it to drye, hangyng it three or foure dayes at the cordes of the sayle clothes to drye in the wynde, and then eate it: It is doubtlesse a good fyshe, and of great commoditie to serue
<PB N="213" REF="223"/>
the shyppes for vitalles for many dayes: the leaste of these fyshes are most holesome and tender, it hath a skynne muche lyke to the skynne of a Sole whereunto the sayd <HI>Tiburon</HI> is like in shape: Whiche I saye, because Plinie hath made mention of none of these three fyshes, among the number of them wher∣of he writeth in his natural hystorie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinie.</NOTE> These <HI>Tiburons</HI> come foorth of the sea, and enter into the ryuers, where they are no lesse perylous then great Lisartes or Crocodiles, wherof I haue spoken largely before: For they deuoure men, kyne, and horses, euen as do the Crocodiles:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crocodiles.</NOTE> they are very daungerous in cer∣tayne washyng places or pooles by the ryuers sydes, and where they haue deuoured at other tymes. Dyuers other fyshes both great and small, of sundry sortes and kyndes, are accustomed to folowe the shyppes goyng vnder sayle, of the whiche I wyll speake somwhat when I haue written of <HI>Manate,</HI> whiche is the thyrde of the three wherof I haue promised to entreate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manates.</NOTE> <HI>Manate</HI> therefore, is a fyshe of the sea, of the byggest sorte, and muche greater then the <HI>Tiburon</HI> in length and breadth, and is very bruityshe and vyle, so that it appeareth in fourme lyke vnto one of those great vesselles made of goates skynnes, wherin they vse to cary newe wyne in <HI>Medina de Campo,</HI> or in <HI>Areualo</HI>: the head of this beast is lyke the head of an Oxe, with also like eyes, and hath in the place of armes, two great stumpes wherwith he swymmeth: It is a very gentle and tame beast, and commeth of∣tentimes out of the water to the next shore, where if he fynd any hearbes or grasse, he feedeth therof. Our men are accustomed to kyl many of these, and diuers other good fyshes, with their cros∣bowes, pursuing them in barkes or Canoas, because they swim in maner aboue the water: the which thyng when they see, they drawe them with a hooke tyde at a small corde, but somewhat strong: As the fyshe fleeth away, the archer letteth go, and pro∣longeth the corde by litle and litle, vntyll he haue let it go many fathams: at the ende of the corde, there is tyde a corke, or a peece of lyght woodde, and when the fyshe is gone a litle way, and hath coloured the water with his blood, and feeleth hym selfe to faynt and drawe towarde the ende of his lyfe, he resor∣teth to the shore, and the archer foloweth, geatheryng vp his corde, wherof whyle there yet remayne syxe or eyght fathams, or

somewhat more or lesse, he draweth it towarde the lande, and draweth the fyshe therewith by litle and litle, as the waues of the sea helpe hym to do it the more easly: then, with the helpe of the rest of his companie, he lyfteth this great beaste out of the water to the lande, beyng of suche byggenesse, that to con∣uey it from thence to the citie, it shalbe requisite to haue a carte with a good yoke of Oxen, and sometymes more, accordyng as these fyshes are of byggenesse, some being much greater then other some in the same kinde, as is seene of other beastes: Som∣tymes they lyft these fyshes into the Canoa or barke, without drawyng them to the lande as before, for as soone as they are slayne, they flote aboue the water: And I beleeue veryly that this fyshe is one of the best in the worlde to the tast, and the lyke∣est vnto fleshe, especially so lyke vnto beefe, that who so hath not seene it whole, can iudge it to be none other when he seeth it in peeces then very beefe or veale, and is certaynly so lyke vnto fleshe, that all the men in the world may herein be deceyued: the tast likewise, is like vnto the tast of very good veale, and lasteth long, yf it be powdred: so that in fine, the Base of these parts, is by no meanes lyke vnto this.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fyshe Manate.</NOTE> This <HI>Manate</HI> hath a certayne stone, or rather bone in his head within the brayne, whiche is of qualitie greatly appropriate agaynst the disease of the stone, if it be burnt and grounde into small powder, and taken fastyng in the morning when the paine is felte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remedy a∣gaynst the stone.</NOTE> in such quantitie as may lye vppon a peny, with a draught of good whyte wyne: For be∣ing thus taken three or foure mornings, it acquieteth the greefe, as dyuers haue tolde me whiche haue proued it true, and I my selfe by testimonie of syght, do wytnesse that I haue seene this stone sought of dyuers for this effecte.</P>
<P>There are also dyuers other fyshes as bygge as this <HI>Ma∣nate,</HI> among the whiche there is one called <HI>Vihuella.</HI> This fyshe beareth in the toppe of his head a swoorde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The swoorde fyshe.</NOTE> beyng on euery syde full of many sharpe teeth, this swoorde is natu∣rally very harde and strong, of foure or fyue spannes in length, and of proportion accordyng to the same byggenesse: and for this cause is this fyshe called <HI>Spada,</HI> that is, the swoorde fyshe. Of this kynde some are founde as litle as Sardines, and other so great, that two yokes of Oxen are scarsely able to drawe

them on a Cart. But whereas before I haue promised to speake of other fyshes, whiche are taken in these seas whyle the shyppes are vnder sayle, I wyll not forgeat to speake of the Tunnye, whiche is a great and good fyshe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tunnye.</NOTE> and is oftentymes taken and kylde with trout speares, and hookes, cast in the water, when they play and swym about the shyppes. In lyke maner also are taken many Turbuts, whiche are very good fyshes as are lyghtly in all the sea. And here is to be noted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turbut.</NOTE> that in the great Ocean sea, there is a strange thyng to be consydered, whiche all that haue been in the Indies affirme to be true:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> And this is, that lyke as on the lande there are some prouinces fer∣tyle and fruitfull, and some barren, euen so doth the lyke chaunce in the sea: So that at some wyndes the shyppes sayle fyftie, or a hundred, or two hundred leagues and more, without takyng or seeyng of one fyshe: and agayne, in the selfe same Ocean in some places, all the water is seene tremble by the mouyng of the fyshes, where they are taken abundantly. It commeth further to my remembraunce to speake somewhat of the fleeyng of fyshes, whiche is doubtlesse a strange thyng to beholde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fleeyng fyshes.</NOTE> and is after this maner. When the shyppes sayle by the great O∣cean, folowyng theyr viage, there ryseth sometymes on the one syde or on the other, many companies of certayne litle fyshes, of the whiche the byggest is no greater then a Sardyne, and so diminishe lesse and lesse from that quantitie, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome of them are very litle: these are called <HI>Volatori,</HI> that is, fleeyng fyshes: they ryse by great companies and flockes, in suche multitudes that it is an astonyshment to behold them: Some∣times they ryse but litle from the water, &amp; (as it chaunceth) con∣tinue one flyght for the space of an hundred paces, and sometimes more, or lesse, before they fall agayne into the sea, sometymes also they fall into the shyppes. And I remember, that on an euenyng when al the company in the shyp were on theyr knees, syngyng <HI>Salue regina</HI> in the hyghest part of the Castell of the poupe, and sayled with a full wynde, there passed by vs a flocke of these fleeyng fyshes, and came so neare vs, that many of them fell into the shyppe, among the whiche, two or three fel hard by me, whiche I tooke alyue in my hand, so that I myght well perceyue that they were as bygge as Sardines, and of the same
<PB REF="225"/>
quantitie, hauyng two wynges or quilles growing out of theyr synnes, lyke vnto those wherewith all fyshes swym in ryuers: these wynges are as long as the fyshes them selues. As long as theyr wynges are moyst, they beare them vp in the ayre, but assoone as they are drye, they can contynue theyr flyght no further then as I haue sayde before, but fall immediatlye into the sea, and so ryse agayne, and flee as before from place to place. In the yeere a thousand, fyue hundred, and fyfteene, when I came fyrst to enfourme your Maiestie of the state of the thynges in India, and was the yeere folowyng in Flaun∣ders in the tyme of your most fortunate successe in these your kyngdomes of Aragonie and Castyle, whereas at that viage I sayled aboue the Ilande <HI>Bermuda,</HI> otherwyse called <HI>Garza,</HI> beyng the furthest of all the Ilandes that are founde at this daye in the worlde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Iland of Bermuda</NOTE> and arryuyng there at the deapth of eyght yardes of water, and distaunt from the lande as farre as the shotte of a peece of Ordinaunce, I determyned to sende some of the shyp to lande, aswell to make searche of suche thynges as were there, as also to leaue in the Iland certayne Hogges for en∣crease. But the tyme not seruing my purpose by reason of con∣trary wynde, I coulde bryng my shyppes no nearer the Ilande, beyng twelue leagues in length, and syxe in breadth, and about thyrtie in circuite, lying in the three and thyrtieth degree of the North syde. Whyle I remayned heere, I saw a stryfe and com∣bat betweene these fleeing fyshes, and the fyshes named Gylt heades, &amp; the foules called Seamewes, and Cormorantes, which surely seemed vnto me a thyng of as great pleasure and solace as coulde be deuised, while the Gylt heades swam on the brymme of the water, and sometymes lyfted theyr shoulders aboue the same, to rayse the fleeyng fyshes out of the water to dryue them to flyght, and folowe them swymmyng to the place where they fal, to take and eate them sodenly. Againe on the other side, the Seamewes and Cormorantes, take many of these flee∣yng fyshes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to hie for the Pye, nor to lowe for the Crowe.</NOTE> so that by this meanes they are neyther safe in the ayre, nor in the water.

<HEAD>Of the strayght or narrowe passage of the land lying betweene the North and South sea, by the which spyces may much sooner and easlyer be brought from the Ilandes of <HI>Molucca</HI> into Spaine by the VVest Ocean, then by that way whereby the Portugales sayle into the East India.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T hath been an opinion among the Cosmo∣graphers and Pilottes of late tyme, and o∣ther whiche haue had practyse in thynges touchyng the sea, that there shoulde be a strayght of water passing from the North sea of the fyrme, into the South sea of <HI>Sur,</HI> which neuerthelesse hath not been seene nor founde to this day. And surely yf there be any such strayght, we that inhabite those partes do thynke the same should be rather of land then of water. For the fyrme land in some partes thereof is so strayght and narrowe, that the Indians say that from the mountaynes of the prouince of <HI>Esquegua</HI> or <HI>Vrraca</HI> (which are betweene the one sea and the other) if a man ascend to the top of the mountaines, and looke toward the North,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esquegua and Vrraca.</NOTE> he may see the wa∣ter of the North sea of the prouince of <HI>Beragua:</HI> &amp; againe looking the contrary way, may on the other syde (towards the South) see the sea of <HI>Sur,</HI> and the prouinces which confine with it, as do the territories of the two Lordes or kynges of the sayde prouin∣ces of <HI>Vrraca</HI> and <HI>Esquegua.</HI> And I beleeue, that yf it be as the Indians say, of all that is hytherto knowen, this is the narrow∣est strayght of the fyrme land, whiche some affirme to be full of rough mountaynes. Yet do I take it for a better way, or soo short as is that whiche is made from the port called <HI>Nomen Dei</HI> (whiche is in the North sea) vnto the newe citie of <HI>Panama,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nomen Dei.</HI></NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Panama.</HI></NOTE> be∣yng in the coast and on the bancke of the sea of <HI>Sur,</HI> whiche way is lykewyse very rough, full of thycke wooddes, mountay∣nes, ryuers, valleyes, and very difficult to passe through, and can not be done without great labour &amp; trauaile. Some measure this way in this part, to be from sea to sea eighteene leagues, whiche I suppose to be rather twentie, not for that it is any more by measure, but because it is rough and difficult, as I haue
<PB REF="227"/>
sayde, and as I haue founde it by experience, hauyng now twise passed that way by foote, countyng from the port and village of <HI>Nomen Dei,</HI> vnto the dominion of the <HI>Cacique</HI> of <HI>Iuanaga,</HI> other∣wyse called <HI>Capira,</HI> eyght leagues, and from thence to the ryuer of <HI>Chagre,</HI> other eyght leagues. So that at this riuer, beyng six∣teene leagues from the sayde port,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ryuer of Chagre.</NOTE> endeth the roughnesse of the way: then from hence to the marueilous brydge are two leagues, and beyonde that, other two, vnto the port of <HI>Panama</HI>: So that altogeather, in my iudgement, make twentie leagues. And yf therefore this nauigation may be founde in the South sea for the trade of spyces (as we trust in God) to be brought from thence to the sayde port of <HI>Panama</HI> (as is possible enough) they maye afterwarde easely passe to the North sea, notwithstandyng the difficultie of the way of the twentie leagues aforesayde. Which thyng I affirme, as a man wel trauayled in these regions, ha∣uyng twyse on my feete passed ouer this strayght in the yeere 1521. as I haue said. It is furthermore to be vnderstoode, that it is a marueilous facilitie to bryng spices by this way which I wil now declare. From <HI>Panama</HI> to the ryuer of <HI>Chagre,</HI> are foure leagues of good and fayre way, by the which cartes may passe at pleasure, by reason that the mountaines are but few and litle, and that the greatest part of these foure leagues is a playne grounde voyde of trees: and when the cartes are come to the sayde ryuer▪ the spyces may be caried in Barkes and pynnesses. For this riuer entreth into the North sea fyue or syxe leagues lower then the port of <HI>Nomen Dei,</HI> and emptieth it selfe in the sea neere vnto an Iland called <HI>Bastimento,</HI> where is a verye good and safe port. Your maiestie may now therfore consyder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ilande Bastimento.</NOTE> howe great a thyng▪ and what commoditie it may be to conuey spices this way, foras∣much as y<SUP>e</SUP> riuer of <HI>Chagre,</HI> hauing his originall only two leagues from the South sea, continueth his course, and emptieth it selfe into the other North sea. This riuer runneth fast, and is verye great, and so commodious for this purpose as may be thought or desired:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maruey∣lous brydge.</NOTE> the marueylous brydge made by the worke of nature, beyng two leagues beyond the sayde ryuer, &amp; other two leagues on this syde the port of <HI>Panama,</HI> so lying in the mydde waye be∣tweene them both, as framed naturally in suche sort, that none which passe by this viage doth see any such brydge, or thinke that
<PB N="217" REF="227"/>
there is any such buyldyng in that place, vntyll they be in the top thereof, in the way towarde <HI>Panama</HI>: But assoone as they are on the brydge, lookyng towarde the ryght hande, they see a litle ryuer vnder them, whiche hath his chanell distant from the feete of them that walke ouer it, the space of two speares length or more. The water of this ryuer is very shalowe, not passyng the deapth of a mans legge to the knee, and is in breadth betweene thyrtie and fourtie pases, and falleth into the ryuer of <HI>Chagre.</HI> To∣warde the ryght hand, standyng on this brydge, there is nothing seene but great trees. The largenesse of the brydge conteyneth fyfteene pases, and the length thereof about threescore or foure∣score pases: The arche is so made of most harde stone, that no man can beholde it without admiration, beyng made by the hygh and omnipotent creatour of all thinges. But to returne to speake somewhat more of the conueying of spices, I say, that when it shall please almyghtie God that this nauigation aforesayde shall be founde by the good fortune of your maiestie, and that the spy∣ces of the Ilandes of the South sea (whiche may also be other∣wyse called the Ocean of the East India, in the which are the I∣landes of <HI>Molucca</HI>) shalbe brought to the sayd coast and the port of <HI>Panama,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ilandes of Molucca.</NOTE> and be conueyed from thence (as we haue sayde) by the fyrme lande with cartes vnto the ryuer of <HI>Chagre,</HI> and from thence into this our other sea of the North, from whence they may afterwarde be brought into Spayne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The commodi∣tie of this viage.</NOTE> I say that by this mea∣nes the viage shalbe shortned more then seuen thousand leagues, with muche lesse daunger then is by the viage nowe vsed by the way of Commendator of <HI>Aysa,</HI> captayne vnder your maiestie, who this present yeere attempted a viage to the place of the sayd spyces: and not only the way is thus muche shortned, but also a thyrd parte of the tyme is abbreuiate. To conclude therefore, if a∣ny had hytherto attempted this viage by the sea of <HI>Sur,</HI> to seeke the Ilandes of spyces, I am of firme opinion, that they shoulde haue been founde long since, as doubtlesse they may bee by the reasons of Cosmographie.</P>

All these thinges, and many more, whiche may bee sayde to this purpose, are easie to bee proued, and woorthy to bee beleeued, of suche as haue read of the lyke in aucthours, or tra∣ueyled the worlde, whereby theyr owne sight may teache them the experience of these thinges whereof I speake.

And in this fourme may so many thinges be sayd, that tyme shall not suffice to write, whereas my intent is only to prooue that this beast may bee a Tyger, or of y<SUP>e</SUP> kynd of Tygers, although it be not of such light∣nesse and swiftnesse as are they wherof Plinie &amp; other aucthours speake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinie.</NOTE> discrybyng it to bee one of the swyftest beastes of the lande, and that the ryuer of <HI>Tigris</HI> for the swyft course thereof was called by that name. The fyrst Spanyardes whiche sawe this Tyger in the firme lande, dyd so name it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tiger.</NOTE> Of the kynde of these was that which <HI>Don Diego Columbo</HI> the Admirall sent your maiestie out of newe Spayne to <HI>Toledo.</HI> Theyr heades are lyke to the heades of Lions, or Lionesses, but greater: the rest of all theyr bodyes, and theyr legges, are full of blacke spottes one neere vnto an other, and diuided with a circumference or fryndge of redde colour, shewyng as it were a fayre woorke and correspondent picture, about their croopes or hynder partes, they haue these spottes byggest, and lesse and lesse towarde theyr bellies, legges, and heades. That which was brought to <HI>Toledo,</HI> was young, and but litle, and by my estimation of the age of three yeeres: but in the firme lande there are many founde of greater quantitie, for I haue seene some of three spans in height, and more then fiue in length. They are beastes of great force, with strong legges, and well armed with nayles and fanges, which wee call dogge teeth: they are so fierce, that in my iudge∣ment no reall Lion of the byggest sort is so strong or fierce. Of these, there are many found in the firme lande, which deuour ma∣ny of the Indians, &amp; doe much hurt otherwyse: but since the com∣ming of the Christians, many haue been kyld with Crossebowes after this maner. Assoone as the archer hath knowledge of the haunt of any of these Tigers, he goeth searching their trase,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The huntyng of Tigers.</NOTE> with his crossebow &amp; with a litle hound or begle, and not with a grey∣hounde, because this beast would soone kyll any dog that would venter on him: When the hounde hath founde the Tyger, he runneth about him baying continually, and approcheth so neare him, snappyng and grynnyng, with so quycke fleeyng and re∣turnyng, that he heereby so molesteth this fierce beast, that hee driueth him to take the next tree, at the foote wherof he remaineth

styll baying, and the Tyger grynnyng and shewyng his teethe, whyle in the meane tyme the archer commeth neare, and .xii. or xiiii. pases of, stryketh him with the querell of his crossebowe in the brest, and fleeth incontinent, leauyng the Tyger in his tra∣uayle for lyfe and death, bytyng the tree and eatyng earth for fiercenesse: then within the space of two or three houres, or the day folowyng, the archer returneth thyther, and with his dogge fyndeth the place where he lyeth dead. In the yeere .1522. I with the other rulers and magistrates of the citie of <HI>Sancta Ma∣ria Antiqua</HI> in <HI>Dariena,</HI> tooke order in our counsayle, a rewarde of foure or fyue peeces of golde to bee giuen to euery man that kylled any of these Tygers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rewarde for kyllyng of Ty∣gers.</NOTE> by reason whereof many were kyld in shorte space, both with crossebowes, and also with dyuers snares and ingens. But to conclude, I will not obstinately stand in opinion whether these beastes be Tygers or Panthers, or of the number of any other suche beastes of spotted heare, or also peraduenture some other newe beast vnknowen to the olde wry∣ters, as were many other whereof I haue spoken in this booke: Of whiche thyng I doe not greatly marueyle, forasmuche as vnto our tyme this great part of the worlde was vnknowen to the antiquitie, insomuche that none of the wryters of that age, nor yet Pcolome in his Cosmographie, or any other since him, haue made any mention heereof, vntyll the fyrst Admyrall <HI>Don Christopher Colonus</HI> discouered the same: A thing doubtlesse with∣out comparyson muche greater then that which is sayde of Her∣cules,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colonus com∣pared to Her∣cules.</NOTE> that he fyrst gaue the entrance of the sea <HI>Mediterraneum</HI> into the Ocean, whiche the Grekes coulde neuer doe before him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The pyllers of Hercules.</P>

But to returne to the matter whereof I began to speake: I neede say no more of the fourme of this beast, forasmuch as your Maiestie haue seene that whiche is yet alyue in <HI>Toledo.</HI> And surely the keeper of your ma∣iesties Lions, who hath taken vppon him the charge to tame this beast, myght better haue bestowed his paynes in an other thing that myght haue been more profytable for the safegarde of his lyfe, because this Tyger beyng yet but young, will dayly be stronger and fiercer, and increase in malyce.

<PB REF="230"/>
bee beloued of any of them: insomuche that if they knowe any Christian man carnally, they keepe their fayth to him, so that hee bee not long absent farre from them, for theyr intent is not to be widowes, or to liue chast lyke religious women. Many of them haue this custome, that when they perceyue that they are with chylde, they take an hearbe wherwith they destroy that is concei∣ued: for they say that only well aged women should beare chyl∣dren, and that they wil not forbeare their pleasures, and defourme their bodies with bearyng of children, whereby theyr teates be∣come loose &amp; hanging, which thing they greatly dispraise. When they are deliuered of theyr children, they goe to the ryuer &amp; washe them, whiche done, theyr blood and purgation ceasseth im∣mediatly: And when after this they haue a fewe dayes abstey∣ned from the company of men, they become so strayght, as they say which haue had carnall familiaritie with them, that such as vse them, can not without much difficultie satisfie theyr appetite: They also whiche neuer had chyldren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The men of India.</NOTE> are euer as virgins. In some partes they weare certayne litle aperues rounde about them before and behynde, as low as to theyr knees and hammes, wherewith they couer theyr priuie partes, and are naked all their bodie besyde. The principall men beare theyr priuities in a ho∣low pype of golde, but the common sorte haue them inclosed in the shelles of certayne great welkes, and are besyde vtterly na∣ked: For they thinke it no more shame to haue theyr coddes seene, then any other parte of theyr bodies: and in many prouin∣ces both the men and women go vtterly naked, without any such couerture at all. In the prouince of <HI>Cueua</HI> they call a man <HI>Chuy,</HI> and a woman <HI>Ira,</HI> whiche name is not greatly disagreeable to many both of theyr women and of ours. These Indians gyue great honour and reuerence to theyr <HI>Cacique</HI> (that is) theyr kynges and rulers. The principall <HI>Cacique,</HI> hath twelue of his most strong Indians appointed to beare him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kyng is borne on mens backes.</NOTE> when he remoueth to any place, or goeth abrode for his pleasure. Two of them cary him sitting vppon a long peece of wood, which is naturally as lyght as they can fynde, the other tenne folow next vnto him as footemen: they keepe continually a trottyng pase with him on their shoulders. When the two that cary him are weery, other two come in their places, without any disturbance or staye. And
<PB N="220" REF="230"/>
thus if the way bee playne, they cary him in this maner for the space of .xv or .xx. leagues in one day. The Indians that are assig∣ned to this office, are for the most parte slaues, or <HI>Naboriti,</HI> that is, suche as are bounde to continuall seruice. I haue also no∣ted that when the Indians perceyue them selues to be troubled with to muche blood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lettyng of blood.</NOTE> they let them selues blood in the calfes of theyr legges, and brawnes of theyr armes: this doe they with a very sharpe stone, and sometymes with the smal tooth of a Ui∣per, or with a sharpe reede or thorne. All the Indians are com∣monly without beardes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They haue no beardes.</NOTE> insomuch that it is in maner a marueile to see any of them eyther men or women to haue any downe or heare on theyr faces, or other partes of theyr bodies: Albeit I sawe the <HI>Cacique</HI> of the prouince of <HI>Catarapa,</HI> who had heare on his face and other partes of his bodie, as had also his wyfe in such places as women are accustomed to haue. This <HI>Cacique</HI> had a great part of his body paynted with a blacke colour, which neuer fadeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They paynte their bodies.</NOTE> and is much lyke vnto that wherewith the Mores paynt them selues in Barbarie in token of nobilitie. But the Moores are paynted specially on their visage and throte, and certayne o∣ther partes. Lykewyse the principall Indians vse these payn∣tynges on theyr armes and brestes, but not on theyr visages, be∣cause among them the slaues are so marked. When the Indi∣ans of certayne prouinces goe to the battayle (especially the Ca∣niball archers) they cary certayne shelles of great welkes of the sea, which they blow, and make therewith great sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Canibals.</NOTE> much lyke the noyse of hornes: they cary also certayne Tymbrels, which they vse in the stead of Drummes: also very fayre plumes of fea∣thers, and certayne armure of golde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Armure of golde.</NOTE> especially great and rounde peeces on theyr brestes, and splintes on their armes.

Of the least of these welkes or perewincles, they make certayne litle beades, of dyuers sortes and colours: they make also litle bracelets, which they myngle with gaudies of golde, these they rowle about theyr armes from the elbowe to the wrest of the hande. The lyke also doe they on theyr legges
<PB REF="231"/>
from the knee to the soles of theyr feete, in token of nobilitie, es∣pecially theyr noble women in dyuers prouinces are accustomed to weare suche Iewelles, and haue theyr neckes in maner laden therewith: these beades and Iewelles, and suche other trynkets, they call <HI>Caquiras.</HI> Besyde these also, they weare certaine rynges of golde at theyr eares and nostrelles, whiche they bore full of holes on both sydes, so that the rynges hang vppon theyr lyp∣pes. Some of these Indians are poulde and rounded: albeit commonly both the men and women take it for a decent thyng to weare long heare, whiche the women weare to the myddest of theyr shoulders, &amp; cut it equally, especially aboue their browes: this doe they with certayne harde stones, whiche they keepe for the same purpose. The pryncipall women, when theyr teates fall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Howe the wo∣men beare vp theyr teates, with barres of golde.</NOTE> or become loose, beare them vp with barres of gold, of the length of a spanne and a halfe, well wrought, and of suche byggenesse that some of them weygh more then twoo hundred Castelans or Ducades of golde: these barres haue holes at both the endes, whereat they tye two small cordes made of cotton at euery ende of the barres: One of these cordes goeth ouer the shoulder, and the other vnder the arme holes, where they tye both togeather, so that by this meanes the barre bea∣reth vp theyr teates. Some of these chiefe women goe to the battayle with theyr husbandes, or when they them selues are regentes in any prouinces, in the whiche they haue all thinges at commaundement, and execute the office of generall captaines, and cause them selues to bee caryed on mens backes, in lyke maner as doe the Caciques of whom I haue spoken before.

These <HI>Coronati</HI> inhabite thyrtie leagues in length by these coastes, from the poynt of <HI>Canoa</HI> to the great ryuer which they call <HI>Guadalchiber,</HI> neere vnto <HI>Sancta Maria de gratia.</HI> As I trauersed by those coastes, I fylled a butte of freshe water of that ryuer, syxe leagues in the sea from the mouth thereof where it falleth into the sea. They are called <HI>Coronati</HI> (that is crowned) because theyr heare is cutte rounde by theyr eares, and poulde lower a great compase about the crowne, much lyke the fryers of saint Augustines order. And because I haue spoken of theyr maner of wearyng theyr heare, heere com∣meth to my remembraunce a thyng which I haue oftentymes noted in these Indians: and this is, that they haue the bones of the sculles of theyr heades foure tymes thycker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sculles of the Indians heades.</NOTE> and much stron∣ger then ours, so that in commyng to handstrokes with them, it shalbe requisite not to strike them on the heads with swoords, for so haue many swoordes been broken on theyr heades, with litle hurte doone. And to haue sayde thus much of theyr cu∣stomes and maners, it shall suffise for this tyme, because I haue more largly intreated herof in my general historie of the Indies: Yet haue I neyther there nor here spoken muche of that part of the firme lande whiche is called <HI>Noua Hispania</HI> (that is, newe Spayne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Newe Spaine.</NOTE> whereof the Iland of <HI>Iucatana</HI> is part) forasmuche as <HI>Ferdinando Cortesie</HI> hath written a large booke therof.

Wherewith neuerthelesse theyr barbarous crueltie was not sa∣tisfied vntyll they had torne hym in peeces, and deuoured hym: But many yeeres after, the Emperours Maiestie, and Kyng of Spayne Charles the fyfte, sent foorth <HI>Sebastian Cabot</HI> (a man of great courage &amp; skylful in Cosmographie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The viage of Sebastian Ca∣bot to the riuer of Plata.

Perceyuyng therefore that by reason of this chaunce he coulde by no meanes perfourme his viage attempted, he entended to expugne the sayde Ilande, and thereupon to conueygh his vic∣tuals to land, to prepare his souldiers to the inuasion, to plant co∣lonies, &amp; to erect fortresses by the riuers side, wherby the Spa∣niards might be defended from the violence of the Barbarians. But before he attempted this, he was aduertised that the Ilande was rich in gold &amp; siluer. Which thing did so encorage him, that
<PB N="227" REF="237"/>
without respecte of peryl he thought best to expugne it by one meanes or other, wherein his boldenesse tooke good effecte, as often tymes chaunceth in great affayres. Furthermore as touchyng the ryuer, <HI>Sebastian Cabote</HI> made relation, that he ne∣uer sawe any comparable vnto this in breadth and deapth: For whereas it falleth into the sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ryuer of Plata.</NOTE> it conteyneth .xxv. leagues in breadth. From the mouth of the ryuer, <HI>Cabote</HI> sailed vp the same into the lande for the space of three hundred and fiftie leagues, as he wryteth in his owne carde. That it is of great deapth, may hereby be consydered, that many great ryuers fall into it, so that the chanell can not be shalowe that conteyneth such aboundance of water, and suche plentie of good and great fyshes: For there is in maner no fyshe in the sea, that is not founde in this ryuer.

the worlde, or no? for learned men do diuersely handle that que∣stion. The naturall course of all waters is downewarde, wher∣fore of congruence they fall that way where they fynde the earth most lowe and deepe: in respecte whereof, it was erst sayde, the seas to strike from the Northren landes Southerly. Uiolently the seas are tossed and troubled diuerse wayes with the wyndes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luc. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Pharsal.</HI></NOTE> encreased and diminished by the course of the Moone, hoysed vp and downe through the sundrye operations of the Sonne and the Starres: finally some be of opinion, that the seas be car∣ried in part violently about y<SUP>e</SUP> world after the daily motion of the highest mouable heauen, in lyke maner as y<SUP>e</SUP> elementes of ayre and fyre, with the rest of the heauenly spheres are, from the east vnto the west. And this they do call theyr easterne currant, or leuant streame.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>VVhat the easterne cur∣rant is.</HI></NOTE> Some suche currant may not be denied to be of great force in the hote Zone, for the nearenes thereof vnto the centre of the Sonne and blustryng easterne wyndes violently dryuing the seas westwarde: howbeit in the temperate climes, the Sonne beyng farther of, and the wyndes more diuerse, blowyng as muche from the north, the west, and south, as from the east, this rule doth not effectually withholde vs from trauey∣lyng eastwarde, ne be we kepte euer backe by the aforesayde Leuante wyndes and streame. But in <HI>Magellane</HI> streict we are violently driuen backe westwarde: Ergo through the North∣westerne streicte or <HI>Anian</HI> fret shall we not be able to returne eastwarde? it foloweth not. The fyrst, for that the northwesterne streict hath more sea rome at the least by one hundred Englyshe myles, then <HI>Magellane</HI> fret hath, the onely want wherof causeth all narrowe passages generally to be most violent. So woulde I say in <HI>Anian</HI> gulfe, if it were so narrowe as <HI>Don Diego</HI> and <HI>Zalterius</HI> haue paynted it out, any returne that way to be ful of difficulties, in respect of such streictnes therof, not for the neare∣nes of the Sonne, or easterne wyndes, violently forceing that way any leuant streame. But in that place there is more sea rome by many degrees, if the cardes of <HI>Cabota,</HI> and <HI>Gemma Fri∣sius,</HI> and that whiche <HI>Tramezine</HI> imprinted, be true.

<P>This finally may be generally sayde heereof, that the grea∣ter shyres in <HI>China</HI> prouince, may be compared with mightie kyngdomes.</P>

There is also placed in eche one a <HI>Tutan,</HI> as you would say a gouernor, and a <HI>Chian,</HI> that is a visiter, as it were: whose office is to goe in circuit, and to see iustice exactly done. By these meanes so vp∣ryghtly thinges are ordered there, that it may bee worthely ac∣compted one of the best gouerned prouinces in all the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pachin. al.

This kyng∣dome is so large, that vnder fyue monethes you are not able to traueyle from the townes by the sea syde to the Court and backe agayne, no not vnder three monethes in poste at your vr∣gent businesse. The Posthorses in this countrey are litle of bodie, but swyfte of foote. Many doe traueyle the greater parte of this iourney by water in certayne lyght barkes, for the multitude of ryuers commodious for passage from one citie to an other.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="248"/>The kyng, notwithstandyng the hugenesse of his kyngdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theyr mo∣nethes.</NOTE> hath such a care thereof, that euery Moone (by the Moones they recken their monethes) he is aduertised fully of whatsoeuer thing happeneth therein, by these meanes folowyng.</P>
<P>The whole prouince beyng diuided into shyres, and eche shyre hauyng in it one chiefe and principall citie, wherevnto the matters of all the other cities, townes, and Boroughes, are brought: there are drawen, in euery chiefe citie aforesayde, intel∣ligences of suche thinges as doe monethly fall out, and be sent in writing to the Court. If happely in one moneth euery post is not able to goe so long a way, yet doeth there notwithstandyng once euery moneth arryue one poste out of the shyre. Who so commeth before the newe-Moone, stayeth for the deliuery of his letters vntyll the Moone be chaunged. Then lykewyse are dispatched other postes, backe into all the .13. shyres agayne.</P>
<P>Before that we doe come to <HI>Cinceo</HI> we haue to passe through many places, and some of great importance. For this countrey is so well inhabited neare the sea syde, that you can not go one myle but you shall see some towne, Borough, or Hostry, the which are so abundantly prouided of all thinges, that in the cities &amp; townes they liue ciuily. Neuertheles such as dwel abrode are very poore, for the multitude of them euery where so great, that out of a tree you shal see many tymes swarme a number of children, where a man would not haue thought to haue founde any one at all.</P>
<P>From these places in number infinite, you shall come vnto two cities very populose, and beyng compared with <HI>Cinceo,</HI> not possibly to be discerned which is the greater of them. These ci∣ties are as well walled as any cities in all the worlde. As you come in to eyther of them, standeth so great and mightie a brydge, that the lyke thereof I haue neuer seene in Portugall nor els where. I heard one of my felowes say, that he told in one bridge .40. arches. The occasion wherfore these bridges are made so great, is for that the countrey is toward the sea very plaine and low, &amp; ouerwhelmed euer as y<SUP>e</SUP> sea water encreaseth. The breadth of the bridges, although it bee well proportioned vnto the length therof, yet are they equally buylt, no higher in the middle than at eyther end, in such wyse that you may directly see from y<SUP>e</SUP> one end to the other, the sydes are wonderfully well engraue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after the

maner of Rome workes. But that wee did most marueyle at, was therwithall the hugenesse of y<SUP>e</SUP> stones, the lyke wherof as we came in to the citie, we dyd see many set vp in places dishabited by the way, to no small charges of theyrs, howbeit to litle pur∣pose, whereas no body seeth them but such as doe come bye. The arches are not made after our fashion, vauted with sundry stones set togeather: but paued, as it were, whole stones reaching from one piller to an other, in suche wyse that they lye both for the ar∣ches heades, and galantly serue also for the hygh waye. I haue been astunned to beholde the hugenesse of these aforesayde stones, some of them are .xii. pases long and vpwarde, the least a .xi. good pases long, and an halfe.</P>
<P>The wayes echewhere are galantly paued with fouresquare stone, except it be where for want of stone they vse to laye bricke: in this voyage wee traueyled ouer certayne hilles, where the wayes were pitched, and in many places no worse paued than in the playne grounde. This causeth vs to thinke, that in all the worlde there be no better workemen for buildinges, than the in∣inhabitantes of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The countrey is so well inhabited, that no one foote of ground is left vntilled: small store of cattell haue we seene this way, we sawe onely certayne Oxen wherewithall the countrymen doe plough theyr grounde. One Oxe draweth the plough alone, not onely in this shyre, but in other places also, wherein is greater store of cattell. These countrymen by arte doe that in tyllage, which we are constrayned to doe by force. Here be solde the voy∣dinges of close stooles, although there wanteth not the dunge of beastes: &amp; the excrements of man are good marchandise through∣out all <HI>China.</HI> The dungfermers seeke in euery streete by ex∣chaunge to buye this durtie ware for hearbes and wood. The cu∣stome is very good for keepyng the citie cleane. There is great aboundance of Hennes, Geese, Duckes, Swyne, and Goates, Wethers haue they none: the Hennes are solde by weight, and so are all other thinges. Two pounde of Hennes fleshe, Goose, or Ducke, is woorth two Foi of their money, that is, d. ob. sterling. Swines fleshe is solde at a peny the pounde. Beefe beareth the same pryce, for the scarcitie thereof, howbeit Northwarde from <HI>Fuquieo,</HI> &amp; farther of from the sea coast, there is Beefe more plen∣tie
<PB N="239" REF="249"/>
and solde better cheape, Beefe onely excepted, great aboun∣dance of all these viandes we haue had in all the cities we passed through. And if this countrey were lyke vnto India, the inhabi∣tantes whereof eate neyther Henne, beefe, nor porke, but keepe that onely for the Portugalles and Moores, they would be solde here for nothyng. But it so fallyng out, that the <HI>Chineans</HI> are the greatest eaters in all the world, they doe feede vppon all thinges, specially on porke, the fatter that is, vnto them the lesse lothsome. The highest price of these thinges aforesayde, I haue set downe, better cheape shall you sometymes buye them for the great plen∣tie thereof in this countrey. Frogges are solde at the same price that is made of Hennes, and are good meate amongst them, as also Dogges, Cattes, Rattes, Snakes, and all other vncleane meates.</P>
<P>The cities be very gallant, specially neare vnto the gates, the which are marueylously great, &amp; couered with Iron. The gate∣houses buylt on hygh with Towers, the lower parte thereof, is made of bricke and stone, proportionally with the walles, from the walles vpward, the buyldyng is of tymber, and many stories in it one aboue the other. The strength of theyr townes is in the mightie walles and ditches, artillerie haue they none.</P>
<P>The streetes in <HI>Cinceo,</HI> and in all the rest of the cities we haue seene are very fayre, so large and so streight, that it is wonderfull to beholde. Theyr houses are buylte with tymber, the foundati∣ons onely excepted, the which are layde with stone, in eche syde of the streetes are paynteses or continuall porches for the mar∣chantes to walke vnder: the breadth of the streete is neuerthelesse suche, that in them .xv. men may ryde commodiously syde by side. As they ryde they must needes passe vnder many hygh arches of triumph that crosse ouer the streetes made of tymber, and carued diuersely, couered with tyle of fine claye: vnder these arches the Mercers doe vtter theyr smaller wares, and such as lyst to stande there, are defensed from rayne and the heate of the Sunne. The greater gentlemen haue these arches at their doores: although some of them be not so myghtyly buylt as the rest.</P>
<P>I shall haue occasion to speake of a certayne order of gentle∣men that are called <HI>Loutea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Loutea.</HI></NOTE> I will first therefore expounde what this worde signifieth. <HI>Loutea</HI> is as muche to say in our language
<PB REF="250"/>
as Syr, and whan any of them calleth his name, he answereth Syr: and as we doe say, that the kyng hath made some gentle∣man, so say they, that there is made a <HI>Loutea.</HI> And for that amon∣gest them the degrees are diuers both in name and office, I will tell you onely of some principalles, beyng not able to aduertise you of all.</P>
<P>The maner howe gentlemen are created <HI>Louteas,</HI> and doe come to that honour and title, is by the gyuyng of a broad gyrdle not like to the rest, &amp; a cap, at the commaundement of the kyng. The name <HI>Loutea</HI> is more generall and common vnto moe, than equalitie of honour therby signified, agreeth withall. Such <HI>Lou∣teas</HI> that doe serue their prince in weightie matters for iustice, are created after triall made of their learning: but the other whiche serue in smaller affayres, as Capitaynes, Constables, Serge∣antes by lande and sea, Receyuers, and such lyke, wherof there be in euery citie, as also in this, very many, are made for fauour: the chiefe <HI>Louteas</HI> are serued kneelyng.</P>
<P>The whole prouince <HI>China</HI> is diuided, as I haue sayde, into thirtiene shyres, in euery shyre at the least is one gouernour cal∣led there <HI>Tutan,</HI> in some shyres there be two.</P>
<P>Chiefe in office nexte vnto them be certayne other named <HI>Chians,</HI> that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chian, al. Chaen.</HI></NOTE> hygh Commissioners as you would say, or visiters, with full aucthoritie in suche wyse, that they doe call vnto an accompt the <HI>Tutanes</HI> them selues, but their aucthoritie lasteth not in any shyre longer than one yeere. Neuerthelesse in euery shyre beyng at the least seuen cities, yea, in some of them fyftiene or sixtiene, beside other Boroughes &amp; townes not well to be numbred, these visiters, where they come, are so honoured and feared, as though they were some great princes. At the yeeres ende their circuit done, they come vnto that citie which is chiefe of others in the shyre, to doe iustice there: finally busiyng them selues in the sear∣chyng out of such as are to receyue the order of <HI>Louteas,</HI> whereof more shall be sayde in an other place.</P>
<P>Ouer and besydes these officers, in the chiefe citie of eche one of these aforesayde thirtiene prouinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ponchiassi.</HI></NOTE> is resident one <HI>Ponchiassi,</HI> Capitayne thereof, and Treasurer of all the kynges reuenues. This Magistrate maketh his abode in one of the foure grea∣test

houses that be in all these head cities. And although the prin∣cipall parte of his function be, to be Capitayne, to be Treasurer of the reuenues in that prouince, to sende these reuenues at ap∣poynted tymes to the Court: yet hath he notwithstandyng by his office also to meddle with matters apperteynyng vnto iu∣styce.</P>
<P>In the seconde great house dwelleth an other Magistrate called <HI>Anchiassi,</HI> a great offycer also,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anchiassi. al. Hexasi.</HI></NOTE> for he hath dealynges in all matters of iustice. Who although hee bee somewhat in∣ferior in dignitie vnto the <HI>Ponchiassi,</HI> yet for his great dea∣lynges and generall charge of iustice, whosoeuer seeth the af∣fayres of the one house and the other, myght iudge this <HI>Anchiassi</HI> to be the greater.</P>
<P><HI>Tuzi,</HI> an other officer so called, lyeth in the thyrd house, a ma∣gistrate of importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tuzi.</HI></NOTE> specially in thinges belongyng vnto war∣fare, for thereof hath he charge.</P>
<P>There is resident in the fourth house a fourth officer, bearyng name <HI>Taissu.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Taissu.</HI></NOTE> In this house is the principall pryson of all the ci∣tie. Eche one of these Magistrates aforesayde may both laye e∣uyll doers in pryson, and deliuer them out agayne, except the facte be heynous and of importance: in suche a case they can doe nothing, except they doe meete altogeather. And if the deede de∣serue death, all they togeather can not determine thereof, with∣out recourse made vnto the <HI>Chian</HI> wheresoeuer he bee, or to the <HI>Tutan:</HI> and eftsones it falleth out, that the case be referred vnto hygher power. In all cities, not onely chiefe in eche shyre, but in the rest also, are meanes founde to make <HI>Louteas.</HI> Many of them doe studie at the prince his charges, wherfore at the yeeres ende they resort vnto the head cities, whyther the <HI>Chians</HI> doe come, as it hath been earst sayde, as well to gyue these degrees, as to sit in iudgement ouer the prysoners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chians</HI> goe in circuit euery yeere, but suche as are to be chosen to the greatest offices, meete not but from three yeeres to three yeeres, and that in certayne large halles appoynted for them to be examined in. Many thynges are asked them, where∣vnto if they doe aunswere accordingly, and be found sufficient to take their degree, the <HI>Chian</HI> by and by graunteth it them:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Licentiates.</HI></NOTE> but the Cappe &amp; gyrdle wherby they are knowen to be <HI>Louteas,</HI> they

weare not before that they be confirmed by the kyng. Theyr exa∣mination done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctors.</NOTE> and tryall made of them, such as haue taken their degree wont to be giuen them with all cerimonies, vse to banket and feast many dayes together (as the <HI>Chineans</HI> fashion is to end all their pleasures with eatyng and drinkyng) and so remayne chosen to doe the kyng seruice in matters of learnyng.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dutch lyke.</NOTE> The o∣ther examinates founde insufficient to proceede, are sent backe to their studie againe. Whose ignoraunce is perceiued to come of negligence &amp; default, such a one is whipped, and sometymes sent to pryson, where wee lying that yeere whan this kynde of acte was, we found many thus punished, and demaundyng the cause therof, they sayde it was for that they knew not howe to answere vnto certayne thinges asked them. It is a worlde to see howe these <HI>Louteas</HI> are serued and feared, in suche wise, that in publyke assemblies at one shryke they gyue, all the seruitors belongyng vnto iustice, tremble thereat. At their being in these places, whan they lyst to moue, be it but euen to the gate, these seruitors do take them vp, and carry them in seates of beaten golde. After this sort are they borne whan they goe in the citie, eyther for their owne businesse abrode, or to see eche other at home. For the dignitie they haue, and office they doe beare, they be al accompanyed: the very meanest of them all that goeth in these seates is vshered by two men at the least, that cry vnto the people to gyue place, how∣beit, they neede it not, for that reuerence the common people hath vnto them. They haue also in theyr company certayne Serge∣antes, with their Maces eyther siluered, or altogeather siluer, some two, some foure, other six, other eight, conueniently for eche one his degree. The more principall and chiefe <HI>Louteas</HI> haue go∣ing orderly before these Sergeantes, many other with staues, and a great many catchpoules with roddes of Indishe canes, dragged on the grounde, so that the streetes beyng paued, you may heare a farre of as well the noyse of the roddes, as the voyce of the cryers. These felowes serue also to apprehende others, and the better to be knowen they weare liuery redde girdles, and in their cappes Pecockes feathers. Behynde these <HI>Louteas</HI> come such as doe beare certayne tables hanged at staues endes, where∣in is written in siluer letters the name, degree, and office of that <HI>Loutea,</HI> whom they folowe. In lyke maner they haue borne after
<PB N="241" REF="251"/>
them hattes agreeable vnto theyr tytles: if the <HI>Loutea</HI> be meane, then hath he brought after hym but one hatte, and that may not be yealowe: but if he be of the better sorte, then may he haue two, three, or foure: the principall and chiefe <HI>Louteas,</HI> may haue all theyr hattes yealowe, the which among them is accompted great honour. The <HI>Loutea</HI> for warres, although he be but meane, may notwithstandyng haue yealowe hattes. The <HI>Tutanes</HI> and <HI>Chians,</HI> when they goe abrode, haue besydes all this before them ledde .3. or .4. horses with theyr garde in armor. Further∣more the <HI>Louteas,</HI> yea and all the people of <HI>China,</HI> are woonte to eate theyr meat syttyng on stooles at hygh tables as we do, and that very cleanly, although they vse nether table clothes nor nap∣kyns. Whatsoeuer is set downe vppon the boorde, is fyrst carued, before that it be brought in: they feede with two styckes, refraynyng from touchyng theyr meate with theyr handes, euen as we do with forkes, for y<SUP>e</SUP> which respect, they lesse do neede any table clothes. He is the nation onely ciuil at meate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We, that is the Italians and Spani∣ardes.</NOTE> but also in conuersation, and in courtesie they seeme to exceede all other. Likewise in theyr dealynges, after their maner, they are so ready, that they farre passe all other Gentyles and Moores: the grea∣ter states are so vayne, that they lyne theyr clothes with the best sylke that may be founde. The <HI>Louteas,</HI> are an idle generation, without all maner of exercises and pastymes, excepte it be eatyng and drynkyng. Somtymes they walke abrode in the fieldes, to make the souldyars shoot at prickes with theyr bowes, but theyr eatyng passeth: they wyll stande eatyng euen when the other do drawe to shoote. The pricke is a great blanket spread on certayne long poles, he that stryketh it, hath of the best man there standyng a peece of crymson taffata, the whiche is knyt about his head: in this sorte the wynners honoured, and the <HI>Lou∣teas</HI> with theyr bellyes full, returne home agayne. The inha∣bitantes of <HI>China,</HI> be very great Idolaters, all generally do worshyppe the heauens: and as we are woont to saye, God knoweth it: so saye they at euery worde, <HI>Tien Tautee,</HI> that is to saye, <HI>The heauens do knowe it.</HI> Some do worshyp the Sonne, and some the Moone, as they thynke good, for none are bounde more to one then to an other. In their temples, the which they do cal <HI>Meani,</HI> they haue a great altar in y<SUP>e</SUP> same place
<PB REF="252"/>
as we haue, true it is that one may goe rounde about it. There set they vp the Image of a certayne <HI>Loutea</HI> of that countrey, whom they haue in great reuerence for certaine notable thinges he dyd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">After the Dutch fation.</NOTE> At the ryght hande standeth the deuyl, muche more vglie paynted then we do vse to set hym out, whereunto great homage is done by suche as come into the temple to aske counsell, or to drawe lottes: this opinion they haue of hym, that he is malitious and able to do euyl. If you aske them what they do thynke of the soules departed, they wil answeare, that they be immortall, and that as soone as any one departeth out of this life, he becommeth a deuyl if he haue liued well in this worlde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pithigorian lyke.</NOTE> if otherwyse, that the same deuyl chaungeth hym into a bufle, oxe, or dogge. Wher∣fore to this deuyl do they muche honour, to hym do they sacrifice, praying hym that he wyll make them lyke vnto hym selfe, and not lyke other beastes. They haue moreouer an other sorte of temples, wherein both vppon the altars and also on the walles do stande many Idoles well proportioned, but bare headed: These beare name <HI>Omithofon,</HI> accompted of them spirites, but suche as in heauen do nether good nor euyll, thought to be suche men and women, as haue chastlye lyued in this worlde in abstinence from fyshe and fleshe, fedde only with ryse &amp; salates. Of that deuil they make some accompte, for these spirites they care litle or nothyng at all. Agayne they holde opinion that if a man do well in this lyfe, the heauens wyll geue hym many temporall blessynges, but if he do euyll, then shall he haue infirmi∣ties, diseases, troubles, and penurie, and all this without any knowledge of God. Finally, this people knoweth no other thing then to liue &amp; die, yet because they be reasonable creatures, al seemed good vnto them we speake in our language, though it were not very sufficient: our maner of praying especially pleased them, and truely they are wel ynough disposed to receiue the knowledge of the trueth. Our lorde graunte for his mercie all thynges so to be disposed, that it may some tyme be brought to passe, that so great a nation as this is, peryshe not for wante of helpe.</P>
<P>Our manner of praying so well lyked them, that in pryson importunately they besoughte vs to wryte for them
<PB N="242" REF="252"/>
somewhat as concernyng heauen, the whiche we dyd to theyr contentation with suche reasons as we knewe, howbeit not very cunnyngly. As they do theyr Idolatry they laugh at them selues. If at any tyme this countrey myght be ioined in league with the kyngdome of Portugale, in such wyse that free accesse were had to deale with the people there, they might al be soone conuerted. The greatest fault we do fynd in them is Sodomie, a vice very common in the meaner sort, &amp; nothing strange amongst the best. This sinne were it left of them, in all other thynges so well dis∣posed they be, that a good interpretour in a short space myght do there great good, yf, as I sayde, the countrey were ioyned in league with vs.</P>
<P>Furthermore the <HI>Louteas,</HI> with al the people of <HI>China,</HI> are wont to solempnize the dayes of the newe and full Moones in visiting one eache other, and makyng great bankettes, for to that end, as I earst sayd, do tend all theyr pastymes, and spendyng theyr daies in pleasure. They are wont also to solempnize eache one his byrth daye, whereunto theyr kyndred and frendes do resorte of custome, with presentes of Iuelles or money, receyuyng a∣gayne for theyr rewarde good cheare. They keepe in lyke ma∣ner a general feast with great bankets that day theyr kyng was borne. But theyr most principall and greatest feast of al, and best cheare, is the fyrst day of theyr newe yeere, namely the fyrst day of the newe Moone of Februarye, so that theyr fyrst moneth is Marche, and they recken the tymes accordynglye, respect beyng had vnto the reigne of theyr Prynces: as when anye deede is wrytten, they date it thus, Made suche a daye of suche a Moone, and such a yeere of the reigne of suche a Kyng. And theyr auncient wrytynges beare date of the yeeres of this or that Kyng.</P>
<P>Nowe wyll I speake of the maner the whiche the <HI>Chi∣neans</HI> doo obserue in dooyng Iustice, that it maye be knowen how farre these Gentyles doo herein exceede manye Christi∣ans, that be more bounden then they to deale iustly and in trueth. Because the Chinishe Kyng maketh his abode contynually in the Citie <HI>Pachyn,</HI> his kyngdome so great, the shyres so many, as tofore it hath been sayde: in it therefore the Gouernours and Rulers, muche lyke vnto our Shyryffes, be so appoynted
<PB REF="253"/>
sodenly and speedely discharged agayne, that they haue no tyme to growe naught. Furthermore to keepe the state in more se∣curitie, the <HI>Louteas</HI> that gouerne one shyre, are chosen out of some other shyre distaunt farre of, where they must leaue theyr wyues, chyldren, and goodes, carryeng nothyng with them but them selues. True it is, that at theyr commyng thyther they do fynde in a redinesse all thynges necessarie, theyr house, fur∣niture, seruantes, and all other thynges in suche perfection and plentie, that they want nothyng. Thus the kyng is well serued without all feare of treason.</P>
<P>In the principall cities of the shyres be foure cheefe <HI>Louteas,</HI> before whom are brought all matters of the inferiour townes, throughout the whole realme. Diuers other <HI>Louteas</HI> haue the maneagyng of iustice, and receyuyng of rentes, bounde to yeeld an accompte thereof vnto the greater officers. Other doo see that there be no euyll rule keept in the citie: eache one as it be∣houeth hym. Generally al these do impryson malefactours, cause them to be whypped &amp; racked, hoysing them vp &amp; downe by the armes with a corde, a thyng very vsuall there, and accompted no shame.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Italians call it the stra∣pad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> These <HI>Louteas</HI> do vse great diligence in y<SUP>e</SUP> apprehending of theeues, so that it is a wonder to see a theefe escape away in any towne, citie, or village. Upon the sea neere vnto the shore many are taken, and looke euen as they are taken, so be they fyrst whypped, and afterward layd in prison, where shortly after they all dye for hunger and colde. At that tyme, when we were in pryson, there died of them aboue threscore and ten.

<P><PB N="243" REF="253"/>The <HI>Louteas</HI> obserue moreouer this: when any man is brought before them to be examined, they aske hym openly in the hea∣ring of as many as be present, be y<SUP>e</SUP> offence neuer so great. Thus did they also behaue them selues with vs. For this cause amongst them can there be no false witnes, as dayly amongst vs it falleth out. This good commeth therof, that many being alwaies about the iudge to heare the euidence, and beare witnesse, the processe can not be falsifyed, as it happeneth sometymes with vs. The Mores, Gentiles, &amp; Iewes, haue al their sundry othes, y<SUP>e</SUP> Mores doo sweare by theyr <HI>Mossafos,</HI> the <HI>Brachmans</HI> by theyr <HI>Fili,</HI> the rest likewise by the thynges they do worshyppe. The <HI>Chineans</HI> though they be wonte to sweare by heauen, by the Moone, by the Sunne, and by all theyr Idolles, in iudgement neuerthelesse they sweare not at all. If for some offence an othe be vsed of any one, by and by with the least euidence he is tormented, so be the wytnesses he bryngeth, if they tell not the truth, or do in any poynt disagree, except they be men of worshyppe and credyte, who are beleeued without any farther matter: the rest are made to confesse the trueth by force of tormentes and whyppes. Be∣sydes this order obserued of them in examinations, they do feare so muche theyr kyng, and he where he maketh his abode kee∣peth them so lowe, that they dare not once styrre. Agayne, these <HI>Louteas</HI> as great as they be, notwithstanding the multitude of Notaries they haue, not trusting any others, do write al great processes and matters of importance them selues. Moreouer one vertue they haue worthy of great prayse, and that is, being men so well regarded and accompted of as though they were princes, they be patient aboue measure in geuyng audience. We poore straungers brought before them myght saye what we woulde, as all to be lyes and falaces that they dyd wryte, ne dyd we stande before them with the vsuall cerimonies of that coun∣trey, yet dyd they beare with vs so patiently, that they caused vs to wonder, knowyng specially howe litle any aduocate or iudge is wonte in our countrey to beare with vs. For where so euer in any towne of Christendome shoulde be accused vn∣knowen men as we were, I knowe not what ende the very in∣nocentes cause woulde haue: but we in a Heathen countrey, ha∣uyng our great ennimies two of the chiefest men in a whole

Somewhat is nowe to be sayde of the lawes that I haue been hable to knowe in this countrey, and fyrst, no thefte or murther, is at any tyme pardoned: adulterers are put in pryson, and the facte once proued, condemned to dye, the womans husbande must accuse them: this order is keapt with men and women found in that fault, but theeues and mur∣therers are inprisoned as I haue sayd, where they shortly dye for hunger and colde. If any one happely escape by brybyng the gayler to geue hym meate, his processe goeth farther, and com∣meth to the courte where he is condemned to dye. Sentence beyng geuen, the prysoner is brought in publyke with a terrible bande of men that laye hym in Irons hande and foote, with a boorde at his necke one handefull broade, in length reachyng downe to his knees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A pylle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> boorde.</NOTE> clefte in two partes, and with a hole one handefull downewarde in the table fyt for his necke, the whiche they enclose vp therein, naylyng the boorde fast togeather. one handefull of the boorde standeth vp behynde in the necke: the sentence and cause wherefore the fellon was condemned to dye, is wryten in that parte of the table that standeth before.</P>
<P>This cerimonie ended, he is laid in a great prison in the compa∣nie of some other condemned persons, the which are found by the king as long as they do liue. The boord aforsaid so made, tormen∣teth the prysoners very much, keeping them both from rest, &amp; eke lettyng them to eate commodyously, theyr handes beyng manecled in Irons vnder that bord, so y<SUP>t</SUP> in fine there is no reme∣dy but death.

Their death is much prolonged, for that ordinarily there is no execution doone but once a yeere, though many die for hunger and colde, as we haue seene in this prison. Execution is done in this maner. The <HI>Chian,</HI> to wyt the

This is done once a yeere: who so escapeth that day, may be sure that he shal not be put to death al that yeere folow∣yng, &amp; so remayneth at the kynges charges in the greater prison. In that prison where we lay were al waies one hundred &amp; moe of these condemned persons, besides them that lay in other prisons.</P>
<P>These prisons wherin the condemned caytyfes do remayne are so strong, that it hath not been hard, that any prisoner in al <HI>China</HI> hath escaped out of pryson, for in deed it is a thyng impossible. The prisons are thus builded. Fyrst al the place is myghtelye walled about, the walles be very strong and hygh, the gate of no lesse force: within it three other gates, before you come where the prysoners do lye, there many great lodginges are to be seene of the <HI>Louteas,</HI> Notaries, Parthions, that is, such as do there kepe watch and ward day and nyght, the court large and paued, on the one syde wherof standeth a pryson, with two myghtie gates, wherin are kept such prisoners as haue committed enormious offences. This prison is so great, that in it are streates and Mar∣ket places wherein al thyngs necessarie are sold. Yea some pry∣soners liue by that kynde of trade, buyeng and selling, and letting out beds to hyre: some are dayly sent to pryson, some dayly deli∣uered, wherfore this place is neuer voyde of seuen or eyght hun∣dred men that go at libertie.</P>
<P>Into one other pryson of condempned persons shall you goo at three yron gates, the court paued and vauted rounde about, &amp; open aboue as it were a cloister. In this cloister be eight roomes with yron doores, and in eache of them a large Gallerie, wherein euery night the prisoners do lie at length, their feete in the stocks, theyr bodies hampered in huge woodden grates that kepe them frō sitting, so that they lie as it were in a cage, sleepe if they can: in the morning they are losed againe, that they may go into y<SUP>e</SUP> court.
<PB REF="255"/>
Notwithstanding the strength of this pryson, it is kept with a garrison of men, part whereof watche within the house, part of them in the Court, some keepe about the pryson with lanterns and watchebelles answeryng one an other fyue tymes euerye nyght, and geuing warning so lowde, that the <HI>Loutea</HI> resting in a chamber not neare thereunto, may heere them. In these pry∣sons of condemned persons remayne some .15. other 20. yeeres imprisoned, not executed, for the loue of theyr honorable frendes that seeke to prolong theyr lyues. Many of these prysoners be shomakers, and haue from the king a certayne allowaunce of rise: some of them worke for the keeper, who suffereth them to goe at libertie without fetters and boordes, the better to worke. Howbeit when the <HI>Loutea</HI> calleth his checke rolle, &amp; with the ke∣per vieweth them, they al weare theyr lyuereys, that is, boords at theyr neckes, yronned hand and foote. When any of these prysoners dieth, he is to be seene of the <HI>Loutea</HI> and Notaries, brought out at a gate so narrow, that there can but one be drawen out there at once. The prysoner beyng brought foorth, one of the aforesayde <HI>Parthians</HI> stryketh hym thryse on the head with an yron sledge, that doone, he is deliuered vnto his frendes, yf he haue any, otherwyse the kyng hyreth men to cary hym to his buriall in the fieldes.</P>
<P>Thus adulterers and theeues are vsed. Such as be imprisoned for debt once knowen, lye there vntyl it be payed. The <HI>Taissu</HI> or <HI>Loutea</HI> calleth them many tymes before him by the vertue of his office, who vnderstanding the cause wherefore they doo not pay theyr debtes, appointeth them a certayne tyme to doe it, w<SUP>t</SUP>in the compasse wherof if they discharge not theyr debtes beyng debt∣ers in deede, then they be whipped &amp; condemned to perpetual im∣prisonment: yf the creditours be many, &amp; one is to be payd before an other, they do, contrary to our maner, pay him fyrst, of whom they last borowed, and so ordinarily the rest, in suche sort that the fyrst lender be the last receyuer. The same order is kept in pay∣ing legacies: the last named, receyueth his portion first. They accompt it nothyng to shew fauour to such a one as can doo the lyke agayne:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of like the first lenders be the more welthier.</HI></NOTE> but to doo good to them that haue litle or nothing, that is worth thanks, therfore pay they the last before the first, for that their entent seemeth rather to be vertuous then gainful.</P>

The steyers they vse, are so easily made, that one may go them vp and down a horsebacke, as eftsoones they doe: the streetes are paued, as already it hath been sayde: there be a great number of Merchantes, euery one hath written in a great table at his doore such thinges as he hath to sell. In lyke maner euery artisane paynteth out his craft: the market places be large, great aboundance of all thinges there be to be solde. The citie standeth vppon water, many streames run through it, the bankes pitched, and so broade that they serue for streetes to the cities vse. Ouer the streames are sundry brydges both of tymber &amp; stone, that beyng made leuell with the streetes, hynder not the passage of the Barges to and fro, the chanelles are so deepe.

These streames and Barges doe ennoblyshe very muche the citie, and make it as it were to seeme an other Uenice. The buyldinges are euen, well made, hygh, not lofted, except it be some wherein merchandise is layde. It is a worlde to see howe great these cities are, and the cause is, for that the houses are buylt euen, as I haue sayde, and doe take a great deale of roome.

<P><PB N="247" REF="257"/>I sayd before that <HI>China</HI> was full of ryuers, but now I mynde to confyrme the same anewe: for the farther we went into the countrey, the greater we found the ryuers. Sometymes we were so farre of from the sea, that where we came no sea fyshe had been seene, and salt was there very deere, of freshe water fyshe yet was there great aboundance, &amp; that fysh very good: they keepe it good after this maner. Where the ryuers doe meete, and so passe into the sea, there lyeth great store of Boates, specially where no salte water commeth, and that in Marche and Apryll. These Boates are so many that it seemeth wonderfull, ne serue they for other than to take small fyshe. By the ryuers sydes they make leyres of fine and strong nettes, that lye three handfulles vnder water, and one aboue, to keepe and nourysh their fyshe in, vntyll suche tyme as other fyshers doe come with Boates, bryngyng for that purpose certayne great chestes lyned with paper, able to holde water, wherein they carry theyr fyshe vp and downe the ry∣uer, euery day renuyng the chest with freshe water, and sellyng theyr fyshe in euery citie, towne, and village, where they passe, vnto the people as they neede it: most of them haue nette leyres to keepe fyshe in alwayes for theyr prouision. Where the grea∣ter Boates can not passe any farther forwarde, they take lesser, and bycause the whole countrey is very well watred, there is so great plentie of dyuers sortes of fyshe, that it is wonderfull to see: assuredly we were amazed to beholde the maner of their prouisi∣on. Theyr fyshe is chiefly nourished with the dung of Bufles and Oxen, that greatly fatteth it. Although I sayde theyr fyshyng to be in March and Aprill at what tyme we sawe them doe it, ne∣uerthelesse they tolde vs that they fyshed at all tymes, for that v∣sually they doe feede on fyshe, wherfore it behoueth them to make theyr prouision continually.

These riuers do meet without at one corner point of the citie. In either of them were so many barges great and small, that we all thought them at the least to be aboue three thousande: the greater number therof was in the lesser ryuer, where we were.

To gard this riuer wher∣on continually go to &amp; fro <HI>Parai</HI> great &amp; small fraught with salt, fish poudred with pepper, and other necessaries for that countrey: they do lay in diuers places certain <HI>Parai,</HI> &amp; great barges armed, wherin watch &amp; warde is kept day &amp; night in both sides of the ri∣uer, for the safetie of the passage, &amp; securitie of suche <HI>Parai</HI> as doe remayne there, though the traueylers neuer go but many in com∣pany. In euery rode there be at the least thirtie, in some two hun∣dred men, as the passage requyreth.</P>
<P><PB REF="259"/>This garde is kept vsually vntyll you come to the citie <HI>Onchio,</HI> where continually the <HI>Tutan</HI> of this shyre, and eke of <HI>Cantan,</HI> maketh his abode. From that citie vpwarde, where the ryuer waxeth more narrow, and the passage more daungerous, there be alwayes armed one hundred and fiftie <HI>Parai,</HI> to accompany o∣ther vesselles fraught with marchandyse, and all this at the king his charges. This seemed vnto me one of the strangest thinges I dyd see in this countrey.</P>
<P>Whan we laye at <HI>Fuquien,</HI> we dyd see certayne Moores, who knewe so litle of theyr secte, that they could say nothyng els but that Machomet was a Moore, my father was a Moore, and I am a Moore, with some other wordes of theyr Alcorane, where∣withall, in abstinence from Swynes fleshe, they lyue vntyll the deuyll take them all. This whan I sawe, &amp; beyng sure that in many <HI>Chinish</HI> cities the reliques of Machomet are kept, as soone as we came to the citie where these felowes be, I enfourmed my selfe of them, and learned the trueth.</P>
<P>These Moores, as they tolde me, in tymes past came in great shippes fraught with marchandise from <HI>Pachin</HI> ward, to a Porte graunted vnto them by the kyng, as hee is wont to all them that traffike into this countrey, where they beyng arriued at a litle towne standyng in the hauens mouth, in tyme conuerted vnto their secte the greatest <HI>Loutea</HI> there. Whan that <HI>Loutea</HI> with all his family was become Moorysh, the rest began lykewyse to doe the same. In this part of <HI>China</HI> the people be at libertie, euery one to worshyp and folow what him lyketh best. Wherefore no body tooke heede thereto, vntyll such tyme as the Moores perceyuyng that many folowed them in superstition, and that the <HI>Loutea</HI> fa∣uoured them, they began to forbyd wholy the eatyng of Swines flesh. But all this countrymen and women, chosing rather to for∣sake father and mother, than to leaue of eatyng of porke, by no meanes would yelde to that proclamation. For besides the great desyre they all haue to eate that kynde of meate, many of them doe lyue thereby: and therefore the people complayned vnto the Magistrates, accusing the Moores of a conspiracy pretended be∣twixt them and the <HI>Loutea</HI> agaynst theyr kyng. In this countrey, as no suspicion, no not one trayterous worde is long borne with∣all: so was the kyng speedily aduertised thereof, who gaue com∣commaundement
<PB N="249" REF="259"/>
out of hande that the aforesayde <HI>Loutea</HI> should be put to death, and with hym the Moores of most importance: the other to be layde fyrst in pryson, and afterwarde to be sent abrode into certayne cities, where they remayned perpetuall slaues vnto the kyng. To this citie came by happe men and women threescore and odde, who at this day are brought to fiue men and foure women, for it is nowe twentie yeeres agoe this happened. Theyr ofspryng passeth the number of .200. and they in this citie, as the rest in other cities, whyther they were sent, haue theyr <HI>Moscheas,</HI> wherunto they al resorte euery fryday to kepe theyr holydaye. But, as I thynke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That is theyr temples.</NOTE> that wyll no longer endure, then whiles they do lyue, that came from thence, for theyr posteritie is so confused, that they haue nothing of a Moore in them but abstinence from Swynes fleshe, and yet many of them do eate thereof priuilie. They tell me that theyr natiue countrey hath name <HI>Camarian,</HI> a fyrme lande, wherein be many kynges, and the Indishe countrey well knowen vnto them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">It shoulde seeme by their voyage to be <HI>Cardandan in Ortelius.</HI></NOTE> It may so be: for as sone as they dyd see our seruauntes (our ser∣uauntes were <HI>Preuzaretes</HI>) they iudged them to be Indians: many of theyr woordes sounded vppon the Persike tongue, but none of vs coulde vnderstand them. I asked them whether they conuerted any of the <HI>Chinishe</HI> nation vnto theyr secte: they an∣sweared me, that with much a do they conuerted the women with whom they do marry, yeldyng me no other cause thereof, but the difficultie they find in them to be brought from eating swines fleshe and drynking of wine. I am perswaded therfore, that if this countrey were in league with vs, forbyddyng them neyther of both, it would be an easy matter to draw them to our religion, from theyr superstition, wherat they them selues do laugth when they do their Idolatrie. I haue learned moreouer that the sea wherby these Moores that came to <HI>China,</HI> were woont to trauaile, is a very great gulfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It seemeth they came vp the ri∣uer from the Caspian sea.</NOTE> that falleth into this countrey out from <HI>Tartaria</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> leauing on the other syde all the countrey of <HI>China,</HI> and lande of the <HI>Mogorites,</HI> drawyng alwayes towarde the south: and of all lykelyhood it is euen so, because that these Moores, the whiche we haue seene, be rather browne then white, wherby they shewe them selues to come from some warmer countrey then <HI>China</HI> is, neere to <HI>Pachin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">At cacan.</NOTE> where the

<P>We dyd see in this citie many <HI>Tartares, Mogorites, Bremes,</HI> and <HI>Laoynes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ali. Auoins Tartares.</NOTE> both men &amp; women. The <HI>Tartares</HI> are men very white, good horsemen and archers, confinyng with <HI>China</HI> on that side where <HI>Pachin</HI> standeth, separated from thence by great moun∣taines that are betwyxt these kingdomes. Ouer them be certaine wayes to passe, and for both sydes, Castelles continually keapte with souldiers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mounte Vsont.</NOTE> in tyme past the <HI>Tartares</HI> were woont alwayes to haue warrs with the <HI>Chineans,</HI> but these fourescore yeeres past they were quiete, vntyll the seconde yeere of our imprysonment.

The Moores affirmed, that where the kyng lyeth, there be many <HI>Tartares</HI> and <HI>Mogori∣tes,</HI> that brought into <HI>China</HI> certayne blewes of great valewe: al we thought it to be <HI>Vanil</HI> of <HI>Cambaia</HI> woont to be sold at <HI>Ormus.</HI> So that this is the true situation of that countrey, not in the Northpartes, as many tymes I haue harde saye, confynyng with Germanie.</P>
<P>As for the Bremes we haue seene in this citie <HI>Chenchi</HI> certaine men &amp; women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bremes.</NOTE> amongst whom there was one that came not long since, hauyng as yet her heare tyed vp after the <HI>Pegues</HI> fashion: this woman, and other moe with whom a blacke Moore damsell in our companye had conference, and dyd vnderstande them well ynough, had dwelte in <HI>Peghu.</HI> This newe come woman, imaginyng that we ment to make our abode in that citie, byd vs to be of good comforte, for that her countrey was not distant from thence aboue fiue dayes iourney, and that out of her coun∣trey there laye a hygh way for vs home into our owne. Beyng asked the way, she aunsweared that the fyrst three dayes the way lyeth ouer certayne great mountaynes and wyldernesse, afterwarde people to be mette withall agayne. Thence two

dayes iorney more to the Breames countrey. Wherfore I doo conclude, that <HI>Chenchi</HI> is one of the confynes of this kyngdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Southwarde from Chenchi to the sea.</NOTE> seperated by certayne huge mountaynes, as it hath been already sayd, that lye out towardes the South. In the residue of these mountaynes standeth the prouince <HI>Sian,</HI> the <HI>Laoyns</HI> countrey, <HI>Cambaia, Chinapa,</HI> and <HI>Cochinchina.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Auoins.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>This citie, cheefe of other syxteene, is situated in a pleasaunt playne, aboundyng in thynges necessarie, sea fysh only excepted,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chenchi.</HI></NOTE> for it standeth farre from the sea: of freshe fyshe so muche store, that the market places are neuer emptie. The walles of this citie are very strong and hygh: one day dyd I see the <HI>Louteas</HI> thereof go vpon the walles, to take the viewe thereof, borne in theyr seates I spake of before, accompanied with a troupe of horsemen, that went two and two: It was tolde me they myght haue gone three and three. We haue seene moreouer, that with∣in this aforesayde citie the kyng hath moe than a thousand of his kynne lodged in great pallaces, in diuers partes of the citie: theyr gates be redde, and the entrye into theyr houses, that they may be knowen, for that is the kyng his colour. These gentle∣men, accordyng to theyr nearenesse in blood vnto the kyng, as soone as they be maried, receiue theyr place in honour: this place neither encreaseth nor diminisheth in any respect, as long as the kyng lyueth, the kyng appoynteth them theyr wyues and fami∣lie, allowyng them by the Moneth al thynges necessarie abun∣dantly, as he doth to his gouernours of shyres and cities, howe∣beit, not one of these hath as long as he lyueth, any charge or go∣uernment at al. They geue them selues to eatyng and drinkyng▪ and be for the most part burly men of bodie, insomuche that espi∣yng any one of them, whom we had not seene before, we myght knowe hym to be the kyng his cosyn. They be neuerthelesse very pleasaunt, courteous, and fayre conditioned: ne dyd we finde, al the time we were in that citie, so much honour and good entertaynement any where, as at theyr handes. They byd vs to theyr houses, to eate and drynke, and when they founde vs not, or were not wyllyng to go with them, they byd our seruantes, &amp; slaues, causing them to syt down with the first. Notwithstanding the good lodging these gentlemen haue so commodious that they
<PB REF="261"/>
want nothyng, yet are they in this bondage, that duryng lyfe they neuer goe abrode. The cause, as I dyd vnderstand, where∣fore the kyng so vseth his cousynes, is that none of them at a∣nye tyme may rebell agaynst hym: and thus he shutteth them vp in three or foure other cities. Most of them can play on the Lute: and to make that kynde of pastyme peculier vnto them only, all other in the cities where they do lyue be forbydden that instru∣ment, the Curtisans and blynde folke only excepted, who be mu∣sitions, and can play.</P>
<P>This king furthermore for the greater securitie of his realme, and the auoydyng of tumultes, letteth not one in al his countrey to be called Lord, except he be of his blood. Many great estates and gouernours there be, that duryng theyr office are lodged Lordlyke, and do beare the port of myghtie Princes: but they be so many tymes displaced, and other placed a newe, that they haue not the whyle to become corrupt. True it is that duryng theyr office they be well prouided for, as afterwarde also lod∣ged at the kynges charges, and in pension as long as they liue, payde them Monethly in the cities where they dwel, by certaine officers appoynted for that purpose. The kyng then is a Lorde only, not one besydes hym as you haue seene, except it be suche as be of his blood. A Nephewe lykewyse of the kyng, the kyng his systers sonne, lyeth continually within the walles of the citie, in a strong pallace built Castelwyse, euen as his other cousins do, remaynyng alwayes within doores, serued by Eunuches, neuer dealyng with any matters. Their festiuall dayes, newe Moones, and ful Moones the magistrates make great bankets, &amp; so do such as be of the king his blood. The king his Nephewe hath name <HI>Vanfuli,</HI> his pallace is walled about, the wall is not high, but foure square, and in circuit nothing inferiour to the walles of <HI>Goa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goa is a citie of the Portu∣gales in East Indie.</NOTE> the outside is painted red, in euery square a gate, &amp; ouer each gate a tower, made of timber excellently wel wrought: before the principal gate of the foure, that openeth into the high streat, no <HI>Loutea,</HI> be he neuer so great, may passe on horsbacke, or carried in his seat. Amydde this quadrangle standeth the pal∣lace where that gentleman lieth, doubtlesse worth the sight, although we came not in to see it. By report the roofes of the towers and house, are glased greene, the greater part of the
<PB N="253" REF="261"/>
<HI>Quadrangle</HI> set with sauage trees, as Okes, Chestnuttes, Cypres, Pineapples, Cedars, and other suche lyke that we do wante, after the maner of a wood, wherin are keapt Stagges, Oxen, and other beastes, for that Lorde his recreation neuer go∣yng abrode, as I haue sayde. One preheminence this citie hath aboue the reste where we haue been, and it of ryght as we do thynke, that besydes the multitude of market places, wherein all thynges are to be solde, through euery streate continually are cryed all thynges necessarie, as fleshe of all sortes, freshe-fyshe, hearbes, oyle, vineger, meale, rise, <HI>in summa,</HI> al thinges so plentifully, that many houses neede no seruauntes, euery thing beyng brought to theyr doores. Most part of the merchantes remayne in the suburbes, for that y<SUP>e</SUP> cities are shut vp euery night as I haue sayde. The merchantes therefore the better to attende theyr businesse, do chuse rather to make theyr abode without in the suburbes, then within the citie. I haue seene in this ryuer a pretie kynde of fyshyng, not to be omitted in my opinion, and therefore wyll I set it downe. The kyng hath in many ryuers good store of barges full of sea crowes, that breede, are fedde, and do dye therein, in certayne cages, allowed monethly a cer∣tayne prouision of ryse. These barges the kyng bestoweth vp∣pon his greatest magistrates, geuyng to some two, to some three of them, as he thynketh good, to fyshe therewithall after this maner. At the houre appoynted to fyshe, all the barges are brought togeather in a circle, where the ryuer is shalowe, and the crowes, tyed togeather vnder the wynges, are let leape downe into the water, some vnder, some aboue, worth the lookyng vppon: eche one as he hath filled his bagge, goeth to his owne barge and emptieth it, whiche done, he retourneth to fyshe agayne. Thus hauyng taken good store of fyshe, they set the crowes at libertie, and do suffer them to fyshe for theyr owne pleasure. There were in that citie, where I was, twentie barges at the least of these aforesayde crowes· I wente almost euery day to see them, yet coulde I neuer be throughly satisfied to see so straunge a kynde of fyshyng.</P>

<HEAD>¶ Of the Ilande Giapan, and other litle Isles in the East Ocean.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By R. Wylles.</BYLINE>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He extreme part of the knowen worlde vn∣to vs, is the noble Ilande <HI>Ciapan,</HI> written otherwyse <HI>Iapon</HI> and <HI>Iapan.</HI> This Iland standeth in the East Ocean, beyonde all <HI>Asie,</HI> betwixte <HI>Cathayo</HI> &amp; the West Indies 36. degrees Northwarde from the <HI>aequi∣noctial</HI> line, in the same clime with the South part of Spayne and Portugall, distant from thence by sea .6000. leagues: the trauayle thyther, both for ciuile dis∣corde, great piracie, and often shipwrackes, very daungerous. This countrey is hylly, and pestred with snowe, wherefore it is nether so warme as Portugall, &amp; yet very poore, as farre as we can learne, wantyng oyle, butter, cheese, mylke, egges, suger, honny, vyneger, saffarne, cynamome, and pepper. Barly branne the Ilanders do vse in steede of salte: medicinable thinges holsome for the body haue they none at al. Neuerthelesse in that Iland sundry fruites do grow, not much vnlike the fruites of Spayne: &amp; great store of Syluer mynes are therin to be seene. The people tractable, ciuile, wyttye, courteous, without de∣ceyte, in vertue and honest conuersation exceedyng all other na∣tions lately discouered, but so muche standyng vppon theyr re∣putation, that theyr chiefe Idole may be thought honour. The contempte therof causeth among them much discord and debate, manslaughter and murther: euen for theyr reputation they do honour theyr parentes, keepe theyr promises, absteyne from adultery and robberyes, punyshing by death the least robbery done, holdyng for a prynciple, that whosoeuer stealeth a tryfle, wyll if he see occasion steale a greater thing. It may be thefte is so seuerely punished of them, for that the nation is oppressed with scarcitie of al thynges necessarye, and so poore, that euen for mi∣serie they strangle theyr owne chyldren, preferring death before want. These felowes do nether eate nor kyll any foule. They lyue chiefely by fyshe, hearbes, and fruites, so healthfully, that they dye very olde. Of Ryce and Wheate there is no great store.

No man is ashamed there of his pouertie, ne be theyr gentle∣men therfore lesse honored of the meaner people, ne wyl the poo∣rest gentleman there▪ matche his chylde with the baser sort for a∣ny gayne, so muche they do make more accompt of gentry then of wealth. The greatest delyght they haue, is in armorie, eache boy at fourteene yeeres of age, be he borne gentle or otherwyse, hath his swoorde and dagger: very good archers they be, con∣tempnyng all other nations in comparison of theyr manhood and prowesse, puttyng not vp one iniurie, be it neuer so small in worde or deede, among them selues. They feede moderately, but they drynke largely. The vse of vines they knowe not theyr drinke they make of Ryce, vtterly they do abhorre dyse, and all games, accomptyng nothyng more vyle in a man, then to geue hym selfe vnto those thynges, that make vs greedie and desirous to get other mens goodes. If at any time they do sweare, for that seldome they are wont to do, they sweare by the Sunne: many of them are taught good letters, wherfore they may so much the soo∣ner be brought vnto Christianitie.

The fyrst place is due vnto the hygh priest, by whose lawes and decrees, al publique and priuate matters, apparteynyng vnto religion, are decided.

Finallye, this hygh priest, wont to be chosen in <HI>China,</HI> for his wisdome and learnyng: made in <HI>Giapan,</HI> for his gentry and byrth: hath so large a Dominion, and reuenewes so great, that eftsones he beardeth the pety Kinges, and Princes there.</P>
<P><PB REF="263"/>Theyr seconde principall Magistrate, in theyr language <HI>Vo,</HI> is the cheefe Herehaught, made by succession and byrth, hono∣red as a God. This gentleman neuer toucheth the grounde with his foote without forfaytyng of his office, he neuer goeth abrode out of his house, nor is at all tymes to be seene. At home he is ey∣ther carried about in a lytter, or els he goeth in woodden Chop∣pines a foote hygh from the grounde: commonly he sitteth in his Chayre with a swoord in one syde, and a bowe and arrowes in the other, next his body he weareth blacke, his outwarde gar∣ment is redde, all shadowed ouer with Cipresse, at his cap hang certayne Lambeaux much lyke vnto a Bishops Myter, his fore∣head is paynted whyte and red, he eateth his meate in earthen Dishes. This Herehaught determineth in all <HI>Giapan</HI> the diuers tytles of honour, whereof in that Iland is great plentie, eache one perticularly knowen by his badge, commonly seene in sea∣lyng vp theyr letters, and dayly altered accordyng to theyr de∣grees. About this <HI>Vo</HI> euery noble man hath his Soliciter, for the nation is so desirous of prayse and honour, that they stryue a∣mong them selues who may brybe hym best.

This kynde of death they take to be without infamy, ne doe their children, for theyr fathers crime so punished, lose theyr goods. But if the king reserue them to be executed by the Hangman, than flocketh hee togeather his children, his seruantes, and friendes home to his house, to preserue his lyfe by force. The kyng committeth the fet∣chyng of him out vnto his chiefe Iudge, who first setteth vppon him with bow and arrowes, &amp; afterward with pykes &amp; swoords, vntyll the rebell and all his family be slayne, to theyr perpetuall ignominie and shame.</P>

<P>The inhabiters of <HI>Giapan,</HI> as men that neuer had greatly to doe with other nations, in their Geography diuided the whole world into three partes, <HI>Giapan, Sian,</HI> and <HI>China.</HI> And albeit the <HI>Giapans</HI> receyued out of <HI>Sian,</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> their superstitions and cerimonies, yet doe they neuerthelesse contemne all other nati∣ons in comparison of them selues, &amp; standyng in their owne con∣ceite doe far preferre them selues before all other sortes of people in wisedome and policie.</P>
<P>Touching the situation of the countrey, &amp; nature of the soyle, vnto the thinges eftsones erft written, this one thing wil I adde: in these Ilandes the sommer to be most hot, the winter extreame colde. In the kyngdome of <HI>Canga,</HI> as we call it, falleth so muche
<PB N="254" REF="264"/>
snow, that the houses being buried in it, y<SUP>e</SUP> inhabiters keepe with∣in doores certaine moneths of the yeere, hauing no way to come foorth except they breake vp the tiles. Whirlewyndes most ve∣hement, Earthquakes so common, that the <HI>Giapans</HI> dreade suche kinde of feares litle or nothing at all. The countrey is full of sil∣uer mines, otherwyse barren, not so much by fault of nature, as through the slouthfulnes of the inhabiters: howebeit Oxen they keepe, &amp; that for tillage sake onely. The ayre is wholsome, y<SUP>e</SUP> wa∣ters good, the people very fayre &amp; well bodied: bare headed com∣monly they go, procuring baldnes with sorow &amp; teares, eftsoones rooting vp w<SUP>t</SUP> pinsars al the heare of their heads as it groweth, ex∣cept it be a litle behind, the which they knot and keepe with al di∣ligence. Euen from their chyldehood they weare daggers and swoords, the which they vse to lay vnder their pillows whan they goe to bedde: in shew curteous and affable: in deede haughty and proude. They delight most in warlyke affayres, and their grea∣test studie is armes. Mennes apparell dyuersly coloured, is worne downe halfe the legges, and to the elbowes: womens at∣tyre made hansomely, lyke vnto a vayle, is somewhat longer: all maner of dysyng and theft they doe eschue. The merchant, although he bee wealthie, is not accompted of. Gentlemen, be they neuer so poore, retayne theyr place: most precysely they stande vppon theyr honour and woorthynesse, cerimoniously stryuyng among them selues in curtesies and fayre speaches. Wherein if any one happely bee lesse carefull than hee should bee, euen for a trifle many tymes hee getteth euyll will. Want, though it trouble most of them, so muche they doe deteste, that poore men cruelly takyng pietie of theyr infantes newly borne, especially gyrles, doe many tymes with theyr owne feete stran∣gle them. Noble men, and other lykewyse of meaner calling, ge∣nerally haue but one wyfe a peece, by whom although they haue issue, yet for a trifle they diuorse themselues from their wiues, and the wiues also sometimes from their husbands, to marry with o∣thers. After y<SUP>e</SUP> seconde degree, coosins may there lawfully marry. Adoption of other mens children is much vsed among them. In great townes most men and women can write and reade.</P>
<P>This nation feedeth sparely, theyr vsuall meate is ryse and salattes, and neare the sea syde fyshe. They feast one an

other many tymes, wherein they vse great diligence, especially i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drinkyng one to an other, insomuch that the better sorte, least they myght rudely commit some fault therin, doe vse to reade certaine bookes written of dueties and cerimonies apperteynyng vnto bankettes. To be delicate and fine, they put theyr meat into their mouthes with litle forkes, accompting it great rudenes to touch it with theyr fingers: wynter and sommer they drynke water as hot as they may possible abyde it. Theyr houses are in daunger of fyre, but finely made, and cleane, layde all ouer with straw pal∣lettes, wherevppon they doe both sit in steede of stooles, and lye in theyr clothes, with billets vnder theyr heades. For feare of de∣filyng these pallettes, they goe eyther barefoote within doores, or weare strawe pantofles on theyr buskynnes whan they come a∣broade, the which they laye asyde at theyr returne home agayne. Gentlemen for the most parte doe passe the nyght in banketting, musike, and vayne discourses, they sleepe the day tyme. In <HI>Mea∣co</HI> and <HI>Sacaio</HI> there is good store of beddes, but they be very litle, and may be compared vnto our pues.</P>
<P>In bryngyng vp theyr children they vse wordes onely to re∣buke them, admonishyng as diligently and aduisedly boyes of six or seuen yeeres age, as though they were olde men. They are gi∣uen very much to entertayne strangers, of whom most curiously they loue to aske euen in trifles what forreyne nations doe, and theyr fashions. Suche argumentes and reasons as be manifest, and are made playne with examples, doe greatly persuade them. They detest all kynde of theft, whosoeuer is taken in that faulte may be slayne freely of any body. No publike prisons, no com∣mon gayles, no ordinary Iusticers: priuately eche householder hath the hearyng of matters at home in his owne house, and the punishyng of greater crymes that deserue death without delaye. Thus vsually the people is kept in awe and feare.</P>
<P>About foure hundred yeeres agoe (as in theyr olde recordes we fynde) all <HI>Giapan</HI> was subiecte vnto one <HI>Emperor,</HI> whose royall seate was <HI>Meaco,</HI> in the <HI>Giaponishe</HI> language called <HI>Cubucama.</HI> But the nobilitie rebellyng agaynst him, by litle and litle haue taken away the greatest parte of his dominion, howbeit his title continually remayneth, and the residue in some respect doe make great accompt of him stil, acknowledging him for theyr superior.
<PB N="255" REF="265"/>
Thus the Empyre of <HI>Giapan,</HI> in tymes past but one alone, is now diuided into sixtie sixe kyngdomes, the onely cause of ciuile warres continually in that Iland, to no small hynderaunce of the Gospell, whilest the kynges that dwell neare togeather inuade one an other, eche one couetyng to make his kyngdome greater. Furthermore in the citie <HI>Meaco</HI> is the pallace of the high priest, whom that nation honoureth as a God, he hath in his house .366. Idolles, one whereof by course is euery nyght set by his syde for a watcheman. He is thought of the common people so holy, that it may not be lawfull for him to goe vppon the earth: if happely he doe set one foote to the grounde, he looseth his office. He is not serued very sumptuously, he is maynteined by almes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But his almes are very good.</NOTE> The heads and beards of his ministers are shauen, they haue name <HI>Cangues,</HI> and theyr aucthoritie is great throughout all <HI>Giapan.</HI> The <HI>Cubu∣cama</HI> vseth them for Embassadours to decide controuersies be∣twixte princes, and to ende theyr warres, whereof they are wont to make very great gayne. It is now two yeeres since, or there a∣bout, that one of them came to <HI>Bungo,</HI> to entreat of peace betwixt the kyng thereof, and the kyng of <HI>Amanguzzo.</HI> This Agent fa∣uouring the kyng of <HI>Bungo</HI> his cause more than the other, brought to passe that the foresayde kyng of <HI>Bungo</HI> should keepe two king∣domes, the which he had taken in warres from the king of <HI>Aman∣guzzo.</HI> Wherefore he had for his rewarde of the kyng of <HI>Bungo</HI> aboue thirtie thousande Ducattes. And thus farre heereof.</P>
<P>I come now to other superstitions and ceremonies, that you may see, deare brethren, that whiche I sayde in the beginnyng, howe surlye the deuyll hath deceyued the <HI>Giaponishe</HI> nation, and howe diligent and ready they be to obey and worshyp him. And first, all remembrance and knowledge not onely of Christ our re∣deemer, but also of that one God the maker of all thinges, is cleane extinguished, &amp; vtterly abolished out of the <HI>Giapans</HI> hartes. Moreouer theyr superstitious sectes are many, wheras it is law∣full for eche one to folow that which lyketh him best: but the prin∣cipall sectes are two, namely the <HI>Amidans</HI> and <HI>Xacaians.</HI> Wher∣fore in this countrey shall you see many monasteryes, not onely of <HI>Bonzii</HI> men, but also of <HI>Bonziae</HI> women diuersly attyred, for some doe weare whyte vnder, and blacke vpper garments, other goe apparelled in ashe colour, &amp; theyr Idole hath name <HI>Denichi:</HI>
<PB REF="266"/>
from these the <HI>Amidanes</HI> differ very muche. Agayne the men <HI>Bonzii</HI> for the most parte dwell in sumptuous houses, and haue great reuenues. These felowes are chast by commaundement, marry they may not vnder payne of death. In the mydst of theyr Temple is erected an Aulter, whereon standeth a wodden Idole of <HI>Amida,</HI> naked from the gyrdle vpwarde, with holes in his eares, after the maner of Italian Gentlewomen, sittyng on a woodden rose, goodly to beholde. They haue great libraries, and halles for them all to dyne and suppe togeather, and belles wherewith they are certayne houres called to prayers. In the euenyng the Superintendent gyueth eche one a theame for me∣ditation. After mydnyght before the Aulter in theyr Temple they doe say Mattens as it were out of <HI>Xaca</HI> his last booke, one quier one verse, the other quier an other. Early in the mornyng eche one gyueth him selfe to meditation one houre: they shaue theyr heades and beardes. Theyr Cloysters be very large, and within the precincte thereof, Chappelles of the <HI>Fo∣toquiens,</HI> for by that name some of the <HI>Giapanish</HI> Sainctes are called: theyr holydayes yeerely be very many. Most of these <HI>Bonzii</HI> be Gentlemen, for that the <HI>Giaponish</HI> nobilitie, charged with many children, vse to make most of them <HI>Bonzii,</HI> not be∣ing able to leaue for eche one a patrymony good ynough. The <HI>Bonzii</HI> most couetously bent, know all the wayes howe to come by money. They sell vnto the people many scroles of paper, by the helpe whereof the common people thinketh it selfe war∣ranted from all power of the deuylles. They borowe lyke∣wyse money to bee repayde with great vsury in an other world, gyuyng by Obligation vnto the lender an assuraunce thereof, the whiche departyng out of this lyfe hee may carry with him to hell.</P>
<P>There is an other great company of suche as are called <HI>I∣nambuxu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inambuxu.</HI></NOTE> with curlde and staryng heare. They make profession to fynde out agayne thinges either lost or stolen, after this sorte. They set before them a chylde, whom the deuyll inuadeth, cal∣led vp thither by charmes: of that chylde than doe they aske that which they are desirous to know.</P>
<P>These mens prayers both good and bad are thought greatly to preuayle, insomuch that both their blessinges and theyr curses
<PB N="256" REF="266"/>
they sell vnto the people. The Nouices of this order, before they be admitted, goe togeather two or three thousande in a com∣pany, vp a certayne high mountayne to do pennance there, three∣score dayes voluntarily punishyng them selues. In this tyme the deuyl sheweth him selfe vnto them in sundry shapes: and they, lyke young graduates, admitted as it were felowes into some certayne company, are set foorth with whyte tasselles hanging about theyr neckes, and blacke Bonettes that scarsely couer any more than the crowne of theyr heades. Thus attyred they range abrode in all <HI>Giapan,</HI> to set out them selues and their cun∣nyng to sale, eche one beatyng his basen hee carryeth alwayes about with him, to gyue notice of theyr commyng in all townes where they passe.</P>
<P>There is also an other sorte called <HI>Genguis,</HI> that make pro∣fession to shewe by southsaying where stolen thinges are,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Genguis.</HI></NOTE> and who were the theeues. These dwel in the toppe of an high moun∣tayne, blacke in face for the continuall heate of the sunne, for the colde, wyndes, and raynes they doe continually endure. They marry but in theyr owne tribe and lyne: the reporte goeth that they bee horned beastes. They clyme vp most hygh rockes and hylles, and goe ouer very great ryuers by the onely arte of the deuyll, who to bryng those wretches the more into errour, byddeth them to goe vp a certayne hygh mountayne, where they stande myserably gazing and earnestly lookyng for him as long as the deuyll appoynteth them. At the length at noone∣tyde, or in the euenyng, commeth that deuil, whom they call <HI>Ami∣da,</HI> among them to shewe him selfe vnto them: this shew breedeth in the braynes and hartes of men suche a kynde of superstition, that it can by no meanes be rooted out of them afterwarde.</P>
<P>The deuyll was wont also in an other mountaine to shewe him selfe vnto the <HI>Giaponish</HI> nation. Who so was more desirous than other, to go to heauen and to enioy Paradyse, thyther went he to see that syght, and hauyng seene the deuyll, folowed hym, so by the deuyll persuaded, into a denne vntyll hee came to a deepe pytte. Into this pytte the deuyll was wont to leape, &amp; to take with him his worshypper whom he there murdred. This deceit was thus perceyued. An olde man blynded with this superstiti∣on, was by his sonne dissuaded from thence, but all in vayne.
<PB REF="267"/>
Wherefore his sonne folowed him priuely into that denne with his bowe and arrowes, where the deuyll gallantly appeared vn∣to him in the shape of a man. Whilest the olde man falleth downe to worshyp the deuyll, his sonne speedily shootyng an arrow at the spirite so appearyng, stroke a Foxe in steede of a man, so so∣deynly was that shape altered. This old man his sonne trackyng the Foxe so runnyng away, came to that pit wherof I spake, and in the bottome thereof he founde many bones of dead men, decey∣ued by the deuyll after that sorte in tyme past. Thus deliuered hee his father from present death, and all other from so pestilent an opinion.</P>
<P>There is furthermore a place bearyng name <HI>Coia,</HI> very famous for the multitude of Abbeyes the <HI>Bonzii</HI> haue therin. The begin∣ner and founder whereof is thought to be one <HI>Combendaxis</HI> a sut∣tle craftie felowe, that gotte the name of holynesse by cunnyng speache, although the lawes and ordinances he made were alto∣geather deuilishe: he is sayde to haue founde out the <HI>Giapanishe</HI> letters vsed at this day. In his later yeeres this Sim suttle bury∣ed him selfe in a fouresquare graue, foure cubites deepe, seuerely forbyddyng it to be opened, for that than he dyed not, but rested his body, wearyed with continuall businesse, vntyll many thou∣sande thousandes of yeeres were passed, after the whiche tyme a great learned man named <HI>Mirozu</HI> should come into <HI>Giapan,</HI> and than would he ryse vp out of his graue agayne. About his tumbe many lampes are lyghted, sent thyther out of dyuers prouinces, for that the people is persuaded, that whosoeuer is liberall and beneficiall towardes the beautifying of that monument, shall not onely encrease in wealth in this worlde, but in the lyfe to come be safe through <HI>Combendaxis</HI> helpe. Suche as gyue them selues to worship him, liue in those Monasteries or Abbayes, with shauen heads, as though they had forsaken all secular matters, wheras in deede they wallow in all sortes of wickednesse and lust. In these houses, the which are many (as I sayde) in number, doe remaine 6000. <HI>Bonzii,</HI> or thereabout, besydes the multitude of laye men: women be restrayned from thence vppon payne of death. An other company of <HI>Bonzii</HI> dwelleth at <HI>Fatonochaiti.</HI> They teache a great multitude of children all trickes and sleightes of guyle and theft: whom they doe fynde to be of great towardnesse, those
<PB N="257" REF="267"/>
doe they instruct in all the petigrues of princes, and fashions of the nobilitie, in chiualry, &amp; eloquence, and so send them abrode in∣to other prouinces, attyred lyke young princes, to this ende, that faynyng them selues to be nobly borne, they may with great summes of money, borowed vnder the colour and pretence of no∣bilitie, returne agayne. Wherefore this place is so infamous in all <HI>Giapan,</HI> that if any schollar of that order bee happely taken abrode, hee incontinently dyeth for it. Neuerthelesse these cou∣syners leaue not dayly to vse theyr wonted wickednesse and knauery.</P>
<P>North from <HI>Giapan,</HI> three hundred leagues out of <HI>Meaco,</HI> ly∣eth a great countrey of sauage men, clothed in beastes skynnes, rough bodyed, with huge beardes, and monstruous muchaches, the which they hold vp with litle forkes as they drynke. These people are great drinkers of wyne, fierce in warres, and much feared of the <HI>Giapans:</HI> beyng hurte in fight, they washe theyr woundes with salte water, other surgery haue they none. In theyr brestes they are sayde to carry lookyng glasses: their swor∣des they tye to theyr heades, in suche wyse, that the handle doe rest vppon their shoulders. Seruice and cerimonies haue they none at all, onely they are wont to woorshyppe heauen. To <HI>Aquita,</HI> a great towne in that <HI>Giaponishe</HI> kyngdome, we call <HI>Ge∣uano,</HI> they muche resort for merchandyse, and the <HI>Aquitanes</HI> lyke∣wyse doe traueyle into theyr countrey, howebeit not often, for that there many of them are slayne by the inhabiters.</P>
<P>Muche more concernyng this matter I had to wryte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Giapo∣nish Funerals.</NOTE> but to auoyde tediousnesse, I will come to speake of the <HI>Giapans</HI> mad∣nesse agayne, who most desirous of vayne glory, doe thynke than specially to geat immortall fame, whan they procure them selues to bee most sumptuously and solempnely buryed. theyr buryalles and obsequies in the citie <HI>Meaco,</HI> are done after this maner. About one houre before the dead body be brought foorth, a great multitude of his friendes, apparelled in theyr best aray, go before vnto the fyre, with them goe theyr kyns women, and such as bee of theyr acquayntaunce, clothed in whyte (for that is the mournyng colour there) with a chaungeable coloured vayle on theyr heades. Eche woman hath with her also, accordyng to her abilitie, all her famely trymmed vp in whyte silke m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c∣cado:

the better sorte and wealthier women goe in litters of <HI>Cae∣dar,</HI> artificially wrought, and richly dressed. In the seconde place marcheth a great company of footemen sumptuously apparelled. Than a far of commeth one of these <HI>Bonzii,</HI> maister of the cerimo∣nies for that superstition, brauely clad in silkes &amp; golde, in a large &amp; high lytter excellently wel wrought, accompanied with .30. o∣ther <HI>Bonzii,</HI> or thereabout, wearing hattes, linnen albes, and fyne blacke vpper garments. Than attired in ashe colour (for this co∣lour also is mourning) with a long torch of pineaple, sheweth the dead body the way vnto the fyre, least it either stumble, or igno∣rantly goe out of the way. Welneare .200. <HI>Bonzii</HI> folow him sin∣ging the name of that deuill the which the partie deceassed chiefly did woorship by his life tyme, and therwithall a very great basen is beaten, euen to the place of fire, in steed of a bel. Than folow two great paper baskets hanged open at staues endes, full of paper roses diuersly coloured: such as beare them, doe march but slow∣ly, shaking euer now &amp; than their staues, that the aforesaid floures may fall downe by litle &amp; litle, as it were droppes of rayne, and be whirled about with the wynd. This shoure say they is an argu∣ment that the soule of the dead man is gone to Paradyse. After all this, eight beardles <HI>Bonzii</HI> orderly two and two dragge after them on the ground long speares, the pointes backewarde, with flagges of one cubite a peece, wherin the name also of that Idole is written. Than he there carried te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lanternes trimmed with the former inscription, ouercast with a fine vayle, and candelles burning in them. Besides this, two young men clothed in ashe co∣lour, beare pineaple torches, not lighted, of three foote length, the which torches serue to kindle the fyre wherein the dead corpes is to be burnt. In the same colour folow many other that weare on the crownes of their heades fayre, litle, threesquare, blacke lethren caps, tied fast vnder their chins (for y<SUP>t</SUP> is honorable amōgst them) with papers on their heads, wherin the name of y<SUP>e</SUP> deuyll, I spake of, is written. And to make it the more solempne, after commeth a man with a table one cubite long▪ one foote broad, couered with a very fine whyte vayle, in both sides wherof is written in golden letters the aforesaid name. At the length by foure men is brought foorth the corpes sitting in a gorgeous ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, clothed in whyte, hanging downe his head, and holding his handes togeather lyke

The dead man his children come next after him most gallantly set foorth, the yongest wherof carrieth lykewyse a pineaple torch to kyndle the fyre. Last of all foloweth a great number of people in suche cannes as erst spake of.</P>
<P>Whan they are al come to the place appointed for the obsequie, all the <HI>Bonzii</HI> with the whole multitude, for the space of one hour, beating pannes &amp; basens with great clamors, cal vpon the name of that deuill, the which being ended, the obsequie is done in this maner. In the midst of a great quadrangle, rayled about, hanged with course lynnen, and agreeably vnto the foure partes of the world, made with foure gates to goe in and out at, is digged a hole: in the hole is layde good store of wood, whereon is raysed gallantly a waued roofe, before that stande two tables furnished with diuers kyndes of meates, especially dry figges, Pomegra∣nates, and tartes good store, but neyther fyshe nor fleshe: vpon one of them standeth also a chaffre with coles, and in it sweete wood to make perfumes. Whan all this is ready, the corde wherewith the lytter was carried, is throwen by a long rope into the fyre: as many as are present stryue to take the rope in their handes, vsing theyr aforesayd clamors, which done, they goe in procession as it were rounde about the quadrangle thryse. Than setting the lytter on the wood buylte vp ready for the fyre, that <HI>Bonzius</HI> who than is maister of the cerimonies, sayeth a verse that no bodie there vnderstandeth, whyrlyng thryse about ouer his head a torche lyghted, to signifie thereby that the soule of the dead man had neyther any begynnyng, ne shall haue at any tyme an ende, and throweth away the torche. Two of the dead man his children, or of his neare kynne, take it vp agayne, and standyng one at the East syde of the lytter, the other at the West, doe for honour and reuerence, reache it to eche o∣ther thryse ouer the dead corpes, and so cast it into the pyle of wood: by and by they throwe in oyle, sweete wood, and other perfumes, accordyngly as they haue plentie, and so with a great flame bryng the corpes to ashes: his chyldren in the meane

<P>The next day returne to the place of obsequie the dead man his children, his kynread, and friendes, who geatheryng vp his asshes, bones, and teeth, doe put them in a gylded potte, and so carry them home, to be set vp in the same pot couered with cloth, in the mydst of theyr houses. Many <HI>Bonzii</HI> returne lykewise to these priuate funeralles, and so doe they agayne the seuenth day. than carry they out the asshes to bee buryed in a place ap∣poynted, laying therevppon a fouresquare stone, wherein is written in great letters, drawen all the length of the stone ouer, the name of that deuyll the which the dead man woorshypped by his lyfe tyme. Euery day afterwarde his children resorte vnto that graue, with roses and warme water, that the deade corpes thirst not. Nor the seuenth day onely, but the seuenth moneth, and yeere, within theyr owne houses they renue this obsequie, to no small commodities and gayne of the <HI>Bonzii:</HI> great ryche men doe spende in these theyr funeralles .3000. ducates, or there about, the meaner sorte two or three hundred.

And first they go certaine dayes begging almes, the which they thrust into theyr sleeues, than preache they in publyke a sermon vnto the people, declaring what they mynd to doe, with the great good lykyng of all suche as doe heare them: for euery body wondreth at such a kynd of holynesse.

The emptie barke is out of hande set a fyre, for honour sake, by theyr friendes that folowe them in an other boate of their owne, thynkyng it blasphemie that any mortal creature should afterward once touche the barke that had been so religiously halowed.</P>
<P>Truely whan we went to <HI>Meaco,</HI> eyght dayes before we came to the Isle of <HI>Hiu,</HI> at <HI>Fore</HI> towne, sixe men and two women so dy∣ed. To all suche as dye so, the people erecteth a Chappell, and to eche of them a pyllar and a pole made of pinaple, for a perpetu∣all monument: hangyng vp many shreddes of paper in stickes all the roofe ouer, with many verses set downe in the walles, in commendation of that blessed company. Wherefore vnto this place both day and nyght many come very superstitiously in pyl∣grimage. It happened euen then as <HI>Aloisius Almeida</HI> &amp; I went to Christen a chyld, we traueyled that way, at what time foure or fiue olde women came foorth out of the aforesaide Chappel with beades in theyr handes (for in this pointe also the deuyll counter∣fayteth Christianitie) who partly scorned at vs for folly, partly frowned and taunted at our small deuotion, for passing by that holy monument, without any reuerence or woorshyp done there∣vnto at all.</P>
<P>It remayneth nowe we speake two or three woordes of those Sermons the <HI>Bonzii</HI> are wont to make, not so many as ours in number, but assuredly very wel prouided for. The Pulpit is erec∣ted in a great Temple with a silke Canapie ouer it, therein stan∣deth a costly seate, before the seate a table with a bel &amp; a booke. At the houre of sermon, eche secte of the <HI>Giapans</HI> resorteth to theyr owne doctors in diuers Temples. Up goeth the doctor into the Pulpit, and beyng set downe, after that he hath Lordlyke looked him about, signifieth silence with his bell, and so readeth a fewe woordes out of that booke we spake of, the which he expoundeth afterwarde more at large. These preachers be for the most parte eloquent, and apte to drawe with their speach the myndes of their
<PB REF="270"/>
hearers. Wherefore to this ende chiefly, suche is theyr greedy∣nesse, tendeth all theyr talke, that the people be brought vnder the colour of godlinesse to enryche theyr monasteries, promysing to eche one so much the more happinesse in the lyfe to come, howe much the greater costes &amp; charges they be at in church matters &amp; obsequies: notwithstanding this multitude of superstitious sects and companyes, and the diuersities therof amongst them selues: yet in this principally all theyr superintendentes doe traueyle, so to persuade theyr Nouices in their owne tales and lyes, that they thinke nothing els trueth, nothing els sure to come by euerlasting saluation, nothing els woorth the hearyng. Whervnto they adde other subtilties, as in going, grauitie: in countenance, apparel, and in all other outward shewe, comelynesse. Wherby the <HI>Gia∣panes</HI> myndes are so noussed in wicked opinions, and doe con∣ceyue thereby such trust and hope of euerlasting saluation, that not onely at home, but also abrode in euery corner of the towne, continually almost they runne ouer their beades, humbly asking of <HI>Amida</HI> and <HI>Xaca</HI> wealth, honour, good health, and euerlastyng ioyes. Thus than, deare brethren, may you thinke howe greatly they neede the helpe of God, that eyther doe bring the Gospel in∣to this countrey, or receiuing it brought vnto them, do forsake I∣dolatry, &amp; ioyne them selues with Christ, being assalted by so ma∣ny snares of the deuil, troubled with the dayly dissuasions of their <HI>Bonzii,</HI> and finally so iniuriously, so hardely, so sharpely vexed of their kindread and friendes, that except the grace of God obtey∣ned by the sacrifices and prayers of the Catholike church do help vs, it can not be chosen, but that the fayth and constancie of many, if not of all, in these first beginninges of our churches, will great∣ly be put in ieopardie. So much the more it standeth you vppon, that so earnestly long for the health of soules, to commende speci∣ally these <HI>Giaponish</HI> flockes vnto our Lorde.</P>

Certayne godly bookes also he hath done into that speach, not omitting to translate other as leasure suffreth him. To make an end, our Lord for his good∣nesse vouchsafe to preserue vs all continually, and to giue vs ayde both ryghtly to interprete his wil, and well to do the same.

Nowe, forasmuch as we are come to this passe, me thinke it should seeme a great discurtesie if I should not shew you al that I knowe as touching this viage, whereof I greatly mused with my selfe many yeeres by occasion of the woordes of Plinie.

But restyng a
<PB N="265" REF="275"/>
whyle in maner astonyshed in his secrete phantasie, hee tooke great pleasure therein, and sayde: forasmuch as the Portugales haue now compassed about all the South partes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The woordes of the Ambas∣sadour of Moscouia.</NOTE> supposed in old tyme to bee inaccessable by reason of great heate, why should we not certaynely thynke that the lyke may bee done about this parte of the North, without feare of colde, especially to men borne and brought vp in that clime: Yet proceedyng further, he sayde, that if his Prince and maister had men that would ani∣mate him to discouer this vyage, there was no Prince in Chri∣stendome that myght doe it with more facilitie. Then calling for a Mappe, in which was the discription of Moscouia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way from Moscouia to the North O∣cean &amp; Cathay</NOTE> and the prouinces subiect to the same, hee declared that from the citie of Moscouia or Mosca, goyng towarde the Northeast for the space of .lx. myles, they come to the ryuer of <HI>Volochda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Volochda, Vstiug.

The which way, although it bee a long tracte, as more then .800. myles, neuerthelesse he sayd that in sommer it myght commodiously be sayled. And that whereas it falleth into the sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great woods.</NOTE> there are infinite woods of goodly trees, apte to make shyppes, and the place so conuenient for this purpose, that shypwryghtes and other skylfull woorkemen for all thinges heerevnto apperteynyng, may easily come out of Germanie: also, that the men which are vsed to traueyle the sea of Germanie about the coastes of Gothlande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gothlande,</NOTE> should bee best and most apte to attempt this enterpryse, bycause they are in∣durate to abyde colde, hunger, and labour.

Unto these woordes he added, that although there were great difficultie in Moscouia, by reason that the way to the sayde sea is full of thicke woods and waters, whiche in the sommer make great mary∣shes, and impossible to be traueyled, aswell for lacke of victuals, whiche can not there be founde, not for certayne dayes, but for the space of certayne monethes, the place beyng desolate with∣out inhabitauntes: neuerthelesse he sayde, that if there were with his Prince, onely two Spanyardes or Portugales, to whom the charge of this viage should be committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commendati∣on of the Spa∣nyardes and Portugales.</NOTE> he no wayes doub∣ted but that they would folowe it, and fynde it, forasmuch as with great ingeniousnesse and inestimable pacience, these nations haue ouercome much greater difficulties then are these, whiche are but litle in comparison to those that they haue ouerpassed, and doe ouerpasse in all their viages to India.

The sayde Ambassadour continued his narration, saying that no man ought to doubt of that sea, but that it may be sayled sixe monethes in the yeere, forasmuche as the dayes are then very long in that clime, and hot, by reason of continuall reuerberation of the bea∣mes of the Sunne, and shorte nyghtes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The woorthi∣nesse of this vyage.</NOTE> And that this thing were as well woorthie to bee prooued, as anye other nauigation, whereby many partes of the worlde, heeretofore vnknowen, haue been discouered and brought to ciuilitie.

The which thing, that ryght woorthie Gentleman maister <HI>Antony di Mendoza</HI> consideryng, by the singular vertue and magnanimitie that is in him, attempted to put this thyng in practyse.

<P>And heere makyng a certayne pause, and turnyng him selfe towarde vs, hee sayde, Doe you not vnderstande to this pur∣pose, howe to passe to India towarde the Northwest wynde, as dyd of late a citizen of Uenece, so valiant a man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sebastian Ca∣bote the grand pylot of the West Indies.</NOTE> and so well prac∣tised in all thinges perteynyng to nauigations, and the science of Cosmographie, that at this present hee hath not his lyke in Spayne, insomuche that for his vertues hee is preferred aboue all other pylottes that sayle to the West Indies, who may not passe thyther without his lycence, and is therefore called <HI>Piloto Maggiore</HI> (that is) the graunde pylote. And when we sayde that wee knewe him not, hee proceeded, saying, that beyng certayne yeeres in the citie of Siuile, and desirous to haue some knowledge of the nauigations of the Spanyardes, it was tolde him that there was in the citie a valiant man, a Ueneci∣an borne, named <HI>Sebastian Cabote,</HI> who had the charge of those thinges, beyng an expert man in that science,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commendati∣on of Sebasti∣an Cabote.

who then reigned: insomuche that all men with great admira∣tion affirmed it to be a thing more diuine then humane, to sayle by the West into the East where spyces growe, by a way that was neuer knowen before.

Ne∣uerthelesse, saylyng along by the coast, to see if I could fynde any gulfe that turned, I founde the lande styll continent to the .56. degree vnder our pole: And seeyng that there the coast turned toward the East, dispayring to fynde the passage, I turned backe agayne, and sayled downe by the coast of that lande towarde the Equinoctiall (euer with intent to fynde the sayde passage to In∣dia) and came to that parte of this firme lande whiche is nowe called <HI>Florida.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The lande of Florida.</NOTE> Where, my victualles faylyng, I departed from thence, and returned into Englande, where I founde great tumultes among the people, and preparance for warres in Scot∣lande: by reason whereof, there was no more consideration had to this vyage.

<P>We will intreate of this matter, not as putting the same in question as did the olde writers, nor geathering iudgement deducted of reasons in way of argument, forasmuche as we are already more certayne by hystorie that these cold regi∣ons are inhabited.

<P>In such regions therefore, as are extended from the burnt lyne or Equinoctiall towarde the North,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The course of the Sunne.</NOTE> as much as the sunne ryseth higher ouer them, so much are they the more burnt with heat, as Affrica, bycause it ryseth highest ouer them, as they are nearest to the Equinoctial: &amp; tarying with them so much the shorter tyme, causeth shorter dayes, with longer &amp; colder nyghtes, to restore the domage of the day past, by reason of the moisture consumed by vapour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vapours.</NOTE> But in such regions ouer the which the sun ryseth lower (as in <HI>Sarmatia</HI>) it remayneth there the longer in the day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Short and warme nyghts</NOTE> and causeth so much the shorter and warmer nyghtes, as reteynyng warme vapours of the day past, which vapours helpe the woorke of the day.

<P>We haue before declared howe hygh the sunne is eleuate ouer the regions that are vnder the poles at the staye of the sunne: And so many partes is it eleuate in Rome at the staye of the sunne in wynter (that is) at the shortest day in the yeere. But here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rome.</NOTE> in the myd wynter, the sunne at noonetyde is beneficiall, and bryngeth foorth floures, Roses, and Ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>floures. I haue geathered some in winter in the moneth of December, not procured at home by hu∣mane arte, but growyng in open Gardens in maner in euery bed vnder the bare heauen, brought foorth only by the sunne. But this benignitie of the sunne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colde nyghtes in hot regions.</NOTE> continueth not past fyue houres in the naturall day, forasmuch as the operation thereof is extinct by the coldenesse of the nyght folowyng. But if this benefite myght be receyued without hinderaunce of the nyght, as it is vnder the poles, and so continue many monethes in hot regions vnto wyn∣ter, it should surely bring foorth many wonderful thinges, if moy∣sture fayled not. And by this condition thus propounded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Romane wynter.</NOTE> we may well conceyue that the Romane wynter, although it be not hotte, yet to be equall in heate to the full spryng tyme in the same citie, during the tyme of the sayd fyue houres. And thus by a similitude of the height of the sunne vnder both places, and of the knowen qualitie of the Romane heauen, and by the accesse of the sunne to such places where the longest day continueth certayne moneths, we may geather that sommer, in places vnder the pole, is lyke vnto and equall with the full Romane spryng.</P>
<P>But the more difficult question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our night of vi. monethes.</NOTE> is of the tyme of the .vi. monethes in the whiche the Sunne leaueth those regions,
<PB REF="287"/>
and goeth by the contrary or ouerthwarte circle toward the south in wynter. For they say that at that tyme, those regions are deformed with horrible darkenesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiections.</NOTE> and nyghtes not increased, whiche may be the cause that beastes can not seeke theyr foode: And that also the colde should then bee intollerable. By which double euyls all thynges constrayned should dye, so that no beast were able to abyde the iniuryes of wynter and famyne insuyng thereof: but that all beastes should peryshe before the sommer folowyng, when they should bryng foorth theyr broode or succes∣sion: and that for these causes, the sayde colde clyme should bee perpetually desolate and vnhabitable. To all which obiections, we answere in this maner.</P>
<P>As touchyng the nyghtes not increased, I say, that it was not conuenient to assume that for any reason. For not as the Sunne falleth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The twy∣lightes.</NOTE> so sodeynly commeth the darke nyght: but that the euenyng doeth substitute and prolong the day long after, as also the day spryng or dawnyng of the day, gyueth a certayne lyght before the rysing of the Sunne: After the which, the re∣sidue of the nyght that receyueth no lyght by the sayde euenyng and mornyng twilightes, is accomplyshed by the lyght of the Moone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lyght of the Moone.</NOTE> so that the nyghtes are sildome vnaugmented. Let this bee an example prooued by our temperate regions, whereby we may vnderstande the condition of the nyght vnder the pole: Therefore euen there also the twilightes helpe the nyght a long tyme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nyght vnder the pole.</NOTE> as we will more presently demonstrate. It is approoued by the Astronomers, that the Sunne descendyng from the high∣est halfe sphere by eightiene paralels of the vnder horizon, ma∣keth an ende of the twilight, so that at the length the darke night succeedeth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A demonstra∣tion.</NOTE> And that the Sunne approchyng, and rysing a∣boue the hyghest halfe sphere by as many paralels, doeth dy∣minyshe the nyght and increase the twylyght. Agayne, by the position or placyng of the sphere vnder the pole, the same is the horizontall that is the Equinoctiall. Those paralelles therefore that are paralelles to the horizontall lyne, are also pa∣ralelles to the Equinoctiall. So that the Sunne descendyng there vnder the horizon, doeth not bryng darke nyghtes to those regions, vntyll it come to the paralels distant .xviii. partes from the Equinoctiall.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="287"/>Duryng the tyme of these sayde syxe monethes of darke∣nesse vnder the pole, the nyght is destitute of the benefite of the Sunne and the sayde twylyghtes, onely for the space of three monethes, in the whiche the Sunne goeth and returneth by the portion of the ouerthwarte circle. But yet neyther this tyme of three monethes is without remedy from heauen. For the Moone with her full globe increased in lyght, hath accesse at that tyme, and illuminateth the monethes lackyng lyght, euery one by them selues, halfe the course of the moneth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moone.</NOTE> by whose benefite it commeth to passe that the nyght, named as vnaugmented, possesseth those regions no longer then one mo∣neth and a halfe, neyther that continually or all at one tyme: but this also diuided into three sortes of shorter nyghtes, of the whiche euery one endureth for the space of two weekes, and are illuminate of the Moone accordyngly. And this is the rea∣son conceyued of the power of the sphere, whereby we testifie that the sommers and nyghtes vnder the pole are tollerable to ly∣uyng beastes. But we wyll nowe declare by other remedies of nature and arte, that this colde so greatly feared, is more remisse and tollerable then our opinion: so that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remedies of nature &amp; art.</NOTE> compared to the nature of suche beastes as lyue there, it may be abydden.

But suche as folowed these, beyng con∣tented with thinuentions of the olde autours, and borne in ma∣ner vnder the same qualitie of heauen, persysted wyllyngly in the same opinion, with more confidence then consideration of the thynges whereof we nowe intreate: so lyghtly was that opinion receyued as touchyng the vnhabitable clime vnder the poles. But we with better confidence and faith (forasmuche as we are not instructed with coniectures) intend to stande against the sentence of the olde autours, affirmyng the North regions within the colde clime to be inhabited with herrynges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fyshes of the North seas.</NOTE> coddes, haddockes, and brettes, tunnyes, and other great fyshes, with thinfinite number whereof, tables are furnyshed through a great parte of Europe: All whiche are taken in the North sea exten∣ded beyonde our knoweledge.

<HEAD>Of the difference of regions, and causes of great cities, after the description of Hieronimus Cardanus. Liber .xi. <HI>De Subtilitate.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere is an other difference of regions caused of cold and heate. For suche as are neare vnto the poles, are vexed with to muche colde: and suche as are vnder the line where the Sunne is of greatest force, are oppressed with heate. Suche as are in the middest betweene both, are nearest vnto temperatenesse. Under the pole, it is impossible
<PB N="289" REF="299"/>
that there should be populous cities, bycause the lande is barren, and the caryage or conueyaunce of fruites, victualles, and other necessaryes, is incommodious. By reason whereof, it is necessa∣rie that the inhabitauntes of such regions lyue euer in continuall wanderyng from place to place, or els in small vyllages. Suche as inhabite temperate regions, haue meane cities, aswell for that they haue more commodious conueyaunce for necessaryes, as also that they may dwel better and more safely togeather then in vyllages, by reason of fortifying their townes with walles, and exercising of artes and occupations, wherby the one may the bet∣ter helpe the other. Yet that olde Rome (beyng in a temperate region) was of such incredible bygnesse, the cause was, that it ob∣teyned the Empyre of the worlde, by reason whereof, all nations had confluence thyther, and not the greatnesse of the walles. But it is necessarie that the greatest cities be in hotte regions: fyrst, for that in such regions, part of the soile is either barren if it lacke water, or els most fruitfull if it abounde with water. And for this inequalitie, when they fynde any place meete to susteyne a mul∣titude, it foloweth of necessitie that great cities be builded in such places, by reason of great concourse of people resortyng to the same. An other great cause is, that whereas in such regions, mar∣chauntes come very farre to such commodious places, they passe through many desarte and perillous regions: So that it shalbe necessary for theyr better securitie, to come in great companyes, as it were great armies. And therefore whereas such a societie is once knyt togeather in a commodious place, it should bee great hynderance aswell to the inhabitants as to marchauntes, if they should wander in incommodious places. And by this confluence, both of such as dwell neare to such places, and also of strangers and such as dwell farre of, it is necessary that in continuaunce of tyme, small townes become great cities, as are these: <HI>Quinsai, Singui, Cambalu, Memphis, Cairus,</HI> or <HI>Alcair,</HI> otherwyse called Ba∣bilon in Egypt. But if here any will obiecte Constantinople (in olde tyme called <HI>Bizantium</HI>) beyng in a temperate region, al∣though it be not to be compared to such cities as are more then lx. myles in circuite, yet doe we answere herevnto, that the Tur∣kes Empyre is the cause of the greatnesse hereof, as we sayde before of Rome.</P>

For in howe much the longer voyage they haue attempted for this intent, so much the more do they thereby de∣clare that this desyre hath ben ardent in them. Furthermore also, thexemples of our fathers and predicessours do inuite vs herevn∣to, forasmuch as they haue euer gentelly and louyngly intreated such as of frendely mynde came to them, aswell from countreys neere hand, as far remote, commending them selues to their pro∣tection. And if it be ryght and equitie to shewe such humanitie towarde all men, doubtlesse the same ought chiefely to be shewed to merchauntes, who wanderyng about the worlde, search both the lande and the sea, to cary suche good and profitable thynges as are founde in theyr countreys, to remote regions and kyng∣domes,

For god of heauen and earth, greatly prouy∣dyng for mankynd, would not that al thinges should bee founde in one region, to thende that one should haue neede of an other, that by this meanes frendshyp myght be establyshed among all men, and euery one seeke to gratifie all. For the establyshing and furtheraunce of whiche vniuersall amitie, certayne men of our realme, moued hereunto by the sayde desire, haue instituted and taken vpon them a viage by sea into farre countreys, to the intent that betweene our people and them, a way be opened to bryng in, and carry out merchandizes, desiryng vs to further theyr enterpryse. Who assentyng to theyr petition, haue licen∣ced the ryght valiaunt and worthy sir Hugh Wylloby Knyght, and other our trusty and faythful seruantes which are with him, accordyng to theyr desire, to go to countreys to them heretofore vnknowen, aswell to seeke suche thynges as we lacke, as also to carry vnto them from our regions, suche thynges as they lacke. So that hereby not only commoditie may ensue both to them and to vs, but also an indissoluble and perpetuall league of frendshyp be establyshed betweene vs both, whyle they permit vs to take of theyr thyngs, such whereof they haue aboundaunce in theyr regions, and we agayne graunt them suche thynges of ours whereof they are destitute. We therfore desire you Kyngs and Princes, and all other to whom there is any power on the earth, to permit vnto these our seruantes, free passage by your regions and dominions: for they shall not touche any thyng of yours vnwylling vnto you. Consider you that they also are men. If therefore they shall stande in neede of any thyng, we desire you of all humanitie, and for the nobilitie whiche is in you, to ayde and helpe them with suche thynges as they lacke, recey∣uyng agayne of them suche thynges as they shalbe able to geue you in recompence. Shew your selues so towards them, as you would that we and our subiectes should shew our selues towards your seruantes, if at any time they shall passe by our regions.</P>
<P><PB REF="331"/>Thus doyng, we promise you by the God of all thyngs that are conteyned in heauen, earth, and the sea, and by the lyfe and tranquilitie of our kyngdomes, that we wyll with lyke huma∣nitie accept your seruantes if at any tyme they shall come to our kyngdomes, where they shall as frendly and gently be entertay∣ned, as if they were borne in our dominions, that we may hereby recompence the fauour and benignitie which you haue shewed to our men.

Then the fyrst demaund that he asked hym, was from what countrey he came: he answeared, that he came from Eng∣lande. Then asked he of his noble men, who knew any such coun∣trey.

He demaunded also many thynges of the Queenes maiestie, and of the customes and lawes of the realme: saying oftentymes in his owne language, <HI>Bara colla</HI> (that is to saye) wel said.

This talke and muche more was between the <HI>Sophie</HI> and Edwardes for the space of two houres, all whiche thynges lyked hym so well, that shortly after he graunted to the sayde Arthur Edwardes two other priuileges, for the trade of merchandies into <HI>Presia,</HI> all wrytten in Azure and golde let∣ters, and deliuered vnto the lorde keeper of the <HI>Sophie</HI> his great seale. The lorde keeper was named <HI>Coche Califaye,</HI> who sayde that when the <HI>Shaughe</HI> (that is the kyng or prince) dyd sytte to seale any letters, that priuilege shoulde be sealed and deliue∣red to Laurence Chapman.

This article was graunted in respect of a custome among the <HI>Persians,</HI> being Mahumetanes: whose maner is frendly to receyue and wel en∣tertayne, both with giftes &amp; lyuyng, all suche Christians as for∣sakyng theyr religion, wyl become of the religion of the <HI>Persians.</HI> Insomuch that before this priuilege was graunted, there was great occasion of naughtie seruantes to deceyue and robbe theyr maisters: that vnder the coloure of professyng that religion, they might liue among them in such safetie, that you might haue no law agaynst them, eyther to punysh them, or to recouer your goodes at theyr handes, or els where. For before the <HI>Sophie</HI> (whom they say to be a marueylous wyse and gracious prince) seemed to fauour our nation, and to graunt them such priuileges, the people abused them very much, and so hated them that they would not touche them, but reuiled them, callyng them <HI>Cafars</HI> &amp; <HI>Gawars,</HI> which is, infydels, or misbeleeuers. But after they saw how greatly the prince fauoured them, they had them afterward in great reuerence, and would kysse theyr handes, and vse them very frendly. For before, they tooke it for no wrong to rob them, defraud them, beare false witnesse against them, &amp; such merchan∣dies as they had bought or sold, make them take it againe, and

chaunge it as often as them listed. And yf any straunger by chaunce had kylled one of them, they woulde haue the lyfe of two for one slayne, and for the debtes of any straunger, woulde take the goodes of any other of the same nation, with many o∣ther such lyke abuses, in maner vnknowen to the Prince, before the complayntes of our men made vnto hym for reformation of such abuses: which were the cause that no merchant strangers of contrary religion, durst come into his dominions with theyr commodities: which myght be greatly to the profite of hym and his subiectes.</P>

was that young man being lefte behynde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ilandes of Madera.</NOTE> then if he had been ta∣ken with them, as some doe wishe he had done the lyke by theyrs. Thus sayled they on their vyage, vntyl they came to the Ilandes of <HI>Madera,</HI> where they tooke in certayne wynes for the store of their shippes, and payde for them as they agreed of the price. At these Ilandes they met with a great Galion of the kyng of Por∣tugale, ful of men and ordinance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A galeon of the kyng of Por∣tugale.</NOTE> yet such as could not haue pre∣uayled if it had attempted to withstande or resist our shippes, for the which cause it was set foorth, not only to let and interrupte these our shippes of their purposed viage, but all other that should attempte the lyke: yet chiefly to frustrate our vyage. For the Kyng of Portugale was sinisterly informed that our shyppes were armed to his castell of <HI>Mina</HI> in these parties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castell of Mina.</NOTE> whereas no∣thyng lesse was ment.</P>
<P>After that our shyppes departed from the Ilandes of <HI>Ma∣dera</HI> forwarde on theyr vyage, began this woorthie Captayne <HI>Pinteados</HI> sorowe, as a man tormented with the company of a terrible Hydra, who hytherto flattered with him, and made him a fayre countenaunce and shewe of loue.

<P>Hetherto continueth the course of the vyage, as it was descri∣bed by the sayd Pylot. Now therfore I wil speake somewhat of the countrey and people, and of such thinges as are brought from thence.</P>
<P>They brought from thence at the last vyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Golde foure hundred weight. Graynes.</NOTE> foure hundred pound weight and odde of gold, of .xxii. Carrattes and one graine in finenesse: also .xxxvi. buttes of graynes, and about two hun∣dred and fyftie Elephantes teeth of all quantities. Of these, I sawe and measured some of .ix. spannes in length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eleuantes teeth.</NOTE> as they were crooked. Some of them were as bygge as a mans thygh aboue the knee, and weyed about foure score and tenne pounde weight a peece. They say that some one hath been seene of a hundred and .xxv. pounde weyght. Other there were which they call the teeth of calues, of one or two or three yeeres, whereof some were a foote and a halfe, some two foote, and some three, or more, ac∣cordyng to the age of the beast. These great teeth or tuskes, growe in the vpper iawe downewarde, and not in the nether iawe vpwarde, wherin the paynters and arras woorkers are de∣ceyued. At this laste vyage was brought from <HI>Guinea</HI> the head of an Elephante, of suche huge bygnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The head of an Elephant.</NOTE> that only the bones or crauewe thereof, besyde the nether iawe and great tuskes, weyghed about two hundred weyght, and was as muche as I coulde well lyfte from the grounde: insomuche that con∣sideryng also heerewith the weyght of two suche great teethe, the nether iawes with the lesse teeth, the tongue, the great han∣gyng eares, the bygge and long snoute or troonke, with all the fleshe, braynes, and skynne, with all other partes belongyng to the whole head, in my iudgement it could wey little lesse then

fyue hundred weight. This head dyuers haue seene in the house of the woorthie merchant syr Andrewe Iudde, where also I saw it, and beheld it, not onely with my bodyly eyes, but much more with the eyes of my mynde and spirite, considered by the woorke, the cunnyng and wysedome of the workemaister:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The contem∣plations of Gods workes.</NOTE> without which consideration, the sight of suche straunge and wonderfull thinges may rather seeme curiosities, then profitable contemplations.</P>
<P>The Elephante (whiche some call an Oliphante) is the big∣gest of all foure footed beastes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The description and properties of the Elephant</NOTE> his forelegges are longer then his hynder, he hath ankles in the lower parte of his hynder leg∣ges, and fyue toes on his feete vndiuided, his snoute or troonke is so long, and in suche fourme, that it is to him in the steede of a hande: for hee neyther eateth nor drynketh but by bryngyng his troonke to his mouth, therewith hee helpeth vp his maister or keeper, therwith he ouerthroweth trees. Besyde his two great tuskes, he hath on euery syde of his mouth foure teethe, where∣with he eateth and gryndeth his meate: eyther of these teeth, are almost a spanne in length, as they growe along in the iawe, and are about two inches in heyght, and almost as much in thick∣nesse. The tuskes of the Male are greater then of the Fe∣male: his tongue is very litle, and so farre in his mouth, that it can not be seene: of all beastes they are most gentle and tracta∣ble, for by many sundry wayes they are taught, and doe vn∣derstande: insomuche that they learne to doe due honour to a Kyng, and are of quicke sense and sharpenesse of wyt. When the Male hath once seasoned the Female, he neuer after tou∣cheth her. The Male Elephante lyueth two hundred yeeres, or at the least one hundred and twentie: the Female almost as long, but the floure of theyr age, is but .lx. yeeres, as some wryte. They can not suffer wynter or colde: they loue ryuers, and wil often goe into them vp to the snoute, wherewith they blow and snuffe, and playe in the water: but swymme they can not for the weyght of theyr bodyes. <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Solinie</HI> wryte, that they vse none adulterie.

with the vse of the same in medicine, who so desireth to know, let him reade Plinie, in the .viii. booke of his natural hystorie. He al∣so writeth in his xii. booke, that in olde tyme they made many goodly woorkes of Iuery or Elephants teeth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Woorkes of Iuery.</NOTE> as tables, tressels, postes of houses, rayles, lattesses for wyndowes, Images of their goddes, and dyuers other thinges of Iuery, both coloured and vncoloured, &amp; intermyxt with sundry kyndes of precious woods, as at this day are made certayne Chayres, Lutes, and Uirgi∣nalles. They had suche plentie thereof in olde tyme, that (as far as I remember) Iosephus wryteth, that one of the gates of Hierusalem was called <HI>Porta Eburnea,</HI> (that is) the Iuery gate. The whytenesse thereof was so muche esteemed, that it was thought to represent the naturall fayrenesse of mans skynne: in∣somuche that such as went about to set foorth (or rather corrupt) naturall beautie with colours and payntyng, were reprooued by this prouerbe, <HI>Ebur atramento candefacere,</HI> that is, to make Iuery whyte with ynke. The Poettes also, describyng the fayre neckes of beautifull virgins, call them <HI>Eburnea colla,</HI> that is, I∣uery neckes. And to haue sayde thus muche of Elephantes and Iuery, it may suffice.</P>
<P>Now therfore I wil speake somewhat of the people and theyr maners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The people of Africa.</NOTE> and maner of lyuyng, with also an other briefe descrip∣tion of Africa. It is to vnderstande, that the people which nowe inhabite the regions of the coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the myd partes of Africa, as <HI>Libia</HI> the inner, and <HI>Nubia,</HI> with diuers other great and large regions about the same, were in olde tyme called <HI>Ethiopes</HI> and <HI>Nigrite,</HI> which we now call Moores, Moorens, or <HI>Negros,</HI> a people of beastly lyuyng, without a God, lawe, religion, or com∣mon wealth, and so scorched and vexed with the heate of the sun, that in many places they curse it when it ryseth. Of the regions and people about the inner <HI>Libia</HI> (called <HI>Libia Interior) Gemma Phrysius</HI> writeth thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Libia Interior.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Libia Interior,</HI> is very large and desolate, in the whiche are many horrible Wyldernesses and mountaynes, replenished with dyuers kyndes of wylde and monstrous beastes and Ser∣pentes. Fyrst from <HI>Mauritania</HI> or Barbarie towarde the South is <HI>Getulia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Getulia.</NOTE> a rough and saluage region, whose inhabitauntes are wylde and wanderyng people. After these folowe the

people called <HI>Melanogetuli</HI> and <HI>Pharusii,</HI> whiche wander in the wyldernesse, carying with them great gourdes of water. The Ethiophians, called <HI>Nigrite,</HI> occupie a great part of <HI>Aphrica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ethiopes. Nigrite.</NOTE> and are extended to the West Ocean. Southwarde also they reach to the ryuer <HI>Nigritis,</HI> whose nature agreeth with the ryuer of <HI>Nilus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ryuer Ni∣gritis or Se∣nega.</NOTE> forasmuch as it is increased and diminished at the same tyme, and bryngeth foorth the lyke beastes as the Crocodile. By reason whereof, I thynke this to be the same ryuer whiche the Portugales call <HI>Senega</HI>: For this ryuer is also of the same nature. It is furthermore marueylous and very strange that is sayde of this ryuer: And this is, that on the one syde thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strāge thyng</NOTE> thinhabitauntes are of hyghe stature and blacke, and on the o∣ther syde, of browne or tawnie coloure, and lowe stature, whiche thyng also our men confyrme to be true.

<P>Some wryte that <HI>Affrica</HI> was so named by the <HI>Grecians,</HI> be∣cause it is without colde.

<P>Some of our men of good credit that were in this last viage to <HI>Guinea,</HI> affirme ernestly that in the night season they felt a sen∣sible heate to come from the beames of the Moone.

<P>And that the Moone geueth heate vppon the earth, the Pro∣phet Dauid seemeth to confirme in his .Cxxi. Psalme, where speakyng of such men as are defended from euils by goddes pro∣tection, he sayeth thus: <HI>Per diem Sol non exuret te, nec Luna per noctem.</HI> That is to say, In the day the Sunne shall not burne thee, nor the Moone by nyght.</P>
<P>They say furthermore that in certayne places of the sea, they saw certayne streames of water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spoutes of water falling out of the aire.</NOTE> which they call spoutes, fallyng out of the ayre into the sea, and that some of these are as byg as the great pyllers of Churches: Insomuch that sometymes they fall into shyps, and put them in great daunger of drownyng. Some phantasye that these should be the Caractes of Heauen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carractes of heauen.</NOTE> whiche were all opened at Noes fludde. But I thynke them rather to be such fluxions and eruptions as <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his booke <HI>de Mundo</HI> saith, to chaunce in the sea. For speakyng of suche strange thynges as are seene often tymes in the sea, he wryteth thus.

Then sayde hee, Praysed be Mahumet who sent thee hyther, to do him and his Saintes good seruice: and willed me to remayne secretly in his house with his wyfe, and requyred me earnestly to obtayne leaue of our Cap∣tayne, that vnder his name he myght leade from <HI>Mecha</HI> fiftiene Camelles laden with spices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paying of cu∣stome to the Soltan.</NOTE> without paying any custome: for they ordinarily paye to the Soltan thirtie Saraphes of golde, for transportyng of such merchandies for the charge of so many Camelles.

Then no∣thyng doubtyng to obtayne his request, he greatly reioyced, and talkyng with me yet more freely, gaue me further instructions, and counsayled me to repayre to a certayne Kyng of the greater <HI>India,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The realme of Decham in India.</NOTE> in the kyngdome and realme of <HI>Decham,</HI> whereof we will speake hereafter.

But God fayled not to assyst me. For the maister of the prison, perceyuing the out∣rage of the Mahumetans, and fearyng that they would offer me violence, made fast the gates of the prison. After that fyue and fiftie dayes were paste, the Soltan commaunded that I should be brought before him: and so, set vppon a Camel with my shackles, I came in eight dayes iourney to the place where the Soltan laye, and was brought to his presence in a citie na∣med <HI>Rhada</HI>: for there the Soltan had assembled an army of thirtie thousande men, to make warre agaynst the Soltan of the citie of <HI>Sana,</HI> whiche is three dayes iourney from <HI>Rhada,</HI> and situate partly on the declining of a hyll, and partly in a playne, very fayre to be seene, well peopled, and hauyng plentie of all thinges.

But the fyrst three dayes in which I began to shew my madnesse, weryed me so muche, that I was neuer so tyred with laboure or greeued with payne, for the boyes and rascall people sometyme to the number of .xl. or .l. hurled stones at me almost without ceassing, while in the meane time againe I paid some of them home with lyke wages. The boyes cryed euer after me, callyng me mad man. And to shewe it the more, I caryed alwayes stones with me in my shyrt, for other apparel had I none. The queene hearyng of my follies, looked often∣tymes out of the wyndowes to see me, more for a secrete loue she bore me, then for the pleasure she tooke in my follyes, as af∣terwarde appeared.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="384"/>Therefore on a tyme, when some of them, muche madder then I, played the knaues with me in the syght of the queene (whose secrete fauour towardes me I somewhat perceyued) that my maddenesse myght seeme more manifest, I cast of my shyrt, and went to the place before the wyndowes, where the queene myght see me all naked: wherein I perceyued she tooke great pleasure.

<P><PB REF="385"/>And because I coulde not folowe hym by reason of my shackles, I returned to the pryson, and stopped the doore with a heape of stones, and there lyued in great payne for the space of two daies without meate or drynke: And therefore the queene and other thought me to be dead, but the doore was opened by the queenes commaundement. Then these dogges derydyng me, gaue me stones in the steede of bread, and peeces of whyte marble, saying that it was suger: other gaue me clusters of Grapes full of sand.

Whyle they were yet debatyng this matter, for the space of an houre, I pyssed in my handes, and hurlde it in theyr faces: whereby they agreed that I was no Sainct, but a mad man. The queene seyng all this at the wyndowe, laughed well thereat among her maydens, and sayd thus to them, By the goodnesse of God, and by the head of <HI>Mahumet,</HI> this is a good man.

But many haue thought that the Elephantes haue no ioyntes in theyr legges, and that therefore they could not bende theyr legges: which thyng doubt∣lesse is false,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elephants haue ioyntes in their legges.</NOTE> for they haue ioyntes as haue other beastes, but in the lowest parte of theyr legges. The Females are more fierce then the Males, and much stronger to beare burdens. Sometime they are taken with furie or madnesse, and testifie the same by dis∣ordinate runnyng here and there. One Elephant exceedeth the bygnesse of three Bufles, &amp; not vnlyke of heare. They haue eyes lyke swyne, &amp; the snout or trunke very long, wherwith they put meate and drinke into their mouth: and therefore may it well be called the hande of the Elephant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hande of the Elephant.</NOTE> The mouth is vnder the throte, much lyke the mouth of a Sowe, and the trunke is holowe, and can therwith holde fast stickes or slaues, and them rule as it were with a hande. I sawe also the trunke of a tree ouerthrowen by an Elephant, which xxiiii. men attempting, could not doe. The two great teeth or tuskes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The teeth of the Elephant is Iuery.</NOTE> are placed in the highest iawe. Ech of their eares, are two handfuls byg, whether the beast be of the bygger or lesse kinde. The feete are like vnto such round thicke trenchers of wood as he commonly vsed.

They goe slowly, and walowing, and therfore some that haue not ben vsed to them, are moued to vomite euen as it were on the sea. Yet is it a plea∣sure to ryde on the young Elephantes, bicause they goe softly like ambeling Mules. When you mount on them, they stoope &amp; bend their knees, that you may easily ascende.

And therefore for the space of seuen dayes, beyng here daungerously tossed to and fro by the rages of the sea and wynde, at the length we escaped, by the grace of God. But proceedyng about two hundred leagues, a newe tempest rysyng so scattred our shyppes in the space of syxe dayes, that we mette not togeather agayne vntyll we arryued at Luxburne in Portugale. I was in the shyppe of Barthelmewe, a Florentine, citizen of Lux∣burne. The shyppe was named Saint Uincent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An exceedyng great shyppe and great rych∣es of spyces.</NOTE> a vessell of ex∣ceedyng capacitie, &amp; laden with seuen thousande tonnes of all sortes of spyces. In the way, we passed also by an other Iland, named the Iland of saint Helen, where we sawe certayne fyshes of suche enorme and monstrous byggenesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Whale fyshes.</NOTE> that one of them was as bygge as a great house.

And before I speake any further of the viage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The natural cause of suche fyres as fall in the shyppes.</NOTE> I haue heere thought good to say some∣what of these strange fyers, whiche some ignorant folke thynke to be spirites, or suche other phantasies, wheras they are but na∣turall thynges, proceedyng of naturall causes, and engendred of certayne exhalations. Of these therfore, the great Philosopher of our tyme <HI>Hieronimus Cardanus,</HI> in his second booke <HI>De Subtili∣tate,</HI> wryteth in this maner.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cardanus.</HI></NOTE> There are two maner of fyers en∣gendred of exhalations, wherof the one is hurtful, the other with∣out hurt.

They are a token of securitie, bycause they are litle, not slowe or grosse, whereby they myght haue ioyned altogeather in one, and been thereby more malicious, and lasted longer, whereas beyng many and but little, they are the sooner consumed.

<P>When they had sayled paste the Equinoctiall lyne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>They lost the sight of the North starre. The Ilande of Brasile.</P>
<P>The South pole.</P></NOTE> they loste the sight of the North starre, and sayled by the southwest, vntyll they came to a lande named the lande of <HI>Bressil,</HI> whiche some call <HI>Brasilia,</HI> beyng .xxii. degrees and a halfe towarde the south pole or pole Antartike. This lande is continuate and one firme lande with the cape of saint Augustine, whiche is .viii. degrees from the Equinoctiall. In this lande they were refreshed with many good fruites of innumerable kyndes, and founde here also very good suger canes, and diuers kindes of beasts and other thinges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suger.</NOTE> which I omit for breuitie. They entered into this hauen on saint Lucies day: where the Sunne being theyr <HI>Zenith</HI> (that is, the poynte of heauen directly ouer theyr heades) they felte greater heate that day, then when they were vnder the Equinoctial lyne. This lande of <HI>Brasile</HI> is very large and great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The greatnesse of the lande of Brasile.</NOTE> and bygger then all Spayne, Portugale, Fraunce, and Italie, and is most abun∣daunt in all thinges.

Both the men and women goe naked, and dwell in certayne long houses. They are very docible, and soone allured to the Christian fayth.</P>
<P>Thirtiene dayes after that they arryued at the sayde porte, they departed from this lande, and sayled to the xxxiiii. degree and a halfe towarde the pole <HI>Antartike,</HI> where they founde a great ryuer of freshe water, and certayne Caniballes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caniballes.</NOTE> Of these
<PB REF="444"/>
they sawe one out of theyr shyppes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Giantes.</NOTE> of stature as byg as a Giant, hauing a voice like a Bull. Our men pursued them, but they were so swyfte of foote that they coulde not ouertake them. About the mouth of this riuer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Insulae gem∣marum. Cap. S. Marie.</HI></NOTE> are seuen Ilandes, in the byggest whereof they founde certayne precious stones, and called it the cape of sainct Marie. The Spanyardes thought that by this ryuer they myght haue passed into the South sea, but they were deceyued in theyr opinion: For there was none other passage then by the riuer, which is .xvii. leagues large in the mouth. Thus folowing this coaste by the tracte of the lande towarde the pole <HI>Antartike,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The pole An∣tartike. Geese.</P>
<P>Sea woolues.</P></NOTE> they came to a place where were two Ilandes replenished with Geese and Wolues of the sea, which some thinke to be those fy∣shes that we call Pikes. These were in such number, that in an houre all the fyue shyppes might haue ben laden with Geese, be∣ing all of blacke colour, and such as can not flee. They liue of fish, and are so fatte, that they could scarsely flay them. They haue no feathers, but a certayne downe, and theyr bylles lyke Rauens bylles. These Woolues of the sea are of dyuers colours, and of the bygnesse of Calues, with theyr heades of golden colour. Here were they in great danger by tempest: But as soone as the three fyres, called sainct Helen, sainct Nycolas, and saint Clare, ap∣peared vppon the cables of the shyppes, sodaynely the tempeste and furie of the wyndes ceassed. Departyng from hence, they sayled to the .49. degree and a halfe vnder the pole <HI>Antartike:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The .xlix. de∣gree of the South pole.</NOTE> where beyng wyntered, they were inforced to remayne there for the space of two monethes, all which tyme they sawe no man, excepte that one day by chaunce they espyed a man of the stature of a Giant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Giantes.</NOTE> who came to the hauen daunsing and singyng, and shortly after seemed to cast dust ouer his head. The Captayne sent one of his men to the shore with the shyppe Boate, who made the lyke signe of peace. The which thyng the Giant see∣yng, was out of feare, and came with the Captaynes seruaunt to his presence into a little Ilande. When he sawe the Cap∣tayne with certayne of his company about him, he was great∣ly amased, and made signes, holdyng vp his hande to heauen, signifying thereby that our men came from thence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bygnesse of the Giantes.</NOTE> This Gi∣ant was so byg, that the head of one of our men of a meane sta∣ture, came but to his waste.

made in all partes of his bodie, with a large visage painted with diuers colours, but for the most parte yelow Uppon his cheekes were paynted two Hartes, and red circles about his eyes. The heare of his head was coloured whyte, and his apparell was the skynne of a beast sowde togeather. This beast as (seemed vnto vs) had a large head, and great eares lyke vnto a Mule, with the body of a Camell, and tayle of a horse. The feete of the Giant were foulded in the sayde skynne, after the maner of shooes. He had in his hande a bygge and shorte bowe, the stryng whereof was made of a sinewe of that beaste. He had also a bundell of long arrows made of Reedes, feathered after the maner of ours, typte with sharpe stones in the steade of Iron heades. The Cap∣tayne caused him to eate and drynke, &amp; gaue him many thinges, and among other a great lookyng glasse: In the which as soone as he sawe his owne lykenesse, was sodaynly afrayde, and started backe with suche violence, that hee ouerthrewe two that stoode nearest about him. When the Captayne had thus gyuen him certayne Haukes belles, and other great belles, with also a loo∣kyng glasse, a combe, and a payre of beades of glasse, he sent him to lande with foure of his owne men well armed. Shortly after, they sawe an other Giant of somewhat greater stature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An other Giant.</NOTE> with his bowe and arrowes in his hande. As hee drewe neare vnto our men, he layde his hande on his head, and poynted vp towarde heauen, and our men dyd the lyke. The Captayne sent his shyppe Boate to bryng him to a litle Ilande beyng in the Hauen. This Giant was very tractable and pleasaunte. He soong and daunsed, and in his daunsing lefte the print of his feete on the grounde. He remayned long with our men, who named him <HI>Iohan.</HI> He coulde well speake and playnely pro∣nounce these woordes, <HI>Iesus, Aue Maria, Iohannes,</HI> euen as we doe, but with a bygger voyce. The Captayne gaue him a shert of linnen cloth, &amp; a coate of white woollen cloth: also a cappe, a combe, a looking glasse, with diuers such other thinges, and so sent him to his company. The day folowing, he resorted agayne to the shyppes, and brought with him one of those great beastes, which he gaue the Captayne. But after that day, they neuer saw him more, supposing him to be slayne of his owne company, for the conuersation he had with our men.</P>
<P><PB REF="445"/>After other .xv. dayes were past, there came foure other Giantes without any weapons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure other Giantes.</NOTE> but had hyd theyr bowes and arrowes in certaine bushes. The Captaine retayned two of these, which were youngest and beste made. He tooke them by a deceite, in this ma∣ner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Giantes are taken by a pollicie.</NOTE> that giuing them knyues, sheares, looking glasses, belles, beades of Crystall, &amp; suche other trifles, he so filled theyr handes that they coulde holde no more: then caused two payre of shac∣kels of Iron to be put on theyr legges, makyng signes that he would also giue them those chaynes: which they lyked very wel, bycause they were made of bright and shining metall And wher∣as they could not carry them bycause theyr handes were full, the other Giantes would haue caryed them: but the captaine would not suffer them. When they felte the shackels faste about theyr legges, they began to doubt: but the Captayne dyd put them in comfort, and bad them stande still. In fine, when they sawe howe they were deceiued, they roared lyke bulles, &amp; cryed vppon theyr great deuill <HI>Setebos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The deuyll Setebos.</NOTE> to helpe them. Being thus taken, they were immediately seperate and put in sundry shippes. They could ne∣uer bynde the handes of the other two, yet was one of them with much difficultie ouerthrowen by .ix. of our men, &amp; his hands boūd: but he sodeinly loosed him selfe and fled, as did also the other that came with them. In their fleeing, they shot of their arrowes and slue one of our men. They say that when any of them dye, there appeare x. or .xii deuils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deuyls ap∣peare to the Gi∣antes when they dye.</NOTE> leaping and daunsing about the bodie of the dead, and seeme to haue their bodies paynted with diuers co∣lours, and that among other, there is one seene bigger then the residue, who maketh great mirth &amp; reioysing. This great deuyll they call <HI>Setebos,</HI> and call the lesse <HI>Cheleule.</HI> One of these Giantes which they tooke, declared by signes that he had seene deuylles with two hornes aboue their heades, with long heare downe to theyr feete: and that they caste foorth fyre at theyr throates both before and behynde.

Theyr freshe water was also putrified and become yelowe. They dyd eate skynnes and peeces of leather, whiche were foulded a∣bout certayne great ropes of the shyppes: but these skynnes be∣yng made very harde by reason of the Sunne, rayne, and wynde, they hung them by a corde in the sea, for the space of foure or fiue dayes, to mollifie them, and sodde them, and ate them. By rea∣son of this famyne and vncleane feedyng,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diseases of famyne.</NOTE> some of their gummes grewe so ouer theyr teethe, that they dyed miserably for hunger. And by this occasion dyed menetiene men, and also the Giaunt, with an Indian of the lande of <HI>Brasile,</HI> otherwyse called <HI>Terra de papagalli,</HI> that is, the lande of Popingayes.

During this tyme also, they discouered only two little Ilandes vnhabited, where they sawe nothing but birdes &amp; trees, and therefore named them infortunate Ilandes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnfortunate Ilandes.</NOTE> being one from the other about two hundred leagues distant.

<P>In these dayes they sayled betweene the West and South, so farre that they approched to the Equinoctiall lyne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Equinoc∣tiall line.</NOTE> and were in longitude from the place from whence they first departed, a hundred and twentie degrees.

approch to the Cape called of the olde writers <HI>Cattigara</HI>: the whiche is not founde as the olde Cosmographers haue discribed it, but is towarde the north about .xii. degrees, as they afterward vnderstoode.</P>
<P>When they had thus sayled .lxx. leagues of this voyage in the xii. degree aboue the Equinoctiall, and .C.xlvi. degrees of lon∣gitude (as I haue sayde) the syxt daye of March they discouered a litle Ilande towarde the northwest, and two other towarde the southwest: but the one was hygher and bygger then the other. In the byggest of these, the generall captayne woulde haue rested hym selfe a whyle, but he coulde not, by reason the people of these Ilandes resorted continually to the shyppes with theyr Canoas, and stole nowe one thyng &amp; nowe an other, in suche sorte that our men coulde take no rest: and therefore demaunded of the captaine that they myght stryke theyr sayles to bryng the shyppes to lande. But the captayne beyng prouoked to anger, went aland with fourtie armed men, and burnt about fyftie of theyr houses, with many of theyr Canoas, and slue also about seuen men, and recouered a shyppe boate whiche the Barbarians had stolne, and so departed, folowyng his voyage. The Captayne named these Ilandes <HI>Insulae Latronum,</HI> that is, the Ilandes of theeues.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Insulae Latro∣num.</HI></NOTE> When our men had so wounded some of them with arrowes, that they were stryken through both sydes, they pulled foorth the arrowes, not ceassyng to maruayle at them, tyll they fell downe dead: And yet coulde not the other so depart, but styll folowed y<SUP>e</SUP> ships with more then two hundred of their boates, approching as nere to the shyppes as they coulde, and proferryng our men certayne fishes. As the shyps passed with ful sayle in the middest of theyr boates, they sawe in some of them certayne women, la∣mentyng and tearyng theyr heare, whiche our men thought they dyd for the death of theyr husbandes. As farre as they coulde perceyue, these people lyue at theyr owne lybertie, without any ruler or gouernour. They go naked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">People with long heare.</NOTE> and haue blacke beards and blacke heare on theyr heades, whiche they weare long downe to their wastes.

<P>The tenth daye of Marche, in the yeere .1521. they wente alande vppon a litle Ilande named <HI>Zamal</HI> .xxx. leagues dy∣stant from the Ilande of theeues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ilande of zamall.</NOTE> Because this Ilande was not inhabited, they rested here a while, where the captayne caused a pauilion to be pitched for the sycke &amp; crased men, and a hogge to be kylled.</P>
<P>The .xviii. daye of Marche, they sawe a boate with nyne men commyng towarde them, shewyng them selues ioyfull and reioysyng of theyr commyng. They brought many presentes with them, and seemed to be people of muche humanitie. They gaue the Captayne a great fyshe, and a great vessell of the wyne of those Date trees whiche beare the fruite <HI>Cocus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wyne of Date trees.</NOTE> They made also signes, that within the space of foure dayes, they woulde bryng Ryse, and dyuers foules and beastes, as they dyd in deede. This <HI>Cocus</HI> is a fruit of certayne Date trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maruilous fruite Cocus.</NOTE> whereof they make bread, wyne, oyle, and vineger. They make wyne in this ma∣ner. They cutte a bygge branche of the tree, and hange thereat a reede as bygge as a mans legge, into the whiche droppeth a sweete licoure from the tree, like vnto whyte wyne, somwhat tart, and let the reede continue there from mornyng tyl euenyng, and from euenyng to mornyng. The fruite of this tree called <HI>Cocus,</HI> is as bygge as the head of a man, or more. The fyrst rynde of this, is greene, and of the thyckenesse of two fyngers, hauyng in it certayne threedes whereof they make cordes, with the whiche they tye theyr boates. Under this rynde, there is a thycke shell, which they burne and make pouder therof, and vse it as a remedy for certayne diseases. Under this shell, is a white substance lyke the carnel of a Nut, being a fynger in thycknesse, which they eate with fleshe and fyshe, as we do bread. It hath the taste of an Almonde, and is vsed in the steade of bread, when it is dryed.
<PB N="438" REF="448"/>
In the myddest of this carnell, is a cleare and sweete water, beyng very holsome and cordiale. This water sometyme con∣iealeth and lyeth within the shell lyke an egge. When they in∣tende to make oyle hereof, the laye it to putrifie in water, and boyle it vntyll it be lyke oyle or liquide butter. When they in∣tende to make vineger, they suffer onely the water to putrifie, and then set it to the Sunne, where it becommeth vineger, lyke vnto that which is made of whyte wyne. And when they mingle the carnell with the water whiche is in the myddest of the fruite, and strayne it through a cloth, they make a mylke thereof, lyke vnto Goates mylke. These Date trees are lyke vnto them that beare Dates, but are not so full of knottes. With the iuice of two of these Date trees, a whole familie of tenne persons may be mentayned with wyne, vsyng one .viii. dayes, and the other, other .viii. dayes: for they shoulde els be dryed and wythered. These trees continue for the space of a hundred yeeres. This Ilande where they founde this humane and gentle people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Iland of zuluan.</NOTE> is called <HI>Zuluan,</HI> and is not very bygge.

After that the Captayne had shewed the Kyng the secretes of his shyp, and suche merchaundies as he had therein, he caused a peece of ordinaunce sodenly to be shotte of, whereat the kyng was greatly amased, vntyl the Captayne comforted hym. Then the Captayne commaunded one of his men to be armed from the head to the foote, and caused three other to stryke hym with theyr swoordes, whereat the kyng marueyled greatly, and sayde to thinterpretour (who was a slaue borne in <HI>Malacha</HI>) that one of those armed men was able to encounter with a hundred of his men. But he marueyled much more, when the Captayne tolde hym by thinterpretoure, howe he founde the strayght by the com∣passe and lode stone, and howe many dayes they were without syght of any lande.

<P><PB N="439" REF="449"/>The last day of Marche, neare vnto Easter, the Captayne cau∣sed his priest to say Masse, and sent to the kyng by the interpre∣tour, that his comming a land at that tyme was not to dyne with hym, but only to heare Masse. The Captayne came aland, with fyftie of his men, in theyr best apparel, without weapons or har∣nesse, and all the residue well armed. Before the boates came to lande, he caused sixe peeces of ordinaunce to be shot of, in token of peace, and so came alande, where the two kynges imbrased hym, and accompanied hym to the place appoynted for Masse to be sayde, not farre from the sea syde. Somewhat before the begynnyng of Masse, the Captayne sprynkled the kynges with Damaske water. When the priest was at myd Masse, at the of∣fertorie, the kinges profered them selues to go to kysse the crosse with the Captayne, but offered nothyng. At the tyme of sacryng, when the priest lyfted vp the body of Christe, and the Christians kneeled downe and helde vp theyr handes ioyned togeather, the kynges dyd the lyke also, with great reuerence. In the meane tyme, whyle certayne of the Christians were at the Communi∣on, a handgunne was shot of, to signifie vnto them that were in the shippes to discharge al theyr ordinaunce. When Masse was finished,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A combatte.</NOTE> the Captayne caused certayne of his men to put on their harnesse, and to make a cumbat with theyr naked swoordes, whereat the kynges tooke great pleasure.

When the kynges hearde these wordes, they gaue the captaine great thankes, promisyng glad∣ly to obserue and fulfyl al such thynges as he required. Then the Captaine demaunded, whether they were Moores or Gentiles: They aunswered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moores and Gentiles.</NOTE> that they had none other kinde of religion, but that lyftyng vp theyr handes ioyned togeather, and theyr faces towarde heauen, they called vpon theyr God <HI>Abba.</HI> Which aun∣swere lyked the Captayne very well, because the Gentiles are sooned perswaded to our fayth then the Moores.</P>

<P>The seuenth day of Apryll, about noone, they entred into the

After this, the Captayne sent an ambassadour with thinterpretoure to the kyng of <HI>Zubut.</HI></P>
<P>When they approched neere to the citie, they found the kyng with a great company of men sore astonyed at the noyse of the gunnes. But thinterpretour aduertised them, that it was the custome of our men, in all suche places where they come, to dis∣charge theyr ordinaunce in token of frendshyppe, and to honour the lord of the citie. With which wordes the kyng and his com∣panye were well quieted. After this, the interpretour declared that his master was the Captayne of the shyppes of the greatest Prince in the worlde, and that they went to discouer the Ilandes of <HI>Molucca</HI>: And further, that hearyng of his good name and fame by the report of the kyng of <HI>Messana,</HI> they determyned to visite him, &amp; to haue vittailes for exchange of their merchaundies. The kyng answered, that he was wel content therewith, and that they were hartyly welcome: Neuerthelesse, that it was a custom in that place, that al such shyps as entered into that hauen, should pay tribute: And that there were not many dayes past, sence a shyp laden with golde and slaues dyd so paye. In token whereof, he caused to come before hym certayne merchauntes of that com∣pany which yet remayned with hym.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A shyppe laden with gold and slaues.</NOTE> To this thinterpretour an∣sweared, that forasmuche as his lorde was the Captayne of so myghtie a Prince, he neuer payde tribute to any kyng in the worlde, and would not nowe begyn: Wyllyng hym to take this for a resolute answeare, that if he woulde accepte the peace that was profered him, he shoulde enioy it, and if he rather desyred warre, he should haue his handes ful. When thinterpretour had sayde these woordes, one of the sayde merchauntes (who was a Moore) spake to the kyng in this maner <HI>Catacaia Chitae</HI>: that is, Take heede syr:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calecut.

Addyng hereunto, that if he woulde not be his frende, he woulde hereafter sende thyther suche a power of armed men as shoulde destroy his countrey. The Moore conferred al these woordes with the king, who sayde that he woulde further deliberate with his counsayle, and geue them a full aunsweare the daye folowyng. In the meane tyme he sent them certayne vyttayles and wyne. When all these thynges were declared to the kyng of <HI>Messana,</HI> who was the chiefest thereabout next vnto him, and lord of many Ilandes, he went a lande and repayred to the kyng of <HI>Zubut,</HI> and declared vnto hym the great humanitie and curtesie of the generall Cap∣tayne.

Wherevppon the Captayne sent certayne of his men thyther, who burnt the towne, and erec∣ted a crosse in that place, bycause the people of the vyllage were Gentyles (that is) Idolaters. But if they had been Moores (that is, <HI>Machumetistes</HI>) they woulde haue erected a pyller of stone, bycause the Moores are more stubberne and harder to be conuerted then are the gentiles.

The Captayne answered, that if he would burne all his Idoles, and beleeue faythfully in Christ, and be baptised, he should bee immediately restored to health, and that he would els giue them leaue to stryke of his head.

This freshet hath ben thought to run into the Northwesterne streicte, rather of ignorance (the course therof being not through∣ly knowen) than that it so falleth out in deede, as. P. Martyr wry∣teth. Finally in the .9. &amp; .10. bookes of the sixt Decade, newes is sent to Rome of the controuersie betwixt the Spaniardes &amp; <HI>Por∣tugales,</HI> concernyng the <HI>Moluccaes,</HI> handled more effectually &amp; in more ample maner, by. <HI>R.

<P>IN the continent or fyrme lande they eate mans fleshe: they be more gyuen to <HI>Sodomye</HI> than any other nation of the world: there is no order of iustice among them, they goe naked, they haue neyther loue nor honestie, they bee fooles and furious,

there is no truth in them, except it be for theyr owne profit: incon∣stant, without all discretion, very vnkynde, &amp; louers of nouelties: they delyght to make them selues dronke with wynes made of di∣uers hearbes, fruites, and graine, as ale and sider, &amp; to ouercome their braynes, as wel otherwise with hearbs, as in making drinke thereof, or eating them▪ They are very bruitishe, and doe make it a prayse to wallowe in vyces. No obedience, no reuerence at all sheweth the young man to the olde, the childe to his father. Ney∣ther teaching nor chastning amendeth them: they be traitors, cru∣ell, so full of reuenge that they neuer forgyue any offence, great enemyes vnto our religion. They be slothfull, theeues, of iudge∣ment very grosse and base, without all honestie and good order. Neither doe the men behaue them selues loyally with theyr wy∣ues, nor the wyues with their husbandes: they be superstitiously giuen to soothsaying, as fearful as Hares, filthes, eating lyse, spi∣ders, &amp; woormes, whersoeuer they finde them: they haue no arte, nor good condition of men. Hauing learned any pointes of Chri∣stian religion, they are woont to say that to be good in Spayne, but in India nothing woorth, for that they desire not to alter their maners. They haue no beardes, for they peele and plucke vp the heare as faste as it groweth. They take no pietie on sicke folke, suche as bee very sicke, they gyue ouer to some one kynsman or neighbour of theyrs, or els carry them to the mountaynes to dye there, leauing with them some small portion of bread and water, and so goe theyr way. The elder they waxe, the woorse they bee: vntyll they be .xi. or .xii. yeeres olde, some hope there is that they would prooue ciuil and vertuous, when they grow elder, they be∣come bruit beasts. In conclusion, I say that god neuer created so corrupte a people for vice and beastlinesse, without any mixture of goodnesse and ciuilitie: they are as blockishe as Asses, making no accompt at all to kyll them selues.</P>

in nature of soyle, greatnesse, disposition of the ayre, &amp; other such lyke thynges, as <HI>Cortesius</HI> him selfe writeth vnto Charles the fifth, humbly desiryng his maiestie to allowe of that name.

<P>This kyng was so welthie, so mightie, his dominions so large, that the inhabiters knew no other prince in all the worlde, of him <HI>Cortesius</HI> had intelligence by <HI>Montegius</HI> and <HI>Portucarrerius,</HI> and from him certaine rich presentes for his maister Charles Them∣perour, as in the aforesayd discourse of the west Indish Ilands it hath ben sayde. Wherefore the .16. day of August, in the yeere of our Lorde .1520. <HI>Ferdinandus Cortesius,</HI> with .15. light horsemen, and fyue hundred footemen well appoynted, besides three noble men of the citie <HI>Cempoal,</HI> named <HI>Teuchius, Mamexus,</HI> &amp; <HI>Tamaius,</HI> and .13 hundred men of that countrey, to serue in steede of packe horses, for cariage, after the maner there, began to set forwarde from his Castle <HI>Vera crux,</HI> towardes <HI>Themistitan</HI> in <HI>Mexico,</HI> di∣stant from thence Westwarde a hundred leagues, or thereabout. <HI>Cempoal</HI> standeth from <HI>Vera Crux</HI> .4. leagues, eche league in this countrey is .4. Italian miles. Foure dayes iourney from <HI>Cempoal Cortesius</HI> was enterteined curtuously by the inhabiters of a good∣ly

shyre named <HI>Sienchimalen,</HI> as also by the citizens of <HI>Texuacan,</HI> after that he had passed with his army an exceedyng hygh hyll, thicke clad with yse &amp; snow euen in the moneth of August. The like enterteynment was offered him &amp; his companie as hee mar∣ched forward, vntill he came to the <HI>Tascaltecans</HI> lande, who are so great enemies vnto the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> that liuyng amyd their domi∣nions, they had rather want their greatest necessaries, to wit salt, and cotton to cloath them, than become subiects in any wise to the Prince of <HI>Mexico.</HI> With these <HI>Tascaltecans, Cortesius</HI> had three conflictes passing through their countrey, &amp; in the ende valiantly gaue them the ouerthrow. <HI>Tascalteca</HI> is a greater citie, more po∣pulous,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tascalteca.</HI></NOTE> and better serued than <HI>Granata</HI> in Spayne was, at what time the Moores yelded: their bread is made of <HI>Maiz,</HI> that is, In∣dish corne, a very good seat for hauking, hunting, &amp; freshe water fishing, sea fish is scarse, for it standeth from the sea aboue .50. lea∣gues: of pulse good store. This towne wals, &amp; houses in number 20000. built of stone, high, &amp; strong, in respect of the enemy euer at hand: they keepe markets and fayres. The people doth weare hose, and maketh good accompt of Iewels, precious stones, of crestes, &amp; bushes of feathers, to set them foorth in the warres, they garnishe euery thing with gold: wood is brought to be sold to the market on mens shoulders: timber, boordes, bricke, lime, &amp; stone, are vsuall merchandise. Theyr Carpenters, Masons, &amp; Potters, are very skilfull. There is no vessell wrought amongst vs more artificially than theyrs is Medicinable hearbes are solde openly. They vse baths, the nation politike, gouerned in maner of a com∣mon wealth. The whole circuit of this prouince is .90. leagues, full of townes, boroughes, and villages, hils and dales most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruit∣full, &amp; well stored of good souldyers, in respecte of their enemyes rounde about them. About one league of this citie encamped <HI>Cor∣tesius,</HI> &amp; by his spials vnderstanding the citizens not to mistrust or feare any inuasion, tooke the strongest part therof by night: in the morning came the best citizens to offer him all obedience. <HI>Cortesi∣us</HI> than returning with the victorie &amp; victuals to his campe, found it in a troublesome mutinie for the great distresses &amp; present cala∣mies they thought them selues to be in, so far of from their owne country, in the midst of their enemies This mutinie appeased he with good woords, &amp; comfortable reasons, persuading them their enemies to be weaker, the spreadyng abroade of the gospell to be

now in their hands, them selues to be Spaniardes, who esteeme not death to wyn glory: a most happy death that to be, where life is spent in the conquest of infidelles and barbares, &amp; to lye by the sea side idlely, that were to no purpose.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Churultecal.</HI></NOTE> Thus appeased he the re∣bellious myndes of his companyons, and after .20. dayes abode made in this prouince, he led them into an other shire for pastures and riuers the most commodious, for habitation best in all that countrey. The principall citie hath name <HI>Churultecal,</HI> as great, as faire, as <HI>Tascalteca,</HI> and so gouerned, vntil the king of <HI>Mexico</HI> op∣pressed it. Here was <HI>Cortesius</HI> receyued with songes, musicall in∣struments, and trumpets, by the priestes and children of the citie after their maner, &amp; wel feasted. The end of all this mirth was an vprore of the inhabiters agaynst him, procured by the kyng of <HI>Mexico,</HI> as it was supposed, whereof <HI>Cortesius</HI> hauing secrete in∣telligence by a woman of <HI>Cempoal</HI> that folowed his Campe, sum∣moned a parle with the beste citizens of <HI>Churultecal,</HI> at his owne lodging. Those citizens first laid he fast by the heles, &amp; than spee∣dely with his army, warned to be in a readinesse for that purpose, set vpon the deceiptful Barbares of a soden, before that they were throughly prouided, and gaue them the ouerthrow. The prince of <HI>Mexico</HI> acquitted him selfe of this vprore, protesting by his Am∣bassadors to <HI>Cortesius,</HI> that his disloyall subiectes the <HI>Churultecals</HI> had bruted that conspiracie vnder his name to doe him iniury, whom they would not willingly obeye. He sent withall rich pre∣sentes, praying <HI>Cortesius</HI> to come to <HI>Themistitan,</HI> promising him that he should want nothyng there, notwithstandyng the harde prouision thereof in so barren a place, altogeather in the water. To conducte <HI>Cortesius</HI> thyther, he sent also certayne Gentlemen for guydes, and other of his nobilitie to receyue him as he came neare. To speake of euery curtesie shewed him in this iourney, and to wryte of euery place he passed, and particulerly to rehearse euery dayes iourney, euery hyll, towne, ryuer, house, and gar∣deyne, by the way, would breede ouermuche tediousnesse. In fewe, the Lordes of the countrey, as he went, vsed him well, e∣specially in <HI>Guazucingo</HI> prouince, and <HI>Chialcho</HI> shyre, the one whereof was violently oppressed by the prince of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the o∣ther willingly subiect vnto him. In the cold mountaynes he wan∣ted no wood, in the townes hee was prouided for, and his

companions, who were of <HI>Cempoallens, Tastaltecans, Chu∣rultecans,</HI> &amp; <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zucinges,</HI> in number .4000. of Spaniards not aboue .300. In this maner, <HI>Cortesius</HI> accompanyed &amp; folowed, came at the length into a vale, bearing name <HI>Colua</HI>▪ wherein be two meres, the one salt water of .60. leagues in circuit, the other a freshet. Partly on the land, partly in the salt meere standeth <HI>Iz∣tapalapa</HI> a fayre towne, from whence to <HI>Themistitan,</HI> the roy∣all seat of <HI>Mexico,</HI> there lyeth a way on a stone wall, two speares length broad, built vp in the water by hand with infinite charges, the wall serueth also for a bridge, by this bridge sides stand three fayre townes, <HI>Mesicalcingo, Coluacan,</HI> &amp; <HI>VVichilabusco.</HI> The first is supposed to haue .3000. houses, the second .6000. the third .4000. wel built, especially their Towers, &amp; their Temples wherin they doe sacrifice. In these townes great aboundaunce of salt is made, that serueth all such as doe acknowledge the Prince of <HI>Mexico</HI> for their Lord. Other be denied it, as of the <HI>Tascal∣tecans</HI> it was sayde. This salte meere rysing doeth flowe into the Freshet, &amp; as it ebbeth the Freshet falleth into the salt meere agayne. The freshe water may serue neuerthelesse for drinke, the salte water becommeth not freshe therewithall. The wall hath many draught bridges for warfare, and sluses for passage, where toll is payde vnto the kyng. Halfe one league before you come to <HI>Themistitan,</HI> where the lyke bridge or causey from the lande ioyneth with the aforesayde wal, standeth a strong Castle, double walled about, with two strong Towers, not possible to be con∣quered. To this place came a thousande Gentlemen Courtiers foorth of the citie to receyue <HI>Cortesius,</HI> all apparelled a lyke, sa∣luting him one by one after theyr countrey maner, to wytte, tou∣chyng the ground with theyr finger, and than kyssyng it, in signe of reuerence. After all them came the kyng of <HI>Mexico Monte∣zuma</HI> him selfe in the middle of the bridge, accompanyed with two hundred of his nobles, orderly two and two, in better attyre then the other aforesayd, but all on their bare feete, though euery body in this countrey otherwise weareth shooes. The kyng as he went, leaued vpon the shoulders of two noble men, the one wher∣of was his brother: not that he needed any such helpe, but for that the kynges of <HI>Mexico</HI> are woont so to be honoured, as though they were holden vp by the strength of theyr nobilitie.
<PB N="461" REF="471"/>
These two noble men, <HI>Cortesius</HI> meeting with king <HI>Meteezuma,</HI> and lyghtyng of his horse to imbrace hym, dyd forbyd hym to touche theyr kyng, as an vnlawful action in that countrey: the rest of the kynges company came orderly to salute <HI>Cortesius,</HI> after theyr maner. <HI>Cortesius</HI> presented the kyng with a chayne of Bugle, set with some Diamondes and Rubies, of no great value, but such as pleased the kyng, who rewarded hym agayne with two other chaynes of gold, wrought in maner of sea Crab∣bes, &amp; Snails, &amp; so returned into y<SUP>e</SUP> citie with <HI>Cortesius</HI> againe, where he, lodgyng hym in the royal pallace, erected therein for hym a throne, and presented hym the seconde tyme with other riche gyftes, and prouision of all thynges necessary for hym and his trayne. All the bridge length, as he went with the kyng, stoode on eche syde certayne great Temples, wherein were sa∣crificed slaues, and chyldren payed for tribute by kyng <HI>Metee∣zumaes</HI> vassalles.

The two lakes go one into the other at a streict, caused by litle hylles that runne amyd all the foresayde playne. This streict is passed by boate out of the one lake into the other, to all the townes standyng on either syde of the aforesayd lakes.

Of these foure wayes, one was that, where <HI>Cortesi∣us</HI> met with kyng <HI>Muteezuma.</HI> In one of these walles or brid∣ges, freshe water is brought from the lande into the citie by two gutters, no lesse in quantitie then hoggesheades: the one thereof serueth when y<SUP>e</SUP> other is either stopped, or musty. The streats are streight, many in number, built much after the maner of Uenice, both to go by lande and by water. The brydges ouer the water in this citie be made of woodde, of suche breadth that tenne may passe ouer them togeather, so many in number, that it were a thyng almost infinite to recken them.</P>
<P><PB REF="473"/>The number of houses therein amounteth to .60. thousande. Amongest other one streate is very large, sumptuously buylte, and famous for all sortes of merchaundies, that prouince yeeldeth, wont to be solde there .60. thousande merchauntes, as it is thought dayly haunt that streat. There are solde sun∣dry sortes of mettales iewelles, fruites, foule, hearbes, and all other necessaries seruyng for meates, clothes, warfar, buyldings, and pleasure. For euery speciall kynde of merchaundies, is ap∣poynted a speciall standyng by it selfe. They sell by tale and measure, the vse of weyghtes as yet they haue not. Theyr mony is a kynde of Nutte shels, of the kyrnell it selfe is made theyr drynke. The tree is planted vnder the bowes of some other for defence, vntyl it be growen strong, hable to abyde the heate of the Sunne, then is the fense tree cut downe, and that let to con∣tinue, many Lordes haue thereof great reuenewes in that coun∣trey. Steele and Iron they want, in steede whereof they vse to make theyr instrumentes of a kynde of harde stone, wherewith they woorke golde, syluer, copper, brasse, exellently wel in what fourme or shape so euer they lyste. You can not shewe them any kynde of thyng, but they wyll drawe it, and set it out most lyuely in metall, so cunnyng artificers they be. To the markets all thinges are brought, eyther by water in <HI>Canoaes,</HI> or on slaues backes. There standeth a goodly palace in the market place for iudgement. There be resydent alwayes .x. or .xii. graue se∣nators, to see good order kept in that streate, to decide controuer∣sies happenyng there, to punyshe offenders. Other see what is to be solde in the market, and what measure is made. Many gorgeous temples be in this citie, many goodly towers buylte where noble men haue ben buryed, with gallant chappelles to theyr Idolles, many princely palaces, for that all the nobilitie of that countrey lyeth some parte of the yeere in the citie, and the best citizens great ryche men. The good order and policie in so barbarous a nation, is wonderfull to beholde. Concernyng their abhominable Idolatry, <HI>Cortesius</HI> is worthy of great commendati∣on, for the throwyng downe the Idoles where he came, beyng a stranger, though the princes of that prouince and <HI>Meteezuma</HI> al∣so tooke it not well, principally in the palace, persuadyng them that it was not seemely for a kyng to worshyppe that whiche a

Euery noble man hath, besydes the palaces in the citie, his castle, souldiers, receyuers, &amp; other officers in the countrey: and neere the court gallant houses for recreation, with pleasaunt gardens, orchardes, pondes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Courtiers.</NOTE> &amp; other the lyke delightes. The noble men and Gentlemen of this coun∣trey, can not be fewe in number, whereas dayly the court is fur∣nished with fyue hundred young gentlemen, besydes the multi∣titude of seruyng men that attende on them. And the fashion in this countrey is of all the nobilitie, to sende theyr sonnes for edu∣cation sake vnto the Court, although many of them dwel an hun∣dred and fyftie, or two hundred leagues of. So large &amp; so mygh∣tie is the kyngdome of <HI>Mexico,</HI> &amp; yet so well gouerned, the kyng so duetyfully obeyed of all his subiectes, aswel absent as present, eche shyre yeeldyng and duely paying vnto hym the commodi∣ties therof, according to theyr custome, that <HI>Cortesius</HI> thinketh no prince in the world to be more feared &amp; reuerenced of his people. The kyng hath sundry goodly pallaces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kynges houses.</NOTE> and in them many ryche and costly ornamentes, of golde, of syluer, of feathers, so artifi∣cially wrought, that neyther any sort of needle worke, nor kynde of picture, may seeme to make the lyke shewe. Among the rest, three special houses of recreation the kyng hath in his palace. In one of them are a number of moustrous and defourmed persons,<MILESTONE N="1"/>
dwarfes, crookebackes, syngyng men by nature, twoo headed monsters, and others, with theyr keepers. The second house is <MILESTONE N="2"/> so large, that in it commodiously two kynges may be resident. The place is set foorth with many Alabaster &amp; Marble pyllers, ten goodly pondes therin, well stored with fyshe, and foule, of al sortes that eyther do lyue in the water, or on the lande, with their keepers, and diuersities of meates for theyr diuers natures. In this place kept he also young chyldren, that had whyte heades, &amp; were of fayre complexion, aswel boyes as gyrles. The thyrde house serued for Lions, Tygers, Wolues, Foxes, and other the <MILESTONE N="3"/> lyke wylde beastes, eche sort in theyr seueral dennes. The least of these three houses is so well buylt, that the kyng at his pleasure may lodge therein, with all his court. The prince is thus ser∣ued. Fyue hundred gentlemen at the least, with theyr folowers, gyue attendaunce at the court al the day long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seruice of the kyng.</NOTE> though they come not alwayes in the kynges syght. These gentlemen syt downe
<PB REF="474"/>
to dynner when the kyng sytteth, and do fare as well as he, their folowers haue theyr reuersion. The buttrey, cellar, pantry, and other offices neuer shut, come in who wyll, meate &amp; drynke he can not want. The hall wherein the kyng dyneth, is matted vnder foote, his meate is brought vp by .300. young men pen∣sioners, fleshe, fyshe, fruites, salates of all sortes vppon chaffyng dyshes in the wynter to keepe the meates warme. These way∣ters neuer come neere the boord, for the kyng sytteth on a leather cushyng artificially wrought, at a table raylled about, within the precincte whereof standeth his Sewer, to set hym downe those meates he lyketh of best. At his ryght hande syxe olde men syt downe, vnto whom the kyng hym selfe carueth. The kyng wash∣eth before meate and after, he is serued in earthen dyshes, his cuppes be of the same mettall: he shyfteth hym selfe foure tymes a daye. Whatsoeuer he hath once vsed, be it apparell▪ napery, or any other kynde of housholde stuffe, it is neuer brought hym any more to vse, but bestowed by hym vpon his seruauntes or frendes at conuenient tymes. For honour sake eche one commeth into the palace barefoote, in most humble wyse they come before the king, when they are called, bowing downe theyr heads, theyr eies to the ground. It were great presumption to looke the king in the face when he talketh with any of them. A man would thynke they were all dombe in the presence of the kyng, suche is theyr silence. No man dare turne his backe to the kyng, but departyng from hym eche one goeth backewarde. No man dare go out of his place when the kyng passeth by. At his goyng abrode he is fo∣lowed with a great troupe of his nobles and gentelmen, and hath three rods borne before hym, one whereof he taketh in his owne hand when he commeth foorth out of his lytter, wherin common∣ly he is caryed abrode. In conclusion no heathen prince hath so many cerimonies as this kyng of <HI>Mexico.</HI> Quietly in this citie from the .8. of September the yeere of our lorde .1520. vntyll Maie folowing, remayned <HI>Cortesius</HI> with al honour, enioying his pictorye, and rulyng so myghty a kyngdome conquered by hym, with al prosperitie.

countrey, which he him selfe had paynefully conquered vnto their pleasure, by forged patents from the Spanyshe kyng. Muche a∣mazed at the fyrst was <HI>Cortesius</HI> with this tydinges, consideryng that if he went agaynst <HI>Naruaez,</HI> the <HI>Mexicanes</HI> not yet through∣ly brought in subiection might in the meane time reuolte: againe if he staied, <HI>Naruaez</HI> might put his conquest in ioperdy, violently forcing y<SUP>e</SUP> countrey euerywhere as he came. The matter was tho∣rowly knowen to the barbares of <HI>Themistitan.</HI> The king himselfe had brought hym by his vassalles, paynted in a table, the ships, theyr number, artillarye, horsemen and footemen landed. In the ende <HI>Cortesius</HI> resolued hym selfe to go agaynst <HI>Naruaez.</HI> Wher∣fore leauyng at <HI>Themistitan</HI> a Garryson of Spaniardes, the whi∣che he hyghly commended vnto <HI>Muteezuma,</HI> marched forward with .170 footemen, sendyng other .80. that way before hym. <HI>Naruaez</HI> lykewyse came on agaynst <HI>Cortesius,</HI> and had nowe ta∣ken <HI>Cempoal,</HI> and styrred vp agaynst hym those citizens. <HI>Cortesius</HI> hauyng intelligence of <HI>Naruaez</HI> certayne beyng there in an hygh towre garded with .800. souldiers, and .19.

In the meane while the citizens of <HI>Themistitan</HI> reuolted against theyr prince and the Spanyshe gouernement, as by a messenger dispatched thither from <HI>Cempoal,</HI> to declare <HI>Cortesius</HI> good hap and <HI>Naruaes</HI> imprisoment, it was vnderstoode. The castle of <HI>The∣mistitan</HI> besieged, in many places set a fyre and vndermyned, the Spanyshe Gartyson to be in great ieopardye, the flye boates they made, burnt, the messenger him selfe gree∣uously wounded, <HI>Muteezuma</HI> the kyng onely to fauoure them, and hym nowe scarsely obeyed, the nobles to choose death rather then to obey suche geastes, that keepe theyr kyng lyke a warde, that dispossesse them of their owne citie, that meyntayne therin theyr enimies the <HI>Tascaltecans</HI> &amp; <HI>Guazuingoes,</HI> euen before theyr face at theyr owne charges, to despight them, that deuoure theyr vittaylles harde to come by in that citie so situated in the water, that iniurie them, that lay on tributes, that by hooke a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by crooke make away from them whatsoeuer good there is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had, that breake downe theyr Idolles, and suppresse theyr aun∣cient rytes and cerimonies.</P>
<P><PB REF="475"/><HI>Cortesius</HI> therefore speedily with .70. horses and fyue hundred footemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius re∣turneth to Themistitan.</NOTE> and as muche artillery as he could, returneth againe to <HI>Themistitan,</HI> whyther he came about mydsommer daye. At <HI>Cortesius</HI> entrie into the citie agayne, the Spanyardes, throughly beaten by the Barbares with dartes and stones from hygh pine∣apple trees, &amp; an hygh tower that was neere, began to take hart, and to hope for good happe after theyr great troubles. The Barbares lykewyse vnderstandyng of <HI>Cortesius</HI> commyng, grew to be more cruel and fyrce▪ with horrible cryes, shootyng of theyr arrowes, and throwyng an infinite number of dartes and stones, for the company of them was innumerable, that the ayre seemed darke and cloudie therewith. <HI>Cortesius</HI> sent out a captaine with two hundred to rescue the Spanyardes in the palace. This captayne slue many of the Barbares, but the multitude was so great that he dyd litle good. Foure of his souldyers were slayne, he hym selfe, greeuousely wounded, had much a do to retyre a∣gayne. <HI>Cortesius</HI> set vppon them at an other syde, litle harme dyd he them likewyse, for that as sone as the Barbares had spent theyr dartes and stones, eche one gat vp into the turrette of his house to saue hym selfe. The fyght helde on fyrcely a good while. <HI>Cortesius</HI> was forced in the ende to retyre with some daunger, and losse of many of his soldiers. The whiche thyng when the Barbares had espied, they begane to geue a newe assalte on e∣uery syde of the palace, to fyre the gates, and stoutely to con∣tinue batterye, fyghtyng euen vppon theyr felowes dead car∣casses, and wyshyng with them rather to be slayne, then to lyue in bondage vnder the Spanyardes. Thus spent they in armes the whole daye, yeeldyng a newe supply of men (the multitude was so great) foure tymes an houre, and raysyng clamors all the nyght long to the Spanyardes great annoy, that then coulde take no rest after theyr paynefull and daungerous conflycte the daye tyme, fewe in number, fyghtyng from mornyng to nyght without intermission, and .80. of theyr companye wounded. The next day the Barbares set vppon the Spanyardes agayne. <HI>Cortesius</HI> planteth .xiii. feelde peeces, and furnysheth his van∣garde with harquebuziers and archers, but theyr enimies so litle esteemed death, that seyng at one shoot a dozen of theyr fe∣lowes torne in peeces, all feare set a syde, they supplyed styll the

voyde places. The day folowyng, the Spanyardes wanting vic∣tuals, issued out in open feelde: they slue many Barbares, they o∣uerthrew the houses neare y<SUP>e</SUP> pallace, they tooke certaine draught bridges, but at night they returned with their Generall and 50. of their company wounded, as hungry as they went foorth. Where∣fore they caused warlike engines to be made of boords, in fourme of a fouresquare house, going on wheeles, placing in ech one ther∣of .20. shot, whom many rascall souldiers folowed with pikeaxes and hatchets, to do harme that way in destroying their buildings: but stones &amp; dartes came so mightily &amp; so thicke about the Spa∣niardes eares, that such as went thus foorth, were faine to creepe home againe out of their engines torne in peeces: they that taried at home could not once looke out but they were domaged. Kyng <HI>Muteezuma,</HI> desirous to dissuade his citizens from the assalt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Muteezuma slayne.</NOTE> she∣wyng him selfe vnto them out of the Pallace, had a blowe with a stone, whereof in three dayes he dyed. This Prince was of a ve∣ry good nature, wyse, and very patient, his body the Spaniardes lefte vnto the <HI>Mexicans</HI> to bury, for that they them selues had lit∣tle other leasure then to thinke how to saue their liues, rather than to bury the dead.</P>
<P>The next day the nobles of the countrey came to a parle with <HI>Cortesius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parle.</NOTE> at the same place where <HI>Muteezuma</HI> tooke his deaths wound. <HI>Cortesius</HI> exhorted them to peace, otherwise threatning the vtter decay &amp; ruine of that their so famous and noble a citie, with protestation of pietie on them whom once he had taken to be his friendes, promising pardon for that which was done, and settyng downe what befel vnto other nations that refused his friendshyp. The <HI>Mexicans</HI> making small accompte of his woordes, answe∣red, that they tooke him for no friend, but for their enemy, that he should depart with all his trayne out of their countrey if he would haue peace, otherwise they woulde so long continue theyr siege, vntill by force they had dryuen him out, though for euery Spany∣arde slayne, there dyed a thousande <HI>Mexicans,</HI> for his friendshyp they cared not, pardon they asked not, most willingly they would all dye, so that they might deliuer their posteritie from the Spa∣nyshe tyranny.</P>
<P>Wherefore <HI>Cortesius,</HI> waying with him selfe the great daunger that presently might ensue for want of victualles if he stayed, the
<PB REF="476"/>
<HI>Mexicans</HI> continuing their assalte, for perill to be stopped at the draught bridges if he departed, so muche the more for that these Barbares were not ignorant of .70. thousand ducates heaped vp togeather by him in that prouince: set vppon them the seconde tyme with the aforesayde engines, but all in vayne. So stoutly their enemyes defended them selues, and so fiercely they resisted the assalte giuen. Chiefly the Spaniardes courage appeared in winnyng of a certayne Tower that alwayes commaunded them, nexte in the ruine of such houses as for the nearenes thereof bred them great incombrance and perill. After many woundes recey∣ued, and great slaughter done on both sides, the principal citizens, counterfectyng a conclusion of peace, promysed obedience vnto <HI>Cortesius,</HI> so that all deedes past myght be forgotten. <HI>Cortesius</HI> ly∣kyng well thereof, at their request set free a priest he had of theirs in prison, to deale betwyxt them, and throughly persuaded that no guyle was ment, withdrew his company from skirmishing. But he was no sooner set downe to dynner, after his restlesse afflicti∣ons and continuall labours, but the <HI>Mexicans</HI> tooke the towne bridges, and voyded the trenches, which <HI>Cortesius</HI> for passage had caused to be filled vp. Presently therefore he rushed out amongst them agayne with his horsemen, but the iourney went so hardly with the Spanyardes, that <HI>Cortesius</HI> wounded in the head was scarsly able to retyre agayne, many of his company were slayne, such as escaped were not able to continue in the fielde any longer, wearyed with blowes, worne out with hunger. It remayned on∣ly, that now they eyther presently must peryshe, or els depart out of the countrey. By nyght therefore <HI>Cortesius</HI> and his souldyers priuely thought to slyp away with <HI>Muteezumaies</HI> children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cortesius flee∣eth out of The∣mistitan.</NOTE> and certayne of the <HI>Mexican</HI> nobles captiues, charging the Spanysh kyng his officers with the fif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h part of his treasure, and takyng the residue thereof with him. But the Barbares hauyng intelli∣gence thereof, oppressed them in the way, tooke theyr goods, slue many of the Spaniards, and with them their captiues: if happely any escaped, they were such as marched in the most, for both the vangarde and rereward were altogeather discomfited and lost, to the number of .150 Spanyardes 42. horses .2000 <HI>Tascalte∣cans,</HI> and <HI>Guazuzings,</HI> that ayded them.

by his enemyes that folowed him, nothyng holpen by the way as he repayred home, refreshyng his Campe with a dead horse, after fyue dayes spent with the foode of parched corne, and that in small quantitie before he came to <HI>Tascalteca.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tascaltecans</HI> curtuously enterteyned him and his, with whom he made his abode .20. dayes, to refreshe his wearyed ar∣my: that done, he conquered other cities in that prouince, eyther enemyes vnto the <HI>Tascaltecans,</HI> as <HI>Tepeaca,</HI> where he buylte for safetie of passage <HI>Segura la Frontera:</HI> or suche as for feare of the <HI>Mexicans</HI> had not yeelded them selues before, to wyt, <HI>Guaccachi∣ulla, Izzuca,</HI> and other principall townes therabout.

Such was the hatred of the <HI>Tascaltecans</HI> and <HI>Guazuzings</HI> agaynst the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> that they carried the tymber vppon theyr shoulders from <HI>Tascalteca</HI> to <HI>Ta∣zuco,</HI> without any grudging, for the prouision aforesayde.

<P>The citie he besieged in three places at once, after that hee had cutte of all the freshe water conductes, and taken the wayes

The siege lasted neuerthelesse ten weekes, in the ende whereof with continuall battry the citie defaced, and more than .100000. citizens worne out partly in fight, and partly wasted with misery and hunger, <HI>Cortesius</HI> tooke theyr new kyng priuely walkyng in a secret corner of the lake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Themistitan conquered a∣gayne.</NOTE> and subdued throughly with him the ci∣tie <HI>Themistitan</HI> .14. townes by the lake syde, &amp; all the <HI>Mexican</HI> re∣alme and prouince, vnto the Spanyshe crowne, in the iurisdiction whereof it doeth presently remayne. The spoyle of the citie, in va∣lue great, <HI>Cortesius</HI> diuided amongst the Spanyshe souldyers, re∣seruyng the fyfth parte therof, and certayne fine feather woorkes, the whiche he sent into <HI>Europe,</HI> to be presented vnto Charles the fyfth kyng of Spayne, and Emperour, than in Germanie.</P>

I doe not thinke but that in very deede these Spanyardes that sayled <PB REF="479"/> thus rounde about the world, folowyng continually the west, dyd lose on day in theyr iourney. In lyke maner I am of opi∣nion, that if the Portugales folowed continually the Easte rounde about the worlde, they should fynde at theyr iourneyes ende one day to many. I meane it thus. Let two passengers depart from <HI>Lisbona,</HI> the one Westward, the other Eastwarde, rounde about the worlde, and both re∣turne home agayne that daye whiche we do call Mydsommer daye. I saye that day woulde be to the Easterne passengers the next day after Mydsommer daye, to the westerne trauey∣lers but Mydsommer euen. My reason is, for that euery .xv. degrees of the great circle East or West, maketh difference one houre: wherefore Eastward after fyfteene degrees, you shal begyn your daye one houre sooner: after fyfteene degrees Westward, you shall ende your daye one houre later, then you dyd in that place whence you dyd set foorth. The whole circle than of the worlde conteynyng precisely .360 degrees, that is, foure and twentie tymes .xv proportionably to the .24 hours of the day, how can it be otherwise, but that these passen∣gers traueylyng styll eyther Westwarde rounde about the worlde, or Eastwarde, shoulde either mysse a daye at theyr iorneyes ende or elles fynde one to many. </ITEM>
