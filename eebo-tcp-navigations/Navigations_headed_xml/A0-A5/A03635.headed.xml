<HEAD>❧ To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was not with∣out</HI> great reason, (gen∣tle Reader,) that the auncient Poets in old time; fained <HI>Phaeton</HI> to fal from heauen, and to be drowned in the deapth of the Sea: because not con∣tented with his calling, he woulde of a prowde ambicious minde, presume to take vppon him the gouernement of his Father <HI>Phaebus</HI> Chariot, being a thing farre beyond his skil to compas. For surely there is not in the whole world, a more pestilent euil, or a thing that breedeth so much mischife, as doth the cankred and most accursed vice of ambition, which not onely worketh the ruine of the partye therewith pos∣cessed: but often times causeth the con∣fusion of many mighty Monark<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and
<PB REF="3"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e vtter ouerthrovv of whole Coun∣treyes and common weales.</P>
<P>Wherewith the words of <HI>Cornelius <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>rus</HI> do verry aptly agree, who saith that after the desier of principallytie had longe continued in the mindes of men vndiscouered: when Princes be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an to enlarge their Limittes, and to make their dominions greater: when they began to conquer kingdomes, and enuying the felicitie of common weales, desired the confusion and vtter ouerthrowe one of another. Then be∣gan this ambition first of all to breake out, which as (Saint <HI>Barnard</HI> saieth) pleaseth and delighteth euery man, and yet is there nothinge that doth more cruelly crucifie or breede more vnqui∣etnes, then it doth.</P>
<P>For from whence springeth bloody warres so much, as from this roote of Ambition.</P>
<P>What causeth so manye to endure the extremitie of the coulde Winter nightes, by lying abroade in the open
<PB REF="3"/> Feeldes without any harbour, and to abide the heate of the whot Sommer season being clogged with the carry∣age of their vnweldye armoure: but onelye ambicion?</P>
<P>Is it ought els but this greedy ambi∣tion, that maketh men to trauell so many intemperate countryes, and des∣perately to runne into so many doubt∣full daingers as they do?</P>
<P>In conclusion, there is nothing that more breaketh the bandes of beneuo∣lence, abateth the obedience of childrē towardes their Parentes: the loue of Parentes, towardes their Children: the dutye of subiectes, towardes their Princes, and the care of Countryes commoditye, from al men, as doth this abominable vice of ambicion.</P>
<P>Whereof dyuers historyes aswell of auncient time, as examples daylye shewed amongst vs, is a most perfect testimony.</P>
<P>By the greedye ambition of <HI>Scilla Marius, Carbo, Cinna, Pompeius,</HI> and <HI>Caesar,</HI>
<PB REF="4"/> there were more slaine amongst the <HI>Romaines,</HI> then in conquering to them the kingdome of the whole world.</P>
<P><HI>Silla</HI> condempned &amp; caused to be exe∣cuted 80000. <HI>Romaines,</HI> besydes many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore that were slaine in the ciuil wars, betweene him and both the <HI>Marius.</HI></P>
<P>Also <HI>Pompeius</HI> and <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> the one suffring no peere, the other no su∣periour, by their insasiable ambition, caused innumerable people to be slaine betweene them, and subuerted the best and most renowmed publique weale, in the whole world: and finally, enioy∣ing little time to reioyce them in theyr vnlawfull desires, <HI>Pompeius</HI> shamefullye flyinge, had his head stroken off, by the commaundement of <HI>Ptolome</HI> Kinge of <HI>Egipt:</HI> vnto whom as to his frende he fled for succour, and <HI>Caesar</HI> that was the vanquisher, was shortlye after cruellye murdred in the Senate, with daggers, by them whom he best trusted, and most specially fauowred.</P>
<P>It would require much time, and a
<PB REF="4"/> verye large volume, to make mencion of all those that heretofore, by coueting to encrease their credit and estimation in the worlde, and to aduaunce them∣selues to high dignities, haue brought both themselues and their countryes to extreame daunger.</P>
<P>But I will leaue heere to rehearse any more of such antiquitye, and shew a more liuely &amp; lamentable example, of three renowmed Princes: who not longe since by their ambicious desires, did not onely procure their owne vn∣timely death: but also the destruction of many thousandes of their people, in the maintenaunce of their vniust quar∣rels, as by that which followeth shall more manifestly appeare.</P>
<P>But before I proceede to the matter, I haue here thought good, for the rea∣ders better instruction, breflye to discribe the country of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and the customes thereof.</P>

<HEAD>¶<HI>A Dolorous discourse of a most terrible blouddy Battell fought in Barbarie the.</HI> 4. <HI>of August.</HI> 1578.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Nderstande, that not long synce, there raygned ouer the countrey of <HI>Barbary,</HI> a King named <HI>Mully Hamet Shek▪</HI> who had diuers Sons by sun∣dry his Wiues and Concubines: for there they maye haue as manye wiues as they wyll.</P>
<P>The King passing on a tyme from <HI>Moroccus,</HI> the chiefe City of his coū∣trey, towards another Countrey of his, called <HI>Sus,</HI> was in the mydway, at a place called <HI>Bibon,</HI> murdred by his owne men.</P>
<P>After him raigned one of his Sons called <HI>Mulla Abdula:</HI> by whose mea∣nes a Noble man of y<SUP>t</SUP> countrey, cal∣led <HI>Alcatho Alley,</HI> caused the throtes of eleuen of the Kinges Brethren, to be cutte in one morning.</P>
<PB REF="6"/>
<P> Two other of his brethren fled for feare into Turky, and were there brought vp in the <HI>Turks</HI> warres.</P>
<P>One other of his Brethren named <HI>Mulla Hamet,</HI> remayned styll in <HI>Bar∣bary,</HI> without any violence offered vnto him, and was well beloued of his wicked brother: so that he grew verye rytch, and was in great estimation throughout the whole countrey.</P>
<P>And as cruel murder can neuer lōg rest vnrewarded. This <HI>Alkatho Al∣ley,</HI> the onely minister of the Kinges mischieuous deuise, was in the ende measured with such a lyke measure, as he had before meat to the Kings brethren.</P>
<P>Now the cruel king <HI>Mulla Abdula:</HI> amongst manye other, taking to his wife a bond woman, that was a <HI>Blacke Negro,</HI> had by her a sonne, called <HI>Mulla Sheriffa:</HI> who for that he was of his Mothers complection, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as cōmonly called the <HI>Black King,</HI>
<PB REF="6"/> to whome <HI>Mulla Abdula</HI> his Father commytted the kingdome after his death, as to his onely heyre.</P>
<P><HI>Mulla Hamet,</HI> after the death of his brother <HI>Abdula,</HI> fearing the tyranny of his Blacke Neuew that succeded him, fled incontinently with all his substaunce and treasure, to <HI>Argere,</HI> a Towne belonging to y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Turke,</HI> wher he remayned in good safetie.</P>
<P><HI>Mulla Sheriffa,</HI> hauing for a whyle peaceably possessed the Crowne, be∣came in the ende so cruel a tyrant, as his people therfore hating him, mur¦mured in their mindes at his great seuerity, and in the ende burst out in plaine speches, saying: that the sonne of a bond woman should not raigne ouer them.</P>
<P><HI>Mulla Hamet,</HI> his Vncle, remaining all this whyle at <HI>Argere,</HI> &amp; vnderstā∣ding how the people were enclined, by the procurement of the most part of the Nobility of the Realme: sent to his Brother <HI>Mulla Maluca,</HI> that
<PB REF="7"/> remayned with the <HI>Turke,</HI> wylling him with all expedition, to procure such forces as he coulde, &amp; to returne therwith into the coūtry of <HI>Barbary,</HI> where he certifyed him y<SUP>t</SUP> he shoulde be sure to finde such friendes as hee might easely attaine to y<SUP>e</SUP> Crowne.</P>
<P>With this good hope, <HI>Mulla Malu∣ca,</HI> hauing obtayned of the <HI>Turke</HI> (in recompence of his long seruice with him) a band of. 10000. <HI>Turks.</HI> He en∣tred with them into <HI>Barbary,</HI> where hee was wyllingly receyued by his friends and fauourers, and greatlie succoured, aswel by them, as with y<SUP>e</SUP> substaunce of his brother <HI>Mulla Ha∣mer,</HI> who spared nothing to plea∣sure him with all, or to further his present enterprise.</P>
<P><HI>Mulla Sheriffa,</HI> his Black Nephew, vnderstanding of his comming: Le∣uied a huge Army, to make respstāce against him: but yet although his power farre surmounted the nūber of his enemies, yea: though hee had
<PB REF="7"/> ten to one, more thē his Vncle <HI>Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦la Maluca:</HI> Yet what through his owne valliancie, and the good wyll that he knewe the common people bare to him.</P>
<P><HI>Mulla Maluca,</HI> dyd in short tyme so preuaile against the sayd <HI>Sheriffa,</HI> as dryuing him to the Mountaynes of the countrey, he obteyned possession of the Crowne, and euer synce hath continued king of <HI>Barbary:</HI> where he was well beloued of his people, be∣ing a man very actyue, and of great agillitie, skylfull in warres, wherein from his youth he had alwayes ben trayned vp: and as men report, mi∣nistred Iustice with equitie, much fauouring Christians, and specialie our Nation.</P>
<P>The Blacke king, when he fled in∣to the Mountaynes, carryed with him a great parte of the Treasure of the Countrey, and dayly dystur∣bed the quyet possession of his Vncle <HI>Maluca.</HI> Who slepte not in the
<PB REF="8"/> meane space: but prepared by all meanes to preuent whatsoeuer his Blacke Nephew myght doo to his preiudice. And in the ende, draue him to so great extremitie, that he was forced to craue ayde of the king of <HI>Portingale:</HI> who hath certayne holdes in that countrey.</P>
<P>The Kinge of <HI>Portingale</HI> being a lusty young Gentleman, about. xxiij. yeares of age, peraduenture pricked forwarde by a vaine hope and am∣bitious desire of gaine and glory, not respecting the perril y<SUP>t</SUP> depēded ther vppon: promised the sayd <HI>Sheriffa</HI> to performe his desyre therein. And thereupon leuied an Armye, to the number of. 40000. in all: to wete 16000. <HI>Portingale</HI> footemenne, and 4000. horsemen. 10000. footemen of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> high <HI>Almaines</HI> and <HI>Ita∣lians,</HI> and. 10000. that were Pages, Seruauntes, Purueiours, and such lyke continuallye accompaning the Campe. With this power the king
<PB REF="8"/> of <HI>Portingale</HI> in his owne person<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> accompanied with a great number of his Nobillitie, departed out of his owne countrey on the .xiiii. day of <HI>Iuly.</HI> 1578. and with his whole fleete first ariued at a town in <HI>Spaine</HI> called <HI>Calez:</HI> where he made his a∣bode for y<SUP>e</SUP> space of. viij. whole dayes together, the occasion whereof was, (as some suppose) to furninsh his Ar¦mye with all such things, as should be needefull for the prosecution of his pretensed purpose.</P>
<P>And on the. 22. daye of the foresayd month of Iuly, he gathered his men together, and with all expedition passed frō <HI>Calez,</HI> to another Towne lying within the bord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of <HI>Barba∣ry,</HI> called <HI>Tanos:</HI> where hee mett<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Blacke Kings, who had with him, fyue hundreth <HI>Mores</HI> Horsemen. And after he had also so∣iourned therefor a seasō, he departed from thence to <HI>Argele:</HI> Which is a certayne Houlde that the sayde king
<PB REF="9"/> of <HI>Portingale</HI> hath in <HI>Barbary,</HI> and after his departure from thence.</P>
<P>The fyrst daye, which was the. 29 day of the sayd Iuly: the sayd king of <HI>Portingale</HI> with his whole power, marched forward one League far∣der, which is three of our Englishe miles, &amp; pitched his Tents in a place called <HI>Sweete Riuer.</HI></P>
<P>The second day, he went forward one League more, and in that place remained for the space of two whole dayes. In which tyme there was discouered on the toppe of a verye high hil, a troope of Horsemen of the <HI>Mores,</HI> which wereby estimation, not aboue the number of. 400. in the whole, and the cause of their com∣ming, as it might very well be ima∣gined, was onelye to take a view of the king of <HI>Portingales</HI> Campe, to know of what power he was: whi∣che indeede standeth greatlye with reason, for that after their appea∣raunce, they departed againe so sud∣dainlye
<PB REF="9"/> without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or making any other<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>

<P>The next daye the king of <HI>Portingale</HI> called all his most wyse &amp; best experien∣ced Captaines to counsell, &amp; asked theyr aduise: whether it were better for him with his whole power to martche to∣warde <HI>Alcasany:</HI> which being a drye Towne, though there were in it about the nūber of. 7000. housholds, yet was it but weake, vnmeete to make any great encounter, and not able long to stand in resystaunce.</P>
<P>Or else to proceede forewarde on his waye towards the Towne <HI>Alcasar Ki∣ber,</HI> before named.</P>
<P>This being long debated betweene them, euerie man alleadging what he lysted: After they had all particularly expressed their opinions therin, som one way, and some another way: in the end it was concluded with a general consēt that he should keepe his course toward <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lcasar Kiber,</HI> which he performed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dingly.</P>
<P>He had not passed very farre before he

<P>But because the day was quite spent before the two Armyes could com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y thing neere together, they both <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncāped them selues there that night, in syght the one of the other.</P>

<P>King <HI>Maluca,</HI> fyrst gaue the Onfette vpon the Horsemen of the <HI>Portingales</HI> Armye, but they vallyauntly defended them selues, and in the ende forced <HI>Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a</HI> and his <HI>Mores,</HI> to retyre with the loise of many of them.</P>

<P>Finally, if the king of <HI>Portingale,</HI> had not of an ambicious minde, bene moued to enlarge his Dominions, with ano∣thers losse, and to encrease his Fame by his rashnes: in waging warres with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sayde king <HI>Maluca,</HI> he shoulde not
<PB REF="14"/> haue brought himselfe, &amp; so many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gentlemen, to that myserable ende y<SUP>t</SUP> he dyd, in a barborous countrey, amongst a sort of brutishe Infydelles: but might haue lyued in peace and great prosperi∣tie in his owne countrey, and haue styll continued that commendatiō which by his vertues and vallure he had woon &amp; well deserued: whose lyke for wisdome, courage, and good qualities (in such young yeares) <HI>Portingale</HI> was neuer possessed withall before.</P>
<P>And therefore all Chrinstendome, but especially the poore widdowes, and fa∣therles chyldren, in <HI>Portingale,</HI> maye well with most pittifull complayntes, &amp; lamentable cryes, accompanied with floods of teares: be wayle, though all to late, the vnlucky lot of that vnfortunate Prince, and the dolefull daye, wherin vnaduisedly, he fyrst began this his vn∣happy enterprise.</P>
<P>O myserable man, borne to woe and callamitie: was it not sufficient that a thousande thousande mischiefes, wher∣vnto thou wast borne, shoulde fall vpon
<PB REF="15"/> thee, and ouerwhelme thee in this vale of mysery: but that thou must by thyne owne vnkindly inclination, adde there∣vnto murder, discorde, and deuision be∣twene countrey &amp; countrey, so carelesly: as thou dost, contrary to the custome of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll other earthly creatures of Gods cre∣ating.</P>
<P>What pleasure hast thou in the spoyle of thy people, O thou prowd and ambi∣cions Prince? that to purchase to thy self such things as thou must leaue behynde thee, when God calleth thee away, out of this transitory worlde: wylt put so many in peryll of theyr life. When thou has<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attayned to thy insatiable desyre, thy mynde is neuer satisfyed therwith, vn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yll thou thy selfe arte also become a pray to the woormes of the earth, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>es of the ayre.</P>
<P>And what shall then remayne vnto thee, of all the spoyles and vyctories, that with the bloudshed of many thou∣sande men, thou hast acquyred in thy whole lyfe tyme: surely nothing else but a syllye wynding sheete, and peraduen∣ture
<PB REF="15"/> want that too, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> chaunce <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not the better.</P>
<P>O Christian Princes, imbrace peace, seeke to haue loue and amytie one with another, to the strengthening, estably∣shing, and enlarginge of Christendome: least the Infydelles, for the synnes of you and your people, be a scourge to you all.</P>
<P>Hath not God by his infynite, and incomprehensyble wisedome, wonder∣fullye wrought in the placing of your Prouinces: euerye one with such sun∣drye commodityes, as the one shoulde alwayes haue neede of the other, to the ende that you shoulde lynke in Loue, and lyue in contynuall concorde, one wyth another? Yes verelye: And wherefore doo ye then alter the decree, and determynation of the Almyghtye: Who hath appoynted all these thynges for the benefyte of his people?</P>
<P>O ye Subiectes, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your hartye prayers, for peace and quietnes, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> continuance therof: that you with you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wiues, chyldren, friend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB REF="16" MS="y"/> maye lyue quietly and peaceably toge∣ther, mayntayning with your necessary trauayl, your countreys fertillitie, to the auoyding of penury, and the preuenting of such lyke mischeuous murders, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>stly blouddy broyles, as are before sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en of.</P>
<P>O ye Prelates, Prophets, and Prea∣chers, if you be the Messengers and Ministers of our Sauior Iesus Christ: Preach to your Princes, and as Christ dyd, so do ye perswade youthfull Prin∣ces from seeking such bloudy battels: so shall ye be knowne to be the Disciples of that heauenly <HI>Messias.</HI></P>
<P>But if any perswade Princes to the shedding of blood, murdring of Inno∣centes, and to make spoyle of the people, whome God hath onely created to his glory. They are not the seruauntes of Iesus of Iesus Christ: but in deede the very schoollers of Antichrist, &amp; the mes∣sengers of mischiefe.</P>
<P>To conclude, I woulde councell all men▪ of what calling so euer they be, as
<PB REF="16"/> well Princes, as priuate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>¦tistie: them selues with that whiche <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t shall please God to in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>te vnto the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: not seeking by vnlawful meanes, to en∣haunce them selues higher then GOD hath appointed, least for their great vn∣thankfulnes, he do not onely disapoynt them of their pretensed purpose: but al∣so bereaue them of those benefits, which before he had bountifully be stowed vpō them, which is the iust rewarde belon∣ging to such vngratefull persons.</P>
<P>Surely if men woulde call to remem∣braunce, the care, trouble, feare, &amp; conti∣nuall daunger, that alwayes accompa∣nieth those that be aduaunced to highe dignities, and woulde <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aye with all, what assured safetie, con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>eth in the meane estate: I am full<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swaded y<SUP>t</SUP> they would not thē so pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e for promo∣tion as they dayly doo, nor seeke with such incessaunt payne and peryll, to pur∣chase a thing so vnprofytable: but ra∣ther to shunne it as a most pestelent e∣uyl, being y<SUP>e</SUP> only corrupter of good ma∣ners, &amp; vanquisher of vertue, esteeming
