<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>SOme other Reasons may be given for the publishing this Book in <HI>English</HI> besides the Common Rea∣son of all <HI>Booksellers,</HI> which is the Im∣provement of their Trade (there being hitherto nothing of this Subject in our Language) and they are these; such who have not been at <HI>Paris</HI> may here read of those beauties which have ren∣der'd that City (of late years especially) so famous: Others who have had the satisfaction of seeing what is here menti∣oned, will not find it unpleasant to re∣fresh their memory with the descripti∣ons given in this Book. The lovers of those two most beautiful Sister-Arts, <HI>Painting</HI> and <HI>Sculpture,</HI> will be plea∣sed to read of the Excellent Perfor∣mances in both kinds at <HI>Paris.</HI> It is real∣ly the Incouragement which is given to
<PB REF="4"/>
these Arts, and their near Kinswoman <HI>Architecture,</HI> that makes a City Polite and Beautiful, advances an In-Land Trade, and makes Artists so strive and vye with each other, till by degrees they arrive at the Perfection of the An∣tients. The Curious will be no less plea∣sed to read of the choice Collections of Medals and all sorts of Rarities. Nor will others want a serious Entertainment in this Book, to meet here several Passages of the <HI>French</HI> History, and to consider the Occonomy and Government; not forgetting also the Piety of <HI>Paris.</HI> To one purpose more this Translation may be useful; and that is, to such Young Gentlemen who go over; (as some do almost daily) in regard this Book in their Pocket with them, will be, as their Informer, so their Guide, and lead them directly to such Sights as they most fansie.</P>

<HEAD>The AUTHOR's Advertisment.</HEAD>
<P>NO Man doubts that <HI>Paris</HI> is at present one of the greatest and fairest Cities of the World; the magnificence of her Buildings, her extent, and the almost infinite number of her Inha∣bitants; among whom there are those who for Estates may compare with some Sove∣reigns; and in sine, the perpetual Concourse of all Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> who come hither with an extream Affection to study the <HI>French</HI> Behaviour, and observe the Rarities of the Place: All these things concur to make it to be consider'd as a City that has no equal. Yet it happens very often, that all its true Beauties are not taken notice of by many persons, and principally the Strangers, who complain that they can never find them out without making it their particular study, and giving themselves a vast trouble in the search, no Description having been hitherto Composed to instruct them in their Enqui∣ries.
<PB REF="5"/>
It is for their assistance, and to sa∣tisfie the Curiosity of Strangers that I have undertaken to describe, by way of Abridg∣ment, the most noted Beauties of that fa∣mous City. This Description will be the more useful unto them, in regard they may inform themselves of the several Places here noted, and may view several Things which they would have past by and neglect∣ed, if they had not been admonish'd of them before hand. To make this work the more easie and methodical, I have taken the se∣veral Quarters and Streets in order, as far as possible, that so the several Remarks may be seen as they lye.</P>
<P>I undertake not to make an exact descri∣ption, that were almost impossible to be ef∣fected, what endeavours soever we make. I have therefore only collected those things which are most observable, and that which deserves to be seen with somewhat more than ordinary remark: Nor have I designed to search into Antiquities; for <HI>Giles Coro∣zet,</HI> Father <HI>Breüil,</HI> and some others have done that already, better than any can hope to do it after them; and to them I refer such as desire to know the Originals and Foundations of places. Those Authors will acquaint you with the Epitaphs and Hi∣stories of Private Persons, which would have
<PB REF="5"/>
swelled this Volume considerably, if I should have transcribed them here. Besides, it seems unnecessary for a Strangers knowledge to consider these things which serve only as private Monuments, and are of no use to the publick History, for which they Travel. They take more delight, without doubt, in the description of a Cabinet, a Library, or an Apartment built after the modern way, than in reading the Epitaphs at <HI>Saint Inno∣cents,</HI> or to pick out the meaning of them.</P>
<P>Without question some will be surprized to see me undertake a Work so difficult as this, in sight of so many learned Persons abounding in <HI>Paris.</HI> But after all, if I prove not successful herein, yet however I shall esteem it sufficient glory, if I may in∣spire into any able Author the design of a Work which may in some sort answer to the Reputation of this great City.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as I may hereafter inform my self more particularly of some things which I have not hitherto been able to discover; at the same time I shall be much obliged to those, who have any parti∣cular Memorials, if they will be so generous to communicate, and thereof advertize the Bookseller who Prints this, that so they may be consulted if they please.</P>

<HEAD>A New DESCRIPTION OF The most Remarkable things IN THE CITY OF PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I enter upon the matter, it may not be amiss to say something of the Original of <HI>Paris.</HI> If this great City be not one of the Ancient∣est in <HI>Europe,</HI> yet at least she may boast, that <HI>Caesar</HI> speaks advantagiously of her in the sixth Book of his Commentaries; where he says, that having subdued divers Nations amongst the <HI>Gauls,</HI> he was forced to lay Siege to <HI>Paris,</HI> which at that time was wholly enclosed between the two
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
Arms of the <HI>Seine,</HI> into which place all the In∣habitants of the Neighbouring Country were re∣tired. Here they defended themselves with so much resolution, and made so stout a Resistance that he was constrained to draw together all the Force he could to attack and fight them. It is true he subdued them, but it was not with∣out much Labour, and after several bloody Fights; and in fine, to reduce them entirely to his Obe∣dience and to keep 'em so, he built the <HI>Great Châtelet,</HI> and placed in it a strong Garrison. Not∣withstanding we read in other Historians, that <HI>Ju∣lian</HI> the <HI>Apostate</HI> being retired among the <HI>Cauls</HI> (where he remain'd a long time in that part of <HI>Pa∣ris</HI> which is now call'd the <HI>Hôtel de Cluny)</HI> he built this Fortress, as a Check upon the People of those Parts who were very uneasie and apt to rise: after all we must confess there is no great certainty of these things, by reason of the Ignorance of those Ages that went before us, which have lost or de∣stroy'd those Memorials which should have infor∣med us of the truth, had they been now in being.</P>
<P>As to the name of this Town; some say it was called <HI>Lutetia</HI> from King <HI>Luous,</HI> who was of great esteem among the ancient <HI>Gauls;</HI> others, from the Latin word <HI>Lutum</HI> which signisies Dirt and Mud; possibly because its Situation, being between the two Arms of a River, there was con∣tinually plenty of Water and Dirt. And without doubt it is for this reason that the little space of Ground which lies at the further end of the <HI>Petit Pont,</HI> between the new street of <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> and the Street <HI>de la Calande,</HI> is at this day still called <HI>le Marchè palud.</HI> Other Authors say, that the name <HI>Paris</HI> might well have been derived from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which signifies Near,
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
and from the Goddess <HI>Isis</HI> who had formerly a Temple in that place where stands at present the Church of St. <HI>Germain des prez;</HI> from which place <HI>Paris</HI> was not far distant. And the Village of <HI>Issy</HI> near to <HI>Vaugerard</HI> might perhaps have also taken name from her, that Goddess having had a Temple there, serv'd by certain Priests, for whose maintenance the Lands that lay about that place were appropriated; which Lands belong at present to the Abbey of St. <HI>Geneviéve du Mont.</HI> In the mean time <HI>Isis</HI> was not the only Deity that was Worshipp'd about <HI>Paris, Cybele</HI> had also her Temples there. To maintain which conjecture we may here take notice of the Discovery which was made some years past in the Garden of <HI>Mon∣sieur Berrier,</HI> in the Street called <HI>Coquilliere</HI> not far from the Church of St. <HI>Eustache.</HI> As they were digging there deeper than ordinary to make the foundation of a Wall, they discovered the ruins of an old Tower, with a Bust of Brass, represent∣ing a Womans head something bigger than the Lise, and Crowned with a Castle composed of four Towers, with the ancient sort of Pinacles in such manner as we see 'em in the old Bass reliefs of <HI>Rome,</HI> or upon Medals representing the God∣dess <HI>Cybele</HI> who was invoked for the fruitsulness of the Earth, and whom the Poets called <HI>Turrita Mater.</HI> All Antiquaries who saw this Piece did not in the least question its Antiquity. Among others the Reverend Father <HI>du Moulinet</HI> one of the Learnedst Men of the Kingdom in these things, has printed a small Tract to prove that this head might have serv'd in some Temple built in this place where this Goddess was adored. And even in the Library of S. <HI>Geneviéve</HI> they preserve a Model of this Head taken off in Plaister with all the ex∣actness
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
that could be from the Original, which is at present in the Cabinet of <HI>Monsieur</HI> the Pro∣cureur-General <HI>de Harlay,</HI> which illustrious Ma∣gistrate is perfectly acquainted with the true value of such curious things. There are other Etymo∣logies beside these, as that of <HI>Paris</HI> King of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> whose dominion extended round about these parts, from whence it comes as some say, that the Inhabitants of the Neigbouring Villages were called <HI>Parisii</HI> or <HI>Parisiaci.</HI></P>
<P>It would be tedious to speak of the several en∣largements of this Town. It is easily concluded that it was not always of the fame dimensions as it is at present. Under the Reign of <HI>Clouis</HI> it was as yet shut up within the two Arms of the <HI>Seine,</HI> that is, that it took up no more ground than the <HI>Isle du Palais,</HI> which is that part which at pre∣sent we call the City, with some few houses on the Bank of the River next St. <HI>Germain l'Aux∣erois;</HI> where was at that time a Wood called <HI>la Forest des Charbonniers.</HI> But however tho it was then but very little, it was considered as a Place of very great importance, since in that par∣tition which the Sons of <HI>Clouis</HI> made of the King∣dom, they agreed among themselves that <HI>Paris</HI> should remain neuter and belong to neither of the four; further, that if any of them should enter there without permission of the other three, he should lose all the part which he might other∣wise pretend to.</P>
<P>Under the second Race, the Town became a little more considerable: they began then to build on both sides of the <HI>Seine:</HI> all about the Church of St. <HI>Geniviéve,</HI> which <HI>Clouis</HI> had raised: at the upper end of the <HI>Place-Maubert;</HI> where after∣wards <HI>Charlemagne</HI> did dispose the Learned Men
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
which he invited hither out of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> near St. <HI>Martins des Champs;</HI> and in divers other places in the Fields about the Town.</P>
<P>But under the third Race it was much more in∣creased. <HI>Philip Augustus</HI> caused it to be paved throughout, and a certain Financier (or Exche∣quer-Officer) called <HI>Girard de Poussy</HI> gave to this use out of his own proper Revenue 11000 Marks of Silver, and this he did freely without any constraint from the King, in whose Service he had doubtless attained this great Sum. This was an Example of Generosity altogether extra∣ordinary; and was done in the year 1185. as <HI>Monsieur de Mezeray</HI> tells us in his History of <HI>France.</HI> This King also caused the several Quar∣ters to be enclosed with Walls. Those of the Uni∣versity extended from the edge of the <HI>Seine</HI> be∣ginning at the Gate of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> or the Gate of the <HI>Tournelle,</HI> and so up behind St. <HI>Geniviéve</HI> to the Gate of St. <HI>James,</HI> and then down again to∣wards the River to the place where stands at pre∣sent the Colledge of the four Nations, and where heretofore was the Gate of <HI>Nesle</HI> taken down not long since to enlarge the Place. On the <HI>North</HI> side of the River it was also enclosed with Walls which had almost the same extent. There was in former times a Gate near the place where now stands the <HI>Quinze-Vingts,</HI> which answered to an∣other called the <HI>Porte-neuve,</HI> (or <HI>New-gate)</HI> on the Bank of the River pulled down some years ago, near which was a very high Tower: another Gate in the Street <HI>Coquilliere,</HI> at the end of the Street <HI>Grenelle:</HI> another in the Street of St. Denis, near the Fountain <HI>de la Reine,</HI> which was called the Painters Gate: another in the Street of S. <HI>Mar∣tin,</HI> at the end of the Street <HI>aux Ours:</HI> and an∣other
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
near S. <HI>Johns</HI> Church-yard which was called the <HI>Porte Bodais,</HI> because it led to the <HI>Château</HI> or Castle of that name, which stood in that place where now is the Village of St. <HI>Maur des Fossez</HI> beyond <HI>Charenton.</HI> Since those times this great City is much augmented, and continually extend∣ed into the Fields, till not long since for several weighty Considerations, there have been certain Bounds prescribed, beyond which it is not lawful to raise any buildings. It is to be observed that <HI>Paris</HI> being thus bounded, its extent is the more considerable, in regard there is not to be found in it any place that is not extreme full of People, and as thick of Houses as can be contrived, in some of which there are continually several di∣stinct Families in one house, which is rarely to be seen in other Towns, where every one desires to dwell apart, and where there are few houses to be found of seven Stories high, as they are all about the <HI>Palais;</HI> near the great <HI>Chatelet;</HI> and round the place called <HI>la Halle;</HI> in which Houses the least Rooms are full of Inhabitants and let out at dear Rates.</P>
<P>This is all that we shall say of <HI>Paris</HI> in Gene∣ral▪ Let us now come to particulars.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The LOƲVRE.</HEAD>
<P>Historians say that this Palace was first found∣ed by <HI>Philip Augustus</HI> in the year 1214. Who made the great Tower, in which <HI>Ferrand</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders</HI> was kept Prisoner after that King had won the famous Battel of <HI>Bouvines;</HI> in which the Earl who had Revolted from King <HI>Philip</HI> was made a Captive. This Tower was standing in
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
the last Age, and had served not only to keep the Kings Treasure, but also had been built to receive therein the Homage and Oath of Fidelity of those who held Lands of the Crown; or rather, as one may presume, it was the <HI>Seige Seigneurial</HI> (or Head of a Tenure) upon which several <HI>Fiefs</HI> did depend. For it is well known that our Ancestors had a custom always to build in their <HI>Châteaux</HI> (or Chief Seats) a great Tower, and to raise up∣on that another lesser, which they called the <HI>Don∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> this they esteemed the Mark of a Seigneurie; and without doubt this Tower at the <HI>Louvre</HI> was of the same nature. It was taken down when <HI>Francis</HI> the First began that building which at present is called the old <HI>Louvre.</HI> But Death hin∣dred that Prince from performing much of what he intended. <HI>Henry</HI> the Second his Son, carried on the building after the designs of his Father, and for the performance he made use of the Ab∣bot of <HI>Clugny,</HI> and <HI>John Gougeon,</HI> both <HI>Parisi∣ans</HI> and the ablest Architects of their Time, since those few things which we see of theirs pass for the most regular and finest Architecture of the World. They were preferred to the illustrious <HI>Sebastian Sorlio,</HI> who was expresly sent for from <HI>Italy,</HI> but had the displeasure to see his designs not followed. In the Hall of the hundred <HI>Swisses</HI> we see a kind of Tribune of the Workmanship of this <HI>John Gougeon,</HI> it is supported by four <HI>Caria∣tides,</HI> of a Design so regular and so well contri∣ved that <HI>M. Perrault</HI> of the Royal Academy of Sciences hath caused it to be engraved and inserted in the Translation of the Works of <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> where he hath proposed it as a compleat Model. The following Inscription <HI>Henry</HI> II. set over one of the Gates.</P>

<Q>This being ruined by Age, and begun to be repaired by <HI>Francis I.</HI> the most Christian King: <HI>Henry II.</HI> The most Christian King, as a pious Son who was mindful of the de∣sign of his dead Father, caused to be fini∣shed, in the year from the Redemption of the World, <HI>MDXXXXVIII.</HI></Q>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> the 13th. whose Designs were always Great and Magnificent, caused to be built the Great <HI>Pavilion</HI> which is over the Entrance. The <HI>Sieur Mercier</HI> had the charge of that work, in which he followed the first design and form. But being forced to raise his Work higher than the Bo∣dy of the Building, upon the <HI>Corinthian</HI> and Composite orders, he added a <HI>Cariatide</HI> Order in imitation of that in the Hall of the 100: <HI>Swisses</HI> aforementioned, upon which he placed a double Fronton. The old Gate of the Louvre is under this Pavillion, the Roof of which is supported by two Ranks of <HI>Ionick</HI> Pillars of one piece, pla∣ced two and two, and are extreme remarkable for their bigness. The Court in the middle of this building is great and exactly square. The King hath raised three Wings which are not yet finished. The Work consists of three Ranks of Pillars, Corinthian and Composite; the top is in the manner of a Terrasse, which appears of a Beauty most magnificently surprising. The great
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Gate is on that side next to St. <HI>Germain l'Auxer∣rois</HI> placed in the middle of a long Façade (or Front of Building) adorn'd with Corinthian Pil∣lars two and two of a most beautiful greatness, which standing off from the rest of the Work make a great Portico on each side of the Gate, on which stands the Fronton composed only of two Stones, of one piece, each of which is fifty foot in length; a great Terrasse runs on the top of this Façade, from which one may discover all <HI>Paris.</HI> In the old <HI>Louvre,</HI> many things are to be seen.</P>

<HEAD>The Cabinet of Pictures.</HEAD>
<P>The place where the Kings Pictures are kept, is in an Apartment near the end of the great Gal∣lery. It is difficult to find more in number or more rare pieces in any part of <HI>Europe</HI> than are in this place. Here are some of all the most fa∣mous Masters of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> and other parts; all which the King hath caused to be gra∣ved, of which there are two great Volumes ex∣tant; but of late years they have removed a great part of these Paintings to <HI>Versailles</HI> to adorn that magnisick Palace. Yet there still remain several of diverse Masters, among others the last Supper of <HI>Paul Veronnese,</HI> a Picture of an extraordina∣ry greatness, so are the Battels of Monsieur <HI>l' Brun,</HI> from which they have made several Pieces of cu∣rious Tapestry. The Paintings of <HI>Pousin</HI> are here preserved with care, as are also those of several other French Masters, of which he is the Chief without dispute.</P>

They are continually working in Sculpture in two several places of the Louvre. <HI>M. Girardon</HI> hath his Work-house under the Cabinet of Pi∣ctures where you may see some Statues which he hath finished for <HI>Versailles,</HI> those that are in the <HI>Grotto</HI> there, were made in this place; here you may see the Model of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu</HI>'s Tomb, which is to be erected in the Church of the <HI>Sor∣bonne.</HI></P>
<P>At the end of the Court that lies before the Gate under the Pavillion on that side next the <HI>Ruë Saint Honorè,</HI> you ought to view the Sta∣tues which are to be placed on the Tomb of Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> which the King hath caused to be erected for him at St. <HI>Denys.</HI> You may also there observe several other curious pieces, which are all of the design and invention of Mon∣sieur <HI>de Mercy</HI> one of the best Statuaries of the Kingdom. He is at present about certain figures intended for the Tomb of Monsieur the Duke of <HI>Noailles</HI> at St. <HI>Pauls.</HI> The Sieur <HI>Renaudin</HI> hath also his Work-house near that of M. <HI>Girardon,</HI> which ought to be seen by the Curious.</P>
<P>But above all we ought not to neglect before we leave the Louvre to visit the Hall, wherein the Gentlemen of the <HI>French</HI> Academy assemble, whom the King honours with so particular a Pro∣tection, that he is willing to have them in his own Palace. This Illustrious Academy is com∣posed of learned Persons who take continual pains in perfecting the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, and meet three times a Week.

<P>Every other year on the Feast-day of S. <HI>Lewis,</HI> they give here two Medals of Gold, for Prizes, the one in Eloquence, the other in Poetry, on which account a great number of Persons at such times bring in their Compositions in both kinds, in order to obtain the Reward. The same day all the Members of the Academy procure a Mass to be sung in Musick, after which a Panegyrick of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> is pronounced by some able Preacher. Monsieur the Abbot <HI>Pelisson</HI> has composed the History of the French Academy, and writ it af∣ter such a polite and delightsom manner, that his Book passes for one of the finest and best things in the <HI>French</HI> Language. They have some Pi∣ctures in their Hall; one of the Holy Virgin; another of the King in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oronation habit; the Picture of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu</HI> Founder of the

French Academy, that of the Chancellor <HI>Seguier</HI> who after the death of the Cardinal became its Protector, and in fine, another of Queen <HI>Chri∣stina</HI> of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> who came to these Assem∣blies, where she shewed her extraordinary Genius for all curious things.</P>
<P>We cross over here and pass into a Hall where we may see two Models made for the great Stair∣case of the Louvre, the fairest of which was made by the famous <HI>Mansard,</HI> the other by M. <HI>du Veau,</HI> he who made the designs for the New Buildings at <HI>Vin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ennes,</HI> but the first of these excells the other infinitely for the Grandeur of the gust and hardiness of design.</P>
<P>In the old Tenis-Conrt, in the middle of the Court they are at work about the Model of a Sta∣tue of the King on Horseback, raised on the top of a Rock with his Enemies subdued at his feet, and four Rivers with their Urns who seem ama∣zed to see this great Monarch arrived to the highest step of Glory. Nothing can be greater than this Work; and if it be performed according to the de∣sign, all <HI>Europe</HI> cannot shew a more magnisick Monument. It is of M. <HI>Girardons</HI> designing.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Gard-Meuble</HI> or Repository of the Kings Moveables.</HEAD>
<P>On the Bank of the River at the Corner of the Street <HI>des Poulies</HI> is the <HI>Garde-Meuble</HI> in an Old house which was formerly called the <HI>Hôrel du pe∣tit Bourbon,</HI> in regard the Princes of that Family dwelt there. The outside has no fine shew, but
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
it is within this place that they preserve the preci∣ous moveables of the Crown; here one may see a Surprizing quantiy of Tapestry both anci∣ent and Modern, here are some pieces which <HI>Francis</HI> I. caused to be made after the Designs of <HI>Julio Romano,</HI> and which were wrought at <HI>Anuers</HI> by a famous Master of that time who had an extraordinary Reputation. These pieces re∣present the Acts of the Apostles, and the History of <HI>Scipio</HI> the Great. This King hath caused a∣bundance to be made at the <HI>Gobelins,</HI> enriched with Gold and Silver, after the designs of M. <HI>le Brun,</HI> of which he hath no less than 24000 Ells; not reckoning a great Footcloath in the manner of Turky-work, which is working in a place built on purpose at the end of the <HI>Cours d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> la Reine,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Savonnerie,</HI> which is to be the full length of the great Gallery of the Louvre, but is not yet finisht. Together with these you may see abundance of Vessels of Precious Stones, as Agat, Onix, Jacinth, Cornelian, Christal of the Rock, admirable as well for their Size as Workmanship, several Branches of Coral, but one among the rest very great, and black as Ebo∣ny, which is extremely rare: Small Cabinets of Chrystal of the Rock, and of Amber garnished with Gold and Jewels. But that which is most observable is a great Ship of Gold inriched with Diamonds, of most curious Workmanship, made by the <HI>Sieur Balin,</HI> and valued at one hun∣dred thousand Crowns. After this you may see the Vessels of Massie Silver consisting of divers Basons, upon which the History of this King is cut in Chis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l-work, they are of such weight, that it requires the strength of two men to bear 'em upon a kind of Handbarrows made of the same
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
metal and workmanship. Here are also Tables, Stands, Looking-glass Frames, Branches for Can∣dles, extraordinary great, Orangers, two great Tubs of Silver which served at the Baptism of Monseigneur the Dauphin, Branches to set upon Stands, Chenets, Cassolets or perfuming-pots, and generally all Sorts of Goldsmiths work for their weight as well as workmanship to be admi∣red; most of which things were wrought by the famous Monsieur <HI>Balin,</HI> of whom I have alrea∣dy made some mention. He was the chief Artist of this Age for Silver Work, and died about five or six years since. They shew here also Embroi∣dered Beds, extreme Rich, with Hangings for Alcoues of the same fashion. You may see in the same place the Cup-board of <HI>Francis</HI> I. of certain pieces of Silver gilt, very well wrought. In another Room, apart, they preserve a great quantity of curious Arms of all sorts, among others the Armour of <HI>Francis</HI> I. which he wore at the Battel of <HI>Pavie,</HI> where one may discern on the cuirasse the Blows which he received before he would yield himself a Prisoner to the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> to whom he dearly sold his Liberty. There is also a Fusil or small Gun which the City of <HI>Paris</HI> presented to Monseigneur the Dauphin, and which is here preserved because it was the first Fire-Arms he ever shot in. In fine, the Curious, and all others, may here find rarities enough to satisfie their eye, for beside the singular Beauty of the Work, one may here see a mighty quantity of Gold and Silver, which is a very great entertainment to such who are apt to be dazled with the Splen∣dor of the metal and consider that, more than the excellency of the Work. Of late the King hath caused the finest things in the <HI>Garde-Meuble</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
to be removed to <HI>Versailles,</HI> yet still there remains a great number that are well worth see∣ing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Palace of the <HI>Tuilleries.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Having seen these things you ought to go next to the Palace of the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> which extends it self along the Garden in one continued Line; it is composed at the ends of two great square Pa∣vilions adorned with Pilasters of the Composite Order, and of one great Pavilion, like a Dome, in the middle, under which is the great Hall and Stair-case that leads to the Apartments. It is to be observed that the middle of this Building, namely the great Pavilion, the two Terrasses, and the two lesser Pavilions at the Ends, were built at the char∣ges of <HI>Katharine de Medicis,</HI> who was very skil∣ful in Architecture, as we perceive by these Buil∣dings, which are all of a most curious proportion after the Ionick and Corinthian Orders, there are three Ranks of Pillars, with an Attick over head. For this work she employed <HI>Philibert de Lorme</HI> and <HI>John Bulan,</HI> the prime Masters of their Age. The rest of the Buildings were performed by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. who in our days hath repaired this Palace as we now see it. There stood once under the Pavilion in the middle, a great Stair-case, which was one of the finest things of its kind in the whole World, for its disposition, and for the strange boldness of the Work. Which Stair∣case was built after the designs of the foremen∣tioned <HI>Pilibert de Lorme,</HI> but of late, to the great regret of the Curious, it has been taken
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
down for the meliorating the Prospect of the <HI>Tu∣illeries</HI> to the Court, and for employing the Great Hall to the enlargement of the Kings Apartment. Which Apartment, as also that of the Queen, and that of Monseigneur the Dauphin are enrich'd with excellent Paintings of the ablest Masters of <HI>France.</HI> In a Gallery which reaches the whole length of the Kings Apartment on the Court-side, you may see several Cabinets enrich'd with Migna∣tures and Chissel-work extremely fine, with seve∣ral Tables of inlaid Stone-work very beautiful, among others one very large, upon which is the representation of a Salamander, which was the device of <HI>Francis</HI> I. and therefore this is suppo∣sed to have been his Table. Here are also some of <HI>Sicilian</HI> Marble of one Piece, of a wonderful variety of Colours. This Gallery hath often ser∣ved for the Reception and Audience of Ambassa∣dors, and at such times it hath been adorn'd with Rich Tapistry and other precious moveables.</P>
<P>In the Rooms below are preserved abundance of antient Statues, and the Bust of this King made by the Cavalier <HI>Bernin</HI> when he came from <HI>Rome</HI> to draw the Designs of the Louvre. One may see there also the Plans raised of all the strongest places of <HI>Europe,</HI> which have been drawn out with all care and exactness that is possible.</P>
<P>The other moity of the Building on that side next the <HI>Rüe St. Honorè</HI> contains the Chappel, which is not yet finished; and the Theater, other∣wise called <HI>la Salle des Machines:</HI> in which the Court was formerly entertain'd with Comedies, of which <HI>Psyche</HI> was the last, which after it had been Acted for many years▪ did still draw a world of admirers. But since the invention of Opera's came to us from <HI>Italy,</HI> serious Playes though
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
mingled with musick and Entries of Ballets have given place to Song and continued Musick on whatsoever Subject it be. This Theatre, with∣out contradiction, is the most magnifick of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> not excepting that of the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> so much boasted of. One cannot desire any thing to be better contrived. Every Person may see and hear extreme conveniently. The Room be∣hind the Stage for the Machines is very large. As for the Decorations no Costs have been wanting, all the House is painted in Marble Colours. The Galleries are supported with Pillars whose Capi∣tals and Pedistals are gilded, as is also the Ceil∣ing which is curiously Carved.</P>
<P>The Prospect of all this Palace is into the Garden of the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> to which Garden this Palace also serves as a most Magnifick Perspective, every one of its Allies being answered with a face of the Building of most beautiful Archite∣cture. This Garden is at present one of the most regular of <HI>Europe,</HI> though it be not as yet adorned with Statues, as in time it will be. There is in it an open Theatre; with all the necessary parts thereunto belonging, as the Ancients contrived them, and which we see in those of <HI>Rome:</HI> Trees are planted here which serve in the like manner with the Ordinary Deco∣rations in other Theatres. It is extreme great and may contain a great number of People. On the other side of the great Ally stands the Statue of Truth, raised upon a great Pedestal. It is the Work of a famous Sculptor called <HI>Ville Franche,</HI> who came from <HI>Cambray.</HI> Monsieur <HI>le Nostre</HI> continued the Works in the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> and it is he also who manages those admirable Garden-Works at <HI>Versailles.</HI> You must by no means
<PB N="19" REF="15"/>
neglect to see his Cabinet which is very well fur∣nished with Pictures, and Busts of Marble, most of which came out of <HI>Italy;</HI> among others one may easily observe a Picture of indifferent size, done by <HI>Dominicain,</HI> representing <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> in the Terrestrial Paradise, this is esteemed one of the finest Pieces in all <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>We ought to observe that the old Louvre is joyned to the Palace of the <HI>Tuilleries</HI> by the great Gallery which extends it self all along the River; at the end which was begun first there are several Paintings and other Ornaments of the design of Monsieur <HI>Poussin,</HI> but they being found too small for the Place where they stand, the Work ne∣ver proceeded further but remained imperfect as it is, the beginning of this Gallery is the work of <HI>Philibert de Lorme,</HI> and the rest of <HI>Mete∣zeau,</HI> he who undertook that great service at the Ditch of <HI>Rochelle,</HI> which was the chief occasion of the taking that Rebel Town. Upon this sub∣ject the following Epigram was made in his ho∣nour,</P>

<P>The <HI>Salle des Antiques,</HI> or repository of Anti∣quities, is under the end of this Gallery, it is in∣crusted with Marble, and full of Ancient Statues,
<PB N="20" REF="16"/>
the best and scarcest that can be seen. The King has caused 'em all to be engraved by <HI>Melan.</HI> And there are two great Volumes of them extant in Folio, besides those other Pictures of which we have already spoken.</P>
<P>The Apartments under this Gallery are all in∣habited by divers famous Artists who are imploy'd in the Kings Service, and to whom he has assign'd these Lodgings.</P>
<P>The Royal Printing-house is also here, of which the Sieur <HI>Mabre-Cramoisy,</HI> is the Governor or Di∣rector: where you may see a small Room filled only with such Books as have been printed here.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Silvestre</HI> a famous Graver, Monsieur <HI>Melan</HI> of whose hand the publick has several ex∣traordinary fine Gravings, M <HI>Coepel</HI> a Painter; M. <HI>Herard,</HI> M. <HI>Valdor,</HI> are lodged here. M. <HI>Cas∣siny</HI> hath also his Chamber here thô his ordinary dwelling is at the Observatory, so hath Monsieur the Abbot <HI>Siry</HI> so well known for those curious <HI>Italian</HI> Memoires which he hath published upon History, Madamoselle <HI>Stella</HI> in whose apartment are several curious Pictures of <HI>Poussin;</HI> Monsieur <HI>Bain,</HI> a famous Enamellor, who has found out the secret to make Enamel as bright and beauti∣ful as precious stones, and who hath now under his hands, for the King, a great Bason of Gold adorned with Mouldings on the Edges, this will be without all dispute a most exquisite piece when it is finished, as well for the Workmanship as for the materials, for it amounts to an hundred thou∣sand Franks, he makes commonly Enamell'd Watch-Cases, and divers things of that sort. Near him is M. <HI>Boul</HI> who makes a sort of <HI>Mosaick</HI> works extreamly neat, and which the Curious preserve ve∣ry
<PB N="21" REF="16"/>
choicely; <HI>Messieurs Sanson,</HI> Sons of the fa∣mous Geographer have also Lodgings in this place; they are continually imployed, and from time to time publish some new thing in Geography.</P>
<P>The Kings Balaneier (or Mony-Stamp) is also kept in these parts. Here it is where they make those Curious Medals both Stamped and Cast, in Gold, Silver, and Copper. M. the Abbot <HI>Bizot,</HI> one of the most intelligent and able persons of all the Curious in <HI>Paris,</HI> had the direction formerly of these matters, after the famous <HI>Varin.</HI> One can∣not desire to see any thing more choice than his Cabinet, which is compleatly furnished with Pi∣ctures, Medals, ancient and modern, Agats, Fi∣gures in Brass, <HI>Porcelains,</HI> and a thousand other rarities of such sort.</P>
<P>The <HI>Petite Ecurie,</HI> or lesser Stable, takes up the rest of the Buildings, which is very long, and full of excellent Horses.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD><HI>St.</HI> Germain l'Auxerrois.</HEAD>
<P>Something may be said here of St. <HI>Germain l'Auxerrois,</HI> the Parish Church of the Louvre. It is one of the ancientest of <HI>Paris,</HI> for <HI>Childe∣bert</HI> was the Founder as well of this as that of St. <HI>Germain des Prez,</HI> both which he dedicated to St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> he having deposited in these Churches some Reliques of that Saint Which he brought out of <HI>Spain.</HI> They have here on great Feasts, very magnificent Ornaments given by the Queen Mother; which are of Cloath of Gold and Silver very rich: These the Republick of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣noa</HI> presented to that illustrious Queen and were
<PB N="22" REF="17"/>
by her immediately bestowed upon this Church. The other things most remarkable in this Church are, the Tribune (or Gallery) of <HI>Germain Pi∣lon</HI>'s designing, who was esteemed in his Age the ablest Workman in all <HI>France</HI> for Sculpture and Architecture, and the Chappel of Monsieur the Marquess <HI>de Rosteing,</HI> in which are some Busts in Marble of several illustrious Persons of that Fa∣mily. In the Room where the Churchwardens Assemble hangs a very good copy of a Last Supper, by <HI>Leonard de Vincy,</HI> whch Picture was former∣ly placed in the Church and its Beauty never ob∣served, till it was known that the Cavalier <HI>Ber∣nin</HI> had admired it. Upon which it was quick∣ly removed and placed in this Room, for the more choice keeping. The most considerable Persons who have been interred in this Church are Monsieur <HI>Seguin,</HI> who was Dean here, very ju∣dicious in the value of Medals: <HI>Joachim du Bel∣lay,</HI> one of the famousest Poets of his Age: Monsieur <HI>Varin,</HI> one of the ablest Gravers of Medals that <HI>France</HI> ever had; Monsieur <HI>Balin,</HI> a famous Goldsmith, of whom we have already spoken, this was he who invented those Curious Ornaments where the History of the Old and New Testament are represented in Cartouches of admirable Workmanship. Here is also the Tomb of Madamoiselle <HI>Silvestre</HI> represented in Painting on a Black Marble fixed to a Pillar behind the Quire, after Monsieur <HI>le Bruns</HI> way. In the lesser Chappels are to be seen several well esteem∣ed Pictures of <HI>le Sueur</HI>'s Work.</P>
<P>There is a Landskip in Perspective done by <HI>Francisque,</HI> worth seeing, in one of the Houses in the Cloister.</P>
<P>In that great space of Ground which is between
<PB N="23" REF="17"/>
the old Louvre and the Palace of the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> are many fair Houses, among others</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Crequi,</HI> in which lives the Illu∣strious Maréchal of that name. Its outside makes no great shew, but within it is very well funished: above all the Stair-case extremely well design'd. In the Street of St. <HI>Thomas du Louvre</HI> is</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Longueville</HI> formerly called the <HI>Hôtel de Epernon,</HI> which wants a whole wing of Building. So much as is finished is of a very beau∣tiful design, chiefly the Portal, of the <HI>Ionick</HI> Or∣der, as is all the rest of the House, which wants a Square or place before it, to give the more advan∣tagious view. The Apartments are convenient, and the Garden pleasant tho it be inclosed on eve∣ry side. You must not forget to see a Ceiling in one of the Chambers, painted by M. <HI>Mignard,</HI> high∣ly esteemed.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Turn-again</HI>-Lane near this place stands the House of M. <HI>de Guitry,</HI> which is very handsom.</P>
<P>In the same Street of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> is also the <HI>Hôtel de Montausier,</HI> formerly called the <HI>Hôtel de Ramboüillet,</HI> heretofore the most delightsom Seat of the Muses, and which still serves at this day as a Retreat and Sanctuary to all ingenious Persons by the favourable protection they find from the Duke of <HI>Montausier</HI> formerly Governor to Monsiegneur the Dauphin.</P>
<P>Having thus satisfied ones curiosity on the Sub∣ject of the <HI>Louvre,</HI> in which many particulars may be observed which are not here mentioned to avoid prolixity, let us begin our next Journey at the nearest place which is</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="24" REF="18"/>
<HEAD>The Quarter of St. <HI>Honorè.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This Quarter begins at the <HI>Rüe de</HI> St. <HI>Denis,</HI> where we may see, in the first place, a handsom row of Houses, built uniform with the same Sy∣metry, at the Charges of the Canons of St. <HI>Ger∣main l'Auxerrois,</HI> who raise out of 'em a con∣siderable Revenue. This place hath been en∣larged upon the Church-yard of the holy Inno∣cents, which lies behind. The Charnel-houses which are built round that Church-yard, were built, as reported, out of the Confiscate Goods of the Jews when they were expelled <HI>Paris</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Philip Augustus.</HI> In probability there is not any one place in the whole World in which more dead bodies are interred; which caused the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador who resided in <HI>Paris</HI> during the League, to advise the Citizens at such time when the Famine pressed them cruelly, to grind the Bones of the dead in this Church-yard to make Bread; but this Counsel was not followed com∣ing from a drolling <HI>Spaniard:</HI> M. <HI>de Mezeray,</HI> so well known of the Learned for his delicate Histo∣ry of <HI>France,</HI> is here Interred. You may see in this Place a Pyramid adorn'd with Bass-releifs, much esteemed, on the top of which is erected a Cross, this was set up in the last Age during the horrible Confusions of the League. There is in the same place a Skeleton of the Workman∣ship of <HI>Permain Philon.</HI> Further on, is</P>
<P>The Cross <HI>du Tiroüer</HI> where, as it is said, Queen <HI>Grunehault</HI> was, by the Command of <HI>Clotaire,</HI> drawn at the Tail of a Wild horse.
<PB N="25" REF="18"/>
But this is not well proved: and it is much dispu∣ted among the Historians, whether this Queen was the most illustrious, or the most wicked of her Age. For there are as many that speak well of her, as ill. St. <HI>Gregory</HI> the Great, Pope; <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> of <HI>Tours, Fortunatus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Poictiers, Paulus Aemilius, du Tillet,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> and <HI>Pasquier</HI> in his Enquiries of <HI>France,</HI> are all full of her Encomiums. Those who condemn her are <HI>Aimoin, Gaguin,</HI> Minister-general of the <HI>Mathurins, Belle-Forest, du Hail∣lant,</HI> and <HI>Vigner,</HI> whose Authorities are of great force in History. So that it will be difficult to affirm any thing positively of this great Princess, who has been more spoken of than ever any Queen of <HI>France</HI> hath been. Something lower are</P>
<P>The <HI>Fathers of the Oratory,</HI> whose house stands in the same place where formerly was the <HI>Hôtel de Bouchages.</HI> Tho their Church is not yet quite finished, it is however already extreme handsom, and of a design very Regular. They have here on their great Altar a Tabernacle of a magnifick sort of Architecture, the Pillars are of an admirable <HI>Sicilian</HI> Marble. It is a Dome raised very high with four Porticoes, supported with six Pillars of the composite order which stand out from the Work; the Ornaments of which are perfectly well wrought, and the Proportions ex∣act. A great Fabrick after this Model might well please the most difficult Persons in matters of Architecture. The Cardinal <HI>de Berulle</HI> is Inter∣red in one of the Cha pels, where his Tomb may be seen, and on it his representation in white Marble. He was their Founder, as all men know. These Fathers have a very handsom Library. The
<PB N="26" REF="19"/>
place in Truth is a little too dark; but that does not impair its value, in regard it contains a great number of excellent Volumes both Printed and Manuscript, among which are a good number of Greeks and Arabians, given them by Monsieur <HI>de Sancy,</HI> Ambassador of <HI>France</HI> to the Porte. Who during the time of his Embassie made an exact search and collection of such Greek Rarities which had scaped the Barbarity of the Turks Such a Library this could never be better disposed of than into the custody of these Fathers, there being among them some Persons of most profound Learning, as appears by their Works, so much sought after and bought up by all Scho∣lars. One might mention here Father <HI>Cointe,</HI> and Father <HI>Senault,</HI> both which have left the World such excellent Writings, the one in Histo∣ry, the other in Moral Philosophy; Father <HI>Mal∣branche</HI> who composed <HI>the Enquiry of Truth;</HI> Father <HI>Thomassin</HI> who wrote <HI>the Discipline of the Church</HI> in three Volumes in Folio; Father <HI>Dubois,</HI> who by order of Monseigneur the Arch-Bishop, is now about the Ecclesiastical History of <HI>Paris.</HI> This Congregation hath also furnished us with the ablest Preachers, as Monsieur the Bishop of <HI>Agen,</HI> so famous by the name of Father <HI>Mas∣caron,</HI> the Course of whose Sermons were most emphatical; Father <HI>le Boust,</HI> and Father <HI>Hubert</HI> who Preach'd a Lent at <HI>Nostre-Dame</HI> to a mar∣vellous concourse of People, and the last year at Court; not to mention Father <HI>Morin,</HI> and di∣vers other famous Preachers who lived not long since.</P>
<P>As you leave the Fathers of the Oratory, and pass on along the <HI>Rüe St. Honorè,</HI> you ought to visit</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="19"/>
The <HI>Palais Cardinal,</HI> which the People now call the <HI>Palais-Royal,</HI> because the King was here Educated when young. The <HI>Hôtel de Sillery</HI> stood formerly in the little Court which is before the Gate, which Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> caused to be pulled down to give the better sight to the Palace, he had then caused to be built here after the des∣signs of the Sieur <HI>Mercier,</HI> who had been esteem∣ed a very able Architect, had he raised his Build∣ings something higher; and that is the only fault of this Palace, extremely convenient in all things else. It is composed of two square Courts, of which the first and least is compassed about with Battlements, and the second is divided from the Garden by a row of Arches which support an open Gallery which reaches from one Wing to the other, through these Arches, which are in∣closed with Iron Grates you have a Prospect into the Garden, which was form'd as it is by Mon∣sieur <HI>le Nostre</HI> after the same Model with the <HI>Tuilleries.</HI> As for the Apartments they are all most beautiful and convenient, and all the Court resided here a long time during the Regency. A∣bove all, we ought to see the Gallery where Car∣dinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> caused to be painted all the famous men of <HI>France,</HI> From the time of <HI>Suger</HI> Abbot of St. <HI>Dennis,</HI> down to the time of his Ministry: That is in effect the whole French History from <HI>Lewis</HI> the young, to the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. Monsieur the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> dwells here at present, thô the House belongs to the King, to whom Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> bequeathed it in his Will, together with five hundred thousand Crowns and that Curious Suit of Tapistry which is exposed on the great Feast of <HI>Corpus Christi.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="20"/>
You must not forget to see the Cabinet of Monsieur the Chevalier <HI>de Loraine,</HI> where are curious Pictures of the best Masters, it is near the Garden which adds not a little to its beauty.</P>
<P>In a Hall belonging to this Palace is the Thea∣tre where they represent the <HI>Opera</HI> of famous M. <HI>de Lully,</HI> which draws to it continually a mighty concourse of People lovers of Musick. No part of <HI>Europe</HI> yields more pleasing Objects, be it for the Dances, or for the Symphonie, or in fine, for the singularity of the Habits; but that which is most considerable, is the wonder∣ful agreement of the <HI>French</HI> Musick with the <HI>Italian,</HI> which was once thought a thing impossi∣ble, and yet even in this M. <HI>de Lully</HI> hath been mighty successful. Nor has the Age been un∣grateful to his extraordinary Parts, for he draws a very great Revenue from the Representations of these Pieces. The Verse is ordinarily composed by Monsieur <HI>Quinault</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> Academy: Monsieur <HI>Corneille</HI> the younger hath also made some things, and <HI>Bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rophon</HI> is of his writing. From hence you go to</P>
<P>The Hospital of the <HI>Quinze-Vingts,</HI> which St. <HI>Lewis</HI> caused to be built in his time for 300 blind Gentlemen whom he brought with him out of the Holy Land where they had lost their Eyes in fighting against the <HI>Sarazens.</HI> Over the Gate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pital there stands a Statue of that Holy King which (thò of ill Workmanship) resembles him very much, as the Antiquaries pretend.</P>
<P>Further in the same Street is St. <HI>Roch</HI> the Parish Church for all this Quarter, in which there is a very exquisite Crucifix wrought by Monsieur <HI>An∣guerre.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="20"/>
A little higher stands the Convent of the <HI>Jaco∣bins,</HI> wherein is nothing very remarkable, unless it be the Library, which is one of the finest in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>After this you may take notice of the Portal before the House of Monsieur <HI>Pussort</HI> Counsellor of State, it is lately built, of the <HI>Ionick</HI> Order, with an <HI>Attick</HI> over head, in which are the Arms of the Owner. This is a small piece of Archi∣tecture, very well esteemed. The inside of the Fabrick is handsom, especially on that side next the Garden, which is very curious and pleasant. Near this on the same side is</P>
<P>The Convent of <HI>Feüillans, Henry</HI> III. first brought them out of <HI>Languedo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> in number sixty, with the blessed <HI>John de la Barr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere,</HI> Author of the Reform of St. <HI>Bernards</HI> Order. At first they were lodged at the <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s de Vin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nnes,</HI> till this house which was building for 'em should be finished. The great Gate which fronts upon the <HI>Rüe Saint Honorè,</HI> is but newly built; it is com∣posed of four <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars, that support a Fronton on which are the Arms of <HI>France.</HI> The first Court which serves as a <HI>Paruis</HI> (or open Place) before the Church, is very well; and the Building over the Gate where you enter is not ill contrived. The Portal of the Church is one of the most Regular of all <HI>Paris,</HI> and it was the first Essay of Monsieur <HI>de Mansard.</HI> Here are two Orders of Pillars, <HI>Ionick</HI> and <HI>Corinthian,</HI> fluted and set off with Ornaments. Within the Church are some Chappels handsom enough, among others that of Monsieur the Marquess of <HI>Rostaing,</HI> adorn'd almost like that at St. <HI>Ger∣main l'Auxerrois,</HI> with Pillars and Busts of Marble. On one side of the great Altar you may
<PB N="30" REF="21"/>
see a Tomb after the ancient manner. It is of white Marble, with a great Urn of the same, cu∣riously wrought; tho it has no Epitaph, yet we may conclude from the Arms in the fore part of it, that it belongs to the Illustrious House of <HI>Rohan.</HI> The Quire behind the great Altar, where the Religious Sing, is adorned with Pi∣ctures representing the Principal Actions of our Saviours Life.</P>
<P>These Fathers have very Magnisick Ornaments which with all their Plate also were given by se∣veral Persons of Quality. They have a Library, not very numerous, but however there are in it very curious Pieces. In their Cloister you will find divers Paintings representing the Life of St. <HI>Bernard</HI> their Founder. Among these Reli∣gious there are some famous Preachers. As the Reverend Father <HI>Dom. Cosme,</HI> at present Bishop of <HI>Lombez,</HI> the Reverend Father <HI>Hieresme,</HI> and some others. As you go from hence you pass before the Capuchins, where there is nothing re∣markable, and so on to</P>
<P>The Nuns <HI>of the Assumption.</HI> These Nuns had their abode formerly in the Street called <HI>Ruë de la mortellerie,</HI> where they were Hospital-Sisters under the name of <HI>Haudriettes,</HI> their House in that place having been founded by one <HI>Stephen Haudry</HI> Esquire to the King St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> to Har∣bor, and they to serve the poor and sick, as Histo∣rians tell us. But being too much straitned for Room in that street they removed to this place, where they changed their name as well as Situa∣tion. Of late years they have raised here several Noble buildings, especially their Church, which is a <HI>Dome</HI> or <HI>Cupulo</HI> after the Roman manner, very high; the inside of which is adorned with
<PB N="31" REF="21"/>
<HI>Corinthian</HI> Palasters supporting a Cornish, over which is a Row of Windows, between which hang certain pictures representing the Life of the Holy Virgin, well painted. But the <HI>Plafon</HI> (or Painting within the Ceiling) of the Dome is that which is most remarkable, it was done by M. <HI>de la Fosse,</HI> and represents the Assumption, with the Angels carrying and following the Blessed Virgin into Heaven, all which is both for the boldness of the painting, and the design, the finest that can be, and one of the most finish'd things of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Nuns Quire is very handsom, but is difficult to see, by reason of the great Grate that divides it from the Church, which Grate is no ill imitation of that at <HI>Val-de-Grace.</HI> As you go out you ought to take notice of the Portico supported by eight <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars, with a Fronton and a Cornish, the Carving Work of which is not yet finished.</P>
<P>All this Building was designed by M. <HI>Herard,</HI> director of the Academy of Painters which the King maintains at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Having seen these things you need to proceed no further this way, there being nothing consi∣derable in the <HI>Fauxburgh</HI> of St. <HI>Honorè,</HI> unless it be the Workhouse of Monsieur <HI>Anguerre,</HI> where you may see some works in Sculpture; and a young Garden or Nursery which in Spring time has very curious Flowers. This last belongs to the King, who caused it to be made here, from hence to furnish the <HI>Tuilleries</HI> with such Flowers as are needful to set of the <HI>Parterres,</HI> there is al∣so in this place a great number of <HI>Orange-Trees,</HI> well kept and preserved.</P>
<P>Over against the Nunnery of the Assumption is the <HI>Hôtel de Luxembourg,</HI> belonging to Mon∣sieur
<PB N="32" REF="22"/>
the Marechal of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> who inhabits here. The Garden is extreme pleasant.</P>
<P>Next to this are the Capuchin Nuns, founded by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in pursuance of the pious intenti∣on of <HI>Loüise de Loraine,</HI> Widow of <HI>Henry</HI> III. They live very austerely. On one side of their Gate, a Fountain has been erected on which are these two Verses of Monsieur <HI>de Santeüil.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Tot Loca Sacra inter pura est quae labitur Ʋnda,</L>
<L>Hanc non impuro, quisquis es, ore bibas.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Through Sacred Cells has this pure Wa∣ter pass'd,</L>
<L>With lips as pure do thou this Water tast.</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel</HI> of <HI>Vendôme</HI> is near this, and takes up a long Space in the Street. It was built by the Duke of <HI>Vendôme</HI> natural Son of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. who always lived here. The inside is very beau∣tiful. The Front of the great Stair-case which is of the dessigne of M. <HI>Mansard,</HI> is adorn'd with many Pillars which as you come in make a deli∣cate shew. The Garden is great but neglected as is all the rest of the House. The Duke of <HI>Ven∣dôme</HI> Governor of <HI>Provence,</HI> and Grandson of him above-mentioned lives at present in the Temple, with Monsieur the Grand Prior of <HI>France,</HI> his Brother.</P>
<P>Having thus run through the Street of St. <HI>Ho∣norè,</HI> let us now enter upon the next Quarter which is called <HI>la Butte</HI> St. <HI>Roch.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Palais Brion.</HEAD>
<P>People give it that name because the Duke of <HI>Amville</HI> Earl of <HI>Brion,</HI> for some time made his abode here. This Building is part of the Palais Royal, and was begun by the Cardinal of <HI>Riche∣lieu,</HI> who designed it for his Library. But some years since the King hath given it to two Acade∣mies, that of Painting, and that of Architecture. The first of these was established by M. <HI>des Noyers,</HI> under the direction of M. <HI>de Chambray</HI> Brother of M. <HI>de Chant-Loup,</HI> from whose pen we have several excellent pieces in print, among others, <HI>The Parallel of the Ancient and Modern Archi∣tecture, Palladio translated into French,</HI> &amp;c. This Academy was re established by Monsieur the <HI>Chancelier Seguier,</HI> after whose death that beautiful <HI>Catafalque</HI> at the Fathers of the O∣ratory, was erected to his Memory as to their Protector. Monsieur <HI>Colbert</HI> succeeded him in this Charge and in the affection he bore them. Every day here is exposed a naked man, which is the Model by which the young Scholars design, in order to attain from Nature her self the great
<PB N="34" REF="23"/>
Art of Painting, an Art that requires a most assi∣duous Study. The great Hall where they meet is full of abundance of Pictures done by the most able Masters in the Academy, and of all those pie∣ces that have been won for Prizes, which are here distributed to raise emulation among the young Artists▪, and of the Master-pieces of those who have desired to be admitted into the Academy. The Representations and Busts of several persons who have contributed to the establishment of this Academy are here also preserved. And in regard Painting is not the only thing here exercised but Sculpture also, they have got hither from <HI>Rome</HI> the models in Plaister of the most famous Statues of Antiquity, as that of <HI>Flora,</HI> of <HI>Hercules</HI> in the Palace of <HI>Farneze,</HI> of <HI>Venus,</HI> of the two <HI>Wrest∣lers,</HI> and of several others. Here are also several <HI>Bass-reliefs,</HI> and Sculptures better than ordinary. The names of those who are the present Members of this Academy are</P>

<P>In a lower Gallery they keep a many Busts and ancient Statues which the King hath sent for out of <HI>Italy.</HI> There is a very considerable number of them which are placed in Ranks one degree higher than another as in an Amphitheater; in which place there stands also a Model in Plaister of that beautiful Pillar which the Roman Senate Consecrated to the Memory of the Emperor <HI>Tra∣jan,</HI> which is the best Monument that remains of the ancient Grandeur of <HI>Rome:</HI> by this we may see the Perfection to which the Ancients had brought the Art of designing. The King caused this Model to be made at a very great expence: It hath cost near two hundred thousand Franks. <HI>Francis</HI> I. had made the same thing with a design to have raised such another Pillar at <HI>Fontainebleau;</HI> but Death preventing▪ the Stones <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay by neglect∣ed, and were after made use of to build a stable. M. <HI>Felibien</HI> hath the care and oversight of these things, to place them in their proper stations. No man understands these matters better than himself, as appears sufficiently by his Works. We shall say in its proper place how much the Learn∣ed are obliged to him for those Books with which he has enrich'd the Publick, as his Dictionary of the Arts; his lives of the Painter, which he has published in four Volumes, perfectly well writ, besides which we have hardly any thing on that Subject in our Language: with several other pieces on divers subjects of Archi tecture and Painting.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="25"/>
The other Academy established in this <HI>Palais Brion</HI> is that of Architecture, which takes up all the Apartments at the further end of the Court. This Academy the King erected in the year 1672. and placed it under the Authority of the Super∣intendant of the Buildings, of which the illustri∣ous Monsieur <HI>Blondel</HI> is the Director. Who had the honour to teach the Mathematicks to the Dauphin, of whom we shall speak more at large when we come to treat of his Cabinet. It is he also who makes the publick Lectures of Archi∣tecture in this place. The Hall where the Mem∣bers of this Academy assemble is adorned with curious designs, and one may easily distinguish from the rest, the Model which the Chevalier <HI>Bernin</HI> made of the <HI>Louvre</HI> when the King sent for him from <HI>Rome</HI> on this account.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Court is placed a Horse of Brass a little bigger than the life. This the King caused to be brought from <HI>Nancy.</HI> It stands upon a Pedestal, and remains here till it be re∣moved to some place where it may be more ex∣posed to publick View.</P>
<P>When you go from hence you ought to visit the House of Monsieur <HI>de la Fosse,</HI> who dwells cross the way: here you may see several Pieces of Painting in his way, much esteemed.</P>
<P>Observe as you go that the <HI>Rüe de Richelieu</HI> for the length, and for the beauty of the Houses, which are all built in a strait Line, is one of the most beautiful and regular Streets of <HI>Paris.</HI> It takes its name from the great Cardinal <HI>de Riche∣lieu,</HI> who during his Ministry, caused it to be considerably enlarged, and the Gate to be made at the end which leads out of Town on the side next <HI>Montmartre.</HI> In the same Street these
<PB N="40" REF="26"/>
Verses of M. <HI>de Santeüil,</HI> are engraved on a Fountain.</P>
<Q><L>Qui quondam tenuit Magnum Moder amen a qua∣rum,</L>

<P>As you go forward you come to the house of M. <HI>Mignard,</HI> who has by him many Curiosities. From thence you go to</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Jarz,</HI> so called from a Com∣mander of <HI>Malta,</HI> who bought the Ground of the Abbot of St. <HI>Victor,</HI> and built it. It is one of the best Works of Monsieur <HI>Mansard</HI> for de∣sign.</P>
<P>The Gate is a curious piece, and the Stair-case is very light, and consequently pleasant: The Apartments are large and high. But to say the Truth, they are not so convenient as beautiful. On the Garden side are contrived two small Ca∣binets (or Closets) supported with Pillars with much Art and Industry, but they are two small for the bigness of the Pillars which support them.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this is the <HI>Hôtel de Louvois:</HI> there are many things to be taken notice of in this house, but more especially the Stair-case, and the Room of Audience. As for the Apartments they are contrived to the best advantage, and no man can desire better Furniture than is seen here.
<PB N="41" REF="26"/>
Rich Tapistry, Branches for Candles, Tables, Looking-glasses of Silver, Embroidered Beds, and in fine, all that can contribute to magnificence and neatness, may be here seen, every thing in its proper place. The face of the Building on the Garden side, and that next the Court correspond and are both of a curious Symetry. You must not neglect to observe as you pass, the Locks on the doors, which are very finely wrought, and kept with such care that they shew like Silver.</P>
<P>Over against this <HI>Hôtel</HI> is a long Gallery, in which was formerly kept the Library of Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> at present in the College of the four Nations. The Stable was underneath. The Duke of <HI>Nevers</HI> uses the Chambers that are at the end, where you may see some Ceiling pieces well Painted. Of late this Gallery hath been broken through, to make room for a new street that runs cross from the <HI>Rüe Vivien</HI> to the <HI>Rüe de Richelieu,</HI> to which they have given the name of Monsieur <HI>Colbert.</HI></P>
<P>At the further end of the <HI>Rüe de Richelieu</HI> you come into the Street of S. <HI>Augustin,</HI> so called from the Religious men of that Saints Order, other∣wise called <HI>les petits Peres</HI> (the little Fathers) whose house stands at the end and takes up part of this Street.</P>
<P>In this Street are many very fair houses. About three or four years since the Sieur <HI>Douilly</HI> Receiver of the Generalty of <HI>Poitiers,</HI> built one over against the Nuns of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> on which he hath laid out one hundred thousand Crowns: there is nothing wanting but a little more Room, but it was impossi∣ble to have allotted more to the Work, it being shut up between the <HI>Petits-peres,</HI> and the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Vivien.</HI> Otherwise all is handsom. The Stair-case
<PB N="42" REF="27"/>
is very light and large, and the Gate contri∣ved after the manner of a Vault is very well pro∣portioned; I say nothing of the Moveables, for one may well conclude that a house which appears so well without, wants for no Furniture, and that the beauty within is equal to that on the out∣side.</P>
<P>In the same Street stands the <HI>Hôtel de Gra∣mont.</HI> This House hath for a long time been justly esteemed one of the fairest of <HI>Paris.</HI> It did once belong to the Sieur <HI>Monerot,</HI> who spa∣red no Cost to make it Glorious. And it still preserves its Beauty, for its Furniture is most magnificent, since it came to the Duke of <HI>Gramont.</HI> It looks towards <HI>Montmartre</HI> which renders its situation extreme pleasant.</P>
<P>Near this is the <HI>Hôtel de Grantè,</HI> not all out so magnificent, but very commodious and plea∣sant, because of its Garden which is one of the neatest of <HI>Paris,</HI> the abode of the Mareschal of that name. This <HI>Hôtel</HI> did once belong to the Sieur <HI>Thevenin,</HI> who was a very curious per∣son.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is the <HI>House of St. Cotte-Blanche.</HI> Here was formerly a very good Libra∣ry: and it was once adorned with very good Fur∣niture and curious Pictures, but its Master having changed his Fortune, all these things are now dispersed.</P>
<P>The <HI>House of M. Fremont,</HI> and several others that look upon the Fields, are not unpleasant.</P>
<P>The House of M. <HI>de Bois-Franc,</HI> Intendant of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> which is on the other side of the Street, is one of the most finished things that can be seen. The face of the Building next the Court is extreme regular, set off with a kind
<PB N="43" REF="27"/>
of Portico whose Pillars are of the <HI>Ionick</HI> Order, with Vases on the top done about with Festons and other Ornaments, all which give you a plea∣sing object as you enter. Round about the Court are Busts of Emperors placed between the Arches that support the Building. The Stair-case is very spacious, with a Balustrade of Wood painted like white Marble, and wrought with a great deal of design. The <HI>Bas-reliefs</HI> on the Doors of the se∣veral Apartments, tho they be but of Plaister, are notwithstanding very Ornamental. There is also in this House a Cabinet (or Closet) of very choice Books. As you go out you ought to ob∣serve the great Gate which is extremely well con∣trived on a very odd sort of a Foundation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Rue Vivien.</HEAD>
<P>In this Street are several great Houses. That where dwells Monsieur <HI>Desmarais,</HI> Intendant of the Finances, and Nephew of Monsieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> deserves to be viewed: but above all</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Kings Cabinet.</HEAD>
<P>The House wherein this is kept hath but a very ordinary appearance; and one would hardly be∣lieve by the outside, that it contains within so many curious things.</P>
<P>First, here is kept the Kings Library, which was heretofore at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> which <HI>Charles</HI> V. began, and which has been since much augment∣ed by <HI>Francis</HI> I. and <HI>Catherine de Medicis.</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="28"/>
But of late years it hath been made much more numerous, in regard that at present here are more than fifty thousand Volumes, among which are twelve, or fifteen thousand Manuscripts in He∣brew, Greek, Arabick, Syriack, Latin, French, and almost all Languages. As for printed Books, there is no rare piece that can be heard of▪ but you may find here a Copy. Here are several very ancient Manuscripts of St. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prian,</HI> which <HI>Cathe∣rine de Medicis</HI> brought with her, as also divers other very scarce Books, out of the famous Li∣brary of <HI>Laurence de Medicis.</HI> There are also some pieces of the History of <HI>France,</HI> which have been Collected very particularly and are kept here with great care. The Duke of <HI>Bethune,</HI> hath composed a considerable number touching the most important Negotiations which have been from the time of <HI>Francis</HI> I. to the Mini∣stry of Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu.</HI> All these Volumes are curiously bound in Turkie-Leather of a Flame-colour, gilt, and the Kings Arms on the Covers. Books of Prints have here also their proper places, of which there are here several great Volumes Collected by Monsieur the Abbot <HI>Marolles,</HI> the most curious person of his time, in these matters. The several Masters are pla∣ced in several Shelves, the <HI>Italians, Flemings,</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> so that without much trouble one may observe their peculiar ways and fancies, and how these great Masters arrived to perfection in the Art of Painting, by different Roads. Here are also several Ancient Volumes of Limnings or Miniatures, well and carefully preserved, in which one may remarque the singularity of the Habits of our Ancestors, and their odd fancies in designing; but the most
<PB N="45" REF="28"/>
beautiful things of this kind are certain Collecti∣ons of Animals and Plants, design'd upon Vellum, after the life, by Monsieur <HI>Robert,</HI> who hath la∣boured a long time to render this Work com∣pleat as we now see it. Here you may see a very great Volume in Folio, containing all sorts of Sea-Fish, this the States of <HI>Holland</HI> presented to Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> after a good Office re∣ceived from that Minister, in a long Negotiation; and after his death it was placed in this Cabinet. In fine you may view in this Library whatsoever Book you can desire upon any Subject. Monsieur the Prior of <HI>Nogent,</HI> Son to Monsieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> is the Library keeper, M▪ <HI>Carcavi</HI> is Keeper un∣der him, and M. <HI>Clement</HI> hath under him the care of placing the Books, and keeping the Cata∣logue.</P>
<P>Books are not the only Curiosity to be seen in this place. The Medals here are one of the most considerable Treasures. Here are of all sorts, Ancient and Modern, no less than twenty thou∣sand. Certainly there is not in all <HI>Italy</HI> a more considerable Collection, They are placed accor∣ding to the order of time in little Cabinets of Cedar, whose Drawers are▪ gilt and Titled neatly; The sequel of the latter Greek Empire is so compleat, that the Learned M. <HI>du Cange</HI> hath composed from hence the last Volume of his <HI>Bi∣zantine</HI> History. As for the Moderns here are all that can be met with not only of Popes, Kings, Princes of <HI>Grmany</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> but of every other Nation, even the very Jettons (or Counters) which remarque any particular event of History are here preserved. Here are also a great number of ancient Agates, among others one represent∣ing <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great Crowned with Lawrel,
<PB N="46" REF="29"/>
extremely rare for its variety of Colours, and for its bigness, besides that it was wrought in the time of that Emperour as all Antiquaries agree. Also several others representing divers matters.</P>
<P>But one of the greatest and most singular Rari∣ties of this Cabinet, in the Judgment of all men, is the Tomb of <HI>Childeric</HI> the fourth King of <HI>France,</HI> who lived in the year 458. and was the immediate Predecessor of <HI>Clouis.</HI> This Monu∣ment was discovered at <HI>Tournay</HI> in the year 1653. As certain Workmen were digging near the Ca∣thedral Church in an old Burial-place in order to lay a Foundation for a Sacristy; they first disco∣vered the skeliton of a Horses Head, and after that near the same place a long Stone in nature of a Tomb, which Stone the Workmen were fain to break before they could remove it; But they were surprised to find under it the Bones of a Man all lying in their natural and pro∣per situation. Curiosity urging them to exa∣mine this discovery still further, they found among the Bones a good quantity of Greek Medals of Gold, of the latter Empire, with a great num∣ber of Flies of the same metal, with their wings half open, and enamelled with Cornelian. The noise of this spread over the Town immediately, and the Canons of the Cathedral Church came to the place to consider what these things might discover. In fine, they still found further a kind of Clasp, a great Buckle, and an Oxes head of Gold also, which last was apparently the repre∣sentation of that Divinity which they at that time Worshiped. There was also a Sword garnished with the same metal. But that which effectually discovered this to be the Tomb of King <HI>Childe∣ric,</HI> was a Seal-Ring of Gold, on which was cut a
<PB N="47" REF="29"/>
head, with these words about it, <HI>Sigillum Chil∣derici Regis.</HI> We need not say that there was also certain Table-books, with their needle or pen, of gold, the Iron head of a Battle-axe almost consumed with rust, with a Ball of Christal solid and round like an egg which served in his Sickness to cool his mouth, or for some other use accor∣ding to the Custom of that age, now unknown. All these things were collected together with a great deal of care. And the Arch Duke who was then Governor of the Low-Countries, desi∣ring to have this precious Monument for his own Cabinet, the Canons of <HI>Turney</HI> could not refuse him; but that Prince dying, it came to the Em∣perours possession. After this the Elector of <HI>Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gne,</HI> who had used his utmost endeavours to obtain it from the Arch-Duke in his life-time, made now the same requests to the Emperour, who sent him the Monument as soon as he desired. This the Elector presented to the King, who caused it to be placed in his own Cabinet, where it is now preserved as an evidence of the high An∣tiquity of the French Monarchy, and the original of the <HI>Flowers-de-Lis,</HI> contrary to what <HI>Chiflet</HI> hath writ in his Book called <HI>Anastasis Childerici,</HI> to which Book Monsieur <HI>de St. Amant</HI> hath ex∣tremely well answered and made it apparent that those things which they found in the Tomb like Flies, were indeed <HI>Flowers-de-Lis,</HI> and not Bees, as that Author imagines.</P>
<P>Under M <HI>Carcavi,</HI> abovementioned, M. <HI>Vail∣lant</HI> is employed in keeping the Medals, who hath been several times in the <HI>Levant,</HI> to make Collections of such things. He published in La∣tin not many years since a History of the King∣dom of the <HI>Seleucides,</HI> collected from the Medals
<PB N="48" REF="30"/>
in this Cabinet, in which he has discovered his pro∣found knowledge in this Science, and hath at the same time been mighty serviceable to the Learned in explaining many things, which they would hardly have understood perfectly without his help.</P>
<P>Here you may see also over the Chimny several other Antiquities, as <HI>Lacrimatories,</HI> such as the Ancients used to gather the tears in of those that wept at Funerals and then place 'em in the Tombs; Lamps; little Idols, and abundance of such like things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Academy of Sciences,</HI> meet in this house; for whose use the King caused the Observatory to be built. The Learned Men who compose this Academy, labour continually for new Discoveries in Natural Philosopby and the Mathematicks, who being persons of extraordinary Science, the Reader will not be displeased to see their names and they are</P>

<P>From the <HI>Rüe Vivien</HI> of which we have been treating, let us now turn to the <HI>Rüe des petits Champs</HI> which lies at the end of the other. The first thing which we find remarkable in this Street as you enter from the <HI>Rüe</HI> St. <HI>Honorè,</HI> is</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="31"/>
The <HI>Hôtel de la Vrilliere,</HI> the abode of Mon∣sieur <HI>de la Vrilliere de Château Neuf,</HI> one of the four Secretaries of State. This <HI>Hôtel</HI> is one of the fairest of <HI>Paris,</HI> and best exposed to view, by reason it fronts full upon the <HI>Rüe des Fossez.</HI> The Portal is supported with Pillars of the Dorick Order, with two great Statues upon Pedestals above. The forepart of the house is in manner of a Terrase, and joyns the two Wings. The Court is exactly square; and the outside of the Buildings hath all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be desired, the Ornaments being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> exceeding just and regular proportion. For the Apartments beside their Gilding and Sculpture, they are adorn∣ed with most magn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ck Furniture, among other things one may there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e a Suit of Tapistry repre∣senting the twelve Months of the year, of a most singular design. The Gallery is full of excellent pictures, of the ablest Masters. There is one piece of <HI>Bassan</HI> highly esteemed, and admired by all the Curious. This Beautiful House is the De∣sign of <HI>Francis Mansard.</HI> Almost cross the way is</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Emery,</HI> in which Monsieur <HI>Fou∣quet</HI> dwelt for some time, and after him Monsieur the Mareschal <HI>de Turenne:</HI> It is one of the most capacious houses that you can meet with. M. <HI>Per∣rault</HI> Controller of the Buildings uses one part of it, which he has fitted up extreme neatly. Af∣ter this you come to</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Ceneterre,</HI> which hath this pe∣culiar, that it is encompassed on all sides with Streets. It is vast and Commodious, and the Garden extream pretty. The Sieur <HI>le Févre</HI> of <HI>Orleans</HI> was the Architect that built it. The Furniture is Magnifick. Going still forward in the same street you come to</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="31"/>
The <HI>Hôtel Colbert,</HI> where dwelt the deceased Monsieur <HI>Colbert</HI> Minister and Secretary of State, and Controller general of the Finances (or Reve∣nue.) There appears in this Fabrick much re∣gularity with an excellent Gust and very peculiar. The Court is square, and the Buildings about it of such a neat contrivance that you can hardly meet with the like elsewhere. The Apartments are disposed with wonderful Judgment. But that which is most observable is the Portal on the Court-side, which is formed Vault-fashion ex∣treme skilfully, with the Kings Bust in the far∣ther part of it, of Chevalier <HI>Bernini</HI>'s hand. This piece of Work is in its kind one of the best per∣formed and handsomest things that can be seen. The Library is none of the least considerable Or∣naments of this <HI>Hôtel,</HI> it is one of the fairest that we have at present, for the number of Books, but chiefly for the very considerable Manuscripts which are not to be met with else where. Among others there is a very Ancient Bible, of the time of the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Bald, with a great many Volumes of Negotiations in the time of Monsieur the Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> which take up all that end of the Gallery next the House, Mon∣sieur the Abbot <HI>Baluze</HI> is the Library-keeper, which Learned Person is so well known through all <HI>Europe</HI> that it is needless to say any thing here in his commendation. He hath published several Works which sufficiently discover his profound knowledge, among others <HI>Capitularia Regum Fancorum</HI> in three Volumes in Folio; certain Learned Dissertations on several contested Sub∣jects, and in fine, some Pieces which time had concealed, and which with great Study and pains he daily brings to light under the Title of <HI>Mis∣cellanea,</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="32"/>
to which he prefixes proper Prefaces, by which we are acquainted with the Lives and Me∣rits of the Authors. Most part of these excellent things he draws from the Manuscripts of this Li∣brary. On one side of this House lies</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Boüillon la Marq.</HI> Of late this is joyned to the <HI>Hôtel Colbert,</HI> and as it is now re-built it is much more commodious and neat than formerly.</P>
<P>The House of M. <HI>de Menars</HI> Master of Re∣quests in the Generality of <HI>Paris</HI> is in the same Row next the <HI>Rüe du Mail.</HI> You may here see the famous Library of the <HI>Messieurs de Thou.</HI> The Name of those Illustrious Persons to whom it hath belonged, cannot but raise our esteem and curiosity for such a Collection, and by the print∣ed Catalogue we may easily perceive the number and rarity of the Books. M. <HI>Quesnel</HI> who hath the care of them, hath placed them in the exact∣est order that can be desired, and this Library hath lost nothing of the Beauty and Reputation which it formerly had when it belonged to <HI>Mes∣sieurs de Thou,</HI> which makes us hope that it may also e're long be publick as it was formerly. Re∣turning again from the <HI>Rüe de petits-Champs,</HI> you go to</P>
<P>The <HI>Palais Mazarin.</HI> There is no place in <HI>Paris</HI> where you will meet with more Curiosities. or see richer Furniture than in this Palace. The front of the Building on that side next the Court is of Brick and Free-Stone, with two Statues of white Marble, which shew curiously as you enter. The Stair-case on the right hand leads to the A∣partments, composed of many Chambers whose Cielings are adorned with Gilding and Pictures of the best Masters of the Age: As for the Fur∣niture,
<PB N="53" REF="32"/>
it is in all the Rooms Magnific, and it is continually changed with the Season of the year; In one of the Chambers, all the Gold∣smiths Work, as a great Branch for lights, the Chenets, and several other things, were all de∣sign'd by the famous Cavalier <HI>Bernini,</HI> which is infinitely more esteemed by the curious than the Metal of which they are wrought. After you have gone through several Chambers on the same floor, hung with rich Tapistry heightned with Gold and Silver, you are brought into a Gallery filled on each side with Cabinets adorned with precious Stones, and Chizil-work in Gold and Silver, placed upon Tables of Marble or inlaid Stone. You see there also Vases of <HI>Jasper</HI> and <HI>Alablaster</HI> of several sizes, with little Statues in Brass of delicate Workmanship. The floor of this Gallery is covered with a Turky-work Carpet all of one piece, and of an extraordinary length. The Apartments below Stairs are no less magnific than those above. All the Rooms are full of <HI>Germain</HI> Cabinets, and <HI>China,</HI> with Trunks of <HI>Japan,</HI> wonderfully light and sweet: besides this here are abundance of Marble Statues brought out of <HI>Italy</HI> with extraordinary Cost. In one of these Rooms you may see on a Table, a small Figure of the same Piece; it is about half a foot high and represents a <HI>Cibelle</HI> holding a Book in her hand, this is mightily esteemed. In another Room near this are several great Tables of Por∣phyry and Marble; the Lower-Gallery and the Hall through which you pass to it, are also full of Busts and ancient Statues. This Galery is of the same length with that of which I have already spoke. In fine, no one place can shew us toge∣ther so great variety of curious things; Clocks,
<PB N="54" REF="33"/>
Pendulums of an extraordinary nature, Statues of Silver, and Silver gilt, with Vases of the same, and all these things very numerous. On <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> Day some of the Rich Tapistry belonging to this <HI>Hôtel</HI> is exposed to publick View, of which there is enough to hang a whole street.</P>
<P>Before the Gate they place the rich <HI>Housses,</HI> (or Trappings) embroidered with Gold and Silver, which Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> caused to be made a∣gainst the Cerimonies of the Kings Marriage; they are surprisingly magnificent. Those belong∣ing to the Mules and Led-Horses are embroidered upon red Velvet, with the Arms of the Cardinal in the middle, and several devices in the corners, with other Ornaments To conclude, one cannot express all the rich and brave things that are in this Magni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick Palace.</P>
<P>Further on, is, <HI>The House of Monsieur de Saint Poüange,</HI> which belongs at present to Monsieur <HI>de Bechamel</HI> Marquess of <HI>Nointel.</HI> This House is very well Built; the inside is extraordinary neat, and so is the Garden and Stair-case, which last are reckoned among the best of <HI>Paris.</HI> But that which is chiefly to be observed, is the excellent piece of Perspective Painted by the Sieur <HI>Rousseau</HI> on one of the Court-Walls; it is in its kind the best of the Kingdom, and one cannot meet with any thing more pleasing to the Eye than that magnifick Architecture which is there represent∣ed. You come next to</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Lionne,</HI> which the late Monsieur <HI>de Lionne,</HI> Marquess of <HI>Berni,</HI> and Secretary of State, built from the Ground, for which he em∣ployed the Sieur <HI>de Veau</HI> the Kings Architect. Monsieur the Mareschal <HI>de Villeroy,</HI> and the Duke, his Son, dwell here at present. The out∣side
<PB N="55" REF="33"/>
of this <HI>Hôtel</HI> is of a very handsom contri∣vance, set off with the Ornaments of Archite∣cture. The inward parts are extreme commodi∣ous, and the Garden which lies behind is very ad∣vantagious to its graceful View. There was a design of building a Library here, but the Ma∣sters death arriving too soon, put a stop to the performance.</P>
<P>Near this is a great House newly built at the very corner of the <HI>Rüe St. Anne,</HI> belonging to Monsieur <HI>de Grand-Maison,</HI> heretofore Trea∣surer of the Extraordinaries of War, who hath spared no cost to make it so beautiful as it is.</P>
<P>Almost exactly cross the Way is the House of the Sieur <HI>Baptist de Lully</HI> of whom we spoke when we treated of the <HI>Opera,</HI> this House is ador∣ned on the outside with great <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pilasters.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD><HI>In the</HI> Rue Sainte Anne</HEAD>
<P>Is the House called <HI>les novelles Converties,</HI> (or New Converts) built about ten or twelve years ago, with the Alms of several Persons of Quality, among others, the famous Monsieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> for the Habitation of those Families who should embrace our Religion. Their Church is but small, and there is nothing curious in it to observe.</P>
<P>The Convent <HI>des Petits-Peres</HI> stands in this quarter, at the further end of the <HI>Rüe Sainte Augustin.</HI> King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. was the Founder, and left 'em wherewithal to begin the Fabrick of their Church which is not yet finished. There is nothing observable in their house. On the

<P>In the <HI>Rüe des Fossez,</HI> which is near this, is</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Pompone,</HI> where dwells Monsieur <HI>de Pompone,</HI> formerly Secretary of State. This House was heretofore called the <HI>Hôtel de l'Hôpital,</HI> and belonged to Monsieur the Mareschal of that name. Not far from these places of which we have spoke you go to</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Soisons</HI> belonging to Madam the Princess of <HI>Carignan,</HI> and Madam the Dutchess of <HI>Nemours,</HI> Heiresses of the late Monsieur the <HI>Comte de Soissons, Lewis</HI> of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> Prince of the Blood. It was first built by <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> for her retreat after the death of <HI>Hen.</HI> II. her Husband, and here she remained a long time during her Widow-hood. The outside of this House is but mean, but the Apartments are hand∣som and extremely well furnished. The Garden is one of the greatest of <HI>Paris,</HI> and furnished with very handsom Orangers. Here is a great Pillar raised in one of the Corners of the Court, with a small Stair-case contrived within it, in imi∣tation
<PB N="57" REF="34"/>
of that of <HI>Trajan</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> Report says that this was built by <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Medicis,</HI> who had great skill in Astrology, and that she used fre∣quently to go up to the top of this Pillar to make her Observations. Joyning to the Walls of this Hotel stands the Chappel which serves only for the use of those of the Family. It is called the Queens Chappel, because it was built at the same time with the rest of the House, and <HI>Catherine de Medicis</HI> came often hither to hear Mass in publick. Near this is the Street called <HI>Rüe de Gre∣nelle</HI> in which stands</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel Seguier.</HI> This was formerly called the <HI>Hôtel de Bellegarde,</HI> it being built by the Duke of that name while he was great Master of the Horse of <HI>France</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. who imployed him in great Negotiations and sent him to <HI>Florence</HI> in order to his Marriage with <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medicis.</HI> Monsieur the Chancellor <HI>Se∣guier,</HI> when he came to dwell here enlarged it very considerably, and built that beautiful Gallery which takes up one side of the Garden. The inside is extreme handsom, and the Wain scot Work is of the best kind that one can desire to see, all is gilt and adorn'd with Pictures done by the Sieur <HI>Voëte,</HI> who had the Reputation in his time, of a good Painter. There are also some Landskips done by other good Masters, which are admira∣ble. That which was very remarkable in this Gallery during the life of Monsieur the Chancel∣lor, was a great number of <HI>Porcelain</HI> Vessels that were placed all round the Gallery upon the <HI>Cor∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> and which made the finest shew that could be.

on both sides. At the end of this Gallery you enter on the left hand into a Chamber which was richly adorned with Tapistry, where were several rich pieces of Goldsmiths work, among others, a great Frame curiously wrought in which stood the Picture of the late Monsieur the Chancellor done by M. <HI>le Brun.</HI></P>
<P>You might also have seen here a Cabinet of Ebony enriched with ancient Agates representing the Emperors heads, and in a little Cabinet near this, a great number of Animals very considera∣ble, some in Vases, and some in Pictures, wrought by the best Masters of <HI>Italy,</HI> and by those who dwelt at <HI>Limoges</HI> in the last Age. Madame the Chanceliere, who deceased not long since, had here a Cabinet of Crystal most delicately cut, with abundance of Watches and Clocks, enriched with precious stones: few Houses in <HI>Europe</HI> had a greater quantity of Silver Vessels. You might have seen here a whole Service of Silver gilt most magnificently, each piece being extraordinary both for the bigness and workmanship. But that which was the greatest Ornament of this Noble House was the numerous Libary, valued at near two hundred thousand Crowns. Which Library was first begun by Monsieur the President <HI>Seguier,</HI> and by him given in his Will to his Nephew, Monsieur the Chancellor. It was situate over the Gallery of which we have already spoken. We need not say that it was full of very curious Books, that may easily be supposed since it was collected by the ablest man of his Age, and to say all, by him whom the French Academy made choice of for their Protector after the decease of the great Cardinal <HI>de Richlieu,</HI> in whose House they al∣ways assembled till such time as the King setled
<PB N="59" REF="35"/>
them in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> where at present they re∣main. There were in this Library a great num∣ber of very rare Manuscripts, whose names we find cited by Authors who have here made use of them. We may expect one day to see a Ca∣talogue of them, which was never yet made publick. But this will not be till the Inventory be finished, and then all these choice Books which have been so long collecting together with so much pains by the greatest men of their time, shall be exposed to publick Sale, and dispersed among those who will give the prizes demanded. Such was the state of this <HI>Hôtel</HI> during the life of Monsieur the Chancellor <HI>Seguier,</HI> who held that great Office for many years with universal applause, and that during very unsetled times:</P>
<P>At the end of the <HI>Rüe de grenelle,</HI> you come into the <HI>Rüe Platriere,</HI> in which Street stand two fair Houses.</P>
<P>That of Monsieur <HI>de Bouillon,</HI> and that of the late Monsieur <HI>de Herval,</HI> Controller-Ge∣neral of the Finances. The last of these was built with much care. You may see there se∣veral good paintings of Monsieur <HI>Mignard,</HI> and a Bed with its Furniture extreme Rich. This House stands in the place where were former∣ly the Stables belonging to the <HI>Hôtel de Eper∣non.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Rüe Coquéron</HI> at the end of the <HI>Rüe du Bouloy,</HI> is</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Gesures,</HI> whose outside is neat and Furniture within very handsom. It did once belong to Monsieur <HI>de Fontenay-Mareüil,</HI> so well known for his famous Embassies, and above all for that to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="36"/>
Further on is the House of the Sieur <HI>Monginot,</HI> built but four or five years since. On which he hath made a considerable expence. It looks very great on the Court-side, and the Apartments which are disposed in <HI>enfilades</HI> (or through Pro∣spects) are magnificently furnished with Tapistry, Chenets of Silver, and all the Furniture for the Chimny of the same; In fine, all is extreme neat, and nothing seems wanting, unless it were a lit∣tle more light to the Stair-case, but as it is pla∣ced it is impossible to make it lighter.</P>

<HEAD>The Church of <HI>St. Eustache.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This Church was formerly but a small Chappel dedicated to St. <HI>Agnes,</HI> and depended upon the Chapter of St. <HI>Germain le Auxerrois.</HI> The pre∣sent Fabrick was begun to be built in the year 1521. and the first Stone was laid by the Provost of <HI>Paris,</HI> by name <HI>John de la Barre.</HI> It is at present the greatest and most spacious of the Kingdom. The Grandeur of the Building, the number of the Pillars which in truth are a little too thick crowded together, and the heighth of the Roof, with the Chappels that are round it, considered altogether, render this Edifice Maje∣stick. Among other things the two Chappels which are on each side of the great Gate ought to be observed. One of which is appropriated to Baptism, and Painted by Monsieur <HI>Mignard,</HI> the other for Marriage, and Painted By Monsieur <HI>de la Fosse:</HI> Monsieur <HI>Colbert</HI> did contribute to their decoration. In the Chappel of Marriage stands the Model of the great Portal which is to be raised before this Church, which Work will be
<PB N="61" REF="36"/>
very expensive. The Pulpit is well wrought in imitation of that at St. <HI>Estienne du Mons,</HI> but it falls short of that. Overhead is a great Picture representing the Apparition of our Lord, painted after the manner of Monsieur <HI>le Brun;</HI> this Pi∣cture was given by Monsieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> as seems by his Arms at the bottom. Adjoyning to one of the Pillars in the <HI>Nave</HI> on the left hand as you enter, you see a great <HI>Bas-relief</HI> of white Marble on a Foundation of black, which is the Epitaph of the famous Monsieur <HI>de la Chambre,</HI> so re∣nowned for his Writings, this is contrived in a <HI>Medaillon</HI> held up by Immortality, and to make her more obvious and better understood, over head is a <HI>Cartel</HI> or Scroul with these words out of the Scripture graven therein</P>
<Q>Spes illorum Immortalitate plena est.</Q>
<Q>Their Hope is full of Immortality.</Q>
<P>This curious piece is the Workmanship of the Sieur Baptist <HI>Turcy,</HI> who wrought after the de∣sign of Monsieur <HI>le Brun.</HI> The other things in this Church are of no great consideration. Mon∣sieur the Chancellor <HI>Seguier,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>de Bullion</HI> Sur-Intendant of the Finances under the Ministration of Cardinal <HI>de Richolieu,</HI> were Be∣nefactors to this Work. Monsieur <HI>de la Mothe le Vayer,</HI> formerly Tutor to Monsieur, and so well known for his rare Writings, and Monsieur the Abbot of <HI>Bourfay</HI> of the French Academy, are enterred here.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Rüe Coquilliere</HI> which is near St. <HI>Eusta∣che,</HI> stands the House of Monsieur <HI>Berrier</HI> Secretary of the Council: in whose Garden was
<PB N="62" REF="37"/>
found the Bust of <HI>Cybele,</HI> formerly▪ mentioned. The Portal, tho it makes no great shew outward∣ly, yet within it is of singular beauty, adorned with Corinthian Pilasters of an admirable Gust. The <HI>Garde des Sceaux</HI> (or Lord-Keeper of the Seals) <HI>de Chateau-neuf</HI> dwelt here.</P>
<P>These are the principal things that are to be seen in this Quarter.</P>
<P>Behind St. <HI>Eustache</HI> lies the <HI>Rüe Montmartre,</HI> near the further end of which Street stands the little Church of St. <HI>Joseph,</HI> in whose Church∣yard is interred the famous <HI>Moliere,</HI> so well known for his Comedies.</P>
<P>Near St. <HI>Eustache</HI> is the great Market called <HI>la Halle</HI> which place ought to be avoided as much as may be, because of the continual Crowd of People that frequent it. Formerly they executed the Criminals here as they do now at the <HI>Greve.</HI> And we read in the History of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. that the Provost of <HI>Paris,</HI> named <HI>Montaigu,</HI> who was also great Treasurer, had in this place by means of the Duke of <HI>Bourgoyn</HI> his head chopt off; to the great regret of the <HI>Parisians,</HI> he be∣ing a very good man. But the King abhorring this cruel Act of Injustice, which had been done in his Name during the time of his distraction, restored his Memory and Family again to their former honour; and the <HI>Celestins</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> to whom he had given his House of <HI>Marcoussy,</HI> went and took down his Body from the Gibbet at <HI>Monfaucon,</HI> four Months after his Death, and having performed his Funeral Offices in the most Magnificent manner they could, they interred his Body at <HI>Marcoussy,</HI> where they raised him a Mo∣nument, which remains at this day. This was a rare example of gratitude and generosity in
<PB N="63" REF="37"/>
Monks, as is well observed by <HI>Juvenal des Ʋrsius</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Reins,</HI> a faithful Historian of that Kings Reign.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Rüe Montorgueil</HI> is the <HI>Hôtel de Bour∣gogne;</HI> which House the ancient Dukes of that name formerly gaveto the Brotherhood of the Pas∣sion established in the Church of <HI>Trinity</HI>-Hospital in the <HI>Rüe S. Denis,</HI> on condition that they should represent here interludes of Devotion; but since those times Peoples Relish being changed, they have since represented here other Plays of Profane Subjects. And at present the <HI>Italian</HI> Comedians are possessed of this House, since the union of the two Companies of French Players, which the King caused three or four years ago. This Thea∣tre is perhaps one of the Ancientest of <HI>Europe,</HI> for it is thought that there have been publick Shows in this place six hundred years ago. In former times Comedies were only represented by wandring Companies of Pilgrims of the holy Sepulchre of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> who were since called <HI>Jongleurs.</HI> These having no certain Residence used at the corners of Streets, to relate the Adventures which they had met with in their Travels, and People being concerned at their stories, and com∣miserating the several dangers they had passed through, would give them very liberally conside∣rable Alms. The ancient Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> seeing People take some pleasure in hearing them, he gave them a Room in his <HI>Hôtel,</HI> where all people might come and hear them with better conveniency than in the Street. But in time, these Masters of devout Subjects degenerated into profane Tales, and in effect so very profane that they became meer Farces and very irregular re∣presentations. In such sort that Christianity could
<PB N="64" REF="38"/>
not honestly permit them. Thus it lasted during the ignorance of those Ages. And it was this that still gives occasion to those who do not con∣sider the difference between this ancient sort of Comedies and those now acted, to consound all together. Whereas in truth the nature of Co∣medy is so far changed, by the care of the great Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> that there remains nothing of that which made it Condemned.</P>
<P>ADjoyning to the <HI>Rüe Montorgüeil,</HI> is the <HI>Rüe Mont-martre,</HI> and divers little streets run from one to the other, the Principal of which is the <HI>Rüe de Cleri</HI> in which stands the House of M. <HI>Bertelot,</HI> Intendant of the Houshold to Madam the Dauphiness. It is composed of two joyning Courts, of a very particular design. The Furniture is very handsom.</P>
<P>Near this is another House belonging to the <HI>Sieur Rolland,</HI> built after the designs of Monsieur <HI>des Argues</HI> a famous Architect: by the outward appearance you may easily conclude that it be∣longs to one of an excellent Judgment. But the inside and the Front next the Court surpass all the rest. Nothing can be more regular nor bet∣ter proportioned than the Staircase, which is raised upon a very odd sort of Plan, and where the Ar∣chitect had need of all his Art and Study to have made it as it is.</P>
<P>This is all of note in this Quarter. Some other things there may be of which I have not spoke; but they appear of so little Consideration that they are not thought worth mentioning. In the next place we pass to</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="65" REF="38"/>
<HEAD>The <HI>Rue</HI> St. <HI>Denis.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This Street begins at the great <HI>Châtelet,</HI> which stands at the end of <HI>Pont au Change▪</HI> as we have al∣ready said. In this place the Civil and Criminal Courts are held for the City and <HI>Prevôtè</HI> (or Pro∣vostship) of <HI>Paris;</HI> which Jurisdiction is at pre∣sent divided into two parts, according to the course of the River, into the old and new <HI>Châtelet;</HI> and the Officers know their several Divisions.</P>
<P>The great Butchery, which is near the great <HI>Châtelet,</HI> is the oldest of all <HI>Paris,</HI> nay hereto∣fore it was the only one. It did heretofore be∣long to a Community of Townsmen, who made among themselves a kind of little Republick, which bore such Credit and Authority among the Inhabitants, that often times there happened great Disorders through the discontent of these People, who under the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. took part with the Factious. At present this Butchery is reunited to the rest of <HI>Paris.</HI> Further on is</P>
<P>The Hospital of the Nuns of St. <HI>Catherine,</HI> These are bound to entertain for one night such poor Maids as are in want. They are also obliged to bury the Bodies of those that are found dead in several places, and who are to be exposed some days at the <HI>Châtelet</HI> to see if they can be known.</P>
<P>Near this is the Church of St. <HI>Opportune.</HI> This was formerly a Priory of Nuns depending on the Abby of <HI>Almaneche</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> with∣in the Diocess of <HI>Seeze,</HI> but at present it is a Col∣legiate Church of eight or ten Chanons, who here perform the Ecclesiastical Offices. Going still forward, you come to</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Fountain of the Holy Innocents.</HEAD>
<P>This Fountain stands at the corner of the <HI>Rüe aux-Fers,</HI> a Street full of Mercers and Silk-men. It is the admiration of all that are skilled in Ar∣chitecture and Sculpture, and without doubt it is one of the handsomest objects in its kind that can be seen, by reason of the <HI>Basses-tailles</HI> ex∣tremely fine, both for the design and performance; most of the Figures represent Nymphs in divers Postures pouring Streams of Water out of their Urns. The Chevalier <HI>Bernin,</HI> who was of a Gust difficult enough, admired this Work, and prosessed that he had not seen any thing so fine in all <HI>France.</HI> It was made by the famous <HI>John Gougeon,</HI> who finished it in the year 1550. In the upper part you may read this Inscription</P>
<Q>Fontium Nymphis.</Q>
<Q>To the Nymphs of the Fountains.</Q>
<P>A little beyond stands the Church of the holy Sepulchre, which was first built for the Pilgrims of the Holy Sepulchre of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> who were here entertained for some days. At present it is a Collegiate-Church the Collation of whose Cha∣nons belongs to the Chapter of <HI>Nôtre-Dame.</HI> The Altar is very handsomly wrought, and the Picture over it was Monsieur <HI>Colberts</HI> gift, and Painted by Monsieur <HI>le Brun.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Leu,</HI> and St. <HI>Giles</HI> is a little further. In one of the Chappels here is interred the Mother of Monsieur the first President <HI>de La∣moignon,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="39"/>
whose Tomb of Marble is a well wrought thing and designed by Monsieur <HI>Girar∣don,</HI> on it is a Bas-relief much esteemed. The Picture over the great Altar is also highly valued, it being the work of one <HI>Porbus</HI> a famous Painter.</P>
<P>A little higher is the Hospital of St. <HI>Jacques,</HI> on the other side of the way. It was founded by the Alms of certain Citizens who obtained a Licence of <HI>Lewis Hutin</HI> in the year 1315. It was formerly appointed for the entertainment and lodging of those who passed this way in their Journey to St. <HI>James</HI> in <HI>Galicia.</HI> At present the Revenue is annexed to the <HI>Invalides.</HI></P>
<P>We say nothing of the Hospital of the Trini∣ty nor of the Church of St. <HI>Saviour,</HI> there be∣ing nothing curious in them, no more than there is in the Houses of the <HI>Penitent Nuns,</HI> and of those called <HI>Filles-Pieu</HI> which were built and endowed by St. <HI>Lewis;</HI> yet at the Church of these last you may observe the great Altar, which they have built of late after the same manner with that of St. <HI>Martin des Champs.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Kings Statue.</HEAD>
<P>In the <HI>Hôtel de St. Chaumont,</HI> where dwells Monsieur the Mareschal <HI>de la Feüillade,</HI> we ought to see the Kings Statue, which that illustrious Mareschal hath caused to be made at a great ex∣pence representing the King in a Roman Habit Crowned with Lawrel. It is about eleven or twelve foot high and but of one block of Mar∣ble, the greatest that was ever yet seen at <HI>Paris.</HI> The Pedestal on which it must be placed will be
<PB N="68" REF="40"/>
very high, and on the four sides will be several Bas-reliefs in Brass, representing the History of divers great Actions in this Kings Reign, as, the taking of <HI>Bezanzon,</HI> the famous Passage of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the general Peace of <HI>Nuneguen,</HI> and the satisfaction which <HI>Spain</HI> made to the King in the year 1661. in relation to what passed at <HI>London</HI> about Monsieur the Mareschal <HI>de Estrade</HI> at that time Ambassador from <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England.</HI> Four Captives loaden with Chains lie at the bottom on a heap of ancient Arms. But of late the design of the Statue it self hath been changed; it will be of Brass, and in that habit which he wore at his Coronation, and which is always preserved in the Treasury of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> with Immortality behind him Crowning him with Laurel. This Monument is of a design most magnifick, and the Sieur <HI>des Jardins</HI> hath continually been em∣ployed about it for above three years past. It is not yet known in what place this curious Statue will be fixed, where it may best be exposed to the publick view, and such a place is now under consideration. It is said however, that Monsieur the Mareschal <HI>de la Feüillade,</HI> who hath been at all this expence to demonstrate to Posterity the Gratitude he hath for the Kings Favours, hath very lately, for the sum of fourscore thousand Crowns, purchased the <HI>Hôtel de la Ferte-Seno∣terre,</HI> to make a Square, in the midst of which he intends to place this Statue. Monsieur <HI>de San∣teüil</HI> Chanon of St. <HI>Victor,</HI> one of the ablest Wits of this Age for Inscriptions in Verse, is now composing an Inscription for this piece which will acquaint Posterity with the Wonders of the pre∣sent Reign.</P>

And Monsieur the Abbot <HI>de Lionne,</HI> Son of the Secretary of State, is Prior hereof, which is a very considerable Revenue. Some think this house was founded by <HI>Philip</HI> the first or by his Father, King <HI>Robert,</HI> both which kept their Court in this place. But we read in some Au∣thors that there were here even at that time very ancient Buildings, and that those Kings did only repair them for their own habitation.</P>

The <HI>Gate of St. Martin,</HI> as well as the <HI>Faux∣bourg</HI> on this side of the Town, take their names from the Priory of which we have been speaking. This Gate was built in the year 1674. almost at the same time with that of St. <HI>Denis.</HI> It is a kind of Triumphal Arch, consisting of three passages, of which that in the middle is higher than the other two. The work hath about fif∣ty foot of Front, and as much in heighth, the Architecture is of that sort which is called <HI>Bos∣sage rustique,</HI> carved with Bas-reliefs over the Arches, above which is a great Cornish of the Dorick Order, and over that an Attick on which are these Inscriptions:</P>
<Q>LUDOVICO MAGNO. <LB/>

<P><HI>Besanzon</HI> and the <HI>Franch Comté</HI> being twice taken, and the Armies of the <HI>Ger∣mans, Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> being routed. The Praefect and Aediles caused this to be set up in the Year from the Redemption of the World, <HI>1674.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="77" REF="44"/>
On the side next the <HI>Faux-bourg,</HI> you may read this,</P>

<P>Who having taken <HI>Limburg,</HI> silenced every where the vain threats of his Enemies. The Praefect and Aediles caused this to be set up in the year from the Redemption of the World, <HI>1675.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Rampart that leads from this Gate to that of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> is planted with a large walk of Trees, which in some years time will make a most plea∣sing place where to take the Air. The design is to continue it round about the Town, behind the Temple and so to the <HI>Port St. Anthoine.</HI> The Work is already so far advanced that Coaches may conveniently pass from the <HI>Porte St. Denis</HI> to the <HI>Bastille.</HI> The Publick is obliged for these ad∣vantagious Works to M. <HI>Blondel</HI> who designed it thus.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Faux-bourg</HI> you may see <HI>the Church of St. Laurence,</HI> formerly an Abby of the <HI>Benedictin</HI> Order, but at present a Parochial Church, whose
<PB N="78" REF="45"/>
Parish extends a good way into the Town. The Portal of this Church is very handsom, and the Altar is of a very particular design, contrived by the Learned M. <HI>le Pautre</HI> so well known for his excellent Works in Architecture. The Orna∣ments and Statues belonging to this Church de∣serve to be well observed.</P>
<P><HI>The Fair of St. Laurence</HI> begins on the Feast day of this Saint <HI>(Aug.</HI> 10.) and usually lasts a whole Month. Not long since it was used to be held in the <HI>Faux-bourg,</HI> but the Fathers of Saint <HI>Lazare</HI> having built up in a piece of Ground be∣longing to them, certain Houses and Shops proper for this purpose, the Tradesmen found it conve∣nient to remove thither, which yields those Fathers a considerable Revenue. Over against this is</P>
<P><HI>The Convent of the Recollets</HI> a neat Place. Here you ought to see some Paintings of <HI>Father Luc,</HI> a great imitator of <HI>Raphael,</HI> among others the Picture belonging to the great Altar. Their Library is also very handsom, and the Books neatly bound.</P>
<P>Behind this Monastery stands the great Hospital of St. <HI>Lewis.</HI> It was sounded by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in the year 1607. For those who were visited with the Plague. At present the Convalescents (or those sick who are recovering) of the <HI>Hôtel-Dieu,</HI> are removed hither for some Weeks, to take the Air.</P>
<P><HI>Mont-Faucon</HI> is in the adjoyning Fields. This was formerly the place where they Executed Ma∣lefactors, but serves at present for their Burying∣place.</P>
<P>After we have gone thus far, we ought to re∣turn again, and enter the Town at the nearest Quarter.</P>

<PB N="79" REF="45"/>
<HEAD>The Rue St. Avoye.</HEAD>
<P>Saint <HI>Lewis</HI> whose Piety was resplendent in all things, built in this Street an Hospital for old de∣crepid Women, who were attended by <HI>Beguines</HI> or Maids who observed the Rule of St. <HI>Begue</HI> a Native of <HI>Flanders,</HI> whose Church being dedi∣cated to St <HI>Avoye,</HI> this Street took the same name, and hath kept it notwithstanding the alte¦ration of the Hospital which hath been since con∣verted to a Monastery of Nuns of the Order of St. <HI>Augustin.</HI></P>
<P>Before you enter into this Street you ought to visit <HI>the fair House of the Sieur Jaba</HI> in the <HI>Rue de St. Mederic.</HI> It is very regularly built, the front on that side next the Court is adorned with Pilasters, and the Gate is in Bossage with Sculp∣tures, which make a very handsom shew. The inside is after the same manner; and this house being taken all together, may pass for one of the handsomest that we can see. Here are some very good Pictures. And the Master knows such as well as any in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we pass into the <HI>Rüe St. Avoye,</HI> where in the first place you come to the House of the Sieur <HI>Titon,</HI> neatly built.</P>
<P>A little higher and near the Fountain, in a House at present belonging to M. <HI>de Marillac,</HI> which promises no great matters by the outside, you ought to see the Stair case, the only thing in all the house that deserves your particular obser∣vation. If you examine it as you ought, you will find that there can be nothing imagined finer, and that the disposition is extreme singular. All
<PB N="80" REF="46"/>
the Curious do agree that there are but few things in <HI>Paris</HI> that come near it, and tho it be but of Plaster, it notwithstanding excells those which have been built with much care, and richer Mate∣rials.</P>
<P>Further on the same side of the Way is the <HI>Hô∣tel de Montmorency,</HI> which still keeps the name of those illustrious Masters to whom it formerly belonged. Here lives at present Monsieur the President <HI>de Mesmes.</HI> Tho the outside be <HI>Go∣thick,</HI> yet the apartments both above stairs and below, are of a very handsom disposition, the Rooms are <HI>en enfilade,</HI> and look upon the Gar∣den; here is also one of the best furnished Libra∣ries. And really this house hath some delights which you will hardly meet with elsewhere.</P>
<P>Cross the way is the <HI>Hôtel de Avaux,</HI> built by the deceased Monsieur the <HI>Comte de Avaux,</HI> so well known for those famous Embassies in which he was formerly employed. The Building is great and raised with magnificence. The Court is exactly square, enclosed with four Wings of Building adorned with great Corinthian Pilasters, reaching from the ground to the top of the Edi∣fice, which makes the fairest and the greatest ob∣ject one can desire; as you come in you see into the Garden through the doors, quite cross the house.</P>
<P>Passing still further, in the <HI>Rüe Michel le Compte,</HI> which lies on the left hand, dwells a Sculptor named <HI>Bertrard,</HI> in whose house you will find some pieces very well designed; he is best in Bas-reliefs of Plaster for Chimney-pieces, and he hath made some that are well esteemed. Returning again into the <HI>Rüe de St. Avoye,</HI> at the end of that Street you come to</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="81" REF="46"/>
<HEAD>The Temple.</HEAD>
<P>This old Building still keeps the name of the Knights Templers of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to whom it for∣merly belonged. It is well known what a cruel dis∣grace befel them under the reign of <HI>Philip</HI> the fair. The <HI>Croisades</HI> (or Pilgrimages to the Holy Land) being ceased, by reason of the Turks general In∣vasion in all parts of <HI>Palestine,</HI> these Knights whose Institution was to conduct the Pilgrims to the Holy Places, thought themselves excused from that Office any longer, in which there was such apparent Danger: Hereupon they amassed up vast Riches, and withal became so proud and disso∣lute, that as Historians say, Pope <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ement</HI> V. and <HI>Philip</HI> the fair agreed together to ruin and utterly abolish the whole Order, as a punishment for their Crimes and scandalous Debauchery. They began with the great Master, who with two of his Companions the most illustrious of the Order, the Pope under a specious pretext sent for out of the Isle of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> As soon as they were come to <HI>Paris</HI> they were committed to Prison, and being cruelly tortured till they confessed those in∣famous Crimes which were pretended to be pro∣ved against them, they were at last condemned to be burnt alive at the place now called the <HI>Greve.</HI></P>
<P>It is reported, but with no great assurance, that at the instant of their Execution, <HI>Molay,</HI> who was the great Master, cited the Pope and the King to appear before God in a years time. Whether this Circumstance be true or not, certain it is that the Pope died in less then forty days and the King hardly lived to the years end.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="47"/>
From that time the Temple came to the Kings possession by Confiscation, who for some time kept here their Court, but afterwards gave it to the Knights Hospitallers of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> who at last made this their Provincial House, for the French Province. Monsieur the <HI>Com∣mandeur de Vendome,</HI> is at present Grand Prior, which brings him yearly a Revenue of above 20000 Crowns. This place is very spacious, in∣closed about by ancient Walls; supported with Towers; the House which the Grand Prior inhabits, was built of late time by Monsieur <HI>de Souvray</HI> Grand Prior also; he was Son of the Mareschal <HI>de Souvray,</HI> Governor to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. But death prevented him from compleating the Edifice; so much as is done is of the design of the Sieur <HI>de Lisle,</HI> an able Architect, who had built quite round the Court, and made a Gallery sup∣ported by Pillars, of which we see the beginning, had the Master lived; the Lodgings are at the further end of this Court, with two Stair-cases in the two Pavilions of the two Wings. All these things are of a very handsom Symmetry.</P>
<P>Within the inclosure of the Temple you ought to see the house of Monsieur <HI>Fremont de Ablan∣cour,</HI> a Jeweller. Formerly there were many Jewellers who inhabited in this place, and made counterfeit Jewels very neatly, but of late years they have not been admitted to be here any lon∣ger. Yet it is still to be observed that all the Artists who work here are exempt from the Ju∣risdiction of the City Companies. And this is the reason that abundance of People who are no Free men and have not served their time, take refuge within the Privilege of this Place. Over the way is the Monastery of</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="47"/>
The <HI>Nuns of St. Elizabeth.</HI> Whose Portal hath two rows of Pilasters, with Statues and other Ornaments well contrived. The inside of the Church is very well.</P>
<P>The Gate that leads into the Fields on this side the Town is taken down, and there is no doubt but another will be raised in the place, as handsom as the rest which have been new built elsewhere.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Rue du Grand Chantier.</HEAD>
<P>To see this Street in Order you ought to begin at the little <HI>Rüe des Deux Portes,</HI> in which you will see a new-built house, belonging to the <HI>Sieur Provost</HI> one of the Kings Secretaries, who has be∣stowed a great deal of Care and Charges to make it so handsom as it is, in one of the vilest places in all <HI>Paris.</HI> On the Court-side it is adorned with Ionick Pilasters, and Sculpture well per∣formed. The Stair-case (which stands in the middle of the Building, is) as light as it can be according to its Situation. But that which is most singular, and the handsomest thing in the house, is a great Closet, the Wainscot of which is set off with Pilasters gilt, the Pannels between which, are of inlaid Work, representing Vases full of Flowers, and which is still more ob∣servable the Cieling piece and the Parquet are of the same workmanship. All these pieces appear so much the finer as they are the scarcer to be met with, they being almost the only things of this kind in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>In the Street at the end of this you have the House called <HI>Les Billetes.</HI> Here formerly dwelt a
<PB N="84" REF="48"/>
Jew who by a most execrable impiety, burnt the Consecrated Hoast, having strook it through in several places with a Penknife. But by a singu∣lar Miracle it was gathered up by an old Woman, who unexpectedly came into his House at that time, and by her was carried to the Curate of St. <HI>Johns</HI> Church, where ever after it was pre∣served with great Veneration. This wicked Jew was for this Fact burnt alive, and his House given to the Carmelite Fathers where they have since that continued. The Learned <HI>Papirius Mas∣son</HI> whose Writings are so well known among all Scholars, is here interred. The Knights of S. <HI>La∣zarus</HI> do here use to make their Assemblies. And the Members of the French Academy perform here the Funeral Services for those who die out of their Society.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rüe des Billetes</HI> ends at the <HI>Rüe S. Croix de la Bretonnerie,</HI> so called from a Convent that stands there, founded by St. <HI>Lewis</HI> in the year 1268. In which he placed Religious <HI>Mendicants</HI> of the Order of St <HI>Augustin,</HI> but since that time several eminent and pious persons having confer∣red upon them considerable Maintenance, they no longer beg, because they will not hinder those who have greater need, but live upon their Re∣venues. The Wainscot Work of their Altar is very pretty, but that which is most remarkable is a Bas-relief of Marble over the Seats where the Religious sit, this was done by <HI>Sarazin</HI> and is highly esteemed. From hence you enter into</P>
<P><HI>The Rüe du grand Chantier;</HI> the first thing that you see here is,</P>
<P><HI>The Hôtel de Guise,</HI> built by the Princes of that Family, who bore so great a share in all the Transactions of these last Ages, that what relates
<PB N="85" REF="48"/>
to them makes the greatest part of the History of that time, especially in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. who put to death <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> and the Cardinal his Brother, in the Castle of <HI>Blois,</HI> where the Estates were then assembled, and this he did in order to cure those Tumults and disquiets which at that time so much disturbed the Peace of <HI>France.</HI> This Hôtel takes up a great deal of Ground. The Gate is built after the old manner with two great round Towers. The Apartments are very handsom, since the considerable Repa∣rations that have been made of late. Once we might have seen here most magnific Furniture, among which was a Suit of Tapistry representing the twelve Months of the year, of most exquisite Workmanship; this is at present at the Kings <HI>Garde-Meuble</HI> (or Wardrobe) and Monsieur <HI>Colbert</HI> hath caused it to be Copied. Madamoiselle <HI>de Guise,</HI> who at present dwells in this Hôtel, hath one of the best furnished Cabinets in <HI>Paris</HI> for Curiosities. In it are several pieces of Fila∣grame enriched with Jewels, and several Minia∣tures extremely fine. You may see there also di∣vers pieces of Wooden Work of St. <HI>Lucie,</HI> re∣presenting several Subjects of Devotion, cut ex∣tremely fine; not to speak of several other Cu∣riosities little inferiour to these. Cross the way is</P>
<P>The Church of the Fathers <HI>de la Mercy,</HI> a neat place. The Portal will be very handsom when finished, and the Altar is of a sort of Wainscot not ill wrought. The Institution of these is to go into <HI>Barbary</HI> and redeem Captives, like the <HI>Mathurins.</HI> And this they do by the assistance of Pious People who furnish them with considera∣ble Sums for this purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="49"/>
The Hospital of the <HI>Enfans Rouges</HI> (or Red Boys) built for poor Orphan Children, by <HI>Mar∣garet</HI> Queen of <HI>Navarre,</HI> Sister of <HI>Francis</HI> I. in the year 1534. It is of late years united to the Hospital General.</P>
<P>It is observable that this Street is full of hand∣som Houses, among which there is one at the Cor∣ner of the <HI>Rüe de Quatre-fils</HI> designed by <HI>Mansard.</HI> The Front is extreme handsom, and set off with many Vases. Near this is the house of Monsieur <HI>de Grand-Maison</HI> where you will see very hand∣som pictures, and a considerable quantity of Por∣celanes, of the finest and best sorts. The Ma∣ster to whom this House belongs, is of a very deli∣cate Gust for curious things.</P>
<P>At the end of this Street you see the great square Tower of the Temple, with four other round ones, very high and discovered a great way off. They served heretofore for an Arsenal, be∣fore that near the Celestins was built.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The old Rue de Temple.</HEAD>
<P>This Street begins at the <HI>Rüe St. Antoine.</HI> The first thing to be seen is</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Effiat,</HI> a great building very well raised, composed of four wings with a great Court in the middle. It was built by the late Mareschal of that name Sur-Intendant of the Fi∣nances, and great Master of the Artillery of <HI>France</HI> under <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. Monsieur <HI>Pelletier</HI> Con∣troller General of the Finances dwells here at pre∣sent. After this you come to</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="49"/>
The House of M. <HI>Amelot de Bisüeil</HI> Master of Requests. Here the Curious must rest them∣selves, and take time to consider all the fine things that are here, for all that is in this House deserves to be exactly viewed and considered. The first door you come at gives you a pattern of all the rest: It is adorned with Statues, the Joiners Work it self is wrought with very good Bas-reliefs, and the Locks are of very curious and particular Art. The Court is in truth something of the least, but the Entry or passage on the right hand is extraordinary. It is adorned with Pillars and Busts, and paved with Marble. Still the Stair∣case is more beautiful yet. Above it is open in manner of a Lanthorn, with a Balcony gilt and a Plafon over all full of Sculpture and the best designed Ornaments, and two great Statues in the <HI>Pallier.</HI> After this you enter into the great Hall, open on both sides, with Pictures between Window and Window, repre∣senting Flocks and Herds in <HI>Grottoes</HI> on the Sea∣side, of a very singular design, and very pleasing to the sight. That which deserves to be consi∣dered most attentively is the Plafon, in the mid∣dle of which is a great Picture done by an excel∣lent Master, about this is a Freeze full of Orna∣ments made of <HI>Stuc,</HI> upon a Ground of Gold, marvellously well wrought. Here you may see ancient Vases adorned with Triumphs, Sphinxes, Brasiers, Vizards, and in a word, all sorts of Gro∣tesque, very odd and fanciful, and yet extreme handsom. A great Cornish runs round this Hall, whose Carving is admirable, at the further end is the Chimny of the same Workmanship all gilt, and over it a great Trophy after the old Roman manner. After this you enter into an Anti Cham∣ber,
<PB N="88" REF="50"/>
where are several great Looking-Glasses, and from thence into a Chamber whose Plafon and Ornaments are still more rare and rich than all we have yet mentioned; the Furniture is of Crim∣son Velvet, embroidered with Gold and Silver, and the Tapistry within the Alcove is embroidered extremely rich. The Parquet of the Estade is of inlaid Work, where in the middle among di∣vers Ornaments are the Arms of the Master of the House. On the left hand is the Chappel, which is in Truth but little, but to make amends, it is adorned as much as possible with all things con∣venient. The Pictures that are in it are painted by very good Masters. On the right hand you enter into the Cabinet, the last Room of this Apartment, and the most beautiful of all. It is furnished instead of Tapistry with Wainscot, ex∣quisitely well gilded; on the Pannels of which are Vases with Festons of Flowers after nature, and divers little Birds flying about, after the man∣ner of <HI>Vanbouck</HI> one of the ablest Masters of his time for this sort of Work.</P>
<P>The Plafon and the Chimny are adorned after the same manner. All the Chambers of which we have been speaking look upon a Court, whose sides are adorned with Architectures, Figures and Perspectives, painted in <HI>Fresquo.</HI> On the other side is the second Apartment joyned to this. Where first you find a magnificent Chamber af∣ter the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, whose Plafon is opened Cupulo-wise, right Angular, with a Balastrade above, very well gilt. Over the Chimney is a Bas∣relief painted over like Brass, it is of extraordi∣nary Workmanship, and represents <HI>Jason</HI> Sacri∣ficing on the Sea shore in order to obtain a hap∣py return to this Country, after he had got away
<PB N="89" REF="50"/>
the Golden Fleece. From this Chamber you go into the Gallery, whose sides are set off with Co∣rinthian Pilasters, and with Pictures representing the Story of <HI>Psyche,</HI> painted by <HI>Corneille;</HI> so al∣so was the Plafon, which is one of the finest that can be seen.</P>
<P>On the right hand is a small Library, whose Ornaments suit perfectly well with the disposi∣tion of the place. In fine, nothing is wanting to this House, all is surprisingly neat, and you see nothing but what is Magnifick, and what deserved admiration, for even those things which in other places are of the least account, have here their peculiar Beauties, as the Window-Boards, which are of Cedar inlaid with Ebony and Ivory. The Locks and Bolts are of polished Steel, so deli∣cately wrought as if they were of Silver; not to speak of the Moveables, as the Tables and Look∣ing-glasses, which are inriched with Tortoise-shell and Ivory, and adorned with Mouldings of Brass gilt, and carved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> delicately.</P>
<P>One cannot see in any other place more curi∣ous Painting finished with more pains than here. In short those who have examined all the Beauties of this House do all agree that a greater number of delicacies cannot possibly be collected in so small a place, and that the Master to whom they belong could not have brought 'em into this condition without a very considerable Expence, and a perfect knowledge and skill in the choice of what is truly excellent. This curious Build∣ing is of the Sieur <HI>Cottard</HI>'s designing.</P>
<P>Over against this stands the <HI>Hôtel d'O,</HI> at pre∣sent converted into a Convent of Nuns of the Order of St. <HI>Austin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="51"/>
On the left hand, in the <HI>Rüe des blancs-Manteaux,</HI> you see the Convent that gave the Street this name, in which is nothing singular un∣less it be the Pavement of the Quire which is all of Marble. At present it is inhabited by Monks of St. <HI>Bennet;</HI> formerly they were called <HI>Guilli∣mins,</HI> being first founded by St. <HI>William,</HI> who ordered them to wear white Cloaks, which they afterwards left off.</P>
<P>There is nothing more considerable in the old <HI>Rüe du</HI> Temple.</P>
<P>From hence you enter into the <HI>Rüe Barbette,</HI> where you have the <HI>Hôtel de Estrees.</HI> This stands near the place where was formerly the Palace of <HI>Isabel de Bavieres,</HI> Wise of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. King of <HI>France,</HI> not far from which place happened the Murder of <HI>Lewis</HI> Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> Assassina∣ted by the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> which caused all those Divisions between those two Houses, and was the Original of those horrible troubles, which troubled <HI>France,</HI> during many years, and never ended till towards the conclusion of the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VII.</P>
<P>Near the Capuchins <HI>du Marais</HI> in the Street called <HI>Rüe de Touraine</HI> is a great piece of Per∣spective, in the Garden of the Sieur <HI>Turmeny.</HI> It is a Sun-dial placed on a Piece of Rustick Ar∣ehitecture among Trees, which at a distance makes a very handsom shew.</P>
<P>Over the Fountain in the <HI>Rüe de Poitou,</HI> not far from hence, you may read this Inscription,
<Q><PB N="91" REF="51"/>
<L>Hic Nymphae agrestes effundite civibus ur∣nas,</L>

<P>The first thing you discover at the end of this Street is, the Convent of the Nuns of <HI>Calvary,</HI> of St. <HI>Bennet</HI>'s Order. The Church is very hand∣som: the Altar adorned with Pictures represent∣ing in three pieces the History of our Savious Passion. As you go on you come to</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel</HI> of the Cardinal <HI>de Boüillon,</HI> Great Almoner of <HI>France.</HI> This was formerly called the <HI>Hôtel de Turenne.</HI> Here is a piece of Ar∣chitecture

<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Guenegaud,</HI> great and very well built, with several other Houses as far as the place Royal, which are all of an agreeable Symme∣try, and make this Street very uniform through∣out.</P>
<P>Of late years they have built here a Fountain, and placed upon it two Tritons, in Sculpture, under whom are these Verses of Monsieur <HI>de Santeüil:</HI></P>

<P>This place was built in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great: The Houses that are erected about it, are very beautiful and of the same symetry. They take up all that Ground which was formerly the Gar∣dens belonging to the <HI>Palais des Tournelles</HI> which stood on the side of the Rampart, in which Palace <HI>Francis</HI> II. and several other Kings his Predeces∣sors kept their Courts.

King of <HI>Spain, Catherine</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> Widow of the deceased King sold this Palace, which had been first built by <HI>Charles</HI> V. to divers particular Persons, who turned it into many Tenements; but the whole Street which runs along near the Rampart still keeps the an∣cient name.</P>
<P>The place of which we were speaking is exactly square, composed of six and thirty Pavilions raised of the same Symmetry; the materials are of Brick and Free-stone, raised upon a long row of Ar∣ches, under the shelter of which one may walk round the place. In the middle of these Build∣ings they have left a great void piece of Ground, which at present is about to be converted into a Garden and is to be inclosed with a Palisade of Iron, into which none may enter but those be∣longing to the Houses about the Place, who only are to have keys. Report says this Work will cost a hundred Pistolls for every House, which
<PB N="94" REF="53"/>
we may easily believe, if we consider the vast quan∣tity of Iron which it will require. In the middle of this Garden stands the Statue in Brass of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. on Horseback raised on a great Pe∣destal of white Marble, on the four sides of which you may read the following Inscriptions.</P>

This Horse is one of the most beautiful pieces that can be seen. The famous <HI>Daniel de Voltere,</HI> an <HI>Italian,</HI> one of the ablest Sculptors of his time, made it for <HI>Henry</HI> II. but it was never set up for that King, by reason of those many troubles which overflowed all <HI>France</HI> during the following Reigns.</P>
<P>The most considerable Houses, and in which you will find most Curiosities, in this place, are</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Richelieu,</HI> in which are very excellent Pictures of divers Masters, but above all of <HI>Rubens,</HI> a famous <HI>Flemming,</HI> whose Works are highly esteemed by the curious, because of that beauty of design, and vivacity of colouring, in which he has been more successful than all other Painters. You will see in this <HI>Hôtel</HI> more than in all <HI>Paris</HI> beside: and with these very rich moveables.</P>
<P>The House of Monsieur the Marquess <HI>de An∣geau,</HI> Governor of <HI>Touraine.</HI> On the Wall of this House is a piece of Perspective representing certain Architecture in Forest, in a very exqui∣site manner. With this you may observe at the further end of the Garden a <HI>Pavilion</HI> not ill built. The great Stair-case is very lightsom, and all the rest of the House extreme neat. All which does sufficiently declare the Master to be a person of a delicate Gust.</P>
<P>Almost over against this on the other side of the place stands the <HI>Hôtel de Chaunes.</HI> One en∣tire Wing of the Building has been raised of late years, in which may be observed much Regulari∣ty. At the bottom of the Court lies the Garden, in which you have some Water-works, and at the further part of it a piece of Perspective which answers to the Gate, and as you enter makes a cu∣rious

<HEAD>The Convent of the Minims.</HEAD>
<P>These Fathers were setled here in the year 1590: Their Church is one of the neatest and lightest in <HI>Paris,</HI> and tho the Portal is not finished, yet that hinders not but that it is very remarkable, in regard the famous <HI>Mansard</HI> made the design. The Pillars of the first Order are Doricks; but these Fathers having occasion for a Tribune they caused one to be raised over this Portal, and adorned it with Pillars on the outside, which do not at all agree with that part which was begun by such an able Master. Their Altar is also of the better sort, contrived with Corinthian Pillars of black Marble, flatted, the only in all <HI>France</HI> of this manner. The Ornaments are not superfluous; the Statue of the blessed Virgin is on one side of it, and that of St. <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Paula</HI> the Founder of this Order, on the other: both these Statues are well wrought. There are several Chappels in this Church well worth seeing, as that of M. the Duke of <HI>Vie-ville,</HI> whose Altar is all of Marble, in which Chappel there are several Tombs of divers Persons of that Family, of the same materials; That of Monsieur <HI>le Camus,</HI> the Wainscot in which is gilt very neatly; on one side of the great Altar is the Chappel of St. <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Pau∣la,</HI> where the life of that Saint hath been painted by the <HI>Sieur Viete.</HI> Over against this is the Chappel of Monsieur <HI>le Jay</HI> first President of
<PB N="101" REF="56"/>
Parliament; and lastly that in which is the Tomb of Madame the Dutchess of <HI>Angoulesine,</HI> curi∣ously adorned with Marble Figures.</P>
<P>Within the House, you ought to see tho Li∣brary, where are some Books of no small value. But that which is most remarkable is a Collection of Rituals, gathered by M. <HI>de Launoy,</HI> Doctor in Theology, one who hath justly pass'd for one of the ablest Criticks of our times in Church-An∣tiquities, who by his profound knowledge has cleared many things of which we had but very obscure Notions. He lies interred in the Church belonging to these Fathers, to whom he bequeath∣ed by his Will two hundred Crowns, and half his Library The following Epitaph was made for him by Monsieur <HI>Clement</HI> Counsellor in the Court of Aydes and is to be placed on his Tomb.</P>
<Q LANG="lat">D. O.

<P>Sacred to Almighty God.</P><P>Here lies <HI>John Launoy,</HI> Native of <HI>Constance</HI> A <HI>Parisian</HI> Divine, Who being the constant defender of Truth, and of the Rites of the Church and King, spent his life innocent and unblamable. He despised Riches, and was contented with a very little, as knowing he must quickly leave it. He writ many things, free from either hope or sear. He acquired a very great Reputation and Respect among good men. He resigned his Soul to his Saviour in the seventy seventh year of his age, <HI>March</HI> 10. 1678.</P>
<P>To his dear Friend, <HI>Nicolas le Camus</HI> Chief Offi∣cer of the Exchequer erected this Monument.</P></Q>
<P>There are also in this Library certain pieces of Opticks made by the famous Father <HI>de Niseron,</HI> a <HI>Parisian,</HI> one of the most knowing Men in this Science that hath perhaps ever appeared in this Age. He hath left us a Volume of that Art, very much estemed; it was he also who caused to be painted in the Dortoir of this House, the Figures of St. <HI>John,</HI> and the <HI>Magdelain,</HI> which Figures extend the whole length of the two Gal∣leries, and which they cannot see in their true proportion, but from a point marked for you to stand in. This Learned Person had enriched the Publick with many other things had not death ta∣ken him from us in an Age wherein he did but begin to discover his wonderful wit and parts.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="57"/>
The Refectory of this Convent is very hand∣som, and of late years has been painted round about with Landskips and Solitudes, which en∣tertain the thoughts of the Religious while they are at their meals with Ideas remote from the af∣fairs of this World. It is well known that these Fathers live in great austerity, and that the de∣sign of their institution hath taken in almost all that is rigorous in the other Orders.</P>
<P>Before you leave the <HI>Marais du Temple,</HI> you ought to observe that the greatest part of the Houses in this Quarter have been built within these fifty or sixty years, and that the Ground on which they stand was formerly a marish and em∣ployed in great Gardens which furnished <HI>Paris</HI> with Roots and Kitchin Herbs. At present it is a handsom Quarter, whose habitations are very conveniently built, and therein a great number of Persons of Quality inhabit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Rue St. Antoine.</HEAD>
<P>After you have seen the <HI>Maraise du Temple,</HI> you ought to pass next to the <HI>Ruë St. Antoine,</HI> one of the longest and handsomest Streets of all the Town, and which is ordinarily appointed for Shews and Entries for Embassadors. It was through this Street that the Queen made her first Entry, and through which that famous Carousel in the year 1661. made their glorious March. The Popes Legate who came hither in the year 1664. for whom a most Magnifick Entry was appointed, passed this way to the Church of <HI>Nôtre-Dame.</HI> In the past Ages this Street was also used for the
<PB N="104" REF="58"/>
like matters. Our Kings did here use to run at the Ring, and make their Justs and Turnaments, but since the fatal Accident that befel <HI>Henry</HI> II. these Sports have been left off. To see this Street in Order we ought to begin at</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The <HI>Greve.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This is the only place in <HI>Paris</HI> where they make the publick shews of Joy and Triumph. Here are made the Bonfires on the Eve of St. <HI>John</HI> Baptist, and at other times when <HI>France</HI> hath gained any Victories over her Enemies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Ville</HI> takes up one side of this Place. It was built in the Reign of <HI>Francis</HI> I. who laid the first Stone himself. The Archite∣cture is however a little Gotique; that is to say, it is not altogether according to the gust of the present age, in which the old Roman and Greek proportions are studied with more care and ex∣actness, Artists endeavouring every day to re-e∣stablish this curious Science in the same perfecti∣on that it had under the Reign of <HI>Augustus.</HI> The Statue of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. is placed over the Gate, re∣presented on Horseback in <HI>Demi-bosse,</HI> upon a Ground of black Marble. The Horse was copi∣ed from that of <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> at the Capitol. The Court is but small and enclosed with Build∣ings of the same symmetry. Under one of the Arches at the further end of the Court there is a Statue of the King in the Habit of <HI>Hercules,</HI> treading under foot that Discord which would have disquieted the beginning of his happy Reign. On the Pedestal which is of Marble as is also the Statue, they have cut some Inscriptions, but such
<PB N="105" REF="58"/>
as are not thought material to be repeated here, in regard they contain nothing remarkable, nor recount any passage of History that can be useful to the curious.</P>
<P>In the Rooms there are some Pictures repre∣senting the <HI>Prevosts des Marchands</HI> and the <HI>Es∣chevins</HI> of the past Age, and of this also in their proper habits. At the two ends of the great Hall over the two Chimneys there are placed the Por∣traits of the King in his Royal Robes and his Scepter in his hand. In this Hall they Assemble to elect their <HI>Prevosts des Marchands</HI> and <HI>Esche∣vins.</HI> The Windows that look upon the Greve at publick Shews and Rejoicings, are filled with Persons of the greatest Quality, who are some∣times treated here very magnificently at the Char∣ges of the City.</P>
<P>To make the Entry into the <HI>Greve</HI> more con∣venient, they have within five or six years last past opened a way from the <HI>Pont de Nôtre-Dame</HI> to this place all along the River, which they have adorned with a very handsom Key of Free-stone. They have also built on this Key several Houses of the same Symmetry, inhabited by good Trades∣men. This beautiful Enterprize was begun un∣der the Prevost-ship of Monsieur <HI>Pelletier,</HI> at present Controller-general of the Finances, and all that was performed under his administration has been as well for the Publick good, as for the Beauty of the City. The People have as an eter∣nal mark of their acknowledgment, given this place the new name of <HI>le Quay Pelletier,</HI> though through a modesty that hath had but few exam∣ples, he himself would never suffer his name to appear in any of those Works which have been raised by his order. As you enter on that side
<PB N="106" REF="59"/>
next the Bridge of <HI>Nôtre-dame</HI> you will see the following Inscription in black Marble, over which is the Kings Picture in a Medaillon.</P>
<Q LANG="lat">AUSPICIIS <LB/> LUDOVICI MAGNI <LB/> HANC RIPAM <LB/> FOEDAM NUPER ET INVIAM NUNC PUBLICUM ITER ET ORNAMENTUM URBIS <LB/> F. CC. <LB/> PRAEF. ET AEDIL. <LB/> ANN. R. S. H. MDCLXXV.</Q>
<Q>By the Favour of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great the Pro∣vost and Aediles have made this Bank which was before dirty and unpassable, a fair Street and the Ornament of the City. In the year from the Redemption of the World, <HI>1675.</HI></Q>
<P>As you go from the <HI>Greve</HI> you pass by the Church of St. <HI>John,</HI> formerly a Chappel depen∣ding on that of St. <HI>Gervais,</HI> and which was built, as some will have it in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fair in the year 1326. That which deserves particular observation is the Vault that supports the Organs which is of a manner really very hardy, and the little door next the Cloister which is of the Ionick Order.</P>
<P>The following Epitaph will not be unpleasant to the Curious to read, for they will find it ex∣traordinary, it is near the Crucifix of this Church.</P>

He de∣ceased <HI>June</HI> 1. 1575.</P><P>As you pass by pray for him.</P></Q>
<P>A little further is the Church of St. <HI>Gervais,</HI> It is one of the ancientest Parishes in <HI>Paris,</HI> as may be seen in the History of St. <HI>Germain,</HI> Bishop of this Town, who lived in the year 578. In favour of which he wrought here a Miracle as <HI>Fortunatus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Pottiers</HI> reports in his History. The Body of this Church is very well built, but according to the Gothick way, with high raised Roofs, and Chappels round about; in one of which under the <HI>Croisée</HI> on the left hand, you may see some Paintings after the man∣ner of <HI>le Sueur</HI> who was one of the best Painters of this Age, next to the famous <HI>Poussin,</HI> and of whom we shall have occasion to speak more at large hereafter; the Paintings in the Windows which represent the Martyrdom of St <HI>Gervais</HI> and the Picture over the Altar are of his hand. The Tapistry which they expose here on the great
<PB N="108" REF="60"/>
Feasts are very well wrought; the Originals from which these were Copied are in the Nave of the Church, and were painted by the said <HI>le Sueur</HI> and <HI>Champaigne.</HI> They represent the History of St. <HI>Gervais</HI> and St. <HI>Protais,</HI> and the manner how their holy Bodies were found at <HI>Millain</HI> through the Prayers of St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> who mentions this matter in his Epistles.</P>
<P>But this is not that which ought most to em∣ploy the Curious, the magnificent Portal will entertain their view with much greater pleasure, and make them acknowledge that they cannot elsewhere see any thing more handsom or regular. It is composed of three Greek Orders, one over the other, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Dorick, the Ionick, and the Corinthian, whose proportions are so handsom and so exact, that in the judgment of the famous Cavalier <HI>Bernin</HI> himself, there is nothing more finished and perfect in all <HI>Europe.</HI> The Pillars are fluted, without any other Ornaments than what are proper to themselves. These three Or∣ders compose a Fabrick of a very great heighth and perfectly pleasing to the sight: Had the place before it been larger, nothing had been wanting to set off this Work in all its magnificence. The Reputation of this Building belongs to the Sieur <HI>de Brosse,</HI> he who made the designs for the Pa∣lace of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> and the Temple at <HI>Charen∣ton.</HI> However we must not think him the only Artist, we must know that <HI>Clement M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tezeau</HI> was employed with him; this is he who under∣took the Ditch of <HI>Rochel,</HI> as hath been already mentioned when we treated of the Gallery at the Louvre, and who was one of the ablest Ar∣chitects of his time. He was born of a conside∣rable Family at <HI>Dreux,</HI> and was much esteemed
<PB N="109" REF="60"/>
by Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> who perfectly well un∣derstood Persons merit. Monsieur <HI>de Fourcy,</HI> Counsellor in the Parliament, and Intendant-ge∣neral of the Buildings under <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. Father to Monsieur the President <HI>de Fourcy,</HI> a person more renowned at present for his Merit and Probi∣ty, than for the dignity of his Charge, was at that time honorary Church-warden of this Church; It was he that undertook this great Work, toge∣ther with M. <HI>de Onon</HI> and M. <HI>de Saint Genis,</HI> his Collegues in the Office. <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. laid the first Stone, and in a very little time this mar∣vellous Structure was finished as we now see it.</P>
<P>From this Church of St. <HI>Gervais,</HI> to the mid∣dle of the <HI>Rüe St. Antoine</HI> is nothing conside∣rable. You pass before the Church-yard of S. <HI>John</HI> where is at present a Market-place. Here formerly stood the Hôtel of <HI>Pierre de Craon</HI> who murder∣ed the Constable <HI>Olivier du Clisson</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. whose House was demolished and rased to the Ground in the year 1392. as a pu∣nishment for that Fact. After this you come to</P>
<P>The Hotel <HI>de Beauvais,</HI> which shews a very handsom Front to the Street, adorned with three Balconies. The Masons Work is <HI>en Bossage</HI> with very neat Ornaments. The Gate is large, and tho the Court be but very small it is howe∣ver compassed about with Buildings where the several Orders of Architecture are well observed. The Stair-case is supported with Pillars, and em∣bellished with many Ornaments. As for the A∣partments they are extreme pleasant and com∣passed about with a long Balustrade of Iron, leading quite round the Court, into which the doors open.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="61"/>
As often as there hath been any great Sight to be held in the <HI>Rüe St. Antoine,</HI> this fair house hath been made use of by those of the Royal Fa∣mily. At the famous Carousel that was in the year 1661. a great number of Princesses and Ladies of the Court placed themselves here to see that magnificent Train pass by from the Place Royal where they assembled to go to the open place before the Palace of the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> in which they were to perform their Courses.</P>
<P>Over against this stands <HI>the Church of little St. Antoine,</HI> which hath nothing in it of Beauty, and its very simplicity hath made it sufficiently known that it formerly served for an Hospital; and was founded for those who were afflicted with that Epidemical Disease called St. <HI>Anthonys</HI> Fire. A Distemper which hath been now ceased this two or three Ages. The Confraternity of St. <HI>Claude</HI> hath been a long time established in this Church, but it is much decayed from what it was in former times, for it is evident that under the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. their Founder, all the great Lords of the Court, caused their names to be here inrolled after his Example, and made con∣siderable Presents in favour of this Saint.

<P>The Church of these Fathersis dedicated to St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> and is one of the fairest and best adorned of all <HI>Paris.</HI> It is built after the Modern, with a great Dome or Cupolo raised over it. The Co∣rinthian Order is observed throughout the whole Work, very regularly, and the Portal is extreme∣ly well placed, in regard it stands exactly over against the end of the <HI>Rüe</HI> St. <HI>Catherine:</HI> It is composed of three Orders of Corinthian Pilllars

<P>The inside of this Church answers well to that without. A Gallery runs round over the Chap∣pels having a Balustrade of Iron on the top of the Cornish, by which Gallery you may go round the Church. The great Altar is composed of three ranks of Corinthian Pillars of black Marble, whose Capitals are of Brass gilt. On each side of the Altar are the Statues of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Charle∣magne.</HI> But to say the truth, this Altar is a little
<PB N="114" REF="63"/>
too low, which makes it sad and obscure. Yet it being on the Festivals enlightned with a great number of Candles the defect is the less taken notice of. The Tabernacle which they expose on such days is of Silver set off with <HI>Feuillages</HI> and other Ornaments Silver and gilt, and the Workmanship is of greater value than the mate∣rials. One cannot see in any Church of <HI>Paris,</HI> a greater number of Reliquaries, Silver Vessels, Candlesticks, Branches, Perfuming-pots, and such like things all of Silver or Silver Gilt. Nay there are some all of Gold; but that which is most remarkable is a great Sun of Gold inriched with Diamonds and great Pearls, of a very consi∣derable price. The Ornaments are almost of as great Beauty, among which there is one that re∣presents the adoration of the three Kings embroi∣dered with Pearls, and others of very rare work∣manship, where Gold and Silver have not been spared. In fine, nothing is wanting to the mag∣nificence of this Altar; besides these Fathers have such able Sacristans that they invent every day some new manner of Imbellishment. All the Chappels are adorned with Marble Pillars, and Pictures of those Saints to whose memory the several Chap∣pels are Dedicated. On the left side of the great Altar, under an Arch, is the heart of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. supported by two great Angels under a Crown of Silver gilt.

<P>All the Pieces are of Brass and perfectly well wrought, Monsieur <HI>Sarasin</HI> whose Work it is, hath in this Monument discovered his excellent Genius in designing. Here is inclosed the heart of that Generous Prince, which in truth the Fathers Jesuits had gained long before his Death. All men know what a particular affection the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> have always had for this Society. The Car∣dinal of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> Uncle of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great was the first who established them at <HI>Paris.</HI> He bought for them the <HI>Hôtel de Amville</HI> for the sum of 13000 Livers, which the Receivers of the Abby of St. <HI>Germain</HI> advanced, and at his Death he left to these Fathers his whole Library which con∣sisted of very good Books. But till the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Just they never had but a small Chappel, and no very commodious House. That great King, whose Piety was extraordinary, be∣gun their Church as we now see it, and Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu</HI> contributed much to its Perfection as we have already said. Father <HI>Marlange</HI> Na∣tive of <HI>Lyons,</HI> of this Society, gave the Design, but the Work was carried on by Father <HI>de Rant,</HI> a
<PB N="118" REF="65"/>
<HI>Lorrainer,</HI> who cast away many things which were in the first design.</P>
<P>I shall not say any thing here in praise of this Society, to do that were not only to deviate from the Subject of this Book, but it is really an Ar∣gument reserved for much more Eloquent Pens than mine. I will only acquaint the Reader that those of this House who are of greatest Fame, are Father <HI>Bourdaloue,</HI> whose Sermons are extreme∣ly frequented, and heard with much profit and applause. His true Character is Morality, which he teaches with such Eloquence, so delicate, so lively, and so penetrating, that he does even ra∣vish his Auditors: Father <HI>Girou</HI> in a different way of Preaching is no less famous, and de∣serves no less praise: Father <HI>Menetrier,</HI> who to∣gether with his Learned manner of Preaching, enjoys several other excellent Talents; he hath published a great many Volumes upon the Art of Blazon, which he has reduced to certain Prin∣ciples infinitely more clear and more Methodical than ever any other Author that writ before him, express'd on this Subject; Not long since he published the Original of Opera's, and he hath promised some other things which no doubt will be received by the Publick, with no less applause than those already Printed: Father <HI>Jourdan</HI> is also of this house, he hath composed the Original of the Royal Family of <HI>France,</HI> consisting of three Volumes in <HI>quarto,</HI> and Printed by <HI>Cra∣moisi,</HI> in which one may find many particulars touching the French History, which the modern Authors have neglected or not discovered,</P>

The Portal of the Church is very pretty, adorn∣ed with Architecture like Pilasters, between which are placed several Statues, and Bas-reliefs above, which make a very handsom shew as you enter, though the Rules of Art are not observed, nor the ordinary practice, which forbids the placing of Triglifes upon a Frize that is supported by Corinthian Pillars. Further on you see</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Carnavalet,</HI> whose Portal is the Workmanship of the famous <HI>Gougeon.</HI> It is a kind of Bossage with two Bas-reliefs above it. This Work hath been so much adorned by the skilful that the great <HI>Mansard</HI> when employed to finish this Portal, would not touch that which had been begun by such an able Master, he only proceeded to make the second Story to correspond as we see it, but it is not finished neither. The Building on the Court side is adorned with great Figures in demi-relief which are exactly well de∣signed. Near this House is</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Angoulesme,</HI> whose Architecture is composed of great Corinthian Pilasters, which take up the whole heighth of the Building, and which are the first of this kind that have been raised in <HI>Paris,</HI> and have served as a Model to some Architects that have copied from hence their Works of this kind that have been since made.</P>
<P>At the end of St. <HI>Catherines</HI> Street of which we are now speaking, you ought not to forget to see the House of Monsieur <HI>de Ville</HI> an Archi∣tect, who has omitted nothing to render the Building pleasing and neat.

<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Suilly,</HI> whose Buildings are ex∣treme regular. The Door is set off with Dorick Pillars, over which they have left a Plat-form, partly to make the Court more airy and partly that the apartments may be the more exposed to view.

<P>The <HI>Nuns of St. Mary</HI> are a little further, and near the <HI>Hôtel de Maienne,</HI> which makes the Corner of the <HI>Rüe du petit Mase.</HI> Their Church is but small, but one of the neatest in all <HI>Paris:</HI> It is a Dome of reasonable heighth, supported with Corinthian Pilasters making four Arches, the great Altar is placed under the furthermost Arch, opposite to the Door. The Tabernacle is of ex∣quisite Workmanship, and the Pictures repre∣senting the Visitation is of an excellent Master. On Festival days they expose on this Altar a great quantity of rich Plate, and an Ornament in the middle of which is the Portrait of St. <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Salles</HI> their Institutor, set off and adorned with great Pearls.

<P>This Gate stands on one side of the <HI>Bastille</HI> and leads to the <HI>Faux-bourg St. Antoine.</HI> It was built for <HI>Henry</HI> II. and dedicated to him as a Triumphal Arch. Some years since they have beautified this Gate considerably, in pulling down another old one near this place which caused con∣tinual Stops, and in adding to this two other new ones which make the passage much more easie, and give more room for Coaches and Carts to en∣ter. One may see by a small Inscription which is still preserved, that this Building was the Work of <HI>Metezeau,</HI> the worthy Father of him whom we have formerly mentioned, he was a man of extraordinary ability, as we may easily conclude from this Work, which in its kind is one of the finest things that can be seen.

<HI>Paris,</HI> did not think that any thing could be ad∣ded to its beauty, and was contented only to make a new passage on each side, that that in the mid∣dle might be the freer. The hansomest Front looks towards the Suburbs. It is in the manner of Ru∣stick Bossage, with a great Entablement or Cor∣nish of the Dorick Order which runs along all the Work, over which is an Attique. The Statue of the King stands above all, and two small Py∣ramids on each hand at the utmost edges. On the Attique these Inscriptions are ingraved</P>

Between the three Arches under which we pass, they have placed in Bas-relief a Copy of that Medal which the Town caused to be stampt for the King, representing his Majesty with this Inscription:</P>

<P>The Abby of St. <HI>Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine</HI> is farther on. This Abby gives name to all this Quarter. Many very remarkable Stories are told of the Foundation of this House, but in regard they do not sute with the Gust of this Age, I do not think it proper to in∣sert them here. This Abby began to be built about the year 1193. and was finished in the Reign of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> who was present and assisting at its Dedi∣cation, together with Queen <HI>Blanch</HI> of <HI>Castile</HI> his Mother. The Order of <HI>Cistertian</HI> Nuns was here placed by the solicitation of <HI>Odo de Suilly</HI> Bishop of <HI>Paris.</HI> The House is extreme nume∣rous and very well Governed.

<P>As you go into the Street beyond this Abby, is the Manufactury of Looking-glasses, which were formerly brought from <HI>Venice.</HI> But Monsieur <HI>Colbert</HI> observing how great a Treasure this Trade had yearly drawn out of the Kingdom, established this Manufacture, which has had a very happy Success, as indeed all other matters have had which that great Minister hath undertaken.

And in regard this place is the highest of all this Quarter, this beautiful Structure is placed here, though it is not yet raised much higher than the Pedestal. One may judge from the Model which is only of Plaster, that it will be when fi∣nished one of the most Illustrious Monuments of all <HI>Europe.</HI> It is a great Work, consisting of two Fronts and three open thorow-Passages, be∣tween each of which are placed two Corinthian Pillars, in all eight on each side, and two at the ends, or thickness of the Work.

<P>Tho we did not intend in this Description to speak of any of the beautiful houses about <HI>Paris,</HI> yet we must not neglect to say something of <HI>Vin∣cennes</HI> in regard of its near neighbourhood. It is at the further end of that great Ally of Trees, which has been continued from the Triumphal Arch to this place, to serve for a passage hither, and makes a pleasing prospect. The Building is exactly square, compassed about with a Moat very deep. It has several Towers of great heighth but one higher than the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t called the <HI>Donjon.</HI> The first Founder of this House was <HI>Philip Au∣gustus,</HI> who also made the Park about it, in which he put a great number of Deer, sent him by <HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Normandy</HI> which he then possessed. <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Valois</HI> and King <HI>John</HI> his Son continued the Work, but it was not finished
<PB N="130" REF="71"/>
till the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> V. called the Wise, which put it into the condition as it now is. There have been several very considerable additions made, and the Court hath often resided here for a long time together. The two great Wings of Modern Building on the Park side, are of Do∣rick Pilasters and were designed by Monsieur <HI>du Vau.</HI></P>
<P>They are Magnificent both without and within, and shew very great; but that which is most remarkable is the great Gate that leads to the Park, of the same Order, together with the Sta∣tues that stand on each side which are very beau∣tiful. The Chappel was founded by <HI>Charles</HI> V. and the Body of Monsieur the Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> who died here, is reposited in this Chappel, till that of the Colledge of the four Nations be finish∣ed, in which will be raised a Monument for him, as he has ordered in his Will. You ought to take particular notice of the curious Windows in this Chappel, they being highly esteemed, in regard neither <HI>Italy</HI> nor any other parts elsewhere can equal them. Many Kings have made their abode here. St. <HI>Lewis</HI> who used oftentimes to devest himself of the State and press of his Attendants at Court, that he might have the greater freedom to exercise his Piety, would here pass his days of retreat. It is said that not long ago there was remaining in the Park a great old Oak, under which this good Prince was used to hear their Complaints who resorted to him for Justice; and that he himself would use to send abroad his Heralds about the Country to call in all such who had any need of his Authority against the oppressi∣on of great men. And thus much hath been al∣ready well observed by a learned Preacher in an
<PB N="131" REF="71"/>
Eloquent Panegyrick which he made on the Feast day of this Saint, in the Church of the <HI>Grands Jestures,</HI> dedicated to him.</P>
<P>At the entrance into the Park is the <HI>Menage∣rie</HI> or place where they keep several sorts of Wild Beasts, which oftentimes they cause to fight together in a Court in which are Galleries that serve the Spectators to stand in and see with∣out danger. Behind the <HI>Menagerie</HI> over against one of the Park Gates, are the Nuns of S. <HI>Maud,</HI> which Nuns were formerly at <HI>la Saussaïe</HI> beyond the <HI>Ville-Juif.</HI> This House did once belong to Monsieur <HI>Fouquet.</HI></P>
<P>This is all you can see on this side: as you re∣turn into the <HI>Faux-bourg</HI> you may take a walk in the Garden of the <HI>Piq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epuces,</HI> which is among the first Houses you come at. Here are some Grottoes of Shell-work, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot ill wrought. In their Refectory you will see some Pictures of Mon∣sieur <HI>le Brun.</HI> This Convent is one of the most pleasing and neatest of <HI>Paris,</HI> tho it be but of this last Age. On the same side as you go on towards the Town you pass before <HI>Rambouïllet,</HI> whose Gardens are extreme pleasant, composed of several Walks of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>momil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and a great <HI>Parterre,</HI> in the midst of which is a Fountain.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Reüill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> stands the house of Monsieur <HI>de Chantelou, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istre d'Hôtel</HI> to the King, who has the best Pieces of <HI>Poussin</HI> that are to be seen, among others the seven Sacraments of which there are so many Copies, and which the Sieun <HI>Pesne</HI> hath etc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. All knowing men agree, without contradiction, that these Pieces are the best Paint∣ings and the best designed things of the whole World, if we except the Works of some <HI>Italian</HI> Masters.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="72"/>
On the other side of the <HI>Faux-bourg</HI> you ought to view the house of the Sieur <HI>Titen</HI> the Kings Secretary, in the <HI>Rüe de Montreüil:</HI> It is one of the finest you can see, whose Master being rich and of a delicate Gust, one cannot but imagine that nothing can be there wanting; and in truth it is very pleasant. Both on the Court-side and that next the Garden the Fronts are very Beautiful.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Rüe de Charonne</HI> you will see also an other which belongs to Monsieur <HI>de Folville,</HI> who caused it to be built very lately. It is flat Roof'd after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, with Vases and Statues over the Cornishes. It is a kind of great Pavilion with four Fronts. In the middle of this Building is a Hall that opens to all the four sides, and parts the whole into four Divisions. The Beauty of the Buildings is equal on the Garden, and on that of the Court. The Garden is great enough and very carefully kept. Strangers ought not to neglect to see these two houses, for it is certain they can hardly see finer, and where the beauties of Modern Architecture have been obser∣ved with more care and Judgment. And this is all that is more than ordinarily curious to be ob∣served in the <HI>Fauxbourg St. Antoine.</HI></P>
<P>The first thing you see as you re-enter into the Town is the <HI>Arsenal,</HI> where you have a very handsom Garden, with a long Ally or walk of Trees which runs all along the Ditch. Near the <HI>Mail</HI> there are some apartments handsom enough which extend along the very spacious Courts, whose Prospect is upon the River. Among others, the great Hall is adorned with a Plafond, or Cei∣ling, of Monsieur <HI>Mignard</HI>'s Work. The Duke of <HI>Lude</HI> at present enjoys these Lodgings, as great Master of the Artillery of <HI>France.</HI> Formerly
<PB N="133" REF="72"/>
they cast the Ordnance here in the Arsenal, but at present, it is done in the Frontier Towns, because of the proximity of those places where they are to be employed. Over the Gate are these two Verses.</P>
<Q><L>Aetna haec Henrico Vulcania tela ministrat,</L>
<L>Tela Giganteos debellat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra furores.</L></Q>
<Q><L>This <HI>Aetna</HI> does to <HI>Henry</HI> Thunder yield,</L>
<L>With which the Gyants that rebel, are quell'd.</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de l'Edig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieres</HI> is in the <HI>Rüe de l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cerisaïe</HI> which leads to one of the Arsenal Gates▪ You ought not to neglect to see the magnificent Furniture in that House; it is not long since they had here the best Pictures of the Kingdom, which the late Duke <HI>de l'Ediguieres</HI> had col∣lected with much care and Judgment, but they are now, since his Death, dispersed into other hands.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The <HI>Celestins.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Formerly this Convent belonged to the <HI>Car∣melites</HI> of the <HI>Place-Maubert,</HI> and these <HI>Cele∣stines</HI> did then inhabit where they now are. But they desiring to be nearer the University, left this place in exchange with the <HI>Celestins.</HI> The first Founder was a Burgess of <HI>Paris</HI> named <HI>Jaques Marcel,</HI> who in the year 1318 bought the place which the <HI>Carmelites</HI> had left, for the sum of 500 Livers, and gave it to the <HI>Celestins. Charles</HI> V.
<PB N="134" REF="73"/>
surnamed the Wife, augmented the Foundation very much, and built their Church as we see it at present, himself laying the first Stone. Nor did this King stop here, he gave them also conside∣rable Rents, which have been since that time aug∣mented by other Donations which have been made to them by several great Lords, more espe∣cially by <HI>Lewis</HI> Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> Brother of <HI>Charles</HI> V. who was Assassinated by the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> his Coufin German, as he came out of the Palace of <HI>Isabet</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> his Sister-in-law. that Prince had a very particular affection for these Fathers, and did them more good Offices than any other Person ever did since their Foundation. After his death his Body was brought to their Church, and was interred in a Chappel which he had caused to be built for himself and his Fami∣ly. Before we enter into this Church we ought to pass through the little Cloister, which is ex∣actly square, and built very neatly. It is all Vaulted and adorned with Sculpture. The Pillars that support the Arches have their Capitals ex∣tremely well wrought. This is a Work of the last Age, and had it been done in this it would have cost much more than it did, for it is said that the whole expence did not exceed 29000 Francs. In one corner of this Cloister you ought to observe the Epitaph of <HI>Anthony Perez,</HI> Secri∣tary to <HI>Philip</HI> the Second King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who being fallen into disgrace with his Master came for refuge into <HI>France,</HI> were he led a private life. And dying at <HI>Paris</HI> in the year 1611. he was interred in this place. His Epitaph is as fol∣low:</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="73"/>
Hic jacet Illust. D. <HI>Anthonius Perez</HI> olim <HI>Phi∣lippo</HI> Secundo <HI>Hisp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>miorum</HI> Regi à Sereti∣oribus consiliis. Cujus odium male auspi∣catum effugiens, ad <HI>Henricum</HI> Quartum Galliarum Regem invictissimum se contulit, cujus{que} beneficentiam expertus est, demum Parisits diem clausit, An. <HI>S. MDCXI.</HI></P>
<P>Here lies the Illustrious <HI>Anthony Perez,</HI> for∣merly Secretary to <HI>Philip</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain.</HI> To avoid whose unhappy displeasure, he be∣took himself to <HI>Henry</HI> IV. the most potent King of <HI>France,</HI> by whom he was received into favour, and at length ended his days at <HI>Paris,</HI> in the year of Salvation MDCXI.</P>
<P>The Church belonging to these Fathers is all Gothick and hath nothing Curious in relation to its Structure. The Altar is not much better a∣dorned: yet on the Festival days they expose here very rich Ornaments of an ancient sort of Stuff of Gold and Silver Embroidered, by whose Beau∣ty we may perceive that in the Ages past they had very industrious Artists, and such who had a delicate Gust in these matters. The Kings Se∣cretaries hold their Confraternity in this Church. Their Company is one of the famousest that is, as well for the number of considerable persons that compose it, as the great Priviledges which their Office gives them, one of the fairest of which is the Title of Nobility. They have a black Pall, the richest that is to be seen; made by an <HI>Italian</HI> whom Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> caused to come into
<PB N="136" REF="74"/>
this Kingdom expresly, to design the Embroide∣ry which he intended to make. This Pall is of black Velvet with a great Cross of Silver, and Cartouches about the edges, in which there are several devises delicately wrought.</P>
<P>You ought next to see the Tombs which are in the <HI>Chapelle de Orleans.</HI> As you go in, on the left hand you may observe a great twisted Pillar, of white Marble, adorned with <HI>Feüillages</HI> and Mouldings let into the Work, as is also the Capi∣tal which is of the Composite Order; Over which is placed an Urn of Brass, and in that the heart of the Constable <HI>Anne de Montmorency,</HI> who died gloriously of his Wounds received at the Bat∣tel of St <HI>Dennis,</HI> which he fought against the <HI>Hugonots</HI> on the fourteenth of <HI>November</HI> in the year 1567. This brave Lord received six several Wounds, of which the last only was mor∣tal. It is reported of him that being in the Agony of Death, a Cordelier exhorting him to his last Duties with something too much Violence and Importunity, he desired him to permit him to rest a little, saying that he had not lived fourscore years, and not yet learnt what it was to die one quarter of an hour. His Funeral Pomp was Magnificent, and equal to that of Kings, his Esfi∣gies being carried as is customary at the Obsequies of Kings or their Children. This beautiful Pillar is erected upon a Pedestal of red Marble, and set off with three Statues of Brass representing three Virtues. The Sword Royal of which the Con∣stable hath the Charge with the other Marquess of that Dignity are also here represented in Marble. You may here read certain Inscriptions in French Verse, which at that time were much esteemed but I have omitted to insert them in this Work, they
<PB N="137" REF="74"/>
being not at all of the Gust of this Age. This Monument is one of the most beautiful and sin∣gular that is to be seen, the work of the Pillar is exquisite, and it is said that the Sculptor was more than fifteen years in making it. The Body of this great Constable is in the Church of <HI>Mont∣morency,</HI> four Leagues from <HI>Paris,</HI> where hath been raised for him one of the stateliest Mau∣soleums of all the Kingdom, of which we may say more hereafter.</P>
<P>In the middle of this Chappel stands the Tomb of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> for whom it was parti∣cularly erected, It hath nothing magnificent; only the representation of four persons in cum∣bent postures, namely of <HI>Lewis</HI> Duke of <HI>Orle∣ans,</HI> who was murdered; and of <HI>Valentine</HI> his Wife, who died two years after her Husband of Grief and Sorrow, having done her utmost en∣deavours to be revenged upon the Duke of <HI>Bur∣gundy</HI> for his Treachery, by drawing into her quarrel the Dauphin <HI>Charles,</HI> tho against his own Mother, and the Parliament who cited the Duke to appear personally before them. The Clergy and the University did commiserate her Sorrows, and did their endeavours, tho unsuccessfully, to comfort her. <HI>France</HI> is obliged to this Princess for that incontestable Right she hath to the Dutchy of <HI>Millain,</HI> which she brought by her Marriage with the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> from whom <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. and <HI>Francis</HI> I descended. She was daughter of <HI>John Galeas</HI> Duke of <HI>Millain,</HI> who left two Sons, but both dying without issue Male, this Princess became Presumptive Heir to that Dutchy. Near her Statue are engraved those Ver∣ses,</P>
<Q><PB N="138" REF="75"/>
<L>Quae mulier Ducis Insubrii pulcherrima proles;</L>
<L>Jus Mediolani, Sceptraque dote dedit.</L></Q>
<Q><L>The Heiress here of <HI>Millains</HI> Duke you have,</L>
<L>Who for her Dowry the whole Dutchy gave.</L></Q>
<P>The two other Figures lying on each side upon this Tomb are, that of <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> eldest Son of him we mentioned before, and Fa∣ther of <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. and that of <HI>Philip</HI> Earl of <HI>Vertus,</HI> his Brother, who died unmarried. All these four Figures are of Marble, and were caused to be made by the pious care of <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. who for the mildness of his Reign and the great fa∣vour and love which he had for his Subjects does merit to be called <HI>the Father of his People,</HI> a Title the more illustrious, by reason that the Empe∣ror <HI>Augustus</HI> and the greatest Kings of the Earth were ambitious to deserve it. At one end of this Tomb, next the Altar, is placed the heart of <HI>Henry</HI> II. in an Urn of Brass gilt, held up by three Vertues upon their heads, which Statues are of Marble, and the best sort of <HI>Germain Pi∣ton's</HI> Work. Men of Judgment admire this Piece for the Beauty of the Design. And it is said that a curious Person of the last Age offered to give for it 10000 Crowns and a Copy of the same to be made as exactly as could be and placed in the Room. The Pedestal of these three Figures, which properly speaking are but one, is triangu∣lar like a <HI>Tripos.</HI> They are as big as the Life, of one Block of Marble, and hold together by the hands. Their Drapery and the air of their heads, is admirable. One may easily perceive by this
<PB N="139" REF="75"/>
that the past age did equal ours in delicate Work∣manship, and Beauty of Design.</P>
<P>At the other end is the heart of <HI>Francis</HI> II. on a high Pillar of white Marble. Flames seem to issue out at the top, about this Pillar are three Cupids with their Torches reverst and extinguish∣ed. This is raised upon a Pedestal of Porphyry, on the sides of which are certain Inscriptions, among others one that says that this King marri∣ed <HI>Mary Stuart,</HI> who was beheaded in <HI>England</HI> through the Jealousie of <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> He died at <HI>Orleans, Decemb.</HI> 10. 1560. being but sixteen years of Age. The heart of Charles IX. his Brother, who died at <HI>Vincennes</HI> on <HI>Whit-sunday</HI> in the year 1572. is also in the same Monument.</P>
<P>Along the Wall on the right hand, is the Tomb of a Princess, who was sister to <HI>Valentine</HI> of <HI>Milain;</HI> that of the Admiral <HI>Chabot,</HI> the Work∣manship of <HI>Paul Ponce,</HI> whose Labours are migh∣tily esteemed; and that of one of the Princes of the House of <HI>Rohan.</HI> These two last Tombs tho of a different sort, are very beautiful, and the Effigies of those who are there interred are well designed. Near the door which leads out of this Chappel into the Nave of the Church, stands a great Pillar of white Marble full of Cyphers and Sculptures, and belongs to the illustrious House of <HI>Cossé-Brissac,</HI> as appears by the Epitaph. It was raised for <HI>Timoleon de Cossé-Brissac.</HI> But that which is most remarkable in this Chappel, and that which strikes the eye with most surprize, is the Curious Pyramid belonging to the house of <HI>Longueville,</HI> the Workman-ship of Monsieur <HI>de Augui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rre,</HI> in which are the hearts of several persons of that illustrious Family, it is adorned with Trophies and accompanied with four Vertues of
<PB N="140" REF="76"/>
White Marble. On the Pedestal are two Bas-reliefs gilt over, representing two of the most remarka∣ble Actions of the Duke of <HI>Longueville,</HI> for whom this Monument was erected at a very con∣siderable expence. You ought to observe the Picture over the Altar, it being done by <HI>Francis Salujati,</HI> a <HI>Boulonois,</HI> who was a famous Pain∣ter, and whose Works are much sought after in <HI>Italy.</HI> Behind this Chappel is another little one, which Monsieur the Marquess of <HI>Rostaing</HI> caused to be built, but in it there is nothing to invite the Curious. In the Nave of this Church is a Tomb belonging to the Ancestors of the Duke of <HI>Gesvres,</HI> where you will see some Statues of Marble, kneeling, in the habits of that Age, very well wrought, but more especially that of the Duke of <HI>Tremes,</HI> his Father. In one of the Chappels is the Monument of Monsieur <HI>de la Tremoüille,</HI> and over against that the Tomb of Monsieur <HI>Zamet,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Langres,</HI> on one side of which you may see the Monument of <HI>Ca∣rolus Magnus;</HI> he is represented sitting and lean∣ing his head on his left arm. This is the Work of <HI>Paul Ponce</HI> a famous Sculptor, as we have already said. In that Chappel where you see the Tomb of the Duke <HI>de la Tremoüille,</HI> there is over the Altar a very curious piece of a <HI>Magdelain</HI> done by <HI>Mignard,</HI> Nephew of <HI>Peter Mignard</HI> whom we have formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>In the house it self there is nothing of Curio∣sity. These Fathers have begun a great Building of late time, which is now almost finished, where∣in they will be extreme conveniently lodged. Their Gardens are handsom enough, in one of which near the Vineyard, you may see a Grotto of Shell-work, which is committed to the care
<PB N="141" REF="76"/>
of one of the younger Monks. The Cabinet of Father <HI>Augereau,</HI> in the little Garden adjoyning, deserves to be seen; there are some good Pictures, and curious Prints. This Father is very skilfull in these matters, but he hath not the opportuni∣ty of making any great Collection. These Monks are very regular, and never eat any flesh, unless they be sick, or happen to be above two leagues from home. They observe much the same Rule with the <HI>Cistercians,</HI> being a branch of that Or∣der.</P>
<P>Near this, on the edg of the River is the <HI>Hôtel de Fieubet</HI> belonging to Monsieur <HI>Fieubet,</HI> Coun∣sellor of State in Ordinary, and Chancellor to the deceased Queen. He caused it to be built about three or four years ago. One can hardly desire a neater house than this both within and without. The Stair-case is very light and adorn∣ed with Busts between the Windows. The apart∣ments are contrived in <HI>enfilade</HI> as the mode is at present; on one side they look into the Garden, and on the other side upon the River. The Furniture is of the same neatness, as well in the Rooms above Stairs as below. The great piece of Perspective on the adjoyning wall is very fine; it is painted in <HI>Fresco</HI> with a great deal of fancy. It represents a Building composed of two great Arches, between which are some Pillars and a Statue of an Hero between them. Over all there is a Sun-dial, about which are placed several Fi∣gures, among others a Woman pulling Feathers out of a Cocks tail to point out the hours upon a Tablet, and Time over her head seems to approve the Action. All the Work keeps its Colours ve∣ry well, which is not usual in Paintings exposed to the injuries of the Air, which last but a short
<PB N="142" REF="77"/>
time, especially in <HI>Paris</HI> where the Air is very moist in Winter, and the driness of the Summer very great, in such sort that it is difficult for any Plaister to defend it self against these extremities. This is the Work of Monsieur <HI>Rousseau,</HI> who did that at Monsieur <HI>Poüange</HI>'s.</P>
<P>In the same Row you have the <HI>Hôtel de la Vie∣ville,</HI> whose entrance is but dark, yet is the in∣side capacious and convenient enough.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church of St. Paul</HI> which is the Parish Church of this Quarter, is in the Street that runs along near the last mentioned Hôtel. Formerly this Church was the Parish Church of the Kings house while the Court remained at the <HI>Palais des Tournelles.</HI> It was built, as is to be seen, in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VI.</P>
<P>As you go towards the Isle of <HI>Nostre-Dame</HI> you come again <HI>to the Convent of the Nuns of the Ave-Maria</HI> in the <HI>Rüe des Barrieres.</HI> They are of St. <HI>Clares</HI> Order. St. <HI>Lewis</HI> had former∣ly placed in this house certain <HI>Beguines,</HI> which were Nuns of the Order of St. <HI>Begue,</HI> a <HI>Fleming</HI> by extraction. They wore a Coif that hid almost all their Face, But in the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. Queen <HI>Charlotte</HI> introduced the third Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> with the Reform, and her Son King <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. built for the Friers, the house ad∣joyning, separated only by the passage that leads to the Church. There is not in all <HI>Paris</HI> any Con∣vent of Nuns who live more austere than these. They never eat any Flesh, nor wear any Linnen, and besides that, they rise at midnight, and go continually barefoot without Sandals or Stockings, with a strict observance of a perpetual Silence. Nor can we find in any Convent a greater Stock of Vir∣tue, and more disesteem and neglect of secular
<PB N="143" REF="77"/>
affairs. These good Nuns never think of the World but when they pray to God to forgive the disorders which are committed in it. And as they have no other Subsistence than by Alms, so have they no other trust than to the Divine Providence, which is never wanting; <HI>Paris</HI> containing so great a number of Pious People, by whose Charity they are maintained. Seldom or never are any permitted to speak with them; so that in the midst of <HI>Paris</HI> they are as much retired from the World as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>if in the darkest solitude. On this ac∣count you very rarely see my Coaches at their Gate. At such times as they are obliged to speak to their nearest Relations, it must be in the Church, they having not throughout their whole house any other <HI>Parloir</HI> or speaking Room. The Tomb of the illustrious Ancestors of Monsieur the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who have been con∣cerned with honour in the greatest Employments, stands in a Chappel belonging to this Church.</P>
<P>A little further is <HI>the Hôtel de Sens</HI> with an old Gothick Gate but handsom enough. For∣merly the Arch-Bishops of that City, who were Metropolitans of <HI>Paris,</HI> resided here. But under the Pontificate of <HI>Ʋrban</HI> VIII. <HI>Paris</HI> having been dismembred from that Arch Bishoprick this Hotel hath been since let out to several parti∣cular persons who pay their Rents to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Sens.</HI></P>
<P>After this you pass over the Bridge called <HI>Pont-Marie,</HI> to go into the Isle <HI>de Nostre-Dame.</HI> Ob∣serve as you go that this Bridge is not so full of Houses as it might be, in regard that in <HI>March</HI> 1657. the River being extraordinarily overflown, it carried away two Arches n the night time, to a very great loss both of Persons and Goods,
<PB N="144" REF="78"/>
which perished miserably. This Bridg took its name from the undertaker of the Work in the year 1614 who was called <HI>Marie.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Isle of <HI>Nostre-Dame.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Isle of <HI>Nostre-Dame</HI> takes its name from the Church of <HI>Paris</HI> to which it belongs as part of their Estate. All the houses which we see there at present are the work of this Age. It was formerly a Meadow ground where people of all sorts used to walk to take the Air, in the middle of which place stood a small Chappel Dedicated to St. <HI>Lewis.</HI> At present it is all compassed about with a Key of Free-stone very firm, and filled with very handsom houses, among which there are some most magnifick, and which may be compared with the most beautiful Palaces; espe∣cially those which are situated at the corner on the East side, where the <HI>Seine</HI> divides it self into two Arms to make the Isle. The Streets are strait, and all end upon the edge of the River.</P>
<P>The first house which ought to be observed on the side of <HI>Pont-Marie,</HI> is that of Monsieur <HI>de Grand-Maison,</HI> which appears to be solidly built, and whose inside is extreme handsom. As you pass further, you come to the house of Monsieur <HI>Lambert de Terigny</HI> President of the Chamber of Accounts, whose chief Entrance is from the <HI>Rüe St. Louis</HI> which crosses the Isle from one end to the other. This House is magnifick in all its parts, the Gate is great and high, and the Lock∣smiths Work is very extraordinary. But this is not that which is most observable. The four
<PB N="145" REF="78"/>
sides of the Court are adorned each with a Front of admirable Buildings set off with great Io∣nick Pilasters, which reach from the Ground to the top of the Fabrick, with Vases upon the tops. The Staircase is placed at the bottom of the Court, with two Ranks of Pillars, directly over which the light falls full upon the Steps, without the least obstacle. The first Apartment is composed of several Chambers one beyond another, from all which you have a delicate prospect upon the River on the Garden side in such sort that in a clear day one may see six or seven Leagues into the Country, which is a very considerable plea∣sure. In these Apartments you may see some Cieling-pieces of the best sort of Painting, espe∣cially in the last Chamber, which is all of <HI>le Sueur</HI>'s work, who in an age but very little ad∣vanced gave great hopes in time to equal the best Painters of <HI>Italy,</HI> as one may perceive by the last Pictures which he made. Those things of his which are to be seen in this house are the best that ever he did, chiefly the Paintings in the <HI>Alcove</HI> representing the Muses in a Consort of Musick, the Cieling-piece is almost of equal Beauty. The Moveables of this Apartment are extreme rich. From thence you ought to go into the Gallery which is on the same Floor. All that is devised ordinarily to adorn the fairest Galleries may be found in this, gilding upon Sculpture curiously wrought, with a Ceiling enriched with Pictures of the best Masters, among which are several of <HI>le Sueur,</HI> of whom I spoke before, which one may easily distinguish from the rest, although those which are not of his hand are not however to be neglected, being very well paint∣ed.
<PB N="146" REF="79"/>
The door, by which you enter into this Gal∣lery, is sustained on the inside with two Corin∣thian Pillars all over gilt, the sides are almost of the same fashion, with Païsages and Pilasters of the same Order, between which are placed Busts of Marble upon Tables of the same; the end of the Room does determine in a little Terrase in manner of a Balcony, which commands all over the River. The Apartments below are not so well adorned, tho they also have their Beauties. In the Garden are to be seen some Statues handsom enough. And you ought not to forget to see the Orangerie, which in Winter is in a Hall, where one may walk about very conveniently. Near to which place there is another, separated only by a great partition that is glased, through which one has the pleasure in the midst of Winter to see the Vertue of the Orange-trees. The face of the house on the Garden side is of the same Symmetry and Order of Building with that in the Court, which thing gives this house an air of grandeur at a great distance, and which shews extremely fine as one comes to <HI>Paris</HI> by Water from <HI>Charenton.</HI> Near this is</P>
<P>The house of Monsieur <HI>de Bretonvilliers,</HI> another President in the Chamber of Ac∣counts. This house is yet better situated than that of which I have been speaking, in regard it stands upon the very point of the Isle, and the River is on both sides of it. It is also much more great and spacious. The Masonry tho it be of no set Order of Architecture because of the many Ornaments that are there placed, is notwithstand∣ing extreme handsom to the eye. The Stair-case is on the left hand in one of the Corners of the
<PB N="147" REF="79"/>
Court: built with much solidity as is all the rest of the house; there has been no sparing of Vaults in those places where there appeared any occasion. This house is truely great and contains in it all things necessary for the entertainment of a great Lord. The outward Court is parted from the rest in such manner as it cannot cause the least inconvenience. As to the beauty and delights of the inside they are more considerable than that of which I treated last, in regard its Prospect is farther extended, and that it seems from the Windows of this House that all the Boats that come continually to <HI>Paris,</HI> are coming to land at its door, and here it is that they separate on the one side or the other, to go either to the <HI>Port St. Paul</HI> or to the <HI>Port de la Tournelle,</HI> where usually they unload their Burthens. The mova∣bles are magnisick; consisting of Beds most rich∣ly embroidered, Chenets, Tables, Sconces, Look∣ing-glasses, and Ornaments for the Chimneys of Goldsmiths work, of Tapistry heighthened with Gold and Silver; all things are there in abundance. The Pictures are also of the best sort, since they are of Monsieur <HI>le Bruns</HI> hand, who is at present the chief Painter of the Kingdom. The Gallery which is on the left hand is all of his Work, the sides of which, instead of Wainscot are coverd with Paintings in fresquo, such as employ the Curious a long time in beholding them, who take a mighty pleasure to discover in these pieces that which they usually seek for in <HI>Italy</HI> with so much concern and pains. The Apartments below Stairs are very pleasant. There are Baths, and a Hall extreme convenient for Summer, by reason of that fresh air which is there gathered. In fine,
<PB N="148" REF="80"/>
nothing is wanting in this house, and one may find there all the conveniences that can be desired of what sort soever; he who caused it to be built having not spared the greatest of expenses to ren∣der it such as it is.</P>
<P>Leaving this house we ought to pass along the Key called <HI>Quay Dauphin,</HI> otherwise, the Key of Balcones, almost all the Houses that are built here having Balcones before the Window, among the rest one ought to be observed more especially, which is that in which at present dwells Monsieur the Abbot of St. <HI>Croix,</HI> Master of Requests, it was built with much care, by the deceased Monsieur <HI>Hesselin,</HI> who was one of the most curious per∣sons of his time, and it was designed by the Sieur <HI>le Veau.</HI> The Front is of a very handsom design, without crowding in of insignificant Ornaments. And on the inside there are very beautiful Ciel∣ings, with Chimney-pieces of the best sort of Workmanship. The Court is in truth a little too obscure, but this defect is advantagiously repaired by the Symmetry of the Building on that side, and by the curious prospect from thence.</P>
<P>Near this is the house of Monsieur <HI>Roulier,</HI> the Stair-case of which is extreme handsom, it is sup∣ported with Ionick Pillars and adorned with Bas-reliese. The face on the side of the Court is embellished with Architecture handsom to per∣fection. It was built by Monsieur <HI>de Alisi.</HI> Having seen this House we ought next to go to</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> tho it be not yet finished. That which is begun is of a very fine sort of Architecture. The Porta is supported with Dorick Pillars. And when this Church is com∣pleated it will deserve to be compared to the best
<PB N="149" REF="80"/>
of the kind, for the design and regularity with which it is carried on. The <HI>Sieur du Vau</HI> gave the first design. M. <HI>Champagne</HI> an able Painter, being Churchwarden, hath the care of the Orna∣naments of the Architecture there, and Monsieur <HI>le Duc</HI> hath carried on the Work in such manner as we now see it.</P>
<P>Leaving the Isle <HI>Nostre-Dame</HI> we go over the Bridge <HI>de la Tournelle,</HI> built of Free-stone, after the same Model with that of <HI>Pont-Neuf;</HI> it hath two ways raised on each side, for the conveniency of those that walk over on foot. As you pass forward you see on the left hand</P>
<P>St. <HI>Bernard</HI>'s Gate, embellished also some years since, after the designs of Monsieur <HI>Blondel:</HI> on each side are placed great Bas-reliess that fill up both the Fronts. On that side that faces the Town the King is represented pouring out plenty upon his Subjects; and on the Attique over head, we read this Inscription</P>
<Q>LUDOVICO MAGNO ABUNDANTIA <LB/> PARTA. <LB/> PRAEF. ET AEDIL. PONI C C. <LB/> ANN. R. S. H. MDCLXX.</Q>
<Q>To <HI>LEWIS</HI> the Great <LB/>For the great plenty, the Praefect and Aediles caused this to be erected in the year from the Redemption of the World, <HI>1670.</HI></Q>
<P><PB N="150" REF="81"/>
On the other side which fronts the <HI>Faux∣bourg</HI> the King is represented Apparelled in man∣ner of the Ancient Gods, holding the Helm of a great Ship under full Sail, with this Inscription,</P>
<Q LANG="lat">LUDOVICI PROVIDENTIAE MAGNI PRAEF. <LB/> ET AEDIL. PONI C C. <LB/> ANN. R. S. H. MDCLXX.</Q>
<Q>To the Providence of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great, The Praefect and Aediles caused this to be erected in the year from the Redemption of the World, <HI>1670.</HI></Q>
<P>Along the River side among the Wharss and Wood-yards, there is one Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of a private Per∣son very handsomly built. It is composed of two Pavilions or Arms, with the main building in the middle in which the Stair-case is placed that communicates to both ends. The house hath a very good face on the Court-side, and looks to∣wards the Fields, which renders the Prospect ex∣treme pleasing. The Apartments are very com∣modious and adorned with Wainscot gilt, and Marbled of divers colours. This House is the handsomest of all this Quarter.</P>
<P>By the Street called <HI>Rue de Seine</HI> which passes close to the Walls of this House, you may go to</P>

<PB N="151" REF="81"/>
<HEAD>St. <HI>Victor's.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This is a famous Abby of Canons regular of the Order of St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> of which Monsieur <HI>de Coislin,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Orleans,</HI> chief Almoner to the King, and Brother of the Duke of <HI>Coislin,</HI> is Abbot. This Abby is very ancient, of such An∣tiquity that we are not well assured of the time of its first Foundation. We know only that King <HI>Lewis</HI> the Gross in the year 1113. caused a great Church to be built in this place, where was be∣fore but a very little Chappel: and we read in the Church-History of <HI>Paris,</HI> that <HI>Thomas de Cham∣peaux</HI> Canon of <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> and a famous Pro∣fessor of Theology, having a difference with one of his Disciples named <HI>Abaillard,</HI> retired with some of his Scholars to a place near the little Chappel of St. <HI>Victor,</HI> and that he took the habit of a Chanon Regular, which possibly might be the Original of this Abby, which from that time did always encrease more and more. This happened about the year 1105. The Quarrel between this <HI>Thomas de Champeaux</HI> and the said <HI>Abaillard</HI> is much spoken of in the Histories of that time, and there are many very remarkable passages in it which notwithstanding are not proper to be re∣ported in this Work.</P>
<P>That which is the most curious thing to be seen in this Abby is the Library, which is very nu∣merous and full of the best sort of Books that can be met with. There are also Manuscripts in the great Cabinet at the further end. It hath been considerably augmented by Monsieur <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣chet,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="82"/>
Counsellor in the Parliament, on condition that it be publick for all sorts of Persons oftener than it was before, which has made it of migh∣ty advantage and wonderfully frequented by the Studious, who may come three times a Week, <HI>Monday, Wednesday,</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> and remain there all day long if they please. It is the only Library of all <HI>Paris</HI> that is open in this manner, but we hope in time there will be others in that City that will yield the like profit. In the other parts of this house we find nothing very curious. There is in the Church here great Devotion to our Lady of Succour, and to St. <HI>Clair,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Autun,</HI> who is invoked for sore Eyes. Among the Monks of St. <HI>Victor</HI> there are many Learned Persons, some of which are Monsieur <HI>de Santeüil,</HI> almost the only man in <HI>France</HI> who understands to make Inscriptions in Verse for publick Monu∣ments, he is of an extraordinary ability in this Science and all things of this nature which we see come from him, are intirely fine. <HI>Hugh</HI> of St. <HI>Victor</HI> a famous Divine was also of this house.</P>
<P>After you have seen the Abby of St. <HI>Victor</HI> you ought to go to the Kings Garden; in the way thither you pass by</P>
<P>The Hospital of Pity, which is a Limb of the great Hospital general; in which they harbour a great number of young Boys and Girls, whom they imploy in divers sorts of Work, more espe∣cially the Girls who make Point of <HI>France,</HI> from which the House does easily draw a Profit suffici∣ent to maintaian them.</P>

<HEAD>The Kings Garden.</HEAD>
<P>This Garden is filled with nothing but Medici∣nal Plants of most choice sorts, which are there nourished and looked after at the Kings Charges. Certain Months in the Year, here are <HI>Botanick</HI> Le∣ctures, to the hearing of which any one may be admitted freely. There is a Doctor of Pyhsick who hath a Sallary for this purpose, and who is ordinarily more eminent than the rest for his Learning. This Lecture is made at six of the Clock in the morning, in those parts of the Gar∣den where the several Simples grow. One ought to observe that half this Garden is taken up by a Mount or eminent Ground, round which they have made an Ally which mounts about it in a Spiral Line, which Ally has on the outward edge a Palisade of Bushes, on the top of this Mount is an Accacias from whence you have a Prospect over the River and <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> St. <HI>Antoine.</HI> On the left hand as you come into the Court, is a La∣boratory, where they also work publickly in Chy∣mistry during certain months in the year. The Compositions which they make there are given freely to such poor that need 'em.</P>
<P>But that which is the greatest Curiosity of all is the Cabinet of Monsieur <HI>du Vernay</HI> one of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and one of the prime Men of the Kingdom for Dissections and Anato∣my. Few People ever made a farther progress than he in this sort of operation, in which he hath made a great number of Discoveries, that
<PB N="154" REF="83"/>
have gained him a mighty Reputation. In Win∣ter he reads publickly in the great Hall, which is contrived in manner of an Amphitheatre, that may contain abundance of People. Monsieur <HI>Da∣quin</HI> the Kings chief Physitian hath the oversight and the administration of this Garden; he ap∣points the Doctors in Physick and Chirurgery who read the Lectures of Chymistry and Dissection, and he hath a Pension from the King for this pur∣pose. The Superintendant of the Buildings is the absolute Master here, and it is under his Autho∣rity that all these things are transacted. Leaving this place you may go to</P>
<P>The Hospital-general; altho for delicate peo∣ple it is no very pleasing object to see the poor, yet it is a curious thing, and surprising at the same time, to see so great a number of all sorts and ages, whose miseries are eased with so much care and Charity, that nothing is wanting to them but only Liberty. This great Building which contains in it more than six thousand persons, ap∣pears as you come in like a little Town, by rea∣son of the quantity and diversity of the houses, although it be all the Work of this age, and all the poor People that are in it are maintained upon Charity only. The Church was built not above seven or eight years ago: It is of a very peculiar design; a great Dome of eight Angles raised up∣on Arches, against each of which are placed eight Naves or spaces to contain all the poor people. The Altar is contrived just in the middle under the Dome, so that it may be seen on eight sides for the conveniency of all. There is nothing mag∣nificent in the Work, except only the Portico by which people enter from abroad, which is sup∣ported
<PB N="155" REF="83"/>
by certain Ionick Pillars, over which is placed a small Attick, but this is of no extraor∣dinary relish however. On the two sides of this Entrance are placed two Pavilions where are lodg∣ed the Ecclesiasticks who serve the Chappel, and administer the Sacraments to the poor People. It is observable that they imploy here all the young girls of the Hospital, who are very numerous, in making point of <HI>France,</HI> some embroider, others make the Loops, others the Ground, which causes much work to be dispatched by their hands in a little time, of which is made a considerable in∣come. The first President <HI>de Belliévre</HI> was one of those who were most active in the Foundation of this great Hospital, which at that time was thought incredible; and this was done on the ac∣count of that excessive number of Poor which were continually about the Streets and Churches of <HI>Paris,</HI> to the great incommodity of the Pub∣lick. In the mean time this Illustrious Magistrate being assisted by the Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> the Dutchess of <HI>Aiguillon,</HI> and some others, persons of Authority, accomplished his design, and caused all those to be shut up in this Hospital who were found begging, or who were not able to get their Living.</P>
<P>Almost over against the Gate of this Hospital, in a large place, is kept the Horse-Market on the <HI>Wednesday</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI> in every Week.</P>

<HEAD>Les Gobelins.</HEAD>
<P>This House is almost behind the <HI>Faux-bourg</HI> of Saint <HI>Marcel.</HI> Here it is that the Curious ought to apply themselves with their utmost diligence to observe all the Rarities that are to be seen in this place, in regard there is no part of <HI>Europe</HI> that produces so many. But to give you a juster Idea, I shall make a Description.</P>
<P>First of all, it is not unuseful to observe that this place has been always inhabited by excellent Artists: and that heretofore it was imploy∣ed by the famous Dyers of Wood, the first of which was one <HI>Giles Goblin,</HI> who, as report says, found out the secret of dying the best Scarlet, or at least that he first brought it to <HI>Paris,</HI> from whence it comes that ever since it hath been cal∣led Scarlet <HI>des Gobelines.</HI> This House hath still kept the old name as well as the little River that runs behind it, which Water hath a peculiar Ver∣tue for the dying of this Colour, and before that time it was called the River of <HI>Bieure.</HI> The Dutch have made it their utmost endeavour to discover this secret, but they could never do it with all their industry and expence, however they come pretty near, but they cannot arrive to that Degree of perfection, which our Dyers have in making this Beautiful colour, which makes so great a Merchan∣dize through all <HI>Europe,</HI> nay in a manner through the whole World, for much goes into the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> But not to say more of this house and River called the <HI>Gobelins,</HI> let us now
<PB N="157" REF="84"/>
speak of the things that are there to be seen. It is to be observed that all the Artists that work here are employed only for the King, and that their Works which they perform here are for the Decoration and Ornament of the Royal Palaces. Some years since the number of the Workmen was much greater than at present; but the pro∣digious quantity of Work which they did is the oc∣casion that they are now much retrenched, in re∣gard the Repositories where the Kings moveables are kept are sufficiently filled, in such sort that one may say at this time there is no Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> that hath more Goldsmiths work or Tapistry.</P>
<P>The first thing that is to be viewed are the Pi∣ctures, which are, in a manner, all of the hand of famous Monsieur <HI>le Brun,</HI> the ablest Painter of <HI>France,</HI> and whose Works are so much sought after and admired by all those who are skilled in Painting. As a reward for whose great pains which he is continually engaged in, and for the Emulation of those who have any Genius in de∣signing, the King hath been pleased not only to give him large Pensions, to declare him Overseer of all the Works in Painting and Sculpture which are done for him, and to name him Director of the Academy-Royal of Painting, but he hath al∣so ennobled him by his Letters Patents. The Principal Pieces of this excellent Master are at <HI>Versailles.</HI> The great Stair-case is almost all of his hand, and he is working at present in the great Gallery, which takes up all that side that looks upon the Garden. In the Louvre there are also divers Cieling-pieces of his design. In the Church of <HI>Nôtre-dame</HI> are two Pieces, one re∣presents the Martyrdom of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> the other
<PB N="158" REF="85"/>
the Crucisying of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> both which Pieces are in the Quire on each side of the high Altar, and which one may easily distinguish from other Pictures, at the <HI>Carmelites</HI> in the <HI>Faux-bourg</HI> St. <HI>Jacques.</HI> The second great Piece which re∣presents a <HI>Magdelain</HI> at the feet of our Saviour in the House of <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Leper,</HI> is of his hand, so also another Piece of the same Saint, in one of the Chappels of the same Church, which was much admired by the Queen Mother, who began first from the sight of this Piece to have an esteem for M. <HI>le Brun,</HI> whom soon after she made known at Court by the means of the Chancel∣lor <HI>Seguier,</HI> by whom he was mightily esteemed. Most of the Works which are wrought in the <HI>Gobelins</HI> are of his design, and it is he that or∣ders the Performance. His Cabinet is one of the most curious that can be seen; in which he has collected the Paintings of the most excellent Masters that have been, and several other rare Pie∣ces which have a Relation to Painting. I will say one thing more to the Glory of M. <HI>le Brun</HI> that he hath under him several other Painters who do nothing else but Copy his Draughts and work after his Designs.</P>
<P>The second thing which one ought to see in this Place, is the Tapistry Works. Among that great number of Artists that work here in this Manufacture, there are some <HI>Flemings,</HI> who are equal to the most Renowned of the last age at <HI>Anvers.</HI> Nothing can be seen finer than what comes from their hands, be it in History or Land∣skip, in both which Gold and Silver are imploy∣ed even to profusion, and they have some pieces there that are all over heighthned after that man∣ner.
<PB N="159" REF="85"/>
When we have well examind these things we must conclude that there is no part of the World where they make better Work, or better understand the perfect way of Shadowing the Wool. It is however Monsieur <HI>le Brun,</HI> who gives them the Designs, and for the most part they Copy his Paintings. Of late they have also copied some of the best things of <HI>Poussin,</HI> (the greatest man of our age without contradiction) among others, the little <HI>Moses</HI> which they had from the Cabinet of the lately deceased Madam <HI>Lescot:</HI> The Rock in the Wilderness with the Fountain of Waters flowing from it, which be∣longed to the deceased Monsieur <HI>Dreux</HI> Coun∣sellor of the great Council, and two other Pictures from the Cabinet of Monsieur the <HI>Chevalier de Lorraine,</HI> one of which represents the passage through the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and the other the Worship of the Golden Calf. They have made also many Pieces from <HI>Raphael</HI> and <HI>Michael Angelo.</HI> But one of their most beautiful and curious things is the History of the King represented in divers Pieces, of which subject may be made divers Suits of Hangings, in which are contained the principal Actions of his Life, as the Battels he hath gained, the Towns he hath taken, the Ceremonies of his Marriage, the renovation of the Alliance with the Deputies of the thirteen Cantons of <HI>Swisses,</HI> and many other Passages of such like nature, the Borders of these Pieces have the Ground-work of Gold, with Grotesques, and several Devices and Cyphers at the Corners and in the middle which things are of coloured Silk, and shew delicately upon the Gold ground. The Sieur <HI>Gens</HI> and <HI>le Fevre</HI> have the oversight and direction of
<PB N="160" REF="86"/>
those who work at that sort of Tapistry which is called the high Lists, and the Sieurs <HI>Mozin</HI> and <HI>de la Croix,</HI> those who work at the low Lists.</P>
<P>After you have seen the Tapistries you ought to see the place where they carve and engrave up∣on Copper and Brass for Closets and such like matters. It is here that they made those curious Locks that are to be seen at <HI>Versailles,</HI> and the <HI>Louvre,</HI> which are wrought with such delicate Workmanship.</P>
<P>In the first Court through which you pass to see the things of which we have been speaking, you ought not to forget to visit the houses of <HI>le Sieur Loir</HI> and <HI>le Sieur Villiers,</HI> two famous Goldsmiths, who are imployed continually for the King: You will find often under their hands Works of mighty value. Here it was where they made those two Balusters for the Alcove, which are at <HI>Versailles</HI> before the Kings Bed, and the Queens. One may know of what Beauty, Workmanship, and Riches they are, since the price of each amounted to two hundred thousand Crowns. They are all of solid Silver without any thing to help out, either within the Pede∣stals or Rails, other than the thickness of the metal it self, which has been employed with Pro∣fusion.</P>
<P>Near the Goldsmiths, in the same Court on the right hand, you may find certain Works of an extraordinary nature performed by the <HI>Sieur Branquier,</HI> and the <HI>Sieur Ferdinand de Meliori,</HI> who were both invited out of <HI>Italy</HI> to make here a kind of <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work; which will cost much time and expence. They are a sort of Pictures, the different colours of which are made of inlaid
<PB N="161" REF="86"/>
Stones, which represent Figures extreme like, and very well designed. These Pieces are most commonly composed of <HI>Agate, Lapis Lazuli, Jacinth,</HI> and <HI>Cornelian,</HI> which makes a colour∣ing more lively and brillant than ordinary Paint∣ing, which Stones are joyned together with a sort of <HI>Mastick</HI> very hard. They are ordinarily placed upon Ebony Cabinets, or Tables of great price. At the habitation of one of these Artists there is a little Garden behind his house, which is very pretty and in which are divers Ornaments of artificial Rocks and Shell-work.</P>
<P>After you have examined these things, you re∣turn by the same way to visit other Curiosities that are to be seen in another Court. There are two Workhouses for Carvers and Statuaries, the one of which is governed by the <HI>Sieur Baptiste,</HI> in which is the Statue of Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> in white Marble, which is to be placed at St. <HI>De∣nis</HI> upon the Tomb which the King hath there caused to be raised for him; here is also a great Muse, bigger than the life, of excellent Work∣manship, which is intended to be placed at <HI>Ver∣sailles</HI> with divers other Statues of the same big∣ness. The other Workhouse is governed by the <HI>Sieur Coesvau,</HI> who for the most part works af∣ter the life. He hath made several Busts and other Figures of representation. This is he that made the Kings Bust which stands in the great Stair-case at <HI>Versailles.</HI></P>
<P>After this you ought to see the Embroiderers, who are in a Hall near which you pass to go to the great Court. They are employed upon di∣vers Pieces, in which the richness of the materi∣als does most commonly vie with the beauty of the Work.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="87"/>
Near this place here are still two Statuaries more in two Low Rooms, where you may see some Pieces in Marble and some in Lead for the Fountains at <HI>Versailles.</HI> Besides those things al∣ready described, there are many other Curiosities in this great House, which the Curious may ob∣serve, and which would be too long to treat of in particular. We have already said that here are all sorts of excellent Artists who have been invi∣ted hither from different Parts. Among whom we ought not to forget M. <HI>Audrean,</HI> one of the ablest Gravers of his time: he hath etcht and gra∣ved all the great Pieces of M. <HI>le Brun,</HI> as the Triumph of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, the Battel of <HI>Maxentius,</HI> all the History of <HI>Alexander,</HI> in five great Pieces, and divers other things of that great Painter. All that comes from his hand, is of a singular beauty, and most exact design, the most correct that can be: which occasions that all his Work sells much dearer than others, nay often∣times it is difficult to get them at any rate in re∣gard all the best Proofs are reserved for the Kings Cabinet. He hath also graved several Pieces from the famous <HI>Poussin,</HI> which all Curious Persons treasure up in their Closets. The Sieur <HI>le Clere</HI> dwells here also who is very able and well esteem∣ed in this Art. And these are the most curious things at the House called <HI>les Gobelins.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we return again into the Town by the <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> St. <HI>Marcel,</HI> and we pass before the Church of that name, which was first found∣ed by <HI>Roland</HI> Earl of <HI>Blare</HI> Nephew of <HI>Charle∣magne,</HI> who was a great Benefactor to it, in con∣ferring great Priviledges upon the Canons who served there. This Church did heretofore bear
<PB N="163" REF="87"/>
the title of S. <HI>Clement.</HI> But the Body of S. <HI>Marcel</HI> Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> being found here it took his name, which it hath kept ever since. The famous <HI>Peter Lombard,</HI> surnamed the Master of the Sentences, is here interred. And this is his Epitaph,</P>
<Q LANG="lat">Hic jacet Magister <HI>Petrus Lombardus, Parisi∣ensis</HI> Episcopus, qui composuit Librum Sen∣tentiarum, Glossas Psalmorum, &amp; Episto∣larum: cujus obitus lies est <HI>13.</HI> Cal. <HI>Au∣gusti</HI> Anno <HI>1164.</HI></Q>
<Q>Here lies Master <HI>Peter Lombard</HI> Bishop of <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> who composed the Book of Sentences, Glosses upon the Psalms and Epistles: the day of his death is the 13<HI>th.</HI> of the Calends of <HI>August.</HI> In the year 1164.</Q>
<P>There are also in this <HI>Fauxbourg,</HI> the <HI>Cordelier</HI> Nuns. Whose Convent was first built at <HI>Troyes</HI> by <HI>Thibaut</HI> VII. Earl of <HI>Champagne</HI> and of <HI>Brie,</HI> but they were removed to <HI>Paris</HI> soon af∣ter, because of the inconveniency of the place where they were first founded. <HI>Margaret de Provence</HI> Wife to St. <HI>Lewis</HI> caused the Church to be begun as we now see it, and <HI>Blanch</HI> her Daughter Widow of the King of <HI>Castile</HI> be∣came a Nun there, and gave a considerable Aug∣mentation to the Estate of this House, She built the Cloister where are yet remaining her Arms in several places. These Nuns observe the Rule of St. <HI>Francis</HI> somewhat nearer than the <HI>Cordelier</HI>

Friers of the great Convent in <HI>Paris;</HI> there is nothing of singular note in their Church, no more than in that of</P>
<P>St. <HI>Medard,</HI> the Parish-Church of this Quar∣ter; where there hapned in the last Age a furi∣ous Tumult, raised by the <HI>Calvinists</HI> who came flocking with Arms in hand to Massacre the Ca∣tholicks being then at <HI>Vespers;</HI> the cause pre∣tended was that the noise of the Bells of this Church did disturb them in hearing their Ser∣mon which at that time was in a house close by. But they were punished for their Rashness; for the Citizens taking Arms, killed all those that fell in their power. This was the first occasion of that hatred which the <HI>Parisians</HI> bear to those of the pretended Reformed Religion; and the Historians observe that from that time the <HI>Calvi∣nists</HI> threw off their Mask and went arm'd in the Streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> but the Catholicks not being able to endure this, it was the occasion of many Disorders which hapned afterwards.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Patru</HI> from whom we have a Vo∣lume of Pleadings extremely fine, is interred in this Church. Monsieur <HI>d'Ablencour</HI> had so great an esteem for his Judgment that on his death-bed he recommended his Works to his Correction.</P>
<P>In this Quarter near the little Church of S. <HI>Hippolytus,</HI> is an ancient house built in the time of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> which is not far from the River <HI>des Gobelins,</HI> where that good King would some∣times use to pass his hours of Solitude, in Prayer. It is said that under <HI>Charles</HI> VI. there happened here a very unhappy accident, which was partly the cause of the distraction with which that Prince was afflicted the greatest part of his Reign.
<PB N="165" REF="88"/>
The Story is thus reported. The <HI>Parisians,</HI> who always made it their glory passionately to love their King, being desirous to enter∣tain <HI>Charles</HI> VI. with a Ball in this house, upon his return from a great Victory which he had gained over the Revolted <HI>Flemings;</HI> The King was at this Entertainment with ma∣ny Lords disguised like Salvages, and apparelled in Linnen pitcht over and covered with Flax, like hair, and so close fitted to the Body that it seemed to be the natural skin; as he was dan∣cing with the young Lords one of the Company approaching too near, a Flambeau held by a Prince who was desirous to discover the King from the rest, it hapned that the Flame caught the Flax and burnt furiously; and they being all fastened to one another, the King could find no security but by casting himself all covered with Flames as he was, into the Arms of the Dutchess of <HI>Ber∣ry,</HI> who very happily being then present extin∣guished the Flame by covering him all over with her great Gown. The other Masquers were all either stifled or roasted alive and died within two days after, the King and <HI>Mantoüillet</HI> only escaping, which last cast himself headlong into a Tub of Water, which he hapned to light of not far from the place. After this sad accident <HI>Charles</HI> began to fall extreme Morose and Me∣lancholy, and the Idea of so great a peril prepared his brain for that madness which seized upon him near the Town of <HI>Mans,</HI> in such manner as is recorded by Monsieur <HI>de Mezeray.</HI> And this is all that is to be seen in this <HI>Fauxbourg.</HI></P>
<P>The Gates by which you go into the Town are two, that of St. <HI>Victor</HI> near the Abby of that
<PB N="166" REF="89"/>
name, of which Abby we have already spoken. This Gate was lately repaired but not with so great expence as the others. There is only re∣presented in Basse▪taille over the Arch, a great Ship of War, which are the Town Arms, with this Inscription beneath it,</P>
<Q LANG="lat">QUAE NON MARIA?</Q>
<Q>What Seas does she not Sail through?</Q>
<P>The other Gate is that of St. <HI>Marcel,</HI> behind St. <HI>Geneviéue du Mont.</HI></P>
<P>Near this on the <HI>Fosse</HI> between the two Gates lives Monsieur <HI>de Troyes,</HI> whose Pictures you ought not to sail of seeing. He was sent by the King into <HI>Bavaria</HI> to take the Picture of Ma∣dame the Dauphiness. Few Painters have been more successful than he after the Life. This hath attained him the Practice of most Persons of Quality, who cause themselves to be drawn by his hand.</P>
<P>We shall say nothing of the Convent of English Nuns, nor of the House of the Fathers of the Christian Doctrine, which are also upon the same Fosse, there being nothing curious about them to remark, unless it be one of the best Prospects that we can see, by reason of the high situation of the Place where these two houses stand.</P>

<HEAD>A New DESCRIPTION OF THE Most Remarkable Things IN PARIS. PART II.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Ʋniversity Quarter.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Quarter is one of the antientest and best Peopled of all <HI>Paris.</HI> It takes up a very great space of Ground, al∣most the fourth part of the Town. <HI>Philip Augustus,</HI> at such time as he went to <HI>Pa∣lestine,</HI> with <HI>Richard</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> against
<PB N="2" REF="90"/>
the <HI>Sarrazins,</HI> gave order that during his Jour∣ney (which lasted a whole Year) this Quar∣ter should be inclosed with Walls; some Remains of which one may perceive at this Day.</P>
<P>The University of <HI>Paris</HI> is so antient, that, as some hold, <HI>Charlemagne</HI> was its Founder. This o∣pinion is built upon certain old Titles, which are preserved with great care. Notwithstanding there are many Learned Men, who are of a con∣trary opinion; among others Monsieur <HI>Joli,</HI> Grand Chanter of <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> who has clearly proved his Sentiments, in his <HI>Little Tract of the Episcopal Schools.</HI> But if it be doubtful, whether it were founded by that Great Emperor; it is however most certain, that it began to appear in a very little time after his Reign, which was in <HI>France</HI> a Glorious one, for Learning and Learn∣ed Men, to whom this great Prince shewed all the Favour that could be. And in Gratitude, they have rendered him famous to Posterity, not only as the most knowing Emperor of that Age; but al∣so the Bravest and most Glorious. In the mean time, the University have taken him for their Pa∣tron, and on the Day of his Feast, the Exercises cease in all Colledges. We shall say nothing of its antient Splendor, nor of the Credit and Au∣thority, which it formerly enjoyed. It is well known, that most of the great Affairs, have been transacted by the advice of this University, and that Kings have not disdain'd to Consult it, in their most pressing Occasions. Popes themselves have in a manner appeal'd hither, and have of∣ten sued for the Suffrages of this University, to authorise their Elections, and support them against Competitors.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Duboulay</HI> in the History which he
<PB N="3" REF="90"/>
hath made of this University in three Volumes, in Folio, makes mention of many Illustrious Per∣sons, who have issued from hence. It hath been so numerous and so full of Scholars, that we ought not to omit observing here, one surpris∣ing thing, which happened under <HI>Charles</HI> VI. That Prince being fallen into a Distraction, pub∣lick Prayers and Processions were appointed to be made for his Recovery. All the Companies and Communalties went afoot, in Procession to St. <HI>Denis</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and the Parliament, as the prin∣cipal Body of the Kingdom, begun this Act of Piety. The University had also their appointed day to go thither, and <HI>Juvenal des Ʋrsins</HI> records. That all the Scholars were obliged to assist with their several Heads and Members, who belonged to them: He adds, That they all made so great a number of Men, that the beginning of the Pro∣cession, was entering into the Church of St <HI>Denis,</HI> when the Rector, who went last, was hardly gone out of the Church of the <HI>Mathu∣rins,</HI> where they first met together. The num∣ber of Scholars and Colledges is now very much diminished. Formerly one might have reckoned one Hundred, at present you can hardly find Thirty: Among which there are only nine that maintan Exercises <HI>(Des basses Classes)</HI> of the lower Classes, and they are</P>
<P>The Colledge <HI>du Plessis.</HI></P>
<P>The Colledge <HI>d'Harcourt.</HI></P>
<P>The Coll. <HI>de Navarre.</HI></P>
<P>The Coll. <HI>de Beauvais.</HI></P>
<P>The Coll. of the Cardinal <HI>le Moyne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Coll.</HI> de la Marche.</P>
<P>The Coll. <HI>de Lizieux.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="91"/>
The Coll. <HI>des Grassins.</HI></P>
<P>The Coll. of <HI>Clermont,</HI> wholy employed by the Jesuits, of which we shall speak by it self.</P>
<P>It is needless to insert the names of the o∣thers, where they do not teach; they are but little known, and serve only for the Lodgings of certain Scholars, called <HI>Boursiers,</HI> who live there upon the Pensions which the Colledge al∣lows them yearly. The University had also its own Jurisdiction apart, and if any of its Mem∣bers had committed any Crime, it was not per∣mitted for the Publick Judge to condemn them. Of this you may read an Example in an Epitaph, in the <HI>Mathurins</HI> Cloister. Two Scholars having done certain Crimes worthy of Death, were Executed by Sentence of the Provost of <HI>Paris:</HI> The University conceiving themselves wounded in this Sentence, suspended their Exer∣cises, and by this means obliged the Provost of <HI>Paris,</HI> to bring back the Bodies of these two Scholars to the <HI>Mathurins,</HI> after he had himself taken them down from the Gallows at <HI>Montfau∣con,</HI> where they there hung; and after he had kist their Cheeks, tho they had been Executed above four Months. There are many Examples of this sort. But since that time things are very much changed; and though at present the Uni∣versity is full of Persons of great Learning, yet her Credit and Authority are mightily diminish∣ed; especially since about the middle of the last Age, she has suffered some Losses, which she will have much ado ever to repair.</P>
<P>In the mean time this hinders not, but that the Sciences flourish here, more than in any other part of <HI>Europe,</HI> and are here taught with much
<PB N="5" REF="91"/>
Success and Profit. The University is divided in∣to four Faculties, and over them all they have for their Head, a Rector, who is chosen every three Months. Formerly they chose him every six Weeks, but of late four times a Year hath been thought often enough. The four Faculties are</P>
<P>DIVINITY,</P>
<P>LAW,</P>
<P>PHYSICK,</P>
<P>The ARTS.</P>
<P>Divinity is profest only in the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> and in the Colledge of <HI>Navarre.</HI> For the Law, as it is divided into the Civil Law, and the Canon Law, so there are Professors for both in a Col∣ledge, which stands in the <HI>Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais.</HI> About two years since, the King hath founded a new Chair for the <HI>French</HI> Law, pos∣sest by Monsieur <HI>de Launay,</HI> who makes his Le∣ctures in the Colledge of <HI>Cambray</HI> near St. <HI>Ben∣net</HI>'s Fountain. There is but one Colledge for Physick, and that is in the <HI>Rue de la Bucherie;</HI> where there is an Amphitheater (as the Physick Bills call it) in which they often make Dissections of humane Bodies.</P>
<P>As for the Faculty of the Arts, which is the last, that is subdivided into four Nations: The Nation of <HI>France,</HI> the Nation of <HI>Picardy,</HI> the Nation of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and the Nation of <HI>Ger∣many;</HI> the last of these was put in the room of that of <HI>England,</HI> excluded by reason of those cru∣el Wars, which have been between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English.</HI> These four Nations are again sub∣divided into other Provinces, which would be too long to recite.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="92"/>
This is what may be said in general of the University, of which I shall say more in des∣cribing the remarkable Places therein.</P>
<P>I begin this Quarter at the Key called, <HI>Quay de la Tournelle,</HI> from whence you pass before a House built by the late Monsieur <HI>Martin.</HI> In which Madam <HI>de Miramion,</HI> so well known by all pious People, hath about eight years since settled a new Company of Nuns, who live under the Rule of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> of the Congregation of St. <HI>Geneviéve.</HI> Of this new Company she is the Foundress. The House is well built and deserves to be seen. Near this is</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de M. de Nemond,</HI> one of those Presidents, who are called <HI>Presidents a Mortier,</HI> in which House you will see very good Furni∣ture, but above all a Library well furnisht, which this Illustrious Magistrate often visits. From hence you pass into</P>
<P>The <HI>Rüe de Bernardins,</HI> which lies on the left hand, in which Street are several very pretty Houses; among others, one wherein lives Mon∣sieur <HI>du Vaurouy.</HI> Here are some Paintings of the last Age well esteemed. A little further you will enter into</P>
<P>The Colledge of the <HI>Bernardins,</HI> which serves for all those who are of the Order of <HI>Cister∣tians.</HI> It is an antient Foundation, but that which is most observable, is the great design of Pope <HI>Bennet</HI> XII. who was formerly a Religi∣ous Man of this Order, and who desired to ren∣der his name Illustrious, in building this Col∣ledge of a Surprising Magnificence. The Walls that enclose the Ground, are of a wonderful thickness and solidity; and one would think, that the Holy Father would rather enclose a Citta∣del,
<PB N="7" REF="92"/>
than a Colledge of Religious Men; the Chapter-House is perfectly well Vaulted over∣head, and at present serves for their School. But that which is more Beautiful is the Structure of their Church, which ought to be considered as one of the fairest <HI>Gothick</HI> Buildings in all <HI>France;</HI> its Roof is of an extraordinary heighth, with Chappels on each side. True it is, that but part of this great Work is finisht, by rea∣son of the Holy Father's Death, which hap∣pened too soon; however by his Last Will be appointed, That what he had begun should be compleated, and to that end he left a Summ of Money; but that falling into the Hands of Rob∣bers on the way, as they conveyed it into <HI>France,</HI> during those Troubles, which happen∣ed in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. the Work re∣mained imperfect as it now is. One the side next the Sacristy, you ought to ask to see a little turning Stair-Case, very curiously contrived, in which two People may at the same time ascend and descend, without being seen to each other. This is by two winding Ascents, like a Snails Shell, managed one upon the other in the same round Space or Room. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s piece is admired by such Curious Persons who have seen it, in regard there are but very few Parallels. When the General of the <HI>Cistertians</HI> comes to <HI>Paris,</HI> he usually makes his abode in this House.</P>
<P>We ought to observe, that several Religious Orders have a right to have Colledges in this University, whose Members may take Degrees, and pass Doctors; but some others have neg∣lected this advantage, or the University hath not granted it to them for special Reasons.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="93"/>
As you go out of the <HI>Bernardins,</HI> on the left Hand, you find the Church of St. <HI>Nicolas du Chardonnet,</HI> newly Rebuilt of a very handsom De∣sign. This Church is so called, in regard it stands on a piece of Ground, formerly over-run with Thistles (in <HI>French</HI> called <HI>Chardons.)</HI> Which Ground the Monks of <HI>Victor</HI> gave for the build∣ing of a Parish Church, much wanting in this Quarter. The Church is not yet quite finisht. All that is Curious here, is a Chappel where <HI>Monsieur le Brun</HI> hath begun to Work. You may here see the Tomb of his Mother, designed by himself, and wrought in Marble by the Sieur <HI>Baptiste,</HI> on which there are very delicate Figures.</P>
<P>All this Quarter hath nothing very remark∣able. From hence you go to the <HI>Carmes,</HI> at the Entry of St. <HI>Geneviéve's</HI> Hill, near the <HI>Place-Maubert,</HI> which is one of the greatest Markets of all <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Carmes of the <HI>Place-Maubert.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Have already said, when I treated of the <HI>Celestins,</HI> that the <HI>Carmes</HI> (or <HI>Carmelites)</HI> were Founded there by Saint <HI>Lewis,</HI> which Or∣der he brought with him out of <HI>Palestine.</HI> But in regard that place was so far distant from the Uni∣versity, and in respect of the overflowings of the <HI>Seine,</HI> they thought it convenient to come and Inhabit in this Place, in the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> the Long; whose Queen <HI>Jane</HI> did, by her Testament in the Year 1349, leave them great Riches; a∣mong
<PB N="9" REF="93"/>
other things, she gave them her Crown of Gold, set about with divers Precious Stones of considerable Value; also the Flower-de-Lys of Gold, which she received at her Coronation, her Girdle set with Pearis, and all her Silver Vessels; together with the Summ of Fifteen Hundred Flo∣rins of Gold, which in those days amounted very high. They made use of all this to build their Church, and their Covent, which have nothing ve∣ry handsom. There is in this Church a great Devo∣tion to our Lady of <HI>Mount-Carmel,</HI> to which resort a very great number of People, who are devo∣ted to the Holy Virgin, in order to gain certain Indulgences, and this is every second Sunday of the Month. Not long ago they Rebuilt their Great Altar, after a design very singular; it is supported with Pillars of Free-stone, Painted like Marble, which make a very handsom shew.</P>
<P>On St. <HI>Geneviéve</HI>'s Hill, as you go to the Ab∣by of that name you pass before</P>
<P>The Colledge of <HI>Navarre,</HI> the Fairest and most Spacious of all <HI>Paris;</HI> it was Founded by Queen <HI>Jane</HI> of <HI>Navarre,</HI> Wife of <HI>Philip the Fair,</HI> as ap∣pears by the Inscriptions under the Statue of that King and Queen, on the side of the great Gate, which are as follows:</P>
<Q LANG="lat">PHILIPPUS PULCHER CHRISTIANISSIMUS Hujus DOMUS FUNDATOR.</Q>
<Q><HI>PHILIP</HI> the Fair, the most Christian King, Founder of this House.</Q>
<P><PB N="10" REF="94"/>
Under the Queen's Statue,</P>
<Q LANG="lat">JOANNA FRANCIAE ET NAVARRAE REGINA <LB/> 
CAMPANIAE BRIAEQUE COMES PALATINA HAS AEDES FUNDAVIT 1304.</Q>
<Q><HI>Jane</HI> Queen of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navarre,</HI> Countess Pala∣tine of <HI>Champaign</HI> and <HI>la Brie,</HI> Founded this House, <HI>1304.</HI></Q>
<P>In the middle are these two Verses,</P>
<Q LANG="lat"><L>Dextra potens, lex aequa, fides, tria lilia Regum</L>
<L>Francorum, Christo Principe, ad astra forunt.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Valour, just Laws, Religion, Flowers of <HI>France;</HI></L>
<L>Christ being the guide, to Heaven's top advance.</L></Q>
<P>This Colledge was formerly the most renown'd of all the University. The Sons of the greatest Lords of the Kingdom, were here put to Pen∣sion, and that their Commerce with other Schol∣lars, might not waste their Allowance; they then received none but Pensioners: But this Me∣thod is changed at present, and now they admit to their Exercises, all sorts of Scholars indiffe∣rently. Divinity is taught here, as hath been already said, and four Professors have Salleries to read their Lectures; two in the Morning, and two in the Afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="94"/>
Monsieur the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Auch</HI> is Provisor of this Colledge. They have here a Library, given by Queen <HI>Jane</HI> of <HI>Navarre,</HI> which was formerly of great Reputation, before the use of Printing. It contains several very curious Ma∣nuscripts. This Colledge has produced more Fa∣mous Men of Learning than any other. The Chief of whom is <HI>Pierre d'Ailly,</HI> Cardinal by the Title of <HI>Saint Crisogon,</HI> and Arch Bishop of <HI>Cam∣bray,</HI> who was a great Benefactor here, as is to be seen by an Inscription in the Chapel. He is interred at <HI>Cambray</HI> In the middle of the same Chapel, is the Tomb of the illustrious <HI>Thomas de Clemengis,</HI> a Famous Doctor in Divinity, and on it is this Inscription;</P>
<Q LANG="lat">Qui Lampas fuit Ecclesiae, sub Lampade jacet.</Q>
<Q>A Light o'th' Church under this Lamp doth lye.</Q>
<P><HI>John Textor</HI> is also here interr'd. The other Famous Men are <HI>Gerson, Joannes Major, Almai∣nus de Castro Forri, Papillon, Gelin, de Villers,</HI> and <HI>Pelletier:</HI> The last of which was the great Master of this Colledge, and was present at the Council of <HI>Trent.</HI> Of late they have had Monsi∣eur <HI>de Launcy,</HI> a Famous Critick, who hath Com∣posed several Volumes of the Ecclesiastic History, and who, perhaps, hath best understood, of all of this Age, the Annals of the Church, as appears by his Works, so much sought after by the Learn∣ed. He hath also writ the History of this Col∣ledge.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="95"/>
Note that this Hill was formerly called <HI>Mons Locutitius,</HI> but for what reason is not known. Higher on the Hill, where this Colledge stands, is the Abby of St. <HI>Geneviéve,</HI> and next to it</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Estienne du Mont,</HI> a Parish Church. This Church is of so old a Foundation, that it is not certainly known in what time it was first Built. That Building which we see at present, was undertaken in the Reign of <HI>Francis</HI> the First, and after it had remain'd a long time imperfect, it was not finished till under <HI>Henry</HI> IV. Queen <HI>Margaret</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> his first Wife, gave a Summ of Money for making the Portal, herself laying the first Stone, on the Twelfth of <HI>August,</HI> 1610. This Portal is curiously wrought, and they have bestowed there a profuse number of Sculptures, which had made a much better show, if they had been manag'd and disposed with more care. The inside of this Church is very neat, and lightsome; the Roof is very high and well extended. There are between Pillar and Pillar, certain Arches that support Galleries of Communication, and turn about each Pillar with much Art. The Tribune over the entrance into the Quire is very hardy, as are also the little Stairs that go up thither, which wind about the thick Pillars of the <HI>Croisée.</HI> The Chapel of the Holy Virgin, behind the great Altar, is also well Built. But that which the Curious ought to observe more carefully than all, is the Pulpit, which is of excellent Workmanship, adorn'd with Sculptures and Bas-reliefs, of a wonderful Design and Performance. The Statue of <HI>Samp∣son</HI> supports the whole Body of the Work, about whom are placed several little Figures of Chri∣stian Virtues: Upon the Canopy over-head, is
<PB N="13" REF="95"/>
a great Angel, holding Two Trumpets. All these things are perfectly well design'd; and this Pulpit, is, without contradiction, the most Beautiful of all <HI>Paris.</HI> It ought to be known, that Monsieur <HI>Pascal,</HI> one of the greatest Wits that <HI>France</HI> ever had, Author of that Incompa∣rable Book, called <HI>Penseés sur la Religion,</HI> (Thoughts upon Religion) and of several others of the same Beauty and Learning, is Buryed in this Church. <HI>La Sueur</HI> a famous Painter, of whom I have already often made mention, is also here interr'd.</P>
<P>From hence you may pass into the Church of St. <HI>Genevi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve,</HI> through a Door of Communica∣tion, behind the Pulpit, but this is not the ordi∣nary way. The usual Entrance is by the great Gate, which is in the open place before the Church.</P>

<HEAD><HI>St.</HI> Geneviéve du Mont.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore we write of the Curiosities in this House, something ought to be said of its Foundation. <HI>Clovis,</HI> as some believe, was the first Founder, and Dedicated it to St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> whose names it bore a long time. He placed here Secular Canons, who inhabited this House till the Reign of <HI>Lewis the Young,</HI> in the Eleventh Age, at which time the King constrain∣ed them to take the Rule of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> and to live in Community, they having till then led very irregular Lives. To establish this new Reform, some Persons were brought over from
<PB N="14" REF="96"/>
St. <HI>Victors,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>de Mezeray</HI> acquaints us with the Reasons, which occasioned that King to do this. He says, That of old time be∣yond Memory, there were certain Secular Canons in this House, who had been by the Solicitation of King <HI>Robert the Religious,</HI> freed from the Visitation of the Bishop, and placed immediately under that of the Holy See: But it happenning that Pope <HI>Engenius</HI> the Fourth, flying for refuge into <HI>France,</HI> and Lodging in this House, there happened a Dispute between the Canons and the Holy Father's Officers, on occasion, that the Canons would have taken to themselves an Imbroidered Carpet, which the King presented to his Holiness, to hang before his <HI>Prie Dieu</HI> (or Seat in the Church) they pre∣tending that it ought to belong to, and remain in their Church. The Controversie was so hot, that they fell from Words to Blows, and the Canons being the stronger Party, assaulted the Pope's Officers so home, that they were some of them Kill'd. The King himself coming thither to appease the Tumult, thought he should have been Wounded in the disorder: To punish the Canons for this their insolence, the King agreed with the Holy Father to Expel them from this House, and to give the care of the Re∣form to <HI>Suger,</HI> Abbot of St. <HI>Denis;</HI> who thereupon drew off 12. Canons Regular from St. <HI>Victors,</HI> and placed them here in the room of the others. Af∣ter this manner, the Chapter was changed into an Abby, whose first Abbot was called <HI>Odo.</HI> Since that time the Rule of St. <HI>Austin</HI> hath always been observed here with much Purity, and this House is become the Chief of all the Congregation in <HI>France:</HI> The Abbot of which, with his four As∣sistants,
<PB N="15" REF="96"/>
is the Head of the Order. This Abby had formerly a peculiar Jurisdiction, like that of St. <HI>Germain des Prez;</HI> but in regard this was found to be the cause of much Disorder and Con∣fusion, they were all united to the Body of the <HI>Châtelet.</HI> Many Kings have been Benefactors to this House, but the greatest was King <HI>Robert,</HI> who built the old Cloister, which was taken down under <HI>Francis</HI> the First, who inclosed for them 17 Arpens (or Acres) of Land. The House hath been often ruined by the <HI>Normans</HI> and the <HI>Danes,</HI> while it was out of the Town; but the Devotion which the <HI>Parisians</HI> had for St. <HI>Gene∣viéve,</HI> their Patroness, was the occasion that the Ruines made by those Barbarous People, were repaired again in a very little time after. The Body of St. <HI>Geneviéve</HI> is in the Shrine behind the great Altar, supported by 4 Ionick Pillars, of an extraordinary sort of Marble. The Chest is of Silver-gilt, enricht with Precious Stones of very great value. Father <HI>du Breüil,</HI> who hath Composed a Volume <HI>Of the Antiquities of</HI> Paris, tells us, That this Shrine was made by the Libe∣ralities of several pious Persons, and that the Goldsmiths Work came to, One hundred four∣score and thirteen Marks of Silver, and Eight Marks and an half of Gold to gild it. The Queen Mother, deceased, whose Piety will be a long time remember'd, in divers Parts of <HI>Paris,</HI> enricht this shrine with Nosegays composed of Pre∣cious Stones, of a very considerable price. There hang round about several Lamps of Silver, and divers Figures of the same Mettal, which are all so many Vows made by sundry People to this Saint.</P>
<P>All that is of more than ordinary Curiosity in
<PB N="16" REF="97"/>
this Church, is the Tomb of <HI>Clovis</HI> the first Christian King; it stands in the middle of the Quire; his Figure which lies along upon the Tomb, is the same which was made for him after his Death. Some years since they have raised it two Foot and a half, to make room for this Inscription.</P>

The Altar is <HI>Isolé,</HI> that is, so contrived, that one may go round it. The little Taberna∣cle is a very Beautiful thing. It is of White Marble, in form of a Dome of Eight Angles, with four Porticos, supported with small <HI>Corin∣thian</HI> Pillars of <HI>Sicilian</HI> Marble, whose Capitals are of Brass gilt, very well carved, and Figures of Angels on the Pedestals, with other Orna∣ments, of the same. The Body of this Taberna∣cle is inlay'd with divers rich Stones, as <HI>Lapis Lazuli, Agate,</HI> and such like. All the Work stands upon a Foot <HI>(en cul de Lampe)</HI> like the bottom of a Lamp, of a blew Marble extream rare. On each side are two Statues, of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> St. <HI>Denis</HI> and St. <HI>Austin;</HI> these are of a kind of material Resembling Marble for its whiteness, but much lighter.</P>
<P>In the Nave of the Church are several Chap∣pels, very well adorned with Marble Pillars. The Door that leads into the Quire, over which is the <HI>Jubé,</HI> is of Marble also, with Bas-reliefs upon the Attick. The Organs are extream handsom, and the Wainscot exactly well wrought. The most considerable Tombs next to that of <HI>Clovis,</HI> already mentioned, are the following, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Clotilda</HI> his Wife, reputed a Saint, in regard she was the principal cause of her Hus∣band's Conversion, as <HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Tours</HI> relates.

<P>In the Vault under this Church, you may still see the Tomb of St. <HI>Geneviéve,</HI> tho there remains therein nothing of her Body, which is all entire in the Shrine, with the very Boards of her Cof∣fin. This Tomb is of Marble without any Or∣nament. At one end, upon an Altar which stands between two Pillars, is a Cross adorn'd with certain Agates, with an <HI>Ecce Homo</HI> at the Foot of it, of one intire piece of Coral, very well wrought. These things come from the Ca∣binet of the Rev̇erend Father <HI>du Molinet,</HI> whose
<PB N="21" REF="99"/>
Present it was. There are two other Tombs very antient, of two Bishops of <HI>Paris,</HI> who dyed with the reputation of Sanctity, and who are invo∣ked on the account of some particular Distempers.</P>
<P>From hence you ought to go and see the <HI>Sacri∣sty,</HI> which you will find very well furnisht with Ornaments of divers Colours very rich, and with a great quantity of Plate. There is no place in this Kingdom, and perhaps in all <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> where the divine Offices are Celebrated with more Devotion and Majesty, than in this Church: All the Religious are extreamly regu∣lar, and one is much Edified to see them in the Ceremonies of the Church.</P>
<P>In the inward parts of the House there are ma∣ny curious things, particularly as to the Archi∣tecture; about ten years since they have made considerable Reparations. The great Gate was very inconvenient; and they have built another in the place, after the manner of a double Portico, supported by Pillars of the Dorick Order, very re∣gularly proportioned, with two Square Pavilions at the Extremities. Over against this Gate is a Fountain at the Feet of a Figure of St. <HI>Geneviéve,</HI> in a kind of Niche or Arch, set off with two Io∣nick Pillars. After this we enter into the Cloi∣ster, or rather under a kind of Portico, suppor∣ted on both sides with Dorick Pillars, like those at the Entrance, but of a handsomer Orderance. At the further end of this Portico, about thirty Paces long, stands the great Stair-case, which leads to the <HI>Dortoirs,</HI> at the further end of which is a Figure of the Holy Virgin, holding the In∣fant <HI>JESUS</HI> in her Armes; it is of Excellent Workmanship, as one may easily perceive. The Dortoirs have nothing of Magnificent. Their
<PB N="22" REF="100"/>
only care is, that all things throughout the place should appear neat, as well as in the Low∣er Rooms, in which you may see several Pictures of the antient Abbots of this House. The Gar∣den is very pleasant, it is the greatest of all those that were within the antient Walls of <HI>Paris.</HI> On that side next the Portico, of which we have been speaking, you may go into a Chappel dedicated to the Holy Virgin, round which are hung seve∣ral Pictures of Devotion well Painted. In the middle of this Chappel is a Tomb about a Foot high, on which is the Figure in Brass of an anti∣ent Bishop, in his Pontificial Habits. After you have seen these things, you ought to visit tho Apothecary-Room, which is extraordinary neat, and where there are several Curiosities, for those who are knowing in these matters.</P>
<P>From hence you ought to go up to the Library, which at present is esteemed one of the fairest and best furnisht of <HI>Paris.</HI> It takes up the upper Room of one of those four great Wings, which compose this building. It is, in truth, a little too high scituated, but in recompense of that it is so much the lighter. You have there a very great num∣ber of Books, placed in Presses of very handsom Wainscot, with the busts of all the great Men of Antiquity, Coppied from those at <HI>Versailles.</HI> The Reverend Father <HI>du Molinet,</HI> one of the most Learned and able Men of this Age, in the knowledge of Books, and in the curious search of Antiquity, hath the over-sight and care in these matters. They preserve here a great quantity of Prints, part of which came from one called Monsieur <HI>Hacart,</HI> who was a very curious Person, and dying left all that he had Collected to St. <HI>Victors,</HI> St. <HI>Germains des Prez,</HI> and S. <HI>Ge∣neviéve</HI>'s,
<PB N="23" REF="100"/>
but they have here a great many o∣thers more rare and better kept.</P>
<P>At the end of the Library you enter into the Cabinet of the foresaid Father, which is extra∣ordinarily well furnished with Curiosities; you may there find all sorts, but chiefly Meddals of Gold, Silver and of Brass bigger and lesser, ve∣ry well chosen, and some of them extream rare. We ought to consider this sett of Meddals, which this Father himself hath Collected, as the fullest and most Compleat, in all <HI>France,</HI> next to that in the King's Cabinet.</P>
<P>Among other Extraordinary things, in a little Press you may see certain consecrated Knives, with which the Antients used to cut the Throats of their Victims; a great Platter in which they mixt Wheat, Flower, Oyl and Wine, with which they used to rub the Beasts they Sacrificed; certain Sphinxes or Idols, found among the Mo∣mies; Antique Keys; Stiles, or steel Pens, which the <HI>Romans</HI> used to write with; a Copper Ta∣ble, to which are fastened several little Balls of the same Mettal, which may be placed as a Man pleased, these the Antients used to cast account with; several sorts of Lacrimatories, or Glass-Viols, in which they used to preserve the Tears of those, who they hired on purpose to Weep at Funerals, with several little Copper Spoons that they made use of to gather the Tears up with, from Leather Aprons, which they wore before them at that time, on purpose for the Tears to fall in. In another little Press on the Right Hand, are all sorts of Measures for Liquids, and Weights to weigh things sold, according to the usage of the Antients. In another, he keeps all the Graving Tools of <HI>Parmezan,</HI> with which that
<PB N="24" REF="101"/>
Famous Graver used to Counterfeit the old Me∣dals of the Antients so exactly, that the most skil∣ful in this Art have been deceived, and have taken the Counterfeit Medals, made by that able Work∣man, for true ones, and stampt in the times of those Men which they represent. This was per∣haps one of the Curiousest Actions that could be done,. and those who are skilful in these mat∣ters esteem them much. Together with these things, you may see here several Peices of Op∣ticks, invented by Father <HI>Niseron,</HI> a Minim, of whom we have formerly made mention; the Poot of a small Mummy, very well preserved; cer∣tain extraordinary Fishes; and another Rarity, which in the Ages past, was esteemed an entire Treasure of it self, and that is a great Unicorn's Horn, white as Ivory, five or six Poot in heighth, and of a considerable thickness, it is no less Beau∣tiful than that in the Treasury at St. <HI>Denis;</HI> for which, as it is said, the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> did once offer, One hundred thousand Crowns, to have Presented it to a King of <HI>Persia.</HI> In another small Cabinet, there are all sorts of Rich Stones, Shells and Minerals exceeding rare, and such like things. Over against the Door, where you en∣ter, are divers kinds of Habits, made of the Feathers of Paroquets, and other Birds, wrought together with great Art, and brought from <HI>Ame∣rica;</HI> a Cuirass and a Corselet of <HI>Japan,</HI> made of Vernish, and of an unusual shape; a Sheild made of Silk, probably coming from the same Country; and that which can hardly be seen elsewhere, a great number of Shoes belonging to almost all Nations in the Levant, extreamly different in Shape, from what we wear. There is also a Chain made of Wood, very light and very long,
<PB N="25" REF="101"/>
all made out of one piece; several petrified things very curious; and among the rest one Stone com∣posed of divers Pieces, in such manner, that we cannot discern, whether it be the production of Art or Nature. There are many other Rari∣ties to observe, as the Jaw of a Fish, of extraor∣dinary greatness, having in it several Rows of sharp Teeth; several good Pictures, with divers other rare and well Collected things. This Re∣verend Father is not only knowing in these mat∣ters, but he hath Written several Learned Pieces, as, <HI>A Defence of</HI> Thomas a Kempis; <HI>A Dis∣course upon the Brass-Head, which was found at Monsieur</HI> Berrier<HI>'s; The History of the Popes by their Medals; The Works of</HI> Stephen de Tourney, augmented very considerably with divers Pieces, never. yet Printed; and a learned Commentary, which clears many obscure places, which would have scarcely been understood without his Assi∣stance; and in fine, <HI>The History of the Roman Learn∣ing estab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished, and justified by many Excellent Antiqui∣ties,</HI> which last he has publisht this present Year, 1684. There have been many able Men of this Abby, among others Father <HI>Lalleman,</HI> who lived not long ago, and gain'd to himself great Repu∣tation by his Books of Devotion, namely, <HI>The Death of the Righteous, and the Saints desire of Death,</HI> the Reading of which is extream mo∣ving. The Reverend Father <HI>de Creil,</HI> now Living, passes for one of the best Architects that are, and the Designs which he has invented, have been followed with good success; among others, those in the New-buildings of this House. In all the rest of this Quarter there is nothing Curious, be∣ing all fill'd with Colledges, and those are but old Houses ill built.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="102"/>
The <HI>Colledge of Montaigu,</HI> or of <HI>the Capets,</HI> is very near. Of which Colledge the Chapter of <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> and the <HI>Carthusian</HI> Fathers are Ad∣ministrators. Formerly they entertain'd here poor Scholars, who were obliged to live under a very severe Discipline; but at present that Custom is alter'd. It ought to be observ'd, that the famous <HI>Erasmus</HI> of <HI>Roterdam,</HI> did for some time dwell in this Colledge.</P>
<P>Next to this Quarter, we ought to go into the <HI>Rüe Saint Jacques,</HI> which Street begins at the Little <HI>Châtelet,</HI> at the end of the <HI>Petit Pont.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Little CHATELET.</HEAD>
<P>THis is a kind of antient Fortress, composed of a great mass of Buildings, open in the middle, and served formerly as one of the Town-Gates, as did also the great <HI>Châtelet;</HI> this was when <HI>Paris</HI> had no greater Extent than the Isle of the <HI>Palais.</HI> This Building was repair'd by King <HI>Robert,</HI> under whom <HI>France</HI> enjoy'd a Peace of two and forty years; during which that good Prince had convenient time to amass a very great Treasure, which he deposited in this For∣tress, notwithstanding the great Bounties, which he bestowed upon Churches, and his great Charities, with which he relieved the Poor. Some Antiquaries will not allow this place to be so Antient, but say that it was Built by <HI>Aubriot,</HI> Provost of <HI>Paris,</HI> the same person who Built the <HI>Bastille;</HI> and that he did it to restrain the Insolences of the Scholars of the

<HEAD>THE RUE SAINT JACQUES.</HEAD>
<P>THis Street is almost all inhabited by Booksellers, by reason of the Neigh∣bouring University. The first thing of Note that you observe here, is</P>
<P><HI>The Church of Saint Severin,</HI> which is very Antient, and one may think so, in regard the Patron himself was the Founder: Who lived in the Reign of <HI>Clovis,</HI> and was by him invited out of <HI>Savoy,</HI> where he was at that time a Hermite, to come into <HI>France,</HI> and cure him of a grievous Fever, with which that King was afflicted; and was at last cured through the Prayers of this Holy Man. During his abode at <HI>Paris,</HI> he dwelt in this place, at that time very solitary; where there had been already built a small Chappel in a Wood, Dedicated to St. <HI>Clement:</HI> Having re∣main'd here some time, he resolved to return to his former dwelling; but as he past by <HI>Château-Landon,</HI> a small Village in <HI>Gatinois,</HI> he met with two Priests, who dwelt there in the reputation of Sanctity; he stopt his Journey, and after two years abode with them, he dyed there. <HI>Childe∣bert</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="103"/>
caused a Church to be built in the same place, which is at present an Abby of St. <HI>Augu∣stine</HI>'s Order, of the Congregation of St. <HI>Gene∣viéve.</HI> It is not well known when this Parish-Church was built, but according to Appearance it is not above 200. years old. There is nothing to be seen in it of Curiosity, it being but an old Go∣thick Building, not very regular, and very dark in some places. The great Altar was finisht but a while ago; it is composed of eight small Marble Pillars, disposed in form of a Semi-Circle, which support a Dome cut in half, as it were, with some Ornaments of Brass gilt, which shew very handsomly; it is the Workmanship of Monsieur <HI>le Brun.</HI> In the Church-Yard, the side next the Church, is raised a Tomb, upon which in a demicumbent Posture, is the Figure of a Young Lord of <HI>East-Friseland,</HI> who dyed here, being a Scholar of this University. His Name was <HI>d'Embda.</HI> The Tomb was built by his Mo∣ther's Order; a Lady extraordinarily afflicted at his Death, he being her only Son, and the Pre∣sumptive Heir of <HI>Friseland.</HI> The two Epitaphs on his Monument are as follow:</P>

<P>On the other side of the <HI>Rüe Saint Jacques,</HI> as you enter into the <HI>Rüe Galande,</HI> which Street butts upon the former, there stands a very anti∣ent Church named</P>
<P><HI>Saint Julien le Pauvre,</HI> which, doubtless, was formerly an Hospital. <HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Tours,</HI> in the ninth Book and the ninth Chapter of his Works mentions it; and tells us, That coming to <HI>Paris</HI> on certain private affairs, he Lodged in this place, at such time as they had taken a Notorious Cheat, who pretended he had brought from <HI>Spain</HI> certain precious Reliques, among others some of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> and St. <HI>Felix,</HI> with which, no doubt, he would have abused the Credulity of the <HI>Parisians.</HI> But when his pretended Reliques came to be examined, they found in his Bag no∣thing but the Roots of divers Plants, the Teeth of Moles, the Bones of Mice, with the Fat and Claws of Bears. Which things being appre∣hended to serve only for some Magical use or other, they were all thrown into the River. The Cheat himself was committed close Prisoner, and put in Chains, according to the Custom of those times. This happen'd in the Reign of <HI>Chilperic,</HI> who was unhappily slain just enter∣ing into his Palace at <HI>Chelles,</HI> as he return'd from Hunting, about the Year Five hundred Eighty four.</P>
<P>A little further on in the <HI>Rüe Saint Jacques,</HI> is</P>

<P>THE Convent of these Fathers stands a lit∣tle higher in the other side of the Street. St. <HI>Lewis</HI> was their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounder, and they are of the Holy Trinity of the Redemption of Captives. Their principal Institution is to go into <HI>Barbary,</HI> and there ransom. Christian Slaves out of the Hands of the Infidels, and procure their Liber∣ty.

Lastly, here is the Tomb of the two Scholars, named <HI>Leger Moussel,</HI> and <HI>Oliver Bourgeois,</HI> who were hang'd at <HI>Montfaulcon</HI> in the Year 1408, on the 17th. of <HI>May,</HI> by Sentence of the Provost of <HI>Paris,</HI> without regard to the Priviledges of the University; who afterwards demanded that famous Satisfaction, which we have already spoken off in the 4th. Folio of this Second Part. Of late they have made many Considerable De∣corations in this Church. The great Altar is a∣dorn'd with Pillars of a kind of reddish Marble, very rare. The little Tabernacle upon that Altar is also very Beautiful: So are the two lesser Al∣tars on each side of the great one, adorn'd with Pillars very well wrought. The Quire of this Church is separated from the Nave by a kind of Balustrade, or rather by six Ionick Pillars of Marble, supporting a Cornish, on which there are several little Figures of Angels, very well design∣ed. The rest of the Church is Wainscoted with Joyners Work, full of Sculpture, with a great number of Grenades, which are the Arms of the present General of the Order, who hath been at the Expence of all these new Reparations. The University assemble in the Chapter-House of this Convent, when they make their Processions; which usually happens every three Months, at which the Rector is constantly present. He is also obliged to give a Summ of Money to all those that assist at the Ceremony. These Processions ought to be seen and observed by Strangers, and are well worth their Curiosity; the Show being very numerous, and disposed in excellent Order. The four Faculties are obliged to appear there, in the proper and peculiar Habits belonging to them. The Money which the Rector disburses
<PB N="35" REF="106"/>
on this occasion, arises out of the Revenues of the University, which amount to the Summ of Fifty thousand Franks, arising out of the Messageries (or Carriage of Goods) between certain Towns of this Kingdom, and also from several Houses Situated in divers places of <HI>Paris.</HI> Formerly they possest much greater Revenues, but they have been lost by the negligence of those, who of late Years have had the Administration of their affairs. From hence you pass before</P>
<P><HI>The Church of Saint Benoit,</HI> supposed to be Founded by St. <HI>Denis,</HI> who Dedicated it to the Holy Trinity; if so, none can doubt it to be of very great Antiquity. It is possest by Canons Secular, who are obliged on the great Feasts to accompany the Canons of <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> when they make their grand Processions. The Build∣ing or Structure of this Church is nothing Beau∣tiful, as being carried up at several times and by pieces. The Nave was built in the Reign of <HI>Fran∣cis</HI> the First, and four years since the Quire was Rebuilt anew very handsomly. The inside is embellisht with Corinthian Pilasters, which sup∣port a Cornish of a very good Gust. This Church is very lightsome, and has not now the defect which it sometimes had; which was, that the great Altar was contrived on the West side; since, when it was new built in the last Age, they quite changed that Disposition; which occasion'd that it has been call'd, <HI>St. Benoist le bien tourné,</HI> or <HI>St. Bennet's the well contrived.</HI> For in those days they were very exact, in contriving the Churches East and West, even to a kind of Scruple.</P>
<P>On the other side of the Street St. <HI>Jacques,</HI> o∣ver against the hinder part of the Quire of this
<PB N="36" REF="107"/>
Church is a small open-place, or Court, at the Entrance into which stands a Fountain which bears its name. The place is called <HI>La Terre de Cambray,</HI> from the Colledge of that Name there Situated. You have there also</P>
<P>The <HI>Colledge Royal,</HI> whose original Founder was <HI>Francis</HI> the First, the Father and Restorer of Learning in <HI>France.</HI> 'Twas he that instituted most of the Lectures in Law and Physick in this University, and invited hither the ablest Men he could find, to teach here the Mathematicks, Philosophy, and the Greek, Latin, Syriack, and Hebrew Tongues. He intended to have raised here a great Building, but his design being never executed, because of his great Expences in the Wars, which he had on all the Frontiers of his Kingdom, especially in <HI>Italy;</HI> he left the Work to be done by his Son <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, who neglected, or at least had not a Conveniency of doing it. The Professors all the while read their Lectures in the Colledge of <HI>Cambray,</HI> and remain'd in this Condition till under the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great, who in the Year 1609. on the 23. of <HI>November,</HI> sent the Cardinal <HI>du Perron,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Suilly,</HI> first Minister, the President <HI>de Thou,</HI> and a Counsellor of Parliament named Monsi∣eur <HI>Gillot,</HI> to view the Situation of the place, and if there was sufficient Room, to raise the Building projected. It should have been com∣posed of a main Front, and on each Hand two Wings, with a Court, in the midst of which should have been a Fountain. The lower Rooms were designed for Schools, and the first Story on one side, for the Royal Library, which was then at <HI>Fountainbleau,</HI> and is at present kept in the <HI>Rué Vivien.</HI> The Professors also should there
<PB N="37" REF="107"/>
have had their Lodgings, which would have been of great advantage; but these excellent Pro∣jects were never executed, by reason of the Tra∣gick Death of that great King, of whom <HI>France</HI> was rob'd in a time when she least expected it. Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medieis</HI> his Illustrious Wife, to second the Zeal of the King her Husband, re∣solved to finish what he had begun; and to that purpose she her self with her Son <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. at that time but nine Years old, went to the place. The Young King laid the first Stone, and the Work was carried on with fervency; but in the end it was once again broke off, and re∣mains as we see it, having never been thought of, to be continued, from that time to this. There is but one side finisht, and that stands in the same place, where formerly stood the Colledge called <HI>de Treguier.</HI> The Professors are paid by the King, and are a kind of Body distinct from the University, to which, however, they are sub∣ject. They enjoy the same Priviledges with the Officers of the King's Household; and the Re∣ctor of the University is not permitted to dispose their places, nor to prohibit their Exercises, which he may do to all other Professors. They have always been persons of singular Note, and extraordinary Merit.</P>
<P>The most Famous have been; in the Greek Tongue <HI>Adrian Turnebe,</HI> Native of <HI>Andeli</HI> in <HI>Nor∣mandy,</HI> who dyed in the Year 1565, being but Fif∣ty three Years of Age. <HI>Denis Lambin</HI> succeeded him, and hath left behind him many excellent Works.</P>
<P>In the Hebrew Tongue, <HI>Francis Vatable,</HI> ori∣ginally of <HI>Picardy;</HI> he hath writ several Com∣mentaries upon divers Authors, much esteem'd.
<PB N="38" REF="108"/>
<HI>Gilbert Genebrard,</HI> Doctor in Divinity, of the Or∣der of St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> and Prior of St. <HI>Denis de la Char∣tre,</HI> near the <HI>Pont Nostre-Dame.</HI> He was Elected Arch-Bishop of <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> and dyed in <HI>March</HI> 1597. There are extant several Works of his, the Catalogue of which are at the end of the Book Entituled <HI>La Liturgie Sainte.</HI> The formerly men∣tioned <HI>Calignon</HI> was another Professor here for this Tongue; he hath composed a Grammar which is much esteemed. <HI>Ralph Baines</HI> an <HI>English</HI>-man, who writ three Books of Commentaries on <HI>So∣lomon,</HI> according to the Hebrew Phrase, which he Dedicated to <HI>Henry</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>In the Mathematicks there have been <HI>Oronce Finé,</HI> Native of the Town of <HI>Briançon</HI> in <HI>Dau∣phiné;</HI> and <HI>Paschal du Hamel,</HI> who succeeded him.</P>
<P>In the Latin Eloquence <HI>Barthelemy Latomus,</HI> and <HI>John Passerat.</HI></P>
<P>The two most famous among those who have taught Philosophy here, were <HI>Francis Vicomereat,</HI> originally of <HI>Verona,</HI> and <HI>Peter de la Ramée</HI> of <HI>Cuth</HI> in <HI>Vermandois,</HI> who lived about the Year 1568.</P>
<P>Finally, those who have most excelled in Phy∣sick are, <HI>Vidus Vidius, Jacques Silius</HI> of <HI>Amiens,</HI> and <HI>John Rioland.</HI> These are those whose Names are of greatest Note, on the account of the Learned Works which they have left behind them. One can hardly find out any one Colledge, that has produced more Learned Men than this, although it be of no great Antiquity.</P>
<P>Over against this last mentioned Colledge, is, The <HI>Commandery of St. John de Latran,</HI> which de∣pends on the Order of <HI>Malta.</HI> It is a great piece of Ground full of Houses ill built, in which lodge
<PB N="39" REF="108"/>
all sorts of Workmen, not Masters, who may here manage their several Trades, without being disturb'd by the Jurates of the City. That which is here worth seeing, is the Tomb of Monsieur <HI>de Souvré;</HI> this is he who dyed Grand Prior of <HI>France,</HI> and who built some years before his Death, that fine House at the Temple. While he was only Commander of <HI>St. John de Latran,</HI> he caused this Tomb to be raised in the Church. It is all of Marble, his Effigies lying upon a great Urne of the same, accompanied with two <HI>Terms</HI> rising out of their <HI>Guénes,</HI> which are Channell'd and very well wrought. All this Monument is exactly Beautiful, and of a very singular Design. It is the Work of Monsieur <HI>Anguerre,</HI> one of the ablest Sculptors that <HI>France</HI> ever produced. The Body of Monsieur <HI>de Souvré,</HI> is not interr'd in this place, but only his Heart. There is no∣thing else remarkable. The Church in which this Monument is Erected, is very antient and ill built.</P>
<P>As you leave this place and go on in the <HI>Ruë Saint Jacques,</HI> you come to</P>
<P>The Colledge <HI>du Plessis,</HI> which was former∣ly call'd, the Colledge of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> by rea∣son that its first Founder <HI>Geoffrey du Plessis,</HI> Secre∣tary to Pope <HI>John</HI> XXII. had a very great Devotion to that Saint But the Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> to Eternize the Founder's Memory, restored it to his Name; and after he had Re∣built it magnificently, he caused it to be called The Colledge <HI>du Plessis de Richelieu.</HI> This Colledge hath the best contrived and handsomest Lodgings of all the University, and is also the fullest of Pensioners and Scholars. The Doctors of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> have the Direction of this Colledge, and place the Principal and Regents. A little higher in the Street is</P>

<HEAD>The Colledge of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great.</HEAD>
<P>It was formerly called the Colledge of <HI>Clermont,</HI> being built for the Scholars of that Town, in imita∣tion of some other Colledges of the University. In the last Age, Messire <HI>Guillaume Duprat,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Clermont,</HI> being at the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> on be∣half of this Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> contracted there a particular Friendship with certain Fathers Je∣suits, whom he met with at that Assembly; he con∣ceived so high an esteem of their Learning, and Pi∣ety, that at his return he brought them with him into <HI>France,</HI> to instruct our Youth in humane Learning; but more especially in the Purity of the Romish Religion, which at that time was disturb'd with the Heresie of <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin.</HI> This Pre∣late brought in his Company to <HI>Paris,</HI> Father <HI>Pa∣quier Broüet,</HI> with several others of that Society, whom so long as he lived, he entertained in his own House; but at his Death left them by his Testament Three thousand Livres of Rent, and a very considerable Summ of Mo∣ney; with which they purchased a void piece of Ground, then called the Court <HI>de Langres</HI> in the <HI>Ruë St. Jacques,</HI> being the place where they now are. This they named the Colledge
<PB N="41" REF="109"/>
of <HI>Clermont</HI> their great Benefactor, having been Bishop of that City. <HI>Henry</HI> III. was pleas'd to lay the first Stone, on which this Inscription was then graved</P>

<Q><P>With a desire of enlarging Religion, <HI>Henry III</HI> the most Christian King of France and Poland, to the honour of the most Glorious JESƲS, as a Monu∣ment of his Piety, laid this first Stone in the Founda∣tion of his Temple.</P>
<P><DATE>In the Year̄ of our Lord <HI>1582.</HI> the <HI>20.</HI> Day of April</DATE></P></Q>
<P>There is nothing of singular Remark in the Building belonging to this Colledge; yet there are here many Observable things, which you can hardly meet with elsewhere. As first, the great quantity of Chambers and Lodgings, fill'd to the least Corner, contriv'd with very great In∣dustry.
<PB N="42" REF="110"/>
The great number of Pensionaries, most of which are of considerable Quality; besides the multitude of Scholars that come from abroad, which sometimes amount to Two or Three thou∣sand. These study together in the most regular Order and Discipline of the World. The Schools are Six in number, besides those set apart for the Study of Philosophy, Divinity and the Ma∣thematicks: Which last are not used, but only by Young Jesuits, who still pursue their Course of Studies, or at least by some Pensionaries, who de∣sign not to take any Degrees in the University; for those who propose to themselves to be Masters of Arts, or Doctors, are obliged to study Philo∣sophy in some of the Colledges of the University. One thing extream laudable among these Fathers is, that all their Scholars are obliged to go to Confession every Month; so that at the same time the Parents are freed from the Care, both of their Childrens Consciences, as well as Studies. The Chappel of this Colledge is small and ob∣scure: It stands on the Right Hand as you en∣ter: There is nothing to be seen there but upon Feast days, and at such time the Altar is one of the richest and best furnisht. They have there an Antipendium all of Silver, and another of a rich Embroidery of Gold, very high raised upon a Ground of Silver. The Apartments in the hinder part of the House, are more convenient than those in the fore part; the Armes of Monsieur <HI>Fouquet</HI> in their Front, speak him to be the Builder of that part; as also of the main Body of the Edifice, which is at the further part of the Garden, near the little Colledge <HI>de Marmoutier,</HI> which has been annext to this to augment it. In this apartment they have placed their Library, which, beyond
<PB N="43" REF="110"/>
all contradiction, is one of the fairest and most nu∣merous of all <HI>Paris,</HI> as well for the Quality, as Quantity of Books, there to be seen. There is also a good number of antient Manuscripts, and of Heretical Books, chiefly of the <HI>Socinians,</HI> which fill almost a little Room themselves. Besides this a very excellent Collection of the <HI>Spanish</HI> History, as well general as particular Histories of the several Provinces of that Kingdom, and of the Famous persons who have therein inhabit∣ed; these Authors are either in <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>Latin.</HI> There is also a great quantity of Mathematicians and Humanists, which take up a little Gallery, which they have contrived into several Presses: for altho this Library does consist of two long Wings of building; yet it is all too little, and they are forced to employ this Gallery, for the receit of the lesser Volumes. At one end of this Gallery hangs a piece of <HI>Bassan,</HI> representing the Combat of the <HI>Centaures</HI> and the <HI>Lapithites,</HI> this Monsieur <HI>Fouquet</HI> gave, having first built the Library where it hangs, and endowed it with a Thousand Livres of Rent, for its Maintenance and Augmentation. They preserve here an excel∣lent Sett of Antient Medals, but being not dispo∣sed into order, they seldom are willing to shew them. In this Colledge are many able Persons, among whom may be reckoned a considerable number of Authors; such as are now living, are Father <HI>Bouhours,</HI> Author of <HI>The Entretiens d Ariste &amp; d'Eugene,</HI> in which you find so much Sweet∣ness and such Purity of Language, that it seems a Man that would speak as an accomplisht Person, must be sure to imitate his stile; his other Works are <HI>The Doubts and Remarks on the French Tongue; The History of</HI> Peter d'Aubusson, <HI>Grand Master</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="111"/>
<HI>of Rhodes; The Life of Saint</HI> Ignatius, <HI>and the Life of St.</HI> Francis Xavier, <HI>Apostle of the</HI> In∣dies; and certain Books of Devotion. Fa∣ther <HI>Rapin,</HI> he hath writ <HI>The Spirit of Chri∣stianity▪ The Importance of Salvation; The Belief of the last Ages;</HI> and <HI>Curious Instructions relating to History;</HI> with some Latin Poems. Father <HI>de la R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> he hath Commented upon certain Antient Authors for the use of <HI>Monseigneur the Dauphin;</HI> and the Tragedies which use to be represented on the Theater at this Colledge, are very often Writ by him: one may say that he is alike able in many things, for the <HI>French</HI> Verses which have come from his Pen, have been much esteem'd. Father <HI>d'Aroüy,</HI> before he went into <HI>Britany,</HI> where he now is, was much admired for the Ma∣thematical Instruments which he invented; he invented one not long since, which shew'd us the Motions of the Stars in such a method, as is wor∣thy the Curiosity of the most Skilful in that Sci∣ence. They sometimes make Publick Actions in this Colledge, which draw a prodigious number of People. At the Carnaval they represent some little Latin Tragedy. After <HI>Easter</HI> they expose Enigmatical Questions to be explained, for which they have certain Prizes. They have also cer∣tain <HI>Theses</HI> to be maintained, to which Persons of Quality resort; but their greatest Bravery of all is, the Grand Tragedy which they represent yearly in the Month of <HI>August,</HI> on a Theater rais∣ed on purpose, which takes up all the bottom of the Court. The Actors are always Pensionaries, and Sons of Persons of Quality. The finest ob∣jects of this Tragedy are the Balets of the <HI>Sieur de Beauchamp</HI>'s Composition, which are danced between the Acts. When all is done they make a
<PB N="45" REF="111"/>
distribution of Prizes to those that merit best, without any regard to the Quality of the Person; which occasions great Emulation among the Youth, and makes them use the utmost of their endea∣vours to gain a Prize, which the King gives, in the View of such an Assembly.</P>
<P>As you go from hence, a little higher in the Street, you have</P>
<P><HI>The Church of St. Estienne des Grecs,</HI> the first and oldest of <HI>Paris.</HI> St. <HI>Denis</HI> Bishop of this Town, as some think, was the Founder. It is not any way considerable, but for its Antiquity. Report says, That St. <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Sales,</HI> Bishop and Prince of <HI>Geneva,</HI> made his Vows of Chastity and Poverty in this Church, before the Chappel of our Lady <HI>de bonne delivrance</HI> here, in which there is a very great Devotion. Over against this is</P>
<P>The <HI>Convent of Jacobius,</HI> formerly called <HI>Fri∣ers Preachers</HI> of the Order of St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> whose first Foundation is alledged to be in the life time of that Saint, who lived in the Year 1217. un∣der the Pontificate of <HI>Honorius</HI> the Third, and in the Reign of <HI>Philip Augustus.</HI> Historians say, that St. <HI>Dominick</HI> took great pains, about the Extirpa∣tion of the Heresie of the <HI>Albigenses,</HI> who caus∣ed great disorders in <HI>Languedoc:</HI> and at the same time he sent two of his Religious to <HI>Paris,</HI> who were Lodged in a place called <HI>The Citizens Par∣lour,</HI> in the same place where now this Convent stands. They were called <HI>Jacobins,</HI> from the <HI>Ruë Saint Jacques.</HI> Their Church, as it now is, was built by order of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> if we may believe <HI>Belleforest,</HI> a faithful Historian. Here are many Tombs of great Lords, who for the most part were Princes of the Blood Royal of <HI>France.</HI> But in regard I did not design to search into Antiqui∣ties,
<PB N="46" REF="112"/>
I shall not here express their Names, which may be found in Father <HI>du Breüil.</HI> I will only ob∣serve, that among these famous Monuments is that of <HI>Humbert,</HI> the last Sovereign Prince of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> whose Title was <HI>Dauphin of Vionnois;</HI> the Tomb stands before the great Altar. History says, That seeing himself Childless, he sold this Province to <HI>Philip Augustus</HI> for a small Summ of Money, and him∣self embraced a Religious Life at <HI>Lyons,</HI> and en∣ter'd into the Order of St. <HI>Dominick;</HI> where he liv'd in very great Esteem with all good Men, and was chosen to be Prior of this Convent, and afterwards Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> This is his Epitaph:</P>
<P>Hic jacet R. Pater &amp; Dominus amplissimus <HI>HUM∣BERTUS,</HI> primo Viennae Delphinus, deinde relicto Principatu, Frater nostri Ordinis, Prior in hoc Con∣venru Parisiensi, ac demum Patriarcha Alexandrinus, &amp; perpetuns Ecclesiae Rhemensis Administrator, &amp; praecipuus bujus Conventus Benefactor. Obiit anno Domini <HI>1345.</HI> Maii <HI>22.</HI></P>
<P>Here lies the Reverend Father, and Most Ho∣nourable Lord <HI>HUMBERT,</HI> First Dauphin of <HI>Vienna,</HI> after that leaving his Principality, he became Brother of our Order, and Prior in this Convent at <HI>Paris,</HI> and at last Patriarch of <HI>Alex∣andria,</HI> perpetual Administrator of the Church of <HI>Rhemes,</HI> and chief Benefactor to this Convent. He Dyed in the Year of our Lord <HI>1345.</HI> May <HI>22.</HI></P>
<P>This Church hath nothing but what is ordina∣ry, yet is the great Altar very handsomly con∣trived;
<PB N="47" REF="112"/>
it is adorn'd with black Marble, and the Armes of the Cardinal of St. <HI>Cecily,</HI> Brother of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> which you see about it, speak it to be built at his Costs; and this he did in re∣gard he was of this Order. Over the Door go∣ing into the Sacristy, is a Picture of <HI>Valentine's,</HI> representing the Nativity of the Holy Virgin; which Piece Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> gave, to be placed over the great Altar; but when he perceived it to be too little, he left it to the Church, and it hath been placed here ever since. It is one of the most Beautiful pieces in all <HI>France,</HI> and the Cu∣rious esteem it highly. <HI>Felibien,</HI> in his Book which he Composed of the Lives and Works of the most Famous Painters, tells us, it is one of the best Pi∣ctures that ever came out of <HI>Italy</HI> into <HI>France.</HI> On one side of the great Altar, stands the Chap∣pel of our Lady of the Rosary. The Wainscot Work of which is very handsom. Here is a very great Devotion, by reason of the Indulgences, which are here to be gain'd every first Sunday of the Month. In the Cloister are several Paintings, but they are of no great Note; so also is their Li∣brary, which is not very numerous, yet it hath been made use of by very Famous Doctors. They preserve here one thing of great Curiosity, and that is the Pulpit of Great St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Aquiu,</HI> the Angel of the Schools. It is made of Wood, and inclosed in another of the same material, that it may not be injured by time. A General of this Order was at the charge of making that in which it is inclosed; and not along ago these Fathers have caused a small Room to be made, at the end of the Library, where this Pulpit is con∣veniently exposed to sight. 'Tis well known that St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Aquin</HI> formerly profest Divinity in
<PB N="48" REF="113"/>
this Convent, and in the great School, which we see at this day, he made his Lectures. It hath been Rebuilt at the beginning of this present Age, through the Alms which these Fathers collected in a Jubilee. Several Preachers of this House have acquired great Reputation in the World. Among others Father <HI>Chaussemer,</HI> who is esteemed one of the most Profound and Eloquent that we have at present; he Preached this <HI>Lent</HI> at <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> after he had perform'd the like at the <HI>Louvre.</HI> The deceased Monsieur <HI>Coëffeteau,</HI> who hath com∣posed a very Curious Roman History, past here the greatest part of his Life; with many others, whose names would be too long to insert here.</P>
<P>Before you leave the <HI>Rüe Saint Jacques,</HI> you ought to know, that here inhabit many Book∣sellers, who sell almost all of them, the Works of the <HI>Messieurs du Port-Royal,</HI> all the Works of Mon∣sieur <HI>Arnault,</HI> generally esteemed by all Learned Men: Here you will find the several pieces of the <HI>French Academicians;</HI> many Foreign Books; the several pieces that concern the <HI>Gallicane</HI> Church; all Monsieur <HI>Maimbourg</HI>'s Writings; here also are sold Father <HI>Bouhour</HI>'s Books; those of Father <HI>Ra∣pin;</HI> of the Bishop of <HI>Meaux;</HI> of the Abbot <HI>Flé∣chier,</HI> Almoner to Madam the Dauphiness, who Translated the Life of Cardinal <HI>Commendon,</HI> and composed for Monseigneur the Dauphin, the History of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Great, and four Funeral Orations. Many other Books proper for the perusal of curious Persons, are here also to be met with. In this Street also are many Gravers and Sellers of Prints, who have in their Shops great store of Maps, and Printed Pictures. Of which I shall say no more in this place. At the end of this Volume I may (perhaps) set down
<PB N="49" REF="113"/>
a Catalogue of such Books as are best Writ in our Language, for the use of Strangers, who of∣tentimes for want of better information, buy ve∣ry scurvy Books, instead of such as may be of use and advantage to them in their study of the French Tongue.</P>
<P>Without the <HI>Porte St. Jacques,</HI> in the <HI>Faux∣bourg</HI> of that name, you may observe many fine things, and in a greater number than in any other <HI>Faux-bourg</HI> about the Town.</P>
<P>On the left Hand, as you enter, is the Con∣vent of the <HI>Nuns of the Visitation,</HI> which makes no great shew. The Church it self is no bigger than an ordinary Hall. Yet is their Altar one of the richest that can be seen on the Feast Days, these Nuns sparing no Costs to adorn it with Candle∣sticks, Lamps, Vessels, Figures, and a Thou∣sand such like things, which are all of Silver, and most of them very weighty. But the place being none of the best contrived, these rich things ap∣pear not so well as they might do elsewhere. Going still forward, you pass before</P>
<P>The Parish Church of St. <HI>James,</HI> from which all this Quarter takes its name. It hath been re∣pair'd in such manner as we now see it by the late Dutchess of <HI>Longueville</HI> Sister of Monsieur the Prince, who was one of the most pious and Charitable Princesses of this Age. The Portal is of the Dorick Order, very well perform'd; and had that Virtuous Princess lived, she had doubt∣less given wherewithal to finish the Work: But she dyed about four years ago in the Convent of Carmelite Nuns, to the regret of abundance of poor People, who subsisted by her Almes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seminary of St. Magloire,</HI> is near the last mentioned place. This was formerly an Abby of
<PB N="50" REF="114"/>
St. <HI>Bennet</HI>'s Order, which was first Founded in the same place, where at present stands St. <HI>Bartholo∣mew</HI>'s Church, near the Pallace. But those good Religious Men, being troubled with the noise and Clutter of that place, changed their habitation in the Year 1138. and came to dwell here, which was at that time a good way out of the Town, where there was already a Chapel built and de∣dicated to St. <HI>George.</HI> After that in the Year 1549. The Monks of St. <HI>Bennet</HI> did altogether quit this House, and transfer'd themselves to o∣ther Houses of the same Order, the Revenue of this being given to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Paris.</HI> And in the Room of the Monks they placed here certain <HI>Penitent Nuns,</HI> but they continued not long. In fine, the Priests of the Oratory were introduced here in the beginning of this present Age, whose Institution is to instruct the Young Ecclesiasticks in the Functions of their Mini∣stry.</P>
<P>Further in this Street are the <HI>Ʋrsuline Nuns;</HI> whose Church is but small, yet is their Altar of a very handsom design, and adorn'd with Pillars of black Marble. These Nuns teach freely young Girles not only to Read and Write, but also seve∣ral sorts of Works proper for them, which is of great advantage to the publick. They were first Founded here in the Year 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. by <HI>Made∣moisel de Saint Beuve,</HI> a Lady of extraordinary Piety, and Queen <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> laid the first Stone of their Church, in the Year 1620. <HI>June</HI> 22.</P>
<P>The <HI>Feüillantines</HI> are on the same side of the way, they are Nuns of St. <HI>Bernard</HI>'s Order, re∣form'd by the blessed <HI>John de la Barriere,</HI> and were first established in <HI>Paris</HI> 1622. through the Sol∣licitation
<PB N="51" REF="114"/>
of Queen <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Austria.</HI> Their Church hath been some Years ago rebuilt anew, with considerable Expence. It is very lightsom, and the Portal is not ill contriv'd: It was design∣ed by the Sieur <HI>Merot.</HI> One of their Bene∣factresses hath contributed largely to the Charges. Over the great Altar is a very good Copy from <HI>Raphael,</HI> of the <HI>Holy Family,</HI> the ori∣ginal of which is in the King's Cabinet. The Grate of their Quire is adorn'd with Copper gilt.</P>
<P>Nor far from thence are <HI>the English Bene∣dictines,</HI> who have also built a new Church, which is really something of the least, but in re∣compence of that, it is very well adorn'd. It is set off with Pilasters, and the Altar is accom∣pany'd with Pillars and Figures, which shew ve∣ry handsomly; the Wainscot Work of the Stalls for the Monks, is very pretty, and the little Cha∣pel of the Holy Virgin, which stands over against the Door, is very neat. The Religious who inha∣bit this House are originally <HI>English,</HI> and are come for refuge into <HI>France,</HI> on the account of Reli∣gion. The late Queen-Mother gave them great Alms, as did also many other persons of Piety, and some <HI>English.</HI> There is a Person of Quality inter'd with them, who hath been a Benefactor, as may be seen by his Epitaph.

<HEAD>The Carmelite Nuns.</HEAD>
<P>THis was sometimes call'd <HI>Nostre-Dame des Champs.</HI> The Church belonging to these Nuns is one of the oldest in <HI>Paris;</HI> most Anti∣quaries believe it to be one of those which St. <HI>Denis</HI> Founded. Some modern Authors write that it was formerly a Temple of the Goddess <HI>Ceres,</HI> or else of <HI>Mars;</HI> but for this opinion they have no very good Foundation: For we find nothing in the antient Historians to warrant such a Con∣jecture. It is much more certain, that it apper∣tain'd a long time to the Order of St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> and that it was a Priory depending on the great Abby of <HI>Marmoutier,</HI> near the City of <HI>Tours.</HI> Whose antient Title to this place is still in being; and the Bishop of <HI>Orleans,</HI> who is Abbot there, receives from hence Four or Five thousand Li∣vres <HI>per annum.</HI> In the Year 1604. were placed here certain <HI>Carmelite Nuns</HI> of St. <HI>Teresa</HI>'s re∣form, whom the Cardinal <HI>de Berulla</HI> fetch'd him∣self out of <HI>Spain,</HI> at such time when this Reform began to be so famous in Christendom, for its great austerity. This House was the first in all the Kingdom, that took the Rule of St. <HI>Teresa,</HI> and from hence it is that all the other Convents of <HI>Paris,</HI> and in the other parts of <HI>France,</HI> took their original. At present this Nunnery is very numerous, and there are in it many persons of the greatest Quality, who quitting the World, come to end their days here.</P>
<P>Their Church is one of the fairest, and most magnificent that can be seen, the main Body of
<PB N="53" REF="115"/>
the Building is, in truth, very antient, but the modern Ornaments within it make sufficient amends for that. As you go in you may observe, that it is all painted in imitation of black Mar∣ble vein'd with White; and that the Balustrades or Partitions of the Chapels are of a Wainscot, extraordinary finely gilt: But the most curious things of all are the great Pictures placed under every Window, in Frames richly Carved and gilt. There are six of these Pictures on each side, each representing some principal Pas∣sage of the New Testament. They are the Work of the famousest Painters of this Age. The First, on the left hand as you enter, repre∣senting the Miracle of the Five Loaves, was done by <HI>Stella.</HI> The Second represents the Feast at the House of <HI>Simon</HI> the Leper, where the <HI>Mag∣dalen</HI> perfum'd our Lord's Feet, and this was done by Monsieur <HI>le Brun.</HI> The Third represent∣ing the triumphal entry of our Lord into <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> is the Work of <HI>de la Hire.</HI> The Fourth is the Story of the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman, and is also done by <HI>Stella;</HI> the Colours and the Dra∣pery of this Picture is excellent. The Fifth is Monsieur <HI>le Brun</HI>'s; and the Sixth representing the Transfiguration, is <HI>de la Hire</HI>'s. Those on the other side were all done by <HI>Champaign,</HI> and that able Master never made any better Pieces than these, as one may easily observe. The Al∣tar of this Church stands very high, and is all of Marble, as well the body of the Work as the Pil∣lars, which are of the Corinthian Order, their Ca∣pitals of Brass gilt. The Tabernacle is all of Sil∣ver, and represents the Ark of the Covenant; on the forepart of which there is a great Bas-relief very well Carved. On Feast Days
<PB N="54" REF="116"/>
this Altar is adorn'd with Vases, Candlesticks, and divers things of that sort, which make a very handsom shew without Confusion. Over against the Grate of the Quire, where the Nuns sing, is a great Picture representing the Angelick Salu∣tation. It is the Work of <HI>Guido,</HI> and ought to be esteem'd as one of the best pieces that can be seen, even in <HI>Italy</HI> it self. The several Chapels correspond to the magnificence of the Church, especially that which is dedicated to the <HI>Magda∣len,</HI> in which there hangs an excellent Picture of that Saint, done by Monsieur <HI>le Brun,</HI> one of the best, perhaps, that ever he made. The Saint is represented weeping under a Rock, tearing her Hair and Ornaments, and trampling them under Foot, her Eyes are all drown'd in Tears, through which her Complection but faintly ap∣pears; briefly, one cannot imagine a piece of Painting more feelingly exprest and none can see it without more compassion for such a Penitent. Over against the Altar in this small Chapel is placed, in a kneeling posture, the Statue of Cardinal <HI>de Berulle,</HI> Institutor of the Priests of the Oratory, to whom these Nuns are much obliged, as hath been already said. His Statue is of white Marble, and made by <HI>Sarazin,</HI> in the Year 1657. It is raised on a Pedestal of four sides, on which are several very good Bas-reliefs, wrought by an able Sculptor named <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt,</HI> the same who made the curious Pulpit at <HI>St. Eslienne,</HI> of which I have already spoken in this Second Part p.. On each side are two Pillars of black Marble, on the top of which are certain Hames of Brass gilt, so also are the Capitals, which are of the Ionick Or∣der, and very well wrought. The rest of the Cha∣pel is adorn'd with Pictures of Monsieur <HI>le Brun</HI>'s

<P>The other Chapels want but little of the same Beauty. The further part of the Church ter∣minates in a great Tribune (or Gallery) the Windows of which are grated, into this Gallery
<PB N="56" REF="117"/>
the Religious Women come to hear the Sermon, when the Preachers preach in the Nave of the Church. In the fore part of this Gallery are placed two Statues, one of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and the other of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and on the top, the representation of St. <HI>Michael</HI> overcoming the Devil, which is of a very curious Invention: It was the Work of <HI>Stella,</HI> before mentioned. All the Roof is very well Painted after the manner of Cartouches: Between the Cordons you ought to take notice of a Crucifix, accompanied with the Holy Vir∣gin and St. <HI>John,</HI> which are wrought with so much Art, that the Figures seem to stand upon a real bottom. This is a pleasing fallacy to those that mind it. Finally, the last remarkable thing to be observed in this Church, is the Crucifix of Brass over the Balustrade, that divides the Quire from the Nave. The Curious esteem it highly; it was made by <HI>Sarazin,</HI> who had the reputation of one of the ablest Men of his time.</P>
<P>As you go from hence through the Court, you may observe a small House, built after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, composed of two Pavillions, very handsom, with a Garden before the House, through which you pass as you go in.

<HEAD>VAL <HI>de</HI> GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>HEre it is that all Strangers are forced to grant, that we can raise in <HI>France</HI> as fine Buildings and as regular, as those in <HI>Italy</HI> so much admired by Travellers. We may also af∣firm, without vanity, that this magnificent House, if consider'd in all its parts, is one of the most beautiful Works of all this Age.</P>
<P>It ought to be observed that the Nuns of <HI>Val de Grace</HI> were formerly Founded near the Village of <HI>Bierre,</HI> about Three Leagues from <HI>Paris,</HI> in a very incommodious place by reason of the Ma∣rish Grounds, called there <HI>le Val profond,</HI> or the deep Vale; being very Sickly in this place, they Petition'd <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. for his permission to come and inhabit in <HI>Paris.</HI> Queen <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> his Illustrious Wife, being acquainted with their merit, chiefly from one of their Company, named <HI>Margaret d'Arbouse,</HI> by whose means she took a particular affection to them, declar'd her self their Foundress. She caused them in the Year 1621. to be lodged in the <HI>Faux-bourg St. Jac∣ques,</HI> in an old House then called the <HI>Hôtel d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Valois,</HI> which was pull'd down to make way for those Buildings, which have been since erected. Some Years after, that illustrious Queen, by way of thanksgiving for the happy Birth of the now King, whom God gave to <HI>France</HI> after Twenty Years expectation, caused the Foundation to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid of that glorious Edifice which we now see. Monsieur <HI>Mansard,</HI> so often already mention'd,
<PB N="58" REF="118"/>
who was at that time the most esteemed Architect of <HI>France,</HI> was made choice of for this Work, and the designs which he drew were admired by all Men. He carryed up the work as high as the first Floor, but then for some Reasons he was changed, and other Architects employed in his place, to wit, <HI>le Due, le Muet,</HI> and <HI>du Val,</HI> who perform'd their parts so well, that <HI>Mansard</HI> was not mist, tho' so great a Master. In disgust to be thus used he undertook to build the Chapel at <HI>Château de Fresne,</HI> seven Leagues from <HI>Paris,</HI> for Monsieur <HI>de Guenegaud,</HI> Secretary of State; where he per∣formed in little that magnificent design, which he drew out at first for <HI>Val de Grace,</HI> and thereby made that Chapel one of the finest Structures in the Kingdom, as all who have seen it unani∣mously agree. But though the building at <HI>Val de Grace,</HI> is admirable in its present condition, yet it hath been effected with abundance of pains, and with excessive Charges, chiefly in laying the Foundation, by reason of the Quarries which they met with in digging. The present condition of this place is as follows:</P>
<P>First you enter into a great Court, which lies before the principal Door; this Court is separa∣ted from the Street by a Pallisade of Iron, at the extremities of which are two square Pavillions; on the right Hand and on the left it is bounded with certain Stone Works, adorn'd with rustick Pillars, which make a very handsom Shew. At the further part of this Court is the great Portal, raised upon Six steps. But that which makes it most remarkable, is, that it is after the manner of a Portico composed of Four great Corinthian Pillars, with Niches on each side, in which are placed St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> and St. <HI>Scholastica,</HI> of white
<PB N="59" REF="118"/>
Marble. On the Frise is this Inscription in Let∣ters of Gold:</P>
<Q LANG="lat">JESU NASCENTI, VIRGINIQUE MATRI.</Q>
<Q>To the Child JESƲS, and his Virgin Mo∣ther.</Q>
<P>The Front of the Portal is of two Orders of Pillars, the Corinthian and the Composite, with all their proper Ornaments. If the outside appears great, the inside is still infinitly more magnificent. All the Church is paved with Marble of divers Colours. And the compartments are correspon∣dent to the <HI>Cartouches</HI> of Sculpture, and to the <HI>Guillochis</HI> (or Flourishings) in the Roof, where there are several Bas-tailles of admirable Work∣manship. This Roof is of Stone as white as Mar∣ble, and it is throughout enriched with Orna∣ments of the best sort, in which Monsieur <HI>An∣guerre</HI> has surpast all. On each side of the Nave are Three Chapels, divided asunder by Two great Pilasters, which support the Cornish that runs round the Church, and supports the Arches of the Roof. The Quire is directly un∣der the Dome at the further end of the Nave, from which it is parted only by a grate of Iron gilt. Four great Arches support the Dome; and the great Altar is placed under the futher∣most Arch. It is of a very singular design, com∣posed of Six great twisted Pillars of the Composite Order. They are of black Marble vein'd with
<PB N="60" REF="119"/>
white; of which sort there are hardly any others to be found in <HI>Europe;</HI> they are raised upon Pe∣destals of Marble also, and they are all over en∣riched with Palms and <HI>Feüillages</HI> of Brass gilt, which make a wondrous beautiful Show. One may truly say that the contrivance of these Pillars is, in some respects, more magnificent, than those of the great Altar at St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s in <HI>Rome,</HI> which were designed by the Cavalier <HI>Bernin.</HI> These excel in number and in the beauty of the Workmanship. They stand in a great Circle, raised about two Foot, and make a kind of Pa∣villion open on all sides, forming Six <HI>Conso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes,</HI> at the feet of which are Angels holding Censing∣pots. These Pillars are joined together by great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estons of Palms, about which little Angels hold certain Scrowles, in which are writ seve∣ral Verses of the
<Q>Gloria in Excelsis Deo.</Q>
<Q>Glory be to God on high.</Q>
The whole is of the best sort of gilding without any Colours Upon the Altar, which is placed in the middle of these Pillars, the Infant <HI>JESUS</HI> is represented lying in his Cradle, all of white Marble, accompanied by the Holy Virgin and St. <HI>Joseph▪</HI> these are all of Monsieur <HI>Anguerre</HI>'s Work, and reckoned among the best things that ever he did. Behind the great Altar you see a Grate in a kind of Pavillon, of Marble also. To this place the Nuns come to make their Pray∣ers, when the Holy Sacrament is exposed. The inside of this place is very beautiful, but in re∣gard it is difficult to be seen, I shall not here say
<PB N="61" REF="119"/>
any thing of that subject. Between the Arches which support the Dome, in the Corners stand the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Evangelists in Sculpture, well worth your exact Observation; and a little lower are as many gilt Balconies placed over the like num∣ber of little Chapels, which are contrived out of the thickness of the Work. But tho' all these things are admirable, yet these are not the chief Rarities, the Painting on the inside of the Dome will give much more pleasure to the lovers of Art; it represents the Glories of the Blessed in Heaven, who are placed in several <HI>Groupes,</HI> the Apostles, the Prophets, the Martyrs, the Vir∣gins, and the Confessors, each of which are di∣stinguisht and known by some particular remarks, the Kings, the Patriarchs, the Heads of Orders, the Fathers of the Church, St. <HI>Bennet</HI> and St. <HI>Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stioa;</HI> in the lower parts are placed the Altar, and the Candlestick of Seven Branches, and in a word, all that the Scripture discovers to us of Paradise. In the upper part the sight loses it self in an infinite space, which appears full of confused and faint Objects, by reason of a vast distance, and a great light that strikes out from the highest of all. All this delicate Painting is in <HI>Fresco,</HI> and the Work of M. <HI>Mig∣nard,</HI> who did the Hall and Gallery at St. <HI>Cloud.</HI> In the Frise at the bottom you may read this In∣scription:</P>
<Q LANG="lat">ANNA AUSTRIA D. G. FRANCO∣RUM REGINA, REGNIO. REC∣TRIX, CUI SUBJECIT DEUS OMNES HOSTES, UT CONDE∣RET DOMUM IN NOMINE SUO, Ecc. A. M. D. C. L.</Q>
<Q><PB N="62" REF="120"/>
<HI>ANNE</HI> of <HI>AUSTRIA,</HI> by the Grace of God Queen of France, and Regent of the Kingdom, to whom God subdued all her Enemies, that she might build a House in his Name.</Q>
<P>On the right Hand and on the left of the great Altar, are the two Grates which take up all the void space between the side Arches. They are of an extraordinary greatness, and the like were never made of the bigness, besides they are wrought with such delicate Art, as if the Iron had been as soft and easie to form as Lead. That on the right side encloses the Nuns Quire from the Church, which is large and well Wainscot∣ted▪ They have in it a small Organ which they use on Festivals, at such time as they sing their Service Musically, which they perform to the great pleasure of their hearers, they having among them some very excellent Voices. On the other side is a great Chapel▪ all hung with Mourning, in the middle of which is erected a Hearse of black Velvet upon Four or Five Steps; here are reposited the Hearts of the Queen-Mo∣ther their Illustrious Benefactress, the Queen whom we have so lately lost, with others of several Prin∣cesses of the Blood Royal, among the rest that of Madam the Dutchess of <HI>Orleans.</HI></P>
<P>Before we leave this place we ought to observe the Cyfer, which is at the bottom of the steps of the Altar, composed only of two Letters L. and A. encompassed about with Palms, and other <HI>Feüillages</HI> of white Marble. There are here ma∣ny
<PB N="63" REF="120"/>
other things worth observation, which would be painful to set down in writing, but the Curi∣ous when they come hither will easily find 'em out. The inside of the Convent corresponds ex∣actly well to the magnificence of the Church. The several Cells and the Offices are regularly disposed, and built with solidity, particularly the Apartment of the Queen-Mother, disposed in such manner as may befit a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>puchin Nun. The Nuns are very austere, for they observe the reformed Rule of St. <HI>Bennet.</HI> They choose their Abbess from among their own Community, whose Authority is only Triennial. Their chief Revenues arise from the Abby of St. <HI>Corneille</HI> in <HI>Compiegne,</HI> which is annext to this House.</P>
<P>As you go from hence you must not forget to observe the outside of the Church, and the Or∣naments about the Dome, which appears of a very great height: it is cover'd with Lead, with great Bands gilt; and on the top a Balustrade of Iron, round about the little Lanthorn open on all sides; over that is the great Ball, and there∣upon the Cross. All these things are set off glo∣riously with Gildings, and which way soever you enter into <HI>Paris,</HI> this Dome is so big and so high, that it may be easily discover'd a great way off.</P>
<P>After you have seen <HI>Val de Grace,</HI> you ought next to go to</P>
<P><HI>The Convent of the Capuchins,</HI> behind which there lies a very great enclosed piece of Ground, which extends a great way into the Fields, and serves in Summer for a very delightsom Walk. their Cloister is but small, according to the manner of building used by those good Friers.
<PB N="64" REF="121"/>
Within it on the Walls they have set up several Inscriptions in <HI>French</HI> Verse, to excite the Devo∣tion of such as walk there.</P>
<P>In the Street over against the <HI>Capuchins</HI> going into the <HI>Rue d'Enfer,</HI> stands</P>
<P><HI>The Convent of the Bernardin-Nuns,</HI> according to the Reform of <HI>Port Royal.</HI> Their Church is very neat; it was designed by the <HI>Steur le Pau∣tre;</HI> tho' it be but small, yet it hath some Beau∣ties which are not found in greater. The late Queen-Mother brought these Nuns from the famous Abby of <HI>Port Royal des Champs</HI> near <HI>Ver∣sailles,</HI> in the Year 1625, in which place they were very numerous and of great Reputation, and placed them here; this House being then called the <HI>Hôtel de Clagni.</HI> They have in this Church a great Devotion, by reason of one of the Holy thorns of our Lords Crown, in favour of which some great Miracles have been done. Their Altar-piece representing the last Supper, was painted by Monsieur <HI>Champagne.</HI> They have also here an antique <HI>Amphora</HI> or Waterpot, which as some pretend, was one of those which were made use of at the Marriage of <HI>Cana.</HI></P>

Mathematicians. It consists of a great Body of Stone-work two Stories high; the Windows of which are round at the top, and about fourteen Toises high (a Toise is Six Foot.) The forepart of the Building is made with Towers Eight An∣gular of the same height, with a great Esplanade in manner of a Tarrass, with fronts about the whole Building. The Tower on the East side is open at the top, and without any Roof, that so one may see the better from the bottom. Between these two Towers are several great Rooms, which are not yet furnisht with such things as are to be there. But that which is most remarkable in this Building, is, that there is not used about it either Iron or Wood, and yet the Roof of it is extreamly solid. The Stair-case is the finest that can be imagined; it is all of Stone laid after a way extraordinary, hardy and bold from the bottom to the top; and the Iron Rail that winds the whole length of these Stairs is very well wrought. It is 156 Steps high and leads to the Tarrass. In regard this Building consists of seve∣ral stories, it hath several vaulted Roofs one over the other, the uppermost of which consists of an Arch of a large extent, flat on the outside, and paved with Hint-stones, cut exactly and bound together with Cement, that the Rain may not penetrate and damnifie the Vaults be∣neath. The Curious may if they please go down into the Caves or Grotto's which are extream deep, since the Stair-case that leads down con∣tains One hundred threescore and eleven Steps; in the middle of which they have contrived a void hollow space in manner of a Well, which pierces through all the Rooms, and extends up to the top of the Tarrass, so that through this hole you
<PB N="66" REF="122"/>
may see the light to the very bottom of the Cave. It is said that this was made on purpose to see the Stars at Noon-day. But it seems it fails of effect, for no body has yet seen them, tho' it hath been often endeavour'd. This place which they call <HI>le Puits</HI> (the Well) contains 28 Toises (56 yards) from the bottom of it to the vent at the top.</P>
<P>In the several Apartments, especially in those belonging to M. <HI>Cassini,</HI> are several curi∣ous Mathematical Instruments, as Globes, Pen∣dulums, and chiefly Glasses of very great Di∣mensions, with which these Learned Men ob∣serve the course of the Stars. There are only Four Mathematicians who lodge in the Observa∣tory, part of those who compose the Academy of Sciences, established at the King's Cabinet, as we have formerly noted; and they are M. <HI>Cassini,</HI> originally an <HI>Italian,</HI> and formerly one of the great Dukes Academy at <HI>Florence,</HI> where he had attain'd great Reputation. He takes here a great deal of pains in Astronomy, and hath made many discoveries in that Art, for which the King gives him a considerable Pension. M. <HI>de la Hire,</HI> M. <HI>Couplet</HI> who teach the Mathematicks to the Pages belong-to the great Stable; the Deceased M. the Abbot <HI>Picard</HI> was one of those, but his place is not yet supply'd, and M. <HI>Hugens,</HI> a <HI>Hollander,</HI> hath here also an Apartment, tho' he doth not com∣monly abide in it. These Gentlemen meet to∣gether upon certain days, and communicate the Observations which they have severally made, and sometimes they Print them also for publick satisfaction. Every Year M. <HI>Cassini</HI> publishes about <HI>Newyearstide</HI> a small Volume, called <HI>La Connoissance des temps,</HI> by which one may know
<PB N="67" REF="122"/>
the Course of the Planets, and other Curiosities of that nature, much more exact and regular than any thing hitherto seen on the subject. They have here a small square Chamber over the forepart of the Tarrass, in which those who speak at the oppo∣site Corners may easily understand one another, and yet those in the middle not perceive it. This is occasion'd by reason the Roof is Vaulted hol∣low, and the Angles are continued along the Roof from one side to the other, without any ob∣struction. After you have seen the <HI>Observatory,</HI> as you go out you ought to take notice of</P>
<P><HI>The Water-House,</HI> which stands near the Gate as you go out next the <HI>Ruë d'Enfer.</HI> This House was built to receive the Water that comes from the Village of <HI>Rongis</HI> in that Curious Aqueduct, which Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> caused to be built at <HI>Arcüeil,</HI> which the Curious ought to visit as one of the finest in all <HI>France.</HI> You ought to know that most of the Fountains in <HI>Paris</HI> come from this Receiver or Conduit, which makes its first discharge at <HI>Luxembourg-House,</HI> from whence afterwards the Waters divide themselves to all parts of the City.</P>

<P>THis Monastery was built by the King St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> who gave to the Religious of St. <HI>Bruno's</HI> Order, the old House or <HI>Château</HI> of <HI>Vauvert,</HI> where at that time, as Historians say, Devils did inhabit, and caused there so many disorders, that by Arrest of Parliament the Town Gate which led into that Street was wall'd up. The Street which lies before the House does still retain the old name, and it is for this reason that it was first; called the <HI>Rüe d'Enfer</HI> (or Hell Street.) But since these good Fathers became possest of the place, they quickly expell'd the evil Spirits; and St. <HI>Lewis</HI> having a great esteem of the Austere and Holy Life that they led, made them a Visit with his whole Court, and confer'd upon them sufficient Lands and Demesnes for their Subsistence. Many persons did contribute to the building of their House, which takes up more Ground than any other Religious House does at present in all the Town and Suburbs of <HI>Paris.</HI> Besides that the Cells are large, and that they have each a separate Garden; they have also a great Close containing many <HI>Arpens</HI> of Land, which encompasses the whole House. The Church hath nothing in it extraordinary, except the Seats of the Religious, which were made about two Years ago, and are the finest wrought that were ever yet seen. The Wainscot is per∣fectly handsome, and adorn'd with Sculpture that makes a delicate appearance: These are
<PB N="69" REF="123"/>
composed of small Corinthian Pilasters which support the Cornish; one of the Fathers of the House designed them and managed the Work. They now begin to place some Pictures between the <HI>Croisées.</HI> The first which hath been placed here is done by M. <HI>Audran,</HI> the second by Monsi∣eur <HI>Coipel,</HI> and in time the whole Quire may be furnisht in this manner, which will considerably beautifie the Church.</P>
<P>The little Cloister which lies on one side of this Church, is the only thing that is rare and singu∣lar belonging to these fathers. It is adorn'd with a Dorick Architecture of Pilaster fashion. Between the Arches are several Pictures repre∣senting the Life of St. <HI>Bruno</HI> their Founder, and in certain <HI>Cartouches</HI> adjoyning to each Picture, the Life of that Saint in <HI>Latin</HI> Verses. The Pictures which hang at the Corners of the Cloi∣ster, represent the views of several remarkable places, among others of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> of the <HI>Grand Chartreuse</HI> near <HI>Grenoble,</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> on the Louvre side as it shew'd before the old Tow∣er was taken down, and the <HI>Port-neuve,</HI> which stood not far from the <HI>Pont-rouge;</HI> the rest are only fancies of the Painter. All the Painting of this Cloister was done by <HI>Le Sueur,</HI> who never did any thing finer than these Pieces here. Of late days they have contrived Wooden Shuts in which they shut them up, that they may not be inju∣red, as certain persons who envy the Merit and Reputation of that incomparable Man, have at∣tempted to do. They do not open these Pictures but upon certain Days, or when Curious Peo∣ple desire to see them. It is apparent that bet∣ter Paintings than these cannot be; yet had he lived we should have had from him things in∣finitely
<PB N="70" REF="124"/>
more perfect; but his fate was like that of <HI>Raphaël,</HI> who dyed in an Age when his admirable Genius began to make him known. That which remains to be seen in this House is the Refectory, which is very lightsom. Here the Religious never Eat but upon Festivals, Sundays and Thurs∣days; upon other days they take their repasts in their several Cells, which are disposed in a square place round about their Church-Yard or Cemetery. These Cells are composed of Four or Five small Rooms all on a Floor, Boarded throughout, and very simply furnisht. Some of these Fathers have by them very curious Libra∣ries, the Father <HI>Vicar</HI> hath one which is much esteemed. Some of them employ themselves in∣dustriously in divers Works, thereby to pass more easily their time of Solitude, which is very rigorous in regard they are never permitted to go out of the House, nor to receive any Visits but at certain hours. And it is well and judici∣ously observed by one of our Historians, that the principal reason why these Fathers have preserved the purity of their first Institute better than the other Orders, is because they have always shun'd with extream care the great Commerce of the World, and the Visits of Women: Two Dangerous Rocks for the Monastick Life.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Carthusians</HI> stands the little Convent of <HI>the Feüillans,</HI> in which is nothing extraordina∣ry. But not far from this Convent dwells M.—who hath a very neat Garden of the design of M. <HI>le Nostre.</HI></P>
<P>From hence you descend to the <HI>Porte St. Mi∣chael,</HI> which was taken down two Years since, to enlarge the Passage, which before that was very strait and inconvenient. In the same place where
<PB N="71" REF="124"/>
the Gate stood, is built a Fountain under a great Arch in manner of a Niche, with a small Porti∣co of the Dorick Order beneath; but the Or∣naments are not yet quite finished. Here you come into the <HI>Ruë de la Harpe,</HI> and so you may go on to the Colledge of</P>

<P>THis beautiful House requires to be treated of with a particular application, in regard it is one of the principal Ornaments of <HI>Paris,</HI> as well for the great reputation of those Learn∣ed Men which come from hence, as for the beau∣ty of the Architecture in its buildings. Cardi∣nal <HI>de Richelieu</HI> beautified it as we see it at present. Before that it was but an old Colledge consist∣ing of very mean building, yet was it however a place of mighty great Reputation. It was first Founded by <HI>Robert de Sorbonne,</HI> Almoner to St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> who furnisht him with means wherewith to perform the Work, as apears by the following Inscription in the Church, graved on a Brass plate.</P>
<Q LANG="lat">LUDOVICUS REX FRANCO RUM, SUB QUO FUNDATA FUIT DOMUS SORBONAE. CIRCA ANNUM DOMINI. <LB/> 
M CCLII.</Q>
<Q LANG="eng"><HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> by whose Favour this House of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> was Founded about the Year of our Lord <HI>M CCLII.</HI></Q>
<P><PB N="72" REF="125"/>
The Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> who took all occasions to Immortalize his Name, caused this Colledge to be Rebuilt, and spared no Costs to make it truly magnificent. For this purpose he employed the Sieur <HI>Mercier</HI> an able Architect, who after some Years time brought the work almost to the point of per∣fection as we see it; however it was not quite finisht by him, for he dyed before he could give it his last Hand. That which we are first to observe is the square place before the Church Door, and hath a Passage into the <HI>Ruë de la Harpe.</HI> This place is, in truth, not large, by reason of some Houses built before it, belong∣ing to the Colledge <HI>des Tresoriers,</HI> however this hinders not but that it is very handsom. On both hands it is fronted with very fair Houses. On one hand is a great Body of Lodgings stone built of Two Stories high, in Bossage Rustick; and here is the Divinity School for those Scholars who come from abroad to hear the Lectures which are made here by Six Doctors, Three in the Morning and Three in the Afternoon, who change from hour to hour. This School is great and high, and it is sometimes made use of when a Thesis is maintain'd by some Person of Qua∣lity. On the Right Hand in this Court is the Chapel belonging to the Colledge of <HI>Clugni.</HI> It takes up almost one side of this Court, and makes no unhandsom Show, although it be of Go∣thick building; but gives the Beholder occasion to observe with pleasure, the difference between that gross and Rustick sort of building in the Ages past, and the regular and studied manner now used in this. As you enter into this open place or Court, and cast your Eyes upon
<PB N="73" REF="125"/>
the Portal of the Church, you cannot desire a finer object. The proportions are so true, and the points of the view so well contrived, that the distant parts of this Edifice seem to stand over the Portal, and to be placed in the stand∣ing where they are, to serve for a greater Or∣nament to the Front. The Dome is none of the highest. It is accompanied like that of <HI>Val de Grace,</HI> with Four little ones, with Statues, with bands of Lead gilt, and with a Balustrade of Iron about the little Lanthorn which is on the top of all the work. All these different things do agree so well one with another, that one can∣not wish to see a more beautiful piece of Ar∣chitecture. The Portal of the Church consists of Two orders of Pillars, Corinthian, and Com∣posite. The second Story are only Pilasters. Both above and below, between the Pillars, are Niches, in which are placed Statues of very good Workmanship; as also are those on the outside, and those within, between the Corinthian Pila∣sters that support the Roof. The inside of the Church is but small, and is not altogether so light as it might have been; however, all things there are well disposed: The Pavement is of Marble: The Dome is very well painted, and so are the Four Fathers of the Church which are between the Arcades that sustain it; these are in Fresquo, and of colours very shining. The great Altar is not yet begun; but doubt∣less it will be magnificent, if they follow the de∣signs which are shewn: It is to be all of Mar∣ble, composed of Six great Pillars of Jasper, with their Capitals and other Ornaments gilt. The lesser Altars, which are already finished, do promise, that if the great Altar be of the
<PB N="74" REF="126"/>
same gust, one cannot see any thing more deli∣cate. The Altar of the Virgin was finish'd not long ago; it is of white Marble, with Orna∣ments of Brass gilt, which shew admirably. From hence we ought to go into the inward parts of the House, in the midst of which is a square Court encompast about with Buildings, part of which are higher than the rest, which gives an air of Grandeur and Majesty to the Portico of the Church. As you see it on this side, hardly can any thing appear better: At the bot∣tom of this Court it appears raised upon Fifteen steps, and consists of ten great Corinthian Pillars, distant from the building more than Six Foot: These Pillars support a Fronton in which are the Armes of Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> with two Statues on each side. On the Freese you read this In∣scription:</P>
<Q LANG="lat">ARMANDUS JOANNES CARD. DUX DE RICHELIEU, SORBO∣NAE PROVISOR, AEDIFICAVIT DOMUM ET EXALTAVIT TEM∣PLUM SANCTUM DOMINO. <LB/>

<Q><HI>Armand John,</HI> Cardinal and Duke of <HI>Richelieu,</HI> Curator of the Sorbonne, built this House, and erected a Holy Temple to the Lord.
 <LB/> M. DC. XLII.</Q>
<P>Under this beautiful Portico you see the Door into the Church, which is of the same disposition
<PB N="75" REF="126"/>
with that of the <HI>Rotundae</HI> in <HI>Rome:</HI> The Archi∣tect has imitated it as near as he could. All the Apartments about this Court are inhabited by the Doctors of this House, who have a particular right to dwell here. Some of these Doctors have very pretty Libraries of their own, but these are not so easie to be seen as the great Library which is common to all the House, where all the Doctors study. It is very long and very high, and runs over the head of two great ground Rooms, in which the Sorbonnists maintain their Theses and Disputations. M. <HI>le Masle,</HI> Prior <HI>des Roches,</HI> and Secretary to Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> gave the greatest part of the Books you see here, which are very good ones. Monsieur the Cardinal gave his also, among which are some very rare Manuscripts, distin∣guisht from others by his Armes on the Covers; among the rest, there is one of <HI>Titus Livius</HI> in two great Folio Volumes, written in Parchment, it is of an old Translation into French about the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, adorn'd with Mineatures at the beginning of every Chapter, and with Flourishes in the Margin, which are curiously Painted with that delicate Gold colour, the secret of which has been lost for these two last Ages, it having been formerly used as an ordina∣ry Colour, and is of such an admirable brightness that it never sullies. Besides this there are ma∣ny other very rare Manuscripts in one of the Presses at the end, on that side next the Chim∣ney, most of them bound in red Turkey Lea∣ther. In this Library are a greater number of Divinity Books than of any other sort. Besides you may may see here a great quantity of Bi∣bles of different sorts, which have been Collect∣ed
<PB N="76" REF="127"/>
together with great care. At each end there is a Chimney, over which are placed the Pi∣ctures of Monsieur the Cardinal in his Ceremo∣nious habit, and of Monsieur <HI>le Masle,</HI> both in their full length; over that next the door is a Bust of the Cardinal, in Brass, wrought by the Sieur <HI>Varin,</HI> which came from among the Goods of the Dutchess of <HI>Aiguillon,</HI> who after her death bequeath'd this, with other Goods, to this House, she having had the use of them during her Life, by the Will of the Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu</HI> her Un∣cle. There is also another lesser Library in a private place of the House, but it contains only those Books of which there has happen'd to be two of a sort in the great Library, or such as the other Library cannot hold, in regard the number does increase daily, because most Au∣thors present their Works here. The King himself hath presented to this place all the curi∣ous Prints which he has caused to be graved, of which there are four or five great Volumes in Folio, neatly bound, which are the Carousel, the Tapistries, the curious Dissections which have been made at the Academy of Sciences, and some others; in such sort as this Library ought to be esteem'd as one of the best and most numerous that can be seen, tho' it be not yet quite perfected. But it is with this as with others which are in greater esteem, it being almost im∣possible to render any one Library compleat, be∣cause of the difficulty of recovering some scarce Books, which oftentimes make the chief beauty of a▪ Library, and which cannot be met with without mighty pains. Besides since Printing, the number of Books is so increast, and there are so many publisht in all parts of the World, that all cannot be had.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="127"/>
Over the Church Door, on that side next the Place is the following Inscription:</P>
<Q LANG="lat">DEO OPT. MAX. <LB/> 
ARMANDUS CARDINALIS DE <LB/> RICHELIEU.</Q>
<Q>To Almighty God, <LB/> <HI>Armand</HI> Cardinal of <HI>Richelieu.</HI></Q>
<P>After you have seen the most Remarkable things in the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> you pass forward in the <HI>Rüe de la Harpe;</HI> turning back again through the open place before the Church, you come next to</P>
<P>The <HI>Colledge d'Harcour,</HI> one of the best of the University, in which they keep Exercise for the lower Schools, which are full of Pensioners, and such as come from abroad. The Gate is fair and of a very regular design, it is Vault fashion, adorn'd with Bossages, with a great Cornish, and an Attique over that. If they had contrived a Court before it, it would have appear'd with more advantage.</P>
<P>As you descend lower you pass by the Col∣ledges of <HI>Justice,</HI> of <HI>Baïeux,</HI> of <HI>Narbonne,</HI> and that of <HI>Séez,</HI> in which the Schools have been laid down for some years past.</P>
<P>Lower is the Church of St. <HI>Cosmus,</HI> in which there is nothing remarkable unless it be the Epitaph of Monsieur <HI>Dupuy,</HI> so well known to all Men of Learning. The House of St. <HI>Cosmue</HI> stands near this Church, in which House the Chirurgions do ordinarily meet to make their
<PB N="78" REF="128"/>
Dissections in relation to the Anatomy of humane Bodies, upon which sometimes they make Learn∣ed Lectures.</P>
<P>Over against the <HI>Rüe de Sorbonne,</HI> in the <HI>Rüe de Mathurins,</HI> stands the <HI>Hôtel de Cluni,</HI> belong∣ing to the Abbot of that name. This <HI>Hôtel</HI> was formerly call'd the <HI>Palais des Termes,</HI> because of some old Ruines here remaining of the <HI>Thermae</HI> or <HI>Baths,</HI> as some thought, of the Emperor <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate. And you ought not to neglect going for this purpose to a Neighbouring House in the <HI>Rüe de la Harpe,</HI> at the sign of the Iron-Cross, where the Messenger of <HI>Chartres</HI> lodges; you will see there several old Arches, which ar∣gue great Antiquity, and within them a kind of Hall whose Roof is very high, and contrived without <HI>Cordons;</HI> this is very likely to have been used for some profane Temple. The three Niches in the South Wall sorve to support this Conjecture, in regard they might have been so contrived for Statues, but we cannot determin any thing, and the silence of Historians in this matter leaves People at Liberty to make what Conjectures they please. The other parts are very well built, and assure us it was hereto∣fore some great House. The Roof is so strong that they have laid upon it so much Earth as to make a little Garden, in which are Flowers and small Trees growing; and those who dwell in the <HI>Hôtel de Cluni,</HI> come and walk here as on a Tarrass made on purpose.</P>
<P>This is all that is to be seen in this Street. Further on, and at the end of the <HI>Rüe de la vielle Bouclerie,</HI> which determines at the little open place before the <HI>Pont St. Michael,</HI> near to a House which almost makes the very Corner of the
<PB N="79" REF="128"/>
Street, you may observe a great stone, which serves for a Boundary, upon which is cut after an ugly fashion the Figure of a Man; but as ill as it is one may easily distinguish the Head. Historians tell us, That this is the representa∣tion of one call'd <HI>John le Clerc,</HI> a Locksmith by trade, and Porter of the Gate <HI>de Bussi;</HI> who in the time of those Troubles which happen'd in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Sixth, after the <HI>Pari∣sians</HI> had expel'd the <HI>Burgundians</HI> out of this City, where they had committed a thousand Disor∣ders, had the Treachery to open to them that Gate in the night time, which put the <HI>Burgesses</HI> into an Alarm. After all these troubles were over, the <HI>Parisians</HI> intending a revenge upon the Author of them, and not able to apprehend his person, he being fled, they caused his Esfigies to be made in stone, and by Sentence of the Provost of <HI>Paris,</HI> all the Inhabitants were order∣ed to cast something in his Face, in detestation of his Treason, and this was accordingly executed. Since that time this Statue has been removed to this place to keep off the Wheels of Coaches and Carts, from injuring the House where it stands. Turning on the left Hand you enter into</P>
<P>The <HI>Street of St. Andrew des Arcs.</HI> The Parish Church which gives name to this Street is consi∣derable for several things, which the Curious will meet with in it. It was formerly but a small Chapel, and stood in the middle of a Field, planted with Vines or Fruit-Trees, belonging to the Monks of St. <HI>Germain des Prez.</HI> But all these things have been alter'd a long time. Some think that this Church is called <HI>St. Andrew des Arcs,</HI> by reason of some old Arches that were
<PB N="80" REF="129"/>
hereabouts. The building it self hath nothing singular, but you ought not to neglect to go into this Church to see the Tombs of several Fa∣mous persons; such were <HI>Messieurs de Thou,</HI> whose Monuments are in the Chapel of <HI>St. Christo∣pher,</HI> which they built from the Ground. The name of these great Men hath attain'd so great veneration among the Learned, that most of them make no difficulty to say, That <HI>France</HI> ne∣ver produced more Illustrious Persons. And the History which was writ by one of them, is look'd upon as the very Model and best thing of the kind in these last Ages. It is writ in Latin, which has occasion'd Strangers not only to read it, but to have so great an esteem for it, that they apply themselves to this Historian more than any. In this Chapel you may see a Bust of Monsieur <HI>de Thou</HI> in Marble, with his Epitaph, which recites at large the great Imployments which he enjoy'd.</P>

persons of this Family who are here interr'd.</P>
<P>In St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Chapel, near this, are the Tombs of several Ancestors of the Chancellor <HI>Seguier,</HI> to whom <HI>France</HI> owes a great part of her Renown in Learning.

<P>On the same Church you may read the Epi∣taph of the Princess of <HI>Conti,</HI> who deceased in the Year 1668. and whose Piety is still Reve∣rend in the Eyes of the whole World. This is in the Quire on one side of the high Altar.

<HEAD>The Convent of <HI>Cordeliers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Monastery was built about the Year 1217. in the Pontificate of Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> the III. while St. <HI>Francis</HI> was yet living at <HI>Assisium</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> Some of the Religious Men of the new Order, which that great Saint did institute, came into <HI>France;</HI> the first who arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> were Lodged in the Houses of certain <HI>Burgesses;</HI> but afterwards at the Solicitation of the fore∣mentioned Pope, who writ to <HI>William</HI> then Bi∣shop of this City in their behalf, they were taken notice of; and in the Year 1230. <HI>Eudo,</HI> Abbot of <HI>St Germain des Prez,</HI> gave them the place where they now inhabit at this day. The Kings of <HI>France</HI> did after this become great Benefactors to them, St. <HI>Lewis</HI> gave more than all; he cau∣sed their Church to be built, not as we see it at present, but as it was before the Fire which hap∣pened here in the Year 1580. and reduced all into Ashes, and part also of the Convent, ruin∣ing many Marble Tombs of several Princes and Princesses of the Blood-Royal, which then stood in the Quire, but can hardly now be remem∣ber'd. However according to the report of <HI>Giles Corozet,</HI> these were the Principal; namely, that of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>France,</HI> Wife of <HI>Philip</HI> the hardy, Son of St. <HI>Lewis;</HI> of <HI>Jane</HI> Queen of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navarre,</HI> Wife of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fair, and Foundress of the Colledge of <HI>Navarre,</HI> as we have already said; the Heart of <HI>Philip</HI> the Long, and others whom it would be to no pur∣pose to mention. The Body of the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> is
<PB N="86" REF="132"/>
one of the most numerous of all <HI>Paris.</HI> There are always here resident a great number of Students, who come hither from divers parts of the King∣dom in order to take their Degrees of Doctor in Divinity, which makes them considerable among themselves. We have seen very great Men come from this House; among others <HI>Ni∣cholas de Lira,</HI> esteemed the most knowing of his Age in the Tongues, but more especially in Divinity; and <HI>John Scot,</HI> surnamed <HI>Doctor Subtilis,</HI> who through his profound Science hath raised a Singular Tenent taught and read in their Schools, which notwithstanding is founded on the Principles of <HI>Aristotle.</HI> The only Curiosity to be observed in the Convent of these Fathers, is their new Cloister which contains near a hundred Chambers all very neat and very light∣some, it is Square, and in the middle is a small Garden adorn'd with a Parterre and a Foun∣tain. The Four Coridors or Walks, which com∣pose this Cloister, are vaulted and adorn'd with the Armes of those pious Persons, who did con∣tribute to the Charges of the Building, which were not small. The Refectory, the Chapter-House and the Library are worth seeing; as for the Church it hath nothing Curious. There are in it two famous Brotherhoods, one of the Pilgrims of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the other of the third Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> who have here their several Chapels. As you go forth you ought to ob∣serve the Statue of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> over the Door, which Antiquaries think to be one of the likest to that great King that we have.</P>
<P>This Quarter hath been of late time much improved and beautified: they have made two new Streets that go into the <HI>Fossez</HI> of the <HI>Hôtel</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="132"/>
<HI>de Conde.</HI> In that next the Convent of the <HI>Cor∣deli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI> is contrived a little place (or open Court) before the Church door, which is not inconvenient: this Street is called <HI>Ruë de l'Ob∣servance,</HI> and the other <HI>Ruë de Tourain,</HI> because of the adjoyning <HI>Hôtel de Tours.</HI></P>
<P>Near this place did formerly stand the <HI>Porte Saint Germain,</HI> which some years ago was pulled down. In the place of which is erected a Foun∣tain, with this Inscription:</P>

<HEAD>The Abby of St. <HI>Germain des Prez.</HI></HEAD>
<P>KIng <HI>Childebert,</HI> Son of the Great <HI>Clouis</HI> was the Founder. Monsieur de <HI>Mezeray</HI> re∣ports the particulars of the Foundation, and tells us, That that King being in <HI>Spain</HI> in the year 543. in a War against the <HI>Visigoths,</HI> he laid Siege to the Town of <HI>Sarragossa</HI> in which they were refu∣ged: the Inhabitants finding themselves severe∣ly prest by the <HI>French,</HI> and thinking in imitation of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> to move their Enemies by some surprizing Action, they concluded to make a Procession about their Walls, in which they carried the Coat and other Reliques of St. <HI>Vin∣cent.</HI> At this sight <HI>Childebert</HI> was so effective∣ly concern'd, that he yeilded so far, that he was contented to depart with certain Presents which the Bishop made him, among other things that Coat, and those Reliques of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> which he brought with him to <HI>Paris,</HI> and to the honour of them built the Church, of which we are now about to speak.</P>
<P>This Abby hath had several Names; it was sometime called St. <HI>Croix,</HI> because of a piece of
<PB N="90" REF="134"/>
that Holy Wood placed here among the other Reliques which he brought with him: at present it bears the name of St. <HI>Germain,</HI> who was Abbot here, and Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and is here interr'd. On his Festival day, which is the 28th of <HI>May,</HI> they expose to publick view his Shrine, which is of Silver gilt, adorn'd with a great quantity of Precious Stones: It is of a Gothick kind of Work, but as curious and handsome as one can see. All that remains of <HI>Childebert</HI>'s Building is the principal Gate at the end of the Church, and the great Steeple over it, which appear ve∣ry ancient. The Statues of the Kings and Queens which are on the sides of this Gate, are of such a design as discovers that in that Age the Gust of good Sculpture was not known; for we can hardly distinguish whether the Statues re∣present Men or Women. The Tomb of the aforementioned King is in the middle of the Quire, raised about two foot and an half, with some Inscriptions added to it when they removed it hither from St. <HI>Germain</HI>'s Chapel, where it for∣merly was behind the Quire. This translation hapned about thirty or forty years ago, when the Church was Repair'd and Beautified as it now is. At the same time they made over it a Vault of Stone instead of one of Wainscot as was be∣fore, and adorned the Pillars that supported it with <HI>Corinthian</HI> Capitals. This Church is not lookt upon at present, as any Curiosity, yet is the Disposition of its parts well enough. The Great Altar is in the middle of the <HI>Croisée;</HI> and so con∣trived, that one may go round it: In the fore∣part of this Altar is a Table of Silver gilt, which is a great Ornament, and is shewed only on Festival Days. It is adorn'd with the Figures
<PB N="91" REF="134"/>
of the Apostles, and a Crucifix in the middle, of an ancient sort of Work, not unhandsom. This was the Gift of <HI>William,</HI> Abbot of this House▪ whose Body was found intire not long ago, tho' he had been buried several Ages. The Quire where the Religious sing is behind, in which their Stalls or Seats are of a very handsom Workmanship. At the Feet of <HI>Childebert</HI>'s Tomb you may read the following Epitaph of Monsieur the Duke of <HI>Verneüil,</HI> natural Son of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, who before he marryed with the Dutchess of <HI>Sally,</HI> was Bishop of <HI>Metz</HI> and Abbot of St <HI>Germains.</HI> The Epitaph was made by the Learned <HI>Dom.

Here lies expecting the Resurrection, <LB/> Which he hoped for with a Faith beyond his Age, <LB/> The Illustrious Prince <LB/> <HI>Lewis Caesar</HI> of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> <LB/> Count of <HI>Vexin,</HI> Son of <HI>Lewis the Great.</HI> <LB/> <LB/> 
Who being quickly accomplished, finish'd a great Age <LB/> in a very short time. He lived X. years, <LB/> VI. months, and XXII days. <LB/> 
He dyed the Tenth of <HI>January,</HI> in the Year <LB/> M. DC. LXXXIII. <LB/> 
He was taken away that he might not be injur'd by <LB/> the iniquity of the times; but that his <LB/> memory might be immortal. <LB/> 
<HI>Lewis the Great</HI> <LB/> Appointed a solemn Anniversary for him, with ten <LB/> private Masses.</Q>
<P>On each side of the great Altar are three Tombs, which belong to certain Kings of the first Race, namely that of <HI>Chilperic,</HI> with this Inscription on the edges in ancient Letters:</P>
<Q LANG="lat">REX CHILPERICUS HOC TEGI∣TUR LAPIDE.</Q>
<Q>Ʋnder this Stone King <HI>Chilperic</HI> lies interr'd.</Q>
<P><PB N="94" REF="136"/>
That of Queen <HI>Fredegonde,</HI> which is composed of a kind of Mosaick, of pieces laid in with Veins of Brass couched in the Stone. This Queen is re∣presented holding in her hand a Scepter with a double Flower de Lis at the end of it, which makes one believe that in those ancient times the Flowers de Lis were in use; the Crown on her Head may further authorise this Opinion. She deceased at <HI>Paris</HI> in the year 601. <HI>Clotaire</HI> se∣cond Son of <HI>Childeric</HI> the Second, and of his Wife <HI>Fredegonde,</HI> with his Wife <HI>Bertrude</HI> are also here interr'd: so likewise are <HI>Childeric</HI> the Second, and his Wife. This King was Son of <HI>Clouis</HI> the Second, who was murder'd in hunting in the Woods of <HI>Bondis,</HI> by a Gentleman of <HI>Liege</HI> called <HI>Bodile,</HI> whom he had caus'd dishonourably to be whipt, not respecting his quality.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> ruin'd this Church, here were many other Monuments of famous persons whose memory now is loft. The Kings of the First Race did affect to be buryed here, in like manner as those of the second and third Races made choice▪ of St. <HI>Denis</HI> for the same purpose. They have lately built here two very handsom Chapels of the same Symmetry, in the two Wings of the Church: they are adorn'd with Composite Pillars of Marble vein'd, with Pedestals of the same, so also the Frise. That on the right hand is dedicated to St. <HI>Margaret,</HI> whose Girdle these Fathers keep here; and Women with Child, who have a very great de∣votion to this Chapel, are usually girded with it. The Tomb belonging to some of the fami∣ly of <HI>Castelan</HI> is over against this Chapel, and is of the design of M. <HI>Girardon.</HI></P>
<P>The other Chapel is dedicated to St. <HI>Casimir,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="136"/>
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> Patron of King <HI>Casimir,</HI> who dyed here in <HI>France,</HI> Abbot of this Abby, and whose heart is under the Monument, which stands on one side of this Chapel. This King is represented kneeling, in white Marble, apparel∣led in his Royal Robes, and offering his Crown and Scepter to God, on a Tomb of black Marble, supported with a great Pedestal; in the fore part of which is placed a Bas-relief in Brass, re∣presenting a victory by him gain'd over the Turks. This Monument is one of the finest that can be seen, and one can hardly meet with the like. A Lay Brother of this House named Brother <HI>Jean Thibaut,</HI> who passes for one of the most able men that are in these Works, did erect it. On each side are represented Captive Turks in Chains, sitting on heaps of Arms, in manner of Trophies. The Epitaph was written by Fa∣ther <HI>Delfau,</HI> one of the Monks of this Abby, and is as follows:</P>

Of the Illustrious Blood of the <HI>Iagellonides,</HI> <LB/> 
And of the <HI>Vasatensian</HI> Family <LB/> 
The last; <LB/> 
Because the greatest <LB/> 
In Learning, Arms and Piety. <LB/> 
He learnt the Languages of many Nations, <LB/> 
That he might the more readily oblige them. <LB/> 
Having fought Seventeen set Battels, <LB/> 
He Conquer'd in all but one, <LB/> 
Always invincible. <LB/> 
<HI>The</HI> Muscovites, Sweedes, Brandeburgers, <LB/> 
Tartars, Germains <LB/> 
He Conquer'd by Arms; <LB/> 
The <HI>Cossacks,</HI> and other Rebels <LB/> 
By Favour and Benefits: <LB/> 
By his Victory, shewing himself their King, <LB/> 
And by his Clemency their Father. <LB/> 
He had his Court in his Camp, <LB/> 
His Palaces <LB/> 
In his Tents, <LB/> 
And his Shows <LB/> 
In his Triumphs. <LB/> 
He had Children in lawful Wedlock, <LB/> 
Of which he was afterwards deprived, <LB/> 
Lest, if he should leave behind him a greater than Himself, <LB/> 
He himself should not be the greatest; <LB/> 
But if a less, his race should degenerate. <LB/> 
His Religion was equal to his Valour, <LB/> 
Nor did he sight less for the next World Than for this. <LB/> 
Hence were Monasteries and Hospitals Built at <HI>Warsaw.</HI> <LB/>

Who made Laws for the People. <LB/> 
Hence was the famous Title of <LB/> 
ORTHODOX, <LB/> 
Given him by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Seventh. <LB/> 
Finally, having out-gone <LB/> 
The highest pitch of Humane Glory, <LB/> 
When he could do nothing more illustrious, <LB/> 
He willingly laid down his Crown <LB/> 
In the Year M. DC. LXVIII. <LB/> 
And then those Tears <LB/> 
Which his Reign had never extorted from any, <LB/> 
Flow'd from the Eyes of all, <LB/> 
Who Bewailed the Departure of their King, <LB/> 
As it were the Death of their Father. <LB/> 
When he had spent the residue of his Life in the Offices of Piety <LB/> 
At length hearing of the loss of <HI>Caminiec,</HI> <LB/> 
That he might not out-live so great a Calamity, <LB/> 
Being wounded with the Love of his Country; <LB/> 
He dyed <LB/> 
The XVII of the Calends of <HI>January,</HI> <LB/> 
M. DC. LXXII. <LB/> 
His Royal Heart he left to the Monks of This Monastery, <LB/> 
Of which he had been Abbot, <LB/> 
<PB N="101" REF="139"/>
As a Pledge of his Love; <LB/> 
Which they lamenting inclosed <LB/>

<P>In one of the Chapels behind the Ouire, you may further observe two Tombs of Marble be∣longing to two of the House of <HI>Duglas,</HI> one of the principal Families in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Having seen these things, there remains no∣thing more of singular note in the Church. On Festival Days the divine Office is here Celebra∣ted with great Pomp and Majesty, and there is scarce any Company of Regulars who per∣form better. The Order of St. <HI>Benet</HI> hath been in the Possession of this House, ever since it was first Founded by King <HI>Childebert.</HI> And the Church, according to the opinion of some Hi∣storians, stands in the same place where was formerly a Temple dedicated to the Goddess <HI>Isis,</HI> whose Statue remain'd here till the last Age; at which time an old Wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n being seen saying her Prayers before it, it was by order of the Superiours removed out of the Church, and broken to pieces.</P>
<P>In the inward parts of this Convent the Re∣fectory is worth seeing, which is great, and one of the fairest of the Kingdom. It hath lights on both sides: The Glass of which is very hand∣some, tho' old. At the end of this Room is a Stair-case that leads up to the great Dortor: which Stair-case is a hardy piece of Building. And you must not neglect to visit the Chapel of our Lady; behind which is something of the same design with the <HI>Holy Chapel</HI> at the <HI>Palais.</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="140"/>
Report says, That both were built by the same Architect, who lies buryed here.</P>
<P>But without tarrying long in viewing thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things, you ought to go to the Library, which takes up all the upper Room of that Arm of the Cloister next the Church. It is, in truth, none of the fullest, but in recompence of that, all the Books are the choicest and of the best Editions that can be met with. In the last Age, when there was not such plenty of Libraries as at present, this here, was esteemed the principal Library of <HI>Paris.</HI> And at this day, if it doth not continue all out of the same reputation for Printed Books, yet for Manuscripts none will dispute the precedency, of which we can no where meet with so great a Quantity nor such Choice ones, unless it be in the King's Library. These Ma∣nuscripts are kept at the further end, in a little Chamber by themselves; which Room is full of them from the top to the bottom. Here are some of all Subjects, but chiefly of Religion; by means of which great Lights, several faults of Printers and ill Copiers have been discover∣ed and amended. In a little Press in the great Library, they preserve several Volumes more choice and rare than the rest; amongst which is one called <HI>The Psalter of St.</HI> Germain; it be∣ing supposed to have been used by that Saint, who lived about the Year 560. in the Reign of <HI>Childebert,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Justinian,</HI> Em∣peror in the East. Formerly this Book was kept in the Sacristy, among the Reliques; but in regard it was so often desired to be seen by curious persons, it was removed hither: It is written in Letters of Gold and Silver, upon a Purple coloured Velom; and contains all the
<PB N="103" REF="140"/>
Psalms of <HI>David.</HI> There is also in the same place a very ancient Missal, which according to all appearance, is more than 900. Years old: Certain Tablets of the Antients, made of small Boards of Cedar, with a kind of Wax or Varnish finely spread over them, upon which they writ with their Stile (or Steel Bodkin); and several other singularities of such sort, which deserve to be considered; above all, one great Volume, full of Attestations of the Belief of several Greek Bishops, touching Transubstantiation: Which Attestations the Learned M. <HI>Arnauld,</HI> with much pains, procured from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> by the means of Monsieur <HI>de Nointel,</HI> Ambassador from <HI>France</HI> to the <HI>Port,</HI> for Authorities against those of the pretended Reformed Religion, who maintained that the Greek Church was of their Opinion.</P>
<P>Having said thus much of the Library, the Reader will not be displeas'd if I give some ac∣count of those Excellent Works, which the Learned Monks of this House have lately pub∣lisht; of which the most useful and most consi∣derable is St. <HI>Augustin</HI>'s Works, which they have interpreted and corrected according to the most antient and authentique Manuscripts in all the Libraries in <HI>Europe,</HI> of which they have had an account. We have already received five great Volumes, to which the publick have given an universal applause, and they are continually employ'd about publishing the rest with the same Purity. One may justly say, That there has not been any thing undertaken in this Age, of greater importance and advantage to Reli∣gion; in regard all the Disputes that of late Years have happen'd among Divines on the sub∣ject
<PB N="104" REF="141"/>
of Grace, have risen from the different interpretation of that Father. The Church is obl ged to these Learned Monks, who deserve no less Glory for their Pains, than they have had Trouble in the undertaking, before they could bring the Work to this Condition. Father <HI>Dom Luc d'Achery,</HI> a Monk of this House, hath pub∣lisht the <HI>Spicilegium,</HI> and hath continued it to the Thirteenth Volume in <HI>Quarto,</HI> in which he hath collected together several antient Pieces, hitherto hid in the Libraries of his Order, and which had been lost in oblivion, without his care in thus shewing them to the light; to these Vo∣lumes he hath added learned Prefaces, which are a great help to the Curious.</P>
<P>But after the incomparable Book, which Fa∣ther <HI>Dom Jean Mabillon</HI> has publisht two Years ago, nothing further can be wisht for; it is Entituled, <HI>De Re Diplomatica,</HI> in Folio, with a great number of Figures of antient Charters, which this Learned Author has deci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er'd after the happiest way that can be; and thereupon he hath made most learned Remarques, to teach us how to know if they be Counterfeits, which will appear an easie thing to him who has read this Book. Those who have perused it can never sufficiently admire the Pains and Patience of the Author, in making such Learned Discoveries as are in it; and there is hardly any Work in which there appears more solid Judgment than in this; which is the cause that of the small number of Authors which we can reckon among the Learned, he is one of those who is most esteem'd and hath the greatest Reputation. We have also from his hand several Volumes of <HI>Analects</HI> (or <HI>Fragments)</HI> in <HI>Octavo,</HI> which he continues daily, with much care.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="141"/>
There are also in this Society, many other Learned Men who are continually employed upon divers subjects, from whose hands we shall have in a little time the Works of St. <HI>Ambrose.</HI> One may say further, to their Commendation, that there is not any Religious House where Idleness is more strictly avoided than in this.</P>
<P>We must know, that this Abby hath been in former times often Ruin'd, at the Incursions of Foreigners, it then standing out of the Town. The <HI>Normans</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> have Pillaged and Burnt it three or four times, and it hath stood out some Sieges like a Fortified Town. It was at that time enclosed about with deep Ditches and strong Walls, which from one space to ano∣ther were defended with round Towers, most of which, of later time, have been pulled down to build the Houses round about it; and there remain but two which are at the Gate, on that side next the <HI>Rile St. Benoist.</HI></P>
<P>In regard it is difficult to observe the course of the Streets in St. <HI>Germains</HI> Quarter, as we have done in other parts of the Town; because things are not here in a Row as elsewhere: We shall therefore speak of the observable places severally, endeavouring, however, as near as we can, to describe them to the Curious in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> course, and thereby to spare their pains as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as may be.</P>

<HEAD>The Palace of <HI>ORLEANS,</HI></HEAD>
<P>OTherwise call'd <HI>The Palace of Luxembourg,</HI> because it stands in the same place where formerly stood a <HI>Hôtel</HI> of that name.</P>
<P>Of all the Houses in <HI>Paris,</HI> and even in the whole Kingdom; there is none more regular, better design'd for Architecture, or more mag∣nificent than this Palace. <HI>Mary de Medicis,</HI> Wi∣dow of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. caused it to be built, and for that purpose made use of the ablest Artist of her time, named <HI>Jacques de Brosse,</HI> the same per∣son who designed the Portal of St. <HI>Gervais,</HI> of which I have already spoken. That great Queen spared no Costs to leave Posterity a Mo∣nument of her magnificence. All Foreign Tra∣vellers do agree, that in all <HI>Italy,</HI> there is no∣thing to be seen, where Art hath been observed with more exactness, and where more Grandeur and Majesty appears, than in this building. It is composed of a great Square Court, at the fur∣ther end of which is the main Body of the Build∣ing, accompanied at the ends with four Pavilli∣ons, and in the middle the <HI>Avant-corps,</HI> which makes a fifth, set off with Pillars. On each side of the foresaid Court are two long Galleries a little lower than the rest of the Building, each supported with 9 Arches, under which one may walk dry round about the Court. The Front of all this Palace is after the manner of an open Gallery, with a kind of Dome in the middle supported with Pillars, under which is the great
<PB N="107" REF="142"/>
Door butting upon the <HI>Ruë de Tournon;</HI> at the upper part of which Street this Palace is situa∣ted, which adds much to the beauty of its <HI>Ave∣nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> At each end of the Galleries, and also of the two Tarrasses, which run along the fore-part of the Court, are two other great Pavillions, which stand in the same Line with the Face of the Build∣ing. The Architecture of this Palace consists of Pilasters, except about the great Portal, and on the Garden side before a little Dome, which serves for a Chapel, where are some Pillars which stand off from the Work. The Orders observed in this Work are the Tus∣can, and the Dorick, with an Attique above; and on the Garden side over the Tuscan and Dorick, is an Ionick, which makes a third Or∣der compleat, with Balustrades round about the top; as also Frontons and Faces, on which are great Statues in cumbent postures, supporting Crowns. This excellent Architecture is still more beautiful, by reason of the <HI>Bossage</HI> that runs all over the Work, no other Ornaments being necessary. All that you see here is ac∣cording to the plain and true Rules of Art, which is the cause that all those who are any thing knowing in Architecture, take more delight in considering this Palace, and observe more beau∣ties in it, than those who regard only the things without knowing the true value. This Palace is at present inhabited by two illustrious Princesses, Daughters of the late Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> only Brother of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII. On the left hand as you come in are the Apartments of <HI>Mademoisell d'Orleans,</HI> and on the right those of Madam the Dutchess of <HI>Guise,</HI> her Sister. In the first men∣tioned are several excellent <HI>Plasons,</HI> and very
<PB N="108" REF="143"/>
rich Furniture; in the last among other things, you ought to see the Gallery painted by the Famous <HI>Rubens</HI> of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> who was invited from <HI>Flanders</HI> on purpose to paint it. These Paint∣ings are great Pictures on the Pannels between the Divisions, in which are represented the prin∣cipal actions of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV his Life, more espe∣cially those in which <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> had any concern. No Man can desire to see any thing more exactly designed or better perform'd: but that which is most to be admired is the excellent Colouring which this famous Master used in his Works, in which thing he surpast all others. Often do the Young Painters come and study in this Gallery, and in regard it is all throughout of his manner, they may easily here learn the Ideas of Excellent <HI>Peinture.</HI> The Garden was formerly very beautiful, and full of little Groves and co∣ver'd Walks; but several hard Winters having killed many of the Trees, it hath been thought necessary to cut up the rest to make room for others, which they have already begun to plant; at the end of the great Walk, before the <HI>Parterre,</HI> they designed to make a Fountain; so much of it as is already made, is of a very good kind of Architecture. It is a kind of <HI>Niche,</HI> adorn'd in the fore-part with four great Tuscan Pillars, charg'd with Congelations, on which are Sea-Gods holding Vases, with a great <HI>Cartouche,</HI> in which are the Armes of <HI>France,</HI> and those of <HI>Me∣dicis</HI> impaled.</P>
<P>There is nothing more, very remarkable, un∣less it be the Balustrade of white Marble in the forepart of the Tarrasses, which inclose the Parterre; but it is not yet finisht. From hence you ought to go and visit</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Hotel de CONDE'.</HEAD>
<P>HEre lives Monsieur <HI>the Prince,</HI> first Prince of the Blood, with all his Illustrious Fami∣ly. The building of this House is not extraor∣dinary. It was formerly the <HI>Hôtel de Reiz,</HI> and being built at divers times by snatches, as conveniency would allow, the Symmetry was not over carefully observed; but as to the Furniture it is difficult to see any elsewhere more magnificent or more numerous. There are Pictures done by all the excellent Masters, extraordinary Tapistries, which did formerly belong to the illustrious House of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> and Jewels fairer than in any House of <HI>Europe.</HI> Here is also a Library very numerous, in which you may meet with some very curious Books and Writings extream rare. But that which you ought most to endeavour to see is the Gar∣den, which in a space of Ground small enough, shews all the beauties and singularities which Art and Nature joyned together can produce. There are here certain Rooms or Arbours, made by <HI>Hollanders,</HI> with abundance of Industry: At the end of each walk stands a small Triumphal Arch of the same work. In Summer this Gar∣den is full of Oranges and Jasmins, which makes the Walk here in the Evening most de∣licious.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ruë Vaugirad,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uns along be∣fore <HI>Luxembourg</HI> House, stands the Little <HI>Hôtel de Bourbon,</HI> otherwise called the Little <HI>Luxem∣bourg,</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="144"/>
which <HI>Cardinal de Richelieu</HI> caused to be beautified for his Niece the Dutchess of <HI>Ai∣guillon,</HI> with great Expence, as one may easily perceive by the Excellent <HI>Plafons,</HI> and more e∣specially that in the great Hall, which cost a great price: Here was in those days very mag∣nificent Furniture, and all sorts of Curiosities extreamly rare; but they have been since di∣spersed into several hands upon the Death of that Dutchess.</P>
<P>Hard by, and on the same side of the way, are the Nuns <HI>du Calvaire,</HI> of Saint <HI>Benet</HI>'s Order▪ here Founded in the Year 1020. by Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medicis.</HI> Their Church and Convent hath nothing of extraordinary, no more than</P>

<HEAD>The Convent of the <HI>Carmes Dechaussez,</HI> or discalced <HI>Carmelite Friers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Monastery was Founded about the beginning of the last Age, by the Libe∣ralities of certain Burgesses of <HI>Paris;</HI> who be∣stowed a small House, Situated in this place, on the Carmelite Friers, who came from <HI>Spain,</HI> and brought into <HI>France</HI> the Reform which St. <HI>Teresa</HI> had made in the Order of Mount <HI>Car∣mel.</HI> In the Year 1613 they began the Foun∣dation; and <HI>Mary de Medicis</HI> laid the first Stone of their Church, as we may perceive by
<PB N="111" REF="144"/>
this Inscription, which was set over the place:</P>
<Q>MARIA MEDICAE A MATER FUNDA∣MENTUM HUJUS ECCLESIAE POSUIT. 1613.</Q>
<Q><HI>Mary de Medicis</HI> the Mother, laid the Foun∣dation of this Church, <HI>1613.</HI></Q>
<P>Chancellor <HI>Seguier</HI> declared himself their Pro∣tector, and became a great Benefactor; among other things he gave them wherewithal to build their great Altar; which is of a very handsome design, adorned with Corinthian Pillars of black Marble, and several Figures representing the principal Saints of this Order. All the Church is of the Tuscan order of building; yet, in truth, it is none of the most regular. In the middle there is a Dome, painted in the top by a Chanon of the Church of <HI>Leige,</HI> named <HI>Bertolet,</HI> who was no bad Painter, as one may well judge by this Work; which represents the As∣sumption of <HI>Elias,</HI> in a Chariot of Fire, and his Mantle falling on his Disciple <HI>Elisha,</HI> who receives it with open Arms.</P>
<P>There are in this Church two Chapels that deserve a particular consideration. The first of which is on the left hand, under the Dome, and Dedicated to the Holy Virgin; in which there is a Statue of white Marble, the finest that can be seen: It was made at <HI>Rome,</HI> by a Disciple of the Famous Cavalier <HI>Bernin,</HI> and cost a great expence to bring it from thence. It is
<PB N="112" REF="145"/>
not easie ever to meet with a better figure than this. It represents the Holy Virgin sitting and holding her Infant on her Knee, who smiles and extends his little Arms to embrace her. All that one can wish to see in a compleat and finisht Statue, is to be found in this; and all Men ought to consider it as the best Piece in the Kingdom. The Niche in which it stands over the Altar is of the Design of Cavalier <HI>Bernin,</HI> it is adorn'd with four Corinthian Pillars of a vein'd Marble. The other Chapel is over against this, and dedicated to St. <HI>Teresa,</HI> as appears by the Picture in the middle. This Chapel is adorn'd with Marble Pillars, of a composite Order, but very singular, with Festons on the Freese; but this is the Architects own fancy, and there are but few examples of such Work. How∣ever the whole is very handsom and pleasing to the view. The Balustrades of these two Al∣tars, and that also of the great Altar which stands between 'em, are of a choice sort of Marble. The rest of the Church hath nothing at all extraordinary, unless it be the white painting, with which it is all over painted, which has a Gloss, and shines like Marble. It is said that these Fathers have a Secret to make it thus, and that they are not willing to discover the mystery to any.</P>
<P>In the inner part of the House there is no∣thing remarkable but the Library, which tho' it be but little, and the number of Books very small, yet it ought to be seen if it were only for the delicate prospect which it hath over the Neigh∣bouring Fields. These Fathers have the hand∣somest Gardens and the best kept in all <HI>Paris,</HI> which is not to their small advantage, for in re∣gard
<PB N="113" REF="145"/>
they eat no Flesh, they have from their own Gardens sufficient of Roots and Pulse, and the like, whereon to subsist without buying.</P>
<P>In a Street at the end of this, which is call'd the <HI>Ruë du Regard,</HI> is a small House lately built, whose prospects are all upon the Neighbour∣ing Gardens, and is extream neat and hand∣som.</P>
<P>The Fortress where the Academists of M. <HI>Ber∣nardy</HI> exercise is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar off. It stands near the Walls of the <HI>Palais d'Orleans,</HI> inclosed in a little piece of Ground, and serves for this use only. Here they make their attaques as regular, as if at the taking of a place of the greatest impor∣tance.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ruë Cassette</HI> near the <HI>Carmes</HI> of which I have been speaking, is, <HI>The Monastery of the Nuns of the Holy Sacrament,</HI> who owe their Foundation to the late Dutchess of <HI>Orleans,</HI> Second Wife of Monsieur <HI>Gaston</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV. and Brother of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII. This Illustrious Princess who was of a most exemplary Piety; was their great Benefactress, and gave them wherewithal to build their Church▪ and their great Altar▪ which last is of a very handsom Wainscot work, Marble painted and the Ornaments gilt, all which shows very handsomly, but this is all that is here to be seen▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very <HI>Thursday</HI> they sing here a Salutation of the Holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acrament, at which a great number of Devout Persons assist, and offer up their P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayers.</P>

<P>THE Church of these Fathers is but small, but in recompence of that, it is one of the handsomest and best designed for Architecture in <HI>Paris.</HI> It is said that one of the Fathers of this Society named Father <HI>Marlange,</HI> drew the design, and having well observed the faults of that in the <HI>Ruë St. Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onie,</HI> of Father <HI>de Rant</HI>'s designing, he alter'd many things. This Fa∣ther being consulted with about the work of this Church, would not meddle till the General had given him permission to do what he thought proper, without being obliged to observe the orders of any one whatsoever of the Society. After this he undertook the building, which is not so big as the other, but it infinitely sur∣passes it in Regularity. The Portal is of Pila∣sters of the Dorick Order, and over them the Ionick Order. The inside is also of Dorick Pi∣lasters supporting a Cornish, between the <HI>Trig∣lifes,</HI> of which are several Ornaments repre∣senting the Instruments of our Lord's Passion. The great Altar is but very plain of Jovners Work, adorn'd with two Corinthian Pillars. But that which sets off this Altar infinitely be∣yond the fairest of the Kingdom, is the great Picture which you see there of the famous <HI>Poussin,</HI> one of the best which that able Master ever did. All the Curious esteem this piece extreamly, and look upon it as the best in <HI>France</HI> for ex∣actness of design: Notwithstanding the objection
<PB N="115" REF="146"/>
of some Criticks, who say the Ear of St. <HI>Francis Xavier,</HI> who is here represented on his Knees, working a Miracle, is bigger than it ought to be.</P>
<P>After you have seen the Church, you ought to ask to see the Chapel of the Congregation, which lies on the left Hand of the Door, as you come in. It is adorn'd with a gilt Wainscot, and Pictures from space to space; and in the Ceeling a Plafon well Painted. On the Festivals the Altar is adorned with a rich Furniture of Silver, which the Members of this Society have given.</P>
<P>The whole House is very Commodious, tho' it be of no great extent, by reason it is all enclosed by four Streets on every side. The following Inscription is cut on the first Stone of the Church, which was laid by the late Duke of <HI>Verneüil.</HI></P>

about 25. or 30. Years ago, they begun the new Edifice which we see at present, an under∣taking so large, and the expence so great, that the Quire is hardly yet finished, with all the Liberalities the Parishioners can raise. So much as is done is the whole Quire, which is of a no∣ble design. The inside is supported with high Arches, and between Arch and Arch Corinthian Pilasters, over which a Cornish that supports the Vault, which is perfectly well made and very solid, tho' very high. Round about between the Quire and the Chapels is a long Corridor, which is capable of holding a great number of People, who may from thence behold all that is done at the great Altar, where divine Offices are performed with great edification, especially on the Festival days.</P>
<P>At one of the Pilasters standing between two Chapels, you may read the Epitaph of the famous Monsieur <HI>de Marolles,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Ville∣loin,</HI> the greatest Translater into our Language we ever had, and who enriched it with abun∣dance of Authors which were never before in <HI>French.</HI> Mons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eur the Abbot <HI>de la Chambre,</HI> his intimate Friend and Executor of his Will, caused it to be set up in this place to his Memo∣ry.

<P>In the rest of this Church there is nothing ex∣traordinary, unless it be a little Stair-case of one direct Line, winding like a Snail shell from the bottom to the top. It is all of Free stone and

<P>Further on is the <HI>Abbaïe aux Bois,</HI> of the <HI>Ci∣stercian</HI> Order. They were removed hither from <HI>Picardy</HI> about Sixty years since. Near this is</P>
<P>The Hospital for Distracted people, call'd <HI>Les Petites-Maisons,</HI> here you may see a Crucifix of great esteem, and done by an excellent Ma∣ster.</P>
<P>In the same Street also is the Hospital call'd <HI>Les Incurables,</HI> the lower Rooms of which Hospi∣tal are curiously vaulted, and the Diseased peo∣ple lookt after very carefully. The Church hath nothing in it extraordinary. It is con∣trived in the middle of the Apartments, equal∣ly distant from the Men and Women.

<P>From the <HI>Ruë de Seve</HI> you pass into the <HI>Ruë de Grenelle,</HI> which begins at the <HI>Carrefour</HI> or open place of the <HI>Red Cross,</HI> near the <HI>Premontrez.</HI> The first thing you take notice of in this Street is the <HI>Hôtel d'Auvergne,</HI> in which dwells Monsi∣eur the Count <HI>d'Auvergne▪</HI> Colonel General of the Light Horse of <HI>France,</HI> Brother of the Duke of <HI>Boüillon,</HI> and Nephew of the famous Monsieur <HI>de Turenne.</HI> This <HI>Hôtel</HI> is not extraordinary well built, but the Garden is large and very pleasant. Further on at the Corner of the <HI>Ruë</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="149"/>
<HI>du Bacq.</HI> stands a large House, and very conve∣nient habitation, in which the Spanish Embassador used to live.</P>
<P>Near this place dwells a Sculptor, at whose House you may see several Bas-reliefs, not ill designed, they are of the manner of one named <HI>Vanobstal,</HI> originally of <HI>Bruxelles,</HI> who was the first that brought the gust of Bas-reliefs into <HI>France,</HI> out of <HI>Italy.</HI> There are some things of his at <HI>Versailles,</HI> which are very much esteem'd, more especially those over the Doors of the Grotto.</P>
<P>Beyond this is the <HI>Hôtel de Navailles,</HI> a well built House; it consists of one great square Pa∣villion, high raised, and overlooking all the ad∣jacent Gardens, which renders the aboad very pleasant.

<P>The House of the Sieur <HI>Roland,</HI> one of the most knowing and Curious Men of all <HI>Paris</HI> in Buildings. This House, as also the Gardens, which have all the delights one can desire, are worth seeing. Here are Fountains, Arbours, Perspectives, and Parterres of the best sort. The Apartments are neatly furnish'd, and all things handsom, especially the Stair-case, which is of a singular design, and well approved by the Curious. At the end of this Street, in the ad∣joyning Fields, you discover</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Hotel Royal, <HI>called</HI> Les Inva∣lides.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the King's Buildings, there is not any in which there appears more of mag∣nificence and piety together than in this, since all that prodigious expence which hath been be∣stow'd on this Work is solely intended for the maintenance of crippled Souldiers; who being disabled to serve any longer in the Army, would be forced to lead a Languishing and Miserable life, were it not for the support which they find in this House, where they are supply'd with all things, and may end the course of their Lives in the Exercise of Christian Piety. But that which is not a little surprising is, that all this vast Edifice was compleated, as it now is, in less than Eight Years, and in the height of the War.</P>
<P>About the Year 16**. they began to lay the first Foundations of this curious Structure, which at present makes one of the Chief Orna∣ments of <HI>Paris.</HI> It is exactly square, and con∣tains in its Circumference five Courts of the same Figure, one great one in the middle, and two lesser on each side, all which are compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t about with Apartments, in which the Souldiers have their several Lodgings. That in the mid∣dle is much greater than the rest, and the build∣ings about it are of a handsom Symmetry. They are composed of two rows of Arches, one above the other, which makes so many Corridors or
<PB N="123" REF="150"/>
Galleries, by means of which you may walk dry round the Court. The top of the Buildings are adorn'd with Ornaments, representing Tro∣phies of Armes, and such like things, which make a very handsom Show. At the end of the Court, just opposite to the principal Entry, is the Por∣tal of the Church, composed of two ranks of Pillars, the first or lowermost of the Compo∣site order, and the second of the Corinthian. Here you may enter into that part of the Church which is appointed for those of the House: as for those who come from abroad they are building another part already somewhat advan∣ced, and this will be incomparably more mag∣nificent. The Model in little may be seen in a Pavillion raised on purpose; if it be performed according to this Model, nothing can be seen more glorious or of a greater design. It will be a Dome very high raised, under which the great Altar is to be placed, which will be enricht with all the most beautiful Ornaments, which the most studied Architecture can produce. The Cove∣ring is to be gilt like that at <HI>Val de Grace,</HI> but they intend this to be more regular, and better perform'd, both for the disposition and the Or∣naments. You ought to see the Infirmaries, which are divided from the rest of the House, but not far off. The Beds are neat, and the Sick receive there all the help and assistance that is necessary, they are served by the <HI>Sisters of the Charity of St. Lazar</HI>'s, who make it their parti∣cular profession to wait upon the Sick in all parts of the Town, as well as in this House. But that which Strangers ought to observe more especi∣ally, are the four great Refectories which are on each side of the middle Court, where you will
<PB N="124" REF="151"/>
see painted in <HI>Fresquo,</HI> the principal Sieges and Battels which <HI>France</HI> has gain'd against her Ene∣mies. Few Pictures are more exactly design'd, or can shew more variety and life than these; the sight of which things cannot choose but give a very great pleasure, to those who were con∣cern'd in the Actions represented. There is in this House a certain Souldier works in Tapistry, whom you ought not to forget to visit. As you go out you may observe the Front of the build∣ing, with the great Court before it, compast about with a dry Ditch, and a Wall of Freestone, from which you have a delicate Prospect. They keep Guard at the Gates here in the same man∣ner as in a Citadel, thereby to preserve the Souldiers in Health, and free from Idleness. The Discipline which they observe in this House is admirably exact; and the Fathers of the Mis∣sion, who have the Care and Conduct of the place, acquit themselves very worthily.</P>
<P>All that remains of Note in this Quarter, after you have seen the <HI>Invalids</HI> is</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel,</HI> in which dwells Monsieur <HI>the Com∣mandeur de Haute-Feüille,</HI> Embassador from <HI>Mal∣ta,</HI> in a Street behind the <HI>Peutes-Maisons.</HI> Here you may see very Curious Pictures, with many other great Rarities, which can hardly be met with elsewhere.</P>
<P>Near this, in the <HI>Rüe du Bac,</HI> is the <HI>Seminary of the Foreign-Missions,</HI> where of late they have built a Church, the Roof whereof is very sur∣prizing, it is indeed but low, because they design to raise a second Church upon this. It is the Invention of the Sieur <HI>du Buisson,</HI> an able Ar∣chitect. From this House are sent Missionaries into the <HI>Indies</HI> to Preach the Gospel there to Infi∣dels,
<PB N="125" REF="151"/>
in which office they acquit themselves with a very great Zeal, and their endeavours are blest with marvellous Success, as we perceive by the Relations of Monsieur the Bishop of <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> and all the other Travellers that come from those parts, who relate most surprizing things.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Rüe St. Dominique</HI> is the <HI>Noviciat of the Reformed Jacobins,</HI> whose Church is now build∣ing, and will be none of the least handsom of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Sieur <HI>Bulet,</HI> who is the City Ar∣chitect, hath undertaken the building of this Church, as also of the Houses round about; which bring these Fathers a considerable Reve∣nue, and are well built. On the other side of the way is</P>
<P>The <HI>Hôtel de Luines,</HI> heretofore call'd the <HI>Hô∣tel de Chevreuse,</HI> whose name has been changed since the death of the Dutchess of <HI>Chevreuse,</HI> on whose account it was first built. The Apartments are very handsom and convenient, and the Sieur <HI>le Muet</HI> made the design.</P>
<P>In the same <HI>Rüe Saint Dominique,</HI> you may perceive a new House built by order of the <HI>Hôtel-Dieu,</HI> whose Porch is very pretty, it stands at the further part of the Court, and is supported by Dorick Pillars, which shew curiously as you enter. The whole House is of the design of the Sieur <HI>le Duc.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Petite Rüe Guillaume,</HI> stands a large House in which dwells Monsieur <HI>Talon,</HI> Advocat General; the Structure is extream handsom, the Apartments very pleasant, having all their prospects upon the adjoining Gardens, the Court is great, and, in fine, it appears that there were no costs spared in the building; but that which gives it the best Ornament is the
<PB N="126" REF="152"/>
excellent Library in it, composed of the rarest and scarcest things, both for Manuscripts and Printed Books.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Hospital call'd <HI>La Charite</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Hospital is situated in the outermost part of the Town, in which the Curious must not expect to find any pleasing Sights; but Poor Sick People, who are served very neatly by the Brothers of the Order of St. <HI>John of God,</HI> who mind no other business but to assist and comfort these poor People, and to procure for them freely all such things as they need. Here are three or four great Rooms full of Beds on each side. In their Church you may see the Tomb of <HI>P. Bernard,</HI> who dyed in the Reputation of Sanctity, his Statue here represents him to the Life, kneeling.</P>
<P>Near the Door of this Church, on that side next the <HI>Rüe Tarane,</HI> is a new built Fountain of a very handsom design, on which these Verses of Monsieur <HI>Santeüil</HI> are graven:</P>
<Q LANG="lat">QUEM PIET AS APERIT MISERO∣RUM IN COMMODA FONTEM, <LB/>

<L>This Fountain for the needy built, doth shew,</L>
<L>Your Charity should still like Water flow,</L>

<P>In the <HI>Rüe des Saints Peres,</HI> adjoining is the <HI>Hôtel de Brissac,</HI> whose building is very regular: Here is a Gallery with several Apartments very delightsom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hotel de S. Simon</HI> is in the same Street. This is very well placed, having the great Street call'd the <HI>Rüe Tarane</HI> over against it, which gives it an advantagious View. It was built by <HI>M. Salvois,</HI> who made use of the Sieur <HI>Gittar</HI>'s de∣signs.</P>
<P>The House where now dwells the Princess of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> is not far from hence. The Garden behind which hath a delicate air.</P>
<P>Almost over against the last mention'd House, stands another, which tho' it makes outwardly no great show; yet at the further part of the Court there you may see a piece of Perspective very well Painted, wherein at a distance you dis∣cover a Triumphal Arch <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> l'antique,</HI> which shows well afar off.</P>

<P><LABEL>The Cabinet of Monsieur <HI>Blondel.</HI></LABEL>Before we speak any thing of the Rarities in this rich Cabinet, it is convenient to say some∣what of those excellent Works which Monsieur <HI>Blondel</HI> hath written. This learned person is so well known among all Scholars, that it would be difficult to say any thing in his commendation which is not known already. It is sufficient to give the Reader an Idea of his merit and pro∣found Knowledge, to say only that the King made choice of him to teach the Mathematicks to Monseigneur the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> and appointed him Director of the Royal Academy of Archi∣tecture, establish'd in the <HI>Palais Brion,</HI> and com∣posed as all men know of the ablest Men of the

<P>Monsieur <HI>Perault</HI> of this Academy, hath pub∣lish'd a Learned Translation of <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> enrich∣ed with a great number of Figures; and but a while ago another Book of Architecture Entitu∣led, <HI>L'Ordonnance des cinq especes de Colonnes des Anciens,</HI> highly esteemed by the Curious.</P>
<P>But to return to Monsieur <HI>Blondel,</HI> we are ob∣liged to him for the new Plan of <HI>Paris,</HI> it being performed by his directions, according to the ex∣press Order which the King gave to the <HI>Bur∣gesses,</HI> not to suffer any one to undertake this Work but him, since it is well known, none could perform it so well as himself. It is to be seen at his House only, and contains 12 Sheets. The new Embellishments, as also the Town Gates lately raised, and all designed by him, are in∣graved in the Edges. The same Author hath
<PB N="130" REF="154"/>
also publish'd <HI>A Treatise of Architecture</HI> in three Volumes, which were read as Lectures in the Academy, the Preface before which is very elo∣quent and full of Instruction: <HI>A Treatise of Geo∣metry Speculative and Practical,</HI> in two Volumes in Quarto; and another <HI>Of Arithmetick,</HI> in the same manner as he taught them to Monseigneur the <HI>Dauphin:</HI> Also <HI>The manner of Fortifying Places,</HI> wherein are ingraved very curious Plans of the best Fortifications that are in the World: <HI>The Comparison of Pindar and Horace,</HI> Dedicated to M. <HI>le Premier,</HI> President <HI>de Lamoignon: The Soluti∣on of the four principal Problemes of Architecture,</HI> in Folio: <HI>Of the Royal Impression in the Louvre,</HI> adorn'd with Figures: <HI>The Art of casting Bombes,</HI> in Quarto; and lastly, another which came forth but the be∣ginning of the last year, Entituled, <HI>The History of the Roman Kalendar,</HI> in which you may see not only all the several Manners which the antients made use of to count their Time, but also all that has past in reducing the Computation of time to the form that is now used, and the difficulties which have been met with before it was brought to the present regulation. This Book is so full of cu∣rious Learning, that there is hardly any sort of People to whom it is not profitable: He hath also given us hopes of several other Books, which may be publish'd in time, they being ready for the Press; and they are these:</P>
<P>Galileus promotus de resistentia solidorum.</P>
<P>Geometrick Elements of Medieties.</P>
<P>A Treatise of Algebra.</P>
<P>A Treatise of the Motion of Celestial Bodies.</P>

<P>A Second Edition of <HI>Francis Savot</HI>'s <HI>French</HI> Ar∣chitecture, augmented with a great number of Notes.</P>
<P>But Books are not the only things that have made M. <HI>Blondel</HI> famous, the great Exploits which he hath perform'd in the Wars as well by Sea as Land: The Negotiations in which he has been employed with Foreign Princes; and in fine, the long Voyages which he has performed in the four parts of the World, wherein he has seen all that is observable, and thereby attained so perfect a Knowledge in all things, that the reputation of his Experience and Abilities hath justly acquired him the quality of a Counsellor of State.</P>
<P>He hath here one of the most curious Cabinets that is at present in <HI>Paris,</HI> in which are several Rarities of all the best and choicest kinds, and no less choicely preserved. Among other things, he hath here several original Pictures of <HI>Palma,</HI> of <HI>Paul Veronese,</HI> of <HI>Guido,</HI> and of the famous <HI>Poussin,</HI> several Land-skips of <HI>Paul Bril,</HI> of <HI>Cor∣neille,</HI> of <HI>Breugle,</HI> of <HI>Fouquiere,</HI> of <HI>Lucas,</HI> and of divers others. Pieces of Fruit of <HI>Labrador,</HI> of <HI>Sommes;</HI> and of Flowers of <HI>Picard,</HI> of <HI>Mariv Del∣siori,</HI> and of others: Also a great number of Limnings and Miniatures after the best Pain∣ters; as <HI>Raphaël, Carache,</HI> and <HI>Poussin.</HI> Here are
<PB N="132" REF="155"/>
also 200. Leaves of the same Work representing Birds, besides those of Animals, which they made at <HI>Limoges</HI> in the last Age upon Gold and Silver; the secret of which work is at present lost, and which things are now sold at excessive Rates. Here are some Pictures of inlaid Wood, whose Colours are as beautiful as if they had been wrought with a Pencil.</P>
<P>But that which is infinitely more curious than all the rest, is the great number of Agates, a∣mong which there are 40 greater than the rest, most of them are antique, and represent Deities, Emperors Heads, and Sacrifices, and are admi∣rably well cut: Those which are modern are graved by <HI>Coldoré,</HI> a famous Lapidary, and by several others as great Artists; with these a small Chain of six great grains of Agate also.</P>
<P>Still these are not the most precious things of this Cabinet, there are some things of greater esteem, as 12 Bracelets composed of Agates, Cornelians, Onyx, Jasper, and of prime Eme∣ralds adorn'd with Gold, which altogether make 150. antique Gravings, representing <HI>Roman</HI> Dei∣ties, and all the Emperors from <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> to <HI>Labienus Posthumus,</HI> with 36. Empresses; among the Emperors the Heads of <HI>Pescenius Niger,</HI> and the 2 <HI>Africans</HI> are very curiously cut in Onyx. This Suit is lookt upon as one of the most singular Rarities that is at present, and it is without dis∣pute the only thing of this kind in the whole World. For we never yet knew of any Man who collected a Suit of antique graved Stones as has been usually done of Medals; and this here hath been the Work of four of the most famous <HI>Vertuosi</HI> that ever were in <HI>France,</HI> who have above 50 Years used their endeavours to
<PB N="133" REF="155"/>
render this Collection compleat as it now is. Be∣sides these there are four other Agates graved hollow representing the History of the <HI>Triumvi∣rate,</HI> the Heads of <HI>Caesar, Mark Anthony,</HI> and <HI>Lepidus,</HI> are upon the three principal, and that of <HI>Cleopatra</HI> on the other. On a green Oriental Jasper of an Oval Figure which is placed in the middle, is represented a Pillar, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot of which a Souldier holds up the point of his Dag∣ger: This Pillar was call'd by the Antients <HI>Co∣lumna execrata,</HI> in regard the Senate and M. <HI>Anthony</HI> caused it to be raised to the me∣mory of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> and that all the Souldiers might come before this Pillar, and here swear to Revenge the death of that great Emperor. This Pillar was taken down by <HI>Dolabella.</HI> The Inscription graven about this curious Agate ex∣plains the History, and is this,
<Q>MART VL. AUX. D. JUL. LACRI.</Q>
Which signifies, <HI>Marti, ultori, auxiliatori, Di∣vo Julio Lacrimae.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>Mars,</HI> the Revenger, the Helper, to <HI>Divus Julius</HI> Tears.</P>
<P>Upon this Pillar stands an Urn, and the <HI>Sidus Julium</HI> on one side, which, as Historians say, ap∣pear'd after the Death of <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>The other things are several Rings of Gold, adorn'd with precious Stones, as Rubies, Eme∣ralds, and Oriential Topazes, a great Diamond
<PB N="134" REF="156"/>
in manner of a Button, very perfect; another Yellowish but very lively; an Aigue of the Sea, oriental; a great Violet-colour Ruby of 28. grains; an Opal of the East in the form of a little Lion; three great Boxes full of Stones graved of the antique, some hollow'd, and some in relief; several rare Shells of strange fashions; a Suit of one hundred Imperial Medals of Silver, and one hundred others of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman,</HI> the best chosen of <HI>Padoüan.</HI></P>
<P>As there want no Rarities in this rich Cabi∣net, you may see here also several <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Armes, as Cimeters, Daggers, and Knives of Damask't Steel, whose hilts and handles are of Stone inlaid with Gold, and enricht with Jewels. There are also Japan Works, and the best sort of Porcelains; curious Books; some pie∣ces of Ivory wrought in Sculpture, with a good quantity of Rosary-Beads of Agate; and a thou∣sand other things of such sort, which would re∣quire a long description, if we should mention all in particular.</P>
<P>All that you see in this Cabinet is of unusual Beauty, the Collection having been made by one who was perfectly knowing in these matters, and who spared no Costs to attain the thing which pleased him. On this account you will find in this House sufficient to satisfie any Mans Curio∣sity. And the Civility with which they are shewn gives no less satisfaction to the Beholders, than the Rarities themselves occasion Admira∣tion.</P>
<P>Beyond this on the same side of the way in the <HI>Rüe de l'Ʋniversité,</HI> stands the <HI>Hôtel Tambon∣neau,</HI> perfectly well built, and designed by the Sieur <HI>le Veau.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="156"/>
The rest of this Street, deserves not much pains to examine it, tho' there be several good Capacious Houses in it, among others that of Monsieur the <HI>Grand Provost.</HI></P>
<P>Also the Sieur <HI>Logeois</HI> otherwise call'd the Mar∣quess of <HI>Imbercour,</HI> one of the Farmers General of the five great Farms, hath built here a great and convenient House, which will cost him a∣bove 24000. Crowns before it be quite fi∣nish'd.</P>
<P>You must not neglect to visit M. <HI>Pelitot,</HI> over against the <HI>Hôtel Tambonneau;</HI> he is one of the ablest Enamellers in <HI>Europe,</HI> and makes those curious Pictures in Enamel, which are set about with Diamonds, and presented to Embassadors; and sometimes they are set in Bracelets, being commonly no bigger than a Shilling, and often much less: One may confidently affirm that no Man did ever better understand this Art, nor has made his Pictures more like.</P>
<P>At the end of this Street in a House near the <HI>Hôtel de les Mousquetairs,</HI> you may see a Burning Glass which does wondrous things when exposed to the Sun, so far as to dissolve the hardest and the most incombustible Bodies that are. It is greater than any we have yet seen; and the Foot on which it stands is no less sin∣gular, it being also of Steel, and wrought with much Art and Patience.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Little AUGUSTINS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Convent of these Fathers is in the Street which bears their Name, leads from the <HI>Rüe Columbier</HI> to the Edge of the <HI>Seine.</HI> Their House hath nothing extraordi∣nary no more than their Church. The great Altar is of Joyners Work, well enough wrought, Marble Painted, and adorn'd with Statues of great esteem, especially that of the Dying Fi∣gure. They are made, Clay baked, by one call'd <HI>Biardeau</HI> of <HI>Anjou,</HI> and so are all the rest, which are of a very good manner. M. <HI>Varin</HI> esteem'd the Head of this dying Figure worth its weight in Gold. <HI>Margaret</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> Wife of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and Sister of <HI>Henry</HI> III. was one of their principal Benefactors, and by her Testament left them part of her Plate, which they use in adorning their Altar with that rich Furniture, which they expose on Festival Days. This Queen built entirely of her own Cost the Cha∣pel on the right hand of the great Altar, which is in manner of a Dome, and the first which has been raised at <HI>Paris</HI> of this sort. The follow∣ing Inscription is there ingraved on black Mar∣ble.</P>

She hath named this Monastery from the Holy Trinity, and this Cha∣pel the Chapel of Praises, and she hath here placed
<PB N="138" REF="158"/>
the barefooted Fathers of Saint <HI>Augustine</HI>'s Order.</Q>
<P>One may perceive by this Inscription that these Fathers were formerly more austere than they are at present, in regard they were then <HI>Dé∣cháussez</HI> or barefooted. That Queen built this Monastery in favour of her Confessor who was of this Order; his name was <HI>Francis Amet,</HI> origina∣ry of the Town of <HI>Montargis.</HI> You ought to see their Library, which is very neat. Among these Fathers is Father <HI>Lubin,</HI> who is esteem'd one of the most skilful Geographers that we have. This is he who Translated the Relation of <HI>Lapland,</HI> which is sold at the Widow <HI>Varenne</HI>'s at the <HI>Palais.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Ruë de Seine,</HI> behind the Colledge of the four Nations, is the <HI>Hôtel de la Roche-foucault,</HI> which was formerly known by the name of <HI>Hô∣tel de Liancourt,</HI> whose building is very regular, and of a beautiful Ordinance. Here were for∣merly very excellent Pictures, but they have been dispersed since the Death of the Duke of <HI>Liancourt</HI> who made the Collection.</P>
<P>Parallel to this Street lies the <HI>Ruë Mazarin,</HI> so call'd, since the building of the Colledge of the four Nations which takes up part of the Street, of which Colledge Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> was the Founder. In the middle of this Street is the Theater of <HI>French Comedies</HI> over against the end of the <HI>Rüe Guenegaud;</HI> this is the only place where at present they act <HI>French</HI> Plays. Former∣ly there were three places in <HI>Paris,</HI> where you had such Spectacles, at the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> at the <HI>Marais du Temple,</HI> and at the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne;</HI> but since the Invention of <HI>Opera's,</HI> these things
<PB N="139" REF="158"/>
have been changed, and these here are the only Company of <HI>French</HI> Comedians that remain at present. They often Act here new Pieces that are very pleasant, but are not of equal Beauty with those of M. <HI>Corneille,</HI> nor of M. <HI>Racine</HI> for serious Matters, no more than they are equal to those of the famous <HI>Moliere</HI> for Comick. All Strangers agree however that the <HI>French</HI> Scene is the handsomest and most magnificent of <HI>Europe,</HI> as well for the decoration of the Thea∣ter, as for the Beauty of the Pieces there repre∣sented; the Comedians moreover spare no Costs to satisfie the Spectators in the richness of their habits.

M. <HI>de Salo,</HI> Counsellor in the Parliament, was the first who began this Journal in the Year 1665. and gave the Idea to Strangers, who found the invention so profitable and so pleasant, that they have imitated the same thing in divers parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> M. the Abbot <HI>Gallois</HI> continued the Journal for some years after, from 1666. to 1674. at which time M. the Abbot <HI>de la Roque</HI> undertook the Work, in which he hath always labour'd since then, with such success as has ac∣quired him a very great Reputation in the

<P>THE House of these Fathers is of no greater Antiquity than that of the other <HI>Mendi∣cants,</HI> of which I have already spoken. Histo∣rians say, that they came to <HI>Paris</HI> about the Year 1270. and that they were then call'd the <HI>Hermites</HI> of St. <HI>Augustine.</HI> Their first Habitation was near the Gate of <HI>Mont-martre,</HI> in the Street call'd <HI>Rüe des Vieux Augustines,</HI> which still keeps that name, and while they dwelt in that Quarter they made use of the Church of St. <HI>Mary Aegyptian,</HI> which is still remaining. They changed their abode some years after, and came into the <HI>Rüe des Bernardins,</HI> where there is at present St <HI>Nicho∣las du Chardonnet:</HI> but finding that place no more Commodious than the former, they shifted once again▪ and came at last to this place, intending to associate with the Penitents called <HI>Sachets,</HI> who were apparel'd in a kind of Sackcloth, and were placed by St. <HI>Lewis</HI> on the Bank of the <HI>Seine,</HI> in the same place where the Convent stands at this day. This habitation the <HI>Sachets</HI> left en∣tirely to them, and became themselves dispersed

into divers places. The Church belonging to these Father; was not built till the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, called the <HI>Wise,</HI> as one may observe from the Inscription placed at the Foot of his Sta∣tue, placed at the entrance of the great Door on the Right Hand.</P>

<P>The Church was dedicated by <HI>William Chartier,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> in the year 1453. assisted by a great number of Prelates, who performed this Ce∣remony with much Solemnity. The Great Altar is a modern Work; it is but two years since it was finisht. M. <HI>le Brun</HI> made the Design, which is not much different from that of St. <HI>Severin:</HI> you may observe that the Joyners Work of the Quire, is of the best sort in <HI>Paris,</HI> as is also the Tribune between the Quire and the Nave adorn'd with black Marble Pillars of the Corinthian Or∣der. On each side of the Door under this Tri∣bune, are two Chapels, one dedicated to the Holy
<PB N="142" REF="160"/>
Virgin, and the other to St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> of <HI>Tolentin.</HI> The Pulpit is also adorn'd with certain Carvings gilt, and the Bas-reliefs which are round about, are carefully preserved, they being wrought by <HI>Germain Pilon,</HI> yet these Fathers have been not long since perswaded to gild them.</P>
<P>In this Church are several Tombs of illustri∣ous Persons, among which <HI>Philip de Comines</HI> is the most famous; he lived under <HI>Lewis</HI> the Eleventh, and was his principal Secretary. The Memoires which he hath left us are so excellent and so profitable, that they have been translated into Latin, with Commentaries and Notes upon them: And M. <HI>Godefroy,</HI> Historiographer of <HI>France,</HI> hath printed a <HI>French</HI> Edition of them at the <HI>Louvre,</HI> according to the Original, in the Language of the time, which he hath illustra∣ted with many curious Remarks. That learned Man is buried with his Wife in a little low Cha∣pel behind the Altar belonging to the Knights of the Holy Ghost, and one cannot see his Tomb unless the Sacristan open the Door of the place in which it is, it not appearing outwards. You must not forget to observe the great Picture in this Chapel, representing the Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Holy Virgin, and the Apostles; it is the Work of—a Famous Painter. There is another Picture on the side of the same bigness, representing <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth in his Ceremonial Robes giving the Collar of the Holy Ghost to a Lord, assisted with the principal Officers of the Order, in their pro∣per Habits also.

Who, being one of the Richest and most Magnifi∣cent persons of his time, spared no Costs to adorn it without and within, and raised also several Houses in the Street behind the Walls of the Garden, which Street is call'd after his name to this day. The Entrance into this <HI>Hôtel</HI> appears great, and the inside is very sutable. You ought to endeavour to see the Chapel which is really very handsom, adorn'd with Corinthian Pillars, and other Ornaments of a very good gust. It is the Work of <HI>Mansard,</HI> as is also the great Stair-case which is highly esteem'd. The Garden is very pleasant, planted with an Ally of Trees, and has a great Parterre. The Apart∣ments have their several Prospects, which ren∣ders them very pleasant in Summer. The late Princess of <HI>Conti,</HI> one of the Wisest and most Virtuous Ladies of this Age, changed away to M. <HI>de Guenegaud</HI> for this House, her fair House of <HI>Bouchet,</HI> together with the old <HI>Hôtel de Conti,</HI> where lives at present Monsieur the Duke of <HI>Crequi.</HI> In one Corner of this <HI>Hôtel</HI> stands a great House, which makes no distinct appearance outwardly, but depends upon this <HI>Hôtel.</HI> One can hardly desire a better contrived building

<PB N="149" REF="163"/>
Buildings to be pull'd down, which obstructed the form of that Plan which the Cardinal himself had drawn out. The Key, which was broken off in this place, was continued as far as the <HI>Pont-Rouge,</HI> and at last they raised the Buildings in such manner as we now see them, of a most curious Ordinance without. They consist of two great Pavillions, square and very high, adorn'd with Corinthian Pilasters, which standing in a Demi-Circle, enclose a small Place or open Court; at the further part of which is the Portal of the Chapel raised upon some steps, and adorn'd with six Corinthian Pillars, which make a kind of Portico. Over all the Work, which stands some∣thing higher than the Wings, are placed twelve Statues, representing the four Evangelists, the Fathers of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, and the Fathers of the <HI>Latin</HI> Church; these serve for an Ornament to the Dome which rises above them, and is en∣rich'd without with all the Ornaments one can desire, as gildings upon the Lead in manner of Festoons, and <HI>Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illages</HI> over the Slates, which are cut and placed like the Scales of Fishes. The inside of the Church is not in the splendor at pre∣sent which it is like to have in time. And the Tomb of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> which is to be placed here, is not yet begun. On the Frise over the Portal you may read this Inscription:</P>

<HI>Julius Mazarin,</HI> Cardinal of the holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church, caused this Church and School to be built, in the Year <HI>M. DC. LXI.</HI></Q>
<P>The inner part of this Colledge is very spa∣cious; it is composed of two Courts, the first of which and also the least, is adorn'd with two Portico's, one of which leads to the Church, in the other is the Stair-case that goes up to the Apartments of the foremost buildings. The other Court is very great and all the buildings run along one side only, in which are convenient Lodgings for a very great number of People. The Schools are below in the Ground Rooms, level with the Court. But these things ought not to detain you long, you ought to see the Library which is composed of Thirty five thou∣sand Volumes, collected together by Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> with great Care and Charges. They are placed in excellent order, and the Presses are wrought of Wainscot adorn'd with Pillars and Sculpture. This Library is of great length, and it takes up one of the Pavillions that runs out upon the Key. Monsieur <HI>de la Potrie</HI> one of the most intelligent men of the Kingdom in Books, hath the care of this Library, and shews it to the Curious very obligingly. It is said that it will be made publick, and that people will have allowance to study there on certain days every Week, as is done in that of St. <HI>Victor</HI>'s, but no body knows when this will be. The Revenue which is ap∣propriated
<PB N="151" REF="164"/>
for the maintenance of this Colledge is considerable: For beside the Abby of St. <HI>Michael en Herme,</HI> which is of a great Rent; there are several Houses in the <HI>Rüe Mazarin,</HI> from which arises a very great Summ of Money. The De∣sign of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> was to entertain here the Gentlemen of those four several Nations, whose Country hath been so long time the Theater of War, and that they might be here Instructed in all those Exercises that are proper for Persons of Quality. Here are to be Sixty in all; Fifteen from the parts about <HI>Pignerol,</HI> for <HI>Italy;</HI> as many out of <HI>Alsatia</HI> for <HI>Germany;</HI> Twenty out of the Catholick Low Countrys; and Ten from <HI>Rous∣sillon;</HI> that so these people being acquainted with the French manners, may have an affection for that Nation from whom they have received such Benefits. The Doctors of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> are to have the Government of the Colledge, and to teach here Humanity. Here is also to be taught the Riding the great Horse, and there is already a place set out for a <HI>Manege</HI> (or Rideing School.) They are also to be taught to Dance, to handle their Armes, to Vault; the Mathematicks, and all <HI>belles Lettres,</HI> (or Polite Learning.) And these Gentlemen have all this and all sort of Enter∣tainment <HI>gratis,</HI> without costing them one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar∣thing, which makes this Foundation esteem'd as one of the best, and most useful that could be in∣vented.</P>

<P>The <HI>Cours de la Reine,</HI> is on the other side of the River, at the end of the <HI>Tuilleries;</HI> it was planted with four rows of Trees, as we see it, by the care of <HI>Mary of Medicis,</HI> who gave the publick this agreeable Walk: The <HI>Marechal de Bassompierre</HI> has been at the charge to enclose it on that side next the River, all along with a Wall of Freestone. It is in length a Roman <HI>Stadium,</HI> and at each end hath a Door of Iron, supported with certain Stone Works of a Rustick Order, which make a very handsom effect.

<P>The Structure of this Church is of the <HI>Gothick</HI> manner, but the handsomest and best perform'd in <HI>France.</HI> It is very remarkable for its Gran∣deur and Solidity. The Vaults are very high
<PB N="157" REF="167"/>
raised, and contain 17. <HI>Toises</HI> (a <HI>Toise</HI> is six Foot) in height, the breadth is 24. and the length 65. The 2. great squate Towers in the Front, are 34 <HI>Toises</HI> high, flat on the top, so that from this place one may easily and conveniently dis∣cover all <HI>Paris.</HI> The Bells that hang in the Towers are very fair ones, the biggest of them was cast but a while ago, for which purpose the Chapter hath been at a very considerable ex∣pence, and yet it hath no very pleasing Sound. All the Body of the Church is cover'd with Lead, and it is easie to judge what a prodigious quantity there goes to cover so great a Roof.</P>
<P>As for the inside of the Church, the Curious who are Lovers of Painting, will here find suffi∣cient satisfaction in viewing those great Pictures which all the Pillars are adorn'd with. Those in the Quire are much better than the rest. Here are two of M. <HI>Le Brun</HI>'s hand, one representing the Crucifying of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> the other the Mar∣tyrdom of St. <HI>Steven.</HI> Here is also one piece of <HI>le Sueur</HI>'s, representing St. <HI>Paul</HI> in the midst of a Publick Assembly, casting into a Fire the Books of Magick, before the Gate of the Temple, whose Portico is supported with Pillars: This Picture ought to be esteem'd as one of the choicest that can be seen, it being of the best manner of that excellent Master, who in the Judgment of some able Men, is esteem'd the Se∣cond <HI>French</HI> Painter of this Age, and next to the famous <HI>Poussin.</HI> In former Years on every first day of <HI>May,</HI> the Company of <HI>Goldsmiths</HI> did use to present a Picture to this Church, for the ma∣king of which they employ'd some renowned Painter, who had made himself known and gain'd a Reputation; but this Year the Custom
<PB N="158" REF="168"/>
hath been intermitted, tho' we hope it will be continued again hereafter. There are few Cathe∣dral Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> wherein the Divine Service is perform'd with more exactness and Reverence. The Chapter is composed of 50. Canons, among whom there are some very fa∣mous and of great Merit.</P>
<P>Among the rest, Monsieur <HI>Joli,</HI> the Chanter, and one of the Canons, is known to be a person of extraordinary Probity and Diligence in his Office, and who to his singular Merit hath ad∣ded a profound Learning. He hath made pub∣lick several Works, some of which are already very scarce to be met with. The principal are</P>

<P>This last mention'd Book is a most curious piece. He hath also compiled together the Works of Monsieur <HI>Guy Coquille,</HI> containing many Curious Tracts relating to the Liberties of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church, in two Volumes in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olio. He had a numerous Library, but gave it away to the Chapter about two years since, on Condition that it be publick, and that all sorts of People may have liberty to come and study in it freely. It is at present in a house in the Cloifter, behind the Draw-wells, on that side next the Church; and we may e're long see it considerably augmented, some other of the Canons having promised to add their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooks to it.</P>
<P>It ought to be observed that the Canons of this Church rise at midnight to go to <HI>Matines,</HI> which they still say at that hour, according to the ancient usage of the Church. There are some
<PB N="160" REF="169"/>
antient Men among these hanons, who for 30. or 40. Years together, have not omitted one single time: and this is almost the only Church in the Kingdom, that hath Religiously conti∣nued this pious Custom, tho' so painful and troublesom, especially in Winter. The Ca∣nons places are of no great Revenue, yet they are much esteem'd, because they are very honou∣rable.</P>
<P>On Festival days you may see here very rich Ornaments. Their Silver Vessels, or Altar Plate, is of the best Workmanship. It consists of six great Candlesticks, and a Cross made by Monsieur <HI>Baslin.</HI> Over the Copper Pillars, be∣hind the great Altar, is the Shrine of St. <HI>Marcel,</HI> one of the first Bishops of <HI>Paris.</HI> It is of Silver gilt, adorn'd with precious Stones, and Enamel of a delicate Colour. On <HI>Whit-sunday</HI> they ex∣pose here a Suit of Ornaments of Crimson Sat∣tin, Embroidered with Pearls, some of which are very large. This was the gift of Queen <HI>Isabel</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Wife of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. Which Present she made in order to obtain of God her Husbands Cure, being afflicted with a troublesom Distem∣per. The fair Suit of Tapistry, which they dis∣play here on the great Festivals, representing the Life of the Holy Virgin; is the gift of M. <HI>le Masle</HI> Prior of <HI>Roches,</HI> Chanter of this Church, and Secretary to the Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> the same who gave his Library to the <HI>Sorboune.</HI> The Statue which we see on a Pillar on the left hand of the great Altar, represents <HI>Philip Augu∣stus,</HI> whose Wife is interred here in the Quire; as is also a Son of <HI>Lewis the Gross,</HI> who refused to be Bishop of this Church, because he would not by his own promotion, hinder that of the fa∣mous

<HI>Peter Lombard,</HI> who was chosen in his stead. The Tomb of Copper raised about one Foot from the Ground, near the Quire Door, belongs to a Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> named <HI>Odo de Sulli,</HI> in whose Pontificate this Church was finish'd; he lived in the Reign of <HI>Philip Augustus,</HI> and died in the year 1208.</P>
<P>In the Chapels behind the Quire there are more Tombs, the most considerable of which are those of the House of <HI>Gondi,</HI> originally of <HI>Italy,</HI> who came into <HI>France</HI> with <HI>Catharine de Medicis,</HI> the Cardinal <HI>de Retz,</HI> who died about 3. years since Abbot of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> and had been Arch-Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> was the second Cardinal of this Family. The Chapel of the Virgin, which is on one side of the Door that leads into the Quire, is adorn'd with many Silver Lamps, and abundance of other curious Offerings that have been made here. Some years ago they placed before the great Altar, that huge Lamp of Silver, given by the late Queen-Mother, which weighs 120. Marks, (a Mark is 8 Ounces) and is six Foot in Diameter. This Chapel of the Virgin, has been sometimes called the Sluggards Chapel, because of the very late Masses which were said here for such as lay long a bed: It was the only place in <HI>Paris</HI> that enjoyed this priviledge, contrary to the Custom of the past Ages, when it was forbid to say Mass after 10. a Clock. Over against this is the Statue of <HI>Philip de Valois,</HI> on Horse∣back Armed, and Caparison'd as the fashion was in his time. He is represented in such manner, as when he came into this Church, to return his Thanks for a Battel gain'd over the <HI>Flemings</HI> near <HI>Cassel;</HI> a Battle so Bloody that he saw 22000. of his Enemies dead upon the place.
<PB N="162" REF="170"/>
Near this is a great Picture, representing <HI>Lewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> XIII. in his Royal Robes, kneeling at the Feet of Christ taken down from the Cross; it is the Vow of that King made in a dangerous fit of Sick∣ness. I shall say nothing of the several Chapels round the Nave, all well Wainscotted and Pain∣ted; nor of the Galleries over the sides capable of holding a vast number of People; for this would be to engage too far into particulars. I shall only say that <HI>Paulus Aemilius,</HI> that famous Historian, is interr'd in this Church on the North side, but the precise place is not known. However you might have read this Epitaph not long since.</P>

<HI>Bernin,</HI> which the Dutchess of <HI>Aiguillon</HI> gave to this Church by her Testament.</P>
<P>On the South side of this Church, stands the Archiepiscopal Palace, on the bank of the River <HI>Seine.</HI> The House makes no very handsom show on the outside, but is within very commodious and neat. Here is very handsom Furniture, and a Cabinet of choice Books. The Garden is but little, and consists only of one or two Alleys along the River.</P>
<P>Behind the Church of <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> stands another little one very ancient, call'd <HI>St. Denis du Pas,</HI> because the first Torment that they in∣flicted upon that Saint was in this place, where they put him into a hot Oven, from which he was deliver'd by a Miracle.</P>
<P>The Cloister where the Canons live is in∣closed with ancient Walls, within which they have their several Apartments. Formerly when they lived in Community like the Religious, Women were not suffered to dwell here; but since they have been Secularized, they have had distinct Lodgings, and it hath been permitted to those who have room to spare, to let out their Apartments, which has been the occasion to in∣troduce here all sorts of People.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Menage,</HI> so well known among the Learn∣ed for all his excellent Works▪ dwells in this Cloister. Every <HI>Wednesday</HI> he hath in his House a Meeting for the improvement of the Sciences, to which all Men who make any profession of Learning are freely admitted.</P>
<P>These are the most remarkable matters in this Cloister, which is join'd to the Isle of <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> by a Bridge of Wood, over which lies a Commu∣nication.</P>

From hence, you pass before the <HI>Hôtel-Dieu.</HI> This Hospital is the principal and greatest of all <HI>Paris;</HI> they receive here indifferently all poor Sick People, and you may sometimes reckon here to the number of 4000. who are all enter∣tained and nourished with exceeding great Care. They are served by Nuns of St <HI>Augustine</HI>'s Order, whose Rule is the more severe, in regard they are to spend their whole Life in this Exercise, which they could never undergo without admi∣rable Virtue and Patience, by reason of all those incommodities which they pass through, near so many poor Sick People, whose Miseries and Diseases render them equally froward and insup∣portable. This Hospital hath very great Re∣venues, and they encrease daily more and more, by reason of the gifts that are continually given to it. The building is not handsom, nay it is very incommodious, because it is straitned for Room; the Ground on which it stands being shut up on all sides. They have been therefore con∣strained to extend their buildings upon the very River, and to erect a great Room upon a long Vault, under which the Stream runs. Tho' there be here a very great number of Beds, they are not sufficient for that greater quantity of Sick which are brought hither every day; and some∣times they are constrained to put 3. or 4. in the same Bed. They have several and distinct Rooms, where they lodge those who are afflicted with like Distempers, that so the Disease may not spread. The Hall on that side next the <HI>Petit-Pont,</HI> whose outside is adorn'd with Figures, was built by <HI>Cardinal Anthony du Prat,</HI> Chancel∣lor of <HI>France,</HI> and Legate of the Holy See, about the Year 1535. It is thought that the first
<PB N="165" REF="171"/>
Foundation of this great Hospital was laid by St. <HI>Landri,</HI> the 28<HI>th.</HI> Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who lived under <HI>Clovis</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> in the Year 660. In the first Ages of Christianity, Bishops were, by a laudible Cu∣stom, obliged to Nourish and Lodge the Poor, as being the Dispensators and Trustees of the Poors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>state. For this reason they built Hospitals near their Cathedral Churches, to the end that so they might be the principal Administrators themselves; as at this Day the Arch-Bishop hath the chief direction here, with the Primier Presi∣dent, and the Procurer General; the Canons of <HI>Nostre-Dame</HI> have the Direction of the Spiri∣tuals.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> as <HI>William de Nangis,</HI> who hath com∣pos'd a History of <HI>France</HI> much esteemed, tells us▪ was a great Benefactor to this Hospital, and did considerably augment its revenue. <HI>Henry</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> did the like, giving wherewithal to build one of the fairest Halls, which is that of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> raised upon a Stone Bridge, very solid, and finisht 1602. It is a very Edifying Curiosity to see in what manner the Poor are served in this Hospital. Princesses have sometimes performed here the vilest Offices of Ser∣vants; and even in our days we have known <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Dutchess of <HI>Nevers,</HI> Mo∣ther of <HI>Madam R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iale,</HI> &amp; of the Queen of <HI>Portu∣gal</HI> deceased.</NOTE>one dye of a Dis∣ease which she caught here in giving some Broth to a Poor Creature. sick of the Small Pox.</P>
<P>Over against the principal Gate that goes into the <HI>Parvis de Nostre-Dame,</HI> you may see a great Stone Statue, very high, which represents a Man holding a Box in his hand, and a Serpent by his side. It is supposed to be the Statue of
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
<HI>Esculapius,</HI> God of the Physicians, who is presu∣med to have had some Temple in this place. On the Fountain behind this Statue, these Verses are ingraved.</P>

<P>St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> over against the same Church.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Geneviéve des Ardens,</HI> which has been so named, by reason of a famous Miracle, which happen'd through the Intercession of that Saint, when her Shrine was carried in procession to <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> in order to the obtaining a Cure for an Epidemical Disease, call'd <HI>Les Ardens,</HI> because those who were afflicted with this Distemper were inflamed with such a Thirst, that no Remedy could abate. This Miracle happen'd in the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> VI. in the year 1130. under the Ponti∣ficate of Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> And for a perpe∣tual Memorial, this Church was built, it being

Here is a Fraternity that was formerly of so great Reputation, that the greatest Lords entered themselves of it, after the Examples of the King, and the Princes of the Blood. The other Churches are</P>

<P>St. Peter des Arcis.</P>
<P>St. Martial.</P>
<P><HI>St. Germain le Vieux.</HI> Whose great Altar is of a very handsom Wainscot Work, adorned with Corinthian Pillars of black Marble, with a Pi∣cture representing the Baptism of our Lord, Painted by <HI>Stella,</HI> an excellent Master. This Church was formerly dedicated to St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> before they brought hither the Reliques of St. <HI>Germain,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Pepin,</HI> for fear they should be plundered by the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> if they remained in the Abby of his name, which at that time stood without the Town. That King himself assisting in carrying the Shrine upon his own Shoulders from the Abby to this place. In memory of the Miracle which then happened as they past by the little <HI>Châtelet,</HI> he gave to St. <HI>Germains</HI> the Estate at <HI>Palaiseau,</HI> six Leagues from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Lower in the Street near the <HI>Palais,</HI> are the <HI>Bar∣nabites.</HI> These Religious have been in the Possessi∣on of this Priory, but since the beginning of this Age before that time it belonged to the Order of St. <HI>Benet,</HI> under the name of St. <HI>Eloy.</HI> And the Re∣venues are re-united to the Arch-Bishoprick of <HI>Paris.</HI> Their Church is unfinisht. The House which they have erected here, about four or five years since▪ hath cost them more than 50000. Crowns; but it was a very necessary building, for before that they had hardly any Lodgings to lye in.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> is also over against the <HI>Palais,</HI> to which and to all this Quarter it belongs as the proper Parish Church. This was formerly also a Priory of the Order of St. <HI>Benet,</HI> dedicated to
<PB N="167" REF="173"/>
St. <HI>Magloire,</HI> but the Monks left it, to avoid the Tumult and Noise of the place, and removed to the <HI>Faux-bourg Saint Jacques,</HI> near the little Chapel of St. <HI>George,</HI> belonging to them at that time. This Translation was made, as hath been already said, in the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Young, in the Year 1138. This Benefice was since re∣united to the Arch-Bishoprick, and the Church made Parochial, the Extent of which Parish reaches to the <HI>Rüe St. Denis, St. Zue St. Giles</HI> was once annext to this; and we have known a Curate who was possest of both these Benefices, but they have been since divided because of the great distance.</P>
<P>The Church is obscure and ill built. The great Altar is of Wainscot Work, and of a hand∣som design. There is a Chapel on the right hand, in which you may see two Pictures of M. <HI>Herault</HI>'s Work, one represents St. <HI>William,</HI> and the other St. <HI>Charles B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>romeus.</HI> That over the Altar is of M. <HI>Loir</HI>'s hand, and represents St. <HI>Ca∣tharine</HI> kneeling, and receiving on her Finger a Ring, which is put on by the Infant <HI>Jesus.</HI> The rest is not much remarkable.</P>
<P>Missire <HI>Lewis Servin,</HI> Advocate General in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> is interr'd in St. <HI>Bartholo∣mew</HI>'s. He was a person who had gain'd by his extraordinary Merit, the Respect and Love of all those who knew him; and his Reputation was so great throughout all <HI>Europe,</HI> that the most Famous Men of Learning of his time, made it their glory to hold a Commerce by Letters with him, as we see in their Printed Works, where are some Letters of his, of wonderful Wit and Genius. His inviolable Fidelity for the Right side, gain'd him the Confidence of <HI>Henry</HI> III.

who made him his Advocate-General, after the dismission of Messire <HI>Jaques Faye Despesses,</HI> which Office he perform'd with a most exemplary Inte∣grity, until the Year 1626. in which he died, as he was making an Oration to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. then sitting on his Throne of Justice in the Par∣liament.

<P>IF I had obliged my self in this Collection, to speak of the Antiquities of those things which I treat of in <HI>Paris,</HI> I should have had occasion here to mention many particulars; but after all it had been only a repetition of what many Authors have already said.

<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
I will only say to the honour of those who compose this great Body, that <HI>Pepin</HI> Father of <HI>Charlemagne</HI> did first Institute it; and that it was ambulatory till the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fair, who, as <HI>Belforest</HI> reports, was the first who made it Sedentary, in quitting his own proper Palace to the Officers of Justice. To make it the more spacious, he caused to be built the greatest part of the Chambers, and the whole work was fi∣nisht in the year 1313. Notwithstanding it is certain that there were in this place several great Buildings before that time, in regard several Kings made this place their usual abode. <HI>Clovis</HI> himself kept his Court here; but St. <HI>Lewis</HI> dwelt here longer than any, for finding the Situation commodious in the middle of <HI>Paris,</HI> he made here several great Works, especially the Holy Chapel, of which more by and by.</P>
<P>The chief remarks in this great building is, first, the great Hall, admired by the Cavalier <HI>Bernin,</HI> as one of the handsomest things in <HI>France.</HI> It is built upon the same <HI>Plan,</HI> with another very old which was burnt down in the beginning of this Age, in which the Statues of all our Kings were placed round about the Walls, as big as the Life. In this Hall the Kings did use to receive Embassa∣dors, and made publick Feasts on certain days in the year, and also here they celebrated the Nup∣tials of the Sons and Daughters of <HI>France.</HI> At the Marriage of <HI>Isabel</HI> of <HI>France</HI> with <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, King of <HI>England,</HI> there was in this place so great a Croud of People, that many persons were stifled. <HI>Charles</HI> the Sixth who Reign'd at that time, was himself in danger of his Life.</P>
<P>This Hall is all Vaulted with Freestone, with a row of Arches in the middle, supported with
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
great Pillars, round which are several Shops employed by divers Tradesmen; the Dorick Or∣der of Pilasters run round the Hall. At one end is a Chapel where Mass is said every day; the <HI>Procureurs</HI> (or Attorneys) to whom this Chapel belongs, have about a year since laid out 40000. <HI>Francs</HI> to beautifie it as we now see.</P>
<P>Above this is the Clock, according to which the Hearings or Audiences in the several Courts are regulated. At the bottom of the Dial, you may read this neat Verse made by M. <HI>de Montmort,</HI> one of the <HI>French</HI> Academicians.</P>

The great Chamber is on one side of the great Hall; it was built in the time of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> who used here to give his Publick Au∣diences, in which, with the kindness of a Father, and the Majesty of a great King, he endeavoured to pacifie the disorders that rise among his Subjects, or received the Embassadors sent from the Neigh∣bouring Princes. <HI>Lewis</HI> the XII. repair'd it as it is at present. The <HI>Plafon</HI> composed of <HI>Culs de Lampe</HI> (Work in the Ceiling swelling down with knobs) was heret fore esteemed as an excellent piece of Work; but time has decayed a great part of that which made it esteem'd. This is the Room
<PB N="171" REF="175"/>
where all the Parliament assemble when the King comes hither to sit on his Tribunal of Ju∣stice, or at such times when there is any great Affair for them to deliberate upon. In this place also the Dukes and Peers of <HI>France</HI> come and demand to have their Patents Register'd, which they obtain'd of the King, for the Erection of their Dignities. The other Chambers are much handsomer than this, and in some of them the <HI>Pla∣fons</HI> (or Ceilings) are gilt and painted very richly. The 2<HI>d.</HI> and 3<HI>d.</HI> Chambers of Inquests, and the Chambers of Requests are the best adorn'd.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Sainte Chapel.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the Monuments of Piety which St. <HI>Lew∣is</HI> raised, there is none more beautiful or more magnificent than this. Who making his usu∣al aboad in this Palace, caused this Chapel to be erected for the conveniency of his own Devotion. In the same place where it now stands there was formerly a small Church Founded by King <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> under the title of <HI>The Adoration of three Kings,</HI> in which Church <HI>Robert</HI> his Son did insti∣tute an Order of Knights, called <HI>Knights of the Star.</HI> This Order was of great Reputation in the beginning of its Institution, and the greatest Lords accepted of the Collar. But in process of time it became so vilified, that it came to be confer'd on the Town Watch, who go about in the Night time to prevent disorders, that might happen in the Streets from Thieves and Robbers. From whence it comes, that at this day, the Captain who commands that Watch is called the <HI>Chevalier du Guet</HI> (the Knight of the Watch). This little Chapel remain'd in such Estate till the time of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> who built the
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
Structure which we now see, a building of sur∣prising Delicacy. The Vaults are very high, and the Windows of it pass for the handsomest that can be seen, by reason of their bigness and almost infinite Variety of Colours, representing some particular History of the Old and New Te∣staments, the Glass of which is of such thickness, that it hath resisted the injuries of time down to this day. This beautiful Work was but five years in doingand was finisht in the year 1247. In a lit∣tle time after which, they brought hither the Re∣liques which are kept here. These were redeem'd by that holy King out of the hands of the <HI>Veneti∣ans,</HI> to whom <HI>Baldwin</HI> Emperor of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> had engaged them for a very considerable Summ of Money, which they lent him to carry on his War against the <HI>Bulgarians.</HI> This Redemption of these precious Pawns by St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> was not done without the Emperors knowledge and consent to take them, upon paying to the <HI>Venetians</HI> the Moneys for which they were engaged. They were as follows, A great piece of Wood, part of the true Cross; our Lord's Crown of Thorns, and certain drops of his precious Blood; some of the Cloths which belonged to his Infancy; another piece of the true Cross, some Blood which bled Miraculously from an Image of our Lord struck by an Infidel; one link of Iron, part of the Chain wherewith he was bound; the Napkin or Towel with which he washed his A∣postles Feet; a piece of the Stone of his Sepul∣cher; some of the Holy Virgins Milk; the Iron head of the Lance that pierced our Lord's side; the Purple Robe with which they Clothed him; the Spunge which they used in giving him Vinegar and Gall to Drink; a piece of the
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
Shroud in which he was wrapped: Together with these things there is kept in the same Treasury, a Cross which our Ancestors used to carry with the <HI>Oriflame,</HI> which is at St. <HI>Denis,</HI> when they marched out to any Wars of Consequence, which Cross was call'd on that account <HI>The Cross of Tri∣umph;</HI> and many other things beside, as <HI>Moses</HI>'s Rod; the upper part of St. <HI>John Baptist</HI>'s Head: all which things are enclosed in the great Shrine of Copper gilt, which you see raised upon four Pillars, supporting a little Vault behind the great Altar: But with the sight of these things one must not expect to satisfie his curio∣sity, for these precious Reliques hardly ever are exposed, but when some Queen desires to see them, which happens very rarely. Upon the great Altar, in a kind of Tabernacle or Box of Wood, gilt and powder'd with Flowers-de-Lis, is the model of the Holy Chapel in little of Silver gilt, and of most excellent Workmanship, en∣richt with Stones of considerable value. It is shew'd only on Festival Days. There are also in the Sacristy other things to be seen that are very rare, especially a great number of Reliquaries of Gold and Silver; a great Cross all of Gold, in which is enclosed a piece of the Wood of the true Cross, which is exposed every Friday in <HI>Lent.</HI> You may here also see the Chanters Staff, on the top of which is placed a great Agate, represent∣ing St. <HI>Lewis</HI> to the Wast, holding in one hand a little Cross, and in the other our Lord's Crown of Thorns. Here are also several Books whose Co∣vers are enricht with great Pearls and precious Stones.</P>
<P>But that which is extraordinary rare is a great antique Oriental Agate, very fine, of Figure
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
almost Oval, a little bigger than an ordinary▪ Trencher-Plate; it is cut in Bas-relief, and re∣presents the <HI>Apotheosis</HI> of <HI>Augustus,</HI> the Work∣manship is really most admirable, by reason that the design is so contrived, that the Natural Co∣lours of the Stone serve for Shadows in their proper places, where they should be according to Art, and make the same effect as if the Work of the Pencil. Monsieur <HI>de St. Avant,</HI> a Famous Antiquary, hath explain'd all the Figures in this Piece, and discovered to us very curious things, which may be read in his great Treatise of Me∣dals. This fair Agate was a Present made by an Emperor of <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Charles</HI> VI. in order to obtain some Succors from him against the <HI>Turks;</HI> but this he could not have, by reason of those Troubles which the <HI>English</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> then caused in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Ornaments of the Altar in this Church are magnificent, especially those which are ex∣posed on the Feast of <HI>St. Lewis,</HI> whose Head you see of Silver gilt supported by two Angels of the same materials formerly kept in the Treasury of St. <HI>Denis.</HI> As you go out you ought to observe a handsom Figure of our Lady of Pity, placed under the Organs on the left hand as you enter; 'tis the Work of the famous <HI>Germain Pilon,</HI> who lies buried in the lower Holy Chapel: this is esteemed as one of his best pieces. The Chapter of this Church is not numerous, yet are the Ca∣nons places of a good Revenue and enjoy fair Pri∣viledges. They have for their Superiour a Treasurer, whose place is double the Revenue of the other Canons. The Abby of St. <HI>Nicaise</HI> at <HI>Reins,</HI> worth 3000.

<P>I might here name many other Learned Men, who have drawn great Light for History out of the <HI>Chamber of Accounts;</HI> among others the Mes∣sieurs <HI>Godefroy,</HI> who have made publick a great many of our old Historians, now lately Printed at the Royal Press in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> with excellent Commentaries at the end.

<P>The buildings of <HI>the Chamber of Accounts,</HI> hath been in its time esteemed as a handsom piece of Work. It was at first raised by <HI>Lewis</HI> XII.

Father <HI>Menétrier</HI> thought them so curious and so singular, that he caused them to be graved, and we may meet with the Prints in some places, with Historical explicati∣ons of the Persons and Blazons represented, which are writ by the said Father.</P>
<P><HI>La Cour des Monnoys,</HI> or Court belonging to the Mint and Coynage, is over the Chamber of Accounts. in which there is nothing singular to be observed. Monsieur <HI>Croussin</HI> is one of the Presidents, to the praise of whom it may be said, that no Man hath laboured with more Success for the improvement of the <HI>French</HI> Tongue. He has Translated out of Greek all the Authors that have writ of the <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> History; in the beginning of which he hath adjoin'd very Learned Prefaces, for the better understanding of those Historians, who for the most part are so obscure and intricate, that, without his helps, we should hardly be able to understand any thing in them. Never did any body before un∣dertake this Work, because so very difficult; those Historians being lookt upon as half Barba∣rous. But now by the assistanc eof this Learned

<HEAD>THE BRIDGES of <HI>PARIS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN regard the Bridges of <HI>Paris</HI> make a con∣siderable part of the beauties of this great City, we have thought it proper to make a particular Chapter of that subject; and there∣by to have the more liberty in explaining the singularities thereof.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Bridge of <HI>Notre-Dame.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis is the oldest and the first that was built with Stone. It was finish'd as we now see it, in the Year 1507. A Cordelier, originally of <HI>Verona,</HI> undertook the work, at the Charges
<PB N="181" REF="180"/>
of the <HI>Hôtel de Ville.</HI> Historians say his name was <HI>Joannes Jucundus,</HI> and that he was in great reputation for his wonderful knowledge in all sorts of Learning: They add also, That the famous <HI>Julius Scaliger</HI> was his Scholar. On one of the Arches you may read these Verses gra∣ved in the Stone:
<Q LANG="lat"><L>JUCUNDUS GEMINOS POSUIT TIBI SE∣QUANA PONTES,</L>
<L>HUNC TU JURE POTES DICERE PON∣TIFICEM.</L></Q></P>
<Q><L><HI>Jucundus</HI> he re a double Bridge did frame,</L>
<L>Him Pontifex Posterity may name.</L></Q>
<P>This Bridge is loaden with Houses on both sides, but they are not so high built as those on the other Bridges. These Houses are beauti∣fied in the front, with great <HI>Termes</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A <HI>Terme</HI> is a kind of Pila∣ster in the lower half, and to∣wards the top fashion'd like a Man or Woman without Armes.</NOTE>of Men and Women, supporting on their Heads Bas∣kets of Fruit; between every two are certain <HI>Medals▪</HI> in which are represented all the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> with every one a Verse sutable to him. Time had much decay'd these things, but they were well repaired a∣gainst the late Queen made her Entry, she pas∣sing over here as she went to the <HI>Louvre.</HI> And of a long time it has been the Custom for the Queens to pass over this Bridge, when they make their first
<PB N="182" REF="181"/>
Entrys into <HI>Paris,</HI> at which time these Buildings are adorned Magnificently. It is reported that when <HI>Isabel</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> made hers, it was cover'd from one end to the other, with a kind of Pavillion of blue Taffaty, powder'd with Flowers-de-Lis of Gold, they say also that by means of a wonder∣ful and suprising Machin, an Angel flew down from one of the Towers of <HI>Nostre-Dame</HI> Church, and placed a Crown of Gold upon her Head. But though this Deed is recorded by an Historian of that time, it seems to me that one may reaso∣nably doubt the truth of it.</P>
<P>In the middle of this Bridge are erected two Machins, which draw up the River Water for the use of those Quarters of the Town which are far distant. The Gate belonging to this place is of the Ionick Order, set off with certain Orna∣ments which make no bad effect. The following Verses of Monsieur <HI>Santeüil</HI>'s, whom we have so often mention'd, are ingraved upon black Mar∣ble in Letters of Gold:</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Pont au Change.</HEAD>
<P>THis is the next Bridge to the <HI>Pont-Neuf.</HI> It has this name because formerly there were a great many Money-Changers, or Banckers, who inhabited the Houses on this Bridge, and made a kind of Exchange or <HI>Bource</HI> in this place. It has been also formerly called the <HI>Pont aux Oiseaux,</HI> or Bridge of Birds, because no doubt of Birdsellers here dwelling. But be∣ing in the Year 1629, burnt down by an ex∣traordinary Fire, it being then of Wood, it was afterwards rebuilt of Freestone, as we now see it, with so much solidity, that they have erected upon it two Rows of double Houses
<PB N="184" REF="182"/>
four Stories high, all of them arched with Free∣stone. These Houses are inhabited by Traders, who have their Warehouses on the side next the Water, and their Shops in the forepart. This Bridge has the most Passengers of all in <HI>Paris,</HI> because of the <HI>Palais</HI> which stands at the end of it.</P>
<P>At one end, over a house which fronts the Bridge, you may see the King's Statue about the Age of 10. years old, Crown'd with Laurel by the Figure of a Victory. This Statue is raised on a little Pedestal; and on each side of it are the Statues of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th.</HI> and <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> as big as the Life, in Brass. These Statues are very well design'd, and very like.</P>
<P>The Key or Wharf, called <HI>Qua de Gesvers,</HI> leads from this Bridge, to the Bridge of <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> under cover all the way. It is supported by Vaults, whose Foundation is in the River, of a sort of Work extraordinary hardy, those who affect such things ought to go down and observe it.</P>
<P>At the other end of the <HI>Pont au Change,</HI> at the Corner of the <HI>Quay de Morfondus,</HI> is the Clock belonging to the <HI>Palais;</HI> the Dyal of which is adorned with certain figures of one of the most famous Sculptors of the last age. In regard it was done in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. the Arms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> stand over it, with this Verse, still legible, which that King used as his Device or Motto.</P>

Who once gave two, now gives a triple Crown.</Q>
<P>This Clock guides the sittings in the Parli∣ament; and as often as there are any publick rejoycings, they ring the great Bell for some hours together.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pont St. Michel</HI> is also near the <HI>Palais'</HI> and opposite to the <HI>Pont au Change.</HI> It takes its name from the little Church of St. <HI>Michel,</HI> which stands within the Inclosure of the <HI>Palais;</HI> or perhaps because it leads to the Gate of that name, which once stood at the upper end of the <HI>Ruë de la Harpe,</HI> and was not long since demo∣lish'd, as we have already said in the page of this Second Part. This Bridge is also built upon; the Houses are of Brick and Freestone. Formerly it was of Timber only, like those of which we have already spoken; but it being broke down by a high flood, in the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. it was in a little time after re-built as we now see it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Petit Pont,</HI> one of the oldest Bridges of <HI>Paris,</HI> is on the same arm of the River that runs under the <HI>Pont St. Michel;</HI> the Houses on each side of it and the <HI>Little Châtelet</HI> at the end of it, hinders you from perceiving that you go over Water when you pass this way.</P>
<P>Within the limits of the <HI>Hôtel Dieu,</HI> are two other Bridges built: One of which is wholly belonging to that Hospital, the other is partly used for a conveniency of passage on foot to the Church of <HI>Nôtre-Dame,</HI> every one that goes o∣ver that way paying a <HI>Double</HI> for passage.

<P>IN fine, we are now arrived at the last Arti∣cle of this Description, which cannot be better concluded than with the <HI>Pont-Neuf,</HI> from which one may discover part of the most magnificent objects of all <HI>Paris.</HI> The <HI>Pont-Neuf</HI> was begun under <HI>Henry III.</HI> who laid the first Foundation in the Year 1578. and gave the conduct of the Work to a famous Architect, named <HI>du Cer∣ceau.</HI> That King being accompanied with <HI>Catha∣rine de Medicis,</HI> his Mother, (who as some say did first think of this great Work) the Queen his Wife, and with all the illustrious Persons of his Court, at that time laid the first Stone, with a great Show and Ceremony, upon which Stone this Inscription is graved:</P>

<P><PB N="187" REF="183"/>
They began the Work with much eagerness at that end next the <HI>Great Augustins;</HI> but the Troubles of that King's Reign prevented this great Enterprise from being finish'd in his time. It remained imperfect from its first undertaking in the Year 1578, as I have said, till the Year 1604, when <HI>Henry the Great,</HI> of happy memo∣ry, compleated the Work, by the means of <HI>Wil∣liam Marchand.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable that this Bridge is one of the most beautiful that can be seen for its length, which extends over the two arms of the <HI>Seine,</HI> which unite here into one Channel; for its breadth, which is divided into three ways, one in the midst for Coaches and great Carriages, and two on each side raised higher for those who go on foot; and lastly for its structure, which is of such solidity and of such an ordinance, that has but few equals.</P>
<P>Among these advantages one may also add the delicate Prospect which the Passenger has from it: A view which passes for one of the most pleasing and finest of the World; and if we may believe those who have seen foreign parts, and the report of one of the greatest Travellers in this age, he tells us, That he never observed any Prospect more magnificent, naming this for the third of those which he hath observed, to wit, That of the Port at <HI>Constantinople:</HI> that of the Port at <HI>Goa</HI> in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and this of the <HI>Pont-Neuf</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> which extends on one side over the <HI>Louvre</HI> which runs along the <HI>Seine,</HI> with a long row of magnificent buildings; and on the other side the <HI>Hôtel de Conti,</HI> the Colledge of the <HI>Quatre-Nations,</HI> which is very remarkable for its Dome, and for the two great square

Pavillions which stand before it; and in fine, for many other great Houses which extend a great way, with the <HI>Cours de la Reine,</HI> which de∣termines this Prospect, and Mount <HI>Valerien</HI> which appears over all; which Views altogether make a most beautiful Prospective as they ex∣tend into a Landskip. I say nothing of the continual press of People passing over this Bridge, by which one may guess at the infinite number of Inhabitants in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

<P>THis Monument stands at the middle of the <HI>Pont-Neuf,</HI> at the corner of the <HI>Isle du Palais:</HI> It was set up in the Year 1635, by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. to the memory of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. who is represented on Horse-back, as big as the life, all of Brass, and raised upon a Pedestal of White Marble; where the principal Actions of that great King are represented in <HI>Bas-Reliefs</HI> of the same Metal also, these are placed two and two of every side. At the four corners of the Pedestal are placed four Slaves of Brass also, treading upon certain Antique Arms, All these pieces, except the Horse, were designed and cast by one named <HI>Francheville,</HI> originally of <HI>Cam∣bray;</HI> who was esteemed as one of the best Scul∣ptors of his time, of whose hand you may see several other Works, much esteemed: among others, the Marble Statue representing Truth, in the <HI>Tuilleries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="184"/>
But the Curious will not be offended perhaps if I set down here the particular History of the Horse, which was made in <HI>Italy</HI> by the famous <HI>John de Bologne,</HI> or as the Painters commonly call him, <HI>Bologness. Cosmus</HI> the Second, great Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> gave it as a Present to <HI>Mary de Medicis,</HI> during her Regency, <HI>Lewis the</HI> 13<HI>th.</HI> being then under Age.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>Pescholini,</HI> was appointed to come into <HI>France</HI> to Present this Horse, in the name of the great Duke <HI>Cosmus</HI> the Second. The care of Imbarking at <HI>Legorn</HI> was committed to him; but it met with several accidents at Sea: A horrible Tempest forced the Vessel, in which it was, with so much impetuosity against a Bank of Sand, that it was Wrackt, and all its Freight lost; however this Statue was recover'd from the Sea, with much pains and cost, and once again it was Shipt in another Vessel; this last unhappily met with Pirates on the Coast of <HI>Spain;</HI> but in fine, after all these Troubles and Labour, it arrived at <HI>Havre de Grace</HI> in the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> 1615. And on the 2<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>June</HI> following, King <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th.</HI> laid the first Stone of the Pedestal, accompanied with Monsienr <HI>de Liancourt</HI> Governor of <HI>Paris,</HI> and several other Persons of Quality. Notwithstand∣ing all the Ornaments and all the outward parts of the Work were not quite finisht, till the Year 1635.</P>
<P>And lastly, that Posterity may be fully in∣structed of all that past, the Inscriptions on the four sides of the Pedestal were not thought suffi∣cient alone; they writ another upon Vellom, which they inclosed in a Pipe of Lead, and put that into the Belly of the Horse, which they
<PB N="190" REF="185"/>
filled full of Cole dust, the better to preserve it from Humidity, the Inscription is as fol∣lows:</P>
