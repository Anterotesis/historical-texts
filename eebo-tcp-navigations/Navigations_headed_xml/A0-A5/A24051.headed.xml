<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Ingenuous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT's not intended, by Publishing the Truth contained in these following Sheets, thereby to disparage any other <HI>Colony</HI> already Settled, or to be Settled in those Parts of <HI>America;</HI> but to contradict the Dis∣ingenuous, and False Reports of some Men, who have made it their Business to speak unjustly of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and Our Proceedings therein: As though the Methods of Settlement were Confused and Ʋncertain, no Man knowing his Own Land, and several such idle Lying Stories. Therefore, to satisfye the Reasonable and Ʋnprejudi∣ced, who desire to be rightly inform'd, the Manner or Method of Our Settlements are thus: The Country from the Mouth (that is, from the Sea) to the Head of <HI>Delaware-River,</HI> is about <HI>Two Hun∣dred</HI> and <HI>Fifty</HI> Miles in Length, and is divided into <HI>One Hundred</HI> Shares, or <HI>Proprieties;</HI> as may be seen by the Deeds made to every <HI>Purchaser</HI> thereof; every <HI>Proprietor</HI> naturally having a Considerable Quantity of his Land lying by the <HI>River</HI>-side: I say, every <HI>Proprie∣tor</HI> having a great Part of his Propriety contigious to that Noble and Navigable <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware,</HI> is an Accomodation of no small Va∣lue.</P>
<P>Then, as to the <HI>Government;</HI> one out of each of these <HI>Hundred Proprieties,</HI> is to be freely chosen by the Inhabitants thereof, to meet and sit as a General-Assembly, to make and alter Laws, to hear and redress all manner of Grievances whatsoever: And not any, the least Tax, either in Money or Goods, or any other Services, upon any Pretence whatsoever, to be imposed on the People, but by the Consent of these their Representatives in the General-Assembly: And this Assembly is to meet Annually upon a Day certain, as is Irrevocably ordained in one of the Chapters of Our <HI>General Concessions,</HI> as a Fundamen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, never to Alter or Change.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>The Number of Aeres in one of these <HI>Proprieties,</HI> is about <HI>Twen∣ty Thousand;</HI> though some (and those no ordinary Surveyors nei∣ther) have judged it to be almost as much more: But whether the Number be more or less, I shall not exactly affirm; But this I may assert, (and it ought to be considered by every Considering <HI>Purchaser)</HI> That a large Share of their Land being certain to lye upon so Brave and Navigable a <HI>River</HI> as <HI>Delaware</HI> is known to be, is in it self very Considerable, and may be vastly Advantagious to such <HI>Purcha∣sers,</HI> who at present, do, or hereafter shall Incline to Trade. And upon which <HI>River</HI> are several Good Towns and Settlements already, (viz.) <HI>Burlington, Northampton, Monmouth, Wellingbrough, Mansfield, Springton, Nottingham, Salem,</HI> and Others: In some whereof, are Considerable Manufacturies and Trade Established and Establishing: So that, <HI>New-Jersey</HI> in Reality is another thing, than what it was within these Seven Years, before it was Peopled and Set∣tled in that Order and Freedom as now it is; as some of these follow∣ing <HI>LETTERS</HI> (according to Reason) do testify, That those that go to <HI>New-Jersey</HI> now, need not undergoe any of the Difficulties that They did, who went over at first, when they had neither House nor Corn of their Own: But now they have Good of Both, and not only sufficient for Themselves, but considerably to spare, for the Ac∣commodating of such that shall come to Inhabit among them, until they can provide of Their Own.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving from the Discourse we had formerly, about the <HI>South-West-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> lying upon the <HI>Bay</HI> and <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware,</HI> perceived a great De∣sire in you, to be particularly informed thereof, from the Observations I had either made My Self, in my several Voyages into those Parts, or from the Collections I took from the <HI>English, Swedes,</HI> or <HI>Hollanders</HI>; and perceiving several of your Ingenious, Publick-spirited <HI>Friends</HI> were ingaged therein with <HI>Your Self,</HI> and that it was to be looked upon no longer for your own particular Curiosity, but as a Natio∣nal Concern, from the Thriving Genius of such Worthy Underta∣kers: Which, together with the Kindness I bear to Your Self, and the Person that made our Acquaintance, obliged Me, as soon as I could, to comply with your Commands.</P>
<P>Then be pleased to know, that the Lord <HI>Delaware,</HI> Governor of <HI>Virginia, Anno</HI> 1611. during his Stay in those Parts, spent one whole <HI>Summer</HI> in making a particular Search of all that Part of <HI>America</HI>; lying, and being Situate betwixt <HI>Cape-Augustine</HI> on the <HI>South-West,</HI> to <HI>Cape-Porpus</HI> on the <HI>North-East,</HI> which is from 28. to 44. Degrees of <HI>North-Latitude,</HI> and 430. Leagues by that Shoar; and having visited and viewed all the Remarkable <HI>Bays</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> as also, particularly Inspected the <HI>Clime</HI> and <HI>Soyl</HI> of all those Parts, pitched upon this Place, which is now called
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<HI>New-Jersey</HI>; which <HI>River</HI> the Lord <HI>Delaware</HI> called after his own Name, and by which the <HI>English</HI> have known it ever since. And it is not to be questioned, had not Death prevented his Purposes, but that he had prevailed with the then <HI>Lords-Commissioners,</HI> (cal∣led the <HI>Virginia-Company</HI>) to have removed that <HI>Colony</HI> to this Place: Which, without doubt, had prevented the Death of very many Thousands of the <HI>English Nation</HI>; who have, since that time, found their Graves in <HI>Virginia,</HI> by reason of the many <HI>Boggs, Swamps,</HI> and <HI>Standing-Waters,</HI> which corrupt the Air of the <HI>Coun∣try.</HI> And to shew you, that the Lord <HI>Delaware</HI> was not singular in this Point, see the Character given of it by <HI>Jeronama Beeckman</HI> of <HI>Stetin,</HI> in a <HI>Tract</HI> of his Printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1636. This <HI>Beeckman</HI> was sent thither with a Great <HI>Cargoe</HI> from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> by <HI>John Lussingen,</HI> and <HI>Peter Coyman,</HI> Eminent Merchants of that City; who trusted him with all their Concern, Laden on Two Ships, the <HI>Orania,</HI> and the <HI>Ickeabome</HI>; who Return'd in about <HI>Fourteen</HI> Months, bringing them Back in all sorts of <HI>Furs, Skins,</HI> and <HI>Poltry,</HI> clear Profit <HI>One Hundred</HI> and <HI>Thirty</HI> Pounds, <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> Thus much in General; but to come to Particulars:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> This <HI>Province</HI> (I mean the <HI>South-West-Part</HI> of it, borde∣ring upon the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware</HI>) is Situate parallel to the most Happy of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>Western</HI> Parts of the World; and is na∣turally stored with all Sorts of Timber, and other Materials for the Building and Equipping of Ships, Structure of Houses, making of Cabinets, and all other Curious Joyner's Work.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There is <HI>Sumach,</HI> and several other Drugs for the Use of <HI>Dyers</HI>; besides, some Trees there are, that produce both <HI>Gums,</HI> and <HI>Medicinal Oyls,</HI> as is observed by Doctor <HI>Adrian Vander-dunke,</HI> who searched that <HI>Country</HI> at his own proper Charge.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That there is all Sorts of <HI>English-Corn,</HI> and may be Two Harvests of several Sorts of <HI>Grain,</HI> in one Year: As also, that a Poor Man by his Reasonable Labour, can in the same Space of Time make <HI>Fifteen Thousand</HI> Pipe-Staves, which are worth on the Place <HI>Sixty</HI> Pounds; but at the <HI>Canaries, Three Hundred</HI> Pounds; which, according to an ordinary Calculation, is but Three Weeks Sail, and the Transportation is accounted but half at most.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That in this <HI>Province</HI> there is not only as good <HI>Iron-Mines</HI> as are in any Parts of the World; but also, great Con∣veniency from the Multitude of <HI>Brooks</HI> for <HI>Iron-Mills</HI>; which in the making thereof, would also clear the Ground of <HI>Wood,</HI> and fit it for Planting.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="4"/><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That <HI>Vines</HI> grow naturally all over this <HI>Province</HI>; of which, Wild as they are, <HI>Wines,</HI> and very Good <HI>Brandy</HI> have been made: And, I am well assured, if those <HI>Vines</HI> were Transplanted and Cul∣tivated accordingly, there might be Rich and Generous <HI>Wines</HI> made in the <HI>West-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jersey:</HI> But if <HI>Vine-Stocks</HI> of the <HI>Greek, Calabrian,</HI> and <HI>Cyprian,</HI> with the <HI>Candian-Grapes,</HI> were Transplan∣ted into this <HI>Province,</HI> (those <HI>Countries</HI> where these <HI>Grapes</HI> are in Perfection, lying parallel to This) there would certainly be a Sta∣ple, which may enrich both <HI>England,</HI> and all those Countries, to the Envy of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> That the Art, Use, and Excellency of the <HI>Silk-Worm</HI> might be had in this <HI>Province,</HI> with great Conveniency; the <HI>Mul∣berry-Trees</HI> growing there Wild, very numerous, and the Leaves to be had for gathering; whereas the <HI>French</HI> Nobility and Gentry make a Great Revenue of <HI>Mulberry-Trees</HI>; besides their Fruits, the Leaves of every Tree being Farmed in <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> as in Goodness, from <HI>Five</HI> Shillings to <HI>Twenty</HI> Shillings, and up∣wards, <HI>per Annum.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI> raised <HI>Anno</HI> 1671. <HI>Six∣ty Thousand</HI> Ducats on the Leaves of <HI>Mulberry-Trees</HI> alone, as he doth Yearly about the same Sum.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur Le Telliere,</HI> Great Uncle to the <HI>Marquess</HI> of <HI>Lovoy,</HI> Se∣cretary of State to the present <HI>French King,</HI> writ Observations on this Subject, <HI>Anno</HI> 1636. affirming, That <HI>Silk-Worms</HI> were Tran∣sported out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> in the Year 1540. and that they had not been in <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Provence</HI> in <HI>France</HI> above <HI>Sixty</HI> Years; &amp; yet the Revenue of <HI>Silk</HI> in those <HI>Provinces,</HI> was more worth both to the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Nobility,</HI> than the Product of <HI>Wine, Oyl, Woad,</HI> and all other Fruits whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur Agume,</HI> in his Observations on that Subject Printed at <HI>Lyons, Anno</HI> 1654. sayes, That in <HI>Forty</HI> Years, the making of <HI>Silk</HI> in the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> had brought into the <HI>Exchecquer</HI> or <HI>Financy</HI> of that <HI>Crown, Fifty Seven</HI> Millions of <HI>Livers,</HI> which is about <HI>One Hundred</HI> and <HI>Twenty Thousand</HI> Pounds, <HI>per Annum,</HI> Custom for the Raw <HI>Silk</HI> only. It is admirable to behold, how these <HI>Silk-Worms</HI> store up the Disposing-Matter, from whence the <HI>Silk</HI> comes; the which, by an Incomprehensible Mystery of Nature, they Vomit forth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Mouths, and spin out of their Bowels: And whatever is done of this kind in <HI>France,</HI> may much more, and to greater Ad∣vantage be accomplished in the <HI>South-West-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> whose Position of <HI>Latitude</HI> is nearer the <HI>Sun,</HI> than any Part of <HI>France.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
The <HI>Air</HI> of this <HI>Province</HI> is very Serene, Sweet, and Wholsome, which renders the <HI>Clime</HI> much more agreeable to <HI>European</HI> Bodies, than the severe Colds of <HI>New-England,</HI> or the sulphurous Heat in <HI>Virginia</HI>; where, I say, the Bogs, Marshes, and corrupt Standing-Waters, have ever been very Noxious to the Planter.</P>
<P>The Soyl of this <HI>Province</HI> is very Rich and Fruitful; and, for the most part, upon a Rising Level; and where it is interlaced with Hills, they are rather Gradual Prospects, than troublesom Ascents for above an Hundred Miles from the Sea. And where it is any whit Mountainous or Rocky, there are also Valleys extream Rich and Fertile: Besides, those Mountains have store of <HI>Black-Lead, Al∣lom, Sulphur, Copper,</HI> &amp;c. the which is confirmed by the Writings of <HI>Tararapha,</HI> and <HI>Monsieur Gallane,</HI> Son to the present <HI>President of Nants,</HI> a Person of great Quality, who spent the Years 1668, 69, and 70. in the Discovery of most of the <HI>Lakes, Mountains,</HI> and <HI>Countries, West,</HI> from <HI>Quebeck</HI> to the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Florida,</HI> which is be∣yond <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Gentleman</HI> gave me leave to read his <HI>Journal</HI>; wherein he af∣firms, That betwixt the Head of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and the <HI>Lake Ontaria,</HI> there are Mines of <HI>Sulphur, Allom, Lead, Copper,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> I mention This as well for your own Curiosity, as that such a Trade may be worth looking after, when it shall please <HI>God,</HI> to put those that settle your <HI>Colony,</HI> in a condition to ma∣nage it; which, I do assure you, in due time may be done, to Im∣mense Advantage.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Sir,</HI> I shall come to some other Observations of my own, having formerly drawn a particular <HI>Map</HI> of your <HI>Colony</HI> with my own Hand, by the Sea, from <HI>Sandy</HI>-point, and up the <HI>River,</HI> to the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Matinicocks</HI>; and, for my own Satisfaction, did (as of o∣ther Parts of <HI>America</HI>) ever make it my Business to discover not only the Scituation of Places; but also, the Original Discoverers, the several Governors, and their respective Fortunes; the most Remarkable Distempers, or Diseases; the Commodities, both Na∣tural and Accidental; what Advantage might be made by Trade; what Places were more or less Tenable by Nature, and what made Strong by Fortification; in what Manner, and to what Degree. Moreover, how those <HI>Colonies</HI> have Prospered or Declined in Trade, Increased or Decreased in Number of Inhabitants from <HI>Europe,</HI> and the proper Causes thereof; together, with the Governments, Cu∣stoms, and Commodities of the several <HI>Indian-Natives</HI>; and what
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
Advantage might be made of those Innocent, Good-natur'd <HI>Crea∣tures,</HI> in point of Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And this <HI>South-West-Part</HI> of <HI>New-West-Jersey,</HI> came not only un∣der this my General Survey; but having had a Concern in those Parts with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it fell more particularly under my Conside∣ration. The <HI>Longitude</HI> of this Place is Calculated to be from <HI>Three Hundred</HI> and <HI>Eleven,</HI> to <HI>Three Hundred</HI> and <HI>Eight</HI> Degrees; and bounded betwixt <HI>Thirty-Nine</HI> and <HI>Forty-Three</HI> Degrees of <HI>Latitude North,</HI> from the <HI>Aequator.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> Having before spoken of the Agreeableness of the <HI>Air</HI>; I shall only say in general, that the <HI>West-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> is by Nature sliced into a bundance of <HI>Rivers</HI> and <HI>Riv'leis,</HI> which every way glide in Deep and Navigable <HI>Channels,</HI> either for Shipping or Boats, betwixt the Breast of this Your plentiful Country; which highly contributes to its Conveniency, Beauty, and Fertility. These <HI>Rivers</HI> are also abundantly stored with all the <HI>species</HI> of the <HI>Fish</HI> of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and both larger and better tasted; being great Quantities of <HI>Stur∣geon</HI> in the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware,</HI> with divers other <HI>Fish</HI> peculiar only to that Clime; as <HI>Quictars, Dramps, Porgies</HI> or <HI>Sheep-Heads, Cony-Fish-Misyqua's,</HI> &amp; many others not seen in any Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> whose names (at present) I remember not; but these in particular are delicate <HI>Fish.</HI></P>
<P>As also, <HI>Land</HI> and <HI>Sea-Foul</HI> in abundance of all the sorts in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and some peculiar to that <HI>Country</HI> (as of <HI>Fish</HI>) not any where in the <HI>Europaean</HI> World that ever I saw. The <HI>Fruits</HI> of your <HI>Pro∣vince</HI> are all sorts of Delicate <HI>Melons, Apples, Pears, Damsons</HI>; and all other sorts of <HI>Plumbs, Apricocks, Peaches,</HI> and <HI>Malagotoons, Cher∣ries</HI> of several kinds, <HI>Quinces, Marucas, Grapes</HI> of Six sorts I have seen, <HI>Puchamines, Walnuts, Chesnuts, Strawberries, Rasberries, Cur∣rans Red</HI> and <HI>White, Gooseberries,</HI> and a great many other <HI>Wild-Fruits:</HI> As also, vast plenty of <HI>Mulberries,</HI> all sorts of Roots of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Potato's</HI> very good, with all sorts of <HI>Herbs</HI> both for <HI>Physick,</HI> and the <HI>Kitchin,</HI> in great Perfection, and no less Plenty. There is also <HI>Saxafras, Sarsaparilla,</HI> and several other Plants of great vertue, grow Naturally in this <HI>Province.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> The <HI>Western-Part</HI> of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> situate upon the <HI>River of Delaware,</HI> (to the Head whereof I understand Mr. <HI>Billing</HI>'s Grant reaches) so far as I know, is not Second to any Part of <HI>America</HI>; and, in due time, by such Industrious Undertakers as Your Self, and <HI>Friends</HI> are, may not be Inferior to many Parts of the World: And this I further know, that with Common and Reasonable Care,
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
there may not (in a few Years) only be to spare <HI>Horses, Beef, Pork, Flower, Bisket, Pease,</HI> &amp;c. but this <HI>Country</HI> will also produce <HI>Honey, Wax, Silk, Hemp, Flax, Hops, Woad,</HI> and <HI>Rape-seed, Madder, Pot-Ashes, Anniseed,</HI> and <HI>Salt; Hides</HI> Raw or Tanned, and there is a vast large Creature call'd a <HI>Moose,</HI> of whose Skins are made Excellent <HI>Buff.</HI> and other <HI>Deer</HI>-Skins, and all sorts of <HI>Peltry</HI> in great Plenty; besides the Natural Product of <HI>Pitch, Tarr, Rosin, Tur∣pentine,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And, as for <HI>Furrs</HI>; there is <HI>Beaver, Black Fox, Otter,</HI> and divers other sorts: As also, the <HI>Tobacco</HI> is very Good upon the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Delaware.</HI> Besides what I have mentioned, there may be good Fish∣ing for <HI>Cod</HI> and <HI>Cusk,</HI> which are to be found on a Fishing-ground, from the <HI>South-Part</HI> of the <HI>Shoald,</HI> that lyes of <HI>Barnagate,</HI> beginning at Seven Fathom Water, and trending <HI>South</HI> and by <HI>West,</HI> Nine Leagues in Length; there being great Plenty of well grown <HI>Fish,</HI> as I my self, and several others have found by Experience.</P>
<P>Upon the whole Matter, this <HI>Province</HI> affords all that is either for Necessity, Convenience, Profit, or for the Pleasure of Humane Life.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> I have herewith sent you a <HI>Prophecy</HI> of Pious Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI>'s, a Man as Learned as Great in his Quality, being the Earl of <HI>Cher∣bury</HI>'s Brother, and <HI>Oratour</HI> to the University of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> writ∣ten many Years since.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THrough the Mercy of <HI>God,</HI> we are safely Arrived at <HI>New-Jer∣sey.</HI> My Wife, and all Mine are very well; and we have our Healths rather better <HI>Here,</HI> than we had in <HI>England</HI>: Indeed, the <HI>Country</HI> is so likely, that I do not see, how it can reasonably be found fault with. As far as I perceive, all of the Things we heard of it in <HI>England,</HI> are very true; and I wish, that many People (that are in Straits) in <HI>England,</HI> were <HI>Here: Here</HI> is Good Land enough lyes void, would serve many <HI>Thousands</HI> of Families; and we think, if they cannot Live <HI>Here,</HI> they can hardly Live in any Place in the World. But we do not desire to perswade any to come, but such as are well satisfied in their own Minds. A Town-Lot is laid out for us in <HI>Bur∣lington,</HI> which is a Convenient Place for a Trade: It is about <HI>One Hun∣dred</HI> and <HI>Fifty</HI> Miles up the <HI>River of Delaware.</HI> The <HI>Country,</HI> and <HI>Air,</HI> seems <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be very agreeable to our Bodies; and we have very Good Stomachs to our Victuals: And <HI>Here</HI> is plenty of Provision in the <HI>Country,</HI> plenty of <HI>Fish</HI> and <HI>Fowl,</HI> and Good <HI>Venison</HI> very plen∣tiful, and much better than Ours in <HI>England</HI>; for it eats not so dry, but is full of Gravy, like Fat Young <HI>Beef.</HI> You that come after us, need not fear the Trouble that We have had: For now <HI>here</HI> is Land ready divided against You come. The <HI>Indians</HI> are very Loving to Us, except here and there one, when they have gotten Strong Liquors in their Heads, which they now greatly love. But for the <HI>Country,</HI> in short, I like it very well: And I do believe, that this <HI>River of De∣laware,</HI> is as good a <HI>River</HI> as most is in the World; it exceeds the <HI>Ri∣ver of Thames</HI> by many Degrees.</P>
<P>Here is a <HI>Town</HI> laid out for <HI>Twenty Proprieties,</HI> and a strait Line drawn from the <HI>River</HI>-side up the Land; which is to be the main Street, and a Market-place about the Middle; and the <HI>York-shire Ten Proprietors</HI> are to build one Side, and the <HI>London Ten</HI> the other Side: And they have ordered one Street to be made along the <HI>Ri∣ver</HI>-side, which is not divided with the Rest, but in small Lots by it self; and every one that hath any Part in a Propriety, is to have his Share in it. The <HI>Town-Lots</HI> for every Propriety, will be

And now, my Dear, I know not how to write to thee, concerning thy Coming, or not coming <HI>Hither.</HI> The Place I like very well; and I do believe, that we may live <HI>Here</HI> very well.

<P>I Can now give you a farther Account concerning this <HI>Country</HI>; for I have Travelled <HI>Three</HI> or <HI>Four Hundred</HI> Miles an End, the best Part of it by Land. I have been in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and like that Place very well; and I am sure, it is the Fruitfullest Place in these Parts, and the Pleasantest to dwell in: For there is all sorts of Provision as plentiful as it is in <HI>England</HI>; There wants nothing but good Honest People to Inhabit it. The Ship that was bound for <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> arrived about the <HI>Second</HI> or <HI>Third</HI> Day of this Month; I was in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> when She came in; I was the First, that saw Her: So the next Day, I went Aboard of Her; and the People told me, They were <HI>Eight</HI> Weeks at Sea; and the first Land they made, was <HI>Cape-Codd</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> which was an <HI>Hundred Leagues</HI> out of their way: And they were at a great Loss for want of a <HI>Pilot</HI> to carry them along the Shore; but while they were at <HI>Sea,</HI> they wanted for nothing. Now I have seen most of these Parts hereabout; and, to my thinking, <HI>New-Jersey</HI> exceeds them All for good Land, good Timber, good Meadow, and other good Conveniences that are <HI>Here:</HI> For <HI>One</HI> Acre in this Place, is worth half a dozen in other Pla∣ces that lye <HI>Hereabouts</HI>; and I could be very glad, that You and Your Family were safe arrived <HI>Here.</HI> But, I hope, I shall see you all in <HI>London</HI> within these <HI>Three</HI> Months; and then I shall give you a better Account concerning our Affairs.

An Extract of a Letter written by <HI>John Crips,</HI> to his Brother and Sister.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear &amp; Loving Brother &amp; Sister!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received both your Letters, wherein I understand your Faith concerning this <HI>Country</HI> is much shaken through several false Re∣ports given thereof; which may be proved false under the <HI>hands</HI> of se∣veral good <HI>Friends,</HI> I hope as worthy to be believed as that Reporter; and such as have had more Experience of this Place, than he had or could have in so short a time. Besides, he came amongst us short∣ly after our coming hither, when things were not settl'd in that Or∣der amongst us as now they are. Neither indeed did he find such Entertainment from some, as he expected; which <HI>I</HI> suppose makes him speak the worst he can devise of this Place. But <HI>I</HI> question not, but his Reports will in a short time be wip'd away: Some of which, in my Knowledge, are gross Lyes, as well as Contradicti∣ons to his own VVords. For <HI>I</HI> remember, when <HI>I</HI> Travelled with him through Part of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> he confessed, That much of this Land was as good or better, than the Land in <HI>Road-Island.</HI></P>
<P>And it's really my judgment that those people that cannot be con∣tented with such a Country, and such Land as this is, they are not wor∣thy to come here. And this I can truly tell you if I were now in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> with you my Friends, (and which I should be very glad to see) yet if all <HI>I</HI> had in the World would but bring me hither, <HI>I</HI> should freely leave You, and my Native-Country, and come to <HI>New-Jer∣sey</HI> again; which <HI>I</HI> have said many a time heretofore; but now <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>
write it under my Hand; and it's really the Truth, whether you will believe it or not. And farther, <HI>I</HI> can truly tell you, That <HI>I</HI> desire not, nor dare not to write the least Untruth to draw you, or any others to this Place: But an resolved, if <HI>I</HI> never see your Face more, to leave you to your own Freedom in the <HI>Lord.</HI> But <HI>I</HI> hope, you are not insensible of my Love, and Desires for You; though <HI>I</HI> am (<HI>I</HI> say) constrain'd to Forbear perswading. You, or any one else, against their own Freedoms: yet <HI>I</HI> think it my Du∣ty to let You, and all Men know the Truth of things as near as <HI>I</HI> can.</P>
<P>Your Letter saith, it's reported, <HI>the water is not so good as in Eng∣land.</HI> I do not remember, that ever I tasted better water in any part of <HI>England,</HI> than the springs of this Place do yeild; of which is made very good <HI>bear,</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI>; And here is also <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Sider.</HI> And whereas your Letter to me saith, <HI>several have come back from this Country to England</HI>; Two or Three, I suppose, there are Lazy idle persons, that have done so. But on the other hand here are several persons, Men of Estates, that have been <HI>here,</HI> and have gone back to <HI>England,</HI> and sold their Estates, and return'd with their whole fami∣lies hither again; which methinks, should take many of these Scruples out of the way, if nothing else were said or done in praise of this <HI>Country.</HI> But, I suppose, there are many in <HI>England,</HI> that desire to hear ill of this Place, because they would keep their <HI>Friends</HI> there with them, and they think, we never write enough of the bad Pro∣perties of the <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Vermin</HI> in it. Now, this I may say in short, That here are <HI>Bears, Wolves, Foxes Rattle-snakes,</HI> and several other Creatures, (I do believe) because I see the <HI>Indians</HI> have such Skins to sell. But I have Travelled several <HI>hundreds</HI> of Miles to and fro, and I never (to my knowledge) saw one of those Creatures, ex∣cept two <HI>Rattle-snakes,</HI> and I kill'd them both. I suppose, the Fear of those Creatures in <HI>England,</HI> is far worse to some <HI>there,</HI> than the Hurt of them is <HI>here.</HI> And as for the <HI>Musketto-Fly,</HI> we are not troubled with them in this Place; our Land for the most part Lying high and healthy, and they for the most part are in Law Boggy ground. <HI>Thomas Budd,</HI> and his Family are arrived, the ship Lieth before this Town that brought them: I wish, you have not cause to repent, that you came not along with them. They had a very good Passage, and so had the <HI>London Ship</HI>; they are both in the Ri∣ver at this time. I understand by <HI>Thomas Budd,</HI> that he did satis∣fie you as near as he could, of the Truth of things <HI>here</HI>; and you had
<PB N="17" REF="9"/>
as much reason to believe him, as that other person, and more too; for <HI>Thomas</HI> had far more Experience of this Place, than he (I say) could have in the short time he was among us. So of these things, I shall forbear to write any farther at present; and with my true love to you all, my <HI>Friends,</HI> with my hearts Desire for your Well∣fare every way, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I rest</P>

<P>I Received thine by <HI>Henry Salter,</HI> but it came too late to my hand; so that I could not write any thing in answer untill this time. I un∣derstand thou would'st know something from me concerning <HI>New-Jer∣sey,</HI> which indeed I had given thee a large account of, without thy desiring only <HI>Joseph Hempsley</HI> satisfied me, that he had done it. Let every Man write according to his Judgment; and this is Mine, con∣cerning this <HI>Country:</HI> I do really believe it to be as good a <HI>Coun∣try,</HI> as any Man need to dwell in; and it is much better than I ex∣pected every way. For Land I will assure thee, here is as good by the Judgment of Men, as any is in <HI>England.</HI> And for my part, I like the <HI>Country</HI> so well, and it is so Pleasant to me, that if I had a good Estate in Land in <HI>England,</HI> I should not come to live upon it: For through Industry, here will be all Things produced, that are ne∣cessary for a Family, as is in <HI>England</HI>; and far more easier, I am satisfyed. When I am walking alone, and the <HI>Lord</HI> is with me, and the Sense of His good Dealings is brought before me, I cannot but admire Him for His Mercies; and often in secret bless His Name,

that ever He turn'd my Face hitherward; and gave me Confidence in Himself, and Boldness by Faith to oppose all Gain-sayers, though never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o strong. Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough then I could not say, <HI>I</HI> had a Call or Com∣mand to leave the Land of my Nativity: Yet now of a Truth <HI>I</HI> can say, the <HI>Lord</HI> removed me there-from; and in what I did, <HI>I</HI> had Peace in Him. And in all my Exercises by <HI>Sea</HI> and <HI>Land,</HI> I never felt the least Matter in me, as to desire I had not come forward; but rather rejoyced in the <HI>Lord,</HI> in the midst of all. Though my Re∣moval was not ordinary, because of the Largeness of my Family; yet, blessed be the Name of the <HI>Lord,</HI> all is well to our Content. So if thou heedest every ones Sayings, thou wilt have work enough: I heeded none, but the <HI>Lord.</HI> My Resolution was, and my Sayings to several O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>posers, That I would come; if <HI>God</HI> hindered me not, no Man should▪ I have writ about the 26<HI>th.</HI> of the 9<HI>th.</HI> Month, to <HI>John Mulliner,</HI> and <HI>Edward Cooper,</HI> largely, concerning the <HI>Country</HI>; thou maist write to them to have a Copy of it, if it comes to hand before This, which I something question.</P>
<P>And now, my Dear Friends, and Antient Acquaintance (<HI>William,</HI> and <HI>Sarah Biddle</HI>) My Love you may feel beyond Expression. And if you have Clearness to come to <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> let nothing hinder; but if you have a Stop upon your Spirits, let not any thing farther you, until the <HI>Lord</HI> clears your Way. In this my Writing, I do as∣sure you, I deny my self; for, if <HI>I</HI> might, <HI>I</HI> should write to for∣ward you; but <HI>I</HI> dare not. Though you may understand by my Letters, how it is with Me and Mine, and many Others; <HI>I</HI> know, if a Man cannot Live here, <HI>I</HI> do believe he can hardly live in any Place in the World. This being the Place set before Me of the <HI>Lord,</HI> and if He gives Length of Dayes, <HI>I</HI> will see what He will afford me in it. The last Ship that came to <HI>New-York,</HI> brought several Pas∣sengers; some of which came to see this <HI>Country,</HI> and liked it well.

<P>BUt now a word, or two of those strange Reports you have of Us, and our <HI>Country</HI>; I affirm, they are Lyes in the very Ground of them, and spoken from a Spirit of Envy: It is a <HI>Country,</HI> that produceth all things for the Support, and Sustenance of Man, in a

plentiful manner. If it were not so, <HI>I</HI> should be ashamed of what <HI>I</HI> have before written: But <HI>I</HI> can stand, having Truth on my Side, against and before the Face of all Gain-sayers, and evil Spies. <HI>I</HI> have Travelled through most of the Places that are settled, and some that are not; and in every Place, <HI>I</HI> find the <HI>Country</HI> very apt to answer the Expectation of the Diligent. <HI>I</HI> have seen <HI>Orchards</HI> so loaden with <HI>Fruit, I</HI> have wondered to see it, their very Limbs torn in pieces with the weight of their <HI>Fruit</HI>; and most Delicious to the Taste, and Lovely to behold. <HI>I</HI> have seen an <HI>Apple-Tree</HI> from a <HI>Pippin-Kernel,</HI> yield a Barrel of curious <HI>Syder</HI>; and <HI>Peaches</HI> in such plen∣ty, that some People took their Carts a <HI>Peach</HI>-gathering: <HI>I</HI> could not but smile at the Conceit of it. They are a very delicate <HI>Fruit,</HI> and hang almost like our <HI>Onions</HI> that are tyed on Ropes. <HI>I</HI> have seen and known this <HI>Summer Forty</HI> Bushels of good <HI>Bold-Wheat,</HI> of <HI>One</HI> Bushel sown: And many more such Instances <HI>I</HI> could bring, which would be too tedious here to mention. We have from the Times call'd <HI>May</HI> until <HI>Michaelmals,</HI> great store of very good <HI>Wild-Fruit</HI>; as <HI>Strawberries, Cramberries,</HI> &amp; <HI>Huckle-berries,</HI> which are like our <HI>Bil∣berries</HI> in <HI>England</HI>; but far sweeter: They are very wholsome <HI>Fruits</HI>; the <HI>Cramberries</HI> much like <HI>Cherries</HI> for Colour and Bigness, which may be kept till <HI>Fruit</HI> come in again; an Excellent Sauce is made of them for <HI>Venison, Turkies,</HI> and other great <HI>Fowles</HI>; and they are better to make Tarts, than either <HI>Gooseberries,</HI> or <HI>Cherries:</HI> We have them brought to our Houses, by the <HI>Indians,</HI> in great plenty. My Brother <HI>Robert</HI> had as many <HI>Cherries</HI> this Year, as would have loaded several Carts. It is my Judgment, by what <HI>I</HI> have observed, That <HI>Fruit-Trees</HI> in this <HI>Country</HI> destroy themselves, by the very Weight of their <HI>Fruit.</HI> As for <HI>Venison,</HI> and <HI>Fowles,</HI> here are great plenty: We have brought Home to our Houses by the <HI>Indians, Seven</HI> or <HI>Eight</HI> Fat <HI>Bucks</HI> of a day; and sometimes put by as many, having no Occasion for them. And <HI>Fish</HI> in their Season very plenteous: My Cousin <HI>Revill,</HI> and <HI>I,</HI> with some of my Men, went last <HI>Third</HI> Moneth called <HI>May,</HI> into the <HI>River</HI> to catch <HI>Herrings</HI>; for at that time they come in great Shoals into the Shal∣low's; we had neither Rod, nor Net; but after the <HI>Indian</HI> Fashion, made a round Pinfold about <HI>Two Yards</HI> over, and a Foot high; but left a Gap for the <HI>Fish</HI> to go in at, and made a Bush to lay in the Gap to keep the <HI>Fish</HI> in▪ and when that was done, we took <HI>Two</HI> long Birches &amp; tyed their Tops together; &amp; went about a Stones-cast above our said Pinfold: Then hauling these Birche's Boughs down
<PB N="23" REF="12"/>
the Stream, where we drove <HI>Thousands</HI> before us: But so many got into our Trap as it would hold; and then we began to haul them to Shoar, as fast as <HI>Three</HI> or <HI>Four</HI> of us could, by <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three</HI> at a time: And after this manner, in half an Hour, we could have fil∣led a <HI>Three-Bushel</HI> Sack of as good and large <HI>Herrings,</HI> as over <HI>I</HI> saw. And as to <HI>Beef</HI> and <HI>Pork,</HI> here is great plenty of it, and good cheap; and also, good <HI>Sheep:</HI> The common Grass of this <HI>Country</HI> feeds <HI>Beef</HI> very Fat; <HI>I</HI> have Kill'd <HI>Two</HI> this Year; and therefore, <HI>I</HI> have reason to know: Besides, <HI>I</HI> have seen this <HI>Fall,</HI> in <HI>Burling∣ton,</HI> Kill'd <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine</HI> Fat <HI>Oxen</HI> and <HI>Cowes</HI> on a Market-Day, and all very fat. And though <HI>I</HI> speak of <HI>Herrings</HI> only, and lest any should think we have little other sorts, we have great plenty of most sorts of <HI>Fish,</HI> that ever <HI>I</HI> saw in <HI>England</HI>; besides several other sorts that are not known <HI>There</HI>; as <HI>Rocks, Cat-Fish, Shoads, Sheep-Heads, Sturgeons:</HI> And <HI>Fowles</HI> plenty; as <HI>Ducks, Geese, Turkies, Swans, Pheasants, Partridges</HI>; and many other sorts that <HI>I</HI> cannot remember, and would be too tedious to mention▪ Indeed the <HI>Country,</HI> take it as a <HI>Wilderness,</HI> is a brave <HI>Country</HI>; Though no Place will please all; but some will be ready to say, <HI>He writes of Conveniences, but not of Inconveniences:</HI> In answer to those, <HI>I</HI> honest∣ly declare, Here is also some Barren Land; as (<HI>I</HI> suppose) there is in most Places of the World; and more Wood, than some would have upon their Lands. Neither will the <HI>Country</HI> produce Corn without Labour, nor Cattle be got without something to buy them, nor Bread with Idleness; else it would be a brave Country indeed: And <HI>I</HI> question not, but that all then would give it a good Word. For my part, <HI>I</HI> like it so well, that <HI>I</HI> never had the least Thought of returning to <HI>England,</HI> except on the Account of Trade.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis may give you an Account of Mine, and my Families safe Ar∣rival in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> with all the Rest that came forth with us: I might say something concerning our Passage at <HI>Sea</HI>; but I wave it for want of Time: and, in fine, can say all was well; for which, I bless <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Lord</HI> keep us all sensible of it, with the rest of His Mercies for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Friends!</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>Six</HI> Weeks since, we arrived in <HI>Delaware-River</HI>; where I expected to have met with a Combat in the Denyal of <HI>Customs.</HI> In our Passage at <HI>Sea,</HI> I had communicated to all, that had any con∣siderable <HI>Cargoe</HI> on Board, the Opinion of <HI>Council</HI> concerning the illegal Demand thereof, with what else I thought might be for their Information; which thus far prevailed, that most, if not all con∣cerned, seemed resolved to deny the Paying of <HI>Custom</HI> here, having paid all the <HI>King</HI>'s Duties in <HI>England.</HI> In good time we came to Anchor in <HI>Delaware</HI>; where one <HI>Peter Alrick</HI> came Aboard to us, and brought a <HI>Handsome Present</HI> to our <HI>Commander,</HI> and sent for me into the <HI>Round-House,</HI> where They both were; and <HI>Peter</HI> told me, He had nothing to say to Us, re∣lating to <NOTE N="†" PLACE="inter"><HI>This</HI> Peter Al∣rick <HI>was the Per∣son that formerly used to Collect the Customs.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Customs</HI>; he had no Commission for it, nor did he know of any Body that had. So we had all our Goods safely Landed, after this unexpected easie man∣ner.</P>
<P><HI>[But a Letter was writ by Sir <HI>John Werden;</HI> declaring, That the Customes were taken off, and the Port for ever made Free, and the Government settled.]</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friends,</HI> In pursuance of the Trust committed to me, after my Arrival, I acquainted those nominated in the Commission with me of it: But, in a short time after, I received Your Letters, giving an Account of a New Grant obtained, wherein the <HI>Customs</HI> are taken off,
<PB N="26" REF="14"/>
a Free <HI>Port</HI> confirmed, and the <HI>Government</HI> settled on <HI>Edward Bil∣linge</HI>; the which, I doubt not, will be very acceptable to every Ho∣nest Man. But, as yet, I have not had time to let the People, in general, know it. And now, seeing the <HI>Ports</HI> are made legally Free, and the <HI>Govornment</HI> settled, I would not have any thing to remain, as a Discouragement to <HI>Planters.</HI> Here are several good and con∣venient Settlements already; and here is <HI>Land</HI> enough, and Good e∣nough, for many more. I shall give a farther Account of all Things as Opportunity presents; I cannot do it now, the Messenger being in such haste, which forceth me to a Conclusion.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter wrote to Mr. <HI>Edward Billinge,</HI> Governor of <HI>West-New-Jersey.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOw, that illegal Imposition of <HI>Customs</HI> is taken off, the <HI>Port</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> made free, and the <HI>Government</HI> thereof settled on Your Self; I may honestly affirm. That the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>South Western-Parts</HI> of <HI>New-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersey,</HI> lying on the <HI>Sea</HI> &amp; <HI>Delaware-River,</HI> maybe made one of the <HI>Best Colonies</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> for the Situation, Air, and Soyl, Ports and Creeks, for good <HI>Harbors</HI> and <HI>Havens,</HI> are not inferior to any; but as Good and <HI>Better,</HI> than most in these Parts of the World; having not sewer than <HI>Thirty Navigable Creeks,</HI> ranging themselves at convenient Distance upon the Sea, and that most state∣ly River of <HI>Delaware</HI>; some flowing <HI>Five,</HI> some <HI>Eight,</HI> some <HI>Ten,</HI> some <HI>Fifteen</HI> or <HI>Twenty</HI> Miles up into the <HI>Country:</HI> And not one of these Creeks, but is a good Situation for a Town both for <HI>Trade</HI> &amp; <HI>Delight.</HI> Neither wants the <HI>Inland-Country</HI> great Plenty of <HI>Delightful Fresh Rivers,</HI> and most delicate Springs in abundance. And yet it is not these Springs and Rivers, Creeks and Ports alone, that makes <HI>New-Jersey</HI> exceed most of her Neighbours for Situation, and Healthy∣ness of Air; but the general Boldness of her Shoars, with the Na∣tural Ascent, or Gradual Rising of the <HI>Land</HI> from the <HI>South Sea</HI> to the utmost, or extream Points of its most <HI>Northerly</HI> Extent; which from <HI>South</HI> to <HI>North,</HI> (that is to say, from the Mouth to the
<PB N="27" REF="14"/>
Head of that never-too-often to be mentioned goodly <HI>River</HI> of <HI>De∣laware</HI>) is about <HI>Two Hundred</HI> and <HI>Fifty</HI> Miles; at whose large expanded Mouth, begins the Separation betwixt <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and <HI>Mary-Land</HI>; and about <HI>Eighty</HI> Miles farther up, in a more contra∣cted manner gently divide betwixt <HI>You,</HI> &amp; a very good Tract of Land; the which, if settled with good Neighbours, and under a right Au∣thority, would be vastly Advantageous to Yours both in Commerce and Defence: For that there being already a pretty considerable quantity of <HI>Swedes, Finlanders,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> seated on that Tract of <HI>Land</HI> along by the <HI>River</HI>-side; and who, through a good <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> over them, in time may become very good Neighbours; at least, much better than at present they are.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Sir,</HI> I think it was highly your Advantage, that you found few or no Inhabitants settled in <HI>New-Jersey</HI>; so that you had none to new-mold, displace, or remove, contend or quarrel with: None being seated, or to settle there, but by mutual Concessions, and a Grant for their <HI>Land,</HI> first had and obtained under Hand and Seal. And likewise, before you sat down in any Part of the <HI>Country,</HI> your giving Order to buy the <HI>Lands</HI> of the <HI>Natives,</HI> and give them real Satisfaction for the same, was a most Christian and Prudent Act; and by which means you are assured of their Love, and Friend∣ship for ever: And the <HI>Poor Creatures</HI> are never the Worse, but much the Better, as Themselves do confess; being now supplyed by the <HI>English,</HI> in the way of Truck and Trade, with whatsoever they want or stand need of. And they Hunt and Fish, as here-to-fore, except in Enclosed or Planted Ground.</P>
<P>But it may be demanded, Why these <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> especi∣ally some of the <HI>English</HI> that came lately, should seat on the Other Side of the <HI>River,</HI> rather than in <HI>New-Jersey?</HI> The only Reason, as a Reason, that I can give, was because of the Custome impo∣sed at <HI>New-Jersey</HI> heretofore, and the Government not being settled, as now it is.</P>
<P>And moreover, the Land on the other side next the <HI>River</HI> (upon which these People are set down) for the most part is a deeper Soyl, and less Wood upon it, than upon some of the Land on your side over against it; for that much of the richest Soil and best Land in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> lyeth not upon the very Brink of the <HI>River,</HI> but somewhat back∣ward into the <HI>Country</HI>; which is a conveniency of no small value to such Planters, who truly understand the erecting, and settling of <HI>Co∣lony</HI>'s next the Water-side in these Parts. For it is the heighth of
<PB N="28" REF="15"/>
the Land and Shoar's, and not the miry depth of the Soil, that makes <HI>Burlington,</HI> and the many Miles above and below it (where are many good Settlements besides) so wholsome an Air, and free from the <HI>Musuetto</HI>'s, <HI>Agnes, Feavors,</HI> &amp;c. And although I say the Soyl be not so deep on <HI>Jersey</HI> side next the <HI>River,</HI> yet I am sure there are as good <HI>Corns,</HI> and <HI>Fruits</HI> of all sorts, as ever I saw, or heard of in any of these parts of <HI>America.</HI> Likewise, <HI>Sir,</HI> I suppose you want not to know, by information, that the <HI>Rivers</HI> and <HI>Riv'lets</HI> I mentioned are abundantly plenish't with all the Kinds of the <HI>Fish</HI> and <HI>Fowl</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and several that you have not, and much better. Also the Land breeds good <HI>Horses,</HI> good <HI>Sheep,</HI> and good <HI>Deer,</HI> and <HI>Swine</HI> in abundance, and as large <HI>Oxen,</HI> and <HI>Cowes</HI> as in any parts of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Flesh</HI> eats much better, especially the <HI>Pork</HI> and <HI>Venison.</HI> Sir, I make no question, but you have heard as much as all this, and a great deal more concerning the Situation, growth, and product of New <HI>Jersey</HI> (and which may truly be said.) But it is possible I may inform you of one particular, that you may not have minded, which is that this <HI>Country,</HI> being bounded on the <HI>West</HI> with <HI>De∣laware,</HI> on the <HI>South</HI> with the main <HI>Ocean,</HI> and on the <HI>East</HI> with <HI>Hud∣son's</HI> River; some of whose <HI>North-West</HI> Branches do almost shake hands with the most <HI>North-Easterly</HI> branches of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and in a man∣ner clasp the whole Province about, until they reduce it somewhat into the form of a blunt wedge, so that with a small charge (consider∣ing the advantage,) New <HI>Jersey</HI> from a <HI>Peninsula</HI> may be made an en∣tire <HI>Island.</HI> But however as it is, with the Methods you have ta∣ken for the setting thereof: for instance; that incomparable way of dividing the whole <HI>Country</HI> into a hundred propriety's (whereby eve∣ry individual Purchaser hath a share of the good, and the bad) is away so just and equal, that not any plantation in these parts at pre∣sent doth, or for the future in that point, can ever come near it, be∣cause of their promiscuous or confused settling at their first fitting down. And then as to Your Government (a free holder being An∣nually to be chosen out of each of these hundred proprieties, and as the Representatives thereof to fit, and freely Act in the Parliament, or general Assembly, where all grievances are to be heard and re∣dressed, and where all Laws (agreeable to those immutable funda∣mentals agreed on in your general concessions) for the inviolable preservation of liberty and property are to be made. All which, are such pristine and certain methods for maintaining the just right and equal utility of the whole Community, that I do not see the
<PB N="29" REF="15"/>
most Capricious can assign, wherein it is either faulty in exceeding, or deficient in falling short of the most Ancient true English, and best Christian Government in the World. Wherefore I am satisfied it will not now be long before <HI>New-Jersey</HI> be peopled.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Sir,</HI> since the Government thereof is settled in so Gene∣rous and Worthy a Hand as your own, at which I can assure you, very many Honest and Sober People in these Parts, as well as those more direct of your Own Way, greatly rejoyce, and fervently de∣sire to see you in <HI>America</HI>; but for ought I know, none more than doth,</P>

<P>THat <HI>Ocean Sea</HI> I take to be about one hundred &amp; sixty miles, and <HI>I</HI> find some broken Land, <HI>Isles</HI> and In-ters, and many small <HI>Isles,</HI> at

<HI>Eg-Harbor,</HI> but going to <HI>Delaware</HI>-bay by <HI>Cape May</HI> (which I under∣stand is very well set out in Captain (<HI>Powels</HI> Map) on that <HI>North-side,</HI> about five miles up within, is a <HI>Port</HI> or <HI>Road</HI> for any Ships called the <HI>Nook.</HI> And Twelve <HI>Leagues</HI> higher a little above the <HI>Bay</HI> and <HI>Bar,</HI> is the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Manteses,</HI> which hath Twenty miles on <HI>Charles River,</HI> and <HI>Thirty</HI> Miles running up a fair Navigable deep <HI>River</HI>; all a flat level of rich, fat, black Mold, which I think to be about 300000 Acres.</P>
<P>Next above, about Six Leagues, is a Fair deep River, Twelve Miles Navigable, where is Free stone. The next <HI>Asomoeches River.</HI> The next is <HI>Eriwomick</HI> a <HI>King</HI> of Forty men. And five miles a∣bove the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Ramock</HI>; and four miles higher the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Ax∣ion,</HI> And next to him Ten <HI>Leagues</HI> over Land and <HI>Inland King</HI> of <HI>Calcefar.</HI> And Six <HI>Leagues</HI> higher is a Creek call'd <HI>Mosilian</HI>; and then we come to the Falls, made by a Rock of Lime-stone; &amp; I suppose it is about Sixty five <HI>Leagues</HI> from the <HI>Sea,</HI> near to which is an <HI>Isle</HI> fit for a City, all Materials there on to <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ʋpon which I∣sle,</HI> Bur∣lington <HI>is now built.</HI></NOTE> build. And above the <HI>Falls</HI> the <HI>River-Fair</HI> and Navigable; as the <HI>Indians</HI> inform'd me, for I went but Ten Miles higher. I do account all the <HI>Indians</HI> to be about eight hun∣dred. I saw there an infinite Quantity of <HI>Bustands, Swans, Geese</HI> and <HI>Fowl,</HI> covering the shoars. As within Land, the like multitude of <HI>Pi∣geons,</HI> and store of <HI>Turkeys</HI>; of which I tryed one to weigh Forty Six pounds. There is much variety and plenty of delicate Fresh and <HI>Sea Fish,</HI> And <HI>Elks,</HI> and <HI>Dear</HI> that bring three young ones at a time And the woods are strewed many Months with <HI>Chesnuts, Wall-Nuts,</HI> and <HI>Mast</HI> of several sorts to feed them. The Barren grounds have four kinds of <HI>Grapes,</HI> and <HI>Mulberrys,</HI> with <HI>Ash, Elme,</HI> and the Tal∣est and greatest Pines, and <HI>Pich-Trees</HI> that I have seen. There are seve∣ral <HI>Wild Fruits</HI>; as the pine <HI>Aple,</HI> the dainty <HI>Parsemenas, &amp;c.</HI> I shall en∣treat you to believe me as a Gentleman and a Christian, I write no∣thing but the truth.</P>
