GRAND TARTAR CHAM,
OR
Emperor of China,
Delivered at PEKING the Imperial City, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> were a People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The severe Laws of the <HI>Lacedaemoni∣ans.</HI></NOTE> who by their Laws
and Customs were strictly prohibited from Travel∣ling
out of their own Countrey, lest so degenerating
in Manners, (as they supposed) they might fall into
a more loose and irregular course of Life, and by the
acquaintance of the various Modes of several forein
Nations, slight the strictness of their own severer
Establishments.</P>
<P>Neither would they permit that any Strangers should reside amongst
them, lest they by Conversation should be imbu'd with their Novelties and
Opinions. Which more to strengthen, What Citizen soever that did not
Educate his Children according to their own setled Laws, was immediately
pronounced incapable of the Priviledges belonging to his Countrey. So great
a love had this Nation to their native Soil, and such the aversion engraffed in
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
them from their very Cradles to forein Parts, that a Youth onely once asking
the Way to <HI>Pilea,</HI> by order of the Magistracy suffer'd condign Punishment
presently upon the Spot.</P>
<P>But these severer ways and starch'd Formalities were, both by the other
<HI>Greeks</HI> and the <HI>Romans,</HI> utterly exploded, who knowing better things, readily
indulged Licence to Travel where they might best improve their Wealth, Li∣terature,
or Observation. And also we find by their most ancient and accurate
Writers, that they neither spared Cost, Study, nor Pains, to be replenished
with remote and transmarine Imbellishments, both of Arts, Science, and
Industry.</P>
<P>When the Emperor <HI>Trajan,</HI> after the <HI>Parthian</HI> War, busied himself in a Phi∣losophical
Inquisition concerning the Wonders of the Deep, and occult Na∣ture
of the Ocean, a sudden Storm happening, hurried him from Coasting
far into the <HI>Offin,</HI> where he beheld a Fleet standing in for <HI>India;</HI> whereof be∣ing
inform'd, he fetching a deep Sigh, said, <HI>Ah that I were young again, and could
resume my former vigour, then would I visit those distant Regions, and penetrate the Ave∣nues
of the Oriental World.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Mithridates,</HI> who after a long Contest with the <HI>Romans,</HI> having re∣setled
himself in his Throne, resolved not onely upon the well managing of the
Affairs at home, but the enlarging his Dominions abroad; whereupon he
made himself Master (of which not any Prince had done before) of the neigh∣boring
<HI>Scythians,</HI> who had never till then been absolutely subdu'd. This great
Work finish'd, and so mighty a Nation brought under, he diverted himself
to Travel, not onely to make a superficial view of Cities and Situations, Vul∣garities
and various Humors adherent to several Nations, but also of their
Scolastick Knowledge, and Politick Governments: on which account he
pass'd through all <HI>Pontus, Cappadocia,</HI> and most Parts of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tacitus,</HI> the famous <HI>Roman</HI> Historian, enumerating the many Vertues of
<HI>Germanicus,</HI> says, That he, greedy of Knowledge, especially of forein Trans∣actions,
made his Tour through <HI>Greece, Thrace, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Armenia:</HI> but thus
much not satisfying the Curiosity of this Prince, he Voyaged into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> un∣der
pretence of setling the Government of that Kingdom, but rather of having
a visual Speculation of the Antiquities reported to be there.</P>
<P><HI>Democritus</HI> no less sollicitous of making search beyond his own Home, after
the Death of his Father <HI>Damasippus,</HI> parted with a no unplentiful Patrimony
for a scarce considerable Sum, to furnish out the Expences of his outward∣bound
Travels in quest of Science; he first address'd himself to the <HI>Aegyp∣tian</HI>
Priests, next the <HI>Chaldaeans,</HI> after to the <HI>Gymnosophists</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> from whose
Magazines, and the then Fountains of Learning, he returned rich, being
Freighted with a full <HI>Cargo</HI> both of Divine and Moral Principles.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Plato,</HI> Prince of Philosophers, stand for all, who in like manner pene∣trated
the Bowels of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and other more distant Countreys, returning as
plentifully furnished with their several Observations an Acquirements.</P>
<P>Inclinations no less vigorous have of late been observed in <HI>Europe,</HI> but with
more success; who not being bounded by <HI>Herculean</HI> Bars, pass'd so far through
the (till then) unmeasured <HI>Atlantick,</HI> that they lighted upon a new World, a
flourishing <HI>Hesperides,</HI> Regions whose Sands were Gold, Earth Plate, and
Rivers Silver, a Paradice extended to the <HI>Arctick</HI> and <HI>Antarctick</HI> Circles, with
several other Countreys and Islands, that reach almost the utmost latitude of
either Poles, out-shining all the Fables of Antiquity, and boldest Tales of
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
their Poetick Dreams; so that the Ancients are not to stand in competition
with our modern Discoverers, who found out in less than one Century, more
than they in their many thousand years.</P>
<P>Whilst I contemplated the laudable Actions and great Enterprises of fa∣mous
Navigators, I conceiv'd my self oblig'd to put in my Mite, and not to
conceal some special Remarks, being taken by me with no small Care and
Pains, in a Countrey as little known to <HI>Europe</HI> as any.</P>
<P>After my Return from the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> where I had sometime remained, my
Occasions invited me from Home (a contrary Course) to the <HI>East-Indies;</HI>
where, not long after my arrival at <HI>Batavia,</HI> it was order'd by the General
<HI>Maatzuyker,</HI> and the Honorable Council then residing there, to send <HI>Peter de
Goyer,</HI> and <HI>Iacob Keysar</HI> as Ambassadors, with Credentials, and a considerable
Train of Attendants, to <HI>Peking</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> to the <HI>Grand Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> the now
Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> impowering to Negotiate concerning a free and mutual
Commerce with them in his Kingdoms and Territories.</P>
<P>Whereupon receiving also Commands to attend this Embassy, I had
thrown into my hands (as I conceived) fit opportunity to make a more exact
Discovery of the <HI>Genius</HI> and Manners of the People, and Customs of the Place,
and Countreys supposed by all Geographers to be the richest in the World,
and where any Stranger formerly durst never attempt. And herein (without
breach of Modesty) I dare boldly affirm, that nothing considerable slipt my
observation relating to my Design, and that in taking accurate Maps and
Sketches, not onely of the Countreys and Towns, but also of Beasts, Birds,
Fishes, and Plants, and other Rarities never divulged (as I am informed) here∣tofore.</P>
<P>But now to remove some Obstructions, and to clear the way, that Poste∣rity
may not be bereav'd of the Fruit of these my Endeavors, I find my self
highly necessitated to relate what passed in this Undertaking, with as much
candour and brevity as the Work may possibly require.</P>
<P>But before I engage my self, it seems also not amiss to set forth briefly the
Division of the universal Globe, and likewise the Etymology or Derivation
of the word <HI>China,</HI> the Condition of the Soil, and the Extent thereof, and
lastly the ten Provinces of the fifteen into which that County divides it self,
and the Towns and Cities through which we did not pass.</P>
<P>The Terraqueous Globe comprehending Sea and Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Division of the Globe.</NOTE> Rivers and Lakes,
stands divided by modern Geographers into two Semi-Orbs, <HI>viz.</HI> the Old and
New World: The Old contains <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI> the New, <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI>
not much less in Extent to all those vast Regions discovered before;
named so from <HI>Americus Vesputius</HI> a <HI>Florentine,</HI> but indeed first found out by
<HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> a <HI>Genoese,</HI> furnished out for so great an Expedition by <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI>
and <HI>Isabel</HI> King and Queen of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Aragon,</HI> in the Year 1492. But
five years after <HI>Americus</HI> Voyaging, made his Approaches higher into those
unknown Confines, and so got by a lucky Hit, or something in his Name,
the Honor of Denomination of the Moiety of the World from the prime
Discoverer, to whom so great a Glory belonged: since vulgarly called <HI>The
West-Indies,</HI> not improperly, the <HI>East</HI> being by Sea found by us about the same
time.</P>
<P>Under our new World may also be comprised those vast Southern Coasts
and Straights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> first lighted on by <HI>Ferdinandus Magellanus</HI> in the
Year 1520. in his Circumnavigation of the Universe; which forty five years
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
after Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and next Sir <HI>Thomas Bendish, Englishmen,</HI> made a farther
Inspection into; and in the Year 1600. <HI>Oliver van Noord</HI> a <HI>Hollander</HI> pass'd;
but of later years a <HI>Spaniard, Ferdinand de Quier,</HI> out-shot them all by a more
ample Discovery than all the former.</P>
<P><HI>Asia</HI> (not to make mention of any other Divisions of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Asia</HI> divided.</NOTE> being im∣pertinent
to the following Discourse) stands bounded on the North by the
<HI>Tartarick</HI> Sea, on the East with the great <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean called <HI>Eous,</HI> and on the
South with the same; on the West with the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph, and the Slip of
Land situated betwixt this Gulph and the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea; the Extent of
which from the <HI>Hellespont</HI> as far as <HI>Mallassa,</HI> the utmost Town of Traffick in
<HI>India,</HI> consists of 1300 <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles; the breadth from the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph to
the Cape of <HI>Tabin 1220 Dutch</HI> Miles.</P>
<P>All <HI>Asia,</HI> which the Ancients divide into <HI>Asia the Great,</HI> and <HI>Asia the Less,</HI> mo∣dern
Computors part into five Divisions; <HI>Persia,</HI> the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire, <HI>India,</HI> (to
which they cast in the adjacent Isles) <HI>Tartary,</HI> and <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>What concerns the Name of <HI>China,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Name of <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> or the farther part of <HI>Asia,</HI> much Time
and Pains have been spent and taken by several Historians both old and new,
as also by the Natives of the Countrey and Foreiners, to give the true Deri∣vation
thereof, and the several Names by which <HI>China</HI> has been formerly
call'd, to whom I shall refer my self to satisfie the curiosity of the Reader in
this particular.</P>
<P>That these are the People whom <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls <HI>Chineses,</HI> both the Constitu∣tion
of the Countrey, and the Name by which it is known at this time, may
suffice to prove the truth thereof: for that which in <HI>Spanish</HI> is writ <HI>China,</HI> in
<HI>Italian</HI> is called <HI>Cina,</HI> in <HI>High-Dutch Tschina,</HI> and in <HI>Low, Dutch</HI> and <HI>Latin, Sina.</HI>
The difference in the pronunciation of the word <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Sina</HI> betwixt us and
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> is not much; but in regard it falls somewhat hard to those Peo∣ple
to pronounce the <HI>Ch,</HI> they therefore make use of the <HI>Greek</HI> Letter χ. The
<HI>Tartars</HI> call this Kingdom <HI>Catay,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Mangin;</HI> but this Name ra∣ther
denotes the Inhabitants themselves then the Countrey: for <HI>Mangin</HI> signi∣fies
in their Language a wild and unciviliz'd People; and with this word the
<HI>Tartars</HI> often deride the <HI>Chineses.</HI> This Countrey was likewise formerly cal∣led
<HI>Catay</HI> by <HI>Marcus Panwelz</HI> a <HI>Venetian,</HI> who was the first Discoverer thereof in
part. But the most known Name by which that Kingdom is call'd at pre∣sent
by those of <HI>Europe,</HI> is <HI>China.</HI> The reason why that Kingdom has been
called by so many several Names, may be supposed to be this, from an anci∣ent
Custom observed amongst them, That whosoever gets the Sovereignty
over them, Presents the Kingdom with a new Name according to his pleasure.
Amongst the rest we read, that formerly this farther part of <HI>Asia,</HI> or <HI>China,</HI>
was called <HI>Thau, Yu, Tha, Sciam, Cheu,</HI> as also <HI>Han, Thau,</HI> which signifies
Boundless broad; <HI>Yu,</HI> Rest; <HI>Tha,</HI> Great; <HI>Sciam,</HI> Curious; <HI>Cheu,</HI> Perfect;
<HI>Han,</HI> The Milky-Way.</P>
<P>Long before the Conquest of <HI>China</HI> by the <HI>Tartars</HI> in their last Invasion, and
the Deposing of the Emperor of <HI>China, (viz.</HI> when the Sovereignty of the
Kingdom was in the Family of <HI>Ciu) China</HI> was called by the <HI>Chineses, Min,</HI>
which signifies <HI>Perspicuity</HI> or <HI>Brightness.</HI> Afterwards they added to the word
<HI>Min</HI> the syllable <HI>Ta,</HI> and called it then <HI>Tamin,</HI> or (as some write) <HI>Taming,</HI> which
signifies <HI>The Kingdom of great Brightness.</HI> For above 300 years this Kingdom
bore the Name of <HI>Tai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jven,</HI> and at this time is called by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who pos∣sess
the Kingdom under the <HI>Great Cham, Taicing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
But though this Kingdom of <HI>China</HI> doth often change its Lord and Name,
the <HI>Chineses</HI> however have Time out of mind called it by two other particular
Names, as <HI>Chungchoa,</HI> and <HI>Chungque;</HI> the first whereof signifies <HI>The Middle King∣dom,</HI>
and the other <HI>The Middle Garden.</HI> The reason why the <HI>Chineses</HI> gave their
Kingdom these Names, may be suppos'd to be this; in regard that formerly
they did verily believe that the Heaven was round, the Earth four-square, and
in the middle Point thereof lay their Kingdom. Wherefore when they first
saw the Maps of <HI>Europe,</HI> they took it very ill that their Kingdom was not pla∣ced
in the middle, but in the farther part of the East. And therefore when
<HI>Matthias Riccius</HI> a <HI>Iesuit,</HI> had in <HI>China</HI> made a Map of the whole World, he so
ordered his Adulation, that the Kingdom of <HI>China</HI> fell to be in the middle.
But most of the <HI>Chineses</HI> do now acknowledge this their great Error, and blush,
convinc'd of so much Ignorance. And though the <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves have
thus called their Kingdom by several Names (according as the Family which
Govern'd over them hapned to change) yet their Neighbors that live upon
the Confines take no notice of their Alterations, neither follow the <HI>Chineses</HI>
therein; for those of <HI>Couchenchina</HI> and <HI>Siam,</HI> call this Kingdom <HI>Cin;</HI> the Islan∣ders
of <HI>Iapan, Than;</HI> the <HI>Tartars, Han;</HI> and the <HI>Turks, Saraceners;</HI> and other
Western People, <HI>Cataium.</HI></P>
<P>Some conceive that this Name is originally from <HI>Sioni,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>China,</HI> whence so named.</NOTE> in respect <HI>Sina</HI> in
their Language signifies <HI>A most brave and famous Countrey.</HI> Others opposing,
will have this Kingdom to derive its Name from the Inhabitants of the City
<HI>Chincheu,</HI> because these People drive onely a constant Trade by Sea to most
Places of <HI>Asia;</HI> so that the <HI>Portugueses</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> by leaving out the same
Letters of the word <HI>Chincheu,</HI> might easily give it the Name of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>But those are in a very great Error, that will have the word <HI>China</HI> to be
derived from a certain word <HI>Cinch,</HI> which by the <HI>Chineses</HI> is very much us'd.
The falseness of this Assertion will clearly appear from hence, in that the <HI>Chi∣neses,</HI>
who Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Portugueses</HI> to those Places, and go with
their Ships to <HI>India,</HI> us'd on the score of Civility and kind Respect, to Greet
each other in their Mothers Tongue, not with the Name of <HI>Cinch,</HI> but <HI>Sia.</HI></P>
<P>Now that which appears to me to be a most probable Truth amongst the
various Opinions of Writers, is that which the Iesuit <HI>Martinus Martinii</HI> (a Man of great Learning and Skill in the Antiquities of <HI>China)</HI> has asserted in the
sixth Book of his History of <HI>China;</HI> the words whereof are as follow:</P>
<P>I shall not <HI>(says he)</HI> let this pass unmention'd, which seems to me most likely, That
not onely by the <HI>Indians,</HI> but also by Strangers, the Name <HI>China</HI> took rise and original
from the Generation, Family, or Branch of <HI>Cina,</HI> who Govern'd in <HI>China</HI> in the 246.
Year before the Birth <HI>of</HI> Christ: So that we ought not to call it <HI>China,</HI> but rather <HI>The
Kingdom of Sinen</HI> or <HI>Cinen:</HI> for in the time of those Kings which proceeded from this
Branch, the Name of <HI>Siners</HI> was first made known by Strangers, and especially by the
<HI>Indians.</HI> By the <HI>Indians</HI> the Name of <HI>China</HI> afterwards came into use, and was fol∣lowed
by the <HI>Portugueses</HI> after the Conquest of <HI>India:</HI> for this Family of <HI>Cina</HI> Go∣vern'd
over the greatest part of the <HI>Siners,</HI> who lived toward the West, and continually had
Wars with Foreiners: When afterwards the Court or Seat of the Kingdom was Planted
there, received the Name of <HI>The Kingdom of China.</HI> This Family of <HI>Cina</HI> being
risen to the highest pitch of all Prosperity, prov'd after a great Invader of others Territo∣ries;
insomuch that it seems no wonder that Strangers and remote Nations had the Name
of <HI>Cina</HI> so frequent among them. And though the <HI>Sineses</HI> call this farther part of <HI>Asia</HI> or
<HI>Cina</HI> by several Names, according to the Governing Families that happen to change, yet
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
however Foreiners do reserve the first Name which they heard. And this is my Opinion
concerning the Original of the Name <HI>Sina;</HI> and according to this Assertion, the first Let∣ter

<P>All <HI>China</HI> was formerly divided by the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor <HI>Xunus</HI> into 12 Pro∣vinces;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Division of <HI>China.</HI></NOTE>
afterwards the Emperor <HI>Yva,</HI> who took upon him the Government
after the Death of <HI>Xinus,</HI> about 260 years before the Incarnation of our <HI>Savi∣our,</HI>
reduced all <HI>China</HI> into nine Provinces, which onely at that time compre∣hended
the Northern Parts of <HI>China,</HI> and had for their Confines the River
<HI>Kiang.</HI> But after that they had Conquer'd the Southern Parts by degrees, and
somewhat Civiliz'd the Inhabitants, the whole Kingdom of <HI>China</HI> was divided
into 15 Provinces: Amongst these also they reckon the Province of <HI>Leaotung,</HI>
which is situated on the West of <HI>Peking,</HI> where the great Wall begins, and the
<HI>Hanging-Island</HI> of <HI>Corea;</HI> both which pay Tribute to the Emperor. There are
several other Islands beside, which pay also Tribute: amongst which the
Island <HI>Haman</HI> is the chiefest, lying in the Sea over against the Province of
<HI>Quangsi,</HI> Among the Islands which are Tributary to this Kingdom, is also ac∣counted
the Island <HI>Formosa,</HI> which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Lieukieu,</HI> and situated over
against the Province of <HI>Foken;</HI> and also the Island <HI>Cheuxan,</HI> over against the
Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> a very famous Place for Trading. But of this more at
large hereafter.</P>
<P>Six of the 15 Provinces verge upon the Sea, as <HI>Peking, Xantung, Kiangnan</HI>
or <HI>Nanking, Cheaiang, Foking,</HI> and <HI>Quantung.</HI> From hence toward the North lie
the Midland Countries, as <HI>Quangsi, Kiangsi, Huquang, Honan,</HI> and <HI>Xansi;</HI> and
toward the West the other four, <HI>Xensi, Sucheu, Queicheu,</HI> and <HI>Iunnan.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, this Empire which comprehends 15 Kingdoms, is also divided into
the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>North-China: South-China</HI> the <HI>Tartars</HI> call <HI>The Kingdom of Mangin,</HI>
and <HI>North-China, The Kingdom of Catay.</HI> In the first are nine Kingdoms, and in
the last six, or eight, if you will reckon amongst them the Kingdom of <HI>Leao∣tung,</HI>
and the <HI>Hanging-Island</HI> of <HI>Corea.</HI></P>
<P>By what has been already said, it doth clearly appear how far those are mi∣staken,
who write of another Empire beyond <HI>China,</HI> which they call <HI>Catay;</HI> as
likewise of several Towns, as <HI>Quinsey, Cambalu,</HI> and many other Fictions;
whereas in truth, beyond the great Wall no other People live but <HI>Tartars,</HI> who
have no fixed Abodes, but wander up and down the Countries in Wagons, and
so travel from Place to Place, as may be found at large in the Writings of those
who have sufficiently confuted this great Error and Mistake, as <HI>Virgantius,</HI> and
<HI>Martinus Martinii,</HI> in his <HI>Atlas</HI> of <HI>China.</HI> Amongst the rest, the <HI>Iesuits</HI> have like∣wise
found by experience, that beyond the Empire of <HI>China</HI> no Monarchy of
<HI>Catay</HI> is to be found; insomuch that the same People whom we call <HI>Chineses,</HI> are
by the <HI>Persians</HI> call'd <HI>Cataians.</HI> This same Mistake has been likewise sufficiently
and Learnedly confuted with undeniable Arguments, by the most Learned
<HI>Iacob Gool,</HI> a Person of extraordinary Knowledge in all Arts of Literature, and
especially in the Oriental Languages, and at present <HI>Arabick</HI> Professor in the
University of <HI>Leyden</HI> in his Appendix to the <HI>Atlas</HI> of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>China</HI> is so inclos'd with several Islands, and on the
East and South with Seas, that it seems almost to be four-square, onely two
great Mountains thrust themselves out toward the Sea, which in the <HI>Chinese</HI>
Language are called <HI>Tung.</HI> The one lies by the Town of <HI>Ningpo,</HI> from whence
you may Sail in 40 hours to the Island of <HI>Iapan:</HI> the other great Hill is in the
Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> near to the Town of <HI>Tengoheu.</HI></P>

<HI>China,</HI> situated in the farthest part of <HI>Asia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Situation</NOTE> borders toward the East, South,
and West, upon the great <HI>Indian</HI> Sea, and is call'd <HI>Tung</HI> by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which
signifies <HI>Easterly.</HI> And on the North it is separated from the Kingdoms of
<HI>Ninche</HI> and <HI>Nicolhan,</HI> by that Famous Wall which was made by those of <HI>China</HI>
against the Invasion of the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Higher up toward the North it has for
Frontiers the Kingdom of <HI>Taniju,</HI> and a Wilderness call'd <HI>Samo,</HI> which sepa∣rates
the North side of this <HI>China</HI> from the Kingdoms of <HI>Samahan</HI> and <HI>Cascar.</HI>
Upon the other Provinces situated toward the South, joyn the Kingdoms of
<HI>Prester-Iohn, Geo,</HI> (which by the <HI>Chineses</HI> are call'd by one common Name <HI>Si∣fan)</HI>
as also <HI>Tibet, Laos,</HI> and <HI>Mien.</HI> Likewise <HI>China</HI> reaches as far as <HI>Brangale,</HI>
and to some part of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and the Mountains of <HI>Damascus,</HI> which separates
it from <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>The furthest Extent of <HI>China</HI> (taken in the breadth) begins in the South up∣on
the Island <HI>Hainan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Extent.</NOTE> which lies in 18 Degrees Northern Latitude: from
thence it reaches toward the North to 42 Degrees; insomuch that <HI>China</HI> in
the breadth extends to 22 Degrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>990 English</HI> Miles.</NOTE> that is, 330 <HI>Dutch</HI> Leagues. Its length
begins in the Province of <HI>Iuunan,</HI> at 120 Degrees, and ends in the East at the
Mountain of the Town <HI>Ningpo,</HI> call'd by the <HI>Portugueses, Nampo,</HI> at 132 De∣grees:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1350 English</HI> Miles.</NOTE>
So that this Part consists of 450 Leagues in Longitude.</P>
<P><HI>China</HI> is not a little secure in regard of the adjacent Kingdoms, and the natural
and strong Forts whereby this Kings Realm stands so intirely protected against
all violence from without, that the like is hardly to be seen elsewhere; nei∣ther
are there any Avenues found leading to this Monarchy, insomuch that
it is so well provided and guarded, that it seems to be a World within it self,
and separated from all the rest, as well toward the South as East; and where
the Sea borders, it hath so many Islands, Banks, Flats, and blind Rocks, that
it is altogether unsafe to approach <HI>China</HI> on the side with any great Ships
of Men of War. On the West, and somewhat toward the South, lie the
Woods and Hills of <HI>Tamessus,</HI> which are so thick and high, that it is altoge∣ther
unpenetrable on that side, and which separate <HI>China</HI> from the next border∣ing
<HI>Asia,</HI> and the lesser neighboring Kingdoms; all which adds to the De∣fence
and Protection of this Empire. Toward the North and West it is also
sufficiently secur'd against all Invasions by the Sandy and dry Flats of <HI>Samo,</HI>
which endanger all Vessels that attempt any Landing in those Parts. Lastly,
this Kingdom has toward the North a great Wall, which the Family and
Branch of <HI>Cina</HI> built against the Invasion of the <HI>Tartars</HI> 215 Years before the
Birth of <HI>Christ;</HI> but in what condition this Wall is at present, and how far it
extends, we shall treat at large in the Description of the Province of <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>In respect the Sovereignty over the fifteen Kingdoms of this <HI>China</HI> belongs
at present to a Monarch, the <HI>Great Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> I shall give you an Ac∣count
of the number of all the great and little Cities situated in all these Do∣minions.</P>
<P>First of all, they sum up in this whole Empire 145 Capital Cities, which
out-shine the rest both in Greatness and Glory. Under the Command of this
Emperor are 1331 small Cities, amongst which 148 may be compared, in
Magnificence, Beauty, and People, with the chief Cities. Beside these, there
are 32 great Cities more, which are not subject to any other, yet they must
not bear the Name of Capital, though they Command over 36 small Cities.
Beside all these, there are 3 Cities more, for the Officers and Commanders of
the <HI>Militia</HI> to dwell in. The Forts and Castles are 159. beside which 17 great
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Garison Cities, and 66 small Garison Towns, which are never without full
Companies, and of Soldiers, who are permitted to inhabit promiscuously
amongst the Burgers.</P>
<P>There is no distinguishing by the greatness and largeness of the Cities, the
one from the other; for some of the small ones exceed some others of the
great and prime Cities, both in Largeness, Wealth, and People: but accord∣ing
to the Worth and Dignity of the Governors, and the Priviledges of the
Place, she bears the Precedency, and is reckon'd amongst the chief Cities.
No Place must presume to take up the Name of a City, but what is Wall'd
in; for every inferior Town or Situation subjects to the next adjacent Capi∣tal
City. Most of the Cities in <HI>China</HI> are built after one fashion and form,
commonly four-square, with broad and high Walls, adorn'd with quadruple
Towers, placed at an equal distance; round about which runs a deep Moat,
and that also is surrounded with a Mud or Earthen Wall. Each City has a
double Gate, and two double Doors, whereof the first stands directly over a∣gainst
the second, that there is no seeing through the last, though you stand in
the first: Betwixt these two Gates opens most commonly a large Court,
where they Discipline their <HI>Militia:</HI> Upon the Gates are likewise built great
Watch-Towers, where the Soldiers keep Night-Sentinel. Most of the Cities
have great Suburbs belonging to them, which are as full of People as within
the Wall. Without the Battlements each Metropolis hath a delightful Plain,
curiously adorned with Towers, Trees, and other Embellishments, most
pleasant to the Eye. The Country every where swarms with People, so that
wheresoever you Travel, you shall meet continually with Crowds of Men,
Women, and Children.</P>
<P>As now these 15 Kingdoms seem not onely to exceed all other Parts of the
World, for the number of most rare Edifices and rich Cities, so they are like∣wise
no less abounding in People: for the most populous Country of all
<HI>Europe</HI> stands not in competition with this.</P>
<P>Those that will take the pains to look into the <HI>Chinese</HI> Pole or Register-Books,
wherein is exactly set down the number of the People of each Pro∣vince
(except those of the Royal Family) will find that it amounts to the
number of 58 Millions, 9 hundred and 40 thousand, 2 hundred and 84 Per∣sons:
Neither need you wonder which way this can be made out; for every
Master of a Family is oblig'd upon a great Penalty to hang out a little Board
over his Door, upon which he must set down the number of his Houshold,
and their Condition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And to prevent all Fraud, one is appointed over
every tenth House, whom they call <HI>Titang,</HI> which signifies the Tenth-man, or
Tyther: His Office consists in taking an Account of the number of the Per∣sons
upon the Board; and if the Master of the Family fail to make that known
truly, he is to acquaint the Governor of the City with the Abuse.</P>
<P>Having spoken thus much of the Situation, Division, and Extent of <HI>China;</HI>
I shall add in short what these fifteen Provinces pay annually in Taxes one
with another; as also how many Capital, great, little, and Garison Cities are
in each of the Ten; and lastly, what each Province, Division, or Shire, dis∣burseth
yearly in Taxes to the Emperor of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>No Man possesses a Foot of Land in all this Empire, without paying to
the Emperor something out of it; so that we need not wonder, that over and
above the common Expences which are made upon the account of petty
Kings, Vice-Roys, and Military Officers, there are more then threescore Mil∣lions
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
of Crowns brought yearly into the Emperors Coffers, The whole Sum
amounts to 150 Millions of Crowns, whereof he cannot dispose as he pleaseth,
but the Money is brought into the Treasury; and if the King at any time de∣sires
a Supply, in writing to the Treasurer he is not to deny the payment of it.</P>
<P>The Provinces bring in yearly in Taxes 32 Millions 2 hundred 7 thousand
4 hundred and 47 Bags of Rice, and one Bag is enough to serve 100 Men for
one day; 40 hundred 9 thousand 9 hundred 49 Pounds of Raw Silk, 71 hun∣dred
2 thousand 4 hundred and 36 Rowls of Cloth made of Hemp, 36 thou∣sand
7 hundred and 70 Bales of Cottons, 1 hundred 91 thousand 7 hundred
and 30 Rowls of wrought Silk. But the City of <HI>Hucheu</HI> buys off this Tax
yearly for the Sum of 500 thousand Crowns.</P>
<P>The Provinces bring in likewise 1 Million 7 hundred 94 thousand 2 hun∣dred
and 61 Weight of Salt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Revenue by Taxes.</NOTE> each Weight is to be reckon'd at 1 hundred 24
Pounds, amounting in all to 1 hundred 87 Millions 6 hundred 88 thousand
3 hundred 64 Pounds; 32 Millions 4 hundred 18 thousand 6 hundred 27
Trusses of Hay and Straw for the Kings Stables, beside all other Taxes.</P>
<P>The other ten Provinces of <HI>China</HI> I did not see in my Iourney, yet however
I shall give you an Account of the Taxes which the great and lesser Cities
thereof pay yearly to the Emperor; their Names are these: <HI>Zansi,</HI> the se∣cond

<HEAD>The second Kingdom of Zansi.</HEAD>
<P>THis Province lies Westward of <HI>Peking,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Situation of <HI>Zansi.</HI></NOTE> and is neither so large nor popu∣lous,
but more Fruitful, and of more Antiquity, because (if credit
may be given to the Historians of <HI>China)</HI> the <HI>Chineses</HI> derive from hence their
first Rise and Original.</P>
<P>On the North this Province has for Confines the <HI>Great Wall,</HI> which reaches
from East to West through the whole Country; behind which lies the King∣dom
of <HI>Tamyn,</HI> and the Sandy Wilderness of <HI>Samo.</HI> The West side of this Pro∣vince
lies upon the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> which runs from North to South, and is sepa∣rated
by the same from the Province of <HI>Xensi.</HI></P>
<P>This Province produces the sweetest and fairest Grapes of all <HI>Asia;</HI> but
the <HI>Chineses</HI> make no Wine of them, but onely dry them, and so bring them to
the Market through all <HI>China.</HI> In this Country of <HI>Zansi</HI> (which is very re∣markable
and worthy of observation) are through the whole Country great
store of Fire-Wells, even in the same manner as the Water-Wells are in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
which they use for the dressing of Meat after this manner: the Mouth
of the Well is stopped very close, and onely a place left open to set the Pot up∣on,
by which means the Pot boyls without any trouble. This Province like∣wise
produces good store of Coal, which they dig out of the Hills, as in <HI>England,</HI>
and at <HI>Luyk</HI> in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> which serves the Inhabitants for Fewel, who
likewise use Stoves in their Houses, made after the manner of those in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>In this Country of <HI>Zansi</HI> are 5 Capital Cities, 92 small Cities, and several

<P>Want of Rain makes this Country very dry; but yet it produces great

feed all Winter upon Corn. It abounds with Sheep and Goats, which they
shear three times ayear, in the Spring, in Summer, and in Harvest; and of the
Wooll they make themselves Clothes. In this Countrey they make great store
of Musk, which grows in the Navel of a Beast not much unlike to a young

Hind; the Flesh whereof the <HI>Chineses</HI> eat as other Meat. When this Deer
goes to Rutting, the Cod swells like a Boil that is full of Matter; which Exu∣peration
consisting of a thin hairy Purse, is then taken out with all its precious
Stuff by the Natives. True it is, that all the Purses which are brought to us,
are not the right and pure Navels; for the cunning <HI>Chineses</HI> know very well
when they empty the Purse, how to fill up the same again with counterfeit
Musk. There is likewise Gold found in this Country, which is not fetch'd

<P>Thus far having treated (though but briefly) of that which at first I pro∣pos'd
for the better understanding the Relation of our Voyage, I now pro∣ceed
to give an Account of what passd during our Travels to and again from
<HI>Canton</HI> to <HI>Peking.</HI> You must know, that the Chief Government at <HI>Batavia,</HI>
long before any thing was concluded by the <HI>East-India Company</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> con∣cerning
an Embassy to the <HI>Great Cham</HI> at <HI>Peking,</HI> did send some Persons with
laden Ships to <HI>China,</HI> to desire free Traffick in those Parts; therefore I sup∣pose
it will not be amiss, to relate in short what Success they met withal in
their Voyages.</P>
<P>From the time that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had Commerce with their Ships into
several Parts of <HI>India,</HI> they continually sought unto the People of <HI>China</HI> to
Trade with them upon the Island of <HI>Iapan,</HI> in such Wares and Commodities
as the Country of <HI>China</HI> produces: but in this their fair Undertaking and rea∣sonable
Request, they have still met with Opposition, and no Access would be
given them into that Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Some impute the cause of this aversion in those People to the</HI> Hollan∣ders,
<HI>to an old Prophesie, which made no small impression on their Fan∣cies,</HI>
That a strange Nation, Fair of Complexion, and Clothed all over, should come
thither from a far remote Country, to Conquer the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> and possess it
as their own.</P>
<P>But in process of time, the Iesuit <HI>Martin Martinsen,</HI> who had conceal'd himself
ten years together in <HI>China</HI> for the propagation of the <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Faith,
came from <HI>Macassar</HI> to <HI>Batavia</HI> in a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vessel; and there related, How
that the <HI>Great Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary</HI> had Conquer'd the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and all the
Kingdoms belonging thereunto, with the slaughter of some hundred thou∣sands
of People, and had proclaim'd a Free Trade in the City of <HI>Canton</HI> to all
Foreign People.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="14"/>
Hereupon it was concluded by the chief Government of <HI>Batavia,</HI> after due
Deliberation first had, that a Trial should be made of the truth of this Re∣port,
by sending a Vessel with several Goods from the Island of <HI>Taiwan</HI> to some
part of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>So upon the 20. of <HI>August</HI> Mr. <HI>Frederick Schedel</HI> a Merchant, set Sail in the
good Ship call'd <HI>The Brown-Fish,</HI> very richly Freighted with all sorts of Mer∣chandizes
from <HI>Taiwan</HI> to <HI>Canton,</HI> and after nine days Sail Landed in the <HI>Canton</HI>
River, at a Place call'd <HI>Heytamon.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon the Mandorin <HI>Haitonu,</HI> Admiral of the Sea, came Aboard their
Vessel, to receive and Salute <HI>Frederick Schedel,</HI> in the Name and in behalf of the
whole <HI>Canton</HI> Magistracy. After that he had been well Treated the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, he took
leave of Mr. <HI>Schedel,</HI> who out of Respect to his Person, thought good to ac∣company
him on Shore; but being come near the City, he Landed in great
State, without speaking one word to <HI>Schedel,</HI> who was put into another Vessel
in a very slight manner, with the Presents which he had brought with him for
the Vice-Roys, and was carried to the other end of the City, where he was
narrowly searched by one <HI>Emanuel de Lucifierro</HI> a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and treated like∣wise
with ill Language. In the same manner he was us'd by some mean Of∣ficers,
who told him that they were sent by the Vice-Roy to shew him a Lodg∣ing
without the Walls in the Suburbs.</P>
<P>Toward Night came the Interpreter <HI>Tienqua</HI> (whom the same <HI>Haitonu</HI>
had brought with him Aboard) with several other <HI>Tartars,</HI> to give Mr. <HI>Sche∣del</HI>
a Visit, who after a while was carried by them to a Temple of one of
their Idol Gods, where the Priests had spent the whole Night at their Devo∣tions,
to foretel the Success of the Strangers Arrival. In the mean time whilst
<HI>Schedel</HI> was absent from his Lodging, some <HI>Mandorins</HI> came thither by Order
of the Vice-Roy, and made bold to open his Chests where the Presents lay;
and after they had taken an Account of them, they flung them about in a
scornful manner: they took likewise the Letter which was writ by the chief
Governor of <HI>Batavia</HI> to the two Vice-Roys, and were carrying it away; but
meeting with <HI>Schedel,</HI> they flung it unworthily in his Face, giving him re∣proachful
Language, as if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were come for no other end, but to
betray their Country. <HI>Schedel</HI> finding himself thus unhandsomly dealt with,
began to consider which way he should be able to pacifie and undeceive these
People: Among other Presents, he had brought with him some Bottles of
rare Wine, whereof he desir'd the <HI>Mandorins</HI> to taste; which pleasing their Pa∣lat,
they turn'd their Cups off very freely, and at last were so well satisfi'd with
<HI>Schedel,</HI> that they begg'd his Pardon for their Misdemeanor and Mistake; ac∣knowledging
that the <HI>Portugueses</HI> had infus'd strange Stories into their Heads
concerning the Plots of <HI>Hollanders</HI> against their Country; but now they
were full convinc'd, believing the contrary, excusing what had hapned, and
promis'd, that for the future all manner of Civility should be shew'd unto
him during his Abode there.</P>
<P>The next day early in the Morning by Sun-rising Mr. <HI>Schedel</HI> was suddenly
sent for to the Court, to appear before the ancient Vice-Roy <HI>Pignamong:</HI> thou∣sands
of the vulgar sort of People follow'd crowding at his Heels to the Pa∣lace
Gate, giving him ill Language, saying, <HI>How finely Iron Fetters would become
his Legs;</HI> others pointed at him with their Fingers in derision, and some
others blew Lice upon his Followers; however, at last two <HI>Mandorines</HI> brought
him to the Court: The Vice-Roy, to give him Audience, sat upon his
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>
Throne, which stood in the middle of the Palace upon a high four-square
place, and was cover'd with rich Silk: round about him stood above two
hundred Gentlemen (amongst which was the fore-mention'd <HI>Haitonu)</HI> all very
rich dress'd after the <HI>Tartar</HI> fashion. The Vice-Roy having receiv'd the Let∣ter
and the Presents from <HI>Schedel,</HI> and heard what he had to say for himself
against the Calumnies which had been rais'd against the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> he was so
well satisfi'd with him, that he caus'd him to sit down next unto his Throne
amongst the best of his Court, and afterwards invited him to a splendid Din∣ner,
made on purpose for his Entertainment; where a particular Table ap∣pointed
for <HI>Schedel</HI> and his Followers, was cover'd with thirty two Silver
Dishes, heap'd with all manner of extraordinary Dainties; the Cups in which
they drank were of massie Gold, and nothing was wanting to add to the great∣ness
of the Entertainment. During which, the Vice-Roy sent to Mr. <HI>Schedel</HI>
to resolve him several Questions, concerning the Condition and present Go∣vernment
of <HI>Holland;</HI> and after that he had fully answer'd the Vice-Roy, he
was dismissed by him with all manner of Respect, and conducted from thence
by the Mandorine <HI>Haitonou,</HI> with the Letter and Presents to the young <HI>Canton</HI>
Vice-Roy call'd <HI>signamong,</HI> who receiv'd him likewise very friendly, and ci∣villy
invited him to a Dinner, but yet seem'd to side rather with the <HI>Portu∣gueses.</HI></P>
<P>His Mother, who came out of <HI>Tartary</HI> the Year before, was very desirous
to see the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and sent for <HI>Schedel</HI> with his Followers (notwithstanding
that he was in the middle of his Speech) to appear before her: Whereupon
he brake off abruptly to go to her, and found her with her Gentlewomen in
an open Hall expecting his coming, where he was very courteously receiv'd
by her. During his stay there he commanded his Trumpets to sound, which
much delighted the Ladies, who shew'd him all manner of kindness for his
civility in that respect. After he had satisfi'd the curiosity of the Vice-Roy's
Mother, he return'd back to the Vice-Roy, who stay'd for him all this while.
Then he re-assum'd the former Discourse; which having ended, and taken
his leave to be gone, he was conducted in great State by <HI>Haitonu</HI> to the House
of the great Mandorine <HI>Teutang,</HI> who has the third Place in the Government
of <HI>Canton:</HI> But when this <HI>Teutang</HI> had privately taken a view of <HI>Schedel</HI> through
a Window, or the like, he suffer'd him to depart, without offering him the
least civility in his House, insomuch that he was forc'd to find out another
Lodging for himself and this Followers, where they lay that Night, and the
next Day sent for their Goods from Aboard their Ship.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor and Council in</HI> Maccoa, <HI>to stifle in its Birth the progress of
this Negotiation, did endeavor not onely to corrupt</HI> Haitonu <HI>with Presents and
contrary Arguments, but they sent likewise a considerable Embassy to</HI> Canton;
<HI>where they remontrated at large in Writing,</HI> How that the <HI>Portugueses</HI> in <HI>Mac∣coa</HI>
were inform'd, that a certain Forein Nation, known by the Name of <HI>Hollanders,</HI>
had sent away a Ship to the chief City of <HI>Canton,</HI> to desire free Traffick in <HI>China;</HI> but
they, as in Duty bound, did find themselves necessitated to acquaint the Governor, that
these People were of a cunning Nature, deceitful in all things, and without any Country or
Habitations of their own; And that they got their Livings by Stealth and Piracy; That
they by the number of their Ships and Guns, had made themsolves very considerable at Sea,
and were now onely endeavouring how to get sure Footing in <HI>China,</HI> that so by that means
they might the better enrich themselves; That they had taken <HI>Taiwan,</HI> had made an
Assault upon <HI>Manilba</HI> and <HI>Maccoa,</HI> and had also Block'd up <HI>Aunui</HI> with a Fleet.
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>
<HI>They likewise added,</HI> That these People were those, who about twenty three years
since appear'd with two Ships and great Presents in the Mouth of the River of <HI>Canton,</HI>
but the Magistrates of the Place, who were well acquainted with their Villanies, did wisely
refuse them; That they had totally destroy'd <HI>Heytaimon,</HI> and laid their Houses in Ashes,
and consequently no King in <HI>China</HI> would ever have any thing to do with them, since they
were held by all wise and knowing People as the ruine and plague of that Empire; That they
had made a Peace with the Pyrate <HI>Coxinga,</HI> and for that reason were to be look'd upon no
otherwise then as Enemies to the <HI>Tartar</HI> Crown. <HI>Last of all,</HI> They desir'd that this their
faithful Admonition might be taken in good part, as proceeding from a real and upright In∣clination
which they bore to the Empire.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Chinese <HI>Philosophers of</HI> Canton <HI>produc'd likewise to that end an old
Story, thereby to demonstrate,</HI> How that the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> time out of mind, were
never permitted to Traffick there, being always reputed to be deceitful in their Dealings;
wherefore they found themselves oblig'd to acquaint the Government therewith, that so they
might take the same into their serious Consideration.</P>
<P>But both the Vice-Roys, by advice of the said <HI>Haitonu,</HI> whom <HI>Schedel</HI> had
engag'd on their side, gave this Answer to their Proposals:</P>
<P>That their Majesties had quite another Opinion of this Business, and judg'd, that the
<HI>Holland</HI> Merchants would bring great Advantage and Profit to the Inhabitants of all
<HI>China,</HI> in regard that through the mutual Commerce of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth these People, the Defects of
the Country would be supply'd, and what was superfluous would be Exported, which must
necessarily very much advance the Trade thereof, and increase the Revenues of the Country.
<HI>They withal declared,</HI> That they could not conceive the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were such a sort
of People as hitherto they had been describ'd unto them in <HI>China;</HI> but whatsoever Chara∣cter
they lay stigmatiz'd under by former Reports, they were for their parts resolv'd to think
better, and speak accordingly of them, believing now no otherwise, but that they were brave
Merchants. <HI>Last of all,</HI> They desir'd that some trial might be had of their Dealings, and
returned however their Thanks to the Governors of <HI>Maccoa</HI> for their good Care and
Counsel.</P>
<P>The Vice-Roys hereupon publish'd in Writing their Consent to a free
Trade, and withal gave leave to <HI>Schedel</HI> to erect a Factory: They themselves
likewise bought a good part of his Imported Lading, whereof they made no
small Gain, which without doubt would have been far greater, if so be the
ordinary Merchants might have bought the same. It was also agreed, for the
better vending of the remainder of the Goods, That one <HI>Peter Bolle</HI> an Under-Factor,
with four <HI>Hollanders</HI> more, should have leave to continue at <HI>Canton.</HI>
But after that <HI>Schedel</HI> had taken his leave of the old Vice-Roy, and went to pay
his Congees to the young Vice-Roy, there hapned a Business whereof he had
not the least thought of, and which did not a little surprize him.</P>
<P>A Commissioner who lately arrived from the Imperial City of <HI>Peking</HI> at
<HI>Canton,</HI> did highly disswade the Vice-Roy from granting a free Trade to the
<HI>Hollanders;</HI> alledging, That it was one thing to grant a Port to a Forein Peo∣ple,
and another to allow a constant Habitation in their Countrey, without
informing of the Supreme Authority, and that the Emperor ought to have
notice, that so no blame might light upon his Majesty. This did so much
perplex the Vice-Roy, that first of all he advis'd <HI>Schedel</HI> to depart, after∣wards
to be gone forthwith, and to take all his Company with him for this
time, that so the King of <HI>Batavia</HI> (by whom he understood the <HI>Holland</HI> Gene∣ral)
might not think they were kept Prisoners in <HI>Canton;</HI> adding withal, that
this was done upon <HI>Schedel</HI>'s Reasons, and for their Good. Hereupon two
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>
days after <HI>Schedel</HI> departs with all his Company, and whatever else, in the
<HI>Brown-Fish</HI> for <HI>Batavia,</HI> taking with him two Letters from the Vice-Roys, to
<HI>Nicholas Verburgh,</HI> Commander in Chief at <HI>Taiwan.</HI> In these Letters the Vice-Roys
offer their Friendships to the General, and advise him, if he desir'd in
<HI>China</HI> a Free Trade, to send an Embassador with rich Presents to the <HI>Great Cham.</HI></P>
<P>The Government of <HI>Batavia</HI> perceiving the good beginning of this Depu∣tation,
thought fit to write to their Principals in <HI>Holland</HI> about it, and to ex∣pect
their Answer concerning this Embassy to the <HI>Great Cham.</HI> In the mean
time, to keep the Business on foot, they likewise thought good to send some
other Person to <HI>Canton,</HI> and so made choice of <HI>Zacharias Waggenaar</HI> for that
Employment, who departed from <HI>Batavia</HI> with two laden Vessels, the <HI>Shell-Fish</HI>
and <HI>Brown-Fish;</HI> which after a Months Sailing arriv'd at the Island of <HI>Hey∣tamon,</HI>
in the Mouth of the River of <HI>Canton,</HI> and Sail'd from thence to <HI>Wangsoe,</HI>
within three Miles of the City of <HI>Canton;</HI> where being arriv'd, they continu'd
for some days in their Station before they sent any one ashore; but at last
(no body offering to come Aboard) they thought good to send one of the
Company thither, who immediately applly'd himself to the <HI>Heytenu,</HI> who sent
him to the <HI>Toutang;</HI> but not finding this <HI>Toutang,</HI> or his Secretary at home, he
return'd late to the Sea side, not knowing where to Lodge that Night: where∣upon
some of the Vice-Roys Followers came running after him in great
amazement, and desir'd him to return Aboard forthwith, otherwise he would
be in danger of losing his Life; but he refus'd, and chose rather to lie all
Night upon the Ground; which the Interpreter of the Vice-Roy understand∣ing,
he offer'd him his own House, and led him homeward; but coming near
the Walls of the City, and mistrusting the Carriage of this Interpreter, he de∣sir'd
that he might remain where he was till the Morning, then he would
venture into the City; which was accordingly done: and notice thereof
being given to the Vice-Roy, he presently order'd him a Lodging, whither
he went, and after some short stay apply'd himself to the Secretary of the <HI>Tou∣tang;</HI>
who acquainted him, How that the <HI>Portugueses</HI> with their Followers,
had prevail'd so far in the Imperial City of <HI>Peking,</HI> that a Letter was sent to
the Magistrates in <HI>Canton</HI> concerning them, intimating, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
were a treacherous lying People, and that for fear of being known in <HI>China</HI>
they durst not appear at <HI>Peking;</HI> insomuch that those in <HI>Canton</HI> ought to have
a watchful Eye upon them, especially if they were come without bringing
with them an Embassador to the <HI>Great Tartar Cham.</HI></P>
<P>At the same time came also from <HI>Maccoa</HI> to <HI>Canton</HI> a Commander, with a
Request, that by Provision, and till farther Advice should come from <HI>Peking,</HI>
an Embargo might be laid upon the Ships of the <HI>East-India Company</HI> lying
there; insinuating, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had formerly in a Pyratical way taken
several of their Ships, to the utter ruine of their Country. The <HI>Portugueses</HI>
likewise to prevent the <HI>Hollanders</HI> from driving a Trade in <HI>China,</HI> paid an Ar∣rear
of four years Tax. In short, this Business seem'd to draw much Trouble
after it, and likewise to end with bad Success, though great hopes was given of
the contrary by those in Power, and much Art and Industry was us'd by them,
to perswade the Messenger that this Delay would in the end turn to his Ad∣vantage,
and was only occasion'd through the coming of a certain Field-Com∣mander
from <HI>Peking,</HI> with some thousands of Foot-Soldiers, to joyn and re∣ceive
the young Vice-Roy, who had been a while in pursuit of some Com∣motioners.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="16"/>
In the mean time <HI>Waggenaar</HI> expecting with great impatience the issue of
his Business, was so narrowly Guarded by two or three of the Vice-Roy's
Vessels, that no body was suffer'd to pass to or from him; at last, after long
expectation came the Messenger back, and presently after the Secretary of the
<HI>Toutang,</HI> with the Mandorins <HI>Taycoetsin</HI> and <HI>Thiapang,</HI> with Orders to bring the
Ships within half a Mile of the City, and there to lie till such time as the said
Commander (who was not to know for several Reasons of the Arrival of the
<HI>Hollanders)</HI> had taken his leave and was gone. During which time <HI>Waggenaar</HI>
was Presented with several Rarities, in token that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were receiv'd
as Friends; in requital whereof he gratifi'd their Kindness with <HI>Guinee</HI> Lin∣nen,
Bottles of Rose-Water, and several other Returns. The next day the
Ships being come higher up the River, several of the Company would have
gone ashore to refresh themselves, but were prevented by the Vice-Roy's
Ships of War, which lay there to watch the Designs of <HI>Waggenaar.</HI></P>
<P>Afterward came the Mandorin <HI>Haitonu</HI> Aboard with several Attendants,
to conduct <HI>Waggenaar</HI> Ashore; and when he had been civilly Treated, he de∣sir'd
him that he would prepare himself to go to the Court: but just as he
was taking Horse, there came two <HI>Mandorins</HI> to him with an unexpected Mes∣sage,
putting several strange Questions to him, <HI>viz. Why</HI> Waggenaar <HI>was desi∣rous
to speak with the Vice-Roy? and what his Business was? and whether he had brought
any Letters or Presents for the</HI> Great Cham <HI>at</HI> Peking, <HI>and for the Mandoring</HI> Tou∣tang
<HI>at</HI> Canton? adding withal (wherewith he ended his Discourse) <HI>That the</HI>
Portugueses <HI>were the occasion of all this misunderstanding.</HI> But that which seem'd
most pleasant, they declared, <HI>That if the</HI> Hollanders <HI>would appear before the Vice-Roy
in Person, they must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e very liberal to all that were about him.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Wag∣genaar</HI>
made answer, <HI>That he was not willing to Bribe the Vice-Roy or his Courtiers,
to take the Letters and Presents of his Lords and Masters, contrary to his and their Incli∣nations;
but yet he would give a good Sum of Money to him that should procure a Free
Trade for this Year at</HI> Canton. During this Conference, the same <HI>Haitonu</HI> re∣turns
with Advice to <HI>Waggenaar, That he must not appear before the Vice-Roy, who
notwithstanding would read his Letter.</HI> Hereupon <HI>Waggenaar</HI> delivers him the Let∣ter;
and not long after an Answer was brought him by the Vice-Roy's In∣terpreter,
which was to this effect: <HI>That in regard the</HI> Hollanders <HI>had not brought
with them any Letters nor Presents to the Emperor at</HI> Peking, <HI>though sufficient Advice
had been given thereof to the</HI> Hollanders <HI>at</HI> Batavia, <HI>and highly recommended unto them;
therefore it was to his great sorrow, that he could not suffer them to have any Speech with
him.</HI></P>
<P>Now when <HI>Waggenaar</HI> saw that he could not effect any thing with him, he
departed from <HI>Canton</HI> with both the Yachts, and return'd back to <HI>Batavia,</HI>
nothing being done. In the mean time, these barbarous People were not
asham'd to demand ten thousand Toel of Silver, onely to render the Letter
and Presents acceptable to the Vice-Roy, before any Conference could be had
about driving a Trade with them.</P>
<P>Now according to the Proposal of the General <HI>Iohn Maatzuiker,</HI> and the
Council of <HI>India,</HI> the Governors of the <HI>East-India Company</HI> at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> conclu∣ded
and order'd an Embassy to be sent from <HI>Batavia,</HI> to the <HI>Grand Tartar Cham</HI>
at <HI>Peking.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Peter de Goyer</HI> and <HI>Iacob de Keyzer,</HI> both Merchants, were
chosen Ambassadors at <HI>Hurkos,</HI> with a suitable Train of fourteen Pesons,
namely two Merchants, six Waiters, a Steward, a Chirurgeon, two Interpre∣ters,
one Trumpeter, and one Drummer. Beside these, they took two Mer∣chants
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>
more with them, who during their Voyage to <HI>Peking,</HI> were to take care
of the Traffick at <HI>Canton,</HI> namely <HI>Francis Lantsman</HI> as Chief, and <HI>Henry Grams∣bergen</HI>
his Companion; two Yatches were appointed to Transport them from
<HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Canton,</HI> and from thence to the Imperial City of <HI>Peking.</HI> The Pre∣sents
which the Ambassadors took with them for the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> consisted of
several rich Piece-Goods, as Cloth, Kersies, and other Woollen Manufactures,
of fine Linnen, Mace, Cinamon, Cloves, Nutmegs, Coral, little Trunks of
Wax, Perspective-Glasses, Looking-Glasses, great and small Swords, Guns,
Feathers, Armour, and several other Wares. The Contents of their Creden∣tials
were to this purpose, that the chief end and design of this Embassy was
to make a good Agreement and firm League with the Emperor of <HI>Tartary</HI> and
<HI>China,</HI> that there might be a Free Trade driven throughout his whole King∣doms
betwixt his Subjects and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and that the same might be con∣firm'd
under the Hand and Seal of both Parties.</P>
<P>Having put Aboard the Merchandises, Presents, and other Necessaries for
our Voyage, the Ambassadors went Aboard on the 14. of <HI>Iune 1655.</HI> with
all their Followers, we set Sail that same Night with a South-East Wind from
the Coast of <HI>Batavia,</HI> steering our Course Northerly. But before I relate what
hapned to us upon our Voyage, after we came in sight of the firm Land of
<HI>China,</HI> I will give you an Account in brief of this famous and eminent City, a
Draught whereof I toook before my Departure from thence, and is thus here
represented in the adjoyning <HI>Print.</HI></P>
<P>This City <HI>Batavia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption of the Island <HI>Iava.</HI></NOTE> so call'd from the <HI>Netherlands</HI> ancient Name, is situated
in the Island of <HI>Great Iava,</HI> and so fruitful in all manner of Cattel and Corn,
that the Learned <HI>Scaliger</HI> extoll'd this Island for one of the most fruitful and
comprehensive Places in the whole World: for from hence comes not only
Pepper, Ginger, Cinamon, and other Spices in great abundance, but also all
manner of tame and wild Cattel, which are Transported from thence to other
Parts. It produces also all manner of Gems, Gold-Mines, Precious Stones, and
rich Silks in great quantities; but yet so subject to stormy and tempestuous
Weather, that they are seldom free from Commotion'd Skies.</P>
<P>The ancient Natives of this Island are originally sprung from the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
who for the most part fearing the Incursions of the <HI>Tartar,</HI> fled out of their
own Country, and setled themselves here in <HI>Iava</HI> and other adjacent Isles,
which they chose for their security against their Enemies. The Natives of this
Island, who call themselves by the Name of <HI>Iavaners,</HI> are generally of a middle
Stature, and round Visag'd; most of them go naked, having only a Cloth
about their Middle to cover their Secrets. They are counted the most civiliz'd
People of all the <HI>Indians;</HI> but yet they are great Gluttons, Proud, Deceitful,
Impudent, and not to be trusted when they have Pass'd their Words: for
when a King of <HI>Iava</HI> had falsifi'd his Word and his Promise, and was hand∣somly
rebuk'd for it, he return'd for answer, <HI>That the Tongue of a Man was
not made of Bone;</HI> as if he had said, <HI>It ought to be more pliant to the flexibility of the
Mind and various Resolutions.</HI> They are also represented to be Cruel, Blood-thirsty,
and hardly appeased when once offended; as also that they were wont
to eat the dead Bodies of their Friends. As to their Religion, they are all of
them <HI>Mahumetans</HI> or <HI>Idolaters,</HI> according to the several Perswasions of their
Kings, who are many in this Isle, where <HI>Paganism,</HI> as the most ancient, was
spread universally, and most of them were <HI>Idolaters:</HI> but within these 140
years <HI>Mahumetanism</HI> seems to out-strip the other, having more Proselytes.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="18"/>
The chief Cities of this Island are, <HI>Bantam,</HI> (which is very famous for Trade,
<HI>Choribon,</HI> and <HI>Iapara,</HI> from whence the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> fetch their Pepper
in great quantities. There was formerly in the place where the City of <HI>Bata∣via</HI>
is built (which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took by force of Arms from the Natives) a
City call'd <HI>Caloppa,</HI> which in the time of <HI>Cornelius Houtman</HI> (the chief Promoter
and Contriver of the <HI>East-India</HI> Navigation) was replenish'd with more than
three thousand Houses, beside several Forts and Bulwarks. But the <HI>English,</HI>
who endeavor'd to make themselves absolute and sole Masters of the Trade in
this Island, suborn'd several of the Inhabitants thereof to gain them on their
sides; and by this means caus'd the whole City to be totally destroy'd. The
<HI>Hollanders</HI> on the other side, to frustrate this their Design, built two strong
Forts, whereof one is call'd <HI>Mauritius,</HI> situated upon the River, and the other
<HI>Nassau,</HI> in memory of that great Captain. Both these Places were always
well provided against the continual Assaults of those of <HI>Iava,</HI> who were still
endeavoring to drive the <HI>Hollanders</HI> out of this their Plantation. At last, after
some years, the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> the better to withstand the violent Incursions of the
Natives, built a new City fare stronger than the other, where formerly the old
<HI>Caloppa,</HI> or <HI>Iacatra</HI> was situated, and call'd it <HI>Batavia.</HI> This <HI>Batavia,</HI> which lies
in the height of 6 Degrees and 10 Minutes, is four-square, a River running
through the Town, which makes as it were two entire Cities. The lesser half
exceeds the other in Strength, in regard of an invincible Castle in it, which for
its better defence is encompassed with four Bulwarks with deep Moats round
about. The City is very populous, and consists of Natives, <HI>Chineses,</HI> and <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI>
and adorn'd with stately Structures, and the Streets planted with se∣veral
sorts of <HI>Indian</HI> Trees, so that you walk cool in the greatest Heats. On the
Sea-side (which is narrowly Guarded) lies a safe and commodious Harbor for
Shipping. The Arms of the City is a naked Sword with a Laurel Garland.
Here the General (who Commands in the Name of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> over
all the Forts and Castles in <HI>India)</HI> has his Residence; who is provided with no
less Power and Authority than formerly the <HI>Stadtholder</HI> and chief Commander
of these Parts were wont to enjoy, and lives in no less Pomp and State than
the Princes of <HI>Europe:</HI> And this great Honor and Authority is conferr'd upon
him, that the Natives, dazled with the splendor of his Greatness, may so be
the better reduc'd under Obedience. But with this Commander in Chief is
joyn'd a Council, whose Advice is always to be taken in Matters of Peace and
War, the Protection and safety of the Country, and the Commerce thereof.
The Iudicature consists of a President and several Aldermen. There is one
general Guild or Chamber of Accompts, to which all the rest which are in
<HI>India</HI> under the Command of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> are responsible. The whole City
lies surrounded with thirteen strong Bulwarks, which have been often Attem∣pted
and Assaulted by the Natives, but are not to be Master'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> made formerly a Contract at <HI>Iava</HI> with the Kings of those
Parts, about the Business of Commerce; but when they began to deal treache∣rously,
contrary to the Articles of Agreement, in raising the Imposts, it was
thought fit to erect a Castle or Fort in the City. The <HI>English</HI> at that time held a
straight Correspondence and Amity with the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> but it so hapned,
that Fears and Iealousies, and Misunderstandings arose between them; so
that after a bloody Fight of eleven <HI>English</HI> Ships against seven <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which
continu'd from Morning till Night, our Party was forc'd to flie, and to retreat
to <HI>Amboyna,</HI> and there to Rally more Force. The King of <HI>Iacatra</HI> upon this
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>
Occasion made an Agreement with the <HI>English,</HI> and joyning their Forces toge∣ther,
laid close Siege to the new Fort, which defended it self gallantly for six
Months. In the mean time the <HI>Hollanders</HI> brought several of their Ships from
the <HI>Malava</HI> Islands, to the number of eighteen, which came thither to relieve
their besieged Countrymen. The <HI>English</HI> having advice of their coming, left
the Siege, brought the Cannon Aboard, and set Sail through the Straight of
<HI>Sunda.</HI> The General <HI>Iohn Peterson Koene</HI> (who was newly arriv'd with a Fleet
from <HI>Holland,</HI> not doubting of the Treachery of the King, though he endea∣vor'd
to excuse himself, laying all the blame upon the <HI>English)</HI> Landed his
Men with good Order and Conduct; who after a few hours Refreshment,
prepar'd themselves to assault the Besiegers; which they did, and after some
little opposition broke through the Trenches, and got into the City. The
King finding his Forces defeated, and the Town relieved, saved himself by
flight, leaving the residue of his Army to the Mercy of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who put
all to the Sword, except Women and Children; yea, the City of <HI>Iacatra</HI> it self
was laid in Ashes, and the Walls levell'd with the Ground. After this great
Victory, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> strongly fortifi'd themselves in those Parts; which the
Emperor of the Island <HI>Iava</HI> perceiving, concluded to Besiege this our new
erected City of <HI>Batavia;</HI> and in the Year 1629. he Encamped himself under the
Walls, making several Assaults upon the Place, but was still beaten off with
considerable Loss. The greatest Attempt which the Enemy made, was upon
<HI>September 20.</HI> in the Night; but they were likewise forc'd to retreat with a
great slaughter; whose dead Bodies was no small annoyance to the Besieged:
Against this Inconvenience they burnt several odoriferous Gums, to prevent
the Contagion which might proceed from thence.</P>
<P>Amongst other remarkable Passages that hapned during this Siege, is that
Storm most to be admir'd, which the Enemy made upon a Fort situated at
the farther corner of the City, which was onely Guarded by sixteen Soldiers,
who shew'd far greater Courage in making their Defence, than the Assaulters
in the Attempt with their whole Army; for after that they had spent all their
Powder and Shot, they until'd the very Fort, and with the Shards thereof did
very great Execution upon the Enemy; which Ammunition being likewise
spent, and having nothing offensive, they at last emptied the House-of-Office
with Chamber-pots, and flung the Excrements, and so at once both perfum'd
and painted the naked Bodies of the Enemy; who at last perceiving that
those of the City intended to Sally out and relieve their Fellow Soldiers, they
rais'd the Siege, crying out in their Language, <HI>O you stinking Holland Devils, you
Fight with Tantoblins, and your Arms are Turdy-Pistical.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> mistrusting the <HI>Iavaners,</HI> continu'd within the City till
the Morning, then sending out some Foot to observe their Motion and Inten∣tion;
who found that they were all fled, and had left more than eight hun∣dred
dead on the Spot behind them; some of them were beheaded, others run
through, and laid in Rank and File one by another. The occasion of this
Murder is said to be this: The Emperor had the Year before (for this was
the second Siege) dispatch'd one of the chiefest Princes of the Kingdom with
an Army to <HI>Batavia;</HI> who finding great Opposition, return'd <HI>re infecta:</HI> The
Prince of <HI>Madura</HI> (which Island lies about half a Mile from <HI>Iava,</HI> under the
Power and Command of the Emperor) had made great Brags in contempt
and disparagement of some other Princes, what great Feats he would have
done upon the City with such an Army as this was, of two hundred thou∣sand
<FIGURE>
<PB N="29" REF="19"/>
</FIGURE>
Men, or else he would never have return'd alive. The Emperor hearing
this, sent for him, and made him Commander over new-rais'd Forces, toge∣ther
with the former, who had been sole General the foregoing Year, a Person
of a good Nature, Prudent, Valiant, and well belov'd among the Soldiers:
This General finding himself very much slighted by the Prince of <HI>Madura,</HI> who
was joyn'd in Commission with him, look'd upon himself as bound in point of
Honor to be reveng'd upon him; and having communicated his Intention
to some of his Friends in the Army, they immediately concluded to put his
Design in execution, being all of them made sensible of the Affront. The Prince
of <HI>Madura</HI> in the interim, not dreaming of the Mischief that was intended him,
came accidentally into the Chamber to confer about some Business with this
General: who thereupon told him, <HI>That his Word should now prove true, for from</HI>
Batavia <HI>be should never return alive;</HI> which having said, they presently kill'd him:
Word thereof being brought to the Emperor, who had a particular Respect
for this old General, he seem'd to like well enough of what had been done,
and gave him his Pardon. Thus much for Digression.</P>
<P>After the space of eight days, we came upon the 22. in sight of <HI>Paulo Teymon,</HI>
which is a pleasant, wondrous, and delightful Island, (as is expessed in the ad∣joining
<HI>Print)</HI> full of Woods, Hills, and Dales. Here we sent our Boats
Ashore to fetch Wood and fresh Water, wherewith we had not at first so well
provided our selves as we ought to have done.</P>
<P>In this Island grows the Leaf <HI>Betel</HI> in great abundance, much in request
amongst the <HI>Iavaners,</HI> who fetch whole Boats-full.</P>
<P>We made no long stay here, but as soon as we had got our Provisions
Aboard, we set Sail to pursue our Voyage, and on the 1. of <HI>Iuly</HI> came in sight of
the large Continent, leaving <HI>Couchinchina</HI> North North-West; and about Noon
we h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the heighth of 20 Degrees and 6 Minutes: we Sail'd along the Coast,
which was very pleasant. This <HI>Couchinchina</HI> is part of the Kingdom of <HI>Gannan,</HI>
which is one of the neighbor Countries that are situated out of the Kingdom
of <HI>China,</HI> but yet belongs to the <HI>Chineses;</HI> for under this <HI>Gannan</HI> is situated the
Kingdoms of <HI>Tungking</HI> and <HI>Kianchi,</HI> or <HI>Couchinchina,</HI> both which were formerly
call'd <HI>Nankiao.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Haionus,</HI> who was of the Family of <HI>Hana,</HI> being
a valiant Prince, conquer'd first of all these Countries, which he Planted, and
afterwards Govern'd the Inhabitants thereof according to the Laws and Man∣ners
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>
of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> This same Emperor was also the first who nam'd these
Countries and the Inhabitants <HI>Kiaoch;</HI> but afterwards the Family of <HI>Tanga</HI>
call'd them by the Name of <HI>Kiaochians.</HI> But it seems that the <HI>Chineses</HI> never
made any account of these Countries, in regard that the Inhabitants, accord∣ing
to the Saying of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> were wild and uncivil in their Conversation:
but others say they did it more out of fear, because they knew very well, that
the Inhabitants far exceeded them in strength of Body, and were desirous ra∣ther
to live conformable to their own Laws and Customs, and have their own
King, than submit their Necks under the Yoke of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> At the begin∣ning
of the Reign of the Family of <HI>Taiminga,</HI> for the space of 290 years, these
People were brought under the Lash of the Emperor <HI>Hunguus.</HI> But this Coun∣try
was afterwards made over to a petty King call'd <HI>Chin,</HI> who soon was made
away by his three Governors, who were of the Family of <HI>Ly,</HI> and so possess'd
themselves of the Realm. When the Emperor <HI>Iunglos</HI> observ'd the trouble∣som
Condition of that Kingdom, he caus'd two of the Governors to be put
to Death, but the third escap'd by flight; and the Emperor afterwards redu∣ced
the Kingdom of <HI>Gannam</HI> into a Province; but he had no sooner laid down
his Arms, but the Fugitive <HI>Ly</HI> began to appear again in the Field, and made
himself Master of the Kingdom: which done, he speedily sent Ambassadors
to pacifie the Emperor. At that time <HI>Sivanteus</HI> was Emperor, a peaceable Man,
and more a Slave to his Pleasure than a Prince of his Countries: This Empe∣ror
being weary of all these Mutinies and Troubles, made over again this
Country to this same <HI>Ly,</HI> and install'd him as a petty Prince, upon Condition
that he should send to him every three years an Ambassador with great Pre∣sents.
And in this manner these Parts were divided from the Empire of <HI>China</HI>
about the Year 1428. But these Countries, notwithstanding all this, grew
very troublesom, being full of Divisions; so that at last they came to be divi∣ded
into three Parts: the first was call'd <HI>The Kingdom of Laos,</HI> the second <HI>The
Kingdom of Tunking,</HI> and the third <HI>Couchinchina,</HI> which at present are no other
than part of the Provinces of <HI>Quangsi</HI> and <HI>Iunnan.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of these three Kingdoms, <HI>Laos, Tunking,</HI> and <HI>Couchinchina,</HI>
follow the Religion of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> They likewise use the <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters,
but yet differ very much in Speech and Pronunciation from them. These
Countries are very fruitful in every thing belonging to the sustenance of Man∣kind;
among other innumerable Trees and Fruits, there grows a Bean, which
makes an Oyl or Iuyce, by the <HI>Portugueses</HI> call'd <HI>Rosamalia.</HI> From hence comes
likewise in great abundance the <HI>Eagle-Wood,</HI> which is of a Purple colour, and
is known to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by the Name of <HI>Lacca,</HI> and us'd in <HI>China</HI> to dye and
colour Silk-Stuffs. It produces likewise good store of Linnen, Silk, and
Cotton.</P>
<P>Among other sorts of Monkies, here is also found one call'd <HI>Singsiing:</HI> the
manner of taking them in the Woods, is to set Wine before them, with which
they being Fudled, fall asleep, and so are taken napping; their Blood
makes an excellent Purple Dye.</P>
<P>Upon the 10. of the same Month we had a most violent Tempest, to our
great amazement and terror, in which we lost sight of the Yacht <HI>Bloemendael;</HI>
during which there hapned such perpetual Lightning, and hideous Thunder,
mingled with a Hurricane, that there was hardly any standing upon the
Decks, so that we were hourly in expectation of the loss both of Ship and
Goods. By the Way we saw a Ship driving without Masts, but could not
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="20"/>
<PB REF="21"/>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="31" REF="21"/>
discern what she was. The next day about Noon the Storm began to abate,
insomuch that toward Night we were able to make some small Sail, and saw
at a great distance a stout Ionck driving, which had lost all her Masts and
Rigging in the Storm; coming near unto her, she told us that she came
from <HI>Cambeya</HI> bound for <HI>Taiwan,</HI> and that the Wind had so far driven them,
that they had quite lost their Course, desiring to be directed by us what Point
to steer; we willingly answer'd their Request, and shew'd them the Streak
which runs up to the Island <HI>Formosa;</HI> for which they thank'd us, and steer'd
their Course accordingly. In the mean time we repair'd our Leaks and Dis∣orders;
which done, we Sail'd with a West-Wind North-West.</P>
<P>Upon the 14. we came in sight of the Island <HI>Maccoa,</HI> and kept us by the
heighth of 21 Degrees and 10 Minutes: in the Evening we Anchor'd, and
the next Morning we set Sail. We saw lying upon the Shore several Boats,
but not one would come Aboard, notwithstanding all the Signs we made to
invite them, so wondrous fearful they are of the Pyrate cokesing them, who
at that time held the Coast in continual Alarm, and whom they undoubtedly
took us to be.</P>
<P>Two days we Sail'd under this Island, thence passing by the most famous
and wealthy City of <HI>Maccoa;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption of the City <HI>Maccoa▪</HI></NOTE> and though we came not near it, yet I shall
relate what I have understood from others, concerning the Magnificence of
this Place, whereof you have a Draught as it was taken at Sea.</P>
<P>This Seat (which for many Ages has been held for the greatest Trading
City in all <HI>Asia)</HI> lies upon a little hanging Island, fixed to a greater, and is
built upon 2 very high Rock, which rises out of the Water, whose Wall is
wash'd round about by the Sea, except on the North-side, where it joins to
the Land by a little Slip, so that by the Sea on the one side, and the Moun∣tainous
Situation on the other, it is held invincible against the Power and
Strength of any whatsoever. The Sea which surrounds this Place is not very
deep, so that there is no Harbor near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any great Ships. This City exceeds
all others for great Cannon, which are to be had there at a reasonable Rate,
and wherewith they drive a considerable Trade, for they are held to be the
best of all <HI>India,</HI> being Cast of <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Iapan</HI> Copper, and are sent for far
and near. On the side of the Land stand only two Castles upon two small
Hills, which are however a great defence to the City against any Invasion.
This Seat has nothing of Trees, or the like, to hinder a fair Prospect toward
the Sea. The midst of the old Foundation, ere this City was built, an Idol
possessed, call'd <HI>Ama;</HI> and because of a safe Harbor there for Shipping, which
the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Gao,</HI> these two words being conjoin'd, they nam'd it <HI>Amacao,</HI>
and for brevities sake contracted it to <HI>Maccao,</HI> or <HI>Maccou.</HI> This Place (which lay
waste and unbuilt) the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> with the consent of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> did re∣edifie
and inhabit, which in a short time grew very populous and renowned
for Commerce, whither the <HI>Portugueses</HI> sent great store of Merchandises out of
<HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>India</HI> by Sea, as also from <HI>China.</HI> Likewise the <HI>Portugueses</HI> in <HI>Maccao</HI>
(which doth not a little advance and increase their Trade) have obtain'd that
freedom from the <HI>Chineses,</HI> that they may come twice ayear to the chief City
<HI>Canton,</HI> at their annual Marts, and there Barter, Buy, and Sell, and Trans∣port
then from thence abundance of several Wares to <HI>Maccao:</HI> for there is
found entred into the Custom-Books (when the Commerce flourish'd in that
Place) how much they Imported and Exported; they Exported above three
hundred Chests of all sorts of Silks, in each Chest a hundred and fifty Pieces
<FIGURE>
<PB N="32" REF="22"/>
</FIGURE>
of Velvet, or the like: they brought likewise from thence 25 hundred Ingots
of Gold, each Ingot weighing thirteen Ounces: they likewise commonly
Exported eight hundred Pounds of Musk, beside great quantities of Gold-Thred,
fine Linnen, unwrought Silk, Precious Stones, Pearls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sailing thus by the City of <HI>Maccao,</HI> we came to an Anchor under the Island
of <HI>Goyers,</HI> so call'd by the Name of <HI>Peter de Goyer.</HI></P>
<P>Opon the 18. of the same Month we arriv'd about Sun-set, only in com∣pany
with the Yacht <HI>Koukerken,</HI> (for we lost the Yacht <HI>Bloemendael</HI> in the Storm,
upon the Coast of <HI>Couchinchina,</HI> which came not till 48 days after us to <HI>Canton)</HI>
very safe into the Harbor of <HI>Heytamon,</HI> and dropt our Anchor in the middle
of the Bay at six and a half Fathom Water. This Place is exceeding pleasant,
and most commodious for Trade; on the Water side delightful Hills, and

<P>We were no sooner at Anchor, but a Barque full of Soldiers Boarded us,
who in the Name of the Governor were sent to ask the occasion of our co∣ming.
Hereupon the Ambassadors sent <HI>Hendrick Baron</HI> Ashore, to acquaint
him by word of Mouth with the occasion of our Arrival; who when he came
on Shore, was conducted into his Bed-chamber, where he was received very
courteously and Treated by him; who ask'd why the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did return?
and whether they were not about two years since expresly forbidden to come
to <HI>Canton.</HI></P>
<P>Six days after, on the 24. came two <HI>Mandorins</HI> from <HI>Canton</HI> to view the Cre∣dentials
they brought to the <HI>Great Cham;</HI> and to that purpose they sent for the
Ambassadors to the Governors House. Hereupon the Ambassadors, with all
their Followers, made up the River, and came about Noon to the Village of
<HI>Lamme,</HI> where they went Ashore, and were from thence conducted by the
Master of the Ceremonies to the Governor's Palace.</P>
<P>At their Entry they found the Governor sitting at a high Table in the Hall,
betwixt the two <HI>Mandorins,</HI> Guarded with Soldiers, who civilly treated us,
and were serviceable unto us. After Complements passed, the Ambassadors
shew'd their Credentials at a distance, against which the <HI>Mandorins</HI> had no∣thing
to object; and then Chairs were set for the Ambassadors to sit down:
which being done, the <HI>Mandorins</HI> and Governor began to ask several Questions
concerning the Trade and Condition of the <HI>United Netherlands;</HI> which being
<PB N="33" REF="22"/>
answer'd by the Ambassadors, they seem'd satisfi'd, and return'd to the Ship
with all their Followers.</P>
<P>Upon the 29. came again a new <HI>Heyton,</HI> with a Vice-Admiral (as Com∣missioners
from <HI>Canton)</HI> to receive the Ambassadors, and to conduct them thi∣ther.
Whereupon the Ambassadors at their Invitation went again Ashore,
and were conducted to an Idol-Temple; where being receiv'd after the usual
manner, they spread their Credentials upon the Table: Then <HI>Heyton</HI> began
to propose several Questions, namely, <HI>Whether we did not Sail from</HI> Canton
<HI>about two years? What manner of Wares and Merchandises we had brought with us?
Who was Aboard the other Ship, and how they came to separate from us? How many Men
and Guns were in each Ship? Why they did not come the last last Year? And why we staid
away one Year, and then came the second? When, by whom, as also to what end the Letters
were written, and the Ambassadors address'd themselves? What Presents we had brought
in particular for the Emperor?</HI> They seem'd to wonder very much, that the Am∣bassadors
had brought no Letter to the <HI>Teutang</HI> in <HI>Canton,</HI> and that the Letters
were put up so meanly: for they let them understand, that the Letter to the
Emperor ought to have been put up in a Golden Purse, or Box at least. At
last they thus made a Conclusion, That the next day they would come Aboard
our Ships to receive the Presents. Hereupon the Ambassadors departed, and
went Aboard again.</P>
<P>The next day the same Commissioners, with a great many Courtiers, came
Aboard, bringing with them several Vessels, very handsomly set off with Silk
Flags and Penons, to take in the Presents, as well for the Emperor as the <HI>Can∣ton</HI>
Vice-Roys and the <HI>Teutang,</HI> which they receiv'd with great civility. The
<HI>Heyton</HI> came himself Aboard to bid us welcom, and carried the Ambassadors,
with their Secretary <HI>Henry Baron</HI> and four of their Followers, in one of their
Vessels to the City of <HI>Canton,</HI> being accompanied with the Vice-Admiral;
where being arriv'd, the said Commissioners went into the City, without speak∣ing
one word to the Ambassadors; and after that the Retinue had staid at
least two hours at the Gates of the City, they were sent for in the Name of the
Vice-Roy, and conducted to a Lodging without the Walls, where formerly
Mr. <HI>Schedel</HI> had Lodg'd, and there Guarded and taken care of by the City
Marshal.</P>
<P>The next day, being the 31. there came to our Lodging with Commissio∣ners,
the Mandorin <HI>Poetsiensin,</HI> the Emperor's Treasurer, having the fourth
Voice of the Government in the City. They began again to move several
Questions to the Ambassadors, asking them, <HI>How many years they had been Mar∣ried?
Their Names and former Employments?</HI> as likewise, <HI>If they had no Copy of the
Letter to the Emperor? And whether that Letter was not writ upon better Paper than the
Epistle to the Vice-Roys? Wherefore, and to what end they were chiefly sent? How their
Prince and King was call'd?</HI> with several other Questions: Then they seem'd
to Mutter, and be displeas'd at the slight Fashion of the Credentials. To the
Request which the Ambassadors made, That they might have Audience of the
Vice-Roys, and have leave to go for <HI>Peking,</HI> they gave no Answer; but going
with the Letters to the Vice-Roys, they return'd again about Noon, and then
began to ask, <HI>Whether the Prince and Government of</HI> Holland <HI>had no Stamp not Great
Seal for their Letters? and from what Age of the World they were Dated.</HI> And as con∣cerning
the Desire of the Ambassadors, they gave them to understand, That
neither the Vice-Roys, nor the <HI>Teutang,</HI> nor any body else in <HI>Canton,</HI> had the
Power to give Audience to any Ambassadors, before they had first receiv'd an
<PB N="34" REF="23"/>
Answer to the Letter which they had sent to <HI>Peking</HI> concerning them: How∣ever,
they gave order that the Yacht <HI>Koukerken</HI> should be brought near to the
City, and promis'd that the Vice-Roys (to welcom the Ambassadors in a more
then ordinary manner, and to view the Presents which they had brought to
the <HI>Great Cham)</HI> would appear personally at their Lodging.</P>
<P>Wherefore upon the second of <HI>August</HI> we receiv'd Order to follow the
Ambassador with our Yacht, four great Men of War of the Vice-Roy's being
appointed to conduct us up the River. About the Evening we came to an
Anchor near a small Castle, where the River is above two Miles broad, and
has lying upon both sides several little Islands. On the left side of this Ri∣ver,
upon a small Hill, stands a high Tower, very curiously adorn'd with nine
Rounds. The like Tower also shews it self upon a certain Island, over against
the chief City of <HI>Canton.</HI> The Countries situated on both sides of this River,
abound very much in Villages, which are mighty populous, and fruitful
Fields, affording twice every year the labouring and diligent Countriman a
very rich Harvest.</P>
<P>Upon the fourth of the same Month we came before the famous and Chief
City of <HI>Canton,</HI> which is call'd by some <HI>Quancheu,</HI> and the first Capital City of
the Province of <HI>Quantung.</HI> After our Devotions, and the taking order about
every thing Aboard our Ship, we went that day Ashore to the Ambassa∣dors,
whom we found Lodg'd in a stately Edifice, situated upon the River
side (over against which lay our Yacht) and formerly had been an Idol-Tem∣ple.
The Vice-Roy had order'd two <HI>Mandorins</HI> to Guard with a good num∣ber
of Soldiers the Gates for our Security.</P>
<P>But no sooner was the Yacht come to the Ambassadors Lodgings, but they
must immediately (though against their wills) return Aboard again, under pre∣tence,
that no Ambassadors which are sent to the Emperor are to reside at
<HI>Canton,</HI> without an express Order from his Imperial Majesty: They likewise
alledg'd for their excuse, That the Governors of <HI>Canton</HI> would not be able to
answer to the Emperor concerning any Mischief or Accident which might
happen to the Ambassadors, being Ashore. Afterwards the <HI>Mandorins, Poetsi∣ensin,</HI>
and <HI>Heyton,</HI> brought the Credentials open'd Aboard, saying, That the
Vice-Roys durst not accept or keep them, before they had receiv'd Advice
from the Imperial City of <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>As at the beginning, for the better understanding of the whole Relation of
our Travels, I gave an Account in short of all the great and small Cities of
the ten Provinces in <HI>China</HI> through which I did not travel, so now I find my
self necessitated, for the more particular information of the whole Empire of
<HI>China,</HI> to relate briefly the remaining five Provinces, each in his due place,
and the number of Cities into which each Province is divided; all which I
saw my self.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> which is the twelfth in number (amongst the fif∣teen
into which all <HI>China</HI> is divided) is encompass'd on the West with the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> on the North-West and North with that of <HI>Kiangsi;</HI> on the
North-East it borders upon <HI>Foking,</HI> from which it is separated by steep Hills
and Mountains, and the River <HI>Ting:</HI> All the rest of the Province borders on
the Sea, which causes so many safe Harbors and Roads for Shipping in these
Parts. The Country is in some places flat and even, and in others Hilly and
Mountainous, especially toward the South, as we often found to our great
inconvenience upon our Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="23"/>
This Province produces all things necessary for the sustenance of Man, as
likewise several sorts of rich Wares and Commodities, as well Artificial as
Natural: It likewise yields the Husbandman Fruits twice ayear, as Rice,
Corn, and other Products; for in it you have no cold Weather all Winter, so
that the <HI>Chineses</HI> have a Proverb among them, that there are three very strange
things in <HI>Quantung,</HI> viz. <HI>The Heaven without Snow, Trees green in Winter as in Sum∣mer,</HI>
and <HI>The Inhabitants spitting Blood:</HI> for first of all, it never Snows here, the
Trees are never unperwig'd, and the Inhabitants continually chewing the
Leaves of <HI>Betel</HI> and <HI>Areka,</HI> prepar'd after their way, makes their Spittle red.
From hence comes likewise great quantities of Gold, Pearl, Precious Stones,
Silk, Quick-silver, Copper, Steel, Iron, Salt-petre, Eagle-Wood, and several
other odoriferous Woods.</P>
<P>The People in these Parts are very ingenious, laborious, and nimble, and
can imitate any thing which they see made before them: and whatsoever the
<HI>Portugueses</HI> bring thither out of <HI>Europe</HI> woven of Gold, Silver, or the like, which
is strange unto them, they will immediately endeavor to work the same, and
in a short time will accomplish what they undertake: for I gave a <HI>Chinese</HI>
Goldsmith a Silver Button to make a Set by, and the next day he brought to
my Lodging what I had bespoke, very curiously wrought, as if he had been
us'd to such work, though he had never done the like before; which argues
their Ingenuity to be very great.</P>
<P>Among other Fowls which are to be seen in this Country, are great store of
Ducks, which the Inhabitants have the art and way to raise and increase, be∣yond
all the rest of their Neighbors.</P>
<P>This Province is Govern'd (as also each of the other Provinces) in the Em∣perors
Name, by Governors, who by those of <HI>Europe</HI> (because their Offices and
Employments much resemble Vice-Roys) are call'd petty Kings, who com∣monly
reside in the first Chief City of the Province.</P>
<P>When we were at <HI>Canton, Quantung</HI> was Govern'd by two Vice-Roys, where∣of
one, in regard of his Years, was call'd the old, and the other the young
Vice-Roy: The <HI>Portugueses</HI> call'd the young Vice-Roy <HI>Halick Mancebo.</HI></P>
<P>The Vice-Roys of <HI>Quantung</HI> take place of all the Governors of the other
Provinces, because situated upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom, and far re∣mote
from the Imperial City <HI>Peking,</HI> and borders also upon the Sea; by
which means the High-ways are troubled with Robbers, and the Sea with
Pyrates: therefore the Emperor orders that the Vice-Roys of <HI>Quantung</HI> shall
Command over the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> though this last, as the other Pro∣vinces,
has also particular Vice-Roys.</P>
<P>This Country was formerly a Kingdom of it self, and call'd <HI>Nainve,</HI> and
first brought under the Command of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors at the end of the
Reign of the Race of <HI>Cheva;</HI> yet however it did not continue long under that
Power, but revolted, and would be Rul'd by none but the Kings of <HI>Nainve.</HI>
The Emperor <HI>Hiaorus</HI> (of the Family of <HI>Hana)</HI> at last conquer'd this part,
since which time it has been subject to the Emperors of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>In this Province are ten Chief Cities, and seventy three small Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quantung</HI> and her Ci∣ties.</NOTE> with∣out
reckoning among them the City of <HI>Maccao,</HI> famous for Traffick and Com∣merce.</P>
<P><HI>The ten Chief Cities are these,</HI> Quancheu <HI>or</HI> Canton, Xaocheu, Nanhiung, Hoei∣cheu,
Chaocheu, Chaoking, Kaocheu, Liencheu, Lincheu, <HI>and</HI> Kiuncheu.</P>
<P>The Chief City of <HI>Quancheu</HI> Commands over fifteen small Cities, among
<PB N="36" REF="24"/>
which I do not reckon <HI>Maccao,</HI> though it lies under the Command of this
Chief City. The 15 small ones of this great City are these; <HI>Quancheu</HI> or <HI>Canton,
Xunte, Tangvon, Cengching, Hiangxan, Sinhoei, Cingyven, Sinning, Cunghoa, Lungu∣men,
Sanxui, Lien, Iangxan, Tienxan,</HI> and <HI>Singan.</HI></P>
<P>The second Capital City <HI>Xaocheu</HI> Commands over six small Cities, <HI>Xao∣cheu,
Locang, Giughoa, Iuyven, Ungyen,</HI> and <HI>Ingote.</HI> The Country about this Chief
City is for the most part full of Hills.</P>
<P>The third Chief City is <HI>Nanhiung</HI> or <HI>Nanhung,</HI> and Commands over two
Cities, <HI>Nanhiung</HI> and <HI>Xihing.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth Chief City is <HI>Hoeicheu,</HI> and Commands over 10 small Cities,
<HI>Hoeicheu, Polo, Haifung, Hoiven, Lungchuen, Changlo, Hingning, Hoping, Changing,</HI>
and <HI>Iunggan.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth Chief City is <HI>Chaocheu,</HI> and Commands likewise over 10 small
Cities, <HI>Chaocheu, Chaoyang, Kieyang, Chinghiang, Iaoping, Tapu, Hoeilai, Cinghai, Pu∣ning,</HI>
and <HI>Pingyven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The sixth Chief City is</HI> Chaoking, <HI>and Commands over eleven Cities,</HI> Chao∣king,
Sinhoei, Sinhing, Yangchun, Yangkiang, Caoming, Genping, Teking, Quangning,
Fuchuen, <HI>and</HI> Kalklen.</P>
<P>The seventh Chief City is <HI>Caocheu,</HI> and Commands over six small Cities,
<HI>Caocheu, Tienpe, Sing, Hoa, Vuchnen,</HI> and <HI>Xeching.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth Chief City is <HI>Lieucheu,</HI> and Commands over four small Cities,
<HI>Lieucheu, Knig, Lingxan,</HI> and <HI>Xelien.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth Chief City is <HI>Luicheu,</HI> and Commands over three small Cities,
<HI>Luichtu, Sniki,</HI> and <HI>Siuven.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth Chief City is <HI>Kiuncheu,</HI> situated in the Island of <HI>Hainan,</HI> and Com∣mands
over twelve small Cities, <HI>Kiuncheu, Lincao, Tingan, Veuchung, Hoeitung,
Lohoei, Chen, Changhoa, Van, Linxui, Yai,</HI> and <HI>Cangen.</HI></P>
<P>In this whole Province are ten Forts or Castles, which serve for the De∣fence
of the Province and the Sea, the Names whereof are these; <HI>Taching, Tung,
Hanxan, Ginghai, Kiacu, Kiexe, Ciexing, Hiung, Iunching,</HI> and <HI>Ciungling.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Toll-Book (wherein the number of the People of each Province
is set down) makes mention of Four hundred eighty three thousand three hun∣dred
and sixty Families, and Nineteen hundred seventy eight thousand and
twenty Fighting Men in this Province.</P>
<P>The Taxes which this Province pays yearly to the Emperor, amounts to
Ten hundred seventeen thousand seven hundred and twenty two Bags of Rice,
and seven thousand three hundred and fourscore Weight of Salt.</P>

<HEAD>CANTON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAnton,</HI> the first Chief City of this Kingdom, lies upon the height of twenty
three Degrees Northern Latitude, and is surrounded toward the East,
West, and North, with very fruitful and delightful Hills, and borders to∣ward
the South so much upon the Sea, that on that side there is no part of all
<HI>China</HI> so commodious to Harbor Shipping, where they likewise arrive daily
fram all Quarters of the World, with all manner of Goods, wherewith they
make a considerable Gain. It lies likewise upon the right-side of the River
<HI>Ta,</HI> where it grows somewhat narrow; but lower towards the Sea it spreads
to such a breadth, that it seems more like an Ocean than a Stream. For three
Miles upon this River is the City of <HI>Canton</HI> Wall'd in, and some Places adorn'd
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="24"/>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="25"/>
<FIGURE>
<PB N="37" REF="25"/>
</FIGURE>
with rich and populous Suburbs, which are not much inferior to the ordinary
Cities both in bigness and number of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>On the Water side the City is defended with two rows of high and thick
Walls, which are strengthned with Bulwarks, Watch-Towers, and other Forts:
and beside these Works there are two other strong Water-Castles, which be∣ing
built in the middle of the River, render this City invincible. One of these
two Castles, which I saw my self, and which doth not much differ in any thing
from the other, I took an exact Draught of, which you have here presented,
shewing the Strength of the Place, and in what manner built.</P>
<P>The City is likewise defended and surrounded on the Land side with a
strong Wall, and five strong Castles, whereof some are within the Walls, and
others without upon the tops of steep Hills; so that this City is sufficiently
both by Sea and Land defended against all the Invasions of any Enemy what∣soever,
and in the opinion of some seems invincible. What concerns the Idol-Temples,
Courts, and Palaces of Great Lords, and other rare Edifices, which
are to be seen here, there is no City in all <HI>Asia</HI> that shews the like.</P>
<P>Here also are several Triumphal Arches, which have been erected to the
Honor of such as have done their Country Service. They are no small Or∣nament
to the Place; for from the Water-gate, going directly on to the King's
Palace, I told in that Line onely, no less than thirteen stately Triumphal
Arches made of hewn Stone, which are so set out with Figures and Inscripti∣ons
in Carved Work, that all who behold them, admire them as Wonders.</P>
<P>And this being one of the greatest and most considerable Ornaments where∣with
the <HI>Chineses</HI> adorn their Cities, I have for the better demonstration of the
Workmanship, set before you the following Printed Draught of one of them,
that you may take a full view of every part, and so judge of all the rest, which
are generally built after one and the same fashion.</P>
<P>These Arches are commonly built with three Stories, so artificially, that
we may very well say, that neither Wit nor Ingenuity were wanting in their
Contrivance. Round about the Pillars, and in other places, were writ several
<HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, and also cut several Flowers, Beasts, Birds, and other cu∣rious
Ornaments, as I suppose, Emblematical.</P>
<P>This <HI>Canton</HI> exceeded formerly in Shipping all other Chief Cities in <HI>China,</HI>
whose Ships likewise were counted the best Sailers; for the Inhabitants went
<FIGURE>
<PB N="38" REF="26"/>
</FIGURE>
beyond all other <HI>Chineses</HI> in Navigation, to the Islands of <HI>Formosa, Iapan,</HI> and
other Parts, which did very much increase the Wealth and Commerce of the
Place.</P>
<P>That you may the better take a view of the Situation of this most famous
City, I here present two Draughts, the one the Prospect as upon the Water,
the other Ichnographical, of their Streets, Ground-plats, Temples, Walls,
Castles, Houses, and whatsoever else. They say this City before the last War,
was so wondrous populous and full of Traffick, that daily there were at least
five or six Men crowded to death in passing through the Gates; which will
not seem altogether incredible, if you consider the number of the adjacent
Villages, which abound with People constantly resorting thither. This City
hath been twice subdu'd by Arms; and they say, that in the last Siege there
were slain above a hundred thousand Men. I shall relate to you in short what
hapned to <HI>Canton</HI> during that terrible and bloody Invasion.</P>
<P>After that the <HI>Tartars</HI> had made themselves Masters of all <HI>China</HI> (except
some few Sea-Towns) they fell with such a formidable Army into this Pro∣vince
of <HI>Quantung,</HI> that hardly any City, how strong and populous soever, durst
withstand them; but every one endeavor'd (for prevention of her total ruine)
to receive the Conqueror upon the best Terms they could. This <HI>Canton</HI> (re∣lying
upon her invincible Forts and Castle) only bid defiance to the <HI>Tartar:</HI>
the Strength of the Place did not a little encourage the <HI>Chinese</HI> Inhabitants;
but that which chiefly gave them a Resolution to withstand the Enemy was,
that they had one <HI>Iquon</HI> on their side, who Commanded a powerful Fleet,
whereby he daily furnish'd the City with all necessary Provisions; which the
<HI>Tartars</HI> could not hinder, wanting Sea-Forces, and being unskilful in Maritime
Affairs: But the Besiegers being Masters of the Field, spar'd neither pains nor
cost to reduce it by force; they Storm'd the City three times, but were cou∣ragiously
beaten off by the Besieged, with great loss of Men and Arms. This
brave Defence of the Inhabitants made the Siege to last a whole year; and
their strong Garison enabled them to make so many Sallies upon the Besie∣gers,
that they at last found themselves necessitated, either to make one gene∣ral
Assault with their whole Army, or else as Baffled to raise their Leagure.</P>
<P>But among those which did most prejudice to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> were two <HI>Holland</HI>
Gunners, who had Marrid <HI>Chinese</HI> Women, and Setled themselves there; and

through their Advice and Conduct the City held out some Months longer:
but at last the <HI>Tartars</HI> having made a great Breach with their Ordnance in the
Wall of the City, which might have encourag'd them to have made a general
Storm; yet they thought convenient to delay it, until they had corrupted some
of the chief Heads of the City, and had form'd such a Conspiracy therein, that
so they needed not to fear any Miscarriage in the Attempt.</P>
<P><HI>The Vice-Roys who Govern'd over this Kingdom at that time when we
were there, had then the chief Command over the</HI> Tartars: <HI>These endeavor'd
to corrupt the Governor of</HI> Canton <HI>with great Promises, and Sums of Money,
signifying withal unto him these words;</HI> That he should consider into what extream
Danger he was brought, and what Disasters were hanging over his Head; That if so be
he either lov'd himself or his Relations, he should forthwith surrender the City; and this his
Favor they promis'd to requite with eternal Friendship, higher Preferment, and forty thou∣sand
Toel of Silver.</P>
<P>The pusillanimous and faithless <HI>Chinese</HI> Governor, whether that his Heart
misgave him, or the Money and large Promises tempted the Man, so it was,
that though he might very well have defended the City, yet contrary to his
Oath and Honor he made a Promise to the same <HI>Tartarian</HI> Commanders, to
set open a Gate to the Besiegers at an appointed hour; which accordingly he
perform'd.</P>
<P>It was upon the 24. of <HI>November 1650.</HI> when the <HI>Tartars</HI> upon this Advan∣tage
rush'd with their whole Army into the City, which was soon subdu'd by
them, the Besieged not being in a Condition to make any resistance; for no
sooner was the <HI>Tartar</HI> Horse got in, but they rid with great swiftness through
all the Streets, to hinder the <HI>Chineses</HI> from gathering together; and though the
<HI>Chineses</HI> were not inferior in number to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> yet they effected nothing,
being in Disorder, and surpriz'd by the Treachery of their Governor; so that
the best course any could use, was to save himself by flight. The whole <HI>Tartar</HI>
Army being got into the City, the Place was soon turn'd to a Map of Misery;
for every one began to tear, break, and carry away whatsoever he could lay
hands on: The Cry of Women, Children, and Aged People was so great, that
it exceeded all noise of such loud Distractions; so that from the 26. of <HI>Novem∣ber</HI>
to the 15. of <HI>December,</HI> there was heard no other Cry in the Streets, but
<HI>Strike, Kill, and Destroy the rebellious Barbarians;</HI> all places being full of woful
Lamentations, Murder, and Rapine: Those that were able to Ransom,
bought their Lives at dear Rates, and so escap'd the fury of these inhumane
Slaughterers. At last the Vice-Roys, and Chief Commanders of the Army,
upon the sixth of <HI>Winter-Month</HI> did strictly forbid any such cruel Murder to be
committed thence-forward. I was credibly inform'd, that during the space
of 80 days, above eight thousand were kill'd in cold Blood by the <HI>Tartars.</HI>
Some (amongst which the Iesuit <HI>Martinus</HI> is one, in his Book of the <HI>Tartar</HI> War)
say, that there were slain above a hundred thousand; which is not altogether
improbable, in regard of the great number there penn'd up. But although
this City was thus lamentably laid waste, yet through the great care of the
Vice-Roys, it was in a few years after restor'd to its former lustre.</P>
<P>After that the Ambassadors had been three Weeks Aboard, without coming
Ashore all that while, they had leave given to Land with all their Followers,
and were most nobly receiv'd in their former Lodgings; but yet were so nar∣rowly
Guarded by a great number of Foot-Soldiers, that they were not per∣mitted
to go into the Streets.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="29"/>
Two Days after there came a <HI>Mandorin</HI> to them in the Name of the Vice-Roy,
who propos'd to them, <HI>That they (to obtain their Ends in</HI> China) <HI>could not
Present and give to the Emperor's Council at</HI> Peking, <HI>and the Governors at</HI> Canton, <HI>less
than three hundred</HI> Toel <HI>of Silver.</HI> But when the Ambassadors return'd him in
Answer, <HI>That it was not their Design and Intention to buy the Permission of a Free Trade
in</HI> China; <HI>and that it would be much better for them, if their Business must be bought
out with Bribes, to depart forthwith out of</HI> China. Thereupon the <HI>Mandorin</HI> departed
from them much discontented, saying, that he had no farther Order, but
would report back what they had declared; and withal advis'd them to stay
till they should hear farther from <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>When now the Ambassadors for the performance of this heavy and unrea∣sonable
Demand, were call'd upon Day after Day, they concluded to ease
themselves of the continual Clamours of these People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>toel</HI> is 13 <HI>Ducatoons</HI> in Silver.</NOTE> by promising 135 <HI>Toel</HI>
of Silver; but finding that they demanded Interest for the disbursed Moneys,
the Ambassadors resolv'd to depart; but they were prevented by order from
the Vice-Roys, who sent express word, that they must not go away until fur∣ther
Advice were come from <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>But they in the mean time hearing no farther mention made of the Interest,
gave a Note under their Hands for the payment of 136 <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver; where∣with
the Vice-Roys seem'd so well satisfi'd, that they invited the Ambassadors
to a most splendid Feast, upon the 19. of <HI>September:</HI> In an open Plain were
pitch'd ten rich and stately Tents by order of the Vice-Roys, a Draught
whereof you have in the adjoyning <HI>Print:</HI> In the Tent which stood in the
middle sat both the Vice-Roys and the <HI>Teutang</HI> next to one another, upon a
very rich and curious wrought Carpet: The first Tent on the left-hand was
appointed for the Ambassadors, and the other upon the right for the Musici∣ans:
Upon the corners of the Tent of the Ambassadors were plac'd several
Iuglers and Fidlers, who made such a hideous noise with Trumpets and other
Wind-Instruments, that there was no hearing one another speak. The con∣course
of several sorts of Persons (who came out of curiosity from the City
and the adjacent Villages) was so very great, that the whole Plain was co∣ver'd
with People. The Ambassadors were conducted from their Tent in
great State and Pomp, by two of the chief <HI>Mandorins,</HI> into the Presence of the
Vice-Roys; from whence, after some Complements had pass'd between
them, they were re-conducted to their Tents by the same <HI>Mandorins.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time came the Steward of the eldest Vice-Roy crowding
through the People, to whom every one gave way, he being in no small esteem
among them: he had a brave Skie-colour'd Silk Coat on, richly Embroider'd
with Gold and Silver Dragons; and about his Neck hung a Chain of the best
Coral. After this manner the <HI>Mandorins</HI> are Habited, and other Great Persons;
for none of low Degree are suffer'd to wear the like Colour and Habiliments.</P>
<P>This Steward gave order immediately to two of his Attendants to Serve
the Meat up; and caus'd likewise a particular Table to be cover'd for the two
Vice-Roys, as also for the <HI>Teutang,</HI> which were spread with very rich Carpets.
There was likewise another Table prepar'd for the Ambassadors, heap'd with
several sorts of Dishes and Sweet-meats, most delicately order'd to please the
Palat. Upon each Table stood above forty Chargers, all of massie Silver;
some whereof were very artificially wrought, and in each Dish were several
sorts of Viands. The Musick Entertain'd us all Dinner-time, as well Vocal
as Instrumental, much ravishing the Ear. And to shew that we were no
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="29"/>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="30"/>
<PB N="41" REF="30"/>
Novices in this Science, but knew very well how to handle the like Instru∣ments,
the Ambassadors caus'd one of their Followers to give the Vice-Roys a
Lesson upon their own Harpsical, which exceedingly pleas'd them. The chief
Instrument which the <HI>Chineses</HI> use is small, with a few Strings made of Silk,
for Guts or Wyre are not in use among them. The Cittern, or something
like it, which some of them handle well, is very common there: and they
use also a nobler Instrument, much like our Violin, but differing in Sound.
Beside these they have another Instrument call'd <HI>Zunga,</HI> which is much in re∣quest,
and often us'd by them to work upon the Affections of the People. But
above all, they are wonderful expert in the use of Castinetta's, with which
they always Dance. At the beginning of the Dinner there were several Bot∣tles
of <HI>The</HI> or <HI>Tea</HI> brought to the Table, whereof they drank to the Ambassa∣dors,
bidding them welcom. This Drink is made of the Herb <HI>The</HI> or <HI>Cha</HI> after
this manner: They infuse half a handful of the said Herb in fair Water, boyl∣ing
it till a third part be consum'd; to which they add warm Milk about a
fourth part, with a little Salt, and then drink it as hot as they can well en∣dure.
The <HI>Chineses</HI> boast as much of the excellency of this Infusion, as the
Alchymists of the Vertues of their pretended <HI>Elixir.</HI> After the Ambassadors
had drank of this Liquor, the Steward desir'd them to fal to: Opposite to
them sat the Vice-Roys and <HI>Teutang,</HI> who were very merry at Dinner, asking
several Questions concerning the Condition of <HI>Holland,</HI> the Constitution of
the People, their Customs, Manners, Traffick, and Government, with many
other Particulars; which the Ambassadors having fully answer'd, the Vice-Roys
by their Comportment seem'd to be well satisfi'd. At Dinner they
drank to the Ambassadors, desiring them to excuse their mean Entertainment,
and to call for whatsoever they had a mind to. About the middle of the
Treatment the Ambassadors began the Healths of the Vice-Roys in a Glass of
<HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, which pleas'd them so well, that they utterly forsook and relin∣quish'd
their Liquor call'd <HI>Samzou,</HI> which is very pleasant to the Taste, and
not much inferior to any of our Wines: It is made of Rice, and drank by
most of the Grandees in that Country: for the common People use only for
their Drink, the before-mention'd Infusion of Beans; and by the Health and
Constitution of such as use the same, it appears to be a most soveraign and
wholsom Drink. Both these Liquors are drunk very hot, and never offend the
Stomach, though taken even to excess.</P>
<P>It would seem to any a thing almost incredible (unless they had seen it) in
what State and Pomp these Idolaters and Heathen Princes live, and with
what good Orders their People are Govern'd: for as well superior as infe∣rior
Officers in the Courts of the Vice-Roys, which are betwixt two and three
thousand, manage their Affairs with so much quietness and expedition, that
all things were dispatch'd with as much dexterity as in a private Family.
Amongst others that Din'd at the Tables, were the Vice-Roys Children, who
were so civilly Educated, that I never saw any in <HI>Europe</HI> better brought up.
A little before the Dinner was ended they rose from the Table, and as they
pass'd by the Tent of the Vioe-Roys, fell upon their Knees, and bowed with
their Faces three times to the Ground. Dinner being ended, the Ambassadors
took leave of the Vice-Roys, giving them thanks for the great Honor they
had receiv'd; and thereupon they were dismiss'd, and conducted to their
Lodgings by some of the Courtiers, where they spent the rest of the Day in
Mirth and Iollity.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="31"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Teutang</HI> writ to the Imperial Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> that
the Ambassadors were come to offer an Alliance to the Emperor, and had
brought with them very considerable Presents for his Majesty; but receiving
no Answer, the Vice-Roys writ the second time about this Business to the
Court, and signified in plain terms, that the Ambassadors were come thither,
not only to Salute his Royal Majesty, but likewise to procure leave to Traf∣fick
with their Ships in his Territories, and to have Residence there as his
own Subjects.</P>
<P>To these two Letters, after four or five Months expectation, came his Im∣perial
Majesties Answers; the Contents of the first were: <HI>That the</HI> Holland
<HI>Ambassadors, with some few of their Followers, and four Interpreters, should have Licence
to come to</HI> Peking, <HI>to Treat with his Imperial Majesty concerning the number of Ships they
intend to bring to</HI> Canton, <HI>and the time of their coming; but with this Condition, That
the rest of their Followers should remain in their Ships at</HI> Canton, <HI>without raising any
Commerce till the return of the Ambassadors.</HI> But the Contents of the second were
more moderate and pleasing: for in that his Imperial Majesty was pleas'd to
grant a Free Trade in <HI>China</HI> to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> at the Request of the Ambassa∣dors;
for which great Favour his Imperial Majesty did expect the Ambassa∣dors
to come and give him Thanks. Upon this the Ambassadors were Lodg'd
in a far greater House, more commodious for them and their Goods, whilst
they prepar'd themselves for their Voyage to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the second of <HI>November</HI> came the <HI>Tutang</HI> of <HI>Heriju</HI> (hearing of the
Royal Reception and Entertainment which had been given to the Ambassa∣dors)
with several Vessels, very bravely adorn'd with Silk Flags and Penons,
to honor and attend upon them, Anchoring before their House: which the
Ambassadors perceiving, with some of their Followers, went Aboard the Vessel
of the <HI>Tutang,</HI> which was very artificially built, and richly Hung within.
This brave Person immediately desir'd the Ambassadors to sit down, decla∣ring
withal, That he was heartily glad of their coming, and that he was come
on purpose to see and bid them welcom: Then he began to ask with great
curiosity after several weighty Affairs; to which the Ambassadors return'd
him an Answer, wherewith he seem'd sufficiently satisfi'd. The Discourse
being ended, they took leave and return'd to their Lodging: but not long
after they were follow'd by this <HI>Tutang,</HI> accompanied by a great many gallant
<FIGURE>
<PB N="43" REF="31"/>
</FIGURE>
Persons that waited upon him; who Landing at the same time with the Am∣bassadors,
conducted them to their Lodging solemnly in State. This <HI>Tutang</HI>
having visited every thing, gave order for his Drink to be brought Ashore,
and Presented to the Ambassadors, whom he Entertain'd with the shew of
such a strong Inclination and Affection, as if a perpetual Amity had been con∣firm'd
between those Nations: At last, after he had taken leave, he return'd
Aboard his Vessels.</P>
<P>About this time the Inhabitants of the Province of <HI>Quangsi</HI> began to Rebel
and Mutiny against the <HI>Grand Tartar Cham,</HI> or Emperor of <HI>China;</HI> so that for
their suppression and reduction to Obedience a great Army was rais'd, and the
Command thereof given to the young Vice-Roy; who like a prudent and ex∣pert
Captain, had provided all things requisite and necessary for such an Ex∣pedition:
and because order was given to Transport the Army by Water,
this Vice-Roy caus'd several Tents to be pitch'd upon the Margins of the Ri∣ver,
on purpose to accommodate there, at a Treatment, the old Vice-Roy and
Noblemen of the Court at his Farewel: He rid to the Water side, being
mounted on a dapple-gray Horse, with his Quiver of Arrows fastned about
his Middle, and his Hanger by his Side, as is to be seen in the annexed <HI>Print,</HI>
taken from the Life: The Coat he had on was Lin'd with Sables, and the
wrong side outward: He wore a red Cap Lin'd with Sables, behind (which
signifi'd the Royal Dignity, no ordinary Person being suffer'd to wear the
like) hanging the end of a Peacocks Tail: The Saddle-Cloth was Gold-Tissue
Embroider'd; and about his Neck hung three great Tassels, which
touch'd the Ground.</P>
<P>Thus richly Accoutred, he rid to the great <HI>Ionck,</HI> to take his leave there;
which was perform'd with much State and Hilarity. The Grandees were
Treated in several Tents: The Ambassadors had also a Tent provided for
them, where they were most nobly Caressed. The Feast being ended, they
took leave of each other, wishing his Majesty Health and good Success; for
which he return'd thankful Acknowledgments, and so parted.</P>
<P>A few days before his Departure, whilst they were making Preparations
for the Army, this Vice-Roy sent to his Wizards, Sorcerers, and Soothsayers
(to whose Responses the <HI>Chineses</HI> give no small credit) who drawing their Pre∣dictions from the Configurations and Position of the Stars, and from the In∣spection
<PB N="44" REF="32"/>
of the Entrails of Fowls, and the like, for the most part Astrologi∣cally
foretelling good or bad success to the intended Expedition. These Iug∣ling
<HI>Augurers</HI> consulted, and positively told the Vice-Roy, both by Birds and
malignant Aspects, that the whole Undertaking would be unfortunate, and
extremely prejudicial both to himself, the Army, and the Country.</P>
<P>But this young Prince being wholly bent upon the Design, to purchase him∣self
immortal Honor by Prowess and force of Arms, was resolv'd to proceed,
notwithstanding all those great Discouragements from his Fabling Fortune-Tellers;
for so they prov'd, the Success falling out quite contrary, he bringing
under absolute Subjection the whole Province to the <HI>Tartar:</HI> upon which ac∣count
their Vaticination not only proving frivolous, but quite contrary, they
fled, absconding themselves, lest they might suffer at the return of the Vice-Roy,
who would have handled them very severely; but however, they being
absent, the Storm fell on their Idols and Temples, which he rased to the very
Ground, and burnt the Images. In the mean time we return'd with the Am∣bassadors
to our Lodging, where we saw the whole Fleet under Sail (having
the Army Aboard) following the Vice-Roy.</P>
<P>Both these Vice-Roys were of Noble Families, Born and Educated in the
Imperial City of <HI>Peking.</HI> We thought at first that the young Vice-Roy had
been the Son of the old Vice-Roy, but we understood afterwards that they
were nothing akin, but only great Friends, and Princes of one and the same
Power, and who had both undergone one and the same Misfortune: for the
<HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors (for what reason I know not) had beheaded both their Fa∣thers.
The Sons therefore to prevent the like Disaster (which it seems they
dreaded) fled to this Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> which at that time the <HI>Great Cham</HI>
had Invaded with a powerful Army, and had brought most of the Country
under his Obedience. This occasion afforded these young Princes an oppor∣tunity
to revenge their Fathers Deaths upon the Emperor. To effect this,
they endeavor'd to get some Dependence upon the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and grounded their
Complaints to the <HI>Great Cham</HI> upon the Misfortune of their renowned Fami∣lies,
desiring withal Help and Assistance to recover the same by force of Arms.
The <HI>Great Cham</HI> found so many testimonies, and good ground for faithful
Dealing in these Princes, that he conferr'd upon them both great Honor and
Dignity: the eldest he honor'd with the Title of <HI>Pignowan,</HI> and the other
with the Name of <HI>Synowa;</HI> which amongst the <HI>Chineses</HI> are Names of the high∣est
and chiefest Offices of the Kingdom: and such chief Officers Command
and Rule with the same Power over some Provinces, as the Vice-Roys here
in <HI>Europe.</HI> That these warlike Princes have since that time sufficiently reven∣ged
the Deaths of their Fathers upon the <HI>Chineses,</HI> is very apparent, in regard
that in the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> you may ride in some Places for several Miles
together, and not see a Town or Village standing, only great heaps of Stones,
and the Ruines of many Places, which have been formerly very famous for
Trade.</P>
<P>In the mean time we continu'd here for the space of six Weeks without do∣ing
any thing; so that the Year 1655. was not onely expir'd, but two Months
of the next were likewise spent, before any thing remarkable was undertaken:
But soon after the Ambassadors sent to the old Vice-Roy to desire Audience,
and a Pass to go to <HI>Peking;</HI> who thereupon appointed when they should
come. The manner of our going to Audience was thus: Each on Horse∣back,
accompanied with the Mandorin <HI>Poetsiensin,</HI> and the old and new <HI>Heyton:</HI>
<FIGURE>
<PB N="45" REF="32"/>
</FIGURE>
The Followers and Attendants upon the Embassy were order'd to ride before
at a distance: The Ambassadors having presented the Letter writ by the Ge∣neral
<HI>Iohn Maatzuiker</HI> to the Vice-Roy, it was given to the <HI>Heyton,</HI> to be deli∣ver'd
to the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> in regard the Vice-Roy was not to receive any Letter
before the Ambassadors had Saluted his Imperial Majesty at <HI>Peking.</HI> The Au∣dience
being ended, they took leave of the Vice-Roy, and were re-conducted
to their Lodging after the former manner; and the next day a Pass was sent
to carry us to <HI>Peking.</HI> The Vice-Roy understanding that we were ready for
our Iourney, sent to invite the Ambassadors upon the 27. of the same Month,
to a Farewel Dinner: The Galleries, Courts, Halls, and other Places of this
Court, were very artificially and curiously built, and most richly furnish'd
with Pictures, Silk Hangings and costly Carpets. The Vice-Roy for the
greater splendor of the Feast, had invited the <HI>Mandorins</HI> of <HI>Canton,</HI> who were
plac'd next to one another upon a rich Carpet spread upon the floor: At the
entrance into the Room on the right-hand sat the Ambassadors with their Fol∣lowers;
and over against the Ambassadors the Vice-Roy sat alone opposite to
the Ambassadors, being plac'd upon a broad four-square Seat, cover'd with a
curious Carpet, according to the Draught in the annexed <HI>Print,</HI> in a Lemmon-colour'd
Gown, Embroider'd with Golden Dragons; and behind in his Cap
he wore the Badge of Royalty, a Peacocks Tail, about his Neck a Chain of
white Saphirs of great value and in much request, being scarce among the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> and worn as an Ornament of high esteem only by their Nobles and
Persons of great Quality; on his Thumb also he wore an Ivory Ring, as an
Emblem signifying the undaunted Courage of the <HI>Tartar</HI> People, who likewise
use Rings upon their Fingers for the defence of their Hands when they draw
their Bows.</P>
<P>During Dinner, which was order'd in great Pomp and Solemnity, the Vice-Roy
sported with his Children, who were instructed with childish Questions,
taught wanton Reparties, and such Complacencies, to dissipate their Father's
Melancholy. Several young and beautiful Ladies were likewise seated near
the Vice-Roy, to chear up his declining Fancy; who also had the Care and
Government of his Children. The Interpreter told us, that this old Vice-Roy
maintain'd several Married Women, by whom he had fifty six Children,
all then living. The Entertainment being ended, and the Ambassadors highly
<FIGURE>
<PB N="46" REF="33"/>
</FIGURE>
Caressed in solemn manner, took their leaves and departed to their Lodgings.
The next Day the same Persons who had been Treated the Day before at the
Charge of the old Vice-Roy, were invited to the Court of the young Vice-Roy:
and although himself (as above-mention'd) was then departed, and in
his March for <HI>Quangsi,</HI> to reduce those Commotioners there to his Great Ma∣sters
former Obedience, yet his Secretary had order to receive and Treat them
in a most splendid manner; neither omitted he ought that concern'd the Ho∣nor
of his Royal Master: for beside the variety and store of well condimented
Dishes, they were Presented with a Farce of various Entries, Masquerades,
Dancing in the shapes of Lyons, Tygers, Leopards, and other strange Crea∣tures
of their Country, to the extraordinary satisfaction of his Guests.</P>
<P>In the Withdrawing-room where the Ambassadors Din'd, was a Window
on purpose, to which the Mother of the young Vice-Roy often resorted, to
take a view of the Company: She was very neatly and richly Dress'd after
the <HI>Tartar</HI> fashion, middle siz'd, slender, of a brown Complexion, of a plea∣sing
and taking Countenance. At our entrance, before we sat down, we found
standing a very rich painted Chair, which was appointed for her Majesty, to
which in Honor of this great Lady we humbly paid our Respects. Dinner
being ended, and the Complements perform'd, they took Horse and return'd
to their Lodging.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors having prepar'd themselves for their Iourney, resolv'd to
be delay'd no longer at <HI>Canton</HI> with any farther Entertainments; so that with∣in
two days after they went by Water until they came within four Miles of
the City of <HI>Peking.</HI> The Ambassadors had hir'd a very brave Vessel to them∣selves,
having procur'd fifty more at the Emperor's Charge, to carry their
Followers, Presents, and Goods: and in regard it was thought unadvisable
to bring our great Ships any higher up the River, we left them at <HI>Canton,</HI> un∣der
the Commaud of <HI>Francis Lansman.</HI> A certain <HI>Mandorin</HI> nam'd <HI>Pinxenton,</HI> had
by order of the <HI>Teutang</HI> at <HI>Canton</HI> the Command of this whole Fleet, with whom
were joyn'd two <HI>Mandorins</HI> more for his assistance, beside the Mariners, and
such as tugg'd at the Oar. These Vessels were Mann'd with good store of Land-Soldiers,
over whom Commanded two considerable Persons to convey us
with the greater safety to <HI>Peking.</HI> No sooner were the Ambassadors Aboard,
but they caus'd the Princes Flag to be hung out, and the Trumpeters to sound
<FIGURE>
<PB N="47" REF="33"/>
</FIGURE>
the Tune of <HI>Prince William of Nassaw.</HI> There were likewise some Post-Boys
(which is very ordinary in <HI>China)</HI> dispatch'd away before to give notice to the
Magistrates of the respective Towns, of the coming of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ambas∣sadors,
with Orders to have them well receiv'd; which was accordingly
done, till they came to the chief Metropolitan City of <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>We departed upon the 17. of <HI>March</HI> with all our Train from the chief City
of <HI>Canton,</HI> and were Row'd up the River of <HI>Tai,</HI> close to the side of the City,
which shews a most delightful Prospect upon the Water. The small Towns,
which are very numerous in <HI>Peking</HI> and <HI>Canton,</HI> signifi'd our kind Reception
by the thundring voice of their Cannon as we pass'd by.</P>
<P>Having Sail'd and Row'd several Reaches of this broad and spacious River,
we at last left the Channel, and strook into another (an Arm of this great
one, that disembogues it self into the same) toward the North. The <HI>Chineses</HI>
call this Branch <HI>Zin,</HI> but those of <HI>Europe, The European Stream.</HI></P>
<P>We made so much speed that Day, that toward the Evening we came to a
Village call'd <HI>Sahu.</HI> This Place, though not very large nor famous, yet is of
pleasant Situation, and about six Miles from <HI>Canton:</HI> the Soil is very fruitful,
and encompass'd with Trees, Hills, and Vales. There are several good Edifi∣ces
in this Place, though most of them inhabited by Peasants and Handicrafts∣men,
which are chiefly Silk-weavers, who live by Weaving great quantities
of Silk-Stuffs for the Merchants at <HI>Canton.</HI> We stay'd here all Night, and in
the Morning early set Sail.</P>
<P>Upon the 19. of <HI>March</HI> we came to an Anchor before the City of <HI>Xantung,</HI>
being the eleventh small City belonging to the Chief City of <HI>Canton,</HI> and lying
distant from thence about twenty Miles.</P>
<P>This City on the right side of the River lies in a very pleasant Vale, and is
surrounded on the Land side with delightful Pastures and Hills: It is not very
large, but was formerly exceeding populous and full of Trade. We got thus
far, sometimes with Rowing, Sailing, and Towing against the Stream, which
had so tir'd the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who were put to this slavish Labor, that we were ob∣lig'd
to stay by the Way till they had rested and refresh'd themselves. The
Magistrate of the Place caus'd the side of the River to be Guarded with two
Foot-Companies, to welcom and receive the Ambassadors with the more
State: They sent likewise a few Presents for the Ambassadors Table; but
<PB REF="34"/>
they understanding it was all upon the Emperors Account, and by his Order,
who allow'd ten times more than what they sent, thought good to refuse their
Civilities both here and in all other Places where they came, which they did
with great Respects. Here we went Ashore, which was the first time since
we came Aboard, and pitch'd a Tent at a little distance from the City, upon
the side of the River, in an open and plain Field. The <HI>Tartars</HI> in the mean
time, to shew some Pastime, Exercis'd their Arms before the Tent of the
Ambassadors, which was perform'd by them with much dexterity.</P>
<P>Among the rest there was one with a Bow and Arrow, who was so rare a
Marks-man, that he shot thrice together through the White, no broader than
the Palm of a Hand, at the distance of thirty five Paces; for which he was
rewarded with a small piece of Money.</P>
<P>The Secretary of the Vice-Roy (for the more safety, and for the greater
splendor, having conducted us thus far) took leave and went back for <HI>Can∣ton;</HI>
but was most nobly Treated by the Ambassadors the Night before.
We on the other hand made all things ready, and set Sail again with fair
Wind and Weather, but were forc'd to be Tow'd up the River, being against
the Stream, and narrow, into which fall several Torrents from the adjacent
Hills; so that we went but very slowly, and that with great labor and trou∣ble,
which these poor Creatures are fain to undergo.</P>
<P>Here we saw into what a miserable Condition the <HI>Chineses</HI> were reduced by
the last War of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who put them upon this slavish labor of Towing
and Rowing their Boats, using them worse than Beasts at their pleasure,
without any exception of Persons, either young or old.</P>
<P>Often the track'd ways on the River side are so narrow, uneven and steep,
that if they should slip, they would infallibly break their Necks, as many times
it happens: now and then they walk up to the Middle in Water, and if any
of them grow faint and weary, there is one that follows, having Charge of
the Boat, who never leaves beating of them, till they go on or die. But these
poor Creatures are no where so miserably harassed out, as in this dangerous
and steep mountainous part of <HI>Sangwanhab;</HI> on which account perhaps none
will or dare live there: for we saw there but one poor despicable Village,
where some few People dwell, whose Countenances sufficiently declar'd what
Hardships they underwent.</P>
<P>The most ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> who formerly subdu'd whole Coun∣tries,
never dealt so barbarously by those whom they conquer'd, as these un∣merciful
<HI>Tartars,</HI> who by their cruel usage in this last Invasion, have not only
laid waste abundance of noble Cities, Towns, and Villages (which are now
places for Birds and Beasts to roost in) but they have likewise made Slaves of
the best of the Natives.</P>
<P>Upon the 21. of <HI>March</HI> about Midnight, we came with all our Train to <HI>Sany∣vum.</HI>
The Magistrates of this Place met us on the Way, and with their respe∣ctive
Salutes Presented us for the Table, which for the reason aforesaid, were
not accepted. This Place is not very large, lying about forty Miles distant,
from <HI>Xanxui,</HI> and was formerly for its Situation potent and populous, but in
this last War wholly ruin'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who gave the same usage to all
such Cities as were not able to withstand them.</P>
<P>Here we got fresh Track-men (our old ones being quite tir'd) to draw us
up the River against the Stream and Torrents, which fall from this wonderful
Mountain <HI>Sagwanhab.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="34"/>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>The heighth of this Mountain is very observable, for the tops thereof are
envelop'd with Clouds, which makes the Passage at the bottom of the Hill
obscure.</P>
<P>On one side of this prodigious Mountain stands an Idol Temple, richly
adorn'd, and most artificially built; to which these poor Creatures resort,
conceiving all their welfare to consist in Offering to this Idol, adoring it as
their Preserver. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> up by Steps to this Temple, which stands on that

<P>There are several strange Mountains and Hills found in <HI>China,</HI> but none are

heighth.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Xunte,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> second small City of <HI>Canton,</HI> lies a Mountain call'd <HI>Lun∣gnien,</HI>

are found certain rough Stones of strange and wonderful shapes, which the

<P>Near to <HI>Tangnon,</HI> the third small City of <HI>Canton,</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Tahi,</HI> up∣on

the Mountain <HI>Heuteu,</HI> which serves such Skippers as are bound for the Pro∣vince

<P>Near to <HI>Cingyuen,</HI> the seventh small City of <HI>Canton,</HI> lies a great Mountain
call'd <HI>Talo,</HI> which is surrounded with steep and sharp Tops; among which
lie rich and pleasant Meadows, where dwell several wild and unciviliz'd Peo∣ple,
who oftentimes make Inroads upon the adjacent Places, to steal what
they can. These wild and irregular People live according to their own
Laws, without any subjection to the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>Near to the sixth small City of <HI>Canton</HI> lies a Mountain call'd <HI>Yaimuen.</HI> From
this Mountain the last Emperor of the Race of <HI>Sunga</HI> (after that the <HI>Tartars</HI> had
Conquer'd him, and driven him out of the Country) flung himself headlong
out of despair into the Sea.</P>
<P>We were three days hovering up and down before we could get from among
these strange and solitary Mountains, and saw in all that time but one poor
Village, call'd <HI>Quantonlow,</HI> which lies so lonely, that 'tis strange how any Peo∣ple
durst live in it. In some places of this Island, between the Hills (which is
very remarkable) lie several pleasant and fruitful Corn-Fields.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="35"/>
Upon the 24. of <HI>March</HI> we came to a certain small City call'd <HI>Yntag,</HI> the
sixth small City of the second Chief City of the Province of <HI>Quantung.</HI> Here
we were necessitated to let fall our Anchor, in regard of the violent Stream,
and the great Torrents which fall from the Hills; for those that Tow'd the
the Boats being quite spent, we were forc'd to give them some rest to recover
their Strength again. This violent and strong Stream had driven the Vessel
of the Ambassadors against a blind Rock, which did very much endanger the
loss both of Ship and Goods.</P>
<P>This small City lies very pleasant upon a corner of the River on the right
side, over against the Mountain <HI>Sangwonhab:</HI> It is fortifi'd with high and indif∣ferent
strong Walls, and beautifi'd with stately Houses, and magnificent Idol
Temples, surrounded with pleasant Hills, delightful in Prospect, the Suburbs
well and sufficient: It was formerly very rich and populous, and is provi∣ded
with a safe Harbor for Vessels against the impetuous Current of this Ri∣ver;
which is a great protection to them in Stormy Weather, passing up and
down. At the entrance of the Harbor on the right side, appears a very high
Tower, built with great curiosity.</P>
<P>The next Day, being the 25. of <HI>March,</HI> we came in sight of that wonderful
and strange Idol Temple call'd <HI>Koniansiam,</HI> which the <HI>Chineses</HI> hold in great
veneration, bringing as rich and fat Offerings thither, as to that of <HI>Sangwonhab:</HI>
It lies on the River side, in a solitary, wild, and mountainous Country: your
first Approaches conduct you up with convenient Stone Steps; after you
make your Way through blind Paths and cavernous Passes, forc'd with much
Art and Industry. These Idolaters believing as the ancient <HI>Heathen,</HI> that
Groves and high Places were most venerable Mansions, and yielding a more
reverential Awe to their Gods, and less discovering under a Shade their
Priests jugling Impostures. We continu'd here a while with all our Fleet, till
the Natives had perform'd their Devotions at this Temple, which afterward
our Ambassadors visited. 'Tis incredible to relate, with how much supersti∣tious
Zeal, wanting our true Lights, they pour forth there their Ejaculations,
and as freely their Bounty, offering prodigally their Country Products of all
sorts of Fruits, Birds, and Beasts.</P>
<P>Upon the 27. of <HI>March</HI> in the Evening, we Landed at a Place call'd by the
<HI>Chineses, Mongley,</HI> with a most pleasant Prospect at a distance, and accommo∣dated
with stately Sone Steps, conveying you from the Water-side to the
Gate entring the City, which is vested with high Walls, and fortifi'd with tall
Bulwarks and Watch-Towers. It is wondrous pleasant to view from the
Battlements of this City, the adjacent Countries, thick shrowded with de∣lightful
Woods and mantling Pastures. In regard our Drudges were quite
tir'd out with Towing their Boats against the impetuous Stream, we got
fresh Yoke-men from hence; but we were no sooner under Sail, but the Am∣bassadors
Vessel run against a blind Rock under Water, which had like to have
endanger'd the loss both of Ship and Goods. The next Day having pass'd
some Villages, we came to an Anchor in pleasant Riding, where the <HI>Mandorin
Pinxenton</HI> Treated us with their beloved <HI>The.</HI></P>
<P>In the Night following hapned a most hideous Tempest, that wonderfully
terrifi'd and amaz'd us all; such peals of Thunder, such flashes of Lightning,
that we suppos'd them to be dreadful Ushers to the <HI>Day of Iudgment;</HI> inso∣much
that the Vessel in which were the Emperor's Presents, drove from her
Anchors, I my self being in imminent danger: With the approaching Dawn
<FIGURE>
<PB N="51" REF="35"/>
</FIGURE>
we had a sad review of our several Disasters, many Ships shatter'd by the
Storm, some Mastless Hulls, all their Tackle and Rigging torn and spent,
others driven Ashore, there stav'd and beaten in pieces, and all their Men
drown'd.</P>
<P>It was upon the 29. of <HI>March,</HI> when we came with the remainder of our Fleet
before the second Chief City of <HI>Xaocheu.</HI> This City lies about thirty Miles
from <HI>Yntag,</HI> upon an Angle near the side of the River: In regard of its Situa∣tion
and safe Harbor of Shipping, they have a very great Trade by Naviga∣tion.
Toward the South this River has several Names, and is call'd <HI>Scian,</HI>
and sometimes <HI>Scio,</HI> and has its Source out of the River <HI>Chin</HI> and <HI>Va,</HI> which
both run into one not far from this City. The Place where these two Waters
meet, is well known by the <HI>Chinese</HI> Skippers to their sorrow, because of the im∣petuous
violence of the Streams, and the many blind Rocks which skulk un∣der
Water, on which in stress of Weather they often suffer Shipwrack. The
<HI>Chineses</HI> to avoid this Danger (according to their Custom) have built here an
Idol Temple by the Water-side, which is always first visited by such as intend
to pass this Way; where they offer what they have, to be protected in their
Voyage, by the indulgence of this their favouring God. The City lies sur∣rounded
on one side with high and delightful Hills; and on the East side over
the Water has a Suburb, which is very populous, rich, and well built: in the
middle of the Water stands a Tower artificially built upon a small Rock, ac∣cording
to the old fashion of the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>In view of this City spreads a most pleasant Valley, which seems Wall'd in
with various Fruit-bearing Trees: Not far from which, upon the <HI>Mauhoa,</HI>
stands a Cloister, neighbor'd by a spacious Temple, in which reside many of
their Idolatrous Priests. A Person call'd <HI>Luzu</HI> (who had by his Fasting and
austere Life, got himself so great a Repute among the vulgar Throng, that af∣ter
his Death they honor'd him as a Saint) built this Cloister at his own
Charge. This St. <HI>Luzu</HI> (as they reported) wore Day and Night upon his na∣ked
Body Iron Chains, and spent all his time to Grind and Sift Rice for the
Monks: These Iron Fetters had made deep impressions into his Flesh, which
was thereby so putrifi'd for want of Dressing and looking after, that Nests of
Worms crawl'd in the uncleansed Wounds, of which he would not suffer one
to be taken off: for whensoever any of his verminous Brood dropt off, he
<FIGURE>
<PB N="52" REF="36"/>
</FIGURE>
would take it up again, and say, <HI>Have you not sufficient to Feast your selves left?
why then forsake you my Body where you are welcom, and thus run away?</HI> Whose Corps,
as the Inhabitants inform us, is still preserv'd in this Place.</P>
<P>That this was formerly a noble City, full of stately Buildings, the many
great Ruines signifie: there yet remains an indifferent Wall about it, but
within nothing but Ruine and a heap of Stones. We pitch'd our Tents near
unto the Walls, where we had a fair Reception by the Magistrates and Gover∣nor,
who brought several Presents for the Ambassadors Table; which were
accepted by the Ambassadors, being not put upon the Emperor's Account.
After they had Saluted each other, and discours'd of several Affairs, they were
most nobly receiv'd by the Ambassadors, who Treated them with so much
Respect, that they were highly pleas'd, and promis'd to requite their Kind∣ness
upon all occasions; which done, they took leave, and return'd again to
the City.</P>
<P>In the Morning early we weighed from thence, and had not long been un∣der
Sail, but we drew near a Mountain, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> for its strange shape
and form call <HI>Five Horses Heads.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Pinacles of these Hills, which are envelop'd with Clouds, we
saw here and there several strange, as well small as great Edifices standing;
some of them were entire, others decay'd and ruinous, built time out of
mind. But that which seem'd most remarkable, was the Situation of those
Buildings, which were erected upon such high and steep places altogether in∣accessible,
that none could imagine a possible Way for these People to carry
up their Materials. We were very desirous to have had a nearer view of these
Houses and Inhabitants there; but we found by experience after some small
trial of clambering up, that our Attempts were in vain.</P>
<P>We were no sooner past this Mountain of the <HI>Five Horses Heads,</HI> but we fell
among other Rocks and steep Ascents, which we made a shift to escape,
though with great danger, the River being full of lurking split Ships lying un∣der
Water; therefore the Inhabitants call these Rocks <HI>The Five ugly Devils.</HI></P>
<P>At last we got safe to the last Country of <HI>Suytjeen,</HI> where the Mountain of
the <HI>Five Horses Heads</HI> shews it self very wonderfully to the Eye at a distance;
but much more the tops of the Hills of <HI>Suytjeen,</HI> which stand in such order upon
the River, as if Art and not Nature had plac'd them there. Amongst these
<PB N="53" REF="36"/>
Mountains lie several pleasant Vales in most delightful Prospect, being well
replenish'd with Fruit-Trees and Herbage.</P>
<P>Upon the fourth of <HI>April</HI> we came in sight of the famous City of <HI>Namhun</HI>
(the third Chief City of this Province) and immediately went Ashore. This
Metropolis lies about forty Miles from <HI>Xaocheu,</HI> and is the outward Frontier
of the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> which we had thus travers'd from South to
North.</P>
<P>The Governor and Magistrates of this City having notice of the coming
of the Ambassadors, sent a Letter full of Complements, to assure them of a
cordial Welcom. Not long after they address'd themselves in Person; who
(after that the Ceremony of Complements had been reciprocally return'd)
earnestly desir'd of the Governor and Magistrates, that good order might be
given for the speedy furthering of their Iourney to <HI>Peking;</HI> which they pro∣mis'd
should be done, The Ambassadors to requite their Civilities, Treated
them nobly; for which they return'd their Thanks, and having taken their
leave, went back in the Evening to the City.</P>
<P>The next day the Ambassadors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambas∣sadors noble Entertain∣ment in this City.</NOTE> with all their Followers, were invited by
the Governor to a most splendid Dinner, who sent them his Gentlemen to
meet them at the Gate of the City, and conduct them to his House, where he
waited their coming, with the rest of the Magistrates, and some of the chief
Commanders of the Army. The Entertainment was every way answerable
to the Quality of the Persons, as well of the Guests as the Inviters: The Go∣vernor
and the Magistrates sat all at one side of the Table, that the Sewers
might the better remove the Dishes and Chargers, without any disturbance to
the Company, which were not Serv'd up all at once (according to the custom
of the <HI>Chineses)</HI> but only two at a Course, which was the single Allowance for
one Person: And when the Steward, who waited always at the Governor's
Elbow, had given the Word, every one fell to what he most fancied; and
when he observ'd a cessation at the first Course, he made a Sign, and immedi∣ately
the Dishes were shifted, which was done at least sixteen times, observing
the same order as at first.</P>
<P>During the Feast, there was both Vocal and Instrumental Musick, the bet∣ter
to Entertain the Invited to their satisfaction. A little before the Banquet
was brought in, they arose and recreated themselves in the Garden, till the
Dishes were plac'd, and then they return'd and sat down as before: And
when all was taken away, every one drew out a piece of Money, which toge∣ther
was to be divided among the Musicians and Attendants: This Colle∣ction
or Gathering they laid at the Governor's Feet, to be by him dispos'd of.
The Ambassadors likewise Presented them with six <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver, and some
Silk-Stuffs, which the Governor at first refus'd, but at last at their Entreaty ac∣cepted
it.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Namhun</HI> is very large, well situated, and fortifi'd with Walls and
Bulwarks, and divided by the River, over which is a Bridge, for the conve∣niency
of passage from one part to another: It is also full of Idol-Temples,
and brave Structures. We saw here several Houses, whose Doors were in∣scrib'd
with the Letters of the Name of our <HI>Saviour.</HI> Here is also the Empe∣ror's
Custom-house, where they receive his Dues for all Goods Exported or
imported; their Bills of Lading being usually accepted on their Words,
saving the double diligence and charge of Searchers, and discomposing their
Goods as in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="37"/>
There is no better Mold in all <HI>China</HI> for the making of any Earthen Ware,
than is about this City. Not far from hence is a River, by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd
<HI>Mekiang,</HI> which signifies <HI>Ink-Water,</HI> whose blackness it much resembles. The
<HI>Chineses</HI> much esteem of the Fish taken in this River, which are commonly ve∣ry
white, considering the darkness of the Water.</P>
<P>It is very troublesom Travelling by Land in those Parts, because of the
high Hills and rugged Ascents: but the most troublesom Mountain of all to
Travel over, was that which the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Muglin,</HI> which one of the
Governors levell'd at his own Charge, and is now very passable either for
Horse or Foot; for which the Inhabitants erected to his Honor a stately
Temple, Presenting rich Offerings and costly Perfumes to the Idol there re∣siding.</P>
<P>We were four Days preparing for our Iourney from <HI>Namhun</HI> to <HI>Nangan,</HI>
because of the troublesom, and almost inaccessible Mountains: At last ha∣ving
got all things ready, we set forward upon the eighth Instant, with some
of the Emperor's Presents: But before we began our Iourney, we sent the
<HI>Mandorin</HI> of the young Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton</HI> before, to provide Lodgings and
other Necessaries at <HI>Nangan</HI> for their further Iourney; and some of their Fol∣lowers
were order'd to stay till next Day, to look to such Goods as could not
be carried the Day before with the Ambassadors: There was likewise order
given, that each Carriage should have a yellow Flag, with the Emperor's and
Ambassadors Names written upon them, to save Strangers Inquisition; and,
for their greater ease and accommodation, they were carried over the Moun∣tains
in Horse-Litters: And in regard the Ways were dangerous, and much
molested with Robbers and Highway-men, the Governor appointed them a
Life-Guard of 150 Horse, to conduct them safe over the Mountains; so that,
what with those that carried the Goods, and this Guard, we made a Regiment
of at least 600.</P>
<P>The next Day, being the ninth, such as were left behind at <HI>Namhun</HI> set also
forward. The Ambassadors Lodg'd upon these Mountains, in a Village call'd
<HI>Susan,</HI> about half way over, but found no body in the Place, except an Offi∣cer,
with some Soldiers that kept Watch there; who could hardly furnish us
with a little Rice, Hogs-flesh, and strong Drink, the Inhabitants having forsa∣ken
their Houses, frighted by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day, early in the Morning, they took Horse, and rode from
thence, and about Noon came to that strange and narrow Mountain which
lies betwixt the Provinces of <HI>Quantung</HI> and <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> and separates both these
Provinces from each other. Upon this Mountain we saw several fair Idol-Temples,
very curiously built. This Mountain, though no better than a
Wilderness, yet is very delightful, by reason of the variety of Woods and
Valleys.</P>
<P>We made so much haste that Day, that we got by Night to <HI>Nangan,</HI> the
thirteenth Chief City of the eighth Province of <HI>Kiangsi.</HI> But before I proceed
I shall relate unto you the number of the great and small Cities, and the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dition,
Qualities, and Humor of the Inhabitants of this Province of <HI>Kiangsi.</HI></P>
<P>Toward the East and South-East this Province has for Frontiers the Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Chekiang</HI> and <HI>Foking;</HI> South and South-West, <HI>Quantung</HI> and <HI>Quangsi;</HI>
toward the West, <HI>Fukang;</HI> and toward the North <HI>Nanking.</HI> Toward the
South appear in this Province mighty broad and high Hills: for the Moun∣tains
of three Provinces, as <HI>Kiangsi, Quantung,</HI> and <HI>Fokien,</HI> joyn and meet all
<PB N="55" REF="37"/>
in one here: And upon these Mountains live a wild and barbarous sort
of People, who maintain themselves most by Plundering and Stealing from
the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>This part is full of Gold, Silver, Lead, Iron, and Tin-Mines, and envi∣ron'd
with very steep Mountains, replenish'd with several Lakes and running
Rivers: 'Tis a very fruitful Soil, and exceeding populous, insomuch that the
Province is not sufficient to contain the Inhabitants; and therefore many of
them leave their native Country, and for want of convenient Dwelling-pla∣ces,
Seat themselves in other Parts of <HI>China,</HI> where they use some mean Han∣dicraft
Trade, or else turn Soothsayers or Iuglers, to which they are naturally
much addicted: They are generally possess'd with a belief of the <HI>Pythagorean</HI>
Doctrine of the <HI>Transmigration of Souls;</HI> for they hold it a mortal Sin to kill
any living Creature, or to eat any thing that is dead.</P>
<P>In this Province of <HI>Kiangsi</HI> are thirteen Chief Cities, which Command over
67 small ones; and through the midst of it, from South to North, runs the
River <HI>Can,</HI> from whence spring several Navigable Streams, so that you may
take Shipping from or to any part thereof.</P>
<P><HI>The thirteen principal Cities are these;</HI> Nanchang, Iaocheu, Quanglin, Nan∣kang,
Kienkiang, Kienchang, Vucheu, Linkiang, Kiegan, Xuicheu, Iuencheu, Cancheu,

<P>According to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Account, there are in this Province 1363629 Fa∣milies,

<P>Thus much concerning the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> and the number of the great
and small Cities; I shall now relate what hapned in our Travels through this
Province to that of <HI>Nanking.</HI></P>
<P>No sooner were the Ambassadors arriv'd at the Gate of the Chief City of
<HI>Nangan,</HI> but a Gentleman was immediately dispatch'd to Complement them
in the Name of the Magistrates, and conduct them to those Lodgings which
were provided for them. A while after came the Governor himself, with
some other Persons of great Quality, who after Civilities interchanged, fell
into some Discourses of small importance; and having thus spent an hour,
they took their leaves and departed, sending a handsom Treatment that
Night at the Charge of the City.</P>
<P>Afterwards came to us two <HI>Tartar</HI> Gentlemen, who were newly arrived
there from the Imperial City of <HI>Peking;</HI> and after they had Saluted the Am∣bassadors,
they told them that they were sent to Congratulate the Vice-Roys of
<HI>Canton,</HI> upon their Victory obtain'd the last Year against the <HI>Chineses,</HI> in the
Province of <HI>Quangsi;</HI> they then took their leaves and departed, seeming much
to admire the large and tall Statures of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and that they should
come from the end of the World to Salute their Emperor; adding withal,
That his Imperial Majesty expected them with great impatience.</P>
<P>During our abode here, we were often visited, and receiv'd the friendly
Salutations of the best and chiefest of the City.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors were here very much troubled to procure Vessels to carry
them to <HI>Nanking;</HI> for though they did earnestly insist to prosecute and hasten
their Iourney, yet the Commissioner appointed to furnish them with Boats,
could not get them ready so soon as he desir'd: whereupon the Mandorin
<HI>Pinxenton</HI> rated him with such bitter Expressions, that taking it to heart, he
drew his Knife, and would certainly have stabb'd himself, had he not been
prevented by one of the <HI>Mandorin</HI>'s Servants.</P>
<P>The Country about this City (which is the farthest City of this Province)
is very pleasant and fruitful, surrounded with Hills and Mountains, which
serve for a Fence to Guard the Country. One of these Mountains far exceeds
the rest for delightfulness, being call'd <HI>Sihoa,</HI> which signifies <HI>A Place of Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="38"/>
This City is divided into two equal Parts, by an Arm of the River <HI>Chang;</HI>
which being situate on the Stream, causes great Trading there for all the
Goods and Merchandises which are brought out of <HI>China,</HI> and carried to the
Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> or from thence to the other Places of Trade which lie
higher up in the Country, are for the most part unladed in this City, from
whence they are carried to other Parts by Land or Water.</P>
<P>The South part of this City is close built with several goodly Houses, and
is full of Commerce and People: On the North side stands an Idol-Temple,
very curiously built, and so richly adorn'd, that a second <HI>Dedalus</HI> may be said
to have shewn his Art in the contrivance of this Edifice. However, in bigness
and strength this City stands not in competition with that of <HI>Nanhung,</HI> al∣though
the <HI>Tartars</HI> in their last Invasion were more favourable to this than to
the other; for in <HI>Nangan</HI> they forbore to destroy such Fabricks as were of any
note, but in <HI>Nanhung</HI> all were ruin'd. Besides, the great Commerce and Traf∣fick
which has been of late Years driven here, has been a means to enrich the
Inhabitants thereof, who have continually contributed toward the re-edifying
of this City.</P>
<P>After four Days abode in this City, the Ambassadors Embarqu'd themselves
with all their Followers, to pursue their Voyage to <HI>Peking.</HI> From the City of
<HI>Canton</HI> to <HI>Nanhung</HI> we were Tow'd all the way against the Stream by Track-men,
not without great danger of Shipwrack, by reason of many Rocks that
lie hid under Water; but now we were carried down with the Stream, though
yet not without great labor, and danger of often losing both Ship and Goods.
The River <HI>Can</HI> runs here as swift as an Arrow from the Bow, and is full of
Banks, Sands, and Shoals, which requires much care and experience in the
Mariners. It hapned in this Passage among other Accidents, that the Barque
in which <HI>Iacob de Keizer,</HI> one of the Ambassadors had Embarqu'd himself, with
the Presents to the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> fell into a Whirl-pool, and turning and wind∣ing
amongst unsteady Eddies, drove at last on a hidden Sand, where she stuck
fast, and could not be gotten off until they had unladen her: they then per∣ceiv'd
that she had two great Leaks in her Hull, which they made shift to
stop, putting the Goods Aboard again, and so we proceeded on our Iourney.
The <HI>Mandorins</HI> commanded the Water-men to be severely Lash'd with a thick
Leather Whip; and the Master himself had not escap'd the same Punishment
for his neglect, if the Ambassadors had not interceded for him.</P>
<P>The next Day being the 14. of <HI>April,</HI> we pass'd by the second small City
call'd <HI>Nankang,</HI> but did not Land as we went; but in our Return put Ashore.</P>
<P>This <HI>Nankang</HI> lies upon the left side of the River <HI>Chang:</HI> It is built four-square,
being invested with a strong Wall twenty five Foot high, and was for∣merly
rich, and famous for Commerce: It hath four Gates, each about a
quarter of a Mile distant one from another. This City was totally subverted
by the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the last War. On the River side stands a strong high Tower,
the Structure well built. At our return we lay with our Vessels before <HI>Nam∣mon,</HI>
which signifies <HI>The South-Gate;</HI> from whence a Street leads to the House
of the Governor; and at the end of the Street stands a <HI>Chinese</HI> Triumphal Arch,
an elaborate Piece, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> left without any demolishment: At the
end of this Street is the Market-place, to which is brought daily all manner of
Provisions, as Flesh, Fish, and Fruits of all sorts in great abundance.</P>
<P>Upon the 15. we came to <HI>Cancheu,</HI> the twelfth Chief City of the Province of
<HI>Kiangsi,</HI> where we took up our Lodgings for that Night; and were visited
<PB N="58" REF="39"/>
Aboard our Vessels by some great <HI>Mandorins,</HI> who welcom'd us in the Name of
the Magistrates; after which the Ambassadors address'd themselves to the
great <HI>Tutang</HI> of this City, returning him the like Complemental Civilities,
who receiv'd them with singular Courtesies and seem Affection, and con∣ducted
them into his private Apartment, where he plac'd them on his right
Hand: Then he ask'd them several Questions concerning the Constitution
of <HI>Holland,</HI> viz. <HI>Of how many Provinces it consisted, and how remote from Portugal?
How long their present Government had been Establish'd? When that Power began? Whe∣ther
they were all of one and the same Religion?</HI> and <HI>Whether they us'd Beads in their
Ejaculations after the</HI> Portugese <HI>manner?</HI> To each of which Particulars the Ambas∣sadors
return'd them a brief and satisfactory Answer. By these Questions we
guess'd what a near Community and Commerce there was between this
Lord and the <HI>Portugueses;</HI> and we were likewise afterwards told, that his Wife
had been Baptiz'd by them. Whilst we were drinking of <HI>Thea</HI> in the With∣drawing-room,
he desir'd to hear our Trumpets sound in the Hall, with which
he was exceeeingly pleas'd; and also seem'd much to admire our Arms: And
because this <HI>Tutang</HI> (who held his Residence and Court in this Chief City) had
the Command over the Provinces of <HI>Kiangsi, Fokien, Hucang,</HI> and <HI>Quantung,</HI>
and consequently was not much inferior to a Vice-Roy; and that the Ships
of our <HI>East-India Company,</HI> bound from <HI>Iapan</HI> to <HI>Taiwan,</HI> often supply'd them∣selves
here with much fresh Water; (for the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> is all Maritime,
lying opposite to the other Island of <HI>Formosa)</HI> therefore the Ambassadors con∣cluded
to offer him some Presents; but he refus'd them with great Civility,
alledging, <HI>That the</HI> Tartar <HI>Government would not permit any Presents to be receiv'd
from any Foreign People, till they had made their Appearance at the Court before his Impe∣rial
Majesty.</HI> He likewise added, <HI>That he did not refuse them out of a</HI> Chinese <HI>Dis∣simulation,
but only to observe the Custom of their Country;</HI> and assur'd the Ambassa∣dors,
that in their Return from <HI>Peking,</HI> all manner of Friendship should be
shewn them.</P>
<P>This <HI>Cancheu,</HI> in regard of the great Income and Revenue arising yearly
from the Trade that is driven there, is one of the Chief Cities in the Province
of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> and Commands over twelve small Cities: It lies about sixty Miles
from <HI>Canton,</HI> close to the side of the River <HI>Can,</HI> which takes its source near to
the eighth small City call'd <HI>Xuikin,</HI> and flows from thence Northward up to
<HI>Cancheu.</HI> The City is four-square, as <HI>Nankang,</HI> and is surrounded with a high
Stone Wall about two Miles compass: There are four Gates also to this
City, which are call'd after the four Winds. We lay all Night in our Barques
before the Western Gate. The Streets of the City are handsomly Pav'd. On
the East-end stands a high well-built Tower, from the top of which you have
a full Prospect of the City and adjacent Countries, which are wondrous plea∣sant.
The Burgers Houses and Dwellings are built in good order, among
which are some very large ones well furnish'd; but the Palace of the Gover∣nor
exceeds all the rest.</P>
<P>Among other stately Edifices, this Place abounds in curious Idol-Temples,
very richly adorn'd with Pictures and Graven Images; but there is one espe∣cially
(whose Top stands higher, crowning all the rest) which may be rec∣kon'd
among the chiefest Temples in all <HI>China,</HI> and is call'd <HI>Kuil, Kiasti, Miao;
Miao</HI> signifying <HI>A Church,</HI> and <HI>Kuil Kiasti</HI> being the peculiar Name of the Idol
they here worshipp'd.</P>
<P>On the Verges of this Idol-Temple stood several Bedsteads for Travellers,
<FIGURE>
<PB N="59" REF="39"/>
</FIGURE>
and Priests that come to Offer, to Lodge in; as in most Places the Idolatrous
Edifices serve for Inns to receive and harbor Strangers in. In the Porch of this
Temple stood on each side two Giants of Plaister-work, the one Fighting
with a Dragon, and the other having a Dwarf lying under his Feet, with a
drawn Sword in his Hand: The signification of these two Figures may be
easily understood by those who have but small skill in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters
and Emblems. On the other side of the River stands another Temple upon a
high Hill, which I went to see early in the Morning, and found the same
situated in a very pleasant Place, to which you ascend by Stone Steps. Not
far from hence stands a small Chappel rarely built, according to the <HI>Chinese</HI>
Model; whereas such as Travel this way, Offer something to this Idol for a
safe Passage, and preservation from the hidden Rocks and Sands, whereof
there lie many in the River <HI>Can;</HI> which if they escape, they attribute their
Success solely to these Offerings; but if they happen to miscarry, then they lay
the blame on themselves, that either they made no true Confession, or brought
Gifts too mean for this their Deity.</P>
<P>At the Place where the two Rivers <HI>Chang</HI> and <HI>Can</HI> meet and conjoin, cross
the Stream lies a long Bridge of Boats, cover'd over with Planks: At the end
of the Bridge stands a Toll-house for the receipt of Custom.</P>
<P>Upon the 18. of <HI>April</HI> we pass'd by the ruinous and deplorable City of <HI>Van∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngam.</HI>
This City lies close to the side of the River <HI>Can,</HI> on the right hand,
in a very fruitful and pleasant Soil. The <HI>Tartars</HI> were so cruel to this Place in
the last War, that they left nothing standing that was any ways remarkable: It
appears to have been a wondrous delightful Place, very accurately built, and
full of Inhabitants. The Country round about this City, produces twice a year
great store of Fruit to the Husbandman: And not far from hence lies a Hill
which has Silver-Mines, but the <HI>Chineses</HI> are forbidden by their Laws to dig
for any Silver.</P>
<P>On the East-side of this City is a Mountain call'd <HI>Chao,</HI> whose Top reaches
up to the Clouds; and though of this vast heighth, yet from the bottom to
the top there grow all sorts of Trees and Herbs, which made us a delightful
Prospect at a distance.</P>
<P>About half a Mile from this Place we saw lying the sixth small City call'd
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngeiven,</HI> which has a small Inlet of the River <HI>Can</HI> running up to it; but this
<FIGURE>
<PB N="60" REF="40"/>
</FIGURE>
City participated of the same Misfortune with the rest, and was totally ruin'd
and sack'd by the <HI>Tartar,</HI> who left nothing standing but one Triumphal Arch,
which serves for some Ornament to the Place; but the Houses and great
Buildings lie all in a Heap of Ashes.</P>
<P>We left immediately this miserable Town, and came to an eminent Vil∣lage
call'd <HI>Pekkinsa,</HI> whose Situation is most pleasant, and where a good Trade
is driven in all Naval Materials, to the great benefit of the Inhabitants. At a
great distance before you come to this Village, you see several Cliffs, which
have been so wonderfully cut and order'd by Art and Labor, that the very
sight thereof fill'd us all with admiration; but the last War has much defac'd
the beauty of them, and there is now only left the Ruines whereby to judge
what a brave Ornament they were formerly. The very destruction of these
artificial Rocks sufficiently declares what vast Devastations befel the whole
Empire of <HI>China</HI> in the last War of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who did not only ruine the
greatest Cities, Towns, and Villages, but neither suffer'd any Ornaments to
continue eminent in the Country; for not any Place of note escap'd the fury
of those barbarous People, except the Imperial City of <HI>Peking,</HI> which the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
favor'd after they had taken it, where yet are to be seen most rare and ex∣quisite
Curiosities, whereof we shall make mention hereafter.</P>
<P>In regard of the extraordinary strangeness of these Stone Cliffs made by
Art, I took the Altitude of one of them which had suffer'd least prejudice by
the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and found it at least forty Foot. The like artificial Rocks are to
be seen in the Emperor's Court, where the <HI>Great Tartar Cham</HI> often refreshes
himself in the heat of Summer.</P>
<P>We departed at last from this Village <HI>Pekkinsa,</HI> and came late in the Even∣ing
to the small City <HI>Taiko,</HI> which is the second small City under the Iuris∣diction
of the ninth Chief City <HI>Kiegan,</HI> and situate on the side of the River
<HI>Can.</HI></P>
<P>Early in the Morning I took a view of this Place, which hath toward the
Water side high and strong Walls: The Country round about is most de∣lightful
and luxurious; but the City it self lies wholly ruin'd by the <HI>Tartars:</HI>
The Streets are well enough Pav'd, but very small and narow, yet were reple∣nish'd
formerly with stately Edifices, which now lie waste and uninhabited:
all that was left remarkable, is a high Tower, with some Idol Temples. We
<FIGURE>
<PB N="61" REF="40"/>
</FIGURE>
were visited here by a certain <HI>Mandorin,</HI> who was come thither not long be∣fore
from <HI>Peking</HI> with two thousand Horse, upon the Account of the young
<HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roy: He told us that the Emperor, with several Lords in <HI>Pe∣king,</HI>
long expected our coming.</P>
<P>Upon the 29. of <HI>April</HI> we came unto the most famous City of <HI>Kinungam,</HI>
call'd by som <HI>Kiegan,</HI> which is the ninth Prime City of this Province of <HI>Kiang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i:</HI>
It lies about forty Miles from <HI>Taiko,</HI> being built upon the Western side of the
River <HI>Can,</HI> not far from the Place where those terrible and dreadf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Cliffs
call'd <HI>Xepatan</HI> discover themselves, and is defended with tall Battlements, by
the help of which she was enabled to make resistance against the <HI>Tartars</HI> when
beleaguer'd by them. Here were also formerly many stately Structures; but
they are now generally ruin'd and destroy'd by the Enemy, some few Idol-Temples
only remaining. Over against the City lies an Island, where stands
a curious Temple of modern Building, hung round about with great and
small Images.</P>
<P>The Country round about this City is full of Hills and Dales, in which are
said to be Gold and Silver Mines; but the <HI>Chineses</HI> are prohibited by their
Laws to dig for any, only they are permitted to take what of either they can
find upon the sides of the Rivers. These Parts are also pregnant and delight∣ful;
for in this Country (which is seldom known in other Places) there is no
want of Water either Winter or Summer, nor too much Drought.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Ganto,</HI> the fifth small City under the Iurisdiction of <HI>Kinungam,</HI> a
mighty high Mountain call'd <HI>Nucung,</HI> lifts her Head towards the Clouds, and
is as remarkable for bigness as any in those Parts.</P>
<P>Most of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Rivers are very dangerous, being so precipitate, that all
Vessels are liable almost to continual Attaques, and sudden surprizals of
Rocks, Banks, and Shoals in ambush; so that the Masters ought to be skilful
and circumspect in their Steerage from Port to Port. But the River <HI>Can</HI> is near
this City most hazardous, there residing those unmerciful Bilgers, call'd by
the Natives <HI>Zepatane.</HI> The Vessels bound hither take commonly very expert
Pilots, and such as are by Custom better acquainted with the fixed Rocks, and
still varying and unsetled Shoals.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Place and the adjacent Parts, recounted to us with
<PB N="62" REF="41"/>
much regret and reluctance, how barbarously they had been us'd by the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
who burnt and destroy'd their Houses, carrying many into perpetual
Slavery; others they put to Death with rare and exquisite Tortures, making
no discrimination either of Sex or Age; and when they had glutted their sal∣vage
Inclinations with Ruine and Plunder, they exercis'd their more inhu∣mane
Cruelty upon innocent Virgins, of whom four thousand, all choice and
singular Beauties, they carried into Captivity, aud for inconsiderable Sums
sold them to make Bawds and Madams of Pleasure-houses, so prostituting
them to be comprest and devirginated by libidinous Courtiers and deboist
Hectors, for their own Profit, at what Price soever they pleas'd to put upon
them.</P>
<P>That same Day we made such good speed, that we got beyond <HI>Kiexui,</HI> the
fourth small Town under the Iurisdiction of <HI>Kiegan.</HI> This Place is situate on
the side of the River <HI>Chang,</HI> and is in circumference a Mile and a half, sur∣rounded
with Hills, and built after the <HI>Chinese</HI> fashion, with Idol-Temples:
On the Water side stands a strong Wall fifteen Foot high.</P>
<P>The next Day, being the 20. of <HI>April,</HI> we past by <HI>Kiakia,</HI> the fourth small
City under the eighth Chief Metropolis <HI>Liukiang.</HI> This City lies about thirty
Miles from <HI>Kiexui,</HI> at the bottom of the Mountains, and upon the North side
of the River <HI>Can,</HI> which waters this City, to the great accommodation of the
Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The Country about this Place produces Oranges and other Fruits in great
abundance: A good part of its Wall is built upon the Hills, and the Ground
lying within the Wall is Manur'd by the Inhabitants. Here is standing an an∣cient
Idol-Temple, which is famous for having two Gates, each being of one
intire Stone; but the Houses were most of them demolish'd by the <HI>Tartars.</HI>
Not far from these Walls lies a Mountain call'd <HI>Mung,</HI> whose Top reaches so
high, that it seems to be invested with Clouds: yet the sides of this Aspirer
flourish, being cloth'd with stately Woods, and mantled with verdant and
delightful Pastures.</P>
<P>That same Day toward the Evening we got to the City <HI>Sinkin,</HI> the second
small City under the eighth Chief City of <HI>Linkiang,</HI> which lies about twenty
Miles from <HI>Hiakiang;</HI> and it is situate also on the side of the River <HI>Can,</HI> having
a pleasant Prospect of Hills and fruitful Fields behind it. This Place doth not
differ much in bigness or beauty from <HI>Hiakiang,</HI> only it lies in a more even
Soil, and not so near the Mountains. Toward the Water, in the middle of a
Wall, stands a very high and well-built Gate. Most of the Buildings within
had been destroy'd by the <HI>Tartars.</HI> We lay all Night Aboard our Vessels over
against the City near to an Idol-Temple, where the Governor came to Salute
us, and brought some few Presents for the Kitchin.</P>
<P>Upon the 22. we set Sail early in the Morning, and arriv'd by Noon be∣fore
the Chief City of <HI>Fungching,</HI> which is the second small City under the Iu∣risdiction
of the first Chief City of <HI>Nanchang.</HI> This City lies in a flat and even
Soil, built four-square, and situated upon the said River <HI>Can,</HI> and is surround∣ed
with a high Wall above a Mile about.</P>
<P>On the North side of the City is a populous Suburb, well and close built
with goodly Buildings.</P>
<P>There are also two great and high Triumphal Arches, which had been much
defac'd with the rest of the brave Structures in the last bloody Invasion. There
are likewise several Mountains not far from this Place; one is call'd <HI>Pechang,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="41"/>
from whence there falls a mighty Torrent of Water with a most hideous
noise.</P>
<P>The next Day, being the 23. of <HI>April,</HI> we came in sight of the first Chief
City of <HI>Nanchang,</HI> which is also call'd by some according to the Name of the
Province, <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> where it is situated. We were hardly come to an Anchor,
but the Magistrates sent four very commodious Boats Aboard to fetch us
Ashore, for there is no Landing or coming near the shore with great Vessels,
by reason of the Sands. The Mandorin <HI>Pinxenton</HI> took presently two of the
best of these Boats for himself which was ill taken by the Ambassadors: Not
long after came the Magistrates themselves to welcom them, and caus'd <HI>Pin∣xenton</HI>
to restore to the Ambassadors one of the Boats which he had taken for
his own use.</P>
<P>The next Day one of the Ambassadors, namely <HI>Peter de Goyer</HI> (for <HI>Iacob de
Keyser</HI> found himself ill) with the Secretary <HI>Henry Baron,</HI> and all our Follow∣ers,
went to visit the <HI>Tutang,</HI> or Governor of this City; who receiv'd us with
great Civility, and shew'd his Displeasure at his Interpreter for bringing the
Ambassadors a foot, saying, <HI>That such Persons as came from so remote and strange
Parts, to Congratulate his Imperial Majesty upon his Victories and Prosperity, ought to be
receiv'd in great State:</HI> He was also very much offended at the <HI>Mandorins</HI> of the
<HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roys, calling them <HI>Asses.</HI> After the Ambassador had taken his
leave, and was come into the Street, one of the Governor's Gentlemen came
and presented both him and his Secretary each with a fine Horse, upon which
they rid to the Water side; and when the Ambassadors set Sail, they were Sa∣luted
with the great Guns from the Walls of this City; and they to requite
this civil Reception of the Governor, sent him a few Presents, but he refus'd
them, saying, <HI>That no Person in</HI> China <HI>was permitted to receive any Presents from
Forein Ambassadors, before they had seen and Saluted the Emperor.</HI></P>
<P>The Chief City of <HI>Nanchang</HI> is distant about five Miles from <HI>Funching,</HI> situa∣ted
near that great Lake call'd <HI>Poyang,</HI> which hath a Current round this City,
so that she stands amidst an Island: Her Building is four-square, with high
Walls and seven Gates, whereof four are very handsom; before one of which
we lay at Anchor. This City also boasts four stately Temples, which are very
richly adorn'd; but amongst them that is the most famous which the <HI>Chineses</HI>
call <HI>Thisiking,</HI> being cover'd with glittering or glaz'd Pan-Tyles: At the En∣trance
stand three Buildings together; in the first of which appears an Idol,
by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Kouja,</HI> believ'd to be the Guardian and Preserve of this
his own Mansion; he sits amongst a great many other Images upon a rich
Seat, Cloth'd <HI>Al' antique,</HI> after the manner of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> with a Crimson
Mantle hanging upon his Shoulders: On each side stands upon a bigh Pole
two terrible Dragons, much admir'd among the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which with extended
Necks seem hissing and breathing defiance against the Gods. In the second
Structure you have a broad Gallery reaching round the Temple, hung full of
Idols, which are much ador'd by the <HI>Chineses.</HI> The third Building is also
adorn'd with the like Images.</P>
<P>At the Entrance of the first of these Edifices, on the right side, stands a Well,
which is twelve Paces in the square over, and curiously adorn'd with white
Stone, and always brim full of Water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> fancy to themselves wonderful Stories from this Idol <HI>Kouja</HI> and
the Well, believing that formerly here he dwelt, and in his Life was very
Charitable to all poor People, dispencing freely what he had among them;
<PB N="64" REF="42"/>
and his Treasure was never to be exhausted, because he being a great Alchy∣mist,
was possess'd of the <HI>Elixir,</HI> and converted all Metal into Gold. Like∣wise
they imagine that this <HI>Kouja,</HI> through their Gods Direction and Power,
did once overcome a most hideous Dragon, which threatned the Destruction
of this City; which he afterwards bound to an Iron Pillar and flung into
this Well, and so deliver'd the Inhabitants from the grand Destroyer, as a se∣cond
<HI>St. George;</HI> and that he at last with all his Family was taken up into
Heaven. Therefore these Idolaters (who held this for a good and holy Deed)
erected this Temple for him after his Death. Many other Stories were told
us of this their Deity. Most of the other rare Buildings which had been for∣merly
in this City, were totally destroy'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> only there is still left
standing one well-built Tower.</P>
<P>The Fields about this City are very fruitful, and well manur'd, which fur∣nish
the Cities and Towns round about with all manner of Provisions and
Corn.</P>
<P>The greatest destruction which befel this City in the last War, was occasi∣on'd
thus: One <HI>Kiuns,</HI> a famous Commander, born in the Province of <HI>Leao∣tung,</HI>
was made Governor by the <HI>Great Tartar Cham</HI> over this Province of <HI>Ki∣angsi;</HI>
for the <HI>Tartars</HI> much trust the <HI>Leaotungers,</HI> because they lie next to <HI>Tartary:</HI>
but this <HI>Kiuns</HI> revolted from the <HI>Tartar,</HI> with this whole Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI>
and own'd one <HI>Iunglieus</HI> for Emperor.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar</HI> to stifle in the Birth the Design and Intention of this Comman∣der,
and to reduce the said Province under his Obedience, rais'd a formida∣ble
Army, Listed under famous Captains. In the mean while this <HI>Kiuns</HI> had
Fought several Battels with good success against the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and put to flight
the chief Commander of the Southern Provinces with his whole Army, which
was sent against him. Hereupon this <HI>Kiuns</HI> went and besieg'd the City of <HI>Can∣cheu;</HI>
but when he understood that the <HI>Tartar</HI> was coming against him with a
powerful Army, he rais'd his Siege, and march'd toward the Frontiers of the
Northern Provinces, to hinder the Inroads of the <HI>Tartar:</HI> and at first <HI>Kiuns</HI>
Fought with good Conduct and Success, having a great Army with him, that
understood well the <HI>Tartar</HI> Discipline; but finding his Enemy to be too
strong, and ready to overpower him, he was necessitated for his safety to re∣treat
into this City of <HI>Nanchang.</HI> The <HI>Tartars</HI> though they had a very formi∣dable
Army, yet durst not venture to Storm the City by close Leagure, but
resolv'd to force an Entrance by their Necessities: and the better to effect this
their Design, they commanded the neighboring Villagers to assist, causing
them to dig a great Trench on the Land side of the City; but the River was
block'd up with Vessels, to prevent all manner of Provision from coming by
Water to their Relief. This Place was then exceeding full of Inhabitants; so
that <HI>Kiuns,</HI> af a Siege of four Months, was reduc'd to great extremity by Fa∣mine;
and though several daily suffer'd Death, yet they would not deliver up
the City, still expecting that <HI>Iunglieus</HI> would come and relieve them: But
when <HI>Kiuns</HI> saw himself brought as it were to the last gasp, 'tis said he thus
encourag'd his Men; <HI>Most valiant Fellow-Soldiers, we are to expect no other Help
than what our Swords and Courage will afford us; we must therefore force our Way
through the</HI> Tartars: <HI>make ready and follow me.</HI> Thus having ended his short
Speech, and put himself and those with him into the best posture he was able,
he Sallied out immediately; but coming to the Trench (which was large
and deep) they began to see the difficulty of their Attempt; yet being in de∣spair,
<FIGURE>
<PB N="65" REF="42"/>
</FIGURE>
they at last got over the Trench, notwithstanding all the opposition of
the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and fought their Way through the Army, with the slaughter of a
great number of their Adversaries: <HI>Kiuns</HI> himself came off with his Life, and
hid himself among the Mountains. He was no sooner gone out of the City,
but the Inhabitants immediately set open the Gates to the fury of the Enemy;
who being got in, never left destroying till they had ruin'd the whole City;
and when they had done with the Buildings, they fell upon the Citizens,
whom they put all to the Sword: for it is a Maxim among the <HI>Tartars,</HI> That
such Cities as revolt against them, and are subdu'd by force of Arms, should
be serv'd after this manner; but such as yield without any opposition, have
no hurt done unto them.</P>
<P>Upon the 25. of <HI>April</HI> we came to a Village famous for Shipping, call'd
<HI>Ucienjen,</HI> where lay great store of Vessels of several sorts and sizes, which were
come thither from all Parts of <HI>China,</HI> to lade with <HI>China</HI> Earthen Ware, great
quantities whereof are sold in this Village, which lies near to the Pool call'd
<HI>Poyang,</HI> upon the side of the River <HI>Can,</HI> and is above a Mile long: It is a Place
full of Trade, and very handsomly built. Upon the side of a Mountain near
this Place, stands a well-built Idol-Temple, behung with great and small Ima∣ges.
I found hanging also in this Temple a great many black Lamps, which
the Inhabitants kept continually burning Day and Night. The <HI>Chineses</HI> and
<HI>Tartars</HI> that at any time are to pass over this Pool <HI>Poyang,</HI> Offer up first some
Present or other to the Idol of this Temple, for a safe and speedy Passage.
The Sacrifice which I saw here, is perform'd after this manner: The ordinary
sort of People take a Cock, but the rich a Hog (wherewith the Country
abounds) which they bring alive to the Image, which is Pictur'd in a most
terrible Posture, and there they cut the Throats of those Creatures, and with
the warm Blood besprinkle the Claws of the Idol (which generally resemble
the Claws of Griffins) and some part of his Body; so that their Idols are
always bedawb'd with Blood, on purpose to make them look with a more
grim Aspect. They Offer up likewise to the Idol the Feet of the dead Swine,
and the Spurs and Comb of the Cock; the rest they reserve for themselves,
and make Merry therewith, Feasting in Honor of this Idol.</P>
<P>Quite through the middle of this rich Village runs a broad Street, full
of Shops on both sides, where all manner of Commodities are sold; but the
<PB N="66" REF="43"/>
chiefest Trade is in <HI>Porcelane</HI> or <HI>China</HI> Ware, which is to be had there in great
abundance.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Village told us (to our great admiration) that there
was no better <HI>Porcelane</HI> made in all the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> than in the Village
<HI>Sinktesuno,</HI> which lay at least a hundred Miles Eastward from hence, near to
the City <HI>Feuleang,</HI> the fourth small City of the second Chief City of <HI>Ioacheu:</HI>
and they added withal, (which increased our wonder) that they did not fetch
the Earth whereof this <HI>Porcelane</HI> is made out of the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> where∣in
this Village is situated, but from the Chief City of <HI>Hoeicheu,</HI> in the Province
of <HI>Nanking;</HI> and that the Inhabitants there were not able to make it, though
they digg'd the Earth in great abundance, because they knew not how to tem∣per
it with the Water, which they alledg'd to be the only reason why they
could not attain to this Art. And though I saw not these Cities <HI>Hoiecheu</HI> and
<HI>Iaocheu,</HI> nor how they digg'd this Soil in one Place, and made <HI>Porcelane</HI> there∣of
in another, yet I will briefly relate to you what Account was given me by
Persons of credit, resident in this Village of <HI>Ucienjen.</HI></P>
<P>The Earth whereof this <HI>Porcelane</HI> is made, is digg'd in great quantities out
of the Mountains situated near the Chief City <HI>Hoeicheu</HI> in the Province of
<HI>Nanking,</HI> from whence it is brought in four-square Clods to the above-men∣tion'd
Village, which have the Emperor's Arms stamp'd upon them, to prevent
all manner of deceit. The Earth is not fat, like Clay or Chalk, but like to
our fine Sand, which they mingle with Water, and so make it into the fore∣mention'd
Clods. They likewise beat into Powder the broken <HI>China</HI> Dishes,
and make new ones of them; but such as are made of broken Ware never take
so fine a Colour and Gloss, as those which are made of fresh Mold: The
Earthen Clods which are thus brought from the Mountains, are afterwards
fram'd into what fashions they please, after the same manner as our Potters in
<HI>Europe</HI> form their Earthen Ware. Upon the greatest sort of Pots which are
made of this Earth, they have an Art to themselves to paint all manner of
Creatures, Flowers, and Trees, which they do very curiously only with <HI>Indico.</HI>
This Art of Painting upon the Pots is kept so private and secret, that they will
not teach it to any but their Children and near Relations; wherein the <HI>Chine∣ses</HI>
are so dexterous, that you cannot shew them any thing, but they will imi∣tate
it upon their Pots and Dishes; which being fram'd and made of this
Earth, are first dri'd in the Sun before they are bak'd in the Oven; and when
they are throughly dri'd, they are put into an Oven and stopt very close, there
baking for fifteen days together with a good Fire underneath: the time being
expir'd, they are continu'd in the Oven fiften days more without any Fire, on∣ly
the Oven all that while is kept close stopt, and not open'd till it be quite
cold; for if they should take the Ware out red hot, it would endanger not on∣ly
the breaking of it, but also the losing of the Gloss. After thirty days the
Furnace is open'd in the presence of an Officer, appointed by the Emperor
to take an Account of this Earthen Ware, and to receive his Duty, which is
of each sort the fifth piece, according to the Laws of the Kingdom; the rest
they afterwards sell to the Inhabitants of this Village <HI>Ucienjen,</HI> where (as they
say) is the Staple of this <HI>Porcelane</HI> Trade, which is sent from this Village, not
only through all <HI>China,</HI> but also through the whole World.</P>
<P>We departed the same Day from this Place, and upon the 26. came to the
Chief City of <HI>Nankang,</HI> which lies upon the West-side of this Lake, which is
very broad and long.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="43"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>This City is built upon a mountainous Soil, about fifty Miles from <HI>Nan∣kang:</HI>
the Walls are both high and strong, and fortifi'd with Bulwarks.
Within the City stands a well-built Tower; the Streets are very full of Wind∣ings
and Turnings, which makes them very troublesom to such as use them.
The first Street, which lies on the left-hand as you come in, has several Trium∣phal
Arches standing in it, very artificially built according to the <HI>Chinese</HI> fa∣shion:
Beside these Ornaments there is nothing rare in this City, for the
Houses are but mean, and slightly built.</P>
<P>In prospect of this City lie several stately Temples, whereof the biggest
and chiefest are built upon the Mountains <HI>Quangliu</HI> and <HI>Iuenxiu.</HI> The Inhabi∣tants
round about worship these Mountains, upon which dwell a great com∣pany
of Priests and Friers; each of which has a little Hutch, where he daily
cruciates and afflicts himself, by scourging and disciplining his Body; the en∣during
of which Castigation makes him a Miracle to those People of impli∣cit
Faith, who fancy these their Sufferings to merit after Death the highest
Felicities in another World: for they believe, that their Souls are transmi∣grated
into other Bodies. The Inhabitants told us, that upon the Mountain
<HI>Quanglu</HI> there are as many Cloysters as Days in the Year. They said likewise,
that this Mountain was always cover'd with Clouds and Fogs, though round
about the Weather were clear and serene. The Country produces store of
Hemp, whereof the Inhabitants make themselves Clothes for the Summer,
which very much keep off the scorching Heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>On the West-side of this City lies a Hill, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Kien.</HI> The
Water that falls from the Brow of this Hill, is held by the <HI>Chineses</HI> very sove∣raign
for several Diseases.</P>
<P>The Pool <HI>Poyang</HI> divides the Territories belonging to this City into two
parts, both which are very fruitful in Rice, and Corn of all sorts.</P>
<P>Upon the 29. we made for the City of <HI>Hukeu,</HI> being the fourth small City
of the fifth Chief City <HI>Kieukiang,</HI> to furnish our selves with Provisions. This
City lies forty Miles from the foregoing Chief City of <HI>Nankang,</HI> upon the
narrow of the Lake <HI>Poyang,</HI> and upon the right-side of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> which
mingles with it, and receives no small share of its Water. On the North-side
of the City doth appear a very pleasant and antique Rock, which hangs
somewhat over the River, and appears a most delightful Prospect, being over∣grown
<PB N="68" REF="44"/>
with Trees. At the bottom of this Mountain stands a large and beau∣tiful
Idol-Temple. The Walls of this City are very thick and high, and for
the greater safety of the City, are Guarded in several places with Foot-Sol∣diers.
This City drives a handsom Trade, is full of People, and well built;
all manner of Provisions are sold very cheap, especially Fish, which yields but
a small Price.</P>
<P>About this City lies a Hill call'd <HI>Xechung,</HI> which signifies <HI>A Stone Bell;</HI> for
the Waves and Billows which rise out of the Pool <HI>Poyang</HI> in foul and stormy
Weather, beat against this Hill, and occasion thereby such a strange and ring∣ing
noise, that it very much resembles the sound of a Bell.</P>
<P>We were no sooner come to an Anchor, but the news of our Arrival fill'd
the whole City with joy, so that both old and young came running to the
Shore to view us and our Vessels, who beheld us with great admiration, and
fain would have been talking to us, if the difference of Language had not hin∣dred:
We caus'd our Trumpets to sound that old Tune of <HI>William of Nassaw,</HI>
supposing to have delighted them; but on the contrary, they were so much
affrighted with their brazen Voice, that they ran roring with full speed for
shelter to the City.</P>
<P>Having provided our selves with Necessaries, we departed from this Place
and came to <HI>Pengce,</HI> the fifth small City under this Capital one of <HI>Kieukiang.</HI>
Thus far had we proceeded in our Voyage upon the River <HI>Can</HI> from <HI>Kancheu</HI> to
<HI>Nanking;</HI> from whence we passed over the Pool <HI>Poyang,</HI> and so came into the
River <HI>Kiang,</HI> which, to prosecute the remainder of our Voyage to <HI>Peking,</HI> we
were to Sail up Eastward. This River <HI>Kiang,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Son of the
Sea,</HI> divides all <HI>China</HI> into Northern and Southern, gliding from West to East,
and receives several Names from the Provinces through which it runs.</P>
<P>The foremention'd City <HI>Pengce</HI> lies thirty Miles from <HI>Hukeu,</HI> behind an
Island on the East-side of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> and has behind it high and famous
Hills: it is a well-built Place, but far less than <HI>Hukeu.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from this <HI>Pengce</HI> lies a Mountain call'd <HI>Siaocu,</HI> which is so steep,
high, and inaccessible, that none could ever scale the top: It is surrounded
with Water, and has on the South-side a small, but very safe Road for Ships in
foul Weather.</P>
<P>Upon the South-side of the River <HI>Kiang</HI> lies also a Hill call'd <HI>Makang,</HI> talk'd
on with terror through all <HI>China</HI> for the abundance of Shipwracks which hap∣pen
near this Place: for if the Pilot miss never so little his Steerage, they sel∣dom
escape bilging on the neighboring Rocks.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors with some of their Followers went Ashore upon the said
Island, but were forc'd immediately to return, having observ'd the footing of
a Tyger, which sort of Beast is very numerous in this Country.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Chinese</HI> Pilots saw our Cook going to make a Fire to dress Dinner,
they came into the Cabbin to the Ambassadors, fell down upon their Knees,
and earnestly entreated that they would forbid any such thing to be done, for
that (as they said) there was a certain Spirit who kept himself under Water
about this Pool, and appear'd in the shape of a Dragon, or great Fish, and had
the Command over this Countrey, whose Nature and Constitution was such,
that he could not endure the scent in his Nose of roasted Poultry, boil'd Bacon,
or other savory Smells; for so soon as he was sensible of any such thing, he
immediately rais'd a Storm, which did infallibly cast away the Vessel. The
Ambassadors at their earnest Entreaty sent word to the Cook, that they should
<PB N="69" REF="44"/>
be content with a cold Dinner for that Day. During the Discourse, there
appear'd playing above the Water two or three Tunny Fishes, which put the
<HI>Chineses</HI> into no little fear, in regard they imagin'd the Water-Spirit had al∣ready
given order for the casting away of their Vessel.</P>
<P>Thus far we had travell'd through the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> when about
Noon we came in sight of two Columns which stood in the middle of the Ri∣ver,
and divide the Province of <HI>Kiangsi</HI> from that of <HI>Nanking,</HI> into which we
were now come. But before I relate the Sequel of our Iourney, I shall give
you in short the number of the great and small Cities of this Province, and
the farthest Extent thereof.</P>
<P>This Province of <HI>Nanking</HI> (which is reckon'd for the ninth among the fif∣teen)
is wash'd with the Sea on the East and South-East: On the South it
borders upon the Province of <HI>Chekiang;</HI> on the South-west, upon <HI>Kiangsi;</HI> on
the West upon <HI>Hupang;</HI> North-West, upon <HI>Honan;</HI> and the rest upon <HI>Xan∣tung.</HI></P>
<P>In this Place formerly they kept the Court of the ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors;
and though the Imperial Palace be remov'd to <HI>Peking,</HI> yet till the last <HI>Tartar</HI>
War, the Court of the Emperors did continue in the Chief City of this Pro∣vince
call'd <HI>Kiangning:</HI> but the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the last Invasion, did not only to∣tally
destroy and deface all Royal Palaces, and Imperial Courts, which were
most noble Edifices, but also alter'd the very Name of the Province and of the
Chief City: for the Province which formerly bore the Name of <HI>Nanking</HI> they
call'd <HI>Kiangnan;</HI> and the Chief City which was formerly call'd <HI>Ingtien,</HI> they
nam'd <HI>Kiangning;</HI> and depriv'd this City also of all its Royal Splendor and
Privileges.</P>
<P>As this Province far exceeds all the rest in goodness and richness of Soil, so
likewise in Trade and Commerce; for here are the Chiefest Cities of all
<HI>China,</HI> each being famous for Traffick. No less doth this Kingdom abound
in Shipping above all the rest; for the number of all manner of Vessels is so
great, that it seems as if all the Shipping of the World were Harbor'd there:
but 'tis no wonder, considering the Situation of the Rivers that run through
this Country; for by them they can pass by Water into any part of <HI>China,</HI> and
all Vessels which are bound higher up, must meet there, which lessens the
wonder of so great Fleets of Ships together in that part: And besides, all
Vessels come to this Province out of the River <HI>Kiang</HI> through broad Naviga∣ble
Waters, made either by Art or Nature, which are call'd <HI>The Royal Channels.</HI></P>
<P>The Natives of this Place are generally very Civil, Witty, Serviceable, and
Mannerly: It likewise breeds great store of able Handicrafts-men, who prove
most excellent in their several Arts. There are likewise here very Learned
Men, brought up in their Schools of Literature.</P>
<P>It produces great store of Cotton and Silk, which maintains there abundance
of Weavers, who work in either Commodity; but this is the Womens Busi∣ness,
and the Men follow Husbandry and other Employments, or else look to
the Children whilst the Women Spin.</P>
<P>This Seat of <HI>Nanking</HI> is so famous through all <HI>China,</HI> that whatsoever is
made in it, is preferr'd before any thing of the like nature wrought in other
parts of the Country.</P>
<P>In this Province lie fourteen Chief Cities, which Command over a hun∣dred
and ten small ones; the Names of which fourteen principal ones are
these which follow; <HI>Kiangning, Fungyang, Sucheu, Sungkiang, Changcheu, Chin∣kiang,
<PB N="70" REF="45"/>
Yangcheu, Hoaigan, Lucheu, Ganking, Taiping, Ningque, Chicheu,</HI> and <HI>Ho∣eicheu.</HI></P>
<P>Kiangning, <HI>call'd also</HI> Ingtien <HI>and</HI> Nanking, <HI>Commands over seven Cities, as</HI>
Kiangning, Kiuyung, Lieyang, Liexui, Caoxun, Kiangpu, <HI>and</HI> Loho.</P>
<P>Fungyang <HI>Commands over eighteen Cities, as</HI> Fungyang, Linhoai, Hoaiyven,
Tingyven, Uhu, Hung, Xeu, Hokieu, Mungching, Su, Hiutai, Tienchang, So, Lingpi,
Ing, Tacho, Hao, <HI>and</HI> Ingxan.</P>
<P>Sucheu <HI>Commands over seven Cities, as</HI> Sucheu, Quenxan, Changxo, Ukiang,
Kiating, Taicang, <HI>and</HI> Cungming.</P>
<P><HI>Sungkiang</HI> Commands over three Cities, as <HI>Sungkiang, Xanghai,</HI> and <HI>Cingpu.</HI></P>
<P>Changcheu <HI>Commands over five Cities, as</HI> Changcheu, Vusie, Kiangyn, Gniking,
<HI>and</HI> Cinkiang.</P>
<P><HI>Chinkiang</HI> Commands over three Cities, as <HI>Chinkiang, Tanyang,</HI> and <HI>Kintan.</HI></P>
<P>Yangcheu <HI>Commands over ten Cities, as</HI> Yangcheu, Ychin, Taihing, Caoyeu, Hing∣hoa,
Pacyng, Tai, Iucao, Tung, <HI>and</HI> Haimuen.</P>
<P>Hoaigan <HI>Commands over ten Cities, as</HI> Hoaigan, Cingho, Gantung, Taoyven,
Moyang, Hai, Canyu, Pi, Sociven, <HI>and</HI> Ciunning.</P>
<P>Lucheu <HI>Commands over eight Cities, as</HI> Lucheu, Xuching, Lukiang, Vuguei,
Cao, Logan, Iungxan, <HI>and</HI> Hoxan.</P>
<P>Ganking <HI>Commands over six Cities, as</HI> Ganking, Tungching, Cienxan, Taihu, Su∣fung,
Vangkiang.</P>
<P><HI>Taiping</HI> Commands over three Cities, as <HI>Taiping, Vuku,</HI> and <HI>Fachang.</HI></P>
<P>Ningque <HI>Commands over five Cities, as</HI> Ningque, King, Taiping, Cingte, <HI>and</HI>
Nanling.</P>
<P>Cicheu <HI>Commands over six Cities, as</HI> Cicheu, Cingyang, Tungling, Xelai, Kiente,
<HI>and</HI> Tunglieu.</P>
<P>Hoeicheu <HI>likewise over six Cities, as</HI> Hoeicheu, Hieuning, Vuyven, Kimuen, In,
<HI>and</HI> Cieki.</P>
<P>There are beside all these four other ordinary Cities in this Province, which
the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Cheu,</HI> and some other less Cities which they call <HI>Hien:</HI> The
four Cities are these; <HI>Quangte, Hocheu, Cheuceu,</HI> and <HI>Sincheu.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quangte</HI> Commands over one City, which is call'd <HI>Kienping; Hocheu,</HI> over
<HI>Hanxan; Cheucheu</HI> over two others, <HI>Civenezao</HI> and <HI>Taigan; Siucheu</HI> over four,
<HI>Siao, Tanxan, Fung,</HI> and <HI>Poi.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Poll-Book of this Province makes mention of 1969816 Fami∣lies,
as also of 9967429 Fighting Men.</P>
<P>The yearly Revenue which this Province pays to the Emperor, consists of
5995034 Bags of Rice, 6863 Pounds of unwrought Silk, 28452 Pieces of
Cloth, and 2027 Rolls of woven Hemp-Cloth.</P>
<P>This Province likewise furnishes the Emperor's Stables with 5804217
Trusses of Straw or Hay, and 705100 Pounds of Salt: All which being va∣lu'd
together, will amount to an incredible Sum, beside what is paid in Mo∣ney,
which amounts to 32000000 of <HI>Ducats,</HI> as I was credibly inform'd by
some of the Grandees of the Province; which is not incredible, considering
the vast Customs which are paid to the Emperor for all Goods Exported out
of the Chief City of <HI>Nanking.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Xanghai</HI> alone pays yearly to the Emperor for the Toll of
Wool, the Sum of 250000 <HI>Ducats.</HI> All great Shops and Inns pay monthly
thirty <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver, or else the <HI>Tartars</HI> come and Quarter upon them in their
Houses, and misuse them at their pleasure.</P>

<P>Upon the 29. we came to <HI>Tonglon,</HI> or <HI>Tonglieu,</HI> the sixth small City in the
Iurisdiction of the thirteenth Chief City <HI>Chicheu,</HI> and the first Place we came
at in this Province of <HI>Nanking.</HI> This is a small City, and lies close to the South-side
of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> in a very pleasant and delightful Soil, which is encom∣pass'd
about with fine little rising Hills and Vales: It is surrounded as well
on the Water-side as toward the Mountains, with a reasonable strong Wall,
fortifi'd with Bulwarks. This City shews very beautiful as you approach it
upon the River, but within it lies in a most lamentable Condition; for the
<HI>Tartar</HI> proceeded with so much fury against it, that they left nothing defac'd
that deserves any notice to be taken of, only there is one Street that has some
Houses standing in it, the rest are all destroy'd, except the Governor's House,
which is in reasonable good order.</P>
<P>The Magistrates or Governors of the City <HI>Tonglieu,</HI> sent a congratulatory
Letter to the Ambassadors upon their Arrivals, as also some Presents for the
Table, which were not accepted. The Traffick of this City was only Tim∣ber,
so that the Place more resembled <HI>Norway</HI> than <HI>China.</HI> About two Miles
beyond this we saw an Island lying in the Bosom of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> call'd
<HI>Sanglo.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Tonglieu,</HI> near the River side, rises a Mountain call'd <HI>Kieuhoa,</HI>
or <HI>The Nine-headed Mountain,</HI> much like the Sun-Flower when hanging down
the Head.</P>
<P>Two Miles from this <HI>Tonglieu</HI> we saw in our Passage the tenth Chief City
<HI>Ganking,</HI> the most famous City of this Countrey, which abounds in Wealth
and Trade, because no Goods are brought out of other Parts to the Chief
City of <HI>Nanking,</HI> but they must first pass by this.</P>
<P>Upon the 30. we pass'd by with our whole Fleet to the City of <HI>Anhing,</HI>
call'd by some <HI>Chicheu,</HI> and the Chief City of the Royalty of <HI>Nanking,</HI> lying up∣on
the South-side of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> and is about two Miles in circumference.
Upon the River lies a very fine Suburb well built, with good Houses and Idol-Temples:
The Walls which invested the City were above twenty five Foot
high, and artificially rais'd with Watch-Towers and Redoubts: Near the
River side lies a very pleasant Hill, adorn'd with Fruit-Trees, which renders
the Prospect very delightful; upon which stands a <HI>Heathen</HI> Fane, where the
<FIGURE>
<PB N="72" REF="46"/>
</FIGURE>
neighboring Inhabitants round about come to Worship, and present Offer∣ings
to the Deity of that Place. This Temple is crown'd with a stately
Steeple, aspiring with seven Rounds.</P>
<P>The Country, though Hilly, yet abounds with most sorts of Provisions,
and is plentifully supply'd with what they want from the adjacent Markets,
by the River <HI>Kiang.</HI></P>
<P>Toward the Evening we came to <HI>Tungling,</HI> the third small City under the
Command of the Metropolis <HI>Chicheu,</HI> which is situated most delightfully, be∣ing
surrounded with variety of Woods, Hills, and Dales. This City, though
but little, is well built, and encompass'd with Walls, having in the Front a
Land-lock'd Harbor, for Vessels to shelter in stormy Weather, which very
much enriches the Place. The Corner of this Port is Guarded with a strong
Castle, which not only defends the City against any hostile Invasion, but also
serves to protect the Harbor and Vessels that ride there.</P>
<P>Whilst we were taking a view of this Place the Inhabitants told us, that not
far from thence on a Hill, was a very rare Echo: Out of curiosity to hear this
Novelty we clamber'd up the Hill, and there sounded our Trumpets, where
we heard their Notes return most distinctly, to our great admiration.</P>
<P>Near to this City rises the Mountain <HI>Hing,</HI> so nam'd from the Apricocks
which grow thereupon in great abundance.</P>
<P>Having satisfi'd our Eyes with the view of this Place, we set Sail the next
Day, and came on the third of <HI>May</HI> to a Castle call'd <HI>Upun,</HI> near the River <HI>Ki∣ang,</HI>
not far from the following City of <HI>Ufu,</HI> being built four-square, and be∣girt
with a large Stone Wall: Amidst this Fortress is a strong well-built
Temple, with a high Roof, whose inside is curiously adorn'd with Pictures.</P>
<P>The same Day we arriv'd at <HI>Ufu,</HI> the second small City under the eleventh
Metropolis call'd <HI>Taiping,</HI> lying with our Vessels close under the Walls of the
City. This Town is situate in an Island of the River <HI>Kiang;</HI> the Suburbs of
it are very populous, and full of Commerce: Upon each Angle of this Island
are strong Block-houses, but are neither Mann'd, nor have any Guns mounted
on them. This City is cri'd up through all <HI>China</HI> for Arms, the Inhabitants
being most dexterous and exquisite in making all manner of Military Uten∣sils;
they are likewise very skilful in making Lamps of all sorts.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="46"/>
Upon the fourth we pass'd by the third Chief City, call'd <HI>Teytong,</HI> which
some also call <HI>Taiping,</HI> lying upon the side of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> in an Island
there made by the same Stream. The Country about this Island is in some
places very Rocky, and full of Hills; in others again, as smooth; but in both
exceeding fruitful.</P>
<P>On the South-side of this City we saw at a distance a high Mountain, by
the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Tienmuen,</HI> which signifies <HI>Heavens Gate,</HI> because the River
<HI>Kiang</HI> runs through here between two small Hills of this Mountain, as through
a Gate. Sailing forward, we observ'd lying in the River over against this
City, another Island call'd <HI>Hiao,</HI> all of one intire Stone: In this Rock were
several Holes and Concavities, wherein bred abundance of Night-birds; the
Isle from thence denominated <HI>Hiao.</HI> Not far from hence toward the South-East,
is a large Lake or Pool call'd <HI>Tanyang,</HI> which as well as the River <HI>Kiang,</HI>
divides it self, and waters the whole Countrey of this Chief City, which very
much enriches the Grounds round about, making them satisfie the greedy
Husbandman.</P>
<P>We understood by the <HI>Chineses</HI> that this had been a stately City, well built,
and full of Trade; but the <HI>Tartars</HI> totally ruin'd it in the last Wars. Three
gallant Towers we saw upon the River side as we Sail'd along; by which we
might understand in what a famous Condition this Country had formerly
been.</P>
<P>Upon the same Day we came in sight of that renowned and Royal City of
<HI>Nanking,</HI> which is justly call'd the Chief City of the Province of <HI>Nanking;</HI> we
came to Anchor in the Harbor, and lay with our Vessels before the Gate <HI>Susi∣mon,</HI>
which signifies <HI>The Water-Gate.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassadors went the next Day to visit the three Governors of this
City, being carried in <HI>Palakins,</HI> or Sedans, and their Followers waited upon
them on Horseback: They were conducted thither in great State by the
Agent of the young Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton,</HI> who resided in this City, and by two
<HI>Mandorins,</HI> who came from <HI>Canton</HI> in the absence of <HI>Pinxenton,</HI> who lay still be∣hind.</P>
<P>The chief Governor shew'd the Ambassadors his Withdrawing-room, and
made them, after accustomary Complements, to sit down next to him: He
was a <HI>Chinese,</HI> born in the City of <HI>Leoatung,</HI> but of a very civil behaviour. The
Ambassadors shew'd him a Letter of the Presents which were design'd for
him, but he would not receive them, they having not yet seen the Emperor.</P>
<P>After they had discoursed a while with this first Governor, they took leave,
and went to the second, also a <HI>Chinese,</HI> and born at <HI>Leaotung;</HI> who shew'd him∣self
no less courteous than the former: He caus'd the Ambassadors to sit
down with almost the same Complements, and receiv'd the Letter with great
Civility from them, which nominated his allotted Presents; but he being
illiterate himself, gave it to one of his Commanders to read, and on the for∣mer
account refus'd to accept of them.</P>
<P>From hence they went to the third, who dwelt in the Wall of the old Im∣perial
Palace; he sent for the Ambassadors, who came to him in his Cham∣ber,
where his Wife was with him: The Apartment was four-square, with
Benches round about cover'd with Silk, and a Stove to warm the Room in
Winter, in which they burn Reed, Wood being there very scarce. This Go∣vernor
was by Birth a <HI>Tartar,</HI> a young well-set Man, but understood not the
<HI>Chinese</HI> Language, therefore his Sons were Interpreters: His Wife, a proper
<PB N="74" REF="47"/>
and comely Dame, spoke more than her Husband, and seem'd very inquisi∣tive
about <HI>Holland:</HI> She was not dismay'd at our strange Arms, but, like a
bold <HI>Virago,</HI> drew ont our Swords, and discharg'd our Pistols, which much
delighted her. The Room was presently fill'd with <HI>Tartar</HI> Gentlewomen,
who belong'd to and waited upon this Lady, and brought a great Silver
Kettle full of <HI>Thea,</HI> mingled with Milk and Salt, placing it in the middle of
the Chamber, and serving it about with Wooden Ladles to all the Compa∣ny.
The <HI>Thea</HI> thus mingled, they drink in Wood; but the clear <HI>Thea,</HI> made
onely with Water, they drink in little <HI>China</HI> Cups; and other Drinks, as <HI>Chi∣nese</HI>
Beer, and <HI>Zamsou</HI> made of Rice, in Silver.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors, after they had been thus civilly receiv'd and treated,
took leave, and went with the <HI>Canton</HI> Agent to visit a <HI>Tartar</HI> Gentleman, who
was newly arriv'd from <HI>Peking:</HI> He was a young lusty Man, and had his
Lodging in an old ruinous Court, which also belong'd to the Imperial Pa∣lace;
but all things were in disorder, and in a decay'd condition, without
any Furniture but two or three broken Benches, some Kettles, and a few little
Dishes for <HI>Thea.</HI> His Horses, Mules, Asses, Dromedaries, and Camels, went
up and down in the Court, the Stables being all ruin'd and spoil'd.</P>
<P>From this <HI>Tartar</HI>'s Lodgings the Ambassadors were conducted by the Agent
to his own House, to a sumptuous Dinner, then made ready by his order for
them; where he entertain'd them till Night with all manner of Dainties:
Which done, they thank'd him for his great kindness and civility, took their
leaves, and return'd aboard their Vessels, in which they lay all their Voyage,
both to and from <HI>Peking,</HI> except at <HI>Canton, Nangan,</HI> and <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>This stately City, which without parallel is the Diadem of all <HI>China,</HI> lies
about thirty five Miles from the foremention'd <HI>Taiping,</HI> on the East-side of the
River <HI>Kiang,</HI> and in 32 Degrees of Northern Latitude. Her situation is most
pleasant, and the Soil luxuriously fruitful, the River running quite through
this City, whereof some Streams are navigable for great Vessels. Here was
formerly kept the Court of the old <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors, the Residence of the
ancient Kings of <HI>U, Cyu, Cung, Ci, Leang, Chin,</HI> and <HI>Tanga:</HI> Here also Reign'd ma∣ny
Lustres the Race of <HI>Taiminga,</HI> till they remov'd to <HI>Peking,</HI> the better to pre∣vent
the Invasions and Designs of the <HI>Tartar.</HI></P>
<P>The Founder of this City was <HI>Gnens</HI> King of <HI>Cu,</HI> who nam'd it <HI>Kinling▪</HI>
which signifies <HI>A Golden Countrey:</HI> Afterwards the first Branch of the Race of
<HI>Cina</HI> call'd it <HI>Moling.</HI> The Kings of <HI>U,</HI> who kept their Courts in this City, call'd
it <HI>Kienye:</HI> The Race of <HI>Tanga</HI> gave it the Name of <HI>Kiangxin;</HI> but that of <HI>Tai∣minga</HI>
call'd it <HI>Ingcien:</HI> And last of all, the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who not many years since
over-ran and conquer'd all <HI>China,</HI> gave it again the Name of <HI>Kiangxing.</HI></P>
<P>Where this City borders on the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> it hath a broad and deep Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
into which you come out of the <HI>Kiang</HI> up to the Town, about half a Mile
within the Land. Here they pass over on a Bridge of Boats, which brings
them conveniently into the City, whose East-side, which runs far into this
Country, covers a Flat, with several Navigable Channels running through,
so that you may come with large Vessels up to the Town on that side. Over
these Channels are several Stone Bridges, very rarely built.</P>
<P>According to all <HI>Chinese Geographers,</HI> this City exceeds all the Cities of the
whole World, not onely in Bigness, but also in Beauty, and handsom Decore∣ment;
and is at least five Hours going about, being round, close, and well-built:
but the Walls are full six <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles in length, the Suburbs excepted,
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="47"/>
</FIGURE>
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="48"/>
<PB N="75" REF="48"/>
</FIGURE>
which run out much further. Besides this, the City hath another strong Wall,
for the better defence and safety of the Place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> describe the Circumference of this later Wall by two Horsemen,
who in the Morning setting forth at one and the same Gate, parted,
riding contrary, and, they say, met not till the close of the Evening; by
which they would have us guess at the vast Circumference of their City. The
first Vesture of the City is above thirty Foot high, built Artificially of Stone,
with Breast-Works, and Watch-Towers.</P>
<P>There are thirteen Gates in this Wall, whose Doors are plated with Iron,
and guarded continually with Horse and Foot: Some of these Gates rest on
four or five Arches, through which you pass before you come into the City.
We lay with our Vessels before the Gate <HI>Suisimon,</HI> or <HI>Water-gate:</HI> So great a
number of People pass daily to and again through this Gate, that there is no
getting in or out without much crowding.</P>
<P>The chief Streets of this City are twenty eight Paces broad, very neatly
pav'd, and strait. In the Night there is such good order observ'd for the pre∣venting
of House breaking, or disturbance in the Streets, that there is not the
like in any other part of the World.</P>
<P>The ordinary Citizens Houses are but mean, built without any conveni∣ence,
and stand all with the cross Ridges next to the Street: They have but
one Door to go in and out, and but one Room to eat and sleep in. Next the
Street appears onely a four-square Hole, serving in stead of a Window to let
in Light, which is commonly cover'd with Reeds in stead of Glass, to prevent
Gazers from looking in.</P>
<P>The Houses are but one Story high, being cover'd with White Pan-Tiles,
and the out-sides whited over with Chalk.</P>
<P>Such as dwell in these ordinary Houses, drive very mean Trades; but the
Shops of the chief Citizens and Merchants are fill'd with all manner of rich
<HI>Chinese</HI> Wares, as Cottons, Silk Stuffs, <HI>China</HI> Dishes, Pearls, Diamonds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Before each Shop stands a Board, upon which is inscrib'd the Name of the
Master in Gold Letters, as also what Goods he sels: Beside these Boards
stands a high Pole, which reaches above the House, upon which they hang
Pennons and Flags, or something whereby they (as we in <HI>Europe</HI> with our
Signs) make known their Habitations.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="49"/>
They have not here, nor in all <HI>China,</HI> any Coin'd Money; but use in stead
thereof small Pieces of Silver, which are of different value and weight;
and though you buy never so little, you must always have a Pair of Scales
about you, if you will not be cheated in the weight by these crafty <HI>Chineses:</HI>
for they have commonly two sorts of Weights by them, and are so nimble
and deceitful in their Balancing, that you had need of <HI>Argus</HI>'s Eyes when you
buy any thing of them.</P>
<P>This great City is also so Populous, that there are above 1000000 People
dwelling in it; and yet Provisions of all sorts are to be had there in great
abundance, at a small rate, all the Year long: the reason whereof is the fer∣tility
of the Soil round about. Amongst other Fruits, there are most delicious
Cherries sold very cheap in this City.</P>
<P>Beside the vast number of People, there lies a Garrison of 40000 <HI>Tartars:</HI>
Here resides also the Governor of the Southern Provinces, in the Name of the
Emperor.</P>
<P>This City likewise exceeds any other in <HI>China</HI> for stately Idol-Temples,
Towers, rare Edifices, and Triumphal Arches: But the Emperor's Court or
Palace formerly exceeded all the rest of the Buildings; wherein the Emperor
of <HI>China</HI> was wont to reside, with the same State and Pomp as now at present
the <HI>Great Cham</HI> doth at <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>This Palace was situated on the South-side of the City, built four-square,
and surrounded with a Wall which contains the greatest part of the City.
Each side of the Square wherein this Palace was included contain'd in length
one <HI>Italian</HI> Mile, and three parts of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Mile; and as near as could be
guess'd by the decay'd Walls, or might be learnt from the Inhabitants, this
Court, or Palace, with all belonging thereto, was as big as <HI>Haerlem</HI> in <HI>Hol∣land.</HI>
Within the first great Gate lay a large Court, which led to the four
Squares, and was pav'd with fine smooth Stone.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> seated themselves near an Idol-Temple call'd <HI>Paolinxi,</HI> where
they built themselves several Huts, leaving the <HI>Chineses</HI> to dwell in the City,
and there to drive their Trade. The Buildings are all of a hard sort of
Stone, which the Natives have most curiously painted with a yellow Colour,
so that when the Sun reflects on them, they shine like Gold.</P>
<P>Over the Gate of the second Court of this Palace hangs a great Bell,
about 10 or 11 Foot in height, and three Fathom and a half in Circumference,
whose thickness contains near a quarter of a Yard. The <HI>Chineses</HI> made great
Brags of the sound of this Bell, as if the like were not to be heard of again
in all <HI>China,</HI> yea, not in the whole World; but when we came and struck
upon it, we found it sufficiently dull, and the Metal not so good as that of
ours in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>And though the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the last War did not much deprive and impair this
City of its former Lustre and Splendor (no City escaping better than this
<HI>Nanking)</HI> yet however the stately Palace of the Kings was totall destroy'd by
them. It is suppos'd that the <HI>Tartars</HI> did this for no other end or cause, but out
of a particular Hatred and Grudge which they bore to the Family of <HI>Taiminga,</HI>
who Govern'd till the Court was remov'd from thence to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>But though this City, by the removing of the Imperial Court to <HI>Peking,</HI>
was thus depriv'd of its ancient Glory and Splendor; yet its former and anci∣ent
Magnificence, as well as Obedience, is shewn by the extraordinary Pre∣sents
yearly sent to the Emperor, beyond all the rest of the Cities.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="49"/>
First of all, Every three Months five Ships are sent from thence, laden with
all manner of Silks and Woollen Cloths, to the Emperor at <HI>Peking:</HI> These
Ships are call'd in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language <HI>Lungychuen,</HI> which signifies <HI>Ships with
Dragon-Cloths,</HI> because they are sent to the Emperor, whose Blazonry is full
of Dragons. I must confess, that in all my life-time I never saw any Ships
to exceed these for Riches and Bravery; for they are so very much Gilded
and Painted on the outsides, that it made our Eyes dazle to look on them:
and within they were likewise most curiously contriv'd and adorn'd with
Images. This one thing alone is enough to discover the Ingenuity of these
People.</P>
<P>The City sends likewise for a Present to the Emperor, certain Fish, which
are taken before her Walls in the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>Iune,</HI> and are by the
<HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Siyu;</HI> but by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> who live there, they are call'd <HI>Savel;</HI>
and though the Way from <HI>Nanking</HI> to <HI>Peking</HI> be more than two hundred <HI>Dutch</HI>
Miles, yet they have a Way to Transport them to the Emperor's Court fresh
and good; for a great number of Men are appointed to draw the Boats Day
and Night, who are reliev'd upon the Way with fresh Men; so that they per∣form
the Iourney in eight or ten Days at the farthest, which is in a manner
with as much speed as riding Post in <HI>Europe.</HI> They likewise signifie by Letters
from Place to Place the Hours of the Day when the Barques are arriv'd; and
if the Emperor be pleas'd, they never fail to send twice a Week.</P>
<P>As we were Riding out one Day to take the Air, and to view the City, we
pass'd by the Gate of the old Imperial Court, where sat a great <HI>Tartar</HI> Lady,
with her Servants waiting upon her, about forty years of Age: she very ci∣villy
sent to our Interpreter to invite the Ambassadors into her House: <HI>Iacob
de Keyzer</HI> hereupon lighted, and the Lady then made towards him: She was
very debonair and free, look'd upon our Swords, and much admir'd their
bending without breaking: She took the Ambassadors Hat, and put it on
her own Head, and unbutton'd his Doublet almost down to his Waste: After∣wards
she led the way into the House, and desir'd him to follow, appointing
one of her Attendants to conduct him, who brought us into her Apartment,
where we found her with her Daughter, who was about half her Age, waiting
our coming, in great State: The Daughter was Cloth'd in a Violet-colour'd
Damask Gown, and the Mother in black Damask, and both of them had their
Ears hung with Rings, and their Hair braided and twisted about their Heads
with Strings of Pearls; but over their Hair they wore little Caps made of
Reed, with a Tassel upon the Crown, of red Silk: Their Clothes reach'd down
to their Heels, ty'd about the Middle with a broad Ribbon, and button'd down
from the Neck to the Waste: Their Shoes were of black Leather, their Fa∣ces
unmask'd, without any Painting: They had us into a large Withdraw∣ing-Room,
unfurnish'd, only a few Benches cover'd with Silk, upon which
they desir'd us to sit: They drank to us several times in their Liquor made of
Beans, which is very strong, but agrees wondrous well with their Constitu∣tions:
They set before us also some of their Sweet-meats, much intreating us
to Eat, excusing the meanness of the Entertainment, her Husband being ab∣sent.</P>
<P>Having taken leave of these Ladies, we Rid to see a famous Temple, which
the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Paolinxi;</HI> but this Name of <HI>Paolinxi,</HI> not only denominates
this Structure, but also a great Plain, which contains several Fanes, Edifices, a
<HI>Porcelane</HI> Tower, and other Rarities. Amongst other Buildings erected upon
<FIGURE>
<PB N="78" REF="50"/>
</FIGURE>
this Plain, they shew'd us one great Structure, which exceeded the rest in Art,
Beauty, and Cost, wherein hung at least ten thousand Images, all made of
Plaister; some were six Foot long, but the most were only one, which were
hung round about the Galleries and the Walls, in handsom and exact order.
The <HI>Heathen</HI> Priests receiv'd the Ambassadors with great Respect and Civility,
and set open all the Doors of their Temples.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Plain stands a high Steeple or Tower made of <HI>Porcelane,</HI>
which far exceed all other Workmanship of the <HI>Chineses</HI> in cost and skill; by
which the <HI>Chineses</HI> have declar'd to the World the rare Ingenuity of their Ar∣tists
in former Ages.</P>
<P>This Tower has nine Rounds, and a hundred eighty four Steps to the top;
each Round is adorn'd with a Gallery full of Images and Pictures, with very
handsom Lights: The outside is all Glaz'd over and Painted with several
Colours, as Green, Red, and Yellow. The whole Fabrick consists of several
Pieces, which are so artificially cemented, as if the Work were all one intire
Piece, Round about all the corners of the Galleries hang little Bells, which
make a very pretty noise when the Wind jangles them: The top of the
Tower was crown'd with a Pine-Apple, which (as they say) was made of
massie Gold: From the upper Gallery you may see not only over the whole
City, but also over the adjacent Countries to the other side of the River
<HI>Kiang,</HI> which is a most delightful Prospect, especially if you observe the vast
circumference of the City, reaching with her Suburb to the River side.</P>
<P>This wonderful Pile (as they inform us) the <HI>Chineses</HI> built at their own
Charges by the Command of the insulting Conqueror the <HI>Tartar</HI> seven hun∣dred
years since, as a Pillar of Honor to them, and when, in like manner as
lately, they over-ran all <HI>China,</HI> bringing the whole Country under absolute
Obedience. The now prevailing Foe, whether conquer'd by the extraordi∣nary
Beauty and Magnificence, or whether they design'd by it to perpetuate
the Memory of their first Conquests, and also to add to their Fame this their
second subduing of them, would not permit the demolishing or defacing in
the least of this noble Structure; so that now it stands firm and intire as at
first.</P>
<P>Round about this Plain are also Woods of Pine, where formerly were
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="50"/>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="51"/>
<PB N="79" REF="51"/>
built goodly Edifices, which were the Places of Enterment of their former
Emperors, but are now by the <HI>Tartars</HI> totally demolish'd.</P>
<P>According to all outward appearance, we found these People to exceed not
only all the rest of the Nation in Candor, Sincerity, and civil Demeanor, but
as much excelling in Science and Understanding. There are also several of the
Inhabitants of great Estates, keeping like Port both in their Habits and Hos∣pitality.
They enjoy here far greater Privileges than in a less City, which the
<HI>Tartars</HI> allow them, supposing that to be a Bridle to Rebellion.</P>
<P>We found in this City of <HI>Nanking</HI> a <HI>Iesuit,</HI> his Name <HI>Manuel Van Lisbon,</HI> who
came Aboard the Vessels of the Ambassadors, to Complement and invite them
to Dinner; but they civilly excus'd themselves: however, my self and the
Secretary accepted of the Invitation, and were very handsomly receiv'd and
Treated next Day by him, with some of the better sort of <HI>Chineses,</HI> who were
pleas'd with our Company; and to signifie that they were <HI>Christians,</HI> strook
upon their Breasts, and Cross'd themselves. This <HI>Iesuit</HI> was a very free, gal∣lant,
and open Spirit, earnestly desiring that we might have free Commerce
in <HI>China:</HI> He came often to see the Ambassadors, and Presented them with se∣veral
Provisions for the Table, inviting himself to Dinner at the same time.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors were very desirous to have writ from hence to <HI>Iapan,</HI> but
were inform'd that that Passage was forbidden; the reason said to be this:
The unshorn <HI>Chineses</HI> had complain'd three Years before to the Emperor, that
the <HI>Chineses</HI> of <HI>Snitjien</HI> and <HI>Amei</HI> (who belong'd to the famous Pyrate <HI>Coxinga)</HI>
had done them some Injury in <HI>Iapan,</HI> so that they desir'd the Emperor to right
them; who thereupon order'd, that they should go no more to <HI>Iapan.</HI></P>
<P>These unshorn <HI>Chineses</HI> are those who will not submit to the Government
of the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> nor cut their Hair after the Conqueror's fashion: for when
this Emperor had conquer'd all <HI>China,</HI> he issued forth a Command, That the
<HI>Chineses</HI> should wear their Hair after their manner, all cut off, except one Lock
behind; which caus'd some thousands of the <HI>Chineses</HI> (who are very proud of
this Ornament) to sacrifice their Lives to the rigor of the Laws, rather than
part with one single Tress.</P>
<P>Having spent about a Fortnight in receiving and giving of Visits, we de∣parted
from this famous City upon the 18. of <HI>May,</HI> early in the Morning.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors had made use by the Way of ordinary Barques and
Boats, till they came to this Place; but now they were accommodated by
the Governors, with the Emperor's own Vessels, to carry them on this their
Iourney. These Vessels were very large and commodious, all Gilded and
Painted with Dragons open-mouth'd, and looking fiercely. On one end of
these Imperial Bottoms was a place for Musick, to recreate the Passengers on
the Way; but the Ambassadors desir'd to spare them that trouble, and ap∣pointed
that Place for some <HI>Chinese</HI> Soldiers that came with them from <HI>Canton,</HI>
to Lodge in.</P>
<P>They have severe and corporal Punishments, whoever dares presume to
Paint any Yellow or Golden Dragons on their Vessels, or any thing else with∣out
leave, this Colour being made use of only by those whom the Emperor's
particular Favor admits to that high Honor.</P>
<P>Two great Imperial Vessels were appointed for the Ambassadors: the
<HI>Chinese</HI> Officers, as <HI>Pinxenton</HI> and the two <HI>Mandorins,</HI> had also two others; and
the <HI>Canton</HI> Soldiers were put Aboard with the Ambassadors, who were like∣wise
accompanied by several Persons from <HI>Nanking.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="52"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>After we had taken leave of the Governor and Magistrates of the City of
<HI>Nanking,</HI> we set Sail, and pass'd by the Ship-Bridge of fourteen Arches. On
the farthest Point of the Walls of the City, about two Miles from the Water-Gate
call'd <HI>Suisimon</HI> (where we first arriv'd with our Vessels) there stood a ve∣ry
famous and eminent Idol, to which the Mandorin <HI>Pinxenton,</HI> with the
whole Fleet, appli'd themselves, and Offer'd up to this Daemon or Genius of
the Place, Swine, Goats, and Cocks Blood, to the end we (which they verily
believ'd) might have a safe and prosperous Voyage.</P>
<P>The Sacrifice was perform'd after this manner: The Swine and Goats
were first kill'd and cleans'd, and afterwards laid upon the Altar: on the
side of this Altar stood several little Images, and behind the Altar the chiefest
Image, which is held for the Protector and Defender of this Temple, and to
whom it was Dedicated. The Cocks which I saw Offer'd, were kill'd, and
their Blood kept and sprinkled upon the Images, which afterwards they
wip'd clean. During the Ceremony of the Sacrifice, the Priests upon their
Knees made several Grimaces and Mutterings to themselves, as if they and the
God had been in some earnest Contract or Dispute, great Tapers burning all
that while.</P>
<P>After this Sacrifice we Steer'd our Course Eastward, and Sail'd down the
River <HI>Kiang</HI> with great speed, having the Stream with us; so that in the Even∣ing
we came to a famous Village call'd <HI>Wanksien,</HI> where we stay'd all Night,
and in the Morning early we set Sail, and came upon the 20. of <HI>Iune</HI> to the
City of <HI>Iejenjeen,</HI> which some call <HI>Loho.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Iejenjeen</HI> being the sixth and last small City of the Capital City of <HI>Nan∣king,</HI>
lies about sixty Miles from <HI>Nanking,</HI> on the North-side of the River
<HI>Kiang,</HI> whose Streams run into the large and open <HI>East-Indian Sea.</HI> Here came
several Beggars Aboard us to shew their Tricks; amongst the rest there were
two, who knock'd their Heads with so great force one against another, that
we look'd every moment to see them fall down dead upon the Place; and in
this Gesture they continu'd till the Company had bestow'd their Charity on
them: for unless they give them something, they never cease rencountring
Head till they kill each other, which has often hapned. I saw likewise in this
City another Beggar kneeling down, and seeming to mutter something to
<PB N="81" REF="52"/>
himself; after which he strook his bare Head against a round black Stone
with so much fore and violence, that he made the Earth to shake under him:
Several other such Feats they use, to win remorse from Strangers.</P>
<P>This small City of <HI>Iejenjeen,</HI> situate near to the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> is very delight∣ful,
though but small within the Walls, which are not very high, but strong
and thick: It is built mighty close, and adorn'd with several Temples and
Idolatrous Edifices; and has likewise a populous and well-built Suburb, and
much Trade, by which its Inhabitants are much enrich'd.</P>
<P>Whilst we stay'd in this City, the Interpreters told us, That the famous
Pyrate <HI>Coxinga</HI> had Landed some Forces, with an Intention to have surpriz'd
this Place, and to have brought the same under his Subjection; but through
the care of the Inhabitants he not only lost his Design, but also a great
number of his Men, and was forc'd to retreat to his Ships with shame and
confusion: yet to shew his Malice, and to revenge himself upon the Citizens,
he burnt several of their Vessels which lay at an Anchor before the City, and
carried away others with him to a considerable number. They also told us,
that about twenty Miles from this Place, there were five great and fruitful
Islands in the same River <HI>Kiang,</HI> in which this Pyrate had chosen to harbor and
shelter his Ships in stormy Weather.</P>
<P>Having lain all Night before this City, we set Sail early in the Morning,
and the next Day we found upon the North side of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> near to a
Castle call'd <HI>Ruancheu,</HI> a large Stone Sluce, at the Head of a Channel, the Work
onely of the Spade, forc'd quite through the Country, to get into the <HI>Yellow
River.</HI> so to avoid the trouble of Sailing round about out of one River into
another.</P>
<P>These Artificial Channels, by reason of their wideness, and the greatness
of the Undertaking, and being made at the Emperor's Charge, are call'd <HI>The
King's Waters.</HI></P>
<P>We then pass'd by this Sluce, and so came into the first <HI>Royal Channel,</HI> and
from thence we got into the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> Well may this Channel bear the
Name of <HI>The Royal Water,</HI> since there is nothing more pleasant to be seen in
all the World; both sides of the <HI>Aquaeduct</HI> having not onely smooth large
Banks, but planted also with stately and shady Trees. On the West and East
of this <HI>Royal Channel</HI> (for it reaches from South to North) we saw rich Pa∣stures
and delightful Woods, the like not to be seen in all <HI>Asia,</HI> intermingled
with abundance of Wealthy Towns, Villages, pleasant Seats, and opulent
and stately Dwelling, insomuch that nothing can be more delightful; as if
Art and Nature had strove to please the Passenger upon his way through this
famous Channel. On one side thereof stood a famous and renown'd Image
of the Idol <HI>Kinkang,</HI> who is highly ador'd by the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>In the Passage we saw at a distance another great and artificial Idol-Tem∣ple,
which was adorn'd with a very brave Tower of six Rounds, and by the
<HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Quangguamiau.</HI> A particular Person out of a mistaken religious
Zeal, erected at his own Charge this Idol, in honor of this Temple, which
stands in a large and pleasant Field, and is surrounded with many Houses,
whose Inhabitants and their Neighbors Offer up to this Idol with great De∣votion,
all manner of Fruits, besides Beasts, Cocks, Hogs, Swine, and Goats,
that so they may be successful in their Labors, and enjoy a plentiful Harvest.
All Travellets who pass this way, bring commonly with them fat and rich
Offerings to this Idol, their Temple Protector. The <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> who
<FIGURE>
<PB N="82" REF="53"/>
</FIGURE>
accompanied us from <HI>Canton</HI> to <HI>Peking,</HI> were very desirous to have stay'd here
a while, till they had perform'd their Devotions (according to the Custom of
the Countrey) in Offering up Cocks, Hogs, and Goats, for the procurement of
a prosperous Voyage; but the Ambassadors were unwilling to stay their
Iourney, and could not be prevail'd with to lose so much time, but resolv'd to
hasten their Voyage, being weary of their vain Superstition: However, they
gave leave to some to go ashore to see this famous Structure, which shews very
handsomly at a distance, being artificially built after the <HI>Chinese</HI> fashion; and
within adorn'd with abundance of great and small Images (for amongst all
other Idolaters, the <HI>Chineses</HI> exceed in decoration of their Temples) which are
fix'd to the Walls. At the upper end stood a great Altar, where they Present
their Sacrifices to the Idol: Round about (as is to be seen in most of the Stru∣ctures)
hang abundance of heavy Lamps, which burn Night and Day in ho∣nor
of this God, and the Departed.</P>
<P>Upon the 24. we came to the brave City of <HI>Iamcefu,</HI> which is call'd by some
<HI>Yaucqeu,</HI> and is reckon'd for the seventh Capital City of this famous Province
of <HI>Nanking.</HI> This City lies about twenty Miles from <HI>Iejenjeen,</HI> is built four-square,
and surrounded with Walls and strong Bulwarks: It is very large,
being at least five Miles about, exceeding most Cities in <HI>China</HI> for Wealth and
Trade.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this City deal in several Commodities; but that where∣in
their chief Trade consists is Salt, Transported from thence into most Pro∣vinces
of <HI>China.</HI> This Salt is made of Sea-Water, after the manner of ours in
<HI>Europe.</HI> On the East-side of the City we saw standing a great many Salt-Pans,
wherein they boil Sea-Liquor Day and Night. This Trade alone has
so very much enrich'd the Inhabitants of this Town, that they have re-built
their City since the last destruction by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> erecting it in as great Splen∣dor
as it was at first.</P>
<P>In no Place of all <HI>China</HI> are found more comely, and better humor'd Wo∣men,
than in this City: The Virgins, as also the married Women, have very
small Feet, and handsom Legs; so that it passes for a common Proverb
among the <HI>Chineses, That if a Man will have a Wife slender of Body, brown Hair, and
with a handsom Leg and Foot, he must come to this City of Iamcefu.</HI> But yet in no Place
in all <HI>China</HI> Women bear so inconsiderable a Rate; for it is lawful both to
<FIGURE>
<PB N="83" REF="53"/>
</FIGURE>
Parents and Masters to sell their Servants and Daughters to Gentlemen that
will buy them, to be their prostituted Harlots.</P>
<P>No sooner were we Landed in this City, but the Mandorin <HI>Pinxenton</HI> went
in great State to Salute and Complement the Commissioner of his Imperial
Majesty, and Presented him with four Pieces of red Cloths in behalf of the
Ambassadors.</P>
<P>The Emperor hath here a Toll-house, where the Customs are paid for all
such Wares as pass. The City is well built, and hath several Channels run∣ning
through it, over which are many Stone Bridges. On the West-side are
very large Suburbs, which were formerly full of goodly Structures, but were
most of them destroy'd in the last <HI>Tartar</HI> War, yet have begun since to be re∣edifi'd.
There are also several Temples, curiously built, and most richly
adorn'd. Near this City is a very high Mountain, call'd <HI>Heng.</HI></P>
<P>Next Day being the 25. we departed from this Place, and upon the Verge
of this Royal Channel we saw twelve Stone Ovens; and not far from thence,
on the other side of the Channel lies the famous Burial-City of the Great <HI>Sultan,</HI>
much ador'd and worshipp'd by the <HI>Chineses.</HI> About Noon we came to a Vil∣lage
call'd <HI>Saupoo,</HI> where at the same time the <HI>Chineses</HI> were celebrating the
Feast of the new Year on the New-years day, being then also Full-Moon,
great Acclamations and Expressions of Ioy, signifi'd by their lighting of so
many Candles and Bonefires, as if the whole City had been in one great
Flame. They run likewise up and down the Streets in their Nocturnals like
so many distracted Bacchanals, with Tapers in their Hands, twisted together
in the form of Dragons. We were forc'd to stay here a while, till the Mando∣rin
<HI>Pinxenton</HI> and his Lady also assisted at the Solemnity of this Feast.</P>
<P>We found lying about this Village, in this Royal Channel, a great number
of all manner of strange built Vessels; but the most to be admir'd at were two
Barques or Sloops, which by the <HI>Chineses</HI> are call'd <HI>Longschon,</HI> which signifies
<HI>A Serpent-Boat.</HI> These two Vessels were built after a particular fashion, very
curiously Painted with all manner of Colours, that they seem'd much to ex∣ceed
those Boats which carry the Fish from <HI>Nanking</HI> to <HI>Peking</HI> for the Empe∣ror's
use.</P>
<P>The Mould or Cast of this fair Bottom was much like the Form of our
Water-Snake: The Stern hung full of strange Serpents, fastned with Ribbons
<PB N="84" REF="54"/>
of several Colours, which made a gallant show. At the Stern of one of these
Vessels hung likewise two nimble Boys, who play'd Tricks and Gambols to
delight the Spectators both above, and by Diving under Water. Upon the
top of each Mast, which were three in all, stood an Idol, very curiously
adorn'd with Silk Flags and Pennons: In like manner stood on the Poop an
Image dress'd with Ducks and Drakes. The Stern was also fill'd with Stan∣dards,
set out with Tassels of Hair, Silk Flags, and long Feathers; the Boat
cover'd round with Silk. Under an upper high-rais'd Desk, full of Flags and
Standards, sat twelve lusty Seamen, with gilt Crowns upon their Heads,
Cloth'd in Silk, their Arms naked; these were so dexterous at Rowing, that
the Boat went at an extraordinary rate: They came Aboard of the Ambas∣sadors,
and seem'd to be overjoy'd at their Arrival: The Ambassadors requi∣ted
their Kindness with a return of some Presents; which they willingly ac∣cepted,
wishing them good Success in their Voyage, and a safe Return into
their own Country. Near the Ducks stood a <HI>Chinese</HI> with a Fork in his Hand,
and long Feathers in his Cap, who continually tortur'd these poor Creatures,
putting them in perpetual Disquiet.</P>
<P>The next Day, being the 26. of <HI>May,</HI> we came to the City of <HI>Cajutsia,</HI> which
is also call'd by some <HI>Caoyeu,</HI> and is reckon'd for the fourth small City of the
Capital <HI>Yancheu.</HI> This City we found lying upon the side of this Royal Wa∣ter,
near a great Pool which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Piexe,</HI> out of which runs plenty of
Water into this famous Channel. Formerly all such Vessels as came from
<HI>Nanking,</HI> bound for <HI>Peking</HI> and the Northern Provinces, were glad to pass
over this Pool, to the great hindrance of Commerce and Navigation; for
oftentimes in a foul Season, they lay Weather-bound before this City of <HI>Caoyeu,</HI>
there being no venturing over the Pool, till the Wind were more silent, and
the swelling Billows more calm; so that for the benefit of Commerce and
safety of their Voyage, on the East-side of the Pool this Navigable Channel
was made sixty Fathom long, Wall'd in with white Stone: A Work so noble
and excellent, that it is much to be admir'd, especially considering the great
quantity of white Stones there us'd, there being no such Quarry in the adja∣cent
Parts.</P>
<P>This <HI>Caoyeu</HI> is very populous, and has stately Suburbs, built very close, and
full of great Houses.</P>
<P>The Country round about produces great store of Rice, and is so full of
Buildings, as if it were all but one continu'd Village. Toward the West the
Country lies much under Water; but upon the Sides and Banks grows store
of Reed, which brings in a good Revenue yearly to the Publick, and is the
onely Firing they have; for no Trees will grow in this part of the Country.
They boast likewise of store of Windmills, whose Sails are made of Mats.
The great Product of the Country consists of Rice, which the Peasant stands
oblig'd to look after very narrowly, lest it perish upon the Ground by too
much Moisture, or too much Heat and Drought; so that their Eyes are con∣tinually
upon the Crop, otherwise it suddenly withers to nothing, or a small
Increase: The Windmills therefore are to draw out the Water in a moist
Season, or to let it in as they think fit, to keep their Hopes from burning up
in a dry and hot Season; so that by this means the <HI>Chineses</HI> enjoy twice a Year
a plentiful Harvest.</P>
<P>Upon the 27. of <HI>May,</HI> after that we had Lodg'd all Night before the City of
<HI>Caoyeu,</HI> we set Sail, and came to the City of <HI>Paoing,</HI> which is held for the sixth
<FIGURE>
<PB N="85" REF="54"/>
</FIGURE>
small City under the Iurisdiction of this Capital City <HI>Yangcheu.</HI> This City is
situate upon the East-side of the Royal Navigation, and surrounded with
strong Walls, built in an orbicular form, and containing about a Mile and a
half in circumference: It lies twenty Miles from <HI>Caoyeu;</HI> toward the East
bordering upon the Pool of <HI>Xeyang,</HI> and toward the South-West on the Pool
of <HI>Piexe.</HI></P>
<P>By the Ruines of the Wall and great Edifices, this City appears to have
been formerly a very famous Place, rich and populous, but was totally de∣stroy'd
in the late War by the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Amongst other Edifices which are yet
standing, is a most famous Idol-Temple, without the Wall on the North-side
of the City, built after the fashion of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> The Royal Channel runs
quite through the Country up to the very Walls, by which means they water
their Grounds in a dry Season. This part of the Country is also full of Drain∣ing-Mills,
to be us'd upon occasion.</P>
<P>Upon the 28. we came to the famous Sea-Town of <HI>Hoaigan,</HI> which is rec∣kon'd
for the eighth Capital City of this Province of <HI>Nanking:</HI> It lies on the
East-side of the Royal River, about thirty <HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Pancien,</HI> in a flat
and Morish Soil: through the midst thereof runs a Wall, seeming to make two
distinct Towns; but another Wall which surrounds both Divisions, takes
away the distinction, and renders it one intire City: That part which lies
toward the South is call'd <HI>Hoaigan,</HI> and the other toward the North-East,
<HI>Yengehing:</HI> The former of these has stately Suburbs, well built, and full of
People. On one side of this City we saw the Fields full of Tombs and Grave-stones.</P>
<P>In this Capital City the Vice-Roy keeps his Court in great Splendor and
State; he has full Power over the seven Southerly Provinces, and only owns
the Emperor for his Supreme Head. His Office is to look after the <HI>Grand
Cham</HI>'s Revenue, consisting chiefly in Provisions of Rice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which when got
in, is afterwards Transported to <HI>Peking</HI> in his Majesties own Vessels.</P>
<P>On the North-side of the City we saw three great Torrents of Water; the
first of which, and nearest to the River <HI>Hoai,</HI> is very dangerous, and by its In∣undations
has often done great harm. To prevent this River from overflow∣ing
the adjacent Countries, they have rais'd and made two great Sluces, with
strong Banks on both sides, which confine him in his highest Tide.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="55"/>
In the Suburb of <HI>Hoaigan</HI> stand two Toll-houses; in the one the Custom is
paid of all Goods and Merchandises which pass this Way; in the other, of
the Ships which belong to the Subjects: and with some part of this Money
they maintain their Dikes and Sluces for the defence of the City against the
sudden and violent Ruptures of Water.</P>
<P>Though this City be built upon a Morish Ground, yet the Country about it
is very fruitful in the product of Rice and Corn: The City is well built, and
full of wealthy Citizens.</P>
<P>Not far from hence lies a famous Mountain, which shoots to the Sky, by the
<HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Yocheu,</HI> upon which stands a stately Temple, with Cloysters to
Lodge those who daily Offer to the Idol of the Place. The <HI>Chineses</HI> come from
several Parts with Presents to this their God, suppos'd the Protector and De∣fender
of their Country.</P>
<P>This Province of <HI>Nanking</HI> abounds with strange Mountains; for in the
Country of the second Chief City <HI>Fungyang,</HI> near the seventh small City <HI>Xeu,</HI>
upon a Hill call'd <HI>Cukin,</HI> was found a great lump of massie Gold, said to be
soveraign in several Distempers. Some will have it, because this Gold cures
so many Diseases, that Chymists made it. In the same Country, near to the
City of <HI>Hintai,</HI> there is a notable Mountain call'd <HI>Moyang,</HI> and known by the
Name of <HI>The Shepherdesses Hill,</HI> because, as they say, a very fair Virgin for∣merly
kept her Flocks there.</P>
<P>The whole Country of this <HI>Hoaigan</HI> has several Rivers running through it,
and is also replenish'd with many Lakes. Amongst other Pools, you have
here the great Pool of <HI>Xeho,</HI> which toward the North is situated next to the
great <HI>Indian Sea,</HI> and waters various Parts of this Country, which abounds
with Fish.</P>
<P>Towards the East of the Chief City lies also a great Pool call'd <HI>Hung,</HI> pro∣ducing
great store of Reeds, which serve them for Firing, Wood being very
scarce through the whole Province.</P>
<P>No sooner were the Ambassadors arriv'd before this Capital City, but they
sent for Horses, <HI>Palakins,</HI> and Litters, to go and salute the Vice-Roy and the
Magistrates; but because the Weather was foul, the Governors sent a Mes∣senger
to the Ambassadors, to thank them for their intended Visit, desiring
to be excus'd from giving them the like trouble. The <HI>Mandorine Pinxenton,</HI>
according to his wonted custom, gave us a very Noble Dinner upon that
Day. In the Evening came Father <HI>Gascomer</HI> (a <HI>Iesuit,</HI> who lived in the City)
to salute the Ambassadors aboard their Vessels, and to bid them welcome into
those Parts. He was very pleasant and civil, but did so admire at our arri∣val,
as if we had dropt out of the Sky, being very inquisitive to know whi∣ther
we were bound, and upon what account we came thither. The Ambas∣sadors
shew'd themselves courteous and civil to him, giving him a handsom
Entertainment for his Visit. He seem'd to be a very open-hearted Person,
and made protestation of a particular Inclination and Affection to our Nati∣on,
offering the Ambassadors his House, if they pleas'd to accept thereof, or
any other Service he could do them. He gave them likewise darkly to under∣stand,
That upon their Request and Desire of Free Trade in <HI>China,</HI> or any
thing else, they would meet with great opposition at <HI>Peking</HI> from the <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI>
who would do their utmost to hinder it, as we found afterwards in the
Sequel of our Business. The Ambassadors were very thankful to this Good
Father for his kind and faithful Admonition, who thereupon took leave,
wishing us a prosperous Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="55"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>We staid not long in this City, but departed the next day early in the Mor∣ning;
and in our Passage we saw on both sides luxurious Fields, well manur'd,
as likewise a great Company of small Boats lying up and down in this <HI>Royal
Channel.</HI> About Sun-set we came to a famous Village call'd <HI>Siampu,</HI> at the en∣trance
whereof lies a very great Sluce, through which we past.</P>
<P>This Village is situated betwixt the <HI>Royal Channel</HI> and the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> and
is of a very great length, handsomly adorn'd with Temples, and fair Houses
on both sides of the Water: It has some Privileges belonging to it, as also
a Toll-house, where the Toll-masters appointed by the Emperor reside, to
receive Toll of all such Goods and Vessels which pass out of the <HI>Yellow River</HI>
into the <HI>Royal Channel,</HI> or out of the <HI>Royal Channel</HI> into the <HI>Yellow River;</HI> or such
as are brought out of the Province of <HI>Honan</HI> and other Parts, and are carried
up higher or lower. One of these Toll-masters shew'd himself far more scru∣pulous
than all the rest, searching all our Vessels, except those two in which
the Ambassadors were, to see what was in them; for he could not believe that
they were all laden with Goods belonging only to the Emperor. We Lodg'd
all Night in this Village, and set Sail early in the Morning, and came that
Night to another Village call'd <HI>Neynemiao,</HI> into which we were let by two great
Sluces, one after another: The Inhabitants told us, as indeed appear'd by the
Ruines, that in this Village formerly stood a great Castle, which protected
three Rivers, as the <HI>Yellow River</HI> on both sides, and the <HI>Royal Channel</HI> behind it:
But the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who made it their business to destroy all Inland Places of
Strength, had likewise pull'd down this Castle. We Lodg'd there all Night,
and the next Day at Sun-rising we set Sail again, and came into a part of the
great <HI>Yellow River,</HI> which is so thick and muddy, that it is scarce passable.</P>
<P>This River is call'd by some <HI>The Saffron,</HI> from the yellowness of the Water:
at a distance it seems to be a thick Morish Plash, but when you come upon it,
the swiftness and great force of the Stream declares a running River, whose
Current hath so much violence, that no Boats are able to Sail against the
Stream, but are Tow'd up by a great number of Bargemen. In some places
this River is half a Mile broad, and in some more; but in length it reaches
above eight hundred Miles: The <HI>Chinese</HI> Sailors, when employ'd here, make
this Water fit for use, and very clear, by flinging Allom into it, which sinks
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Mud to the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="56"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Upon the first of <HI>Iune</HI> we came to the little Town of <HI>Tanjenien,</HI> which is the
fourth small City under the Iurisdiction of the Chief City of <HI>Hoaigan:</HI> It is
situate on the side of the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> and fenc'd with a broad, strong Earthen
or Mud Wall, replenish'd with handsom Buildings, and full of rich Inhabi∣tants,
who drive a very great Trade.</P>
<P>The Country round is very fruitful in the product of Pears, Apples, Prunes,
Cherries, and the like. We bought here some Provisions for the Kitchin at a
very reasonable Rate. These Parts likewise abound in Quails, Pheasants,
and other sorts of Fowl.</P>
<P>We made no long stay here, but departed before Night, and Sail'd at least
three Days upon this <HI>Yellow River,</HI> before we came to any considerable Place:
at last, upon the fourth of the same Month we drew near to the small Town
of <HI>Tsisang,</HI> situate in a very delightful Soil, and at the Foot of a high Hill. This
Town has no remarkable Buildings, nor Walls, only one strong Castle; but
yet of great Trade, and has many rich Inhabitants, who Traffick much with
their Shipping. At the entrance into the Town stands a stately Temple upon
a steep Summit, seen in Prospect at a great distance.</P>
<P>We saw likewise upon this <HI>Yellow River,</HI> which is continually plow'd with
all manner of great and small Vessels, not far from the Town, several float∣ing
Islands, which were so artificially contriv'd, that the best Artists in <HI>Europe</HI>
would scarcely be able to make the like of the same Stuff; being a common
Reed which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Bamboes,</HI> twisted so close together, that no Moi∣sture
can penetrate. Upon these Reeds the <HI>Chineses</HI> set up Huts, and little
Houses of Boards, and other light Materials, in which they live with their
Wives and Children, as if they had their Dwellings upon the Firm Land.
Some of these Floating Islands are large enough to contain at least 200 Fami∣lies;
and those that live in them subsist for the most part by Commerce and
Trafflck in all manner of Commodities, which they carry from Place to
Place upon the River, being hurried down with the Stream, and tow'd up
again by toilsom Bargemen. Wherever they intend to make any stay, they
fasten their Floating Town with Poles fix'd in the Ground. They keep and
feed aboard their Island all manner of Tame Cattel, but especially Hogs.
Wheresoever they come, they continue lying for some Months before they
remove; and though they are People of several Languages, yet they make
<PB N="89" REF="56"/>
up one common Tongue, whereby they understand one another; for through∣out
all <HI>China</HI> there are several Dialects, each Province having a particular one;
yet there is also one common Language, which they call the <HI>Mandorins</HI> or
<HI>Court-Tongue,</HI> being spoke here both by the Grandees and their Followers.</P>
<P>After some hours Sailing we came into another Royal Channel call'd <HI>Iun,</HI>
issuing out of the <HI>Yellow River</HI> toward the West through the whole Province of
<HI>Xantung:</HI> We were to pass through this Channel to the City of <HI>Peking.</HI> The
Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> into which we enter'd, is much enriched by this artificial
Channel running through it; for all Goods and Commodities which are
Transported out of <HI>China</HI> for <HI>Peking,</HI> must pass this Cut.</P>
<P>This great, broad, and Navigable Stream begins at the ninth small City
<HI>Socien,</HI> upon the side of the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> and reaches to the City <HI>Cining,</HI> and
from thence to <HI>Lincing,</HI> there breaking into the River <HI>Guei.</HI> This Channel hath
at least sixty Stone Sluces to force back the Water, which in some places runs
very low, and would not be Navigable, were it not for these Water-works:
On each Sluce eight Men attend to help through with the Vessels, who are
maintain'd at the Publick Charge.</P>
<P>As soon as we came into this Channel, we were presently in the Province
of <HI>Xantung,</HI> and upon the sixth of <HI>Iune</HI> came to a famous Village call'd <HI>Kia∣kia.</HI>
But before I give you a Description of this Province, I shall continue my
Method, and first relate unto you the Confines thereof, and the number of
great and small Cities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> is the fourth in number under the Northern
Countries, and is wash'd on the South, East, and North, by the Sea, and on
the West-side is environ'd with Rivers, insomuch that you may come by
Shipping if you please. On the North of <HI>Xantung</HI> lies the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI>
and on the South that of <HI>Nanking,</HI> separated by the <HI>Yellow River;</HI> the remaining
part is encompass'd with the Channel <HI>Iun,</HI> and the River <HI>Guei.</HI></P>
<P>This part produces abundance of Corn, Rice, Beans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The fruitfulness
of this Country is such, that one years Harvest, as they say, supplies the Inha∣bitants
sufficiently for ten Years with Provisions. All manner of Poultry is
wondrous plentiful, and sold for very little, because the People there take
great delight in Hunting. The Rivers, Pools, and other Waters, abound with
extraordinary good Fish, which you may have for a very small Price, I my
self purchasing ten Pound for a Halfpeny. The Country produces likewise
store of Silk, another sign of her Fertility; and abounds in all manner of
Fruit-Trees, especially Pruines, which they dry and carry thence to sell in
other Provinces.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are generally very dull of understanding, and few of them
addicted to Learning; but they are for the most part very strong bodied, fit
to undergo any Labor. The Children do not only go naked in the Winter,
but will leap into the cold Water: Several of them live by Theft and Rob∣bery;
and these Companies are oftentimes so numerous, that they break
through all opposition whatsoever, when they make Inroads to plunder the
Country, which is already much ruin'd by the late Invasion.</P>
<P>In this whole Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> lie six Capital Cities, twenty nine small
Cities, and thirteen Carrisons. The six great Cities are, <HI>Cinan, Yencheu, Tung∣chang,
Cingcheu, Tengche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and <HI>Laicheu.</HI></P>
<P>Cinan <HI>Commands over thirty Cities, as</HI> Cinan, Changkieu, Ceuping, Chagxan,
Sinching, Ciho, Citung Ciyang, Chihuen, Iuching, Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye, Changcing, Fiching, Cingching,
<PB N="90" REF="57"/>
Ling, Taigan, Siniai, Laivu, Te, Teping, Pingyven, Vuting, Yangsin, Haifung, Laling,
Xangho, Pin, Lioin, Chenhoa, <HI>and</HI> Putahi.</P>
<P>Yencheu <HI>Commands over 26 Cities, as</HI> Yencheu, Kioheu, Niuyang, Ceu, Teng, Ye,
Kiuhiang, Yutai, Tan, Chingvu, Cao, Tingtao, Cining, Kiaciang, Kiuye, Kiunching,
Tungping, Venxang, Tungpo, Pingyn, Iangco, Xeuchang, Wy, Tanching, Fi, <HI>and</HI>
Suxui.</P>
<P>Tungchang <HI>Commands over eight Cities, as</HI> Tungchang, Tangye, Poping, Cho∣angping,
Kieu, Sin, Cingping, Ken, Lincing, Quontao, Caotang, Gen, Hiacin, Vucing,
Po, Fan, Quonching, <HI>and</HI> Chaoching.</P>
<P>Cingcheu <HI>Commands over 14 Cities, as</HI> Cingcheu, Linchi, Pohing, Caoyven, Logan,
Xeuquang, Changlo, Linkiu, Gankiu, Chuching, Mungin, Kiu, Yxui, <HI>and</HI> Gechao.</P>
<P>Tengcheu <HI>Commands over eight Cities, as</HI> Tengcheu, Hoang, Foxan, Leuhid,
Chaoyven, Laiyang, Ninghai, <HI>and</HI> Vemeng.</P>
<P>Laicheu <HI>Commands over seven Cities, as</HI> Laicheu, Pingtu, Vi, Changye, Kiao,
Caomi, <HI>and</HI> Gieme.</P>
<P><HI>The thirteen Garrisons are,</HI> Nincing, Cinghai, Chingxan, Gueihai, Sanxan, Kixan,
Civenxan, Mauan, Siaoye, Haicang, Punglai, Cin, <HI>and</HI> Xechin.</P>
<P>In this Province there are also several Islands, amongst which these three
are the chiefest: as first, <HI>Feuxeu,</HI> which lies toward the West, is but small, yet
exceeding well built. The second is <HI>Teuhang,</HI> situate in the Sea near to <HI>Caomy:</HI>
This Island is very famous, by reason of a sad Accident of five hundred <HI>Chi∣nese</HI>
Philosophers, who drown'd themselves in the Sea, because the Emperor
<HI>Xuis</HI> hated all Learned Men as mortal Enemies. The third Island is <HI>Xaumen,</HI>
the biggest, and fullest of People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Accompt-Book, which comprehends the number of People in
each Place, mentions in this Province, Seven hundred and seventy thousand
five hundred and sixty Families, Sixty seven hundred fifty nine thousand six
hundred and seventy Fighting Men.</P>
<P>The yearly Revenue of the Province, belonging to the Emperor, consists
of Twenty eight hundred twelve thousand one hundred and nineteen Bags
of Corn, Fifty four thousand nine hundred and nineteen Rolls of Throw'd
Silk, Fifty two thousand four hundred and forty nine Pounds of Cotton, and
Thirty eight hundred twenty four thousand two hundred and nineteen
Trusses of Straw and Hay for the Emperor's Stables, besides several Tolls
paid upon the Royal Channel of <HI>Iun,</HI> which amounts yearly to ten Millions
of Golden Crowns.</P>
<P>This Village <HI>Kia-kia</HI> lies encompass'd with pleasant and fruitful Fields,
most delightful to behold; and is very rich, well built, and handsomly adorn'd
with indifferent large Structures. The Fields round about are full of Rose∣mary,
which are not only very pleasant to the Eye, but also cast a fragrant
smell at a great distance before you come near them. We saw likewise not far
from the City several Herds of Stags and Bucks, and abundance of all sorts of
Fowl, especially Pheasants. We took great delight in Hunting the Stag,
whereof we kill'd several, with the assistance of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who are skilful
at the Game. They were very much pleas'd with our way of shooting Phea∣sants
flying. The Flesh of these Deer tastes so much of Rosemary, as if the
Venison were season'd with the Sprigs.</P>
<P>We were three days upon this Channel <HI>Iun,</HI> before we reach'd any other
considerable Place; but upon the eleventh of the same Month we arriv'd at
a famous Village call'd <HI>Iax-Hinno,</HI> situated upon the <HI>Royal Channel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="57"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In and about this Village stand 36 stately Towers, built rarely well, on ei∣ther
side of the River. Here we lay all Night, but the next Morning set Sail
by Day-break, and that Day and the next we saw upon each Bank of the Ri∣ver,
great store of good Corn-Ground.</P>
<P>Toward the East of this Royal Channel lie several high and great Hills,
whereof these following are the chiefest.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Taigan,</HI> the sixteenth small City of <HI>Cinnan,</HI> appears a Mountain call'd
<HI>Tai,</HI> which is very steep and broad: the <HI>Chinese</HI> Geographers say, that it is at
least five Miles in heighth from the Basis to the Crown. Upon this Mountain
are several Temples, to which belong great store of Priests, who live after the
same manner as the <HI>Calvisians</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Laivu,</HI> the eighteenth small City under the Iurisdiction of this
Place, arises the Mountain <HI>Taxe,</HI> in which they find great store of Iron.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Ciohu,</HI> the second small City under the Chief City <HI>Yengcheu,</HI> is the
Mountain call'd <HI>Fang,</HI> very famous for the Tomb where the Ancestors of that
Learned <HI>Chinese</HI> Philosopher <HI>Confutius</HI> lies Interr'd.</P>
<P>Not far from the fourth small City <HI>Ceu,</HI> lies a Mountain call'd <HI>Changping,</HI>
upon which (as the <HI>Chineses</HI> report) <HI>Confutius</HI> was born, in a Town also call'd
<HI>Changping,</HI> the Ruins whereof are still to be seen.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Tunping,</HI> the eighth small City of the said Capital City, stands a
great Mountain call'd <HI>Fung,</HI> full of Wood and goodly Pastures.</P>
<P>Upon the thirteenth of the same Month we came to <HI>Cinningsin</HI> or <HI>Cining,</HI> the
fourteenth small City under the Command of the second Chief City <HI>Yengcheu.</HI></P>
<P>In this <HI>Cining</HI> the Ambassadors were nobly Treated in the absence of the
Governor, by the Agents of the young <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roy, he being gone from
home, to order the making of a Fence-work against the breaking in of the
<HI>Yellow River.</HI></P>
<P>This City is encompass'd with flat and Morass Lands, lying about a hun∣dred
and thirty Miles from <HI>Tanjencien,</HI> situate about the middle of the Royal
Channel <HI>Iun;</HI> so that all Vessels which use this Pass, must pay Custom both
for Ship and Goods. It exceeds not only all the other twenty six small Cities
situate in the Iurisdiction of the fore-mention'd Capital City, in number of
People, greatness of Trade, and Gentry, but also the Chief City it self.
Among other stately Edifices, there are two famous Temples, richly adorn'd
<FIGURE>
<PB N="92" REF="58"/>
</FIGURE>
with great and small Pictures: On both sides of the <HI>Royal Channel</HI> are great
Suburbs, full of People and Trade; on both sides of the River are also two
great Sluces, which keep off the out-water, which sometimes rises six Foot
higher than the Water within.</P>
<P>The Country round about this City lies low and plashy, being full of Pools
and Rivers, which abound with Fish.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Cao,</HI> the twelfth small City, is a Lake call'd <HI>Lui,</HI> which signifies
<HI>The Thunder-Pool;</HI> in the middle whereof appears a Stone, representing a Dra∣gon
with the Head of a Man. The <HI>Chineses</HI> call this <HI>The Spirit of Thunder,</HI> and
affirm, That when any one strikes upon the Belly, he draws a hideous sound
from the Monster like Thunder.</P>
<P>Near to the third small city <HI>Nynyang,</HI> which is likewise under the Com∣mand
of the Capital City <HI>Yengcheu,</HI> and about two Miles from <HI>Cining,</HI> runs a
small River call'd <HI>Tao,</HI> out of which the <HI>Chineses</HI> report, That the great Philo∣sopher
<HI>Confutius</HI> refus'd to drink, though ready to die of Thirst, because it was
call'd <HI>The Water of Thieves;</HI> so great an aversion had this Ethnick Philosopher
to the very Name of wicked Villany and Robbers.</P>
<P>About this City we saw them catch Fish with a Bird, which they call <HI>Lou∣wa,</HI>
being somewhat less than a Goose, and not much unlike a Raven: it has
a long Neck, and a Bill like an Eagle. Because this way of Fishing seems no∣table,
and no where us'd but in <HI>China,</HI> I thought good to relate the manner,
which is thus: They have small Boats, very artificially made of Reeds or
<HI>Bamboes,</HI> with which they Sail upon the <HI>Chinese</HI> Rivers and Pools, and place
the Bird perching upon the out-side of the Vessel, from whence she suddenly
shoorts, and diving, swims under Water as fast as they can thrust forward their
Cables with a light Pole: As soon as she has caught her Prey, she instantly
appears above Water, the Master of the Boat standing ready to receive her,
who opens her Bill by force, and takes out the Dainty: Afterwards he turns
her out again to catch more. To prevent these Birds from swallowing down
the Prey, they hang a Ring about their Necks, which hinders them from
gorging: Such Fish as are too big for them to bring up in their Bills, they
discover to their Masters, by making a noise in the Water, who then helps to
pull them out. Such Birds as are slothful and loth to dive, are broken of that
ill habit by beating. When they have caught enough for their Owners, the
<FIGURE>
<PB N="93" REF="58"/>
</FIGURE>
Iron Ring is taken off, and they are left to fish for themselves, which makes
them the more willing to work for others. The Fishermen pay a yearly Tri∣bute
to the Emperor for the use of these Birds, which are in much esteem with
the <HI>Chineses;</HI> and such as are nimble, and well taught, are so dear, that often∣times
one of them goes at 50 <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver, which is about 150 <HI>Guilders.</HI> We
offer'd to buy of an old Fisherman a couple of these Birds; but he refus'd,
alledging, That they serv'd to maintain him and his Family; neither could he
inform us whence those Birds came, nor how they were first instructed;
onely he told us, That they were left him by his Ancestors. We ask'd him
likewise whether they ever bred with him; who answer'd, Very rarely. We
bought a Dish of Fish of this old Man, which were most of them Carps of
a Span and half long.</P>
<P>All the Inns and Publick Victualling-houses have their Fidlers and Co∣medians
belonging to them, to recreate their Guests at Meals. Provisions of
all sorts are very cheap in those Parts: We paid but two Shillings a piece for
our Dinner, which consisted of several Dishes; out of which the Players
were likewise discharg'd by our Host.</P>
<P>The next day we departed from <HI>Cining,</HI> and, after a few Hours Sailing,
we past by a Village call'd <HI>Nanwaig,</HI> lying on the Bank of this <HI>Royal Channel,</HI>
where this and the River <HI>Luen</HI> meet and mingle their Waters. The <HI>Tartars</HI>
and <HI>Chineses</HI> told us strange Stories of this River: amongst the rest, That if
you fling in nine Sticks, six would drive toward the South, and three toward
the North. We seem'd much to admire at the Report, but scarcely believ'd it,
till we made the Experiment our selves, by flinging so many Sticks into the
Water, which convinc'd us of the truth of what had been told us: But neither
the <HI>Tartars, Chineses,</HI> nor other Inhabitants, were able to give us any account
of this Wonderful Mystery of Nature. This I tried over against an Idol-Temple
call'd <HI>The Royal Serpent,</HI> concerning which the <HI>Chineses</HI> told us several
Wonders.</P>
<P>Upon the 19. of the same Month we came to a small City call'd <HI>Xantsui,</HI>
being the 23. under the Command of the Chief City <HI>Yengcheu.</HI> This Place
lies abont thirty Miles from <HI>Cining,</HI> on both sides of this <HI>Royal Channel,</HI> and is
guarded at each end with a strong Castle.</P>
<P>The City is four-square, well built, and surrounded with high Walls and
<FIGURE>
<PB N="94" REF="59"/>
</FIGURE>
strong Bulwarks. Here we saw the Ruines of several great Buildings uninha∣bited,
and which had been much defac'd by the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>The Country round about lies often under Water, by the overflowing of
the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> which sometimes rises to that heighth, that it drowns and
carries away whole Towns and Villages.</P>
<P>The next Morning we set Sail from <HI>Xantsui,</HI> and by the way we saw se∣veral
fair Villages and Corn-Fields on both sides of this <HI>Royal Channel,</HI> as also
several strong Sluces, which did not a little hinder us in our Passage; for be∣tween
<HI>Xantsui</HI> and <HI>Lincing</HI> we past through 58 Sluces.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Xantsui</HI> stands a famous Idol-Temple call'd <HI>Teywanmiao,</HI>
which is held in such great esteem amongst them, that they reckon it for one
of the chiefest in all <HI>China.</HI> It is built very high, with strong Walls of gray
Stone, and gallantly adorn'd after the <HI>Chinese</HI> fashion. The top of this Tem∣ple
is cover'd with Yellow glaz'd Tiles, and the Walls are also colour'd after
the same manner; so that when the Sun shines, it glisters like Gold all over.</P>
<P>Upon the twentieth of <HI>Iune</HI> we came to <HI>Tuncham,</HI> the third Chief City of
the Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> built in a foursquare form, and environ'd with
Walls and Bulwarks; the Streets thereof are large, and well-built. In the
middle of the City stands a high and curious Fabrick, with four brave Ar∣ches,
having strong Walls and Bulwarks, with several Gates leading into it.
On the North-side runs a broad Water, which encompasses the City; over
which is a Wooden Bridge of 137 Foot long, by which they pass into the
North part of the City. On the South-side are stately Suburbs, which, in
respect of the Inhabitants, and the greatness of their Trade, may very well
pass for another City: It is well built, with goodly Houses, and Idol-Tem∣ples.
Toward the East the Inhabitants shew'd us a very large Iron Tomb,
which they told us was erected at least 700 Years ago, for some Great Lord,
whose Memory the <HI>Chineses</HI> had in much Honour, having done his Country
some signal and remarkable Service, and for which he lost his Life in the
Wars.</P>
<P>Round about this City the Land is very low and flat, but wondrous fruit∣ful
in the product of all things necessary for Humane Sustenance. No part of
<HI>China</HI> produces so much Silk as this, the Inhabitants thereof living chiefly by
this Manufacture, wherewith they Trade into other Countries.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="59"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Here, the Inhabitants told us, is sometimes found a Stone in the Maw of
the Cows, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Nieuhoang,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Yellow of the
Cows.</HI> This Stone is about the bigness of a Goose Egg; outwardly it seems
to be of a soft chalkie substance, only of a yellowish Colour, and is by some
thought to be the <HI>Bezoar</HI> Stone. The <HI>Chinese</HI> Chyrurgeons highly commend
it, and use great diligence for the procuring of it; they write, That it is of
a cold temper, and very sovereign in fainting and swooning Fits.</P>
<P>In the Country of this Chief City, near to the eleventh small City call'd
<HI>Laotung,</HI> lies amongst the rest a Hill call'd <HI>Mingxe,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Stone of
Noise:</HI> Upon the top of this Hill, as the Inhabitants related to us, stands a
Column of 100 Rod high, which as soon as touch'd with the Finger, sounds
like a Drum, from which Noise the Hill derives its Name.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> also told us, That near to <HI>Quonching,</HI> the seventeenth small Ci∣ty
of this Chief City, is a Pool call'd <HI>Ho,</HI> wherein formerly the King of
<HI>Guei</HI> kept and fed his Cranes with great care and delight. The <HI>Chineses</HI> in this
Country as likewise through all <HI>China,</HI> feed this Bird in their Houses, as they
do also the Stags, which being Creatures of long life, they fancy to them∣selves,
that in having of them to breathe upon them, they shall likewise live
long.</P>
<P>We continu'd all Night in our Vessels before this City, and set Sail the
next Morning, and past over the Pool <HI>Nanyang,</HI> which abounds with Fish, and
that Night came to the City of <HI>Lincing,</HI> which lies about thirty Miles from
the City <HI>Tungchang,</HI> and is situated on both sides of the <HI>Royal Channel:</HI> We lay
at the end thereof, where that and the River <HI>Guei</HI> separate the Province of
<HI>Xantung</HI> from that of <HI>Peking,</HI> and mingle and unite their Waters.</P>
<P>We were no sooner arriv'd at this City, but the Governor appear'd upon
the Wall, near the Place where we lay with our Vessels, to welcom and re∣ceive
the Ambassadors with all manner of kindness. <HI>Pinxenton</HI> and the other
<HI>Mandorins</HI> went first ashore to him; whereupon the Governor sent for some
Chairs for the Ambassadors, who follow'd the <HI>Mandorins,</HI> and were most civil∣ly
receiv'd by him, intimating that he could not entertain them at his Court,
because they had not yet appear'd before the Emperor at <HI>Peking.</HI> The Am∣bassadors
sent some Presents to the Governor, who for the same Reason re∣fus'd
them.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="60"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Because this <HI>Lincing</HI> lies at the end of the <HI>Yellow Channel,</HI> near the River <HI>Guei,</HI>
and so consequently a very commodious Harbor for Shipping, all manner of
Goods and Wares are brought from all Parts of <HI>China</HI> to this City, for which
they must pay Custom there; and for this reason the Emperor has three
Commissioners resining in that Place to receive his Dues. This Navigation
occasions so great a Trade in <HI>Lincing,</HI> that it exceeds the other eighteen small
Cities which belong to the Chief City of <HI>Tunchang,</HI> in Number of People,
Plenty of all manner of Things, Gallantry of Buildings, and Greatness of
Commerce; neither gives she place to any Inferior City in the whole Em∣pire.
On both sides of the <HI>Royal Channel,</HI> near to the City, stand two strong
and large Castles, one against the other, which are no small Strength to the
Place, by which no Vessel whatsoever can pass without paying their Duties.
In this Channel are likewise, just before the City, two strong and heavy Slu∣ces,
to force back the upper Water which runs from the River <HI>Guei,</HI> and is
sometimes two or three Foot higher than the Inland Water. On the North
side of the City lies a Wooden Brige of nine Arches, over which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou may
pass conveniently from one part of the City to the other; in the middle
whereof is a Draw-Bridge, to let through such Vessels as have paid their
Custom.</P>
<P>The City is well-built, and is adorn'd with several stately Temples; it lies
in a flat sandy Soil, and is surrounded with an Earthen Wall, the top whereof
is cover'd with Stones; it is also very large, and well Peopled. We had
here great abundance of all manner of Fruit; amongst the rest, some well-relish'd
Pears, which keep a great while.</P>
<P>Without the Wall, on the North-side of the City, stands a most famous
Temple, with a high Tower, exceeding rare in the manner of Building:
You climb up to the top of this Tower by a Pair of Winding Stairs, which
are not built in the middle of the Tower, but between two Walls.</P>
<P>The fashion or form of this Tower consists of eight Corners, and nine
Rounds or Stories, each thirteen Foot and a half; so that the whole height
of the Tower is above 120 Foot, and according to the heighth a proportio∣nable
thickness. The outward Wall is made of the same Mould that the <HI>Chi∣na</HI>
Dishes are of, and full of Fret-work; the Walls within are polish'd Mar∣ble
of several Colours, and so smooth, that you may see your Face, as in a
<PB N="97" REF="60"/>
Mirrour. The Galleries or Rounds, which are nine, adorning the Structure,
are of Marble, cut in Figures or Images, and have hanging at their Corners
very fine Copper Bells, which when the Wind blows amongst them, make a
very pleasant jingling murmur. The Lights or Windows belonging to these
Galleries are full of gilded Bars, which when the Sun shines upon them, re∣turn
Beams as bright as they receive. Upon the top of the Tower stands a
Figure, signifying the Goddess of the Place to whom this Structure is Dedica∣ted.
This Image is made of Plaister-work thirty Foot high, and wrought
with Gold and Silver. Round about this Tower stand several great and small
Images, which are so curiously wrought, that they may be reckon'd amongst
the greatest Curiosities in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pinxenton</HI> left his Wife and Children in this City of <HI>Lincing,</HI> but he himself
continu'd the Voyage with us to <HI>Peking.</HI> Here also died one of our Trum∣peters,
nam'd <HI>Verman,</HI> who was buried in an Idol-Temple, with the consent of
the Magistrates, who seldom suffer any Strangers to be interr'd in their hal∣low'd
Ground.</P>
<P>Having got through the River <HI>Iun,</HI> we entred into the <HI>Guei,</HI> which divides
the Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> from <HI>Peking,</HI> whose Head springs on the West-side of
<HI>Gueihoei,</HI> the fourth Chief City of the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> running from thence
with many Meanders and Turnings toward the East, betwixt the Provinces
of <HI>Xantung</HI> and <HI>Peking,</HI> disemboguing into an Arm of the Sea, about ninety
Miles from this City.</P>
<P>We Sail'd Eastward up this River, and arriv'd upon the 25. at the City of
<HI>Utin,</HI> which is accounted the fourteenth small City of the great <HI>Tunchang,</HI>
thirty Miles from <HI>Lincing,</HI> situate upon the South-side of the River <HI>Guei,</HI> upon
the utmost Confines of the Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> and handsomly vested with
a four-square Wall. Upon the North-side of it are large Suburbs close built,
with stately Houses.</P>
<P>The great Edifices, and other eminent Ornaments of this City, were all
ruin'd by the conquering <HI>Tartar,</HI> and the Inhabitants most miserably abus'd,
a great many of them being put to the Sword, and others carried away
Captive, as those that were left related unto us with great reluctance. The
Situation seems delightful, being pleasantly varied with the prospect both of
Hills and Vallies, and luxurious in the product of all manner of Fruits. The
River <HI>Guei</HI> running close by this City, abounds with Fish, and serves to water
the Fields in a dry Season, to the great increase thereof.</P>
<P>I find my self again necessitated, before I proceed in my Relation, to describe
the Condition, Confines, and the Number of great and small Cities through
which we pass'd in this Province of <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Peking,</HI> which is reckon'd the first of the fifteen Provinces, exceeds all the
rest in Dignity, because of the Imperial City of <HI>Peking,</HI> where the Emperor
resides at present, and from whence it hath Denomination: for the <HI>Chinese</HI>
Emperors, especially those who Commanded since the <HI>Incarnation,</HI> setled their
Abodes in this City. The Race of <HI>Taming</HI> first transferr'd the Imperial Court
from <HI>Nanking</HI> to <HI>Peking,</HI> the better to oppose the Inroads of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> but
though the Imperial Residence was thus remov'd to <HI>Peking,</HI> yet to this day the
Court of the Emperor, and all Soveraignty and Magistracy, stands firm in
the same manner at <HI>Nanking</HI> as at <HI>Peking,</HI> though all the Royal Palaces were
totally destroy'd by the last Invasion.</P>
<P>The East of this Province is border'd by an Arm of the Sea, which divides
<PB N="98" REF="61"/>
the Islands <HI>Corea</HI> and <HI>Iapan;</HI> on the North-East lies the▪ Province of <HI>Leaotung;</HI>
toward the North, the great <HI>Tartarian</HI> Wall; and toward the West, the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Xangsi,</HI> where a long ridge of Hills, call'd <HI>Hengi,</HI> separates these Coun∣tries.
The <HI>Yellow River</HI> which runs through <HI>Xansi,</HI> parts this Province toward
the South from that of <HI>Honan,</HI> and toward the South-East of the River <HI>Guei,</HI>
unites this with the Province of <HI>Xantung.</HI></P>
<P>And though this Province of <HI>Peking</HI> lies in the Latitude but of 42 Degrees,
yet the Cold and Frost is so great and intense there, that oftentimes for four
Months together all the Rivers and Waters are frozen up in such a manner,
that they commonly ride their Horses on the Ice; all which time the Vessels
lie fast frozen in and Winter-bound. The Frost begins commonly in <HI>Novem∣ber,</HI>
and seldom is gone till <HI>March;</HI> twenty four Hours freezes up all, which
is not thaw'd in many Days.</P>
<P>The Country lies low, but is dry and healthful, though very barren in
comparison of the other Provinces, because of the great sandy Places and Wil∣dernesses;
but in respect the Court keeps there, and so draws great store of
People and Traffick, this natural Defect is much repair'd. This place produ∣ces
store of Corn, but little Rice, which the Courtiers and their Followers
devour.</P>
<P>In this Province are white rough Cats, not unlike the <HI>Malteeza</HI> Dogs, with
long Ears, which are there the Ladies Foisting-hounds or Play-fellows; they
will catch no Mice, being too much made of: There are other Cats that are
good Mousers, but they are very scarce, and had in great esteem.</P>
<P>They have here a convenient way of Travelling by Land, in a Waggon
with one Wheel, which only holds three Persons, one in the middle, and on
each side one.</P>
<P>Formerly this Province was divided into several Parts, and had particular
Names, as <HI>Ieu, Ki,</HI> and many more: It contains eight Capital Cities, each of
which Commands over several small ones, insomuch that one Capital City
alone, with the lesser under its Iurisdiction, is in effect a whole Province.
They reckon in this Province a hundred and thirty five Cities, great and small,
which are Wall'd and Fenc'd; for the number of the undefended are so great,
that the <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves take no notice of them in their Maps, neither are
they numbered by them.</P>
<P><HI>The eight great Cities are,</HI> Xuntien <HI>or</HI> Peking, Paoting, Hokien, Chinting, Xunte,
Quanping, Taming, <HI>and</HI> Iungping.</P>
<P><HI>Xuntien</HI> or <HI>Peking</HI> (the Imperial City, and where at present the <HI>Great Cham</HI>
keeps his Court) Commands over 26 Cities, and prescribes them their Laws,
as <HI>Xuntien, Xuny, Chanping, Leanghiang, Mieyun, Hoatjo, Kugan, Iungcing, Tungan,
Hiangho, Tung, Sanho, Vucing, Paoti, Cho, Fangxan, Pa, Vengan, Taching, Pooting,
Ki, Iatien, Fungjung, Cunhoa, Pingko,</HI> and <HI>Que.</HI> Amongst these, <HI>Tung, Cho, Pa,</HI> and
<HI>Ki,</HI> are the chiefest, and may be compar'd with Capital Cities for bigness and
magnificence.</P>
<P>Paoting <HI>Commands over 20 small Cities, as</HI> Paoting, Muonching, Ganso, Ting∣hing,
Sinching, Thang, Poye, Kingtu, Iungching, Huon, Ly, Hiung, Khi, Kince, Tun∣glo,
Gan, Caoyang, Singan, Ye, <HI>and</HI> Laixui.</P>
<P>Hokien <HI>Commands over 18 Cities, as</HI> Hokien, Hien, Neuching, Soning, Gnikien,
Kiacho, Cing, Hingci, Cinghai, Ningcin, King, Ukiao, Tungquang, Kuching, Cang,
Nanpi, Ienxan, <HI>and</HI> Kingyun; <HI>amongst which</HI> Cang <HI>is the chiefest.</HI></P>
<P>Chinting <HI>Commands over 32 Cities, as</HI> Chinting, Chinking, Hoclo, Lungxeu,
<PB N="99" REF="61"/>
Khoching, Loching, Vukie, Pingxan, Heuping, Ting, Snilo, Kioyang, Hintang, Ki,
Nancung, Sinho, Caokiang, Vuye, Cyn, Ganging, Iaoyang, Vukiang, Chao, Pohiang, Lung∣ping,
Caoye, Lincing, Ganboang, Ningcin, Xui, Hengxui, <HI>and</HI> Yuenxi; <HI>amongst these</HI>
Ting, Chao, <HI>and</HI> Xin, <HI>are the chiefest.</HI></P>
<P>Xunte <HI>Commands over nine Cities, as</HI> Xunte, Xabo, Nanbo, Pinghiang, Quang∣cung,
Kiulo, Thangxan, Ninkieu, <HI>and</HI> Gin.</P>
<P>Quanping <HI>Commands likewise over nine Cities, as</HI> Quanping, Kiocheu, Fihiang,
Kioe, Hantan, Quanpung, Chinggan, Guei, <HI>and</HI> Cingho.</P>
<P><HI>Taming</HI> Commands over eleven Cities, as <HI>Taming, Yaming, Nanlo, Guei, Cing∣fung,
Nuihoang, Siun, Hoa, Cai,</HI> (which is the chiefest of the eleven) <HI>Changyven,</HI>
and <HI>Tungming.</HI></P>
<P>Iungping <HI>Commands over six Cities, as</HI> Iungping, Ciengan, Vuning, Changly, Lo
<HI>and</HI> Lotung.</P>
<P>Besides these, there are three Cities more, as <HI>Yenping, Iunping,</HI> and <HI>Paogan,</HI>
which are situate upon very advantagious places, and were built to resist the
Forces of the <HI>Tartars</HI> when they should march beyond the Wall.</P>
<P>In this Province are fourteen Garrisons, which were chiefly contriv'd for
the defence of the Wall; the Names whereof are these, <HI>Siven, Vansiven, Hoai∣gan,
Caiping, Cungnuen, Chang, Gan, Cheching, Iuncheu, Vunin, Yu, Iungping, Xangas,</HI>
and <HI>Tiencin.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Register, wherein the number of the People of this Province is
set down, makes mention of Four hundred eighty thousand nine hundred
eighty nine Families, and Thirty four hundred fifty two thousand two hun∣ered
and fifty four Fighting Men.</P>
<P>The Revenue of this Province paid yearly to the Emperor, consists of Six
hundred thousand eleven hundred fifty three Sacks of Salt, Rice, and Corn,
Two hundred and twenty four Pounds of unwrought fine Flax, Forty five
thousand one hundred and thirty five Pounds of wrought Silk, Thirteen
thousand seven hundred and forty eight Pounds of Cotton, One hundred and
eighty thousand eight hundred and seventy Weight of Salt, Eighty seven hun∣dred
thirty seven thousand seven hundred and eighty four Trusses of Hay or
Straw; beside several other Taxes, which are paid in Money.</P>
<P>Upon the 26. of <HI>Iune</HI> we came to <HI>Kuching,</HI> the first Place we came at in this
Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> and the fourteenth small City under the Iurisdiction of
the third Chief City of <HI>Hokien</HI> in the Province of <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>This City, which we found situated upon the side of the River <HI>Guei,</HI> lies
about twenty three Miles from <HI>Vuching,</HI> in an even and flat Country, yet very
delightful in Prospect; her Walls are high, well built, and abounding in Peo∣ple
and Trade, her Suburbs very magnificent. We made no stay here, but
hastned on towards <HI>Peking;</HI> and by the way we saw on both sides of the Ri∣ver
<HI>Guei,</HI> whole Fields full of Trees upon with the Cotton-Wooll grows,
which occasions a mighty Trade in the adjacent Parts.</P>
<P>Upon the 28. we came to <HI>Tacheu,</HI> which some call <HI>Ukiao,</HI> accounted the
twelfth small City under the Command of the same <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kien,</HI> lying about
eighteen Miles from <HI>Kuching,</HI> situate on the side of the River, and surrounded
with a Wall of thirty Foot high, strengthned with Bulwarks and Watch-Towers,
well built, and adorn'd with several Temples, having also a large
Suburb, which reaches far upon both sides of the River.</P>
<P>In this City is the Staple of the Drink <HI>Zamsou,</HI> made of Rice, and drunk
in stead of Wine. The Inhabitants export this Liquor through all parts of
<PB N="100" REF="62"/>
<HI>China,</HI> which occasions a great Commerce in this Place; for both <HI>Tartars</HI> and
<HI>Chineses</HI> come with their Vessels far and near to be Fraighted with this Drink,
which they afterwards Transport to other Places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> told us, That about ten Miles from this <HI>Tacheu,</HI> near to the
second small City call'd <HI>Hien,</HI> was a Pool call'd <HI>Vo,</HI> whose Water turns as red
as Blood, if you fling a Stick into it; and that from the Leaves which fall
from those Trees which grow about this Lake, come forth immediately
living Swallows.</P>
<P>Upon the 28. of <HI>Iune</HI> we Sail'd by <HI>Tonquam</HI> with fair Wind and Weather:
It lies likewise upon the side of the River <HI>Guei,</HI> about a Musquet-shot from
the Stream, and is accounted the thirteenth small City under the Chief City
<HI>Hokien.</HI> This Place (a Privilege not granted to any other) hath a Guard on∣ly
of <HI>Chineses:</HI> built as the rest, square, and fenc'd with a thick and strong
Wall, encompass'd also with a deep and broad Moat or Trench. The Fields
near the Town are curiously planted with all manner of Fruit, Trees.</P>
<P>The adjacent Country of this, as also of the Chief City <HI>Hokien</HI> (within
which Iurisdiction this <HI>Tonquam</HI> is situate) lies flat, and much upon a Clay.
Toward the East lie large and flat Fields, being wash'd by the great <HI>Indian Sea,</HI>
from whence is continually fetch'd great store of Salt.</P>
<P>Upon the desire of <HI>Pinxenton,</HI> the Ambassadors sent me and some others of
their Followers, with twelve <HI>Tartar</HI> Soldiers, into the City, to see a Lion
made of Iron, which they reported to be extraordinary large and terrible,
standing in the middle of the Market-place: But the <HI>Chineses,</HI> when they saw
us coming, shut their Gates upon us, and hid themselves in their Houses, being
struck with terror for fear of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> so that we were necessitated to
return back to our Vessels, without entring into the City. <HI>Pinxenton</HI> and the
rest of the <HI>Chineses</HI> told us of several other strange things which were to be
seen in this City; but in respect of the unwillingness of the Inhabitants to
give us entrance, I saw none of them, and so could only take a view of the
outward Structure of the same, as it lay vested with large Walls.</P>
<P>Upon the second of <HI>Iuly</HI> we came to an Anchor before the City of <HI>Sanglo,</HI>
about fifty five Miles from <HI>Tonquam,</HI> upon the side of the River <HI>Guei.</HI> This
City lies a little distant from the River, and has very brave Suburbs on both
sides of the Banks, which are well built, and full of People and Trade.
Here dwells a great number of <HI>Tartars,</HI> and of a more considerable Quality
than any we found in our whole Voyage; who no sooner heard of our ar∣rival,
but they immediately came aboard in great State to bid us welcome.
Upon this their Friendly Reception and Entertainment we went ashore,
where on the East-side of the City we saw five old Triumphal Arches,
through which we past. The City is both handsomly Built, and well Peo∣pled,
being also environ'd with an old high Wall.</P>
<P>The Governor's Lady sent a Soldier to me, and some others of our Fol∣lowers,
desiring us to come to her: We were conducted into a very large
Parlor, where she, like a Goddess, was expecting our coming, attended by se∣veral
<HI>Tartar</HI> Ladies, in very rich Habit; but she exceeded them all for Beau∣ty
and Gallantry. On her left hand stood a stately <HI>Alchove,</HI> upon which she
caus'd me to sit down, and acquaint her with the Character of <HI>Holland,</HI> con∣cerning
which she ask'd me several Questions: To all which I return'd my
Answers with much freedom, wherewith she seem'd very well pleas'd.</P>
<P>Having satisfied her Curiosity, we had a noble Banquet set before us, and
<FIGURE>
<PB N="101" REF="62"/>
</FIGURE>
were treated with much civility; which being dispatch'd, we thank'd her for
the Honor she had done us, took our leaves, and return'd to our Lodgings.
As we were going out of doors, she desir'd us to excuse the meanness of the
Entertainment, by reason of her Husband's absence, who was gone for <HI>Pe∣king;</HI>
otherwise she told us she should have treated the Ambassadors for a
day or two, to refresh themselves after so long and tedious a Voyage. But
they understanding by the Interpreter, that her Husband was in great Credit
and Favor with the Emperor, sent her a Present of some small Rarities,
which she both civilly and thankfully receiv'd.</P>
<P>The same day we departed from <HI>Sanglo,</HI> and came in the Evening to the
Village of <HI>Tonnau,</HI> situated over against a strong Castle, guarded by a great
Garrison of <HI>Tartars.</HI> The Houses of this Place are built of Mud and Dirt,
fitter for Dog-kennels, than for People to inhabit in; yet fit enough for the
Inhabitants, who being of a sordid nature, and very loose and uncivil, de∣serve
no better. They live by pilfering and stealing from one another; and
none escapes plundering that passes that way without a Guard to defend
themselves from their violence.</P>
<P>Upon the third of <HI>Iuly</HI> we came to the small City of <HI>Sinkicien,</HI> which for
brevity some call <HI>Cing,</HI> the seventh small City under the Chief City <HI>Hokien,</HI>
lying also on the side of the River <HI>Guei,</HI> in a flat and pleasant Soil, and about
ten Miles from <HI>Sanglo.</HI></P>
<P>This Place is not very large, yet full of people and Trade, as most of the
Cities are which lie upon this River: Several famous Edifices which are
yet standing in and about this City, clearly evidence that this was formerly a
most stately and magnificent Place.</P>
<P>The Country round about lies low and flat, but very fruitful: It abounds
with store of tame Cattel, and Fish, in respect of the several Rivers which
run through it. There are very few Hills in all this Country of <HI>Hokien,</HI> to
which this <HI>Cing</HI> is subject; only there is one not far from this Place (though
the City it self lies upon a Flat) worthy the observation, call'd by the <HI>Chine∣ses,
Si.</HI> The top of this Hill, being a delightful Plain, which by reason
of the Fruitfulness they highly esteem, extends it self to a very great length,
upon which lies a small Village, inhabited onely by Cow-herds and Hus∣band-men.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="63"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The next day, being the fourth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> we Sail'd by the small City of <HI>Sin∣kocien,</HI>
the eighth small City under the Iurisdiction of the same Chief City,
and situated about eight Miles from <HI>Sinkicien.</HI> This is a small Place, but very
strong, having several Watch-Towers and Bulwarks for its defence: It is not
Populous, nor hath any great Trade, though adorn'd with some brave Buil∣ding;
but most of the Houses belonging to the Inhabitants are very mean
and little.</P>
<P>Within the Walls are several Temples, which are an exceeding Ornament
to the Place; but one, which stands without the Walls of the City, in an open
Field, exceeds all the rest for Bigness, Beauty, and Art. This Building in∣deed
is so rare a Piece, that we may well admire their wondrous Skill in
Architecture, which they boasted of formerly. The whole Fabrick consists of
three Rounds, the lower part whereof stands upon a Pedestal of Stone, into
which you ascend by Steps. The first is adorn'd with great Gates, and each
Corner supported with most curious Columns and Pillars: The second
Round has stately Windows, and large Pillars, like the first, by which the
Roof is also supported: The third is likewise beautified after the same man∣ner.
The whole Building on the out-side is adorn'd with Fret-work, and
at each Corner hang little Bells. The in-side of this Fane seems not so beauti∣ful
as the outward decorations of the Walls thereof, being onely hung with
great and small Images.</P>
<P>Through the whole Country, as well Temples as Dwelling-houses, pay
extraordinary great Taxes, which doth exceedingly lessen the Revenues of
the Priests.</P>
<P>It seems that the Idolaters here (so far as we could by the outward shew
judge of them) are nothing near so devout in the Worship of Images, as those
in other Parts; for in some Places we saw their Idols wholly deserted and
left quite naked, without any Ornaments upon them; others being only
cover'd with Mats, and having Straw Hats upon their Heads, so to defend
them from the injury of the Weather, and make them hold out and last the
longer.</P>
<P>Upon the same Day we pass'd by the small City of <HI>Singie,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ninth under
the Iurisdiction of the Chief City <HI>Hokien.</HI> This Place also lies by the River
side, twenty Miles from <HI>Sinko,</HI> enrich'd with noble Suburbs. On the West∣side
<FIGURE>
<PB N="103" REF="63"/>
</FIGURE>
of the City stands a great and high Temple, fenc'd in with a Wall, ha∣ving
also a very curious Garden or Orchard, most rarely Planted. We were
very desirous to have seen this Curiosity; but the Interpreter told us, that
i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could not by any means be permitted, it being a Cloyster for <HI>Nuns,</HI> into
which no Men were admitted. On the other side of the City stands another
stately Fane, besides three curious Obelisks or Pyramids, which were erected
by the City, in Honor of a great Commander, who lay Interr'd there, for his
faithful Services done to his Country.</P>
<P>Toward Night setting Sail, we saw a strange Uprore among the People,
who were all up in Arms, and had divided themselves into several Troops, to
defend their Country against the Grashoppers (which occasion oftentimes
a very great Dearth and Scarcity.) These Creatures come once a year (about
that time when we were there) with an Easterly Wind, in such mighty
Swarms or Squadrons, that they devour all they meet with, and that in a few
hours, leaving the Fields utterly dismantled. To prevent these Invaders, and
sweep-clean Plunderers, the Inhabitants march to and again through the Fields
with their Colours and Ensigns flying, shouting and hollowing all the way
they go; by which means these Destroyers are kept from fixing and doing
such execution upon their Grain. And thus the Peasants continually en∣deavor
to preserve their Labor and Product, who otherwise would certainly
lose the whole benefit of their Harvest for that Year. They never leave them
when they see a Party coming, till they have driven them into the Sea, or
some River, where they fall down and are drown'd; and so it hapned, that
they drove a flying Regiment so long, till they fell down upon our Heads,
and our Vessels were cover'd with them, which we afterwards flung into the
River.</P>
<P>The same Day we arriv'd at the Sea-Port of <HI>Tiencienwey,</HI> accounted for the
most famous Sea-Town of all <HI>China,</HI> their chiefest Harbors being three; the
first is the Chief City of <HI>Canton</HI> or <HI>Quancheu,</HI> situate in the Province of <HI>Quantung;</HI>
the second <HI>Iejencien,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Nanking;</HI> and the third <HI>Tiencienwey,</HI>
situate upon the utmost Confine toward the East of this Province of <HI>Peking,</HI>
near to an Arm of the Sea <HI>Cang,</HI> in a corner where three Rivers of this Pro∣vince
meet, and upon which stands a strong Fortress. The Country round
about is very low and Marshy.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="64"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Tiencienwey</HI> it self lies thirty Miles from <HI>Singlo,</HI> built also with
strong Walls twenty five Foot high, full of Watch-Towers and Bulwarks,
and the Place much set forth with Temples, very populous, and so full of
Trade, that hardly the like Commerce is to be found in any other City in all
<HI>China;</HI> for whatsoever Vessels are bound for <HI>Peking</HI> from any other part of
<HI>China,</HI> must touch here, which occasions an extraordinary Traffick to Ship∣ping
which lie continually before this City. Here is also the Staple of all
Commodities, this being a free Port, and no Custom paid for any Goods Ex∣ported
or Imported.</P>
<P>The Castle, which stands upon the Point of three Rivers, hath very high
Walls and Towers, much for the defence of the City and adjacent Coun∣try.
We lay all Night close to the Wall in our Vessels, to be in a readiness to
pursue our Voyage in the Morning.</P>
<P>The Governor and Magistrates of the City came Aboard to welcom us,
and receive the Ambassadors: but <HI>Pinxenton,</HI> to shew that he was likewise to
be honor'd so order'd the matter, that they made him their first Salutes. And
because the <HI>Mandorin</HI> of the old <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roy was order'd to hasten over
Land for <HI>Peking,</HI> to signifie to the Emperor the coming of the Ambassadors,
they gave <HI>Pinxenton</HI> Entertainment in a magnificent Idol-Temple, to which
the rest of the Company was invited; And this was done only to this end, to
Confer together after what manner they were to manage the Business upon
our arrival at <HI>Peking.</HI> The Ambassadors having throughly instructed this <HI>Man∣dorin</HI>
how he should make the Grandees of the Court to be of our Party, and
by what means he should endeavor to procure for us a free Trade in <HI>China,</HI> he
took his leave, and departed late in the Night for <HI>Peking;</HI> we made what haste
we could after him with our Vessels, and upon the 11. we came to <HI>Ioeswoe,</HI> the
eighth small City under the Imperial City of <HI>Peking,</HI> and lies about forty Miles
from <HI>Tiencin.</HI></P>
<P>This small City is well built, and full of Trade, and hath a wealthy Sub∣urb
belonging to it. All Ships or Vessels which pass this way, pay Custom
here, which brings a great Revenue to the Crown, and also store of Trade;
and for that end the Emperor has his Officers residing here, to receive the
Toll of all such Vessels. There are several Temples and other curious Edifi∣ces,
which are magnificent Ornaments to the Place.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="64"/>
We have added to each Province of the fifteen, what Revenue each pays
yearly to the Emperor, without the Incomes of the Custom-houses, where
they pay for all Wares and Vessels. These Excise-places are very numerous
through all <HI>China;</HI> but what each may bring in yearly, I could not well disco∣ver,
neither was it easie, because the Emperor appoints his own Officers, from
whom he receives their Accounts. The Ambassadors were receiv'd here by
the Governor of the City with great Civility, and Entertain'd at his House in
much State: which to requite in some measure, they sent him some Presents,
which he civilly refus'd, in regard they had not yet seen the Emperor; but
some Glasses of Rose-water were afterwards at his Request sent unto him,
which he accepted.</P>
<P>The next Day, being the 12. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> we past by <HI>Focheu,</HI> which is also call'd
by some <HI>Que,</HI> and reckon'd for the twenty sixth small City under the Chief
City of <HI>Peking:</HI> It lies on the side of the River, about fifteen Miles from
<HI>Ioeswoe,</HI> in a very pleasant Soil. This Place is not very large, but well built,
and full of brave Edifices, being surrounded with a high Wall, and strength∣ned
with Watch-Towers and Bulwarks.</P>
<P>On the East: side of the City without the Walls, stands a very fine Temple,
with a Tower of nine Rounds high, very curiously built. There are likewise
in this Place several Triumphal Arches, much adorning the same.</P>
<P>Upon the 16. of <HI>Iuly</HI> we came to <HI>Sancianwey</HI> or <HI>Sanho,</HI> about twelve Miles
from <HI>Focheu,</HI> and four from <HI>Peking.</HI> This is the twelfth small City under the
Imperial City <HI>Peking,</HI> and stands upon the side of the River: It is very popu∣lous,
and well fortifi'd, having a strong Castle for Defence. In the middle of
the City stands a Triumphal Arch, very artificially built, of gray Stone: The
South-side hath a broad Stone Bridge, which rests upon five Arches, and is
forty two Paces long, with Houses on each side.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Sancianwey,</HI> and the following <HI>Tongsiou,</HI> are within four Miles
of <HI>Peking,</HI> and so to the Imperial City you make no nearer approach by Wa∣ter;
for commonly all Goods thither design'd, are unladed either at <HI>Sancian∣wey</HI>
or <HI>Tongsiou,</HI> and so carried by Land in Wagons, or upon Mules and Asses,
which are always to be had, and stand there ready. This way of carrying
Goods by Land to <HI>Peking</HI> maintains a great many poor People, who have no
other manner of Livelihood but carrying Burthens, which they trudge under
at a very reasonable Rate.</P>
<P>To this City came the <HI>Mandorin</HI> back, whom the Ambassadors had sent out
before to <HI>Peking:</HI> The next Day came likewise twenty four Horses, with se∣veral
Wagons and Carts, which the Council sent to fetch the Emperors Pre∣sents
and our Carriage. All things being ready, the Ambassadors began their
Iourney by Land to <HI>Peking,</HI> after this following order: Two Trumpeters
rid at a distance before; then follow'd the Standard-bearer, with the Prince
of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Blazonry; next to him the Ambassador's, accompanied with seve∣ral
<HI>Tartar</HI> Lords and Gentlemen well Mounted; the Captains and Soldiers,
who had thus far conducted the Ambassadors, and were about fifty in num∣ber,
came after in good order with the Emperors Presents, and the Ambassa∣dors
Goods. The Road to <HI>Peking</HI> was so full of People, Horses and Wagons,
as if an Army had been upon the March. The Ways are exceeding bad be∣tween
this Place and the City, being very deep and uneven, so that the Horses
are up to the Belly almost every step.</P>
<P>The next Day, being the 17. we rode through <HI>Tongsiou,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Tung,</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="65"/>
and reckon'd for the eleventh small City under the same Iurisdiction, situate
in a very low and deep Soil, upon the side of the High-way which leads to
<HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Tongsiou</HI> is very large, and Fenc'd with strong Walls, having likewise a
Wall dividing it in the middle. Here are no Streets, but several brave Build∣ings
and curious Temples. The Country is very pleasant, full of Corn-Fields
and Fruit-Trees. Near to the Road stands a Temple, where the Ambassadors
refresh'd themselves, and then continu'd their Iourney in the fore-mention'd
order, the Way being throng'd with People on each side of us. In the After∣noon
we came to the Suburbs of the Imperial City of <HI>Peking,</HI> accounted the
first Chief City of this Province, and is distant from <HI>Canton</HI> 1530 Miles. We
pass'd through two magnificent Gates into the City, and lighted at a very fa∣mous
Temple, into which the Ambassadors were invited, the conducted to
repose a while, and to expect their Carriages which were behind. The Am∣bassadors
were no sooner entred, but they were presently welcom'd, and Sa∣luted
by the Emperor's <HI>Capado,</HI> who carried a Falcon upon his Hand, and also
by the Agents of the <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roys, who reside here, and by several Gran∣dees
of the Court. After they had a little refresh'd themselves with Meat and
Drink, and several sorts of Fruit, and their Carriages had been visited by the
<HI>Capado,</HI> and the Wagons and Carts told, they were conducted from thence in
great State to their Lodgings, provided for them by the Emperor. This House
was not far from the Palace, and had a high Wall about it, with three stately
and broad Gates, between each of which were very large Courts.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors immediately caus'd the Emperor's Presents, and all their
own Goods, to be brought into their Lodgings, where they found all things
in good condition, without the least loss or damage. At Night came two
<HI>Tartar</HI> Commanders, with twelve Soldiers, by the Emperor's Order, to guard
the Gates of their Lodgings, and take care that the Command of his Imperial
Majesty might be duly observ'd, and the Ambassadors supplied with all things
convenient.</P>
<P>The next Day, early in the Morning, appear'd the <HI>Mandorin Pinxenton,</HI>
with two other Commanders, who were likewise come thither from <HI>Canton,</HI>
as also the two Agents of the <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roys, who had their Residence in
this Court. Not long after came some Lords of the Imperial Council, at∣tended
with the Chief Secretary <HI>Thouglovia,</HI> who was a <HI>Chinese</HI> by Birth, and a
very civil Person, having likewise in their Company two other <HI>Mandorins,</HI>
call'd <HI>Quanlovia</HI> and <HI>Hoolovia,</HI> the last whereof was Secretary to the Council,
though a Stranger to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language. After they had pass'd some Com∣plements
to one another, they acquainted the Ambassadors, that they were
come to bid them welcom in the Name of the Emperor and his Council, and
to enquire after their Healths, and the number of their Followers, the quality
and quantity of their Presents; and lastly, concerning the Person and Place
from whom and from whence the same were properly sent? Whereupon the
Ambassadors deliver'd a List to the <HI>Mandorins,</HI> consisting of twenty four Per∣sons,
who all of them belong'd to the Embassy; wherewith they were sa∣tisfi'd.</P>
<P>Next they narrowly examin'd the Catalogue of the Presents, curiously
questioning the Quality of each, from whence they came, after what man∣ner
they were made, to what use, and in what part of the World; as likewise
how many Months Voyage it was from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>Peking?</HI> The Ambassadors
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="65"/>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="66"/>
<PB N="107" REF="66"/>
having fully satisfied the Curiosity of these Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, they began highly to
extol the Presents which the Ambassadors had brought with them, saying,
That the like being brought thither the last Year by the <HI>Liquesen,</HI> were whol∣ly
spoil'd upon the Way, and so were sent back again without being seen by
his Imperial Majesty. They enquir'd likewise whether the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were
bred and born upon the Sea? if they had any Country? how and where si∣tuated?
from whom, and why they were sent? what Name and Age their
King was of? To which Questions the Ambassadors return'd for answer,
That they were a People bred and born upon the Land, and had a Country
commonly call'd by the Name of <HI>Holland,</HI> which had been possess'd by them
for above a hundred Years; and that they were no ways given to Plundering
or Stealing, as some disaffected Persons had reported of them. The <HI>Manda∣rins</HI>
were further inquisitive to know of them in what Part of the World
their Country lay? how far from <HI>Peking?</HI> and whether there was any travel∣ling
thither by Land? if so, through what Regions they must pass? To all
which the Ambassadors gave them such Answers as they saw requisite. But
in respect they seem'd not therewith fully satisfied, and could not be per∣swaded
to believe that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had any firm Country, but liv'd and
dwelt upon the Sea, or at least in Islands; therefore, for a more clear de∣monstration,
they desir'd to see a Map of our Country: Whereupon the
Ambassadors produc'd a Map of the <HI>Seven United Provinces,</HI> with the Territo∣ries
thereunto belonging, which they took with them to shew the Emperor.
They ask'd likewise after the Government of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the Power of those
that had sent them? to which the Ambassadors return'd for Answer, That
<HI>Holland</HI> was never Govern'd by any one single Person, but by a select number
of the chiefest of the Country. They specifi'd also the Names of the Coun∣cils
by which <HI>Holland</HI> was Govern'd, and said, That besides this high Coun∣cil,
there was yet another, which had receiv'd their Power and Authority from
the Supreme Council, and the Prince of their Country, to Govern the <HI>Indian</HI>
Affairs; and that the Ambassadors, upon their Order given to the Governor-General
of <HI>Batavia,</HI> were expresly sent to congratulate the Emperor of <HI>Tartary,</HI>
unto his Vice-Roys in <HI>China,</HI> and to wish him a long and happy Reign.</P>
<P>But in regard these Commissioners could not well understand nor appre∣hend
this Form of our Government (because the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> know no
other than Monarchical) neither could they tell what the Name of <HI>Prince</HI>
signified, the Ambassadors had no little trouble to work them into a good
Opinion of our State: therefore they were forc'd to make use of the Name
of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as if they had been sent by his Highness; concern∣ing
whom they ask'd several Questions, and among the rest, Whether the Am∣bassadors
were ally'd to their Prince? for they have a Custom, That no Fo∣reign
Ambassadors are to bow their He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds before the Emperor's Throne, un∣less
they be such as are a Kin to him that sent them, as the Ambassadors of <HI>Corea</HI>
and the <HI>Liquese</HI> Islands, who came hither the last Year, were the Brothers and
Kindred of those Kings that sent them, without which they would have no
great Credit and Reputation with the Emperor: To which the Ambassadors
reply'd, That they were not in the least ally'd to their Prince; for besides
that the Governors of their Country knew nothing of this Custom, so like∣wise
such Persons as were related to their Prince, were employ'd at home in
the most considerable Charges. But these Gentlemen were of opinion, That
the Dignity and Majesty of the Emperor would be much lessen'd, if he should
<PB N="108" REF="67"/>
give Audience to such as were not so related to their Prince. They then ask'd
the Ambassadors, What Offices do you bear in the Court of your Prince?
How runs your Title in your own Language? How many Men have you un∣der
your Command? And how do you live? To all which Questions the
Ambassadors return'd particular Answers.</P>
<P>They ask'd likewise, Whether all the Presents they had brought with them
came directly out of <HI>Holland?</HI> Whereupon the Ambassadors told them, That
some of those Goods came out of <HI>Holland,</HI> as the Cloths, Looking-glasses;
Corral, Perspective-glasses, all manner of Arms, and the Furniture for Hor∣ses;
but the rest were added by the Governor-General of <HI>Batavia,</HI> by Order
of the Council for the <HI>Indian</HI> Government in <HI>Holland.</HI> Hereupon arose ano∣ther
Question, namely, What manner of Place <HI>Batavia</HI> was, and what man∣ner
of Man the Governor? The Ambassadors reply'd to this, That the Go∣vernor-General,
in regard of his Command, might be compar'd with the
Vice-Roys of <HI>Canton:</HI> And in regard the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were not subject to any
King, nor their Country a Kingdom, therefore he could not have the Title of
<HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> but only be call'd by the Name of <HI>Governor-General,</HI> as one that had
the Command over other Places and Countries. And as for <HI>Batavia,</HI> that
(they said) was a Place which for its conveniency was appointed for a Ren∣dezvouz
for all Ships which should come out of <HI>Holland</HI> and other Parts; and
consequently held for the Chief City of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassadors having satisfied the Curiosity of these Persons, in giving
such a full Answer to all their Demands, they took leave, and presented to
each of the Ambassadors fifty <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver. But not long after, these Gen∣tlemen,
one after another, came again to ask after some Particulars. The first
came by Order of his Imperial Majesty and his Council, to fetch the Creden∣tials,
which were carried to him in great State, being put into a large Silver
Dish, cover'd with three Pieces of Scarlet. Another came to see our Arms,
about which they were very inquisitive to know how and where they were
made. The third ask'd what manner of Arms the <HI>Hollanders</HI> us'd in their Wars,
and against whom they had warr'd. He ask'd likewise particularly, Whether
we had War or Peace with the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and with those of <HI>Maceao?</HI> and
whose Country lay nearest to <HI>China?</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassadors having fully answer'd all these Questions, they depart∣ed,
but return'd at least six or seven times, and ask'd, among the rest, after
the Quality of the Ambassadors: At last they ask'd Pardon for the trouble
they had given them, saying, That they had done it by the Emperor's Order,
who was always very inquisitive in things of this nature.</P>
<P>After the Chief Governor of this Imperial City had been made acquaint∣ed
with the Report of the Commissioners, he sent the next day two Gentle∣men
to the Ambassadors, with expr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Order that they should appear with
the Presents before his Majesties Council; but it proving a very rainy day,
the Ambassadors, left the Presents might be spoil'd, desir'd to be excus'd from
coming till another time: yet it would not be granted, notwithstanding all
their Endeavors: For though the Ambassadors went to Court without the
Presents, they were not admitted till such time as they had brought them;
for the Emperor was resolv'd to see them that day. As soon as the Presents
were come, they were admitted, and order'd to sit down, without shewing
any manner of Respect to that great Assembly. The Chief Commander
sate at the upper end of this Assembly, upon a broad low Bench, with his
<PB N="109" REF="67"/>
Legs across, like our Taylors in <HI>Europe:</HI> Next him, on his Right-hand, sate
two <HI>Tartar</HI> Lords; and on the left hand a <HI>Iesuit,</HI> Father <HI>Adam Schaliger,</HI> a Cour∣tier
in <HI>Peking</HI> almost fifty Years, living in great Honor and Repute; he was,
as he told us, born at <HI>Cullen,</HI> and went shav'd and cloth'd after the <HI>Tartar</HI> Fa∣shion;
a very comely old Man, with a long Beard. All the Lords who were
at this Assembly sate one among another, without any Splendor, Order, or
State; the Benches were onely cover'd with an old white Linnen Cloth, upon
which sate likewise his Highness himself, with his Legs naked, and a little
slight Mantle about his Body.</P>
<P>No sooner had the <HI>Providore</HI> made a short Harangue to the Ambassadors,
and had order'd them to sit, but Father <HI>Adam</HI> the <HI>Iesuit</HI> came likewise to sa∣lute
them, which he perform'd with great civility in his own Language, ask∣ing
them (amongst other things) after several <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> whom we
knew to have liv'd at <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> a sign that he had formerly been conversant
in those Parts.</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Canton Mandorins,</HI> and <HI>Pinxenton</HI> himself (who had car∣ried
it so high upon the Voyage) were as busie as Porters, to help away the
Chests and Cases in which the Emperor's Presents lay.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rix-Providore</HI> himself took the Presents out, and ask'd particularly
from whence they came, how they were made, for what use, and where they
were bought? as also, how many days Voyage between <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Peking?</HI>
Father <HI>Adam</HI> was his Interpreter, and affirm'd the Answers which the Ambas∣sadors
made to the several Questions, to be real and true. As often as the
<HI>Rix-Providore</HI> took out any thing that was very rare, Father <HI>Adam</HI> fetch'd a
deep sigh. The <HI>Rix-Providore</HI> ask'd also, among the rest, after the Value of
the <HI>Alcatives;</HI> and receiving for answer, That they were worth above 200
<HI>Ryals,</HI> he said, That they were both brave and large, and would be very ac∣ceptable
to his Imperial Majesty: He also commended the Saddles, Arms,
Corral, and the like.</P>
<P>Mean time came an Order to the Council from his Imperial Majesty, That
Father
<HI>Adam</HI> should ask the Ambassadors that Night several Questions, and
set down their Answers in writing for his Majesties satisfaction; which were
to this effect: Whether the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had any Country or no? where situa∣ted?
and how far from <HI>China?</HI> how their Prince was call'd? and what Form
of Government they had among them? The <HI>Iesuit</HI> therefore ask'd the Ambas∣sadors,
at the Command of the <HI>Rix-Chancellor,</HI> Whether the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>
was yet in being? and whether their High and Mighty Lordships did still
Govern the State of the <HI>United Provinces?</HI> To all which they return'd him such
Answers as very well satisfied the Chancellor. The <HI>Iesuit</HI> having taken in
writing the Answers of the Ambassadors, carried them to his Highness, who
caus'd him to blot out some Passages which he suppos'd might give offence to
the Emperor; for he had added of his own, <HI>That the Country which the</HI> Hol∣landers
<HI>did now possess, did formerly, and does by right belong unto the</HI> Spaniards:
Which Words he made to be put out, telling him, <HI>It is enough that you
know that these People are possess'd of a Country, and have a Form of Government
among them.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst the Clerks were taking several Copies of the Writing which the
<HI>Iesuit</HI> had brought into the Assembly, his Highness found himself hungry, and
sent for a piece of Pork to satisfie his Appetite, which was half raw, whereof
he did eat most heartily in so slovenly a manner, that he look'd more like a
<PB N="110" REF="68"/>
Butcher than a Prince. No sooner had he stay'd his Stomach with this Col∣lation,
but he order'd the Son of the old <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roy, who had his Resi∣dence
in this Court, to provide an Entertainment for the Ambassadors; which
was accordingly perform'd, in some better order and fashion than the former.
When Dinner was brought up, his Highness and the rest of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Lords
fell on again as greedily as if they had eat nothing all that Day; but neither
the Ambassadors nor Father <HI>Adam</HI> could eat of their Cookery, most of the
Meat being raw; which his Highness perceiving, caus'd the Dishes to be ta∣ken
off, and a Banquet of Fruit and Sweet-meats to be set upon the Table, ear∣nestly
urging the Ambassadors to send home to their Lodgings what was left,
which they civilly refus'd.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Adam</HI> inform'd the Ambassadors, that about four Months since there
came an Ambassador from <HI>Muscovy</HI> with a Train of a hundred Men, to desire
leave to come once a Year into <HI>China</HI> to Trade with the Subjects thereof; but
as yet had not prevail'd with the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> who seem'd very unwilling to
agree to any such thing. Night coming on, the Ambassadors took leave of
the Assembly, and return'd to their Lodgings, conducted by the <HI>Iesuit</HI> in great
State, who was carried by four Men in a <HI>Palakin</HI> or Sedan, attended by several
considerable Persons on Horseback.</P>
<P>The next Day came the first Secretary <HI>Thouglouja,</HI> with the two other
<HI>Tartar</HI> Mandorins, <HI>Qualouja</HI> and <HI>Hoolouja,</HI> to the Ambassadors, in the Name of
his Highness, to direct the Presents in writing to whom they particularly be∣long'd.
Afterwards they return'd immediately with Order, that the Secretary
of the Ambassadors should appear with the Presents before his Highness and
some of the Council, to make a farther Declaration upon the same: Where∣upon
Secretary <HI>Baron</HI> went with them, and having answer'd their Desires,
the <HI>Mandorins</HI> came back to the Ambassadors Lodgings, with the Agents of the
<HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roys, to acquaint them that the Presents were very acceptable to
his Majesty, his Mother, and his Empress; and that his Imperial Majesty had
order'd them to enquire whether there were not fifty Pieces more to be had
of the white Linen, because the Emperor, being much taken therewith, had a
Design to Present the same to the Wives of the Sons of the <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roys.
At his Request they made a shift to furnish him with thirty six Pieces, where∣with
the <HI>Tarnars</HI> were satisfi'd, and departed.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Commissioners came several times to visit the Ambassadors,
and to inform themselves further about the Character of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the Ex∣tent
of that Country.</P>
<P>Upon the third of <HI>August</HI> we understood, that an Ambassador from the
<HI>Great Mogol</HI> was likewise arriv'd at <HI>Peking</HI> with a great Train of Attendants, to
accommodate and determine the Difference lately risen between these two
People; and also to desire that their Priests might Preach freely, and with∣out
any molestation in <HI>China,</HI> which had for some time been forbidden upon
high Penalties.</P>
<P>The Presents (without which never any Forein Ambassador appears in this
Court) which he brought with him for the Emperor, the better to effect that
which he came about, consisted of Three hundred and thirty six very brave
Horses, two Ostriches, a Diamond of an extraordinary bigness, and several
other Precious Stones. All these Presents were no less acceptable to the Em∣peror,
than what we brought him; so that the <HI>Mogol</HI> had quick dispatch of
his Business.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="68"/>
The Ambassadors being visited by some <HI>Tartar</HI> Lords, together with the
Mandorin <HI>Pinxenton</HI> and others, who had conducted them from <HI>Canton</HI> to <HI>Pe∣king,</HI>
thought good to shew them the Credentials which they had brought
to the Emperor and to the Vice-Roys of <HI>Canton,</HI> which they had deliver'd upon
their arrival both at <HI>Canton</HI> and in <HI>Peking;</HI> and after they had opened the same,
the <HI>Tartars</HI> ask'd what the meaning of the word <HI>Iuly</HI> was; whereupon answer
was made, That it was the Name of the seventh Month, according to their
Account, or the last Month of the Year, according to that of the <HI>Tartar.</HI> They
ask'd moreover, whether the <HI>Netherland</HI> Government had lasted 1655 Years?
and if it began at that time? The Ambassadors made answer, That <HI>Holland</HI>
from that time to this had been always Inhabited and Govern'd by one and
the same People, and that the number of those Years only put them in mind
of the Birth of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> born at that time. Hereupon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> departed, ta∣king
the Credentials with them, without speaking one word.</P>
<P>The Emperor being throughly inform'd concerning of the Affairs of the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> sent upon the 31. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> a Mandatory Letter to the Lords of his
Council, wherein he declar'd, That his Imperial Majesty did admit of the
Ambassadors as such, and would give them Audience, as soon as he could sit
in his new Court upon his Throne. And after his Majesty had caus'd the
Credentials of the Ambassadors to be once more Translated by <HI>Schaliger</HI> the
<HI>Iesuit,</HI> and read unto him by some of his chiefest Councellors, he seem'd so
well pleas'd therewith, that he sent a second Summons to his Council, to be as∣sisting
and serviceable to the Ambassadors during their abode in his Empire.
The first of these Letters or Orders is as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Great and Worthy <HI>Lypeos,</HI> (Counsellors,)</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassadors are come hither with their Presents to Congratulate the
Emperor, and to shew their Obedience unto him, which was never done to this
Crown before: And because this is the first time, I think fit to accept of them as Am∣bassadors,
and have promis'd them, that they, whensoever I shall be seated upon my
Throne in my New Palace, shall be brought before me, to do their Obeisance, that so they
may be well receiv'd, and upon their Request obtain a favourable Answer, in order to their
Return; the more, because they being come from a far and remote Country, both by Sea
and Land, will be able to spread the Fame and Renown of my Person and Empire: There∣fore
we think fit not to deny or refuse any thing to such Foreign People, who are come
such a long Voyage, from the furthermost part of the World, which in reason they can
desire of us.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The second Letter was almost <HI>verbatim</HI> as the former, to quicken his Mi∣nisters
of State, to dispatch them with a satisfactory Answer to their Pro∣posals.</P>
<P>The Chancellor hereupon desir'd to know of the Ambassadors, whether the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> could not send every Year to <HI>Peking,</HI> or at least every second or
third Year, to do Obedience to the Emperor? To this they answer'd, That
for the more certainty they could better make Addresses every fifth Year at
<HI>Peking,</HI> desiring in the mean time that they might come annually with four
Ships to <HI>Canton,</HI> to Trade there. Afterwards the Chancellor summon'd the
<HI>Tartar</HI> and <HI>China</HI> Councils together, to consider of the Proposals of the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI>
alledging (he being President) that they ought to give them leave eve∣ry
fifth Year to come and Salute the Emperor. Most of the <HI>Tartars</HI> were of
<PB N="112" REF="69"/>
this Opinion; but the <HI>Chineses</HI> seem'd outwardly willing to shew far greater
favour to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> namely, That they should come but once every nine
Years to <HI>Peking,</HI> by reason of the vast distance from <HI>Batavia</HI> to the Imperial
City: But herein they thought to have out-witted the <HI>Tartars;</HI> for they un∣derstood
that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were not to be permitted in the mean time to
Trade at <HI>Canton.</HI> They proposed also to the Assembly, Whether under the
notion of <HI>Hollanders</HI> the <HI>English</HI> might not likewise appear, who about thirty
Years since came with four Ships into the Harbor of <HI>Heytamon,</HI> where they
took away four Vessels laden with Salt, the <HI>Mandorin</HI> Prisoner, and shot down
a Fort, committing several other Violences, for which, from that time they
were held and declar'd Enemies of the Empire? therefore they should be sa∣tisfi'd
of the Integrity of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> before they were permitted to Trade
in <HI>China:</HI> for b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>de that it was contrary to the Custom of the Countrey to let
them have a free Trade in any part of the Empire, it did not appear by their
Credentials that any such thing was desir'd; so that they concluded they had
exceeded their Orders.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors were not a little surpriz'd at these Proceedings of the
Council; for they understood no otherwise, but that the Emperor had, ac∣cording
to the Contents of the second Mandatory Letter, formerly procur'd
by the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton,</HI> fully agreed to the Request of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> con∣cerning
a free Trade in <HI>Canton;</HI> and that they were only thereupon to go and
return their Thanks to his Majesty at <HI>Peking.</HI> The Ambassadors were well
enough inform'd of the Designs and Practises of Father <HI>Adam</HI> and some other
<HI>Iesuits,</HI> who had lived there for some Years, and had been Brib'd under-hand
by the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> to oppose the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in this their Design of free Com∣merce
in <HI>China;</HI> therefore they endeavor'd to perswade the <HI>Tartars,</HI> That the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> under colour and pretence of Merchandizing, design'd nothing less
than to get footing in their Country, and then to make use of all opportuni∣ties
to Plunder, and carry away whatsoever was portable. The Ambassadors
were also inform'd, that these <HI>Iesuits</HI> had likewise perswaded the Council,
That <HI>Maccao</HI> would be utterly ruin'd and impoverish'd by such a Trade; and
withal, that they had told the <HI>Tartars,</HI> to make them the more averse to the
<HI>Hollanders;</HI> That they were a People made up of several Nations, without any
Habitations, and only subsisted upon what they got by Pyracy at Sea.</P>
<P>But that which most of all surpriz'd the Ambassadors, was to find them∣selves
deceiv'd of their Money by the <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roys, unto whom they had
paid thirty five hundred <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver; which Sum the Vice-Roys promis'd
to pay the Chancellor and some others of his Majesties Council, to procure
their Favor and Assistance for a dispatch of their Business. Now perceiving
that they were Trepann'd by the Vice-Roys, they were forc'd to consider of
some other way to obtain their Purpose; wherefore they first thought good
to propose to the Council the Point of coming to Trade yearly at <HI>Canton,</HI> and
to endeavor to effect the same. Afterwards the Ambassadors sent the <HI>Mando∣rin</HI>
of the old <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roy to the Prime Chancellor, to enctreat him to
stay so long in <HI>Peking,</HI> till his Majesty should be fully assur'd that they were
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> and no others. They likewise desir'd of the Emperor and the
Council, That they would favor them with some Token or Emblem cut in
Brass, to Seal therewith all the Passports of their Shipping, which should di∣stinguish
them from any other Nation, and impower them either to pass by,
or come to an Anchor upon their Coast. At last they propos'd to the Council,
<PB N="113" REF="69"/>
That they would be pleas'd to admit of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to Live, Converse, and
Trade in <HI>China</HI> as their own Subjects, paying the usual Duties and Impo∣sitions,
as had been formerly granted to those of <HI>Lieugiow, Amiam,</HI> and <HI>Siam,</HI>
according to the ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> Laws; adding farther, That if they might
be admitted to Trade upon equal Terms with those three Nations, they
would in acknowledgment thereof, every third Year come and Salute his
Majesty, bringing Presents; but with this <HI>Proviso,</HI> That the Ship or Ships
which brought the Ambassadors, might have Licence to depart in due time,
without staying for the return of them; because the Vessels which were us'd
to salt Water, could not be continu'd in fresh, without very great da∣mage.</P>
<P>But the Ambassadors, after all their Endeavors, were not able to effect any
thing, being not well furnish'd with Money, the Key of the Work, and that
which gives a quick dispatch to all Affairs in <HI>China;</HI> for they had already
disposed both of their Presents, and Silver, and to take up Money at Eight or
Ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> for a Months time, they did not think it convenient; and there∣fore
they resolv'd to apply themselves to the Emperor himself, who was
pleas'd to send to know how far the Council had proceeded in the Busi∣ness;
and understanding that the Ambassadors offer'd every five years to
come and Salute the Emperor, he himself was pleas'd to put out with his
own hand the number of Five, and to insert that of Eight, out of a particular
Inclination to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> alledging, That they had need have five whole
years to go and come, if so be they would only Travel by Day; for said the
Emperor, <HI>How is it possible for them to continue such tedious Voyages, if you allow them
no longer time? Beside, why should we straiten them in such a Point, who do not stand
in need of me, nor fear me, but out of a singular Respect and Affection come to Salute me
with their Goods and Presents? Certainly we ought to use these People more kindly, that
so after they have perform'd such Undertakings, they may tarry at home and rest themselves
for two or three years.</HI></P>
<P>This favorable Answer of the Emperor gave great encouragement to the
Ambassadors to hope well of their Business; but the Chancellors chief Se∣cretary
did all that possibly he could, to disswade them from making over
much haste with what they had to desire further of his Imperial Majesty,
saying, <HI>Is it not enough that such, who never till then address'd themselves in Embassy to
Salute his Majesty, and were so much prejudic'd by former Aspersions, as made them almost
unacceptable to many great Persons in</HI> China, <HI>be receiv'd and admitted as Friends and
Allies at the first Overture, and have leave to progress through the Country?</HI> where∣fore
he endeavor'd to perswade the Ambassadors not to insist too much upon a
free Trade, that being the way to unhinge their well-begun Business; for
they were not to imagine, that the Emperor and his Council were oblig'd to
grant at first sight all what'ere they should desire; and therefore advis'd them
to forbear mentioning a free Trade till their next Return, when they would
have a better opportunity. But the Ambassadors did not think fit to follow
his Advice, because the time drew near that the Emperor was to make his
Entrance into his new Palace, when he had appointed and promised the Am∣bassadors
to give them Audience: But before they could have a Hearing,
they were first to perform Obedience in the old Palace, where the Emperor's
Treasure and Seal are kept, in regard, according to a Proverb amongst the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> this Place is older than the Emperor, and therefore chosen and bless'd
by Heaven, and the first Honor doth also belong unto it; so that all Foreign
<PB N="114" REF="70"/>
Ambassadors who refuse to pay such Respects, must not appear before the
Emperor, but depart without a Hearing, as it hapned to the Ambassador of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> who, to preserve the Dignity and Esteem of his Lord and Master,
would not perform here the usual Complement and Ceremony. Likewise
all the Grandees of the Kingdome must do their Duty here ere they appear
before his Majesty; nay more, the Emperor himself, before he is Install'd, is
oblig'd to come and bow here. This Custom is usually perform'd by Am∣bassadors
three Days before their Audience.</P>
<P>Upon the 22. of <HI>August</HI> came the Agents of the <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roys, with
the Mandorin <HI>Pinxenton</HI> and others of <HI>Canton,</HI> early in the Morning, to our
Lodgings; and not long after also appear'd three <HI>Chinese</HI> Doctors, and some
of the Court, in very rich Habits: These Persons conducted the Ambassa∣dors
and their Followers in great State into a Room of the old Palace, much
like a Library; for we saw none but Scholars and Gown-men, with Books
in their Hands: from whence after some short stay, we were conducted
into an open Court, within a high Wall, where we were commanded at the
voice of the Herald to kneel three times, and to bow our Heads to the Ground:
after a short pause the Herald proclaim'd aloud in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language, <HI>Cas∣chan,</HI>
which in <HI>English</HI> is, <HI>God hath sent the Emperor:</HI> afterwards he cried
aloud, <HI>Quee,</HI> that is, <HI>Fall upon your Knees:</HI> then he pronounced the word <HI>Canto,</HI>
signifying, <HI>Bow your Head:</HI> after that, <HI>Coe,</HI> bidding them <HI>Stand up;</HI> and this
did he three times in order one after another, wherein we also conform'd:
at last he signified to us that we should stand aside, which we did. All these
Ceremonies were perform'd in presence of at least a hundred <HI>Chinese</HI> Doctors
or Rabbies: after which we return'd to our Lodgings.</P>
<P>And now the Ambassadors, according to the Custom, were to appear up∣on
the 25. of <HI>August</HI> before the Emperor, but were prevented by the sudden
Death of the Emperor's youngest Brother, who being about six years of Age,
hapned to die upon the 23. of the same Month, not without suspicion of Poy∣son
by some of the Council, who it seems (as we were told) did not think him
worthy to live, because he had provoked the Emperor in some ill Language
before our arrival at <HI>Peking.</HI> But others ascrib'd his Death to a violent Cold
he took by drinking a Glass of Ice-Water, being very hot, which put him in∣to
such a violent Distemper, that he died in few hours after: The Emperor
seem'd very much to lament his Death; for he would not be seen by any
Person in three Days. This young Prince was kept a whole Month before
his Interment, so that the Ambassadors were held from having Audience of
the Emperor until the second of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 14. of <HI>August</HI> they understood, that the Ambassador of <HI>Muscovy</HI>
went from thence without Audience, becaus'd he refus'd to bow to the Seal
of the Emperor, so to preserve the Honor and Dignity of his Lord and Ma∣ster.
One of his Gentlemen came about Noon, whilst the Ambassadors
were at Dinner, and took leave in the Name of the all the rest; and he desir'd
likewise the favour of a Letter, to shew in <HI>Russia</HI> that he had found us here;
which was presently granted. Afterwards we were inform'd, That this
Ambassador was not suffer'd to depart, till such time as the Emperor had
given him a Pass.</P>
<P>The next Day after the Funeral the Emperor sent word to the Chancellor,
that he should conduct the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadors upon that Day before his Ma∣jesties
Throne, as also those of the <HI>Great Mogol.</HI> He accordingly gave notice
<FIGURE>
<PB N="115" REF="70"/>
</FIGURE>
by Proclamation to all the Grandees in <HI>Peking,</HI> that they were then to appear
in the Court before the Royal Throne.</P>
<P>Upon the Day appointed for this long expected Audience, came the Man∣dorin
<HI>Pinxenton,</HI> with the Agents and <HI>Mandorins</HI> of the <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roys, and
some others of the Court, in very rich Habits, to our Lodgings, about two a
Clock in the Afternoon, with Lanterns to conduct the Ambassadors, who
were only attended by six of their Followers, the rest being order'd to stay at
home. When they came to the Court, they were first conducted through the
outward Gate, and afterwards over a Quadrangle with a well-built Gate, and
plac'd upon the second Plain of the Court, where we sat all Night in the open
Air, upon the bare Stones, till Morning, when his Majesty was to appear up∣on
his Throne. We were no sooner seated, but the Ambassador of the
<HI>Great Mogol,</HI> accompanied with five Persons of Honor, and about twenty Ser∣vants,
came and plac'd himself next to our Ambassadors, as did also the Am∣bassadors
of <HI>Lammas</HI> and <HI>Suytadsen,</HI> next to whom also sat several great Lords
of the Empire. And because we were to continue in this Posture all Night,
in expectation of his Majesties appearance in the Morning early upon his
Throne, I shall defer a while acquainting the Reader with what pass'd upon
that most glorious Day; and in the mean time give you a Description of the
Forein Ambassadors, who were also with us in this Emperor's Court.</P>
<P>The Ambassador of <HI>Suytadsen</HI> (who may be properly call'd <HI>South-Tartars)</HI>
deserves here the first and chiefest Place, being he was most in esteem in this
Court, and preferr'd before the rest. I could not certainly learn his Business,
but only as they told me by guess, That the King of <HI>Suytadsen</HI> Sent him with
Presents to the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> according to the Custom of their Country; the
Frontier People and Borderers using to pay such Homage to this their Grand
Lord.</P>
<P>He had a Coat on which came down to his Knees, made of Sheep-skins
dy'd Crimson; his Arms were naked up to the very Shoulders, his upper
Garment being Sleeveless; his Cap sate close to his Head, turn'd up or edg'd
with Sables, the Crown whereof was plum'd with a Tuft of a Horses Tail,
colour'd Red also, which is with them in as much esteem as Ostrich Feathers;
his Breeches made of a slight Stuff, hung down to his mid-legs, in a most slo∣venly
<FIGURE>
<PB N="116" REF="71"/>
</FIGURE>
manner; the Boots he wore were so heavy and large, that he could
hardly walk in them; upon his right Thigh, mounted according to the <HI>Tar∣tar</HI>
and <HI>Chinese</HI> fashion, was a broad heavy Sword, so that he looked more like
a Soldier than an Ambassador. All his Attendants were Cloth'd after the
same manner, each having a Bow and Arrows at his Back.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> Ambassador (of whose Business and Request we have already
made mention) had a very rich blue Silk Coat on, so richly embroider'd, that
it look'd like massie beaten Gold; which hanging down almost to his Knees,
was girt about his Waste with a Silk Girdle, with great rich Tassels at both
ends; he wore neat Buskins of <HI>Turky</HI> Leather, and a large <HI>Turbant</HI> of several Colours.</P>
<P>The Empire of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> (who had sent this Ambassador to the <HI>Great
Cham)</HI> comprehends properly the <HI>Northern</HI> part of <HI>East-India,</HI> or the Country
situate between <HI>Mount Caucasus</HI> (now call'd <HI>Delauguer)</HI> and the Sea beetwee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the River <HI>Ganges</HI> and <HI>Indus.</HI></P>
<P>This Empire, call'd <HI>Mogol,</HI> had its Name from the <HI>Tartar</HI> Kings, who for∣merly
made themselves Masters of it, and is divided into several Kingdoms,
though some of them belong to other Princes. The chiefest Kingdoms over
which the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> properly Commands, are <HI>Cambaya, Dely, Sanque, Mandro,</HI>
and <HI>Bengala.</HI> This great Prince commonly keeps his Court in the City of
<HI>Dely.</HI></P>
<P>All the Countries over which the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> Commands, are very fruitful
in the product of all manner of Cattel and Fruits, as Rice, Corn, Wax, Silk,
Sugar, and Cotton; and all sorts of Spices, which are brought from thence
in great abundance. Upon the Mountains are found the Onyx Stone, Dia∣monds,
and other Precious Gems.</P>
<P>It is held for certain, that this <HI>Great Mogol</HI> can bring into the Field, in a
very short time, three hundred thousand Fighting Men, and five thousand
Elephants.</P>
<P>Most of the Inhabitants are <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and other Idolaters. In those Parts
there are also abundance of <HI>Iews,</HI> who drive a subtle Trade amongst them,
and some <HI>Abyssine Christians,</HI> allur'd thither by a profitable Commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="71"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The Ambassadors of the-<HI>Lammas</HI> was Cloth'd in Yellow; his Hat much
like a Cardinals, with broad Brims; at his side hung a Crucifix, which these
Church-men commonly carry about with them, by which they say their De∣votions
after the manner of the <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> Those of <HI>Lammas</HI> are a sort
of religious People, who had liv'd a long time in <HI>China;</HI> but the last Emperor
of <HI>China,</HI> before the <HI>Tartars</HI> conquer'd it, had banish'd them his Country, from
whence they went and settled themselves in <HI>Tartary,</HI> where they had the free
Exercise of their Religion. Now these banish'd People had sent this Ambas∣sador
to the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> with Request that they might have leave to return and
Exercise their Devotions as formerly. What success he had in his Business I
could not learn, but his Reception at the Emperor's Court was very Friendly
and Civil.</P>
<P>Now I shall proceed to relate what pass'd during our stay in the Emperor's
Palace.</P>
<P>At the Court-Gate, in which we sat expecting the Dawn, we saw first three
black Elephants, gallantly adorn'd after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner, standing there for
the greater State as Centinels: They had well girded upon their Backs gilded
Towers, artificially built, and beautifi'd with Carv'd Works and Figures.
The concourse of People was here so great, as if the whole City had been
throng'd together in this one place; the Gates were also kept with an incredi∣ble
number of the Emperor's Life-guard, all of them in very rich Habits af∣ter
the <HI>Tartar</HI> fashion.</P>
<P>By day-break all the Grandees, who likewise repair'd thither over Night,
came gazing and looking upon us with great admiration, as if we had been
some strange <HI>Africk</HI> Monsters; but they demean'd themselves very civilly,
without giving us the least Affront. About an hour after, a sign was given,
at which all started up on the sudden, as if there had been an Alarm, when the
two <HI>Tartar</HI> Lords who usually were sent to the Ambassadors, came and con∣ducted
them with their Followers through another Gate into a second Court∣yard,
guarded round with <HI>Tartar</HI> Soldiers and Courtiers; and from thence to
a third Court, which was the innermost, where the House of the Emperor's
Throne stood, and the Lodgings for the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> his Wife and Children.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="72"/>
This Court, which contains four hundred Paces in the square, was lin'd
on all sides with a strong Guard, all of them in rich Coats of crimson-colour'd
Sattin.</P>
<P>On either side of the Throne stood a hundred and twelve Soldiers, each
whereof bore a several Flag, and likewise wore colour'd Habits sutable to his
Ensign, only they had all black Hats with yellow Feathers. Next to the Em∣perors
Throne stood twenty two Gentlemen, each with a rich yellow Skreen
or Umbrello in his Hand, resembling the Sun; next to these stood ten other
Persons, each holding a gilt radiant Circle in his Hand, resembling the Sun:
next to these stood six others with Circles, imitating the Moon at the Full:
after these were standing sixteen other Persons, with Half-Pikes or Poles in
their Hands, hung full of Silk Tassels of several colours: near to these stood
thirty six more, each holding a Standard, curiously adorn'd with Dragons
(the Emperor's Coat of Arms) and other such Monsters, after the <HI>Chinese</HI> fa∣shion.
In this manner were both sides of the Emperor's Throne guarded and
adorn'd; besides an infinite number of Courtiers, all of them in very rich
Habits, of one Colour and Silk, as if a Livery; which added very much to
to the Splendor of the Place.</P>
<P>Before the Steps leading to the Emperor's Throne, stood on each side six
Snow-white Horses, most curiously adorn'd with rich embroider'd Trap∣pings,
and Bridles beset with Pearls, Rubies, and other Precious Stones.</P>
<P>Whilst we were beholding with admiration all the Pomp and Splendor of
this Court, we heard the noise and jingling of a little Bell, sounding sweet
and delightful to the Ear.</P>
<P>Hardly had this Clock or Bell finish'd the Alarm, but we saw the old <HI>Tutang,</HI>
with thirty of the most eminent Persons and chief Councellors of the Empire,
in very rich Habits, go and make their Obedience in great State and Humi∣lity
to the Emperor's Trone, which was after this manner: There stood a
Herald who first made Proclamation, and then the <HI>Tutang,</HI> with those that ac∣companied
him, fell upon their Knees, and bowed down their Heads nine
times to the Ground, whilst delightful Musick, both Vocal and Instrumental,
fill'd up the vacancies of the Ceremony.</P>
<P>No sooner had these Lords perform'd their Obedience to the Emperor's
Throne, but immediately another Sett of very eminent Persons came, doing
the like in the same manner: Then followed the Ambassador of the <HI>Suytadsen,</HI>
and the Ambassador of the <HI>Lammas,</HI> who were conducted to the Throne in ex∣traordinary
State by the first and second Chancellors: and after these had
done all their Reverence to the Chair, the Chancellor came to our Ambassa∣dors,
and ask'd them what Quality or Dignity they had; they answer'd him,
That they had the same with the Vice-Roys: After the same Chancellor went
to the <HI>Mogol</HI> Ambassador, and asked him the same Question likewise; who
answer'd, That he was of that Quality with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadors; where∣upon
he was plac'd by the Chancellor in the like degree of Honor and Dignity
with them.</P>
<P>In the Centre of the Quadrangle, over against the middle Gate of his Ma∣jesties
Throne, stood twenty extraordinary Mark-stones, which were Inscrib'd
with <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, cut upon Brass Plates, signifying the Quality of the
Person which must stand or kneel upon them.</P>
<P>The Under <HI>Tutang</HI> went on the left-side, and made signs to the Ambassadors
that they were to make up the tenth Stone, and there was to be their Station.</P>

Being thus plac'd, the Herald call'd to them aloud, saying, <HI>Go stand before the
Throne;</HI> hereupon we made up to the Throne: then the Herald call'd again,
and said, <HI>Step into your Place;</HI> which accordingly was done: then he spoke
again, saying, <HI>Bow your Heads three times to the Ground;</HI> which we did: at last
he call'd to us, and said, <HI>Rise up,</HI> and we rose; and this hapned three times
one after another: Last of all the Herald cried aloud, <HI>Return to your Place;</HI>
whereupon we retir'd to our Stand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassadors, together with the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s, were afterwards con∣ducted
to a Stage or Theatre, which propt the Seats of the Throne, about
twenty Foot in heighth, and curiously built, and adorn'd with several Galle∣ries
of Alabaster, or such like white Stone: And after they had kneel'd and
bow'd their Heads once more, they were order'd to sit down, and then Treated
civilly with <HI>Tartar Thea,</HI> mingled with Milk, in woodden Dishes and Cups;
but the Ambassadors Attendants stay'd below, not wanting the same Liquor.
Soon after the Bells tinkled again, which cast all the People upon their Knees.
We endeavor'd what we could to get a sight of the Emperor in his Throne as
he sat in State, but the crowd of his Courtiers about him was such, that it
eclipsed him from us in all his Glory.</P>
<P>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate about thirty Paces from the Ambassadors; his Throne so glister'd
with Gold and Precious Stones, that it dazled the Eyes of all the Beholders.
The Ambassadors themselves, being confin'd to keep their Station, could dis∣cern
very little of him. Next, and on both sides him, sate the Vice-Roys,
Princes of the Blood, and other Great Officers of the Court, all likewise
drinking <HI>Thea</HI> in Wooden Dishes, and that in great abundance. These Gran∣dees
wore all one sort of Habit, which was extraordinary rich; they had Blue
Satin Coats on, curiously interwoven with Golden Dragons and Serpents
(the Emperor's Blazonry); their Caps embroider'd with Gold, and deck'd
with Diamonds and other Precious Stones, which signified their Degrees and
Qualities. On each side of the Throne stood forty of his Majesties Life-Guard,
arm'd with Bowes and Arrows, who hindred the Ambassadors from
seeing the Emperor.</P>
<P>This Mighty Prince having sate thus in Magnificent State about a quarter
of an Hour, rose up with all his Attendants; and as the Ambassadors were
withdrawing, <HI>Iacob de Keyser</HI> observ'd the Emperor to look back after them,
and for as much as he could discern of him, he was young, of fair Complex∣ion,
middle Stature, and well proportion'd, being cloth'd and shining all in
clinquant Gold. We much admir'd that the Emperor suffer'd the Ambassa∣dors
to depart without once speaking to them; but this is a Custom not on∣ly
among the <HI>Chineses,</HI> but also amongst other Eastern People, That their
Kings and Emperors seldom appear to their own Subjects, much less to Fo∣reiners:
besides, it has been observ'd through all Times amongst the Empe∣rors
of <HI>China,</HI> That they never shew themselves to any Stranger whatsoever,
but only to their own Domesticks, and then seated in State upon the Imperial
Throne.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors departed; and the Courtiers, Soldiers, and Life-Guard
march'd off in much disorder. By reason of the infinite concourse of Peo∣ple,
we had trouble enough before we got to our Lodgings, though we had a
sufficient Guard, to clear the Way before us.</P>
<P>We were no sooner come into our Lodgings, but two of the chiefest of
the Council repair'd thither in the Name of his Majesty, to request the sight
<PB N="120" REF="74"/>
of a Pack of <HI>Dutch</HI> Cloths which the Emperor was desirous to see. The Am∣bassadors
presented them with a black Velvet Suit and Cloke, a Pair of Boots
and Spurs, a Pair of Silk Stockings, Boot-hose-tops, Drawers, a Band, Shirt,
Sword, Belt, and Bever; all which seem'd so very rich to the Emperor, that
he said, <HI>If the Ambassadors wear such Habits, how must their Kings be cloth's then?</HI>
In the Evening the Emperor sent back all the Cloths by one of his Council,
who very much admir'd the Stuff of the Hat, and ask'd of what and where
the same was made.</P>
<P>And to the end all Men may be sensible how far this Court exceeds all the
Royal Palaces in <HI>Europe,</HI> for Splendor, Art, Wealth, and Pleasure, I shall
give you a large Account thereof, and of the Platform of it, which I took
my self.</P>
<P>This Imperial Court, which is exactly square, contains three Miles in
circumference; within the second Wall of the City on the North-side, being
fortifi'd also with strong Stone Battlements fifteen Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> high. In this Wall
are four Gates, (in the middle of each side one) which have their Prospects to
the four Angles of the World, and so nam'd after the four Cardinal Winds;
but that which stands toward the South, is the chiefest, and most us'd. We
pass'd through this Gate when we went to appear before the Emperor's
Throne, and from thence into a base Court, which had a well-pav'd cross
Way of four hundred Paces, with a Water-Trench cut through the middle,
and over it a Stone Bridge of fourteen Paces, very curiously built; but the
Water was in some places cover'd over with Weeds. Before this Graff or
Channel stands also drawn up upon the Plain, a great number of <HI>Tartars,</HI>
Horse and Foot, who as Sentinels suffer none to pass through: when you are
over this Bridge, you come to the first Gate, guarded with the black Elephants;
through this Porch, being fifty Paces long, and built upon five stately Arches,
you come into the first Quadrangle, which is also four hundred Paces large,
and whether we were brought by <HI>Pinxenton</HI> (as hath been already said) to ex∣pect
with the other Ambassadors the coming of the Emperor. This Plain is
well built, with uniform and stately Houses, standing in the midst of three
more lofty and fortifi'd Edifices, which are so strengthned with high thick
Walls and Bulwarks, that they are able to defend the Place. From this Court
there are Passages underneath the three great Structures, which leads into a
second Quadrangle of four hundred Paces wide, built and adorn'd with brave
Buildings as the former. From hence you pass into the third and last Plain,
also square, and of the same bigness with the former. This Quadrangle which
lies directly in the Cross, and pav'd with gray Stone, the <HI>Great Cham</HI> chose him∣self
for his own Residence. Here also are most sumptuous and costly Build∣ings;
but the chiefest among these are four, which exceed all the rest in Mag∣nificence,
Art, and Beauty, and take up at least a third part of three sides of
the Court.</P>
<P>Directly forward appears the Building where his Imperial Majesty sat up∣on
his Throne, and which is far more stately and sumptuous than the former,
into which you enter through three ample and curious Arches. In this third
Court reside only the Emperor and Empress, and none are permitted to
enter here but their Attendants.</P>
<P>The Emperor, according to the Custom of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Princes, maintains
several Women in this his <HI>Seraglio;</HI> but amongst all those, only one assumes
the Title of <HI>Empress,</HI> all the rest are his Concubines, performing Duties in se∣veral
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="74"/>

<PB REF="75"/>
<PB N="121" REF="75"/>
Degrees; some wait on the King himself, others look to the keeping of
the Rooms and Chambers decent and clean; some take care of the Children,
others only of the Emperor's Bed-Chamber, Kitchin, and Table. Of these
Concubines, in their several Attendancies, there are at least five thousand;
most of them no more than Maid-Servants.</P>
<P>Such shews this Palace within, if you go through the South-Gate straight
to the third Plain, or the Emperor's Abode. The like Courts, and as many,
appear going through the other Gates, with all such Buildings and Adorn∣ments;
for the whole circumference of the Court is cut through in the mid∣dle
in the form of a Cross, and in several places equally and orderly divided.
Without the third Plain, which lies in the middle of the Court, and upon
which stand the Emperor's Buildings, are several pleasant Gardens, Palaces,
Woods, Pools, Rivers, and delicate Summer-Houses, which the Emperor
caus'd to be made for his Pleasure; and each is so large, that it is fit enough
for any Prince to live in; so that this Palace contains several Courts for Kings
within the Walls.</P>
<P>Each of the Emperor's Children, so soon as they are ten years old, are set∣led
in one of these Quadrangles. The four Concubines whom the Emperor
hath chosen from amongst the rest for his peculiar Pleasure, have also each of
them without the third Plain, a particular Dwelling or Court, where they
keep State; and which are built opposite to the four Corners of the World,
facing the four principal Winds.</P>
<P>There are besides in this Court a great many other Houses and Dwellings
for their Priests, Artificers, Servants, and others; it was affirm'd to me, That
the whole number of Persons residing here amounts at least to fifteen or
sixteen thousand.</P>
<P>All the Edifices, which are very many, are most richly adorn'd with gilt
Galleries, Balcones, and Carv'd Imagery, to the admiration of all that ever
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw them. Each Dwelling hath a large Pent-house, so that you may walk dry
in Rainy Weather. Most of the Timber which appears on the out-side of
the Houses, is either gilt, or colour'd over with a certain Gum which they
call <HI>Cie,</HI> much in use amongst them, and wherewith they colour or paint their
Houshold-stuff, Ships, and Houses, that they make them shine and glitter like
Looking-glasses.</P>
<P>All the Roofs of the Buildings are cover'd with yellow glaz'd Pantiles,
which shine, when the Sun reflects on them, brighter than Gold: And this
has given some occasion to think, that the Roof of this Royal Palace was
cover'd with pure Gold; whereas, in truth, the Tiles are only made of Clay,
and glaz'd and neil'd over with artificial Yellow: But yet, as I was told, each
of these Tiles are fastned with an Iron Nail, whereof the Head is gilt, which
makes so much the more Splendor.</P>
<P>Beside the above-mention'd Channel or Graff, which is very shallow, and
over-grown with Weeds, there is yet another in this Palace, Which doth run
through the whole Court, with several Windings and Turnings, and serves
to water the Gardens and Woods. This receives its Water from the River <HI>Yo,</HI>
which springs from a Pool call'd <HI>Si,</HI> near to the Mountain <HI>Iaciven,</HI> and is
within the Emperor's Court so broad and deep, that it will bear great Vessels,
which come laden in, to the great convenience of the Inhabitants. This River
sends also its Streams to those Rocks or Cliffs made by Art, whereof we for∣merly
made mention.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="76"/>
There is not any thing wherein the <HI>Chineses</HI> shew their Ingenuity more,
than in these Rocks or artificial Hills, which are so curiously wrought, that
Art seems to exceed Nature. These Cliffs are made of a sort of Stone, and
sometimes of Marble, and so rarely adorn'd with Trees and Flowers, that all
that see them are surpris'd with admiration. Rich and wealthy People, espe∣cially
the great Lords and <HI>Mandorins,</HI> have for the most part such Rocks in their
Courts and Palaces, upon which they squander a good part of their Estates.
It was told me of a certainty, that somewhere about <HI>Peking</HI> there are some
Rocks which contain Chambers, Closets, Parlors, Vyvers, Stairs, and all
manner of Trees so curiously wrought and adorn'd by Art, that the like is not
to be seen in the whole World. These artificial Mountains or Cliffs are
commonly contriv'd with Chambers and Anti-chambers, for a defence against
the scorching Heat in Summer, and to refresh and delight the Spirits; for
they commonly make their great Enterainments in these Grots, and the
Learned seek to Study in them rather than any other Place.</P>
<P>If I should relate all the other artificial Ornaments, as of Gardens, Wilder∣nesses,
Pools, and other Particulars, which adorn this Court, I should far ex∣ceed
the bounds of what I intend, and perhaps to some, of belief; but what
hath been already said shall suffice, to set forth the Wonders of this most
magnificent Palace.</P>
<P>Great Endeavors were us'd by me to observe what was most remarkable
and worth taking notice of, as far as the shortness of our stay would permit,
especially concerning its Situation.</P>
<P>It is an ancient Custom at <HI>Peking,</HI> That the Ambassadors (after their Ad∣dresses
to the Emperor) in token that their Affairs are dispatch'd, are Enter∣tain'd
with three Treatments in the name and behalf of the Emperor, upon
the tenth, twentieth, and thirtieth days after their Audience, so that these En∣tertainments
take up a whole Month before they are ended: but in regard our
Ambassadors were desirous to make what haste they could home again, the <HI>Pro∣vidore</HI>
had obtain'd leave of the Emperor, not without great difficulty, that
these three Feasts should be given them upon three following days.</P>
<P>At two of the clock in the Afternoon (upon the same day that we had been
at Court before the Emperor) the Ambassadors were invited, together with
the <HI>Mandorin Pinxenton,</HI> and others, as also the Captains and Soldiers who con∣ducted
them from <HI>Canton</HI> to <HI>Peking,</HI> in the Name of the Emperor, to the first
Feast, at <HI>Providore Lipu</HI>'s House, which was most Noble and Splendid. To
the same Banquet or Entertainment were also invited the Ambassadors of
the <HI>Great Mogol, Suytadsen,</HI> and <HI>Lammas.</HI> Our Ambassadors sate on the same
side of the Table with him of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> and the other two over against
them, with their Followers next unto them. The Dinner consisted of two
Courses: The first Table was full of Fruits and dry'd Sweet-meats; and the
second of boyl'd and Roasted Mutton, Beef, and other Meat. For each of
the Ambassadors, and for two of their Followers, a particular Table was
cover'd with thirty Silver Dishes, full of rare Fruits and Sweet-meats. The
Emperor's Controller (who likewise appear'd at this Feast, representing the
Person of his Majesty) sate alone upon a broad Side-board, with his Legs
across, like a Taylor on his Shop-board; next him sate two other great
Lords, who took order to see the Ambassadors well entertain'd. The Ser∣vants
who brought the Meat to the Table, and waited all Dinner-time,
were no ordinary Persons, but of good Quality, and cloth'd all in Cloth of
Gold.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="76"/>
Before the Ambassadors sate down, they were oblig'd to turn themselves
toward the North, and bow three times, as if the Emperor had been present,
and as they had done when they were before the Imperial Throne.</P>
<P>The Banquet being taken away, the boil'd and roasted Meats were brought
to the Table, but only in three Dishes, and so ill dress'd, that we hardly durst
venture to taste of the Cookery of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>Dinner being almost ended, the Emperor's Steward call'd his Servants, and
gave them all the Dishes which stood before him, only he reserv'd one Dish,
being a roasted Rib of a Camel, of which he eat so heartily, as if he had been
fasting all that Day.</P>
<P>This splendid Treatment finish'd, the Ambassadors, according to the
Custom of the Country, were to put up what they left into their Pockets to
carry home. It was a pleasant Sight, to see how these greasie <HI>Tartars</HI> stuffed
their Pockets and Leather Drawers of their Breeches with fat Meat, that
the Liquor dropt from them as they went along the Streets; so greedy were
they in eating and carrying away, that they were more like Peasants than
Courtiers.</P>
<P>After Dinner the Waiters brought up several Gold and Silver Pots full of
<HI>Zamsou,</HI> and pouring it out into woodden Dishes or Cups, gave round to the
Company, drinking of it lustily themselves. They told us that this Drink
was distill'd from new Milk, and came out of the Emperor's Cellar; and that
this great Favor and Kindness was done to us, because we came from so re∣mote
a Country, and so we must drink away Sorrow. And though this Li∣quor
was almost as strong as Brandy, yet the Ambassadors were forc'd to
pledge the Steward several times, and to take what was left home with them;
but they gave it away to the Soldiers and others who stood at the Gate, who
were better pleas'd with it.</P>
<P>This Dinner being thus ended, the Ambassadors, as formerly, must once
more, in thankfulness for this their splendid Reception, return to the Em∣peror's
Palace to perform their Obedience; which being likewise dispatch'd,
they retir'd to their Lodgings, sufficiently weary with the Ceremony of that
Day.</P>
<P>The next Day being appointed for the second Treat, came the Under-<HI>Tatang</HI>
or <HI>Rix-Providore,</HI> to visit the Ambassadors in their Lodgings, and
ask'd them among other Questions, whether it were true, That the <HI>Dutch</HI>
could live under Water for three Days and three Nights together? for thus
had our Enemies, especially the <HI>Portuguese Iesuits,</HI> reported of us; as also (as
has been said before) that we had no Country, but liv'd as Pyrats on the Sea:
The Ambassadors satisfi'd him in every thing, and told him, That they came
thither to settle a continu'd Trade and Commerce in <HI>China,</HI> as they did in seve∣ral
other Kingdoms, wishing that their Business might be effected. To all
which the <HI>Tutang</HI> reply'd, That he desir'd nothing more, and would endeavor
to further and promote the same with all his power. Thereupon the Ambas∣sadors
acquainted his Highness, That as yet they had done very little in their
Business. To which he answer'd, That at present it could be no otherwise,
but if so be they would once more come and Salute the Emperor, before they
were admitted as Friends and Subjects, he would then assure them, that the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> should be allow'd to Trade freely in all the Emperor's Dominions;
that they needed not to put themselves to any great Charge; and that a few
Presents would effect their Desires.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="77"/>
The Ambassadors having been thus kindly and nobly receiv'd and treated
upon the first day, as has been said, went the next day at Noon to the second
Imperial Banquet, where likewise repair'd the Ambassador of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>
(who sat over against our Ambassadors) with some other <HI>Mandorins</HI> and Prime
Persons of the Empire. They observ'd in short, That the second <HI>Providore</HI>
was more kind and open-hearted to the <HI>Mogol</HI> Ambassador, and to the <HI>Moors</HI>
and other Guests, than to them; whereat they very much wondred, and ask'd
the Interpreter what the cause might be; who intimated, That this great
Lord had not yet been Presented by them as he ought: Concerning which
Omission the Ambassanor took speedy order, little suspecting such neglect;
for they knew not but that <HI>Pinxenton</HI> and the <HI>Canton Mandorins</HI> had Presented all
the Grandees as they ought according to their Qualities, having receiv'd
enough from them for that purpose at <HI>Nanking:</HI> but mistrusting that they
were trepann'd as well by the Servants as by the Masters, they enquir'd ci∣villy
how all their Presents had been dispos'd of; which they in plain terms
refus'd to give an Account of, alledging, That they durst not name those
Persons of Honor to whom they were Presented, lest it should come to the
Emperor's knowledge: for this reason, and because our Business with the
Emperor was not yet dispatch'd as it ought, the last Banquet was deferr'd till
the 14. of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>Upon that Day the Ambassadors appear'd with all their Followers, to par∣take
of the last Treatment: And now the second <HI>Providore</HI> having been like∣wise
Presented by them, they were receiv'd by him with all manner of seem∣ing
Respect and Affection; so great an alteration had the same wrought up∣on
him, that his Carriage and Language were both of another piece and co∣lour,
all soft and melting. Having sat about an hour at the Table, and drank
once or twice about, they were afterwards Presented in the Name of the Em∣peror
with these following Presents, after this manner:</P>
<P>On the side of the Hall, where the Ambassadors were receiv'd and Treated,
stood two long Tables, upon which the Gifts were spread in great order.
First of all they deliver'd the Present for the General <HI>Iohn Maatzuiker,</HI> which
the Ambassadors receiv'd kneeling, with both their Hands; after which they
and all their Followers were call'd by Name, and had each their Presents de∣liver'd
to them likewise upon their Knees. Lastly, as the Ambassadors were
ready to depart, we all of us perform'd our Obedience to the Imperial Throne,
by thrice kneeling and bowing our Heads.</P>

on the behalf of the Emperor, caus'd fifteen Wagons to be brought to carry
the Goods.</P>
<P>Upon the same Day the Ambassadors were sent for to appear before the
Council by the Mandorin <HI>Pinxenton,</HI> in the Court of the <HI>Lipu,</HI> to receive the
Emperor's Letter, written to the Governor-General at <HI>Batavia:</HI> They rode
thither about one of the clock, and were conducted into an Anti-chamber,
<PB N="126" REF="78"/>
where one of the Council took the Letter off the Table, which was cover'd
with a yellow Carpet, and opening the same, declar'd to them the Contents
thereof: It was written double, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Tartar</HI> Tongues, gilded on
the edges, and painted on both sides with golden Dragons: After he had
open'd it, he made the Letter up again, and wrapt it up in a Silk Scarf, put∣ting
it into a Box, to be preserv'd from sullying; then he deliver'd it to the
Ambassadors, which they receiv'd kneeling, with all Humility and Respect:
Afterwards the said Councellor took the Letter again from them, and bind∣ing
it to the Back of one of the Interpreters, he went along with it before the
Ambassadors through the biggest and middle Gate of the Court, which was
set wide open on purpose to make the more way for this Imperial Missive:
which Ceremony was perform'd in great silence; neither was there any
mention made at any of their Feasts and Entertainments of our <HI>Netherland</HI>
Affairs.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Letter runs thus word for word:
<LETTER>
<P>THE King sends this Letter to the <HI>Holland</HI> Governor, General <HI>Iohn Maat∣zuyker,</HI>
at <HI>Batavia.</HI> Our Territories are so far asunder as the East from
the West, so that we can hardly come near one another; and from many fore-going Ages
to this present time, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were never seen before by us. But those that sent
<HI>Peter de Goyer</HI> and <HI>Iacob de Keyser</HI> to me, are a wise and brave People, who in
your Names have appear'd before me, and brought me several Presents. Your Country
is ten thousand Miles distant from me, but you shew your Noble Mind in remembring of
me; for this reason my Heart does very much incline to you, therefore I sent to you two
Rolls of Sattin with Dragons, beside two other Rolls of Sattin, four Rolls of Flower'd
Sattin, four Rolls of Blue Sattin without Flowers, four Rolls of Kin, four Rolls of Chame∣lot,
ten Pieces of Pelinx, ten Pieces of Phansy, ten Pieces of fine Stuffs, and three hun∣dred
Toel of Silver. You have ask'd leave to come and Trade in my Country, to Import
Commodities into it, and to Export others out of it, which will make very much to the
Profit and Advantage of my Subjects: But in regard your Country is so far off, and
the Winds very high here, which will very much endanger your Ships, it would very
much trouble me if any of them should miscarry by the way; therefore if you please to
send hither, I desire it may be but once every eight Years, and no more than one hundred
Men in a Company, whereof twenty may come up to the Place where I keep my Court;
and then you may bring your Merchandizes ashore into your Lodging, without Bartering
them at Sea before <HI>Canton.</HI> This I have thought good to propose for your Interest
and Safety, and I hope it will be well lik'd of by you: And thus much I thought fit
to make known unto you.</P>

<P>The <HI>Rix-Prouidore</HI> was busie at Court about some State-Affairs when the

would willingly have done; for he was their Friend, and could procure any

The Ambassadors being return'd home with this Letter to the General at
<HI>Batavia,</HI> they were urg'd by the Commissioners to depart, who alledg'd, That
it was a Custom among the <HI>Chineses,</HI> after their Dispatch from the Emperor,
not to continue two hours in the City, if they would avoid falling into some
Inconvenience; so that we were necessitated to depart at Noon out of this Im∣perial
City of <HI>Peking,</HI> and had no time to take a view of the Circumference of
the Place, or of any thing else that was rare and worth the notice: for during
our stay, we were continually kept close in our Lodgings, as Recluses in their
Cells, without once stirring abroad to take our Pleasure, though we were well
receiv'd by the Emperor, and provided with a rich Allowance; for the Am∣bassadors

<P>We had Wood and Fruit of all sorts sent in daily in great abundance; as
also <HI>China</HI> Dishes for the Table, according to their manner. But the Ambas∣sadors,

Dishes at their own Charge; but we receiv'd, after we had been before the
Emperor, a double Allowance, which was seldom done to any other Forein

<P><PB N="128" REF="79"/>
In the first place you must know, That the Province wherein this Chief
Imperial City of <HI>Peking</HI> is situate, as also the City it self, have been call'd in
several Times by several Names, in regard it is an ancient Custom among
the <HI>Chineses</HI> (as has been already said) that when the Race which Commands
and Rules over them happens to be alter'd, commonly also then the chiefest
Cities, nay, the whole Kingdom, change and alter their Names. In the Times
of the Race of <HI>Chiva,</HI> this Province and Chief City was call'd <HI>Ieu;</HI> under the
Race of <HI>Cina,</HI> it was call'd <HI>Xangho;</HI> when the Race of <HI>Hana</HI> Reign'd, 'twas
call'd <HI>Quangyang;</HI> and under the Race of <HI>Ciin, Eanyang.</HI> But the Race of <HI>Tai∣minga,</HI>
which drove the <HI>Tartars</HI> out of <HI>China,</HI> nam'd it <HI>Peking</HI> and <HI>Xuntien,</HI> by
both which they now call it.</P>
<P>The City is call'd <HI>Peking,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Northern Chief City,</HI> to distin∣guish
it from <HI>Nanking,</HI> which we Interpret <HI>The Southern City.</HI> But the other
Name <HI>Xuntien,</HI> whereby it is so commonly call'd by the <HI>Chinese</HI> Geogra∣phers,
signifies <HI>Obedient to Heaven.</HI> It is call'd by the <HI>Tartars, Cambalu,</HI> that is,
<HI>The City of the Lord.</HI> It lies in 40 Degrees Northern Latitude, almost upon the
outward Northern Limits of this Province, and the whole Kingdom, not
far from those high Mountains, and that great and famous Wall which sepa∣rates
the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> in the North from each other. It exceeds the
Southern Chief City of <HI>Nanking</HI> in number of Inhabitan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Soldiers, and Ma∣gistrates;
but, on the other hand, is not to be compar'd with <HI>Nanking</HI> for large∣ness,
regular Streets, and Fortifications. Its South-side lies vested with two
high and thick Walls, which are so broad, that twelve Horses may go abrest
upon them, without any hindrance to one another. The inner Wall, which
extends about ten Miles in circuit, is so thick set with Bulwarks, that one may
easily fling a Stone from Tower to Tower. This Wall is all of Stone, and so
very high, that I believe the like is not to be found again in all <HI>Europe;</HI> the
outward Walls, within which the Suhurbs lie environ'd, have very slight For∣tifications,
only on both sides of the Gates are three strong Out-works. In
these Redoubts and Towers the Soldiers by Night keep strict Courts of Guard,
as if the Enemy were at the Gates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor <HI>Taicungus,</HI> who Reigned over <HI>China</HI> in the Year 1404.
did very much embellish this City, and bestow'd several Priviledges upon
it. Amongst the Emperors which belong'd to the Race of <HI>Taiminga,</HI> this <HI>Tai∣cungus</HI>
was the first that left the City of <HI>Nanking,</HI> and setled his Imperial Court
and Residence in this Chief City of <HI>Peking,</HI> the better to hinder and resist the
Inroads and Excursions of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> driven out of the neighboring Coun∣tries
by his Grandfather.</P>
<P>The City has twelve Gates. All Rarities in <HI>China</HI> are brought hither, so that
this City abounds in every thing, fit either for Pleasure or humane Sustenance.
Several thousand Royal Vessels (beside those of private Persons) are continu∣ally
employ'd to fetch all manner of Wares and Curiosities for the Emperor
and his Council at <HI>Peking.</HI> Hither comes all the Revenues which each Pro∣vince
of the Kingdom pays yearly to the Emperor's Exchequer: and the
better to effect this, for the Importing of all Wares to <HI>Peking,</HI> the <HI>Chineses</HI> use
great Endeavors to make all Rivers Navigable, that so they may come with
ease by Water to the Emperor's Court, with the Products of several Provin∣ces.
Iustly may a Man admire at the Workmanship of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which
partly by Art, and partly by Nature, is so brought to pass, that you may come
to this City hundreds of Miles by Shipping from most Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="79"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>By this Importation this Place, though in an unfruitful and barren Soil,
possesses every thing in great abundance, and may be call'd the Granary of
the whole Empire; for they have a Proverb amongst them, <HI>That there grows
nothing in</HI> Peking, <HI>yet there is no want of any thing.</HI></P>
<P>All Commanders and Officers, as well Civil as Military, who have a mind
to be preferr'd, must betake themselves to this City, which prescribes Laws
to all others; and upon this Place alone depends the whole Government of
<HI>China,</HI> so that a very great number of Learned Men and Officers are always
resident here.</P>
<P>The Streets are not pav'd, insomuch that in wet weather (which is seldom)
they are hardly passable; but when the Northern Winds blow, and the Wea∣ther
is dry, the Soil, which is of a light substance, makes a Dust far more noi∣som
to Passengers than the deep and miry Streets; for such it is, that it blinds
a Man as he goes along. The Inhabitants therefore, to prevent this incon∣venience,
are fain to wear Silk Hoods over their Faces; and the extraordi∣nary
foulness of the Way makes very many to keep Horses to carry them after
a rainy Day: for the infinite number of common People that are continu∣ally
up and down, turns this dusty Soil into Mire and Dirt after a little Rain.</P>
<P>There are also Horses or Sedans to be hir'd at any time for the accommo∣dation
of Passengers; but none make use of Sedans or Chairs but Persons of
Quality, in which they are carried in great State.</P>
<P>These Sedans are made very artificially of <HI>Bamboes</HI> or Rushes, in the mid∣dle
whereof stands a Chair, which is cover'd with a Tygers Skin, upon which
he that is carried seats himself, having behind him a Boy with an Umbril in
his Hand to keep off the Sun: His Servants likewise attend him, some of
them going before, and others following after, with Ensigns upon their Shoul∣ders,
whereby the Quality of the Person is known, and he respected accord∣ingly
as he passes along.</P>
<P>The City abounds in extraordinary brave Building, famous Idol-Temples,
high and artificial Towers, and Triumphal Arches, which exceedingly adorn
the same: But we had not so full a view thereof as we could have wish'd,
in regard we were little better (as hath been already said) than confin'd to our
Lodgings by order of the Emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="80"/>
<HI>Marcus Paulus</HI> a <HI>Venetian,</HI> who was in this City in the Year 1275. when the
<HI>Tartars</HI> conquer'd the Southern Provinces of <HI>China,</HI> calls the same in his Wri∣tings
by the Name of <HI>Cambalu,</HI> which he describes in this manner: <HI>The City</HI>
Cambalu, <HI>which lies in the Province of</HI> Cathai, <HI>upon a great River, and signifies</HI> The
City of the Lord, <HI>has been very famous in all Ages.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Great Cham</HI> did transfer this City to another part of the River; for the
Astrologers had foretold him, that it should rise up against him. It lies four-square,
and is twenty four Miles in circumference, so that each side is six
Miles long; the Walls are of white Stone, high and broad; each side of the
Wall has three chief Gates, which make twelve in the whole; and next to
each of these stands a most stately Edifice, wherein the Arms of the City are
preserv'd. The Streets run so straight, that you may see quite through the
City from one Gate to another, and built on both sides with brave large
Houses. In the midst of the City stands a most noble Idol-Temple, wherein
hangs a very large Bell, which they ring three times in an Evening, after
which no body is to go out of his House till the next Morning, unless it be for
the Sick, or to visit their Friends: and whosoever goes out after the Bell has
rung, must take a Light with him. Each Gate is watch'd by a thousand Sol∣diers,
not out of fear of an Enemy, but against Thieves and Rogues, who are
very numerous about this City.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors having taken their leaves of all the Grandees, and the
chiefest of the <HI>Rix-Council,</HI> departed out of this famous Imperial City of <HI>Peking;</HI>
and being come without the Gates thereof, they made a halt, to stay for some
of the Wagons that were behind, by which means I had an opportunity to
take a further view thereof, how the same is situate, and how that famous and
far renown'd Wall doth separate <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and takes its course quite
through the Mountains; a true Description whereof I here give you.</P>
<P>So far doth this Wall reach from East to West, that it takes in four Provin∣ces,
as <HI>Leaotung, Peking, Xansi,</HI> and <HI>Xensi:</HI> It contains three hundred <HI>Dutch</HI>
Miles in length, and begins at an Arm of the Sea, which is situate between the
Province of <HI>Leaotung</HI> and the hanging Island of <HI>Corea,</HI> where the River <HI>Yalo</HI>
flows out of the Eastern <HI>Tartary;</HI> from thence it reaches toward the West to
the Mountains of the City <HI>Kin,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> near to the side of
the <HI>Yellow River:</HI> It runs quite through in a direct Line, but has Turnings and
Windings in some places, yet is no where broken off or parted; only near to
the Frontiers of the Province of <HI>Xansi</HI> lies a very high Mountain, which makes
a separation in the Wall to give way to this Mountain; also where it gives
passage to the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> it has a breach for so much space; but for other
small Rivers, they run through the Wall, without any separation, by Arches
and Sluces; otherwise it is every where alike: It is about thirty Cubits, or
forty five Foot high, and some fifteen Cubits broad. Several strong Watch-Towers
are built upon this Wall, which stand at a distance from each other,
and were formerly guarded by Soldiers.</P>
<P>Heretofore the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor, as also at present the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> maintain'd
for the defence of this Wall, and against the Inroads of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> ten hun∣dred
thousand Men, who kept Watch Day and Night by turns in the said
Watch-Towers.</P>
<P>The building of this Wall was begun under the Government of the Empe∣ror
<HI>Chius,</HI> who was a brave Prince, and did many great and noble Deeds, as
well in time of Peace as War; there was never any <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor, before
<PB N="131" REF="80"/>
nor since, to be compar'd with him. When this Emperor had conquer'd the
Race of <HI>Cheva,</HI> and had brought all <HI>China</HI> under his subjection, he was preferr'd
to the Imperial Throne, being before but a petty King. Being seated in the
Throne, he caus'd this Wall to be built, having conquer'd the <HI>Tartars,</HI> the irre∣concileable
Enemies of the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> to hinder and prevent by that
means their Inroads into the Kingdom. This great Work was begun by him
in the twentieth Year of his Reign, two hundred years before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth;
about which he employ'd so great number of Workmen, that it was finish'd in
five years. Through all <HI>China</HI> the Emperor commanded three Men out of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en to work upon this Wall, which is so well built, and so strong, that there
is not the least crack in it. This Wall is admirable, not only for the length
and breadth, but in regard of its durableness, having lasted for so many Ages
without alteration, being as entire as when it was first built.</P>
<P>After some short stay without the Gates of the City, we got all our Carria∣ges
together, and then began our Iourney back with all our Followers, by
the same Way we came.</P>
<P>We Lodg'd that Night in a Village call'd <HI>Pekinsin,</HI> and the next day pass'd
by the City of <HI>Tongsiou,</HI> and in the Afternoon came to the City of <HI>Sancianwey,</HI>
where the Emperor's Vessels were still lying which brought us from <HI>Nanking;</HI>
expecting our coming: The Skippers came to meet the Ambassadors, to bid
them welcom, and help carry our Goods Aboard; but the <HI>Mandorins,</HI> whom
the Emperor had order'd to wait upon us, to conduct us to <HI>Canton,</HI> would not
suffer the Ambassadors to Embarque in those Vessels, but in others which
were provided by order of the Emperor. These Vessels they call'd <HI>Ionken,</HI>
and were very large, having several Conveniences, but lay so low and slug∣gish
upon the Water, that they durst not venture themselves in them, lest they
should not arrive at <HI>Canton</HI> soon enough, but be forc'd to Winter there; there∣fore
the Ambassadors, to make no difference or hatred between the <HI>Mandorins</HI>
and our old Skippers, took neither the new <HI>Ionkens</HI> nor their old Ships, but
hir'd small Vessels, to make the more speed. And having taken order about
our Business, and shipp'd our Goods, we set Sail again from this <HI>Sansianwey,</HI>
with the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Lords whom the Emperor had order'd to attend the Am∣bassador's,
together with the <HI>Mandorins</HI> of <HI>Canton,</HI> and came late in the Night
to a small Village upon the River <HI>Guei,</HI> where we continu'd till Morning.
<HI>Pinxenton</HI> in the mean time parted from us at <HI>Sancianwey,</HI> and took his Way
over Land to <HI>Lincing,</HI> where we had left his Wife and Children as we went
to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>In our Return from <HI>Peking</HI> to <HI>Canton,</HI> we took the same Way we came, but
pass'd by several Cities and Villages without entring into them.</P>
<P>Upon the 23. of <HI>October</HI> we came to <HI>Singlo,</HI> and the next day to <HI>Sincocien;</HI>
upon the 25. we got to <HI>Tonquam,</HI> and the 27. to <HI>Tacheu.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 31. of of the same Month we got to <HI>Lincing,</HI> where the Ambassa∣dors
were nobly receiv'd and Treated by the Mandorin <HI>Pinxenton.</HI> We stay'd
here two or three days at the Request of the said <HI>Mandorin,</HI> who made very
much of us all that while; and then we set Sail with a good Wind at North,
which blew so very hard and cold, that we were hardly able to endure it.</P>
<P>Upon the fifth of <HI>November,</HI> having undergone much hardship, we got to
<HI>Tunchant,</HI> and the next day to <HI>Xansiu,</HI> where we could procure no fresh Men to
Tow forward our Vessels. The Ambassadors, to lose no longer time, hir'd
such as they could meet withal in the Streets.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="81"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Upon the eighth of <HI>November</HI> we came in sight of <HI>Cinning,</HI> and on the 13. fol∣lowing
to <HI>Tamincien.</HI></P>
<P>From thence we got into the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> and on the 17. to the City of
<HI>Iamcefu,</HI> where the Ambassadors were heartily welcom'd by the Base Brother
of the young <HI>Canton</HI> Vice-Roy, and nobly Treated at his House. After this
friendly Reception we took leave, and came upon the 20. into the River of
<HI>Kiang,</HI> and the next day got before <HI>Nanking.</HI></P>
<P>We came with our Vessels before the Gate where we had Anchor'd in go∣ing;
and in regard the Governor stood upon his departure, we could not
procure other Vessels with that speed as we desir'd, whereby we had an op∣portunity
to take a more exact view of the City, and to refresh our selves a
while after so tedious and troublesom a Iourney in the heart of <HI>China;</HI> but
the Weather prov'd so very bad and cold, that there was no going abroad all
the while we continu'd here.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors themselves were often invited by several Grandees to
Dinner; but the Weather proving so extreme ill, they could go no where:
only they gave a Visit to the two Chief Toll-masters, who liv'd in the Sub∣urb,
whereof the one was a <HI>Chinese,</HI> the other a <HI>Tartar,</HI> and both very brave
Persons. These two Gentlemen shew'd a very great Respect to the Ambas∣sadors,
during their stay before this City.</P>
<P>Having provided our selves with Necessaries, we departed from <HI>Nanking</HI>
upon the 10. of <HI>December;</HI> and the 15. we pass'd by a high Rock, which we,
in memory of <HI>William Vander Beek,</HI> in our Iourney forward, call'd by the Name
of <HI>Beekenburg.</HI> The River <HI>Kiang</HI> is about this Place almost a Mile broad, and
in foul Weather proves very rough and dangerous; on the Bank of which lie
a great many Rocks under Water.</P>
<P>Upon the 19. at Sun-set we came to <HI>Nankang:</HI> It blew very hard all that
Night, and continu'd so till the 21. when it began to abate: we then set Sail
again, and pass'd over the Pool of <HI>Poyan,</HI> and from thence came to the famous
Village of <HI>Ucinjeen,</HI> where we were forc'd to stay a while to get fresh Men to
Tow our Vessels. We found that in our absence a violent Fire had destroy'd
at least a hundred brave Houses in this Place.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="81"/>
Upon the 23. we came again to the famous City of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> which I have
already describ'd at large, and given you an account of what I then saw in our
Iourney forward; but in regard we continu'd three days in this City, I had
an opportunity to satisfie the Curiosity of the Reader with a further Descri∣ption
of the Situation thereof.</P>
<P>After we had furnish'd our selves here with other Vessels, we set Sail
again upon the twenty sixth; but having gone about a League, it began to
blow so very hard, that we were forc'd to return back for shelter under the
Walls of the City, where we Lodg'd all Night in safety. The next day we
departed early in the morning, and saw the Hills on both sides of the River
cover'd with Snow.</P>
<P>Upon the fist of <HI>Ianuary 1657.</HI> we arriv'd at the City of <HI>Kinnungam,</HI> where
the next day, though with much difficulty, we procur'd fresh Men to Tow
our Vessels, and about two of the clock in the Afternoon set Sail again to pro∣secute
our Voyage.</P>
<P>Upon the fifteenth day of the same Month we got before the ruin'd City
of <HI>Vannungam,</HI> where the Ambassadors were no sooner gone Ashore, but the
Governor of the Place came to bid them welcom; and likewise when we
departed from thence, he Presented the Ambassadors with some Refreshments
for the Kitchin, and amongst the rest, with some Candles, which were made
of a thick oylie Iuice, taken off of some Trees: These Candles burnt very
clear and sweet.</P>
<P>After we were provided with fresh Men to Tow our Boats, and expert
Pilots (for without such there is no venturing upon this River) we set Sail
again, and pass'd by very many Rocky and dangerous Places, which were not
as we came observable, the Water then being three Foot higher, but now
they appear'd above the Stream: and notwithstanding all our care, the Vessel
in which the Ambassadors were, hapned to strike against one of them, but
with the turning and Eddies of the Stream she got off again without any con∣siderable
damage. About eleven of the clock we got safe beyond all these
threatning Dangers, which appear'd first at the City of <HI>Vannungam,</HI> and ended
over against an Idol-Temple, extending about three Leagues. The <HI>Chineses</HI>
and <HI>Tartars</HI> who frequent this River, do commonly Offer at the fore-men∣tion'd
Temple, that they may have a speedy and safe Voyage through these
Difficulties.</P>
<P>Upon the 10. we came before <HI>Cancheu,</HI> where the Governor in great State
came to welcom and receive the Ambassadors in the Name of the <HI>Tutang;</HI>
and after the Ambassadors, at the Request of the Governor, had inform'd him
with all their Transactions at <HI>Peking,</HI> he went back again into the City to ac∣quaint
the <HI>Tutang</HI> therewith: with him went likewise <HI>Iacob de Keyser</HI> (the
other Ambassador being at that time indispos'd) to thank the <HI>Tutang</HI> for the
high Honor he had done them, and to take leave of a Person who had been so
civil to them.</P>
<P>Upon the day following, being the 11. we set Sail again, the Weather pro∣ving
exceeding cold; and upon the 15. we came with all our Vessels to the
most famous City of <HI>Nangan,</HI> where the Ambassadors were Lodg'd in a very
large House on the South-side of the Suburbs; for the Place where they lay
before, the <HI>Tartars</HI> had burnt to the Ground; who since our departure had
march'd through with a flying Army, and committed several Outrages upon
the Inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="82"/>

<P>On the nineteenth of <HI>Ianuary</HI> we departed from thence, and having pass'd
those Waters which were the most dangerous and troublesom, we were now
to Travel some part by Land, to get from <HI>Nangang</HI> to <HI>Namhung:</HI> The Am∣bassadors
were carried in Chairs or Sedans, which they had order'd to be
made at <HI>Nanking,</HI> wherein they were so speedily convey'd over the Mountains
by thirty Soldiers, whom they had hir'd for that purpose, that they came to
<HI>Namhung,</HI> though late that Night, without Lodging on the Mountains, as they
did in coming.</P>
<P>We lay here at a famous House of Entertainment, which belong'd to the
Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton.</HI></P>
<P>I have already given an Account at large of the Situation of this Place,
in the Draught I took thereof in our Voyage to <HI>Peking.</HI> Now in our Re∣turn
I thought it worth the while to make this further Addition, setting be∣fore
you the Prospect of this City on the other side, as exactly as I could
take it.</P>
<P>Having procur'd new Vessels, and put our Goods aboard, we left this
City upon the 21. of the same Month, and passing by several dangerous
Waters, we came to those wonderful and strange Mountains of <HI>Suytieen,</HI> and
from thence to the Hills which we mention'd formerly by the Name of <HI>The
Five Horse Heads.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 25. Instant we got with good success before the City of <HI>Saoche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI>
And here we began to put on our Sails again (which before we durst not
bear) being now past the narrow of the River, and the danger of the Rocks;
and the next day, being the 26. we came to the Mountain <HI>Swanghoab</HI> before
spoken of: And in regard the Water was now at least twenty Foot lower than
when we came, we discover'd here the tops of several dangerous Rocks, which
appear'd very dreadful to us, and made us sensible of the great danger we had
escap'd in our going, they being then unseen.</P>
<P>Upon the same Day, late in the Evening, we came to <HI>Sanyvum,</HI> where we
lodg'd all Night, and early in the Morning set Sail again, and came that day
before the small Town call'd <HI>Xantsui.</HI> We saw here the adjacent Fields full of
Tents, Horses sadled, and a vast number of Soldiers, all standing ready for
the March.</P>

<P>After a few Hours Sailing, we came in sight of the Village <HI>Faesan,</HI> which
appear'd very pleasant and delightful at a distance.</P>
<P>And in regard as we went to <HI>Peking</HI> we pass'd by this Village late in the
Evening, so that there was no taking notice of the same, I thought good (ha∣ving
now in our Return a full view thereof) to give you an Account of its Si∣tuation:
It lies near the River side, being encompass'd with very pleasant
Fields.</P>
<P>Upon the 28. of the same Month we arriv'd again before the famous Chief
City of <HI>Canton,</HI> which we have already describ'd at large. <HI>Francis Lantsman,</HI>
who when we were going to <HI>Peking</HI> took care for all our Concerns left there,
with the two Ships and the rest of the Men, came immediately to welcom and
receive the Ambassadors, and had order'd the Gunners of the Ships to discharge
all their Ordnance upon their Landing, which was accordingly perform'd,
to the great admiration of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Lords, whom the Emperor had appointed
to attend the Ambassadors upon their Voyage for their better accommodation;
who were no less surpriz'd to see such Vessels, having never seen the like. No
sooner were the Ambassadors Landed, but they betook themselves to their
old Lodgings, and found all things safe, and in very good order, to their
great satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Letter of the Emperor writ to the General <HI>Iohn Maatzuyker,</HI> was taken
and carried by the Secretary <HI>Henry Baron</HI> upon both his Hands, having a Skreen
before him; next to him follow'd the Ambassadors, according to the State of
the Business, in solemn Order: And for a more publick demonstration of
Ioy, the Cannons aboard the Ships were discharg'd thrice; the Walls and
Streets of the City were full of People to see the Ceremony, and to under∣stand
the success of their Negotiation; for the Inhabitants desir'd nothing
more than a free Trade with the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>The next day, being the 29. the Ambassadors went in great State to Salute
the Vice-Roys, the young King's Mother, and the <HI>Tutang,</HI> and to acquaint them
with the sum of their Business. The old Vice-Roy receiv'd them very friendly
and heartily, with a Dish of <HI>Thea,</HI> and some Discourse concerning their Voy∣age:
The like did also the young Vice-Roy; but the Mother of the young
Vice-Roy did not appear, only sent a Complement to the Ambassadors, to
<PB N="136" REF="83"/>
thank them for their Visit. The <HI>Tutang</HI> suffer'd them to wait two hours at
his Secretary's House, and afterwards sent them word, That he would hear
them when <HI>Pinxenton</HI> was arriv'd.</P>
<P>The following day, being the 30. of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> the Ambassadors were Treated
by the young Vice-Roy's principal Commander at a noble Banquet, who laid
the fault upon the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Priests at <HI>Peking,</HI> that our Business succeeded no
better there; and he carried it so, as if he had been very much offended with
them, telling us, That they had every where reported, That there were but
three Kings in <HI>Europe,</HI> whereof <HI>Don Iohn</HI> was one; and that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> pos∣sessed
but a small corner of the World, and were his Tributaries; with much
more of this nature.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors went the same day to Salute the Mandorin <HI>Toju,</HI> who re∣ceiv'd
them very courteously, and told them, That <HI>Poetsiensie,</HI> and other Lords,
durst not hold any Conference with them, because the <HI>Tutang,</HI> whom they
stood in awe of, had not yet granted them Audience.</P>
<P>Upon the first of <HI>February,</HI> the Ambassadors, with the Merchant <HI>Lantsman,</HI>
and some other of their Attendants, to the number of twenty Persons, were
most nobly Treated at a Dinner by the old Vice-Roy, who Entertain'd them
first with <HI>Thea</HI> out of woodden Dishes, wishing the Ambassadors to be merry,
and to drink Sorrow from the Heart, since they had now pass'd the greatest
Danger. After drinking of the <HI>Thea,</HI> the Trumpets sounded, and Dinner was
serv'd in: Each Ambassador had a particular Table full of Dishes; but be∣fore
they began to eat, the King call'd for a Gold Goblet full of Wine, and
commanded two of his Gentlemen to carry one to each of the Ambassadors,
and to let them know they were heartily welcom: As soon as they had pledg'd
his Majesty, they fell to their Meat; and whilst they were at Table, the King
ask'd them several Questions concerning the State and Affairs of <HI>Holland.</HI> Din∣ner
being almost ended, several Comedians, according to the Custom of the
Country, began to shew themselves before the King; but the Ambassadors
being in haste, desir'd his Majesty to excuse them from further Attendance;
so after a Health or two had pass'd about, they took leave, and came back to
their Lodgings.</P>
<P>The next day they were Treated by the young Vice-Roy after the same
manner, only there pass'd no Discourse at Table, but what was tending to
Mirth and Iollity.</P>
<P>Upon the third of <HI>February</HI> came <HI>Pinxenton</HI> to <HI>Canton,</HI> with all his Train;
and as soon as the Ambassadors had heard of his Arrival, they went to wel∣com
and Salute him in his Lodgings. On the seventh the Ambassadors (now
<HI>Pinxenton</HI> was come to <HI>Canton)</HI> had Audience of the <HI>Tutang,</HI> who had deferr'd
them till his Arrival.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors having dispos'd of 160099 <HI>Guilders</HI> in Presents for the
Grandees at <HI>Peking,</HI> were somewhat straightned to find wherewithal to pur∣chase
a New-years-gift for the Vice-Roys that might be acceptable unto them;
which at last was obtain'd by the Interest of <HI>Lantsman,</HI> which he had made
during his abode at <HI>Canton:</HI> But when the Presents were brought to the Vice-Roys,
they seem'd dissatisfi'd with them, and demanded not only Interest of
1500 <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver, which they had disbursed for the use of their Servants
upon their departure to <HI>Peking,</HI> but they likewise insisted, That the Ambassa∣dors
should immediately pay the 3500 <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver which they had pro∣mis'd
to the Vice-Roys for a free Trade at <HI>Canton,</HI> before their departure
<FIGURE>
<PB N="137" REF="83"/>
</FIGURE>
for <HI>Peking.</HI> This Business occasion'd much trouble; and at last the Ambas∣sadors
were necessitated to comply with their Demands, to prevent further
mischief; for they found that the Common People had been dealt withal,
to affront them as they went along the Streets: and not long after, one of
our best Interpreters, by Name <HI>Paul Duretti,</HI> was barbarously murder'd in his
own House. Whereupon the Ambassadors resolv'd to depart with all speed
for <HI>Batavia,</HI> and went immediately to take leave of the Vice-Roys, who refus'd
to give them Audience, and only sent out word, That they were not to Ex∣port
any <HI>Tartar</HI> Arms.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors finding they could not effect any thing with their Vi∣sits,
return'd to their Lodgings, and went aboard that Night, and set Sail early
in the Morning; but after a few hours Sailing, the Wind turn'd, and we
were forc'd to come to an Anchor not far from <HI>Canton,</HI> where we lay all Night.</P>
<P>Upon the 23. came the Stewards of the Vice-Roys, and the Captains of the
Guards, with the <HI>Mandorins</HI> who had accompanied the Ambassadors forward
and backward from <HI>Peking,</HI> and Treated them in the name of their Masters
with their strong Liquor <HI>Samsou,</HI> in the Kings own Dishes: They wish'd the
Ambassadors a speedy and successful Voyage, and that they might suddenly
return again; and after some Healths had gone about, they took leave, and
went back to <HI>Canton,</HI> and we immediately hoised Sail, and came upon the 28.
about Sun-set to an Anchor in the Harbor of <HI>Heytamon.</HI> The Ambassadors
had sent the Governor a Princes Flag, which he caus'd to be hung out with
the <HI>Tartar</HI> Standard upon the Fort, as a sign that the Ambassadors were wel∣com
to him.</P>
<P>Upon the second of <HI>March,</HI> about mid-night, we weighed Anchor, and set
Sail with an Easterly Wind from the Harbor of <HI>Heytamon,</HI> steering our Course
South-East. At break of day we came in sight of the famous Village of <HI>Lantam,</HI>
which lies in a very commodious place, adorn'd with goodly Buildings, and
may be seen at a great distance off at Sea. We made so much speed that day,
that before Sun-set we got beyond the Eastern Islands of <HI>Maccao.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the fourth Instant we came in sight of the Northern Mountains of
<HI>Aynam,</HI> which lay about six Miles North-West from us.</P>
<P>On the eighth of the same Month we came again to the Island <HI>Pulo Tymon,</HI>
<FIGURE>
<PB N="138" REF="84"/>
</FIGURE>
where we anchor'd, and sent ashore to know whether any Ships had been
lately there. The Islanders told us, That about a fortnight since there Sail'd
by a <HI>Ionck</HI> for <HI>Batavia,</HI> but they could not tell whence she came. With this
advice we set Sail again, and were no sooner got out to Sea, but we saw whole
shoals of flying Fishes, leaping out of the Water, and sporting themselves in
the Air. These Fishes are commonly of the bigness of a Smelt, and have
Wings like those of Bats; they never swim alone, but keep together in shoals;
as soon as they discover any other sort of Fish that use to make a prey of them,
they take Wing and save themselves: they are not able to continue long
above Water, but must immediately return under Water again. No Creature
either upon the Land or in the Sea suffers greater persecution than these Fishes;
for under Water they are pursu'd by Soals, and other Fish, and have no way
to save themselues but by flight; and they are no sooner out of the Water, but
they are presently set upon by Sea-Fowls; so that they are continually in jeo∣pardy,
either in or out of the Water.</P>
<P>Upon the 21. of <HI>March</HI> we came in sight of the Island <HI>Linga,</HI> situated upon
the Coast of <HI>Sumatra.</HI> Early in the Morning we spy'd a Sail, whereupon we
Mann'd out our Boat to discover what she was, and whence she came; by
whom we understood, That it was our <HI>Bloemandael,</HI> which had lost us by the
way: so we joyn'd together, and steer'd our Course South-west.</P>
<P>Upon the 24. we came into the Streight <HI>Banca,</HI> between the great Island
<HI>Borneo</HI> and <HI>Sumatra;</HI> and upon the 26. we past by the Island <HI>Lucipara,</HI> and so
through the above-mention'd Narrow.</P>
<P>On the last of <HI>March</HI> we arriv'd in our long-desir'd Harbor of <HI>Batavia,</HI> af∣ter
we had spent twenty Months and six Days in this tedious and expensive
Voyage.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors immediately went ashore, to give an Account to the Go∣vernor-General,
and the Council of <HI>India,</HI> of their Transactions in this their
Voyage to and from <HI>Peking;</HI> and to inform them what ill success they had in
their Business with the Emperor there, notwithstanding all their Endeavors,
and the rich Presents they had given, as well to the Emperor himself, as to the
<HI>Mandorins,</HI> and the rest of the Grandees of his Court. The Value of these
Presents amounted in the whole to 5555 <HI>l. 1 s. 7 d. Sterling;</HI> and the Expenses
<PB N="139" REF="84"/>
of our Expedition forward and backward came to 4327 <HI>l. 10 d. Sterling:</HI> which
together amounted to the Sum of 9882 <HI>l. 2 s. 5 d. Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>And for all these Presents, and great trouble of so dangerous and long
Travel, we effected nothing else, but that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were receiv'd as Friends
by the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> and might return eight years hence to Salute his Im∣perial
Majesty, according to the Contents of the foremention'd Letter, which
the <HI>Great Cham</HI> writ to the Governor-General at <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>And though through the means and Designs of the <HI>Portuguese Iesuits,</HI> as has
been often mention'd, our Business did not succeed with the Emperor accord∣ing
to our wish, yet we hope that in a short time, and before the date of eight
years shall be expir'd, something will be done to the advantage of our Traf∣fick,
by sending a few more Presents to the Emperor; which several of the
Grandees of <HI>Peking</HI> did more than hint to our Ambassadors. Beside, the <HI>Great
Cham</HI> having Wars with that Arch-Pyrate <HI>Coxinga,</HI> if we should but propose
to assist his Imperial Majesty with our Ships, for the subduing of the said Py∣rate,
I make no doubt but he would quickly consent to give us a free Trade in
his Dominions.</P>
<P>Amongst so many Alterations hapned since our departure, we understood
at our Arrival, with great joy, that the strong City of <HI>Columbo,</HI> in the Island of
<HI>Ceylon,</HI> was fall'n into our hands, by the Conduct and Courage of the General
<HI>Dirck Hulft,</HI> who Commanded over those Forces that were sent to subdue it.
This valiant Commander was unfortunately slain in an Assault made by
him upon the said City; which being perceiv'd by his couragious Soldiers,
they fell on with so much fury, that they would not be satisfi'd for the loss of
their Commander, with any thing less than the taking of the Town; which
was soon after deliver'd up to them upon terms. How great an advantage
this will prove to the Affairs of the <HI>East-India Company,</HI> any one may easily guess,
if they do but know, that from this Place comes the best Cinamon.</P>
<P>We likewise understood, that the troublesom and contentious Business in
<HI>Amboyna,</HI> which threatned this Place with great danger, was accommodated
and reconcil'd, through the wise management of <HI>Arnold de Vlaming;</HI> so that
one might live freely and peaceably there, and drive their Trade with the In∣habitants
as formerly.</P>
<P>Lastly, We were inform'd, that the <HI>Bantam Iavaners</HI> were grown weary of
the War, and sought to live in Peace with the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> which will highly
make for the Interest of our <HI>East-India Company.</HI></P>
<P>I have treated thus far in short concerning what hapned upon our Travels
forward and backward to the Emperor's Court at <HI>Peking;</HI> wherein, to my
knowledge, I have not in the least said any thing contrary to the Truth: and
as I began in giving a Description in short of the whole Empire, for as much
as concerns the Country it self; so I conceive it not improper, for a more full
and perfect knowledge of all <HI>China,</HI> to continue my Relation of the Govern∣ment,
Letters, Learning, Manners, Customs, Fashions, and Modes of the In∣habitants;
Creatures, Beasts, Herbs, Fruits; Wars, and Peace, in this vast
Dominion of <HI>China.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A
General Description
OF THE
EMPIRE
OF
CHINA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Government and several Chief Officers in China.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>UR Statists in <HI>Europe,</HI> and most else that follow Sci∣ence
and Literature, are not ignorant in the least of
the three Forms of Government, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Mo∣narcy,</HI>
or the absolute Power of a Single Person;
<HI>Aristocracy,</HI> being the Authority of the Nobles; and
<HI>Democracy,</HI> the Sway of the Multitude.</P>
<P>Now the Kingdom or Empire of <HI>China</HI> hath been
Govern'd from Age to Age, in a series or long pre∣scription
of Time out of mind, by a Single Person, the Supreme Authority
being always <HI>Monarchical;</HI> for both the Power of the Nobles and that of the Po∣pulacy
are so altogether unknown to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> that we had a difficult Task
when we were at <HI>Peking,</HI> to make them understand what our Government of
the <HI>United Provinces</HI> was, and what were our <HI>High and Mighty Lords,</HI> the <HI>States
General.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperor of <HI>China</HI> Commands over the Lives and Estates of all his
Subjects, he alone being the Supreme Head and Governor; so that the <HI>Chinese</HI>
Government is absolutely <HI>Monarchical,</HI> the Crown descending from Father to
Son; and for want of Issue-Male it comes to the next of Blood, the eldest Son
first resuming the Paternal Throne; only we read, That two or three Kings
in old Times disinherited their Children, being held unfit to Govern, and put
the Scepter into the Hands of Strangers, no way related to them. It has also
<PB N="142" REF="86"/>
often hapned, that the Subjects have by force wrested the Government out of
the hands of their lawful Prince, for being too severe, harsh, and cruel in his
Reign, and conferr'd it on one more agreeable to their Humor, whom they
have acknowledg'd for their lawful Prince. Yet herein are the <HI>Chineses</HI> to be
commended, that many amongst them had rather die honorably, than sweat
Fidelity to any Prince that gets the Crown by force of Arms, having no just
Title to the same; for they have a Proverb amongst them, <HI>That an honest Wo∣man
cannot Marry two Husbands, nor a faithful Subject serve two Lords.</HI></P>
<P>When the Heir (which generally is the eldest Son) comes to the Crown, the
rest of the Children are Treated with Royal Dignity and Honor; but they
must not use any Regal Authority. The King allots to each of them a City,
with a Royal Palace, where he lives in Princely State, being serv'd and waited
on with extraordinary Pomp and Splendor, but has no Command in the least
over any of the Inhabitants; neither may they depart from that City without
the King's special Licence.</P>
<P>In this Government are found no old Laws, as among those of <HI>Europe;</HI> no
Imperial Edicts, which had their original from the ancient <HI>Romans:</HI> but those
that are the first Founders of their own House, and have by Conquest, or
otherwise, resum'd the Government, make new Statutes according to their
pleasure. This is the reason why the Laws which were in use before this last
Invasion of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and are in part observ'd to this day by the People, are
of no longer standing then the Emperor <HI>Humvuo,</HI> whose Race, for his most
heroick Actions in the Expulsion of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> was call'd <HI>Tamin,</HI> which sig∣nifies
<HI>Great Courage.</HI> This Emperor made several Laws, and confirm'd others
made by his Predecessors.</P>
<P>Their Emperor is commonly call'd <HI>Thiensu,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Son of Hea∣ven;</HI>
and this Name is given him, not that they believe he had his Original
from thence, but because they believe he is better belov'd, by being preferr'd
to so great a Dignity above all other Mortals, for his eminent and natural
Vertues, and because they adore and worship Heaven for the highest Deity;
so that when they name <HI>The Son of Heaven,</HI> 'tis as much as if they said, <HI>The Son
of God.</HI> However, the Commonalty call not the Emperor <HI>Thiensu,</HI> but <HI>Hoangti,
The Yellow Emperor,</HI> or <HI>The Emperor of the Earth;</HI> whom they name <HI>Yellow</HI> of co∣lour,
to distinguish him from <HI>Xangti,</HI> which signifies <HI>The highest Emperor.</HI> Two
thousand six hundred ninety seven years before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, their first Prince
Reign'd, who bore the Name of <HI>Hoangti;</HI> and because of his extraordinary
Vertues, and valiant Deeds, the <HI>Chineses</HI> have ever since call'd their Emperors
<HI>Hoangti.</HI></P>
<P>None are chosen or employ'd in the Government and Management of Pub∣lick
Affairs, but such as are held capable, and have the Title of <HI>Doctors of the
Law,</HI> Men of great Learning and eminent Parts; for whosoever is preferr'd
in <HI>China</HI> to Places and Offices of Trust, has given a clear testimony of his
Knowledge, Prudence, Vertue, and Valour; neither the Favor of the Prince,
or Grandeur of his Friends standing him in any stead, if he be not so extraor∣dinarily
qualifi'd.</P>
<P>All Magistrates, both Civil and Military, are call'd in the Country Idiome,
<HI>Quonfu,</HI> which signifies <HI>Men fit for Council:</HI> They are also call'd sometimes by
the Name of <HI>Lavie,</HI> which signifies <HI>Lord,</HI> or <HI>Master.</HI> The <HI>Portuguese</HI> call these
Magistrates in <HI>China, Mandorins,</HI> it may be from the <HI>Latin</HI> word <HI>Mandando;</HI> by
which Name the Officers of that State in that Country are also receiv'd and
understood by us of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="86"/>
And although I said at the beginning, that the Government of this Kingdom
or Empire consisted of one single Person; yet it will appear by what has been
said, and what shall follow, that the Government has also some Commix∣ture
with that of <HI>Aristocracy:</HI> for although that which the Magistrate con∣cludes,
and fully determines, must afterwards be ratifi'd by the King upon
Request made to him; yet he also finisheth nothing himself in any Business,
before he is thereunto first desir'd by his Council.</P>
<P>It is also very certain, That it is no way lawful for the King to confer any
Office, Dignity, or Place in the Magistracy, upon any, unless he be first re∣quested
by one in special Authority: But yet he hath Power to present his
Courtiers with some special Gifts; and this he often does, according to an old
Custom, <HI>whereby it is free for any one to raise his Friends at his own Charge.</HI></P>
<P>The Publick Taxes, Assessments, Impositions, and Revenues, are not
brought into the King's Treasury; neither may he dispose thereof at his
Pleasure: but they are deliver'd either in Money or Goods into the Treasury
and Granary of the Empire; which Income dischargeth the Expence of the
King's Family, consisting of Wives, Concubines, Sons, Favorites, and the
like.</P>
<P>There are two distinct Councils in <HI>China;</HI> one whereof not only officiates
in Affairs of State at Court, but has likewise the Care of the Kingdom: The
other is made up of Provincial Governors, who Rule particular Provinces
and Cities. A Catalogue of which Officers fills up five or six large Volumes,
Printed every Month, and to be sold at <HI>Peking,</HI> where the Court resides. In
these Books are mention'd only the Names of Provinces and Cities, and the
Qualities of those who for that end are employ'd in the Magistracy through
the whole Empire.</P>
<P>These Books are always re-printing, in regard so vast a number of Altera∣tions
happen daily; for some die, others are laid aside, and new ones cho∣sen
in their Places, or else preferr'd to higher Offices; so that there is hardly
an hour but some Change happens amongst them.</P>
<P>The Grand Council divides it self into six other great ones: The first is
call'd <HI>Pu,</HI> or <HI>The Council of State;</HI> for they nominate and chuse all the Magi∣strates
of the whole Nation: these, as they are most powerful, have also the
greatest Parts, Persons able to judge of whom they confer such Dignities; for
they must be all qualifi'd with Philosophical and other Learning, that come
to any Place in the Magistracy; the general Maxim there being, <HI>To prefer none
but meerly upon Merit;</HI> and whosoever happens to be degraded for any Misde∣meanor,
they never admit him to his Place again.</P>
<P>The second, call'd <HI>Hopu,</HI> hath the Management and Inspection over the
King's Exchequer, pays the Armies, and other Charges of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The third they name <HI>Limpu;</HI> this takes care of the common Offerings,
Temples, Priests, the King's Women, Schools, and publick Places of Learn∣ing,
to see that all things be done in order; likewise orders their Holy-days,
and the Obediences which are to be perform'd to the Emperor, upon certain
Times and Occasions; also disposes and confers Titles of Honor upon such
as deserve them, takes care for the encouragement of Arts and Sciences, send∣ing
and receiving of Ambassadors, and the writing of Letters into all Parts.</P>
<P>The fourth Council is call'd <HI>Pimpu,</HI> or <HI>The Council of War,</HI> to whom is left
the management of Peace and Military Affairs; wherein however they are
not to conclude any thing without the consent of the Emperor. They dispose
<PB N="144" REF="87"/>
of all Places and Offices in the Army, and confer Titles of Honor and Dig∣nities
accordingly upon such as behave themselves bravely in Conduct, and
valiantly in Battel.</P>
<P>The fifth Council, call'd <HI>Cumym,</HI> has the care about Buildings committed to
it; and also appoints Surveyors to look to the Repairs of the Edifices and Pa∣laces
belonging to the Emperor, his Favorites and Magistrates: they also
look after the building of Vessels, and the equipping of Fleets.</P>
<P>The sixth Council, call'd <HI>Humpu,</HI> Examines and Iudges all criminal Causes,
and appoints their Punishments.</P>
<P>All Affairs of the whole Kingdom are dispatch'd by these six Councils;
wherefore they have in each Province and City, Officers and Notaries, by
whom they are inform'd of all Transactions which happen in each Quarter;
so that they are all continually busie about weighty Affairs: but the number
and good order of the Officers very much facilitates their Work; for in each
Council is a President, whom they call <HI>Ciu,</HI> who has two Assistants, one on
his right side, call'd <HI>Coxilam,</HI> and another on his left, term'd <HI>Yeuxilam:</HI> These
three, both at Court, and through the whole Empire, have the highest Dig∣nity,
except those who sit in the supremest Council, call'd <HI>Colao.</HI> Beside these
three Principal Councellors, there are belonging to each Council ten others,
who differ but little in Dignity from the rest, being always employ'd, toge∣ther
with a great number of inferior Officers, as Notaries, Scribes, Secretaries,
and Clerks.</P>
<P>The Iesuit <HI>Semedo,</HI> in his Relation of <HI>China,</HI> mentions several other Coun∣cils,
whereof some have a like Authority with the before-mention'd six; all
which are call'd in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue, <HI>Cien, Cim,</HI> and consist of several Offices,
belonging particularly to the King's Houshold.</P>
<P>The first of these is call'd <HI>Thai Lisu,</HI> that is, <HI>The Council of the great Audite:</HI>
This Office seems like the great Chancery of the Kingdom, and therein all
weighty Affairs receive a determination; it consists of thirteen <HI>Mandorins,</HI> one
Councellor, two Assistants, and ten under-Officers.</P>
<P>The second is call'd <HI>Quon Losu,</HI> and provides for their Imperial Majesties
Tables; and for all the Expences of the Emperor's Court. This Council has
one Councellor, two Assistants, and six Officers.</P>
<P>The third, call'd <HI>Thaipocusu,</HI> has the Power of the Emperor's Stables, and
makes provision of all Post-Horses for publick Use and Service. It consists of
one Councellor, and six Officers.</P>
<P>Beside all these, there is yet another Council higher than all the rest, and of
the greatest Dignity, having Place next the Emperor in all publick Solemni∣ties.
Those that sit in this Council are call'd <HI>Colaos,</HI> being seldom above four
or six in number, and the most select Persons of all the other Councils, and of
the whole Empire, and are honor'd and reverenc'd accordingly. No private
Affairs are brought to them, for they only mind the Publick Good and Go∣vernment,
sitting with the Emperor in private Council; for the above-men∣tion'd
six Councils intermeddle not with the Affoirs of the State, as to make
any Conclusion upon them, they being only to Debate and Consult, and af∣terwards
by way of Petition to offer their Advice to the Emperor, who either
altereth or confirmeth what they have done, according as he sees cause. But
in regard he will not seem wholly to relie upon his own Iudgment, some of
the chiefest Philosophers always attend upon this <HI>Colaos</HI> or Council, and come
daily to the Palace to answer Petitions, which are brought continually to the
<PB N="145" REF="87"/>
Emperor in great numbers. This last Conclusion the Emperor Signeth with
his own Hand, that so afterwards his Command may be Executed.</P>
<P>There are yet two Councils more, whereof the one is call'd <HI>Choli,</HI> and the
other <HI>Tauli,</HI> each consisting of above sixty Persons, all choice Philosophers and
wise Men, whose Fidelity and Prudence both the Emperor and People suffi∣ciently
have approv'd, and therefore they hold them in great honor and
esteem. With these his Majesty adviseth upon all extraordinary and weighty
Affairs, but more especially when any thing has been committed against the
Laws.</P>
<P>Beside these, there are several other Councils, whereof the chiefest is call'd
<HI>Han Lin Yven,</HI> where are employ'd none but Learned Men, who busie them∣selves
with no Affairs of the Government, yet exceed all in Dignity, except
such as sit at the Helm. Their Charge is to take care of the Emperor's Wri∣tings,
to compile Year-Books, and write Laws and Orders. From among
these are chosen Governors and Tutors for the Princes; they only are con∣cern'd
in Matters of Learning, wherein as they grow more and more excellent,
they mount by several Steps to the highest degree of Honor, coming after∣wards
to be employ'd in Places of the greatest Dignity in the Court; neither
is any chosen into the great <HI>Colao,</HI> who hath not first been of this Council.
They delight in Poetry, and get a great deal of Money by their Writings, as in
making of Epitaphs, Poems, and the like, to pleasure their Friends; and very
happy he esteems himself that can obtain such a favour of them.</P>
<P>The Government of the City <HI>Nanking,</HI> where the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors formerly
kept their Courts, is the same with that of <HI>Peking,</HI> save that at <HI>Nanking</HI> the
great Council of the <HI>Colao</HI> is not in being; but the Esteem and Authority of
the rest of the Councils here is as much eclipsed for want of, as at <HI>Peking</HI> 'tis
advanc'd by the Emperor's Presence.</P>
<P>Thus far we have spoken of the Government in general: In the next place
we will treat of particular and Provincial Iurisdictions. The whole Empire
is divided into fifteen Provinces; in the principal Cities whereof the chiefest
and supreme Courts of Iudicature reside, differing little in Method and Rule
from those of <HI>Peking</HI> and <HI>Nanking,</HI> and so not consequently one from another.
The Regiment of each Province is committed to the care and fidelity of two
Persons, whom they call <HI>Pucinsu</HI> and <HI>Manganzasu;</HI> the first whereof inter∣meddles
only with Civil Affairs, and the other is altogether concern'd in Cri∣minal
Matters. They have both their Seats of Iudicature in the Chief Cities of
their Province, and live in great Magnificence, having beside several Officers
assistant unto them, as also the chiefest Magistrates call'd <HI>Tauli;</HI> who in re∣gard
they Command over some other inferior Cities, it often happens that
they are absent from the Metropolis of the Province, to take care of their
Employments.</P>
<P>All the fifteen Provinces, as has been already said, are subdivided into se∣veral
other less Portions, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Fu;</HI> over each of which is
appointed a Governor call'd <HI>Gifu.</HI> These Divisions are again proportion'd
into great and small Cities, the first whereof they call <HI>Ceu,</HI> and the last <HI>Hien:</HI>
each hath a particular Magistrate, which in the great Cities are call'd <HI>Ciceu,</HI>
and in the less are nam'd <HI>Cihien;</HI> for <HI>Ci</HI> signifies <HI>To Govern.</HI> Every Principal
Governor of these Cities is aided by three Councellors, who assist them with
Advice in all their Affairs and Undertakings: The first is call'd <HI>Hun Chim,</HI>
the second <HI>Chu Phu,</HI> and the third <HI>Tun Su,</HI> and have their particular Courts and
<PB N="146" REF="88"/>
Iudicature; but the Governor over the whole Division has no more Autho∣rity
in the Place of his Residence, than in the other Cities under his Com∣mand:
True it is, he may condemn a Malefactor to die; but he cannot put the
Sentence in Execution, without the consent of the rest that are join'd in Com∣mission
with him.</P>
<P>But in regard an Account must be given of the whole management of Af∣fairs,
and the Transactions of all the Provinces, at the Court at <HI>Peking;</HI> there∣fore
in each Province there are appointed two other great Officers by the
Court, who in eminency of Honor, and Grandeur of Commission, exceed the
rest. The one of these always resides in some of the Provinces, and is call'd
<HI>Tutang;</HI> the other is sent yearly from the Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> and call'd <HI>Chayven:</HI>
the first has a superintendent Power over the other Magistrates and Subjects,
Commands the Soldiery, and is concern'd in all the chiefest Offices of the
Empire, by reason whereof he is not inferior to the greatest Vice-Roys in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
either for Power or Pomp. He continues three years in the Employ∣ment,
and all that time has constantly Couriers going to, and coming from
Court; and this because he must daily give an Account of what passes in his
Province. At his first going from Court, several Persons of great Quality
(who also are of his Council) are sent to wait upon him to his Palace: The
Inhabitants of Cities and Towns, through which he passes, go out to meet
him with great Respect, and accompany him good part of his Way, both on
Horse-back and on Foot, with great Honor and Reverence: At length, when
he is arriv'd within three Miles of the Capital City wherein he is to make his
Residence, the Garrison of the Place, excellently accommodated, meet him,
to guard and conduct him; after whom follow the Magistrates, with the
chiefest Citizens.</P>
<P>The Office of the second, call'd <HI>Chayven,</HI> which signifies <HI>An Examiner,</HI> is like∣wise
a Place of great Trust and Command; but (as is said) expires with the
Year. This Officer receives so large a Commission from the Emperor, that
he may supervise and inspect all manner of Affairs, as well Civil as Military;
and this he doth, giving an Account thereof to the Emperor, who thereupon
immediately sends him further Orders what to do therein. He alone, amongst
all the Magistrates, causes the Sentences of Life and Death, and other corporal
Punishments, to be put in Execution through the whole Province; so that
all Persons equally fear and reverence him.</P>
<P>Besides these great Officers of the Emperor, there is another Examiner,
call'd likewise <HI>Tutang;</HI> but he is sent by the Empress from time to time, and
his Business is only to visit the Prisons of the Province, with a full Power to
release all such from them, as have been put in for trivial Matters. He hath a
very great regard to the Poor, his chief Office being to perform Deeds of Cha∣rity,
and extend Compassion.</P>
<P>In every Province is also a Treasurer, who takes care of the Royal Revenues
arising within the whole Province: He receives his Commission from the
<HI>Rix-Council</HI> appointed for the Emperor's Revenue. With him are join'd two
Assistants, who both reside in his Palace: And he has under him twenty six
<HI>Mandorins,</HI> who are employ'd in several Offices: He receives and takes an
Account of all the Tolls, Impositions, and Royal Taxes; takes a special care
of all Weights and Measures, and determines all Causes and Differences that
arise about the Emperor's Revenue: He is the Person that pays all Salaries,
Wages, and Annuities, whether it be to the Magistrates, the Emperor's
<PB N="147" REF="88"/>
Kindred, or Soldiers; and likewise disburses all Moneys to be laid out for
repairing of Bridges, Streets, and common Edifices, such as the Palaces of the
<HI>Mandorins.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth Council is <HI>Gan Cha Sci,</HI> whose Business is to inflict, or pass Sen∣tence
for corporal Punishments.</P>
<P>The fifth-Council takes care to improve and reward Learning and Know∣ledge.</P>
<P>And thus I have given you an Account of the several sorts of <HI>Rix-Councils</HI> in
<HI>China;</HI> but before I conclude with their method of Government, it will be
worth our labor to make some mention of the strange and unusual Customs
us'd amongst them, which other Nations have hardly heard of. And first of
all, it is very observable, That the whole Kingdom is sway'd by Philosophers,
to whom not only the People, but the Grandees of the Court yield an awful
Reverence, insomuch that they submit with all humility to receive Correction
from them, as Children from a Master. By these Philosophers are all Mili∣tary
Affairs order'd, over which they are appointed as Overseers; and their
Counsel and Opinions make greater Impressions upon the Emperor, than all
the most admirable Observations of the Commanders themselves, who are
very seldom, and then but some few, taken into the Council. But that which
will appear yet more strange, is, that these Philosophers far exceed the Mili∣tary
Commanders in Courage and Fidelity, and will hazard their Persons be∣yond
any of them in the most imminent Dangers, for the good of their Prince
and Country.</P>
<P>Secondly, But that which indeed to our <HI>European</HI> World will seem most
admirable, is the Good Understanding and perfect Unanimity which is con∣stantly
held between the High and the Inferior Magistrates; as also between
the Governors of Provinces, and the Rix-Councils, and between those and
the Emperor himself; declar'd by that mutual Respect and Affection which
they bear to one another, in making Visits, and sending Presents upon all
occasions for the continuation of this so well knit Correspondence: and yet
notwithstanding this constant and strict Amity, the inferior Magistrates never
speak to the chief Ministers of State but upon their Knees, and that with sin∣gular
Civility, and profound Respect. With like Respect and submissive Car∣riage
the Subjects behave themselves to the Governors and Rulers of Cities.</P>
<P>Thirdly, No Person continues in Office through the whole Empire, longer
than three years, unless he be confirm'd anew by the Emperor; which hap∣pens
very seldom, because, as every Man merits by his upright Carriage
and Deportment, he is still advanc'd to higher and more noble Promotions.
And certainly this is done upon great and Political Reasons of State, as to
prevent any such Governor from contracting near Friendship with the Inhabi∣tants,
whereby to draw their Affections to a by-Interest on his part, to under∣take
Factions or Novelties against the Interest of the Prince. For the better
bringing to pass whereof, all the chief Governors of Provinces, Divisions, and
Cities, are bound to appear every third year at the Emperor's Court, to do
Homage and Obedience to him; at which time a strict Account is taken of
their Carriages and Behaviours in their several Places: and after a through
Examination of all Matters, the Emperor and his Council determine who are
fit to be continu'd, who to be cashier'd, who to be preferr'd, and lastly, who
to be punish'd; and this without any respect of Persons. Likewise, it is not
in the power of the Emperor to make any alteration in what is concluded by
<PB N="148" REF="89"/>
the Council and Iudges upon this Examination, which is so severe and impar∣tial,
that for the most part only the greatest Persons offending are punish'd.
And to this purpose we read, that in the Year 1607. so strict an Examination
was made, that four thousand principal Magistrates, who had misbehav'd
themselves, receiv'd Rewards justly due to their demerits.</P>
<P>The Persons so condemn'd are divided according to the quality of their
Crimes, into five Ranks: Under the first are comprehended such as take
Bribes, and enrich themselves out of the Emperor's Treasury; these being
turn'd out, are for ever made incapable of bearing any publick Office. Under
the second Rank are set down those who are too cruel in their Punishments;
these are likewise turn'd out of their Places, and sent home to live as private
Persons. Under the third are reckon'd such as are decrepit, and too far stric∣ken
in years for Government, or else such as are too remiss in their Offices;
these, though they are put by the Exercise of their Offices, yet enjoy all their
Privileges as they were wont when they were in their Places, so long as they
live. In the fourth Rank are put down such as have been too hasty and rash in
passing Sentence, acting without any forecast in the Affairs of the Empire;
these are degraded, and put in some inferior Offices, or else employ'd else∣where
upon less weighty Affairs. In the last place, all such as live impru∣dently,
and unbecoming the greatness of their Station and Employment, are
not only depriv'd of their Places, but also of their Liberties and Privileges for
ever. The like general Inquisition and Examination is made every twelfth
Year amongst the <HI>Rix-Councils,</HI> as also amongst the Military Officers.</P>
<P>Besides, the <HI>Mandorins</HI> and Assistants are oblig'd once a day to give an Ac∣count
to the Governor of their City, of their own and other Persons Transacti∣ons
under their Iurisdictions, as also what has past either in City or Country;
and if they forbear to give notice of any thing that tends to the prejudice of
the State, which afterwards comes to be known, they are most severely pu∣nish'd,
without any delay, or respect of their Persons; an instance whereof
hapned at <HI>Canton</HI> when we were there, the old Vice-Roy causing one of the
chief <HI>Mandorins</HI> to be kill'd in his Presence for such a Crime, and would not de∣lay
the expiation of the Criminal's Offence by his Blood so long, till the Exe∣cutioner
could be fetch'd to behead the Offender, according to the Custom of
the Country.</P>
<P>Fourthly, None may in the Province where he was born take upon him
the Office of a Magistrate, but is admitted to be a Field-Commander; the rea∣son
whereof may be, lest he who sits in the Place of Iustice should favor his
Relations; but the Soldier being at home in his own Country, will Fight
<HI>pro Aris &amp; Focis,</HI> and the more valiantly defend it. The Sons of such as are
Magistrates, are not permitted to go much abroad, that so they may not be
corrupted with Bribes.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The <HI>Chineses</HI> will not suffer any Stranger to continue in their Coun∣try,
who has an intention to return home into his own native Soil, or is found
to hold any Correspondence with forein Kingdoms; neither is a Foreiner
permitted to come into the heart of the Empire: And this is the cause that
no Stranger dares venture into <HI>China,</HI> otherwise than under the pretence of an
Embassy; which is not only to be understood of such as are far distant from
<HI>China,</HI> but also of their Friends, Allies, and Tributaries, who pay Taxes to
them; of which sort are the neighboring Islanders of <HI>Corea,</HI> who for the most
part observe the <HI>Chinese</HI> Laws; and if they discover a Foreiner to have liv'd
<PB N="149" REF="89"/>
privately in <HI>China,</HI> they restrain him from returning into his own Country,
upon pain of death.</P>
<P>Sixthly, No body is suffer'd to wear any Arms within a City, nor the Sol∣diers
nor Commanders, nor the Learned Philosophers, unless they are upon
the March, and going to the Wars. Neither are any suffer'd to have Arms in
their Houses, or to ride Arm'd, otherwise than with a Dagger to defend them∣selves
against High-way-men.</P>
<P>In this Empire all Magisterial Officers whatever, whether Philosophical,
or of the Council of War, are rank'd into nine Orders; according to which
each has a monthly Allowance paid him, either in Money or Rice out of the
Publick Revenue; which in regard of the State and Garb they live in, is not
sufficient to defray the Charge and Expence they are at; for those of the
highest Order, have but a thousand Crowns yearly, yet some of them grow to
be very rich Men, but certainly not by what is given them under-hand for
Courtesies done, notwithstanding all the Examinations aforesaid.</P>
<P>All the Magistrates, as well superior as inferior, wear for a Badge and
Mark of Respect and Dignity, one sort and fashion of Hat, which none else
is suffer'd to wear: These Hats or Bonnets are made of black Silk, and have
on both sides two oval Flaps which cover the Ears, and are made fast to the
Bonnet that they cannot fall off: In which manner and Garb when they ap∣pear
in the Streets, they walk with great gravity, not differing from each
other in the rest of their Habit, save only that they have distinguishing Marks
upon their Clothes, whereby their Qualities are known to the Inhabitants, and
to what Order they belong.</P>
<P>Lastly, you must know that the <HI>Chineses,</HI> though the <HI>Tartars</HI> have made them∣selves
Masters of this Empire, yet sit every where in the Councils; they en∣joy
their old Laws, Customs, and Privileges as formerly; and it seems the
<HI>Tartars</HI> suffer this, in regard they find the <HI>Chineses</HI> have more understanding, and
are better vers'd in Governing the Country and People than themselves; who
on the other hand are fitter for War, and more able by force to Conquer, than
by Policy to Rule Kingdoms.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Characters, Language, Writing, and Literature of the
Chineses: And in what manner the Learned in China arrive to
the several Degrees of Knowledge.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> manner of Writing differs very much from the Language
they speak; for there is not one Book in all <HI>China</HI> which is writ in
their Mother-Tongue. All the Words in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language,
without exception, are Monasyllables: neither have they fewer Letters than
Words; for each Letter is with them a Word: and though there be some
<HI>Chinese</HI> Words which comprehend several Letters, yet every one of those Let∣ters
signifies a particular Word.</P>
<P>And although the <HI>Chineses</HI> have as many Characters as Business, yet they
are so skilful in joyning them, that they make about seventy or eighty thou∣sand;
but about the certain number Writers seem to differ. The <HI>Iesuit
Athanasius Kircher</HI> reckons them eighty thousand, in all which they must be
<PB N="150" REF="90"/>
knowing and expert, who will aim at the highest Degree of Learning; al∣though
any one that knows but ten thousand of them, may perfectly un∣derstand
the Language, and be able to write their Characters. <HI>M. Martinus,</HI> in
his Prologue to the History of <HI>China,</HI> says, That the <HI>Chineses</HI> have above sixty
thousand Characters, which have several distinctions and significations. This
is confirm'd my <HI>Mandelslo</HI> in his <HI>Persian</HI> Voyage, though others raise the num∣ber
to One hundred and twenty thousand; and which is worth observation,
notwithstanding this almost infinite variety and difficulty, yet such is their di∣ligence
and industry, that all these words are found in a large Dictionary
call'd <HI>Holpien,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Sea.</HI> Of this so great difference in the num∣ber
of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Letters no other reason can be given, but that the original
number hath been increas'd from time to time.</P>
<P>For the better understanding the method of the <HI>Chineses</HI> Writing, I conceive
it not amiss to declare more plainly the form and difference of these their so
varying Characters.</P>
<P>And to that end and purpose, in the first place you are to take notice, That
the old <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters or Letters differ very much from those in present use:
for at first the <HI>Chineses</HI> characteriz'd their meaning in a kind of hierogly phick
shape, as of four-footed Beasts, creeping Creatures, Fishes, Herbs, Boughs of
Trees, Ropes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were variously made and contriv'd, as the Fancy
of the User thought meet: But after-Ages, by a long series of time, and a
constant practical use thereof, finding a great confusion in such a vast number
of differing Creatures and Herbs, imitating the form of some of the Ancients
in their Characters, made or added some little Points and Lines about them,
to distinguish them one from another, and by that means reduc'd them into
better order, and a less number, and those are the Letters they use at present.</P>
<P>Of the old <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, there are to be seen seventeen sorts: The
first and most ancient was invented by the Emperor <HI>Tohias,</HI> and compos'd of
Dragons and Snakes, most strangely interwoven one within another, and cast
into several forms. For this reason the Book which the same Emperor <HI>Tohias</HI>
writ of <HI>Astrology,</HI> is call'd <HI>The Book of Dragons;</HI> but at this time those Chara∣cters
are quite worn out of use in the Countrey. The second sort is fram'd
out of several things belonging to Husbandry, and us'd by the <HI>Chinese</HI> Empe∣ror
<HI>Xinnung</HI> in all Treatises concerning Tillage. The third sort consists of
the several parts of the Bird <HI>Fumhoan,</HI> and was invented by the Emperor <HI>Xan∣hoan,</HI>
who has likewise writ a particular Book of Birds in these Characters▪
The fourth sort of old Characters is compil'd out of Oysters, and small
Worms. The fifth, of several sorts of Roots of Herbs; and in this kind of
form the ancient <HI>Chineses</HI> have writ several Books. The sixth sort is drawn from
the Claws of Cocks and Hens, and other Fowl, and invented by King <HI>Choam.</HI>
The seventh is compos'd of Tortoise-shells, and had for their first Founder
the Emperor <HI>Yoo.</HI> The eighth is shewn in small Birds and Parrots. The ninth▪
in Herbs and Birds. The tenth is of <HI>Co,</HI> invented only for a token of remem∣brance.
The eleventh is of Stars. The twelfth, of several other Letters, ser∣ving
for Privileges and Immunities. To the thirteenth belong the Letters <HI>Yeu,
Can, Chi, Cien, Tao.</HI> The Characters of the fourteenth sort are call'd the Letters
of Rest, Mirth, Knowledge, Darkness, and Clearness. The fifteenth sort is of
Fishes. The sixteenth sort is not yet known to us in <HI>Europe,</HI> nor indeed to any
besides themselves, and not to all them neither. The seventeenth sort is us'd
in sealing up of Letters, and writing of Superscriptions.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="90"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>That the Reader may more clearly understand the matter, I will set down
some of the old Characters, with those now in use.</P>
<P>As for Example, the Character number'd with the Figure 1. signifi'd with
the ancient <HI>Chineses,</HI> a Mountain or Hill; at present as the number 2. does ex∣press.
The Sun was demonstrated formerly by a round Circle or Ring, with
a Speck in the middle, as the number 3. declares; but now it is express'd as in
number 4. A Dragon was formerly depicted with the Figure, as is express'd in
number 5. but now as it is by the Figure, number 6. A Scepter with one Eye,
as is express'd in number 7. signifi'd formerly the King's Name, but now it is
shewn with the Figure, as in number 8. A Bird, Hen, or Cock, were formerly
express'd in full shape and posture, as is mention'd in the numbers 9. and 11.
but at present those Creatures are describ'd as in number 10. and 12.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Chineses</HI> at present use no more such Characters to express the form
of any such things, but only some certain Lines and Marks, which however
different in form, in some sort obscurely resemble the Characters of the An∣cients,
which represented the shape of things. For a clearer demonstration of
the Character in use at present among the <HI>Chineses,</HI> I have thought good to in∣sert
one of the Figures, mark'd with the Letter <HI>M.</HI></P>
<P>Out of nine several Lines or Marks the <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters of these Times
are compos'd, so that by adding or omitting of one Line or Mark, another sig∣nification
properly arises; for example, a straight Line, as by the Figure <HI>a</HI> up∣on
the left side of this Print, signifies <HI>One,</HI> or <HI>The First;</HI> with a Line drawn
through it, as at <HI>b,</HI> denotes <HI>Ten;</HI> and with a Line underneath it, as at <HI>c,</HI> it signi∣fies
<HI>Earth;</HI> with another put over the down-right Line, as the Figure <HI>d,</HI> it
speaks <HI>King;</HI> with a Point on the right side, as by the Figure <HI>e,</HI> it signifies
<HI>A Pearl;</HI> but such a Point on the left side, as at Figure <HI>f,</HI> signifies <HI>To Live;</HI>
Lastly, with a Point upon the head of it, as at Figure <HI>g,</HI> it signifies <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now though all the Subjects of the Empire use several Characters in their
Language, yet in speaking there seems to be little or no difference in them, all
their words sounding alike, notwithstanding the difference of form and signi∣fication
in Writing; and this is the reason that there is no Language which
has so many double-meaning words as the <HI>Chinese,</HI> being only distinguish'd by
some sound or expression in use amongst themselves. Out of the double sig∣nification
<PB N="152" REF="91"/>
of these words there arises a great Inconvenience; for no Person
can transcribe any thing out of that Language which is read unto him, nor
can any Book be understood by hearing another read it, because the double
meaning and various sound of the words cannot be distinguish'd by the Ear,
and are only to be known by the sight, or not otherwise to be understood; so
that it often happens in common Discourse, that they are necessitated to put
their Minds in Writing, else one cannot understand the other what he means,
though he speaks very clear and plain. This double meaning is in some sort
taken away by five several sounds now in use, which yet are very hard to be
distinguish'd; so that many times very great mistakes happen between those
that have not been us'd to these sounds from the very Cradle. An <HI>Italian</HI> tel∣ling
a <HI>Chinese, That in</HI> Europe <HI>there were Ships to be seen as big as Mountains,</HI> he gave
the word wherewith he would have denoted <HI>A Ship,</HI> the same sound that ex∣presses
<HI>A Tyle upon the House.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> taking it according to the sound,
seem'd to admire very much his Saying, and at length began to laugh at him,
as though he had told them incredible things; asking him withal, <HI>To what use
they put a Tyle of such bigness?</HI> and saying, <HI>That it must have been a very large Oven
that could bake such a Tyle.</HI> By which appears how necessary it is, and withal
how infinitely troublesom it is both to Strangers and Natives to learn these
differences of Sounds and Pronunciations, or to be ignorant of them. The
<HI>Iesuits</HI> therefore who are sent to propagate the <HI>Gospel</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> have found out
five Points of five Marks, which they put over every word, and thereby know
how to express the highness or lowness of the Sounds; which are as follow:
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> By the help of these Marks must the same word which is writ∣ten
in our Letters, and mark'd with these Marks, be severally pronounced,
and then they intend several things. As for Example, <HI>Y'a</HI> with this Mark ouer
it signifies <HI>God;</HI> and with this Mark over it, <HI>Yá, A Wall;</HI> and <HI>Yà</HI> with this Mark
signifies <HI>Dumbness.</HI> Yet notwithstanding all these Helps, the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language
is very difficult to be learn'd and understood, as well in regard of the double
signification of the words, as also because that in this Language there is no
certain number of Letters, but every Business and Intention of the Mind must
be express'd by a particular Character; which gives not only an infinite
trouble to those that will learn it, but causes a vast expence of time, taking up
ten or twenty years before a man can attain to the Art of speaking and writing
this mysterious Language, wherein the Natives themselves know far better
how to express their Minds in writing, than by speaking.</P>
<P>But in regard I have now spoken of the Character and Writing of the <HI>Chi∣neses,</HI>
I will add in a few Words in what manner they place them: And herein
they quite differ from the Custom of <HI>Europe,</HI> and almost all other Nations.
Hereof <HI>Peter Iarcius</HI> thus, in his <HI>Treasury of Indian Things: The</HI> Chineses (says
he) <HI>do not write from the left hand to the right, as the</HI> Europeans; <HI>nor from the right
to the left, as the</HI> Hebreans: <HI>but they begin from the right side above, and write down
to the bottom; so that they put the one Character under the other, and not one after ano∣ther,
as we in</HI> Europe: <HI>And when the Line is full from top to bottom, then they begin
again at the top of another Line, and by degrees go down again to the bottom.</HI> And in∣deed
(which is worth observation in this Particular) the <HI>Chinese</HI> differ from
all others, who absolutely write after another manner; for at this day there
are in all the known World but four several ways of Writing, upon the Ac∣count
of placing the Letters: The first is from the right to the left side, and
in this manner are written the Books of the <HI>Hebreans, Chaldeans, Syrians, Ara∣bians,</HI>

and <HI>Aegyptians.</HI> The second is from the left to the right side; and after
this manner the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Books are writ, and so write at present all
the People of <HI>Europe.</HI> The third sort of Writing is in the <HI>Greek</HI> call'd <HI>Bustro∣phedon,</HI>
which signifies <HI>to Plough with Oxen;</HI> and this manner of Writing is done
just as the Oxen make Furrows with the Plow, namely, to begin the second
Line where the first ended: This way of Writing (as <HI>Pausanius</HI> relates) was
us'd by the ancient <HI>Grecians;</HI> and so (as is reported) were writ the Laws of
<HI>Solon.</HI> The fourth and last way of Writing is from the top to the bottom;
and this manner of Writing, as has been said, the <HI>Chineses</HI> use, and some of
the Salvage <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>But although this manner of Writing (whereby each thing is express'd by
a particular Character) is very burdensom to the Memory, yet it is of very
great use and advantage to the People, who differ very much in Language
from each other; for hereby they are able to read the Books and Letters of each
other (if they use common Characters in Writing) though the one doth in
no wise understand the other in speaking. And in this manner it is that those
of <HI>Iapan, Corea, Couchen-China,</HI> use one and the same Books, though they differ
so very much in the Pronunciation, that one cannot understand a Word the
other says; yet they bear the same sence to the understanding of the most
indifferent Reader, no otherwise skill'd than in the vulgar Idiom of his Mo∣ther-Tongue:
And which is yet more of wonder, that although the several
Natives in the Empire of <HI>China</HI> differ infinitely each from other in their seve∣ral
Dialects, so that their varying of Languages makes them seem as Stran∣gers
among themselves, their Tongues being useless Members to their Inte∣lect;
yet in their Books one General Character is us'd, so that the same are
equally intelligible throughout the whole Empire.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the great Confusion of Languages in the several Provin∣ces,
as is before declar'd, there is yet through the whole Empire another
Common Tongue, by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Quinhoa,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Court or
Mandorin Chinese;</HI> and this at first took its rise from the Magistrates, or <HI>Mando∣rins</HI>
residing in the respective Provinces, whereto they were sent with a Su∣perintendent
Authority; for coming thither as Strangers, and esteeming it
below their Greatness to be necessitated to learn any other Tongue, this C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urt∣ly
<HI>Mandorin</HI> Language was introduc'd through the whole Empire, wherein
not onely all Affairs relating to the Laws are dispatch'd, but likewise all Per∣sons
of Rank or Quality use the same; so that it is as common, and as
much in use with them, as <HI>Latin</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> or <HI>Lingua Franca</HI> among the <HI>Turks;</HI>
and this is the Language that Strangers, Merchants, and others learn, when
they come into those Parts.</P>
<P>This Court-speech, though it exceeds all the others for number of Letters,
yet it consists of no more than 362 Words; so that the shortness or concise∣ness
of this Courtly or more Modish manner of speaking, makes it flow so
pleasantly from the Tongue, that it passes for sweet Elocution, almost all other
Languages yet known: As for Example, When we will express the manner
of taking a thing, either with the whole Hand, or with one or two Fingers;
we are enforc'd to add the word <HI>Take;</HI> but the <HI>Chineses</HI> do express the same
quite otherwise: for each Substantive, as a <HI>Cup</HI> or <HI>Pot,</HI> signifies the thing to be
done, as likewise the manner of doing it. Thus <HI>Nien</HI> signifies to take with two
Fingers, <HI>Tzo</HI> with one, and <HI>Chua</HI> with the whole Hand. The same is likewise
observ'd in the word <HI>Stand;</HI> we say, <HI>To stand in the House, to stand Eating, to stand
<PB N="154" REF="92"/>
Sleeping;</HI> but they have a Word which denotes the Infinitive Verb <HI>To Stand,</HI>
and the manner of standing. So likewise when we will express the Leg of a
Man, or of a Bird, we always add the same word <HI>Leg;</HI> but the <HI>Chineses</HI> ex∣press
it all in one: for <HI>Kio</HI> is a Man's Leg, <HI>Chua</HI> a Birds, and <HI>Thi</HI> the Foot of
any Creature.</P>
<P>Amongst all the several noble Arts and Sciences wherewith the <HI>Europeans</HI>
are enobled, the <HI>Chineses</HI> have only some insight into that of Philosophy; for
the knowledge of natural things is much more obscur'd among them by seve∣ral
interpos'd Errors, than any ways enlightned.</P>
<P>The greatest Philosopher of all that Nation, was one <HI>Confutius,</HI> born four
hundred and fifty one years before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Incarnation, and liv'd in such a
manner for above seventy years, that not only by Example, but also by his
Writings and Conversation, he stirr'd up all others to imitate him in a ver∣tuous
and orderly Course of Life; whereby he gain'd so great an Esteem
amongst the People, that they believ'd him to have far exceeded in Vertue,
Learning, and Integrity, all other Mortals that ever liv'd upon the face of
the Earth: And certainly, if his Works, which are extant in <HI>Chinese</HI> Books,
were minded with a due regard, Men must acknowledge him to have been a
Person of great Learning and Vertue: In respect whereof the <HI>Chineses</HI> have to
this day so great an opinion of his Name, that whatsoever he has writ is ne∣ver
call'd in question, but by all maintain'd for good, having gain'd to it self
the authority of <HI>Ipse Dixit</HI> in the Schools. And not only the Learned, but the
Kings also have ever since his Death perpetuated his Memory, and recorded
his Name in their <HI>Annals,</HI> as a Reward of the Vertue and Learning they re∣ceiv'd
from him: And such of his Posterity as yet remain, are to this day
highly respected by all, and not without reason: for the Emperors of <HI>China</HI>
have Enobled the Heirs of the Family with great Titles of Honor, and exem∣pted
them from paying any Publick Taxes or Impositions.</P>
<P>Nor doth the Knowledge of the <HI>Chineses</HI> end here; for they are great Pro∣ficients,
in the Art of <HI>Astrology,</HI> and in several other Arts and Sciences; as also
heretofore in that of <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> in the understanding whereof they have of
late years much decay'd, insomuch that now the Shop-keepers use Boards to
tell upon, which are full of Holes; yet they are so ready at it, that with a
Peg they know how to cast up an Accompt with as much Method and Expe∣dition,
as the most skilful <HI>European</HI> with Counters. In the division of the He∣misphere,
Stars, and Constellations therein, they differ very much from us of
<HI>Europe,</HI> having added to their number more than are known to the most criti∣cal
of our modern Astronomers. The Star-gazers are chiefly employ'd in
prognosticating the time of the Suns Eclipses, and to observe the various
Course of the Planetary Motions. But herein they are like themselves and
Brethren in the same Art, full of Errors and Mistakes; as also in their Astro∣logical
Observations, Calculating of Nativities, Horary Questions, or the
like; concerning good or bad Fortunes in their Lives, as well as present Suc∣cesses
in their Emergent Occasions; together with the Fruitfulness and Bar∣renness
of the ensuing Year: for they take it as a main Article of their Be∣lief,
That all things which happen here upon Earth, depend upon the Influ∣ences
of the Stars, and are directed and order'd by the various Signatures of
their several Configurations.</P>
<P>Of this Fortune-telling Part of the Art of Astrology, <HI>Trigautius</HI> the <HI>Iesuit</HI>
gives this following Account in his <HI>History of China.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="92"/>
The present Emperor of <HI>China</HI> has strictly forbidden this kind of Learning to
all but such who have a Right by Inheritance, or are otherwise appointed and cho∣sen
thereunto: And this Prohibition at first sprung from fear lest any having ob∣tained
to the exact knowledge of that Art, should by pretence thereof have an op∣portunity
to erect any Novelty in the Empire. Yet that the Art, and the Masters
of the same, may not seem to be utterly lost or neglected, the said Emperor maintains
several Star-gazers, at a very great Charge, for his own use; and they are of two
sorts, namely, the <HI>Celubden,</HI> who live within the King's Palace, and the <HI>Imperi∣al
Magistrates,</HI> who live without. Both these have at present at <HI>Peking</HI> two Ben∣ches,
the one entituled <HI>The Bench of the Chineses,</HI> which is employ'd about
making of Almanacks and Prognostications, the Suns and Moons Eclipses: The other
is of the <HI>Saraceners,</HI> whose Studies tend to the same things, and are Methodiz'd
according to the Grounds and Rules of the Western Astrology. After a time the
Iudgments of both these Benches are compar'd together, and any difference or mistake
of either, or both, is then rectified. Both these Societies have a convenient Mansi∣on
provided for them, upon a very high Hill, that they may the better view the
Stars, and raise Observations from the same. Several old Astrological Instruments,
made of Copper or Brass, are kept in this Place: Every Night one of the Profes∣sion
remains here, to observe whether any new Star appear in the Firmament, which
might fore-tell some Novelty; and if any such thing happen, he immediately gives
notice thereof to the Society, and they communicate the same to the Emperor, and con∣sult
with him what it may p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtend, and how relate to good or evil. <HI>And this is
the Office or Duty of the Astrologers at</HI> Peking.</P>
<P>As to Physick and Chirurgery, they are very expert therein, and their
Rules of Art differ not much from those of our <HI>European</HI> Physicians: for
first, they feel the Pulse like them, and are very skilful in discovering by the
same the inward Distempers of the Body: in each Hand they take notice of
six distinct beatings of the same, namely, three high, and three low, which,
as they conceive, have some secret Coherences with certain Parts of the Bo∣dy;
as that of the first, to the Heart; of the second, to the Liver; of the
the third, to the Stomach; of the fourth, to the Spleen; of the fifth, to the
Reins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore that they may with the greater certainty of Iudg∣ment
deliver their Opinions, they are at least half an hour in feeling the Pulse
of the sick Person.</P>
<P>When by the Pulse they have found out the Distemper, then in order to
the curing of the Patient, they apply and make use of several Simples and
Roots; to say the truth, they are generally very well experienc'd in the
knowledge of the several Vertues of all kinds of Herbs growing among them.
And this is observable, that there are no Schools in all <HI>China</HI> for the learning
of Physick, but every Master of Family teaches his Servant. And true it is,
that although in both the Imperial Cities of <HI>Peking</HI> and <HI>Nanking,</HI> the Degree
of Doctor of Physick is not granted but after Examination; yet this Degree,
when obtain'd, doth advance neither the Honor or Respect of the Person.
And for this reason it is probable, that few or none Study Physick but the
meaner sort of People, because the very Profession thereof (which is so ho∣norable
in other Places) is there is no esteem, nor adds the least Reputation
to him that gains it.</P>
<P>But it is quite otherwise with such as Study Philosophy; for whosoever
hath attain'd to the Perfection thereof, is by them accounted to have arriv'd
at the highest pitch of humane Happiness attainable in this World.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="93"/>
The above-mention'd <HI>Confutius,</HI> the Prince of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Philosophers, has
collected into order all the Writings of the Ancients in that kind, and con∣tracted
them into four great Books, to which he added a fifth of his own:
In which Volumes are taught Rules Oeconomical and Political, as well the
way to Live as to Govern well; as also the ancient Examples, Manners, Of∣ferings,
and several Poems of ancient Authors. But beside these five, there is
another great Volume writ by some of the Disciples of <HI>Confutius,</HI> and is divi∣ded
into four Parts, and call'd <HI>The Four Books.</HI> The last Volume, thus subdi∣vided,
treats of the same Subject with those other five: And these nine Books
are all that are to be found in <HI>China</HI> amongst the Booksellers, out of which all
others are compos'd: And certainly therein are contain'd most excellent Rules
and Directions for the well ordering of all Civil Affairs, and such as have pro∣ved
to the very great advantage of the Empire of <HI>China.</HI> For which cause a
Law was made by the ancient Kings, <HI>That whosoever would be a Learned Man, or
so reputed, must extract the principal Ground-work of his Learning from these Books:</HI>
Nor is it enough to understand the true meaning and sense of the same; but
he must likewise get them by heart, and be able to repeat a considerable part
thereof, if he will be thought to have arriv'd at an eminent pitch of Learn∣ing.</P>
<P>There are no Publick Schools in all <HI>China</HI> (though some Writers have erro∣neously
told us the contrary) but every Person chuses his own Master, by
whom he is taught in his House, at his own Charge. And in regard of the
great difficulty in Teaching the <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, in respect of their vast num∣ber
and variety, it is impossible for one to teach many several Persons; and
therefore every Master of a Family takes an Instructer into his House, for his
Children, of whom, if there be two or three to learn, they are as many as
one Tutor can well teach.</P>
<P>All such as are found upon Examination to have made good Progress in
Philosophy, arise to Promotions by three Degrees of Learning: The first
is call'd <HI>Sieucai,</HI> the second <HI>Kiugin,</HI> the third <HI>Cinfu.</HI></P>
<P>The first Degree of Learning, call'd <HI>Sieucai,</HI> is given in every City by a
certain Eminent Learned Person, appointed by the Emperor for that pur∣pose,
and according to his Office bears the Name of <HI>Tihio.</HI> This <HI>Tihio</HI> goes a
Circuit through all the Towns of his Province, on purpose to Promote
Learned Men to this Degree: As soon as he is come into any City, he makes
known his arrival, whereupon all such as stand for this Preferment address
themselves unto him to be examined; and if he find them qualified, he im∣mediately
prefers them to this first Step of Learning: and that their Worth
may be taken notice of, for a particular Badge of their Dignity they wear a
Gown, Bonnet, and Boots, in which Habit none are permitted to go, but
such as are in this manner become Graduates. They enjoy likewise several
Honorable Privileges and Immunities, and are preferr'd to considerable
Employments in the Government.</P>
<P>The second Degree of Honor to which the Learned <HI>Chineses</HI> are preferr'd,
is call'd <HI>Kiugin,</HI> which is given with much more State than the former, and is
conferr'd only upon such as they judge to be most deserving; and this Pro∣motion
is made but once in three years, and perform'd after this manner:</P>
<P>In each Capital City is a great and well-built Palace, encompass'd with
high Walls, and set apart only for the Examination of the Scholars. In this
Place are several Apartments and Mansions for the use of Examiners, when
<PB N="157" REF="93"/>
they come to Supervise the Scholars Works. Beside these Apartments, there
are at least a thousand Cells in the middle of the Palace, but so small, that
they will only contain only one Person, a little Table, and a Bench: In these
no one can speak to his Neighbor, nor be seen by him.</P>
<P>When the King's Examiners are arriv'd in the City, they are lock'd up
apart in this Palace, and not suffer'd to Discourse with any whatsoever while
they are there. When the time of Examination is come, to which are ap∣pointed
three whole days, namely, the ninth, twelfth, and fifteenth Days of
the eighth Month; then are the Writings of the Scholars with great Iudg∣ment
narrowly Examin'd, and several Questions propounded to be resolv'd
by them.</P>
<P>The third Degree is call'd <HI>Cinsu,</HI> and is equal with that of Doctor of Divi∣nity,
Law, or Physick in <HI>Europe;</HI> and this is conferr'd likewise every third
year, and to them only in the Imperial City of <HI>Peking.</HI> To this Honor can
only three hundred out of the whole Empire arrive, and the Examination
of them before they are chosen, is perform'd by the King's Examiners in the
same Method and State as the former. And such as attain to this heighth of
Honor by their Learning, are preferr'd to the highest Places of Dignity in the
Empire, and are had in great Esteem and Reputation by the People.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of several Chinese Handicraft-Trades, Comedians, Iuglers, and
Beggers.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Chineses</HI> are not altogether without some Experience and Skill in
Architecture, although for neatness and polite Curiosity, their Build∣ing
is not to be compar'd with that in <HI>Europe;</HI> neither are their Edi∣fices
so costly or durable, in regard they proportion their Houses to the short∣ness
of Life, building as they say, for themselves, not for others: And this
surely is one reason why the <HI>Chineses</HI> cannot comprehend nor imagine the costly
and Princely Palaces which are in <HI>Europe;</HI> and when they have been told, that
some of the said Edifices have stood for many Ages, they seem as it were ama∣zed
thereat: But if they consider'd the true Reasons of such continuance,
they would rather applaud and imitate, than wonder; for that which makes
our Building last so long, is, because we make deep Foundations; whereas in
<HI>China</HI> they dig no Foundations at all, but lay the Stones even with the surface
of the Ground, upon which they build high and heavy Towers; and by this
means they soon decay, and require daily Reparations: Neither is this all;
for the Houses in <HI>China</HI> are for the most part built of Wood, or rest upon wood∣den
Pillars; yet they are cover'd with Tyles, as in <HI>Europe,</HI> and are contriv'd
commodiously within, though not beautiful to the Eye without; however,
by the curiosity of the People, they are kept very clean and neat.</P>
<P>Their Temples are most curiously built, some whereof in solitary places
near the High-ways, to the great accommodation of Travellers. They are
hung full of Images, and heavy Lamps, which burn continually, in memory
of one or other that liv'd well, and died happily.</P>
<P>These People have made no small progress in several Sciences, by their early
being acquainted with the Art of <HI>Printing:</HI> for though those of <HI>Europe</HI> do there∣in
<PB N="158" REF="94"/>
exceed the <HI>Chineses,</HI> having reduc'd the same to more exactness and certain
Method; yet says <HI>Trigautius,</HI> in the fourth Chapter of his first Book, <HI>The use of
the Printing-Press was much sooner in</HI> China <HI>than in</HI> Europe; <HI>for it is most certain,
that the same has been in use amongst the</HI> Chineses <HI>for five Ages past; nay, some stick
not to affirm, that they us'd</HI> Printing <HI>before the Birth of</HI> Christ. <HI>Mercator,</HI> in his
great <HI>Atlas</HI> writes, <HI>That the Printing-Press, and the use of Cannon, are of so great
Antiquity in</HI> China, <HI>that it is not known who was the Inventor of them.</HI> All which, if
it were taken for granted, yet nevertheless they are too large in saying, That
That <HI>Printing</HI> has been us'd by them ever since their Country hath been call'd
the Empire or Kingdom of <HI>China.</HI> But how ancient soever it is, they use quite
another manner and method therein than the <HI>Europeans:</HI> for in regard of the
great number of Characters, they are enforc'd to cut them upon a smooth
Board, made of Pear-tree or Apple-tree. Upon this Board they paste the Wri∣ting
that is to be Printed, scraping the Paper so long when it is dry, till the
Characters, by reason of the thinness, begin to appear through; and last of
all, they bore the Board with an Iron, that only the strokes of the Characters
are left standing: This done, they Print with this Board the Writing, which
stands already Engraven upon it, upon other clean Sheets, but with so much
ease and quickness, that one Man is able to Print five thousand Sheets in a day;
and in the boring of the Boards they are so dextrous, that they will cut out
one almost as soon as an <HI>European</HI> Compositor can make ready a Form to the
Press. This manner of Printing is much more commodious for the <HI>Chinese</HI>
Characters than for ours, theirs being great in substance and form, our Letters
small, and consequently unfit to cut upon a Board.</P>
<P>Neither doth this Peoples Ingenuity end here, but dives into the quaint
Fancies of the Painter's Art, arriving sometimes to great skill in Painting of
Pictures; only herein they fall very much short of those who use that Art in
these Parts, in regard they neither understand the making of Shadows, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have learn'd to temper their Colours with Oyl. This is the reason why all
their Pictures look so dull and dead, resembling rather inanimate Bodies, than
lively Images; and yet they have as good Colours in that Country, as in any
other part of the World, wherewith they depict all sorts of Birds and Herbs
to the life.</P>
<P>They have also some little insight and skill in the Art of Carving or Gra∣ving
of Images, and in Casting of Copper into the Portraicture of Birds, and
all manner of other Creatures, with which they adorn the Cielings of their
Houses; their Temples are likewise beautifi'd with Images of Copper, or
other Pieces of Carv'd or Engrav'd Works. Their Bells, which for the most
part are made of Brass, have woodden Clappers; for they cannot bear the
striking of an Iron one, by reason of their brittleness; so that for sound, they
fall infinitely short of the <HI>European</HI> Tuneableness. Why these People, who are
ingenious and witty enough in other things, are so dull and unexperienc'd
in these, proceeds in all probability from their general averseness to deal with
Foreigners; it being a Rule among them, to prohibit them entrance into their
Country, at leastwise not to admit them farther then Frontires.</P>
<P>Several sorts of Musical Instruments are to be seen in <HI>China,</HI> the most where∣of
are loud Musick or Wind Instruments, to all which they use Snares made
of Raw Silk; but they have neither Organs nor Harpsechords, nor any other
the like Instruments, though there be some that have a great resemblance of
our Virginals in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="94"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Their Vocal musick consists of one Note and Tone as it were; for they
know not how to alter or raise their Voices higher or lower, nor is it in use
amongst them; notwithstanding which, they brag very much of their sweet
Voices; which happly to their Ears, accustom'd thereto, may seem pleasant;
but sure I am, to ours they are both harsh and untunable.</P>
<P>They have very few Dyals, or Iustruments to shew the Hour of the Day;
and such as they have, are made to operate by the means of Water or Fire:
Those which shew the Hour with Water, bear a kind of resemblance to some
great Hour-glasses for their shape; but such as shew the Hour by means of
Fire, are made of perfum'd Ashes. They have some other kinds of Instru∣ments
amongst them, to know the Hour of the Day by, somewhat like our
Clocks with Wheels; and they are made to turn with Sand, as Wheels of
Mills with Water; but they are not to be compar'd to our Clocks in <HI>Europe,</HI>
for they seldom go true. Some inkling they seem to have of Sun-Dials; but
they are ignorant, and desire not to be inform'd in the use of them.</P>
<P>They are very much addicted to Shews and Stage-Plays; and herein only
do they exceed those of <HI>Europe.</HI> Their Comedians are for the most part
young and active, and very numerous throughout the whole Empire; some
of them travel from Place to Place, and others resort to the Chiefest Cities
and Towns, to be employ'd at Weddings, and other great and solemn En∣tertainments.</P>
<P>The Comedies which they Act are either Satyrical or Comical; but true
Relations of the present Times, or new Inventions of their own Fancies, to
make the People merry: and the greatest part of them boast Antiquity;
for although it be <HI>facile inventis addere,</HI> yet they seldom add to, or refine what
is old, much less invent any thing new. And by this means they are al∣ways
in a readiness to act their Plays, whensoever, or how oft soever they
are desir'd by any Company; for the better satisfaction of whom, they al∣ways
carry about them a Book, wherein the Names of their Plays are writ∣ten,
of which, when they are call'd out by any Persons, which frequently
happens at times of Publick Feasting, they Play all the while Dinner lasts,
which is sometimes seven or eight Hours, in which time their manner of
Acting is such, that nothing therein proves tedious to the Company; the
<FIGURE>
<PB N="160" REF="95"/>
</FIGURE>
cause whereof may seem to be, for that one Play is no sooner done, but they
begin another; all their Actions being various, attended with their Singing
Parts, and using strange expressions to amuse the People.</P>
<P>There are likewise a great number of Iuglers and Hocus-Pocusses, who
are very dexterous in their way: Some of them have Rats and Mice in a
Cage, fastned to a Chain, which they have taught to Dance in several Po∣stures:
Others thrust Threds into their Eyes, and pull them out at their No∣ses.
One I saw creep into a narrow Basket, while his Camerade ran thereat
with his Sword so fiercely, that he pierc'd it through; whereupon the Blood
ran down, as if the Fellow therein had been wounded in several Places; but
immediately coming forth, it was evident he had receiv'd no hurt at all.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>China</HI> are great Lovers of Seals and Coats of Arms, where∣with
they not only Seal their Letters, but make Impressions upon all manner
of Writings, Verses, Pictures, and other things. But upon these Seals is no
Device, as among the Gentry and Nobility of <HI>Europe,</HI> neither any thing besides
the Name, Sir-name, Degree, and Quality of the Proprietor; and to make
the Impression, they neither use Wax, nor any thing like it, but only colour
it with a certain red Paint; to which end the chief Persons in <HI>China</HI> have a
Box of these Seals always standing upon a Table, upon which are Engraven
several Names, every <HI>Chinese</HI> appropriating to himself divers Denominations.
These Sigils or Signets are either Engraven in the best and richest sort of
Wood, or else in Marble, Ebony, Copper, Crystal, or the like; for the per∣forming
thereof, there are several Engravers very skilful in this Art, who are
much respected by the People among whom they carry the repute of Learned
Men.</P>
<P>There are not in this Country any swarming of Writers; but such as do
write are esteem'd Artists of the best qualification. Their Ink is made of cer∣tain
hard Cakes, which when they will make use of, they rub upon a smooth
Marble Stone, with a few drops of Water, till the Colour comes off, into
which they dip their writing Pencils, being made of Hair, and fairly appro∣priated
to the writing of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters; and the making of these
Pencils, but especially of the Ink, is amongst all there reputed a particular and
ingenious Calling.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="95"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Other Handicraft-Trades there are in <HI>China,</HI> among which the Fan-maker
is not of least use and credit. These Fans are of such general use to cool the
Face in the heat of Summer, that no Person, of what Degree soever, goes
abroad without them: And of these there are several sorts, some being made
of Reed or Wood, others of Ivory, Ebony, Silk, Paper, or perfum'd Straw;
nor is their variety greater in substance, than their difference in fashion; for
some are round, others four-square, <HI>&amp;c:</HI> Such as are worn by the Grandees,
are made of white Paper gilt, to open and shut at pleasure; with one of which
it is customary among them to Present each other, as a token of Love and
Friendship. These Fan-makers also as aforesaid, are employ'd much in the
making of <HI>Quittesoles,</HI> which are a kind of folding Canopies; carried over the
Heads of the Grandees by their Servants, being made of the same Stuff with
Fans, and Lin'd with Silk or Linnen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ruffians</HI> Travel through all parts of the Country with Women in their
Companies, and where by chance they find any handsom young Maids
amongst the common sort of People, they use all art and means to entice them
away, neither sparing Money or good Words; whom if they prevail upon to
follow them, they afterwards teach to Dance and Sing, so making them fitter
for the Entertainment of their Hectoring Blades, and wild Gallants. When
they are thus instructed, the Male-Bawds endeavor to sell them, either to the
Grandees out-right, or else to prostitute them for Money for a certain num∣ber
of days, which turns to a considerable advantage; for every of these Bro∣kers
for impudence, have several Women that belong unto them, according
as their ability is able to afford them a Maintenance: They seldom stay long
in a Place, but go from Town to Town, and there residing longest where they
can meet with the best Markets. Whosoever hires one of these Women for a
Nights Lodging, must receive her in the publick manner hereafter described,
<HI>viz.</HI> She is set upon an Ass, and so conducted with a Hood over her Face to the
House of him that sent for her; and when she is come to his House, she casts
aside her Hood, and then he receives and conducts her into the House.</P>
<P>The Beggars here are generally not only bold, but troublesom; for they
ask with great importunity, yea, and often times threaten such as refuse to give
them: They are for the most part very ill featur'd and mis-shapen Creatures,
<FIGURE>
<PB N="162" REF="96"/>
</FIGURE>
for not one of hundred but is mangled or deform'd in some part of his
Body; whereof the Natives give this reason: That these Lazars take their
Children in their Infancy, and break their Arms and Legs, or otherwise de∣form
them, that so they may grow up in a mis-shapen form, on purpose to
become fit to be bred up in their way of Begging. Besides these enforc'd De∣formities▪
they are many times full of running Sores, that the very sight of
them is enough to breed a loathing in the most setled Stomach: And all this
misery is done and suffer'd by them on purpose, to stir up some pity and com∣miseration
in such as pass by. Some there are that appear outwardly sound
of Body; but such use another Art in Begging, which is, to knock their
Heads together like distracted Persons, so that Spectators would believe that
their Brains were ready to flie out, or themselves to fall down dead on the
Ground; for such is their customary Humor, that they will never cease
beating till they have prevail'd with you to bestow something upon them.
There is likewise another sort, who in stead of knocking their Heads toge∣ther,
as aforesaid, strike their Foreheads so hard upon a round Stone four
Fingers thick, which lies upon the Ground, that it makes the Earth seem
to rebound with the blows; by means whereof many of them have contracted
such terrible Swellings upon their Foreheads, that they can never be cur'd of
them.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Yellow River</HI> a certain Armorer shew'd himself to us, coming Abroad
our Barque from a small <HI>Chinese</HI> Boat call'd <HI>Tsiapam,</HI> which is an open Boat,
flat before, and with a little Mast in the middle. This Armorer sat quite na∣ked,
only a Cloth cover'd his Privities, and drivell'd like a Man possess'd with
some evil Spirit; and to make himself appear the more dreadful, he had run
a sharp Dart through one of his Cheeks, which made him look with a Coun∣tenance
full of terror. He carried likewise two sharp Darts in his Hands,
wherewith he threatned either to wound or kill himself if nothing was given
him. Next to him sat one of the Country Priests, who had a Book in his
Hand, wherein he said every Person that gave him something was to write
his Name; but the Ambassador's refus'd so to do. There were some <HI>Tartars</HI>
with us, who all appear'd to be afraid; but some of them were so very much
frighted, that their Hair stood an end at the sight of such an extraordinary
<FIGURE>
<PB N="163" REF="96"/>
</FIGURE>
mad Creature; and (whether out of fear or folly it matters not) they gave
him several Presents, that they might have good Weather, and a speedy
and safe Passage: at which simplicity of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> some of our Com∣pany
could not forbear laughing, and departed away without giving him any
thing, saying, <HI>That they feared God, but not the Devil; and would have nothing to
do with his Adherents.</HI></P>
<P>There is also another sort of Beggars here, who set fire to a combustible
kind of Stuff upon their Heads, which they suffer to burn there with such ex∣cessive
pain and torment, till they have extorted some Charity from the tran∣sient
Company with their howling and crying, enduring very great misery
all that while.</P>
<P>And lastly, Upon every publick Market-day there are to be seen whole
Troops of blind Beggars in the several Cities and Towns, who beat them∣selves
upon their naked Breasts most furiously with great round Stones, till
the very Blood drops from them.</P>
<P>Besides what is mention'd before, there are several other Trades in <HI>China,</HI>
as the Baking of <HI>Porcelane,</HI> or <HI>China</HI>-Ware; the Gumming and Painting of
Chests, Trunks, and Boxes; as also the Weaving of Carpents, Damasks,
Cottons, and several other Stuffs, which I have thought fit to omit in this
Chapter: First, in regard the same are already mention'd in the first part of
our Relation; and also because the <HI>Chineses</HI> do so infinitely abound in all
manner of Arts and Handicraft-Trades, that it would take up too much time
to give a particular Account of the whole.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding this abundance of Trades in <HI>China,</HI> a great Defect and
Abuse is observ'd in most of the Commodities which are made there, and
it is this, that they only appear and seem fair to the Eye, but are really for
the most part very sleight; and for this cause they may well be afforded much
cheaper to the Merchant.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some strange Customs, Fashions, and Manners, in use amongst the
Chineses.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancient <HI>Chineses,</HI> call'd their Kingdom or Empire in old Times by
the Name of <HI>Courtesie</HI> or <HI>Civility,</HI> and other known Manners; yea,
and which is more, Civility or Courtesie is held with them for one
of the five principal Vertues; amongst which, as chief, all others are com∣prehended.
The nature of this Vertue consists, as they say, in the shewing of
mutual respect: Now to be compleat herein, and to be Masters of Ceremony,
they spend no small time to accomplish themselves; yet some of them of a
higher Speculation, viewing humane Vicissitudes, lament themselves that
they cannot reject and shun these Complemental Formalities, although they
do therein far exceed those of <HI>Europe.</HI> Wherefore in this Chapter I shall shew
in what manner they Salute one another when they meet, and afterwards
Treat of some other Manners and Customs in use amongst them, wherein
they differ from others, or amongst themselves.</P>
<P>It is held for no point of Civility amongst the <HI>Chineses</HI> to take off the Hat,
or to make Legs, as it is usually term'd, much le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to embrace any Person, or
kiss his Hand, or make any outward shew of Complement. The most gene∣ral
and common way with them of shewing Civility, is done after this man∣ner:
They carry their Hands when they walk (unless they are to Fan them∣selves,
or otherwise to use them) always folded together in the Sleeve of their
upper Garment, which is made for that purpose; so that when they meet,
they raise their Hands on high in the Sleeve with great Devotion, and then
let them fall again after the same manner, Greeting each other with the word
<HI>Cin,</HI> which signifies <HI>Nothing.</HI></P>
<P>When one comes to visit another, or if two Friends meet in the Street,
they bow (with their Hands in their Sleeves all the while) the whole Body,
and their Heads three times to the Ground; and this manner of Salutation is
call'd <HI>Zoye.</HI> In the performing of which Ceremony the Inferior always gives
place to his Better, and the Party visited gives the upper Hand to him that
makes the Visit: But in the Northern Parts of <HI>China</HI> the Visitant is plac'd on
the left-hand: Oftentimes also, after they have done bowing, they exchange
Places, and go off from the left to the right-hand, and from the right to the
left; which is done for this reason, that so the Party that is receiv'd in the
highest Place should shew some Respect to the other again. When this Cere∣mony
happens to be in the Street, both Parties turn themselves side to side to∣ward
the North, and within Doors to the upper end of the Hall; for it is an
old Custom amongst them, to lay the Threshold of the Palaces, Temples and
other Edifices, to the South; so that in regard this Ceremony is perform'd
in the Hall next to the Threshold, they turn their Faces to the upper end, and
and then they look toward the North. If so be both Parties meeting or visit∣ing
have not seen one another in a long time, or perhaps never before, and
have a desire to bestow extraordinary Civilities upon each other, then after
performance of the first Ceremony, they fall upon their Knees, touching the
Ground with their Foreheads; and this they do three times together. But
when this Civility is to be shown by an Inferior to a Superior, a Child to his
<PB N="165" REF="97"/>
Parent, or a Subject to his Prince, he receives the Honor done unto him either
sitting or standing, and only bowling a little when the other falls upon his
Knees. With the same, and no greater Reverence and Honor they pay their
Religious Duties to their Gods and Images, as well at home in their Houses, as
in their Churches before the Altars. Moreover, if a Master speak to his Ser∣vant,
he stands next to him; but when he gives an Answer, he falls upon his
Knees.</P>
<P>They use likewise several particular Forms and Methods both in Writing
and Speaking: for in Speech they never use the second Person <HI>Thou;</HI> neither
when they speak of themselves must they ever use their Proper Names, unless
the Master speaks to his Servant, or a Superior to his Inferior. In their Dis∣course
with their Betters they have several forms of Speech, by which, toge∣ther
with their submiss Behavior, the Reverence they give them is known:
Amongst which the courtly and polite modish way of Speaking, is never to
mention himself but in the third Person, as not <HI>I,</HI> but <HI>He,</HI> or <HI>Such a one;</HI> where∣as
we in <HI>Europe</HI> use the word <HI>I,</HI> or Pronoun in the first Person: and whate∣ver
a Man's Reputation may otherwise be, yet he is never thought, or thinks
himself to have attain'd the Pinacles of Honor, wanting the most accurate
ways both of Speaking and Writing.</P>
<P>When any makes a Visit, the Party visited is oblig'd in convenient times to
make a return of the like Civility, <HI>modo &amp; forma.</HI> Also when they send
Presents, (which is very frequent) they write them down in a Book, with the
Name of him to whom they are Presented, which are either receiv'd, or civilly
sent back with a Complement: And if they are accepted, he Enters their Re∣ceipt
likewise, and makes a Return accordingly, which he also Registers. It
is also very common there for Presents to be made in Money, though not so
usual with us in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Such as are preferr'd to any Place in the Magistracy, or have attain'd to be
Learn'd in the several Arts and Sciences, put on distinct Habits when they go a
Visiting, each according to his Place and Degree; and hereby he is known, al∣though
it differs not much from his daily Habit. And according to this Or∣der,
such as are not Learn'd, nor of the Magistracy, but yet are Persons of Qua∣lity,
put on a distinct Habit when they make Visits, which however differing
little from the ordinary Garb, is satisfactory to him that is visited, whereas the
contrary is ill resented. And for this reason the <HI>Iesuits</HI> in those Parts, in point
of prudence, Habit themselves in other than their common Vestments, when
they are to Confer with the Grandees about any Affairs.</P>
<P>If several Persons are visited in one House, the chief among them places the
Chairs in the best part of the Room, wiping the Dust off with his Hand, though
made never so clean before; then he invites his Friends that came to see him
to sit down, and taking a Chair (seeming to wipe off the Dust) seats himself:
The Visitors being thus plac'd, presently after comes one of the Houshold
Servants in a long Gown, bearing in his Hand a very next Board, fill'd with
Cups of <HI>Cia,</HI> or Liquor made of Beans (of which I have already made mention)
in each a piece of Bisket, and a little Silver Spoon, lying by as a Nicety. The
Servant Presents to each his Cup, but to him first that sits uppermost, and so
going till he comes at last to his Master, who sits at the lower end of the
Room, and then <HI>exits:</HI> If they continue any time together, the Servant re∣turns
and fills the Cups the second, third, and fourth time, and a fresh piece of
Bisket is put every time into each Cup.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="98"/>
The Entertainment being in this manner ended, they take leave of each
other after the usual manner, with bowing and lifting up of Hands, and be∣ing
attended by the Master of the House to the Door, there again they bid
farewel, for the last time, after the same manner: And now upon their de∣parture
the Master is very importunate with them to see them in their Chairs,
or on Horseback, as they came; but they civilly excuse it, and desire him to
return into his House: Hereupon he goes back to the Threshold, and there
again bows and lifts up his Hands, to which the Guests make a sutable Return;
and thus they part, without any other kind of Complement or Ceremony:
It may be as they are riding away he will suddenly come again to the Door,
and perform the last Complement, in using the word <HI>Cin,</HI> putting up his
Hands on high, and then down again; in all which Actions the same Return
is made by the Guests, who, notwithstanding these Formalities of Courtesie,
make no stop nor halt by the Way: Last of all, he sends his Servant to see
how they got home, and to Salute them in his Name; and this is likewise
done by the Guests, who send their Servants to return him Thanks.</P>
<P>Thus far we have treated after what manner the <HI>Chineses</HI> Salute, Visit, and
sends Presents to each other. Now we will speak of their more solemn En∣tertainments,
wherein they are much concern'd; for they dispatch most of
their Business and Transactions at Feastings and Topings, (not only such as
live a well order'd and more private Life, but the very Priests themselves) and
count the greatness of the Friendship, by the value of the Entertainment of
their Friends; and these indeed may rather and more truly be stil'd Drinking.
Meals, according to the ancient Custom of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> than Eating-Meals;
for though they sip but a little at a time, yet they sip often, and that for seve∣ral
Hours together.</P>
<P>They neither use Spoons, Forks, nor Knives at their Meat, but round Sticks
about half a Foot long, like our Drum-sticks, wherewith they are very dex∣terous
to take up Meat, and put it into their Mouths, without once touching
it with their Fingers. These Sticks are made of Ebony, or other hard Wood,
and tipp'd at the end with Gold or Silver. But here you are to take notice,
that all forts of Flesh are brought to the Table hasht, cut in small pieces.
They drink their Liquors, which are generally made of Beans, <HI>Zia,</HI> or Water,
boiling hot in the heat of Summer, Wine only excepted, which is drunk as it
is naturally: and they find by experience, that such hot Liquors are very
good and comfortable for the Stomach, being very great Cordials, and much
strengthening the inward Parts; and to these Means they attribute their long
Lives and Healths, being very brisk and lively at seventy or eighty years of
Age. And indeed by this means I conceive the <HI>Chineses</HI> are preserv'd from the
Stone in the Bladder, wherewith a very great part of the People of <HI>Europe</HI> are
very much afflicted, and which divers Learned Men have believ'd to proceed
from no other Cause than their continual drinking of cool Drink.</P>
<P>When any Person is invited to a great Entertainment, the Inviter sends to
his Guest, two or three days before, a Book, wherein is contain'd, beside the
Inviter's own Name, the usual Form of Salutation in few words; then is
declar'd, That he is preparing a Feast of green Herbs, and has rinsed his
Bowls to Entertain them at such a Time and Hour, which commonly is in
the Night; and therefore doth entreat him to do him the favor to give him
a Meeting. On the outside of the same Schedule is fix'd a piece of red Paper,
upon which is written the chiefest Names or Attributes of the Guests, (for, as
<PB N="167" REF="98"/>
we said before every <HI>Chinese</HI> has several Denominations) with their Titles and
Dignities; and in the same manner is ever individual Person invited. In the
Morning of the Feast-day the Guests are again all sent to, with a further En∣treaty,
not to fail to meet him at the time appointed. Lastly, an hour before
the Entertainment he sends the third time, which (as they say) is only done
out of civility, to conduct the Guests to his House: whereinto being receiv'd,
and having perform'd the usual Complements of Salutation, they are requested
to sit down in the first Hall, where they are Entertain'd with the Bean-Liquor,
or <HI>Cia;</HI> that perform'd, they are conducted into the principal Room of En∣tertainment,
which is richly adorn'd and furnish'd, not with Carpets, as
among those of the East, (for they are not in use here) but with Pictures,
Flowers, Dishes, and the like Houshold-stuff: Each Guest is seated apart at
a four-square Table, well furnish'd with Dishes upon Chairs, laid over with
Gold in a most rich manner, in several Shapes and Figures. Before they sit
down, the Master of the House takes a Bowl in his Hand of Gold or Silver,
fill'd with Wine, and Salutes therewith those that are to sit uppermost, in the
usual manner of bowing and holding up his Hands; which done, he goes out
into the Court-yard, where first bowing, he offers up the Bowl, with his Face
turn'd to the South, and pours out the Wine as a Libation upon the Ground:
then bowing the second time, he returns into the Dining-room, takes another
Bowl, and Salutes him that is to sit at the upper end, bowing to him but once
only, and then leading him by the Hand, places him at the Table which
stands in the middle of the Room; then invites the rest to sit down after the
same manner: When all the Company is seated, the chief Guest receives a
Bowl full of Wine from the Servant of the House, and drinks to the rest of the
Guests, and to the Master of the Feast; whereupon they all bow in manner
as aforesaid. And here observe, That the Table of the Inviter stands in the
lowest part of the Hall; but with his Face he looks upon the chiefest Table,
where he sits that is accounted the prime Guest of the Feast.</P>
<P>And in regard the <HI>Chineses</HI> do not touch the Meat with their Fingers, they
neither wash their Hands either before or after Dinner. During the Repast,
the Master of the House often calls for a Bowl of Wine, and drinking thereof,
invites his Guests to pledge him, who likewise call for Wine to do him reason
at the same time. They make several small Draughts before they empty their
Cups, after the manner of Drinking in <HI>Holland;</HI> and this is duly observ'd, as
well when they drink Water as Wine; for whatever the Liquor be, they do
but sip it off by degrees, never Potations, as we say Pottle-deep.</P>
<P>Whilst the first Glass is passing about, Meat is brought to the Table; then
the Master of the Feast performing the usual Ceremonies of bowing and put∣ting
his Sticks into the Dish, they all begin to fall to, and take two or three
bits of a Dish, being the most they eat of one: all the Company hold their
Sticks in their Hands till the chief Guest has first laid down his, and when that
is done, the Servants fill into every ones Bowl fresh Wine; then they all
drink, having first bow'd to one another. The greatest part of the time they
squander away rather in drinking than eating; and so long as the Meal lasts,
which is generally protracted to a great length, they use no other than merry
Discourses, or else have Plays or Musick to exhilarate and revive their Spirits.</P>
<P>At these Feasts the Tables are generally furnish'd with such Meats as are
eaten in <HI>Europe;</HI> and though they cannot Cook them with <HI>European</HI> Curiosity,
yet they know how to dress them to please the Palate: neither are the Dishes
<PB N="168" REF="99"/>
cramm'd full, but of each sort a Modicum is only brought to the Table; so
that the Magnificence of a Feast in <HI>China</HI> consists in the multiplicity and man∣ner
of Dishes of several sorts, with which they always fill the Table.</P>
<P>The <HI>Epicurean</HI> fashion of dressing Fish and Flesh at a Meal, is in use with
them, as in <HI>Europe;</HI> but herein they greatly differ, for after once a Dish of Meat
is brought to the Table, it is not taken away till the Dinner is ended, so that
they pile up the Dishes one upon another, that the Table in a manner resem∣bles
a Castle. No Bread is set before the Guests at these great Feasts, nor Rice,
which they use in stead of Bread, only at some ordinary Dinners perhaps they
do, but then it is only at the end of the Meal; and if at any time Rice is
brought to the Table, they eat of that before they drink any Wine. Neither
are their Feasts lengthned out only by Eating and Drinking, for the Guests
play at several Games, whereat whosoever loses, is oblig'd to drink. And this
Custom is observ'd with so great delight by the whole Company, that they
laugh and clap their Hands for joy.</P>
<P>After the Treatment is ended, they generally ply the Bowls with Wine;
yet no Person is forc'd to drink more than he pleases: and though all their
Cups are equal in bigness, they never pressingly urge one another to Pledge.
The Wine they drink is Brew'd or Boyl'd as our Beer, but is not at all
heady; yet nevertheless, such as drink too great a quantity of it, will find
its strength so operate upon them, that here and there one may be heard of
that hath been drunk with this Wine, which has one good quality, sufficient
to encourage Ebriety, that it does not make the Head ake the next Morning,
like the Wine of <HI>Europe.</HI> Notwithstanding all that hath hitherto been said,
these People are very moderate in eating; for they always rise from the
Table with an Appetite, so that is no marvel why they eat so often, as five
or six times a day: but they never eat of the same Dish a second time, what∣ever
is left being given to the Servants.</P>
<P>Most of these great Invitations or Feastings are made in the Night, and con∣tinue
very frequently till late next Morning.</P>
<P>The ordinary or daily Meals are made by the <HI>Chineses</HI> very early; for they
have an Opinion, That if they should fast till Noon, some Misfortune would
befal them that day. They are not curious in their Diet; for they eat all
manner of Flesh without difference, as well that of a Horse, as of an Ox.
They are great Lovers of Swines Flesh, which they praise as the most delici∣ous
of any, and prefer before all other Meat: But the more ordinary sort
of People will feed upon any Carrion, either of a Horse, Mule, Ass, Dog,
or any other Creature. They are likewise greatly delighted with dried
Sweet-meats, which they know very well how to order. The <HI>Mandorins</HI>
have always Comedians to Act, and Musick to Play, whilst they are at Din∣ner,
to excite them to chearfulness.</P>
<P>Their ordinary Drink is Hot Water, wherein <HI>Thea</HI> has been steep'd, which
(as they do all other Liquors) they sip off warm. But the best of their Li∣quors
is that which they call <HI>Cia,</HI> and is made after this manner: They take
half a handful of the Herb <HI>Cha,</HI> and boil it in Spring-water; when it is well
boil'd, they put to it four times as much New Milk, with a little Salt. This
Liquor drunk warm, as they generally believe, has more vertue than the
Philosophers Stone.</P>
<P>As to the rest of their Civilities, Manners, and Fashions, they consist
chiefly in the Honor, Duty, and Obedience which is shewn to the Emperor:
<PB N="169" REF="99"/>
and that is extraordinary; for he is Obey'd, Honor'd, and Serv'd more than
any Spiritual or Temporal Prince in the whole World beside. No Person,
of what Condition or Quality soever, may speak to him, but only the <HI>Gelub∣den,</HI>
who wait upon him in his Chamber in the Palace, and his nearest Kinred,
as his Sons and Daughters that live with him in the same Palace. All the Ma∣gistrates
without the Palace (for the <HI>Gelubden</HI> have their Degrees of Orders
and Preferment) are only to speak to the King in Writing, in the manner
of a Petition, wherein their Desires are set forth with the most humble Ex∣pressions
imaginable.</P>
<P>When it is the new Year, (which always begins with the new Moon be∣fore
or after the ninth Month of <HI>October,</HI> at which time also they begin their
<HI>Lent)</HI> an Ambassador is sent from every general Province to Salute the King.
This Duty is perform'd every third year with greater State, and such humble
Submission, that it seems in a manner a servile Obedience.</P>
<P>So upon the first day of the new Moon the Magistrates, every one in his
own City, meet, and bow to the Royal Throne, which is adorn'd with Pi∣ctures
and Images; then with exalted Voices pray, That the King may live
ten thousand years; and this is loudly seconded by the redoubled Echoes of
the People purposely met together. The same Honor is done to the Emperor
upon his Birth-day through the whole Empire; and upon the same day the
Magistrates of <HI>Peking,</HI> and the Ambassadors which are sent from other Pro∣vinces,
as also the Emperors nearest and chiefest Friends, come into the Em∣peror's
Presence, to let him know what Day it is, and to confirm their good
Wishes for his long Life, by the greatness of the Presents which they then
bring unto him.</P>
<P>All such as are preferr'd by the King to any Place of Magistracy, or other
Office, are summon'd to appear early in the Morning before the King's
Throne, to return Thanks for the favor shewn: At which time they are
Cloth'd in red Sattin, with Silver-gilt <HI>Turbants</HI> upon their Heads; in both
Hands they hold an Ebony Board four Fingers broad, and a Foot long, which
they put before their Mouths as often as they speak before the Emperor or
his Throne.</P>
<P>When formerly the Emperor intended to appear upon his Throne, he
shew'd himself first out of a large Window, in the highest Room of the House,
holding an Ebony Board in his Hand before his Face, and another over his
Head; both which Boards were beset with so many Precious Stones, and of
that bigness, that they cover'd his Face, and hindred any one from having a
perfect sight of him: But how the <HI>Tartar Cham</HI> appears in this Age, we have
already related.</P>
<P>It is only lawful for the Emperor to be array'd in Yellow, that Colour be∣ing
forbidden to all others: his Raiment is chiefly Embroider'd with Dra∣gons;
and not only are these Dragons upon his Garments, but likewise En∣graven
upon the Vessels of Gold and other Plate belonging to the Palace, as
also upon all the other Furniture thereof; insomuch that the very Tyling
of the Palace is of a yellow Colour, figur'd with the shapes of Dragons, which
has given occasion for some to believe, that the Roof of the Palace was either
of Gold or Copper; whereas in truth it is only cover'd with Tyles colour'd
yellow in the Baking, and fastned with Nails, whose Heads are gilded, that
so every thing outwardly seen may resemble the Emperor's Apparel: And
if any Person should be so audaciously presumptuous as to venture to wear
<PB N="170" REF="100"/>
this Colour or the Dragons, unless he be of the Royal Blood, it would endan∣ger
the loss of his Head, such an Offence being esteem'd criminal as Treason,
and the Offender would suffer as a Traitor.</P>
<P>The Royal Palace has four Gates, toward the four Quarters of the World:
All that pass by these Gates are oblig'd to alight, whether on Horseback
or in a Chair, and to go on foot till they are beyond them. This is done by
all the <HI>Chineses</HI> in general, but much more orderly, and with greater Reve∣rence,
by the Grandees; for they perform this Ceremony while they are yet
at a good distance from the Court: and this is duely observ'd, not only at
<HI>Peking,</HI> the present Imperial Residence, but also at <HI>Nanking,</HI> (the ancient Seat
of the Emperors) though of late years deserted by the Court.</P>
<P>The Emperor oftentimes, for some certain Reasons and Causes best known
to himself, doth confer Titles of Honor upon the Ancestors of the chiefest
Magistrates, by a certain Writing formally drawn up by his Majesties Philo∣sophers:
They put a high value upon such a Writing, and think nothing too
much to give or do to purchase the same; which once obtain'd, they lay up
carefully for their Posterity, as a Holy or Sacred thing. They likewise set a
very high value and esteem upon other Titles, which are express'd with two
or three Characters, and are granted by the Emperor to Widows, that in their
old Age subject themselves again to Matrimony, or to any other extraordi∣nary
ancient People.</P>
<P>These Marks of Honor they hang over their Doors, to be as a Testimonial
for them; and when any Magistrates have done their Country good Services,
Statues of Marble are erected in their Honor, at the Charge of the Publick,</P>
<P>Whatsoever through the whole Empire is rare of costly, is sent to the Em∣peror
at <HI>Peking;</HI> the Magistrates whereof appear with far less State and
Magnificence abroad in the Streets than those of other Places; for unless it
be some of the chiefest and more noble, the rest must only ride on Horseback,
and not be carried in Chairs; and whosoever is permitted to keep a Chair,
must use no more than four Chait-men to carry him. Without the Imperial
City, the Magistrates thereof may appear abroad in a more glorious Gran∣deur;
but their lowly Demeanor at <HI>Peking</HI> is done in submission to their So∣vereign
there resident. Every fourth year, at four distinct times, all the Em∣peror's
Council assemble at the Tombs of the ancient Kings and Queens, and
there offer up rich and costly Presents, with great Humility and Reverence;
but the chiefest Honor is given to King <HI>Hunvuus,</HI> who deliver'd the Kingdom of
<HI>China</HI> out of the hands of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and restor'd the same to Peace and
Honor.</P>
<P>Next to the Emperor they observe and reverence their Superiors and Magi∣strates,
which they do in particular forms and manners of Speech, as also in
stately and noble Visits; neither is access free to them all, but only to such as
have born some Office of Honor or Trust in the Kingdom, or serv'd abroad in
some honorable Employments; for such when they return into their own
Countries, are had in great esteem, as well by the Magistrates as People.</P>
<P>If any one has done his Country considerable Service, behav'd himself well
in his Office, hath been preferr'd to some higher degree of Honor and Trus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
than ordinary, or for some Reason of State or Policy happens to remove
from the City, he is Presented by the Country in his Passage with great Gifts;
but at his departure he must leave behind him his Boots, Marks of Honor, <HI>&amp;c</HI>
in perpetual remembrance of this Favor: His Boots are lock'd up in a Chest,
<PB N="171" REF="100"/>
kept on purpose for such uses, with great care and respect. Others of a higher
Quality have a Pillar of Marble erected to their Honor, to preserve their Me∣mory
and Fame to Posterity, by inscribing thereon in the most legible Cha∣racters,
the great Services they have done for their Country. Some indeed are
more magnificently Signaliz'd, having Temples erected in Honor of their
Names, at the Charge of the Publick, with Images of the Party deceased,
drawn to the Life by the best Artists in the Country, and plac'd upon the Al∣tars:
nor is that all, but there is Incense, Vessels, Torches, and Persons ap∣pointed
to look after the same, that they may always be kept Trimm'd, Per∣fum'd,
and Burning; which to accomplish the more readily, they have great
Vessels of Copper provided to burn in, as is us'd in their Idol-Temples; only
there is this difference between the Worship of the one, and the Veneration of
the other: for in that of their Gods they are always Desiring or Praying for
one thing or other; but in this, appointed to the Memory of a deceased Party,
they are always shewing their grateful Respects for the Benefits receiv'd by
him. But it may be very soberly conjectur'd, that the ordinary Man, not able
by the narrow scantling of his Iudgment to discern this duplicity, makes no
difference between the two Worships; and this seems the more probable, for
that great numbers of People resort thither, and there bow and kneel, and
Offer up what they have, with the same zeal to the one as to the other.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Chiness</HI> Books which treat of Manners and Fashions, contain no
other Instructions but in what manner Children are to obey their Parents:
and certainly herein these blind People are highly to be commended; for
there is no Place in the World to be compar'd with them in this Particular,
for the Honor and Reverence that is by Children yielded to their Parents,
they being neither suffer'd to sit near them, or opposite unto them, but in
some low place of the Room, and that with great Submission and Reve∣rence.
The like respect is shewn by Scholars to their Masters; neither do
Children speak to their Parents, but in the most submissive Terms imagina∣ble;
and if perhaps either the Father or Mother, or both fall into want in
their old Age, the Children freely work night and day to provide for them,
and stint themselves, pinching their own Bellies, to fill those of their Pa∣rents:
An Example truly well worth both imitation and praise, although,
to their shame, not much practised by <HI>Christians.</HI> Such is their Behavior to
their Parents living, however qualified; and it ends not with their Lives,
but follows them to the Grave, attending their Funerals, not only in their
Mourning, wherein they differ very much from other People, but likewise in
the Coffin wherein the Corps is enclos'd, which is made of the richest and
most durable Wood that is to be purchas'd in their own or the Neighboring
Countries.</P>
<P>Every Person in <HI>China</HI> observes his Birth-day as Sacred, bestowing Pre∣sents
upon his Friends, and withal making great Entertainments for them.
Now although every Anniversary Birth-day is thus observ'd, yet there is one
especially celebrated with a more Festivous Solemnity, which is when they
live to the Age of seventy; for not till then are they reckon'd amongst the
Old People: and then are the Walls of the Houses hung with Pictures and
Verses, fill'd with Eulogies to the Party whose Birth-day is to be commemo∣rated.
There are also two others more remarkable than the rest, one where∣of
is that of the tenth Year; but this wants much of the Ceremonies of the
former: The other, which is much honor'd by them, is that upon which
<PB N="172" REF="101"/>
they put on the Virile Hat, as formerly at <HI>Rome</HI> the Young Men did the <HI>Tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Virilis,</HI> or Manly Gown; and this is when they have attain'd twenty Years of
Age.</P>
<P>But with far greater Splendor, and more extraordinary State, is <HI>New-years-day</HI>
solemniz'd through the whole Country, to wit, upon the first day of the
New and Full Moon; for that is the Emperor's Festival, on which day eve∣ry
Man lights in his House great store of Artificial Candles, made of Paper,
Glass, and Cloth, which are sold in the Markets in great quantities. These
being lighted, and the Rooms hung therewith very thick, make a shew as if
the House within were all of a light Fire: And as an addition to their
Mirth, they run up and down the Streets, with the like Candles in their
Hands, whooping and hollowing like mad People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> like the old <HI>Romans,</HI> have several Names by which they are
distinguish'd: for first, they have a Sir-name, which is ancient, and never
alter'd; then a Christian Name; and lastly a Proper Name; and this is still
newly invented, and signifies one thing or other, as their Sir-names most
commonly also do. This second Name, which the Father bestows onely up∣on
his Sons, is always writ with one Character, and pronounc'd with one
Syllable; but the Women have no such Name, being call'd by their Fathers
Sir-name, and by the number of Place in which they stand in regard of their
Birth among the Sisters.</P>
<P>When a Child is put out to School, he receives from the Master a new
Name, and that is call'd the <HI>School-Name,</HI> whereby he is call'd by the Master
and the Scholars onely. Again, when a young Man puts on the Virile Hat,
or is Married, he is presented by some Person of Quality with a more Hono∣rable
Name, call'd <HI>The Letter,</HI> by which any Person may afterwards call
him, except his Servants. Now when he is grown to Years of perfect Man∣hood
he is presented by some other Person with a very honorable Name,
call'd among them <HI>The Great Name:</HI> By this Name he is call'd by all without
any distinction, except his Parents, who think him unworthy of that Honor,
and continue to call him onely by the Name of the <HI>Letter.</HI></P>
<P>If any Person embraces a new Sect or Opinion, the Doctor who intro∣duces
him bestows upon him a new Name; and therefore the <HI>Iesuits</HI> have a
higher Name given them than what they receiv'd in Baptism.</P>
<P>All manner of Antiquities are of great value and account among them,
such as old Vessels made of Chalk, Wood, Marble, or Copper; but especial∣ly
Pictures that are well Drawn, as also the Characters and Writings of fa∣mous
Pen-men, writ upon Cloth and Linnen; and these two last they reckon
as most precious. All the Magistrates wear a distinct Badge or Mark to be
known by, as to their Offices and Employments, which they preserve with
great care; for if they should unhappily lose it, they would not only be
turn'd out of their Employments, but also be severely punish'd; therefore
whenever they go from home, they nail it up in a Chest, and seal it with
their Seal.</P>
<P>Men of great Places and Dignity never go on foot, but are carried on Mens
Shoulders in Chairs, made close round about, so that they cannot be seen by
such as walk the Streets, unless they draw open one of the Curtains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and this
difference there is between them and the Magistrates, who are carrie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in open
Chairs. The Women are also carried in close Chairs, but something different
from those of the Men.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="101"/>
Coaches, Wagons, and Sledges, are not to be us'd in that Country, but
only at <HI>Peking</HI> where the Court resides, as I have already said.</P>
<P>The School-masters there are in higher esteem than in <HI>Europe;</HI> and though
a Scholar has been under the Tuition of a Master but one day, yet he calls him
Master as long as he lives, and respects him as such, according to the Custom
of the Country, in giving him the upper hand.</P>
<P>Neither is there among the better sort any kind of Gaming; but among
the Vulgar, Cards and Dice are sometimes us'd. The Nobles and other Great
Persons divert themselves with this Recreation: They play upon a Board
which has a Hole in the middle, and three hundred little Houses circularly
plac'd about it, with two hundred Pegs, the one half whereof is white, and the
other black; which being divided betwixt the Play-mates, each strive to force
the others Pegs into the Hole, and to get to himself all the Houses; for herein
consists the winning or losing of the Game; but although he cannot attain all,
yet if he can get the most Houses, he still wins the Game. With this sportive
Diversion the Magistrates themselves are much taken, and spend much time
at it; and if they play with Iudgment, sometimes they spend a whole hour
or more before they make an end of one Sett. And such is the Humor of this
People, that whosoever are very skilful herein, are highly honor'd and respe∣cted,
though they are excellent in nothing else.</P>
<P>Marriages are solemniz'd here with great State; and although the Parties
are oftentimes Betrothed to each other in their Nonage, or rather Infancy, by
the Parties of both sides, who never ask their Childrens Consent till all is
concluded and agreed; yet such is their Obedience and Submission, that they
comply with their Desires in this Particular. There is great variety of Cu∣stoms
in this Business; for Persons of Quality for the most part Marry with
their Equals, only for Wealth and Honor, reserving besides what Concubines
they please, which also is allow'd for others to do; and of these the hand∣somest
of Face and Body carry the precedency, and are ordinarily bought for
a hundred Crowns, and sometimes for less. The Commonalty and inferior
Degrees of People buy themselves Wives, and sell them again when they
please; but the Emperor and his Children neither look after the Birth nor
Extraction of the Person, but only to the comely Shape, and extraordinary
Beauty of the Face.</P>
<P>The Emperor has one more select and peculiar Consort, who only is call'd
the lawful Wife, and is his Empress; yet he is also Married to nine others,
who are of a more inferior Condition than the first; and likewise to thirty
more of a third Degree, who are all call'd his Wives. There are several other
Women that belong to him, but they are only stil'd <HI>Queens,</HI> which is a Title
below that of <HI>Empress.</HI> Amongst all this variety of Women, such of them as
are fruitful, and bring him Children, are most highly respected and belov'd
by him; but she more especially that bears the first-born Son, in regard he
is to succeed his Father in the Imperial Throne. And this is not only observ'd
by the Emperor and the Royal Family, but all the Grandees through the whole
Empire by that Pattern, set an Estimate on their Wives, according to their
fertility.</P>
<P>The Empress, which is his first and lawful Wife, sits only with him at the
Table, while all the rest attend her, and are not permitted to sit down in her
Presence, but must stand at her Elbow, as ready upon all occasions to serve
her.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="102"/>
It is generally observ'd through all <HI>China,</HI> That none may intermarry with
a Wife of his own Name, though there be no kind of Relation between them;
but they may freely and legally couple, if they be of differing Names, not∣withstanding
any vicinity of Blood whatsoever; by which means it comes
to pass, that a Father will marry his Child to the nearest Kindred of his
Wife.</P>
<P>Whatever Houshold Goods any Maid or Woman is possess'd of in her own
Right before Marriage, must not devolve to the Bridegroom; but he pur∣chases
them of her the day before the Wedding: yet she is oblig'd to bring
with her a Nag bridled and sadled, four Maid-servants, and two Boys. But
the Bridegroom is to furnish the House with Provisions of all sorts; and du∣ring
the Treaty of Marriage, he presents the Bride with several sorts of Silks
and Linnen; in return whereof, as an acknowledgment of a grateful dispo∣sition,
and in token of an inviolable Love, she sends him a rich Suit of Cloth
of Gold, or Silk. The Bridegroom, in the next place, gives to the Father
of the Bride 100 <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver, and 50 <HI>Toel</HI> to the Mother; which Ceremo∣ny
perform'd, and Presents on all sides given and accepted, they proceed to
the Consummation of the Marriage: After which, the Bridegroom first so∣lemnly
Treats and Feasts the Bride and her Friends eight days together at his
House; and then the Bride re-invites the Bridegroom and his Friends, and
Feasts them for three days together in great State and Splendor. Yet not∣withstanding
all this Feasting, the next day after the Marriage the new mar∣ried
Woman is not neglected to be attended home to her Spouse, by the chief∣est
of her Kindred and Friends, who all the way are waited upon by the best
Musicians they can get.</P>
<P>They are not so full of Circumstance and Ceremony in the foremention'd
things, as they were heretofore remiss in the punishing of Theft, or other
notorious Crimes; for they us'd not to put any to death for simple Stealing,
unless to accomplish their Villany they us'd Force and Violence: If any ta∣ken
the second time were found guilty of Robbery, he was branded upon the
Arm with a hot Iron, with two Characters: If the third time, he is brand∣ed
in the Forehead; but if he committed the like Fault the fourth time, he
was then Whipp'd and Banish'd. This neglect of punishing Rogues for
Stealing, was the cause why <HI>China</HI> did swarm so very much with Thieves and
Vagrants: But since the <HI>Tartars</HI> have been Conquerors of this Empire, they
have with great prudence and strictness redrest those Abuses, and put the
Laws in force against all Offenders; insomuch that when I was in <HI>China,</HI>
Petty Offences were made Criminal; for he that was found guilty of the
least Fault, was punish'd with death: In the execution of which Sentence,
as soon as any one is condemn'd to die, his Hands are bound behind him,
with a Board upon his Back, whereon is writ his Offence; and so bound he is
led by the Sheriff into an open place, according to custom, either within or
without the City; and there he is beheaded without any further Ceremony.
If it happen that any are Pardon'd, and have their Lives spar'd them, they are
punish'd with that extream severity, that oftentimes they chuse rather to die,
than to undergo the Torture which they must suffer to preserve their Lives,
which is after this manner: Two lusty Fellows are commanded to beat the
Criminal upon the Calf of his Leg, till all the Sinews and Nerves are misera∣bly
torn and bruis'd, if not broken. And this is their ordinary method of
Punishment, which is inflicted without any distinction of Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="102"/>
Now as the Punishment is severe, to prevent all Disorders and Robberies
which stir up this severity, there are strict Watches kept every Night in the
Streets, which go the Rounds through the City at certain Hours, as the Guards
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us'd to do in the best Govern'd Cities of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Ceremonies, and manner of Burials; and of their Tombs or
Monuments.</HEAD>
<P>BY what hath been said in the former Chapters it may appear, That the
<HI>Chineses</HI> may be compar'd, in many things which concern their manner
of Living, with the Philosophers, and <HI>Virtuosi</HI> of <HI>Europe;</HI> but they dif∣fer
very much in things relating to Funerals; among which this may be rec∣kon'd
the first, That those of <HI>Europe</HI> seldom think of their Mortality, and so
consequently take little or no care of their Burials while they are living; but
the <HI>Chineses</HI> are in nothing more serious and sollicitous, than to provide for
their Interments whilst they live, and are in perfect health; and that igno∣rance
may be no excuse, they put down in Writing how they will have the
same perform'd, strictly charging their Children upon their Death-beds, and
and even at their last gasp, to observe their Orders. Now there is one Custom
through the whole Country inviolably observ'd, which is, never to bury any
one without a Coffin, though it be a Child but of two days old; for every
Person, according to his Quality, is laid into a Coffin, made of the best sort of
Wood their ability will reach to: But Persons of more Eminency are at far
greater Charge for a rich Repository for their poor Carcasses.</P>
<P>The first Ceremony they observe, when they perceive the Patient to lie a
dying, is this; they take him and lay him upon a Mat, carry him into the out∣ward
Hall of the House, there to breathe his last. And this Custom, though it
carries somewhat of Barbarism in it, is observ'd through the whole Empire by
the Commonalty; but for what reason I could never learn, notwithstanding
all the diligence of my curious and prying Enquiries. But among the better
sort, a Person of equal Quality with themselvs is suffer'd to die in Bed. Ano∣ther
phantastick Humor here is, whilst the sick Party is breathing forth his last,
the eldest of his Sons puts on his Bonnet or Cap, and coming to the Bed in a
distracted manner, tears the Curtain, and covereth therewith the dead Body,
which after it hath lain a convenient time, is wash'd according to the Custom
of the Country, and wrapt either in very fine Linnen or Silk: Some are yet
more extravagant, and will dress out the Corps with new Clothes, and after
they are Embalm'd, set them at a Table well furnish'd with Provisions of all
sorts; and this a great, but not much commendable Fashion amongst the
Grandees. The nearest Relations of the Deceased are invited to this solemn,
though mournful Entertainment; who entreat him to eat and be merry with
them, as if he were living. In the mean time the Priests are busied in Sing∣ing▪
and performing the other usual Ceremonies.</P>
<P>As to the Mourning Habit, it differs from all Countries that I have seen,
not onely for its Colour, which generally is white, but for the form and
shape of it: for Sons, when they Mourn for their Fathers, they Clothe them∣selves
for the first Month in a course stiff Habit, hanging down to their Heels,
<PB N="176" REF="103"/>
and tied about the Middle with a Cord, after the manner of the <HI>Monks</HI> of the
<HI>Franciscan</HI> Order. But although they lay aside that Habit then, yet it is a con∣stant
Custom for Children to Mourn three years for their Parents; the rea∣son
whereof they alledge in their Books to be this, because that Parents carry
their Children for the three first years of their Infancy in their Arms, with
great care and trouble; and therefore the Children ought to requite their
Affection and Kindness, by shewing their Duty in Mourning after this man∣ner.
But the time of Mourning for other Friends is much abbreviated; some∣times
it lasts a Year, otherwhiles but three Months, according as they stand
related or affected to one another.</P>
<P>The legal time of Mourning for the Death of the Emperor or Empress, was
formerly three years; and this outward shew of Sorrow extended even to the
furthermost Confines of the Empire: But now, with the Emperor's consent,
which is openly proclaim'd, the Months are turn'd into Days, so that at the
present they Mourn but only one Month for his Death; but still the extent
reaches over all his Dominions. All the Funeral Ceremonies are written in a
large Book, which those concern'd peruse when a Person of Quality dies,
whereby they know how to order his Burial.</P>
<P>As soon as any Nobleman is dead, the Son, or who is next related to him
in Blood, signifies the same by a Book to all his Kindred and Friends, upon
the third or fourth day, wherein the Mourning is set forth in the usual terms.
At the same time the Corps is incoffin'd, and plac'd in the Hall or Chamber,
which is hung with white Linnen; in the middle whereof is erected an Altar,
whereon is plac'd the Corps and Portraicture of the Deceased. Into this
Room come all the Kindred and Friends upon the third or fourth day, clad in
Mourning, and bringing Incense and Wax-Lights to the Altar, which being
once lighted and burning, they tender their Respects to the Dead, in bowing
and falling upon their Knees four times, a while before burning a little In∣cense
over against the Coffin and Picture. While these Ceremonies are per∣forming,
one or two of the Sons of the Deceased stand on one side of the Cof∣fin
in their white Mourning, with great modesty, and shedding tears plenti∣fully.
Behind it sits the Mother, with the Daughters and others of the Rela∣tions,
in Mourning also; but they are so reserv'd in their manner of Lamen∣tation,
that they have a Curtain drawn before them, that so they may not be
seen. In the Hall stand two Trumpeters, and at the great Gate of the Court
within, two Drummers; over the Gate hangs upon a Board, a long Scrowl
of Paper even to the Ground, wherein is to be read who it is that is deceased,
and what he had done in his Life-time for the Service and Benefit of his
Country.</P>
<P>It often hapneth that the Children keep their Bodies three or four Years
unburied in their Houses, in all which time they are never offended with any
Scents proceeding from the same; the reason whereof may be their extraor∣dinary
skill in Embalming, and closing the Crevices of the Coffin: and so
long as they keep them thus above-ground, they set before them Meat and
Drink daily, as if they were living: During all which time, the Sons take
not their Places, but sit upon a long Bench cover'd with White; and as a
further Testimony of their obedient Sorrow, they sleep not upon Beds, but
upon Matrasses of Straw spread upon the Floor near the Cossin, abstaining
likewise all that while from Flesh▪ or any compound Meats, or drinking
Wine, or using any Baths: and, that which is yet more to be taken notice
<PB N="177" REF="103"/>
of, they forbear to accompany with their Wives in any way of Natural
Affection. And this for the generality is voluntary; but what follows is for∣bidden,
to wit, They may not go to any publick Invitations abroad, nor so
much as be seen in the Streets for so many Months; but if their Occasions be
such as call them out of doors, they are carried in a close Chair, cover'd over
with Mourning. Although formerly, to the commendation of the Country,
these things were perform'd; yet in this present Age few or none are found
amongst them that are so strict in the observation of these Ceremonies.</P>
<P>Upon the day appointed for the Funeral, all the Friends meet, who are in∣vited
by another Book to accompany the Corps of their Friend to his Grave.
The Solemnity is order'd and perform'd after the same manner as the <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI>
make their Processions at certain times of the Year. Several Images
of Men, Women, Elephants, Tygers, Lions, and such like Beasts, made all of
Paper, and Painted with several Colours, are carried before the Coffin, and at
last burnt at the Grave; among whom also go some that carry Incense in
large Copper Vessels, and Wax Torches burning: The Priests and others
that belong to the Idol-Temples, follow after these with Drums and Pipes;
After whom, next in place, is the Coffin, most curiously beautifi'd and adorn'd,
born up by at least forty or fifty Persons, all very richly Habited. Behind the
Coffin come the Sons on foot, but seeming to support themselves with Sticks
in their Hands, as if Grief and Sorrow had brought them into a weak Condi∣tion:
Then follow the Women in close Chairs, cover'd with White, so that
they cannot be seen.</P>
<P>If sometimes it happen that the Fathers die when their Sons are from home,
the Funeral is deferr'd till their Return, and notice thereof sent them; which
as soon as they receive, they immediately put on Mourning upon the very
Place where they are, and then hastens home with the first opportunity, to
perform the Ceremonies in order as we have related. But this is not all; for a
Son is oblig'd by virtue of the Laws, though he is in the highest Office of the
Kingdom, and one of the <HI>Colaos,</HI> to return home, and there to Mourn for the
space of three entire years; in which time he is totally forbidden to return to
his Charge: Yet this is only to be understood of Mourning for Parents, and
not for other Friends. Nevertheless the Soldiers and Military Officers are not
subject to this Law.</P>
<P>If it chance that any dies either in Travel, or Employment, out of his na∣tive
Country, he to whom the Charge and Care of his Funeral is committed,
uses his utmost diligence to procure the dead Body to be brought back, that
it may be buried in the Grave of his Ancestors; in the preserving whereof
they are very curious, insomuch that none else are admitted to be Interr'd
there: And therefore every <HI>Chinese</HI> who is able, erects a Vault with a Tomb
over it, without the Walls of the City, in the Suburbs, to remain for a Burial-place
to him and his Posterity, it being dissonant to the Grandeur of Noble
Persons to have their Sepulchres within the City. They are generally of Mar∣ble,
sometimes of other Stone, contain'd in a portion of Ground, according
to the Greatness of the Person, and commonly Wall'd about; within whose
circumference some make several little Rooms, which, together with the said
Wall, are surrounded with artificial Groves of Cypress-Trees. Upon the top
of the Grave lies a large Stone, rarely adorn'd with curious Images Engraven
round about it; and upon its Surface are Engraven the famous Actions of the
Deceased.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="104"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>They whose Wealth raises them to the highest pitch of humane Felicity
and enlarges their Pleasures beyond the limit of a Satisfaction in this Life,
such as the <HI>Gelubden,</HI> bestow vast Sums of Money upon their Tombs, building
them little inferior to Palaces, with several Apartments within, and Trium∣phal
Arches standing before them.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xansi,</HI> upon the Mountains, are several of these famous
Sepulchral Monuments. Near to the City <HI>Taming</HI> is a very noble Piece of Anti∣quity
in this kind, built by the Emperor <HI>Cavus,</HI> about 4000. years since, as they
report. So likewise near to the City <HI>Cinon,</HI> upon the Mountains are built very
sumptuous Tombs, as well of Kings, as of other Great Lords.</P>
<P>I my self saw some of these Sepulchres, very artificially built upon some so∣litary
Hills, which were not the Products of Nature, but, to make the Work
the more stupendious and considerable, were cast up with the Spade, and rais'd
to almost an incredible height. In the middle of Wall was a Gate, through
which we entred into the Sepulchre (to which belong commonly three such
Doors) and ascended by easie Steps up to the Mouth of the same, which was
Plaister'd on the insides and had Benches about it.</P>
<P>At certain times of the Year, the surviving Friends come and visit these
Graves, bringing store of Provisions with them, and then express their Sorrow
afresh, shedding Tears, and using other Lamentations for the loss of their
dear Friends; nay, some of them do with such reality of Grief and Affection
oftentimes take it to heart, that they will by no means be drawn thence, but
desire to be reckon'd among the Dead.</P>
<P>Without the City of <HI>Nanking</HI> (heretofore the Court and Imperial Chamber
of the ancient Princes) but not far distant from the Walls, grows a very plea∣sant
Wood, full of Pine-trees, Wall'd in, and containing twelve <HI>Italian</HI> Miles
in circumference; in the middle whereof rises a Hill, whereupon are to be
view'd several well-built Tombs, and divers other very famous Works; among
which a certain Idol-Temple may be accounted the chiefest Master-piece, for
thereby doth sufficiently appear the great esteem these People had of their
Burying-places, not only in regard of the pleasant solitariness, but of the al∣most
infinite Cost bestow'd upon it. It is situate upon an high Hill, and built
all of Wood, except the Walls, which are of Stone. The Entrance into this
<PB N="179" REF="104"/>
Temple is by four large Marble Staircases, each having several Steps, with
Gates opening towards the four Quarters of the World; between which are
four Princely Galleries, supported on all sides by curious Carv'd Pillars of
Wood, each being at least four yards thick, and thirty six Foot high; all the
Cielings being most exquisitely, and with great Art Painted and Gilded. The
Doors are most admirably wrought with Imagery, and Painted; the outward
Galleries and Windows have as it were a covering of Wyre-work, to keep the
Birds from roosting upon, or fouling them, which is made so thin, that it doth
not in the least darken the Temple.</P>
<P>In the middle or more inward part of the Temple stand two Thrones,
wrought with extraordinary rarity, and adorn'd with all manner of Precious
Stones. Upon these stand two Chairs, in one of which the Emperor sits when
he Offereth, which in this Place is forbiden to all Persons, of what Condition
soever, but only himself; the other continually remains empty, to be as it
were a Seat for the Deity, suppos'd to be present and ready to receive the Of∣fering;
yet they permit no Image to be set before it. In the open Air, or as
we say, <HI>sub Dio,</HI> stand several Altars of red Marble, by which the <HI>Chineses</HI> sig∣nifie
or denote the Sun, Moon, Mountains, and Floods; and these things, as
by them is reported, are erected without the Temple, because none should
worship them; and that every one should render Worship and Honor unto
nothing, but what is venerated and ador'd by the Emperor in the Temple.
Round about are several Cells, wherein formerly were Baths for the Emperor
to wash himself before he went to Offer; leading to which are several broad
Ways, planted on both sides with Pines, by them esteem'd so Sacred, that
no Person is suffer'd to break a Bough from them, upon pain of death; all
which, as well in the Walks as on these Hills, are said to be Planted.</P>
<P>Much more might be voluminously writ of the Tombs and Burial-places
in general, but especially of those which the Emperors have caus'd to be
Built near the Royal City <HI>Peking,</HI> the present Place of their Residence: But
these, and most of the rest, have undergone one and the same direful Fate,
not escaping the fury and rage of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who in their late Invasions de∣stroy'd
and utterly laid waste all that was rare or worthy of Remark in this
Empire.</P>
<P>And after this manner Persons of Quality, and such as are Rich, for the
most part provide themselves Burial-places in their life-time; but the or∣dinary
and vulgar sort of People have a Place deputed within the City, where
they Bury promiscuously, and without any Ceremony or Charge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Form, Shape, and Make of the Body, and the Fashion of their
Clothes.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Chineses,</HI> for the greater part of them, are almost as White of
Complexion as the People of <HI>Europe;</HI> though indeed some of them,
who live in the Southern Countries, somewhat near the Line, are so scorch'd
with the heat of the Sun, that they are of a Swarthy Colour. The Hair of
their Beards, though thin and short, is yet very stiff and harsh, and long be∣fore
it appears; so that a Man of thirty years of Age there, looks as young as
<FIGURE>
<PB N="180" REF="105"/>
</FIGURE>
one of twenty in <HI>Europe:</HI> The Colour of their Hair is generally Black, which
they wear of a reasonable length; but if any happen to have Red Hair,
which is seldom seen, it is a discredit to wear the same long. Their Eyes are
little, somewhat long, yet inclining to round, and black of colour: Their
Noses small, and not rising very high; yet their Ears are of the largest size:
but in the other Parts of the Face they differ very little from those of <HI>Europe.</HI>
This Description reaches not all Parts of <HI>China;</HI> for in some Places the Peo∣ple
have flat and almost four-square Faces. In the Provinces of <HI>Quantung</HI>
and <HI>Quangsi</HI> the greatest number have upon the little Toe two Nails, which is
common likewise to those of <HI>Couchinchina;</HI> the Reason whereof haply might
be, that they had formerly on each Foot six Toes.</P>
<P>All the Women are short, and low of Stature, and their chiefest Beauty
(as they imagine) consists in the smallness of their Feet; and therefore when
they are young, they bind and swath their Feet, they keep them from growing
to their natural bigness, and by that means they become generally very
small: But this is not all the care; for they are taught very young, That it
is a principal part of modesty to keep within doors, and not to be seen fre∣quently
abroad in the Streets: and therefore they account it, especially in
Persons of Honor, a great shame to appear openly in the Streets; yet they
are brought up to Dance, Sing, and Play upon such Musical Instruments as
are in use amongst them.</P>
<P>They are for the most part Handsom, Complaisant, and Ingenious, and
exceed in Beauty and exact Symetry of Body all other Heathenish Women;
their Complexion tends to whiteness; and their Eyes are brown: All their
natural Beauties and peculiar Excellencies they heighten with Gold and
Painting. But amongst all the rest, they have this one single Humor pro∣per
to themselves, that they never pare the Nails of their left Hand; and I
my self saw a Gentlewoman at <HI>Peking,</HI> who wore a Case made of Reeds about
her Fingers, to preserve her Nails from breaking. Such as are rich are tenderly
Educated, observe Set-times of Eating and Drinking, but with great mode∣ration,
being stinted to a Measure which they must not exceed; and by this
strict manner of Living, most of them grow very slender and handsom.</P>
<P>Heretofore both Men and Women in <HI>China</HI> wore long Hair upon their
<FIGURE>
<PB N="181" REF="105"/>
</FIGURE>
Heads, never permitting it to be cut, only the Youth of both Sexes cut off all
theirs, but one Lock upon the Crown, till they were fifteen years of Age;
then they began to let it grow till they came to be twenty, at which time they
put on the Virile Hat; and all the time before-mention'd they wore it as the
ancient <HI>Greeks,</HI> or modern <HI>English,</HI> hanging down about their Ears; but then
they tied it up, and wore it under their Hats, or else Caps made of Horse-hair,
Mens-hair, or Silk. This Hat had a Hole in the Crown, through which the
longest Hairs, neatly pleited, were seen.</P>
<P>The Women wore no such Hats, but went in every respect as they do at
this time, with Hair neatly pleited, and curiously adorn'd with Precious
Stones, Gold, Silver, and Flowers: But since this famous Empire fell under
the tyrannous Yoke of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and became subject to them, they have al∣so
submitted to the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Mode of cutting and wearing the Hair: for now
the <HI>Chineses</HI> do cut off all their Hair after the manner of their Conqueror,
reserving only one Lock, which hangs down behind. But certainly, had they
not been reduc'd into the meanest Condition of Servility, they (who took so
much pride in wearing long Hair, that thousands of them suffer'd themselves
to be put to Death, rather than have their Hair cut off) would not now un∣constrain'd
have alter'd their Minds; and this I the rather believe, for that
they have a superstitious Fancy, that they are to be pull'd up into Heaven by
the Hair of the Head.</P>
<P>The Fashions of their Apparel alter as well as here in <HI>Europe:</HI> At present
they generally wear long Gowns of a blue Colour, which reach down to their
Heels, wherein the Men wrap themselves when they go abroad; but the
Women tie them close about their Wastes with a Girdle. Both sorts are made
with large Sleeves; but those for the Women are much larger at the Hand,
whereas the Mens are made fit for their Wrists and Arms. These Forms of
Apparel are worn by all without difference, but only in substance they mate∣rially
differ; for those of the nobler sort are made of the richest Silks, Em∣broider'd
with Dragons, whereas the Commonalty wear them made of ordi∣nary
Stuffs.</P>
<P>The next observable part of their Apparel is their Shoes, wherein they dif∣fer
much from the other Parts of the World, both for the Fashion and Stuff.
<FIGURE>
<PB N="182" REF="106"/>
</FIGURE>
The Women commonly make their own Shoes of blue or red Silk, with sharp
Toes, deck'd with Pearls and Rubies, and stitch'd with all manner of Flowers.
The Commonalty only wear Shoes made of Leather, colour'd yellow; but
Grandees are so far from wearing Leather, that the very Soles of their Shoes
are made of Cloth.</P>
<P>The Learned, such as they term Philosophers, wear four-square Caps or
Hats; but the illiterate are forbidden to wear other than round ones, made
of Horse-hair; only in Winter they have of them made of Silk or Wool, with
an Edging about it of Sables. They use no Linnen Shirts, as the <HI>Europeans</HI> do,
next to their Skins, but only a Frock made of white Cotton, which is so made,
that they tie it above the Ancle with a Ribband.</P>
<P>They often wash and bathe themselves, and spend the greatest part of a
Morning in Combing and Dressing their Heads: When they go abroad, they
skreen themselves from the parching heat of the Sun, with large <HI>Quittesol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI>
(in <HI>Italy</HI> call'd <HI>Umbrella's)</HI> which are carried over their Heads; but the ordinary
sort of People make use only of Fans.</P>
<P>Thus far of the Customs of the better sort of People, and Citizens; from
whom the Country People do not altogether differ: for they likewise wear
short Hair, with a long Lock hanging down behind. They are very labo∣rious,
and excellently skill'd in Husbandry and Tillage: When they Plow
their Land, a Man and a Woman help to draw the Plough with an Ass, and
another Man goe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> behind to guide it: And this kind of toilsom Life, in
regard of the great Profit it brings to the Publick, and that it conduces so
much to the Benefit of Mankind, is much encourag'd by the <HI>Chinese</HI> Empe∣rors,
who have granted several Immunities to such as make it their Employ∣ment;
which Privileges have so far prevail'd, that by continual Practice,
and experimental Observation, they have brought that Calling to great per∣fection,
and have left very little Ground untill'd in all <HI>China.</HI> Barren Ground
they know how to improve, by Dunging, or other ways of Manuring. Such
Lands as are scorch'd up in Summer for want of Water, they plentifully
supply, though with much labor and industry, conveying Water to the same
from remote Places, by Trenches and Aqueducts cut for that purpose; by
which means one may pass by Water through most Parts of this Empire, to

the great accommodation of the Inhabitants, and the wonderful advance of
Traffick and Commerce through the whole Country.</P>
<P>The Country Women in <HI>China</HI> wear Breeches, which they tie about their
Knees: And some, that they may lose no time, go commonly Spinning
about the Streets, Fields, or other Places, which arises to such Profit, that
thereby onely a great number of Families make shift to get a competent
Subsistence.</P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some Superstitious Customs, Fashions, and other Errors in use
amongst the Chineses.</HEAD>
<P>IN this following Chapter we shall treat of some Superstitious Fashions
and Erroneous Customs which are in use among the several Sects of the
<HI>Chineses:</HI> And first we shall take notice, That they are generally very much
inclin'd and addicted to observe Times and Seasons, and have so great an
esteem for Sooth-sayers, Fortune-tellers, Astrologers, Star-gazers, and the
like, that they believe whatsoever they foretell; insomuch that they govern
all their Transactions according to the Sayings of those People, whose Ad∣vice
is taken and follow'd in their Affairs from time to time; their Books,
much like our Almanacks, being in general request: besides which, there
are other Books of their Writing, which treat of far deeper and conceal'd
things. So prevalent is this Science among all sorts of People, that there is
a vast multitude of Masters that teach it, who have no other livelyhood but
what they get by directing those that come to them the Day and Hour in
which they may with great hopes of Success go about any Business: And
indeed they are so infinitely possest with an opinion of the Knowledge
and Wisdom of these Men, that they never undertake a Iourney, go about
to erect a Building, or do any thing else of consequence, but they first con∣sult
with them about it, and observe to a Tittle whatsoever they direct; so
that neither Rainy, Stormy, or Tempestuous Weather, such as would even
<PB N="184" REF="107"/>
fright a Satyre, can hinder them from beginning their Iourney upon the Day
prefix'd for the same, though they go but out of sight of their own Dwel∣lings:
or if they are to Build, they will dig a little way into the Ground, or
make some entrance or beginning into the Work, let the Weather be never
so bad, that it may be said they began upon that Day which was foretold them
should be successful to their Undertaking.</P>
<P>Over and above these humorous Niceties, they are great Observers of the
Day of any ones Birth, by which they confidently undertake to predict to them
the good or bad Fortune likely to befal them through the whole Course of
their Lives: and in truth, this inclination of their Nature is the cause that no
People in the whole World are more easie to be deluded with the fallacious
Fancies of such as assume to themselves the Title of Wizards and Sooth sayers,
whose Cunning hath devised various Ways to cheat the Ignorant, and to make
them pass for Oracles.</P>
<P>In the former Chapter we treated of their Sepulchres, and the ordering
thereof, wherein they are not more careful, than curious in making choice of
the Place for that purpose, which they make to resemble the Head, Tail, and
Feet of a Dragon; which sort of Creature they fancy to live under Ground.
Upon this doth not only depend, as they firmly believe the good and bad
Fortune of particular Families, but the very well-being of Cities, Countries,
and of the whole Empire: And therefore when any publick Building is to be
Erected, the Learned in this mysterious Art are first consulted with, concern∣ing
the good or bad success that will follow upon it, that they may thereby
chuse the better Lot.</P>
<P>There are abundance of People here, who not able to restrain their licen∣tiousness,
though in the meanest degree of Poverty, sell themselves for Slaves
to the Rich, upon condition that they may take to Wife any of the Maid-Ser∣vants:
But note, That whatsoever Children come of these Marriages become
Slaves for ever. Othere there are, who being well to pass, and of ability, pur∣chase
them Wives for their Money; but when their Families increase in num∣ber,
and Means begin to fail, they sell their Sons and Daughters for two or
three Crowns apiece, not caring what becomes of them afterwards, nor ever
taking notice of them, though they are made Slaves for ever, and may be put
to what Employment the Purchaser thinks good. Many of this kind are
bought up by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and carried out of their native
Country into Forein Parts, where they live in perpetual Slavery during their
Lives, without any hope of Redemption. This cannot in Civiliz'd Nations
be accounted other than a piece of Heathenish Barbarism.</P>
<P>But yet they commit a far greater and more horrid Inhumanity, which is
this: In some Provinces they drown the young Infants, especially Females,
for no other reason, but that they mistrust they shall not be able to maintain
them, but be forc'd to sell them to unknown People. This liberty they take
to themselves, from a belief, That the Souls of the Deceased transmigrate into
other Bodies; and therefore they would seem to infer, That this their Cru∣elty
is necessary, at leastwise convenient, and so no ways dreadful unto them;
averring, That they do the Children great advantage in taking away their
Lives; for by that means they deliver them the sooner out of a miserable
Condition, to settle them in a better: And therefore the poor Children are
not made away clandestinely, or in private, but <HI>aperto sole,</HI> openly, before all
People.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="107"/>
But this unnatural Cruelty is not all; there is yet more inhumanity pra∣ctis'd
amongst them: for some, out of despair of Good Fortune, or because
they have sustain'd great Losses, will voluntarily lay violent Hands upon
themselves; others, if they cannot find a means to revenge themselves upon
their Enemies, will kill themselves, thinking thereby to do them a mischief;
for (as 'tis said) great numbers both of Men and Women destroy themselves
every year, either in the Fields, or else before the Doors of their Adversaries,
by strangling, drowning, or poisoning themselves.</P>
<P>Another sort of Barbarism they are guilty of in the Northern Provinces,
towards young Children, which is by Gelding them; whereby, and no other∣wise,
they are made capable of Service and Preferment in the Emperor's Pa∣lace:
And these they call in their Language <HI>Gelubden,</HI> besides whom, none are
admitted to wait on the Prince; and which is more, the whole Government
of the Empire is in their Hands and Management. There are at least ten
thousand of these <HI>Gelubden</HI> in the Palace, who originally are all mean Persons,
without Learning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> brought up in perpetual Slavery; by reason whereof,
and their ignorance, they are of a dull and heavy Disposition, and unfit for
any Business of Concern.</P>
<P>The Magistrates have in effect an Arbitrary Power over the Subject, whom
they oftentimes condemn unheard. The manner of punishing Offenders, is
to lay them flat upon their Faces on the Ground, with their Legs bare, upon
which they give them several Blows with a Whip made of twisted Reed,
which fetches Blood at every Blow. And the great Motive that induces to this
more than common Severity in punishing Offences, is for that the <HI>Chineses</HI> are
infinitely addicted to Robbing and Stealing.</P>
<P>There are two extravagant Humors that the Grandees in <HI>China</HI> are much
guilty of: The one is the Transmutation of other Metals into Silver, about
which they often break their Brains, and consume their Estates: The other is
an Opinion they have of obtaining an Immortal Being in this World, while
they are clad with Flesh and Blood; that is to say, they fancy such means may
be us'd, as will preserve them from falling into that common Bosom of Na∣ture,
the Grave. Of both these Mysteries there are an innumerable company
of Books both Printed and Written; and few or none of the Grandees but, as
it were by Obligation, betake themselves to the Study of these distracting and
destructive Sciences. To this purpose there is a Story in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Books, of
one of their ancient Emperors, that was so intoxicated with this Prensie, that
with the danger and hazard of his Life he endeavor'd after an unattainable
Immortality; the maner thus: This Emperor had caus'd a certain Drink
to be prepar'd by some deceitful Masters of this Art, of whose Rarity and
Perfection he had so great confidence, that he believ'd when he had drunk it,
he should be immortal; and from this conceited Imagination he could not be
dissuaded, nor could the strongest Arguments of his nearest Relations divert
him from his Humor: At last one of his Friends, seeing that no argumenta∣tive
Ratiocinations would prevail with him, came one day to Congratulate
the Emperor's Health, whose Back being turn'd, the Visitant took the Bowl
and drank a good Draught; which the over-credulous Emperor perceiving,
fell immediately into a great Passion, attended with no less than reiterated
threats of Death, for depriving him of his immortal Liquor. But the bold
Attempter answer'd him with an undaunted courage in these terms: <HI>Do you
suppose that you can deprive me of my Life, now I have drank of the Immortal Cup? sure
<PB N="186" REF="108"/>
'twere great madness in you so to think: But if in truth you can despoil me thereof, then I
aver that I have not done any thing amiss; for either by participating of your Drink I am
become equally Immortal with you, or else you are equally Mortal with me: If you can take
away my Life now, I have not robb'd you of your Immortality, but shall make you sensible of
the Deceit and Guile wherewith you are abus'd.</HI> The Emperor hearing this, was pre∣sently
pacifi'd and highly commended the Wisdom of his Friend, in extrica∣ting
him so ingeniously out of the greatest Folly and Madness imaginable.
But though there have not wanted wise Men in <HI>China,</HI> that have always endea∣vor'd
to confute this phantastick Principle, and to cure this Distemper of the
Mind, which in it self is no better than a Fit of raving Madness; yet they
could never so hinder this Disease from increasing or taking head, but at pre∣sent
it overspreads the whole Country, and generally gains belief among the
Great Ones.</P>

<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of several Sects in China: Concerning Philosophy, and Idol-Worship.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the Heathen Sects which are come to the knowledge of those in
<HI>Europe,</HI> we have not read of any who are fall'n into fewer Errors
than the <HI>Chineses,</HI> ever since the first Ages; for in their Books we
read, That these People have from the Beginning worshipp'd the Highest and
One God-head, whom they call <HI>The King,</HI> or with another and more common
Name, <HI>The Heaven and the Earth:</HI> Hence it appears they were of opinion, That
Heaven and Earth were inspir'd, and so they worshipp'd the Soul thereof for
the highest Deity. But beside this Supreme Deity, they deviated into the wor∣ship
of several Spirits, to wit, of Hills, Rivers, and such as Command over the
four Quarters of the World. In all Transactions the ancient <HI>Chineses</HI> were wont
to say, <HI>That Men ought to hearken to the inbred Light of the Understanding, which Light
they have receiv'd from Heaven.</HI> But as to the Supreme Deity, and the Spirits
which wait upon him, we do not find in any of their Books that they did ever
broach such licentious Doctrines, to the support of Vice, as were invented by
the <HI>Romans, Grecians,</HI> or the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who in the committing of all manner of
Filthiness, did implore the assistance of their debauch'd Gods.</P>
<P>It likewise appears by the yearly Book, which comprehend the Transactions
of four thousand years, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> have perform'd several brave Works
for the Service of their Country, and the Publick Good. The same is also to
be seen by the Books of the ancient and wisest Philosophers, which were all
in being before the last Invasion of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> but then in the general Con∣flagration
of the Country were most of them burnt, wherein were writ good
and wholsom Doctrines, for the Instruction of Youth in the Ways of Vertue
and Goodness.</P>
<P>These Books mention only three Sects to have been in those Times in the
World: The first of which is the Sect of the Learned: The second is call'd
<HI>Sciequia:</HI> And the third <HI>Lancu.</HI> The first of these three Sects is follow'd by all
the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and the adjacent People which use the <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, as the
Islanders of <HI>Iapan, Corea,</HI> and <HI>Couchinchina,</HI> and by none else, and is the anci∣entest
of all the Sects that were ever heard of in <HI>China.</HI> Out of it, about which a
<PB N="187" REF="108"/>
very great number of Books are writ, generally are chosen such Persons as
are fit for the Government of the Empire; and therefore it is honor'd and
esteem'd above all others. The Doctrine of this Sect is not learn'd all at
once, but they suck it in by degrees when they learn to Read or Write. The
first Founder of this Sect was <HI>Confutius,</HI> the Prince of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Philosophers,
who is to this day honor'd by all the Learned with the Title of <HI>The most Wise.</HI>
This <HI>Confutius,</HI> as the Iesuit <HI>Semedo</HI> relates in his History, was a Man of a very
good Nature, and much inclin'd to Vertue; Prudent, Subtil, and a great
Lover of his Country: His Writings are to this day had in great honor and
esteem, as being the Ground-work of all the Learning at this time in use
amongst them. What concerns his Writings, which are contain'd in four large
Books, we have already made mention.</P>
<P>Several other Books have been written by the Followers of this Sect;
some whereof have been brought out of <HI>China</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> the Titles and Con∣tents
of which I thought good here to mention; and are these that follow:

<ITEM>3. <HI>Of the Doctrine of the Full Growth.</HI> These two Books are reputed to con∣tain
all Natural Knowledge, and selected out of the first Book. And they
firmly believe, that no Person beside themselves are able or fit to comprehend
the Marrow and Pith of these mysterious Books, though in truth and substance
they are no more difficult to be understood, than the Writings of <HI>Titus Livius,</HI>

<ITEM>28. Of several sorts of Plays.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Moreover, this first Sect of the Learned, whereof we have thus far made
a Description, is absolutely against the Worship of Images, neither will they
suffer them to be in their Temples. The Adherents and Fautors of this Sect
acknowledge and worship One God onely; induc'd thereunto, because they
firmly believe that all these Earthly Things are Preserv'd, Govern'd, and Di∣rected
by him: they also render a certain Veneration to Spirits, but with
less Adoration and Respect. Some among them teach, <HI>That the World had nei∣ther
Creator nor Beginning, but sprung immediately from it self.</HI> There are others
among them, but not so Learned and Famous, who are possess'd with Dreams
and Phansies of a multitude of incredible things, and many impossible Im∣pertinences
relating thereunto.</P>
<P>In the Doctrine of this Sect there are many Lessons, teaching the Reward
of Good, and the Punishment of Evil: and this seems to insinuate to us,
That the Ancient <HI>Chineses</HI> did not doubt of the Immortality of the Soul:
But the Learned among them at this time are of opinion, That the Souls of
the Departed perish and come to nothing with the Body, thereby endeavor∣ing
to invalidate the Belief of Future Rewards and Punishments: Yet some
think this too hard, and therefore maintain, That only the Souls of the Iust
remain alive; because, as they say, the Soul of a Man is so united and re∣new'd
through the Exercise of Vertue, that it will live for a long time after
its separation from the Body: but withall they conclude, That the Souls
of the Wicked die as soon as they are divided from the Body, and vanish like
Smoak.</P>
<P>And although the Learned, and Dependents of this Sect, acknowledge the
Highest and One Deity, yet they erect no Temple for him, nor have any par∣ticular
Place for his Worship; neither are there any Priests, nor setled or due
Form of Worship, nor Commands to observe, other than such as they may
at pleasure break. There is no High-Priest amongst them, to punish such as
offend against the Law, or to propagate the Doctrine taught concerning him;
therefore they Offer unto him neither Prayer nor Sacrifice, in Publick or in
Private, believing that it is only free for the King to Offer up unto, or Adore
this King of Heaven. And if any body else should be so adventurous to un∣dertake
to make such an Offering, he would be held for a Traitor, and pu∣nish'd
accordingly. For this purpose has the Emperor two famous and well-built
Temples in both the Imperial Chief Cities of <HI>Nanking</HI> and <HI>Peking;</HI> the
one Dedicated to Heaven, and the other to the Earth; in both which them∣selves
formerly in Person made their Offerings: but now the chiefest Magi∣strates
Officiate in their behalfs, and Sacrifice several Oxen and Sheep to Hea∣ven
and Earth.</P>
<P>The chiefest Matter wherewith the Professors of this Sect trouble them∣selves,
and wherein as well the King as the People is concern'd, consists in the
performing of certain Ceremonies towards the Dead, whereof we have already
spoken at large; for they conceive it a principal part of their Duty, to honor
their deceased Parents and Friends, as if they were stil living: Yet these
<PB N="189" REF="109"/>
People (although they set Viands and the like before them) are not so blind
and ignorant to believe that the Dead eat, or have any need thereof: But
they give this reason for such their Doings, which in it self indeed is of no
weight, <HI>viz.</HI> because they can shew their love unto them no other way. The
wisest among them affirm, That those Customs were introduc'd more for the
Instruction of the Living, than Honor of the Dead, to wit, to teach Children
how to honor and respect their Parents and Superiors when they are alive,
whom they see honor'd and respected by so many Persons of Quality and
Worth after their Deaths.</P>
<P>We now come to speak of the Doctrine <HI>Confutius</HI> left behind him, and
which is in such esteem amongst the People.</P>
<P>This great Doctrine, or rather the Doctrine of this Great Man, is made up
of these Heads or Positions, <HI>viz.</HI> That every one bring himself first to Perfe∣ction,
and afterwards others, that so all may arrive at the possession of the
<HI>Supremum Bonum,</HI> or Highest Good: But herein Perfection it self consists,
That every Person blow up the Natural Light in himself, and make it clear,
so as he may never err from the Law of Nature, or from the Commands and
Rudiments which are naturaliz'd unto a Man by that Law: And in regard
the same cannot be done without an insight and inspection into things; there∣fore
it is requisite Men should betake themselves to the Study of Philosophy,
whereby they may learn what is to be done and avoided. By this Knowledge
(say they) we are taught how to order our Affairs aright, and to rectifie our
Desires by the Rule and Square of Reason; and herein consists the Perfection
of Body and Mind.</P>
<P>This most short and perfect Comprehension of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Wisdom and
Doctrine, comprehends in it the Beginning, Means, Rule, and Benefit (which
at last arises from thence) of Perfection, as well relating to our selves as others.
The first Beginnings of this Perfection are said to arise from an Intrinsick
Light, kindled by a diligent Observation and Scrutiny into the outward
Grounds and Rules of Natural things, and so <HI>gradatim</HI> brought to Maturity.
For the better accomplishing whereof, are presently added the Means leading
to this Perfection, consisting in Acts, as well of the Operation as of the Will:
The Rule of both is call'd here Reason; which is, That we shall not desire
or will any thing, but what is consonant to Reason. Lastly, The Advanta∣ges
are set forth that accrue thereby; and that a double Perfection, of the
Body in the first place, and then of the Mind.</P>
<P>The second Sect, call'd <HI>Sciequia</HI> or <HI>Omtofe,</HI> is call'd by those of <HI>Iapan, Sciacca</HI>
and <HI>Amidaba.</HI> This Doctrine was brought out of the West among the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
in the sixty fifth Year before the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> from the Kingdom of <HI>Tienci</HI>
and <HI>Scinto,</HI> both which are known at this time by the general Name of <HI>Indostan,</HI>
and are situated between the Rivers of <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> History
mentions, That one of their Emperors was admonish'd in his Sleep, to send
Ambassadors thither for that Discovery, which (according to the over credu∣lous
humor of that Nation) believing, he accordingly did: They arriving in
the Country, and delivering their Message, were receiv'd with Applause, and
in convenient time return'd to their Prince with the Books, and some of the
best skill'd in those Languages, to Interpret them into the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue;
wherein are maintain'd several Opinions of the old Heathen Philosophers, as,
That there are several Worlds; The Transmigration of Souls; That three
Gods unite and grow in one Deity; That the Good shall be rewarded in
<FIGURE>
<PB N="190" REF="110"/>
</FIGURE>
Heaven, and the Wicked punish'd in Hell. Such as are great Admirers of this
Sect, reject a Married, and commend a Single Life.</P>
<P>If any among them be found to transgress their Rule, he is not only blam'd
and despis'd by all, but likewise severely punish'd: As a proof whereof, I
saw at <HI>Cunningan,</HI> a Priest whom they had found and taken amongst Light Wo∣men,
for which Offence they bor'd him through the Neck with a hot Iron, and
so hung upon him a Chain of ten yards long, with heavy Bars: And thus ac∣coutred,
he was led through the City, to the derision of all the People, till he
had begg'd ten <HI>Toel</HI> of Silver for the Benefit of his Cloister: He was not suf∣fer'd,
as he pass'd along, to bear up the Chain with his Hands to ease himself;
but it hung down loose behind him, so that the whole weight fell upon his
Neck. And that every Person might take notice of the Punishment, one of
his Brethren of the same Order follow'd him with a Whip in his Hand, and
lash'd him all the way he went upon his naked Body, till the Blood ran down
his Skin. This Spectacle going by the Ambassador's Lodgings, mov'd in them
so much compassion of his Misery, that they bestow'd on him a Largess to
help to pay his Ransom.</P>
<P>After a strange manner also are the Priests here Dress'd, being Cloth'd each
in a particular Habit: Some wear a long Gown upon the left side only,
black, with a four-square Cap or Bonnet upon their Heads, and a Chaplet
of Beads. Others wear another sort of Gowns and Caps, but as uncouth as the
former. But the most strange Garb is that of the Begging Priest, who has com∣monly
a Gown on of several Colours, and full of Patches: Upon his Head he
has a Cap, which on both sides hath long Feathers to defend him against the
Sun and Rain: In his left Hand he carries a Bell, upon which he continually
strikes till something is given him, or that you are gone out of sight. They
seldom go about Begging, but sit upon the Ground with their Legs across,
like our Taylors.</P>
<P>The Cloysters of these Priests are divided into several Apartments, accord∣ing
to their bigness; in each of them is also a Supervizor and head, in whose
Place his Scholars succeed after his Death. Each Head is diligent to contrive
as many Cells as he can for his Scholars, because they let them out to Travel∣lers
for a piece of Money at any time; so that indeed they serve as well for
Inns, or Hostries for Travellers, as Cloysters for the Brother-hood.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="110"/>
And though these Fryers live thus in a mean Condition, and contemptible;
as to the outward appearance, yet they are invited to Burials frequently, and
other Publick Ceremonies, as the making free of wild Deer, Birds, Fish, and
four-footed Creatures. Some of the greatest Sticklers of this Sect buy these
Creatures alive, with design only to set them at liberty; and in so doing their
Service is meritorious, and such for which they believe they shall be rewarded.
This Sect is very much increas'd of late years; and the greatest part of their
Followers are the <HI>Gelubden</HI> Women, with a company of other simple Crea∣tures.</P>
<P>The third Sect, call'd <HI>Lanzu,</HI> has its rise from a certain Philosopher, con∣temporary
with <HI>Confutius,</HI> of whom the Natives fancy, that he was carried
eighty years in his Mothers Belly before he was born; and therefore they
call'd him <HI>Lanzu,</HI> which signifies <HI>The old Philosopher.</HI> The Iesuit <HI>Martinus</HI> writes
in his fourth Book of the <HI>Chinese</HI> History, That he was call'd <HI>Lanxu Laotanus,</HI>
and taught, That there remain'd not any thing of us after we were dead, the
highest Happiness of a Man consisting in Pleasure; in imitation of <HI>Epicurus.</HI>
The Fable concerning his Birth, had its rise from the number Nine; for as this
number is held for the most perfect, and again multiply'd, makes eighty one;
so has Nature in the product of this famous Man, been so many years in Tra∣vel
and Labor. This Philosopher left not any one Book behind him of his
Doctrine, being unwilling, as it seems, to introduce any new Enthusiasms;
but after his Death his Sectators made a Collection of several Doctrines, out
of the Books of divers Sects, and compil'd them into one.</P>
<P>Those that are in their Cloisters live unmarried, and buy their Scholars,
but obtain among the People no respect, nor have any sense or fear of God
among themselves. Yet others of the same Gang betake themselves to a Mar∣ried
Estate, and live in a more orderly manner.</P>
<P>They Worship the Lord of Heaven, whom they represent in the Form of
a Man, and say that he has much wrong done him: yet beside him, they have
made to themselves two other Gods, whereof <HI>Lanzu,</HI> the Head of this Sect,
is one; so that these two Sects, though in a different manner, adore each three
Gods. By the Followers of this Sect is the Place describ'd where Men after
this Life are either rewarded or punish'd: but concerning these Matters, there
is between this and the foregoing Sects no small difference; for the Heads of
this Sect promise to their Tribe, that they shall possess Heaven with Soul
and Body: And the better to demonstrate the same, they expose to sight in
their Temples the Images of several People, who (as they say) went to Hea∣ven
in that manner: And the more certainly to obtain to this Happiness,
they teach their Followers several Postures and Prayers, and exhort them to
Deeds of Charity.</P>
<P>The Office of the Priest consists chiefly in dispossessing such Houses as are
infested or haunted with the Devil, by their ungodly Prayers and Curses,
which they effect commonly after this manner: They paint frightful Faces,
and Postures of Devils, upon Yellow Paper, and fix them to the Walls of the
House; then they bawl and skream so terrible loud, that they seem to be
like so many Devils themselves: And this is the utmost height of their Con∣juration.</P>
<P>There is another Office and Art which they ascribe to themselves; for they
boast, That in dry Weather they can cause Rain, and at their pleasure make the
same either to abate or cease again. And they profess to be skill'd in several
<PB N="192" REF="111"/>
other strange Arts (but in truth meer Delusions) wherewith they deceive the
whole Empire; yet notwithstanding, these Priests have their Residence in
the Royal Temples dedicated to Heaven and Earth, and are always assi∣stant
at the Offerings (whether the Emperor himself be there present in Person,
or only the Magistrates in his behalf) whereby they grow famous, and are had
in great esteem, not by the Common People alone, but the Grandees also; to
all whose Burials they are invited, and help to perform the Ceremonial part
of the Funeral, attir'd in very costly and rich Habits; and go before the Corps,
playing upon Flutes, and other Musical Iustruments.</P>
<P>All this Sect are under the Command and Iurisdiction of one Prelate, call'd
<HI>Ciam,</HI> whose Dignity always descends upon one of his Posterity, which hath
been observ'd for above a thousand years.</P>
<P>It seems that this great Dignity or Office had its first rise from a certain
Sooth-sayer, who liv'd in a Cave in the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> where his Po∣sterity
continue at present, and practise the Delusions of their Ancestors. This
their High-Priest <HI>Ciam</HI> is for the most part Resident in the Imperial City of
<HI>Peking,</HI> and very highly honor'd by the Emperor, having an allow'd Access
into the middlemost part of the Palace, to Bless and Consecrate the Rooms, if
at any time they are suspected to be haunted, or molested with Evil Spirits:
He is carried through the Street in an open Chair, in as great State as any of
the most principal Magistrates, and receives yearly a good Revenue from the
Emperor.</P>
<P>And thus I have given you a Description of the three Chief Sects in <HI>China,</HI>
out of which the ignorant and blind People have broach'd and set on foot so
many hundred sorts, differing from one another in point of Worship.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Humvuus,</HI> the first of that Race, that at the beginning of this
Age had the Soveraignty over <HI>China,</HI> gave express Command that those three
Sects, for the Defence and Honor of the Government, should be strictly ob∣serv'd,
by which he did infinitely win the Hearts of the Followers; but yet
though he mention'd all, he so order'd the matter, that the Sect of the Learned
only should haue a share in the managing the great Affairs of the Empire, and
also should have Authority over the other two: And this probably may be
the Reason why the one Sect doth not wholly endeavor to abolish and extir∣pate
the other; because the Emperor carries an equal hand to them all, re∣specting
the one as much as the other, and makes use of them alike, as he has
occasion; sometimes causing an old Temple to be repair'd, and sometimes a
new one to be built, for one or other of them, as he thinks it expedient. But
the Empress affects that Sect best that maintains the Worship of Images, and is
very bountiful to the Priests thereof, bestowing large Annuities, and great In∣comes
upon them.</P>
<P>The great number of Idols which are found in <HI>China</HI> is incredible; for not
only the Temples, and such like Places of Worship, are hung very full, but
also all Houses, Streets, Ships, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are adorn'd with them. And this is one of
the great Abominations that at first appears to all that come into <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst the rest, the Idol that represents <HI>Immortality,</HI> is in great Veneration,
whose Description is this: It is in the shape of a thick fat and Person, with
his Legs across, and a Belly that sticks at least two Foot out; on its right side
stands commonly a Stag, a Creature of a long life, looking upon his Lord
with a pleasant Countenance. The Image it self sits with his Hand in his
Sleeve, and his Doublet unbrac'd, so that his fat Body may be the better seen:
<FIGURE>
<PB N="193" REF="111"/>
</FIGURE>
His Looks are very grim and stately, and his Habit rich and Majestical. This
Image is the Patron for Travellers, and call'd upon by them when they make
any long Voyages, for Protection, Preservation, and Success in their Under∣taking.</P>
<P>The next is the Idol of <HI>Pleasure,</HI> which they call <HI>Minifo,</HI> and is compos'd
and made after the same manner as that of <HI>Immortality,</HI> but much bigger, being
commonly cast of Brass, hollow within and twenty Foot high; it carries a
very pleasant Countenance, and, like the former, is very thick and corpulent,
with a Belly sticking out; and that his gross, and fat Members may be the
better seen he sits with his whole Body almost naked.</P>
<P>Betwixt these, sitting in a Chair, is an Image thirty Foot high, made of
Plaister, having a Crown upon his Head, gilded all over, richly Apparell'd,
with several other strange Ornaments. They call this <HI>The great Kingang,</HI> and
give it a Respect in the highest manner.</P>
<P>Beside these there are two others; the one is the Goddess which at <HI>Linain</HI> (as
it is already related in our former Description) stand upon the Temple Dedi∣cated
to her; it is thirty Foot high, very richly gilded, and hath stood in that
Place ninety six years and upwards.</P>
<P>The other sits in a Chair richly adorn'd, resembling one of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Go∣vernors,
who had done his Country very good Service, for which they honor
him since his Death after this manner: At his Feet, as a sign of Victory, is
Pourtrayed a certain Country; and in his Hand, to shew his Authority, he
holds a Scepter.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> near to the noble City of <HI>Chaoking,</HI> in a well-built
Temple, stands another Statue of a certain Governor of a Province,
who had done his Country extraordinary Service six years together; and as a
return of thankfulness for the same, the Inhabitants, according to the Custom,
erected this Image and Temple, and Dedicated it unto him.</P>
<P>In <HI>Cuchiung,</HI> near to <HI>Hangan,</HI> there is a great Stone above a hundred Foot
high, call'd <HI>Xinxe,</HI> and signifies <HI>The Holy Stone,</HI> which they cover yearly quite
over with Gold, and then worship it. This piece of Idolatry was commanded
by the Emperor <HI>Mung.</HI></P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Cioking,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Xepao,</HI> is a great Stone Column,
<PB N="194" REF="112"/>
with the Image of the Idol <HI>Fe,</HI> and an Elephant, Lion, and Drum, cut out of
Stone, each of which is of several Colours; but whose workmanship they
were, or who brought the same thither, is altogether unknown.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> near to the Chief City of <HI>Chunking,</HI> is a very
strange great Hill upon the side of the River <HI>Feu,</HI> between this City and ano∣ther
call'd <HI>Tunchuen;</HI> and on this Hill is a mountainous Idol, call'd <HI>Fe;</HI> it is
made sitting with his Legs cross-ways, and his Hands clapt over one another
before him. How incredibly large the same is, may be guess'd at by this, that
Travellers can plainly see his Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Mouth, at two Miles
distance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Idol-Temples.</HEAD>
<P>ALL this Country doth infinitely abound with Idol-Temples, which
are built at very great Charge, and most commonly situate without the
Walls of their Cities, in solitary places; and in these the Traveller
may find Accommodations answerable to his desire. Adjoining to these Tem∣ples
stands commonly a Tower, with a smaller Edifice of the same kind, but
no less costly than artificially built. These Idolatrous Places are fill'd with
Images, and hung round with black Lamps, burning night and day, in me∣mory
of such who liv'd well, and died happily. When any Governors of Pro∣vinces
are to be admitted into their Offices, they are Sworn in these Temples▪
That they shall faithfully perform their Duties. I took an exact view of one
of these Structures, of which I thought it not amiss to give this following Ac∣count:
The sides of it were built with Timber, and the Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tyl'd; the
Floor was in some places Earth, and in other of gray Stone; and on each of
the sides stood several great Images in a row; but at the entrance was one most
dreadful to behold, being a Horn'd Devil, in a most terrible and frightful
shape, with a wide Mouth, and Hands like the Claws of a Griffin, in such a
posture as if it would have seiz'd those that entred. Within, in the middle
stood an Altar, upon which was erected another great Image thirty Foot
high; behind which stood a great number of small ones: Before the great
one there stood upon the Altar a thick hollow <HI>Bambo's,</HI> upon which was writ∣ten
some <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, that foretold things that should come to pass. On
the sides stood several Vessels with Incense burning, and in the middle was a
woodden Dish, with several Offerings in it, which the Priests, when they
would know or foretel any thing, bring to the Altar and Offer up to this
Image. Now the chief Offerings at such times, are either Rice, Wine, or the
Entrails of Beasts, which being ceremoniously dispos'd, the Priest draws some
Reeds out of the <HI>Bambo's</HI> Basket; and if they are in his opinion portentous of
Ill, he draws out others, till he has drawn such as he believes prognosticate
Good. In this interim the Incense burns, and at last the Priest falls upon his
Knees, and mumbles one thing or other to himself, whereby he intends to pa∣cifie
the Idol, and get him to favor his Suit.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> near to <HI>Chingting,</HI> is a very large and most mag∣nificent
Temple, a hundred and sixty five Foot high; within which stands a
thick and prodigious Image, a hundred six Foot and a half high call'd <HI>Quonin,</HI>
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="112"/>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="113"/>
<PB N="195" REF="113"/>
curiously wrought in the form of a Virgin. Behind this Temple is erected a
spacious Palace.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xansi,</HI> in the City of <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven,</HI> is a Temple Dedicated to
<HI>Siangus,</HI> the wisest of their Emperors, and of the Family of <HI>Chaus.</HI> It is reported
in their Histories, that this Image, which is made of very precious Stones,
being finish'd, rose up of it self, and went to the place which was appointed
for its Station.</P>
<P>At <HI>Leugan,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Peco,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Mountain of Fruits,</HI> is
founded a Temple in honor of the Emperor Xi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ungus; near which stands a
famous Well. Now (according to the Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of the <HI>Chineses) Xinnungus</HI> receiv'd
divers sorts of Seeds from an unknown Person, and receiv'd Directions in
what manner he should Sowe the same to gain a plentiful Harvest; which
he having experimented, taught to his Subjects: for which Benefit they erected
this Temple to his Memory at very great Charge.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> in the City of <HI>Hanchang,</HI> are five Temples, where∣of
one is Dedicated to the Emperor <HI>Cangleangus,</HI> because he had caus'd a Way
to be cut through the Mountain; and in perpetual memory of this his great
Undertaking this Temple was erected.</P>
<P>In the Chief City of <HI>Kingang</HI> are three Temples full of Images; and in the
Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> in the Chief City of <HI>Cinan,</HI> are several.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Yencheu,</HI> in the City of <HI>Ceu,</HI> are fifteen stately Temples, Dedicated
to <HI>Helvutius,</HI> and other renowned Heroes.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> in the Chief City of <HI>Chingtu,</HI> is one built to the
Memory of King <HI>Cancungus,</HI> because he taught the Inhabitants of that Kingdom
the Art of raising and preparing of Silk-worms.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> near to <HI>Kiun,</HI> is a large Hill call'd <HI>Vutang,</HI> up∣on
which are erected several Structures, with Cloisters for Priests; and the
reason thereof may be, for that here all Priests receive their Introduction, who
follow and teach the inward approv'd Doctrine of the separation of Soul and
Body.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> near to the Chief City <HI>Ningque,</HI> stands a very
high and beautiful Edifice call'd <HI>Hiangsin,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The well-scented Heart,</HI>
and Dedicated to five Virgins, who being assaulted by such as would have
ravish'd them, rather chose to die than have their Virginity violated: in ho∣nor
of whose Chastity the Inhabitants erected these Temples.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> and in the Chief City of <HI>Hangcheu,</HI> are found
very many of these Buildings, to which belong several thousands of Priests.</P>
<P>At <HI>Nanking,</HI> on the Mountain <HI>Ni,</HI> stands one of these Fabricks, that hath at
least a thousand Images to it, and to every Image ten Priests.</P>
<P>And indeed (to shorten this Relation) there is hardly a Mountain or Hill in
<HI>China</HI> of any Note, but has a Temple upon it, with Priests belonging to it.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> near to the City <HI>Cinggan,</HI> lies a great Hill call'd
<HI>Vay,</HI> which has several Temples and Cloisters upon it, abounding with
Priests and Fryers, most whereof worship Idols, shave their Crowns, and
despise all Earthly Riches, Possessions, and Honors. But that which is fullest
of admiration is this: It was said, that amongst these Priests, one of the chief,
call'd <HI>Chang,</HI> who had two Chappels under his Command, being convinc'd of
the Error of his Way, coming one day into his Temples, broke all the Idols
in pieces, exclaiming bitterly against the Priests, for having thus long deceiv'd
him, and keeping him in blind Ignorance; from thenceforth embraceing the
<HI>Christian</HI> Religion to the utmost period of his Life.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="114"/>
In the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> near to the City <HI>Civencheu,</HI> is a Temple call'd <HI>Caiy∣ven,</HI>
which is worthy of admiration, both for its heighth and largeness: The
outsides of this sumptuous Edifice are all of Marble, and the inside most richly
adorn'd with Idols of all sorts. Among others there are some that exceed,
which are either cast in Copper, or cut out of Marble, made for Madam <HI>Fee,</HI>
having such curiosity of Workmanship, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> say they were not
made with mortal Hands.</P>
<P>Without the Imperial City of <HI>Nanking</HI> I was my self in one of the three
Idol-Temples, where Hell (so as <HI>Virgil</HI> describes the same in the sixth Book of
his <HI>Aeneids)</HI> was so curiously Painted to the Life, and adorn'd with rare Ima∣ges
of Plaister, that it is enough to fill all Persons with admiration that look
upon the same.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Towers and Sea-Marks.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CHINA</HI> is very full of brave and well-built Towers, whereof some
are nine, others seven Stories high, many of which are only for Or∣nament;
but upon a great part of them call'd <HI>Ceuleu,</HI> stand their
Clock-workss and in others, especially at <HI>Nanking,</HI> are kept the Astrological
Instruments: Upon the Clock-house Turrets stands an Instrument, which
shews the hour of the day by means of Water, which running from one Vessel
into another, raises a Board, upon which is Pourtray'd a Mark for the time
of the day; and you are to observe, That there is always one remaining there,
to take notice of the passing of the time, who at every hour signifies the same
to the People by beating upon a Drum, and hanging out a Board with the
Hour writ upon it in large Letters. This Time-Drummer likewise gives no∣tice
if he discovers any Fire; whereupon the People all rise to quench it:
In whose House soever the Fire happens through carelesness, the Master there∣of
is punish'd with Death, because of the fright and hazard he put his Neigh∣bor
in, whose House joyning to his, and built all of Timber (as all Habitati∣ons
there are) was in very great danger of being likewise consum'd; for all
the Houses stand very close. And this in truth is the cause of so great severity
shew'd against such, whose Houses are burnt through carelesness.</P>
<P>Upon the top of the Mountain <HI>Hiaiken</HI> stands a very ancient Tower, which
is very much decay'd, but yet keeps the heighth of a hundred and eighty Paces;
but that which is most to be admir'd therein, is, that it is built of Stone, which
with infinite Labor, Industry, and Expence, they must bring thither, and then,
together with the Mortar, carry up so great a heighth to build such a Tower.</P>
<P>In the Country of <HI>Huquang,</HI> near to the City of <HI>Hanyang,</HI> is a Tower call'd
<HI>Xelonhoa,</HI> which far excels all other such like Structures in Art and Costliness.
It is said to have been erected upon this account: There was a certain Daugh∣ter,
who was worthy remark for her Obedience to her Mother-in-law; she
having one day a Pullet for Dinner, invited her Step-Dame to the eating part
of it; who accepting the Invitation, and coming to participate thereof, had
no sooner tasted of it, but she fell down dead: The Daughter was immedi∣ately
apprehended, brought before a Iudg, and accus'd of poysoning her
Mother-in-law, and the matter of Fact being so clear, was condemn'd to die:
<PB N="197" REF="114"/>
As she was going to the Place of Execution, she hapned to pass by a Pome∣granate-Tree
then in Blossom, which holding fast in her Hand, she Pray'd
(as is said) after this manner: <HI>If I have poyson'd my Step-Mother, may the Flowers
of this Branch now in my Hand wither; but if I be innocent, let the Branch live, and
bring forth Fruit immediately:</HI> Which words were hardly pass'd her Lips, before
that Branch which she held in her Hand hung full of Pomegranates. In re∣membrance
of which so famous Miracle the Inhabitants built this Tower, and
call'd it <HI>Xelenhoa,</HI> which signifies <HI>A Pomegranate-Tree.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> in the Chief City <HI>Hangcheu,</HI> are four of these
Towers, each of them nine Stories high; and in the great City <HI>Niencheu</HI> is ano∣ther
of the like heighth.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Vencheu</HI> lies a Hill call'd <HI>Paocai,</HI> upon whose top stands a
Tower nine Stories high, which serves for a Land-Mark to the Ships and Ma∣riners
Sailing at Sea.</P>
<P>Lastly, in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> near to the City of <HI>Hangcheu,</HI> lies a
Mountain call'd <HI>Funghoang,</HI> upon the top whereof stands a like Tower of nine
Stories high.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Triumphal Arches.</HEAD>
<P>MOst of the Cities in <HI>China,</HI> both small and great, are adorn'd and beauti∣fi'd
with Triumphal Arches, stately Towers and Pyramids, made of
Stone or Marble, with great Art, Cost, and Ingenuity, and adorn'd with Ima∣ges,
being generally erected in honor of some famous Act, Thing, or Person.
Those who have done their Country any signal Service, have some of these
set up to eternize their Memory, almost after the same manner as was formerly
practis'd by the ancient <HI>Romans.</HI> So also if any have been more excellent in
Learning, or if any Magistrate hath signaliz'd himself by his good behavior
in his Employment, in honor of such, Arches, Towers, Pillars, or Pyramids
are built, and commonly plac'd as Ornaments in the chiefest Streets, and most
populous places. Their fashion is this; they have three Roofs, the biggest in
the middle, and on each side a small one, underneath which Men pass as it
were through a very broad Gate; the sides are adorn'd with Lions and other
Images, curiously cut out of Marble, and fix'd thereto, or otherwise very arti∣ficially
bor'd through, and sometimes adorn'd with small Images cut out of
Stone; so that it is indeed a thing deservedly to be admir'd, which way they
can bore through such great Stones, and cut Images out of them, as they lie
fix'd in the Building. The whole Arch for the most part consists of three
Stories, and is on the Front and Back alike for fashion; so that when you
look upon the one side, you have in effect seen both sides. Upon the top of all
lies a blue Stone, upon which the Emperor's Name, in whose Government
the same was erected, is curiously Engraven in Letters of Gold: In the mid∣dle
also lies a very large flat Stone, upon which is writ in gilt or blue Letters,
the Name, Country, and Dignity of him in whose behalf this Edifice was
erected.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Rivers, Channels, High-Ways, Bridges, Ships, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THrough the Province of <HI>Suchue</HI> runs the River <HI>To,</HI> as far as <HI>Sinfan,</HI> being
a Branch brought from the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> by the Command of the
Emperor <HI>Ivos,</HI> to hinder the overflowing of that River.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang</HI> are most of the Rivers which come from the
North, made by Art so useful, as if they had been naturally so. It is highly to
be admir'd, and meriting the highest Commendation, to consider with what
labor and pains they have effected such vast Undertakings; for in some places
there are very large Channels, running far up into the Country, which have
been digg'd, and are pav'd on both sides with Stone: Over which Channels
lie many great and heavy Sluces, with several Bridges, convenient for Travel∣lers,
either by Land or Water.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ningpo,</HI> the ninth City of the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> both sides of the arti∣ficial
Rivers, for several Miles together, are made up with Stone: At the end
of every River lies a Sluce, through which all Vessels must pass before they
come into it,</P>
<P>In the Country of the City <HI>Xaohing</HI> is an artificial River toward the East,
three days Iourney in length, both sides whereof are made up with Brick, to
prevent the Earth from falling in, to choke or clog up the same.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Common Ways.</HEAD>
<P>THE common Passages, or High-ways in <HI>China,</HI> are contriv'd as much
for the convenience and ease of Travellers, as in any Place or the
World. We begin in the Southern Provinces, where most of their Ways <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
even and smooth, the very Hills being made passable, and a Way hewn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
through the Rocks by the labor of Mens Hands. Upon these so commodi∣ous
Ways, stand several Marks of Stone, which declare the Distances of Pla∣ces
from one another; and every ten Miles there is a Post appointed to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry
the Emperors and Magistrates Letters and Commands, which being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
receiv'd, are deliver'd with extraordinary speed; so that there happens no∣thing
in any part of the Country, but it is presently known through all the
Empire.</P>
<P>At every eighth Stone, which is a days Iourney, you have one of his Maje∣sties
ordinary Houses, built on purpose to receive and treat at the Emperors
Charge, all Governor's and Magistrates that travel that way upon the Empe∣ror's
Service; but before their Arrival they send a Messenger to certifie what
day they intend to be there; so that the Governor or Magistrate arriving, finds
all things in a readiness for him, to wit, Provisions, Horses, Chairs, Track∣men,
and, Vessels of all sorts, if he need any; for whatsoever he desires, is gi∣ven
notice of by him in a Letter.</P>
<P>The Banks of the Rivers are no less well contriv'd for the ease of Passengers,
than the common Ways; for they suffer no Trees to grow within eight Foot
of the Rivers side, lest they should be a hindrance to the Boats that are Tow'd
along by Ropes.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="115"/>
In the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> near to the City <HI>Hinghoa,</HI> the Ways are well and
strongly pav'd with Stone, for above four <HI>Dutch</HI> Mile in length.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Hoanting</HI> lies a deep, small, and darkish Valley, through
which runs a pav'd Way two Miles in length.</P>
<P>Upon the Mountain <HI>Mechi</HI> (which is in truth a Wilderness) lies a firm, but
very narrow Way, made by Art for Travellers to pass over; and upon <HI>Co</HI> is a
very steep Way, at least ten <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles.</P>
<P>Near to the City of <HI>Kiangxan</HI> there is a great Mountain call'd <HI>Civen,</HI> at least
three hundred Furlong in length, over which is the direct Road to <HI>Fokien,</HI> and
has several good Inns upon it for the Entertainment of Passengers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Bridges or Sluces..</HEAD>
<P>IN the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> over the River <HI>Guei</HI> lies three Sluces, namely, one
Easterly, the second in the middle, the third towards the West; all of them
built very strong, with many great and very high Arches of square Stone, cu∣riously
adorn'd, and carv'd with divers sorts of Images, as Lions, Dragons, and
the like.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> in the fourth Chief City <HI>Ganxin,</HI> are three Slu∣ces
of great bigness; but the third call'd <HI>Tiensing,</HI> that is to say, the natural
Sluce, is well nigh a thousand Rod long.</P>
<P>In the same Province, near to the City <HI>Hanchung,</HI> is a most admirable piece
of Work, so great a Master-piece in its kind, that the like thereof is hardly to
be found in the World, whose Description I will give you as follows: Between
this and the Chief City the Way was formerly altogether unpassable; and the
Inhabitants were constrain'd to fetch a great compass round, by reason of the
high and rough Hills, and steep Passages; sometimes necessitated to travel
toward the East, to the Frontiers of the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> and then again to
turn towards the North; so that they went at least two thousand Furlongs,
whereas the direct Way over the Mountains was not much more than five
hundred: wherefore at the end of the Race of <HI>Cina,</HI> when <HI>Licupangus</HI> made
War with <HI>Hiangyus</HI> for the Empire, all these steep Hills and Vales were levell'd
by order of <HI>Changleangus,</HI> the General of <HI>Licupangus,</HI> to make his Army with the
more ease to pursue the flying Enemy. And certainly, with great and incredi∣ble
labor and industry was this stupendious Work effected, in which he em∣ploy'd
no less than his whole Army, with at least a hundred thousand Men
more, by whose Labor a Way was at last perfected through the same.</P>
<P>On both sides of the Way are Walls made out of these Mountains, so high,
that part thereof toucheth the very Clouds, and thereby obscures the Passages
in some places. In others he caus'd Planks to be laid, to serve as Bridges to
pass over from one Mountain to another, on purpose to shorten the Way,
which is generally so broad, that four may ride abreast, and has Conveniences
enough to accommodate Passengers: And lest the People should by chance
receive any mischief as they pass over the Bridges, both the sides thereof are
Rail'd in from one end to another.</P>
<P>In the same Province, near to the City <HI>Chegan,</HI> is a Bridge call'd <HI>Fi,</HI> reach∣ing
from one Mountain to another, and having but one single Arch, which
is six hundred Foot long, and near seven hundred Foot high, through which
the <HI>Yellow River</HI> runs▪ It was three years in building, and is call'd by the
People, <HI>The Flying Bridge.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="116"/>In the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> in the City <HI>Queite,</HI> lies a Sluce made of four-square
Stone, over the Mere or Lake call'd <HI>Nan.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> near to the City <HI>Chyangang,</HI> is another Sluce of
Stone, having several Arches, erected by King <HI>Guei.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> in the little City of <HI>Gangin,</HI> there is a Bridge
worthy to be spoken of, and call'd <HI>The Bridge of Obedience</HI> and <HI>Subjection;</HI> the
Story of it goes thus: A Daughter of rich Parents Married a Husband who
soon after died; and in regard it is held in <HI>China</HI> a great dishonor to honest
Women to Marry the second time, she went and liv'd with her Father and
Mother, that by the enjoyment of their Company she might the better and
more easily forget the loss of her Husband: but not long after, her Father and
Mother hapned to die, by whose loss being left comfortless, she upon serious
debate within her self, laid out her Estate upon building of this Bridge, which
stands upon several Arches; and when she had finish'd it, being yet troubled
in her thoughts, she came early one Morning to take a view of the Structure;
which having done, and imagining her Memory would be Eterniz'd thereby,
she flung her self headlong into the River, where she was drown'd.</P>
<P>In the same Province, in the City of <HI>Cancheu,</HI> where the River <HI>Chang</HI> and <HI>Can</HI>
meet in one, is a very long Bridge, built upon a hundred and thirty Boats, fast∣ned
to one another with Chains, upon which lie the Planks and Timber that
compile the Bridge; one or two of which Boats are so contriv'd and order'd,
that they easily remove to open or shut, and so make passage for Vessels at
pleasure, after they have paid their Toll, for the receipt whereof there stands
a Toll-house at the foot of the Bridge.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> near the fifth Chief City <HI>Xinhoa,</HI> from the top
of the Mountain <HI>Fanguien,</HI> is a very large Bridge made over a Vale, which is
so stupendious a Work, that it fills all People with great admiration that ever
saw it.</P>
<P>In the same Province, in the City <HI>Luki,</HI> is a Bridge consisting of Stone
Pillars and Woodden Planks, which is a hundred Rod in length.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> in the Chief City <HI>Focheu,</HI> is a very stately Sluce of
a hundred and fifty Rod long, and half a Rod broad, built over an Inlet of
the Sea, of yellow and white Stone, with a hundred very lofty Arches, adorn'd
and beautifi'd with Sculpture of Lions and other Creatures. The like lies
near to the City <HI>Focing,</HI> and, according to the relation of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> is a hun∣dred
and eighty Rod long.</P>
<P><HI>In the second Chief City</HI> Civencheu <HI>may be seen a stately Bridge, call'd</HI> Lo∣yang,
<HI>the like whereof is hardly to be seen in the whole World, whose Descri∣ption
a certain</HI> Chinese <HI>Historian gives after this manner:</HI> Near to the City <HI>Bur∣rolilicum
(says he)</HI> lies over the River <HI>Loyang,</HI> the Bridge by some call'd also <HI>Lo∣yang,</HI>
but by others <HI>Vangang.</HI> The Governor of the City, nam'd <HI>Cayang,</HI> caus'd this
Bridge to be made, which is three hundred sixty Rod long, and half a Rod broad: Before
the erecting thereof People were Ferried over in Boats; but in regard every year several
Boats were cast away by foul Weather, the Governor, for the preservation and safety of the
Inhabitants, resolv'd to build this Bridge, which he did of black<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Stone; it rests not upon
Arches, but has at least three hundred large Pedestals or Columns of Stone made after the
fashion of Boats, which are sharp before, the better to withstand the force of the Current;
and to prevent any danger to such as pass over, the sides are Wall'd in with Stone to a good
heighth, and beautifi'd in several places with Images of all sorts, according to the fashion of
the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="116"/>
In the third Chief City <HI>Cangcheu</HI> there is to be observ'd another very stately
Bridge made of Stone, with thirty six very high and great Arches; it is so
commodiously broad, that Shops are made on both sides, and yet room
enough for Passengers either on Horse or Foot.</P>
<P>There are several other famous Bridges in many Ports and Cities of this
Empire, which to particularize, would take up too much time, and make this
Book swell into a larger Volume than was at first intended; therefore to pass
them by, we will proceed to give an Account of the fashion of their Ships.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Ships.</HEAD>
<P>THe Royal Ships, and those of the Governors of Provinces, exceed the
rest, and are built after such a manner, that few or none will scarce
give credit to the Account I shall give of them, unless they had seen them;
our Vessels in <HI>Europe</HI> being in no wise comparable to those, for they lie upon the
Water like high Houses or Castles, and are divided on both sides with Parti∣tions:
In the middle is a place like a Hall, furnish'd with all manner of
Houshold-stuff, as Tables, Chairs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Windows and Doors are made in
the fashion of our Grates, wherein, in stead of Glass they use the thinnest
Oyster-shells they can get, or else fine Linnen or Silk, which they spread with
clear Wax, and adorn with several sorts of Flowers; and this keeps out the
Wind and Air better than any Glass. Round about the Ships are made Galle∣ries,
very commodious for the Seamen to do whatever business they have,
without prejudice to the Rigging: The outside of the Ship is Painted with a
certain sort of Gum, call'd <HI>Cie,</HI> which makes it glitter, and appear very glori∣ous
at a distance, but within it is most curiously Painted with several Colours,
very pleasant and delightful to the Eye. The Planks and Timber-work are so
curiously rifted together, and jointed, that there is little or no sign of any Iron∣work.
In length they differ not much from those in <HI>Europe,</HI> only they are lower
and narrower, and the Passage up into them is by a Ladder twelve Foot long;
the Stern of the Ship, where the Trumpeters and Drummers stand, is like a
Castle. When any of these Ships of the Governors meet one another at Sea,
they Salute, and give place according to their Qualities, which are writ in
great Letters behind their Ships, so that there never happens any Dispute about
Precedency. When it is a Calm at Sea, and little or no Wind stirring to fill
their Sails (which are made of Mats) there are certain Men appointed to Tow
the same: At such time also, and as a farther help, they are very dexterous in
the use of their Oars, wherewith they can Row without pulling them out of
the Water.</P>
<P>The Ships which carry the Fish call'd <HI>Saull,</HI> and the Silks, to the Imperial
Court, are so extraordinarily curious and rich, that no others can compare
with them; for they are gilt within and without, and Painted red; and such
is their esteem, that all other Ships strike Sail, and give place to these, whenso∣ever
or wheresoever they meet them.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> near to the Chief City of <HI>Sucheu,</HI> may be seen
several Pleasure-Boats or little Ships, which the Inhabitants keep only for
their Pleasure; they are very richly Gilt and Painted, and may more properly
be compar'd to Houses than Ships: Some of the <HI>Chineses</HI> are so profusely in
love with them, that they will spend their Estates aboard these Vessels in Eat∣ing
and Drinking.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="117"/>
There are a vast and incredible number of Ships and Boats that pass daily
from one Place to another, by which means there is so great Accommoda∣tion
by Water, that Men may pass from the City of <HI>Maccao</HI> to the City of <HI>Pe∣king,</HI>
except one days Iourney by Water. Also Men may travel by Boat from
the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> through the whole Province of <HI>Suchue,</HI> from East to
West. And to say the truth, there is hardly any considerable City but what
has access to it by Water; for the Natives have with Art and Industry digg'd
Channels through most of the Provinces, and let in the Rivers, on purpose to
carry their Goods and themselves by Water, by reason of the extraordinary
Hills and Desarts which they meet with in a Passage or Iourney by Land; of
all which we have already made mention in our General Description of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> are such an innumerable company of Vessels, that
the Inhabitants proffer'd the Emperor, when he intended to make War upon
those of <HI>Iapan,</HI> to make him a Bridge of Boats, which should reach from thence
to the said Island of <HI>Iapan.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Courts of the Governors of Provinces.</HEAD>
<P>IN each Chief City are at least fifteen or twenty great Houses belonging to
the Governors; which is regard of the Magnificence of their Building,
may compare with Kings Palaces. In other less are eight or nine great Hou∣ses,
and in every small City four, which are all alike in fashion, only they dif∣fer
in largeness, according to the Quality of the Governor. At the Front of
each Palace are three Gates, whereof the biggest stands in the middle, adorn'd
on both sides with great Marble Lions: Next to this <HI>Plano,</HI> or Court-yard
Pail'd in, Painted with Gum, which they call <HI>Cie.</HI> In this <HI>Plano</HI> stand two
small Towers or Pyramids, curiously adorn'd, and furnish'd with several Mu∣sical
Instruments, upon which certain Persons play as often as the Governor
goes out or comes in. Within the Gate is a large Hall (and generally every
great Palace hath four or five) where the Governor gives Audience to any that
comes about Business to him; on the sides of this Hall are several small
Apartments inhabited by inferior Officers. Here are also two particular
Rooms for the Reception of Persons of Quality that come to visit the Gover∣nor;
when you are past these two Rooms, you come to three Gates more,
which are seldom open'd, but when the Governor sits upon the Bench of Iu∣dicature.
The middlemost of these Gates is very large, through which Per∣sons
of Quality are only suffer'd to go; other People pass through the Gates
on each side. Then you come to another large <HI>Plano,</HI> at the end whereof is a
great Court built upon Pillars call'd <HI>Tang,</HI> and here the Governor administers
Iustice; on Both sides thereof the Courtiers and inferior Officers have their
Dwellings, who never remove with the Governor, but live there continually,
in regard they are maintain'd at the Charge of the Country. Next to this is
an inward Court, but far exceeding the former, and is call'd <HI>Sutang,</HI> which
signifies <HI>Private;</HI> and in this Court only may the nearest Relations converse
with the Governor. To these Places appertain also several Gardens, Orchards,
Ponds, Rivers, Warrens, and the like, as well for Pleasure and Ornament, as
Profit. And here observe, That the Emperor furnishes the Governor not only
with these Palaces, but likewise with all manner of Houshold-stuff, Provisi∣ons,
and Servants, at his own Charge: And when a Governor (which is yet
more remarkable) happens to depart to the Rule of another Province, or else
<PB N="203" REF="117"/>
to lay down his Employment, which falls out commonly every half year, it
is allowable for him to take all the Houshold Goods with him, and then the
Court is to be furnish'd anew for the succeeding Governor.</P>
<P>In <HI>Cingtu,</HI> the first Chief City of the Province <HI>Suchue,</HI> famous for Trade,
there liv'd formerly a certain Great Prince or Governor of the Family of <HI>Ta∣minga,</HI>
who in Power and Imperial Title could only be said to give place to the
Emperor; for in all things else he liv'd like a King. This Kingly or Royal
Person had a large and stately Palace, which was at least four <HI>Italian</HI> Miles in
compass, adorn'd with four Gates, and stood in the middle of the City; be∣fore
it, toward the South, lay a large broad Street, full of costly and artificial
Triumphal Arches.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Hinghoa,</HI> the seventh Chief City of the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> at the foot
of the Mountain <HI>Chinyven,</HI> runs a large Water call'd <HI>Chung;</HI> on the side whereof
stands a large Palace containing ten Courts. In this Palace is a great Won∣der
taken notice of; for infallibly there is heard a noise against Wind or Rain,
like unto the sound of a Clock, of which (although diligently enquir'd after)
no natural reason can be given.</P>
<P>Concerning the incomparable, stately, and costly Structure of the Impe∣rial
Palace of <HI>Peking,</HI> I have already given a particular Description in my for∣mer
Relation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Rivers, Waterfalls, Lakes, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAving spoken at large of the chiefest things which the Hand or In∣dustry
of mortal Man has produc'd, we shall now proceed to particu∣larize
such things wherewith Nature has abundantly furnish'd the
<HI>Chineses</HI> out of her rich Store. Under which Name I comprehend Rivers, Pools,
Aquaducts, Hills, Wells, Earth, Plants, Trees, Animals of all sorts, and the
like, which are mention'd in the following Chapters.</P>
<P>First of all, There are in <HI>China</HI> two famous large Rivers, namely <HI>Kiang,</HI> and
the <HI>Yellow River.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Kiang,</HI> which is also call'd <HI>Yangeukiang,</HI> signifying <HI>The Son of the
Sea,</HI> divides all <HI>China</HI> into a Northern and Southern Tract: It flows from
West to East, and receives several Names, according to the Provinces through
which it runs: It was first call'd <HI>Minkiang,</HI> from the Mountain <HI>Min,</HI> whence it
hath its source. These Mountains stretch themselves Westward of the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Suchue,</HI> very far toward <HI>Prester Iohn's</HI> Country, and come towards the
North not far from the Chief City of <HI>Guei.</HI> After it is got from this Moun∣tain,
rushing forward with great violence, it divides it self into several Bran∣ches,
which turn and Wind through most of the Provinces. From the City of
<HI>Sincin</HI> it is call'd <HI>Sinkiang;</HI> afterwards receiving a great many Rivulets into its
Bosom, it runs before the City of <HI>Sui,</HI> into the River call'd <HI>Mahu.</HI> From the
City of <HI>Liucheu</HI> it receives the Name of <HI>Liukiang,</HI> and running from thence to
the City of <HI>Chunking,</HI> joyns with the great River <HI>Pa,</HI> and embraces its Name:
Being gotten beyond the City of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> it falls into the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI>
and regains not far from the City <HI>Kingcheu,</HI> the old Name of <HI>Sinkiang:</HI> Thus
far it runs with many crooked Meanders, and a great force of Water, through
<PB N="204" REF="118"/>
Vales, terrible Rocks, and dreadful Precipices, which the Natives knowing,
do avoid and shun with great dexterity. Being past the City of <HI>Kincheu,</HI> it be∣gins
by degrees to run more gently, and falls toward the North into the Mere
or Lake call'd <HI>Tungting,</HI> from whence it takes its course before the Chief City
in the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> and from thence to the Sea <HI>Foum,</HI> which is above a
hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles; and all this way it runs so gently, that Vessels may with
ease Sail against the Stream; and the ebbing and flowing of this River is ob∣serv'd
so far up in the Country, that it is in a manner wonderful to relate,
especially at the New or Full-Moon: In this place it is at least two Miles
over, watering and making fruitful the whole Province of of <HI>Nanking.</HI> And
lastly, being pass'd the Cities of <HI>Nanking</HI> and <HI>Chinkiang,</HI> it falls into the Ocean
it self, through a great Mouth, in which lies an Island and City well Guarded,
and provided with Soldiers and Ships.</P>
<P>The <HI>Yellow River,</HI> by Strangers so call'd from the colour of the Water, occa∣sion'd
by the yellowness of the Ground, is nam'd <HI>Hoang</HI> in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Lan∣guage,
and seems at first to be very Morish; but the swiftness and great force
of its running makes it appear quite contrary; for with so incredible a swift∣ness
doth this River run, that no Ships are able to Sail up against its Stream,
but are Tow'd along by the main strength of a great number of Track-men:
which may proceed from its being contracted within so narrow Bounds; for
in some places it is but half a Mile broad, and in others little more; but in
length it extends above eight hundred Miles. By this it appears, that this Ri∣ver,
next to that of <HI>Kiang,</HI> is the biggest and most famous of all <HI>China;</HI> and
though it is naturally no other than a Foreiner that has invaded the Country,
yet doth it not stand in fear of their Laws (which will not permit a Foreiner
to live among them) but as their Revenger insults over them, by often laying
their Country under Water in a most lamentable manner. The Hills <HI>Quenlun,</HI>
from whence it has its source, are in my opinion the <HI>Amazion</HI> Hills, being
situate not far from the Kingdom of <HI>Laor</HI> or <HI>Tihet;</HI> and that which is more,
the very Situation of those Places and Countries do demonstrate, that from
the same Hills the Rivers <HI>Ganges</HI> in <HI>Cengala, Mesor</HI> in <HI>Laor,</HI> and several other fa∣mous
Streams, which water the Parts of <HI>Sion</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> have their rise: for
the <HI>Chineses</HI> believe, and so report, That there are very many great Rivers
Southward, which take their rise from these Hills.</P>
<P>But to return whence we have digress'd; After this <HI>Yellow River</HI> is pass'd
beyond the vast Territories of <HI>Sifan</HI> and <HI>Taniju,</HI> which doth not in the least be∣long
to the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> it runs before the City <HI>Lingao,</HI> not far from ano∣ther
call'd <HI>King,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> in the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> to the place
where the <HI>Great Wall</HI> (made to prevent the Invasions of the <HI>Tartars)</HI> reaches to∣ward
the East, which it likewise washes; Then it runs with great fury, as
well toward the North as the East, by one side of the vast Wilderness call'd
<HI>Samo,</HI> at least two thousand Furlongs, and then turns toward the South, where
it passes through the Gate <HI>Se,</HI> which is in the Wall, and so divides the two
Provinces of <HI>Xensi</HI> and <HI>Xansi:</HI> Thence it runs into several other Provinces,
whereof I have formerly made mention in the Description of our Iourney to
<HI>Peking.</HI> The Water of this <HI>Yellow River</HI> is very thick and muddy, the Pople re∣port
it will not grow clear in a thousand years; and therefore when they speak
of any difficult Undertaking, they use as a proverbial Speech among them to
say, <HI>When the Yellow River is clear.</HI> But notwithstanding this Report of theirs,

<HEAD>Of Water-Shoots and great Falls of Water.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Province of <HI>Xansi,</HI> near to <HI>Pingiao,</HI> is a great Fall of Water, which
makes such a noise, that it is heard some Miles distant.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> hard by the Chief City <HI>Nanchange,</HI> is the Moun∣tain
<HI>Pechang,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Mountain of a hundred Rods,</HI> because the Waters
there run so far with great impetuousness.</P>
<P>In the River <HI>Chuem,</HI> which runs near to <HI>Xunking,</HI> through steep and cragged
Rocks, are thirty six great Water-falls, which continually rore with a most hi∣deous noise.</P>
<P>Near to the tenth Principal City of this Province, is a River call'd <HI>Xemuen,</HI>
or <HI>Heng,</HI> which runs with great boisterousness from a Water-shoot that falls
into it.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Yao</HI> in its Passage by the City <HI>Liniao,</HI> makes so great a noise, as if
it Thunder'd.</P>
<P>From the Mountain of <HI>Taye</HI> are Cataracts that fall with great force, at least
four hundred Rods.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Tau,</HI> is so plentiful a Water-fall, that it has caus'd a Mere
or Lake.</P>
<P>Near to the Chief City of <HI>Choxang</HI> is a River call'd <HI>Xangyung,</HI> wherein is so
great a fall of the Waters, that when at any time a Stone is but flung into it, it
causes Rain and Thunder; which may well be esteem'd a Prodigy.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Hoeicheu</HI> lies the River <HI>Singan,</HI> which has at least three hun∣dred
and sixty Water-shoots falling into it, between Vales and Rocks.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> near the City <HI>Tingcheu,</HI> is a River which runs to
<HI>Ienping,</HI> which hath many of these Water-falls, and dangerous Sands and Rocks,
insomuch that when any Vessels Sail down with the Stream, the Skippers, to
avoid Shipwrack, fling out great Bundles of Straw beforehand, which stop∣ping
against the Rocks, preserve the Vessels that strike against them from
beating themselves in pieces.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Kiegan</HI> lies the River <HI>Can,</HI> where the dangerous Rocks
call'd <HI>Xetapan</HI> take their rise; it is very hazardous to Sail down the River
from this City, by reason of blind Cliffs and Sands, which have destroy'd
many Vessels; for the Sands are not easily discoverable, the River running
with great swiftness over them; and therefore whatever Skippers Sail that
way, take with them always an expert Pilot from this City.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Ce</HI> lies the River <HI>Tan,</HI> which signifies <HI>Red,</HI> because the Wa∣ter
thereof looks like Blood. They report, that this Water was formerly very
clear and white, but that it receiv'd this colour by means of one <HI>Pei,</HI> a very
faithful Governor of his Country, who for some reasons unknown kill'd him∣self
upon the side of this River, and ever since the Waters have retain'd a
bloody tincture.</P>
<P>There runs a River before the small City <HI>Cu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Suchue,</HI> call'd
<HI>The River of Pearls,</HI> for that in the Night it glitters and sparkles as if it were full
of Precious Stones. Also before the City of <HI>Iungcheu</HI> runs the River <HI>Siang,</HI>
whose Water is of a Crystal clearness, so that though it be several Fathoms
deep, yet one may see plainly any thing that lies at the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="119"/>
Near to <HI>Foming</HI> runs a small River from the Mountain <HI>Talao,</HI> the Water
whereof turns blue in Harvest; at which time the Inhabitants wash their
Clothes in the same, to give them that colour, which it doth with as good ef∣fect
as any artificial Dyer could do.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Kiemo,</HI> near to <HI>Paogan,</HI> is said to have such an occult Quality, that
it will bear no Vessel of Wood, but as soon as it comes upon it, it sinks as sud∣denly
as if it vanish'd in the Air.</P>
<P>The like is the River <HI>Io,</HI> near to <HI>Kancheu,</HI> which is therefore call'd <HI>The Weak
River,</HI> because it will bear nothing that is heavy.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Chingtien,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Cucai,</HI> is a small River, whose Waters
are very sweet and well scented.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Choxan</HI> is the River <HI>Cungyang,</HI> whose Water takes Spots and Stains
out of all sorts of Cloths, and is so naturally cooling to the Air, that it tem∣pereth
the Heat of Summer; and therefore the Emperors of <HI>China</HI> have built
a Palace over this River, to which they frequently resort, to avoid the extraor∣dinary
Heats.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Kinxa,</HI> or <HI>The River of Gold,</HI> is so nam'd, because the Inhabitants
find great quantities thereof in the same.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Pezan</HI> runs the River <HI>Che,</HI> but more peculiarly call'd <HI>Ho∣anglung,</HI>
that is, <HI>The Yellow Dragon;</HI> for the Inhabitants fancy, that they saw a
yellow Dragon therein in the time of the Race of <HI>Hana.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Siangyn,</HI> which runs before <HI>Mielo,</HI> is famous, because it was the
occasion of the observation of the Feast <HI>Tuonu,</HI> which is observ'd and kept
through all <HI>China</HI> upon the fifth Day of the fifth Month, in memory of a cer∣tain
faithful Governor, who drowned himself in this River, to prevent some
Traitors that were plotting to take away his Life; he being a Man well be∣lov'd
by the People over whom he Rul'd, they to this day, as an honor to his
Posterity, and to continue his Fame, make great Entertainment.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> near to the City of <HI>Vucheu,</HI> runs the River <HI>Lieu∣fan,</HI>
from whence the <HI>Chineses</HI> fetch the Water which they use in Hour-glasses,
in stead of Sand, because this Water is of all others the least subject to altera∣tion
either of Time or Weather.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Kiegan</HI> is a River call'd <HI>Senting,</HI> which signifies <HI>A Pipe or Flute,</HI> be∣cause
the Water running very swift through Cliffs and stony places, makes a
very musical and delightful noise.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Xincheu</HI> is the River <HI>Xo,</HI> which doth infallibly cure several sorts of
Diseases.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> near the Chief City of <HI>Hangcheu,</HI> runs a River,
which in regard of its Course, is call'd sometimes <HI>Che,</HI> sometimes <HI>Cientang,</HI> and
in some Places <HI>Cingan.</HI> This River causeth upon the eighteenth Day of the
eighth Month, such a very high Tide before this City, that it extremely puz∣zles
the Philosophers themselves to find out the meaning, or give the reason
thereof; for upon that Day the Water riseth Higher than at any other time
of the Year: by reason of which so very famous is this Day, that the whole
City about four a Clock makes toward the River to behold the wonderful
Operation.</P>

<HEAD>Of Springs, Wells, and Fountains.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>Chinting,</HI> the fourth Chief City of the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> lies a Mere,
which hath its rise from two Springs; the Waters of the one are very hot,
the other cold, and yet they lie but at a small distance asunder.</P>
<P>Upon the Hill <HI>Ganlo,</HI> near to the City <HI>Iungchang,</HI> is a Stone in the form of a
Mans Nose, and from his Nostrils arise two Springs, whereof the one is warm,
the other cold.</P>
<P>In <HI>Tengcheu,</HI> the Chief City of the Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> is a Spring call'd
<HI>Hanuen,</HI> which is a Miracle in Nature, for it bubbles forth Water both hot and
cold at the same time, which separate and divide themselves.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> in the City of <HI>Lincheng,</HI> is a Fountain as clear as
Crystal, being scarcely five Foot deep, yet the top thereof is very cold, but
the bottom so hot, that there is no enduring to touch it with ones Foot.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi</HI> is a Spring, the one half whereof is clear, and the
other muddy; although any Person take of the Waters and mingle them, yet
nevertheless they immediately part and divide, each receiving presently their
former Colours.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Iungping</HI> is a Spring whose Water is so hot, that it will boil an Egg.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Hiqoy</HI> is a Hill call'd <HI>Caotung,</HI> upon which are several warm
Baths and hot Springs.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Iungcheng</HI> is a Hill call'd <HI>Gailo,</HI> upon which is a very deep Well,
which serves the Inhabitants, by observation of its rise or fall, for a sign of a
fruitful or barren Year.</P>
<P>There are several other Springs and Waters in many other Places of <HI>China,</HI>
which are very remarkable for their Qualities, and have great esteem among
them, because they have had sufficient experience of their Vertues; wherewith

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Hills and Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>VEry curious, and indeed nice, even to Superstition, are the <HI>Chineses</HI> in
the choice of Hills; for they say and believe all their Fortune depends
upon it, being places inhabited, as they imagine, by Dragons, unto
whom they attribute the cause of all their good Fortune: And for this cause,
when any of them intend to erect a Tomb (which is generally done among
the Mountains by rich People) they diligently examine the shape and nature of
the Hill for its situation, and are very sollicitous to discover a happy piece of
Earth; and such they esteem so which has the resemblance of the Head, Tail,
or Heart of a Dragon; which once found, they imagine that according to
wish, all things shall go well with their Posterity. And this Fancy is so gene∣rally
prevalent with them, that there are many who profess the Art of telling
Fortunes by the form of Hills.</P>
<P>In the Description of Hills and Mountains, I shall not only mention their
largeness, heighth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but likewise their Nature, Shape, Form, and the
Beasts that live upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="120"/>
The Mountain <HI>Lungciven,</HI> near to <HI>Kungyang,</HI> is about two Miles and half

<P><HI>Suming,</HI> near to <HI>Xaohing,</HI> fills a place of seven Miles and a half.</P>
<P><HI>Lofeu,</HI> near to <HI>Polo,</HI> is in its circumference eighteen Miles and a half.</P>
<P><HI>Tiengo,</HI> near to <HI>Pinkiang,</HI> is thirty one Miles in extent; so also is the Moun∣tain

<P>The <HI>Heng,</HI> near to <HI>Hoenyuen,</HI> is fifty Miles large.</P>
<P>The <HI>Yen</HI> begins at <HI>Iotyen,</HI> and teaches sixty three Miles in length.</P>
<P>At <HI>Kinhoa,</HI> near to <HI>Yu,</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Kiming,</HI> which is the largest in ex∣tent
of all the Mountains of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ximus,</HI> near to <HI>Taigan,</HI> is three Miles and a half high: It is said, that
upon the top thereof, at the first Crowing of the Cock, the Sun may be seen
to rise.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tientai</HI> is five Miles high.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vempi,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> reaches with its top above the
Clouds.</P>
<P>At <HI>Sintien</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Pie,</HI> which is the highest of all Hills, and rea∣ches
far above the Clouds.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Xefan</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Tafung,</HI> which seems to touch the
very Skies.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Cangki</HI> is a very high Mountain call'd <HI>Iuntai,</HI> which they entitle <HI>The
Throne of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hocang</HI> is so high, that it ascends ten thousand Foot above the Earth,
and never any Rain or Snow was seen to fall upon it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kiming,</HI> near to the City <HI>Yn,</HI> requires nine days Travel to the top of it.</P>
<P>In <HI>Quangsi,</HI> near the City <HI>Ieyang,</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Paofung,</HI> whose top rea∣ches
to the very Clouds, and yet hath a Stone House built upon it.</P>
<P>There are very many other wonderful Hills and Mountains in the Provin∣ces
of <HI>China,</HI> which we shall omit to mention for brevity sake, and shall pro∣ceed
to speak of their Shapes and Nature.</P>
<P>The Hills of <HI>Umuen</HI> show as if they hung in the Air.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi</HI> is a Hill which bears the shape of an Elephant.</P>
<P>The Mountain <HI>Utung</HI> resembles the shape of a Man standing upright, with
his Head bowing downward.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Paoki</HI> is a Hill call'd <HI>Chincang,</HI> whose concave parts are such, that
before stormy Weather or Thunder it will rore in so fearful a manner, that the
noise may be heard two Miles.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Sinyang</HI> is a very high and pleasant Hill, whose top against Rain is
always cover'd with a Cloud.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Pingchai</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Pequi,</HI> of which it has been observ'd, that
the melting of the Winter Snow upon its top is a sign of a plentiful Year; but
if it continues all Summer unmelted, it is a bad sign.</P>
<P>Upon the Mountain <HI>Kesin,</HI> near to the Garrison-Cities, it is extraordinary
cold.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Nanking</HI> is a great Hill nam'd <HI>Quanglin,</HI> which in the fairest Weather
is always so very much cover'd with Clouds, that it is hardly to be seen at any
little distance.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Xaicheu</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Lingfung,</HI> upon which if any Rain do fall
in the day-time, a great flame of Fire appears in the Night, but in dry Wea∣ther
there is seen no such appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="120"/>
The Mountain <HI>Hoo</HI> is call'd <HI>The Fiery Mountain,</HI> because in the night-time cer∣tain
Lights appear upon the same, as so many burning Candles: Country
People speak them to be a sort of Glow-worms, which creep out of the River
by Night, and shine after this manner.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Munghoa</HI> lies the Mount <HI>Tienul,</HI> call'd <HI>The Ear of Heaven,</HI> famous for
a notable Echo.</P>
<P>The Mountain <HI>Quan</HI> is stor'd with brave Hawks and Kites, which the Great
Ones use for their Recreations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Historians relate, That near to <HI>Sinfung</HI> lies a very great Hill,
upon which such wild Beasts and Men live, whose likes are not to be found in
any other Place.</P>
<P>Upon the top of the Hill <HI>Fungcao</HI> (as is said) the incomparable and seldom
seen Phenix hath her Nest, under which is found an extraordinary Precious
Stone.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Holan,</HI> is a great Race of wild
Horses; and upon that of <HI>Liniao</HI> breed several wild Oxen, Tygers, and other
Creatures.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Cutien,</HI> an incredible thing
to be told, are Tygers who have left off their fierceness, the nature of the Soil
being of that Quality, that if any are brought thither wild from other Places,
they become tame in a short time: the same thing happens to Snakes.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Cinyven,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Iunnan,</HI> is the Mountain <HI>Nilo,</HI> where is
great abundance of Tygers and Leopards.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchue,</HI> near to <HI>Cungkiang,</HI> upon a Mountain call'd <HI>To∣yung,</HI>
are Monkies which very much resemble a Man.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Changcheu</HI> lies the Hill <HI>Cio,</HI> upon which is said to lie a Stone
of five Rod high, end eighteen Inches thick, which of its self rolls and moves
up and down against foul Weather.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Lioyang,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Yoinea,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Mountain of
the Rich Woman,</HI> is to be seen a Statue of a very beautiful Woman, not made by
Art, but grown there naturally.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Iengan,</HI> in a certain hollow place of the Mountain <HI>Ching∣leang,</HI>
is to be seen a whole Herd of strange Idols, to the number of above a
thousand, being Images cut out of one hard Stone, and made by the Command
of a King, who liv'd all his Life here in solitariness.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Vucheu,</HI> upon the Hill <HI>Vangkiu,</HI> stands a strange Image, in shape
and proportion resembling a Man, but attended with this peculiarity, that
according to the several tempers of the Air, it receives several colours; by the
change whereof the Inhabitants know whether they shall have fair or foul
Weather.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Xius</HI> employ'd five thousand Men to dig a Passage quite
through the Mountain <HI>Fang;</HI> for he had heard of the before-mention'd de∣ceitful
Mountain-gazers, who promise to foretel every Persons Destiny by
the shape of the Hills; some of whom had given out, That they foresaw by
this Hills shape, that another Emperor should reign; wherefore <HI>Xius,</HI> to fru∣strate
his approaching Fate, caus'd this Hill to be cut through to alter its
shape.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Cing,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Loyo,</HI> stands the Statue of a great
Lion, out of whose Mouth gushes Water continually.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Xeu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> upon the Hill <HI>Cuking,</HI> was
<PB N="210" REF="121"/>
found a great lump of Gold, which they say had the Vertue of curing several
Diseases.</P>
<P>The Hill <HI>Kieuquan</HI> is call'd <HI>The Hill of seven Palaces,</HI> because the Sons of King
<HI>Cyugan</HI> caus'd seven Palaces to be built upon it, in which they resided, and stu∣died
several Sciences.</P>
<P>The Hill <HI>Lin,</HI> near to the City <HI>Tauleu,</HI> is very famous for the expert Archery
of one <HI>Hevyus,</HI> who in this place shot seven Birds flying, one after another.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Ceu</HI> is the Mountain <HI>Changping,</HI> very much noted for the
Birth of the great and admir'd Philosopher <HI>Confutius.</HI> Here also may be seen
the Ruins of some City or Town that formerly stood upon it.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Kioheu</HI> lies the Hill <HI>Fang,</HI> not a little frequented, by rea∣son
of the Tomb of the Ancestors of <HI>Confutius.</HI></P>
<P>The Hill <HI>Kieuchin,</HI> near to <HI>Hanyang,</HI> has its Name from nine Virgins that
were Sisters, and liv'd thereon, studying Chymistry.</P>
<P>Near to the City <HI>Cu</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Cu,</HI> where Report says King <HI>Ci</HI> bu∣ried
much Gold; and afterwards, because he would not have it discover'd,
put to death all those that were employ'd in hiding it; but by chance a young
Son of one of the Workmen taking notice of what his Father was doing,
and bearing the same in mind, when he came to years of discretion went and
took it away, with the cause of his Father's Death felicitating his own Life.</P>
<P>Upon certain high Hills of the Province of <HI>Suchue,</HI> where it borders upon
the Province <HI>Honan,</HI> lies a Kingdom call'd <HI>Kiug,</HI> absolute of it self, and no ways
subject to the Emperor's of <HI>China;</HI> only upon the account of Honor, and the
maintaining of a good Correspondence, the King thereof receives from the
<HI>Chinese</HI> Monarch his Crown and Scepter. These <HI>High-land</HI> People will in no
wise suffer the <HI>Chineses</HI> to come amongst them, and very hardly to speak to them.
The People of this Kingdom are the Issue of them who fled out of the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Huquang,</HI> to avoid the Outrages of the Enemy of the Race of <HI>Cheva,</HI>
and betook themselves to these high Mountains for safety, where ever since
their Posterity hath continu'd, possessing innumerable brave Vales, and in∣comparable
good Lands, which are secur'd against the Invasion or Inroads of
any Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon some of the Mountains in <HI>China</HI> are great store of wild People, who
by reason of the narrow and difficult Passages to them, are not to be brought
under Subjection to the Emperor, notwithstanding great Endeavors have been

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Mines of all sorts, as Metals, Stones, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>VVIthin the spacious Continent of this Empire, and chiefly upon the
Mountains, are found many rich Mines, as well of Silver and
Gold, as other Metals, in great abundance; yet to dig for Gold
or Silver out of any of them, is forbid, although it remains free for any Person
to seek for Gold upon the sides and Banks of Rivers, where the same is also
found in great quantities, with which all the Country drive their Trade, by
Bartering and Exchanging it away for other Commodities.</P>
<P>Upon the Mountain <HI>Yocheu</HI> is digg'd up a green Stone, which being beaten
<PB N="211" REF="121"/>
to Powder, affords the Painter a most delicate Vert. There are also several
excellent Stone Quarries, among which, some of Marble, whereof they make
Tables, and other curious Ornaments for their Houses, it having such strange,
yet natural Veins, that by their concentring, the shapes of Hills, Waters,
Trees, Flowers, are so admirably figur'd upon the same, as if the most exqui∣site
Artist of the World had depicted them with his Pencil.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Peking</HI> is found very clear white and red Marble, as also
Touchstones, and several other sorts of Stones, which for colour and hardness
are much valued. And upon the Mountain <HI>Xaitung,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xansi,</HI>
the Iasper of several colours is found; as also in <HI>Xensi,</HI> upon the Hill <HI>Io,</HI> are
very clear Stones, which for their lustre and sparkling resemble Diamonds.</P>
<P>Out of Mount <HI>Kiun</HI> is digg'd red Marble.</P>
<P>In <HI>Suchue,</HI> on Mount <HI>Tiexe,</HI> grows a Stone, which being burnt in the Fire,
yields Iron very fit to make Swords.</P>
<P>The Hill <HI>Cucay,</HI> near <HI>Chingtien,</HI> brings forth Trees and Stones red of colour;
and in the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> all the Products of the Hill <HI>Hoan</HI> (which sig∣nifies
<HI>The Yellow Hill)</HI> even to the Earth and Stones, are of a Gold colour.</P>
<P>There are several other Hills which produce strange and Precious Stones,
as the Hill <HI>Xeyen,</HI> so nam'd, because after Rain there are found Stones upon
the same resembling Swallows. Many other produce variety of Stones, held
in great Esteem by reason of Experiments which have been made of them in
the cure of several Diseases, as all sorts of Agues, Fevers, Calentures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
And as in some places are such variety of rare and Physical Stones, so in others
are Earth and Medicinal Drugs; namely,</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> near to the City <HI>Cincheu,</HI> is digg'd up a certain
yellow Earth, which is a powerful Antidote against all manner of Poison.</P>
<P>In the Iurisdiction of <HI>Huquang</HI> there are several Places where they gather
great store of Manna, which the Natives take for frozen Dew.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xansi,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Tape,</HI> they dig up a certain
Earth so red, that they use it for Vermilion to Print their red Seals; whereas
upon the Mountain <HI>Nieuxu</HI> the Earth is so white, that it is us'd by the Women
in stead of Paint; for being dissolv'd in Water, it strangely embellisheth the
Face which is wash'd therewith. Here also they have Mines of Coals, which
are like those in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There is also in divers Places throughout the whole Empire, a certain sort
of Lime, which they press from the Bark of a Tree, being tough, and sticking
like Pitch; of this, which I suppose I may call a Gum, they make a certain
sort of Paint, wherewith they colour all their Ships, Houses, and Houshold-stuff,
which makes them to shine like Glass; and this is the reason that the
Houses in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Iapan</HI> glitter and shine so bright, that they dazle the Eyes
of such as behold them. This Paint also lays a shining colour upon Wood,
which is so beautiful and lasting, that they use few or no Table-cloths at their
Meals; for if they spill any Grease, or other Liquor upon the Table, it is ea∣sily
rubb'd off with a little fair Water, without loss or damage of Colour.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Roots, Herbs, Flowers, Reeds, Trees, and Fruits.</HEAD>
<P>THE vast and large Territories of this Empire, which reach not only
very far from East to West, but also from South to North, occasion∣eth
that in no part of the Universe so great a variety of Fruits is pro∣duced;
the true and natural cause whereof is the several tempers of the Air
(which must of necessity be granted in so immense Territories) it being by ex∣perience
known, that some grow best under a hot Climate, others under a
cold, and some under a well temper'd Air; all which are to be found in this
Country.</P>
<P>The Learned among themselves have describ'd at large in their Books what
each Province doth produce; by the view whereof, and other particular Re∣lations,
this may be affirm'd for truth in general, That all things necessary for
the sustenance of Man, as well as for delight, are to be had there in great abun∣dance,
without being beholden to their Neighbors. And thus much I dare
from my own knowledge affirm, That whatever is to be had in <HI>Europe,</HI> is like∣wise
found in <HI>China;</HI> and if in truth there want any thing, Nature hath supply'd
that single defect with divers other things beyond those we have in <HI>Europe.</HI>
Now that it may be obvious to every Understanding, with what a copious
Harvest of Fruits and Vegetables mild Nature has bless'd this Empire, and
the Inhabitants thereof, I shall briefly discourse thereof as followeth.</P>
<P>In <HI>Iungping</HI> (the Chief City of the Province of <HI>Peking)</HI> grows a very excel∣lent
Root, and of great esteem, call'd by them <HI>Ginseng,</HI> but by the Islanders of
<HI>Iapan, Nisi:</HI> The reason of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Name seems to be deriv'd from its shape,
in regard it artificially resembles a Man; It is not much unlike to the Man∣drake
of <HI>Europe,</HI> only it is much less; neither do I much doubt but it is a sort
of Mandrake, in regard it has the same shape and vertue. This Root being
dried is yellow of colour, and sweetish of taste; but being chew'd, it seems to
be mingled with a little bitterness: it is a great enlivener of the Spirits of a
Man, and therefore such as are of an hot and strong Constitution, endanger
their Lives by using it, in regard of its strengthning Nature and Quality;
whereas Persons weak and feeble through Sickness or otherwise, find great ad∣vantage
in the use thereof; for such is the soveraign Vertue of this Root, that
it has recover'd some that were brought to Deaths door; for which its most
rare Qualities it is become of so great Price, that it is commonly sold for thrice
its weight in Silver.</P>
<P>This Root also hath made notable the City of <HI>Leao,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xansi;</HI>
which Province produces abundance of incomparable medicinal Roots and
Herbs, especially <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> which doth not grow wild, as some report, but is
rais'd and increas'd with great care and diligence: The Root is not hollow,
but very firm and knotty, the leaves thereof in some sort resembling our Cab∣bage-leaves,
but much bigger. The <HI>Chineses</HI> make a Hole through the Roots,
and hang them to dry in the shade; for the Sun-beams extract their Vertue
from them. From hence, and from <HI>Suchue,</HI> comes for the most part all the
<HI>Rhubarb</HI> which is brought into <HI>Europe</HI> by Sea, or through the Kingdoms of <HI>Cas∣car,
Tebet, Mugor,</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI> Ignorant therefore altogether are they in Affairs,

that will have <HI>Rhubarb</HI> to grow in those Parts, whereas in truth we only re∣ceive
it from thence; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they buy it of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and drive a Trade there∣with
into <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Queicheu,</HI> near to <HI>Liping,</HI> grows the best Root of <HI>China;</HI> there is of two
sorts, the true and counterfeit, yet both natural; the true grows near to this
City, and in other Places the counterfeit, or, to speak more properly, the
wild Root, and is that which is brought generally into <HI>Europe:</HI> It is of a red∣dish
colour within, but neither so big, nor of so great Vertue as the true, which
grows and increases under Ground, almost after the manner of Potatoes in
<HI>India,</HI> and especially in old Pine-tree Woods, from whence they say this Root
proceeds, first of all from the Gum or Iuice of the Pine-tree, which falling
upon the Ground, takes Root, and brings forth an Herb, which by degrees
spreads it self upon the Earth, and grows under Ground with knotty Roots,
in shape, bigness, and colour, not unlike to the <HI>Indian</HI> Coco-Nuts, but thinner
and softer, which they use in several Medicines. This Root was first known
in <HI>Europe</HI> in the Year 1535. when the <HI>Chineses</HI> brought the same to be sold in
the City of <HI>Goa</HI> in <HI>India;</HI> and although the like Root may grow in other parts
of <HI>India,</HI> as also in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> yet is it much inferior in goodness to that of
the <HI>East;</HI> the best whereof is tastless, heavy, sound, and firm.</P>
<P>This Root hath a particular Vertue, according to the Relation of <HI>Garcias,</HI>
for the Cure of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Pox, and is soveraign against the Itch, Tremblings,
Aches, Gout, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is also very good for a weak Stomach, Headache, the
Stone in the Bladder proceeding from Cold.</P>
<P><HI>Acosta</HI> gives this Description of the <HI>China</HI> Root, That whosoever useth the
same for the cure of the Pox, may eat all manner of Food, either Flesh or Fish,
without any hurt to themselves, or to the Operation of the Medicine; which
by the <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> is thus us'd: They take two Ounces of the Root,
and half an Ounce of Parsly, and boyl it in two Quarts of Water, to a third
part, which they reserve in a Pot for use; and when any are sick, they drink a
good Draught, and then go and lie down upon their Bed, covering themselves
warm; two hours before Supper they drink another Draught: but for their
daily Drink they take it cold. Some take every Morning and Evening the
fourth part of an Ounce of it beaten small, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t into Wine; which is so
<FIGURE>
<PB N="214" REF="123"/>
</FIGURE>
innocent in operation, that they may go abroad about their Affairs without
any inconvenience.</P>
<P>Here grows also great store of Ginger in this Country, so purely, and with
such celerity, as exceeds all in other Countries; though it is true, in several
other Parts there is great store of Ginger to be had, as at <HI>Bengala,</HI> and upon
the Islands <HI>Molucco, &amp;c.</HI> which is for the most part brought into <HI>Europe.</HI> Of this
Root there are two sorts, Male and Female; which last is smaller of Leaf and
Root than the first; the Leaves are very like those of Reed, so that whosoever
never saw any Ginger grow, would take them to be Reeds. The Leaves of the
Male sort, through which run some greater Sinews or Veins, rise not much
higher than three Foot above Ground: The Roots are of several weights and
bigness, whereof some have the length of four Spans, full of Knots, and shoot∣ing
not deep into the Ground, but like Reeds grow upon the surface of the
Earth, and are digg'd out of the Ground when the Leaves are wither'd, which
is about the middle of Summer: when they take them up, they break off a
piece, and fling it into the Ground again for an increase. The Roots fresh ta∣ken
up, by reason of their abounding moisture, are not so hot of taste as the
dried, which are laid a little into the Sun to harden; thus prepar'd, they fling
Mold or Clay upon them, to prevent them from being Worm-eaten, which
this Root is very subject to; it increases very fast, as do all other Spices which
grow in such Places as lie near the Sea. And though the <HI>Chineses</HI> and others
Plant Ginger amongst the rest of their Herbs, yet however it grows also wild,
but falls short of the goodness of that which is cultivated. When they intend
to prepare this Commodity for Sale, they first pare it, and then put it imme∣diately
into Pickle or Vinegar for an hour or two; afterwards they take it out,
and lay it in the Sun to dry for the like space; then they take it again into the
House, put it up into a dry place, and there let it lie till all the moisture is
drawn out; which done, they put it into Pickle, with good store of Sugar:
And this kind of ordering makes it pleasant to the Pallat, and abates much
of its heat. And this is generally known by the name of <HI>Green-Ginger,</HI> which
as a Sallet is us'd by the <HI>Chineses</HI> among other Herbs. It is very soveraign for
several Distempers, as pain in the Belly, Cholick, Flux, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but Persons of a
hot Constitution ought to use it moderately, it being apt to inflame the Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="123"/>
Most of the Provinces of <HI>China</HI> abound as well in all manner of Eatable, as
Medicinal Herbs. We will descend a little to Particulars.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> near to the chief City <HI>Kingyang,</HI> grows a Herb
call'd <HI>Kinsu,</HI> which for its resemblance to a Tuft of yellow Hair, the <HI>Chineses</HI>
call <HI>The Golden,</HI> or <HI>The Gold Thred of Silk-Worms;</HI> it is of a bitter taste, and ra∣ther
of a cooling then warming Quality; it cures all manner of Scurf of
the Body.</P>
<P>Here also grows another Herb call'd <HI>Quei,</HI> good against Melancholy, and
occasioning joy and gladness of Heart, if taken inwardly.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Cingcheu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> lie some Islands, wherein
grows an Herb call'd <HI>Lungsiu,</HI> which makes Horses strong and swift if they eat
of the same.</P>
<P>Also near the same City grows <HI>The Herb of a thousand years,</HI> so commonly
call'd; but they farther affirm of it, That it is immortal, and never dies. The
Water wherein the same has been infus'd, being drank, makes white Hair
black, and is very good to prolong Life. There are besides these several other
incomparable Herbs, which are us'd amongst them for the cure of Distempers
of all sorts.</P>
<P>In the Kingdom of <HI>Tanyeu</HI> grows a certain Herb very high amongst the
Rocks, which will not burn when flung into the Fire, and there kept for some
time; only it will turn a little red, but as soon as out of the Fire, presently
recovers its pristine and natural colour; yet although it resist Fire, it immedi∣ately
turns to Dirt being put into Water.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> near to <HI>Kiunchen,</HI> grows the Herb <HI>Chifung,</HI> so
call'd, because it shews which way the Wind blows; the Seamen say they
can discover by the same what stormy Weather they shall have, before they
go to Sea.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> near to <HI>Chincheu,</HI> the Inhabitants make a kind of
Cloth of a certain Herb call'd <HI>Yu,</HI> which is esteem'd far before Silk, and much
dearer.</P>
<P>But in the Province of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> near to <HI>Liping,</HI> they make Cloth of an Herb
very like Hemp, and call'd <HI>Co;</HI> which is very commodious in Summer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Physicians say, That upon the Mountain <HI>Tiengo</HI> grow above a
hundred sorts of Simples, all of very soveraign Vertues.</P>
<P>But amongst all others, <HI>China</HI> is famous for an Herb call'd <HI>Thea</HI> or <HI>Cha,</HI> and
whereof the Natives and other neighboring People make their Liquor call'd
<HI>Thea</HI> or <HI>Cha,</HI> taking its Name from the Herb.</P>
<P>Of all the Places in <HI>China,</HI> this Herb grows fastest, and in greatest abundance,
in the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> near to the City of <HI>Lucheu:</HI> and indeed the same is
only found in <HI>China, Siam,</HI> and <HI>Iapan:</HI> The Leaves thereof are very like those
of <HI>Sumack;</HI> and that this is a sort of <HI>Sumack</HI> none need to doubt: however it
springs not wild, but by manuring; 'tis neither Tree nor Herb, but a Bush
or Shrub: they Plant it upon little Hills three Foot asunder, and it grows as
high as a Rose-tree: the Branches thereof are full of Flowers, and thin Leaves
of a dark green colour, which though they differ not in shape, yet they are of
several sizes; for upon one Shrub are at least five several degrees in bigness;
the first and biggest grow upon the lowermost Sprigs; next to them follow
those of the next size, and are lesser than the first, and so by degrees grow all
the other sorts. But so much as these Leaves decrease upward in bigness, so
much the more they increase in Price; for a Pound of dried Leaves of the first
<FIGURE>
<PB N="216" REF="124"/>
</FIGURE>
bigness is worth five Shillings; those of the second, ten Shillings; of the
third, ten <HI>Guilders;</HI> of the fourth, fifteen <HI>Gilders;</HI> and of the fifth and last big∣ness,
fifty, yea, sometimes a hundred and fifty <HI>Guilders</HI> a Pound, if well pre∣par'd.
Upon the Branches grow small green Buds, which produce little Flow∣ers
with white Leaves, yellow within, and in bigness, fashion, and colour, very
like the Flower of Sweet-Briar, but different from it in smell. After the Flow∣ers
are shed, there remains a Husk which contains a blackish Seed, which be∣ing
sow'd in the Ground, brings forth the third year new Bushes, from whose
Leaves is gather'd every year a rich Harvest, and that in such Places where it
Rains and Snows, as it doth in <HI>Europe;</HI> so that it is probable enough that there
might be Bushes rais'd from that Seed, if it were sown in some shady fruitful
<HI>European</HI> Soil. It is full of spreading Roots, which run but shallow in the
Ground, and are good for nothing; but the Leaves they gather every day,
and drying them in the shade, preserve them for their Drink, which they use
in stead of Beer, not only at Tables, but upon all Visits and Entertainments;
and which is more, whosoever has any thing to dispatch in the Palaces of the
Grandees, is Presented as soon as he is seated with a Cup of this Liquor, which
is always drunk, or rather supp'd off hot, according to the fashion of the anci∣ent
<HI>Romans,</HI> who esteem'd more of warm than cold Water. If at any time this
Liquor proves bitter to the taste, they mingle a little Sugar with it, and drink
it to drive away drowsiness: But such especially find the benefit thereof who have overcharg'd their Stomachs with eating, or discompos'd their Brains
with too much strong Drink: for it is a very great drier of gross Humors,
and dispels Vapors, occasioning sleep; it strengthens the Memory, but in∣creases
Gall, if drank in too great a quantity: In brief, they extol the Ver∣tues
of this Drink infinitely, and attribute their not having the Stone or Gout
to this (as they term it) <HI>Most noble Drink;</HI> which we may believe the rather,
because in all our Iourney forward and backward, we met with none that
were afflicted with these Distempers.</P>
<P>There is a very great difference in the manner of preparing and using this
Liquor, between the <HI>Chineses</HI> and those of <HI>Iapan;</HI> for that the <HI>Iapanners</HI> beat the
Leaves to a Powder, and mingle it with boiling Water in a Cup, which they
afterwards drink off: But the <HI>Chineses</HI> put the Leaves whole into a Pot of
<PB N="217" REF="124"/>
boiling Water, which having lain in steep for some time, they sip off hot, with∣out
swallowing down any of the Leaves, but only the Quintessence thereof
extracted. Others prepare it with Milk and a little Salt mingled with Water,
which is not so well approv'd; but however prepar'd, it is not only drunk in
<HI>China,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>India,</HI> but is much us'd likewise in divers other Coun∣tries;
and the general consent of all People, that they find much good by it,
enhances the Price, and makes the same be sold here at a very dear Rate.</P>
<P>In <HI>Xensi,</HI> near the City <HI>Hacheu,</HI> is great store of Hemp; but no Flax grows
in all the Empire.</P>
<P>In <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> near the City <HI>Kienchang,</HI> grows a sort of Rice, so far exceeding the
rest for goodness, that the Emperor himself sends for his own Stores from
thence; and for its excellency the <HI>Chineses</HI> call it <HI>Silver-Cron.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Xensi,</HI> near the City <HI>Kingyang,</HI> grows another sort of Rice, us'd by the
People to purge the Body, and cause Urine.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Tienno,</HI> near the City <HI>Hang∣cheu,</HI>
grow Mushroms in great abundance, which are dispersed into all Parts
of the Country, and will keep good a whole year, either dried or Pickled.</P>
<P>This Country produces abundance of Cottons, the Seed whereof was
brought thither about five hundred years since: And though this Fruit doth
likewise grow in other Parts at present, as in <HI>Arabia,</HI> upon the Islands of <HI>Cy∣prus,
Maltha,</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and in <HI>Egypt,</HI> I think it not amiss (since it is one of the
most profitable Commodities for Trade in <HI>China)</HI> to give this brief Descripti∣on
thereof: It grows upon a Stalk almost three Foot high, cover'd with a
reddish Bark, and full of Prickles, dividing it self into several Branches. The
Leaves are not much unlike those of the Vine, and divided into three Parts,
which for bigness may be compar'd with those of the Mast-Tree: It bears a
Flower which is yellow on the outside, and red in the middle, from which pro∣ceeds
a round Fruit, about the bigness of an Apple, wherein, when it is ripe,
the Wool lies conceal'd, which is afterwards gather'd, sold, and dispos'd of to
several Uses.</P>
<P>The Leaves of the Cotton-Tree are generally alike, onely here and there
some are smoother, softer, and more even than others.</P>
<P>In some places of <HI>China</HI> Beans may be seen growing upon Trees, a sort of
which near the City <HI>Changchang</HI> are reputed good against Poison.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> produces abundance of Osiers, which seem to be
no other than Ropes twisted together by Nature; of which there are whole
Mountains full in this Province, which are put by the Inhabitants to divers
Uses: and in regard they are very tough, and will not easily break, they make
sometimes Cordage thereof for Vessels; but their best use is to make soft Mat∣tresses,
upon which most of the People, the Grandees, and the Emperor him∣self
lay themselves naked when they go to sleep. Very neat and clean is this
Furniture, and withal very cool in the Summer; and though the Mattresses
be only spread one the bare Floor, yet they look upon it as a fit place to lie on,
having been no otherwise accustom'd.</P>
<P>The whole Island of <HI>Hainan</HI> is full of these Osiers, especially of the best,
which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>The white Rota.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="218" REF="125"/>
<HEAD>Of Flowers.</HEAD>
<P>THere are several rare and well scented Flowers which grow in these
Parts, that are unknown to those of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> near to <HI>Chungking,</HI> grows a certain Flower call'd
<HI>Meutang,</HI> in high esteem amongst them, and therefore call'd <HI>The King of Flowers.</HI>
It differs very little in fashion from the <HI>European</HI> Rose, but is much larger, and
spreads it Leaves farther abroad. It far surpasses the Rose in beauty, but falls
short in richness of scent. It has no Thorns or Prickles, and is generally of a
white colour, mingled with a little Purple; yet there are some that are yellow
and red. This Flower grows upon a Bush, and is carefully cherish'd and
Planted in all Gardens belonging to the Grandees, for one of the most choice
Flowers.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> near the City <HI>Tan,</HI> is a great Cataract, which
occasions a Mere, wherein grow Flowers of a Saffron colour, whose like are
no where else to be seen in all those Countries. Several of these Flowers grow
upon one Root, being something bigger than the <HI>European</HI> Lilly, and much
handsomer; for fashion, resembling Tulips: The Leaves of the Stalks are
large and round, and drive upon the Water, as the Leaves of the Weeds do in
<HI>Europe,</HI> which at their Season they gather and dry, and make them fit to be
us'd by Shop-keepers in stead of Paper, to put up their Wares in. There are
in some places whole Pools abounding with these Flowers, which, to say truth,
grow not there naturally, but have been sow'd by one or other, for that they
are in great request amongst them.</P>
<P>But amongst all others, the <HI>Chinese</HI> Rose must deservedly take place, which
changes colour every day twice; for one time its all Purple, and another time
as white as Snow; and were the scent thereof pleasant or delightful, it might
with merit challenge the World for a Peer.</P>
<P>The Chief City of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> situate in the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> takes its
Name from the Flower call'd <HI>Quei;</HI> which although it grows in other Parts,
yet no where so plentifully as in this Province, and chiefly under the Com∣mand
of this City: It grows upon a very high Tree, which has Leaves pro∣portion'd
like them of a Laurel or Cinamon-tree; but the Flowers are very
small, yellow of colour, and have a fine smell: After they are once in
Flower, they continue a long time blowing, without withering or shedding,
or falling from the Tree; and after they have done blowing, the Tree shoots
out again within a Month, and has fresh Flowers, whose colour is so fragrant,
that they perfume all those Parts where they grow. The <HI>Tartars</HI> infuse these
Flowers in the Iuice of Lemmons, wherewith they colour the Hair of their
Horses: But the <HI>Chineses</HI> make delicate Confects of them, which are delicious
to the taste, and pleasant to the smell.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Kinhoa,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> is a certain Flower, by the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI>
in <HI>India</HI> call'd <HI>Mogorin:</HI> It grows upon a very small Tree, is Milk-white,
and not unlike to the Iessamy Flower, only it has more Leaves, and exceeds
it far for smell; for one Flower is enough to perfume a whole House. This
Flower is in very great esteem with them, so that in cold Weather they dili∣gently
house the Pots in which they grow.</P>
<P>And lastly, near the City <HI>Pingyve</HI> in <HI>Queicheu,</HI> grows in great abundance the
well scented Iessamy.</P>

<HEAD>Of Reeds.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing part of this Chapter you have had some Examples of the
variety of Herbs, Plants, Flowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> produc'd in several parts of <HI>China;</HI>
I shall now say something of the different sorts of Reeds growing there And
first,</P>
<P>In <HI>Xanhung,</HI> near <HI>Tengcheu,</HI> grows a Reed that is naturally four-square.</P>
<P>In <HI>Huquang,</HI> near the Mountain, grows a sort of Reed which will last only
three years; but like a careful Sire, before it dies it shoots out afresh at the
Root: thus every three years renewing by death, and rising again.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> near <HI>Hoaigan,</HI> is a great Mere, wherein grows
very large and high Reeds, greatly esteem'd by the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>In <HI>Quanhung,</HI> near the City <HI>Lochang,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Chang,</HI> grows a
black Reed, whereof the <HI>Chineses</HI> make Pipes, and several other things, of as
pure a black and shining colour, as if they were made of Ebony.</P>
<P>In the same Province, upon the Mountain <HI>Lofen,</HI> grows a Reed that exceeds
all the rest for length and thickness, the Stalks being at least four Foot thick.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> near the City of <HI>Chucheu,</HI> runs a Rivulet, in
which grow several sorts of Reed or Cane, as hard as Iron, and oftentimes
three Handfuls thick: and although they are hollow, yet are they of strength
sufficient to bear a great Burthen without breaking: The biggest grow three
or four Rods high; some have green Stalks, others Coal-black: They make
a very pleasant shew, not only because of the flourishing Verdure of the
Leaves for the most part of the Year, but also because of the several Colours
produc'd by the various sorts that grow altogether. Of these, notwithstand∣ing
their hardness before-mention'd, such as are skilful Artists, and know
how to split the same into very thin pieces, make Mattresses, Baskets, Canes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of the thinner and smaller sort they make Pikes and Lances, which have
sharp Irons at the ends. They put them likewise to several other uses, especi∣ally
for the making of Perspective-Glasses, in regard they are light, straight,
thick and firm. The Water that runs from this Reed, when it is laid green up∣on
the Fire, is found, being taken inwardly, to be very soveraign to drive
out of the Body all putrifi'd Blood, occasion'd by Blows, Falls, or otherwise.
The young Shoots of it, before they have any Leaves, are boil'd with Flesh
like Turnips, and pickled in Vinegar, are kept all the year for Sawce.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Suchuen</HI> produces great store of Sugar-Canes, from whence
they draw great quantities of Sugar, and that none of the worst. And though
there has grown for a long time great quantities of such Canes in this Pro∣vince;
yet the Inhabitants never knew how to extract Sugar from them, un∣til
they were taught by a certain <HI>Indian</HI> Priest, who accidentally riding with
his Ass through a Field of Sugar-Canes, was detain'd by the Owner thereof
for spoiling the same, and would not let him pass till he had made satisfaction
for what damage he had done; whereupon the Priest, to redeem his Ass,
discover'd to that Country-man the way of making Sugar out of those Canes.
This Reed or Cane grows very fast upon Morish Grounds, and has Leaves
like the Reeds in <HI>Europe,</HI> shooting six or seven Foot high, and being about two
or three Fingers thick, and full of Knots; the Pipes of it are full of white pi∣thy
substance, out of which they squeeze the Sugar. The manner of increa∣sing
this Cane us'd by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> is as follows: The Ground is first plough'd
<FIGURE>
<PB N="220" REF="126"/>
</FIGURE>
up, and laid into Furrows, wherein they Plant the young Shoots, and after∣wards
fill up the Furrows with Mud. The moister it stands, the better it will
thrive, and in a years time to come to perfection; and then they cut down
the old, and Plant new ones; but sometimes they let it stand until the second
year, which is not much amiss; but if it be not then cut down it will be good
for nothing: It will continue for many years, if this course be taken to pre∣serve
it, and if it be Planted in moist and fertile Earth, and that the Worm
get not to the Root; but what of it stands in dry Grounds will hardly conti∣nue
five years without transplanting.</P>
<P>Amongst these various sorts of Reeds may be comprehended another kind,
that grows upon some Mountains in <HI>China</HI> in great abundance, and is call'd by
the <HI>Indians, Rotang;</HI> but in <HI>Europe, Rotting,</HI> or <HI>Iapan</HI> Canes. And though these
Canes are us'd in <HI>Europe</HI> to walk with, yet the young Branches thereof being
full of Iuice, are eaten raw by the <HI>Chineses.</HI> When these Canes are dried, and
struck one against another, there will flie Sparks of Fire from them, as from
a Flint, and as such they are made use of in some Places of the <HI>Indies.</HI> This sort
of Reed is very tough, and being green, is made use of in stead of Cords to
tie or bind any thing withal. The Inhabitants of <HI>Iava, Iapan,</HI> and other Islan∣ders,
make therewith Cable for Anchors, which will last longer in salt Water
than Ropes made of Hemp; and when any Merchants Ship Trading thither
from <HI>Europe,</HI> need any, they make use of these, they being strong enough to
hold the weightiest Anchors. The Fruit of this <HI>Rotting</HI> or Cane is eatable, and
pleasant to the Palate; in form somewhat round, about the bigness of a Ball,
having a Shell like a Chesnut, hard, but brittle. Upon every Ioint, from the
bottom to the top, sprouts out a small Branch in stead of Leaves, upon which
hangs the Fruit in Clusters. Within the Body of this Fruit is a white Kernel,
from which they extract an Oyl not only good to eat, but very soveraign in
the cure of Wounds, if dress'd therewith; so that the <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves, if they re∣ceive
hurt at any time from these <HI>Rottings</HI> or Canes, wherewith they are wont
to be Corrected, they forthwith make use of this Oyl.</P>
<P>Besides these before-mention'd, there are found as well in <HI>China</HI> as divers
other Parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> two other different sorts, which are by the <HI>Indians</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="126"/>
call'd <HI>Bamboes.</HI> The smaller of these is very full of Pith; but the other doth
so far exceed all the rest for bigness, that I do not wonder in the least if some
Writers, both ancient and modern, have sometimes call'd it a Tree. This
kind, call'd <HI>Bamboes,</HI> grows in Morish or Fenny Grounds, and is very straight;
but in its growth they bend it on purpose to prepare it for their use, which
ss to make Chairs of, such as they are carried in. Of the Body of this Tree
the <HI>Chineses</HI> sometimes make their Wherries, in which they Row with great
swiftness upon the Rivers. The Leaves hereof are somewhat like those of the
Olive-Tree.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Trees.</HEAD>
<P>THis Empire doth also very much abound with Trees; not only such as
grow in <HI>Europe,</HI> but several others of a more strange nature, not known
in these Parts of the World.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchue,</HI> in the small City of <HI>Kien,</HI> stands a certain Idol-Temple,

years;</HI> which is so prodigiously large, that two hundred. Sheep may
stand in covert under one Branch of it, without being seen, though you come
very near to it.</P>
<P>In the same Province likewise grows a sort of Beans upon a Tree, which
are so exceeding hard, that the People, by reason thereof, have given them
the Name of <HI>Stone-Beans.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Huquang</HI> grows a Tree, nam'd <HI>The Tree of Sleep;</HI> for that
(as some report) a Branch of this Tree applied to any part of the Body, causes
a sweet and pleasant Sleep.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> near to the small City <HI>Singhiang,</HI> grow such ex∣traordinary
large Trees, that fourscore Men are not able to fathom them
about: Nay further, there are some of those Trees <HI>(ni fallit fama)</HI> of that vast
bigness, that one Branch will cover at least forty Men.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Macao</HI> is a Tree by the <HI>Portugueses</HI> call'd <HI>The Iron-Tree,</HI> in
regard the Wood thereof, both for colour, heaviness, and hardness, resembles
Iron, and sinks immediately when put into the Water.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> near <HI>Chaoking,</HI> grows great store of sweet and
well-scented Wood, whereof the Inhabitants make Tables, Chairs, Chests,
and the like.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi</HI> the Inhabitants make Linnen Cloth of the Leaves
of Trees.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang</HI> are several Woods consisting of Mulberry-Trees,
which the Inhabitants cut every year, that so they may not grow up to
any largeness; for they find by experience, that the Leaves of the lower
Trees make the best Silk: so that by this only means, all that keep Silk∣worms
know very well how to distinguish the first Spinning of the Silk from
the second, because the first is the product of the soft and tender Leaves,
which shoot forth in the Spring, and are then eaten by the Worm; but the
hard and sowre Summer-Leaves make the second Spinning; which altera∣tion
of Food doth occasion so great a difference in the Work of these small
Creatures. And such is the infinite abundance of Silks in this Province, that
ten Suits of Silk may there be bought cheaper than you can buy one of Cloth
here in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> near the City <HI>Cincheu,</HI> is great store of Cina∣mon-Trees,
which differs only in this from that of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> in that it is
stronger of scent, and hotter upon the Tongue. The Tree upon which it
grows, is about the bigness of an Orange-Tree, and has many long, thick, and
straight Branches, whose Leaves have some similitude with those of the Lau∣rel:
It bears a Snow-white and well-scented Flower, from whence is pro∣duc'd
a smart sort of Fruit, which being neglected by the People, is eaten up
by the Birds and Monkies. From this Fruit drops a Iuice which has the taste
of Cinamon, but not so strong: The Wood of the Tree has neither smell nor
taste, insomuch that Nature seems to have depriv'd all the parts of this Tree
of its Vertue, and only bestow'd it upon its Bark, to raise it to the higher
esteem, and draw from thence the greater advantage. This Tree, as all others,
has a double Bark; the first is a very pleasant kind, and so thin, that it can∣not
be distinguish'd from the other, but by its greenness: for afterwards when
it is dry, it sticks so fast to the innermost Bark, that it can neither be seen nor
tasted, nor peel'd off. The green inward Bark, when this outward Rind is ta∣ken
off, is slippery and smooth: Being thus peel'd off and cleansed, it is cut
into four-square pieces, and laid a drying in the Sun, it is afterwards roll'd
up, and put into Barrels, and so Transported into <HI>Europe</HI> in the same form as
we have it, and see it sold in all Parts. After the Bark is peel'd off, the Tree
will stand two or three years naked, without getting a new Bark; but after
that time the Bark will re-increase, and become fit to be new peel'd. The
Inhabitants say, that the Root of this Tree produces a Sap not unlike to
<HI>Camphire.</HI> The <HI>Chineses,</HI> and likewise those of the Island of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> distill from
the green Bark and the fresh Flowers (almost after the same manner as those
of <HI>Europe</HI> make Cinamon-water) a certain Liquor, which they apply to seve∣ral
Uses.</P>
<P>In the Island of <HI>Ceylon</HI> these Cinamon-Trees grow in such abundance, that
they supply all parts of the World with their Bark, and would produce more
than could be spent, if the Islanders did not sometimes burn whole Woods.
But this may be observ'd, That as this Island is very fruitful in the product
of Cinamon, so on the other Hand, neither Cloves nor Nutmeg-trees will
grow upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="127"/>
In some few Places of <HI>China</HI> there grow Cloves, Pepper, and Nutmegs, but
in small quantities, so that most of those Spices are commonly brought from
other Places.</P>
<P>Now in regard it will not be unpleasant to the Readers, to peruse the Na∣ture
of these Trees and Fruits, I shall declare in a few words what I have ob∣serv'd
concerning them, whereof no mention has been made by any other
former Writer.</P>
<P>The Tree upon which the Cloves grow, is as big as an ordinary Pear-tree,
and grows after the same form: The Leaves hang upon long Stalks, and
grow sometimes single, and sometimes in clusters: It has several greater
and lesser Branches, each whereof end in very thin Shoots, upon whose top
grow small Stalks, where sit the Cloves in clusters: within the head of the
Cloves grows also a Flower which yields a very pleasant scent, as well as the
Fruit, but is much more fragrant in dry Weather than in wet; upon which
also depends the fruitfulness or unfruitfulness of it: for in a dry Year there
is more Fruit than Leaves upon the Tree. But although extraordinary Heat
be the most seasonable Weather for these Trees; yet they do not always yield
a like plentiful Harvest; for about the second or third, and sometimes about
the seventh Year, the Crop is much worse. The Cloves are first red of co∣lour,
but afterwards turn black, and are gather'd in the Months of <HI>September,
October,</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> either with the Hand, or else beaten off with a long
Reed: Such as are left upon the Tree grow much bigger than those that
are gather'd, and fall off of themselves the next year; which though they
are not altogether so sharp of taste, yet are held much dearer, and are us'd for
Seed: And this is the reason why the <HI>Indians</HI> name the same <HI>The Mother of
Fruits.</HI> These Seeds grow up to a compleat Tree in eight or ten years time,
and then bear store of Fruit. The Cloves, when they are first gather'd, are
blackish, and to make them blacker, they lay them to dry in the Sun; but to
preserve them from being Worm-eaten, they lay them to steep a while in
salt Water, and then again dry them in the Sun: Being thus prepar'd for
keeping, they are Transported into most Parts of the World. And here ob∣serve,
That though the Clove-trees are only cherish'd for the sake of the
Fruit, yet there is an Aromatick soveraign Vertue in the very Leaves, Flowers,
and Branches.</P>
<P>I shall not need to say any thing of the Excellency of this Spice, it being
so well known to all Persons; only this I shall add, as worthy of observa∣tion,
because thereby may be understood the subtilty of the <HI>Indians,</HI> That
when they are to sell their Cloves, they will be sure to soke them well before∣hand
with Water, to make them weigh heavier.</P>
<P>Out of the Flowers and green Cloves the <HI>Indians</HI> extract a certain Water
or Spirit, which is exceeding pleasant of smell, and also very good for several
Distempers.</P>
<P>The best Place for these Clove-trees to grow in, are the <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands,
where they are more fruitful than in any other Place, and naturally delight to
grow upon high places, and so thick together, that the Sun is not able to pierce
through them.</P>
<P>Now observe, That as the Cinamon-tree prospers no where so well as up∣on
the Island of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> nor the Clove, as upon the <HI>Moluccaes;</HI> so the Nutmeg∣tree
takes the greatest liking to the particular Island of <HI>Banda,</HI> which is one of
the chiefest of the <HI>Moluccaes.</HI></P>

<P>The Tree upon which the ordinary Nutmegs grow, and call'd by the
Inhabitants <HI>Bongopolu,</HI> resembles an Apple or Pear Tree, and springs often∣times
of it self, without Planting. It is always green, full of Blossoms, and
laden with Fruit, whereof some are full ripe, and others but half ripe. The
Bark is swarthy, the Wood hollow and pithy, and the Leaves (which grow in
Clusters upon the Stalks) are green of colour, thin and smooth, which being
rubb'd between the Fingers as they are pull'd from the Tree, do not only
smell very strongly fragrant, but retain also, when they are dried, their sharp
and strong Aromatick scent and vertue. The Flowers or Blossoms are for big∣ness
and colour much like the Pear or Cherry-tree, dropping easily off with∣out
any great scent: The Fruit which succeeds the Blossoms, grows scatter∣ing
up and down about the Ioynts of the Boughs. When the Blossom is fall'n
off, the first Shell of the Nut at the beginning is green, tough, and somewhat
thick; but as it grows ripe, it becomes full of yellow and purple Specks.
This rough Shell being soon split, the Nut appears, about which sits the Mace
in the form of a Net; afterwards, when the Fruit is ripe, this rough Shell falls
quite off, in the same manner as the Shell of a ripe Walnut drops off; and
then the Mace appears of a delicate red colour, but afterwards turns yellow,
and includes that Kernel which we properly call the Nutmeg; so that the Nut∣meg
is cover'd with three Shells; the outermost green and thick, the middle∣most
is thinner, of a Gold colour, and very hard; and lastly, the innermost,
which is a hard Rind. This Fruit is very much spoil'd and eaten up by
Birds, especially a certain kind of white and small Pigeons, whose Flesh being
eaten, taste very much of the Mace: They are by those of <HI>Europe</HI> call'd <HI>The
Nutmeg-Eaters.</HI></P>
<P>These Trees bring forth Fruit two or three times in a year, which never∣theless
are not to be gather'd till they are through ripe, lest they should grow
light and worm-eaten. When they are first taken out of the Shell or Husk,
they are laid a drying in the Sun; then taking off the Mace, they wash the
Nutmeg in Lime-water, which preserves it from perishing; insomuch that
they may be transported into all Parts of the World without taking any harm.
Those Nuts are counted the best which are of an Ash-colour, mixed with
<PB N="225" REF="128"/>
white Streaks. It often happens that some Nuts differ from others in bigness
and colour, as is to be seen by the Nuts in <HI>Europe.</HI> Such Nuts as are by the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
call'd <HI>Palajava,</HI> are us'd in Medicines, not amongst their Victuals.</P>
<P>But the Mace that covers the Nutmeg is taken by the <HI>Indians</HI> before it be
through ripe, whilst it is of a very deep red colour, and put into Vinegar
and Salt, and so brought to the Table, and eaten before the Meat, to sharpen
the Appetite. When the Mace is ripe, it is taken off the Nut and dried in the
Sun, and laid up carefully. The <HI>Indians</HI> say, That as well the Nut as the Mace
cures shrunk Sinews, and other Aches of the Body, caus'd by Cold; and for
that end every one has Oyl in his House made of the fresh Fruit: And as there
comes from the Mace mnch less Oyl than from the Nut, so on the other hand,
the Oyl of Mace is much stronger than that of the Nutmeg. The Inhabitants
esteem and value the Mace so much higher than the Nut, in regard they can
sell the Mace almost fifty times dearer than the Nut. The green and unripe
Nuts are put by the Grandees of <HI>India</HI> into Vinegar or Sugar, and so brought
to the Table in stead of a Banquet. And of late years some <HI>European</HI> Merchants
have brought over of these Nuts order'd after this manner, which are us'd not
only in Physick, but as a Delicacy. Some put the outward Shell or Husk into
Sugar, and prefer it before the Nut, because of its most delicate smell and taste.
There is another sort of long Nutmegs, which are by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Pala
Metfiri:</HI> These are accounted the best by the ordinary People, but without any
reason; for though they they are bigger than the round, yet they have not
that Aromatick vertue: neither is the Mace of this long Nut in that esteem
amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> (though perhaps of a better colour) as that of the round
Nutmeg, there being very little vertue in it; and the very Trees upon which
these long Nuts grow, are reckon'd amongst the wild and worst sort, so that
the <HI>Indians</HI> think it not worth their time or trouble to gather them, there be∣ing
little or no vertue in them. And to say all in one word, the Tree upon
which these long Nutmegs grow, differs more in vertue and strength then form
or shape from that of the other.</P>
<P>The chiefest sorts of Pepper are two, the one round, and the other long:
The round Pepper grows chiefly in some <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands, as <HI>Iava</HI> and <HI>Sumatra,</HI>
shooting up very high, and is supported with Poles, as Hops in <HI>Europe.</HI> If the
Seed of this Fruit be sown in a fertile and rich Soil, it will bring forth a very
plentiful Harvest in one year; but if sown in a more barren Ground, it will
require longer time before it comes to bear. If shoots downwards into the
Ground with its Root, which is full of small tough Strings: The outside of
the Leaves are of a deep, but the inside of a more pale Green. The Fruit
hangs like Currants, only the Branches are much bigger and longer.</P>
<P>The Berries or Pepper-corns are at first green, but grow black of colour as
they grow ripe, which is in the Summer-Months. The ripe Berries are ga∣ther'd
and dry'd in the Sun, which makes the outward Shell so full of shrivles:
But when this black Shell is taken off, before it is dry'd in the Sun, it makes
another sort of Pepper, which is commonly call'd <HI>White Pepper,</HI> and is sharper,
harder, and pleasanter of taste than the black, and often us'd in <HI>India</HI> by Persons
of Quality in stead of Salt with their Meat. The peeling of this outward
black Skin is done when the Pepper is over ripe, and after it has been steep'd in
salt Water; for by this infusion the outward Skin aforesaid swells, so that the
white Pepper-corns within may be taken out with little or no trouble, which
are afterwards dry'd again in the Sun. And if the lazy <HI>Indians</HI> were not so
<FIGURE>
<PB N="226" REF="129"/>
</FIGURE>
averse to Labor, there might be much more white than black Pepper. And
here note, that not only the Berries, which are properly call'd Pepper, have a
fiery hot taste, but also the Leaves, and the whole growth, have the same Ver∣tue;
for when they are chew'd, they burn upon the Tongue, like the Root of
<HI>Costus</HI> and <HI>Berethram.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this, there grows in <HI>India</HI> a sort of long Pepper, call'd by the <HI>Indians,
Pimpilim,</HI> which is never us'd about Meats, but only in Medicines, especially in
Treacle and other Antidotes against Poyson: And this seems to be done not
without great reason, in regard it has a very great strength, which single Qua∣lity
makes it to be sold at a dearer Rate than the other. This long Pepper
grows in great abundance at <HI>Bengala,</HI> and is Transported from thence into
<HI>Europe.</HI> In shape (except the Fruit) this Plant is like unto that of the round
Pepper, only it either creeps along upon the Ground, or runs up against
lower Poles than those of the other Pepper. The Leaves thereof are more ten∣der,
and of a darker Green, and have long Stalks: There is little difference
between these two sorts; that is, the Fruit is gather'd when it is green, and
dry'd before it is ripe; and though it is not so hot upon the Tongue when it
is first dry'd, yet afterwards by lying, it gathers as great strength, and is as hot
of taste as the round Pepper.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> use this in Salves against the Griping of the Guts; and also for
an Antidote against Poyson, Giddiness of the Head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Though the <HI>Chineses</HI> have an extraordinary opinion of themselves and their
Country, and have a very great aversion to all forein Manners and Customs;
yet the Inhabitants of some Quarters have learn'd of their Neighbors to chew
the Root <HI>Betel,</HI> the Leaves whereof are generally so us'd by the <HI>Indians:</HI> It
grows after the manner of Pepper, or Hops in <HI>Europe,</HI> and at a distance can
hardly be distinguish'd from Pepper. The Leaves, which hang upon a long
Stalk, are very like the Leaves of an Orange-Tree, but not quite so sharp at
the ends, smooth, of a dark Green, thin, and full of Veins, and increasing very
fast in a well temper'd Soil, but apt suddenly to wither if too much handled.
They are in the eating harsh and gravelly, insomuch that when the Leaves are
chewing, it is just as if one had so much Sand between his Teeth. These
<FIGURE>
<PB N="227" REF="129"/>
</FIGURE>
Leaves are chew'd in some of the Southern Countries, Mornings, Noons, and
Nights. But in regard of their extraordinary bitterness; they mingle one thing
or other to sweeten their taste, as <HI>Licium, Caphur de Burneo,</HI> Aloes, Musk, or
some other Spice: and being thus prepar'd, it proves pleasant, and makes a
very sweet Breath. In some Places these Leaves are sold very dear, by reason
of their frequent use; for whenever they make any Visits, they Treat one ano∣ther
with <HI>Betel,</HI> mingled with some pleasant Ingredient to make it agreeable
to the Palate. When they use it, they chew first a little <HI>Areca,</HI> and presently
after a Leaf of the <HI>Betel,</HI> which after it is chew'd a while, yields a Iuyce or Sap
as red as Blood, which they spit out; after the red Iuice follows another,
which they swallow down. The <HI>Indians</HI> believe that it is good to preserve
their Teeth, and strengthen the Stomach. The Leaves are hot and dry in the
second degree. Some esteem the ripe Leaves the best, others the dry ones, be∣cause
they make the greatest noise when they are chew'd. Notwithstanding
this general Custom, at some certain times, to wit, when their near Relations
are dead, or upon some Holy-days, they forbear chewing these Leaves.</P>
<P>In some Places of <HI>China</HI> grows a very wonderful and strange Tree, which
by some, because it bears a Fruit like Figs, is call'd <HI>The Indian Fig-Tree;</HI> but
others give it the Name of <HI>The Tree of Goa,</HI> because it was first found out there
by those of <HI>Europe,</HI> and grows no where so well as upon that Island. This Tree
grows up very high with its main Body, and spreads its Branches round
about, from which proceed little thin Strings, which hanging down to the
Ground, take root, and grow to be young Trees; and thus they sometimes
encrease to a large Wood, wherein it is difficult to distinguish which is the
Mother of all these Off-sets, but only by the largeness of its Body, which
frequently is so thick, that three Men cannot fathom it. When the Inhabi∣tants
will make a Passage through this Tree, they cut away all the under∣growing
and smallest Shoots, and so make convenient Places to shelter them∣selves
in from the Heat of the Sun, whose Beams are not able to pierce it, by
reason of its thick growth: Nor is that all; for it is sometimes of so great
an extent, that it will afford Covert for 3000 People. The Leaves of the
young Branches are very like those of the Quince-tree, and much eaten by the
Elephants: they are green on the outside, and whitish on the inside, with a

little Wool thereon. The Fruit in shape resembles a small Fig, is of a redd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
colour, and full of Seed, like the ordinary Fig, and as wholesom to eat, but
not so pleasant to the taste.</P>
<P>Here grows also in many Places abundance of Coco-Nuts, which the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tives
call <HI>Coquoeiro.</HI> The Tree which bears them seldom grows straight, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
commonly four or five Foot thick, and above fifty Foot high, with the Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lying very shallow in the Ground, which causes great admiration how it can
be supported so high in the Air, with such a heavy Top, hanging full of
large Fruit, against high and stormy gusts of Wind, and not be over-turn'd▪
And indeed this is the more admirable, if it be consider'd, That the lowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
part of the Body of this Tree is no thicker than the upper. The Bark of it
is of a swarthy colour, and of little use, though sweet and juycie. About
the Body of the Tree grows never a Branch; but on the very top of it stand
up fifteen or sixteen large Leaves, like a Plume of Feathers, each being
about sixteen Foot long, and a Foot thick at the bottom, consisting of several
other Leaves, which stand one against another in a row. Between each Leaf
on the top of the Tree is a Rent or parting Cleft of two Foot long, which is
at first green, afterwards red, and opens of it self. Before this Cleft opens,
there appears within a very fine Stem of a Foot long, and three or four Fin∣gers
thick, with several Branches upon it, upon which grow certain three<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>corner'd
Blossoms, as big as Almonds, white of colour, and are the begin∣nings
of the Flowers and Nuts; for when the Rent breaks open, then the
Branches spread, and the yellow Flowers appear. After the Flower is off,
the Fruit succeeds, which grows each upon a short Stem, about the bigness
of a Goose-quill. The Fruit of this Tree is heavy, hard, and as big as a
Man's Head, hanging in Clusters at the top. On the out-side of these Nuts
is a thick, stringy, and tough Shell, which, if gather'd green, yields a very
pleasant Iuyce, good, being drank fresh, against the Dropsie. When the
Nuts are thorow ripe, and dry, the Kernel proves very sweet of taste, and are
often eaten by Travellers for refreshment, no Nuts in <HI>Europe</HI> being to be
compar'd with them: and the Sea-men that go long Voyages provide them∣selves
with these Nuts, which they eat as Medicinal against the Scurvy, and
<PB N="229" REF="130"/>
as a Restorative when they are grown weak and faint. It is warm and moist
in the first degree; and of the Kernels is made an Oyl, not inferior to that of
Almonds for strength and vertue, and is generally us'd in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
both in Meats and Medicines. Taken inwardly, this Oyl cures the Rup∣ture,
and most inward Wounds and Bruises. Of the stringy Stuff which grows
on the outside of the Shell of these Nuts they make Ropes in several Parts, that
will last a long while in salt Water, which is so well known to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI>
that all the Anchor-Cables and other Ropes (which is very observable) us'd
about their Kings Ships, are made of this Stuff. A certain Historian, <HI>Lucuna</HI>
by Name, makes mention in one of his Books, that in some Places in <HI>India,</HI>
they weave Carpets of this hairy Stuff that grows about the Shell of the Coco-Nut.
Of the hard Shell are made Drinking-Cups, which are often tipt with
Gold or Silver. The Leaves serve, and are us'd in stead of Paper; nay, some
<HI>Indians</HI> make themselves Clothes of the same, which will last many years before
they go to decay and wear out. The Wood it self is good for, and put to di∣vers
uses, whereof, in regard others have written at large, I shall omit to make
any mention.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Kingyven,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> grows a Tree call'd <HI>Areca,</HI>
brought thither out of <HI>India,</HI> in shape like that of the Coco-Nut, but not so
thick, and has small Leaves: Its Fruit is also call'd <HI>Areca,</HI> being so hard, that it
cannot be parted or divided, but with a Knife or some sharp Instrument.</P>

<P>BEsides the Fruits which grow in several Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Chinese</HI> Terri∣tories
likewise produce yearly a rich Harvest of several other sorts.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> grows a sort of Fruit, which by the <HI>Chineses</HI> is
call'd <HI>Venku;</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese, Iamboa;</HI> and by the <HI>Hollanders, Pompel-Moes.</HI>
This Fruit grows upon a Tree beset with Thorns, like the Lemmon-tree, but
exceeds it for bigness, having a white Blossom, well scented, and whereof they
make a sweet Water: The Fruit is much bigger, being generally as large as a
Man's Head. The Shell resembles that of the Gold-Apple for Colour. The
Pap within is reddish, and sowre-sweet, and tastes as a Grape not ripe, so that
they make a sort of Liquor of there, as it is usual in <HI>Europe</HI> to do of Cherries
and Pears.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Peking</HI> grow very excellent Apples, Pears, Plums, Wheat,
and Rye; as also Figs, Grapes, and several other sorts of things; but the In∣habitants
however make no Wine, being better pleas'd with their Liquor
made of Rice, which indeed is very pleasant of taste, and preferr'd by all that
Trade there, yea even by those of <HI>Europe,</HI> before Wine. In <HI>Xansi</HI> grows a sort
of sweet Grape, which doubtless would make very delicate Wine; but the In∣habitants
dry them to make Raisins of them, which are brought to be sold
through all the Country.</P>
<P>In the same Province also grow very large Chesnuts; but in that of <HI>Suchue</HI>
is another sort that will melt in the Mouth like Sugar.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Honan</HI> grow all sorts of Gold-Apples and Pomegra∣nates.
But in that of <HI>Huquang</HI> only one sort, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>The Winter-Gold-Apple,</HI>
because they are ripe in the Winter, and are sweet of taste: There
is in <HI>Fokien</HI> the best sort of them, which differ not much in bigness from the
Apples in <HI>Europe,</HI> but are like unto the Muscate Grape for taste and smell.
<PB N="230" REF="131"/>
This Fruit dry'd and confected in Sugar, will keep a whole year, and is a very
delicate Sweet-meat.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Chekiang</HI> drops from the Trees a certain fatness, whereof
they make very white Candles, much better than those of Tallow; for they
neither foul the Fingers when put out, nor are of an ill smell. The Tree is
very large, and in its Leaves and shape is not unlike the Pear-tree in <HI>Europe:</HI> It
has white Blossoms as the Cherry-tree; after the Blossom follows a round
Berry as big as a Cherry, but with a brown and thin Skin, under which lies a
white Substance, which when the Fruit is ripe, and the Skin bursts, is seen;
and then they gather the Berries, and boil them in Water, which when hot,
smell like Flesh, but when cold, it feels like Tallow. The Leaves of this Tree
are very fat, on which the Sheep and Cows feed, and therewith become fat in
a short time.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> grows the Apple call'd <HI>Sucu,</HI> which dry'd as we
do Figs in <HI>Europe,</HI> will keep good a whole year together, and is as a Delicate
sold in all Parts of <HI>China.</HI> It is bigger than the ordinary Apple in this Coun∣try,
and of a deep red colour: the Kernels do not lie in the middle, but stand
upright on one side, being uncertain in the number; for in some there are
found ten, fifteen, or more, according as they are in largeness, while in others
there are none at all. It is red within, and pleasant of taste when ripe. Here
also are some Apples, green of Skin, and hard, and are eaten after the manner
as the Apples in <HI>England.</HI> This last sort of Fruit grows no where but in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchue</HI> grows the Fruit <HI>Lichi,</HI> which being ripe, as a Ra∣rity
is brought to the Emperor's Court. The greatest quantity thereof is found
in the Southern Parts of <HI>Fokien.</HI> The <HI>Portuguese</HI> at <HI>Macao</HI> call it <HI>Lichas.</HI> It grows
upon very high Trees, whose Leaves are like those of the Laurel. Upon the
tops of the Branches grows the Fruit in Clusters as Grapes, but is very like for
fashion unto a small Heart, and about the bigness of an Acorn, with a rough
Shell as the lesser Pine-Apple, but not so thick, being easily pull'd off with the
Finger. Its Kernel is full of Iuice, white of colour, pleasant of taste, and
smells like a Rose, and being ripe, receives a purple Colour. It is a very pleasant
sight to view the Trees, then shewing as if they hung full of small Hearts; so
that with great reason may this be call'd <HI>The King of Fruits,</HI> being both so plea∣sant
to behold and taste. Through the whole Empire of <HI>China</HI> there grow no
Pine-Apples, but only in this Province. There is also another sort of round
Fruit call'd <HI>Kungyen,</HI> that is, <HI>Dragons-Eye,</HI> not much unlike the former, only it
is somewhat smaller and rounder, being for the bigness much like our Cher∣ries
in <HI>Europe,</HI> but harder of Skin. This Fruit is dry'd and sold every where in
Markets; but it is much better eaten fresh from the Tree. Here also grows
the Fruit <HI>Muiginli,</HI> that is, <HI>The Plum of the fair Woman,</HI> being round, and exceed∣ing
the Damas Pruine for bigness and goodness.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> grow every where the <HI>Indian</HI> great and small
Nuts, as also a kind of Fruit much esteem'd for the bigness, and by the <HI>Indians</HI>
call'd <HI>Iaca;</HI> by the <HI>Arabians, Panaix;</HI> and by the <HI>Persians, Funax:</HI> It grows not
upon the Branches of Trees, but upon the very Stock or Body, as if they were
afraid the Boughs would not be able to bear up their weight without break∣ing.
The Skin or Shell of it is so hard, that it cannot be open'd but with an
Ax. Within it is full of little Holes, containing a yellow Pap, wherein lies a
Nut, which when it is ripe, eats very sweet, like a roasted Chesnut. The Tree
that bears it is very high and broad, having very large Leaves, of a pale Green,
<FIGURE>
<PB N="231" REF="131"/>
</FIGURE>
through which in the length runs a thick and hard Sinew. The best sort of
this Fruit grows upon the <HI>Malabase</HI> Coast, and is larger than the biggest Cab∣bage
when it is ripe, and of a pleasant smell. There are two sorts of this Fruit,
the least whereof is call'd <HI>Baria,</HI> the other <HI>Papa,</HI> and is the worst. The Nuts
which grow in them, if eaten raw, fill the Body with Crudities; but if roasted,
and eaten after the manner of Chesnuts in <HI>Europe,</HI> they have a pleasant taste,
and increase Seed.</P>
<P>In this Country grows likewise in several Places a certain Fruit call'd <HI>Du∣riones,</HI>
which, though of an ill taste, are yet very wholesom. It is dry in Ope∣ration,
causes Sweating, and is good against the Wind and Dropsie, provided
it be eaten moderately, for otherwise it will over-heat the Liver. Most Men
at first fancy this Fruit to smell like rotten Egs; but after they have once eaten
of it, they change opinion, esteeming it to be the sweetest that ever they did
eat of. The Grandees make account of this Fruit as a great Delicacy, and think
they can never have enough of it. The Leaf or the Herb <HI>Betel</HI> (which we
spoke of before to be so chew'd by them) has so great an aversion to this Fruit,
that it spoils and rots the same, if it lie near unto it; insomuch, that if at any
time any Person eat too much of that, the <HI>Betel</HI> is a present Remedy against
the same.</P>
<P>Here grows likewise a well-tasted Fruit call'd <HI>Ananas,</HI> which was at first
brought from the <HI>West</HI> into the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where it is now to be had in great
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bundance: It is about the bigness of a Citron, of a yellow Colour, and well
scented, full of Iuice, and pleasant in taste, if eaten when ripe; for it is much
like Strawberries with Wine and Sugar: Upon the top it is crown'd with a
Cluster of Flowers and Leaves, and at a distance is not unlike an Artichoke,
but hath no Pricks at the corners: The middlemost Stalk being the biggest,
upon which the Fruit grows, is about two Foot high, and has fifteen or sixteen
Leaves, Round about this Stalk grow other lesser ones, with young Fruit up∣on
each. Whosoever will eat of this Fruit, must first of all take off the out∣ward
Skin, and then cut it into pieces, and so infuse them in Wine or Water,
to draw out the biting Quality that is in it, otherwise it will make Blisters
upon the Tongue: nor is that all, for it is very dangerous to eat of it, be∣cause
<FIGURE>

it is apt to put one into a Bloody-flux. And though this Fruit be hot,
yet the Leaves thereof are cooling, having a sowre and corrosive Quality,
which is only found in cooling Herbs; and the main hazard is produc'd by
its pleasantness, which is such, that it will melt in the Mouth like Sugar.</P>
<P>In <HI>Quantung</HI> is a certain Fruit call'd <HI>Musa:</HI> The Tree whereon it grows is
very delightful, as well for height as its large spreading Arms, and call'd by
some <HI>The Indian Fig-Tree:</HI> The Leaves are nine handfuls long, and two and
a half broad; the one side of a brown Colour, and the other Green. It shoots
forth several Branches, upon which hang the Figs, which are of several kinds;
for some are yellow, long, pleasant of taste, and well scented; others green,
long, and well tasted; but both hard of digestion: nevertheless it breeds
good Blood, and cures the Cough. And the Bark of the Tree is good against
Agues and other Distempers.</P>

<P>AS kind Nature hath abundantly provided and bless'd <HI>China</HI> with all
manner of Trees, Bushes, Herbs, and Fruits; so it has made the same
no less fruitful in the product of all sorts of irrational Creatures, as
Beasts, Fishes, Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Four-footed Creatures.</HEAD>
<P>THe Sheep in <HI>China</HI> are like those of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> having long and
thick Tails, which they drag after them, weighing forty or fifty Pound:
their Flesh is very sweet.</P>
<P>Near the Garrison of <HI>Tieki</HI> is great store of Cows, having very long, thick
and curl'd Tails, which the <HI>Chinese</HI> Soldiers wear for Ornament in their Caps
in stead of Feathers.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="132"/>
Near to the Cities of <HI>Cingcheu</HI> and <HI>Tengcheu,</HI> there is found in the Maw of
a Cow a Stone call'd <HI>Nienhoang,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Yellow of the Cow,</HI> by reason
of its Colour: It is of several sizes, and sometimes as big as a Goose Egg:
And although it be not altogether so firm and close as the <HI>Bezoar</HI> Stone, and
consequently lighter, yet is it by the <HI>Chineses</HI> valued and esteemed much
before it: It seems outwardly to be Chalk, and is much commended for se∣veral
uses.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> is a Creature which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>The Swift
Cow;</HI> for it is so nimble of foot, that it can run more than three hundred
Miles in a day.</P>
<P>In <HI>Cincheu</HI> is a certain Beast very like a Cow, having Horns much whiter
than Ivory, which is an exceeding great lover of Salt; and therefore when at
any time the Huntsmen go abroad to take any of them, they carry Bags of
Salt with them, which they lay as a Bait; and on this they will feed with such
greediness, that they rather suffer themselves to be kill'd, than leave off their
so dearly beloved Prey.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> and especially in the City of <HI>Nanchang,</HI> the In∣habitants
feed their Hogs as well within the City as without, by means
whereof there are such great and swarming Herds continually kept in the
Streets, that they are hardly passable; yet they are always kept very clean,
great numbers of People being continually employ'd in taking away the
Filth.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Peking</HI> there are some Cats with very long Hair, as white
as Milk, and having long Ears like a Spaniel: The Gentlewomen keep them
for their Pleasure; for they will not hunt after, or catch Mice, the reason per∣haps
being for that they are too high fed: Yet they have store of other Cats
which are good Mousers.</P>
<P>In the Provinces of <HI>Iunnan</HI> and <HI>Suchue</HI> are the best Horses. And in the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Xensi,</HI> upon the Mountain <HI>Holan</HI> (three hundred Miles large) are many
wild Horses. Their Horses are generally but of a mean stature, yet well set,
broad Buttock'd, and strong for Service.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Siven</HI> are yellow Mice, very large, whose Skins are in much request
amongst the People.</P>
<P>In all Parts of <HI>China,</HI> especially in the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> are abundance
of Stags, Bucks, Hares, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Xantung</HI> are many ravenous Wolves: And in <HI>Xensi</HI> abundance of Bears,
the Fore-feet whereof are held in great esteem by the Natives.</P>
<P>Near to the Chief City <HI>Linyao</HI> lie some Mountains, upon which are bred
wild Oxen, and Creatures like Tygers, with whose Skins the Inhabitants make
their Clothes.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchue,</HI> near the City <HI>Po,</HI> is a Creature call'd <HI>The Rhino∣ceros:</HI>
It is of a swarthy hue like the Elephant: the Skin is full of Wrincles,
and so hard withal, that it can scarcely be pierc'd with a Sword: It has a
Snout like a Hog, but sharper; and above the Nostrils stands the Horn, which
is generally black; now and then there is one white, but very seldom, and
that is sold much dearer than the other; and indeed one is larger than the
other, according to the age of the Beast.</P>
<P>In bigness and thickness of Body the <HI>Rhinoceros</HI> differs but little from the
Elephant, only it has much shorter Feet; and that's the reason why it is not
so comely to the Eye. This Creature is of that temper, that it will hurt no

</FIGURE>
bod, unless it be first assaulted, and then it falls on with great fury, not only
upon him that gave the Offence, but upon every thing that comes in its way,
which he will never leave till he hath destroy'd it. When he has got a Man
down, he kills him with a lick of his Tongue, which is both sharp and rough;
afterwards tears off his Flesh to the very Bones; but his ordinary Food is
thorny Bushes. He is always at enmity with the Elephant, to whom before
he goes to gives Battel, he whets his Horn against a Stone, and in Fight endea∣vors
to wound him in the Belly, which he knows to be the weakest part. He
makes a noise like the Grunting of Hogs. The <HI>Moors</HI> eat his Flesh; but it re∣quires
good Stomachs as well as Teeth to feed upon him. Some use the Horn
as an Antidote or Preservative against Poyson.</P>
<P>There are great store of Tygers in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> mischievous and
fierce, according to their Nature: But upon the Mountain <HI>Kutien</HI> are some
that will not hurt a Man.</P>
<P>In several Parts of <HI>China</HI> also are Elephants bred, but the best are in the Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Nanking</HI> and <HI>Iunnan:</HI> I shall only add a few words concerning them,
so much hauing been already said by several Authors. Their bigness is vari∣ous:
At <HI>Constantinople</HI> was one seen, which from the Eyes to the furthermost
part of the Back, was eleven Foot, and from the Eyes to the end of his Snout,
eight Foot long. In heighth some are twelve, others thirteen and fourteen Foot.
They are generally black; but some <HI>Chinese</HI> Writers affirm, that the King of
<HI>Nazaringa</HI> had a white one. Their Skin is like Net-work, but so extraordinary
hard, that it will turn the Edge of a Sword; yet it is harder upon the Back
than the Belly. For the chewing of their Meat, they have four Teeth within,
besides those that stick out before, which stand crooked in the Male, and
down-right in the Female. The nether Iaw-bone is only mov'd in chewing,
the upper always rests. In that part where the Nose is plac'd in other Crea∣tures,
the Elephant has a long Trunk or Snout, which reaches to the Ground,
and has a Slit at the end: This is both pliable and slippery, which they make
use of in stead of a Hand; for they can take up any thing with it either moist
or dry, and put it into their Mouths.</P>
<P>Of the extraordinary Docility of this Beast there are several Examples to
be found, both in the ancient and modern, as well <HI>Chinese</HI> as other Writers.
<FIGURE>
<PB N="235" REF="133"/>
</FIGURE>
<HI>Pliny</HI> writes, That they fling up Arms into the Air, and that they Fence with
one another. Of the time and manner of Copulation there is great variety
among Historians; <HI>Pliny</HI> says, That the Male and the Female at ten years old
begin to couple: But <HI>Aristotle</HI> gives them a longer time, ascribing twenty to
them both, the Female at twelve, and the Male at eight years. This Act of
Generation they do most commonly in the Water, as being most easie for them
both; and that in the most private Recesses they can find out, and but once in
three years; neither doth the Male make use of one Female any more than
once: After they have done Coupling they grow wild and furious, doing
much hurt where they come. How long they go before they cast their Young
is uncertain; some speak of a Year and six Months, others say three years, and
some ten. They bring forth with great pain, leaning backward upon their
hinder Legs. Some write, that they bring forth but one at a time, others four:
As soon as it is brought forth it sees, goes, and sucks with the Mouth, and not
with the Snout, till it is eight years old. They wage War with the <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI>
Lion, Snake, Tyger, Ram, Hog, and Dragon, as also with some Colours,
and with Fire.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Iunnan,</HI> the Hill <HI>Nalo</HI> is full of wild Tygers and Leopards;
and so also is the Mountain <HI>Xepao.</HI> In the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> they are much
fiercer than Lions, and very hot and eager in the pursuit of Men, Women, and
Children. But Nature has in some sort provided a means whereby to avoid
the cruelty of this Beast; for it is always accompanied with a small Creature,
which with continual Barking gives notice of its coming; upon which noise
every living thing endeavors to get out of the way by flight, or otherwise.
The People of <HI>Bengala</HI> stand in very great dread of this Beast. The Tyger and
<HI>Rhinoceros</HI> (as <HI>Bontius</HI> writes) are great Friends to one another, conversing
much together; the reason whereof the Islanders of <HI>Iapan</HI> told me, was, as they
suppos'd, and which is not improbable, because the Tyger is altogether a de∣vourer
of Flesh, which must of necessity occasion a weak Stomach; whereas
the <HI>Rhinoceros</HI> feeds only upon Green: therefore the Tyger follows him for
his Dungs sake, which he eats for a Cure when he is out of order, as the Dogs
Grass, and the Cats Nip or Cats-mint.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi</HI> are very large Hogs, with great and strong Bristles
<PB N="236" REF="134"/>
of a Foot and a half long, which by a particular and strange motion of the
Body they know how to dart toward any one, and that not without great pre∣judice
of those they hit.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xensi</HI> is found the Creature call'd <HI>Xee,</HI> from whom pro∣ceeds
the Musk; and which is very strange, if at any time it be carried out of
the Kingdom of <HI>Lu,</HI> into the adjacent Kingdom of <HI>Laos,</HI> it dies immediately,
as a Fish out of the Water.</P>
<P>In the Kingdom of <HI>Gannan</HI> is a certain Creature call'd <HI>Tese,</HI> which in shape
comes very near to a Man, having long Arms: he is black and hairy upon
the Body, swift of Foot, and laughs aloud like a Man, but is of so voracious a
nature, that whomsoever he meets with he instantly devours.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchue</HI> lies a Mountain call'd <HI>Toyung,</HI> upon which are
Monkies or Baboons, which for bigness and shape are very like a Man. These
Creatures are more than ordinarily addicted to Venery, so that they often at∣tempt
to surprise Women on purpose to satisfie their beastial lust, and have
their wills on them. The <HI>Indians</HI> call them <HI>Wild Men,</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Women
are in such fear of them, that they dare not come near those Woods where they
frequent.</P>

<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> are an innumerable company of Ducks, which
the Inhabitants take great delight to breed and increase. They never suffer the
Duck to sit upon her Eggs to hatch them, but put them into an Oven mode∣rately
heated, or else bury them in a Dunghil, and so hatch the young ones.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> near to the City <HI>Hanyang,</HI> may be caught great

before and after which time they are not to be had, in regard they hide them∣selves.</P>
<P>Near to the Island <HI>Hainan</HI> are caught Whales, after the same manner as the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>English</HI> take them in the North about <HI>Greenland,</HI> whereof they
make Oyl which serves for several uses. Of these commonly some are a hun∣dred
and twenty Foot long; the Head whereof is reckon'd for a third part of
the whole Body: Upon the top of the Snout are two round Holes, by which
means they will take in a great quantity of Water, and spout it out again with
a mighty force. In stead of Eyes they have two thin Skins which stick out,
and are three Yards long, and a Foot and a half broad, and cover'd over with
Stuff like unto Flocks. On each side of the Head it hath an Ear, which is much
smaller without than within, whereby they are very quick of Hearing. It
hath a very large Mouth, with Lips of so great a thickness, that they have
sometimes five or six thousand weight of Fat upon them. The Tongue, which
is about eighteen Foot long, and ten broad, rests upon eight hundred small
and great Pegs or Teeth, which are all cover'd with Stuff like Horse-hair, to
preserve the Tongue from being hurt as it lies upon them. They feed upon
Fish, and the Froth and Scum of the Sea. There was once one taken that had
forty Cod-Fishes in her Belly. The Tail is at the end almost twenty eight
Foot broad, and two thick. The Male hath a Pizzle about fourteen Foot
long. They bring forth but one at a time, and that in the Harvest, which stays
by the Female under the protection of her Fins, till it is grown of a large size.
It stands in great fear of the Sword-Fish, which is a mortal Enemy unto it,
and who with its sharp Saw endeavors to rip open the tender Belly of this
Prodigy of Nature. The manner of killing them has been sufficiently descri∣bed
by others, and therefore I shall forbear to trouble the Reader with a Re∣lation

<P>THE Province of <HI>Xensi</HI> is subject, among many other Inconveniences,
to this, that it hath more want of Rain than the other Northern Parts;
and this occasions every where such infinite swarms of Grashoppers, that they
continually devour the growth of the Fields, notwithstanding all the Care and
and industrious Diligence of the Inhabitants to prevent the same: And this
is the true cause why there is very seldom any green Grass to be seen in that
whole Province. But these very Vermin supply the Defect they cause, by be∣coming
good Food, insomuch that of these Grashoppers the People make a
delicate Dish for their Tables.</P>
<P>The whole Country of <HI>China</HI> hath great numbers of Silk-worms, but in no
part are they in so great abundance as in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> the Inhabi∣tants
whereof spend the greatest part of their time in tending, looking after,
and taking care to increase them,</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> the Trees and Fields hang sometimes full of
Silk, which is not spun by the fore-mention'd Silk-worm, but another sort,
and consisteth of long Threds of white Silk, which being carried by the Wind
upon the Trees and Houses, is gather'd together. Of this sort they weave
Stuffs, but it is far courser then that which is wove of the former; but this
is recompensed by its durableness; for it is much stronger.</P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> are also found several strange Creatures, which live as well upon
the Land as in the Water; namely, in the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> in the River
of <HI>Siang,</HI> lives a certain Creature like a Horse, only in stead of Hair it has Scales
upon the Body, and Claws like a Tyger. It is of a very fierce and cruel Na∣ture,
and will fasten upon any thing when it comes out of the Water, whether
Man or Beast.</P>
<P>In <HI>Quantung,</HI> near the City <HI>Hoeicheu,</HI> is a Creature which is neither Fish nor
Fowl, but between both; for all the Summer it is a Bird of a yellow Colour,
and therefore call'd <HI>Hoangcioya,</HI> and keeps upon the Mountains; but in the
Winter it turns Fish again, and betakes it self to the Water. The People eat of
it with great delight and satisfaction.</P>
<P>Near the City <HI>Caocheu,</HI> in the River <HI>Co,</HI> are abundance of very mischievous
Crocodiles: they are by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Caiman,</HI> having an Hide as hard
as Iron, and only soft upon the Belly. This <HI>Caiman</HI> has a broad Forehead,
and a Hog-like Snout, with a very wide Mouth: Its Teeth are large, white▪
and strong, fix'd in both the Iaws, whereof only the uppermost moves; for
the lowermost is fix'd and immovable: It has no Tongue, but only a Ski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="239" REF="135"/>
that cleaves to the lower Iaw, being much like a Tongue: It has large round
black Eyes: The Legs are strong, and the Feet Arm'd with sharp Nails: The
Tail is as long as the rest of the Body: It is said, that he can live four Months
without eating; but at last being hungry, he howls or cries out like a Man.
These Serpents are very swift of foot, but cannot so well wind and turn, by
reason of their stiff Back-bones. They are not onely found here, but in other
parts of <HI>India, Africa, Asia,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> especially in the River <HI>Nyle</HI> in <HI>Egypt.</HI>
They live upon Fish or Flesh, and when they come Ashore they prey upon
Cattel: When they Couple, the Male lays the Female upon her Back, other∣wise
by reason of the shortness of his Feet he could not Copulate. The Female
lays sixty Eggs, of the bigness of a Goose Egg, and is hatching of them sixty
days. There is no Creature to be found, that from so small a beginning grows
to such a largeness; for some are thirty Foot long. They are at enmity with
the Tyger, Serpents, Scorpions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but at amity with Hogs, which they suf∣fer
to pass by them unregarded. In the Day this Creature lives upon the Land,
and in the Night in the Water. When it is gorg'd with eating, and is fall'n
asleep with his Mouth full of Meat, a small Bird call'd <HI>Trochicus,</HI> and in <HI>Italian,
The King of Birds,</HI> comes to him as he lies with his Mouth open, and cleanses
his Teeth with picking and scraping; wherewith the Crocodile is so highly
pleas'd, that he opens his Throat as wide as is possible, that so the Bird may
scoure the same: for which kindness it bears it much friendship. The <HI>Chineses</HI>
eat the Flesh thereof with great delight. It is reported, that <HI>Termus</HI> King of
<HI>Egypt</HI> swam amongst them stark naked, having his Body only anointed with
the Grease of them.</P>
<P>In the River <HI>Chaoking</HI> is a Fish call'd <HI>The Swimming Cow,</HI> which comes often
out of the Water, and fights at Land with the tame Cows, to their great ha∣zard,
till its Horns grow weak by staying out of the Water, which may be
discerned by their turning yellow; then with all speed it returns into the
Water, where the Horns grow hard again.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Caocheu</HI> there is to be seen a strange kind of Creature in the Sea, ha∣ving
a Head like a Bird, and a Tail like a Fish: In its Belly are found some
Precious Stones.</P>
<P>Between this City and the Island <HI>Hainan</HI> are taken a sort of Crabs, which as
soon as they are out of the Water become petrifi'd, and immediately turn into
Stones. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> make great use of them for the Cure of
Agues.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchue</HI> near the City of <HI>Chunking,</HI> are great store of Land-Tortoises
of several sizes; some very large, and others very small, which the
Inhabitants keep in their Houses for their Pleasure.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Quantung,</HI> near to <HI>Hoeicheu,</HI> there are caught in the Sea such very large
Tortoises, that they look like little Rocks at a distance. The Land as well as
the Sea-Tortoises engender after the manner of the Adder-Snake, the Male
getting upon the Female. They lay Eggs like Hens Eggs, but lesser, and
more oval. It is said of them, that they live under Ground in the Winter
without eating: They are afraid of the Eagle, which makes a prey of them
taking them up, and letting them fall till they break. They make but little
noise, yet louder than the Snake. Whether they are to be reckon'd amongst
Flesh or Fish, is still to be determin'd. Some account them amongst Fish,
and eat them in <HI>Lent;</HI> others think the contrary, because they have Feet, and
draw Breath.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="136"/>
The Land-Tortoise Shells are very hard, and like Ebony, nor will they
bend like those of the Sea; but they are full of Knobs upon the top, and most
of them of fine Colours, yellow and brown, as if they were Painted with
Crosses, Stars, and other Figures. They thrust out their Heads and Feet, which
when they draw in, as they can at pleasure, they seem to be immovable: They
differ very much in bigness, some being no bigger than a Man's Fist.</P>
<P>In <HI>Virginia</HI> are Tortoises of three and four Foot long, with two Heads;
which are very malicious, and given to biting.</P>
<P>In the Island <HI>Mauritius</HI> are some Tortoises so large, that they will carry four
or five Men standing upon them. Their Shells are of so capacious an extent,
that ten Persons may sit in one of them. But the Sea-Tortoises are much
larger than those of the Land. <HI>Iohn de Lery</HI> writes, That there was one taken
by their Fleet, which gave eighty Persons their Bellies full. Their Shells are
much smoother and flatter than the other, and very curiously wrinkled. In hot
Water they will bend into any shape, which the other cannot do by reason of
its hardness; so that Artificers make Combs and Boxes of them. In stead of
Feet they have Fins, wherewith they swim as other Fish; but they lie much
upon their Backs, and swim sleeping upon the Water. The Flesh of this Crea∣ture
is luscious, and tastes like Veal, being interlarded with yellowish Fat.
The Female lays her Eggs by Night, and buries them in the Sand, which are
hatch'd in six Weeks by the heat of the Sun.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some things more than Natural, and strange Pools.</HEAD>
<P>IN the last seven Chapters I spoke of great and admirable things, yet such
as are not beyond the ordinary Course of Nature; but in this I shall treat
of some more wonderful, which are hard to be credited, though the <HI>Chine∣ses</HI>
do firmly believe the same.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> near the City <HI>Vucung,</HI> is a Hill call'd <HI>Taipe,</HI> where∣upon
if a Drum be beaten, presently followeth Thunder, Lightning, and
stormy Weather, insomuch that the Magistrates have forbidden all Persons
upon pain of Death, to beat any Drum there.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Tan</HI> has red Fish, with whose Blood (as the <HI>Chineses</HI> write and
fancy) whosoever anoint their Feet, they may wade over this River without
sinking; adding further, That if the Water of this River be but stirr'd, all the
Fish presently rise and swim upon the top of the Water, and make it look as
red as Fire: from whence in probability it had its Name; for <HI>Tan</HI> signifies
<HI>Red.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> near the City <HI>Niuyang,</HI> is a Spring in high esteem
amongst the Inhabitants; for they verily believe, that whosoever drinks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
it makes them long-liv'd.</P>
<P>In <HI>Suchue,</HI> near the City <HI>Chingtu,</HI> is the most large and extensive Mountain
<HI>Chingching,</HI> upon which, according to the vain belief of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> the immor∣tal
Men meet to Converse.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> upon Mountains of an incredible heighth and
bigness, inhabit none but wild and unciviliz'd People.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Liencheng,</HI> a City of <HI>Quantung,</HI> lies a great Hill call'd <HI>Uhoang,</HI> where
<PB N="241" REF="136"/>
grows a sort of Fruit whose like is not to be found any where else; for you
may eat as much as you please, but you must carry none away, and while you
endeavor so to do, you can never find the way down.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Iunnan,</HI> near the City <HI>Chinkiang,</HI> is to this day a great Stone
to be seen, where <HI>Simulo,</HI> who possess'd the Kingdom of <HI>Mung,</HI> gave Audience
to the Ambassadors of another King, who upon the delivery of their Message
not satisfying him, he arising in anger, and taking his Sword naked into his
Hand, struck with it so violently upon the Stone, that the Blow pierc'd above
three Foot into it, and with threatning words said to the Ambassadors, <HI>Go and
acquaint your King what Swords I have.</HI> This hapned in the Reign of <HI>Iliaouvus,</HI> the
Founder of the Race of <HI>Hana,</HI> which incorporated the powerful Kingdom of
<HI>Mung</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Near the City <HI>Munghoa,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Fung∣hoang,</HI>
which tooks its Name from the Phenix, because it died upon the same,
after it had sung there a while most deliciously. The <HI>Chineses</HI> relate, That there
is a general Assembly of Birds once every year upon this Mountain, to lament
the Death of the said Phenix; of which time the Inhabitants taking notice,
climb up by Night with Lights, and catch abundance of them.</P>
<P>Near the City <HI>Fuencheu</HI> is the Mountain <HI>Vanhu,</HI> which is reputed the highest
of all Hills; and this Name was given to it, because ten thousand People, in
the time of the Inundation of the World, got upon the top of this Mountain
to avoid the danger of drowning.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Tingcheu</HI> is a Mountain call'd <HI>Kin,</HI> upon which are three Pools,
which turn Iron that is flung into them, into Copper immediately.</P>
<P>There are several other strange Pools, Springs, and Wells to be found in
<HI>China,</HI> some whereof are very soveraign for the cure of several Distempers of
the Body.</P>
<P>On the West side of the City <HI>Caifung,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> lies a Pool
call'd <HI>Kinning,</HI> which the Imperial Race of <HI>Sunga</HI> caus'd to be digg'd for the
disciplining and training up Sea-men, to make them expert in Sea-Fights,
which was very much us'd by the Emperor <HI>Taicungus.</HI> This Pool is so very
pleasant, that round about the same are built several brave Palaces of the Gran∣dees,
besides divers Idol-Temples.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Chinese Kings and Emperors, which have Govern'd in
China before and since Christ's Birth.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I make mention of the Wars between the People of <HI>China</HI> and the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> I shall speak in short concerning the Genealogy of the Kings
and Emperors who have Reigned there before and since the Birth of
<HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>First then observe, That before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, between the Years of the
World 2207. and the Year 2952. eight hundred succeeded one another in the
Government of that Empire, which took not the same by Inheritance, but af∣ter
the death of one, another was elected by plurality of Voices. But after
that time the Government became Hereditary, and the next Heir to the pre∣ceding
King succeeded after his death.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="137"/>
The first eight Elective Kings were <HI>Fohius, Xinnungus, Hoangtius, Xaohavus,
Chuenhious, Cous, Yaus,</HI> and <HI>Xunus.</HI> All the Transactions during the Reign of
these eight Elective Kings, and the following Imperial Races, before and af∣ter
the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> are not in the least doubted, but firmly believ'd by all
the People, in regard the Histories of those Times are faithfully transferr'd to
Posterity by the then Chronologers: for it has been a constant (and without
doubt) a most laudible Custom amongst them, that the new Emperor doth ap∣point
and order some of the most Learned Philosophers to write the Deeds
and Actions of his Predecessor at large, without fraud or flattery. Out of this
voluminous Work, which comprehends in general all the great Transactions
of the whole Empire, the <HI>Chineses,</HI> for ease of Memory, have made an Extract
or Epitome of the most remarkable Passages. But as to what pass'd before the
eight elected Emperors, the <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves are very doubtful, because the
Books of those Times are full of ridiculous Stories, as well relating to the
Age of the People, as the Years of the Governors: for according to the phan∣tastick
belief of those Writers, the World must have been created some thou∣sands
of years before the Flood.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to the Lives and Actions of these eight Emperors, I shall
in a few words declare what Kings and Princes are feigned to have had the
Rule over <HI>China,</HI> before the Government of <HI>Fohius</HI> the first of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> feign, That the first Man, whom they also own for their first
Governor, was call'd <HI>Puoncuus,</HI> and had his Original out of a confus'd Lump,
as out of an Egg; though some of the more Learned in <HI>Europe</HI> are of opinion,
That <HI>Cainan</HI> or <HI>Kenan,</HI> the Son of <HI>Enos,</HI> was the first Man that with his Follow∣ers
Peopled <HI>China,</HI> and that from him they all had their rise. They also add,
That this <HI>Cainan</HI> was preferr'd to the Government when he was five hundred
years old, and that after him the eight Elect Emperors Govern'd those Coun∣tries
and Inhabitants, as hath been and shall be more fully related: Yet they
tell us, That after the decease of this <HI>Puoncuus,</HI> one <HI>Tienhoangus</HI> succeeded in
the Government; of whose Time a certain <HI>Chinese</HI> Historian speaks thus: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that time the Spirit of Heaven cover'd the Face of the Earth, and by degrees introduc'd
good Manners, and taught the People, being then very decible, Civility and Morality; but
especially when the great Dragon was kill'd, which had molested the whole World by ming∣ling
Heaven and Earth together: after his Death, every thing receiving a more illustrious
form and Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>After him, they say, succeeded one <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>angus,</HI> who was very skilful in the
Course of the Stars, distinguish'd the Day and Nights by Name, and ordering
every Month to consist of thirty Days. When he was deceased, they write,
That nine other Princes succeeded; but they are altogether ignorant both of
their Names and Actions.</P>
<P>After these nine follow'd, according to their Legend, <HI>Ginhoangus,</HI> with nine
more of his Family. He divided the Country into nine Parts, whereof one was
given to the People to inhabit, and the other eight he appointed for Husban∣dry:
and by this means he brought the People, who at first, as wild and un∣civiliz'd,
liv'd dispers'd, to bring their Habitations near together, though yet
they had no Houses. His Reign, they say, was a Golden Age for the Earth
brought forth Fruit of it self without much Labor. This Prince cared for his
Subjects with more then a Fatherly Love, who on the other hand honor'd and
serv'd him, as dutiful Children obey their Father.</P>
<P>After him follow'd one <HI>Yeus,</HI> who instructed the People that had long liv'd
<PB N="243" REF="137"/>
in Holes and Caves of the Mountains, to make Huts and little Edifices of
Wood, to defend themselves against the fury of wild Beasts: for till this time
they were ignorant of most things useful for the support and sustenance of
Life; for they had not so much as heard of Husbandry, nor knew how to
strike Fire, wherewith either to dress their Victuals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to refresh the Body;
but they liv'd only upon wild Herbs and Fruits, and devour'd the raw Flesh
of wild Creatures, and drank their Blood, going for the most naked, or at the
best wearing only the undress'd Skin of some wild Creature they had kill'd,
about some part of their Body.</P>
<P>After the death of this <HI>Yeus, Sujus</HI> Reigned, who was very skilful in <HI>Astro∣logy.</HI>
He taught, that there were five Elements, as Metal, Wood, Earth, and
Fire; which last he observ'd in the Air. He was also the first that made the
discovery of Fire, by rubbing one piece of Wood against another. There was
no kind of Money or Coyn, either Silver or Gold in his Days; but they ex∣chang'd
Commodity for Commodity, by way of Barter. Thus far their
hardly-believ'd Histories proceed; which whether true or false, shall be no
Task for me to discover; but leaving them as they are, I shall return to speak
of the eight Elect Emperors before-mention'd, the first whereof was <HI>Fohius,</HI>
whom the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Thiensu,</HI> that is, <HI>The Son of Heaven;</HI> and by this Title
they still call all their Emperors. They say, and haply believe it, that he was
brought into the World by his Mother without a Father; for as she was walk∣ing
by the side of the Pool which runs through the City <HI>Lanthien,</HI> in the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Xensi,</HI> she trod accidentally (as Fame suggests it) in the Foot-steps of
a Man which was in the Sand; upon which, being immediately with <HI>Iris</HI> or
the Rain-bow, she prov'd to be with Child, and at her full time brought
forth this <HI>Fohius</HI> in that Province, who took upon him the Government two
thousand nine hundred and fifty two years before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, and Reigned
a hundred and fifteen years.</P>
<P>This Emperor was a Man of a most upright and vertuous Disposition, very
well skill'd in <HI>Astrology,</HI> seeking thereby as well to know and understand the
Motions of the Heavens and Stars, as to be fam'd for the well managing of
Earthly Affairs; and indeed he made discovery of several things relating to
<HI>Astrology,</HI> and introduc'd very good Laws, whereby he kept his Subjects in awe,
reducing the same into Writing, having for that purpose invented the first and
most ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters.</P>
<P>Till this Princes Time there was in <HI>China</HI> among the Men and Women no
difference, either of Habit or Manner; neither did they know the civiliz'd
Limits of lawful Wedlock, but liv'd as Beasts, in common one among ano∣ther.
Both these things he reform'd, ordaining the sacred Rites of Marriage,
and ordering the Men to wear their Clothes distinct in fashion from those of
the Women.</P>
<P><HI>Xinnungus</HI> was elected Emperor after the death of <HI>Fohius,</HI> by reason of his
eminent Vertues, and Reigned a hundred and forty years. He first invented
the use of the Plough for tillage of the Ground, and taught the Inhabitants the
use thereof, who finding the Benefit thereof, began to manure the Land of
their own accord, which required their Industry with a plentiful Crop of Fruit
for the better sustenance of Life; and for this reason they call'd him <HI>Xinnungi,</HI>
which signifies <HI>The Ingenious Husbandman.</HI> He was also a diligent Searcher into
the Vertues of all Herbs and Plants, making Experiments thereof upon his
own Body. After he had Reigned a hundred years, one <HI>Hoangtius,</HI> a petty
<PB N="244" REF="138"/>
King, his Neighbor, made War upon him, and after having defeated and
kill'd him, won also the Kingdom. The Defeat was receiv'd upon the Moun∣tain
<HI>Fano,</HI> in the Place where now the City <HI>Peking</HI> is situate, in the Province of
<HI>Peking;</HI> the Inhabitants of which Place still retain some memory of that War,
it being, as they say, the first that ever was wag'd in the World. And thus by
force of Arms <HI>Hoangtius</HI> came to the Empire, who nevertheless for Vertue,
goodness of Mind, and comely shape of Face and Body, was hardly ever to be
paralell'd. He made several good Laws, and particularly order'd just Weights
and Measures: But all these Vertues were in some measure sullied by his
seeming Tyranny; for he always kept an Army on foot, wherewith he kept
the Rebellious in awe: And indeed there was nothing blame-worthy in him
but this, and his treacherous falling upon the foregoing Emperor, and taking
his Kingdom from him: However, he Govern'd very prudently, and had a
particular care of the Welfare of his Subjects; one testimony whereof appear'd
in his advancing Commerce, which hitherto had been hindred by unpassable
Ways: for effecting whereof to the best advantage and accommodation
of Trade and Travellers, he caus'd Ways to be digg'd through Hills and
Mountains, by the same means likewise enlarging the Territories of his Em∣pire.</P>
<P>He was the first in this Country that introduc'd the Imperial Crown, and
other Ceremonies and Marks of Majesty, using blue and yellow Clothes, in
imitation of the two Colours of Heaven and Earth. He invented the Art of
Dying several Colours, and then commanded the more Wealthy People to
distinguish themselves from the Poor, by wearing Apparel different in co∣lour.
Where Rivers were great and broad, for the better and more easie trans∣fretation,
he caus'd the Trunks of Trees to be hollow'd out in the form of
Boats; but over the smaller, and such as were narrow, he order'd Bridges to
be made: And finding that difference in Commodities hindred Dealing, for
promotion of Trade he order'd Brass-Money to be Coyn'd; and to defend
both it and themselves against an Enemy, he not only found out the Inven∣tion
of Arms, but taught his Subjects how to handle them. There is a Report
(which is certainly strange, but how true I will not decide) That in the Hall
of his Palace there grew an Herb of that Nature and Vertue, that if an unjust
Person came into the same, it would turn and bow towards him, as the Sun-Flower
doth to the Sun.</P>
<P>He had by his Wives twenty five Children, amongst which were fourteen
lawfully begotten, and liv'd to see them at Man's Estate: nay, which is more,
they report he never died, but was receiv'd amongst the <HI>Xinsien,</HI> that is, <HI>The
Immortal:</HI> and doubtless this may with great Reason be said of him, for his
Name was immortaliz'd for his Vertue; all the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors since his Time
taking to themselves the by-Name of <HI>Hoangtius,</HI> as the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors after
the first <HI>Caesar</HI> assum'd the Name of <HI>Caesars.</HI> After his death his Son <HI>Xaohavus</HI>
succeeded him in his Throne (being nothing inferior to his Father for Vertue
and Goodness) in the Year 2597. before the <HI>Incarnation:</HI> He Reigned eighty
four years, and was the first of all the Emperors that caus'd a distinction in the
Degrees and Dignities of the <HI>Mandorins</HI> or Magistrates, by their several bear∣ings
of Birds and Colours; for it is a Custom to this day, for every Magistrate
to wear a particular colour'd Habit, whereby his Place and Employment may
be known: to which end they bear a Bird, or some other Mark, embroider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
with Gold and Silver, both behind upon the Back, and before upon the Breast,
<PB N="245" REF="138"/>
that so every one that meets them may know what Place and Dignity he en∣joys:
which Notes or Badges of distinctions are easily known; for such as
have any Employment in the Civil Magistracy, have always tame Birds for
their Cognisance; but the Commanders over the Armies have Dragons,
Lions, Tygers, and the like wild Creatures, which declare the destructive
nature of War. The Emperor <HI>Xaohavus</HI> made choice of Birds for this use be∣fore
any other Creatures, because at the beginning of his Reign, the Bird of
the Sun appear'd, which was a sign of much prosperity of the Empire: for if
these Birds are long before they come, the <HI>Chineses</HI> firmly believe, that the Im∣perial
Race will not be of long continuance, but that there will be Wars
made upon them. What sort of Bird this is I could never understand, but ac∣cording
to its shape, as they describe it, it is not unlike an Eagle, only the Fea∣thers
are very curious, as well for singularity of Colours as other beauty. But
in regard it so very rarely appears, it may be suppos'd to be the Phenix, by
them call'd <HI>Fughoang.</HI></P>
<P>This Emperor having Reign'd many years, to the great satisfaction of the
Inhabitants, and by reason of his Age not being able any longer to take care of
the Affairs of his Dominions, one <HI>Chuenhious,</HI> Nephew to <HI>Hoangtius,</HI> upon the
account of his extraordinary good Qualities, was Substituted to the Admini∣stration
of the Government in the Year 2513 before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, and Reigned
seventy eight years. He continu'd the vertuous Courses of his Ancestors, both
in Religious and Worldly Concerns. Amongst others, he caus'd a Law to be
made, That no Person, of what Quality soever, should be admitted to Offer to
the Gods, but the Emperor only; so great an esteem they had in those days of
Ecclesiastical Employments, that they were not to be Exercis'd by any but the
greatest Princes.</P>
<P>No sooner wat <HI>Chuenhious</HI> dead, but his Nephew <HI>Cous</HI> succeeded him, being
as his Predecessors, very eminent in all manner of Vertue and Goodness: He
was chosen Emperor two thousand four hundred thirty five years before <HI>Christ</HI>'s
Birth: He Married four Wives, which was very rare in those Days, and had
four Sons by them; one of them, nam'd <HI>Cious,</HI> he procur'd by performing
some Promise to the supreme Emperor of Heaven. Another of his Wives bore
a Son call'd <HI>Kius,</HI> who was said also to be given to her by the Gods, through
importunity of Prayer, having been always barren before. The third Woman
had a Child in the fourth Month of her Marriage, which was call'd <HI>Yaus,</HI> ha∣ving
first seen in her Sleep a red Dragon, which is held by the <HI>Chineses</HI> for a sign
of great Prosperity. The fourth had a Son call'd <HI>Cheus.</HI> This last was preferr'd
to the Throne by his Father <HI>Cous</HI> before all the rest, being observ'd by him to be
the most inclin'd to Vertue and Goodness: But the good old Man was much
mistaken; for he was no sooner in the Throne, but he fell into all manner of
Debauchery, giving himself up so much to Women and Drinking, that he neg∣lected
the Affairs of the State: And being often admonish'd by the Magistrates
to take better care of his Government, but continuing still in his lewdness, the
Subjects (who had been for the most part Govern'd by just and vertuous Prin∣ces)
judg'd that he was unworthy to Reign any longer, so that they depos'd
him in the ninth Year of his Reign, and set up his Brother <HI>Yaus</HI> in his Place.</P>
<P>This <HI>Yaus,</HI> who began to Reign in the Year 2357 before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, and
Govern'd ninety years, is renown'd in all the <HI>Chinese</HI> Histories for a most ver∣tuous
Prince: and certainly if regard be had to the greatness of his Actions,
and the whole course of his most exemplary Life, he may, for honorable,
<PB N="246" REF="139"/>
Atchievements, be compar'd with the best of Princes that ever sway'd that
Scepter. A certain Book call'd <HI>Xu,</HI> publish'd in his Reign, mentions in short
his Fame, in these words: <HI>The Noble and Heroick Actions of</HI> Yaus <HI>have fill'd the
whole World with Admiration; such was, his extraordinary Diligence, that he was esteem'd
by all Men for his Worth, Understanding, Civility, and quickness of Apprehension, according
to the grandeur of his Merit; and such his good Fortune, that whatsoever he undertook was
brought to pass by him.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> Histories tell us, That during his Govern∣ment,
the Sun did not Set for the space of ten days, and great fear possess'd the
People, that the World would have been destroy'd by a general Conflagra∣tion,
in regard there had hapned several great Fires at that time. They like∣wise
report, that at the same time several strange Monsters, as Snakes and
Dragons, crept out from under the Ground, and that this <HI>Yaus</HI> in these dismal
Times, and notwithstanding all those dreadful Accidents, carried himself
with so much Piety and Care for the Welfare of his Subjects, that he was look'd
upon by every body as the Redeemer and Deliverer of his Country.</P>
<P>To descent to Particulars concerning this Emperor; he was very much
addicted to <HI>Astrology,</HI> being instructed therein by the two famous Men, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us
and <HI>Hous,</HI> Persons more than ordinarily expert in that Science: But he was
not alone eminent for Knowledge and Industry; for his Wife the Empress
taught other Women how to breed and raise Silk-worms, and the Art of pre∣paring
and weaving of Silk. When he had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s civiliz'd the People, by his
own and Wifes Instructions, to the knowledge of Manufactures, he forthwith
new modell'd the Government, and introduc'd the six Iudicatures or Ben∣ches
of Iustice, to wit, <HI>Sipu, Hopu, Limpu, Pimpu, Cumpu,</HI> and <HI>Humpu.</HI></P>
<P>When he had thus setled the Affairs of his State in order, he depos'd himself,
and transferr'd the Government in his Life-time upon another; in which
more than ordinary Action he had more regard to the Good of the Publick,
than to the Welfare and Affection of his own Children and Relations, all
whom he voluntarily pass'd by, although no ways inferior to him in Know∣ledge
and uprightness of Life, and surrendred the Empire to a Stranger in
Blood, not for respect of his Princely Alliance, but only the Eminency of his
Vertue and Integrity.</P>
<P><HI>And as a singular Testimony of this his Zeal for the Good of his Country,
I shall onely give you this one Example; namely, Discoursing once with
one</HI> Fangius, <HI>an Eminent and Learned Person of his Council, he told him,</HI> That
he was in a very great suspence whom he should chuse to be his Successor. <HI>The Coun∣sellor
made him this Answer;</HI> There is one of your own Princely Family, your Eldest
Son <HI>Chus,</HI> and rightful Heir, upon whom you may settle your Empire; the goodness of
whose Nature, extraordinary Prudence, quickness of Wit, treading in your Royal Steps,
and imitating your laudable Exemplar, merits no less: And if your Servants Counsel be
acceptable to your Ears, I shall advise you to settle in the Government this your Eldest
Son, and no other. <HI>But</HI> Yaus <HI>interrupting his Discourse, said,</HI> You know, <HI>Fangius,</HI>
that I take as much distaste at the commending of Bad, as I do at the discommending
of Good People: My son is unready of Speech, and slow of Tongue, his Words and his
Deeds not agreeing; true it is, he knows in outward Gestures how to behave himself as
a Wise Man, but inwardly he is nothing.</P>
<P>Not long after, being about the seventieth Year of his Reign, he sent for
one <HI>Sungous,</HI> one of his greatest Favorites and Counsellors, to whom he spake
in this manner: <HI>I find the Weight of a Crown too heavy for my aged Head, and there∣fore
intend to surrender up my Empire to you, having in all my time observ'd none so fit
<PB N="247" REF="139"/>
for it, either for Vertue or Wisdom.</HI> But <HI>Sungous,</HI> unacquainted with Ambitious
Thoughts, absolutely refus'd to accept of it, modestly protesting his Insuffi∣ciency
for so great a Charge, for that he was not not furnish'd with those
Qualities wherewith an Emperor ought to be provided; and so neither wor∣thy
of that Honor, nor able to undergo the Burthen. When <HI>Yaus</HI> saw him
persisting immovably in his Resolution not to accept of the Government, he
demanded of him, whom he judg'd worthy of the same; to whom <HI>Sungous,</HI>
in the presence of the Emperor's Council, made this Answer: <HI>Since you are
pleas'd to inquire of me, O King, whom I judge worthy to be a Successor in your Empire,
though there are many others better able to advise in a Point of so high a Nature, yet I
shall acquaint you with that which I suppose and hope may tend to your own and the Em∣pires
Good. There is</HI> (said he proceeding) <HI>a Husbandman, your Subject, and a
Batchelor, look'd upon by all People for a very honest Man, who for his Piety, Vertue,
and good Disposition, is so belov'd and respected among his Neighbors, that they will
give or lend him their Monies, Lands, and Houses, without asking: And so great is
their Opinion of his Prudence, that upon all Occasions they ask his Advice, and follow it.
His Name is</HI> Xunus, <HI>who by his Vertuous and Exemplary Life hath reclaim'd many
vicious and debauch'd Persons, and brought them to be Imitators of his Goodness and
Sobriety; although his Misfortune is great in this, that his Father (call'd</HI> Cassus) <HI>is a
Fool; his Mother a pertinacious Woman, and full of Tongue; and his Brothers proud,
haughty, and wilful.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Yaus</HI> having heard this Relation, told him,
that he would send to inquire concerning the Abilities of this so unfortunate∣ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>extracted
Wise Man, which not long after he accordingly did, causing
him to be brought to the Court: At his first arrival he was entrusted with
the Government of the <HI>West</HI> Country only, that thereby the Emperor might
be satisfied of his Ability and Honesty: And, according to the Character
given of him, herein <HI>Xunus</HI> so well behav'd himself, that every Body, but
especially <HI>Yaus,</HI> did with admiration reverence him; and finding him every
way extraordinarily qualified, the Emperor soon after took him to his Assi∣stance,
and cast the Care of the whole Government upon his Shoulders: In
which high Estimation and Grandeur he continu'd for the space of twenty
eight Years, that the Noble Prince <HI>Yaus</HI> liv'd.</P>
<P>But at last <HI>Yaus,</HI> being over-laden with Years, and ready to die (in the Year
before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth 2257.) admonish'd <HI>Xunus</HI> upon his Death-bed, to accept
of the Government, in these or the like words: <HI>Draw near to me, and hear these
my last words; I have tokens enough of your Vertue and Honesty, and that your Words and
Deeds are correspondent each to other: Therefore you must accept of the Scepter, which is
due to your Vertues and Services. Take care of the Welfare and Good of your Subjects as a
Father, and remember that you must serve, not enslave the People, and so they will love, and
not fear you; for this reason a King exceeds all his Subjects, because he alone is to take care,
and to watch over all the rest.</HI> Having thus said, he yielded up the Ghost, for whom
<HI>Xunus</HI> Mourned, not as one Friend for another, but as a Son for his Father:
for according to the Custom of the Country, where Sons lament their Parents
Death, he left the Government wholly to his Council, and continu'd three
whole years at the Grave of his Prince, without removing from it.</P>
<P>This Solemnity of Grief being past, and <HI>Xunus</HI> return'd to the Exercise of
his Government, he quickly gave Proofs of his Prudence and Clemency, which
caus'd him to be very much belov'd by his Subjects. It is reported, that in
each Eye he had two Balls or Apples, which was, and still is held by the <HI>Chine∣ses</HI>
for a sign of extraordinary Fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="140"/>
Being now setled, he divided the Inhabitants into several Companies, and
gratifi'd each according to his Worth and Parts with his Offices; he either
made new Laws and Customs, or reform'd the old. The six Benches of Iudi∣cature
erected by his Predecessor <HI>Yaus,</HI> were reduc'd by him into a better Form:
Afterwards he divided the whole Empire into twelve Provinces, which he vi∣sited
yearly in Person, and whatever Learn'd or wise Men he found, them he
cherish'd and preferr'd above all others. He gave in charge to the Governors
and <HI>Mandorins</HI> of Provinces, to promote Agriculture and Tillage above all other
things; that they should accommodate and shew themselves kind to all Stran∣gers
and Travellers; to put into Offices only such as were able, and of known
and approv'd Integrity, and give credit to honest and good People. He de∣vis'd
likewise five sorts of Punishments, according to which Malefactors were
to suffer, as the greatness of the Crime did deserve: which were, 1. Loss
of Life. 2. Cutting off the Nose. 3. A Foot. 4. A Hand. and 5. Pulling out
the Teeth. He introduc'd likewise the Custom of banishing Malefactors, the
chiefest whereof were to be exil'd out of the Limits of that Empire, and to be
forc'd to live and reside amongst Forein People. Another thing yet very ob∣servable
of him, is this, That during his Reign he forbad that any should
obey him meerly for fear of his Authority, because he was Emperor, but ra∣ther
for love of his Goodness, because he order'd that which was Iust and
Right.</P>
<P>During his Government, the <HI>Tartars</HI> (of whom never any mention was
made before in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Histories) broke into <HI>China,</HI> plundering, and making
Inroads into most of the Provinces: But the good Prince, who only car'd for
the Welfare of his Subjects, having rais'd a great Army, march'd against them
with it, and by main force subduing the Enemy, setled his Empire again in
Peace and Quietness. But since that time, which is many Ages since, the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
never left molesting and disturbing the said Countries, till now at last in
our Days they have made themselves Masters of the whole, as I shall mention
hereafter.</P>
<P>At the time of this Invasion, as <HI>Fluctus fluctum sequitur,</HI> one Evil seldom goes
alone, the Emperor was full of trouble, by what means to repel the high Wa∣ters
which threatned to overflow the lower parts of the Country. After many
Experiments, he gave order at last to one <HI>Quenius,</HI> to cast up a Bank against the
same; but he not being able to perform it, and leaving the same imperfect, the
Charge of the Work was committed to his Son <HI>Yvus,</HI> who in the space of thir∣teen
years effected it, to the great accommodation of the Inhabitants, follow∣ing
his Design all that while with such earnestness, that he would hardly eat
or sleep. Some part of this great and stupendious Work may be seen to this
day, as the Royal Channels, in which great Vessels pass and Sail from one
Place to another: For the making whereof the Workmen were compell'd to
dig through Rocks in some places, and to divide or cut great Rivers into two
or three, and make Inlets for them into the Sea: by which Industry great store
of Ground was drain'd, and recover'd from the Water under which it had lain
immerged <HI>ultra memoriam.</HI> This great Labor, Diligence, and Dexterity of <HI>Yvus,</HI>
us'd in the accomplishing this stupendious Work, so far prevail'd upon the Af∣fection
of the Emperor, that he made him his Fellow and Companion in the
Government, passing by his own Son; so that they two, without any ambiti∣ous
Emulation or Envy to each other (which is a very strange thing) Govern'd
seventeen years with equal Power and Authority. At the end of which time
<PB N="249" REF="140"/>
<HI>Xunus</HI> hapning to die, and his eldest Son, taking it ill thas <HI>Yvus</HI> should be pre∣ferr'd
before him, in regard he took it for granted, that the Scepter did by he∣reditary
Right belong unto him, he endeavor'd to seat himself in the Imperial
Throne by force of Arms: But what Stratagems, Policy, or Force soever he
us'd, all prov'd vain; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or he could not prevail, the generality of the People
adhering cordially to <HI>Yvus,</HI> in regard they judg'd him most deserving of the
Crown; which accordingly was setled upon him, though not without some
trouble.</P>
<P>This <HI>Yvus</HI> was the Founder of the first <HI>Chinese</HI> Imperial Race, which he caus'd
to be styl'd <HI>Hiaa,</HI> and the last of the elected Emperors: for when the Royal
Chair after his Death became void, his Son was unanimously admitted to suc∣ceed
him, and from that time the manner and custom of Election was chang'd
into an hereditary Succession from Father to Son.</P>
<P>This Royal Race or Family, which had its beginning in the before-menti∣oned
<HI>Yvus</HI> (in the Year 2207 before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth) sway'd the Imperial Scepter
four hundred forty one years in a continu'd Line of seventeen Emperors, who
succeeded each other in the Government of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>This Race being extinct for want of Issue, arose the Family of <HI>Xanga,</HI>
whereof the Emperor <HI>Tangus,</HI> in the Year 1766 before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, was the
first who call'd it <HI>Xanga,</HI> from a Lordship of the same Name he possessed.
This Family produc'd twenty eight Emperors, who sat upon the Throne suc∣cessively
for six hundred years and upwards, to the Year 1122 before the Birth
of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>This Line being extinct in the before-mention'd Year, there arose a third
call'd <HI>Cheva,</HI> whose Founder was one <HI>Faus,</HI> who at the beginning of his Reign,
changing his Name, call'd himself <HI>Uvus,</HI> that is, <HI>A Warriour.</HI> Thirty seven Em∣perors
proceeded out of this Family, and all successively sway'd the Scepter:
which ending the Year 246 before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, the fourth Race call'd <HI>Ciua</HI>
stood up, whose Founder was nam'd <HI>Chingus;</HI> but altering his Name, was
call'd <HI>Xius.</HI> This Race, which gave its Name to the whole Empire (as I have
already related) was yet but of short continuance, there having sprung but
three Emperors from thence, who Reigned forty years, and extinguishing
about the Year 206 before the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> the fifth Race, call'd <HI>Hana,</HI> got
into the Throne: the Founder whereof was one <HI>Leupangus,</HI> whose Successor
in a direct Line held the Sovereignty of the Empire of <HI>China</HI> till the Year 264
after <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth. This Family being brought under, the sixth Race, call'd
<HI>Cyna,</HI> stept into the Throne, and Govern'd till the Year of our Lord 419.
within which compass of Time there were no less than five Kings at once,
who were all call'd <HI>Utai,</HI> and wag'd very cruel Wars one against another for
above four hundred years. At last having miserably worried and weakned
each other, they were all subdu'd by the seventh Race call'd <HI>Tanga,</HI> which
seized upon the whole Empire, and Reigned with his Posterity till the Year
of <HI>Christ</HI> 618.</P>
<P>No sooner was this Race of <HI>Tanga</HI> at an end, but the eighth, call'd <HI>Sunga,</HI>
succeeded, in which the Government continu'd till the Year of our Lord 1278.
when the <HI>Tartars,</HI> after a long and tedious destructive War with this Family
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unga</HI> for seventy three years, conquer'd the whole Empire, extirpating the
whole Family, and set up a new one call'd <HI>Ivena,</HI> which Reigned over the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI>
till the Year 1368. But in the same Year appear'd a Priest call'd <HI>Chu,</HI>
who with the assistance of his Country-men expell'd the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and setled
<PB N="250" REF="141"/>
himself in the Throne, assuming the Name and Style of <HI>Hunguvus,</HI> which sig∣nifies
<HI>The Warlike Soldier;</HI> from whom sprung the Race of <HI>Taicinga,</HI> which held
the Crown two hundred and eighty years, but at last was brought under, and
wholly rooted out in the Year 1644 by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who once more conquer'd
and over-ran the whole Empire, and erected a new Generation of Royal
Blood call'd <HI>Taicinga,</HI> under its first Founder <HI>Xunchius,</HI> who was born <HI>Great
Cham of Tartary.</HI> And thus having led you as it were by the Hand to the <HI>Tartar</HI>
Government, it will not be amiss to shew you, as briefly as the Subject will
bear, as well the cause as the manner of that terrible Devastation, which not
only extirpated the same Family, but brought the whole Country to the slavish
Subjection of their unciviliz'd Barbarism.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars,</HI> who for Antiquity go beyond all other People in <HI>Asia,</HI> and
from whom many and several Nations are sprung, did in the Year 2158 be∣fore
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, make very bloody Wars against the <HI>Chineses,</HI> wherein they
were sometimes Conquerors possessing the Land, and at other times conquer'd
and driven out again. Now it is to be observ'd, That under the Name of <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
I understand here, those People that have their Habitations on the North
side of that most renowned and famous Wall, in former times built against the
Invasions of those <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and reaching from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West</HI> three hundred
Dutch Miles in length.</P>
<P>For what cause or reason these People have born for so many Ages so much
Malice and Hatred to one another (as appears by the bloody Wars they have
made)
the <HI>Chinese</HI> Histories make no mention: But others who would seem
to be curious, and understanding Inspectors therein, ascribe it to the difference
of Customs and Manners of these two Nations; for as parity of Manners is a
conceal'd beginning and introduction of Friendship; so on the other Hand, a
difference therein is the original and true occasion of Enmity. Now how
much the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> differ in their Customs and Manners, will easily
be made appear by the daily Employments and Actions each of them affects
from the Cradle. The <HI>Chinese</HI> is of an affable and peaceable Disposition, ad∣dicted
to Husbandry, and loving all good Arts and Sciences: But the <HI>Tartar,</HI>
on the other Hand, delights in nothing so much as Hunting, being very cun∣ning
and deceitful, lusting after War, and of a very loose and uncivil Com∣portment.
It is true, both endeavor to shun Idleness, but with Intentions very
incoherent; the one to live temperately and honestly; but the other only to
range abroad in a wild and beastial Barbarism.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, but that the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> have wag'd War one
against another for many Ages; yet I dare be bold to say, we read of none
so terrible as those in this our Age: for thereby the <HI>Tartars</HI> have not only made
themselves Masters of all the said Empire, but extirpated the last Royal Line,
that there is not any <HI>Vestigium</HI> or Trace left of them in being. In short, that
the occasion of this last War may be the more fully and clearly understood,
I shall relate unto you the two first Conquests of <HI>China,</HI> by way of <HI>Proemium.</HI></P>
<P>You must first then take notice, That the People of <HI>West-Tartary,</HI> after they
had brought under their Power almost all <HI>Asia,</HI> which is the fruitfullest part of
the inhabited World, fell upon the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> about the Year 1206 be∣fore
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth; which was continu'd (as is before hinted) for above seventy
three years with so great animosity, that at last in the Year 1278. the whole
Empire was subdu'd by them. The <HI>Tartars</HI> after this so total a Conquest, set∣led
a new Linage of their own Country in the Throne, call'd <HI>Ivena,</HI> whose
<PB N="251" REF="141"/>
Offspring for nine Generations brought forth successive Emperors, who Go∣vern'd
the Empire peaceably one after another.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> having thus long peaceably enjoy'd the whole, grew at last to
degenerate through the Pleasures and Plenty which they found there; so that
by degrees they forgot themselves, and <HI>pedetentim</HI> Inch by Inch as it were, inu∣red
themselves to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Customs and Manners, neglecting their Places of
Strength and Forces, till at last, in stead of warlike Soldiers, they were grown
effeminate <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>And though these <HI>Tartar</HI> Princes did Govern with great Care and Prudence,
yet the <HI>Chineses</HI> could not forget the great and horrible Slaughters of their An∣cestors,
whose bleeding Carcases lying as it were before their Eyes, excited
them to Revenge; and being likewise inwardly stimulated with a desire of
Liberty, they had now already gotten the same in their thoughts, which was
yet far off, and with great hazards to be sought: for although the People were
every where ready to revolt, and shake off the <HI>Tartar</HI> Yoke, yet there was not
one of the Grandees or Men of Eminency durst lead the Dance or break the
Ice. But what Providence ordains to be done, shall never want Means to be
effected, as will plainly appear by the sequel; for while the Great Ones durst
not, and the Commons with a Leader could not do ought, at last a poor despi∣cable
Fellow appear'd, whose Name was <HI>Chu,</HI> and the Servant of a Priest:
<HI>This Chu,</HI> who took compassion of the miserable State of his oppressed Coun∣try-men,
and a displeasure in his own despicable Fortune, being of a high,
lofty, and ambitious Spirit, left his Cloister and Cell, in which he had liv'd
for some years, upon a high Mountain, and betook himself to a secular Life
amongst Robbers and Highway-men, among whom in a short time he became
the vilest and most wicked, not fearing to act what some Spirits would trem∣ble
at the thoughts of; so that for his great courage and boldness, they began
to look upon him as the Person that should deliver their oppressed Country.
This Imagination of his Associates elevating his Valou, and being withal of
a fluent and voluble Tongue, very quick of Apprehension, and of great Un∣derstanding,
he never fail'd of Courage, Conduct, nor Success; so that in a
short time he grew so considerable in Power and Credit amongst the Rabble,
that chusing him their Leader, he was able to bring some thousands into the
Field. Being gotten thus into a Posture, not only to defend himself, but to of∣fend
his Enemy, he resolv'd to shew himself in the Field for the deliverance of
his Country from the <HI>Tartar</HI> Vassalage under which they groan'd, and there∣upon
began to forsake his Holes and Fastnesses upon the Mountains, and to ap∣pear
with his Army upon the Plain; the Fame whereof once noised, made
his Forces increase daily in number, among whom, with his good Conduct
and Courage, he so prevail'd, that he won their Hearts, so that they thought no∣thing
too much to do for him: And to shew as well his Providence as Valour,
he caus'd the Hills and Mountains to be plough'd and manur'd, to keep him∣self
and his Army from starving, in case he should be overpower'd by his
Enemy, and forc'd to retreat thither again.</P>
<P><HI>Chu</HI> at last, encourag'd by these fortunate beginnings, draws his Army to∣gether,
makes towards the Enemy, and fights them, who not expecting such
an Onset, were soon beaten, and afterwards overcome in several Fights, in
which he was still victorious; yet notwithstanding the Soldiers fury, and
rage of War, he still spar'd the native <HI>Chineses,</HI> promising to restore them to
their ancient Privileges and Liberties, if they would forsake the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and
<PB N="252" REF="142"/>
adhere to <HI>Hun:</HI> by these Means, and his continual Spies which he had every
where to give him Intelligence, he discover'd the Designs of the Destroyers of
his Country, whom he so closely pursu'd, that they were at last forc'd to quit
the Country, and leave it to the ancient Inhabitants: which Redemption was
effected in the Year 1368.</P>
<P>When now <HI>Chu,</HI> from a mean Servant, had thus rais'd himself, by driving
those insulting <HI>Tartars</HI> out of the Empire, he erected in that Year a new Race,
which he call'd <HI>Taicinga,</HI> and changing his own Name according to Custom,
he call'd himself <HI>Hunguvus,</HI> that is, <HI>A great Warriour.</HI></P>
<P>He was no sooner setled in the Throne, but the People out of all the Provin∣ces
came to acknowledge and Salute this their Deliverer; the whole Coun∣try
being overjoy'd, that they had once again got one of their own Natives,
though of mean Extraction, to be their Head and Governor, (for it is the na∣tural
temper of that People, to hate and vilifie all Foreigners, but highly to
esteem of their own Country-men) humbly requesting of him, that he would
take care as a Native of <HI>China,</HI> with such Prudence to Govern and Protect the
<HI>Chinese</HI> Throne, that they might not be necessitated hereafter to call in a Foreiner.</P>
<P><HI>Hunguvus</HI> thank'd them for their Affections, and taking into his own Hands
the whole Soveraignty, seated himself in the Imperial City of <HI>Nanking,</HI> where
he behav'd himself with so much Honor, that in a short time he so setled the
Affairs of his Empire, that the People liv'd under him in great security and
freedom. But this Settlement he knew would not long continue, unless he
provided to secure all from abroad; therefore to prevent future trouble from
his now vanquish'd Foe, and that the <HI>Tartars</HI> whom he had thus driven out,
might not rally and make Head again, he follow'd his Advantages and Con∣quests,
and with a considerable Army entring <HI>Tartary,</HI> overcame them in se∣veral
Battels, and so ruin'd their Country with Fire and Sword, that they
were forc'd to lay down their Arms, with a Promise to pay him Tribute.
These were those <HI>Tartars,</HI> who after the Overthrows given them, as before
related, fled into the Country of <HI>Ninche:</HI> And indeed after those of <HI>Ninche</HI> had
made their Peace with the Emperor, they brought yearly their Presents unto
him, as his Subjects and Friends, and were permitted to Trade in his Domini∣ons
as his Vassals; and since that time have never had any thoughts of War,
but rather were fearful to give any Offence, left they should draw thereby any
ill will upon themselves, and so fall into new Troubles: for in the last Wars,
they were reduc'd into most miserable Extremities. And thus we see the Vi∣cissitudes
of Fortune, and uncertain Events of War, in those <HI>Tartars</HI> who were
not long since Masters of <HI>China,</HI> but now are become Vassals and Subjects to
that Empire, to whose Prince they seek for Friendship and Protection.</P>
<P>In this Posture stood the Affairs of these Countries for a long space of time,
till these People of <HI>Ninche</HI> increased so very fast in Power and Multitude, that
they concluded to form themselves into a distinct Commonwealth, and to
send some of their People as Colonies to inhabit other Parts. Thus at last
they divided the whole District of <HI>Ninche</HI> into seven Principalities or Govern∣ments,
who for a while agreed among themselves, without any grand Distur∣bance,
or pretence of Warring with each other; but at length upon some oc∣casion
Quarrels arose, which broke forth into a long War, wherein the Victors
assuming to themselves absolute Principality, turn'd their Commonwealth in
the Year 1600 after <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, into a Monarchy, and call'd it <HI>The Kingdom
of Ninche.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="142"/>
This <HI>Ninche</HI> (which is properly <HI>East-Tartary,</HI> and as yet very little known to
those of <HI>Europe)</HI> is bounded on the North and North-East with another <HI>Tartar</HI>
Kingdom call'd <HI>Niulhan;</HI> towards the East lies the Kingdom of <HI>Yupi,</HI> likewise
under the <HI>Tartar</HI> Yoke, and surrounded with the Sea, between <HI>Iapan</HI> and <HI>East-Tartary:</HI>
on the South it borders upon the Island <HI>Corea,</HI> and by the <HI>Great Wall</HI> it
is divided from the Province of <HI>Laotung;</HI> but more towards the West separa∣ted
by the great River <HI>Linhoang,</HI> flowing between this Kingdom of <HI>Ninche</HI> and
<HI>Kilangho.</HI> The antiquiety of this People appears in the mention made of them
in the Race of <HI>Hana,</HI> which began in the Year 206 before <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth: They
are known to the <HI>Chineses</HI> and Neighbors by the Name of <HI>Kin,</HI> which signifies
<HI>Gold,</HI> and commonly are call'd <HI>The Lords and Masters of the Golden Mountains,</HI> it
being a common opinion, That <HI>China</HI> is full of Gold-Mines, which we will
not dispute, but dare knowingly affirm, That it has Rivers, upon the sides
whereof great store of Gold is taken up daily.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> of several Parts have at divers times War∣red
on <HI>China;</HI> but the People of <HI>Ninche</HI> above all have always been their great∣est
Enemies, having during the Reign of the Race of <HI>Sunga</HI> given so great
Overthrows to their Forces, and made such Depredations upon their Land,
that they were forc'd to flie out of the Northern Provinces into the Southern,
the <HI>Ninchians</HI> having subdu'd and brought under their Subjection the Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Laotung, Peking, Xensi, Xensi,</HI> and <HI>Xantung;</HI> and without all doubt,
at that time would have conquer'd the whole Empire, if the neighboring <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
of the Kingdom of <HI>Samarcand,</HI> who envied their great Success, after the
Conquest of a great part of <HI>Asia,</HI> had not through the Western and Southern
Provinces fall'n into the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and put a stop to their Victories by
their irresistible Armies; which was the occasion of a cruel and bloody War
between them. These <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Samarcand</HI> drove those of <HI>Ninche</HI> not only out
of <HI>China,</HI> but pursu'd them into <HI>East-Tartary,</HI> their own Country, whereof they
took a considerable part from them: And since that time the <HI>Samarcandians,</HI>
who possess'd the Northern Provinces, out of which they had beaten the
<HI>Nincheans,</HI> have made many and sharp Wars against the Emperors of the Sou∣thern
<HI>China,</HI> and at last subdu'd the whole, and erected a new Race call'd <HI>Ivena,</HI>
as is before said, which continu'd till it was brought under by the same <HI>Hun∣guvus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> out of a natural Emnity to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> say in derision of them,
That they live in Holes and Caves under Ground: which is not so; for they
keep in very strong and well-wrought Tents, which they use in stead of Hou∣ses,
being for the most part made of Silk or Stuff, and so curiously Painted, that
they shine in the Sun like Looking-glasses, and keep out the Rain, so that none
drops through. Of these Persons of Quality have several, which yet are so
contriv'd, that they seem but one: In some parts of which the Wife and Chil∣dren
remain, in others the Servants; and some are for necessary uses, as Kit∣chins,
and the like.</P>
<P>They relate, That during the Reign of the Race of <HI>Ivena,</HI> there were a hun∣dred
and twenty four Cities in this <HI>East-Tartary;</HI> but whether there are so ma∣ny
now I cannot affirm, in regard the <HI>Tartars</HI> themselves in <HI>China</HI> were not
able to inform me. All their Towns and Places are in a manner movable
(which the <HI>Latines</HI> call <HI>Horda)</HI> with which, and the Cattel and Families, they
remove from place to place, changing according to the Season of the Year, and
pitching where the best Accommodation is to be had.</P>

<P>The Clothes of the poorer sort are made of Skins, but the richer go clad in
Silk and Cotton, though there grows neither in the Province of <HI>Ninche;</HI> but
such among them as Trade, come and buy it of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> or exchange other
Commodities for it, as Skins of Wolves, Foxes, Beavers, Otters, Sables, and the
like. The Men wear long Coats down to their Heels, with narrow Sleeves;
and about their Middle is a broad Girdle, with a Cloth fastned to it, where∣with
they wipe their Faces. At their sides hangeth a Knife, and two little Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ses,
wherein they put Tobacco, which is taken by them with great delight, in∣somuch
that the noblest Visitants are Treated with the same, it being brought
them lighted by a Servant of the House. On the left side they wear a Hanger
or Zable, with the Edge turn'd forward, and the Hilt behind, insomuch that
when they are on Horseback, they can draw their Zables with great dexterity,
by laying the right Hand behind over their Backs upon the Hilt, without
holding fast, or so much as touching the Scabbard. In the Summer-time, for
coolness, they wear Hats of Straw; but in Winter, Caps which come down
over their Ears, with an Edging of Fur about it.</P>
<P>The Soldiers wear commonly Iron Helmets upon their Heads, differing
very little in fashion from such as are us'd in <HI>Europe,</HI> only they have no Fence
for the Face. In stead of Feathers they wear either a Horses Mayn or Tail dy'd
red. Their other defensive Arms are Iron Breast-pieces, not made of one Piece,
but of several Plates fastned together with Nails, so that they make a hideous
noise when they are upon their March, but especially the Horse. Their offen∣sive
Arms are a Bows Arrows, and Hanger; for Guns or Muskets are not in
use amongst them. The Horse-men are generally clad in Black, to make them
look terrible, having Boots on made of Horse-leather, with thick Soles, but no
Spurs.</P>
<P>There are among them very few Foot-Soldiers; for being generally good
Horse-men, they turn all their Forces into Cavalry, who when they march,
observe this Order: First two Horse-men, with Colours upon their Backs.
Next to these follow two other Horse-men with Colours. Then comes the
Commander in Chief over the Cavalry. After him five others, the middlemost
whereof carries the Emperor's Standard. Then march all the rest of the Troop
in order, five a breast.</P>

<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> have a high estimation of the <HI>Tartars</HI> for strength, because there∣in
they exceed them, although they fall far short in the same to those of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>
They are whitish of Complexion, not talkative, but silent, and well
compos'd, bred up to Arms from their Cradles, which makes them such ex∣cellent
Soldiers: But at shooting with the Bow at a Mark, they are so extra∣ordinarily
dexterous, that no People in the World are to be compar'd with
them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar</HI> Women are generally Cloth'd in black Garments, which hang
loose about them; but Persons of Quality wear generally Silk, whereas the
ordinary sort are content with Cotton. Their Hair is neatly plaited and turn'd
up, only a few Locks hang down: And those of the better sort wear upon
their Heads, Hats curiously wrought.</P>
<P>These <HI>Tartars</HI> eat whatsoever they can get, but chiefly Flesh, and that half
roasted or boil'd, being not curious of what sort it is, whether of Camels,
Horses, or other Creatures. They take great delight in Hunting, and have
very swift Hounds for the Game. But when all is said that almost can be, we
must add, That they are in effect a Nation of Plunderers and Robbers, being
naturally inclin'd to those Vices. And no wonder, for they live generally
without the Profession of any Religion: But especially they have a great ab∣horrency
to the Religion of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and possibly therefore hate the <HI>Turks</HI> as
the Factors of that Religion; but a more probable reason may be, because the
said <HI>Hunguvus,</HI> Founder of the Race of <HI>Taicinga,</HI> expell'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> out of <HI>China</HI>
by the assistance of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>They burn the dead Bodies, after the manner of the <HI>Indians,</HI> upon very high
Heaps of Wood: on which Funeral Pile are also laid the Women, Servants,
Horses, and Arms of the Deceased. Notwithstanding all which Heathenish
blindness, they are however very careful and sollicitous about the state of their
Souls, as whether they are to expect after this Life another, or whether they do
not presently die with the Body; by reason of which many of them are very
ready to embrace <HI>Christianity,</HI> and divers of them after the Conquest of <HI>China,</HI>
were converted to the <HI>Catholick</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>As to their Language which they speak in the Kingdom of <HI>Ninche,</HI> it is not
so difficult to learn as that of <HI>China,</HI> but more resembles the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue:
<PB N="256" REF="144"/>
Some of their Letters, both for fashion and pronunciation, are like the <HI>Arabick,</HI>
which in all are above sixty in number, and do not much differ in the pro∣nunciation
and spelling from those in <HI>Europe,</HI> but very much in the form and
make. In Reading and Writing they proceed from the top to the bottom, af∣ter
the manner of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and not from the left to the right side, as we do
in <HI>Europe;</HI> nor from the right to the left, as do the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Hebrews.</HI></P>
<P>In this Kingdom of <HI>Ninche</HI> are found excellent Rubies and costly Pearls, be∣sides
other Precious Stones: Also very large Cattel, especially Cows, which
exceed those in <HI>Europe</HI> for bigness, but have no Horns.</P>
<P>The Western part of this Country is very full of Rocks and Hills, between
which lies most fertile and pleasant Valleys, and fruitful Fields. The biggest
Mountain of all is call'd <HI>Kin,</HI> which signifies <HI>Gold.</HI></P>
<P>There is also the Mountain <HI>Changpe,</HI> which reaches a thousand Miles, and in
the middle of which is a Sea-like Mere at least eighty Miles long, from whence
two Rivers take their rise, the one call'd <HI>Yalo,</HI> running to the South, and the
other <HI>Guenthung,</HI> taking its course to the North.</P>
<P>And thus much shall suffice for the Description of <HI>East-Tartary,</HI> or the King∣dom
of <HI>Ninche,</HI> whose Inhabitants, in manner afore-mention'd, the <HI>Chinese</HI> Em∣peror
kept in awe: But on the contrary, to the <HI>West-Tartars,</HI> which possess the
Kingdom of <HI>Tanyn,</HI> the same Emperors sent Presents and Tribute yearly, that
they should not make War upon them; for they hold it no Scandal to pre∣vent
a War by that means; nay, they hold it altogether unlawful to enter
into a War, so long as the Country can be kept from Invasions by any other
means.</P>
<P>But yet although the <HI>Chineses</HI> on the one Hand kept under their Enemies by
force of Arms, and on the other bought a Peace with Presents and Tribute,
yet they liv'd in continual Fears and Mistrust, insomuch that they always kept
the <HI>Great Wall</HI> which divides <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Tartary</HI> strongly guarded with at least a
Million of Men.</P>
<P>But to return from whence we have digressed: The Throne of <HI>China</HI> be∣ing
setled in the Race of <HI>Taiminga,</HI> was by the same enjoy'd in peace and qui∣etness
two hundred and fifty years, when <HI>Vanticus</HI> the thirteenth Emperor, a
just, prudent, and upright Prince, came to Reign, which was in the Year 1573
after <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth: But herein he was unfortunate, that he (as most Princes
secur'd by long Peace) trusted too much to his Governors and <HI>Mandorins,</HI> and
suffer'd the whole weight of his Affairs to lie upon their Shoulders.</P>
<P>During this time the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Ninche,</HI> as is before-mention'd, being form'd
from a Popular Government into a Monarchy in the Year 1600. their first
King was a Man of so great Courage and Magnanimity, that all their Neigh∣bors,
and especially the <HI>Chineses,</HI> began to be afraid of him; for he manag'd
the Affairs of his State after such a politick and prudent manner, that in a
short time his Subjects became not only very numerous, but formidable for
Strength to all their Borderers; and being sensible of their own Greatness,
and that their Fame began to grow terrible, they began to call to mind the an∣cient
Glory of their Conquests, and to consider how shamefully they had been
heretofore driven out of the possession of the honorable Acquisitions of their
Ancestors; and observing likewise the great Miscarriages and Neglects of the
<HI>Chineses</HI> in the management of the Government, they resolv'd upon some sud∣den
and great Undertaking against them: therefore weighing with themselves
the Yoke of Servitude they lay under, as a fit occasion of Quarrel, they began
<PB N="257" REF="144"/>
first of all to shake off the same, and to refuse to pay Tribute, and shortly after
to appear in their true Colours, by publickly opposing the Authority that was
over them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Governors (whereof the most in <HI>Leaotung,</HI> the Province border∣ing
nearest to the Kingdom of <HI>Ninche,</HI> are Military Commanders) hearing of
this, concluded very unadvisedly to misuse the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the most cruel man∣ner,
thereby the more to incite them to War, so hazarding their Countries
Weal for their private hoped for Lucre; for by the War they thought to have
a fairer opportunity to enrich themselves, as well upon the <HI>Tartars</HI> as <HI>Chineses.</HI>
These indeed might be, and questionless were great Motives to the War:
But the chiefest Reason of all, was the base Murder committed by them upon
the King of <HI>Ninche;</HI> for they looking upon him with an envious Eye, seeing
him increase his Kingdom so very much in Power and Strength (which they
fancied would be at one time or other employ'd against them) consulted and
conspir'd to make him away, which they contriv'd, and in a most barbarous
manner they thus effected: They came one day, upon pretence of a Visit, to
the King with a feigned Affection, who not having the least suspicion of their
wicked Design, they easily surpris'd him, took him Prisoner, and put him to
death: but the better to gloze over the Villany, gave out that he died sud∣denly
of an Apoplexy.</P>
<P>This done so closely, as they suppos'd, they presently imagin'd they had
Weather'd the Point, and overcome all Difficulties: but they were not a little
disappointed in their expectations; for his Son, who, like his Father, was of a
Princely and Warlike Spirit, being substituted in his Place, as soon as setled in
the Throne, and at Peace with his Neighbors, rais'd a great Army, with an
intention to Invade <HI>China</HI> in revenge of his Father's Death. The chiefest Gran∣dees
and Councellors of his Kingdom encourag'd him in this Design: where∣upon
in the Year 1616 he came with a very great Army to the <HI>Great Wall</HI> of
Partition between <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> with hopes to pass there, which succeeded
according to his desire: for after a sharp Skirmish, the <HI>Chineses</HI> betook them∣selves
to flight, leaving to the young King a free Passage into <HI>China</HI> with his
victorious Army, with which he first fell into the Province of <HI>Leaotunga,</HI> and
made himself Master of the City <HI>Tuxung</HI> or <HI>Cayven,</HI> which lies near <HI>Tartary,</HI> and
the River <HI>Yalous</HI> (the place where the <HI>Great Wall</HI> begins;) and here he Planted
himself to carry on the War: And this he undoubtedly did to this end, that
he might be able to save himself by flight by Sea, in case the <HI>Chineses</HI> should
have fall'n upon him and blockt him up, and so have endeavor'd to have cut
off his Passage from getting back again; but if he were able to make good,
and stand his Ground, then he foresaw it lay coveniently for him to receive
Succors out of his own Country, and from others his Allies, whereby with
continual Reinforcings he should be the better enabled to over-run that Em∣pire,
which he had already conquer'd in his Eye.</P>
<P>Thus we see the King of <HI>Ninche</HI> safely got with his Army into his Enemie's
Country, where having pitch'd and fortifi'd himself, as afore-mention'd, he
began to consult with himself of his Undertaking; when considering what
a small Force he had to conquer so powerful an Empire, and that on the other
hand he might be easily set upon by the Forces which lay in the Cities of the
Provinces of <HI>Leaotung</HI> and <HI>Peking,</HI> and destroy'd before he could be well se∣cur'd;
he thought it best to add the Foxes Tail to the Lions Skin, and so re∣sov'd
to send a civil Letter to the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> to complain of the wret∣ched
<PB N="258" REF="145"/>
and inhumane Murther committed upon his Father, to lay open the de∣ceitful
Carriages of his Governors in many Particulars, but chiefly in the mis∣usage
of his Subjects in their Trade and Commerce, and the like. He like∣wise
desir'd, that the Emperor would not harbor a hard Opinion, but pass a
just Censure upon his Actions and Undertaking, and cause condign punish∣ment
to be inflicted upon his Governors. Last of all he desir'd, That the Em∣peror
would quit him the yearly Taxes which he paid, to defray the Charges
of this War: And upon performance of these things, he promis'd to quit the
City he had taken, and to retreat with his Army beyond the <HI>Wall,</HI> and that the
Inhabitants of <HI>China</HI> should be receiv'd and treated in <HI>Ninche</HI> as Friends and
Allies.</P>
<P>For the Bearer of this Letter the King of <HI>Ninche</HI> (to make it the more accep∣table
and effectual) chose a certain Priest, whom the <HI>Tartars</HI> call <HI>Lama,</HI> with
Command to deliver the same in a most submissive manner, and seriously to
lay before the Emperor and his Council the great quantity of Blood that was
like to be spilt, if not timely prevented by a friendly Accommodation between
them.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Vanlieus,</HI> to whom the King of <HI>Ninche</HI> sent this civil Letter,
though in other things he was a wise and prudent Prince, yet in this Business
(whether through his great Age he began to dote, or that the greatness of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Power and State had stupifi'd his Brain) shew'd not his wonted Prudence and
Conduct: for as he could not but very well understand by the Contents of
the Letter, that the Complaints of the King of <HI>Ninche</HI> were grounded upon
weighty Reasons, and not without great Cause, yet he took the Business so lit∣tle
to heart, and judg'd it of so small consequence, as not worthy to be Deba∣ted
in his Presence, and so referr'd it to the Consideration of some of the Coun∣cil,
or rather truly to some of his Governors and Commanders, who had la∣bor'd
all they could at Court, that it might be transmitted to them, that so they
might shew their Pride in not answering the Letter of a <HI>Tartar</HI> King; for to
that heighth was their insufferable arrogance grown, that they thought it an
undervaluing to their Honor and Grandeur, to return any Answer unto it;
but in stead thereof signifi'd their high Displeasure, that People subject unto
them, and who paid Taxes yearly to the Emperor, sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld take upon them to
come and complain of Injuries unto him. Nor ceased they here, but mocked
and revil'd the King of <HI>Ninche</HI> with bitter words, never considering that great
Army wherewith he had invaded their Empire, or so much as gathering any
Forces together to oppose him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar</HI> King finding himself thus slighted and scorn'd, changing his
anger into madness, burst out into cursing and swearing, that he would re∣venge
the Murder of his Father with the death of two hundred thousand <HI>Chine∣ses:</HI>
for (as we said before) it is a Custom amongst the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that when any
Persons of Quality die, in honor of the Dead they fling into the Funeral Fire
where the Deceased was burnt, some Men-Servants, Women, Horses, Bows
and Arrows, as if the Dead stood in need of these things hereafter; and here
the Vow of the King signifi'd, that so many thousands should attend his Fa∣ther's
Funeral. But they have very much left this barbarous cruelty since their
Conquest of <HI>China,</HI> insomuch that they now there bury their Dead after the
<HI>Chinese</HI> fashion, without burning, though in their own Country perhaps they
observe still the same Ceremony.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Ninche</HI> being thus incensed, marches forward with his Forces
<PB N="259" REF="145"/>
immediately, and suddenly laid Siege to the Chief City <HI>Laoyang,</HI> in the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Leaotung:</HI> The Place was strongly fortifi'd, and there was a Garrison
of Soldiers within it, all well Arm'd with Muskets, whereas the <HI>Tartars</HI> use
nothing but Zables, Bows, and Arrows: for prevention therefore of the
slaughter by Bullets, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> were very fearful of (for this sort of
Arms was then altogether unknown to them) they invented a Stratagem,
which might render the shooting of Bullets ineffectual unto the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which
was this: Their King caus'd a great number of thick Planks to be made rea∣dy,
and caus'd each Foot-Soldier that march'd in the Van to carry one, where∣with
he secur'd both himself and the Horse that follow'd behind. Being thus
provided, having lain a while before the City, whose Inhabitants were unwil∣ling
to yield, it was concluded to Storm the Place: To this end the King divi∣ded
his Forces into four Divisions, to Storm the City in four places at once:
He commanded the Foot to march with their before-mention'd Planks in the
Front, next to them the worst Horse, after whom follow'd those that carried
the Scaling-Ladders: At last march'd up the Prime of his Army, which con∣sisted
of the Stoutest and ablest Soldiers of his Kingdom.</P>
<P>Having thus put his Army in Battel-array, he fell upon the City immedi∣ately
with an undaunted Courage. Those within made very stout oppositi∣on
at first; but the <HI>Tartars</HI> pressing upon them furiously, got the better, and
at last drove them from the Walls, to which fixing their Scaling-ladders, they
quickly became Masters of the same, such was their ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raordinary nimble∣ness
and Courage. And now the <HI>Chineses,</HI> finding themselves unable any
longer to oppose the Enemy, fled out of the City; but the <HI>Tartars</HI> kill'd a
great number in the Pursuit.</P>
<P>After the taking of this City, the <HI>Tartar</HI> march'd on with his Army without
any stop or hinderance, taking by Storm whatever other Cities oppos'd him;
but such as submitted, he commanded that none of the Inhabitants should
suffer either in Body or Goods.</P>
<P>When now the King of <HI>Ninche</HI> had fill'd the Inhabitants of the Province
of <HI>Leaotung</HI> with fear and dread of his Army, and had totally Conquer'd the
same, he march'd forward with the Flower of his Army into the Province of
<HI>Peking,</HI> making no haste till he was come within seven Miles of the Imperial
City, and there finding several <HI>Chinese</HI> Armies to lie round about him, he
pitch'd his Camp in a very rich Quarter, not daring to advance any further up
into the Country; whereas if he had march'd on, he had in all probability
carried all before him, and might undoubtedly have taken the Imperial City,
the People being generall consternated, and their Hearts dead with Fear, inso∣much
that the Emperor himself had already concluded to abandon the City
of <HI>Peking,</HI> and with his whole Family to retire toward the Southern Provin∣ces;
but he was dissuaded from it by his Council: yet notwithstanding, the
Inhabitants of both these Provinces were so fill'd with Fear at the approach
of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that they left their Habitations both in City and Country, and
fled into the Woods and Mountains with what they could well carry with
them; the Enemy in the mean time laying waste several famous Cities, and
putting all to Fire and Sword where he came.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ninchean</HI> King, who, as we said, durst not adventure to march against
the Imperial City of <HI>Peking,</HI> having got good store of Riches out of the other
Conquer'd Cities, retreated back with his Army to the Chief City of the
Province of <HI>Leaotung,</HI> which was a very goodly City before he took it, both
<PB N="260" REF="146"/>
for strength, situation, and fairness of Building: but being told by his Sooth∣sayers,
that to let the old Walls stand after he had won the Place, could bode
nought but Misfortune, he caus'd them thereupon to be raz'd to the Ground,
and new ones built.</P>
<P>There are but two Great Cities in all this Province, which are <HI>Leaoyang</HI> and
<HI>Ningyven;</HI> the rest are of a smaller Circuit, yet are they both Populous and
Rich: But with Places of Strength, which exceed some Cities for bigness, it
exceedingly abounds.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Place are very dull of Understanding, and so al∣together
incapable of learning any Arts and Sciences; but very healthful of
Constitution, and strong of Body, therein much exceeding the other <HI>Chineses:</HI>
And the cause may be, for that they are bred from the Cradle to Wars and
Hardship, by reason of their vicinity to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who are perpetually ma∣king
Wars upon them. As to their Manners and Customs, they resemble
very much the <HI>Tartars;</HI> which comes to pass by the great Intercourse that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
daily between them.</P>
<P>The Country is in some places very Hilly and Mountainous, and in others
plain and even for many Miles together; yet every where very fruitful in
the product of all manner of Cattel, both Wild and Tame; as also in Tree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Fruits of the Fields, wholesom and medicinal both in their Bodies, Leaves,
Fruits, and Roots; amongst others, here grows that incomparable Root <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣seng,</HI>
whereof mention is made before. There are also to be had store of
Rich Furs, as Sables, Bever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they wear in Winter to keep them∣selves
warm, and Traffick with likewise into other Provinces. It also pro∣duces
curious Pine-apples, excellent Wheat and Barley, but no Rice; yet a
great abundance of Figs, Apples, Pears, Grapes, and several other sorts of
Fruits: Which extraordinary Plenty of all Necessary Things of its own
Growth, renders it both pleasant and cheap to live in; but much more, in
regard of its Situation upon the Sea, from whence it is furnish'd with all
manner of Commodities from other Countries.</P>
<P>Their Religion is very little different from that of the other <HI>Chineses,</HI> being
great Promoters of the Doctrine of the Transmigration of Souls out of one
Body into another.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Tartars</HI> having made this Place the Seat of War, whereby they
could at pleasure Invade the Neighboring Provinces, the Emperor and his
Council began to consider which way was the most likely for them to drive
the <HI>Tartars</HI> out of their Territories, and at last they concluded to raise an
Army of 600000 Men; over and above whom, the King of <HI>Corea</HI> sent to
their Assistance 12000 valiant Bow-men, who were not inferior for Skill to
the <HI>Tartars.</HI> In the mean time the <HI>Ninchean</HI> King was not idle, but drew out
of his Kingdom as many Forces as could possibly be spar'd, to joyn with
him. Being thus prepard for Wars on both sides, the <HI>Chineses</HI> in the Year
1619 march'd with that formidable Army against the Enemy; who hearing of
their approach, set forward from their Camp to meet them, which soon hap∣ned;
but then such was the inveterate malice of both Parties, that as soon as
they saw each other the Battel began, which was valiantly fought for a long
time by both Armies, so that the Victory hung in suspence, nor could any
judge who would have the better, till at length the <HI>Chineses</HI> running away in
great disorder and confusion, the slaughter was very great among them, both
of Commanders and Soldiers, upon the Spot, those that escaped carrying the
<PB N="261" REF="146"/>
news of the Overthrow to the Emperor. This great Victory the <HI>Ninchean</HI>
King pursu'd with that expedition, that he took several Cities and Towns,
some whereof they laid in Ashes, and put the Inhabitants to the Sword, har∣rassing
and plundering up to the very Walls of the City of <HI>Peking,</HI> though they
durst not lay Siege to it, there being a Garrison of eighty thousand Men, and
and the Place well fortifi'd with great store of Cannon upon the Walls: Not∣withstanding
which Provision, such was the fear of the <HI>Pekinger,</HI> that if the
<HI>Tartars</HI> had but attempted, they might have been Masters of that great City
without any very hazardous opposition; for the Emperor was again fully
resolv'd, as before, to quit it, and to retire to the Southern Provinces: But
some of his Council, now too late grown wise, alter'd his Purpose, by telling
him, that it would encourage the Enemy, and not only put the whole Em∣pire
into confusion, but hazard the ruine, if not the loss of it. The <HI>Tartars</HI> by
this means being put to a stand, having enrich'd themselves with Booty, de∣stroy'd
some thousands of poor Creatures with the Sword, and burnt down
their Dwellings to the Ground, retreated back to their old Quarters in the
Province of <HI>Leaotung.</HI></P>
<P>During these Troubles the Emperor <HI>Vanlieus</HI> died in the Year 1620. After
whose Death his Son <HI>Taichangus,</HI> a valiant and prudent Prince, succeeded; who
by the Conduct of his Affairs, in a short time gave sufficiently to understand
what good Services his Country was to expect from him, had he not been un∣fortunately
cut off by an untimely Death in the fourth Month of his Reign:
To whom was Successor his Son <HI>Thienkius,</HI> a gallant Person, and no ways in∣ferior
to his Father for Vertue and Courage.</P>
<P>This Monarch finding the unsetledness and danger of his Affairs, made it
his chiefest Concern to contract Friendship, and support his Government
with the Favor and Affection of his Neighbors: for he had taken notice by
experience, how much the Empire of <HI>China</HI> had suffer'd by living always at
great variance with the <HI>Tartar</HI> Kings of <HI>Ninche,</HI> which border'd upon him:
In the first place therefore he endeavor'd to win the Favor of the King of <HI>Corea,</HI>
who had formerly sent to his Grandfather a Supply of twelve thousand Men
to aid and assist him in this War; but they being most of them kill'd and
wounded, he doubted lest this might make him take part against him, and
joyn with the <HI>Tartar;</HI> for prevention whereof, and to satisfie the King in
every scruple, he immediately sent an Ambassador to him, to return him
thanks for those great Succors he had sent; and withal signifying his extraor∣dinary
Grief and Sorrow for the great loss which had fall'n upon the afore-men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion'd
Aids in that War; but that he hoped in a short time to retaliate
upon the Enemy the Wrongs they had done to him and his Kingdom. And
that his Embassy might be the more grateful, he likewise sent several rich Pre∣sents
and promis'd him his Assistance, where and whensoever he should have
occasion to make use of it. But this friendly Message look'd not only for ver∣bal
Returns; for it was design'd as a Motive to procure more Succors from
him: which without doubt he had reason to endeavor, in regard the People
of this Island of <HI>Corea,</HI> which lies very near to <HI>Iapan,</HI> have out of the Neighbor∣hood
far greater Strength than the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>And now craving leave for a little digression, which may not be imperti∣nent,
in regard there has been often mention made of this Island of <HI>Corea</HI> and
the Inhabitants thereof, I shall describe the same in short, and all that is worth
observation in the same.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="147"/>
It is unto this day doubted by those of <HI>Europe,</HI> whether <HI>Corea</HI> be an Island or
firm Land; but according to the opinion of the best Writers, it is a hanging
Island, surrounded with Water on all parts, except the uttermost part, which
is joyn'd to the firm Land; for though Trials have been made to Sail round
about, yet it could never be done, as some People seem to affirm to us from
their own experience, though some there are that affirm the contrary. But this
Error proceeds from a mistake of a certain great Island call'd <HI>Fungina,</HI> situa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
to the Southward of it, to be <HI>Corea.</HI> However it be, this truth is most certain,
that all the <HI>Chinese</HI> Writers affirm <HI>Corea</HI> to be firm Land, and joyning to the
Kingdom of <HI>Ninche</HI> in <HI>Tartary.</HI> Another mistake may arise from the varie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of
the Name given to it; for the <HI>Chineses</HI> call it <HI>Chaosien,</HI> therein following the
<HI>Iapanners,</HI> though by us of <HI>Europe</HI> it is call'd <HI>Corea.</HI></P>
<P>Toward the North it borders upon the Kingdom of <HI>Ninche,</HI> on the North-West
it has for Confine, the River <HI>Yalo;</HI> the rest is surrounded and wash'd
with the Sea.</P>
<P>The whole Island is divided into eight Provinces or Counties: The mid∣dlemost,

the Chief City of <HI>Pingiang,</HI> the Court of the Kings. The second, toward the
East, is call'd <HI>Kiangyven,</HI> but heretofore <HI>Gueipe.</HI> The third, situate toward th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
West, is now known by the Name of <HI>Hoangchui,</HI> but was formerly call'd <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sien,</HI>
the Name at this day proper to the whole Island. The fourth, situate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ward
the South, now call'd <HI>Civenlo,</HI> was formerly nam'd <HI>Pienhari.</HI> The fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th,
also Southerly, but inclining to the East, is call'd <HI>Kingxan.</HI> The sixth, toward
the South-West, is <HI>Changing.</HI> The seventh, toward the North-East, has the
Name of <HI>Pingan.</HI></P>
<P>In these Counties are several populous and rich Cities, which for fashion
and strength differ very little from those in <HI>China,</HI> and built for the most part
four-square.</P>
<P>The Country is very well Peopled, throughout the whole having but one
Form of Government; not at all differing in Habit, and using one and the
same Form both of Speech and Writing. Their Religion is the same with
those of <HI>China,</HI> holding the transmigration of the Soul out of one Body into
another. They all adore one Idol call'd <HI>Fe,</HI> whereof I have already made men∣tion.</P>
<P>The Bodies of their dead Friends they bury not till three years be fully
elapsed, and then they put them into very fine Coffins, after the manner of the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> glu'd up so very close that no scent can strike through.</P>
<P>They give a greater liberty to their Women than the <HI>Chineses;</HI> for they ad∣mit
of them into any Company, whereas the other will hardly suffer them to
stir abroad. Here also the Son or Daughter may Marry whom they think fit,
without asking the consent of Father or Mother: which is quite contrary to
the use of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and indeed all other civiliz'd People.</P>
<P>This Island is very fruitful in the product of all manner of Fruits necessary
for the sustenance of Life, especially of Wheat and Rice, whereof there are
twice a year plentiful Harvests. Here also are made several sorts of Paper,
and curious Pencils of Wolves Hair, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> and other neighboring
People as well as themselves use in Writing. Here grows likewise the Root
<HI>Guiseng,</HI> and (as is reported) are several Gold-Mines. But notwithstanding all
these Advantages of natural Commodities wherewith this Place abounds, yet
the Inhabitants thereof drive no Trade with any other forein People, but only
<PB N="263" REF="147"/>
those of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Iapan.</HI> And thus much shall suffice to be spoken of <HI>Corea;</HI>
we will now return to give an Account of the sequel of the Wars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor, after his Embassy to the King of <HI>Corea,</HI> to prevent the
further Invasion of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and the better to oppose them, muster'd several
Troops rais'd for his assistance out of the fifteen Provinces or Kingdoms of the
Empire, and sent very great Armies towards <HI>Leaotung:</HI> And the better to fur∣nish
such vast Armies with Provisions, he caus'd an extraordinary great Fleet
of Ships to be Equipp'd in the famous Port of <HI>Thiencin,</HI> which were wholly
employ'd to carry Provisions by Sea from all parts of <HI>China</HI> for their supply;
by the exact performance and observing whereof they had no want of any
thing.</P>
<P>Amongst other Martial Commanders and Governors of Provinces that had
the Conduct of these Armies, there was a certain Woman who may very justly
be call'd <HI>The Chinese Amazon;</HI> for she came with three thousand Men out of
<HI>Suchue,</HI> which is the furthermost Province of <HI>China</HI> toward the West, and shew'd
by her Courage a manly Heart; and she fought several Battels successfully
against the <HI>Tartars,</HI> having always the better of them: In remembrance of
whose good Services, the Emperor conferr'd several Titles of Honor upon
her.</P>
<P>And now at last the Emperor <HI>Thienkius,</HI> being come in Person into his
Army in <HI>Leaotung,</HI> and having in manner afore-mention'd taken care to have
it fully supply'd with all convenient Necessaries, drew up the same in Battel-aray,
and on a sudden fell furiously upon the <HI>Tartars,</HI> beat them out of the
Field, and recover'd the whole Province with less difficulty than was suppos'd
or expected, in regard the Inhabitants, who had been miserably handled by
the <HI>Tartars,</HI> joyn'd with their Country-men the Emperor's Forces; by which
addition being come far more numerous than the Enemy, and having advan∣tage
of revenge, they fell upon them with great rage and fury, stirr'd up there∣to
by having before their Eyes the lamentable Condition into which they had
brought their Country by Fire and Sword: And to say all in a word, it was
their good fortune, that at this time the King of <HI>Ninche</HI> was so unfortunate,
that the Mutinies of his own Subjects at home hindred him from recruiting
his Army, which in divers great Battels had been much wasted, and he could
get no Forces from thence to re-inforce himself; so that at last being every
where worsted by the Emperor's Supplies, the incroaching <HI>Ninchean</HI> was fain
to save himself by flight, and to leave the Province of <HI>Leaotung</HI> to the con∣quering
Sword of its just and lawful Emperor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the last Chinese and Tartar War, wherein the Tartars over-ran
and conquer'd the whole Empire of China.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough by the means mention'd in the last Chapter, the <HI>Chinese</HI> Empire
was a while freed from the fury and destroying Sword of the wasting
<HI>Tartars;</HI> yet it was not long before it fell into far greater Troubles
than ever, by those their old Enemies, who once more renew'd the War, and
never left it off till they had brought under the whole Empire. The manner
as followeth:</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="148"/>
The <HI>Chineses</HI> suspecting the return of the <HI>Tartars</HI> after that they had quieted
their domestick Troubles, and setled their Affairs, in the mean time took
care to supply the Frontier Places with strong Garrisons, and raise more For∣ces
for the security of their State: which was scarcely perform'd before it
hapned as they imagin'd; for the Troubles and Mutinies being appeas'd in
<HI>Ninche,</HI> that King returns with a mighty Army into the West of <HI>Leaotung,</HI> ha∣ving
given order to seventy thousand Horse (whom he sent before) to block
up the Chief City of <HI>Leaoyang,</HI> assuring them he himself would follow with the
main of his Army. These Horsemen, to shew their Courage and Valour, no
sooner approach'd, but they Storm'd the City, and in two days time became
Masters of it, before their King came up to them with his Forces. There wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
no Courage wanting on either side; for it was manfully fought out by both,
till at least thirty thousand Men were kill'd on the part of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and no
less on that of the <HI>Tartars</HI> (wo had never lost so many Men before in any one
Fight in this Quarrel;) yet at last they took the City, not so much by their own
Strength, as Treachery hatch'd within it: for they had Brib'd one of the Com∣manders
with Money and promise of Preferment, to set open the Gate com∣mitted
to his Charge: which he performing according to the Agreement, the
<HI>Tartar</HI> came rushing into the City, and won the same in the space of a few
hours, laying it level with the Ground in a most miserable manner. The <HI>Tu∣tang</HI>
or Governor having understood the Treason, took it so much to heart, that
he hang'd himself presently, that he might not live to see the ruine and deso∣lation
that was coming upon the City and its Inhabitants. The Emperor's
chief Councellor had undoubtedly follow'd his Example, and undergone the
same Fate, had he not been prevented by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who took him and sav'd
his Life, only out of design that he should be serviceable unto them in disco∣vering
the Condition of the Country: But he not valuing his Life, scorn'd to
give the Title of <HI>KING</HI> to the <HI>Tartar,</HI> and would in no wise be persuaded
to falsifie the Oath, and betray the Trust reposed in him by the Emperor. The
<HI>Tartars</HI> wondring at the Courage, Stability, and Constancy of this Man, gave
him afterwards both his Life and Liberty, thereby to let the World know,
that they understood how to reward Vertue and Integrity. But he, more cruel
to himself than the Enemy, knowing very well what Reward (according to
the <HI>Chinese</HI> Law) would fall to his share, depriv'd himself at last of his own
Life, which his Enemy had spar'd, by following the Example of the fore-men∣tion'd
<HI>Tutang:</HI> for it is a known Law and Custom in <HI>China,</HI> though very un∣reasonable,
That all Generals and Commanders of Forts and Garrisons,
though they behave themselves never so well, if they come off unfortunately,
forfeit their Lives when they return home.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> after the taking and destroying of this City, immediately issu'd
out a Proclamation, That the Inhabitants of no City should s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffer any Da∣mage
either in Life or Estate, if they would cut off their Hair, leaving only
a single Lock behind; and pull out all the Hair of their Beards, except their
Mustachio's, and likewise go Cloth'd after the <HI>Tartar</HI> Fashion.</P>
<P>Although this Command was strict, yet it carried with it some shew of
Favor, and consequently gain'd a kind of Love, until the <HI>Tartars,</HI> by some
barbarous Acts they committed afterwards, were very much hated and abo∣minated.
The Story goes thus: There being at that time several Merchants
come to the City with Commodities from other Parts of <HI>Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> to Trade
withal, the <HI>Tartar</HI> at their Request gave them free leave to go and come;
<PB N="265" REF="148"/>
whereupon these innocent People, not apprehending the dangerous mis∣chief
that was design'd against them, departed with their Riches and Goods:
But they were hardly got three Miles out of the City, when the <HI>Tartars</HI> lying
in wait for them, fell upon and kill'd them every one, taking as free Plunder
all they had, which they brought with them into the City triumphantly, as if
it had been the Spoil of an open Enemy. Which barbarous usage being heard
of, occasion'd a great amazement amongst the Inhabitants, who knew no
other but that they might be serv'd every moment after the same manner. But
notwithstanding all their salvage cruelty, they were at present necessitated to
make a halt, in regard of the great loss they had sustain'd before this City of
<HI>Leaoyang;</HI> nor durst they venture to march further up into the Country, or
lay Siege to any Place of importance, till they had first recruited themselves;
for they found all the Frontier Towns and Places of Strength well fortifi'd and
guarded.</P>
<P>Amongst all other <HI>Chinese</HI> Commanders who signaliz'd themselves in shew∣ing
their Courage in their Countries behalf against the Enemy, was one <HI>Mao∣venlung,</HI>
who did very great execution upon them in several Encounters: He
was a Native of the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> where he had learn'd and under∣stood
in his Conversation amongst the <HI>Portuguese</HI> at <HI>Macao,</HI> several things con∣cerning
their Military Discipline: From thence he had likewise brought with
him several great Guns, which he purchased out of a <HI>Netherland</HI> Ship that was
cast away there, and those he Planted upon the Walls of the Chief City of
<HI>Ningyven.</HI></P>
<P>The Eastern part of <HI>Leaotung,</HI> and the Chief City of <HI>Leaoyang</HI> being thus lost,
in this new made Chief City there hapned to be at the same time the <HI>Tutang</HI>
or Vice-Roy of <HI>Leaotung</HI> with the whole <HI>Chinese</HI> Army. The <HI>Tartars</HI> having
many times had trial, to their sorrow and cost, of the Courage of this <HI>Maoven∣lung,</HI>
having often been routed by him, durst not adventure any further to
Cope with him in an honorable way, but bethought themselves of some Stra∣tagem
or politick Device, whereby to wound the Integrity and Vertue of this
brave Person; and they suppos'd the best means to assail him with, would be
fair words and high Promises: Wherefore to put in execution this their De∣sign,
they offer'd him by a private Letter (which they caus'd cunningly to be
deliver'd to him) half the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> if he would desert his natural
Prince with the Flower of his Army, and help them to conquer the Empire.
But <HI>Maovenlung,</HI> who would neither forfeit his Honor nor Oath, courageously
refus'd these high Offers, and return'd for Answer, <HI>That he had rather lose his
Life, than betray his Prince and Country.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> finding that this Plot of theirs would take no effect, and that
the <HI>Chineses</HI> had well provided against their coming, resolv'd to desist, and to
make no further progress in the present War, which wholly ceased till the
Year 1625. when suddenly it breaking forth again, they came and besieg'd
the Chief City of <HI>Ningyven.</HI> This greatly startled the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who thought
they had overcome the greatest difficulty and danger. But <HI>Maovenlung</HI> came
time enough to the rescue and relief of this Place, and fell so furiously upon
the Besiegers, that they were forc'd to raise their Siege, with the loss of at least
ten thousand Men that were slain upon the Spot, amongst whom fell the
King's own Son; whose Death was so highly resented by the surviving <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
that they in a great rage and madness made over the Ice (for it was
in Winter,) and getting into the Island of <HI>Theyoven</HI> (whereof they quickly
<PB N="266" REF="149"/>
made themselves Masters) they put every living Creature they found to the
Sword (which were a very great number) in revenge of the young Prince;
which having done, they immediately left the Province of <HI>Leaotung,</HI> and re∣treated
into their own Country, not with an intention to be quiet, but only
to recruit themselves with more Forces, and then to return again at a conve∣nient
time.</P>
<P>And hereupon follow'd a Cessation of Arms, till the Year 1627. when
the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor <HI>Thienkius</HI> hapned to die, being but a young Man, whose
Death prov'd to be the loss of all <HI>China;</HI> although the <HI>Tartar</HI> King of <HI>Ninche</HI>
call'd <HI>Thienning,</HI> who had destroy'd so many thousands of People by Fire and
Sword, did not long survive, but as an Attendant on his Corps, died the same
Year.</P>
<P><HI>Thienkius</HI> was succeeded by his Brother, who was very unfortunate in all his
Undertakings, and at length, through the treachery of his Subjects, had both
an unfortunate Reign and Death, as by the remaining part of the History will
appear.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar</HI> King <HI>Thienning</HI> had for his Successor in the Throne his Son
<HI>Thientung,</HI> who quickly chang'd the salvage and barbarous Manners and Cu∣stoms
us'd by his tyrannizing Father; insomuch that he did not pursue the
<HI>Chineses</HI> so fiercely, but began to treat them with more Civility, which pro∣duc'd
a very great Change, and caus'd all his Affairs to become more accepta∣ble.
And certainly this prudent and politick Prince had effected great things,
had he not been cut off by an untimely Death, his mildness having gotten so
great renown withal, that the Council who had made choice of him, thought
themselves happy in the Change, and withal learn'd from him by Example,
that the <HI>Chineses</HI> would sooner be reduc'd and brought under their Govern∣ment
by Clemency and Civility, than by force of Arms.</P>
<P>In this Year 1627. the Commanders and Officers of General <HI>Maovenlung,</HI>
who by reason of the quietness of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> had no Enemy to Encounter,
began much to molest, and be injurious to their Friends and Allies of <HI>Core<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
by making Inroads and Incursions upon them; nay, by degrees they grew so
very insolent and troublesom to all Parts adjoining to their Quarters, espe∣cially
the Inhabitants of the Province of <HI>Hienkien,</HI> who were so intolerably
oppress'd by their Rapines, that out of revenge and hatred they put themselves
under the Protection of the <HI>Tartar,</HI> advising him to re-invade and fall into
<HI>China</HI> with a mighty Army; which he (not willing to let slip so fair an oppor∣tunity)
immediately did; so that a very great Army was in the Field ready to
assail the <HI>Chinese</HI> Forces, before they had any thoughts of an Enemy, and when
they least dream'd of their coming; who by this means lying carelesly dis∣pers'd
up and down in the Provinces, were soon destroy'd. <HI>Maovenlung</HI> how∣ever
rallied, and by the addition of some new Leavies and Recruits being
grown into a strong Body, he fought several doubtful Battels with the <HI>Tar∣tars;</HI>
but they at last growing superior to him in Strength and number, <HI>Mao∣venlung</HI>
the <HI>Chinese</HI> General was constrain'd to quit the Field with the gross of
his Army.</P>
<P>Yet neither the loss of the Army, nor greatness of the Victory obtain'd by
the <HI>Tartars,</HI> did make any great impression upon the <HI>Chineses;</HI> nor indeed were
they troubled at it, when they understood that their General had sav'd himself
out of the Island of <HI>Corea.</HI> But the <HI>Ninchean</HI> Commanders imagining that those
of that Place had been instrumental in helping to convey the General <HI>Maoven∣lung</HI>
<PB N="267" REF="149"/>
away, with their Army fell into it, plundering the Inhabitants, and ruin∣ing
the Country by Fire and Sword. This Act was highly disapprov'd of by
the <HI>Tartar</HI> King himself, because it stirr'd up the King of <HI>Corea</HI> to Arm against
him, and joyn his Forces with those of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which <HI>Maovenlung</HI> had been
gathering together, and with them was marching towards <HI>Corea</HI> to revenge
himself upon the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> having thus inhumanely, and without reason turn'd their Arms
upon the Countries of <HI>Corea,</HI> were setting forward with their Army against the
Royal City thereof, and were arriv'd at the beginning of the Mountains
(through which the Way runs to the City) being about seven Miles from the
same. Here the King of <HI>Corea,</HI> in the narrow Way, had pitch'd to receive them;
and the <HI>Tartars</HI> being eager to Fight, furiously assail'd the <HI>Coreans</HI> in their Sta∣tion,
so that there began a bloody Battel; but both Armies were hardly En∣gag'd,
before the valiant <HI>Maovenlung</HI> came up with his, and fell like Lightning
into the Rere of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> who now finding themselves beset before and
behind with two such potent Armies, and no other way for safety or escape,
than what their Zables could cut out for them, resolv'd not to part with their
Lives at a cheap rate, and spurr'd on by despair, they fought without any fear,
every one endeavoring to exceed the other in Valour and Courage; so that in
the very Writings of the <HI>Chineses</HI> they are extoll'd, saying, <HI>There was never the
like Battel fought between them.</HI> But that which is chiefly to be admir'd is, that of
three so great Armies none obtain'd the Victory, but were all of them almost
totally ruined and destroy'd: There were kill'd fifty thousand Men on the
side of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> those of <HI>Corea</HI> had seventy thousand slain; but the loss of
the <HI>Chineses</HI> was so great, that few or none escaped: Those of the <HI>Tartars</HI> that
surviv'd, made their way home into their own Country as fast as they could,
by which means the King of <HI>Corea</HI> had the opportunity of recovering his Coun∣try
again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> having sustain'd so great an Overthrow, were very careful af∣terwards
how they provok'd the Inhabitants of <HI>Corea;</HI> yet still they continu'd
to make several Inroads into the Province of <HI>Leaotung,</HI> till at last they wholly
subdu'd the Eastern part, and plunder'd the remainder thereof; but this was
done by fits, and at several times: for they never durst venture to seat them∣selves
there, nay, they paid oftentimes very dear for their Robberies.</P>
<P>While Affairs stood in this posture, the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> whose Name was
<HI>Zungchinius,</HI> sent his General <HI>Yvenus</HI> with a strong Army, and a large Com∣mission,
toward <HI>Leaotung;</HI> having also private Instructions to conclude a
Peace with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> if they would agree to it, but if they refus'd, then forth∣with
to make a sharp War upon them: And to say truth, he was necessitated
to make this Proposition, for that his whole Empire was as it were over-spread
with Highway-men and Robbers, so that he stood in greatest fear of them;
for their numbers daily so increased, that if they should once joyn into one
Body, it would be no difficult matter for them to make themselves Masters of
the Kingdom.</P>
<P>This <HI>Yvenus,</HI> upon whom the Emperor had conferr'd such high and ample
Authority, was a perfect Courtier, of an affable and free Speech, and one that
knew very well how to use his Pen with so much advantage and ingenuity,
that there was hardly any one in the Court to be compar'd with him. By these
singular Perfections he had won not only the Heart of the Emperor, but of all
the Grandees, so that the management of all Affairs was wholly left to him.
<PB N="268" REF="150"/>
But here it must be observ'd, That he was insatiably covetous of Wealth, and
consequently for obtaining thereof stuck not to perpetrate any clandestine
Mischief; otherwise, by his more than common Parts, he might undoubtedly
have done extraordinary Services both to his Prince and Country: But nei∣ther
the greatness of the Trust repos'd in him, nor the Love of his Country,
were in any measure answerable to his Thirst after Riches: <HI>Unde habeat quaerat
nemo, sed oportet habere.</HI> Of which avaricious temper of his the <HI>Tartars</HI> having
information, and looking upon him as a fit Instrument to be employ'd in
their Design, they never left sending to him extraordinary Presents, accom∣panied
with large Promises of the most eminent Preferments: With which
Baits being taken, he contracted Friendship with them, promising to give
them his Assistance when it should lie in his power. And as the first Proof of
his Friendship to them (through the cunning instigation of the <HI>Tartars)</HI> he
undertook privately to murther the valiant and faithful Commander <HI>Mao<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en∣lung,</HI>
of whom the <HI>Tartars</HI> stood in great fear and awe; which he accordingly
effected with great secresie, by inviting him to Dinner, and poisoning him
with a Cup of Drink which he caus'd to be given him at the Table.</P>
<P>Having thus clandestinely accomplish'd this his monstrous Undertaking,
he concludes a Peace with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> upon most dishonorable and disadvan∣tageous
Terms for his Prince; who no sooner read the same, but he refus'd
to Observe and Ratifie them. <HI>Yvenus,</HI> conscious of what he had done, and well
seeing that upon the making good of this Treaty of Peace, his Honor and
Authority depended, advis'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> to force the Emperor, his natural
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord, to the Observation thereof by force of Arms: Whereupon in the year
1630. upon his Promises not to oppose them in the least, if they would make
an Invasion in some other Part of the Empire where he had no Command,
this treacherous Advice was no sooner given, than accepted and put in execu∣tion;
for the <HI>Tartars</HI> doubted so little of the Promises of <HI>Yvenus,</HI> by reason
of his extraordinary Covetousness, that without taking any further Counsel,
they pour'd their Forces into the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> Plundering all Places
where they came, and laying the same afterwards in Ashes; and at last so
was their Courage, or rather Fury, heightned, that they laid Siege to the Im∣perial
City of <HI>Peking:</HI> at whose approach, it is no marvel if the confusion
and amazement were great, not only amongst the Citizens, but also amongst
the Rix-Counsellors, who in this dangerous vicissitude of Affairs earnestly ad∣vis'd
the Emperor to leave the City, and to retire to the Southern Provinces:
but he would by no means hearken to their Counsel, saying, <HI>That he would ra∣ther
be cut in a thousand Pieces, than that it should be said he fled for fear of the Tar∣tars.</HI>
Wherefore both as a Valiant Soldier and Careful Prince, he immedi∣ately
gave order to his Commanders not to suffer any to depart out of the
City upon pain of death; but that they should incite and stir up all the Peo∣ple
to a Courageous Defence.</P>
<P>While this was doing within, the <HI>Tartars</HI> without began to Storm the Ci∣ty,
but were beaten off with great loss upon several Attempts, so that they
concluded to continue the Siege with more moderation, and rather endeavor
to take it by Famine, than hazard the weakning of their Army by such fruit∣less
and unsuccessful Assaults. At length, by advice of his Council, the Em∣peror
sent for <HI>Yvenus</HI> to come to his Assistance and Relief with the Army un∣der
his Command (for as yet his Treachery was not discover'd:) who upon
the first Intelligence, to prevent the Emperor from having any suspicion of
<PB N="269" REF="150"/>
him, came with his Army under the Walls of <HI>Peking,</HI> but kept at a great di∣stance
from that of the Besiegers; neither shew'd he any hostility against
them, but in stead thereof advis'd the Emperor to the Observation of the
Terms upon which the Treaty of Peace (the cause of this War) had begun:
And this he strongly labor'd to perswade him to, not only to prevent the dis∣covery
of the Treason, but that so he might return home with great Wealth
and Riches, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> had promis'd him in case the Peace took effect.
<HI>Zungchinius</HI> considering what the meaning of such Advice might tend to, be∣gan
to mistrust the Fidelity of his General; and afterwards by other means
being more fully satisfi'd of his treacherous dealing, for the destruction and
ruine of the State, he sent privately unto him, to desire his Presence in the
City at the Council of War, to advise with the rest of the Military Officers,
what was best to be done in that dangerous Exigent, for the Safety and welfare
of the whole Empire. Now it is to be noted, That the Emperor would not
suffer any Gate to be set open, under pretence that the Enemy lay close to the
Walls; but in truth, for fear lest <HI>Yvenus</HI> should crowd in upon him with his
whole Army: therefore he sent him word, that he should come to the Walls,
and they would draw him up privately into the City over the Wall. Of this
Design of the Emperor <HI>Yvenus</HI> had not the least inkling given him by any of
the Council; for indeed the Emperor at this time making himself alone his
own Privy-Councellor, had not discover'd to any what he knew of the Trea∣son
hatch'd against him by <HI>Yvenus,</HI> nor of what he intended against him for
his Reward; but only that he would confer with him about some Affairs in
order to the Preservation of the City: for had the Emperor never so li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle dis∣cover'd
either his Knowledge or Intentions, <HI>Yvenus</HI> would soon have been ad∣vertis'd
thereof, having his Creatures in all Corners of the City, to give him
intelligence of all Affairs; but this being by his silence and secresie prevented,
<HI>Yvenus</HI> came without any fear into the City, and address'd himself to the Em∣peror,
in whose Presence, upon his very first appearance, he was Apprehended
and Beheaded. This being a Publick Act, could not be long conceal'd, nor
indeed was it; for the <HI>Tartars</HI> heard of it presently, and thereupon rais'd their
Siege, and left the Imperial City, out of fear of being attaqu'd by the Royal
Army, which lay not far from them, as soon as the Emperor should have ap∣pointed
a faithful Commander over the same in stead of the Traytor <HI>Yvenus:</HI>
However, in their Return and March back they ruin'd and destroy'd whatever
stood in their way, and with great store of Wealth and Booty got at last into
the Province of <HI>Leaotung.</HI></P>
<P>The War continu'd till the Year 1636. with various Events, sometimes the
<HI>Chineses</HI> having the better, otherwhiles the <HI>Tartars;</HI> but however the <HI>Chineses</HI>
defended themselves so well against them till that time, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> did ne∣ver
set footing in <HI>China,</HI> but they were driven out again with great loss.</P>
<P>In the same Year 1636. the <HI>Tartar</HI> King <HI>Thienzungus</HI> died, and his Son <HI>Zung∣teus</HI>
(the Father of the present Emperor who now wears the Royal Diadem
in <HI>China)</HI> succeeded him: A Prince so endow'd with all the most excellent
Qualities both of Art and Nature, as if design'd for some great Undertaking:
He exceeded all his Ancestors in Parts and Prudence; and in his Minority,
before he attain'd the Crown, gave no small signs of an excellent Understand∣ing.
To descend a little to Particulars: He was both Learned, Courteous,
and of a good Disposition: Being yet in his juvenile Years, he was sent by
his Father into <HI>China,</HI> under the Tuition of some of his Council, who put him
<PB N="270" REF="151"/>
into the <HI>Chinese</HI> Habit: Here he liv'd privately a long time, learn'd the <HI>Chinese</HI>
Language, and exchang'd the rough and salvage Behaviour of his own Coun∣try,
for the more civil and gentile Behaviour of the <HI>Chineses;</HI> so that when he
had got into the Throne, he Reign'd with much mildness, moderation, and
affability, carrying himself towards his Subjects quite contrary to the morose
Nature of his Ancestors, whose Cruelty and Severity he observ'd to have been
the overthrow, or at least the retarding of all their Designs against the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
whom by his Conversation among them while he liv'd there, he found were
better to be won with a soft and mild Hand, than with rough and harsh usage:
Wherefore he resolv'd to alter the way and manner of the Government of his
Ancestors, and to confirm himself in his Throne rather by the love of his Sub∣jects,
than by force of Arms. This his prudent Carriage immediately won to
him the Hearts not only of his own natural Subjects, but of the <HI>Chineses</HI> his
Enemies, who when they submitted to him, were treated as his own Subjects:
Such as were conquer'd by him in the War, were civilly accommodated, and
receiv'd into Favor and Service; and the rest that were willing to return home,
had free leave at their own pleasures to be gone. By this winning sweetness
the Fame of this Prince spread at last among several of his Neighbors, so that
they sought unto him for his Friendship and Protection; which stood him in
great stead afterwards in the Conquest of <HI>China.</HI> He always preferr'd only
Men of Abilities into Offices and Places of Trust; and such Commanders or
Governors as fled to him out of <HI>China</HI> for any suppos'd Crime or Offence, had
not only their Liberties, but were also much made of, and put into Employ∣ments:
for by the <HI>Chinese</HI> Government, to prevent Treachery and Covetous∣ness,
it is ordain'd and setled as a fixed Law, <HI>That all the Princes, Governors, or
Commanders in Chief, under whose Authority any Misfortune happens, shall lose his Head
without mercy:</HI> As for Example, If a General happen to be unfortunately de∣feated;
if a Governor lose his Province over which he is appointed; or that
a Mutiny happen among the People or Army, though neither of them were
by any probable or rational ways able to prevent it, yet they shall lose their
Lives for it; so that the <HI>Chinese</HI> Generals and Governors finding upon all oc∣casions,
that the King of <HI>Tartary</HI> was kind and civil to such as fled to him, made
thither as soon as any thing went amiss with them, for which they knew they
had incurr'd the Penalty of losing their Heads.</P>
<P>At this time there seem'd to be a Cessation of all Warlike and Hostile Acti∣ons;
for although the <HI>Tartars</HI> held the Western part of the Province of <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣tung,</HI>
yet the East part was so well guarded with Forts and Soldiers, that they
thought themselves secure from any future or further Invasion on that side:
Nor were the adjacent Places in any great fear, for that there was a very strong
Army thereabouts to hinder them from making any further Inroads into the
said Province.</P>
<P>But this noble and flourishing Empire had that Viper hatching within its
Bowels, that would work its Confusion, and was the only occasion of its
Overthrow; for (as was said before) at that time it was full of Vagabonds,
Thieves and Robbers, who not only wasted, but at last deliver'd it up a Prey to
the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as you may more clearly understand by the sequel of the Story.</P>
<P>The first Insurrection and Treachery of these Robbers and Highway-men
was discover'd in the Province of <HI>Suchue,</HI> where joyning with a sort of wild
People that live among the Rocks and Mountains, they began the mischief,
and open'd the Flood-gate of Rebellion, by subtilly opposing the Authority
<PB N="271" REF="151"/>
that was over them. Their first Work was to fall a Plundering, or in plain
<HI>English,</HI> Stealing, without any exception of Persons, whatsoever they could
meet with: In which their rebellious and unlawful Undertaking being suc∣cessful,
they at last resolv'd to make an open war, and to that end laid Siege to
<HI>Chingtu,</HI> the Chief City of the Province; which they had without doubt taken;
had not the above-mention'd <HI>Amazon</HI> opportunely come to its Rescue; for
these insolent and now commanding Thieves having heard of the Fame of
her extraordinary Courage, were struck with such a terror, that upon the first
inkling of her approach they immediately rais'd the Siege, and left the City
with great loss. But this, though for a while it diverted them, yet it did not
so deter them as to make them cease from any farther Attempt; for returning
toward the Mountains, they presently rallied again, and recruited their Forces
with some fresh Supplies, wherewith they continu'd to forage and spoil the
Country.</P>
<P>To heighten and encourage the Insolence of these Villains, it hapned that in
the Province of <HI>Queicheu</HI> there had pass'd an unjust Sentence in a certain Cause
between two great Men, by reason whereof he against whom the Cause went,
endeavor'd the same revers'd; but notwithstanding all his Endeavors, as well
by himself as Friends and Alliance, there was no good to be done therein. The
Robbers, after the raising of the Siege, kept themselves in great numbers upon
the Mountains, without making any further Disturbance; but they sent to
this injur'd Person, to let him know, that if he pleas'd to accept of their
Power, they would stand by him with their Lives, to help him to redress his
Wrong, provided he would become their General, and be assistant to them in
the carrying on of their Designs. This Great Person possess'd yet with fury
and a desire of Revenge for the Injury done him, was not long in consulting,
but presently accepted of their Offer, looking upon the same as the best and
most likely means, not only to repair his Damages, but to revenge himself al∣so.
Upon knowledge of this Acceptance, these Robbers submitt with extraor∣dinary
alacrity to his Command and Authority; wherein he was no sooner
Invested, but first of all they fall upon the Iudge that gave the Sentence, whom
they immediately kill'd: Then they fell upon the Army of the <HI>Tutang</HI> or Vice-Roy,
which they quickly routed and put to slight; but he rallying his Forces,
turn'd back again upon them with such fury, that he forc'd them to flie into
the Mountains with a very great slaughter; notwithstanding all which, they
recruited again, but kept in their Holds till they had an opportunity to shew
themselves again, as they did in a short time after.</P>
<P>Those Depredations, together with the infinite number of Grashoppers,
which had destroy'd all the Grass and Fruits of the Field in the seven Northern
Provinces of <HI>China,</HI> causing a scarcity of Provision, and consequently a great
dearness, gave a very great occasion to the rising and encreasing of the num∣ber
of these Thieves, which hapned chiefly in the Provinces of <HI>Xensi</HI> and
<HI>Xantung.</HI></P>
<P>Another Provocation or Instigation was, That the Emperor <HI>Zungchinius,</HI>
being of a covetous and miserable Nature, would have (notwithstanding the
Dear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h) the usual yearly Taxes paid him, as in a fruitful Year; which Exa∣ction
set the Inhabitants of those Provinces upon Plotting against him, and at
length to joyn with the Robbers, by whose assistance in a short time they
brought eight strong Armies into the Field, appointing for their Generals such
as they counted the most valiant Men among them.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="152"/>
These Robbers and Mutineers having now thus strengthned themselves with
Forces, and got great store of Wealth by Preying and Stealing, resolv'd not to
rest here, but driving higher Designs in their Heads, and aiming at greater
Matters, they began to consult about reducing the whole Empire under
their Subjection, and Dethroning the Emperor: For the accomplishing
whereof, and advancing himself, every one of the eight Generals thought him∣self
of sufficient Strength to get that Morsel, and fancied himself capable and
fit to bear so weighty a Burthen. With which ambitious thoughts puffed up,
each of them began to make War upon the other, every one being in hopes to
be Conqueror, and to encircle his Head with the Royal Diadem, and enoble
his Posterities Blood by the possession of the Empire. This War continu'd
till six of the eight Generals were slain, and only the two stoutest, <HI>Licungzus</HI>
and <HI>Changhienchungus,</HI> left alive to dispute the Quarrel. For the more easie
bringing this to pass, each endeavor'd to win to his Party the Forces of the
other slain Generals, to strengthen themselves; for to such a heighth was their
Ambition grown, that there was no thoughts of dividing the Stakes between
them, each resolving to be <HI>aut Caesar aut nihil;</HI> so strangely were they lifted up
with the thoughts of Soveraignty.</P>
<P>Fill'd with these aspiring thoughts, these two Generals took several ways
to advance their Interests and Designs; <HI>Licungzus</HI> with his Forces falling into
the Provinces of <HI>Xensi</HI> and <HI>Honan:</HI> but the other imagining to get the best
Booty in those of <HI>Suchue</HI> and <HI>Huquang,</HI> march'd thither; so that now they no
longer fought one against another as formerly, but seeking Wealth and Booty,
were remov'd to a great distance.</P>
<P>In these Transactions the Emperors Concerns began to look with a had
Countenance, as if the Government it self were suddenly to undergo some fa∣tal
Alteration; for the <HI>Tartars</HI> (who were not ignorant of these Proceedings)
had in their former Wars made such havock of brave Commanders, that there
were hardly any left, whose knowledge in Military Discipline capacitated them
for Conduct of the Forces which were marching to subdue these rebellious
Plunderers under the two Generals.</P>
<P><HI>Licungzus</HI> in the Year 1641. march'd with his Army out of the Province of
<HI>Xensi,</HI> after he had wholly plunder'd and destroy'd its chiefest Cities, into the
plentiful Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> directly to the famous City <HI>Caifung;</HI> which he pre∣sently
begirt and block'd up so close, that there was no going in nor coming
out: but the Place being well fortifi'd and provided with a good Garrison
and Provisions, the Siege was soon rais'd, and the Besiegers constrain'd to re∣tire
into the Mountains, not without very great loss of Men: But they had
no sooner recruited themselves, but they return'd to the Siege again, with an
intention to have surpriz'd the same on a sudden; but the Citizens having pri∣vately
receiv'd Intelligence thereof, and standing upon their Guards, hinder'd
them from effecting their Design.</P>
<P>The Enemy being thus twice frustrated in his hopes, and seeing no likeli∣hood
of taking the City by force, resolv'd to compel them to a Surrender by a
long and close Siege: And though it were a Place at least three Miles in cir∣cumference,
yet they surrounded the same in such a manner, that no Relief
could possibly be given them. But the Governor after the first Attempt, al∣though
provided with all manner of Necessaries to withstand a Siege; yet in
regard the Harvest of Corn prov'd very bad that Year, found upon survey,
that it was impossible to lengthen out the same by the best Husbandry, to serve
<PB N="273" REF="152"/>
for the Maintenance of such a number of People for six Months; yet still
though their Magazines fell short, they held out, and suffered very great hun∣ger,
in hopes that the Emperor would come or send to their Relief: And
at last such was their want, that a pound of Rice was sold for a Pound of Sil∣ver;
a Pound of old rotten Leather for twenty Shillings; nay, they fed upon
dead Mens Flesh as freely as upon any thing else.</P>
<P>Thus did these Loyal Subjects hold out beyond admiration, before they
would harbor any thoughts of yielding; but when they saw themselves de∣stitute
of all hopes of Succor, they unwillingly submitted to the cruelty of
their Fate.</P>
<P>This <HI>Caifung</HI> lies in a great Valley on the South side of the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> which
runs at least a Mile to the Land-ward from it: And in regard the Water lies
much higher than the Valley wherein the City is built, there is made before it
a Bank or Dike of Stone to hinder the overflowing of the same River.</P>
<P>The Emperor at last understanding into what a Strait the Besieged were
brought, resolv'd to march to their Relief, and to that purpose came with his
Army before the afore-mention'd Stone Bank, with an intention to bore the
same through, and so drown the whole Army of the Besiegers. But the Work∣men
that were intrusted, not being so prudent as they ought to have been in the
execution of a Design so hazardous, made too great an Opening in the Bank,
so that in a few hours the Water gush'd in with such violence, that it not only
drown'd most of the Enemy's Army, but the whole City also was overwhel∣med,
and almost all therein destroy'd with the Inundation. In this miserable
Calamity, thus unfortunately hapning, above three hundred thousand Persons
were drown'd, and this famous City, formerly the ancient Seat of the Empe∣rors
of <HI>China,</HI> upon the ninth of <HI>September 1642.</HI> converted into Pool▪ with the
adjacent Country round about it; for through the violent force of the Water,
not only all the Buildings and Houses were soon overturn'd, but Trees which
had stood for many Ages were wash'd up by the Roots; so that at this time
there is nothing thereof left to be seen.</P>
<P><HI>Licungzus,</HI> who in Person escap'd this Deluge, with some few of his Forces,
yet once more made a shift to recruit his Army; upon the sight and muster
whereof, being still persuaded that he should get into the Throne, took upon
himself the Title of <HI>King,</HI> calling himself <HI>King Xunnanst,</HI> that is, <HI>A Fortunate
King.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Honan</HI> being thus subdu'd and brought to slavery, and the
Inhabitants thereof miserably handled with Plundering and Stealing, this up∣start
King departed with his whole Army, and fell into the Province of <HI>Xensi;</HI>
where he immediately laid close Siege to the Chief City of <HI>Xigan,</HI> which he
took after three days, giving the Plunder thereof to his Soldiers; but out of a
seeming Compassion he gave the Inhabitants their Lives. He made this City,
upon its Reduction, the Seat of his War, and caus'd all manner of Provisions
and Ammunition to be brought out of the Province and laid up there; partly
thereby to keep the Country in awe, and partly to hinder the <HI>Chinese</HI> Army
from any Provisions in those Parts to support themselves against him. And
now becoming over-confident by Success, and doubting no longer of the pos∣session
of the Empire, which he had already appropriated to himself in his
thoughts, he took upon him the Title of <HI>Emperor,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Thienxun,</HI>
which signifies <HI>Obedient to Heaven;</HI> for by pretext of this glorious Name, which
he us'd for a Cloke to his Villany, he gave out in Speeches, and so made his
<PB N="274" REF="153"/>
Soldiers believe, That it was concluded in Heaven that he should ascend the
Throne, and deliver the oppressed Subjects out of the covetous Hands of the
present Emperor, to inflict Punishment on the corrupt Governors of Provin∣ces,
who had over-burthen'd the People with intolerable Taxes; and lastly,
to Govern the Empire in Peace and Quietness. To all this the Renegado <HI>Chine∣ses</HI>
who had sided with <HI>Licungzus</HI> giving easie credit, were very forward not
only to give him the Title of <HI>Emperor,</HI> as his Ambition had assum'd it, but did
verily believe he was sent from Heaven to Govern.</P>
<P>And to add the greater Honor and Lustre to his Name, and win their Fa∣vor,
he Govern'd them with great moderation and mildness, so to make his
Actions and his Name seem agreeable: for such as had done any wrong, un∣derwent
no Corporal Punishment, but were only chastis'd with kind Words
and good Admonitions, All such <HI>Chinese</HI> Governors as refus'd to submit to
him, he caus'd to be put to death when taken by him. He abolish'd and took
off several heavy Taxes, that had been laid, and then continu'd upon the Peo∣ple,
charging such as he made Governors to Rule gently and lovingly over his
Subjects. And after this manner, through his cunning and crafty Insinuations,
did this grand Thief bring under his Obedience several Provinces without spil∣ling
any Blood; for the Commonalty (which is <HI>Bellua multorum capitum &amp; insta∣bile
vulgus)</HI> was hugely pleas'd with this new Model of Governing, applauding
their new Emperor with highest <HI>Eulogiums.</HI></P>
<P>But beside the Troubles occasion'd by the two grand Robbers, there arose
in the Court another Dispute and Discontent as mischievous as the other, and
which was indeed the greatest occasion of the overthrow of the Empire, and
the greatest Divisions amongst the Governors themselves, occasion'd by the
jealousie and hatred they bore to one <HI>Guei</HI> of the King's Bed-Chamber, for the
great Authority committed to him, and Affection shewn him by the Emperor,
who had not only intrusted the whole Government into his Hands, and pre∣ferr'd
him to the best Offices and Charges within his Dominions, but likewise
treated with Respect, as if he had been his Father. But this Favorite not know∣ing
how to keep himself within the limits of Moderation, began so to swell
with Pride, that he caus'd several Great Persons to be punish'd with Death or
Banishment for small Offences. Which exorbitant Cruelties brought him into
great hatred, not only with the Nobles and Grandees, but also with the Prince
<HI>Zungchinius</HI> himself, who, by the information of the Prime Persons about him,
being acquainted with his Carriage, began to abate much of his Love towards
him.</P>
<P>This occasion'd a very great Fraction amongst the Governors and Rix-Councellors,
who were divided upon it into two Factions; so that in a short
time there was hardly any Considerable Person to be found who did not side
with the one or the other, each endeavoring to ruine his Adversary, yet still
both pretending the Welfare of the State. But the Emperor <HI>Zungchinius</HI> fore∣seeing
the ruine that was imminent over his Head through these Divisions, en∣deavor'd
by all the means he could devise to reconcile these intestine Iars, thus
unhappily risen among his Subjects; and in order thereunto, after several other
probable Experiments without any effect, he caus'd the Friends of the before-mention'd
<HI>Guei</HI> to be punish'd in due form of Law, and severely punish'd, as
Disturbers of the Publick Peace: nay, at last he was forc'd to cause <HI>Guei</HI> him∣self
to be put to death, with several others his Adherents, which was put in
execution after this manner:</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="153"/>
According to an ancient Custom of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors, to visit the
Tombs of their Ancestors, this <HI>Guei,</HI> under colour thereof, was made choice
of for the Emperor's Proxy (it being an Employment always committed to
the Greatest Persons in the Empire) who not dreaming of any hurt intended
against him, began his Iourney with a great Train; but he was hardly gone
a Mile out of the City of <HI>Peking,</HI> but a Messenger from the Emperor overtook
him, who deliver'd him a Golden Box, wherein was a Silken Cord, with or∣der
to hang himself therewith; which he readily embrac'd, and presently went
and perform'd. And thus to come to the period of Life, is held by the <HI>Chineses</HI>
for an honorable Death; insomuch that none who have any respect for their
Family will reject or refuse this severe, though inhumane Order and Com∣mand,
when sent him.</P>
<P>But very little advantage did the Emperor reap by the Fall of this his so emi∣nent
Favorite, but rather created more trouble unto himself; for his Adhe∣rents
hereupon began to conspire with the rebellious Robbers, and to swear
Revenge. And these Feuds being spread into the Armies that were sent to sub∣due
those Robbers, made such heart-burnings among the Soldiers, that they
return'd home still with great loss; by means whereof the Emperors Affairs
began to fall daily into a Condition of worse and worse; for the Friends of
the before-mention'd <HI>Guei</HI> did whatever they could to ruine the Emperor, and
the Party adhering to him.</P>
<P>When <HI>Licungzus</HI> receiv'd information of these Divisions between the Em∣peror
and his Commanders and Governors, he concluded that it was now a
covenient time to fall upon the Chief City of <HI>Peking;</HI> whereupon (after he
had well secur'd the Province of <HI>Xensi)</HI> he march'd with his whole Army to
the East, and pass'd with little or no trouble over the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> being not
defended by any; for he might have been easily obstructed, if not totally
prevented in that his Passage with a handful of Men, in regard this River in
those Parts, between the Provinces of <HI>Xensi</HI> and <HI>Xansi,</HI> runs with a very vio∣lent
Stream and Current; but there being no Strength to hinder him, he ea∣sily
got over, and at the first Assault took the famous and great City of <HI>Kiang∣cheu,</HI>
which lies near the said River, and on the South side of the Province.
The news hereof caus'd other Places where he came not to withstand him, only
those of the City of <HI>Thaiyven</HI> held out several days, as it were in a Bravado:
but at last being forc'd to submit, they dearly paid for their opposition; for
the Commanders were all put to the Sword, and a very heavy Fine set upon the
Citizens that surviv'd.</P>
<P>When the Emperor <HI>Zungchinius</HI> receiv'd Intelligence, that these bold Pilla∣gers
were already got over the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> and in the Province of <HI>Xansi,</HI> which
is not very far from the Imperial Court of <HI>Peking,</HI> he immediately caus'd a
very great Army to be rais'd under the Command of his General <HI>Lius,</HI> with
order at least to stop the Robbers in their March, if he could not totally de∣stroy
them: But this great Army effected nothing; for no sooner were they
come in sight of the Enemy, but they deserted their Commanders, and ran
over to them; which so infinitely afflicted the General, that he went away
forthwith and hang'd himself.</P>
<P>The report of these disastrous Actions being spread, immediately fill'd the
whole City of <HI>Peking</HI> with great consternation and amazement, and withal
made so deep an impression into the Heart of the Emperor, that he conclu∣ded
to leave the same, and to depart with his Family to <HI>Nanking:</HI> but from
<PB N="276" REF="154"/>
this his Determination he was earnestly dissuaded, as well by such as were
faithful, as those that intended Treachery towards him. These last, under co∣lour
of Friendship, though they were in Heart Traytors and Enemies to their
Prince and Country, advis'd him to stay, that so with the greater ease and
convenience, before their Conspiracy came to be detected, they might deliver
him up into the Hands of the Rebels: but such as were indeed faithful, ad∣vis'd
his stay for the welfare of the Empire, alledging, That his flight, and the
deserting his Imperial City, would hazard the whole State, by heartning the
Enemy, and discouraging his Subjects: besides, they concluded, That they
were able to defend the City against all Attempts whatsoever of the Enemies
Army, being well provided and fortifi'd with Victuals and Ammunition:
Nay further, That without all peradventure the Inhabitants of all the other
Provinces would not forbear to come to their Relief, when they should hear
that the Emperor was resolv'd not to leave the Imperial City, but to run the
risque of his utmost Fortune, even to the loss of his Life, in the same. Where∣upon
the Emperor rests satisfi'd, and resolves in Person to stand by the City,
and defend the same to the last drop of his Blood.</P>
<P>The Usurper <HI>Licungzus,</HI> on the other hand, no less quick in Intention than
nimble at Action, and well knowing that Proverb, <HI>Virtus an dolus quis in hoste
requirit?</HI> joyning Policy and Force together, sent a great number of his Sol∣diers,
Habited in the same Mode with those of <HI>China,</HI> into the Chief City of
<HI>Peking;</HI> and the better to prevent discovery, he sent them not all at one time,
but now and then one, furnishing some with Money to drive a Trade there,
ordering others to set up Drinking-houses, or to take what other course of
Life they judg'd most free from suspicion, till such time as he came with his
whole Army before the Walls of the City; and then by setting Fire on the
Houses, or some other like Misfortune, they should make some Disturbance in
the City.</P>
<P>The Plot was not better laid than effected, being carried with that privacy,
that nothing of it was ever discover'd by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> till it was put in Executi∣on.
But the ambitious Fox not daring to trust only to this, thought upon some
other means fit to make sure of this his Undertaking; and that which appear'd
most feasible to him, was by corrupting some of the Chief of the Council of
War, which he easily compassed; for they perceiving the Emperor's Affairs
to be in a decaying Condition, were soon persuaded to enter into a Confede∣racy
with him, whereby they oblig'd themselves to deliver up the City to him
at such a time and hour: And so faithful were they in Infidelity, that it was
accordingly perform'd by them in the Month of <HI>May 1644.</HI> when one of the
Gates being by these Traytors set open, the Besiegers suddenly entred; and
although discover'd by such as were faithful to the Emperor, yet they also per∣ceiving
that the City was full of Confusion, and that the Matter was quite past
hope, every one shifted for himself, and left all to the mercy of the Robber.</P>
<P><HI>Licungzus</HI> being thus Master of the City, march'd up directly to the Empe∣ror's
Palace, and with the Prime of his Army was gotten through the second
Gate (which is much to be admir'd; but what will not Treason effect?) before
ever the Emperor knew any thing of what had pass'd; but when he was first
told of the Enemy's being within the Court, he was astonish'd with admira∣tion
at the unexpected hearing of such direful news; but after a small pause,
seeing there was no hope to escape, he took a Pen, and writing a Letter with
his own Blood, accuses therein his Officers of most horrid Treason, earnestly
<FIGURE>
<PB N="277" REF="154"/>
</FIGURE>
desiring and entreating <HI>Licungzus,</HI> that since Heaven had so favor'd his Designs
as to give him the Empire, he would do him (a Prince yielding to his Fate)
that Right, to punish his traiterous and perfidious Officers and Servants with
most severe Punishment.</P>
<P>Having finish'd this Letter, as a Man distracted, he kills his Daughter in
his Chamber, being a young Virgin of seventeen or eighteen years of Age,
that she should not be misus'd and ill treated by the Rogues; and then with a
setled Resolution not to survive this dismal Misfortune, going into the Garden,
with one of his Garters he hang'd himself upon a Plum-Tree. And this was
the miserable Catastrophe of the Emperor <HI>Zungchinius,</HI> who was very unfor∣tunate
during his Reign in all his Undertakings, and is reckon'd for the last
Emperor of the Race of <HI>Taiminga;</HI> for although afterwards some other of that
Line were chosen, yet they are not reckon'd by the <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves among
the Emperors of that Race, in regard that after the Death of <HI>Zungchinius</HI> they
never possess'd the whole, but only some part of the ancient Empire. Thus
was that Race, whose first Founder was the Robber <HI>Chu,</HI> destroy'd and brought
to nothing by another Robber <HI>Licungzus,</HI> who had the Fortune, even beyond
his Hope, though not his Ambition, to subdue the biggest Empire in that part
of the World.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Death begat so great a Grief and Commiseration in the
Chief Governor of the City, that not thinking himself worthy to survive his
unhappy Lord, he went and hang'd himself likewise in the same Place. The
Empress follow'd the same Example, and also all such as were faithful to them,
rather than they would fall into the Hands of the Enemy; for it is counted a
piece of Honor and Faithfulness with the Subjects of that Country, to die
with their Soveraign.</P>
<P><HI>Licungzus</HI> being now Master of <HI>Peking,</HI> presently seats himself in the Impe∣rial
Throne, and the next day caus'd the dead Body of the Emperor to be
hack'd in pieces, and the Plunder of the City to his Soldiers.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Zungchinius</HI> had three Sons, whereof the eldest (seeing his Fa∣ther's
Death, and the City in possession of the Robbers) never appear'd more,
though great search was made for him; to have had him either alive or dead.
Of his loss there are divers opinions, some thinking he was kill'd in the Crowd
<PB N="278" REF="155"/>
unknown; others, that he sav'd himself by flight, amongst those that escap'd
to the Mountains, where they liv'd a long while after.</P>
<P>Beside this, were two other younger Sons, who were brought alive to the
Tyrant; but he caus'd them to be Beheaded presently.</P>
<P>And to shew his tyrannical Cruelty, and that the Barbarism of his Nature
was not at all alter'd by his being gotten into the Throne, he Summon'd the
chiefest Persons of the Empire to a Meeting, under colour of Treating with
them about Business of great consequence; whether being no sooner come,
but a company of the basest Fellows were turn'd in upon them, whose salvage
Fury so unboundedly raged, that it spar'd none but such as had Money enough
to buy off their Lives. But here ended not his Tyranny, as by the following
Tragedy will appear.</P>
<P>Amongst several other Governors and Commanders whom he had taken
Prisoners, there was a very ancient Man nam'd <HI>Us,</HI> who had a Son, call'd
<HI>Usanguejus,</HI> that had the Command of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Army which lay upon the
Frontiers of <HI>Leaotung</HI> against the <HI>Tartars:</HI> of whom the Usurper standing in
fear, as perceiving that he was able to do him very great prejudice with his
Forces, threatned this old Man to put him to death in a most cruel manner,
if he did not forthwith command and enjoyn his Son to come and submit to
him; promising him to reward such his Civility with great Presents and Pre∣ferments.
The decrepit old Man <HI>Us,</HI> in hopes to get his Liberty, and over∣come
with these great Promises, writ a Letter to his Son, the substance where∣of
was to this purpose:
<LETTER>
<P>That the various Changes and Vicissitudes which happen in this World are either pre∣ordain'd
by the Heavens, occasion'd by the Earth, or impuls'd by Destiny. This I write to
you, my Son, to give you notice, that the Emperor <HI>Zungchinius,</HI> and the Government of
the Race of <HI>Taiminga</HI> is totally destroy'd; and that since the Heavens, which order and
manage all things by a just Rule, have given the Dominion to <HI>Licungzus,</HI> it is requisite
that we comply with the Times, and make a Virtue of Necessity, especially if we will escape
all Disasters, prevent a cruel Death, and enjoy his Favor. He promises to enoble you with
a Royal Dignity, and to confer on you all manner of Honor and Friendship, if you will take
part with him, and own him for your Lord and Emperor. Consider well thereof, and know,
that upon your Promise and Consent to this, depends my Preservation; and you may now
either preserve my Life, or destroy it: Weigh with your self the Obligations of Nature,
which will tell you how deeply you are engag'd to preserve him that first gave you Being.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P><HI>Usanguejus</HI> upon the receipt and reading this Letter, though very much trou∣bled
at the Contents thereof, being ty'd by Oath to his natural Prince, an∣swer'd
his Father with these few, but sharp words:</P>
<P>I shall never own him for my Father, who will not be true and faithful to his Prince.
Have you forgot that Faith which you owe to the Emperor? who then can blame me, if I
forget that Obedience which I owe to you? Much rather had I die, than betray my Trust,
and falsifie my Oath.</P>
<P>No sooner had <HI>Usanguejus</HI> sent this Letter to his Father, but he dispatch'd an
Ambassador to the <HI>Grand Tartar Cham,</HI> to desire Assistance against the Usurper
and Tyrant <HI>Licungzus,</HI> who had so unjustly intruded upon the Throne by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and Murder: And to incite the <HI>Tartars</HI> the more speedily to the March,
<PB N="279" REF="155"/>
he promis'd them great store of fine Linnen, Silks, Gold, Silver, and a great
number of very handsom young Women, wherein the <HI>Tartars</HI> take great de∣light,
because they are very scarce amongst them, their Country abound∣ing
more with Men than Women. The <HI>Cham,</HI> who had long been waiting
for such an Opportunity, readily accepted of his Offer, promising to assist him
with a considerable Army, which then lay ready in the Province of <HI>Leaotung:</HI>
And in truth he was as good as his Promise; for it was not long before he
began his March with an Army of eighty thousand Men, to joyn with
<HI>Usanguejus;</HI> to whom at meeting he thus spake:</P>
<P>That we may not be baffled in our Undertaking, I judge it necessary, and advise you
earnestly, to put all your Soldiers into <HI>Tartar</HI> Habits, to wear Caps and short Hair, that so
the Tyrant by this Stratagem may be deceiv'd; for that he will take them all for <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Usanguejus,</HI> whose Heart boil'd with Revenge, agreed to all that the <HI>Tartar</HI>
desir'd of him, not considering that he brought in Tygers (according to the
Saying of the <HI>Chineses)</HI> to hunt out Dogs.</P>
<P>This Confederacy against <HI>Licungzus</HI> was not so privately carried, but he had
intelligence thereof: But when the news was brought him, that they were
not only joyn'd, but upon their March against him, it struck such a terror in∣to
the Robber, that he presently quitted the Imperial City of <HI>Peking,</HI> not da∣ring
to stay or abide their coming, and fled into the Province of <HI>Xensi</HI> for safe∣ty,
taking with him all that was of value, and Seated himself in the Chief
City of <HI>Sigan,</HI> formerly the Court of the ancient Emperors. As a testimony of
the greatness of the Treasure that was carried out of <HI>Peking</HI> by this flying Ty∣rant
and his Followers, it is most certain, that seven or eight days were spent
wholly about loading of Wagons and Horses with the same; and yet they left
great store of Riches behind them, being surpris'd with fear at the sudden
coming of the <HI>Tartars.</HI> And thus were the infinite Riches of Gold, Silver, Iew∣els,
and costly Furniture, which sixteen Emperors of the Race of <HI>Taiminga</HI> had
been scraping together for the space of two hundred and eighty years, de∣stroy'd
and carried away: But he had not yet gotten into Harbor with his
Booty; for in his flight he was set upon by the <HI>Tartar,</HI> who recover'd from
him all that mass of Wealth which he had so traiterously stoln, and then mar∣ches
directly to the Imperial City of <HI>Peking,</HI> where the Inhabitants without
making any resistance set open the Gates, and gave them free entrance. And
thus at length, and after this manner, the <HI>Tartars</HI> became Masters of the whole
Empire of <HI>China,</HI> for which they had wag'd War, and fought so many bloody
Battels, for many Ages.</P>
<P>And although at this time, which was at the very first entrance, the <HI>Tartar</HI>
King <HI>Zungteus</HI> hapned to die, yet (which is very observable) they were not
thereby deterr'd from pursuing their design'd Conquest, but endeavor'd both
by Cunning and Policy to win the Hearts of the <HI>Chineses</HI> to affect them: for
though the Death of <HI>Zungteus</HI> gave a little check to their Affairs, yet through
his good Conduct while he liv'd, he had open'd such a Way for them, that they
easily saw in what Method to proceed for the gaining of the whole Empire.
He left behind him a Son who was but six years old, whom he declar'd his
Successor upon his Death-bed, enjoyning and conjuring his own Brothers pru∣dently
to Supervise and Govern the great Transactions of his Dominions, du∣ring
his Minority. The eldest of these Brothers had the greatest hand in the
<PB N="280" REF="156"/>
management of Affairs, which he most faithfully perform'd, effecting very
great things.</P>
<P>The Robber <HI>Licungzus</HI> being thus expell'd from his Usurpation, <HI>Usanguejus</HI>
endeavor'd to settle again in the Throne the next Heir of the Family and Race
of <HI>Taiminga;</HI> and with the more applause to effect it, he return'd his hearty
thanks to the <HI>Tartars</HI> for their faithful Assistance and Service, highly commend∣ing
their Courage shewn in driving out the Robber. After this Complement
perform'd, he proffer'd them the promis'd Presents, with request, that upon
receiving the same they would depart out of <HI>China,</HI> and for the future forget
the old Injuries, which they had now sufficiently reveng'd. But <HI>Usanguejus</HI> re∣ceiv'd
from them an Answer quite contrary to his expectation (which they had
long since in their thoughts fram'd) in these words:</P>
<P>It seems to us, although perhaps you shall judge it otherwise, as yet too soon for you to
part with us: <HI>China</HI> is not yet free from Armed Thieves, but still too much over-run with
them: You may easily imagine how great a Danger is still imminent over your Head, in re∣gard
the grand Robber <HI>Licungzus</HI> has setled himself in <HI>Sigan,</HI> the Chief City of the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Xensi.</HI> We have newly struck a fear and terror into him, but if he be once inform'd
of our Departure, he will soon re-invade the Throne with fresh Forces, and re-conquer the
whole; and then in regard of the great distance that will be between us, it will be impossi∣ble
for us to come timely enough to your assistance. Wherefore we judge it better for us, now
we are here, and before our Departure wholly to destroy these Plunderers; and then all be∣ing
in Peace and Quietness, your new chosen Prince for the future will be freed from any
new Troubles. As to your Promises, never think of them; for they are as well perform'd by
you as by us: But if your Intentions aim at the Publick Good, march with a potent Army
against <HI>Licungzus,</HI> and force him to leave that City, while we in the mean time will en∣deavor
to drive the other Robbers out of the Province of <HI>Xantung:</HI> And in the doing of
this, the whole Empire will be setled in Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Usanguejus,</HI> who either did not perceive the craftiness of the <HI>Tartar,</HI> of else
dissembled his knowledge on purpose at present not to provoke him, agreed at
last to his Proposal, and permitted him with his Forces to continue in <HI>China.</HI>
But the <HI>Tartars,</HI> in pursuance of their long intended Design, before they began
their March, at the request of <HI>Usanguejus,</HI> with their Army into <HI>China,</HI> to drive
out <HI>Licungzus,</HI> had sent into their own Country to raise a mighty Army with
all speed for the Conquest thereof; yet the better to palliate their Practice,
they us'd no Force against the <HI>Chineses,</HI> but kept them in hand with kind and
crafty Language, till they had got their Forces out of <HI>Tartary,</HI> who brought
with them their young King of six years old, call'd <HI>Xunteus;</HI> whereby they
first gave to understand that they aim'd at the Soveraignty: for no sooner was
their new-rais'd potent Army arriv'd, but they Proclaim'd this young Child
Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> gave him the Name of <HI>Xunchi,</HI> and Entitled his Race <HI>Taicung.</HI>
This Child (who yet lives and Reigns in <HI>China,</HI> and is now about twenty nine
years of Age) was plac'd with great Majesty in the ancient Imperial Throne,
through the good Conduct of his Uncles and near Relations, who prov'd very
faithful to him, being entrusted with the sole management of all Affairs, and
of so great Courage and Valour, civil, loving, and just Deportment, that they
won the Hearts of the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the very Day of this new Emperor's Instalment, there was sent in his
Name, by the advice of his Uncle, a Regiment or two of <HI>Tartars</HI> to <HI>Usanguejus,</HI>
<PB N="281" REF="156"/>
who was upon his March towards the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> to Fight with <HI>Licung∣zus,</HI>
with seal'd Letters, whereby he was Constituted <HI>King Pingsi,</HI> which signi∣fies
<HI>A Pacifier of the West;</HI> the Chief City <HI>Sigan</HI> order'd to be his Court,
and that he should pay some yearly Tribute in token of his Obedience.
This Policy did the Guardians of the young Emperor use, to satisfie and gain
<HI>Usanguejus</HI> to their Party; for they knew very well, that the Interest which he
had in <HI>China</HI> was sufficient to embroil the Affairs of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and involve
them in new Troubles.</P>
<P><HI>Usanguejus,</HI> who could never expect the like Preferment from the <HI>Chinese</HI> Em∣peror,
considering that all the last Emperor's Children were dead; and see∣ing
the <HI>Tartars</HI> upon their March against him with so great an Army, and that
himself was in no Condition to oppose them, relinquisheth the Trust which
he had thus long kept, receives the new Honor, and acknowledges the <HI>Tartar</HI>
for lawful Emperor of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>In this manner was he, who not long before for the Protection of the <HI>Chine∣ses</HI>
was sent with an Army to subdue the Rebels, now brought over to Fight
against his own Country-men, and with the <HI>Tartars</HI> help conquer the Empire;
and at last, with the assistance of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> having quite vanquish'd the Rob∣bers
in <HI>Xensi</HI> in a pitch'd Battel, went and setled his Court in the City of <HI>Sigan.</HI>
And thus did the <HI>Tartars</HI> prefer this Lord to great Honors and Dignities, who
had so often fought against them with great Success; but trusted him not
with any Military Employment, as well knowing what such an expert and va∣liant
Commander (well guarded with Soldiers, whose Love in time of Peace
he would purchase) is able to do, in case Fortune should afterwards become
froward, and begin to frown upon them.</P>
<P>What became of <HI>Licungzus</HI> is not certainly known, for his Forces were most
of them kill'd upon the Place by <HI>Usanguejus;</HI> and therefore some are of opini∣on
that he fell into the Slaughter amongst the rest, for he never was heard of
after that Battel.</P>
<P>The other <HI>Tartars</HI> who were sent towards <HI>Xantung</HI> and <HI>Peking,</HI> soon made
themselves Masters of them, meeting with little or no resistance: But yet the
greatest stop that was after put to the Arms of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> was the Law they
publish'd, whereby the <HI>Chineses</HI> were commanded to wear their Hair after the
<HI>Tartar</HI> fashion. This did very much alienate their Affections from the <HI>Tartars;</HI>
for they of <HI>China</HI> take great pride in their Hair, and therefore did fight more va∣liantly
to defend that, than for the Safety and Preservation of the Empire or
Emperor; insomuch that thousands (who perhaps otherwise would have sub∣mitted
peaceably) chose rather to lose their Heads than their Tresses.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the <HI>Tartars</HI> were so successful in their War, that in the space of
twelve Months they Conquer'd four Northern Provinces, <HI>viz. Peking, Xansi,
Xensi,</HI> and <HI>Xantung;</HI> but for the rest they us'd another means, which got them
more than the Sword, and indeed was a good piece of Policy; for they made
no manner of alteration in the Government wheresoever they came, but suf∣fer'd
the Conduct and Direction of all Civil Affairs, both in City and Coun∣try,
to continue in the Hands of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Philosophers, wherein it was setled
before: And this one thing brought the <HI>Tartar</HI> into such favor and esteem
with the <HI>Chineses,</HI> that they readily submitted themselves to their Command;
only herein consisted all the Marks of their Vassalage, that the Conquerors re∣serv'd
to themselves the sole management of all Martial Affairs; nevertheless,
such <HI>Chinese</HI> Commanders as they had found faithful, were still employ'd by
<PB N="282" REF="157"/>
them; and even in the Imperial City it self, the same Order, as to the Civil
Government, was observ'd, only one half of the Iudges were <HI>Tartars,</HI> and the
other <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the Governors and Commanders of the Southern Provin∣ces
(where the first Disturbance of the Robbers began) having information
of the Straits the Emperor was reduc'd to, rais'd a great Army, and were alrea∣dy
upon their March to his Rescue; but when they were certifi'd of his Death,
and the taking of the City, they immediately return'd with all their Forces;
and not long after understood that the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who by the means of <HI>Usanguejus</HI>
were call'd in as Aids, had possessed themselves of the whole Empire, and were
become absolute Masters thereof; the very thoughts of which much perplexed
their Spirits.</P>
<P>And this spread likewise a great consternation among all the People, even
as far as <HI>Nanking,</HI> the Chief City of the Province of the same Name, so that they
did not know what to advise or do; but at last the General took courage, and
set up, after a long serious Consultation, one of the Family of <HI>Taiminga,</HI> being
the next Heir to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Crown, as Grandchild of the Emperor <HI>Vanlieus,</HI> and
Cousin of the last Emperor <HI>Zungchinius,</HI> who heretofore kept his Court in the
Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> but for fear of the Robbers remov'd to <HI>Nanking;</HI> where,
upon his Arrival, the Inhabitants in great Pomp and State set the Crown upon
his Head, and Proclaim'd him Emperor by the Name of <HI>Hunquang,</HI> in hopes to
effect great matters by him, in regard he was a valiant Prince. He was no
sooner seated in his Throne, but he sent an Ambassador to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> to de∣mand
a Peace upon Terms of leaving all the Northern Provinces to them
which they had taken. But the <HI>Tartars</HI> well understanding, that the scope of
this Embassy was only intended to gain time till the <HI>Chineses</HI> could recruit
themselves with Men and Money, rejected his Offers, and return'd him an∣swer,
<HI>That they would either have the whole Country, or no part of it, being resolv'd not
to lay down their Arms till they had accomplish'd what they had undertaken.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, whilst the Ambassador was upon his return home, and
that both Parties prepar'd for the War, there appear'd in <HI>Nanking</HI> a Youth, who
gave himself out for the eldest Son of the Emperor <HI>Zungchinius,</HI> and endea∣vor'd
to confirm it with some peculiar remarks of Truth: And that which
seem'd to make a great addition to the credit of this Report, was, that several
<HI>Gelubdens,</HI> and others who had been conversant in the Emperor's Court, pre∣tended
to know him. But <HI>Hunquang,</HI> who had tasted the sweetness of Govern∣ment,
and in some measure setled himself in the Throne, refus'd to own him
for the lawful Son of <HI>Zungchinius,</HI> but caus'd him to be Apprehended as an Im∣postor,
with an Intention to put him to death: And in this cruel Resolution
he persisted, notwithstanding that all the Commanders and Governors op∣pos'd
him, and extremely hated and maligned him for it; for they gave credit
to the Saying of the Youth.</P>
<P>This Business occasion'd so much and so long trouble among the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
that the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the interim took the opportunity to subject the Province of
<HI>Nanking,</HI> wherein they found little or no opposition, in regard the <HI>Chinese</HI> Com∣manders
were divided among themselves to that heighth of malice, that some
refus'd to hinder the Progress of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> on purpose to work a Prejudice to
the new Emperor: Whereupon they came immediately to <HI>Hoaigan,</HI> the first
Chief City of the same Province, and without making any stop or delay, they
took in the East side of the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> and Ferried over the same in Boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
<PB N="283" REF="157"/>
though the other side thereof was well lin'd with <HI>Chinese</HI> Soldiers; who no
sooner perceiv'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> in earnest to put themselves aboard for Passage,
but they left their Station and fled like so many Sheep pursu'd by Wolves.
The <HI>Tartars</HI> thus got over (which might have been easily prevented, if the
Guards appointed for defence of the Banks had shewn but the least Courage)
fell with their whole Army into the said Province, and took and carried away
whatsoever they found upon the North side of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> no Place be∣ing
able to withstand them, only the rich and famous City of <HI>Iangcheu</HI> made
some considerable Resistance, and kill'd many of the <HI>Tartars</HI> in their Sallies,
amongst whom was a Son of one of their Petty Kings. This City was Com∣manded
by one <HI>Zuus Colaus,</HI> plac'd there by the new Emperor, to whom he
prov'd very faithful; for he defended the Place, wherein was a strong Garri∣son,
to the very last; yet having endur'd a long and cruel Siege, and seeing
no likelihood of Relief (the Provisions also being all spent) he was forc'd to
deliver it up to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who put all, as well the Soldiers as Inhabitants,
to the Sword, plunder'd the City, and afterwards set it on fire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> hereupon increas'd very much in Power and Authority, so that
many of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Commanders went over to them, and were either conti∣nu'd
in their present Employment, or else preferr'd to better. Which friendly
and favorable treating such Officers and Cities as came voluntarily and with∣out
force over to them, and on the other hand inflicting such great severity and
cruelty on such as made opposition, was the cause that most of the Places situ∣ate
on the North side of the River <HI>Kiang</HI> submitted themselves, to avoid the
punishment and misusage which they should otherwise undergo by making
opposition.</P>
<P>Having subdu'd these Places, the next thing they undertook was against the
City of <HI>Nanking,</HI> formerly the Court of the ancient Emperors, a stately City
lying upon the South side of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> which separates the whole Em∣pire
of <HI>China</HI> into the Southern and Northern Divisions, and runs quite through
the middle of this Province: And the better to accomplish their Design, and
to get the new Emperor into their Hands, whom they knew was in this Place,
the <HI>Tartars</HI> provided beforehand great numbers of Boats, to transport them
over the River: But the <HI>Chinese</HI> having likewise a considerable Fleet under the
Command of the valiant Prince <HI>Hoangchoang,</HI> endeavor'd to hinder their Pas∣sage.
The <HI>Tartars</HI> in their Boats fell upon the <HI>Chinese</HI> Fleet with great fury,
which was as manfully receiv'd and maintain'd the Fight; so that both sides
fought valiantly: but at last the <HI>Tartars</HI> were vanquish'd and totally routed,
with a very great slaughter of their Men. But Fortune, never constant but in
her inconstancy, did not long favor this brave General; for a while after he
was most treacherously kill'd by one of his Commanders, a Traytor who had
long before been hir'd by the Enemy to perpetrate this Villany, one <HI>Thienus,</HI> a
Native of the Province of <HI>Leaotung,</HI> who from his very Childhood had serv'd
amongst the <HI>Chineses.</HI> And as this Act in it self was direful, so the Events that
follow'd had a like miserable issue; for through the unfortunate Death of
this excellent Commander, the <HI>Chinese</HI> Affairs began infinitely to decline, and
the whole Empire became a Prey to the <HI>Tartars</HI> in a short time after.</P>
<P>The Traytor <HI>Thienus</HI> not satisfi'd in having committed this foul Action,
but resolving to add Villany to Villany, flies with his Men into <HI>Nanking,</HI> un∣der
colour of performing his Duty as a faithful Officer, but in truth with hopes
to effect some other Treason, as he afterwards did; for the Emperor hearing
<PB N="284" REF="158"/>
of the Death of the late General, was perswaded by this <HI>Thienus</HI> to leave the
City. As soon as the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who were got over the River with their Army,
understood that the Emperor was fled, they sent great Parties in pursuit of
him, whom the Traytor (being present) seeing approach, commanded his Men
to seize him, and then deliver'd him up to the <HI>Tartars</HI> in <HI>Iuly 1645.</HI> who now
having obtain'd what they aim'd at, did not presently put him to death, but
carried him about in Triumph, and at length brought him under the Walls of
the Chief City of <HI>Peking,</HI> there Strangled him with a Bow-string: which man∣ner
of Death is held in great esteem amongst the <HI>Tartars.</HI> And thus the Empe∣ror
<HI>Hungquang</HI> came to his End, before he had Reigned a compleat Year.
Then they caus'd the Youth who pretended himself to be the Son of <HI>Zungchi∣nius,</HI>
and whom they found in Prison, to be also Strangled; and not only
these, but all others they could meet with of the Royal Race: for it is a Cu∣stom
through all <HI>Asia,</HI> that when a Kingdom is taken from another, all the
Kindred of that King are put to death by the Conqueror.</P>
<P>These things thus brought to pass, the <HI>Tartar</HI> Army fell upon the Chief
City of <HI>Nanking,</HI> and took the same without any resistance, or so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Blow given, and out of an innate hatred turn'd the Imperial Palace (the anci∣ent
Seat of the Emperor's Courts) and also their Tombs and Sepulchres into
a heap of Stones, yet never offer'd any hurt to the Inhabitants Houses. March∣ing
thence, they reduc'd all the other Cities of this Province without any op∣position,
they freely submitting to avoid their Cruelty.</P>
<P>This Province thus setled, part of their Army was sent for <HI>Hangcheu,</HI> the
first Chief City of the Dominion of <HI>Chekiang;</HI> and the other part march'd
over the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> to subdue the Southern Countries, as <HI>Kiangsi, Huquang,</HI>
and <HI>Quantung.</HI> About this City was got together the remainder of the <HI>Chinese</HI>
Army that had sav'd themselves by flight, where they were about to chuse a
new Emperor call'd <HI>Louangus,</HI> of the Race of <HI>Taiminga:</HI> But he earnestly re∣fus'd
to take upon him that Dignity, being contented with the Kingly Title,
saying, That when the <HI>Tartars</HI> were beaten and driven out of <HI>China,</HI> then he
would accept of it. His Reign had not continu'd three days, but he saw the
<HI>Tartars</HI> coming to Fight with him, and to drive him out of the Kingdom:
but he not frighted therewith, being a valiant Prince, encourag'd his Men to
make a manly Resistance; which they not only promis'd, but faithfully per∣form'd,
behaving themselves with great Valour and Fidelity, till they were
not able to hold out any longer, being overpower'd by Hunger. Whereupon
<HI>Louangus,</HI> who had not his Fellow amongst the <HI>Chineses</HI> for Civility, and a pas∣sionate
Affection to his Subjects, went to the Walls, and entreated the <HI>Tartar</HI>
General upon his Knees, that if he would forgive the City and Inhabitants,
he should do with him what he would; for he would willingly offer up him∣self
a Sacrifice for his Subjects safety. Which said, he forthwith deliver'd him∣self
freely over to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who by that means became Masters of the City;
yet being inrag'd by their resistance, they neither had compassion on the Soldi∣ers
nor Inhabitants, but put all to the Sword who could not save themselves
by flight.</P>
<P>After this the Enemy took the City of <HI>Hangcheu</HI> without doing any preju∣dice
to the Inhabitants thereof: And from thence, by the help of Boats pas∣sing
the River <HI>Cienthang,</HI> they came before <HI>Xaoking,</HI> the most compleat and uni∣form
City of all <HI>China,</HI> which presently submitted to their Arms without ma∣king
the least resistance. And without doubt they had taken all the other
<PB N="285" REF="158"/>
Southern Cities without any opposition, had they not set forth an Edict, there∣by
commanding every Person to cut his Hair after the <HI>Tartar</HI> fashion; upon
the first hearing of which the <HI>Chinese</HI> Commanders and Inhabitants, who have
as much love for their Hair as their Country, began to flie to their Arms, with
a resolution to fight for their Hair; which they did with such Valour and
Courage, that they beat the <HI>Tartars</HI> out of the City of <HI>Xaoking,</HI> forcing them
to flie over the River with the loss of many of their Men: And doubtless if at
this time they had pursu'd, they might have regain'd those Places they had lost;
but being satisfi'd in their Minds that they had thus preserv'd their Hair, they
ceased to pursue their Victory, only making resistance on the South side of the
River, where they so fortifi'd themselves with the raising Bulwarks and Forts,
that the <HI>Tartar</HI> desisted for a whole Year, without making any considerable
Attempt.</P>
<P>The People having unfortunately lost their faithful, and too zealously lo∣ving
Prince <HI>Louangus,</HI> endeavor'd to make another Head over them, and to
create one <HI>Lu</HI> (of the Family of <HI>Taiminga)</HI> Emperor; but he likewise refus'd
the Imperial Title, only taking upon him that of <HI>Restorer of the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> finding their Armies much weakned by the great numbers of
Men they had lost in several Battels, so that they were not in a Condition to
effect any considerable Design, sent for fresh Men from <HI>Peking</HI> to re-inforce
their Troops, wherewith they endeavor'd to pass the River <HI>Cienthang;</HI> but not∣withstanding
all the Force and Policy they could use, were not able to accom∣plish
it. And thus the <HI>Chineses</HI> began by degrees to recover their lost Country,
which had undoubtedly had very prosperously succeeded, if an unfortunate
Accident had not hapned in the mean time, which prevented it; the Story
thus:</P>
<P>The Soldiery and Governors of the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> that were fled out
of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> had with them one of the Race of <HI>Taiminga,</HI> whom they Proclaim'd
Emperor in the same Province, which borders upon that of <HI>Chekiang.</HI> This
Prince being of a lofty and ambitious Nature, and not being able to keep him∣self
within Bounds, sent some to perswade King <HI>Lu</HI> to renounce his Sove∣reignty,
to lay down his Government, and quit the Title of <HI>Restorer of the
Kingdom;</HI> alledging, That he had but few Cities, and was not so near allied
to the former Emperor as himself. <HI>Lu</HI> argued on the other hand, That he had
the Priority of Title by the Election and Submission of the Subjects, and his
Conquests sufficiently shew'd the Love he bore, and the Service he had done
his Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> were not a little overjoy'd at these Divisions, which gave them
an opportunity to work their Ends, by reducing the whole Empire under their
Power; for it was impossible to reconcile the Differences of the two new
Kings, so as they might joyn their Forces against the <HI>Tartar,</HI> each of them still
endeavoring what he could the ruine of the other. And in regard <HI>Lu</HI> had but
eight Cities under his Command, which were not able to maintain an Army
sufficient to grapple with the <HI>Tartar,</HI> he only stood upon the defensive part, and
never durst venture over the River; the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the mean time laboring
with their utmost endeavor to get over the River, but with Ships they durst
not attempt, understanding very well that <HI>Lu</HI> had sufficient to oppose; not∣withstanding
which, Fortune too much favoring the <HI>Tartars</HI> in their Underta∣king,
it hapned this Year to be a very hot and dry Summer, so that the River
on the South-side was thereby grown shallow, of which they, by the infor∣mation
<PB N="286" REF="159"/>
of some treacherous <HI>Chineses,</HI> having intelligence, found out a fordable
place for their Horse, whereof a few only being got over, gave presently sud∣den
Alarm to the Country, that so the Inhabitants thereof fled and left all to
save their Lives: <HI>Lu</HI> himself was so surpris'd at the news, that he abandon'd
the City <HI>Xaoking,</HI> and fled into the Island <HI>Cheuxan,</HI> situated over against <HI>Ningpo,</HI>
the ninth Chief City of the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> where he liv'd several years
after.</P>
<P>This Island, never inhabited before but by a company of poor Fishermen
and Peasants, is now, through the concourse of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> fled thither to aid
this <HI>Lu,</HI> as the Protector of their Hair, grown to be so great and powerful a
Kingdom, that there was reckon'd in the same seventy two Cities. The <HI>Chine∣ses</HI>
and their Protector being thus fled, the <HI>Tartars</HI> conquer'd all the rest of the
Cities of the Province, without meeting with any opposition; only the City of
<HI>Kinhoa,</HI> whereof the <HI>Tutang</HI> was Governor, did withstand for some Months
their victorious Arms; for the Governor was resolv'd to quit himself with
Courage for the Honor of his Country: but notwithstanding all his Valour
and Resolution, at last the <HI>Tartars</HI> having planted some great Guns before the
City, they made a large Breach in the Walls, at which they enter'd, and put
all to Fire and Sword, insomuch that they left not one House standing. The
Governor himself, to prevent falling into the Hands of the Enemy, caus'd
himself and his Family to be blown up with Power in his Palace.</P>
<P>One of the same three Armies was already upon its March, in order to the
subduing the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> but was in no small trouble where to begin
the same to their own least prejudice, in regard of the hinderance given to
them by the steep Hills and Mountains which lie at the entrance into this Pro∣vince;
for between <HI>Fokien</HI> and the Provinces of <HI>Quantung, Kiangsi,</HI> and <HI>Chekiang,</HI>
lies a row of inaccessible Rocks and Mountains, which divide it from the other
three, and to get over the same is not only a troublesom, but tedious Iourney
of three days; so that it would have been a very easie matter to the <HI>Chineses</HI> to
have hinder'd at least, if not stopp'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> in their March through these
Mountains, if they had guarded the same but with a few Peasants; but they
were so frighted and amaz'd at the coming of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that they fled out of
the Mountains upon their first approach, so that at last, though with infinite
trouble, they got over them into <HI>Fokien,</HI> which they subdu'd in a short time;
and for that the Inhabitants made little or no opposition, the <HI>Tartars</HI> were fa∣vorable
unto them. This done, and having re-inforc'd their Army, they
march'd to the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> through those of <HI>Huquang</HI> and <HI>Kiangsi;</HI>
whither being come, and attaquing the Chief City thereof, they soon laid it
wholly waste, because it had made some opposition against them. Mov'd by
the terror of whose Example, the rest of the Cities not daring to stand out,
submitted at first Summons. These Provinces thus brought under, an Army
was sent for <HI>Peking,</HI> with Orders to settle in each City a strong Garrison, and
Magistrates over both Civil and Military Affairs, in the Name of the <HI>Tartar</HI>
Emperor.</P>
<P>But there are some that give another reason how it came to pass that the
<HI>Tartars</HI> happen'd to Master the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> with so little trouble.</P>
<P>About this time there appear'd a famous Pyrate, a Native of <HI>Fokien,</HI> by
Name <HI>Chinchilung,</HI> but Foreiners call him <HI>Iquon:</HI> This Person in his Youth
well known to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> being but of mean Extraction, ser∣ved
the <HI>Portugueses</HI> first of all in <HI>Maccao,</HI> in the Quality of a Servant, and after∣wards
<PB N="287" REF="159"/>
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Island of <HI>Formosa;</HI> but being of an aspiring and
ambitious Mind, could not brook to live under so much Subjection; where∣fore
retiring from them, by specious Pretences, he drew in a great many inno∣cent
Creatures to take part with him, by whose help, and with a few Ships he
had made shift to get together, he turn'd Pyrate; in which way after a while
having made some considerable Gain, he increas'd very much in Shipping, at
last growing so strong therein, that he far exceeded the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor both
in Naval Forces and Wealth; for he drew the whole Trade of <HI>India</HI> to himself,
Trafficking with the <HI>Spaniard</HI> upon the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, with the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
upon <HI>Formosa</HI> and in <HI>New Batavia,</HI> and with the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in <HI>Maccao.</HI> He drove
likewise a very great Trade with those of <HI>Iapan,</HI> and other Kingdoms and
Islands situate in the great <HI>Indian</HI> Sea; so that in truth he alone was able to
Export by his Power, Men, and Ships, the <HI>Chinese</HI> Commodities out of that
Empire, and to Import back into the same the Commodities of <HI>Europe:</HI> Of
which the Emperor taking notice, after a long War that had been between them,
at length a Peace was concluded, by which in a small time he grew so very po∣tent
in Shipping, that he was able to set forth a Fleet of three thousand Ships.</P>
<P>And now Success imping the Wings of this Pyrat's ambitious Thoughts,
he was not contented with this petty Greatness, but aspir'd at the Crown;
but in regard he knew it would be impossible for him to effect any thing so
long as any of the Race of <HI>Taiminga</HI> was remaining (for neither the Commo∣nalty
nor Soldiery shew'd any Respect towards him) he conceiv'd some hopes,
that with the help of the <HI>Tartars</HI> it would not be hard for him to extirpate that
Family, and so make the way easie to his own Advancement: Wherefore he
resolv'd under the Cloke of Vertue (and by that Delusion to draw the greater
number to follow him) to march against the <HI>Tartar</HI> as the common Enemy.
And undoubtedly, had not this Treason been foreseen, under that Pretence all
the <HI>Chineses</HI> would have joyn'd with him, and look'd upon him as the Restorer
of their Country. But notwithstanding this fair Pretext, in the mean time he
Contracts under-hand a Confederacy with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> promising to give them
the best Assistance he was able, as indeed it doth appear he did by the sequel of
the Story; for this Traytor <HI>Iquon,</HI> when the <HI>Tartars</HI> fell into <HI>Fokien,</HI> was made
by <HI>Lunguvus</HI> General of his whole Army; by which means having gotten the
Power into his Hands, he suffer'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> unresisted to come into the same;
so that 'tis no wonder why the <HI>Tartars</HI> afterwards conferr'd upon him the
Royal Dignity, and gave him the Title of <HI>King Pingnan,</HI> which signifies <HI>One
that Settles the West in Peace.</HI> Yet notwithstanding this Service by him done to
them, they did but temporize to lull him into security, being jealous of his
great Force by Sea, and suspecting that he aspir'd after the Royal Diadem.
Now true and most certain it is, although the <HI>Tartars</HI> knew this very well, yet
never durst they act any thing against him with Force, but always Courted
him, and made him believe that they would give him the Government of the
Provinces of <HI>Fokien</HI> and <HI>Quantung. Iquon</HI> finding himself in such high esteem
among the <HI>Tartars,</HI> doubted not at all but that he should at least keep the Go∣vernment
of the Southern Provinces: But see the inconstancy of humane Af∣fairs,
for he was very much deceiv'd in his expectation, and clearly out-witted;
for when the <HI>Tartar</HI> Vice-Roy of the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> had resolv'd to go for
<HI>Peking,</HI> it is a Custom for all the Commanders to come and take leave of him,
and to wish him a good Iourney; according to which <HI>Iquon,</HI> who suspected
no mischief towards him, concluded in himself to do the like Honor to this
<PB N="288" REF="160"/>
Petty King: and thereupon departing from his Fleet, which he left in the
Harbor of the Chief City of <HI>Focheu,</HI> he went thither and joyn'd with the Com∣pany
to conduct the King some part of his Way; but when he came to take
leave, the King earnestly desir'd him to bear him company quite through to
<HI>Peking,</HI> promising to do him great Honor upon his arrival there for such his
Favor. <HI>Iquon</HI> now too late began to grow jealous, endeavoring by all the most
plausible Allegations imaginable to excuse himself, but the King would ad∣mit
of no Denial. And thus this famous Pyrate was easily taken in a Net by
subtilty, who was not to be medled with, or overcome by Force of Arms; for
he was no sooner arriv'd at <HI>Peking,</HI> but he was cast into Prison, where he lay
sometime in Captivity, and was afterwards not publickly Executed, but made
away by Poyson. His Sons and Brothers, when they heard of his Imprison∣ment,
quickly went aboard their Fleet, wherewith since that time they have
done very great Damage, and still continue their Pyracies to this day.</P>
<P>In the interim the other Army, which was got through the Island Quarters
into
<HI>Quantung,</HI> was from thence upon their March for the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI>
to reduce the same likewise under their Power. But in this Undertaking their
Forces were often worsted by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who made the greatest opposition
where it was least expected.</P>
<P>At that time one <HI>Khiu Thomas</HI> (who was Baptiz'd by the <HI>Iesuits,</HI> and had
embrac'd the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion) was Vice-Roy of the same Province, and one
<HI>Ching Lucus</HI> was General over the Militia: These two Warriors and valiant
Commanders having gotten together a very great Army, fell so furiously upon
the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that they not only drove them out of the Field, but also re-took
such Places as they had won toward the West.</P>
<P>Prosperity seeming thus to begin to smile, these valiant <HI>Chineses,</HI> willing to
shew they were not ambitious, made one <HI>Iunglieus</HI> Emperor, one of the Family
of <HI>Taiminga,</HI> being a Grandchild of the Emperor <HI>Vanlieus:</HI> He kept his Court
at first in <HI>Queilin,</HI> the principal Chief City of the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> hoping
thereby to draw other <HI>Chineses</HI> to take up Arms against the <HI>Tartar:</HI> But soon
after he went and remov'd his Court to the famous City of <HI>Chatting</HI> in the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Quantung,</HI> where continuing, he got the better of the <HI>Tartars</HI> in several
Battels. But the ill Fate of the Empire diverted his good Fortune, so that he
did not continue successful any long time, but was quickly overcome and dri∣ven
out of <HI>Quangsi</HI> and <HI>Quantung,</HI> and from thence constrain'd to flie to the Fron∣tiers
of <HI>Tungking.</HI></P>
<P>No sooner was the Vice-Roy of <HI>Fokien</HI> upon his Iourney to <HI>Peking</HI> with <HI>Iquon,</HI>
but it seem'd as if the People of that Province and <HI>Quangsi</HI> had taken fresh Cou∣rage,
there hapning a very great and sudden alteration in the <HI>Tartar</HI> Affairs;
for one <HI>Vangus</HI> a Priest, who had formerly been a Commander in the Army, set
the whole Country in an uprore, and having rais'd a great number of Men,
and modell'd them into an Army, he went and took the City of <HI>Kienning</HI> with
several other Places, and put all the <HI>Tartars</HI> therein to the Sword; which good
Success immediately caus'd such <HI>Chineses</HI> as had formerly fled into the Moun∣tains
for safety, to come down and joyn with him, to help to recover their
Country. At the same time one <HI>Changus</HI> by Name, and a <HI>Tartar</HI> born, being
Vice-Roy of two Provinces, had the Command likewise of the Province of
<HI>Chekiang;</HI> who hearing of the Insurrection in <HI>Fokien,</HI> march'd immediately thi∣ther
with his Army, and finding no opposition at the mouth of the Mountains,
where he suppos'd the <HI>Chineses</HI> would have block'd up his Passage, which a few
<PB N="289" REF="160"/>
Forces would easily have done, he cries out with a loud voice, <HI>The Day is my
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and the Rebels are fled.</HI> So marching over the Mountains without any op∣position,
he lays Siege immediately to the City of <HI>Kienning,</HI> into which the
Priest <HI>Vangus</HI> was retreated with most of his Army. The City endur'd a long
Siege for several Months, and was of such Strength, that it could not be taken
by Storm, which had been often attempted by the Besiegers, to their great da∣mage
and loss of Men; wherefore at last they resolv'd to get it by Fa∣mine,
rather than lose any more Men by Storming, whereby he had already
very much weakned his Army; but that being recruited with fresh Men from
<HI>Peking,</HI> and having made a considerable Breach in the Wall by their Ordnance,
they resolv'd to Storm it once more, and the Success answer'd their Desire;
for the Commanders within the Place being divided among themselves, there
was not such care taken as ought to have been for the resisting of the Assault,
by which means the Besiegers getting in at the Breach, immediately cut out
their Way and put all to the Sword, neither Man, Woman, nor Child excepted,
so that <HI>(dirum dictu)</HI> there were kill'd in and before this City above three hun∣dred
thousand People, and the City it self afterwards totally destroy'd, and not
one Stone left standing upon another. After the dreadful destruction of this
City, the whole Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> submitted to their Power, and for the fu∣ture
none but <HI>Tartars</HI> were made Commanders over the Militia, and Gover∣nors
of Cities: But notwithstanding all this great and prudent foresight
which was us'd, the <HI>Tartars</HI> were not able to keep all quiet; for it hapned that
the Governor of the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> nam'd <HI>Kinus,</HI> revolted and made new
work for their Arms; the occasion whereof is said to be upon some difference
which hapned between <HI>Kinus</HI> and the other who supervis'd the Civil Affairs
of the same Province; the manner thus: They being invited to an Enter∣tainment
where a Play was Acted during the Meal, as the Custom is in <HI>China,</HI>
and the Players Dress'd in <HI>Chinese</HI> Habits, and not after the fashion of the <HI>Tar∣tars;
Kinus</HI> (who was born in the Province of <HI>Leaotung,</HI> where they very much
resemble the <HI>Tartars</HI> in their Customs and Manners, and therefore put a very
great confidence in the Inhabitants) minding the same, said to the other Go∣vernor,
<HI>Doth not this Habit shew much better than the</HI> Tartar <HI>Fashion?</HI> The other
answer'd nothing at present, yet thought himself oblig'd in Duty to acquaint
the Emperor by Letter with this Saying; for he fancied that by these words
<HI>Kinus</HI> was designing some Novelty in his Head, to the disturbance of the Pub∣lick
Peace, and imagining he bore the greatest affection to those whose Habit
he chiefly commended: <HI>Kinus,</HI> who wanted neither Courage nor Ingenuity,
had Brib'd the Secretary of this Governor, by whom he was inform'd from
time to time of all was writ to the Emperor against him; and being ac∣quainted
with the Contents of the aforesaid Letter, he went immediately with
a Company of Soldiers into the Governor's Court, and there kill'd him on a
sudden before he was aware. Having done this, he falls off from the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
with the whole Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> and declares for the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor <HI>Iung∣lieus,</HI>
at which the Inhabitants were not a little overjoy'd; only the City of
<HI>Cancheu,</HI> which was Commanded and Govern'd by a very faithful <HI>Tartar,</HI> was
not to be brought over to countenance the Revolt, which hapned very well
for the <HI>Tartar;</HI> for the standing out of this single Place alone was of such con∣sequence,
that the <HI>Tartars</HI> (as I shall relate hereafter) did victoriously recover
the whole Province of <HI>Kiangsi</HI> and <HI>Quantung,</HI> and brought them once more un∣der
Subjection.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="161"/>The General of the Militia in the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> call'd <HI>Licungzus,</HI>
was likewise at the same time revolted from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and had deliver'd up
that part of the Country to the Emperor <HI>Iunglieus,</HI> whom also the Southern
Part own'd for the Emperor of <HI>China.</HI> And for the better prosecution of the
Design against the <HI>Tartars,</HI> the General <HI>Licungzus</HI> endeavor'd to joyn his Forces
with those of <HI>Kinus,</HI> to fall both together at one and the same time upon
them, and drive them out of the Kingdom; which undoubtedly had taken
effect accordingly, had not the resistance of the Governor of the City <HI>Cancheu</HI>
hindred them: for the same Governor was no sooner inform'd that <HI>Licungzus</HI>
was likewise revolted from the <HI>Tartar,</HI> and upon his March with his Army,
but he sends to him this deceitful and politick Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Till now I would never submit to <HI>Kinus,</HI> because I could never believe that he would be
able to withstand the Forces of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> but seeing that you, most valiant Prince, also
turn your Arms against him, I cannot conceive what Safety and Protection I can hencefor∣ward
expect from him; therefore I hold my self oblig'd to follow your Standard, and you
shall no sooner appear with your Forces before this City, but I will deliver it up into your
Hands.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>After the Governor had dispatch'd away an Express with this Letter, he
sent another to the General of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who lay with his Forces in the next
Province to <HI>Fokien,</HI> to assist him with what Strength he could well spare; which
were sent, and by him convey'd into the City by Night, so that no notice
could be taken of his Design. <HI>Licungzus</HI> in the mean while not suspecting any
Treachery intended against him, boldly, but carelesly, went up to the City,
and found the Gates thereof standing open, so that without delay he entred,
and immediately found himself assaulted on all sides by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who lay in
Ambuscade waiting for his coming, and was forc'd to retreat with great loss:
<HI>Licungzus</HI> himself, as is suppos'd, was kill'd in the Fight, because he was never
heard of afterwards.</P>
<P>This Defeat brought the Affairs of the Emperor <HI>Iunglieus</HI> into great disor∣der
and confusion, yet nevertheless <HI>Kinus</HI> won afterwards several Battels for
him against the <HI>Tartars;</HI> and when he heard of the Defeat of <HI>Licungzus,</HI> went
himself and Beleaguer'd the City of <HI>Cancheu;</HI> but he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot continu'd the
Siege many days, before there was advice brought him of a new Army of <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
sent from <HI>Peking</HI> to reduce the Province of <HI>Kiangsi;</HI> insomuch that <HI>Kinus</HI>
fearing to fall into a Noose, broke up his Siege, and march'd toward the Nor∣thern
parts of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> to defend and preserve the same from being overcome
by the <HI>Tartars.</HI> At first indeed he fought with good success; but at last finding
himself over-power'd, he retreated for safety to the Chief City of <HI>Nanchang;</HI>
which having suffer'd all the miseries of a tedious Siege, was at last taken; but
<HI>Kinus</HI> escap'd alive out of it, and got to the Mountains, as has been already re∣lated
at large. This City thus subdu'd, they were Masters of the whole Pro∣vince,
and put new Garrisons into most of the Cities and Places of Concern,
and so march'd back with their Army in triumph to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>While these Transactions were on foot, very great Preparations for War
had been making in <HI>Peking,</HI> so that three new Armies were rais'd to reduce the
Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> and others which still held forth, and took part with <HI>Iung∣lieus.</HI>
Whereupon the Guardian and Uncle of the <HI>Grand Tartar Cham,</HI> call'd
<HI>Xunchi,</HI> who now Reigns in <HI>China,</HI> the better to reduce the Southern Provin∣ces
<PB N="291" REF="161"/>
into Subjection, and rectifie their Disorder, resolv'd to appoint some Vice-Roys
over those Provinces, who being <HI>Tartars</HI> by Nation should have absolute
Power, only with Obligation to pay Tribute yearly to the Emperor. This
Counsel was immediately put in Execution, and in the Year 1649. (when the
Province of <HI>Kiangsi</HI> was full of uprore) three Vice-Roys were sent with three
Armies, which consisted for the most part of <HI>Tartars,</HI> from <HI>Peking;</HI> the one
was made Vice-Roy of <HI>Fokien,</HI> the other of <HI>Quantung,</HI> and the third of
<HI>Quangsi,</HI> with express Order to endeavor jointly the subduing, reducing, and
total conquering of <HI>Quantung,</HI> and to drive the Emperor <HI>Iunglieus</HI> out of the
whole Empire.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have only spoken of what hapned in the Southern Provinces
concerning the <HI>Chineses</HI> Revolts; we shall now proceed to give an Account
how Affairs went in the Northern Provinces; by which it will appear with
how much Zeal the <HI>Chineses</HI> were concern'd for their Liberties and the Welfare
of their Country; for the Commanders in Chief over the Northern Provin∣ces
as well those that had the Power over the Civil as Military Affairs, plotted
together which way they should drive out the <HI>Tartars:</HI> Whereupon they rai∣sed
as many Forces as they could privately, and chose one <HI>Hous</HI> to be their Ge∣neral;
who coming to the Army, which he found to consist of about twenty
five thousand Men, march'd therewith from among the Mountains into the
Plain Country; whereupon many of the Natives perceiving his Strength,
came in to him, and several Cities set open their Gates and receiv'd him and
his Army, only <HI>Xigan,</HI> the first Chief City of <HI>Xensi,</HI> withstood him, being in
truth compell'd thereto, having a strong Garrison of <HI>Tartars</HI> in it; besides, the
Governor thereof having observ'd that the <HI>Chineses</HI> made no resistance, but ra∣ther
freely submitted to him, and fearing lest the Citizens might carry on
some private Design against him, resolv'd to put to Death all the <HI>Chineses</HI> with∣in
the City; which he had undoubtedly put in execution, had he not been dis∣suaded
from it by one of the Vice-Roys; yet still jealous of them, and wil∣ling
to prevent any Conspiracy by them, he forbad upon pain of Death, that
any more than two <HI>Chineses</HI> should converse together at a time, and that none
should walk the Streets in the Night, nor keep any Arms in their Houses.</P>
<P>Not yet satisfi'd with all this Care, but to be throughly inform'd of the For∣ces
of <HI>Hous,</HI> he sends out Spies to bring him intelligence of the Strength and
Posture of the Enemies; at last <HI>Hous</HI> comes with his Army, (which now in∣creas'd
with the conflux of Country People that shelter'd themselves there,
amounted at least to the number of three hundred thousand) and Besieg'd <HI>Xi∣gan,</HI>
which is at least three Miles in compass. When the <HI>Tartar</HI> Governor saw
from the Walls such a vast number of Men, he stood amaz'd, as supposing
they had been all Soldiers, which caus'd him again to pass a second cruel Re∣solution,
to make away all the <HI>Chinese</HI> Inhabitants within the City, to prevent
any Correspondence between them and <HI>Hous;</HI> but finding that those that
serv'd him, and were sent out to fight, behav'd themselves valiantly, he for∣bore
to execute such a barbarous Resolve. In the mean time <HI>Hous</HI> perceiving
that no Attempt he could make would prevail against the City, broke up the
Siege; which he was the rather induc'd to do, because he had receiv'd intel∣ligence
that a strong Army was upon their March for relief of the same: <HI>Hous</HI>
endeavor'd to save himself by a timely flight, but the <HI>Tartar</HI> Horse overtook
the Rere of his Army, and kill'd a great number of them; but what became of
him was never known, in regard he never after appear'd publickly; and indeed
<PB N="292" REF="162"/>
it is more than probable that he was either kill'd in the Fight, or ended his
days in the Mountains.</P>
<P>And thus the <HI>Chineses</HI> effected as little by their Insurrections and Plottings
against the <HI>Tartar</HI> in the Northern Provinces, as they had done in the Southern;
for there follow'd nothing upon it but a total destruction of their Cities, and
the ruine both of the People and Country, drawn upon themselves, and with
the greatest severity executed in revenge of their Revolt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> having thus successfully pacifi'd all these Troubles and Commo∣tions,
could not yet be at Peace, but fell again into other as great Dangers and
Difficulties as the former, which they brought upon themselves by their own
Pride and Wantonness; for in the Year 1649. the young Imperial <HI>Cham Xun∣chius</HI>
having attain'd the Age of twelve years, was desir'd by his Uncle to take
to Wife the Daughter of the King of <HI>West-Tartary,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>The Kingdom
of Taniju;</HI> which Alliance would not only strengthen him, but also would
be a means to establish him in his Throne. To that end one of his Uncles was
sent in Embassy to the same King; in which Iourney he hapned to pass
through <HI>Taitung,</HI> the third Chief City, and call'd <HI>The Key of the Province of Xansi;</HI>
for it is a very strong Place, and serves as a Bulwark and Defence against the
Invasions of those <HI>Western Tartars</HI> into <HI>China:</HI> moreover, it is reported the most
famous of all others for the beautiful Women which live there. The <HI>Tartars</HI>
who attended on this Ambassador, in their Passage through this Place ravish'd
and took away some of these Women, and amongst the rest a Bride of great
Quality, as she was carried by chance through the Street to the House of her
Bridegroom; a thing that is held very abominable among the Inhabitants of
<HI>Taitung.</HI> At this time was one <HI>Kiangus,</HI> a Commander in the Army, Governor
of that Province for the <HI>Tartars;</HI> to whom the Friends and Relations of the
Virgin that was carried away by force, came and complain'd with Tears in
their Eyes: <HI>Kiangus,</HI> who took compassion of them, in regard of the Injustice
and Villany of the Fact, sent immediately one of his Attendants to the Vice-Roy▪
<HI>Panang,</HI> with request, that he would be pleas'd to give Order that the
ravish'd Bride might be restor'd to her Bridegroom, for that he was grown di∣stracted
upon the loss of her; desiring also that care might be taken to prevent
the like Abuses for the future. But the Vice-Roy gave no heed to this Request
of the Governor, but suffer'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> to go away with the Rape unquesti∣on'd;
which <HI>Kiangus</HI> took so to heart, that he went to the Vice-Roy himself
in Person, who not only refus'd to give him Audience upon it, but commanded
him to be put out of his Court.</P>
<P><HI>Kiangus</HI> boiling with Revenge at this uncivil Carriage of the Vice-Roy to∣wards
him, swore that he would never serve those that countenance such abo∣minable
Actions; and not long after having drawn his Forces together, he
came with them and fell upon <HI>Panang</HI> in his Court, killing the greatest part of
his Followers; but <HI>Panang</HI> sav'd himself by being let down with a Rope over
the Walls; and so escap'd with his Life. <HI>Kiangus</HI> hereupon, knowing that what
he had done, was a sufficient cause to make him lose his Head, if he fell into
the Hands of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> sets up his Standard, and promises to submit himself
to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor, but names none in particular, for he knew not that
<HI>Iunglieus</HI> was elected to that Dignity, being at so great a distance from him.
He likewise us'd all Endeavors to draw the <HI>Chineses</HI> to take part with him, and
to stand up for the regaining the Liberties of their Country, which by the un∣heard
of Oppressions of the <HI>Tartars</HI> they had lost. Several Commanders and
<PB N="293" REF="162"/>
Officers hearing of this, came and joyn'd with him, so that by this Revolt of
<HI>Kiangus</HI> new Troubles were arisen in the Emperor's Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> and the
more in regard the Western <HI>Tartars</HI> favor'd him, who were able to bring more
Men into the Field than the Eastern, especially Horse, of which they have
great plenty, whereas there are but few in the other.</P>
<P>Now to nip these Risings in the Bud, which were made by the means of
<HI>Kiangus,</HI> a very great Army was forthwith rais'd in <HI>Peking,</HI> and sent against him.
<HI>Kiangus,</HI> who was no less wise than valiant, and very well understood the Hu∣mors
of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> having Convers'd many years with them, at first seem'd
as if he were afraid to stay the coming of the Enemy, for he fled with his For∣ces;
but this was done only out of Policy to draw them to pursue after him,
having by the Way laid an Ambuscade for them; which took good effect, the
<HI>Tartars</HI> being thereby set upon and defeated; and after they had rallied, were
beaten in the open Field a second time. The news of this double Defeat being
brought to <HI>Peking,</HI> occasion'd again new Troubles in the Court, especially
when they heard that <HI>Kiangus</HI> his Army consisted of above a hundred thousand
Horse-men, and four hundred thousand Foot; of which great multitude there
is no wonder, for every Person was glad of his Success, and ready to follow
him as the Redeemer of their Country from the <HI>Tartar</HI> Slavery.</P>
<P>When now the Emperor's Uncle understood with how great Success this
<HI>Kiangus</HI> proceeded, he resolv'd to march himself with all the Forces the Empire
was able to make against him; for he durst not trust any with a Concern, upon
which depended the Welfare of the whole State. He therefore causes the eight
Standards, under whom march all the whole <HI>Tartar</HI> Militia to be made ready
for the War; and accordingly, that he might lose no time, draws forth the
choicest Soldiers of this great Body, wherewith he marches against <HI>Kiangus,</HI> to
chastise him for his Revolt, strengthening himself also by the Way with the
addition of many more Forces, which he had from the Southern Provinces:
But although he Commanded a very great Army, yet he avoided by all means
Fighting with <HI>Kiangus,</HI> who gave him occasion, and provoked him on purpose
to draw him to Battel. But the <HI>Tartar</HI> took a better course, fearing the un∣certain
event of War in a Battel, and knowing how to overcome his Enemy
at a far cheaper rate, as being but ill furnish'd with Provisions; and therefore
he resolv'd to delay him so long, till he should be compell'd to leave the Field
for want of Victuals and other Necessaries: besides, another reason that made
him unwilling to give Battel was, because he first desir'd to receive an Answer
from the Western <HI>Tartar</HI> King, to whom he had sent an Ambassador with very
rich Presents, and several handsom Women, with order also to demand his
Daughter in Marriage for the Emperor his Nephew, and request him not to
give any Assistance to <HI>Kiangus</HI> the Rebel. And so much operation had this Em∣bassy
upon the King of <HI>Taniju</HI> or <HI>West-Tartary,</HI> that he return'd the Ambassador
immediately with a satisfactory Answer, and Promise, that he would continue
from thence-forward in Peace and Amity with the <HI>Great Cham. Kiangus</HI> also
having sent thither for Aid, but finding himself frustrated in his Expectation,
and deserted, thought it most advisable for him to make towards the City of
<HI>Taitung;</HI> into which he was no sooner entred, but the <HI>Tartar</HI> Forces were at
his Heels, and got to the very Gates; and in the space of three days, with the
help of the Peasants, who were compell'd to come in, a deep Trench of ten
Miles in circumference was drawn round about it: Whereupon <HI>Kiangus,</HI> find∣ing
himself thus penn'd up, and that no Relief was to be expected, but he must
<PB N="294" REF="163"/>
either be kill'd or starv'd, like a valiant Commander thus bespake his Men:
<HI>You see, Fellow Soldiers, into what a Strait we are reduc'd, there being no hopes to escape
but by Fighting like Men, the Sword on one side, and Hunger on the other encompassing us;
let us not suffer our selves to perish with Hunger, but rather with our Swords in our Hands
dearly sell them our Lives, or with their hazard, cut the Way to our Safety through our
Enemies Carcases; I for my part will die with my Zable in my Hand.</HI> He had no sooner
ended his Speech, but he and all his Forces made a Sally out into the Trench,
where both sides fought for a while with equal Courage, till <HI>Kiangus</HI> unhappily
struck with a Dart, fell down dead, at the very sight whereof the <HI>Chineses</HI> de∣spairing
of making their Way through the Enemy, some flung down their
Arms and call'd for Quarter, others betaking themselves to Fight; such as
submitted freely to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> had their Lives spar'd, for they now thought
they had done enough in overcoming so great and dreaded an Enemy, whose
Power would have endanger'd the loss of the whole Empire. After they had
clear'd the Field, and totally routed and destroy'd the <HI>Chinese</HI> Army, they
march'd into the City <HI>Taitung,</HI> whose Plunder was given to the victorious Sol∣diers:
And not long after the General, having first taken care for the setling of
good Garrisons in all Places, march'd back in triumph to <HI>Peking,</HI> where he
was receiv'd with great joy. And now having thus subdu'd the Rebels, and
made all things to become peaceable and quiet, he bends all his Thoughts to
accomplish the Match between the Emperor his Nephew, and the Daughter of
the King of <HI>West-Tartary;</HI> and to that end he takes a Iourney thither in Per∣son,
and through his crafty Behaviour at last obtain'd his Suit, and also Licence
for the Exportation of a great number of Horses. The Wedding was kept in
very great State; for the <HI>Tartar</HI> Kings maintain in Marriage the same Customs
with those of <HI>Europe,</HI> Matching only with the Daughters of the highest Qua∣lity;
whereas the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors were wont to chuse only for Beauty, ma∣king
no difference between a Person of Quality, and one of a mean Extraction;
for if the Face do but please them, they mind not the Quality; as a testimony
whereof, most true it is, that the Father of the last <HI>Chinese</HI> Empress maintain'd
himself by making Shoes of Straw.</P>
<P>But to return to the three Vice-Roys, who were made by the <HI>Tartars</HI> Gover∣nors
over the three Provinces of <HI>Fokien, Quantung,</HI> and <HI>Quangsi,</HI> and sent with
three Armies to reduce <HI>Quantung,</HI> drive out the Emperor <HI>Iunglieus,</HI> and pacifie
the Disorders in the Southern Provinces: They took their Iourney through
a Country which the <HI>Tartar</HI> Emperor had given to some <HI>Tartars</HI> (for the native
<HI>Chineses,</HI> by reason of their Conspiracy, were all put to the Sword) to inhabit
and cultivate the same, they requested of the Vice-Roys, that they might ac∣company
them upon the Way; for in truth these People ever had an aversion
to Husbandry, loving their Arms better than the Plough or Spade: But two
of the Vice-Roys deni'd their Request without leave from the Emperor; the
third only, call'd <HI>Kengus,</HI> being of a high and lofty Spirit, permitted them to
follow him; so they abandon'd the Country, and exchang'd their Spades and
Ploughs for Boughs and Arrows, following their Country-men with great
joy. As soon as the Emperor heard of it, he writes a Letter to <HI>Kengus,</HI> with ex∣press
Command to send them back to their Husbandry; but <HI>Kengus</HI> taking no
notice thereof, suffer'd them to continue their March with him: whereof the
Emperor having a second time notice, in a great Rage sends to the chief <HI>Tutang</HI>
or Governor of the Southern Provinces, who held his Court at <HI>Nanking,</HI> either
to imprison or kill <HI>Kengus.</HI> The <HI>Tutang</HI> forthwith obeys the Emperor's Order;
<PB N="285" REF="163"/>
for after the three Vice-Roys were arriv'd at <HI>Nanking,</HI> and had been nobly
Treated by the <HI>Tutang,</HI> he pulls out his Letter and Order, shewing them to
<HI>Kengus;</HI> who knowing that no Excuse would be admitted, goes immediately
and hangs himself; however, his Son, who accompanied him in the Wars, suc∣ceeded
him in his Place, by Order of the Emperor. After this the other two
Vice-Roys through the Provinces of <HI>Xantung, Kiangsi,</HI> and <HI>Nanking,</HI> at last ar∣riving
at <HI>Quantung,</HI> with an intention, according to their Commission, to re∣duce
that Province, and to force <HI>Iunglieus</HI> to flie thence: and indeed, no sooner
was the Report of the coming of these three Armies spread through the Coun∣tries,
but most Places submitted freely, only the Chief City of <HI>Canton</HI> or <HI>Quan∣cheu</HI>
endur'd a long and hard Siege, and made great and valiant opposition, yet
was at last taken by Treachery in the Year 1650. all the Inhabitants being put
to the Sword, and the City levell'd with the Ground.</P>
<P>After the taking of <HI>Canton,</HI> all the adjacent Cities and Places sent Ambassa∣dors
to the Vice-Roys, with Promises of Submission if they might have their
Lives spar'd; which was freely granted them. Then the Vice-Roy march'd
with his Army to the City <HI>Chaiking,</HI> where the Emperor <HI>Iunglieus</HI> kept his Court
at that time; who hearing of his coming, durst not stay for him, but left the
City and Province, and fled to that of the Dominion of <HI>Quangsi;</HI> but being
narrowly and closely pursu'd, he was necessitated to betake himself to the Con∣fines
of the Kingdom of <HI>Tungking,</HI> where what became of him is not since that
time certainly known.</P>
<P>In the Year 1651. died the faithful Uncle of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Emperor, to the
great grief and lamentation of all People; for he was a Prince of great Va∣lour,
Prudence, and Experience, and to whose happy Conduct the Conquest
of <HI>China</HI> is chiefly to be attributed: Not only the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but the <HI>Chineses</HI>
themselves lov'd and fear'd him, for his Understanding in Martial Affairs, and
his otherwise civil Comportment and Integrity. And as good Men always die
too soon, so was he hardly cold but great Divisions hapned in the Court, by
means of one of the Emperor's Brothers call'd <HI>Quintus,</HI> who would take upon
him the Guardianship and Direction of the young Emperor, against the wills
and minds of all the rest; for they were of opinion, that the Emperor
<HI>Xunchius</HI> being now arriv'd at the Age of sixteen years, was sufficiently qua∣lifi'd
to take upon himself the Management of all the Affairs of the State:
But ambitious <HI>Quintus</HI> alledg'd, that the Emperor was not yet of an Age ca∣pable
to take upon him the great and weighty Affairs of the Empire; and
therefore insisted that the Direction and Management of Affairs might be
committed to him till the young Prince should attain his full Age: But find∣ing
that he was generally oppos'd by all the Grandees of the Court, and that
it was impossible for him to attain his Ends, he at last concurr'd with the Opi∣nions
of all the rest; and the young <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary</HI> is Crown'd, and the
whole weight of the Government unanimously thrown upon his Shoulders;
which he manag'd with such Iudgment, that in a short time he gave sufficient
proof of his Abilities, and not only his desire, but intention to do Iustice; in∣somuch
that when some dangerous Counsels which his deceased Uncle had in
his Life-time given came to break out, he caus'd his dead Body to be taken
out of the Tomb, and be most shamefully misus'd, and the Tomb to be bro∣ken
in pieces: nor ended he there; for those of his Uncle's Relations who
were privy and consenting to the said Counsel, were likewise handled with
extreme severity.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="164"/>
Thus far have I spent in setting forth particularly, how and in what man∣ner
the Robber <HI>Licungzus</HI> first over-ran <HI>China,</HI> and after his Expulsion how the
<HI>Tartars</HI> at last conquer'd the same: Now you are to remember, that contem∣porary
with <HI>Licungzus</HI> was another Thief call'd <HI>Changlianchus,</HI> the remaining
Transactions of whose Villany, whereof we have already in part made men∣tion,
I shall now relate: And indeed when I call to mind the Cruelties com∣mitted
by this Monster in Mans shape, I am as one deprived of his Senses; for
his Actions were so dismal and horrid, that whoever hears of them, will be
fill'd with stupefaction and amazement.</P>
<P>This Robber <HI>Changlianchus</HI> plunder'd and ruin'd several Provinces, putting
the Inhabitants to unspeakable Tortures, to make them confess where they
had hid their Wealth and Goods; he was greatly delighted to put out Peoples
Eyes, and to see Men die in misery. His Design was really to have depopula∣ted
the whole Country of <HI>China,</HI> that so being alone, there might be none left
to oppose him, or be his Competitor: And although the barbarousness of
his Nature appear'd every where, and upon all occasions, yet did he give a
proof of his Cruelty in no Place more than in the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> where
he took upon him the Royal Title, and put most of the Inhabitants to death.
He would frequently cause a whole Family to be utterly destroy'd, if any one
of them had not obey'd his Orders according to his will and mind. He abound∣ed
so very much in Feral Barbarism, that oftentimes if by chance any one had
offended him, he would cause all the Inhabitants residing within the same
Street to undergo the Fury of his inhumane and bestial rage.</P>
<P>He was civil and kind to none but his Soldiers, with whom he would Con∣verse
and Drink as if he had been but their Companion; and many times
would bestow great Presents upon them, if they had perform'd any thing well,
and according to his mind; yet on the other hand, for the least Offence or
Neglect, he made nothing to put multitudes of them to death. And which is
yet more, this bloudy Caitiff's Butchery extended to very Magistrates, but in
special manner to those of the Chief City of <HI>Chingtu</HI> of the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI>
so that of six hundred, in the space of three years were hardly twenty left that
escap'd with their Lives; and it was a Recreation to see and cause People to
be flay'd alive.</P>
<P>When this Blood-thirsty Tyrant endeavor'd to take the Chief City of the
Province of <HI>Xensi</HI> (which in regard of its Strength is call'd <HI>The Key of Suchuen
and Xensi)</HI> he came in the Year 1645. before it with a very great Army of at
least a hundred and eighty thousand Natives of the Province only, beside a vast
number of others out of several other Provinces. When the Siege had conti∣nu'd
a long time, (for the Inhabitants defended themselves with wonderful
Courage) there ran over to the Besieged at least forty thousand Men out of
his Camp, which troubled and provoked the Tyrant so much, that he caus'd
the remainder of a hundred and eighty thousand Men of <HI>Suchuen</HI> to be cruelly
massacred and murther'd by their other Fellow Soldiers, before his Face.</P>
<P>When he heard that the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the Year 1646. were fall'n with their
Forces into the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> he found himself necessitated, to prevent
such an unquiet and troublesom Neighborhood, to march against them; but
lest the Inhabitants of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> to many of whom he had been so cruel, should
conspire against him in his absence, he caus'd them all to be put to death, ex∣cept
such as live toward the North-East: Then he march'd first to <HI>Chingtu,</HI> the
principal Chief City of the Province of <HI>Suchen,</HI> and caus'd all its Inhabitants
<PB N="297" REF="164"/>
both Rich and Poor, being above six hundred thousand in number, to be
bound by his Soldiers, and afterwards miserably slain; by the effusion of
whose Blood the <HI>Chineses</HI> write, that the Water of the great River <HI>Kiang,</HI> which
runs before the City, was extraordinarily swell'd and rais'd. The dead Bodies
that they might not taint or infect the Air, were flung into the River, which
being carried down with the Stream, soon brought this mournful news to the
neighboring Cities and Places, viewing what they were like to expect, if they
resisted not the fierceness of that merciless Beast; which though they did with
all their Might, yet it was not long before the same cruel usage reach'd many
of them. And after this manner was this Province, which formerly abounded
with People, laid waste and made desolate both of People and Habitations.</P>
<P>These Villanies perpetrated, and being now to march against the <HI>Tartars,</HI> he
encourages his Soldiers to behave themselves valiantly, for that he had Silver
enough to reward such as did well; but in regard the Women (as he suppos'd)
would be a trouble to them, not only upon their March, but in the Battel, he
caus'd them to be put to death, therein shewing them the way; for of three
hundred beautiful Women which he us'd for his own lustful Pleasure, he re∣serv'd
only twenty to wait upon his three Queens, all the other being massa∣cred
in view of the whole Army: whereupon the Soldiers following his bar∣barous
and bloody Example, did the like, either by Shot or Sword killing their
Wives in a most wretched manner.</P>
<P>Having destroy'd all the Inhabitants of the Province, and no more left to
exercise his Cruelty upon, he fell upon the Cities and Houses, laying them
waste, and not leaving any one Place standing wheresoever his ruining Feet
trod; nay, more to shew his hatred to Posterity, he caus'd all the Trees to
be fell'd and cut down, that so no body for the future should have any benefit
by them after him; such as were sick and not able to follow the Camp, he
caus'd likewise to be hang'd up, to prevent them (as he scoffingly said) from
living or dying in pain and misery.</P>
<P>After all this barbarous Havock and Desolation made, this Enemy of Man∣kind
pass'd with his Army into the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> whither the General of
the <HI>Tartars</HI> follow'd him at the Heels with an Army of fifty thousand Men,
un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l the residue of the whole Army could get up to him. When the news was
brought him, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> were in sight of him with a great Army, he
laugh'd at those that reported such a Fable (as he thought it) not believing it
possible that such a thing could be, till going out of his Tent himself, to make
the discovery, the first Object that he met with, was the sight of five <HI>Tartars,</HI>
who according to the Custom of those People, were sent out before to disco∣ver
and demand whether he would have Peace or War; but in stead thereof
they presently fell upon him, and the first Arrow that was shot pierc'd him
quite through the Heart; wherewith falling down dead upon the Place, it
struck so great a fear into all his Followers, that they were soon overthrown.
The news of this Victory was quickly spread abroad, upon the report of
which such <HI>Tartars</HI> as were left alive, and had escap'd the bloody Hands of the
Traytor in the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> came out of their Holes, and cry'd up the
Victors as their Deliverers: And thus at length the Province of <HI>Suchuen</HI> fell
under the Subjection of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who putting Garrisons into the chiefest
Places, march'd back with their Army to the Imperial City of <HI>Peking;</HI> where
upon their Arrival the General of the Army, though he return'd victorious,
yet so slippery are the Stations of Great Men, was very unworthily receiv'd by
<PB N="298" REF="165"/>
his Brother, who accus'd him of Neglect, in that he had not well perform'd
his Charge. The faithful General with this disgraceful Affront was put into
so violent a Passion, as being conscious of his own Merit, and knowing that
he had deserv'd the greatest Thanks imaginable for what he had done, he flung
his <HI>Tartar</HI> Hat upon the Ground, which is taken by them for a sign or token of
great Disrespect; and therefore (O base Reward for Fidelity!) he was con∣demn'd
to perpetual Imprisonment; but this valiant and generous Spirit
prevented it, by hanging himself beforehand in his Palace.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> having clear'd the Kingdom of the two great Robbers, <HI>Licung∣zus</HI>
and <HI>Changlianchus,</HI> they immediately endeavor'd by all fair means to settle
the Kingdom in Peace and Quietness; which they shortly to their great satis∣faction
and content brought to pass, and enjoy the same at this time without
any further disturbance.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HREE things have I earnestly coverted ever since my
first arrival in <HI>China,</HI> and frequently have implor'd
them from Heaven: The first is, Union and Con∣cord
among <HI>Christian</HI> Princes. The second, that I
might live to see our native Country of <HI>Portugal</HI> Go∣vern'd
by a natural King. The third, that I might
also see before my departure hence, those Countries
which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have Conquer'd from us, reco∣ver'd
out of their Hands. From the Object of these my Desires it will be easie
to understand the Motive from whence they proceed, which is no other than
to remove the Obstacles, and make the Way plain to the present Maintenance
and farther Propagation of the <HI>Roman Catholick Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Thus in the Year 1648. being newly deliver'd from that Imprisonment,
<PB N="300" REF="166"/>
Famine, and other Calamities, which I endur'd within the Province of <HI>Sien∣chuen,</HI>
under the Tyrant which there Rebell'd, I came to the Port at <HI>Peking,</HI> and
was there encountred with the news of our new, or rather our old King (for
he cannot cease to be a King, who continues such in his Subjects Breasts, and
was always one by Birth-right) like a new Sun rising in the West in <HI>Lisbon:</HI>
which although it came to pass contrary to the Laws of neighbor Kings, yet
no ways contrariant to the Laws of Nature. I say, when I heard this News,
it caus'd such a Iubilee to my Soul, and Ioy to my Heart, and rais'd in me such
great hopes of spreading the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, as I could then only feel with∣in
my self, and am not able to express; being moreover satisfi'd, that our new
King, and his glorious Atchievements in <HI>Brasile</HI> did promise no less in these
Eastern Countries. May the Lord accomplish these Desires, and grant the
happy End that my Heart longs for.</P>
<P>But that <HI>GOD</HI> might either shew us our Sins, which have so justly deserv'd
Punishment; or that he might manifest the Bowels of his Mercy and singular
Providence which he hath over his People, especially the Holy Catholick City
of <HI>Maccow;</HI> he hath permitted the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to become her Rivals in this Em∣pire,
and to Court it for their Establishment, Alliance, and Commerce with
it. This indeed did rebate the edge of our Minds, and reduce your Favor to
more remiss degrees, though not wholly extinguish it: for four of us, Bre∣thren
of the Society of <HI>IESUS,</HI> then living at Court, resuming our Courage
with blooming Hopes, resolv'd to leave no <HI>Medium</HI> unessay'd to overthrow
those <HI>Hollanders</HI> Designs, and with all Diligence and Vigilancy to vacuate their
Undertakings.</P>
<P>What Success the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had in their first Expedition to <HI>Canton</HI> many
years past, I have already written to your Lordships; therefore I shall only
meddle with the second Encounter, and by how much fiercer that was with
an Enemy furnish'd with all the Habiliments of War, to wit, Plenty of Gold
and Silver, the most prevailing Weapons for the conquering of Countries and
Great Ones; and of all other Rarities adapted to satisfie both Covetousness
and Curiosity, as the most powerful Engines against such Soldiers; by so
much was our Conflict more grievous, and consequently the Victory more
glorious: so hath it many things worthy to be publish'd. The Lord grant
(for it hath ever been my faithful Petition to him, and may your Lordships
make it yours, with your whole trust in him) that as your Lordships and my
self also at a great distance have beheld with our Eyes the Hope of my second
Desire fulfill'd (for we have seen the Desire of all Nations, our King, our Fa∣ther)
so you may see the first and third part of my Wishes, to the Glory of God,
the Honor of the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the increase of <HI>Christianity.</HI></P>
<P>Access to <HI>Canton</HI> being precluded to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at their first Attempt, and
Trade deny'd them, those <HI>Reguli</HI> which Rule that Province, allur'd with the
hopes of that extraordinary Gain they expected to make by Commerce with
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> Counsell'd them to return on a second Embassage, which they ac∣cordingly
entred upon the 20<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Iuly 1655.</HI> and arriv'd in <HI>Canton</HI> the fifth of
<HI>September</HI> the same Year, where from those <HI>Reguli</HI> they had a very friendly Re∣ception;
but because they could obtain no Audience above to their first Mes∣sage,
they were fearful to proffer a second, lest the King and Council should
suspect it to arise only from the hopes of their own Advantage and Self-inte∣rest;
they therefore so wrought with the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton,</HI> that he should
send this second Memorial of their Desires, which, accompanied with many
<PB N="301" REF="166"/>
Commendatory Letters to Courtiers, and strengthned a world of large Pro∣mises,
came at length to <HI>Peking,</HI> about the Year 1655. and presently, no man
opposing, it was decreed, That twenty <HI>Hollanders</HI> (to wit, two Captains, and
eighteen others) should repair to the Court, where they were promis'd a con∣venient
House, with many other Kindnesses; and that after their appearance,
their Business should be transacted according to the Customs and Laws of the
Realm.</P>
<P>Fifteen days after this Memorial came to the Court, we had notice of it,
when <HI>Padrie Lodouicus Ballionies,</HI> and my self, immediately entred the Lists, and
searched after all means possible to hinder the <HI>Hollanders</HI> access to the Court.
We consulted with our Friends, both <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> who were all of
opinion, that it was impossible for this time, (at least without vast Bribes) be∣cause
those <HI>Reguli</HI> of <HI>Canton</HI> had corrupted the Great <HI>Mandorins,</HI> and open'd all
the Dooas of the Court unto them.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this Zeal for the Publick Good, the Progress of <HI>Christi∣anity,</HI>
the Love of our Country, and especially of this noble City (to which we
allow so much) did invite, yea, compel us to an Undertaking, the accomplish∣ment
of which seem'd impossible to all Men. By the Mediation of a certain
<HI>Christian,</HI> of no contemptible Condition and Authority, we first compass'd to
speak with one of these <HI>Mandorins,</HI> which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Colli,</HI> and we may
style <HI>The Master of Requests,</HI> whose Office is to acquaint the Emperor with the
Misdemeanors of the whole Empire, and particularly with the Exorbitances
of the <HI>Mandorins:</HI> He at our first Address readily undertook the Business, and
seem'd to promise himself an happy issue of it. Hereupon we deliver'd him
certain Heads to frame a Petition, of which he accepted; but a few days being
pass'd, when we thought he had made some progress in the Business, he comes
to the <HI>Christian</HI> before-mention'd, and thus excuses himself: <HI>Sir, if those</HI> Padrees
<HI>who are Strangers be ignorant, yet you who are Natives must be acquainted with the man∣ner
of doing Business in this Court, to wit, That whose Petitions either I, or any other in
the same Office with me, do exhibit, proceeds always from these two Reasons; either that
we may avenge our selves of our Enemies, or that we are hir'd to it by some great Reward
from him in whose Name the Petition runs: Now I have receiv'd no Injury from the</HI> Hol∣landers
<HI>to be aveng'd of, nor any Gratuity from those</HI> Padrees, <HI>that I should thrust my
my self into so much difficulty and danger for them.</HI> This Man therefore we left, and
apply'd our selves to anther, who plainly told us, <HI>That if we would give him
two hundred</HI> Tays, <HI>he would plight his Faith to deliver our Petition, with whatever Arti∣cles
we should insert, only he would not oblige himself that the Emperor should approve of
them; but if we would give him six hundred</HI> Tays <HI>more, he would be bound they should be
granted; and in case they were not, he would repay the whole Eight hundred</HI> Tays.</P>
<P>Considering the weightiness of the Mattir, and the Liberty which your
Lordships gave us in your Letters, to undertake for any Sum of Money that
we found necessary to effect this Business, with your Engagement that the City
of <HI>Maccow</HI> should make good the Payment, we promis'd him the whole Sum:
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd upon the rehearsed Conditions, before the Petition should be deliver'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>according to this Country Custom) this Master of Requests would see the
whole Sum of Money ready, and also receve some certain <HI>Tayes</HI> beforehand, as
a Pledge and Earnest of the whole; which being impossible for us to do, he
even excus'd himself as the former had done, and so forsook us: but we in∣sisted,
and in stead of ready Money, which we wanted, produc'd two rich Vests
that the Emperor had bestow'd upon us, and we had carefull preserv'd by us,
<PB N="302" REF="167"/>
but never worn, because it was the Emperor's Gift to us, and that they were
unsuitable to our Poverty and Religious Habit: These he accepted for a hun∣dred
and fifty <HI>Tays</HI> of the Sum agreed on, with all the symptomes of a great
Satisfaction; and really great was our Content, because we now seem'd to
have laid a sure Foundation for that Work we so earnestly desir'd to finish.
When lo this same <HI>Mandorin,</HI> we know not by what means, came to discover,
or at least to suspect, the Vest to have been the Emperor's Gift unto us, which
was an Argument sufficient for him to decline our Business, alledging not
only, That he was not so barbarous to receive or wear them, but also, That
it was unworthy in us to slight the Vests which had been Presented us by the
Emperor, and therefore we might go look some other Person for our Business,
which on such Terms he would not touch with his little Finger. Nor is this
Answer any matter of wonder to any that are acquainted with the Dispositi∣ons
of those <HI>Chineses;</HI> for so timerous are they in any thing relating to their
Emperor, or rather so superstitious, that beyond all comparison they do more
dread him than they do God or his Temple: But this fear and lowness is but
external, in reference to their Hands, and where their want of Power forbids
to do more; but if you respect their Hearts, there is no <HI>Chinese,</HI> especially of
the Learned sort of ingenious and liberal Education, who is not a very Prince
and carries not in his Plebeian Breast the Pride of the greatest Monarch. And
this is the Source and Fountain whence such frequent Dissentions spring up
among them, and the Cause of their often Changes. But this is a Digression,
let us return.</P>
<P>Our Affliction and Trouble was not small, to see our Hopes thus plung'd;
whereon, besides the many Sacrifices of the Mass which we offer'd to God, we
appointed also some particular Devotions daily for this purpose. Our next
Application was to all Princes and Noble-men, whom either we could take
any occasion to visit, or who took any occasion to visit us (for no day pass'd
wherein several Persons came not to adore the Holy Image, and to view our
new Church and Habitation, which the Emperor had bestow'd upon us) these
we spar'd not to acquaint with the villanous and perfidious Disposition of the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> with their Apostacy from their ancient profess'd Religion, and Re∣bellion
against their lawful Soveraign; as also their Attempt upon the City
of <HI>Maccow</HI> some years past, where they were repell'd, and indeed cut off by the
brave Inhabitants, few in number, but mighty in Courage and Unanimity;
whereunto we thought fit to add, That after their Repulse from <HI>Maccow,</HI> they
made an Invasion upon some part of the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> and also seconded
that with a forcible Seizure of an Island lying in that Sea, belonging to the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> and by them call'd <HI>Taiwan,</HI> (but by us nam'd <HI>Formosa)</HI> where they
had erected Warlike Forts, and where they had in no longer space than two
or three years, murder'd more than three thousand Persons of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> some
the ancient Inhabitants of the Island, and some Merchants of the Province of
<HI>Fockin</HI> and <HI>Checkin,</HI> pass'd thither with their Merchandize: And it appear'd in
the Records of their Iudicial Proceedings, that during the last King's Reign,
thirteen of those <HI>Hollanders</HI> which chanc'd to be taken Prisoners upon the Coast
of <HI>Fockin,</HI> being brought to the Court, were all there Condemn'd, and accor∣dingly
Executed. In like manner we continu'd to alledge, That under the pre∣tence
of Trade they had been admitted Footing upon the Island of <HI>Iava;</HI> that
notwithstanding that King, weary of their Neighborhood, had a long time
cut off all Relief of Provisions going to them from all parts of his Territories,
<PB N="303" REF="167"/>
and sometimes Besieg'd them with puissant and numerous Armies, yet could
he never prevail to turn them out of their Possessions, from whence he might
at first easily have kept them: Nor was the Bond of any League strong enough
to tie these Universal Robbers from offering, or to secure any of their Allies
from suffering Injuries by them, who thought the Sea only their single due, ex∣cluding
all others from any Right to it; and therefore never made distinction
between Friend or Foe, when any Ship fell into their Hands they were able to
master, as if <HI>Neptune</HI> had granted to them the only Patent of the Ocean. And
upon all this we inferr'd, That to admit these Men the Exercise of a Free-Trade
in <HI>China,</HI> besides the domestick Perils and Mischiefs it would contract,
were likewise to condemn and scandalize all other <HI>Christian</HI> Princes and Rulers,
when they should see the great Potentate of the World, embracing in the Bo∣som
of his Country the Arch-Pyrates of all Seas, whom all other Principali∣ties
did shun, as the most pernicious Danger in their Dominions; But here
I omit, that all the Chief Persons about the Emperor admir'd at the Impudence
of these <HI>Hollanders</HI> Undertakings, and astonishment at the Carelesness and Se∣curity
of those Persons who were in Places of Trust in this Empire, or (more
truly) at their Corruption, in letting such a kind of People have access into
their Country. One amongst the Great <HI>Tartars,</HI> a Man of a precipitate Zeal,
was so transported upon our Relation, that he cry'd out, <HI>'Twere fit the Emperor
did immediately command them to be Hang'd, as publick Thieves and Rebels to Mankind,
to be sure to deter them from the like Attempts for the future:</HI> To whom we answer'd,
<HI>That such a Course would be too rigorous and unjust, because they ought to enjoy the Privi∣leges
and Immunity of Ambassadors; and since they had committed themselves to the Empe∣ror's
Faith, were by all means to be preserv'd from Violence: 'twould better become the
Emperor to shew them Grace and Favor, as to Strangers, especially since they had brought
rich Presents, and to dismiss them peaceably to their Ships, only to be certain to grant them
nothing they came for, so to discourage their Return.</HI> More moderate and wise was
the Behavior of an Eunuch of the Emperor's, a great Councellor, who when
he had heard our Character of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> said, <HI>Although they are a despicable sort of
People, it were ignoble to Treat them ill; rather the Emperor should return them Presents,
and dispatch them for their own Country, with a strict Order never to return to this.</HI> Our
Report had soon spread it self so far within and without the Palace, that at
length it came to their Ear who had the management of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Business,
and from thence to the <HI>Dutch</HI> themselves, who sent a Messenger to desire us to
forbear exasperating these People against them, as Thieves and Vagrants, it
being an Injury they could not bear: but before I give an Account of them
here, something of their coming hither.</P>
<P>The Memorial from the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton</HI> (as we have said) coming be∣fore,
it was so contriv'd, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> accompanied with <HI>Mandorins,</HI> and
some Interpreters, beside a great company of the Vice-Roys People, who gave
them Attendance and great Honor upon the Way, follow'd to the Court of
<HI>Peking,</HI> where they arriv'd the 17. of <HI>Iuly 1656.</HI> and (to confess the truth) had
they given as ample testimony in their Travels of their being <HI>Catholicks,</HI> at least
<HI>Christians,</HI> as they did of their Munificence, and being <HI>Europeans,</HI> they had highly
deserv'd every Man's Affection, and the Titles of Governors and Noble Per∣sons;
for to all the <HI>Reguli,</HI> Nobles, and <HI>Mandorins</HI> which they met in their
Way, and the Cities they pass'd through, their Presents were very rich and no∣ble,
their Gifts very liberal, even to the meanest of the People, who brought
them but a Coal of Fire to light their Tobacco, or did any such small Office;
<PB N="304" REF="168"/>
whereby they purchas'd the Hearts of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who unacquainted with
such Silver Showers, thought they could never sufficiently admire and extol
them.</P>
<P>That these <HI>Dutch</HI> prov'd not <HI>Catholicks</HI> is no great wonder, but that they
should not appear <HI>Christians,</HI> was a great Infidelity and a grand Scandal. In a
City through which they pass'd in their Iourney towards the Court, and
where I Lodg'd in my going thence to <HI>Maccoa,</HI> a Father residing in a Church
there, together with many other scandaliz'd <HI>Christians,</HI> told me, That the <HI>Dutch</HI>
had there given to the <HI>Bonzians</HI> forty <HI>Tays</HI> towards the building of a Temple
for their Prophane and Diabolical Sacrifices; which I endeavor'd to excuse,
by alledging, That doubtless they gave it to some other end, but that the <HI>Chi∣nese</HI>
Interpreter had taken the advantage thus to turn it, that thereby they might
endear the Affections of the People (as is customary in that Country) at the
Cost of Strangers: but if they did really what the same Father and those <HI>Chri∣stiuns</HI>
related to me, it is manifest how much their Policy savors of Atheism;
but however, if in this I have pleaded their Favor, yet for their Eating Flesh on
<HI>Fridays</HI> and <HI>Saturdays</HI> I cannot do it, because it was a grievous Scandal to all the
<HI>Christians</HI> here; but these are the Fruits of that Evil and Infernal Tree, <HI>Heresie,</HI>
to wit, Scandal of the Brethren, Remissness in all <HI>Catholick</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Duties,
Doubtings in Matters of Faith, Evil report of the Holy Law, and Schism in
the Union of the Church; for these young Buds and tender Blossoms are not
able to endure such blasting Winds, and nipping of Frosts: it is so far from
entring into their Hearts, that an <HI>European Christian</HI> should err in matter of
Faith, that they hardly believe he can fail in the Observation of any of the
Laws of God: nor have an Affront to proffer at it, since 'tis impossible to ex∣cuse
that next to be related. Amongst other curious and precious Gifts (a List
whereof you have at the end of this Relation) they gave several Corral and
Amber Beads, as well to the Queen-Mother, as to the King himself and his
Royal Consort, and amongst these (as an Eunuch who receives and lays up all
Presents in the Royal Treasure told me) there was the Image of the Child
<HI>Iesus,</HI> our Lord and Savior, most admirably wrought in Amber; whereof
since there is no particular mention among the Catalogue of the Presents,
doubtless they included it among those several Pieces of Amber appointed for
the King. My purpose here is not to Dispute, but to give a Narrative, there∣fore
I shall only say, That it is an Infernal Policy of that Nation to accuse us
for using Beads, and worshipping of Images, as Superstition and Idolatry; yet
by the same in way of Present to make their Addresses to so Great and Emi∣nent
Persons; intimating what they would (as to Religion) trample under
their Feet, to be a part of their own Divine Worship.</P>
<P>About a years space before the <HI>Hollanders</HI> arriv'd at Court, came two of their
Men, one a <HI>Chinese</HI> of <HI>Canton,</HI> the other an Interpreter, whether of <HI>Maccoa</HI> or
no we cannot tell, because we would never visit either them or the <HI>Hollanders,</HI>
though they much desir'd it; therefore these two espying Father <HI>Lodowick Ba∣lion,</HI>
through inadvertency passing by their Door, call'd after him very earnestly,
twice repeating <HI>Father, Father;</HI> but he kept on, as though he had neither heard
nor seen them; and thenceforward we were more careful to avoid all passage
near their House; for if no other Inconvenience arise from visiting them, yet
it had been a kind of Contradiction to those Report which we made here to
all People of them.</P>
<P>Now although we knew that these two had corrupted many Great Men
<PB N="305" REF="168"/>
about the Court, and particularly a <HI>Tartar,</HI> the chief of these <HI>Coly</HI> (as they call
them) President of the Tribunal of Hospitality (somewhat like our Master of
the Ceremonies) whose Office is to receive Strangers, and to Negotiate their
Business for them; yet we resolv'd not to be discourag'd, but rather taking the
greater magnanimity, and trusting in Almighty God, who sometimes permits
Difficulties to appear insupportable by Humane Strength, that we may ascribe
our happy Success to him alone, and return him all Praise and Thanks who
brings all our Works to pass; with erected Spirits therefore, and our Hearts
advanc'd, we accosted a famous <HI>Chinese,</HI> who is likewise President of the Tribu∣nal
of Hospitality (for now all their Courts have double Chiefs and Presi∣dents
in them, the one a <HI>Tartar,</HI> and the other a <HI>Chinese)</HI> earnestly requesting
his favorable assistance in this Business; for knowing his Authority, in his Fa∣vor
lay our greatest Hopes, and he was ever a most friendly Person to us (as
he had been to the Fathers our Predecessors) and one that had a good opinion
of our Books and Sciences; to whom we Presented a Book written in <HI>Chinese</HI>
Characters, a Mirror or Theatre of their part of the World, wherein I shew'd
him a Description of the Island adjacent to the Province of <HI>Fokien;</HI> and among
them a Geographical Map of the Island of <HI>Formosa,</HI> which they vulgarly call
<HI>Tywan;</HI> and so took occasion to report those Mischiefs that had befall'n that
Isle since the <HI>Hollanders</HI> invaded, and to declare the imminent Danger impend∣ing
not only over that Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> but the whole Empire of <HI>China,</HI> by
the vicinity of such an Enemy; particularly, that so long as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> re∣main'd
upon the Island of <HI>Formosa,</HI> neither <HI>Civencheu</HI> nor <HI>Cincheu</HI> (the Names of
the Cities of the Province of <HI>Fokien)</HI> could ever be secure or flourish, but would
be in perpetual hazard of decay. This <HI>Mandorin</HI> was wonderfully pleas'd with
the Book, and promis'd me to shew it to the Council that was to be held about
the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> and withal he added this word of Consolation, <HI>That these</HI>
Hollanders <HI>shall never accomplish and bring to pass their Designs here, although I well
know they have Brib'd the King of</HI> Canton, <HI>and many other great Officers about the
Court: for I will never suffer them to enter into</HI> China, <HI>or to be allow'd any Commerce
with it:</HI> And as he promis'd, so he likewise perform'd, with other <HI>Chineses</HI> of
his Party withstanding the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and anon producing the Book to them,
whereunto they all gave great estimation and credit, because it was written in
the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language.</P>
<P>At length, from the Cognizance that all Great Men took of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI>
and the Fame that was spread of them, it came to pass that the <HI>Tartars</HI> shut
them up, and not only deny'd them liberty to sell any thing, or to buy any
Necessaries for themselves, but also prohibiting them to receive those Enter∣tainments
whereunto some of the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton</HI>'s intimate Friends had
invited them; nor would they suffer any Man so much as to sit down at their
Door: whence the <HI>Dutch</HI> despairing of any good issue of their Negotiations,
plainly disown'd their Pretence of seeking any Commerce here, and pretended
their Business to be only a Congratulation of the Emperor in his new Con∣quest;
which having now perform'd, with their most hearty Wishes for the
continuance and increase of his Posterity, they desir'd his Majesties leave to re∣turn
to their Ships and Country.</P>
<P>Hitherto whatever Father <HI>Lodowick Balion</HI> and my self have done to defeat
the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> if it were not according to our Wishes, it was according to our
Power, and by Divine Assistance it prov'd sufficient in our laying open the
Qualities of this Nation, to alienate the Affections of the <HI>Chineses</HI> from them,
<PB N="306" REF="169"/>
and of many <HI>Tartars</HI> too, who before stood at the most but in a Neutrality,
and to the striking some terror in those who had been corrupted by their
Bribes: I say, That by Divine Assistance it prov'd sufficient; for without that
it had been impossible for us to have advanc'd one step in a Business of this
nature, as well for the vast Gifts and Presents, whereby they had gain'd upon
Men whom they had found capable of furthering their Design; as for the
contrary, Penury on our side, which lost us many Advantages that we could
otherwise have taken: for at <HI>Peking,</HI> as at old <HI>Rome,</HI> all things are bought and
sold.</P>
<P>We went often to the old Church, to confer with Father <HI>Iohn Adam</HI> about
this Matter, and to animate him to acquaint the Emperor with it (for he had
frequent access to the Emperor's Ear) I say, to animate him, not that he wanted
either courage or good will, but because (as I have formerly written unto
your Lordships) all Matters of great moment are entirely acted in the Tribu∣nals,
from whence alone the Emperor is to be inform'd of the Administrations
of his Empire, whereto he commonly conforms himself; yea, sometimes (if
he would) he cannot alter the Determinations and Decrees of the sixth Tribu∣nal,
who are become the Supreme Legislators of that Empire. When home∣bred
and domestick Business of the Country is in question, and whereof the
Emperor hath any knowledge, though it be but small, they commonly make
their Addresses to his Majesty about it; but of Forein Business he hath no
knowledge at all till they have finish'd it. Nor was it a thing of little danger
to move the Emperor in, lest they who favor'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> might be pro∣vok'd
to plead, that what Father <HI>Iohn</HI> and we did, proceeded meerly from Envy
and Covetousness to defame the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> because we would ingross the
Trade of <HI>Canton</HI> in the Hands of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> excluding all other Nations,
who probably might be more advantageous to this Empire: Yet notwith∣standing
all which, Father <HI>Adam</HI> did adventure to speak to the Emperor, who
was always highly pleas'd to favor him, and now to entertain his Motion, and
for his sake to incline to our Party; and it pleas'd God so to stop the Mouths
of all Gainsayers, that none durst open after. Your Lordships owe much to
Father <HI>Iohn Valleat,</HI> who although he could not negotiate with any abroad out
of the Palace, (as he wish'd) was yet very behoveful in his constant solicitation
of Father <HI>Iohn Adam,</HI> exhorting him to improve his Interest in the Emperor
about our Business, and suggesting many Reasons to him of its feasibleness;
and what he did herein, we have extracted out of an Epistle from him to Fa∣ther
<HI>Visidore,</HI> as followeth:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><Q>THe twelfth of this present <HI>February</HI> I was with the Emperor, who be∣ing
pleas'd (according to his wont) to honor me with familiar Dis∣course,
among other Subjects, he fell upon the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> which gave me
occasion to represent them in their proper Colours, and particularly to ad∣monish
the Emperor of that great Lye, wherewith they had arm'd them∣selves
upon their coming hither, in the poud boasting of their large Domi∣nions,
as if they had been legal and ancient Owners of great Territories,
when they, the truth is, were but violent Possessors of a small part of a
Country, which they at first had traiterously usurp'd, and since rebelliously
defended from their lawful Soveraign; and thereupon became Vagabonds
upon the Sea, there seeking Rapine from all People to furnish themselves for
maintenance of their Rebellion at home. Whereto his Majesty express'd his
<PB N="307" REF="169"/>
credit, by telling me, That two years since, upon their Proffer at it, he had
deny'd them Entrance into his Country, and that he knew not how they had
now obtain'd it; signifying, that 'twas either through negligence, or sur∣reptitious
dealing in his Officers; which I interpreted to him to be the Bri∣bing
those of <HI>Canton:</HI> however, since there was a Licence sent for their co∣ming
to Court, the best was to admit them, because it would seem light now
to revoke it; only he should be cautious how he granted them any Com∣merce
in his Country; for wheresoever they once got footing, they immedi∣ately
so fortifi'd themselves, that there was then no expulsion of them, nor
preserving the adjacent Parts from being infested with them. The Emperor
was very well pleas'd at my Information, and said it should be remembred
in its proper Season. A few days after their arrival here, I was Summon'd
by the <HI>Mandorins</HI> to be present in the Tribunal, in the Hearing and Debating
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Proposals, and to give my Iudgment upon them: At their
appearing there were twenty of them, the two chief being <HI>Peter de Goyer,</HI> and
<HI>Iacob de Keyser,</HI> whom the <HI>Tartars</HI> call'd <HI>Compim,</HI> that is <HI>Captain,</HI> and shew'd
them a fair Respect: they Saluted me very civilly after the <HI>European</HI> fashion,
calling me by my Name, which they had learn'd in <HI>Canton</HI> or <HI>Couchinchina.</HI>
Here they presently produc'd many Boxes and Fardels, which they open'd
before the <HI>Mandorins</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> and took out their Contents; but being ask'd
concerning every <HI>Species,</HI> whether it were of <HI>Holland</HI> or any other Country,
either because I was present, or to justifie themselves by the truth, they open∣ly
acknowledg'd of what Place every Particular was; so that all things be∣ing
seen and Examin'd, scarce one of ten was found to be of <HI>Holland,</HI> it be∣ing
easie to perceive they were most of them <HI>Indian</HI> Commodities; yea, the
Cloth, which they pretended to be made in <HI>Holland,</HI> and whereof they had
a hundred Pieces, was really no other than <HI>Indian Bafta's:</HI> Then Demand
being made of the length of the Voyage from thence hither, they said it did
require sixteen Months, affixing the time spent in Sailing from Place to
Place where they gather'd up Goods. All the Friends and Servants of the
Kings of <HI>Canton</HI> were diligent Attendants unto the <HI>Dutch,</HI> perpetually prai∣sing
and extolling them, and proclaiming the great Benefit which the <HI>Mando∣rins</HI>
would receive by Commerce with these Men; by which it was appa∣rent,
that those of <HI>Canton</HI> had undertaken the management of this Embassy,
which they perform'd with all their Power, as if it had been their own pro∣per
Business: At length they flock'd about me, to hear what I would say;
and I thus deliver'd my self in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language: <HI>Most certain it is, that
these</HI> Hollanders <HI>are</HI> Europeans, <HI>who have now no King to Govern them, because
they have cast him off; they have one only Prince that Commands their Armies, and he
who Commands now is a Child about six years old, nor is it he who sends them hither;
but, as they confess, by the Advice and Counsel of their</HI> Mandorins, <HI>they came first into</HI>
India, <HI>and afterwards into</HI> China: <HI>The Traffick they bring with them is for the most
part (that I say not all) of the Growth of other Countries, and not their own.</HI> But as I
intended to have proceeded, a Messenger coming for me from the Emperor,
I was forc'd to break off, only adding, <HI>That my Native Country was near theirs,
so that I very well knew their Manners, and understood their Language, whereby I had
discover'd from them, that in the Schedule which they deliver'd to the</HI> Mandorins, <HI>and
in the Memorial to the Emperor, they had made a far different Relation from what they
now have, had I been either absent, or ignorant of them: And though they found one
President acting much in favor of them, yet seeing me sit near him, they suppos'd me to
<PB N="308" REF="170"/>
have some Authority in the Court, which made them to forbear so much; and when I
arose to go out, they all stood up, and the two Captains proffer'd me their utmost Service.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>When I came to the Emperor, the first Observation I made to him, was
the Calculation of the time of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Travels; for being demanded,
Whence they came to this Employment? they answer'd, From <HI>Holland,</HI> for
a second Experiment of that Success whereof they had fail'd two years since.
They had confess'd sixteen Months for their Voyage from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>China,</HI>
and allowing other sixteen Months for their Passage from <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI>
therein were thirty two Months for their Passage forward and backward;
whereto adding eight Months, which have been spent between their arrival
at <HI>Canton</HI> and this Court, the whole amounts to forty Months, whereby it is
manifest, that they could not go hence home, and there wait for a Commis∣sion
and Presents, to return hither with them, and all in the space of two
years, as had been pretended; so that by this Lye the Emperor might judge
what credit was to be given them in other Matters. The Emperor was
somewhat amaz'd at this Argument; but approaching near, as if I had some
Secret to whisper to him, I alledg'd a second, which much more astonish'd
him, thus: If these People get footing in any Place, upon pretence of Com∣merce,
immediately they raise Fortresses, and plant Guns. (wherein they are
most expert) and so appropriate a Title to their Possessions. I admire how
they come to be led through the Emperor's High-ways between <HI>Canton</HI> and
this Court, and to be suffer'd to view all Places which may be most advan∣tageous
to them: for supposing they have a Design to Invade the Kingdom
of <HI>Cayo,</HI> if they come to that Island which is call'd <HI>The Golden Mountain,</HI> stand∣ing
in the middle of the great River, where it empties it self into the Sea,
and should there build a Castle, they would Command that Passage, and be
capable of all Supplies from Sea, in despite of this whole Country: and
thereabouts are four great Cities, which who could preserve from their In∣cursions,
if they should Settle themselves upon the aforesaid Place, which
they would be able to defend with a hundred Men, though it would put your
Majesty to the Charge of keeping two or three thousand Men in Pay to at∣tend
their Motions? and the like danger there would be in what Place so∣ever
should be allotted them for Abode. Let not the Emperor take it ill that
I do thus freely declare the sense of the Danger I apprehend him to be in;
for I stand before my bounteous Lord and Master, to whom I am oblig'd to
declare any thing that may prevent his ill, the fear whereof breeds no little
anxiety in my Heart. The Emperor stood musing for a small space, and
then signifi'd his clear apprehension of what I deliver'd, and presently ask'd
me if the <HI>Muscovites</HI> were of the same Temper? whereto I answer'd quite
contrary, That they were a very faithful and just People, one only Ex∣ception
Law allow'd, which therefore they do not so perfectly observe as
they ought; but they are Govern'd by a potent Prince, who could have no
other Design in his Embassy hither, but a meer Congratulation of the Em∣peror's
fortunate Conquest of this Empire, and happy Inauguration in the
Throne: but because they understand not this Language, nor have any In∣terpreter
careful of their Business, they are left as Men forlorn; it would
be therefore like the Emperor's wonted Goodness, though here are but two
of that Nation, seeing you have receiv'd their Message and Present, to do
them some Honor, and with other Gifts to return them in Peace and Amity
to their ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Country. The Emperor was pleas'd to approve whatever I
<PB N="309" REF="170"/>
said, so that I thought it needless to press any thing farther; God grant he
may be mindful (as I have already found him) of what I have now urg'd to
him, as well as what I mov'd about the <HI>Hollanders</HI> some Months since. At
length the Emperor commanded a Table to be furnish'd for me, and the
chief Eunuch of the Palace to accompany me, and so withdrew.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Certain it is, that three thousand <HI>Tays</HI> were sufficient to make a Present to
the Emperor, more acceptable than all the <HI>Dutch</HI> have brought, thereby to
confirm the Emperor's Favor to us, and interclude all Ways to these Here∣ticks;
but we are at too great a distance from <HI>Maccoa,</HI> to acquaint them with
these Passages, and probably we might not be heard; nevertheless I assure
your Reverend Fatherhood, that as far as my Power will extend, I will spare
neither Art nor Labor to paint out these <HI>Hollanders</HI> in their true and native
Colours. To do this Work now by the Hands of Subjects, seems very dif∣ficult
unto me: insomuch that a thousand, now the Enemy by his Bribes
has possess'd so many Hearts, would scarce do what a hundred would for∣merly
have done; however, I trust in God, the Ruler of all Hearts, and hope
in the Goodness and Favor of the Emperor, that as he hath been pleas'd to
hearken unto me in other things, so he would vouchsafe me equal Grace in
this present Business.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The first of <HI>August</HI> some <HI>Mandorins</HI> belonging to the Emperor, invited the
<HI>Mandorin</HI> of <HI>Canton,</HI> with a great <HI>Mandorin</HI> of another Province (who both had
accompanied the <HI>Dutch</HI> to Court) unto our Colledge, whither there came
that day at least a hundred Men, most of them grave and eminent Persons,
my ancient Acquaintance and Friends: Among other things they told me,
that the Fraternity call'd <HI>Cin a vam,</HI> had resolv'd to invite the <HI>Dutch</HI> to a Feast,
but they were not permitted to stir out of their Doors, which made them
despair of effecting their Design, insomuch that they had declar'd against all
seeking of Trade here; and having Saluted and Congratulated the Empe∣ror,
were desirous to depart homewards, only they had a very choice Pre∣sent
design'd for me, but for the same reason were not able to bring it; yet
they hope I will do them no Injury to the Emperor.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The sixth of <HI>August</HI> the Emperor sent for me to come to Court with speed,
to co-operate with the <HI>Coli</HI> in the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Business; and as soon as I came,
they shew'd me a Copy of a Decree drawn up, but not confirm'd by the
Emperor, who (they said) would have me consulted in it. Upon Examina∣tion
I found it run much in favor of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> praising their Nobleness and
Greatness, and extolling their Worthy Labors in coming from so remote a
Country, to Visit and Congratulate his Imperial Majesty; upon which
Considerations this Tribunal being to deliver their Opinions to the Em∣peror
concerning the Commerce which they desire with his Countries,
they declar'd an unanimous propensity to it: The President ask'd me if it
were with my satisfaction? I answer'd Negatively, and gave him my Rea∣sons
for it, that for thousands of years past, until this time, the Empire of
<HI>China</HI> having never admitted the like, it was a pregnant Argument that it
was not conceiv'd safe, but very dangerous; and greater Mischiefs were to
fear'd from the <HI>Hollanders</HI> upon such a Contract, than from any other Nation
under the Sun. But probably the <HI>Hollanders</HI> (said I) may be your Parents
and Kindred, and so come hither for your Benefit wholly; yet if their Pre∣tences
be well scann'd, they will appear to be grounded upon their own
Profit: They boast what great Merchants they are, and I suppose it is their
<PB N="310" REF="171"/>
Nature, as well as Trade, to enrich themselves from the Goods of others.
The <HI>Tartar</HI> President was both amaz'd and incens'd at my Answer; he was
Son-in-law to one of the Vice-Roys of <HI>Canton,</HI> and durst not contradict his
Father-in-law; therefore to make trial whether I would change my Sen∣tence,
he appointed three <HI>Chineses</HI> of the <HI>Coli</HI> to debate the Business more pri∣vately
with me; who were so far from altering my Opinion, that with
great alacrity they became all of my Mind, and express'd a great deal of Ioy
that I had spoke so frankly, which they not daring to do, were resolv'd to
absent themselves from Court. Hereupon I urg'd boldly that the Decree
might be alter'd, and the Suffrage of the Court being taken, a definitive Sen∣tence
drawn up, That seeing the Emperor had receiv'd Presents from the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> he should be desir'd to remunerate them away; but Contracts
with, and Access to this Court, was not according to the ancient style of this
Empire. To this they were all silent, and ignorant of the reason, albeit
two days after a Decree was issu'd out with some small Alterations only;
which mov'd me to go to the most ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> of the <HI>Coli,</HI> to know the
reason thereof: who seeing my Constancy and Resolution, desir'd me to
rest satisfi'd, and said it should be Concluded, that Commerce should be de∣ny'd
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> only it should be confirm'd by general Suffrage, that there
might be no occasion of offence to any.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The same day came the President to visit me, to be inform'd (as he said)
about the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Business: I advis'd him to be very careful what he did
in it, for I had spoken privately with the Emperor, who had commanded
the <HI>Coli</HI> to consult with me about it; whereby he intended nothing else, than
that they should follow my Sentence in it, and not recede from it. His Re∣ply
was, That he would persuade them to be content; that the Emperor
should reward them only, but not grant them any liberty of Trade. Thus
far was only Consultation about it, but it is now become a Conclusion; for
they despair'd of the Emperor's Approbation in their Favor without my
Consent, and of that they despair'd much more: In few days the Decree
will be Publish'd, and possibly before Father <HI>Gabriel Magelanus</HI>'s Departure,
who brings these.</Q></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Letter from the General of Batavia, to the Emperor of China,
and Vice-Roy of Canton; Translated out of Dutch into Por∣tuguese
by Father Iohn Adam.</HEAD>
<P>THE Omnipotent God, who created the Heavens, the Earth, and whatsoever is con∣tain'd
in them, hath divided the Earth into several Kingdoms, Empires, Provin∣ces,
Islands, and Dominions, and hath ordain'd by his Eternal Wisdom that no one Place
should be stor'd with all manner of things, but that whatsoever is either necessary for the
Life, or convenient for the Ornament of Mankind, whether Production of Nature, or In∣vention
of Art, should be found partly in one Country, and partly in another, Divine Provi∣dence
so disposing it, that the Wants of this Land should be supply'd by that, and the Defects
of that retributed by another, that so by the means of Commerce Men might enjoy Society,
and the common Wants of all Nations might, by receiving mutual Relief, knit themselves to∣gether
in the Bonds of Friendship: And this is the reason which mov'd our Natiön, above
all others, wholly to apply and devote it felf to Trade and Commerce through the utmost
Parts of the Sea; and by this means are we come to Alliance and Friendship with Kings
and Rulers of most Countries neighboring on <HI>China,</HI> whereby we came to receive Intelligence
<PB N="311" REF="171"/>
of those triumphant Victories, and glorious Conquests which Almighty God hath given your
Majesty over the renowned Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> by setling and establishing your Majesty in
the Throne thereof: And by this we have been stirr'd up to appear in the Presence of your
Majesty, to Congratulate those glorious Atchievements, and to wish a future Happiness and
Prosperity thereunto; and withal, to desire your Majesties admittance of our Ships to enter
with safety into the Ports of your Dominions, and to exercise a Trade with your Subjects,
as we do with those of other Countries. We hope that your Majesty will grant us this Favor,
seeing it is the Decree of Divine Providence, and an universal practice amongst all Men;
whereby great Profit shall accrue to your Majesties Subjects and Countries. And to the end
your Majesty may receive from us the greater Security and Satisfaction about our Proposals,
we have sent two ancient and honest Men, <HI>Peter de Goyer</HI> and <HI>Iacob de Keyser,</HI> to at∣tend
your Majesties Person and Pleasure, to whom we trust your Majesty will give Audience,
and a convenient Dispatch. And thus we pray Almighty God to grant perfect Health, and
to add many happy days to your Majesties Life.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><Q>This Letter, which by the Emperor's Order was Translated <HI>verbatim</HI> out
of <HI>Dutch</HI> into the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language, came at first unseal'd, and without any
manner of Glorious or Majestick Title, as if he had writ to one of his
familiar Friends and Equals; but the <HI>Chineses</HI> in <HI>Canton</HI> did so dress it up and
adorn it, that it appear'd with great Reverence and Humility: for other∣wise
and different were the Letters formerly written to the Emperor's of
<HI>China</HI> when we came hither, by <HI>Maximilian</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and <HI>Ranutius Fer∣nelius</HI>
Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> as well for the Paper, Style, and Superscription, as for
the magnificent Titles and Encomiums which they gave him: but what
Comparison between these Princes and a few Merchants in <HI>Iava?</HI> at length
the World will be undeceiv'd.</Q> Thus far Father <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>The Presents they brought they divided into four Parts, the first was for
the Emperor, the second for his Mother, the third for the Empress; these three
had their Superscriptions: the fourth was a particular Present for the two
Ambassadors. This Division was subtilly enough contriv'd, to purchase the
Favor, and to insinuate into the Affections of all Parties: but though the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> are sufficiently Masters of that Art, this was not their own Con∣trivance,
but the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton,</HI> who, as they did not act the Transla∣tor's
part, to mend and patch the General of <HI>Batavia</HI>'s Letter, but Compos'd
new ones in stead thereof, so they wholly order'd and dispos'd the Presents,
supposing so to manage the whole Business, that it should not be capable of
denial: Nor had they miss'd their aim, had they been <HI>Catholicks;</HI> for then they
had met with no Opposition. That the method and alteration in the dispo∣sure
of the Presents was the <HI>Chineses</HI> Invention, appears plain enough from this
one Argument: When the Master of the Ceremonies had receiv'd the Presents
from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> he ask'd them how it came to pass that such and such were
for the Queens, seeing there was no mention made thereof in their General's
Letter or Memorial? To which they return'd this ridiculous Answer, That
after they set Sail from their Port, and were far off at Sea, they found these
things in the Ship, which they knew not of before, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d therefore they had dis∣pos'd
them for their Majesties. Happy <HI>Argonautes</HI> are these, to find Silk and
<PB N="312" REF="172"/>
Purple woven in their Ships, without their own Labor; Corral and Amber,
with all manner of precious things, without their knowledge! Let no Man
think their Answer false or equivocal, because haply they found them in the
Ships of some <HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchants or others they met with in their Voyage;
for this they ordinarily do without any scruple of Conscience, or terror of
Divine Vengeance.</P>
<P>No Man can doubt, but a Nation so remote, which was in no case de∣pendant
upon, and never heard of before in the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> coming now
with the specious Pretence of being Tributaries, their Hands full of Presents,
(which though they had been of ordinary Quality, and things common in
<HI>China,</HI> yet might have been sufficient for the multitude of them) whereby they
endeavor'd to conquer the Emperor by the Vice-Roys of <HI>Canton,</HI> corrupt the
<HI>Mandorins,</HI> and above all make sure of that Chief of the <HI>Coli,</HI> Son-in-law (as I
have said) to the eldest Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton,</HI> and Bribe the <HI>Tartar</HI> President of
the Tribunal of Hospitality (which was not hard to fasten on so sordid and
covetous a Wretch) I say no Man can doubt, but that all this did promise to
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> a very prevailing Success to their Negotiations. But the Hearts
of Kings are in the Hand of the Lord: but though it must be confess'd, that
Gifts will do much, yet much more the devout Prayers of the Servants of
God, who has been pleas'd to fortifie the Minds of the <HI>Chinese Mandorins,</HI> to
weaken and unbend those of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and so to fix the Heart of a young
Emperor, that he should deny the <HI>Hollanders</HI> the Commerce they sought, and
with a remarkable Ingenuity, Affability, and Prudence, make them promise
their Return hither once every eight Years to pay their Tribute.</P>
<P>Three things there are, whereof the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have no scarcity, which had
they brought, would have been powerful Advocates for them: The first is,
a Harpsichord, with a skilful Player on it; the second, a Trumpeter; the
third, some Engineers and Officers to Train up and Exercise Soldiers. These
things the Emperor doth much long for; but our God would not suffer them
to bring them, that for the future the like may be brought by our Friends,
which may redound very much to the benefit of the <HI>Catholick</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>Lastly, May your Lordships consider, that it was a peculiar Grace of God
to blind the Eyes of these <HI>Hollanders</HI> (with their great Favorers and Interpreters
in <HI>Canton)</HI> that they should not put a pleasing Title to their Memorials, that
thereby the <HI>Chineses</HI> taking disgust at these innovating <HI>Hereticks,</HI> might be the
more closely link'd to the <HI>Catholick Portuguese.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Remonstrance of the Court of Request to the Emperor.</HEAD>
<P><Q>IN the thirteenth Year of the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Canchy,</HI> on the eigh∣teenth
Day of the sixth Month, came to this Court a Copy of a Petition
of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who came here to tender their Homage and Vassalage to
your Majesty; wherefore, according to our Duty, we have consulted there∣on:
and although the truth be, that the Fame of your Majesties Greatness
and Power be extended unto the utmost Parts of the habitable Earth; yet
upon our strictest examination and search into the Laws and ancient Re∣cords
of this Empire for this purpose, we cannot find in any Age past, that
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have ever sent to pay Tribute: Therefore seeing we have no
President, nor establish'd Rule to follow in this Business, the result of our
present Iudgment is, that your Majesty may do very well to continue this
following Decree, to wit,</Q></P>
<P>That considering the Voyage from the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Country hither is both tedious and
perilous, your Majesty doth grant them leave, once every five years to come and pay their
Tribute unto this Court, and not oftner: And this your Majesty doth, to shew the whole
World your willingness to receive into your Bosom the remotest Strangers. For the Way of
their approach hither, it is fit to be by the Province of <HI>Canton,</HI> and no otherwise: And
for what relateth to grant Licence for their Commerce within your Majesties Dominions,
there is already a clear Declaration publish'd for your Majesties Dislike thereof, so that
more needs not be said of that Matter; yet notwithstanding, after their appearance before
your Majesty, they may buy and sell some certain things, provided they have regard always
to such Constitutions as are made concerning all Strangers within this Realm, and exactly
conform themselves in the manner of Buying and Selling to the Laws and Ordinances esta∣blish'd
in that behalf; and hereupon let all vigilancy he had, and all appointed Penalties se∣verely
executed upon Default. As often as they shall come to pay-their Tribute, their whole
number both of Masters and Servants not to exceed an hundred Persons; of those, only
twenty shall repair unto the Court (the rest remaining behind at <HI>Canton)</HI> and of those
twenty, let them observe to bring two Chiefs, whereof one may be a Man of Learning, the
other a Soldier. Let the <HI>Mandorins</HI> provide strong Guards to accompany them to the
Court, and to take care at their Return that they keep together, without stragling out of
their Way; and upon their arrival at <HI>Canton,</HI> that they immediately repair for their own
Country, their delays about the Coast and Seas of <HI>Canton</HI> appearing inconvenient.</P>
<P><Q>This is the Opinion of your Majesties Court of Request, but not daring
to take upon it any Determination of what is fit or not fit; therefore I the
President thereof, do in all humble reverence offer this Remonstrance unto
your Majesty, beseeching your Majesties Royal Decree for a final Determi∣nation
hereon. Given in the thirteenth Year of his Imperial Majesty <HI>Can∣chy,</HI>
on the seventh Day of the seventh Moon.</Q></P>
<P>Two days after the Date of this Remonstrance, this following Decree of
the Emperor was Publish'd.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="316" REF="174"/>
<HEAD>The ultimate Decree of the Emperor.</HEAD>
<P>To the Kingdom of <HI>Holland</HI> Health and Peace, which out of its Cordial Love to
Iustice hath subjected it self to Us, and sent Ambassadors through the wide Sea
to pay Us Tribute: We nevertheless weighing in Our Mind the length of the Voyage, with
the Dangers incident thereunto, do heartily grant them leave to come once every eight years,
to pay their Tribute unto this Court; and this We do to make known to the Universe Our
Affections to the People of the remotest Parts: In all other things We give Our Royal
Consent and Approbation to the Remonstrance of Our Court of Request.</P>
<P>Thus (you see) neither the Court nor Emperor have granted them Com∣merce
in this Country; which being deny'd, there is little reason to think
that they will return to pay their Tribute only, whence they shall reap neither
Honor nor Profit, but contrarily Damage and Disgrace: for although the
Emperor should have return'd them Gifts of equal value to their Presents, ac∣cording
to the Custom of other Countries, yet the Expence of a Ship or two
for the space almost of two years, would be burthensom and ridiculous;
which however, allowing the denial of Commerce to them, if the Emperor
had granted them their Return every year, they might well have made up by
a private Trade, especially being so much in favor with the Vice-Roys of <HI>Can∣ton,</HI>
and the <HI>Tartars</HI> thereabouts, who would ingross the Profits thereof. There∣fore
did God stir up the Hearts of the <HI>Chinese Mandorins</HI> unanimously to oppose
and contradict it; and at length, when both <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> had granted
their Return every fifth Year, the Emperor by special Divine Providence hath
augmented it to the eighth Year; and before that Revolution come, either the
Emperor, the Vice-Roys of <HI>Canton,</HI> or the rest of their Favorers will be dead,
or the <HI>Hollanders</HI> will be destroy'd, or the Times will be chang'd, and other
Government will succeed: but if all these fail, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> will be so
abject to return at the eight years end, yet the Lord will minister some means
to us for the ruining their Designs; albeit there is little probability of their
Return, since they departed so highly discontented as they did, as well by the
strict Watches that were set over them, as for that they were never admitted
to the Emperor's Presence, as Father <HI>Balion</HI> hath acquainted me in an Epistle
which he wrote to me by a Post after my departure to <HI>Nanking,</HI> wherein he
thus writes:</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> may not come into the Kings Presence (nor the <HI>Muscovites)</HI> because
they will not submit themselves to those Ceremonies of Reverence accustom'd in this Palace.
They are Novices, and ignorant in Affairs, and obstinate in refusing to accommodate them∣selves
to the Customs of the Country. God will at length discover his Mercies to the <HI>Ca∣tholick
Portugueses</HI> here. The Court of Requests exhibited a Remonstrance to the Em∣peror,
to grant them leave to return every fifth Year, but not any liberty of Trade; but the
Emperor hath alter'd the fifth to the eighth Year, which is equivalent with a forbidding them
ever to return again. The day before Publishing the Emperor's Decree (whereof I here
send your Father-hood a Copy) Father <HI>Adam</HI> told me he had spoken with the Emperor.
<HI>Thus far Father</HI> Balion.</P>
<P>Your Lordships may observe how much our God doth favor and assist true
<HI>Catholick Christians;</HI> for the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> are highly offended with the
<PB N="317" REF="174"/>
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> and account them <HI>Barbarians,</HI> for refusing the Ceremonies and Re∣verence
of the Court: and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> (with the <HI>Muscovites)</HI> are equally dis∣tasted,
because they could not be admitted to the Emperors Presence without
them; and very just is it, that <HI>Hereticks</HI> and <HI>Schismaticks</HI> should depart with
hatred and disgust, that by their ill Example they might not give Scandal to
the new <HI>Christianity</HI> here Planted, nor cause the Religion of <HI>Europe</HI> to be ill spo∣ken
of.</P>
<P>Wherefore the most Noble Captain, and the rest of the Governors of the
Holy City, be your Lordships of good Courage, and hope strongly in the
Bowels of the Mercy of God, that as he hath suffer'd his City (most faithful
to his Divine Majesty) of late Years to undergo so many Tribulations, he
hath done it for Direction only, not for Destruction. Doth Gold melted in
the Furnace come out wasted and consum'd? no, but more pure, bright, and
precious. Can God forget the Piety of such a City, which maintains so ma∣ny
Religious of all sorts, and where so many Masses and Oblations are daily
Offer'd? Where is the Refuge and Sanctuary of Religion but in this City,
which is gloriously call'd <HI>The Name of God?</HI> Can God forget his Promise? he
hath promis'd Tribulations, and an hundred-fold for the Sufferings of his
Saints, and an hundred he will pay.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Cause and Occasion of this Work.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is now about thirty years since I produc'd the Expo∣sition
of a certain <HI>Syro-Chinesian</HI> Monument, found in
<HI>China</HI> in the Year 1625. which although it gain'd no
small Applause among the Readers of a more than
ordinary Apprehension, who were taken with the
Novelty, yet there were not wanting some incompe∣tent
Censurers or Criticks, who ceased not to wound
its Reputation by snarling and trifling Objections,
stabbing it with critical Steletto's, albeit they prov'd in the sequel leaden and
blunted, <HI>viz.</HI> That there was never any Monument of such a kind in Nature,
and that therefore it was a meer Forgery. This they endeavor'd by all
means possible, not only to persuade themselves to believe, but also to raise a
like Credulity in others. These and the like Persons are deservedly, and
ought to be esteem'd for such, who rejecting all Divine and Humane Faith, ap∣prove
of nothing but what they have seen themselves, account nothing to be
believ'd but what their own Brain hath dictated to them. These are they that
like troublesom Flesh-Flies, flying at any obvious fatness, soil that which is
sincere and untainted, and desist not to bespot that which is pure with a defil'd
<PB N="320" REF="176"/>
and <HI>Thrasonick</HI> Blast: Amongst which was a certain modern Writer, who
blush'd not with all his Might, and indeed with an insolent Scoff to question
the truth of this Monument, sometimes asserting it to be introduc'd by a Ie∣suitical
Cheat, and other whiles averring that it was a flat and plain Forgery
of the <HI>Iesuits,</HI> feigned both to deceive the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and also to defraud them of
their Treasures. I shall conceal the Name of the Person, partly out of a ten∣derness
to <HI>Christian</HI> Charity, and partly because in the Iudgment of prudent
and knowing Men he seemeth unworthy of any Answer; seeing that the
truth of this Monument is establish'd and confirm'd by the Eye-witness of so
many illustrious Authors, by so many Books concerning this Method divulg'd
throughout the whole Empire by the <HI>Chinesian Colais</HI> themselves, <HI>Leo</HI> and <HI>Paule,</HI>
Persons of great Quality, and instructed in the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion (the se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooks
are commonly expos'd to the sight of Strangers in the Library of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Colledge, with the authentick Draught of the Monument it self sent from
<HI>China)</HI> and lastly, approv'd by the whole <HI>Christian</HI> World; so that it is of little
concernment what an obscure Bragadocio barketh forth in the utmost Quarter
of the World; who, if he had abstain'd from Calumnies and Scoffs, and had
prudently propos'd the Matter with some scrupulosity, peradventure might
better have sav'd his own Reputation and the Credit of his Work; but so it
hapneth by the just Iudgment of God, that those who endeavor to traduce the
Glory of the Divine Majesty by Cavils and Scoffs, both contrary to Consci∣ence
and Charity, for the most part at length suffer Shipwrack of their own
Fame and Labors.</P>
<P>Mov'd therefore by these Reasons, lest a Monument of so great Concern,
depriv'd of its Credit, should run the hazard of being cast away, I shall labor
so by the Divine Assistance to establish the Truth of the Monument in this
undertaken Work, (being my Contexture from the very bottom of the Mat∣ter)
confirm'd not only by the great attestation of the Fathers of our Society,
which have seen it with their own Eyes, but also from the testimony of the
<HI>Chineses</HI> themselves, that from henceforth there may no place of doubting be
left, and the <HI>Heterodox</HI> themselves may be forc'd to confess (the Interpretation
of this <HI>Syro-Chinesian</HI> Inscription being consider'd) that no other Doctrine was
taught above a thousand years past by the Preachers of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which is not
altogether consonant and conformable, yea the very same with the <HI>Orthodox</HI>
Doctrine now profess'd: and therefore the <HI>Gospel</HI> Preached formerly in <HI>China,</HI>
is the same with that which the Universal Catholick <HI>Roman</HI> Church enjoineth
to be believ'd at this Day, as I shall afterwards prove by manifold strength of
Argument.</P>
<P>Now that the Matter may be treated of in a requisite Order and Method,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A two-fold Interpretati∣on of this Monument.</NOTE>
I thought good first of all to annex a two-fold, perfect, and sincere Interpre∣tation
of this Stone, expounded by the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Learned Men themselves,
from a Book Printed in <HI>Chinesian</HI> Characters, and express'd <HI>verbatim</HI> in the ge∣nuine
Pronunciation of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> words, by Father <HI>Michael Boim,</HI> a Person
excellently skill'd in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language, as it will appear anon from his
Epistle to the Reader. I have also adjoin'd another Exposition with the <HI>Scho∣liasts,</HI>
avoiding the <HI>Chinese</HI> Phrase, not so accustom'd to our Ears, and that for
the more sutable apprehending of the genuine Sence of the Table. And this I
did the rather, that I might not seem to omit any thing by which the Monu∣ment
might receive the greater Illustration. And by reason some may justly
question how those <HI>Syrian-Chaldeans,</HI> the great Propagators of the <HI>Christian</HI> Re∣ligion,
<PB N="321" REF="176"/>
could penetrate into those utmost Quarters of the Earth; it appear'd
not only congruous, but also absolutely necessary for the confirmation of this
Matter, to administer Aid to the perplexed Reader in this obscure Labyrinth
of various Travels, by the flaming Pharos of this Work; that is, to direct
him by Geographical Demonstrations; from which, if I do not deceive my
self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the Gospel, as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣so the Hea∣thenish Su∣per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itions came into <HI>China</HI></NOTE> the Reader shall clearly understand, That not only the <HI>Christian</HI> Doctrine,
but also the Superstitions of the <HI>Chineses</HI> and their Fables before the coming of
our <HI>Saviour,</HI> deriv'd their Original from one and the same Region; that is,
from <HI>Egypt, Graecia, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Chaldea.</HI> Now where the vast Empire of the
<HI>Chineses</HI> is, into which the Monument sheweth the <HI>Gospel</HI> to have had an En∣trance,
I shall rather hint at in a few words, than endeavor to describe; con∣cerning
which, notwithstanding, if the inquisitive Reader desireth farther sa∣tisfaction,
I shall remit him to have recourse unto the History of Father <HI>Ni∣cholas
Trigautius,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Samedius,</HI> as also to the <HI>Atlas Sinicus</HI> of <HI>Martine Marti∣nius,</HI>
and many others, where he shall find fully describ'd whatsoever relateth
unto the Situation of <HI>China</HI> and its Wonders, the Nature, Property, and Ferti∣lity
of the Regions, the multitude of its great and vast Cities, and their Inha∣bitants;
and lastly, the Politick and Civil Government, in which regard this
Empire seemeth not to give place to any Monarchy in the World. My Busi∣ness
is only to explain those things, which as they are controverted, so like∣do
wonderfully render the Readers doubtful and perplex'd about the equivo∣cation
of the Terms; and also to alledge, in respect to the curious Reader,
the more rare Curiosities and Secrets of Things observ'd to be treasur'd up in
this Nation and others adjacent, not observ'd hitherto by any former Authors;
with the Prodigies both of Nature and Art, each being recorded in their pro∣per
place.</P>
<P><HI>CHINA,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descrip∣tion and Boundaries of <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> the largest and vastest of Kingdoms, as it was confin'd unto the
utmost Bounds of <HI>Asia</HI> by the Creator of the Earthly Globe, so also did it re∣main
altogether unknown unto the Ancients, even unto the Year 1220. when
<HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> first discover'd it unto us under the Name of <HI>Catay,</HI> as af∣terwards
shall be made manifest. On the East it is encompass'd with the
Eastern Ocean; On the North it hath <HI>Tartary</HI> adjoining, separated by a Wall,
whose yet undiscover'd Bounds are extended even unto the Frozen Sea, and
questionless they are in some part or other continu'd to the North part of
<HI>America</HI> with <HI>Anian;</HI> whether it be a Sraight or <HI>Isthmos;</HI> although unto this very
time (as with great pains it was search'd after by the Fathers of our Society
employ'd in <HI>China)</HI> the Limits of these vast Kingdoms and Lands have as yet
been detected by no Person: On the West it is encompass'd partly with
Ridges of most high Mountains, partly a Sandy Desart and other Kingdoms,
which we shall discourse of anon: Lastly, on the South it is limited with
the Sea, the Kingdoms of <HI>Touchinum, Cochinchina, Laum,</HI> and others. The Lati∣tude
beginneth from 18 Degrees, and extendeth it self unto 43. that is, it is di∣stended
by the interval of a thousand four hundred and forty <HI>Italian</HI> Miles
from South to North, and from the West unto the East it almost consisteth of
the same Distance; whence the <HI>Chineses</HI> do express it in their Maps in the form
of a Quadrate, although by our Geographers that are better skill'd in the Ma∣thematicks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its several Names.</NOTE>
it is describ'd in the Figure of a <HI>Crescent.</HI> Now in reference unto
the confusion of the Names of it, it is as great as the diversity of the adjoining
Nations are: the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call it <HI>China;</HI> the Ancients, as it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to be seen in <HI>Ptolemy, Sin and Serica;</HI> the <HI>Arabians, Sin;</HI> and the <HI>Sarazens, Catay:</HI>
<PB N="322" REF="177"/>
All which Appellations are so far I may say, from being in use among the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI>
themselves, that the Names are not so much as known, as it is hence ap∣parent;
for it is an immemorial Custom among the <HI>Chineses,</HI> that as often as
the Right of Dominion devolv'd from one Family to another, according to
the mutability of Humane Affairs, so also was the Kingdom dignifi'd with a
new Name by him that assum'd the Regalities; which he that doth, imposes
some glorious Title on the Empire, according to his own will and pleasure:
So in Times past we read that it was call'd <HI>Tan,</HI> which is to say, <HI>An Empire with∣out
Bounds;</HI> other times <HI>Yu,</HI> that denoteth <HI>Rest</HI> or <HI>Repose;</HI> then <HI>Hiu,</HI> from the
Name of a great Duke; I find it also call'd <HI>Sciam,</HI> as if you should say, <HI>A most
Adorn'd Kingdom: Cheu</HI> signifieth <HI>A Kingdom that exceedeth all other Kingdoms in
Perfection;</HI> also <HI>Han,</HI> by which word they denominate the <HI>Milky-Path;</HI> whence
it cometh to pass, that almost each several Nation doth describe it by the im∣position
of proper and different Terms: Now at this Day it is call'd <HI>Ciumquo▪</HI>
and by some <HI>Ciunhoa,</HI> whereof the former signifieth <HI>A Garden,</HI> by reason of its
pleasantness, and abundance of delightful things, and the latter implieth <HI>The
Middle,</HI> because the <HI>Chineses</HI> suppose their Kingdom is situate in the midst of the
Earth, which also they will have to be four-square.</P>
<P>This whole Empire is divided into fifteen Kingdoms or Provinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Division of the Em∣pire of <HI>China.</HI></NOTE>
bounded or terminated in some places by vast Rivers, and in others by inac∣cessible
Rocks and Mountains: Of which Provinces nine are reckon'd in the
South part, and six in the North. Nature in a manner hath contriv'd all this
complex of Kingdoms unaccessible unto all others; on the East and South the
Ocean is scarcely Navigable, by reason of the violence of the Tydes; and on
the West the craggy Ridges of the Mountains admit of no passage; and on
the North it is at this Day fortifi'd partly by a Desart of an immense vastness,
and partly by a Wall of nine hundred <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, erected by King <HI>Xio,</HI> about
two hundred Years before the Incarnation of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> by the work of
1000000 Men in the space of five Years, to restrain the Incursion of the <HI>Tar∣tars;</HI>
so that being defended by so many Fortifications, it relieth on its own
weight: If you do but only observe the Wall, it is a Work that will cause an
amazement, which without doubt, if the Ancients had arriv'd unto the know∣ledge
of, they would have reckon'd it amongst the seven Wonders of the
World. But let us now subjoin the Names of the Kingdoms or Provinces.</P>
<P>The Northern Kingdoms of the Empire of <HI>China</HI> are <HI>Honan, Xensi, Xansi,
Xantum, Peking,</HI> and <HI>Leautum.</HI> The Southern Kingdoms are <HI>Canton</HI> or <HI>Quantung,
Quangsi, Yunnan, Fukien, Kiangsi, Suchuem, Utquang, Chekiam,</HI> and <HI>Nankim.</HI></P>
<P>That I may comprehend all in brief, first I shall annex a Geographical
Scheme or Map of the whole Empire, divided into fifteen Provinces, that you
may more clearly discover the Situation of each, and that we may not appear
to have let slip any thing memorable in reference to the Cities, Mountains,
Rivers, Lakes, and other Occurrences worthy of observation, I have here pre∣fix'd
this Geographical Table, which containeth a Description of all the King∣doms;
from which, as from an alone Compendium, you may find whatsoe∣ver
presenteth it self worthy of Consideration.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1625. when in <HI>Siganfu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first dis∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very of the <HI>Syro-Chinesi∣an</HI> Monu∣ment.</NOTE> the Metropolis of the Kingdom of
<HI>Xensi,</HI> in a certain Village a Trench was digg'd for the fit Foundation of
an Edifice or Building, it so hapned, That in the casting up of the Earth
the Laborers found a Stone Table, worthy of note for its <HI>Chinesian</HI> Writing;
which when they had digg'd out of the Ground, they measur'd it's quantity,
and found it in length nine handfuls and a half, in breadth five, and in thick∣ness
about one; whereupon was curiously Engraven a Cross. Those who
studiously view'd it, report, That the Cross was bent inwards like to the Li∣lies,
in the manner of that which is to be seen at <HI>Meliapore</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> on the Se∣pulchre
of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle, and not much unlike that which the Knights
of the Order of <HI>St. Iohn of Ierusalem</HI> bore, partly hanging on their Necks, and
partly sew'd to their Garments and Cloaks. Under this Cross followeth the
Title of the Inscription, express'd throughout the whole superficies of the
Stone in the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Language and Character, as is manifest from the Figure
adjoin'd.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Chineses</HI> are carried as it were by a certain natural propensity un∣to
things curious; so also the first Report of the finding of this Stone attra∣cted
a great multitude of their Learned Men, who resorted thither from all
Parts. The Governor of the Place being mov'd with the strangeness of this
Monument, having seriously contemplated the venerable Antiquity of it, that
he might allure and draw the People from all Parts by the Fame thereof, for
the Benefit and Reputation of the City, plac'd it on a Table or Pedestal curi∣ously
wrought within the Court of the Temple of the <HI>Bonzii,</HI> and erected a
Roof over it, partly that it might receive no damage by the injury of Time,
and also that as many as were Spectators of this unusual Monument might
read, examine, and describe it at their own leisure.</P>
<P>And because that on the Margents there were discover'd Characters un∣known
to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> intermix'd with those of their own, they were much
concern'd to know what they related unto, and at last were satisfi'd by the dili∣gence
of our Society, as it will appear more at large in the following Dis∣couse.
<HI>Leo</HI> the <HI>Mandorin</HI> being now instructed in the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By whom first made publick</NOTE> first of all
others divulg'd it, exactly describ'd, unto the whole Kingdom, for the great
advantage of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, which he hop'd might accrue from thence;
which coming to the Hands of the Fathers of our Society, when they had read
it, they could not sufficiently admire the Providence of the Divine Majesty,
that should condescend so far to disclose a Monument of so great Concern for
the Conversion of the <HI>Heathen</HI> in this novel Vintage of <HI>Christ;</HI> wherefore not
to conceal their Ioy, they betook themselves to <HI>Siganfu,</HI> the great Metropoli∣tan
City of <HI>Xensi,</HI> that they might be ocular Spectators of it; of which the
first was Father <HI>Alvares Samedus a Portuguese,</HI> whose words I shall the rather al∣ledge,
by how much he was the more engag'd unto me by the strict tye of
Friendship, whilst he remain'd at <HI>Rome</HI> Procurator or Provincial, where he re∣lated
to me in a familiar Conference all the Observations he had made con∣cerning
this Monument. Now he thus relateth the whole Circumstance in his
History of the Affairs of <HI>China,</HI> Publish'd in <HI>Italian,</HI> pag. 158.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="178"/>
Three Years after, in the Year 1628. there went some Fathers to that Province, upon
occasion of a <HI>Mandorin,</HI> being a <HI>Christian,</HI> whose Name was <HI>Philip,</HI> who was going
thither; those Fathers, by the help of the <HI>Mandorin,</HI> erected both a Church and a House
in the Metropolis of <HI>Siganfu,</HI> that since our Blessed God, who would that so fair a Memo∣rial
of a hold taken of his Divine Law in that Country should be discover'd, he might also
be serv'd, and the Restoration of the same Faith Instituted in the same Place. 'Twas
granted to me to be of the first, and I fancied that Mansion happy because of seeing the
Monument, and when I got thither I car'd not for any thing else: I saw it, and read it,
view'd it, and read it over and over leisurely, and wholly; and considering its Antiquity,
I wonder'd how it could be so entire, and have its Characters so clear and cleanly Engraven.
In the middle it hath many <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, which contain the Names of Priests and
Bishops of those Times; it hath also many others, which then were not known, because
they are neither <HI>Hebrew</HI> nor <HI>Greek,</HI> yet they are thought by most to contain the same
Names, to the end that if perchance any Stranger should not be able to read those of the
Country, they might happily understand the Forein ones. Afterwards passing by <HI>Coccino,</HI>
I arriv'd at <HI>Grauganor,</HI> the Seat of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Costa,</HI> to consult upon these
Characters with Father <HI>Antonio Fernandez</HI> of our Society (most excellently skill'd in the
Characters of this St. <HI>Thomas</HI> his <HI>Christianity)</HI> who told me that they were <HI>Syriack</HI>
Characters, and such as were in use there. <HI>Thus Father</HI> Alvares Samedus.</P>
<P>But there being very few that had any knowledge in the <HI>Syriack</HI> Letters, at
length being sent to <HI>Rome,</HI> they came to my Hands, when I (if I be not de∣ceiv'd)
gave the first Interpretation of them in my <HI>Prodromus Coptus,</HI> as I shall
shew more at large anon; yet notwithstanding I could not obtain them all,
because some of them being describ'd in disjoin'd Papers, peradventure were
Transcrib'd from the authentick Copy, only for a Specimen; but when not
long after the perfect Exemplar of the Original (which also at this day is to
be seen in the Library of the <HI>Roman</HI> Colledge) was sent unto me, then in truth
I esteem'd it requisite to finish all and every part of them in this, as a very con∣venient
Place, with a more exact Interpretation both of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> and <HI>Chal∣dean</HI>
Characters.</P>
<P><HI>Father</HI> Martinius Martinii <HI>coming to</HI> Rome <HI>after</HI> Samedus, <HI>did not only give
me an account of the Monument by word of Mouth, but also relateth the
Matter at large in his</HI> Atlas, <HI>where treating of the Province of</HI> Xensi, <HI>he saith,</HI>
That which maketh this Province the more famous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin. Atlas pag. <HI>44.</HI></NOTE> is that most ancient Stone, Sculp'd partly
with <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, concerning the Introduction of the <HI>Gospel</HI> by the Successors of
the Apostles into <HI>China;</HI> thereon are Registred the Names of the Bishops and Priests of
that Time, and the Favors and Indulgences of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Emperors; there is also
contain'd in it a short, but a most exact and admirable Explication of the <HI>Christian</HI> Law,
compos'd in a most eloquent Style; concerning which, by Gods assistance, I shall treat more
fully in my second Decade of the Epitome of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> History. This Stone was found
<HI>Anno 1625.</HI> when in the City <HI>Sanyun</HI> a Trench was prepar'd, by casting up the Earth,
for laying of the Foundation of a Wall: The Governor of the Place being inform'd thereof,
when he had exactly consider'd the Footsteps of venerable Antiquity, of which the <HI>Chineses</HI>
are wonderful Admirers, immediately he took order to have the whole Inscription of the Mo∣nument
Engraven on another Stone of the same Magnitude, observing and keeping the same
Strokes of the Characters as exactly as might be: The first Draught of which the Fathers
of our Society dispatch'd to <HI>Rome,</HI> together with the Interpretation, where it is preserv'd
in the Library of the <HI>Roman</HI> Colledge. The Figure of the Stone is extended after the mode
<PB N="325" REF="178"/>
of a Parallelogram, five Hands broad, one thick, and almost ten long; on the top is a
Cross, somewhat like that of the Knights of <HI>Malta:</HI> If any one desireth a more accurate
Account of it, he shall find the Matter more fully explain'd in the <HI>Prodromus Coptus</HI>
of the Reverend Father <HI>Athanasius Kircher,</HI> and in the Relation of the Reverend Father
<HI>Alvares Samedus,</HI> concerning the Transactions of <HI>China.</HI> The Fathers of our Society
then again restor'd the knowledge of the Law of God, obliterated and almost blotted out
of the memory of Men by the interval of a long Series of Time, they having erected many
Temples to the living and true God, and Administred in them with conspicuous and signal
Piety: Two of our Fathers do there strenuously cultivate that new Vineyard of the Lord,
one of them having fix'd his Station in the Metropolis, the other Travelling hither and thither
throughout the Province, where the greater necessity requireth, for the promotion of the
Worship of God, and the Good of Souls, that he may every where break and communicate the
Bread of Salvation to all that require the same. <HI>Thus Father</HI> Martinius Martinii.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Michael Boim</HI> at length arriv'd here, who brought me a more exact
Relation of this Monument than any other; he mended all the Defects in de∣scribing
of it from a <HI>Chinesian</HI> Manuscript, which I have in my Study, and in
my presence perfected a new and short Interpretation of the whole Table
word for word, by the assistance of his Associate <HI>Andreas Don Sin,</HI> a Native of
<HI>China,</HI> a Person excellently vers'd in his native Language: all which he pre∣senteth
to the Reader; in which he hath exactly describ'd the Series of the
whole Matter, and whatsoever may afford it self worthy of consideration in
this Monument; which Epistle I have judg'd meet, with his assent, to be here
prefix'd, as a luculent Testimony of the truth of this Interpretation, and also
for a lasting and durable Preservatory of the Matter; and I have taken care
to have the Draught of this Monument brought from <HI>China,</HI> the Original of
which even now may be seen in my Study to be Insculp'd, keeping its genuine
Notes and Characters, both those of the <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> and also
with the addition of <HI>Scholias.</HI> The aforesaid Epistle of Father <HI>Michael Boim</HI>
followeth.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>Father Michael Boim, a Polonian, of the Society of Iesus, wisheth all
Happiness to the well affected Reader.</HEAD>
<P><Q>AMongst the Monuments found in <HI>China</HI> concerning the <HI>Catholick</HI> Faith
there Preach'd, a Marble Stone of <HI>Chinese</HI> Writing, Engrav'd about a
thousand years since, with ancient <HI>Syriack</HI> Characters, which they term
<HI>Estrangelo,</HI> and the Subscription of the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Priests, claimeth the prece∣dency
of Place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Although long since there hath been Imprinted an Interpretation of
this Monument, perform'd by Father <HI>Athanasius Kircher</HI> in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue,
and after him by Father <HI>Alvares Samedus</HI> in the <HI>Italian,</HI> who himself saw the
Monument; yet notwithstanding, because both of them have only attain'd
the Sence of the written Stone, and the former also had not as yet obtain'd
out of <HI>China</HI> the <HI>Syriack</HI> Subscriptions of all the Priests, that he might Inter∣pret
them; I have therefore resolv'd with my self intirely, and with all Fi∣delity,
to publish the Inscription it self both in <HI>Chinesian</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Characters,
with a <HI>Latin</HI> Interpretation word for word, retaining the <HI>Chinese</HI> Phrase, and
also to propose and shew unto all Persons all the <HI>Syriack</HI> Subscriptions of the
<HI>Syrians</HI> Commented on by <HI>Athanasius Kircher,</HI> a Person excellently accom∣plish'd
in the Languages, with other <HI>Chinesian</HI> Occurences, as so many obvi∣ous
<PB N="326" REF="179"/>
Testimonies of the <HI>Catholick</HI> Verity: and that I may comprehend all in
a word, to expose the Stone it self to the Eye of the whole World in the <HI>Chi∣nesian</HI>
Idiome, as it was Sculp'd in the Year of <HI>Christ 782.</HI> that from this most
ancient Testimony every one may conjecture, how true the Doctrine of the
<HI>Catholicks</HI> is, seeing the same was Preach'd in an opposite Quarter of the
World, amongst the <HI>Chineses, Anno 636.</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> that is about a thou∣sand
years since. The <HI>Chinesian</HI> Original of the Stone is now conserv'd in
the Library of the <HI>Roman</HI> Colledge that belongeth to the Fathers of the So∣ciety
of <HI>Iesus;</HI> and another Copy is to be seen in the Repository of the
House of the Profession. I my self also obtain'd from the most Grave <HI>Chinese</HI>
Doctors and Masters (at the very time that the Monument was found) a
Book Printed in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language, in which the Writing of the Stone
was most truly and exactly express'd according to the true Original. They
advise the <HI>Chineses</HI> in the larger Preface adjoin'd to the Book, that at length
they would have recourse to the Masters of the great Occident (for so they
term the Fathers of the Society of <HI>Iesus)</HI> and discover whether they Preach
the same Law amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which their Ancestors with so many
Emperors embrac'd a thousand Centuries ago, and which the Fathers of the
Society of <HI>Iesus</HI> exhibited in the Books Printed in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language be∣fore
the Stone was found. Now it only remaineth that I should declare how
this Marble Table was detected.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When, after the Death of St. <HI>Francis Xavier,</HI> the venerable Father <HI>Matthew
Riccius,</HI> and other Fathers of the Society of <HI>Iesus,</HI> had introduc'd the <HI>Gospel</HI> of
<HI>Christ</HI> into the more Inland Parts of <HI>China,</HI> and had erected Residences and
Churches in some Provinces, and therefore the Propagation of the Holy
Faith had made no small progress in that of <HI>Xensi.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Anno 1625.</HI> one of the Fathers of the same Society, invited by Doctor
<HI>Philip,</HI> having Baptiz'd twenty Persons in his native Country of <HI>Sanyven,</HI> he
went with the same Doctor to see a Stone, which they had found some
Months before in the Village <HI>Chenche,</HI> near the Metropolis <HI>Siganfu,</HI> whilst
they were casting up the Rubbish for the building of a Wall.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This Father writes (which other Fathers, who had fix'd their Abode, and
erected a Church in <HI>Siganfu,</HI> with the <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> also affirm'd)
That a Stone was found five Hands broad, one thick, and nine long; the
top whereof made like an oblong Pyramid of two Hands, and one broad;
on the Vertex the Cross was Engraven above the Clouds, that with its
Branches seem'd to imitate the Flower-Deluce; besides the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Inscri∣ption,
on the left side, and beneath, there appear'd the Names of the <HI>Syrian</HI>
Priests, and also other <HI>Chinesian</HI> Names of the same Priests under-written.
(It is the Custom of the <HI>Chineses</HI> to have many Names; whence also the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI>
at this Day retain both the Name of the Saints they receiv'd in Bap∣tism,
and another <HI>Chinese</HI> Name.) The Governor of the Place being certifi'd
of the finding of this Monument, commanded an elegant Composition to
be made in praise of it, and to be Engraven on such another like Marble
Stone, causing both of them to be plac'd in the Fane or Temple of the <HI>Bonzi,</HI>
that are call'd <HI>Tan Su,</HI> a Mile distant from the Walls of the Metropolis <HI>Sigan∣fu,</HI>
as a perpetual remembrance of the same.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Many other Footsteps of the <HI>Catholick Faith</HI> Preach'd to the <HI>Chineses</HI> were
discover'd in the following Years, which God seemeth not willing to have
manifested, but only at that very time in which the Preaching of the same
<PB N="327" REF="179"/>
<HI>Faith</HI> arriv'd amongst the <HI>Chineses</HI> by the Labor of the Fathers of our Society,
that so both the old and new Testimonies might affect the identity of the
<HI>Catholick Faith,</HI> and the truth of the <HI>Gospel</HI> might be rendred perspicuous and
manifest unto all, The like Images of the Holy Cross were seen in the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Fokien</HI> in the Year 1630. In the Province of <HI>Kiangsi</HI> also a miracu∣lous
Light shone forth, <HI>Anno 1635.</HI> which was beheld by the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and
also in the Mountains of <HI>Fokien,</HI> and in the City <HI>Cyvencheu, 1643.</HI> Crosses
were found; yea, the venerable Father <HI>Martin Riccius,</HI> when first he came
into <HI>China,</HI> found <HI>Xe tsu Kiao,</HI> to be a Name signifying <HI>The Doctrine of the
Crosses,</HI> by which the <HI>Christians</HI> anciently, that were Disciples of that Doctrine
of the Cross, were nam'd; and I doubt not but all that were <HI>Christians</HI> in
the Kingdoms of <HI>China,</HI> when the <HI>Tartars</HI> about three hundred years past first
invaded <HI>China,</HI> and that they liv'd there mix'd with <HI>Sarazens, Iews, Nestorians,</HI>
and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> that is to say, in the Time of <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</HI> who tra∣vell'd
unto <HI>Catay,</HI> which is the very same with that we now call <HI>China.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And now, whether St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> or any other Apostle, first Preach'd the
<HI>Gospel</HI> to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> is not yet certainly known. Father <HI>Nicholas Trigautius</HI>
collecteth from some ancient Testimonies of the <HI>Christians</HI> of the Church of
<HI>Malabar</HI> in the Arch-bishoprick of <HI>Cranganor,</HI> or <HI>De Serra,</HI> which are termed
<HI>The Christians of St. Thomas,</HI> That in that Place, as also in <HI>Meliapor</HI> (which for∣merly
was call'd <HI>Calamina,</HI> and now by the <HI>Portuguese, San Thome)</HI> the holy
Apostle Preach'd, by reason that out of their <HI>Gaza,</HI> or Treasury, in the Of∣fice
of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> is recited or rehearsed; <HI>That by St.</HI> Thomas <HI>the</HI> Chineses
<HI>and</HI> Ethiopians <HI>were Converted to the Truth; by St.</HI> Thomas <HI>the Kingdom of Hea∣ven
took its flight, and ascended to the</HI> Chineses: And in the <HI>Antiphono,</HI> the <HI>Ethiopi∣ans,
Indians, Chineses,</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> in commemoration of <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> Offer up
Adoration unto his holy Name. Also in an ancient <HI>Synodical</HI> Canon, the
Bishops of the great Province, <HI>viz.</HI> those other Metropolitans of <HI>China, India,</HI>
and <HI>Pases,</HI> do send their Letters of Consent. Add withal, That he that Go∣vern'd
the Church <HI>De Serra</HI> at the coming of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> subscrib'd him∣self
<HI>Metropolitan of all India and China.</HI> But in truth, things being more nar∣rowly
consider'd, from those Circumstances and Footsteps which began to
be manifest after the time of Father <HI>Trigautius,</HI> we cannot certainly conclude,
that St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle Preach'd the <HI>Gospel</HI> himself amongst the <HI>Chineses:</HI>
for although these Footsteps of the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> here found, do evidently
shew, That the <HI>Christian Belief</HI> hath been in <HI>China;</HI> yet notwithstanding,
those very Paths or Tracts do demonstrate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At what time the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> entred into <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> that the <HI>Faith</HI> had its entrance
into <HI>China</HI> when the Family of <HI>Heuhan</HI> Rul'd over three Kingdoms (which
are now united in <HI>Nanking,</HI> the third Province of the Empire) <HI>viz.</HI> in the
Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> at the Shore of the River; for <HI>Antron</HI>-Cross seems by
its Inscription to have been fix'd, according to the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Computation,
about the Year of <HI>Christ 239.</HI> (which Cross weigh'd about three thousand
weight) whence the <HI>Faith,</HI> and the Preachers of the same, are certainly evinc'd
to have come amongst the Southern <HI>Chineses</HI> about a thousand four hundred
and fifteen years ago. But in some years following (the Knowledge of the
<HI>Gospel</HI> being extinguish'd) it was again renew'd by Priests out of <HI>Tacyu,</HI> that
is, <HI>India</HI> or <HI>Syria,</HI> in <HI>Xensi,</HI> a Northern Kingdom of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> the Royal
Family of <HI>Tam</HI> then Reigning <HI>Anno 639.</HI> as the Monument that was found
avoucheth, where relating the Preachers of the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> at that time
amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> it mentioneth not St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> or any other Apostle;
<PB N="328" REF="180"/>
which yet, if Insculp'd, would have been of considerable moment unto their
purpose who erected the Stone, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Preachers of the <HI>Faith</HI> then
again Preach'd the same <HI>Law</HI> that St. <HI>Thomas</HI> or some other Apostle had be∣fore
Preach'd amongst the <HI>Chineses.</HI> Moreover it is evident, That those
Preachers of <HI>Tacyu</HI> had no knowledge of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> or any other Apostles
Preaching the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> unto the <HI>Chineses;</HI> and a Conjecture may be
made, that peradventure neither St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> nor any other Apostle, intro∣duc'd
the <HI>Gospel</HI> amongst them: And that I may speak most moderately, no∣thing
can be certainly deduc'd or drawn concerning this Matter from the
Footsteps here found; and the Passages before alledg'd are only able to
prove, That those Priests were sent from the Church of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> or <HI>Baby∣lon,</HI>
which then Govern'd the <HI>Malabran</HI> Chuch <HI>De Serra,</HI> belonging unto the
<HI>Christians</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> (as the <HI>Portuguese</HI> afterwards found) to erect an Epis∣copal
Seat, and to introduce the <HI>Faith</HI> amongst the People of <HI>China,</HI> seeing
this is testifi'd by the ancient <HI>Syrian</HI> Language call'd <HI>Estrangelo,</HI> which is now
retain'd in that Church, and was in former Times in use in <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Sy∣ria.</HI>
And as for the Orations compos'd in praise of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle,
from them we may only conjecture, that by the Merits of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> and his
Church, the Priests perchance introduc'd first of all the <HI>Faith</HI> which they had
receiv'd from St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> amongst the <HI>Chineses;</HI> and therefore deservedly their
Conversion ought to be attributed unto St. <HI>Thomas.</HI> Wherefore seeing there
is no mention of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> to be found in the Paths of the <HI>Faith</HI> Preached,
hitherto discover'd, we cannot positively assert, That St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> or any
other Apostle, Preach'd the <HI>Gospel</HI> unto the <HI>Chineses;</HI> but I rather think that
many Ages after, the <HI>Christians</HI> of <HI>Prester-Iohn</HI>'s Country (whose Emperor
<HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> calleth <HI>Usan Can</HI>) who are term'd <HI>The Worshippers of the Cross,</HI>
were those that entred into <HI>China</HI> either with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> or a little before:
for those from <HI>India,</HI> or rather from the <HI>Syrian Chaldea,</HI> or those of <HI>Malabar,</HI>
as they are far more ancient than the <HI>Tartar-Christians,</HI> so would they have
call'd their Disciples that were Followers of a more clear Doctrine <HI>Kin Kiao;</HI>
but I believe those Preachers came not out of <HI>India,</HI> for the <HI>Syrian</HI> Language
and Names testifie them to be <HI>Syrians;</HI> and they term'd themselves <HI>Iews,</HI> or
of <HI>India,</HI> by reason they Preach'd that Law or Doctrine which had its Origi∣nal
from <HI>India:</HI> But from what Place those <HI>Syrian</HI> Priests came, as also their
<HI>Syrian</HI> Subscriptions, these, I say, we leave to the industrious Disquisitions of
the Reverend Father <HI>Athanasius Kircher,</HI> a Person highly meriting of all An∣tiquity;
which that he may accomplish with the greater fidelity and solidity,
we have presented him the same Writing, transcrib'd in the <HI>Chinese</HI> out of the
Book by the sole pains and industry of <HI>Don Chin Andreas,</HI> a Noble <HI>Chinesian</HI>
Youth, the inseparable Companion of my Voyage to <HI>Rome,</HI> to the Apostolick
See (which Book was Imprinted and divulg'd throughout the whole Empire
by the <HI>Chinese</HI> Doctors, Men of great Fidelity and Authority) with my <HI>Latin</HI>
Translation rendred word for word; and I have laid up the Book that is al∣together
consonant to the original Monument, in the Study of the same Fa∣ther,
together with an Attestation of the Fact, by the Subscription of my own
Hand, and the Hands of those that were Natives of <HI>China,</HI> Eye-witnesses of
the Monument, as also the Transcribers of this Table from the Original.</Q></P>

<HEAD>A Paraphrastical Declaration of a Chinese Inscription, Translated
word for word out of the Chinese Language into the Portu∣guese,
out of that into Italian, and from the Italian
into the Latin Tongue.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Declaration of Xiu Piu; or, as the Commentator hath it, made by a
Priest of the Kingdom of Iudea, who was call'd Kim Lim.</HEAD>
<P>1. THis therefore I say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creatic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of all thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gs.</NOTE> That he who was always True and Undisturb'd,
being without any Beginning, of a most profound Intellect and
eternal Essence, by his most excellent Power out of Nothing created All things,
and by his Divine Wisdom made the Saints. This is that Divine Essence,
Three in Person, but One in Substance, our Lord, who being certainly Infal∣lible,
without Beginning, <HI>Olo o yu</HI> (which in the <HI>Chaldee</HI> signifies the same with
<HI>Eloba)</HI> made the four Parts of the World in form of a Cross, gathering toge∣ther
the <HI>Chaos:</HI> He form'd two <HI>Kis,</HI> that is, two Virtues or Qualities call'd
<HI>Inyam,</HI> the Commentator names them <HI>Two Principles;</HI> chang'd the Abyss, that
is, he took away the Darkness, and the Heaven and the Earth appear'd: He
form'd the Sun and Moon, that by their continual Motions they should di∣stinguish
the Night and Day: He set together and built all things. But when
he created the first Man, besides his Being, he endow'd him with Original
Righteousness, appointing him Lord of the whole Universe; which at first of
his own Nature was empty and vile, fill'd with himself, of a plain and equal
Understanding, and having no mixture of any inordinate Appetite.</P>
<P>2. But afterwards, by cunning Deceits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fall of <HI>Adam.</HI></NOTE> the Devil brought it to pass, that
<HI>Adam</HI> infected whatever was before naturally and in its self Pure and Perfect;
that is, he was the cause of sowing the Seeds of Malice (that general Disturber
of the Peace) in his Heart, whereby the equal Temper of his Uprightness was
alter'd, and Discord fraudulently introduc'd: From whence in process of
time three hundred and sixty five Sects sprung up one after another, each of
which drew to themselves as many as they could delude; some worshipping
the Creature in stead of the Creator; others made an empty Principle of all
things, and a real <HI>Ens,</HI> (to this alludes the Sect of the <HI>Pagodi</HI> and Learned <HI>Chi∣neses)</HI>
because they assert, <HI>That the Principle which produc'd all things was void; That
the same is to them subtile and undiscernable to the Senses, although in it self it be a real and
positive Principle.</HI> But others say, <HI>That the Principle of things is not only real and posi∣tive,
but that it was of such a Figure and Corpulency, as might easily be comprehended by
Sense.</HI> Some did seek Happiness by Sacrifices; others took a pride to deceive
Men under the specious shew of Goodness, using all their Skill and Industry
therein, making all their Diligence and Intentions subservient to their Affe∣ctions:
But in vain, and without any profit, did they labor, still making their
progress from bad to worse, as it happens to those that would strike Fire out of
an Earthen Vessel, they add Darkness to Darkness; and so indeed once leaving
the true Path, they can never return to the Way of Life.</P>
<P>3. Then one of the Divine Persons of the most Holy Trinity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Incarna∣tion of the Son of God.</NOTE> call'd the
<HI>Messias,</HI> by contracting and hiding his Majesty, and accommodating himself to
Humane Nature, was made Man: Wherefore, for the declaring these joyful
Tidings, he selected an Angel, and was born of a Virgin in <HI>Iudea.</HI> A great Star
also proclaim'd this Felicity, so that Kings seeing its brightness, came and
<PB N="330" REF="181"/>
offer'd Presents, that the Law and Prophesies of the twenty four Prophets
might be fulfill'd. He Govern'd the World by one great Law, founded the
Divine and Spiritual Law without any thundring Words, and confirm'd it
with the Seal of a true Faith. He pronounc'd the eight Beatitudes, turn'd
Mundane things into Eternal, open'd the Gate of the three Theological Vir∣tues,
and gave Life by destroying Death: He descended into Hell in Person,
and brought Confusion to the Devil and his Angels: He wafted Good Men
to Heaven in the Ship of his Piety, and gave Salvation to the Souls of the Iust.
These things finish'd about Noon, by his wonderful Power he ascended into
Heaven, leaving twenty seven Tomes or Volumes of his Doctrine, to open a
Way for the Conversion of the World. He Instituted Baptism by Water and
the Spirit, for the washing away of Sins, and cleansing the World: He made
use of the Cross, that he might take in all without exception, stirring up all
by the voice of Charity, commanding to worship towards the East, that they
might proceed in the Way of a Glorious Life.</P>
<P>4. His Ministers or Priests for outward Ornament sake nourish their
Beards, but shave the Crowns of their Heads, that they may shew they are
inwardly inclin'd to no Evil: They use no Servants: In Prosperity and Ad∣versity
they shew wonderful Humility, making themselves equal to the mean∣est:
They heap not up Riches, but make them all common: They observe
Fasts, as well for mortification of their Passions, as observation of the Divine
Precepts: They bear all awful Reverence to their Superiors, who are equally
as themselves retir'd from the World: Seven times a day they Pray as well for
the Living as the Dead; and one Day in seven they keep Holy, to purge their
Souls from Sin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Excellen∣cy of the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Law.</NOTE> and restore them to Purity. And because this infallible and
well-grounded Law is so excellent, it is a very difficult thing to appropriate
to it a congruous Name; for the Effects of it are to illuminate and find out
all things with the clearest perspicacity; whereupon, as necessary, it was inti∣tled
<HI>Kim kiao,</HI> that is, <HI>The Great and Perspicuous Law.</HI></P>
<P>5. The Law, where there are no Royal Persons, is neither extended nor
dilated; yet Persons Royal without the Law are not worthy of Esteem. The
Law therefore and Princes concording, and as it were meeting in one, forth∣with
the World is illuminated.</P>
<P>In this famous Time a King nam'd <HI>Tai cum veu huamti,</HI> with singular Pru∣dence
and Sanctity Governing <HI>China,</HI> there came out of <HI>Iudea</HI> a Man of very
great Virtue, stil'd <HI>Olo puen,</HI> who brought as it were from the Clouds this true
Doctrine: And driven by the Winds, by the help of Hydrographical Maps
(having sustain'd many Dangers and much Labor) at length, in the Year <HI>Chin
quon jeu sie,</HI> that is, 636. he arriv'd at the King's Palace: When the King
heard thereof, he commanded the famous <HI>Colao,</HI> call'd <HI>Fam Kien Lym,</HI> that he
should ride to meet this new Guest towards the West, that is, towards the
Suburbs of the City, and should bring him to the Palace with all Kindness
and Respect; then he directed him to declare his Doctrine there, when at
once he search'd out the Truth of the Law; whereof being satisfi'd, he seri∣ously
commanded the same to be Preach'd and Publish'd with Efficacy and
Reverence through his whole Kingdom. And in the Year 12 <HI>Cin quon 7</HI> (which
is 636.) he wrote back in this manner. The tenour of the Promulgation is as
follows:</P>
<P>The true Law hath no determinate Name, nor have the Saints any limited Place where
they remain; they run to all Parts that they may instruct the World, being intent with
<PB N="331" REF="181"/>
might and main to do good, and succour the afflicted People. Out of the far distant and re∣mote
Kingdom of <HI>Tancin,</HI> (or <HI>Iudea) Olo puen,</HI> a Man of most eminent Virtue, brought
and presented his Doctrine and certain Images to our Princely Palace: Whose Intentions to
instruct us we having examin'd to the bottom, do find his Doctrine most excellent, without
any exterior clamour, and taking its original from the Creation of the World. This Doctrine
consists not in multitude of Words, nor doth it lie only in a superficial Foundation for Truth,
but brings Profit and Salvation to Mankind: Wherefore it is meet that it be divulg'd
through our whole Empire.</P>
<P>He commanded also the <HI>Mandorin</HI> call'd <HI>Nim Fam</HI> to build a large Church,
and to officiate therein. The Author <HI>Kim Lim</HI> praises this King, for enervating
the Strength of the Monarchy of <HI>Cheu Olad iu,</HI> that is, the Head of the Sect <HI>Stai
iu,</HI> or <HI>Tansu.</HI> He departed in a black Chariot towards the West, that is, out of
<HI>China:</HI> But where the Great <HI>Tam</HI> is made famous with <HI>Tao,</HI> the Holy <HI>Gospel</HI> is
brought into <HI>China.</HI> A little after the King caus'd the Effigies of the same <HI>Olo
puen,</HI> who as we said first Preached here the <HI>Gospel,</HI> carefully and exactly to be
Painted, and so to be fastned to the Wall. This most excellent Figure shines at
the Gates of the Church, and his Memory will always be refulgent in the
World.</P>
<P>6. According to Geographers who mention those Western Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rip∣tion of the Si∣tuation of <HI>Iudea</HI> accor∣ding to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Geo∣graphers.</NOTE> and by
the Historians of the Kingdoms of <HI>Han</HI> and <HI>Guei,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Tancin</HI> (that
is <HI>Iudea)</HI> on the South is bounded by the <HI>Red-sea;</HI> on the North it hath the
<HI>Mountains of Pearls;</HI> on the West <HI>Boco das fullas</HI> (which what it is, is hard to
conjecture, but I guess it to be <HI>Carmel)</HI> bounds it; lastly, on the East it bor∣ders
on this Place <HI>Ciam fam</HI> and <HI>The Dead Water.</HI> This Land casts forth Ashes
yet hot with Fire, (perhaps he means the <HI>Asphaltick</HI> Lake) produces <HI>Balsamum,</HI>
little Gems and Carbuncles (by which he seems to mean <HI>Egypt,</HI> with the Coast
of the <HI>Red-sea,</HI> where the things aforesaid are found.) There are neither
Thieves nor Murderers, but the People live in Peace and Quietness. They ad∣mit
of no Religion into the Kingdom but the <HI>Gospel,</HI> nor do they confer any
Dignities but on Persons meriting the same by Virtue. Their Buildings are
very large. In a word, the Kingdom is famous for Poetry, Order, and good
Manners.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Docao,</HI> or <HI>Caozum, Cum</HI> the Son of <HI>Tai cum,</HI> came to the Government in
the Year of our Lord 651. Our Author <HI>Kim Lim</HI> speaks thus of him:</P>
<P><HI>Cao vim,</HI> otherwise <HI>Caozum,</HI> a very great Prince, not at all degenerating from the
Virtues of his Grandfather, was pleas'd with Honor to continue his good Intent, and also to
improve whatever his Father had begun: He commanded Churches to be built in all Pro∣vinces,
at the same time also enobling <HI>Olo puen</HI> with the Title of <HI>Bishop of the Great
Law which Governs the Kingdom of</HI> China.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Law of God was promulgated through all the ten Provinces
of <HI>China,</HI> the Kingdom enjoy'd a flourishing Peace, all the Cities were fill'd
with Churches, and the People prosper'd under the Evangelical Felicity.</P>
<P>8. In this Year call'd <HI>Ximlie,</HI> which is all one with <HI>The Year of our Lord 699.</HI>
the <HI>Bonzii,</HI> Followers of the <HI>Pagods,</HI> making use of their Strength, with a huge
clamour aloud blasphem'd our holy Law in the Place which is call'd <HI>Tum Cieu,</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Honan;</HI> and in the end of another Year call'd <HI>Sien tien,</HI>
which answers to the Year of our Lord 713. certain private Men in <HI>Sieno,</HI> the
ancient Place of <HI>Venvam,</HI> (the Commentator will have it to be <HI>Siganfu</HI> in the
Province of <HI>Xensi)</HI> were so audacious as to rail against our holy Law with
Mocks, Flouts, and opprobrious Language.</P>

9. At this time there was one of the Chief Priests (a Bishop as it should
seem) by Name <HI>Iohn,</HI> and another Man of great Virtue and Eminency, by
Name <HI>Kie Lie,</HI> with other Nobles and Persons belonging to them, no less ho∣nor'd
for their Fame, than respected for their contempt of worldly Affairs,
who began again to revive and Preach their most excellent <HI>Gospel,</HI> and to tie to∣gether
those Threds which by the malice of the Devil had been broken: And
the King <HI>Hiuen cum chi tao,</HI> who began his Reign in the Year 719. commanded
five of his Principal Officers, that they should go in Person into that Happy
House (meaning the Church) and erect Altars. Then the Pillar of the Law,
which for a short time had been laid groveling, began anew to rise and flou∣rish.
In the beginning of the Year <HI>Tien pao,</HI> being the Year of our Lord 743.
King <HI>Ota Ciam Kuen</HI> gave strict Command to <HI>Cuolie fie</HI> (an Eunuch in extraordi∣nary
Favor and Power with him) that he should carry the true Effigies of the
five Kings his Predecessors and Grandfathers, and place them in the Church,
whither also he should send an hundred Measures of Precious things for cele∣brating
the Solemnity, the Author <HI>Kim Lim</HI> saith, in honor of the said Kings.</P>
<P>10. In the third Year <HI>Tien pao,</HI> being the Year of our Lord 745. there was
in <HI>Iudea,</HI> others say <HI>India,</HI> one <HI>Kieho</HI> a Priest, who was conducted into <HI>China</HI> by
the help of the Stars, and looking upon the Sun (this was a Ceremony of those
who are admitted to speak with our Emperor) he was forthwith brought into
his Presence: But the Emperor Commanded that the Priests <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI>
with others of that Profession, and the so eminently virtuous Person <HI>Kieho,</HI>
should betake themselves to the Palace <HI>Him Kim,</HI> to worship and perform
other holy Acts of Devotion. At this time his Royal Grants were kept in Ta∣bles
in the Church, according to order richly adorn'd, and glittering with red
and blue; and the empty space was fill'd with the Royal Plume, ascending and
reaching even to the Sun. His Favors and Donations are compar'd to the
heighth of the Mountains of the South, and the abundance of his Benefits
equal to the depth of the East Sea: Reason cannot but well like a thing so ap∣prov'd
and worthy to be remembred. Therefore the King <HI>Sa Cum nen men,</HI> or
<HI>Ven min,</HI> who began to Reign in the Year 757. commanded Churches to be
built in <HI>Lim suu seu</HI> and five other Cities, by a new Proclamation. This King
was of a most acute Ingenuity, under whom a Gate of Happiness was open'd
to the whole Kingdom; and hereby all the Royal Affairs of State were Ad∣ministred,
and prosper'd with applause, rejoycing, and felicity.</P>
<P>11. The King <HI>Tai cum nen vu</HI> coming to the Throne in 764. and enjoying
the benefit of good Times, manag'd all the Affairs of the Kingdom without
any difficulty. At the Feast of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth every Year he sent certain excel∣cellent
Perfumes in a thankful remembrance, and assign'd Princely Provision
of all kinds in honor of the Ministers of that holy Law. Surely the Heaven
gives beauty and perfection to the World, which therefore produceth all things
with so liberal a Hand. This King imitated Heaven, and therefore knew it
was fit to nourish and preserve his own.</P>
<P>12. The King <HI>Kien cium xim ven vu,</HI> in the Year 781. us'd eight ways of re∣warding
the Good, and chastising the Bad. He set forth new Orders for re∣storing
and promoting the <HI>Gospel.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effect of the <HI>Gospel</HI> and Law of <HI>Christ</HI></NOTE> His Government was full of Excellency.
We Pray to God for him, not blushing thereat. He was eminent for Virtue,
Peaceable, and Learned: He lov'd his Neighbor, abounded with Charity to
help all, and was a great Benefactor to all then living. This is the true Way
and the Scale of our holy Law, to cause that the Winds and the Rain return
<PB N="333" REF="182"/>
at their wonted Seasons, that the World be quiet, Men well Govern'd, Affairs
orderly dispos'd, such as yet are on Earth live well, and those that are decea∣sed
enjoy Rest and Peace: To have these things in readiness, and be able to
give an Account thereof, proceeds really from our holy <HI>Faith,</HI> and are Effects
of the Strength and Power of our most sacred <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>13. The King gave to the Priest call'd <HI>Usa,</HI> and one of the Chief Preachers
of the Law, these Titles, <HI>Kin ju, quam lo tai fu,</HI> being an Office in the Court,
and <HI>Sou fum cie, tu fu lei,</HI> being an Office without the Court, and <HI>Xi tien thum
Kien,</HI> another Office also (but the Explication thereof we have not found in
the Exemplar.) He gave also to the said Priest and Preacher of the Great
Law, a Vestment of blue Colour (which the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>di color pavonazo.)</HI>
This Priest was inclin'd to Peace, rejoyc'd to do good to others, with all his
Endeavors striving to do Acts of Charity: He came into <HI>China</HI> from a remote
Country and Place call'd <HI>Vam xi ciu chim,</HI> being Heathenish, which is the same
as the far distant <HI>India:</HI> He perfectly taught several Sciences, and his Acts
were famous through <HI>China</HI> for above three Generations: At the beginning
he waited upon the King in his Court, and afterwards his Name was Entred
in the King's Record or Chronicle.</P>
<P>14. The Governor <HI>Fuen Yam,</HI> call'd also <HI>Co cu y,</HI> and enobled with the Title
of <HI>Chum Xulim,</HI> at first only minded his Military Affairs in the Parts of <HI>Sofam;</HI>
but the King <HI>So cum,</HI> commanded <HI>Ay su,</HI> or <HI>Y su,</HI> that he should promote <HI>Co cuy</HI>
with more favor than the rest (it seems the King commanded <HI>Ay su</HI> to make
him a Councellor) for although his Captain lov'd him extraordinarily, yet
he did not like his ordinary method of proceeding; for (as the <HI>Chineses</HI> speak)
<HI>An Army is the Teeth and Nails, the Eyes and Ears of the Commonwealth.</HI> He knew how
to distribute his Revenues, and not hoard them up at home: He offer'd to the
Church a Precious thing call'd <HI>Poli</HI> (made of Glass as it seems) the People of
this Place name it <HI>Cim reguen,</HI> others <HI>Lintiguen.</HI> Besides, he bestow'd Tape∣stries
of these Parts interwoven with Gold, call'd <HI>Cie Ki,</HI> repair'd the Churches
in such manner, that he seem'd to have founded them anew: He appointed a
Court and House for the reading of the Law, beautifying and adorning Hos∣pitals
and Places of Receipt. Over and above these Exercises of our holy
Law, he was very much given to Works of Charity, every year calling toge∣ther
the four Priests of the Churches, to whom he cordially perform'd all Of∣fices
of Love and Service, he provided them with all necessary things for the
space of fifty days; he Fed such as were hungry, Cloth'd such as were naked,
took care of such as were Sick and Weak, and buried the Dead.</P>
<P>15. In the time of <HI>Ta so</HI> there was no such Goodness heard of with all his
Parsimony (this <HI>Ta so</HI> was a <HI>Bonzius,</HI> a <HI>Pagan</HI> kind of Priest) who in a great
Assembly of the <HI>Bonzii,</HI> wherein was to be consulted concerning the Affairs of
their Sect, he undertook the Office of receiving Strangers, and procuring every
one all things necessary. (Therefore the Author in handling the Works of
Charity of <HI>Oy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie,</HI> places him before <HI>Ta so.)</HI> But although this was a Time in
which the <HI>Gospel</HI> was Preach'd, yet we see there were Men void of Good Works:
Wherefore, that such heroick and noble Deeds may be declar'd and set in open
view, I have caus'd the same to be Engraven upon this great Stone.</P>
<P>16. I say therefore, That the true God is without any Beginning, Pure,
Peaceable, and Unchangeable: He was the first Creator of All things; he
discover'd the Earth, and lifted up the Heaven. One of the Persons, for
the Eternal Salvation of Mankind, was made Man; he ascended into Hea∣ven
<PB N="334" REF="183"/>
like the Sun, destroying Darkness, and in all things establishing a pro∣found
Verity.</P>
<P>17. This most Glorious King, who most truly is the Chief King of Kings,
takes away all difficulty, using his own time: The Heaven was stretch'd out,
and the Earth extended. Most noble is our <HI>Gospel</HI> brought into the Kingdom
of <HI>Tam,</HI> asserting Knowledge, erecting Churches, and being both to the Li∣ving
and the Dead as a Refuge or Guide; and which exalting all Felicity, re∣stor'd
Peace to the whole Universe.</P>
<P>18. <HI>Cao Cum</HI> continuing in the Footsteps of his Grandfather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The building of Churches.</NOTE> gave his Mind
to the new building of Churches, so that with their loftiness and magnificence
they fill'd the Land; but the truth of this Law is its greatest Beauty: He be∣stow'd
on the Bishop a Title of Honor, and the People enjoy'd a mirthful
Peace without any irksom Toil.</P>
<P>19. The wise King <HI>Ni ven cum</HI> understood how to persevere in the true and
right Way; the Tables of the Kings were magnificent and illustrious; the
Royal Grants therein flourish'd and were resplendent, their Figures glitter'd:
All the People highly reverenc'd them, all things were improv'd, and from
hence all enjoy'd the Perfection of Happiness.</P>
<P>20. This King <HI>So cum</HI> then Reigning, came to the Church in proper Person:
The Sun of Sanctity shin'd, and the enlightned Clouds dispell'd Darkness and
Obscurity: Thus Felicity being accumulated in the King's House, all Vice
was banish'd, and our Empire restor'd by the taking away of Dissention.</P>
<P>21. The King <HI>Tai cum fu</HI> was Obedient; for Virtue he might compare
with the Heaven and Earth; he added as it were a Life to the People, and
made all things thrive: He sent sweet Perfumes for the giving of Thanks,
and exercis'd Works of Charity: The Sun and the Moon were united in one
Person, that is, all flew to perform their Duty and Obedience to him.</P>
<P>22. The King <HI>Kien cum</HI> being setled in the Government, shew'd himself
most virtuous; he pacifi'd the four Seas by force of Arms; he illustrated ten
thousand in his Confines by Literature; illuminated the Secrets of Men like a
Candle, and as it were in a Looking-glass seeing all things, reviv'd the whole
World; so that even barbarous People took from his Example a Rule to
live by.</P>
<P>23. O how great! how perfect! and extending it self to all things, is this
Law! Willing to give a Name thereto, I could call it no other than <HI>The Divine
Law.</HI> Former Kings were not to seek how to dispose of their Affairs: I a Vas∣sal
am only able to declare them, and therefore I erect this most precious and
wealthy Stone, to be the Proclaimer of this excceeding Felicity.</P>
<P>24. In the Empire of the Great <HI>Tam,</HI> in the second Year of this <HI>Kien cum,</HI> in
the Year of our Lord 782. on the seventh Day of the Autumnal Month, being
<HI>Sunday</HI> (or to say better, <HI>The Lord's Day)</HI> this Stone was erected, <HI>Him ciu</HI> being
then Bishop of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Church. The <HI>Mandorin,</HI> by Name <HI>Lieu sieci yen,</HI> but
by Title <HI>Ciao y cum,</HI> or as others, <HI>Chio y lam</HI> (in which Office before him was <HI>Tai
cieu sie su Can Kiun)</HI> made this Inscription with his own Hand.</P>
<P>And this is the Explication of the Inscription Engrav'd on the Stone; in
which this truly is worthy of great admiration, That the relation of so great
a variety and multiplicity of Affairs and things as this Stone contains, could be
compris'd in so narrow a space, and written with so few as eighteen thousand
Characters.</P>
<P>Of this Writing there was a double Interpretation made; this present is
<PB N="335" REF="183"/>
most conformable to that which was made at <HI>Peking,</HI> and afterwards again by
<HI>P. Michael Boim</HI> expos'd from the <HI>Chinese</HI> Exemplar, being indeed more elegant
and proper, and likewise more conformable to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language; and al∣though
for that cause it seems less polite in our Tongue, yet nevertheless is it
most eloquent, and having respect to the Phrase and Style of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Speech,
is by such as profess themselves Masters in the understanding of that Tongue,
judg'd the most deserving Praise of all others. Now it is collected from this
Monument, That the Law of <HI>Christ</HI> was above a thousand years ago brought
into <HI>China;</HI> also with what Reverence and Honor it was receiv'd by the Em∣perors;
how and through what vast Provinces it was Preach'd; how in the
space of a hundred and fifty years, wherein it chiefly flourish'd, it was spread
abroad; what Persecutions it twice suffer'd, and how by little and little it was
so suppress'd, that unless the remembrance had been preserv'd in this Monu∣ment,
no Footsteps thereof could have been trac'd; for in all the <HI>Chinese</HI> Chro∣nicles,
besides the Names of the Kings and <HI>Mandorins,</HI> that then liv'd, there
is hardly any mention of it, or any other Matters of those Times. And
this Stone was found a few years before the Fathers of the Society of <HI>Iesus</HI> ar∣riv'd
in <HI>China:</HI> From whence it appears, That the Interpretation of such sub∣lime
and notable things was only reserv'd to them, who being eminently in∣structed
in the Science as well of Humane as Divine Matters, were to become
the Preachers and Propagators of the same Law and Doctrine, almost oblite∣rated
by the all-devouring Teeth of Time. And this may suffice concerning
the Inscription in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Interpretation of the Syriack Names inscrib'd upon
the Monument.</HEAD>
<P>NOW we proceed to the Inscription that is Insculp'd on the Margins;
which seeing it hath remain'd unexplain'd hitherto, by reason of the
want of Men in <HI>China</HI> that are vers'd in those Characters, and for that
very cause was sent into <HI>Europe</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Fathers of our Society, to be
explicated by Persons skill'd in the <HI>Syrian</HI> Language; I first of all undertook
the Interpretation thereof, and that with good success, discharging the same
with equal fidelity and diligence. Now it is Engrav'd on the Margins of the
Stone in the ancient <HI>Syriack</HI> Characters that are term'd <HI>Estrangelo,</HI> and it con∣taineth
the Year, the Names, and Offices of those Apostolical Men, and Pro∣moters
of the Divine Law, that were then in <HI>China</HI> when the Stone was erected.
Father <HI>Emanuel Dias,</HI> in a certain Letter written in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue, Da∣ted
from <HI>Maccao,</HI> August 23. 1625. taketh notice of this Stone, and of the In∣scriptions
mention'd; His words translated are these:</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xensi</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> where now <HI>Trigautius</HI> resideth, a certain Stone
of about twenty four Hands breath was digg'd up; in which is manifestly apparent, that
above a thousand two hundred and forty three years since there were <HI>Christians</HI> with
shaven Crowns, that Preach'd the Mystery of the <HI>Trinity</HI> and <HI>Incarnation,</HI> and that the
Kings of <HI>China</HI> conferr'd many Favors on them. Doctor <HI>Leo</HI> desir'd to have the whole
Matter Printed, first transcrib'd by the <HI>Mandorins</HI> that were <HI>Christians,</HI> to shew all
the Mysteries contain'd on the Stone, that the same might more plainly appear. At present
<PB N="336" REF="184"/>
we only endeavor that the Matter may come to the knowledge of the Emperor. God prosper
all to his own Glory.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Francis Hurtado,</HI> from the Province of <HI>Nancheu,</HI> also confirmeth this,
and addeth, <Q>That in the same Year a Passage was open'd into the new Pro∣vinces
of the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> viz. <HI>Xensi, Xansi, Fohum;</HI> which last is con∣terminate
with <HI>Couchinchina,</HI> and easily admitteth of Strangers.</Q> And thus
proceeding says, <Q>Unto these were annexed ten or twelve Lines in <HI>Syriack,</HI>
which I could not Interpret; also the Priviledges granted by the Kings of
<HI>China</HI> to the Priests of that Law were adjoin'd. The Version was made
word for word out of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language. There were also other Trans∣lations,
but they all agree in the Essential Matters. It is Recorded in the
Books of the Kings of <HI>China,</HI> that the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> arriv'd amongst the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI>
above 994 years since, and that this Inscription was made 140 years
after its entrance.</Q> Thus Father <HI>Emanuel Dias.</HI></P>
<P>But in other Letters of a more later Date, from <HI>Maccao 21 Novemb.</HI> 1627.
we find it thus written concerning this City: <Q>Some years since there was
found a very long and ancient Writing Engraven on a Stone in the <HI>Chines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
and <HI>Chaldean,</HI> or <HI>Syrian</HI> Language; from whence it is evident, That the <HI>Law</HI>
of our Lord and Saviour arriv'd amongst the <HI>Chineses</HI> about a thousand years
since, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 636. Now the Stone was erected and inscrib'd <HI>Anno</HI> 782.
that is a hundred and forty six years after the Preaching of the <HI>Gospel</HI> there,
by which a great Conversion unto the Faith was wrought, Churches were
built, and Bishops constituted. The Kings that Govern'd at that time are
reckon'd about eight, whose Names are express'd in that Stone, and who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll
of them favor'd the <HI>Christians:</HI> Now the Preachers of this <HI>Law</HI> came out of
<HI>Palestine,</HI> and other adjoining Places. It containeth the chief Misteries of our
<HI>Faith,</HI> which are manifest from the Inscription.</Q> All which are largely evi∣dent
from the foremention'd Testimonies of Father <HI>Boim, Martinius,</HI> and <HI>Daniel
Bartolus,</HI> which were collected from the Study of the Colledge of our Society.
But I think it will be worth our time to produce this <HI>Syrian</HI> Inscription in the
same <HI>Strangelick</HI> Characters in which it was express'd in <HI>China,</HI> together with
the Interpretation; especially seeing the Fathers of our Society in <HI>China</HI> there∣fore
sent it hither into <HI>Europe</HI> in a particular Folio, Printed in <HI>China</HI> by the Ma∣sters
of that Language, for a better Explanation of it: For this being Ex∣plain'd,
I hope it will so come to pass, that both the Day, the Names, the
Country, and the Offices of the Preachers of the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> and finally our
Design, will the more evidently be discover'd.</P>
<P>The Inscription of the <HI>Syriack</HI> Names is two-fold; one of them Sculp'd on
the Margin, the other on the Foot of the Monument: And because this latter
containeth the Year of its Erection, we shall begin the Thred of our Exposi∣tion
from it. The <HI>Syrian</HI> Inscription is as followeth:</P>

about the Year of the Erection of this Stone; for the Year of this Stone

a few Persons being perplex'd with the diversity, alledg'd their Doubts unto
me concerning the true and faithful Interpretation of the Monument: for the

the Birth of <HI>Christ;</HI> but the <HI>Syriack</HI> Inscription fixeth the time, according

from the other Accompt, is easie to be discover'd by any one. Now that all

same with those that are otherwise call'd by the <HI>Chaldeans, The Years of the Sele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cians,

of Alexander;</HI> by the <HI>Arabians</HI> they are term'd <HI>Dhul Karnain,</HI> which is as much as
to say, <HI>Of Alexander holding of two Horns,</HI> (and they therefore call him so, either
(as <HI>Christmannus</HI> will have it) because that he subdu'd both the Oriental and
Occidental Parts of the World; or, as I suppose more probably, from <HI>Iupiter
Ammon,</HI> who was figur'd with the Head of a Ram, whose Son <HI>Alexander</HI> would
be esteem'd; or, in relation unto the he-Goat, unto which <HI>Daniel</HI> compareth
him) or lastly, they are call'd <HI>The Years of Philip</HI> (which I have shew'd above
to be call'd by <HI>Albategnius, Tarich Alkupti)</HI> and the <HI>Epocha</HI> of those Years beginneth
12 Years compleat after the Decease of <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> as St. <HI>Hierome</HI> obser∣veth
out of <HI>Eusebius,</HI> on <HI>Daniel, cap. 9.</HI> who is follow'd herein by <HI>Ribera, Torniellus</HI>
and others. Now although before <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> these Years seem to have had
another form, and another beginning of their Month, yet notwithstanding,
by the common Supputation they take their Entrance from the <HI>Calends</HI> of <HI>Octo∣ber.</HI>
The Names of the Months are either <HI>Greek,</HI> or <HI>Syro-Chaldean;</HI> in other re∣spects
they agree with the quantity and form of the <HI>Iulian</HI> Year, only that the
Intercalary Day is added in this <HI>Epocha</HI> or Accompt, unto the Month <HI>Sab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th,</HI>
which is answerable unto our Month of <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>These things being noted beforehand, we place the beginning of the <HI>Gre∣cian</HI>
Empire, by the consent of <HI>Eusebius, Scaliger,</HI> and others, in the Year cur∣rent,
before the Year of the <HI>Christian Epocha</HI> or Accompt 310. in the 117<SUP>th</SUP> <HI>Olym∣piad,</HI>
according unto the Chronicle of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> for it is agreed upon by all,
<PB N="339" REF="185"/>
that <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> died in that very year in which the 114<SUP>th</SUP> <HI>Olympiad</HI> be∣gan,
in the latter end of the Month <HI>Hecatombaeon,</HI> as <HI>Plutarch</HI> writeth, <HI>viz.</HI> be∣fore
the <HI>Christian</HI> Accompt 322. (for <HI>Christ</HI> was born in the third year of the
194<SUP>th</SUP> <HI>Olympiad</HI> consider'd exclusively) therefore the years of the Kingdoms of
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> beginning or taking place from the year of <HI>Christ</HI> 310. going on do
differ, so that the year 310 of the Kingdom of the <HI>Grecians</HI> beginneth from the
first year of <HI>Christ;</HI> whence it cometh to pass, that if you add 310 unto the
year of <HI>Christ</HI> propos'd, the beginning year of <HI>Alexander</HI> will arise in the very
year of <HI>Christ</HI> that is current, or going on; and if you substract 310 from the
year of <HI>Alexander,</HI> the year of <HI>Christ</HI> remaineth, in which that year of <HI>Alexan∣der</HI>
is discover'd; and finally, if the year of <HI>Alexander</HI> be substracted from 310.
the number remaining will shew the year before the <HI>Christian Epocha</HI> or Ac∣compt,
in which the year of the <HI>Grecians</HI> began, or in which the <HI>Aera</HI> or
Compute of <HI>Alexander</HI> had its beginning; which Compute the <HI>Arabians</HI> and
<HI>Egyptians</HI> call <HI>Tarich Dhul Karnain.</HI></P>
<P>This being thus demonstrated, if you substract 310 (which is the difference
between the year of <HI>Christ</HI> and the year of <HI>Alexander)</HI> from the <HI>Grecian</HI> or <HI>Alexan∣drian</HI>
year 1092. that is Engraven in <HI>Syriack</HI> Characters on the Stone, there will
remain 782. which is the year of <HI>Christ</HI> Insculp'd on the Stone in <HI>Chinesian</HI> Cha∣racters,

<P>This being thus laid down, substract the number <HI>B.</HI> from the number <HI>C.</HI>
and you have the difference of the aforesaid <HI>Olympiads,</HI> viz. 77 <HI>Olympiads,</HI> which
being reduc'd into years, each <HI>Olympiad</HI> consisting of four years, the Product
will be 308. and unto those add the two years compleated of the <HI>Olympiad</HI> in
which <HI>Christ</HI> was born, and they will make 310. which being substracted from
1092. there remaineth <HI>E.</HI> the number of the years of <HI>Christ</HI> in which the Stone
was erected. Wherefore with good advisement they Engrav'd this two-fold
Computation of Time upon this Stone, that so such Strangers as understood

and with which perhaps they might be better acquainted.</P>
<P>From hence it is also manifest, that the <HI>Syrian,</HI> or <HI>Chaldean</HI> Tongue in those
Times was common to the Churches of <HI>Syria, Palestine, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Babylon,</HI> yea
peculiar to them in <HI>Christ</HI>'s time; so that it is no wonder that the <HI>Gospel</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI>
immediately after the Travels of the Apostles throughout the whole World,
was carried not only into the most remote Regions of the East, but also into
the adjacent Regions of <HI>Babylon, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> where, as if in the native
Birth-places of the Church, the <HI>Syrian</HI> or <HI>Chaldean</HI> Tongue took such root, that
it was thereby spread throughout all the Coasts of <HI>India,</HI> as I have said before,

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Eeing that at this very Day in <HI>India, China,</HI> and other
Regions of <HI>Asia,</HI> there are yet remaining frequent foot∣steps
of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> as I have shew'n even
now, I think it will be worth while, if (having Ex∣plain'd
the <HI>Syro-Chaldean</HI> Monument found in <HI>China)</HI> I
now give a brief Account by what way and occasion
these Apostolical Persons penetrated into those most
remote Quarters of the World; for having accom∣plish'd
this, it will clearly appear, that at all times <HI>Syria, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Grecia,</HI> have
been a Seminary, not only of promoting the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> in the far distant
Regions; but also before the coming of <HI>Christ,</HI> they were the Propagators of
all Superstition throughout the World. And that I may proceed with the more
clearness in a Matter so abstruse, I shall first here set down the Opinions of
some concerning them; so that those things being discussed, it may more
evidently appear what ought to be resolv'd concerning the Matter propos'd.</P>
<P>First therefore, there are some Persons who assert, That these Colonies of
the <HI>Christians</HI> first of all entred <HI>China,</HI> and the other Regions of <HI>Asia,</HI> by the assi∣stance
of that great <HI>Asiatick</HI> Emperor usually term'd <HI>Presbyter Iohn:</HI> But then
again, seeing that this is a great Controversie amongst Authors concerning
this Emperor, and the Situation, Quality, and Condition of his Kingdom or
Empire, I shall in the first place alledge something concerning this Prince and
his Dominions, for the more clear Explication of the Matter or Subject, al∣beit
I have already treated of the same in my <HI>Prodromus Coptus.</HI></P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<PB N="342" REF="187"/>
<HEAD>Who was that famous Presbyter Iohn, and whether there ever
were such an Emmperor</HEAD>
<P>NOw therefore, as the Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> were at first call'd <HI>Pharaohs,</HI> and
afterwards <HI>Ptolemyes;</HI> those of <HI>Mauritania, Seriphii;</HI> those of the <HI>Persi∣ans,</HI>
formerly <HI>Xerxes, Artaxerxes,</HI> and now <HI>Sophi;</HI> so the Name of <HI>Pres∣byter Iohn</HI>
hath now for a long time denoted the Dignity of some <HI>Christian</HI> Prince
whose Dominions are plac'd, by consent of the most knowing Persons, not
amongst the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> or in any part of <HI>Africa,</HI> as some falsly suppose, but in
the Continent of <HI>Asia;</HI> yet in what Place he Rul'd, is not exactly known.
Now some Writers affirming that they were the Kings of <HI>Cathay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Presbyter Iohn,</HI> where he inhabited.</NOTE> have thereby
rendred the Matter more doubtful, seeing it hath been discover'd in these lat∣ter
Years, that all <HI>Cathay</HI> belongeth unto <HI>China,</HI> and that there is no City or
Territory call'd by this Name, that is now found without the Bounds of <HI>China.</HI>
And in this all the Fathers of our Society, who have continu'd in <HI>China</HI> for ma∣ny
years, do agree, who are Persons very well skill'd in Geographical Know∣ledge;
as <HI>Matthew Riccius, Nicholas Trigautius, Alvarus Samedus, Michael Boi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
Martin Martinius, Iohn Gruberus,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Adams,</HI> that great <HI>Mandorin</HI> of the King∣dom
of <HI>China;</HI> and lastly <HI>Benedict Goes</HI> of the same Society, who by order
from his Superiors travell'd from the Kingdom of <HI>Magor</HI> purposely to find out
<HI>Cathay</HI> by a Land-Voyage. I believe that it is not far wide of the Truth, that
besides that portion of Land, which by the Name of <HI>Cathay</HI> was found by the
Fathers of our Society within the Limits of <HI>China,</HI> there is another Quarter of
the World much larger, conterminate on the North and West unto the Em∣pire
of <HI>China.</HI> But seeing that all that Region without the Walls of <HI>China,</HI> is a
Desart almost of two Months travel, incultivated, and destitute of Inhabitants,
it is probable that the Region of <HI>China,</HI> in latter Times, as being very much
manur'd, and abounding in all things, might properly be call'd <HI>Cathay:</HI> And
that the Desart at this day call'd <HI>Kalmuk,</HI> and the Regions confining on it with∣out
the Walls, in former Ages had the Name of <HI>Cathay the Desart;</HI> in the ad∣joining
Kingdoms of which, that same <HI>Presbyter Iohn,</HI> of whom even now we
treated, Rul'd in the days of our Ancestors: <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> termeth it
<HI>The Empire of the Great Cham;</HI> the Holy Scriptures, (as <HI>Arias Montanus</HI> will have
it) <HI>Gog and Magog;</HI> concerning which, thus writeth <HI>Sybilla:</HI>
<Q><L>Heu tibi Gogque, Magogque, aliisque ex ordine cunctis,</L>
<L>Marson atque Angon tibi quot mala fata propinquant!</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Now that this is the</HI> Scythian Cathay, <HI>is shew'd by the</HI> Arabick <HI>Geographer,
throughout the four entire last Climates, where he describeth it to abound in
Men, Animals, and Minerals, flourishing with</HI> Christians, <HI>meer'd and inclos'd
with the vast extended Skirts of</HI> Caucasus, <HI>call'd</HI> Iagog <HI>and</HI> Magog. <HI>Thus the</HI> Ara∣bian
<HI>Geographer in his ninth Part, Climate 5. Line 21. his words are to this
effect, as I have translated them out of the</HI> Arabick: From the Mansion <HI>Gerrada,</HI>
to the City <HI>Tahamet,</HI> on the South Quarter are four <HI>Leucae</HI> (whereof one maketh twenty
five Miles) from the City <HI>Geerada</HI> even unto the Mountain which is call'd <HI>Caucasus,</HI> is
seven days travel. And this Mountain encompasseth the Regions of <HI>Iagog</HI> and <HI>Magog.</HI>
It hath such craggy and difficult sides, that none can ascend it, and if any one doth attempt
it, he can never arrive at the top, being obstructed by continual Snows congeal'd into Ice;
which because they are never dissolv'd, represent the similude of a Mist, or thick Cloud per∣petually
<PB N="343" REF="187"/>
fix'd on the top of the mountainous <HI>Caucasian</HI> Rocks. On the other side the Moun∣tain
are many Cities of <HI>Iagog</HI> and <HI>Magog.</HI> And it often hapneth, that the Inhabitants
of this Region, out of a certain curiosity, ascend some part of it, to discover what is on the
top of the Mountain, and what is beyond, but many never return, either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecause they are
devour'd by wild Beasts, or taken by the Transmountainers; but some that have return'd
safe, relate, That in the Region on the other side of the Mountain in the Night are many
Fires, but in the Day nothing else but a thick Cloud mix'd with Darkness is discover'd.
<HI>Also in the seventh Part of the same Climate, Line 34. he adds,</HI> In these Regi∣ons
many <HI>Christians</HI> or <HI>Nazaraeans</HI> do inhabit. <HI>And in the eighth Part, Line 18.
he saith,</HI> That a great quantity of Gold is gather'd out of these Mountains, and divers
sorts of Precious Stones, and that there is a great Monarch that Ruleth over these Coun∣tries:
<HI>All which are agreeable to the Empire of the</HI> Great Cham, <HI>as</HI> Marcus Pau∣lus
Venetus, <HI>an Eye-witness, in his first Book, Chap. 64. delivereth in these
words:</HI> Departing from the Province of <HI>Egriaia</HI> towards the East, the Way leadeth unto
<HI>Tenduc,</HI> (it is better to read it <HI>Tanchut,) [Now</HI> Tanchut <HI>is a Kingdom of</HI> Tartary,
<HI>which comprehendeth many other Kingdoms, as the Kingdom of</HI> Lasa, <HI>or that
which the</HI> Tartars <HI>call</HI> Barantola, <HI>the Kingdoms of</HI> Nethel, Tibeth, Maranga, <HI>and
others, as I shall shew anon, together with the Desart</HI> Kalmack, <HI>which is bound∣ed
by the Wall of the</HI> Chineses: <HI>and most Geographers confound this Kingdom
with</HI> Cathay] in which are many Cities, and Tents, where also that great Emperor, term'd,
<HI>Presbyter Iohn,</HI> so famous throughout the whole World, was wont to reside. But now
that Province is Tributary to the Great Cham, having a King of the Progeny of <HI>Presbyter
Iohn:</HI> and although there are many <HI>Idolaters</HI> and <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> yet the greatest part of
the Province embraceth the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> and these <HI>Christians</HI> are the Chief in this
Province; especially there is a certain Nation in the Province call'd <HI>Argon,</HI> which is more
subtle and eloquent than the other People; here are also the Regions of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI>
which they term <HI>Lug</HI> and <HI>Mongug;</HI> in these Places is found the Stone <HI>Lazuli,</HI> that ma∣keth
the best Azure: In these Mountains also are great Provinces, Mines of Silver, and
various sorts of wild Beasts. <HI>All which aptly consent with the Description of
the</HI> Arabick <HI>Geographer before alledg'd. Also he thus writeth concerning the
Altitude of the Mountains</HI> Iagog <HI>and</HI> Magog, <HI>in his first Book, Chap.</HI> 27. Hence
if you travel to the Eastern Quarter, you must ascend for three whole Days up the steep
Rocks of <HI>Caucasus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Belor</HI> a most high Moun∣tain.</NOTE> until you come to a most high Mountain, than which there is not an
higher in the World; and there also appeareth no Bird, by reason of the Cold, and the over
high Elevation of the Earth, which can afford no Food unto Animals. And if at any time
Fire he kindled there, it becometh not light, it being obstructed by the over-much coldness of
the Region, neither is it of that activity as in lower Places. <HI>And a little after he saith,</HI>
This Region is call'd <HI>Belor,</HI> always having the face of Winter stamp'd on it. <HI>Thus far</HI>
Marcus Paulus. <HI>All which agree unto that Mountain, which they call</HI> Langur,
<HI>the highest Mountain in the Kingdom of</HI> Lasa; <HI>concerning which Father</HI> Iohn
Gruberus, <HI>who travell'd through it on foot, relateth, that you cannot travel
through it in Summer without danger, both by reason of the great subtilty of
the Air, which hardly admitteth a Passenger to breathe, and also because of the
Vapor of a certain poisonous Herb, which by its scent killeth both Man and
Beast. And about this Kingdom of</HI> Belor, viz. <HI>the ancient Seat of the</HI> Sacae, <HI>the</HI>
Arabian <HI>Geographer placeth the principal Kingdom of</HI> Presbyter Iohn <HI>in</HI> Cathay;
<HI>as the Tractate written by</HI> Rabbi Abraham Pizol <HI>doth also clearly demonstrate:
The</HI> Nubian, <HI>or</HI> Arabick <HI>Geographer calleth it</HI> Begarger, <HI>in which he saith there
is situate a very great City; his words are these:</HI> In the Eastern part of it is the
Kingdom of <HI>Begarger,</HI> the great City of which is call'd <HI>Centaba,</HI> fortifi'd with twelve
<PB N="344" REF="188"/>
Iron Gates. Rabbi Pizol <HI>with</HI> Paulus Venetus <HI>calleth it</HI> Belor, <HI>in which he saith
the Kingdom of</HI> Thebeth <HI>was lately discover'd; his words are as followeth:</HI>
The Kingdom of <HI>Belor</HI> is very great and mighty, according unto all Historians that have
written of it; there are many <HI>Iews</HI> inhabiting in it, principally in the Eastern and Nor∣thern
Quarters: And there are moreover other Eastern People not long since discover'd,
call'd by the Natives <HI>Thebeth,</HI> having a most splendid and magnificent City exceeding all
others in magnitude, there being not the like under the Canopy of Heaven, in which all good
things are found. <HI>Which indeed can be no other than the City</HI> Chaparangue, <HI>situ∣ate
in the Kingdom of</HI> Thebeth, <HI>concerning the Monuments of which, in rela∣tion
unto our Religion, there left by the</HI> Christians, <HI>Father</HI> Anthony Andradas, <HI>a</HI>
Portuguese, <HI>of the Society of</HI> Iesus, <HI>relateth Wonders; who when he had heard
that the Inhabitants thereof were professed</HI> Christians, <HI>he took a Voyage into
the same from the Kingdom of</HI> Mogor, Anno 1624. <HI>full of labor and difficulty;
in which also having discover'd the Fountains or Heads of</HI> Ganges <HI>and</HI> Indus,
<HI>he observ'd many things most worthy of Consideration and admiration, as I
have it confirm'd by</HI> Ioseph, <HI>a</HI> Christian <HI>of the</HI> Mogors <HI>Country, who at the time
of this my writing, with Father</HI> Henry Roth, <HI>Moderator of the new Converted</HI>
Christians <HI>in the Kingdom of the</HI> Mogor, <HI>is yet at</HI> Rome, <HI>strong and lusty, al∣though
eighty five years of Age, who related unto me every Particular.</HI></P>
<P>There is in the most high Mountains of <HI>Thebeth,</HI> that are perpetually co∣ver'd
with Snow, a great Lake, the Receptacle of the greatest Rivers of <HI>India,</HI>
from which <HI>Indus, Ganges, Ravi, Athec</HI> derive their Currents: Hence the River
<HI>Ganges</HI> hath its original, falling down from the most high Rocks into a low
Valley: <HI>Indus,</HI> and the other Rivers, make their Outlets through the foot of
the Mountains, as is evident from the Map. Now he affirmeth this Kingdom
to be one of those of <HI>Great Cathay,</HI> that are contain'd both without and within
the Walls of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> although the Relation be not in every respect con∣formable
unto that perform'd by <HI>Benedict Goes</HI> of our Society, which he un∣dertook
by order of his Superiors, as we shall see anon.</P>
<P>And in these vast Regions of <HI>Cathay</HI> I find by the Relation of <HI>Paulus Venetus,</HI>
that most Potent Emperor <HI>Presbyter Iohn</HI> to have had subject unto his Domini∣ons
seventy two Kings, partly <HI>Christians,</HI> and partly <HI>Heathens;</HI> although the si∣militude
of the Kingdoms in those vast Regions, and the Names arising from
the various Revolutions of those Nations, the Tumults of War, and the other
changes of Affairs, together with the different Denomination, hath caus'd such
and so great a Confusion, that to this very Day no Person hath been able to
free himself out of this intricate Labyrinth; for some make him the same
with the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> others call him <HI>Ascid,</HI> by Original a <HI>Persian;</HI> so <HI>Almachin,</HI>
in the third Book and fourth Chapter of his History of the <HI>Saracens: Every
King,</HI> saith he, <HI>of</HI> Pharanga (so they call the City of <HI>Sogdiana) is call'd</HI> Ascid, <HI>as
the</HI> Roman <HI>Emperor is call'd</HI> Caesar, <HI>and the King of the</HI> Persians, Cosrai. And
there are some, that rather by a new Name with the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> more truly than
by the old, term him <HI>Iuchanes Belul,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Precious Iohn:</HI> Others, by no
improbable Conjecture do assert, That in honor of the Prophet <HI>Ionah,</HI> who is
highly respected amongst them, all that Govern'd the Empire were so deno∣minated.
But yet in these Western Parts of the <HI>Latin</HI> Church he is termed <HI>Iohn,</HI>
with the addition of the word <HI>Presbyter,</HI> not because he was a Priest, but by rea∣son
that after the Mode and Custom of a Chief Arch-bishop, he had a Cross
carried before him, by which he declar'd himself a Defender of the <HI>Christian
Religion.</HI> Whence <HI>Scaliger</HI> supposeth him to be so call'd from the <HI>Persian</HI> word
<PB N="345" REF="188"/>
<HI>Prestegiani,</HI> which signifieth <HI>Apostolical;</HI> which the Western People misunder∣standing,
for the word <HI>Prestegiani</HI> they write <HI>Presbyter Iohn;</HI> I will add his
words: <HI>In truth</HI> (saith he) <HI>I have very often admir'd, that a Nation altogether igno∣rant
in Navigation, should be so potent both at Land and Sea, as to extend the Bounds of
their Empire from</HI> Ethiopia <HI>even unto</HI> China: <HI>for from those very Times we have had
a knowledge of that Emperor, but that under the Name of</HI> Prestegiani, <HI>in the</HI> Persian
<HI>Tongue, which is almost common over all</HI> Asia, <HI>as the</HI> Latin <HI>is with us in the West, signi∣fieth</HI>
Apostolical; <HI>by which Name it is manifest they understand a Prince that is</HI> Chri∣stian
<HI>and Orthodox; for in the</HI> Persian, Prestegiani <HI>in the plural Number signifieth</HI>
Apostles, <HI>and</HI> Prestegini, Apostolical, <HI>as</HI> Padischa Prestegini, <HI>an</HI> Apostolical
King; <HI>in the</HI> Arabick, Melek Arresuli; <HI>in the</HI> Ethiopick, Negus Havarjavi.
<HI>That the Empire of the</HI> Ethiopians <HI>was extended far and wide in</HI> Asia, <HI>is evident by the</HI>
Ethiopian <HI>Crosses which are seen in</HI> Iapan, China, <HI>and other Places; yea, and the
Temple of St.</HI> Thomas <HI>the Apostle, situate in the Region of</HI> Malabar, <HI>is wholly</HI> Ethio∣pick,
<HI>as the Crosses, the Structure, and many other things, yea, and what you will most
wonder at, the very Name.</HI> Thus far <HI>Scaliger.</HI></P>
<P>From which Discourse we may well collect, That certain Colonies were
sent out from <HI>Ethiopia</HI> into <HI>India, China,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> which propaga∣ted
the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> in those Parts, which we now endeavor to shew: but
in that he saith <HI>Presbyter Iohn</HI> was originally an <HI>African,</HI> or that being forc'd out
of <HI>Asia,</HI> he should set down in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and there Rule and Govern, is altoge∣ther
improbable, and without any foundation, as we shall see anon. Now that
this <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Asiatick</HI> Emperor were diverse, is consented unto by the greater
part of the best Authors. And the Empire of the <HI>Asiatick</HI> flourish'd for many
Years, until it fell unto one <HI>David,</HI> who, as <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> relateth, being over∣come
or vanquish'd by a certain Commander nam'd <HI>Cingis Cublai,</HI> his Uncle,
in a great Battel (who was elected Emperor by the <HI>Scythians,</HI> and in stead of
<HI>Presbyter,</HI> began to be call'd <HI>Uncam,</HI> or <HI>Naiam)</HI> unto the great loss of <HI>Christianity,</HI>
put an end both to the Glory of the Empire, and the Name of <HI>Presbyter Iohn,</HI>
as we have shew'd in the History of <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus.</HI> I shall now de∣clare
by what mistake the Name of <HI>Presbyter Iohn</HI> was given unto the Emperor
of the <HI>Abyssines</HI> or <HI>Ethiopians.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Em∣peror of the <HI>Aloyssines</HI> is called <HI>Presby∣ter Iohn.</HI></NOTE> At that time in which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> by a Mari∣time
Voyage sought after new Quarters of the Earth, the Name of <HI>Presbyter
Iohn</HI> was very famous through <HI>Europe;</HI> for he was reported to be a most po∣tent
Emperor, Lord of many Kingdoms, a <HI>Christian</HI> by Religion; but in what
Place he Rul'd, was altogether unknown: Therefore when <HI>Peter Couillan</HI> was
sent by <HI>Iohn</HI> the Second King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> first through the <HI>Mediterranean Sea,</HI>
and afterwards by a Land-Voyage, to find out this Prince, he heard in the
<HI>Asiatick India,</HI> unto which he had arriv'd, that in that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> which is beneath
<HI>Egypt,</HI> there was a certain Prince very powerful, who profess'd the <HI>Christian
Religion;</HI> he therefore betook himself to him, and when he had found many
things there with him, which were conformable unto the constant Fame that
was reported amongst the <HI>Europeans,</HI> he believ'd that that was the <HI>Presbyter Iohn</HI>
so call'd. He therefore was the first Person who began to call the Emperor of
the <HI>Abyssines</HI> by the Name of <HI>Preste Iean,</HI> that is, <HI>Presbyter Iohn:</HI> Others also in
succeeding times, who travell'd into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> imitated him, and easily intro∣duc'd
the same Error into <HI>Europe.</HI> All which is Learnedly shew'd by Father
<HI>Balthasar Tellez,</HI> in his <HI>Ethiopian</HI> History, which he hath compos'd in an elegant
and polite <HI>Portuguese</HI> Style: unto which also subscribeth <HI>Alphonsus Mendes,</HI> the
most wise Patriarch of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and the great Light of our Society, in an
<PB N="346" REF="189"/>
Epistle prefix'd unto the Work of Father <HI>Tellez</HI> concerning the <HI>Ethiopick</HI> Affairs.
Therefore when we speak of <HI>Presbyter Iohn,</HI> we understand not the Emperor of
the <HI>Abyssines;</HI> for besides that his Empire is situate very far distant from that
of the <HI>Presbyter Iohn</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> it is evident from the Chronology of the Empe∣rors
of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> which is to be seen in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library, that there is no
mention of transplanting out of <HI>Africa</HI> into <HI>Asia,</HI> or out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>Africa;</HI>
yea, <HI>Damianus a Goes,</HI> in his Book of the Manners and Customs of the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI>
doth expresly deny him to be call'd <HI>Presbyter Iohn,</HI> or that he was ever so ter∣med;
which is also asserted by the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Priests above cited: but we un∣derstand
that Great Prince of <HI>Asia,</HI> of whom we have spoken in the precedent
Discourse.</P>
<P>And certainly at this very day there remaineth some Footsteps of this for∣merly
Great <HI>Presbyter Iohn,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Tanchut,</HI> which the <HI>Tartars</HI> call
<HI>Barantola;</HI> the <HI>Saracens, Boratai;</HI> and the Natives, <HI>Lassa;</HI> as the Fathers of our
Society, <HI>Albert Dorville,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Gruberus</HI> (who travell'd through it as they re∣turn'd
from <HI>China</HI> into <HI>Europe, Anno 1661.)</HI> sufficiently testifie, who relate incre∣dible
things concerning the superstitious Adoration of this Prince.</P>
<P>Now there are in this Region two Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Barantola</HI> adored as a God.</NOTE> the first whereof hath a regard
to the Administration of the Political Government; and the other, whom
they term <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>The Celestial Father,</HI> or else <HI>The Great Lama,</HI> or <HI>High Priest, and
Pope of the Priests,</HI> remaineth in the innermost Recesses of his Palace, and re∣ceiveth
Adoration and Worship from all his People, as a Deity; and they
have him in such high Veneration, that they foolishly persuade themselves,
that the very Filth of his Body, and his Excrements, are extremely conducing
to the curing of all Distempers; whence they do not only compound and
mix them with their Medicines, but also blush not to carry them about in a
Box, fastned to, or hung about their Necks. And by reason that Mortality
cannot evade or escape the Bonds of Death, his Worshippers, that he may not
be said to perish as other Persons, (the Devil their Tutor suggesting it to them)
have found out the following Stratagem or Device: They make Inquisition
throughout all the Kingdom to find out a <HI>Lama</HI> as like as may be unto the for∣mer;
whom when they have gotten, they advance him by a clandestine and
secret Machination or Plot unto the Throne of the <HI>Eternal Father,</HI> as they call it,
pretending the feigned Deity, upon the account of his likeness to the former,
to have been rais'd from the Dead, who is now said to have been rais'd seven
times. The Reader may fully understand in the following Discourse, the
Rites and Ceremonies by which the foolish People do Adore him with a per∣petual
Veneration: And they report, that these Ceremonies and Worship had
their original from no other Person than that Prince which Authors usually
term <HI>Presbyter Iohn;</HI> whom they are certainly persuaded to have Rul'd in the
Kingdom of <HI>Tanchut,</HI> which is now included under the Dominion of the King∣dom
of <HI>Lassa:</HI> for as formerly they went in Pilgrimage from all Parts of <HI>Tar∣tary</HI>
unto him, as unto an Oracle, so at this very time they cease not from all
Parts to flock unto this ridiculous God and Father, the Head of the <HI>Lamae,</HI> to
obtain his Benediction; so that <HI>Anno 1629.</HI> that great <HI>Tartarian</HI> Monarch of
the <HI>Chineses,</HI> as soon as he had subdu'd the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> according to the
Custom practis'd by his Ancestors, was solicited by the Magistrates of <HI>Tartary,</HI>
to do Homage to the Great <HI>Lama,</HI> that is, <HI>The Priest,</HI> as to the Supreme Bishop
or Pope of the Religion of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> and the Business was brought unto
that accomplishment, that the Emperor, through the Advice of his Council,
<PB N="347" REF="189"/>
was resolv'd to meet with the Great <HI>Lama,</HI> now coming towards him even un∣to
the Walls of the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> in a Progress almost of two Months space,
if Father <HI>Iohn Adams,</HI> an intimate Associate of the Emperor, out of an extreme
hatred unto the thing, had not shew'd himself averse and opposite, and that
by the allegation of many weighty Reasons: which Persuasions of the afore∣said
Father took so good effect, that the Emperor was so far from vouchsafing
to go forwards out of the City to meet him, that he would hardly give him any
farther entrance or admission than the Garden of the Palace of <HI>Pequin;</HI> and
at length, after the usual Mode, being Presented with divers Presents, dismis∣sed
him unto his own Kingdom, wholly neglecting all those accustom'd Cere∣monies
that were usually perform'd; and he that was suppos'd to have con∣ferr'd
great Prosperity and Happiness by his Approach and Benediction,
brought the contrary Effects with him; for that ridiculous Archpriest, after
his departure, incurr'd the Curses and Malediction of all Persons, as being the
seeming Cause of Famine, Pestilence, and War.</P>
<P>But to return to our purpose;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where <HI>Pres∣byter Iohn</HI> re∣sided.</NOTE> I say therefore, That 'tis very probable this
<HI>Presbyter Iohn</HI> resided in the Kingdom of <HI>Tanchut:</HI> for he and his Successors
Ruling far and wide in <HI>Asia,</HI> and worthily promoting the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> those
Preachers of the Word of God, either being call'd, or of their own accord,
out of zeal to advance the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> or which is more likely, being com∣pell'd
by Fear, and flying from the aforesaid Places, in the time of that horrid
Persecution which began under the Empire of <HI>Dioclesian</HI> and <HI>Maximianus,</HI> in
which on the Confines of <HI>Syria, Egypt,</HI> and the adjacent Places of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the
Followers of the <HI>Christian Doctrine</HI> were every where enquir'd and sought after,
to be put to most cruel Torments; they sat down and Planted themselves in
the middle of <HI>Persia, Bactria,</HI> and <HI>Turchestan:</HI> and then it is altogether proba∣ble,
that by degrees, after long Exilement, arriv'd in the utmost Regions of
<HI>Asia:</HI> and lastly, <HI>Anno 600.</HI> in the time of the Empire of <HI>Heraclius,</HI> persidious
and debauch'd <HI>Mahomet</HI> then rebelling, new Colonies were continually trans∣planted
into the aforesaid Regions of the East. For it is manifest, that the <HI>Sy∣rian</HI>
or <HI>Babylonian</HI> Priests giving place to the fury of the <HI>Infidels,</HI> ceased not in
succession of time to propagate the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> as the alledg'd <HI>Syriack</HI> In∣scription
doth clearly shew, where <HI>Iidbuzad</HI> Bishop of <HI>China</HI> is call'd the Son
of <HI>Noah,</HI> a certain Priest of the City of <HI>Balech</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Turchestan,</HI> as
is manifest from the <HI>Syriack</HI> words above-cited, and here again repeated, <HI>viz-Anno
1902.</HI> Iidbuzad <HI>Priest and Vicar of the Bishop of the Regal City of</HI> Cumdan,
<HI>Son of</HI> Noah <HI>a Priest, Native of the City Belech in the Kingdom of</HI> Turchestan.</P>
<P>Now that <HI>Turchestan</HI> is the same Region which the <HI>Persians</HI> call <HI>Usbec,</HI> the
beginning of <HI>Great Cathay,</HI> and the City <HI>Belech</HI> seated in it, is clear from the
<HI>Arabian</HI> Geographer, <HI>Part 8. Climate 4. Line 34.</HI> where treating concerning the
<HI>Turchestians,</HI> a peculiar Province of the <HI>Corafini,</HI> he placeth the Situation of the
City <HI>Belech</HI> not far from <HI>Samarcande,</HI> the Regal Court of <HI>Great Tamberlain,</HI> for∣merly
a most famous City: his words are these, as they are Translated by me
out of the <HI>Arabick: Now this is the eighth Part of the fourth Climate, and containeth a
portion of the Region of</HI> Corasina <HI>from</HI> Karman <HI>even to</HI> Kasaralkamat <HI>fifteen Miles;
hence to</HI> Samarcande, <HI>six Miles: and it is the Road of those that pass from</HI> Samar∣cande
<HI>unto the City of</HI> Belech: <HI>Whence it is plainly manifest, that</HI> Iidbuzad <HI>Vicar of
the Bishop, term'd a</HI> Syrian <HI>by Original or Descent, was of the Country of</HI> Turchestan
<HI>or</HI> Corasine: <HI>And it is evident from the</HI> Syro-Chinesian <HI>Inscription of the Stone, that
many of the Region of the</HI> Pagodes, <HI>and other Countries of</HI> Asia, <HI>penetrated into</HI> China
<PB N="348" REF="190"/>
<HI>for the advancement of the Gospel: All which we leave farther to be enquir'd after by the
curious Reader.</HI> And thus much shall suffice concerning the Transplanting of
the Colonies in the Kingdoms of <HI>Presbyter Iohn,</HI> and in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, those who suppose that most of these Evangelical Persons first
arriv'd in <HI>India</HI> out of <HI>Syria, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and having converted that
Country by their Labors to the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> afterwards sent out some Colo∣nies
from amongst them into <HI>China,</HI> by reason of the frequent Commerce
which at that time was maintain'd by a Maritime Voyage between the <HI>Indians</HI>
and <HI>Chineses;</HI> have much more of certainty than any others for their Opinion.
And of this Expedition I shall give a clear Account in few words.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Cathay, and its proper and genuine Situation.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough in the preceding Discourse we have produc'd divers Passages
out of various Authors, both <HI>Latins, Grecians, Iews, Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Persi∣ans,</HI>
concerning the Situation of <HI>Cathay;</HI> yet here notwithstanding, for
the better elucidation and clearing of the Matter, we shall declare by divers
Voyages and Travels purposely alledg'd for that end, what at length this
Kingdom of <HI>Cathay</HI> is, and where situate.</P>
<P>It is not only evident by the diligent search of the Fathers of our Society,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>
that <HI>China</HI> is the greatest part of <HI>Cathay;</HI> but also it is most apparently prov'd
out of <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus:</HI> for he saith, <HI>That the most vast City of</HI> Cambalu,
<HI>or, as the true pronunciation of the</HI> Tartars <HI>hath it,</HI> Cambalek, <HI>was the Regal Seat of
the Great Cham.</HI> The Fathers of our Society say, That it was no other than the
modern Imperial City of <HI>China,</HI> which they call <HI>Pequin,</HI> or <HI>Pekin;</HI> and that the
vastness of the Walls made in a Quadrangular order, and the incredible big∣ness
of the City, do more than sufficiently demonstrate the same. Now <HI>Marcus
Paulus</HI> writeth, <Q>That the City of <HI>Cambalu,</HI> situate near the great River, was
anciently very Splendid and Regal; for <HI>Cambalu,</HI> signifieth <HI>The City of the
Lord:</HI> The <HI>Great Cham</HI> remov'd this City to the other side of the River; for
he learn'd from an Astrologer, that in time it would become rebellious unto
his Empire. This City being built four-square, comprehendeth in circuit
twenty four Miles, the side of every Square or Quadrate containing six
Miles: It hath Walls whited over, which are twenty Paces high, ten in
breadth, but in thickness become narrower as they ascend: Every Quadra∣ture
of these Walls hath three principal Gates, there being twelve in all,
which have each a magnificent Palace built near unto them: In the corners
also of the Wall there are noble Towers, where the Arms and Ammunition
of the City are stor'd and kept. There are Streets and Passages straight
through the City, so that there is a free Prospect from one Gate unto ano∣ther,
most beautiful Houses being Erected on either side.</Q> A little farther
he saith, <Q>That without the City of <HI>Cambalu</HI> there are twelve great Suburbs,
adjoyning unto each of the twelve Gates, in which Merchants and Stran∣gers
are continually found.</Q> All which are so agreeable unto the Princely
City of <HI>Pequin,</HI> that there is hardly any difference, as <HI>Martinius</HI> relateth, in
Page 29. of his <HI>Atlas;</HI> also the Names of the City <HI>Tadinfu, Cacanfu, Quelinfu,
Cingianfu, Sianfu,</HI> which also is now call'd <HI>Siganfu,</HI> situate not far from the <HI>Saf∣fron
<PB N="349" REF="190"/>
River,</HI> which was taken by the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> after three years Siege, by the
help of battering Engines (as yet unknown in <HI>China)</HI> which he caus'd <HI>Christian</HI>
Arrizans to make: This hapned <HI>Anno 1268.</HI> as <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> (who with
his Father <HI>Nicolas</HI> and his Uncle, that then were resident with the Emperor)
relateth. See <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> in his second Book, Chap. 58. For <HI>Fu</HI> in
the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Language signifieth nothing else but <HI>A great City,</HI> and also <HI>Ceu</HI> ad∣ded
unto other words or Names, denoteth <HI>A small or indifferent City;</HI> which
words are proper and known unto no other Region but only that of <HI>China.</HI>
Yet nothing so clearly demonstrateth <HI>China</HI> to be taken for <HI>Cathay,</HI> as the Astro∣nomical
<HI>Botanical</HI> Monuments of the <HI>Persians;</HI> which the Learned <HI>Iacobus Golius,</HI>
in his Appendix adjoin'd unto the <HI>Atlas Sinicus,</HI> hath made apparent unto us
from the Astronomical Tables of <HI>Nasirodim,</HI> a <HI>Persian</HI> Mathematician, famous
throughout the whole East; where you may plainly see the <HI>Cathaian</HI> Names of
the twelve Hours into which the natural Day is divided amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
or <HI>Cathaians,</HI> so correspondent unto the <HI>Chinesian,</HI> that they differ in nothing;
which is also testifi'd by as many of the Fathers of our Society as have return'd
from <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI> But that it may be more evident, I shall here set down
the Names.</P>

<P>If any one compare the Cycle of sixty Years, (which, as <HI>Nasirodim</HI> saith, the
<HI>Cathaians</HI> use in the Calculation or Account of their Days, Weeks, and Solary
Years,) with the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Account, he shall find the mode or form of the Com∣putation,
and the Names by which they call it, to be wholly the same: and the
like we affirm concerning the <HI>Cathaian</HI> Year, which they divide, as also the
Zodiack, into twenty four Parts, beginning their Year from the 15<SUP>th</SUP> Degree
of <HI>Aquarius.</HI> But concerning this, see the above-mention'd <HI>Golius</HI> in the place
cited before, who alledgeth <HI>Uleg Beg,</HI> a <HI>Persian</HI> Astronomer, for a Witness,
from whose Astronomical Tables he sheweth evidently whatsoever hath hi∣therto
been deliver'd from the Harmony or Agreement of the <HI>Cathaian</HI> Calcu∣lations,
or which is the same, that of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> And I also find in the <HI>Ara∣bian</HI>
Physicians, the Musk that is found in <HI>China,</HI> often call'd <HI>The Musk of Cathay;</HI>
and also that Drink which is made of a certain Herb proper to <HI>Cathay,</HI> is for
the most part term'd <HI>Cha of Cathay.</HI> And the <HI>Mogors,</HI> which are originally <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
and had their Descent from the Line or Stock of <HI>Cingis-Can,</HI> and the other
succeding potent Emperors, them, I say, I find to be so call'd (from their over∣running
of the Empire of <HI>China)</HI> by their Historians the <HI>Chinesian-Mogulos.</HI> But
what he writeth concerning <HI>Quinsai,</HI> a City of a wonderful and almost incredi∣ble
magnitude, is all found to be true at this day concerning the Metropolitan
City <HI>Hancheu,</HI> of which Father <HI>Martinius,</HI> the Author of the excellent <HI>Atlas Sini∣cus,</HI>
thus discourseth, Folio. 109.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scri∣ption of <HI>Han∣cheu</HI> or <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣sai.</HI></NOTE> <Q>That the <HI>European</HI> Cosmographers may no
longer erre in making enquiry after, and ridiculously delineating of <HI>Quinsai,</HI>
mention'd by <HI>Marcus Paulus,</HI> I shall here give the very exact Portaicture of
the same, the Shadow of which did not appear unto the Author of the
<HI>Archontologia Cosmica;</HI> and if the Divine Majesty be propitious unto my De∣sign,
<PB N="350" REF="191"/>
I shall peradventure in time send over the Theatre of the Cities of
<HI>China,</HI> Printed by the <HI>Chineses</HI> themseves, not known or seen, as I suppose, hi∣therto
in <HI>Europe.</HI> But to return to the Matter in hand; I prove first by most
invincible Arguments, that this is the same City of <HI>Quinsai</HI> mention'd by
<HI>Paulus Venetus:</HI> for this is that City which is distant the space of five days
travel from <HI>Singui,</HI> that is, <HI>Su Chou;</HI> which holdeth good, if we speak of the
Progress or March of the Army, in which it is manifest that <HI>MarcuS Paulus
Venetus</HI> was; otherwise it is scarce four days Iourney. This is that City in
which in his time was the Court or Imperial City of <HI>China,</HI> which the <HI>Chine∣ses</HI>
in the elegant Tongue of their Learned Men term <HI>Kingsu,</HI> but in the
common Speech of the vulgar sort of Men, who tie not up themselves unto
that exactness of Phrase, <HI>Kingsai,</HI> whence the term of <HI>Quinsai</HI> in <HI>Venetus</HI> had its
original. You must here note moreover, that <HI>Kingsu</HI> is a Name of Dignity
common unto Regal Cities, and not proper and singular unto one alone;
for its genuine and true signification is <HI>Regal,</HI> although oftentimes the same
City hath otherwise a proper Name; as this City is call'd <HI>Hancheu,</HI> which
under the Empire of the Family of <HI>Sunga</HI> was call'd <HI>Lingan,</HI> because the tenth
Emperor of this Family, nam'd <HI>Coacungus Kin,</HI> flying from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> there
fix'd his Court, and therefore in the time of <HI>Venetus</HI> it was call'd <HI>Kingsu,</HI>
whatever others think to the contrary. This hapned <HI>Anno 1135.</HI> And also
in the same City the Family of <HI>Sunga</HI> held the Empire, until the Western <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
under the Government of the Great <HI>Han,</HI> erected the <HI>Kin Tartars,</HI> or those
of the East out of <HI>Cathay,</HI> that is, out of the Northern Provinces, and so then
they became vanquish'd; and a little after they advanc'd their victorious
Armies into the Kingdom of <HI>Mangin,</HI> having begun a seizure of those Sou∣thern
Provinces. But to come more near to the Business: This is that Ci∣ty
which hath such a vast number of high Bridges, both within its Walls,
and without in its Suburbs; for there are almost ten thousand, as <HI>Venetus</HI>
reckoneth them, if you account the Triumphal Arches amongst the Bridges,
which by reason of their similitude he might esteem for such, by the same
mistake by which he call'd Tygers Lions, notwithstanding here are none to
be found, nor almost in all <HI>Asia;</HI> except you will have him to be understood
not only to comprehend the Bridges that are both within the City and with∣out
in the Suburbs, but also those of the whole Empire, and then indeed
their number, which otherwise will hardly gain credit amongst us, may ea∣sily
be augmented, there being so vast an abundance of Bridges and Trium∣phal
Arches every where to be found. For the greater confirmation of this
Matter, there is a Lake of forty <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, which they call <HI>Sihu,</HI> which al∣though
it be not within the Walls, yet it doth encompass it for a large space
from the West to the South, and many Channels are drawn from it into the
City; moreover, the Banks or Shores of it on every side are so beset with
Temples, Monasteries, Palaces, Libraries, and private Edifices, that you
would suppose your self to be within a most spacious City, and not in the
Country: the Margents or Banks of the Lake are rais'd in every part with
four-square and cut Stone, and a convenient Passage left for Travellers; al∣so
some Passages go clear through the Lake, furnish'd with many, and those
very high Bridges, under which Ships may pass, in passing over which, they
may to and fro encompass the Lake, whence these Bridges might easily be
reckon'd by <HI>Venetus</HI> to belong to the City. This is that City which hath a
Mountain within its Walls on the South-side, term'd <HI>Chinghoang,</HI> in which is
<PB N="351" REF="191"/>
that Tower with a Guard, where they measure the Hours by an Hour-glass,
and it is declar'd or inscrib'd on a Tablet how many Hours, in large Golden
Letters. This is that City, all whose Streets are pav'd with square Stone;
and this is situate in a Moorish place, and divided by many Navigable Chan∣nels.
Lastly, This is the City, to omit other things, from which the Em∣peror
took his flight unto the Sea by the great River <HI>Cientang,</HI> the breadth
of which exceeds a <HI>German</HI> Mile, and floweth to the South-side of the City.
So that here is the very same River which <HI>Venetus</HI> ascribeth unto <HI>Quinsai,</HI>
whence it is disembogu'd into the Sea towards the East, from which this
City is as far distant as <HI>Venetus</HI> doth affirm it. I add, That the compass of
the City is above an hundred <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, if you reckon in the large Sub∣urbs,
which extend very far on every side, whence you shall go over five
hundred <HI>Chinesian</HI> Paces or <HI>Stadiums,</HI> by walking in a straight Line or Way
from North to South through the most large and populous Streets, in which
you shall find no place destitute either of Houses or People: you may per∣form
the like Iourney almost from the West to the North. Seeing therefore
that according unto the <HI>Chinesian</HI> History, the Name, the Description, the
Magnitude, and all other Passages, do demonstrate this to be the City <HI>Quin∣sai,</HI>
we ought no longer to question or doubt of the same.</Q> Thus Father

<P>I Shall therefore now briefly shew whence proceeded that so great confusion
of Opinions concerning the proper Situation of <HI>Cathay.</HI> Now it is known
both from the History of <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus, Haytho</HI> the <HI>Armenian,</HI> and
also from the Chronology of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> that the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> Emperor of the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> whom some call <HI>Cublai,</HI> others <HI>Ulcam,</HI> or <HI>Uncam, Anno 1256.</HI> making a
Breach or Irruption through the Walls, gain'd the whole Empire of the <HI>Chine∣ses</HI>
(which then was divided into two Empires, whereof the one towards the
North was call'd <HI>Cathay,</HI> the other towards the South <HI>Mangi;)</HI> whence as the
North part of <HI>China,</HI> with the other Regions without the Walls, was otherwise
vulgarly call'd <HI>Cathay,</HI> so also the whole Empire of the <HI>Chineses</HI> being now
possess'd, the whole was call'd by the Name of <HI>Cathay,</HI> by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and the
adjoining <HI>Saracens,</HI> the Name of the other circumjacent Regions without the
Walls being utterly extinguish'd; so that from that very time, that only
Empire of the <HI>Chineses</HI> that extended so far included within the Walls, was
call'd <HI>Cathay,</HI> by as many as Traffick'd or Merchandiz'd thither from <HI>Indostan,
Usbec, Camul,</HI> and other Mediterranean Regions, as it is manifest from the Voy∣age
of our Brother <HI>Benedict Goes.</HI> But because that was not only undertaken
and decreed by the Command and Advice of the Superiors of our Society,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Voyage of <HI>Benedict Goes,</HI> for the Discovery of <HI>Cathay.</HI></NOTE> but

certainly it was perform'd with all the diligence and care possible by <HI>Benedict
Goes,</HI> a Person of great Prudence and Understanding, and also skill'd in the
<HI>Persian</HI> Language, which he had excellently attain'd to by a long stay or conti∣nuance
<PB N="352" REF="192"/>
in the Court of the <HI>Mogor,</HI> and where he was very familiar with the
Emperor <HI>Acabar.</HI> Therefore he being sufficiently furnish'd with Supplies con∣venient
for so great a Voyage from the Vice-Roy of <HI>India,</HI> and having also the
<HI>Diploma,</HI> Patent, or Pass, taking the Habit of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and changing also
his Name <HI>Benedict</HI> into <HI>Abdulla,</HI> which signifieth <HI>The Servant of God;</HI> and joyn∣ing
with him an <HI>Armenian</HI> nam'd <HI>Isaac,</HI> as his inseparable Companion in his
Voyage, <HI>Anno 1603.</HI> in the solemn <HI>Lent</HI> Fast departing from <HI>Lahor</HI> the Regal
City of the <HI>Mogor,</HI> he travell'd towards the Kingdom of <HI>Cascar</HI> in the company
of five hundred Persons, which they call <HI>The Caravan,</HI> having with them a
great multitude of Beasts of Carriage, Camels, and Wagons: In a Month he
arriv'd at the City <HI>Athec</HI> under the Iurisdiction of the <HI>Mogor;</HI> and having pas∣sed
over the River <HI>Indus,</HI> at the end of two Months more he came unto <HI>Passaur,</HI>
where he was inform'd by an Hermit, that about two Months Iourney farther
towards the North, was the Region <HI>Caphurstan,</HI> that is, <HI>The Land of Infidels</HI> (of
which I shall treat anon) that had many <HI>Christians</HI> in it: unto which notwith∣standing,
being hindred by the <HI>Caravan,</HI> he could not travel. Hence in the
Course of twenty five Days he came unto a City nam'd <HI>Ghideli,</HI> where he was
in great danger of Thieves. Departing thence, in twenty Days he came to the
City <HI>Cabul,</HI> a City yet subject to the <HI>Mogor;</HI> from whence he went unto <HI>Chia∣nacar,</HI>
a City abounding with Iron; and from thence in ten Days he arriv'd
at a Place call'd <HI>Parvan,</HI> the last Town of the Kingdom of the <HI>Mogor.</HI> After
five Days respite, he came in the space of twenty Days to a Region nam'd <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cheran,</HI>
having pass'd over exceeding high Mountains; and in fifteen Days
more he arriv'd at the City <HI>Calcia,</HI> and there having spent ten Days, he came to
a certain Place call'd <HI>Gialalabeth,</HI> famous for the Portage or Customs of the
<HI>Brachmans:</HI> after fifteen Days more he came to <HI>Talhan;</HI> and hence proceeding
forward to <HI>Chaman,</HI> he incurr'd the great hazard of Robbers; whom having
shunn'd, at length he came to <HI>Ciarciunor;</HI> and after ten days, passing through
<HI>Sarpanil,</HI> a desart Place, he came to the Province <HI>Sarcil,</HI> over a very high Moun∣tain,
and that in twenty Days Travel: after two Days more he came to the
foot of the Mountain <HI>Cetialath,</HI> in which, by reason of the multitude of Snow,
many perish'd by the vehemency of the Cold. Having travell'd six Days
through the Snow, he came to <HI>Tamgheran</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Cascar,</HI> and after
fifteen Days to <HI>Iaconich,</HI> and after five to <HI>Hiarcham,</HI> the Metropolitan City of
<HI>Cascar,</HI> and the end of the Region of <HI>Cabul:</HI> The whole Region are Followers
of the Law of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and hence from <HI>Hiarcham</HI> is the beginning of the Ex∣pedition
by <HI>Caravan</HI> into <HI>Cathay;</HI> and the Negotiation of those that certainly
know they shall be admitted into the Kingdom, wholly consisteth as it were
in Fragments of precious Iaspar, which are found in great plenty in <HI>Cathay,</HI>
that is in <HI>China,</HI> and are of two kinds; the first sort is brought out of the River
<HI>Cotan,</HI> not far from the Regal City, by Fishermen, like unto thick Flints; the
other being digg'd out of the Mountains, is cleft into stony Plates, almost two
Ells long. This Mountain <HI>Cansangui</HI> is distant from the Imperial City twenty
Days Iourney, and it is call'd <HI>The Stony Mountain,</HI> noted vulgarly in Geogra∣phical
Maps: hence therefore <HI>Benedict,</HI> after long stay, again began his Voy∣age;
first he arriv'd at <HI>Iolci,</HI> the Place of Custom for the Kingdom, and from
hence in a Voyage of twenty five Days he pass'd over these following Places:
<HI>Hancialix, Alceghet, Hagabathet, Egriar, Mesetelec, Thalec, Horma, Thoantac, Mingie∣da,
Capetalcol, Zilan, Sarognebetal, Cambasco, Aconsersec, Ciacor, Acsu; Acsu</HI> is a Town
of the Kingdom of <HI>Cascar,</HI> from which he pass'd by a laborious Voyage, through
<PB N="353" REF="192"/>
the Desart <HI>Caracatai,</HI> that is, <HI>Black Cataia,</HI> unto <HI>Oitograch, Gazo, Casciani, Dellai,
Saregabadal, Ugan,</HI> and at last he arriv'd at <HI>Gruciam.</HI> Departing hence, in a
Voyage of twenty five Days he came unto the City of <HI>Cialis,</HI> which is subject
to the Dominion of the King of <HI>Cascar,</HI> where the <HI>Saracens</HI> returning in the
<HI>Caravan</HI> of the Year before from <HI>Cathay,</HI> that is, from <HI>Pekin,</HI> the Royal City of
<HI>China,</HI> declar'd wonderful things unto our <HI>Benedict,</HI> concerning <HI>Matthew Riccius</HI>
and his Companions; and here our Father wondred that he had found <HI>Cathay</HI>
in the chief Place of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> From hence in twenty Days he came unto
<HI>Pucia,</HI> a Town of the same Kingdom, and from hence to <HI>Turpham</HI> and <HI>Aramuth,</HI>
and at length arriv'd at <HI>Camul,</HI> a fortifi'd City: from <HI>Camul</HI> in nine Days he
came to the Walls of the North part of <HI>China,</HI> which he had so long desir'd,
unto a Place call'd <HI>Chaiaicum,</HI> where being admitted within the Walls by one
Days Iourney, he came to the first City of <HI>China</HI> call'd <HI>Socien,</HI> and found no
other <HI>Cathay</HI> but <HI>China;</HI> so that from thenceforward he laid aside all scruple of
the proper and true Situation of <HI>Cathay;</HI> which the <HI>Saracens</HI> often confoun∣ded
with <HI>China.</HI> Note, That this Voyage was taken or begun from <HI>Laor</HI>
towards the North, when he might have come to his Iourneys end from <HI>Laor</HI>
by a much nearer Way; but as this Voyage or Passage through the <HI>Thebetick</HI>
Mountains, was not yet discover'd, so that also on the other side by <HI>Usbeck</HI> and
<HI>Samarcande</HI> at that time was more us'd, although that to conform himself un∣to
the Custom of Merchants, he was forc'd to attempt to pass by this latter,
though it were very much out of the Way, by reason of its vast Windings and
and Turnings, and also on every hand subject to Robbers. The Territory of
<HI>Usbec</HI> is extended by a large Interval of Regions from the West to the North,
being made up of three very great Kingdoms, whereof the first is <HI>Samarcande,</HI>
famous for the Birth of <HI>Tamberlan;</HI> the second, <HI>Tarphan;</HI> and the third, <HI>Tur∣phan;</HI>
all of them infamous for the Religion of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The Inhabitants, as
Historians relate of the <HI>Scythians,</HI> are Cruel, Thieves, Bloudy, and implacable
Enemies of the <HI>Christians;</HI> so that this Kingdom is now altogether unpassable
for the <HI>Christians,</HI> except such as will become Deniers of <HI>Christ,</HI> and profess
themselves Followers of the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> And this is the Passage from
<HI>Usbec</HI> to <HI>Cathay.</HI></P>
<P>But the Voyage undertaken by Father <HI>Antonius Andradas,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> into
the Kingdom of <HI>Thebet,</HI> was after this manner: First passing over <HI>Ganges</HI> from
<HI>Laor,</HI> he entred into <HI>Scrinegar</HI> and <HI>Ciapharanga,</HI> most great and populous Cities;
and from these having pass'd over a most high Mountain, on the top of it he
discover'd a vast Lake, the common Receptacle of the Waters of the River
<HI>Indus, Ganges,</HI> and the other great Rivers of <HI>India;</HI> and hence by a Voyage of
many Days, and that also through high Mountains, he arriv'd in the cold
Northern Region <HI>Redor,</HI> and in a City of the same Name; from which, pas∣sing
through the Kingdom of <HI>Maranga</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Tanchut,</HI> which be∣longeth
unto the <HI>Tartars,</HI> in two Months space he easily arriv'd at <HI>Cathay,</HI> that
is, <HI>China.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Another Voyage from China to the Mogor, perform'd by the
Fathers of our Society, Father Albert Dorville, and
Father Iohn Gruberus.</HEAD>
<P>THese Fathers began their Voyage from <HI>Pequin, Anno 1661.</HI> in the
Month of <HI>Iune,</HI> from whence they arriv'd at <HI>Siganfu;</HI> and from hence,
after thirty Days stay, they departed to <HI>Sining</HI> or <HI>Siningfu,</HI> in almost
twice so many Days, having pass'd over the <HI>Saffron River.</HI> Now <HI>Sining</HI> or <HI>Si∣ningfu</HI>
is a great and populous City, built at the Walls of the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI>
by or through the Gate of which is the first entrance into <HI>Cathay</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> for
those that Trade thither from <HI>India,</HI> and where also they are forc'd to stay till
they have a farther admission granted them by the King. The City is plac'd
under the Elevation of the Pole 36 Degrees and 20 Minutes.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sining</HI> in three Months space, passing through the Desart of <HI>Kalmack</HI>
in <HI>Tartaria,</HI> they came unto the very entrance of the Kingdom of <HI>Lassa,</HI> which
the <HI>Tartars</HI> also call <HI>Barantola:</HI> The Desart is partly moutainous, partly level,
and overspread with Sand and Dust, altogether sterile and barren; unto which
notwithstanding Nature is here and there in some places propitious, by af∣fording
some small Rivulets, whose Banks yield a sufficient quantity of green
Herbs and Grass: But as this Desart deriveth its original from the innermost
Mediterranean Parts of <HI>India,</HI> so is it also extended in a straight Line from the
South to the North, and no Person hath yet unto this Day been found, who
hath discover'd its Bounds: Many suppose it to be extended even unto the
<HI>Frozen Sea,</HI> concerning which I have treated at large in my Book of the Subter∣ranean
World. Now it hath various Names; <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> calleth it
<HI>Lop,</HI> infamous for Diabolical Delusions, and a multitude of Spectres or evil
Spirits that usually appear in it, concerning which notwithstanding our Fa∣thers
relate nothing; for the once or twice appearing of these Spirits, doth
not prove the perpetual continuance of their appearance unto all: The <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
formerly call'd it <HI>The Desart Belgian,</HI> others sometime <HI>Samo,</HI> the <HI>Chineses
Kalmack,</HI> others <HI>Caracathay,</HI> that is, <HI>Black Cathay,</HI> where you shall find no other
Animals but wild Bulls of a mighty bigness: Yet the <HI>Tartars,</HI> accustom'd to
Desarts, wandring to and fro, pass over it at all times; and there also pitch or
fix their Hords, where they find a Place or River commodious for the Pastu∣rage
of their Cattel; their Hords are Pens or Tents, fit for the receiving both
of Men and Cattel.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lassa</HI> or <HI>Barantola,</HI> plac'd under the Elevation of the Pole 29 Degrees
and 6 Minutes, they came in four Days space to the foot of the Mountain
<HI>Langur;</HI> now this <HI>Langur</HI> is the highest of Mountains, so that on the top of it
Travellers can hardly breathe by reason of the subtilty and thinness of the Air;
neither can they pass over it in Summer, without manifest hazarding of their
Lives, by reason of the virulent and poisonous Exhalations of some Herbs.
No Wagon or Beast can pass over it, by reason of the horrible great steepnes∣ses
and rocky Paths, but you must travel all the Way on foot, almost for a
Months space, even unto the City <HI>Cuthi,</HI> which is the first, or Chief City of the
Kingdom of <HI>Necbal.</HI> Now although this mountainous Tract be difficult to
pass over, yet Nature hath plentifully furnish'd it with variety of Waters,
<PB N="355" REF="193"/>
which break forth of the hollow places of the Mountain in every part thereof.
These Waters are replenish'd with abundance of Fish for the Sustenance of
Man, and their Banks afford plenty of Pasturage for Beasts: I take this to be the
same Tract which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calleth <HI>Parapanisus,</HI> which being link'd in the series of
the <HI>Caucasian</HI> Mountains, is extended far and wide towards the East, and with
its Skirts toucheth the South and North. <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> calleth it <HI>Belor,</HI>
others give it other Names, according to the diversity of Nations through
which it passeth.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cuthi</HI> in five Days passage they came to the City <HI>Nesti</HI> in the Kingdom
of <HI>Necbal,</HI> in which all the Natives, being involv'd in the Shades of Idolatry,
live without any sign of the <HI>Christian Faith;</HI> yet it aboundeth with all things
necessary for the sustaining of Life, so that thirty or forty Hens are sold for
one <HI>Scutum.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Nesti</HI> they came in five days Iourney to the Metropolitan City of the
Kingdom of <HI>Necbal,</HI> which is call'd <HI>Cadmendu,</HI> and plac'd under the Elevation
of the Pole 27 Degrees and 5 Minutes, where there is a potent King that Ru∣leth,
and although an <HI>Heathen,</HI> yet not very much averse unto the <HI>Christian
Religion.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Cadmendu</HI> in half a Days time they came unto a City that the Natives
call <HI>Badda,</HI> the Regal City of the Kingdom of <HI>Necbal.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Necbal</HI> in a Iourney of five Days you meet with the City <HI>Hedonda,</HI> a
Colony of the Kingdom of <HI>Maranga,</HI> being plac'd under the Altitude of the
Pole 26 Degrees and 36 Minutes.</P>
<P>From <HI>Hedonda</HI> in eight Days space they came even to <HI>Mutgari,</HI> which is the
first City of the Kingdom of <HI>Mogor.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Mutgari</HI> is a Voyage of ten Days space even unto <HI>Battana,</HI> which is a
City of <HI>Bengala</HI> towards <HI>Ganges,</HI> plac'd under the Elevation of the Pole 25 De∣grees
and 44 Minutes.</P>
<P>From <HI>Battana</HI> in eight Days space they came to <HI>Benares,</HI> a populous City
on <HI>Ganges,</HI> and plac'd under the Elevation of the Pole 24 Degrees and 50 Mi∣nutes:
It is famous for an Academy of the <HI>Brachmans,</HI> which flourisheth there,
in which all the Sciences proper unto their Religion, or rather more truly,
unheard-of Superstitions are taught.</P>
<P>From <HI>Benares</HI> in eleven Days space they came to <HI>Catampor,</HI> and from thence
in seven Days to <HI>Agran.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore from <HI>Pekin</HI> even unto <HI>Agran</HI> was a continu'd Voyage of two
hundred and fourteen Days; but if you have respect to the stay of the <HI>Caravans,</HI>
it is a Voyage of one whole Year and about two Months. And these Relations
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> receiv'd by word of Mouth from the above-mention'd Fathers, who per∣form'd
the Voyage in the same manner as I have describ'd it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the various Habits, Manners, and Customs of the Men of those
Kingdoms, which were observ'd and drawn by the aforesaid Fathers,
Albert Dorville, and Gruberus, as they pass'd through them.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Kingdoms, which the afore-mention'd Fathers pass'd through by
a Voyage never hitherto attempted by any <HI>European,</HI> were unknown
to Geographers; so also did they observe many things, very worthy
of consideration, in reference to the Habits, Manners, and Customs of those
Nations, which on purpose being deliver'd to me, what by Pictures, and what
by Writing, they left to be inserted into their Voyage perform'd; which I
thought fit, having now an opportune and convenient time, to accomplish.</P>
<P>Therefore setting forwards from <HI>Pekin,</HI> the Metropolis and Imperial Seat
of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> they came in the space of two Months to those most famous
Walls, at which that vast City <HI>Siningfu</HI> is situate, as it were a certain and most
safe Bulwark unto the Walls against the Incursions of the <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Descripti∣on of the Walls of <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> where in
the end of our Book, we exhibit the Structure of as much of these Walls as
the convenience of the Place would admit of, as they were most diligently ob∣serv'd
and drawn by them; and they added, that the Walls were of so great
a breadth, that six Horse-men set orderly abreast, might conveniently run a
Race without being an hindrance to one another; whence they report, that
they are so frequently visited by the Citizens of <HI>Siningfu,</HI> both for the enjoying
of the Air, which is most wholsom and which breatheth from the adjacent
sandy Desarts, and also because they are very opportune for the performing of
many other Exercises for easing and recreating of the Mind; for they are of
that heighth, that they easily invite the Inhabitants unto them by their Pros∣pect,
which is on every side most clear and open, and withal exceeding plea∣sant,
and also by reason of the great conveniency of the Stairs, which give an
Ascent unto them: now the Longitude unto the broadest part of the Wall,
even unto the other Port or Gate, through which they pass from the Desart
unto the City <HI>Sucien,</HI> is so great, that it can hardly be pass'd in the space of
eighteen Days; which many do undertake, having first obtain'd leave of the
Governor of <HI>Siningfu,</HI> not so much out of any necessity of Trafficking or Mer∣chandise,
as led by a certain Curiosity, and withal being sufficiently furnish'd
with Provision; for they say, that the innumerable Habitations which are
within the Wall, appear from thence as from an high Mountain; but without
in the adjacent Desart, as the Inhabitants related unto them by word of
Mouth, they may recreate themselves with the wonderful and unwonted
sight (as it were from an high Tower) of all kinds of wild Beasts, such as are
Tygers, Lions, Elephants, Rhinoceroses, wild Bulls, Monoceroses, (that is, a
certain kind of Horn'd Asses) and all the while being free, and out of all dan∣ger,
more especially from that part of the Wall, which leading toward the
South, draweth near unto the more inhabited Regions, as <HI>Quansi, Iunnam,</HI> and
<HI>Tibet;</HI> for from hence unto the <HI>Saffron River,</HI> and the Places adjoyning, which
abound with Bushes and Thickets, they are wont to betake themselves in
Herds and Droves at certain times of the Year, both in respect of Pasturage,
and for Hunting of their Prey.</P>

the Walls, and immediately having entred that most vast and barren Desart
<HI>Kalmack,</HI> a Desart very dreadful and formidable, in two Months they came
to the Kingdom of <HI>Barantola.</HI> This Desart, although it be parch'd and rui∣nous,

<P>There is a most detestable and horrible Custom introduc'd into these King∣doms

They chuse a lusty Youth, unto whom they grant liberty on Set-days of the
Year, to kill with the Weapons wherewith he hath Arm'd himself, any Person
he meeteth, of what Age or Sex soever, without any difference or respect of
Persons, fondly supposing, that those who are thus slain, immediately, as if
they were Consecrated by <HI>Menipe,</HI> a devilish Spirit whom they worship, obtain
eternal Honors, and a most happy Estate. This Youth, in a very gay Habit,
furnish'd with a Sword, Quiver, and Arrows, and stuck or laden with the
Trophies of Banners and Ensigns, at a prefix'd time, being possess'd with the
Demon or Devil unto whom he is Consecrated, rushing with great fury out
of the House, wandreth through the Ways and Streets, and killeth at his plea∣sure
all that meet him, no resistance being made: This Youth they call in
their Language <HI>Phut,</HI> which signifieth <HI>The Slayer;</HI> whence our Fathers depicted
him altogether after the same manner that they had a sight of him, together
with the Habit of both Sexes in the Kingdom of <HI>Tanchut,</HI> as the eleventh,

<P>There is also exhibited in <HI>Barantola</HI> another Spectacle of a false Deity, which
as it almost seemeth to exceed humane belief, so it also doth require to be evi∣denc'd
with the more singular care. Our Fathers relate, that whilst they re∣main'd
in <HI>Barantola,</HI> which was about two Months, to wait for the convenience
of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> they observ'd many things in reference to the Manners and
Customs of the People, of which they noted some to be ridiculous, and others
to be cursed and detestable.</P>
<P>There are two Kings in this Kingdom, whereof one is truly concern'd and
employ'd in the management of the Affairs of the Kingdom, whom they call
<HI>Deva;</HI> the other being separated and taken off from the weight or incum∣brance
of all extraneous Concernments, living in quiet and repose within the
private Apartments or Withdrawings of his Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ridicu∣lous Worship of the <HI>Great Lama.</HI></NOTE> is ador'd like a Deity, and
that not only by the Natives, but of all the Kings that are subject unto the Em∣pire
of <HI>Tartary,</HI> who undertake voluntary Iourneys or Pilgrimages unto him:
They adore him as the True and Living God, and call him <HI>The Eternal and
Heavenly Father,</HI> offering a multitude of Presents and Oblations to him. He sit∣teth
in an obscure Chamber or Room of his Palace, adorn'd with Gold and
Silver, and rendred resplendent by the multiplicite lustre of flaming Lamps,
in a lofty place upon a Couch, which is cover'd with costly Tapestry; unto
whom Strangers at their approach fall prostrate with their Heads to the
Ground, and kiss him with incredible Veneration; which is no other than that
which is perform'd unto the Pope of <HI>Rome;</HI> so that hence the fraud and deceit
of the Devil may easily and plainly appear, who by his innate malignity and
hatred, in way of abuse hath transferr'd (as he hath done all the other Myste∣ries
of the <HI>Christian Religion)</HI> the Veneration which is due unto the Pope of
<HI>Rome,</HI> the only Vicar of <HI>Christ</HI> on Earth, unto the superstitious Worship of bar∣barous
People.</P>
<P>Whence as the <HI>Christians</HI> call the <HI>Roman</HI> High-Priest <HI>Father of Fathers,</HI> so these
Barbarians term their false Deity <HI>The Great Lama,</HI> that is, <HI>The Great High-Priest,</HI>
and <HI>The Lama of Lamas,</HI> that is, <HI>High-Priest of High-Priests,</HI> because from him,
as from a certain Fountain, floweth the whole Form and Mode of their Reli∣gion,

</FIGURE>
or rather mad and brain-sick Idolatry, whence also they call him <HI>The
Eternal Father.</HI> And lest that by dying he should seem to be devested, of the
duration of Eternity, the <HI>Lamae,</HI> or Priests, which are perpetually about him,
with great care and solicitude wait on his Necessities, expound the Oracles
that are taken from his Mouth unto simple Travellers, and such as will be∣lieve
them, with a wonderful counterfeiting of a feigned Divinity; these, I
say, after his Death, seek throughout the whole Kingdom for another Person
as like unto him in all respects as may be, whom, being found, they advance
into his Throne; and by this means they persuade and impose on the Belief
of those that are ignorant of the fraud and deceit, by divulging the perpetual
duration of the <HI>Eternal Father,</HI> seven times now in an hundred years rais'd from
the Dead; the Minds of those barbarous People being so firmly blinded by a
diabolical Delusion, that from hence they have no doubting or scruple of the
truth or belief of it. Thence it cometh to pass that he is worshipp'd with so
great signs of Veneration, that that Person esteemeth and reputeth himself
blessed, who can obtain by the Bounty or Courtesie of the <HI>Lamae</HI> or Priests
(whom therefore they are wont to corrupt or bribe for that purpose with large
and costly Presents, which redounds much to their advantage) any of the
Excrements or Urine of the Grand <HI>Lama:</HI> for from these worn about their
Necks, and the Urine mix'd with their Meats, <HI>(Oh abominable nastiness!)</HI> they
foolishly imagine themselves to be safe, and througly arm'd against the As∣saults
of all Bodily Infirmities. These things the Fathers learn'd from the Ci∣tizens
of <HI>Barantola,</HI> and were very much afflicted in Mind, in considering of
the great blindness of these Nations; and although they could not see the <HI>Great
Lama</HI> (by reason those that are of the <HI>Christian Profession</HI> are prohibited his sight,
as also any other may not be admitted, unless he have first perform'd the
aforesaid Idolatrous Ceremonies proper or peculiar to the <HI>Great Lama)</HI> yet not∣withstanding
they exactly drew his Effigies as it was expos'd to view in the
Entrance or Porch of the Emperor's Palace, to which they pay the same ac∣custom'd
Ceremonies, as unto his living Person.</P>
<P>The Castle wherein the <HI>Great Lama</HI> inhabiteth, is situate at the end of the
City <HI>Barantola,</HI> and is call'd by them <HI>Bietala,</HI> a Draught whereof is express'd in

<P>It is a Custom in this Country, that if you drink to a Woman, the other

Butter to the Brim of the Pot or Cup; those that pledge, or drink after them,
take them off again, and stick them upon their Foreheads.</P>
<P>There is also a most cruel Custom observ'd in these Kingdoms; for when
they despair of the recovery of their Sick, esteeming them near to Death, they
carry them forth, and cast them into deep Ditches in the Fields, which are full
of dead Bodies; and there being expos'd to the injury of Time, they suffer
them to perish without any pitty or commiseration; and after they are dead,

they leave them to be devour'd by ravenous Birds, Wolves, Dogs, and such
like Creatures; whilst in the mean time they persuade themselves, that 'tis no
mean Monument of a glorious Death, to have their Tomb in the Bellies of
living Animals. The Women of these Regions are so deform'd and ugly, that
they appear more fit for Devils than Men; for out of a Religious Conceit they
never wash themselves with Water, but with a stinking kind of Oyl, which
besides that it gives a most intolerable scent, it doth so bedaub and render
them filthy, that they seem not to be Women, but Hags and Witches.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Necbal</HI> shew'd himself extraordinary courteous to our Fathers,
by reason of a Present they bestow'd on him, which was a Perspective-Glass,
and other very curious Mathematical Instruments, with which he was so ta∣ken,
that he wholly determin'd with himself not to let them go, which he had
not done, but that they made him a faithful Promise to return thither again;
which if they perform'd, he promis'd to erect a House for their use and Exer∣cise,
endow'd with most ample Revenues, and also to grant them a plenary
Power to introduce the <HI>Christian Law</HI> into his Kingdom.</P>
<P>Departing from <HI>Necbal,</HI> they came to the Confines of the Kingdom of <HI>Ma∣ranga,</HI>
which is enclos'd in the Kingdom of <HI>Thebet;</HI> whose Metropolis is <HI>Ra∣doc,</HI>
the utmost Bound of the Voyage formerly undertaken by Father <HI>Andradas,</HI>
where they found many Marks of the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> in time past there Planted,
from the Names of <HI>Dominick, Francis,</HI> and <HI>Anthony,</HI> by which the Men are
call'd.</P>
<P>From hence they arriv'd at that first City of the Kingdom of the <HI>Mogor,</HI> so
well known unto the World by the Name of <HI>Hedonda;</HI> and thence they came
to <HI>Battana,</HI> a City of <HI>Bengala,</HI> situate on <HI>Ganges;</HI> thence to <HI>Benares,</HI> a City fa∣mous
for an Academy of the <HI>Brachmans;</HI> and at last to <HI>Agra,</HI> the Imperial City

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Voyage perform'd by Marcus Paulus Venetus, and Haython
the Armenian, into Cathay or China.</HEAD>
<P>SEeing none of the Ancients have describ'd the Kingdoms of the utmost
Confines of the East, more fully than <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</HI> therefore I
esteem'd it my Duty to say somewhat of his Voyage into <HI>Cathay</HI> at this
time, having so fit an opportunity; although there do many things occur,
which are neither apprehended nor understood at this very Day by any Geo∣grapher,
by reason of the variety of Names by which he calleth Kingdoms.
Provinces, Cities, Mountains, Rivers, and Lakes, and that differently from
all others; and also by reason of the Description of some Cities, which con∣sent
not with the modern Geography. Moreover, <HI>Marcus Paulus</HI> being igno∣rant
of the use of the Globe, hence it came to pass, that he setteth not down
the Longitude and Latitude of any City, from which knowledge alone the
true Situation of Places is found. But now let us come to relate his Voyage.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1269.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Voyage of <HI>M. Paulus Venetus.</HI></NOTE> being Emperor of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> two famous Persons of
the Illustrious Family of the <HI>Paulini, Nicolas</HI> and <HI>Matthew,</HI> Citizens of <HI>Venice,</HI> set
forwards unto <HI>Constantinople</HI> in a Ship fraighted with divers Commodities;
where having a little refresh'd themselves, and committing themselves to the
<HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> they arriv'd with prosperous Winds at a Port of <HI>Armenia,</HI> call'd <HI>Sol∣dadia;</HI>
(Now what this Port of <HI>Soldadia</HI> is, we have not hitherto found out:
<PB N="365" REF="200"/>
I interpret it to be <HI>Trapezonmet,</HI> seeing that there is no Port of the <HI>Armenians</HI>
nearer the <HI>Euxine Sea;</HI> neither can we discover what the Kingdom of <HI>Bartza</HI>
is.) From the Kingdom of <HI>Bartza</HI> they came by great windings and turnings
of the Land unto the City of <HI>Bochara,</HI> situate on the River <HI>Oxus</HI> in the King∣dom
of <HI>Usbeck;</HI> where great Wars arising between the King of <HI>Bartza</HI> and the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> they were much perplex'd, and ignorant which way to take to return
into their own Country; but at last, upon serious Consideration and Advice,
they remain'd there full three years: and that they might not spend their time
idly in that space, they apply'd themselves with all their endeavor to the at∣taining
of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Tongue. While Affairs were in this Condition, an
Ambassador came to <HI>Bochara,</HI> to Treat with the Great Emperor of <HI>Tartary,</HI>
where when he had found these fore-mention'd Persons, he us'd his utmost
Endeavors, (both in reference unto their great and noted Behaviour, and the
<HI>Tartarian</HI> Tongue, in which they were excellently accomplish'd,) to have them
with him in his Return to the Great <HI>Cham,</HI> to whom he knew they would be
very acceptable; therefore they relying on the Advice of the Ambassador, after
the Travel of several Months, made their appearance before the <HI>Great Cham.</HI>
He first of all admiring the Countenance and Behavior of these <HI>Europeans,</HI> and
also being led with a curiosity of understanding the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> was
wholly intent upon the discovery of the Mode and Form of the Government
of the Occidental Regions, enquiring of them concerning the Pope, the Em∣peror,
and the Rites of the whole Empire, as well those that are observ'd in
Peace as War: Unto which, when they had prudently reply'd, they so far
wrought upon the Emperor, that entring into Counsel with his Nobles, he
concluded upon sending an Ambassador to the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> which he thought
fit in his Name to impose on these <HI>Paulini,</HI> whose Faith and Sincerity he had
now sufficiently try'd; and together with them he sent a Golden Table and
Letters, in which he requested his Holiness would send him an hundred Per∣sons,
conspicuous both for Learning and Wisdom, to instruct his Subjects in
the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> which he said was the best and most pure of all others.
Wherefore these Persons having receiv'd their Embassy, immediately set for∣ward
on their Voyage, having this Golden Table, which was Seal'd with the
Seal of the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> and also having his Letters, in which he commanded
all his Subjects to receive them with all Honor and Affection, and discharge
them of all Customs and Tribute. Thus they follow'd on their Iourney by
the great assistance of the Golden Table, and after the space of some Months,
came at length to <HI>Balzra,</HI> a Port of the <HI>Armenians</HI> (now what this Port was,
whether on the <HI>Caspian</HI> or <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> I have not as yet found) it is most proba∣ble
to be the Port of <HI>Trapezonment,</HI> plac'd in a Corner of the <HI>Euxine Sea;</HI> for
from this Port, within a few Months, <HI>Anno 1272.</HI> they came to <HI>Ancona,</HI> which
could not be perform'd from the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> by reason of the great space of
Land and Regions interjoin'd.</P>
<P>Moreover, having return'd unto <HI>Ancona,</HI> whence they departed, the report
of the death of <HI>Clement</HI> the Fourth being nois'd abroad, and no other as yet
plac'd in the Apostolical Seat, being destitute of Advice, they were not a little
disturb'd: and setting forward unto <HI>Venice</HI> to visit their native Soil, they
heard of the Election of a new Pope. Here <HI>Nicolas</HI> found his Wife, whom he
had left great with Child at his departure, to be dead, having left behind her
<HI>Marcus,</HI> a Son of fifteen years of Age, who afterwards became the Companion
of his Father into those remote Regions of <HI>Asia,</HI> which his Father had before
<PB N="366" REF="201"/>
travell'd unto, and also was the Author and Writer of this Geographical Hi∣story.
Wherefore a new Pope being chosen, and nam'd <HI>Gregory the Tenth (Ru∣dulphus</HI>
being Emperor) by the unanimous Approbation of the Cardinals, they
return to <HI>Ancona,</HI> having deliver'd the Letters of the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> together with
the Presents, to the Pope; with which he being mov'd, and greatly rejoycing
that he had a fit opportunity offer'd him for the Propagation of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
return'd a Literal Missive unto the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> in which all things were con∣tain'd
that might seem necessary to instruct them better in the <HI>Christian Re∣ligion,</HI>
and render the mind of the <HI>Great Cham</HI> more flexible and yielding unto
the receiving of the <HI>Christian Law.</HI> Unto these he adjoin'd two excellent Per∣sons
for Learning, of the Society of St. <HI>Dominick, William</HI> of <HI>Tripoly,</HI> and <HI>Nicolas,</HI>
whose Sirname is not added. These therefore, provided with all Necessaries
for such an Expedition, began their Iourney to the East, and at length after a
long Voyage by Sea and Land, entred <HI>Armenia,</HI> where they found all things
in disorder, by reason of a War commenc'd between the <HI>Armenians</HI> and the
<HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Babylon:</HI> The Fathers being struck with fear, and laying aside all
prosecution of a farther Voyage, took up their Station, and continu'd in <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nia;</HI>
but <HI>Nicolas,</HI> with his Son <HI>Marcus Paulus,</HI> rejecting all fear of danger, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of a great desire which they had to give the <HI>Great Cham</HI> a plenary Satisfaction
concerning his Embassay, although they were expos'd to great hardship, and
the danger of unknown Paths, yet at last arriv'd at the City <HI>Clemenisu;</HI> of
whose approach when <HI>Cublai</HI> the <HI>Great Cham</HI> was acquainted, he commanded his
Messengers in forty Days space to set forwards to meet them, and to conduct
them to him, and withal to shew them all the respect that might be, and to let
them want for nothing that might be any way necessary for them. Therefore
being admitted into the Presence of the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> and having perform'd the
accustom'd signs or tokens of Veneration, they declar'd the Effects of their Em∣bassy,
and also Presented him with the Letters of the Pope, together with a
Viol of Oyl borrow'd from one of the Lamps our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Sepulchre: He ad∣miring
the Presence of <HI>Marcus</HI> the Son of <HI>Nicolas,</HI> gave such Respect unto both
of them, that he admitted them for his Domestick Attendants, which was a
token of great Honor, and made use of <HI>Nicolas</HI> as an Ambassador, whom by
reason of that singular Prudence that appear'd in him, his signal dexterity in
dispatching Business, and his great skill in four different Tongues, he sent
him on divers Employments, all which redounded unto his great advantage;
and when he discover'd the Emperor to be delighted with curious sights of
Nature, and strange Customs, whatsoever he observ'd rare, admirable, and
exotick, in the various Tracts of his Embassies and Voyages, those he collected
with great Industry, and Presented them to the <HI>Great Cham;</HI> by which you can
hardly imagine how much he ingratiated himself in his Favor; until at length,
oversway'd with a desire of returning to their native Country, after the dis∣charge
of many Embassies for the space of seventeen years, having obtain'd,
though with much reluctancy, a freedom to return, they came back well and
safe, through many unknown Paths of Sea and Land, having pass'd innume∣rable
Regions, unto <HI>Venice, Anno 1295.</HI> Now having related this by the way,
there remaineth nothing, but that I should describe somewhat more at large
his Voyage into <HI>Cathay,</HI> seeing many things, as I have said, do occur in it, that
do very much perplex Geographers.</P>
<P>Having Sail'd over the <HI>Mediterranean Sea,</HI> and Travell'd through <HI>Anatolia,
Armenia,</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> he came unto the Region of <HI>Balasia,</HI> which I suppose to be
<PB N="367" REF="201"/>
<HI>Corasina,</HI> a Country interposed between <HI>Persia</HI> and the Kingdom of the <HI>Great
Mogol:</HI> From this Place, avoiding the Passage towards the South, he took his
way between the North and East, which they call <HI>Nordost;</HI> thence he went
through the Desarts, and then over the most high Mountain <HI>Belor,</HI> which we
have describ'd before, into the Kingdom of <HI>Cassar,</HI> which now they call <HI>Cascar,</HI>
for a time Tributary to the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> partly Inhabited by <HI>Nestorian Christians,</HI>
and partly by <HI>Mahumetans:</HI> Thence wandring a little towards the North, he
entred into <HI>Samarcande,</HI> the Regal Seat of the Great <HI>Tamberlain,</HI> in the Kingdom
of <HI>Carcham,</HI> now call'd <HI>Tarcham;</HI> from whence he proceeded onwards, through
the Desart <HI>Lop,</HI> into the Cities <HI>Peim</HI> and <HI>Ciarcia,</HI> and at length into <HI>Camul</HI> and
<HI>Tarpham,</HI> at that time Provinces of the Empire of <HI>Tanchut,</HI> and now subject to
the Empire of <HI>Usbeck.</HI> All which agrees with what we have alledg'd before
concerning the Voyage of <HI>Benedict Goes.</HI> Yet from hence he went not the
shortest Way unto <HI>Cathay,</HI> but declining towards the North, he came unto the
City <HI>Campition,</HI> the Metropolis of the Kingdom of <HI>Tanchut,</HI> where having en∣tred
between the East and South, that is, South-East unto those that proceed
forwards, he came into <HI>Cathay</HI> through the Desart; yet laying aside this Pas∣sage,
he proceeded forwards again towards the North, and having pass'd
through many Provinces and Kingdoms of the <HI>Eastern Tartary,</HI> where he found
many <HI>Christians,</HI> at length he arriv'd at <HI>Cambalu,</HI> the Royal Court of the <HI>Great
Cham,</HI> of the largeness and Etymology of which City we have before treated at
large: Where I wonder very much that <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> maketh no mention of
the Walls of the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> through which of necessity he should have
pass'd; peradventure he stragling far and wide unto the <HI>Eastern Sea</HI> (unto which
he writeth that he came) through the Northern Kingdoms, pass'd through
<HI>Cireanum</HI> (belonging unto the <HI>Chineses)</HI> into <HI>Cathay,</HI> that is, <HI>China;</HI> for whatsoe∣ver
he afterwards relateth concerning <HI>Cathay,</HI> whatsoever he observeth con∣cerning
the vastness and magnificency of the Cities, concerning the frequency
and multitude of the People and Merchants, of the affluency of all things ne∣cessary
for Humane Life, of the abundance of great and small Rivers, of the ad∣mirable
Structures and Fabricks, of the Bridges; these, I say, can agree unto
no other Region, Kingdom, or Empire, but only unto that most vast Empire
of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> unto which the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Names of the Cities, with their Cu∣stoms
and Manners, are altogether consonant and agreeable, as I have shewn
at large in the preceding Discourse.</P>
<P><HI>Haython</HI> the <HI>Armenian,</HI> a Monk of the Order of the <HI>Praemonstratensis,</HI> and of the
Bloud-Royal, a Traveller throughout the whole East, he with the Fidelity of
a religious Person confirmeth whatsoever is more largely related by <HI>Paulus
Venetus</HI>
concerning the Kingdom of <HI>Cathay;</HI> for <HI>Anno 1307.</HI> he beheld all those
Kingdoms of the utmost Parts of the East with his own Eyes, the cause, man∣ner,
and occasion of which Voyages, we shall afterwards declare. Now he
thus speaketh concerning the Kingdom of <HI>Cathay,</HI> in the first Chapter of his
History: <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> Cathay <HI>is the greatest that is to be found in the World, and
is replenish'd with infinite People and Riches: It is situate on the Sea-Coast. The Men of
of those Parts are most subtle, and full of deceit: and therefore in all Knowledge make∣slight
of all other Nations; for they say that they are the only People that see with both Eyes,
and all others only with one: They have for the most part little Eyes, and are naturally
without Beards. And moreover it is reported concerning this Kingdom, that it is situate in
the chief part of the World, because it hath the East on one part, and on the other part there
doth no Nation inhabit, as they report; on the West it hath its Confines on the Kingdom
<PB N="368" REF="202"/>
of</HI> Tarsa, <HI>on the North it is bounded with the Desart of</HI> Belgian, <HI>and on the East and
South there are innumerable Islands of the Sea.</HI> In which words he so describeth
<HI>Cathay</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> that he differeth in nothing from the modern Situation, the
Customs of the Nations, and other things proper unto <HI>China.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Introduction of the Christian Faith into the foremention'd
Kingdoms of Tartary and Cathay, by the now alledg'd Voyages.</HEAD>
<P>SEeing that in all the foremention'd Voyages we at all times meet with
the mention of the <HI>Christians,</HI> the Reader ought not to doubt, but that the
Evangelical Doctrine of the <HI>Christian Law</HI> hath been introduc'd into the
utmost Kingdoms of the East, from the very first Times of the Primitive
Church, either by the Apostles themselves, or by their Disciples, or their
Successors in the Apostolical Function; which that it may appear more plainly,
I am resolv'd to treat of the Apostolical Expeditions of all Ages into these
Kingdoms; and although I have in the former Part of this Book treated of
the Expedition of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> into <HI>India,</HI> and the neighboring Kingdoms, yet I
shall here demonstrate how by the Assistance and Labors of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> as also
of St. <HI>Philip, Bartholomew, Thadeus,</HI> and other Apostles, the Holy <HI>Gospel</HI> was pro∣pagated
in the Kingdom of the <HI>Mediterranean India,</HI> to the utmost Bounds of <HI>Tar∣tary.</HI>
Which whilst I perform, I must acknowldge that I receiv'd no small
Light from the excellent Father <HI>Henry Rho,</HI> who hath travell'd almost through∣out
all <HI>India;</HI> for being sent from <HI>Goa</HI> into the Kingdom of the <HI>Mogu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> to <HI>Dal∣can,</HI>
which is now call'd <HI>The Kingdom of Visiapour,</HI> having pass'd over the Moun∣tain
<HI>Gati,</HI> he came to <HI>Golconda,</HI> and thence into <HI>Montipur,</HI> and thence by a direct
Voyage to <HI>Bengala</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Decanum;</HI> and from hence, in a straight
Path, to the Court of the <HI>Mogor</HI> in the City of <HI>Agra.</HI> What Rarities and Curi∣osities
he observ'd in so great a Voyage, he will publish to the World in due
time in his itinerary Discoursing concerning the Kingdom of <HI>Narsinga,</HI> and
those so celebrated Relicks of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> at <HI>Meliapor,</HI> he saith, <HI>That amongst other
things which the</HI> Christians <HI>reserve in their Library unto this Day, there is the Voyage of
St.</HI> Thomas <HI>(which that holy Apostle undertook from</HI> Iudea <HI>into</HI> India) <HI>preserv'd, and
that he hath it Translated out of the</HI> Syriack <HI>into the</HI> Latin <HI>Tongue;</HI> which when I
earnestly requested, he freely assented to my Desire, and it is as followeth:
<HI>In the general distribution of the Globe of the Earth, made by the Apostles at</HI> Hierusalem,
<HI>for the propagation of the Divine</HI> Gospel, <HI>it is manifest from Ecclesiastical History, that</HI>
India <HI>fell unto the lot of St.</HI> Thomas, <HI>unto which that he might arrive, he thus began
his Voyage: From</HI> Iudea, <HI>having pass'd through</HI> Syria, Armenia, <HI>and</HI> Mesopotamia,
<HI>he came unto a certain City of</HI> Persia, <HI>which is call'd</HI> Soldania, <HI>where having sow'd the
Seed of the</HI> Gospel, <HI>he reap'd a large Harvest of</HI> Christian <HI>Converts. Hence he pass'd
through the Kingdom of</HI> Candahar <HI>and</HI> Cabul, <HI>which is 40</HI> Lucae <HI>distant from</HI> Canda∣har;
<HI>now</HI> Cabul <HI>is also call'd</HI> Galabor, <HI>by which the Holy Apostle pass'd over high
Mountains unto the Region call'd at this Day by the Moors</HI> Gavorstan, <HI>that is,</HI> The Re∣gion
of Infidels, <HI>for so they term the</HI> Christians <HI>which continue there unto this very
Day. The</HI> Christians <HI>are call'd</HI> The Christians of St. Thomas; <HI>they are naturally
defended or fortifi'd by most high Mountains, so that there is no easie Passage to them, al∣though
sometimes some</HI> Saracens <HI>pass unto them, who are presently stain, out of an hatred
<PB N="369" REF="202"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their perfidious Sect; but the</HI> Gentiles <HI>or</HI> Heathens <HI>are receiv'd: And although these</HI>
Christians <HI>observe various Rites of the</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>as that they imprint a
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hree-fold Cross on their Foreheads and Temples, which is done or depicted by an</HI> Indian <HI>herb
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Weed call'd</HI> Santalis, <HI>of a red Colour, and that in Baptism they dip their Children in
Water; yet notwithstanding it hath so hapned in process of time, that the Church growing
full of Brambles for want of Apostolical Men,</HI> Christianity <HI>is much wasted and decay'd,
some small sparks of the</HI> Christian Faith <HI>only remaining; for the whole Nation is defil'd
with the various Superstitions and Blemishes of Error.</HI> Father <HI>Nicholas Trigautius,</HI> in
the Voyage undertaken by <HI>Benedict Goes</HI> into <HI>Cathay,</HI> farther confirmeth it in
these words: <HI>Afterwards they came into another Town nam'd</HI> Passaur, <HI>where they met
a certain</HI> Anchorite, <HI>by whom they understood, that thirty Days Iourney thence was a City
of the</HI> Christians <HI>nam'd</HI> Caphurstan, <HI>into which there was no Passage admitted unto the</HI>
Saracens, <HI>and those that approach thereunto, suffer Death: yet the</HI> Heathen <HI>Merchants
are not prohibited the entrance of their Cities, but are only excluded or debarr'd admission to
their Temples. He farther related, That all the Inhabitants of that Region go to Church
Apparell'd in Black; that the Land is fruitful; and that there are plenty of Vines found
there.</HI> Which Narration caus'd a suspicion in him, that without question there
was yet the Habitation of <HI>Christians,</HI> although much degenerated, which he
had also confirm'd by report elsewhere. This was also so manifest unto others
of our Fathers, the Propagators of the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> in the Kingdom of the
<HI>Mogul,</HI> that no Person from henceforwards ought to doubt of the same; whence
unto this very Day they are call'd <HI>The Christians of St. Thomas:</HI> and questionless
they had long since been gather'd into the Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> if there had not
wanted Laborers. Moreover, St. <HI>Thomas</HI> is said to have departed from <HI>Caphur∣stan</HI>
unto to the lesser <HI>Guzarata,</HI> not far from the Kingdom of <HI>Casmir,</HI> of which
we have treated above, which is situate distant from <HI>Labor</HI> three Days Voyage
towards the North; and thence he is said to have the Mountains of <HI>Thebet</HI> in a
long compass of the Land towards <HI>Bengala</HI> through the Kingdom of <HI>Decan,</HI> to
have arriv'd at <HI>Meliapor.</HI> It is certainly related, that Letters written in the <HI>Sy∣riack</HI>
Tongue, on a most ancient Parchment, are yet preserv'd in the Library
or Repository of the Church of <HI>Meliapor,</HI> in which St. <HI>Thomas</HI> is said to have
convocated the Bishops Consecrated by him in the aforesaid Kingdom, that is,
from <HI>Candahar, Cabul, Caphurstan,</HI> the lesser <HI>Guzarata,</HI> and the other adjoining
Provinces, unto the Council of <HI>Meliapor;</HI> which if it be so, it is very much to
be lamented, that there have no Persons been found, who might have transla∣ted
a Treasury of so great Ecclesiastical Antiquity into <HI>Latin.</HI> But however
this be, <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> write, That St. <HI>Thomas</HI> first went and Preach'd to
the <HI>Parthians:</HI> and <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI> delivereth, in his Homily against the <HI>Ar∣rians,</HI>
that he Preach'd to the <HI>Indians: Theodoret</HI> consenteth unto these, that the
Preaching and receiving of the <HI>Gospel</HI> amongst the <HI>Parthians, Persians, Medes,
Brachmans, Indians,</HI> and the bordering Nations, ought to be ascrib'd unto
St. <HI>Thomas:</HI> And <HI>Nicephorus</HI> also relateth, that he came unto <HI>Tapraban,</HI> now
call'd <HI>Sumatra,</HI> which seeing it is not remote from the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> it can∣not
but appear very probable to any one that he visited <HI>China</HI> also in his own
Person; any one, I say, who rightly understandeth what I have above re∣lated
concerning the Voyages of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle, which is at large
handled by <HI>Osorius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Sylva,</HI> who hath elegantly compil'd the <HI>Indian</HI>
History: Whence from these Regions even now declar'd, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>Cabul,
Caphurstan, Tibet,</HI> and <HI>Mogul,</HI> he might easily by the Bishops his Successors, pro∣pagate
the Sacred <HI>Gospel</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> into the remotest Provinces and Kingdoms,
<PB N="370" REF="203"/>
to the utmost Bounds of <HI>Tartary.</HI> This <HI>Ortelius</HI> openly confirmeth, who saith,
That the Kingdom of <HI>Archon,</HI> situate in the utmost Angle or Corner of the
North, was Converted unto the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> by St. <HI>Thomas;</HI> you must under∣stand
it of of his Successors; so that by this Account there is no Part or Cor∣ner
of the World which hath not been fill'd with the Light of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> by
his Care and Diligence.</P>
<P><HI>Nicephorus</HI> also relateth in his second Book, Chap. 39. That St. <HI>Philip</HI> Preach'd
the <HI>Gospel</HI> in the upper <HI>Asia;</HI> now the upper <HI>Asia</HI> is nothing else but that vast
Space of <HI>Asia Minor</HI> which the Ancients call'd by the Name of <HI>Scythia</HI> on this
side, and beyond <HI>Imaus;</HI> and they are all those Regions which are compre∣hended
in the extreme Limits of the <HI>Eastern Sea,</HI> and about the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> as
<HI>Georgia, Iberia, Albanior, Micrelia, Armenia,</HI> and part of the Transmarine <HI>Asiatick
Tartary;</HI> from whence in course of Time the <HI>Gospel</HI> of our <HI>Saviour</HI> by a farther
sprouting, was transplanted into all the circumjacent Kingdoms, as <HI>Thebet, In∣dostan,
Tanchut,</HI> and the like. <HI>Chrysostome</HI> saith, That St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> instructed
the People of the greater <HI>Armenia</HI> in the <HI>Christian Faith: Sophrinus</HI> saith, that
he taught the <HI>Albanians;</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI> that he Preach'd to the hithermost <HI>Indians,
Panthenus,</HI> a <HI>Christian</HI> Philosopher, saith, That when he travell'd to the <HI>Indians,</HI>
he found <HI>Christianity</HI> yet flourishing by the Preaching of St. <HI>Bartholomew.</HI> He
that is curious to know more concerning this, let him have recourse unto the
History of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> which they call <HI>Giarrentir,</HI> that is, <HI>A Book of Relations,</HI>
which <HI>Clemens Galanus,</HI> a Canon Regular, who spent many years in <HI>Armenia,
Georgia,</HI> and the other Regions of <HI>Colchis,</HI> to propagate the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> here
publish'd at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>First of all therefore, the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> was introduc'd into the forementi∣on'd
Kingdoms by the Apostles, <HI>Thomas, Philip,</HI> and <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> which after∣wards
in course of Time being Propagated and Cultivated by their Succes∣sors,
very Holy Men, and illuminated with the Holy Spirit, diffus'd and spread
the Light of the <HI>Divine Law</HI> throughout the whole East, unto the great advan∣tage
of Souls, until by the want of Laborers, the People following a more dis∣solute
and ill mode of Life, degenerated from the Rectitude of <HI>Faith</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
and also blemish'd and bespotted with the Rites of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> altogether fell
off from the True Way: for <HI>Anno</HI> 400. when by the instigation of Satan the
cursed <HI>Arrius, Nestorius, Dioscurus,</HI> and other Hereticks, but especially the <HI>Ne∣storians,</HI>
had every where spread their damnable Opinions, and in an horrid
manner weakned the Orthodox <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI> above all other Parts it infected
with the Venom of its pestiferous Doctrine <HI>Colchis, Armenia, Persia, Turchestan,</HI>
and the utmost Bounds of the <HI>Asiatick Tartary;</HI> so that (as <HI>Marcus Paulus</HI> and
<HI>Haython</HI> relate) there is no Place of the aforesaid Regions which it hath not de∣fil'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s coming into the World.</NOTE>
Add unto this, that in the Year 632. or thereabouts, was the cursed rise
of the Incendiary of the World, <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who swelling and breaking in
like an Inundation over a great portion of the Earth, subjected the same to
his most unjust Laws; whence it came to pass, that the faithful <HI>Christians,</HI> and
more especially Persons of the Priestly Order, being exil'd their Native Coun∣try,
by degrees forsook the Provinces of the more inward Part of of <HI>Asia,</HI> either
for fear of Persecution, or by a voluntary Exile; those that were arm'd with a
zeal and desire to the House of God, being inflam'd with a fervour to propa∣gate
the ancient Religion of the Orthodox <HI>Faith,</HI> fled, or retir'd into <HI>China</HI> it
self, where how much they labor'd to the advantage of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> is
plainly shew'd by the <HI>Syro-Chenesian</HI> Monument I have expounded above.
<PB N="371" REF="203"/>
Now as nothing is firm and solid in Humane Affairs, so also the <HI>Faith</HI> intro∣duc'd
into the foremention'd Regions, now fading, either through the want
of Apostolical Men, or the extreme degeneration of <HI>Christians,</HI> tended or de∣flected
first to Idolatry, then to <HI>Mahumetanism,</HI> anon to the Religion of the <HI>Ne∣storian</HI>
Hereticks, according as the lust of each Persons <HI>Genius</HI> led or drew them;
and this Vicissitude or Alteration of the Orthodox <HI>Faith,</HI> sometimes receiv'd,
and sometimes being rejected, continu'd more especially in the <HI>Eastern Tartary,</HI>
unto the Year 1252. in which (as <HI>Haython</HI> the <HI>Armenian</HI> relateth, who was of the
Blood-Royal) <HI>Haython</HI> King of <HI>Armenia</HI> his Brother Reigned, until he could no
longer endure the <HI>Turkish</HI> Spoilers of his Kingdom; wherefore by a Divine
Instinct taking a new Counsel, and going in his own Person unto the <HI>Great
Cham</HI> Emperor of <HI>Tartary,</HI> whom <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> calleth <HI>Cublai Cingischan,</HI> who
Rul'd in <HI>Tartaria</HI> and <HI>Cathay,</HI> both to make a League against the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and
to gain the Favor of that most Potent Prince for the confirming of the
<HI>Christian</HI> Commonwealth in a peaceable Estate and Condition, after a tedious
Voyage he arriv'd at <HI>Almalech,</HI> that is, <HI>Cambalu,</HI> the Court of the <HI>Great Cham.</HI>
The <HI>Great Cham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Great Cham</HI> conver∣ted to <HI>Christi∣anity</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Cublai,</HI> being much joy'd at his coming, receiv'd him with
great Honor and Respect, as he deserv'd, bestow'd on him great Presents, and
advis'd his Nobles to follow his Example, and do the same. Therefore when
King <HI>Haython</HI> had rested himself some Weeks after the toil of his continual
Travels, he address'd himself to the Emperor, and with much strength and
weight of Rational Arguments open'd the Cause of his so far undertaken
Voyage. The Emperor having duly ponder'd the just Reasons of his Petiti∣on,
and greatly admiring both the Condescension of the King's Person, in ex∣posing
himself to so great Labors and Danger, and also considering that the
Quiet of his Kingdom, and the Advantage or Interest of the <HI>Christian</HI> Common-wealth
was very much concern'd, out of his Clemency promis'd to grant him
whatsoever he should demand. <HI>Haython</HI> accepting of the obsequiousness of so
free an Offer, Presented him in Writing several Points of his Petition, which
were as followeth:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the <HI>Great Cham</HI> would vouchsafe to embrace the <HI>Christian Faith.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That a perpetual League of Friendship might be confirm'd between the <HI>Christians</HI>
and the <HI>Tartars.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That all the <HI>Christians,</HI> both Ecclesiasticks and Laicks, with their Churches, might
be free from all Persecution, and enjoy the Immunities and Priviledges in all the King∣doms
which the <HI>Tartars</HI> had subjected to the Empire.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That he should raise an Army to free the Holy Sepulchre of <HI>Christ</HI> from the
<HI>Turkish</HI> Tyranny, and also restore the Holy Land possess'd by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> into the
Hands of the <HI>Christians.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That he should joyn his Forces with his, to root out the most potent <HI>Caliph</HI> of <HI>Bal∣dach.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That he should grant him the Priviledge, to implore the Assistance of the <HI>Tartars</HI>
wheresoever they inhabit, more especially those that border nearer <HI>Armenia,</HI> and that with∣out
any delay they should be oblig'd to aid him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That the Priviledges and Iurisdictions of his Kingdom of <HI>Armenia,</HI> which first
was possess'd by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and they being thence expuls'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> the Tribu∣tary
Kings of the <HI>Great Cham</HI> possess'd, should be restor'd to him the King of <HI>Armenia.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Great Cham</HI> having heard these Demands, presently call'd a Council of
his Nobility, in whose Presence he return'd this Answer:</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="204"/>
<Q>Because the King of <HI>Armenia</HI> hath address'd himself to Our Empire, not
by any Compulsion, but mov'd of his own free Will, in truth, it very much
becometh Our Imperial Majesty to assent unto his lawful Requests, and by
all ways possible to further his Desires: Therefore We accept of your
Prayers, and shall be careful to accomplish all by God's Assistance. First of
all, I the Emperor and Lord of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> will cause my self to be Bap∣tiz'd,
and will hold that <HI>Faith</HI> which the <HI>Christians</HI> hold, advising all the
Subjects of my Empire to do the same, but not with that intention, that I
desire violence should be offer'd to any Person. Unto the second We An∣swer,
and effectually Intend, and strictly Command, That there be a perpe∣tual
League between the <HI>Christians</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> inviolably confirm'd. Al∣so
We Will, and it is Our Pleasure, That all the Churches of the <HI>Christians,</HI>
and the Clergy of what Condition soever, whether Secular or Religious,
have and enjoy their Priviledges and Liberties in all the Kingdoms or Pro∣vinces
subject unto my Dominion, and that none molest them. As for what
concerneth the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> We say, That if We could with Our Convenience,
We would, out of Reverence unto Our Lord and Saviour <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> go in
Person; but because We have much Business in these Our Kingdoms, We
Will and Enjoyn Our Brother <HI>Haolon</HI> to bring all this Business to effect, as it
requireth and becometh the same: for he shall free the City of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and
all the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> out of the Hands of the <HI>Pagans,</HI> and shall restore the same
unto the <HI>Christians.</HI> And now for what concerns the <HI>Caliph</HI> of <HI>Baldach,</HI> We
shall issue out Our Commands unto Our Captain <HI>Baydod,</HI> who is General of
the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and those that are in the Kingdoms of <HI>Turcia,</HI> and all others that
inhabit about those Regions, That they reduce them all under their Yoke,
and utterly destroy the <HI>Caliph,</HI> Our Capital Enemy. And as for the Privi∣ledge
that the King of <HI>Armenia</HI> requireth by the Aid of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> it is Our
Pleasure, that he may have Satisfaction according to his Desire, which We are
resolv'd also freely to confirm. And lastly, as concerning the King of <HI>Arme∣nia</HI>'s
Demand, That we should restore the Lands of his Kingdoms taken
from him by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and afterwards possess'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> this We
willingly and freely grant unto him; and it is Our Pleasure that our Bro∣ther
<HI>Haolon</HI> restore all those Lands without delay; and also Our Will and
Pleasure is, that many Tents may be granted unto the aforesaid King, and
and that by a special Grace, for the Augmentation and Defence of his King∣dom.</Q>
Thus <HI>Haython</HI> the <HI>Armenian,</HI> who was Brother of this King of <HI>Armenia,</HI>
and also his inseparable Companion in his Voyage unto the <HI>Great Cham</HI> into
the remotest Parts of <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>
<P>The Points which King <HI>Haython</HI> requested of the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> were obtain'd
with wonderful constancy of Faith and Sincerity; for as the <HI>Armenian</HI> Writer
of this History testifieth in his 24<SUP>th</SUP> Chapter, he accomplish'd the first Point,
in reference unto Baptism, without delay; for after he had been instructed in
the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> he with his whole Court, and all his Nobility, were Baptiz'd
by a Bishop that was Chancellor of <HI>Armenia,</HI> and by his Brother <HI>Haython,</HI> the
King of <HI>Armenia;</HI> and having now haply discharg'd his Embassy, and accom∣plish'd
his Desires, accompanied with <HI>Haolon,</HI> after he was restor'd unto his
Kingdom, he gain'd the Possession of all <HI>Persia,</HI> being then without a King,
meeting with very little resistance: He despoil'd also the <HI>Caliph</HI> in <HI>Baldach,</HI>
and plunder'd the City, which abounded with great Riches, and block'd up
the <HI>Caliph,</HI> the Head of the perfidious <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, a Person extremely
<PB N="373" REF="204"/>
covetous, who reserv'd his Money to raise an Army, in a Castle or Tower,
and thence cast out his Gold, Silver, and Iewels, to maintain and preserve his
Life, if possible; but he famish'd him, by depriving him of all Provision, and
thus spake unto him: <HI>If thou hadst not so covetously and penuriously reserv'd this Trea∣sure,
thou hadst freed thy self and thy City; but now enjoy thy Wealth, and eat and drink
that which thou hast so dearly delighted in.</HI> And thus he reposing confidence in his
Riches, perish'd with Hunger. Thence wheeling about his Army, he wan all
<HI>Turcia,</HI> and reduc'd into his Possession <HI>Alepo,</HI> a most strong and populous City,
and abounding in Wealth; after nine Days Siege; which being gain'd, and
<HI>Damascus</HI> being also Assaulted and taken by his Valour, he then subdu'd with
the like success the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> even to the Desart of <HI>Egypt:</HI> and in all the King∣doms
now subjected under his Dominion, this was his only Care, that what∣soever
<HI>Christians</HI> he found either Exil'd or debarr'd of their Liberty, were re∣stor'd
unto the same again, and also had the Priviledge of their Churches
grant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them, and those that were demolish'd, were re-edifi'd at their Cost;
being induc'd unto this more especially by his Wife, who was nam'd <HI>Dioucos∣caron,</HI>
and reported to be one of the Linage of the three Kings that were led by
the Star, and offer'd their Presents unto our <HI>Saviour</HI> at his Birth: for she, as ha∣ving
been long before instructed in the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> so also being inflam'd
with a zeal and desire of promoting the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> made it her whole endea∣vor,
by the extirpation of the wicked Sect of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> to restore the <HI>Holy
Land</HI> and the Sepulchre of <HI>Christ</HI> unto the <HI>Christians.</HI> Therefore it so hapned by
the zeal of <HI>Haython</HI> to the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> that besides the hithermost <HI>Tartary,</HI>
both the Kingdoms of <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Colchis,</HI> and also <HI>Turcia, Babylon, Syria,</HI> and
<HI>Palestine,</HI> freely, and with great liberty, enjoy'd the <HI>Christian Profession,</HI> with
a great accession of the <HI>Infidels</HI> unto the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI> And in the greater <HI>Tar∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ria,</HI>
all every where following the Example of the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> embrac'd the
<HI>Christian Profession</HI> even unto the utmost Bounds of <HI>Cathay.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Antonius</HI> confirmeth all this in his 3. <HI>Tom. Tit. 19. Chap. 8. Sect. 21.</HI> and he
whom we before call'd <HI>Haolon,</HI> he calleth <HI>Ercaltay,</HI> a Prince, and Brother of
<HI>Cublai</HI> the <HI>Great Cham;</HI> for he a long time after his Baptism, being sent in the
name of the Emperor to destroy the perfidious Sect of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> out of a great
and incredible zeal he had to the Orthodox Religion, and also to recover the
<HI>Holy Land,</HI> as we have before related, atchiev'd many Exploits worthy eternal
Memory. There is an Epistle of his extant, in the same quoted place of <HI>Anto∣nius,</HI>
unto St. <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who was also at the same time intent on the
War undertaken against the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> in the Island of <HI>Cyprus;</HI> in which Epi∣stle
he ardently exhorteth him to accomplish the same Enterprize together
with him; and because it is worthy of consideration, I thought it requisite
here to insert it. This is the Exemplar or Transcript of the Letter which <HI>Er∣caltay</HI>
Prince of the <HI>Tartars</HI> sent unto King <HI>Lewis,</HI> and by his Command Trans∣lated
into <HI>Latin</HI> word for word.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Words of <HI>Ercaltay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Letter of <HI>Haolon</HI> to the K. of <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> sent by the Power of the High God from the King of the
Land of <HI>Cham,</HI> unto the Great King, the Strenuous or Victorious Conqueror of
many Provinces, the Sword of the World, the Victory of <HI>Christianity,</HI> the Defender of
the Apostolical Religion, Son of the Evangelical Law, King of <HI>France,</HI> let God increase his
Dominion, and preserve it for many years, and fulfill his Desires in the Law, and in the
World now, and in the World to come, by the Verity of his Divine Power, that leadeth all
Men, and all the Prophets and Apostles, <HI>Amen.</HI> A hundred thousand Salutes and Bene∣dictions;
<PB N="374" REF="205"/>
and this I request, That he will accept these Benedictions, and that they may ap∣pear
great in his sight: God grant that I may behold this magnificent King, who hath ap∣proached
so near unto us. Now the most High Creator grant this our Meeting may be in
Charity, and cause us to assemble together in Unity. After this our Salutation, That in this
our Epistle we intend nothing but the advantage of <HI>Christianity,</HI> and to strengthen the
Hands of the <HI>Christians;</HI> and I beseech God to render the <HI>Christian</HI> Armies success∣ful,
and that they may become triumphant over their Adversaries that contemn the Cross.
Now on the part or behalf of the Great King, let God advance him, let God increase his
Magnificence in the Presence of <HI>Cyochaym:</HI> We come with Power and Command, that
all <HI>Christians</HI> be free from Servitude and Tribute, from Force, Compulsion, and the like,
that they be Honor'd and had in Reverence, and that none take away, or deprive them of
their Possessions; and that their demolish'd Churches be re-edifi'd, their Tables founded, and
that no Person may restrain them to Pray with a quiet Conscience and free Mind for our
King. We have sent hither by our faithful Servant the venerable Person <HI>Sabaldi,
David</HI> and <HI>Mark,</HI> and they declare those good Reports, and relate by word of Mouth how
Matters are carried with us; now the Son may receive their words, and may concredit them,
and in our Letters the King of the Earth may be exalted: His Magnificence commandeth,
that in the Law of God there be no difference between the <HI>Grecian</HI> and the <HI>Roman,</HI> the
<HI>Armenian, Nestorian,</HI> and <HI>Iacobite,</HI> and all those that adore the Cross; for they are
all one with us, and so we desire that the Magnificent King would not be divided, or be con∣trary
amongst us, but that his Piety may be shewn upon all the <HI>Christians,</HI> and that his
Goodness and Clemency may continue.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus far the Example of the Epistle, which was sent to the King of <HI>France</HI>
in <HI>Cyprus</HI> from <HI>Ercaltay</HI> Prince of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> unto which other Letters are suffi∣ciently
consonant, which a little before were Presented unto the same King
from the King of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Ioppa;</HI> a Transcript of which also,
together with the Transcript of the aforesaid Letter of <HI>Ercaltay,</HI> were sent by
the venerable Legate unto Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the Fourth. This I have transcrib'd
our of <HI>Antonius.</HI></P>
<P>Also St. <HI>Lewis</HI> sent unto the foremention'd <HI>Ercaltay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presents of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> to the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at Cham.</HI></NOTE> and to the <HI>Great Cham,</HI>
Ambassadors of the Order of St. <HI>Dominick</HI> with rich Gifts or Presents, one
whereof was that which they call <HI>A Baldachin,</HI> a most magnificent Present, in
which the whole Life of <HI>Christ</HI> was beheld interwoven in Tapestry-work by
a wonderful Art, together with a piece of the Cross: But concerning this see
more at large St. <HI>Antonius</HI> in the fore-cited place; as also <HI>Vincentius</HI> Bishop
of <HI>Bellay,</HI> in his <HI>Speculum Historicum,</HI> or <HI>Historical Looking-Glass;</HI> all which hap∣ned
about the Year 1256. and are consonant to what we a little before alledg'd
out of <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> and <HI>Haython.</HI> St. <HI>Antonius</HI> asserteth in the place quoted,
That some <HI>Tartars</HI> came unto the Council held under <HI>Innocent</HI> the Fourth. At
length, <HI>Anno 1300.</HI> (as <HI>Vadingus</HI> relateth in the Life of <HI>Odiricus)</HI> many Religious
Persons of the Order of St. <HI>Francis</HI> were sent unto the <HI>Great Cham,</HI> into the
greater <HI>Cathay</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> and remain'd in the Cities of <HI>Cambalu</HI> and <HI>Nanchin,</HI>
which they call <HI>The City of Heaven,</HI> as also the Kingdom of <HI>Tebeth,</HI> Converting
many of the <HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> unto the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI> This St. <HI>Odiricus</HI> above-mention'd,
was a Person of the same Order, who being inflam'd with a zeal of
gaining all the People of those Kingdoms unto <HI>Christ,</HI> is reported to have tra∣vell'd
thither, as is shewn at large by the Reverend Fathers <HI>Bollandus</HI> and <HI>Ho∣enschenius,</HI>
in the splendid Work of <HI>The Lives of the Saints,</HI> unto which I refer the
Reader; where in the first Tome, on the fifteenth day of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> they at large
<PB N="375" REF="205"/>
demonstrate the same in their Learned Commentaries. And therefore by this
occasion the <HI>Gospel</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> being spread throughout all <HI>Tartary</HI> and the King∣dom
of <HI>Cathay,</HI> which is <HI>China,</HI> was in every Place much augmented. But as
we have often said before, what through the defect of the Cultivators of the
Vineyard of <HI>Christ,</HI> or by the various Successors of the Empire, very little ad∣dicted
unto the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> or from some other causes, the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Church
reduc'd unto its <HI>Chaos,</HI> partly adher'd unto the Superstition of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> part∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
unto the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or else to the Heresie of the <HI>Nestorians,</HI> who in the
Year 1300. undertaking an Expedition or Voyage from <HI>Chaldea</HI> into <HI>Tartary</HI> to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sow their Tares, infected the Minds of the <HI>Christians</HI> there yet remainining with
the Venome of their impious Opinions, and also taught them, who were igno∣rant
of Writing before, the use of the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Characters, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> use
unto this Day. But how the <HI>Tartars</HI> became <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> read in <HI>Matthias Micheu,</HI>
in his first Book of the <HI>Asiatick Tartary.</HI> And this is that which in brief I esteem'd
requisite to acquaint the Reader with, concerning the Change of the <HI>Christian
Religion</HI> in <HI>China, Tartaria,</HI> and the other Regions of <HI>India.</HI></P>

behold, the Enemy of Mankind, by the Assistance of wicked Men,
threw down at one shock or storm, whatsoever the Church of God had per∣fected
in many years, the Preachers of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> out of the hatred and
envy of the <HI>Bonzii,</HI> being some put to death, and the rest banish'd; whence the
Faithful at that time persever'd in the constancy of the <HI>Faith</HI> receiv'd, even unto
the Death: but their Posterity in process of time, being brought up in the
Rites of the Law of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> even unto the Year 1256. in which the <HI>Great
Cham,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> making an Incursion into <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Cathay</HI> with an
irresistible Army, in a short space, as I have related before, subjected the whole
Country unto his Dominion, who as he was instructed in the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI>
so also a great multitude of <HI>Christians</HI> (as <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> and <HI>Haython</HI> relate) en∣tring
with him, Propagated themselves in a great number, who at length,
when again the Natives recover'd the whole Empire, and expell'd the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
the <HI>Christians</HI> also, whether out of fear of Persecution, or out of hope of living
better among the <HI>Tartars,</HI> left <HI>China</HI> and follow'd them; and those that remain'd
behind, retain'd only some external Ceremonies: And these are those <HI>Christians</HI>
whom the <HI>Chineses,</HI> by the Name of <HI>The Adorers of the Cross,</HI> relate to have liv'd
in <HI>China;</HI> concerning which see what I have said before. Therefore <HI>China</HI> being
again accustom'd unto its Country Worship of Idols, so continu'd unto the
Year 1542. in which a new Light of Truth shone forth unto it; for after that
St. <HI>Francis Xavier,</HI> an Apostle elected by God for the Salvation of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
had sown the Seed of the Word of God through all the unknown Parts of the
World, with a great and incredible gain of Souls, and had gain'd <HI>Iapan,</HI> an
Island hardly noted to the World, unto the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI> at length he ap∣ply'd
his Mind, inflam'd with a thirst of obtaining Souls unto <HI>Christ,</HI> to the
Conversion of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> using his utmost endeavor, that he might become
<PB N="376" REF="206"/>
Master of his Desires: But it seem'd otherwise fit to the Divine disposal of
the Heavenly Majesty; for expecting an opportunity of entring <HI>China,</HI> in <HI>San∣tian,</HI>
an Isle adjoining to the Coasts of <HI>China,</HI> he was seiz'd with a Fever, where
being replenish'd with Merits, and now ready to receive the Reward of Eter∣nal
Blessedness for those his signal Labors perform'd, he rendred his Spirit un∣to
his Creator, and took his flight unto Heaven, and what he could not per∣form
of himself, that he obtain'd with God by his Intercessions, that his Suc∣cessor
in so great a Charge might accomplish after the following manner:
<HI>Alexander Valignanus,</HI> of our Society, who <HI>Anno 1582.</HI> conducted the three Vice-Roys
of <HI>Iapan,</HI> who were Converted to the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> to render Obedience
to Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the Thirteenth; he, I say, had come out of <HI>Europe,</HI> as ap∣pointed
Visitor by the Vicar-General of all the <HI>Indies;</HI> and now having pass'd
over that part of <HI>India</HI> that is on this side of <HI>Ganges,</HI> he set Sail to view that
which is situate on the other side of <HI>Ganges,</HI> and at length arriving in the Port
of <HI>Amaca,</HI> he determin'd with himself to pass over into <HI>Iaponia;</HI> but being hin∣der'd
by the Laws of Navigation, he continu'd full ten Months in our Station
of <HI>Amaca,</HI> where being wholly inform'd of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Affairs, he resolv'd with
great ardency to prosecute the Voyage or Expedition begun by his Predeces∣sors
that hitherto lay hid in the Embers; for from the magnitude of the Em∣pire,
the nobleness of the Nation, their great Peace now enjoy'd for so many
years, the Prudence of the Magistrates, as also the Political Mode of Govern∣ment,
unto which none were admitted, but only such Persons as were accom∣plish'd
in all kinds of Literature: from these Considerations, I say, he most
rationally concluded, That the <HI>Chineses</HI> being a Nation subtle, and addicted
unto the Studies of good Arts, might so far at length be wrought upon, as to
admit of, or tolerate certain Persons excelling in Virtue and Learning, to
abide or inhabit in their Empire, and especially such as were not unskilful in
their Country Language, and Learning; and he seem'd to be of opinion, that
in time it might so come to pass, that the Rules and Statutes of the most holy
<HI>Christian Law</HI> might have a propitious Influence on this Nation, seeing they
were so far from the disturbance of the Political or Civil Administration of
the Republick or Empire, that they would rather highly promote the same;
whence <HI>China</HI> abominating their <HI>Heathenish</HI> Vanities, might conceive an hope
or desire of the Heavenly good things, and have an Eye unto Eternity: there∣fore
on that very account he commanded without any delay, some Persons,
sent for out of <HI>India,</HI> to employ their utmost Endeavors for the attaining of
the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Language and Learning, (they were two <HI>Italians,</HI> one Father <HI>Mi∣chael
Rogerius,</HI> and the other Father <HI>Matthew Riccius:)</HI> which when they had in
some measure attain'd, with very great Industry they entred the City of <HI>Canton,</HI>
with hope to get some Habitation in it; but being often frustrated in their
Intentions, they return'd to <HI>Amaca.</HI> It can hardly be express'd, how many and
various Adventures or Casualties interpos'd, which rendred the Business of
the undertaken Voyage, if not desperate, yet at least very much eclips'd and
fading; all which in the end being overcome, the Matter was brought to the
wish'd Conclusion by Father <HI>Matthew Riccius,</HI> unto whom, by the prosperous
Lot of our Fathers, the first Way was open'd into the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and to
him also the blessed Success of the <HI>Christian Law</HI> ought deservedly to be ascrib'd.
This Person had been formerly the Scholar of Father <HI>Christopher Clavius,</HI> one
very well skill'd in the Mathematical Sciences; he being associated unto Fa∣ther
<HI>Rogerius,</HI> and being stor'd with abundance of curious things, together
<PB N="377" REF="206"/>
with a formal Embassy from the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton,</HI> made
his Entrance into <HI>China,</HI> and so bewitch'd the Fancy of the Governor with the
Novelty of the Presents that he brought with him, that he avouch'd, that nei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
he himself, nor all <HI>China</HI> ever beheld the like; and he also not only retain'd
these Fathers with him as Persons dropt from Heaven, but likewise shew'd
them all the Respect and Civility that possibly he could.</P>
<P>The Fame of such great Matters being nois'd abroad, possess'd the Minds
not only of many Learned Persons in the Kingdom of <HI>Canton,</HI> but throughout
the whole Empire, whom when they could not possibly behold in Presence,
or carry those admirable things with them that were so reported of, they
call'd them unto them every where, by Letters dated out of all the Kingdoms,
to come and behold them: for those things which were now grown common
in <HI>Europe,</HI> were esteem'd as Miracles in <HI>China,</HI> being there as yet both unseen
and unheard of. Now there were amongst the rest a Clock, both exact and
curiously fram'd, shewing besides the Hour of the Day, the Rising and Setting
of the Sun, the Day of the Month, and Age of the Moon: There was also a
Trigonal Glass, which some thought to be an inestimable Iewel, and others
suppos'd it to be a part or portion of the Celestial Orb: moreover, Geogra∣phical
Maps which express'd the Globe of the Earth, unto the grat amazement
and admiration of all:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The igno∣rance of the <HI>Chineses.</HI></NOTE> For as the <HI>Chineses</HI> were of opinion, that there was
nothing else without the vast Empire of <HI>China,</HI> so they could not apprehend
that the Globe of the Earth was furnish'd with so many, and those so Potent
Nations and People unknown to them, that it should be eucompass'd with so
large an Ocean, with so great a multiplicity of Islands here and there on every
side scatter'd abroad; and moreover, that <HI>Europe</HI> should be situate so far off in
the ultimate Recesses of the West, disjoin'd by the interposal of so many Lands
and Seas, resplendent for so many Kingdoms and Monarchs, and more espe∣cially
for the Majesty of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; also that <HI>China</HI> should be plac'd
in the utmost Corner of the East; this indeed they admir'd at, and were withal
much displeas'd, that their Empire, beyond which they imagin'd nothing to
be remaining, yea, which was fix'd in the middle of the Earth as a Iewel in a
Ring, should be cast into the extreme Part of the World. Father <HI>Riccius</HI> being
mov'd at this their Displeasure, that he might not any way abate of that Re∣putation
he had gain'd amongst them, design'd a new Delineation of the
Globe of the Earth in a greater Form, distinguish'd into two Hemispheres,
that <HI>China,</HI> the proportion of the Paralells and Meridians being observ'd and
kept, should be in the middle. Lastly, he Illustrated all the Kingdoms, Regi∣ons,
Provinces, Cities, Mountains, Rivers, Seas, and Lakes, in the <HI>Chinesian</HI>
Characters and Language; which Work, of so universal Diligence and Labor,
you can hardly express how much it drew and fastned the Mind and Eyes of
all upon it, especially seeing that what before they admir'd as a rude indigested
Heap, having no farther understanding of it; now they did not only behold
the Constitution of each Part of the World declar'd in their own Language,
but also comprehended and discover'd all and every Place in it; whence,
when the House was not able to contain the great number of Persons that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame to view this hitherto unseen Work, that many might become partakers
of so great a Good, the Map, at the Cost of the Vice-Roy was speedily En∣graven,
and abundance of the Copies of it were dispers'd through the whole
Empire, which excited such a flame in the Minds of Persons that were curi∣ous,
that they believ'd <HI>Matthew Riccius,</HI> like a reviv'd <HI>Atlas,</HI> to be the most
<PB N="378" REF="207"/>
excellent Astronomer in the whole World, and to have fall'n down from the
Clouds.</P>
<P>The Grandees of the Empire being smitten with those first Fruits of Curio∣sity,
every where labor'd to call our Fathers unto them; but by this means
they were unmeet for so great Undertakings, having sent for divers of the Fa∣thers
of great Abilities from <HI>Maccao,</HI> they employ'd them in Fishing: By this
means, first the Minds or Phantasies of the Great Personages being allur'd by
such preparative Inventions of curious things, as they acquir'd an high esteem
of their admirable Learning and incomparable Wit, so nothing was more easie
than by laying hold on the occasion, which was the chief inducement of their
Voyage into <HI>China,</HI> to discourse concerning the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> and the God
of Heaven.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who for a long space of time had a great Controversie
about the Worship of the True God, being captivated with their great Reason∣ings,
that were strengthned with the weight of Arguments concerning the One
and True God, and the nullity of the <HI>Gentile</HI> Figments and Images, presently
submitted themselves to be instructed in their Worship and Discipline; whence
within a few years, Men of Note, together with other Persons of all States and
Conditions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nobility of <HI>China</HI> re∣ceive the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI></NOTE> discovering the Vanity of their own Religion, being wash'd with
the Sacred Water of Baptism, were receiv'd into the Bosom of our Holy Mo∣ther
the Church; amongst which were many Noble Persons and Governors
of the Empire, whom they term <HI>Mandorins</HI> and <HI>Colao's,</HI> who acknowledging the
Benefit of the Divine Call unto the safe Harbor of <HI>Saving Faith,</HI> so warmly
embrac'd the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> that they seem'd hardly able to rest, before they had
brought over many others to embrace the same: Hence many Books which
deliver'd the Fundamentals of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> were written and dispersed
throughout the whole Empire, to the incredible advantage of Souls.</P>
<P>But the great Enemy of Man-kind suffer'd not such a Prey to be rescu'd
from him; for now Places of Residence being establish'd through the chief
Provinces of the Empire, and Churches also erected unto the Service of God,
by the Envy and Hatred of the <HI>Bonzii,</HI> that is their Priests, who were almost
frantick at the so great Advancement and Propagation of the Divine <HI>Gospel,</HI>
so heavy a Persecution was rais'd against our Fathers and Converts, that often
being clapp'd up in Prison and cruelly tormented, and lastly by their with∣drawing,
and the total exilement of the <HI>Christian Profession,</HI> so happy a Progress
of the <HI>Faith</HI> was almost reduc'd unto the extremest hazard: but by the Assi∣stance
of the Divine Favor, the Constancy of our Fathers, the Books publish'd
by Great Persons whom they had gain'd unto <HI>Christ,</HI> and also by reason of the
great Authority they bore, and the Innocency of the Fathers, demonstrated by
the detection of the Calumnies of the Adversaries, they were restor'd unto their
former Liberty, they learning from this one Example, that it cannot possibly
be brought to pass that such another Persecution should ever go about to ob∣scure
the so famous Fruits, manag'd for the Glory of the Divine Majesty, no
more than a Shadow can put out the Light of the Sun; therefore Matters be∣ing
again brought to this tranquillous Condition, <HI>Christianity</HI> arose to so much
the more heighth, by how much it had been the more lowly and violently de∣press'd;
for the <HI>Faith</HI> did not only extend it self throughout the utmost Bounds
of the Empire, but also entred the Palace of the Emperor; and the inviolable
force of Verity was such, that it drew the Empress and her Son to the love of
it, by the Pains of <HI>Andrew Cosler,</HI> and <HI>Austrian;</HI> who being wash'd with the Wa∣ter
<PB N="379" REF="207"/>
of Baptism, the Empress had the Name of <HI>Helena</HI> given her, and her Son
that of <HI>Constantine;</HI> the chief Minister of whose Court, <HI>Pan Achilleus,</HI> having
also been instructed in the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> and being a Person mightily in∣flam'd
with zeal to propagate the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> often solicited by ardent En∣treaties,
that Letters might be sent unto the Pope, and to the General of the
Society of <HI>Iesus,</HI> for the sending over of a great plenty of Laborers into <HI>China:</HI>
They had so great a Devotion towards the Apostolical See, that what Homage
and Obedience they could not perform in their own Persons, they enjoyn'd
Father <HI>Michael Boim</HI> to discharge at <HI>Rome</HI> unto the Pope in their steads.</P>
<P>Things thus prosperously succeeding, and according to the Desires of all,
behold a new Whirlwind with great violence from the North disturb'd the
prosperous and fortunate Transaction of the <HI>Christian</HI> Affairs, which being esta∣blish'd
and confirm'd by the Broad Seal of the Emperor, they hop'd might have
enlarg'd the Preaching of the <HI>Gospel</HI> throughout the whole Empire: But the
<HI>Tartars</HI> being allur'd or intic'd by the Intestine or Civil Wars of the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
and breaking through the Fortresses of the Walls, did not only reduce <HI>Pequin,</HI>
but, like an Inundation, in little space subjected all <HI>China</HI> unto their Empire.
<HI>Vumly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperor <HI>Vumly,</HI> when he had slain his Wife and Daughter, hang'd him∣self.</NOTE> Emperor of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> being deserted by all, and forc'd to great Exi∣gences,
when no Place of Safeguard was granted unto him by his rebellious
Subjects of <HI>China,</HI> that he might not be compell'd to behold so great a Con∣fluence
of imminent Calamities, having first with his own Hands slain both
his Wife and his Daughter, at length, heightned unto Despair, miserably con∣cluded
his Life by the Halter: Concerning which Occurrences, he that desi∣reth
farther to understand the Catastrophe of Humane Concernments, may
have recourse unto Father <HI>Martinius,</HI> in his Tractate of the <HI>Tartar</HI> War, and
from thence he may learn not to be any farther inquisitive after the heighth of
an unhappy Monarch in such sort exalted, which lieth subject and expos'd un∣to
so horrible Precipices, and so great Ruines, in the so great disturbance of
Affairs, and Confusion of the Empire. The <HI>Christians</HI> plac'd between hope and
fear, with careful Minds expected the Inclination of the new Emperor, unto
the Progress of the <HI>Christian Faith;</HI> and at length they found it more propitious
unto them than ever they could have wish'd or desir'd, in the manner that
followeth.</P>
<P>There had now been residing in <HI>China</HI> for many years Father <HI>Iohn Adam Schall,</HI>
Native of the City of <HI>Colonia</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> who as he was inferior to none, either
in respect of his Knowledge in the Mathematicks and other Sciences in which
he excell'd, or his excellent skill in the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Tongue; or lastly, his Pru∣dence
in the management of Affairs, acquir'd by long Experience; so was he
much fam'd throughout the whole Empire; concerning whom when the new
Emperor had been inform'd many worthy things, as in reference to a Stran∣ger,
he was very much joy'd with this Information, that he had found a Stran∣ger,
which for a long space he had desir'd, so much knowing in all the Affairs
of <HI>China,</HI> unto whom he might safely and securely entrust the closest Secrets of
all his Councils, and whom he discover'd happily to have conjoin'd the <HI>Chine∣sian</HI>
Arts unto an <HI>European</HI> Wit or Capacity; therefore having call'd him to
Court, he receiv'd him with great testimony of Friendship, and observing
the gravity of his Deportment, his Candor of Life, Prudence, and excellent
Wid at sudden Repartees; he was so well pleas'd with his Conversation, that
he immediately created him one of his intimate Councellors, a <HI>Mandorin</HI> of the
prime Rank, and assign'd unto him the highest Place in the Astronomical Tri∣banal
<PB N="380" REF="208"/>
of the Calender, and commanded all throughout the whole Empire to
obey his Astronomical Determinations; he especially wondring at his infal∣lible
Prediction of Eclipse, in which the others did so much err, perform'd by
his accurate Calculation; he admir'd also his skill in the Mechanick Arts,
especially in casting of great Ordnance. The Emperor being taken with these
things, lov'd and honor'd him as a Father, looking upon him as more than
Man, as having something of Divinity about him; and when any Address
was scarcely admitted unto so sublime a Majesty, besides that of the Empress
and Eunuchs, he obtain'd without any Prohibition, a Favor granted to no
other, a Priviledge of coming into the Emperor's Presence, whether at home
or abroad; and therefore he was esteem'd as his <HI>Maffa,</HI> for so the Emperor
call'd him, that is to say, <HI>Venerable Father;</HI> a Priviledge never read of in the
Annals of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> Four times in a Year the Emperor vouchsaf'd to visit
the House and Church of our Society, going into all the Corners of the House:
he was pleas'd to converse with the <HI>Maffa</HI> privately in the Lodging-Room, re∣fusing
all Ceremonies of State befitting so great a Monarch, sometimes sitting
upon the Bed Pallat, and sometime in the old decrepit Chair, condescending to
view some of our Rarities, not refusing to smell Flowers which he Presented
him from his own Garden, and never seem'd more pleasantly to recreate him∣self,
than in the House of the poor Priests; and in the Church he wondred at
the brightness of the Altars, and the elegancy of the <HI>European</HI> Images, cursorily
enquiring concerning the Books, their Characters and Images, with the My∣steries
thereof; which when explain'd unto him, he worshipp'd, especially
the Fignres of <HI>Christ</HI> and the Blessed Virgin, and asserted, That the <HI>Christian Re∣ligion</HI>
was the best, and excell'd all others; that his Ancestors had formerly
been of the same Persuasion. And that he might not seem to esteem of the
<HI>Christian Faith</HI> in words only, he resolv'd to do something in honor thereof;
for on a great Marble Stone erected before the Doors of our Church, he caus'd
to be Engraven in <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Tartar</HI> Characters, his Will and Pleasure for the
Propagation of the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> by a Regal Edict, which at this Day is to be
seen Printed on a <HI>China</HI> Sheet of Paper in the Library of the <HI>Roman</HI> Colledge,
and is as followeth:</P>
<P>THE Heavenly Science of Astronomy (which our Progenitors so highly esteem'd of,
as we also do who trace their Footsteps) deserves to be extoll'd to the Skies, especi∣ally
after the same, formerly under divers Emperors being almost wholly collaps'd, is restor'd,
and especially hath been rendred more exact by <HI>Co Zeu Kim,</HI> in the time of the Empire of
<HI>Iuen,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who formerly Rul'd the <HI>Chineses</HI> four hundred years;
and lastly, was become very erroneous in the latter part of the Reign of the former Emperor
<HI>Mim.</HI> There is found <HI>Iohn Adam Schall,</HI> coming from the farthest part of the West
into <HI>China,</HI> who understandeth not only the Art of Calculation, but also the Theory of the
Planets, and whatsoever doth belong unto Astronomy; he being brought unto the Emperor
our Antecessor, by his Command took upon him the care of restoring the Mathematicks and
Astronomy in the University; but because that many apprehended not the Fruit that would
redound unto the Commonwealth from this Science, he could not then conclude that his Sub∣jects
should employ themselves in that Science; but now I being come unto the Empire, make
the order of Time my first care, as conducing to the Profit and Advantage of my Empire:
for in the Autumn of the first Year of my Rule, demanding an Experiment in that Art which
<HI>Iohn Adam</HI> hath restor'd, I commanded him to observe the Ecliyse of the Sun, which he
had most diligently Calculated long before, and having found both the Moments of Time, and
<PB N="381" REF="208"/>
also the Points of the Eclipse most exactly to correspond in all Circumstances with his Calcu∣lation;
and also in the Spring of the following Year, when there was an Eclipse of the Moon;
commanding him with the same Diligence to observe it, I also found this not to err or dif∣fer
an Hairs breadth: wherefore I presently discern'd, that Heaven sent this Person unto
us at such a time, in which I undertook the Regiment of so great an Empire, whence I com∣mitted
unto him the whole Government of the Mathematical Tribunal; but because <HI>Iohn
Adam</HI> is chaste from his Youth, and will not undertake any Business contrary to the Rules
of the Religious Order, I thought it necessary to bind him with an absolute Command to un∣dertake
this Function, and to add the Dignity of the second Order unto the Title of the Ma∣ster
of the Celestial Secrets; in which Office he having been employ'd for some Years, hath
daily increas'd his Diligence and Study: And because he hath a Temple or Church near the
Gate of the City, nam'd <HI>Xun Che Muen,</HI> in which, according to the Rites of his Law or
Religion he Offereth Sacrifices unto God, I therefore contributed some Assistance unto him
for the building and adorning of it; and when I entred that Temple, I discern'd the Images
and Utensils of it to have the shapes of strange things; and when I had ask'd him what the
Books of his Religion (which I found on the Table) contain'd? he answer'd, That they con∣tain'd
the Explication of the Divine Law: Indeed, although I had first apply'd my Study
to the Doctrine or Religion <HI>Yao Xun Cheu,</HI> and learn'd some things out of their Books
<HI>Cum Cu,</HI> and albeit I have read somewhat in the Books <HI>Foe</HI> and <HI>Tau,</HI> yet notwithstand∣ing
I can remember nothing contain'd in them; and seeing I could not, by reason of the Af∣fairs
of my Kingdom, hitherto peruse the Books of this Divine Law, but onely cursorily,
therefore I cannot pass an exact Iudgment out of them concerning the Law; but if you re∣flect
upon, or consider Father <HI>Iohn Adam,</HI> who for many years having been conversant
with the <HI>Chineses</HI> and with us, followeth this Law, and Preacheth the same, then I judge
and esteem it the best; for <HI>Iohn Adam</HI> doth so reverence his God, that he hath dedicated
this Temple unto him with so great Modesty and Integrity, for so many years always conform∣ing
himself in the same method of this Law, and not in the least point varying from it: this
indeed is an evident sign that the Law is most perfect, in which <HI>Iohn Adam</HI> sheweth him∣self
of most approved Vertue, and fulfilleth that exactly by his Fidelity which that Law teach∣eth
or commandeth, <HI>viz.</HI> To serve God, to obey Kings and Magistrates, to do no wrong to
any Person, and to have respect to the Good and Welfare of the Commonwealth and our
Neighbors: And would to God, that all my Magistrates, Officers, and Subjects, would
imitate this his Method in serving of God, and keeping of this his Divine Law, and at a long
distance would but shadow this in the Homage they owe unto their Emperor; without doubt
it would fall out better, and far more happily with me and my whole Empire. As for my
own part, I praise, and greatly approve of this his Belief and Law which he followeth; and
therefore in a perpetual Commemoration I affix this Title to his Church, <HI>Tum hiuen hia
Kim,</HI> that is, <HI>The excellent Place for ascending to Heaven.</HI> Given at <HI>Peking</HI>
the seventh Year of our Empire.</P>
<P>This Patent, written in the <HI>Chinesian</HI> and <HI>Tartar</HI> Languages and Characters,
on a black Table, by a polite and elegant Hand, is to be seen in our Study or
Gallery; and the <HI>Tartar</HI> Characters do indeed resemble the form of the <HI>Syriack,</HI>
wholly different from those of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> Now on what occasion the <HI>Tartar</HI>
granted this Priviledge, is related before. From whence it is manifestly appa∣rent,
what affection so great a Monarch had for the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> and how
much he endeavor'd the promotion and promulgation thereof, even to the
embracing of it himself, confessing the only obstacle of his Conversion was
<HI>Polygamie;</HI> which Doctrine being so dissonant to the Customs and Nature of
the <HI>Heathen</HI> Princes, made them boggle at first, and then flie from that <HI>True
<PB N="382" REF="209"/>
Faith</HI> they were ready to receive, to the perdition of their Souls. But to return
to our purpose.</P>
<P>From this most ardent propensity of the Emperor unto our Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Noble <HI>Chineses</HI> con∣verted to the <HI>Christian Re∣ligion.</HI></NOTE> im∣mediately
there succeeded a great Conversion of the Ladies of Honor, the Eu∣nuchs,
and <HI>Mandorins;</HI> the <HI>Christian Law</HI> being spread abroad in the City of
<HI>Peking,</HI> there were gather'd into the Bosom of the Church almost eighty thou∣sand
Converts. But all this flourishing and Blooming Spring was blasted in
the Bud by the sudden Death of the Emperor, he not obtaining that Eternal
Salvation which he so much desir'd on the behalf of others; and although of∣tentimes
he requested the Ghostly Assistance of Father <HI>Adam,</HI> yet by the craft
and subtlety of the <HI>Lamas</HI> and <HI>Bonzii,</HI> who stood before the Emperor in the last
Conflict of Life and Death, it so fell out, that all Address to him was obstructed
till it was too late; for being frustrate of his hope, whom he thought alive,
he to his incredible sorrow found dead. Now when his Funeral Rites were
perform'd, a Pile being made of precious Wood, the Treasures of so wealthy
a Prince were cast into the Flames with the dead Corps, which put an end to
his Imperial Magnificence and Grandeur.</P>
<P>The Son of this deceased Emperor, being a Youth of fourteen Years of Age,
succeeded him in the Government; who as he was under the Discipline and
Tuition of Father <HI>Adam,</HI> being wholly committed unto his Care by the Em∣peror,
so he devested not himself of that innate Affection which he had to the
<HI>Christian Faith</HI> and our Religious Fathers.</P>
<P>Now how much the <HI>Christian</HI> Concerns were augmented under these Empe∣rors
in respect of former Times, is evidently shewn by the Inscription of the
new erected and Consecrated Church at <HI>Peking,</HI> which, as being worthy of
Consideration, I shall here subjoyn in stead of a Conclusion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Correction of the Chinese Calendar, and how much
Good redounded from thence.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Chineses</HI> never so much delighted in any thing, as in an exact Cal∣culation
of Times and Seasons, without which they justly believ'd,
that neither the Actions of Princes, or Histories of any Age could
methodically be compos'd, always endeavoring to confirm the same, if their
Rules of the Astronomical Science had not fail'd them; for they relate in their
Annals, that they have had an Academy of Astronomers maintain'd at the
Publick and Royal Cost above three thousand nine hundred Years, whose
Employment was to compute the Course of the Sun and Moon, and the Eclip∣ses,
and as accurately as might be to note the Houses of the New-Moons en∣tring,
and her other Apearances, that by these Lunary Observations they
might give Advice to the Husbandman, and others concern'd; for they had
no knowledge of the various Walks of the Planets, but were of an Opinion,
before the arrival of the Fathers of our Society, that all the Constellations of
what Sphere soever, were equally distant from the Earth; discovering there∣by
their gross ignorance in this Science.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> relate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The original of the <HI>Chine∣sian Astrono∣my.</HI></NOTE> That their Astronomy had its original from a very an∣cient
King call'd <HI>Iao;</HI> who had two Brothers, one nam'd <HI>Hy,</HI> and the other
<HI>Ho,</HI> most famous for their Skill in Astronomy, whom he enjoin'd to declare
and set down in a short and clear Method whatsoever they thought might be
known concerning the Compute of Times, to be observ'd by a constant Rule;
which they perform'd with such care and diligence as was requisite; but after
the space of about two thousand years, <HI>Cin Hoam</HI> obtain'd the Empire, who in
the thirty fourth Year of his Reign did not only prohibit the use of all Arts,
but also caus'd to be burnt all the Books that he could find; but so it hapned
in course of Time, that amongst the Ruines of vast Fabricks, the so long de∣sir'd
Astronomical Volumes were discover'd, to the universal joy of the Em∣pire:
but as they had lain neglected for the space of so many years, so also
they were found so erroneous, that they were of little use without Correcti∣on;
the Emendation of which was at length undertaken by one <HI>Cofcencin,</HI>
an Astronomer of great note in <HI>China.</HI> At length it came to pass also, but
how I know not, that a Book concerning the Diurnal Motion of the Planets
was found preserv'd in the Kings Library, which was Presented by the Am∣bassador
sent out of <HI>Persia</HI> to the Emperor of <HI>Tartary,</HI> when the <HI>Tartars</HI> were
expuls'd out of <HI>China</HI> by the Emperor <HI>Humun:</HI> He caus'd the same Book to be
Translated out of the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue into the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Language,
hoping that in time to come their <HI>Chinesian</HI> Calendar might be restor'd unto its
pristine Perfection. But the <HI>Mandorins</HI> most Learned in the Arts, not fully un∣derstanding
the subtle Theories of the <HI>Persians,</HI> it came to pass that the <HI>Chinesian</HI>
Calender remain'd uncorrected until the arrival of the Fathers.</P>
<P>The Masters of the Astronomical Function being forc'd to make use of their
accustom'd erroneous Tables in the yearly Publication of the Lunaries, with
such grand Escapes in the computing Eclipses; in which having in vain em∣ploy'd
themselves three years, they ingeniously acknowledg'd that they were
<PB N="384" REF="212"/>
wonderfully mistaken; and therefore they Presented a Petition to the Empe∣ror,
in which they shew'd the great necessity of correcting the Calendar, re∣commending
unto him the Fathers of the great Western part of the World,
both in relation to their Skill in Astronomy, and also the acuteness of their In∣genuity
in that Art.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Fathers appointed to Correct the <HI>Calendar</HI> by the Empe∣ror's Edict.</NOTE> The Emperor, when he had read the Petion, was very
much rejoyced, and assented unto whatsoever they desir'd, and presently by
his Proclamation manifested his Majesties high Pleasure for the carrying on
of the Work without delay.</P>
<P>Our Fathers being exalted to an Honor they never durst hope for, or ever
could desire a Means more commodious for the Propagation of the <HI>Gospel</HI> of
<HI>Christ,</HI> most willingly apply'd themselves to a Business of that great and weigh∣ty
concernment: Those that were first employ'd were Father <HI>Sabatinus de
usrsis,</HI> and Father <HI>Iacobus Pantoja, Anno 1611.</HI> Persons excelling in the Know∣ledge
of the Astronomical Sciences. Father <HI>Sabatinus</HI> immediately endeavor'd
to have the Theories of the Planets, very necessary to the understanding of
the Motion of the Constellations, Translated out of the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue into the
<HI>Chinesian,</HI> by the assistance of two <HI>Mandorins, Paul</HI> and <HI>Leo,</HI> now become <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI>
who with great proficiency had sometime since attain'd the Astrono∣mical
Disciplines, by the instruction of Father <HI>Matthew Riccius:</HI> Then he ap∣ply'd
himself to find out the Longitude of the City of <HI>Peking,</HI> by Observati∣ons
made by his Correspondents both in <HI>China, India,</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> without
which the Calculation of Eclipses is altogether in vain undertaken. <HI>Pantoja</HI>
undertook to search out the Latitude of the Cities of <HI>China;</HI> and beginning
from <HI>Canton,</HI> he most exactly measur'd with the Astrolabe through the Latitude
of the whole Empire, in a direct Line from the South unto the Limits of the
North of <HI>Peking,</HI> sporting himself both Night and Day in the indagation of
the preparative Exercises, concerning which there was not the least hint in the
<HI>Chinesian</HI> Astronomy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Errors of the <HI>Chineses</HI> in <HI>Geography.</HI></NOTE> And although the <HI>Chineses</HI> vaunt so much of their great
Excellency above other Nations in subtlety of Wit, yet they knew not what
the Longitude or Latitude of Places was; so that when the Fathers of our So∣ciety
first entred into <HI>China,</HI> and caus'd some Sun-Dyals to be made, they ad∣mir'd
that the Cities of <HI>China,</HI> should be under divers Elevations of the Pole,
in regard they assign'd but thirty six Degrees unto the whole Empire, relying
upon the Tradition of the Ancients, who foolishly persuaded themselves, that
the Earth was not Globular, but that it was extended into an infinite Super∣ficies,
and that the Sun and Moon about or under the West, entered into a cer∣tain
deep Cave, from which again they arose about the East: And moreover,
that the Sun and Moon were no bigger than what the Eye demonstrated them
to be, <HI>viz.</HI> that those lucid Bodies are not above six Handfuls in magnitude:
from whence it is manifest, how maim'd, lame, and impefect the <HI>Chinesian</HI>
Astronomy was.</P>
<P>But to return to our purpose: This happy beginning of the Emendation
of the Calendar continu'd not long, by reason that the Academy of the Ma∣thematical
Colledge being enrag'd at our Fathers for the great Honor con∣ferr'd
upon them by the Emperor, Presented an humble Petition to him, in
which, with great eagerness, they complain'd of the suppression of the Studies
of their Country Sciences, and of the signal Advancement of <HI>Barbarians</HI> in
the Royal Employment: But the Emperor having fully discover'd the im∣perfection
and deformity of the several Computations made by the Adversa∣ries,
and that the Calculations of our Fathers always agreed to the Point of
<PB N="385" REF="212"/>
the Prediction, at length, by a new Patent, granted unto the Fathers a plenary
Power, in reference unto the Astronomical Arts, Father <HI>Iohn Terentius</HI> being
more especially taken into this Employment, at the Request of the <HI>Mandorins
Paul</HI> and <HI>Leo.</HI></P>
<P>This Father <HI>Iohn Terentius</HI> was a <HI>German</HI> of the City of <HI>Constance,</HI> who before
he entred into our Society, was in great favor and request with Princes and
Noble Personages, for his exact Knowledge of the occult Secrets of Nature,
and happy Skill in Physick; but weary of his Honor and Fame, divulg'd far
and near, and renouncing the World, he resolv'd to employ his Talent in the
Conversion of the <HI>Infidels;</HI> wherefore he undertook the <HI>Indian</HI> Expedition,
which he obtain'd with no great Labor; for as he shew'd himself an indefa∣tigable
Searcher out of the Mysteries of Nature, so now by this Opportunity
he pass'd the vast Voyages of the Ocean, not after the manner of idle Persons,
and such as sleep away their Time, or spend it in other trivial Employment;
but our <HI>Terentius</HI> left nothing uninquir'd after, whether you have an Eye to the
natural Situation of Promontories, or Coasts, the original of Winds, the Pro∣perties
of the Sea, and the varieties of Fish therein.</P>
<P><HI>Terentius</HI> being now arriv'd in <HI>India</HI> in the Fields and Woods, and being a
most skilful <HI>Botanist,</HI> he met with no kind of Plant, but having most exactly
examin'd, he entred them in his Book, together with their proper shapes, and
distinct forms. Hence, having search'd out the Coasts of <HI>India, Bengala, Ma∣laca,
Sumatra, Couchinchina,</HI> and the Rarities of Nature worthy of consideration,
he at last arriv'd at <HI>Maccao,</HI> and from thence he came into <HI>China,</HI> the accom∣plishment
of his Desires, over all which he travell'd by a direct, transverse,
and oblique Voyage; and because many Rarities of Natures Secrets more per∣spicuously
presented themselves in these most distant Climates, <HI>viz.</HI> in Stones,
Plants, Animals, and in the Customs and Manners of the Inhabitants, he left
no way unsearch'd, nor means unexamin'd, but made trial of the Vertues of
each by Philosophical Experiments; and as he was not unskilful in Painting,
he exhibited each of them Pencil'd to the Life with his own Hands, according
to the Prototype or Draught of Nature, unto the admiration of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> in
two large Volumes, which he call'd <HI>Indian Pliny,</HI> a Title becoming so great and
worthy a Work. It was the only intention of this Person by these his admira∣ble
Secrets, first to lay open a way for himself, and at length for others, both of
the Learned, and also of the <HI>Mandorins,</HI> to obtain their Assent for a Liberty of
Preaching the <HI>Gospel;</HI> which he so dextrously gain'd, that there was hardly
any Person that did not esteem and honor him as a Man sent down from
Heaven; and being an excellent Physician, he was sent for at last unto all
Persons, of what Estate or Condition soever they were, that were afflicted
with any Distemper, whom with the Embracements of the Bowels of an in∣vincible
Charity, he both cur'd of their Bodily Distempers, and heal'd their
Souls that were oppress'd and infected with the Darkness of <HI>Gentilism,</HI> by the
<HI>Word of Life,</HI> unto the incredible Fruit and Advantage of the <HI>Christian</HI> Com∣monwealth:
Therefore being intent on these Concernments, after the so
long suspended Business of the mending of the Calendar, and the Return of
our Fathers from Exile, as a Master now a long while Exercis'd in the Astro∣nomical
Disciplines, by the Labor of <HI>Leo</HI> the <HI>Mandorin,</HI> now Converted unto
the <HI>Cristian Faith,</HI> he was sent for unto <HI>Peking,</HI> at the Emperor's Cost to correct
the Calendar,; but while he was employ'd in this Affair, being seiz'd on by
Death, the Business was obstructed, to the great Grief of all Persons, and more
<PB N="386" REF="213"/>
especially of the Emperor: Yet there wanted not new <HI>Atlases;</HI> for in his
Place was substituted Father <HI>Iacob Rho</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> of the City of <HI>Milan,</HI> and Fa∣ther
<HI>Iohn Adam,</HI> who by an united Force undertook the prosecution of this
Undertaking: But Father <HI>Rho</HI> departing this Life, the whole Management
of this weighty Affair was laid on the Shoulders of Father <HI>Adam,</HI> who with
the Applause of the whole Empire made a final Conclusion thereof. But the
malice of their Adversaries can hardly be express'd, who in their Apologeti∣cal
Writings to the Emperor, complaining, that they had prescrib'd the Laws
of the Arts and Sciences unto the <HI>Chineses,</HI> to the Disgrace and Signal Con∣tempt
of the whole Empire; and that <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and Sons of an unknown
Land, should be exalted with so great Honor from the Emperor, and that by
the Imperial <HI>Diploma</HI> or Patent; as if the excellency of Wit of all the Learned
<HI>Chineses</HI> concentred in the Heads of two obscure Persons, leaving them for the
future no hope of Glory. And when they could accomplish nothing by such
like Accusations, returning unto horrible Calumnies, they were invective
against our Fathers, as the Overthrowers of the Republick, the Contemners
of the Gods, Promulgers of a New Law, wholly and diametrically contrary
unto theirs. The Emperor perceiving their Malice, answer'd, <HI>That the Astro∣nomical
Government had nothing to do with their Religion, and that they should know his
Royal Iudgment was just and right, which, laying aside all respect, was confirm'd in the
truth of reforming the Calendar, and Calculation of the Eclipses, in which he had long since
found them very much mistaken, always discovering the Calculation of our Fathers to an∣swer
exactly to their Predictions.</HI> Wherefore he commanded them to cease from
Contentions, or otherwise he would immediately inflict due Punishments
with Iustice and Severity upon the unjust Slanderers. Therefore being as it
were thunder-struck, they desisted from any further Contradiction, judging it
more fit for some space to decline the Displeasure of the Emperor, than by
such Accusations to lose all hope of further Proportion, and to run the hazard
of Banishment, and the loss of Life it self.</P>
<P>Now the Emperor, by Nature most curious, respected and favor'd our Fa∣thers
for the great Collection of Books which they made for reforming the
<HI>Chinesian</HI> Astronomy, which they Presented unto him. The first of these was
an Astronomical Book of <HI>Logarithms,</HI> adapted unto the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Accompt,
which, besides that it was involv'd with innumerable Difficulties, was altoge∣ther
insufficient for all manner of Astronomical Operations: for what they
could not perform by <HI>Addition, Substraction,</HI> and the other known kinds of
Numbers alone, those our Fathers, by introducing the <HI>European</HI> Compute,
comprehended in a few Lines.</P>
<P>They also publish'd a Treatise of <HI>Trigonometry,</HI> so necessary to the accom∣plishment
of Astronomical Conclusions; concerning which, the <HI>Chineses</HI> even
unto that very Day had not receiv'd the least glimpse.</P>
<P>There also follow'd another Work of the <HI>Opticks,</HI> in which was describ'd
the Situations of the Stars, their Magnitude, their Distance from the Earth,
and also from one another, the Doctrine of <HI>Parallaxes,</HI> of their other Acci∣dents
and Phaenomena's, or Appearances.</P>
<P>Next to this, succeeded the <HI>Mechanicks,</HI> or the Use and Making of Astrono∣mical
Instruments; with which the Emperor being much delighted, they re∣duplicated
his Ioy, by Presenting him with each Instrument, as they were
newly made in <HI>Europe;</HI> and he was so taken therewith, that he gave a strict
Order they should be laid up in the most withdrawing Recess of his Bed-Chamber;
<PB N="387" REF="213"/>
and that he might exactly understand each, he would be instruct∣ed
therein by the Fathers. And from that time they obtain'd not only what
concern'd Learning, but also the Propagation of the <HI>Gospel</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> accom∣panied
with Revenues necessary for their own Private Support. Moreover,
the Emperor deputed an hundred of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Astronomers, who should
acquiesce in the Iudgment of Father <HI>Adam Schall</HI> in the Decision of all things,
as the Supreme Head and Arbiter of the Tribunal of Rites or Astronomical
Council. Which Edict was confirm'd with so great force, that to this very
Day no Person whatsoever durst so much as motion any thing contrary unto
it: And his Authority was such, that no <HI>Ephimerides,</HI> which was wont every
year to be divulg'd through the Empire, might now be Publish'd, without it
were Compos'd or Authoriz'd by him, a great Penalty being inflicted on those
that should act to the contrary.</P>
<P>They that desire to know more concerning the Matters above-mention'd,
may have recourse to the Relation (if ever it chance to be Publish'd) which
Father <HI>Adam Schall</HI> hath compil'd concerning the reformation of the <HI>Chinesian</HI>
Astronomy, which I have read in the Manusctipt; where the curious Reader
will see with admiration how much the Labors of these our Fathers have
contributed to the Propagation of the <HI>Gospel</HI> of our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> through∣out
the vast and extensive Dominions of the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> and how
much Glory, Honor, and Reputation hath thence redounded unto all <HI>Europe:</HI>
And from the extraordinary Favor and Kindness that Father <HI>Adam Schall</HI> re∣ceiv'd
on all occasions from the Emperor, we may conceive great hopes of
the Conversion of these <HI>Infidels;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or certainly this Great Prince is himself so
inclinable to the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> in which he acknowledgeth his Predecessors
to have been formerly instructed, that being convinc'd by the undeniable
Truth of our most Holy <HI>Faith</HI> he hath for a long while since determin'd to
receive <HI>Baptism,</HI> but that the affection he beareth unto <HI>Polygamie,</HI> which con∣sists
not with the Purity of our <HI>Religion,</HI> and the Precepts of the <HI>Divine Law</HI>
which <HI>Christ</HI> has commanded us, hath proved an Obstacle to his Conversion;
and this is it also which equally hindereth the Consents of all the <HI>Indian</HI> Prin∣ces
to this Holy Resolution: Otherwise he willingly admitteth of <HI>Christians,</HI>
especially the <HI>Doctors of the Divine Law of the Great Western World</HI> (for so
he termeth the <HI>Europeans)</HI> by whose means he saith he hath learn'd from the
Ancient Monuments of his Predecessors, that the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> was former∣ly
Preach'd and Receiv'd throughout all <HI>Tartary;</HI> to confirm which his Opi∣nion,
he acknowledgeth, that in many Places of his Empire of <HI>Tartary</HI> Cros∣ses
and other Emblems of <HI>Christianity</HI> have been found: And he glorieth that
the Characters which they use in Writing, the <HI>Tartars</HI> receiv'd from the Ma∣sters
of the <HI>Divine Law</HI> of the West: So that in this respect he hath very little
favor or regard for the frantick and detestable Worship of the abominable De∣ities
of the <HI>Bonzii;</HI> and if at any time he be inforc'd by his own Imperial
Law to go to their Temple, according to the Custom of his Predecessors, it
is not out of Religious but Politick respects; for he hath a natural antipathy
to the Manners of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which is evident from his rejecting the Habit
which the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Emperors used to wear, and commanding the Great Of∣ficers
of his Court to follow his Example: And that the difference may be
the better discern'd, the following Figure gives the Representation of the
Emperor in his Royal Habit; and also the Portraiture of Father <HI>Adam Schall,</HI>
in the Habit Generally worn there by the Fathers of our Order. The Em∣peror's
<PB N="388" REF="214"/>
Robe is adorn'd with Embroider'd Dragons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe∣ror's Habit,</NOTE> and Feathers of Birds,
as also with Iewels and Pearls of inestimable Value, by which he strikes an
awful and reverential Fear into the Minds of his Subjects.</P>
<P>Now the Cause why all that have Admission into the Emperor's Court
stand near the Throne with their Arms hanging down, is this; The <HI>Tartars</HI>
esteem it a grand Misdemeanor in the Presence, to Gesticulate acting with the
Hands, or moving with the Feet; from whence fearing his high Displeasure,
they stand like Statues without any Motion, with their Eyes fix'd on the
Earth: the Emperor by the same Posture on his part, seemeth to demon∣strate
what others ought to do, neither may any one dare to appear in his Pre∣sence
in any other Habit but that which the Dignity of his Office, or the Mode
of the Royal Employment prescribeth; for by that Habit his Office is known,
both by the Emperor and all others. Hence by the Figure of a Crane on the
Breast of Father <HI>Adam Schall,</HI> is declar'd the Dignity of his Place. And because
it is esteem'd dishonorable to come into the Presence on foot, therefore both
the <HI>Colai</HI> and the <HI>Mandorins</HI> of the highest Rank, are carried in magnificent
Chairs plac'd on Mens Shoulders.</P>
<P>Now how much this Habit is different from the Habit of the Emperors
of <HI>China,</HI> the Reader may easily collect from that Figure which is exhibited in
the first place of the Geographical Chart of the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> where I have
also set down the proper Habits of the private Persons in each Province.
Moreover, in the time of <HI>Matthew Riccius,</HI> in which the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Emperors
Reigned, the chief <HI>Colai</HI> and <HI>Mandorins</HI> of the Tribunals were also Vested in a
different Habit, such as is this that followeth, where you see the Habit of Fa∣ther
<HI>Paul Riccius,</HI> which is proper and peculiar to the Doctors of the great We∣stern
World, which the Fathers of our Society us'd constantly before the In∣vasion
of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>The other is the Pourtraicture of Doctor <HI>Paul,</HI> long since Converted unto
the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> by the aforesaid <HI>Paul Riccius,</HI> a Man of a most quick and clear
Iudgment, who as he was a great <HI>Colaus</HI> of the Empire, and of great Authority
among the <HI>Chineses,</HI> so both by his Preaching and Writing he very much Illu∣strated
the <HI>Christian Religion:</HI> But seeing the Historians of <HI>China</HI> have suffici∣ently
describ'd their Lives, and the Grandeur of their Actions, I thought it not
requisite to repeat them; wherefore it shall suffice here to set down both their
Pictures in the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Habit.</P>
<P>Now the Emperor of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> before the Irruption of of the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
when he went unto the Tribunal, was accustom'd to present himself unto
view, like a petty Deity, from a lofty Place, at a Window; he bore in his
Hand a Skreen of Ivory to cover his Face, and another half a Cubit long over
his Royal Diadem, from which, Precious Stones of inestimable Price were so
inserted on Threds, that they hung down, and by their lustre mask'd his Pre∣sence
from the Eyes of the Beholders.</P>
<P>As for the Women, the <HI>Chineses</HI> have this Custom: The Plebeians and
poorer sort buy their Wives, and as often as they please sell them again. The
Emperor, and the Royal Lineage, in their Matrimonial Contracts, have re∣gard
only to the Beauty of the Body, not to the Riches or Quality of those
they Marry: Neither do the Noble Personages aspire unto such Marriages,
by reason that the Queens and Empresses have little Command, and being
confin'd in their Palace, are for ever depriv'd the of sight of their Relations;
and also because in the Election that is made by the Magistrates who look after
<PB N="389" REF="214"/>
the Concernments of Marriage, very few of an innumerable company are ad∣vanc'd
to the Dignity of the Royal Bed. The Emperor hath one primary
Wife, besides which he and the Heir to the Crown Marrieth nine others some∣what
inferior; and lastly, thirty six others, all which enjoy the Conjugal
Title: Unto these are added a far greater number of Concubines, which are
neither term'd Queens, Empresses, or Wives, reserv'd for collateral Pleasure.
The primary Wife only sitteth at Table with her Husband, all the rest, especi∣ally
those that are not of the Royal Kindred, are Servants to the Prince, and
Ladies of Honor unto the Empress, who in the Presence are not permitted to
sit; neither do their Sons call them Mother, but the primary Wife.</P>
<P>It can hardly be express'd how strictly the Women are kept throughout the
whole Empire, not only those of Quality, but the common sort, who are ob∣lig'd
by an inviolable Law so strictly, that not only those Persons that are not
ally'd unto them by any Affinity, but also those that are near unto them by
Blood, yea, their very Children come not at them; for the Womens Apart∣ments
are so contriv'd, that they can neither see or be seen by others; from
whence they very seldom have liberty granted to go abroad, and if upon an
urgent Occasion they obtain it, they are so clos'd up in Sedans, that there is
not so much as a Chink or Cranny left open to shew themselves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> esteem their Beauty chiefly to consist in small Statute and lit∣tle
Feet, so that what may seem unto us unbecoming, they esteem as Miracles
of Beauty; whence from their Infancy their Feet are so closely Swath'd,
which continueth all their Life, that they can hardly go without great pain:
If you demand a Reason of them, they answer, That they have observ'd this
Custom (deriv'd to them about two thousand eight hundred years since) from
the Example of <HI>Tachia,</HI> the Wife of the Emperor <HI>Chei,</HI> which Empress for her
incredible Beauty they suppose to be plac'd amongst the Goddesses, and there∣fore
she is esteem'd by them for the <HI>Chinesian Venus;</HI> and they feign the Beauty
of this Personage to have arose from nothing else but the strait binding of
her Feet, which consequently caus'd the smallness of them. Others say, That
this Coercitation was Enacted by a Law of the wise Men, that Women may
learn to sit at home, which if they do not voluntarily, they are by this means
compell'd. Their Habit is modest and full of Gravity, being veil'd so, that
no part of their Body is naked, except the Face: They adorn their Heads,
especially the more Noble sort (and those that live at Court) with divers
Wreaths or Fillets beset with Precious Stones, which add wonderful splendor:
Their Vests interwoven with Flowers, Birds, and the like Ornaments, trail at
their Feet, but yet so, that what they esteem their chief Beauty is not obscur'd;
and to pass away their Time, they sport with little Dogs, Birds, and such
Delights: But that their Habit may be the better understood, the Attire of
the Court-Ladies is set forth in the annexed Figure, brought from <HI>China</HI> by
some of our Society.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Mode that our Fathers are wont to proceed in, in the
Conversion of the Chineses.</HEAD>
<P>IF ever any Monarchy in the World were Constituted according to Politi∣cal
Principles, and the Dictates of Right Reason, I dare be bold to say it
is that of <HI>Chineses;</HI> for in it I find all things dispos'd in so great order,
that whereas all in a manner are subject to the Pleasure and Command of the
Learned, so almost nothing is transacted in the whole Empire which hath not
a dependance on them; neither is any one advanc'd to any Dignity before
he is sufficiently instructed in their Learning and Arts, and by a rigid Exami∣nation
of the Learned Tribunal hath first been approv'd; and no Person can
obtain any Office of great Port and Honor, unless he be found to be eminent
in the Knowledge of the Sciences, and the Principles and Intrigues of Policy;
and these have the Charge of the Empire, whom they vulgarly term <HI>Mando∣rins,</HI>
Governors of Cities, or Vice-Roys of Provinces, who are distributed in
such order, that nothing hapneth throughout the whole Empire, which the
Emperor is not made acquainted with: And seeing the Dictates of the Em∣peror,
have the Oligation of a Law amongst his People, there is no Person but
doth forthwith put in Execution his Will and Pleasure, under the Penalty of
privation of his Office and Dignity, than which nothing is more feared by
them; so that the least Concernment falleth not out in so vast an Empire,
that hath relation either to the Machinations or Plots of Forein Enemies, or
the Fidelity and Care, or the negligence of the <HI>Mandorins</HI> in their Charge; or
lastly, the Revenues of the Empire, and Grievances of the Empire, which is
not first made known by these sorts of <HI>Mandorins</HI> unto the <HI>Colai,</HI> and by them
immediately the Supreme Monarch hath Intelligence, whence every one dis∣chargeth
his Place with incredible Care and Solicitude, without any respect
had either to Friends or Kindred.</P>
<P>Now seeing that amongst all their other Laws, one of the chiefest is that
by which all Foreiners and Strangers are prohibited entrance into <HI>China,</HI> it may
easily be collected from this Discourse, compar'd with what is related in the
Histories of <HI>China,</HI> how great the Difficulties were which our Fathers labor'd
under for divers Years, to procure a Dispensation from this Law, (which by
the favor of Almighty God they at last obtain'd,) if you consider their unskil∣fulness
in the Language, which is the most abstruse of all others to write and
speak, and in which if a Stranger be not well vers'd, he can neither lie ob∣scur'd
without the Character of Treason, or Commerce in Publick, without
evident danger of Banishment, or infliction of Torments, being presently dis∣cover'd
not only from the pronunciation of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Speech, but also by
their Persons very much differing from the <HI>Chineses.</HI> These things being
prov'd by experience, it was concluded, that none should undertake this Ex∣pedition
who was not in some tolerable measure instructed in the <HI>Chinesian</HI>
Language at <HI>Maccao,</HI> (where on purpose the New Converts, Teachers of the
same, werekept) that being skill'd in the Tongue, and obliging the Minds of
the <HI>Mandorins</HI> by some curious Presents of their Ingenuity, they might the bet∣ter
expect a Return of their Labor: for there is no Place for them to boast of
<PB N="391" REF="215"/>
Metaphysical Speculations, nor Study of Scholastical Quirks and Subtleties, or
more sublime Theories; but you must extract and shew some undertaken
<HI>Specimens</HI> of the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> and things sensible, both to cause admiration,
and to gain a Repute to the <HI>European</HI> World. Lastly, some Documents of <HI>Mo∣ral
Philosophy,</HI> unto which they are addicted, to be approv'd not by vain gaiety
of Words, but Example of an exquisite, excellent, and innocent Life, re∣mov'd
from all desires of Mundane Pretensions, such as becometh the Apo∣stolical
Laborers in the Propagation of the <HI>Divine Law.</HI></P>
<P>And as the Precepts of the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> seem to differ as much from the
Religion of the <HI>Chineses</HI> as the Heaven doth from the Earth, so it cannot be ex∣press'd
how many Toils and Labors must be undergone, and how many Dan∣gers
pass'd through, that they may be rendred capable of receiving our most
holy Law, and the truth of the same genuinely explain'd: Here the Vanities
of <HI>Polytheism,</HI> or of having many Deities, must be confuted; here <HI>Polygamie,</HI> or
Marrying of many Wives, must be destroy'd by strength of Argument; here
the incomprehensible Mysteries of our Belief must be inculcated with great
dexterity and caution, wherein laboring with more than ordinary patience
and continual subjection of the Body, how many Calumnies must they be
subject unto! But for this peruse the History of Father <HI>Daniel Bartolus,</HI> lately
publish'd in the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>And because the Preaching of the <HI>Gospel</HI> could not take root without the
publication of Books, I might treat opportunely in this Place concerning
those publish'd on this Occasion. As first the Works of the Venerable Father
<HI>Matthew Riccius</HI> of <HI>Macera,</HI> the Founder of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Expedition after St. <HI>Fran∣cis
Xavier.</HI> Secondly, Father <HI>Nicholas Trigautius</HI> a <HI>Flandrian</HI> of <HI>Doway.</HI> Thirdly,
Father <HI>Iacob Rho</HI> of <HI>Milan;</HI> all which writ many large and Learned Volumes.
And besides these, there were many who publish'd large Treatises to satisfie
the Curiosity of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> as the two-fold Universal History of Father <HI>Ni∣cholas
Trigautius,</HI> Father <HI>Iohn Terentius</HI> his <HI>Indian Pliny,</HI> and many more particu∣larly
mention'd by our Author, from <HI>Fol. 117.</HI> to 121. in which are the Par∣ticulars
at large.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Idolatry of the Chineses.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Books of the <HI>Chineses</HI> mention only three Sects of
Religion in <HI>China;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The three Sects of the <HI>Chineses.</HI></NOTE> First, that of the <HI>Learned;</HI> next,
that call'd <HI>Sciequia;</HI> and the third they term <HI>Lancu.</HI>
One of these three all the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and other conter∣minate
Nations which use the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Characters,
do profess; such are those of <HI>Iapan, Corian, Tonchini,</HI>
and <HI>Cocincina.</HI></P>
<P>These three Sects do very much resemble the <HI>Egy∣ptian</HI>
Priests or Wise-men, their <HI>Hierogrammatists,</HI> or those that were vers'd in
the Sacred Writings, and the <HI>Plebeians.</HI></P>
<P>The Sect of the <HI>Learned</HI> Rule the Commonwealth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Sect.</NOTE> abound in Books, and
are applauded above the rest. They acknowledge <HI>Confutius</HI> as the Author and
Chief of the Philosophers, as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> do their <HI>Thoyt,</HI> whom the <HI>Grecians</HI>
call <HI>Hermes Trismegistus;</HI> and as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> do their Sages worshipp'd one
God, whom they termed <HI>Hemphet,</HI> so the <HI>Learned Men</HI> of <HI>China,</HI> according to
the Dictates of <HI>Confutius,</HI> worship not Idols, but one Deity, whom they term
<HI>The King of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning this Sect <HI>Trigautius</HI> in his <HI>Christian Expedition into China</HI> says,
<Q>They assert that the Function or Office of Sacrificing to, and Worshipping
<FIGURE>
<PB N="394" REF="217"/>
</FIGURE>
of the King of Heaven doth only belong to the Prince; and therefore the
Emperor hath two most stately and magnificent Temples in his Palaces of
<HI>Nanquin</HI> and <HI>Pequin,</HI> the one Dedicated to Heaven, the other to the Earth:
He himself formerly Sacrific'd in them, but now the most grave Magi∣strates
supply his Place; they slay and Offer up Bulls and Sheep in Heca∣tombs
to the Heaven and the Earth (as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> did to <HI>Osiris</HI> and <HI>Isis)</HI>
and perform many other Rites. The peculiar Temple of the <HI>Learned</HI> is
that of <HI>Confutius,</HI> which is erected by Law in every City, in a Place above
their Schools. This stately Edifice adjoyns to the Magistrates Palace, who
is President over those that have taken the first Degree in that Learning.
In the most obvious place of the Temple is the Statue of <HI>Confutius,</HI> full of
Characters; or in stead of a Statue, his Name inscrib'd in Golden Letters
on an elegant Table: on each side of which stand the Statues of some of
his Disciples, whom the <HI>Chineses</HI> have Canoniz'd amongst the Deities of the
inferior Order. All the City Magistrates meet every New and Full-Moon in
this Temple, with those that have taken the Degree of Batchelors, to ho∣nor
their Master with accustom'd Crouching, even to Prostration, the Tem∣ple
being all the while illuminated with lighted Torches, and burning of
Incense.</Q></P>
<P>Much after the same manner, the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> on the first Day of the Month
<HI>Thoth,</HI> perform'd their Solemnities unto <HI>Mercury.</HI></P>
<P>There are also various Statues of this God, some of them very great, others
small, and easily carried about; one was communicated unto me by the Re∣verend
Father, Assistant of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Society of <HI>Iesus, Nunnius Mascaremias,</HI>
the which Engrav'd I thought good to adjoyn.</P>
<P>The second Sect of the <HI>Chineses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Sect.</NOTE> which answereth to the Philosophers
amongst the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> is call'd <HI>Sciequia,</HI> or <HI>Oympto,</HI> but vulgarly <HI>Amida;</HI> the <HI>Ia∣poneses</HI>
term it <HI>Xaca</HI> and <HI>Amidabu.</HI> This Law came to the <HI>Chineses</HI> from the West,
brought from a Kingdom call'd <HI>Threncio</HI> or <HI>Sciuro,</HI> which Regions, as <HI>Trigautius</HI>
affirmeth, are concluded under the only Name of <HI>Indostan,</HI> situate between the
River <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges.</HI></P>
<P>This Sect will easily appear by their Opinions to have proceeded from the
<HI>Gymnosophists, Brachmans, Persians,</HI> and <HI>Bactrians,</HI> who anciently inhabited this
<PB N="395" REF="217"/>
<HI>Indostan,</HI> and have Planted their Colonies in <HI>China;</HI> for they hold a multitude
of Worlds, a Metempsychosis or Transmigration of Souls into Brutes, profes∣sing
all the Philosophy of <HI>Pythagoras.</HI> Father <HI>Martinius</HI> in his <HI>Atlas</HI> thus rela∣teth
concerning them:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Xekiao</HI> (saith he) is a Sect which our Fathers hold to have been introduc'd
into <HI>China</HI> first after <HI>Christ:</HI> It admitteth a Transmigration of Souls after
Death, as a Punishment for Sins committed, and that both external and
internal: They worship Idols, and perpetually abstain from whatsoever had
Life, a Law judg'd necessary by them, for a withdrawing of the rude Multi∣tude
from Vice, and as an incitement to Vertue. The internal Metempsy∣chosis
is that part of Moral Philosophy most famous and excellent, as ha∣ving
reference unto the Vacuity and universal Victory of the Passions and
deprav'd Affections; that this may take place, they hold, that they pass
into Plants and Animals, as they were obnoxious and inclinable unto their
Affections. In their sceptical way they will have nothing to have the stamp
of Truth in this Life, but as we apprehend it, and that Good and Bad are
the same in respect of divers.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Taigautius</HI> subscribeth unto this: <Q>This Opinion (saith he) fram'd with
<HI>Democritus</HI> and others, many Worlds, but they seem chiefly to have borrow'd
the Transmigration of Souls from the Doctrine of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and they have
added many other Fictions unto it, to colour over the Falsity: Now they
appear not only to have receiv'd these Tenents from our Philosophers, but
also to have borrow'd a certain Shadow from the Evangelical Light; for
they introduce a certain mode of a Trinity, in which they feign three
Gods at length to co-unite into one Deity.</Q></P>
<P>Of this also the <HI>Spanish</HI> Epistles make mention in these words: <Q>They had
notice of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> because in the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> amongst other Idols,
there is the Figure of a Man which hath three Heads, and they look one to∣wards
the other; and the <HI>Chineses</HI> say, That it signifies that all three of them
have but one Will and Desire.</Q> And a little after he saith, <Q>There is ano∣ther
Image of the Figure of a Woman, with a Child in her Arms.</Q></P>
<P>Father <HI>Martin Martinius</HI> reporteth, That he hath seen in many Images, the
Prints, or Footsteps of the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> in the Province of <HI>Fokien.</HI> And he al∣so
asserteth, That he beheld ancient Crosses, and the Image of the Blessed
Virgin embracing her Son, which are now to be seen in our Church. Now
we may piously suppose these to be the Relicks of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle, or of
some later Propagators of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> and it is more probable that Idols had
their original from the <HI>Persians, Medes,</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Philosophers, Heirs of
the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> amongst whom it was a peculiar Property to make many Statues
to signifie the Effects of one thing. They continually shave their Heads, that
give themselves up unto Contemplation on Mountains, and in Caves. Their
Temples are so full of Idols, made of Brass, Marble, Wood, and Clay, that
you would take them of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Chappels.</P>
<P>The third Opinion of the Prophane Religion call'd <HI>Lanzu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Sect.</NOTE> answereth to
the <HI>Plebeians</HI> and <HI>Egyptian</HI> Magicians, and had its original from a certain Philo∣sopher
who flourish'd at the same time with <HI>Confutius;</HI> they feign, that his
Mother bare him eighty years in her Womb, wherefore he was call'd <HI>Lanzu,</HI>
that is, <HI>The Old Philosopher.</HI> This Opinion promiseth Paradise unto those that
are made up of Soul and Body; and they hang up in their Temple the Effi∣gies
of certain Persons, whom they fable to have soar'd up unto the Heavens:
<PB N="396" REF="218"/>
they prescribe Methods of Exercises to attain the same, which consist in v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rious
Rites, and certain Prayers also in Potions, by which, and with the fa∣vor
of the Gods, they promise a long Life.</P>
<P>It is the peculiar Office of the Priests of this Sect, by impious Prayers to
Exorcise Devils out of Houses; which they attempt by affixing on the Walls
the horrid shapes of Daemons, delineated with Black on yellow Paper; then
they fill the Houses with such strange Cries, that themselves seem to be Furies:
They also promise to fetch down Showers in a Drought, to stop great Rains,
and to avert Private or Publick Misfortunes.</P>
<P>And these are the three chief Heads of the Opinions of these Idolaters; but
the subtlety of these Masters have wrought them into so many Meanders,
that they seem scarcely to be numbred, and the incredible number of Images
sufficiently shew the same, which they do not only expose often to be ador'd
in their Temples, but also in each private Dwelling a Place is deputed for
them; and in the Market, the Streets, their Ships, and Palaces, they are first
obvious to the sight, wherein they imitate the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who were infamous
for all sorts of Idols.</P>
<P>But to clear this: First, as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Grecians</HI> believ'd certain Deities
to preside over the Universe, so unto these do the <HI>Chineses</HI> build mystical Tem∣ples;
these they, after the manner of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> pacifie and attract with
various Rites and Ceremonies.</P>
<P>The second Argument, that the Religion of the <HI>Chineses</HI> was borrow'd or
deriv'd from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> is so manifest, that no Person can in the least doubt
or question the same; and it is this, That unto this very Day there are found
Temples Dedicated unto <HI>Mars, Venus, Fortune, Peace,</HI> the <HI>Oreades</HI> or <HI>Nymphs</HI> of
the Mountains, and other Gods, common both to the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Egyptians,</HI>
as the <HI>Ichnography</HI> of the Metropolitan City of <HI>Nanking</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> no less elegantly
than exactly Imprinted on <HI>Chinesian</HI> Silk by our Fathers, and sent from <HI>China</HI> to
<HI>Rome</HI> some years since, will sufficiently prove, which I have here adjoin'd, as
I Copied it with great fidelity, to demonstrate the great Affinity that there
was between the <HI>Chinesian, Grecian,</HI> and <HI>Egyptian</HI> Religions.</P>

These are so agreeable to the <HI>Grecian</HI> and Egyptian Deities, that all their
Idolatry seemeth to have made a Voyage thence into <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The third Argument is, That besides their Letters, in which they come
very near the <HI>Hieroglyphicks</HI> of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> as I have shew'd in the second Part
of my <HI>Oedipus,</HI> they have the same Ceremonies. 'Tis receiv'd for Truth on all
hands, That the <HI>Egyptians</HI> always ador'd the Figures of the <HI>Pyramids</HI> with a
certain Divine Honor, the Tracts of which sort of Worship continue in <HI>China;</HI>
for they have also <HI>Pyramids,</HI> which they call <HI>Chinees,</HI> and hold them in so great
Veneration, that no Person dares undertake any thing, till such time as he hath
perform'd his Devotion there: I shall alledge <HI>Petrus Iarricus</HI> as a Witness of
this Matter, who in the fifth Book of his <HI>Indian</HI> History, publish'd in <HI>French,
Chap. 51.</HI> speaking of them, hath these words following:</P>
<P><Q>Besides these Wooden Idols there are others which they call <HI>Chinees,</HI> made
for Workmanship in the fashion of Pyramids; within which there is a cer∣tain
kind of white Ants or Emmets, which discover not themselves with∣out,
but have their little Cabbins or Lodges within, so that none know from
whence they receive their nourishment. The <HI>Idolaters</HI> stand much in fear of
these <HI>Chinees,</HI> insomuch that when they buy a Slave, they first bring him
before some one of these Pyramids, with a Wine-Offering, or other things
which they Present unto it, supplicating the Idol, that if he should run
away, he would cause the Serpents, Lizards, and Tygers, to kill and devour
him; whereupon the poor Slaves are so fearful, that although they are ill
us'd by their Masters, yet do they never presume to forsake them.</Q></P>
<P>From which it is apparent, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> borrow'd all these Fopperies
from the <HI>Egyptians, Persians,</HI> and others, who (as I have shewn in my <HI>Oedipus)</HI>
worshipp'd a Stone or Rock terminated in a Cone, or a Pyramid in stead of a
Deity; but for the <HI>Novizonian</HI> Pyramids, hear Father <HI>Martinius,</HI> who in his
<HI>Atlas, fol. 57.</HI> thus describeth them:</P>
<P><Q>In the Province of <HI>Foquien</HI> (saith he) are many beautiful Fabricks, and
not a few Temples: But the Tower without the Walls excelleth all the rest
in splendor and magnitude of Work: The Figure is eight-square, rising
from the Ground nine Stories in heighth, and therefore is call'd <HI>Novizonia;</HI>
its Perpendicular from the Vertex to the Foundation is ninety Cubits, un∣to
which the Breadth answereth in a due proportion: The exterior Wall
is adorn'd with Carv'd and Painted Figures made of the finest Clay, of
which they make their <HI>Porcellane:</HI> The inward Wall is vested with parti∣colour'd
Marble, which is so polish'd, that like a bright Mirror it reflecteth
the Face of the Beholder: You ascend by Stairs, not built in the Tower, but
within the double Walls; from which there is a Passage unto each Story,
and thence to most beautiful Footpaces cut in Marble, and Gilded Iron
Grates, by which the Galleries are every where fortifi'd and adorn'd: With∣out
the Tower, about all the Galleries, and especially at the top, small Bells
and tinkling Instruments are so hung, that being mov'd by the Wind, they
make a most pleasant Musical Consort: The last Round containeth the
Idol unto which the Tower is Dedicated, which is Cast in Copper, and
Gilded over. About the Tower are several other Temples of Idols, which
may easily compare with the ancient Fabricks of the <HI>Romans.</HI> And this is one
of those Towers which (as I formerly mention'd, was superstitiously erected
by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> they supposing that their Fortune and Felicity doth depend
upon it. I have briefly describ'd it, because I my self ascended it, and dili∣gently
<PB N="398" REF="219"/>
view'd every Corner of it; and though there be many which are more
beautiful than it, yet from the Description of this you may judge of the rest,
seeing they are for the most part alike, and built in the same order of Archi∣tecture.</Q></P>
<P>Moreover, as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> believ'd their Daemons to be confin'd within
Statues, and Consecrated certain Temples unto them, so in like manner do
the <HI>Chineses;</HI> concerning which hear <HI>Iarricus</HI> before cited, in the place above
quoted, thus discoursing:</P>
<P><Q>There is likewise in the Empire of <HI>China</HI> a Place Dedicated to the Devil,
where they go to make their most solemn Sacrifices unto him, in a little Isle;
they call the Idol <HI>Camassono,</HI> and those that pass by much dreading this Idol,
and fearing lest their Vessels should be cast away, when they are over against
the Isle, make an Offering, casting into the Sea either Oyl, or such other
Merchandise as they have Aboard.</Q></P>
<P>Concerning their Oracles, thus writeth <HI>Trigautius,</HI> in the first Book, Chap. 8.
of the Voyage into <HI>China:</HI> <Q>Some of the <HI>Chineses</HI> (saith he) consult the
Devils, and there are many familiar Spirits, which they commonly sup∣pose
to have more of their good Daemon, than any Fraud or Malice of an
Evil Spirit; they discover things, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lare present, and foretel future Events:
these we read to have been common to all the <HI>Heathen.</HI> But there is one spe∣cial
Science, peculiar only to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which is the erecting of a Terre∣strial
Scheme, that is, by the Configuration and Position of the Mountains
as we may term it, in present Prospect, as if they were moving Planets,
aspecting variously several fix'd Constellations, all Landskips so altering by
the least change of Place, either in Longitude or Latitude, they Calculate,
and so chuse a piece of Ground to build on, either Publick or Private Edi∣fices,
in which those that reside or are most concern'd, may live happily, and
be successful in the future, and also to Interr the Deceased, supposing such
Situation very much additional to their Eternal Bliss and Happiness after
Death; which choice Plot they so settle in posture with the Dragons they
dream of under Ground, affirming this Place to be just over the Dragons
Head, that his Tail, and there his Feet; for from these subterraneous Spi∣rits
they more than superstitiously believe all Humane Affairs, Private or
Publick, even to the Translation of Kingdoms and Empires receive their
Laws; and therefore many grave Persons are employ'd in this most
mysterious occult Science, who are especially concern'd when any Publick
Buildings, Machins, or Operas are to be erected; to which kind of Predi∣ction
not only the Great Ones, but the whole Nation are inclin'd, every
Corner of the Streets and Houses of Entertainment swarming with these
blind Prognosticators.</Q> Thus far <HI>Trigautius.</HI></P>
<P>And who beholdeth not here another Face of <HI>Egypt,</HI> in which all Affairs
were carried on by Auguries and Omens. He that desireth to know more of
this may have recourse to the Authors cited.</P>
<P>These things being propos'd, I shall add in this place a Scheme of the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI>
mad Idolatry, by which the Learned amongst them are bewitch'd; and
that they may appear to be somewhat wiser than the Vulgar, they divide their
false Deities into three Orders, the Supernal, Terrestrial, and Infernal. They
place in the Supernal the Properties of the Divine Essence, whom to worship
under the Name of the One God, term'd <HI>Pussa;</HI> but for this see our <HI>Syntagma,</HI>
or Treatise concerning the <HI>Cabala</HI> of the <HI>Hebrews:</HI> And for better Illustration,

I shall here annex the Effigies of the <HI>Chinesian Pussa,</HI> drawn from the Original,
which Father <HI>Gruberus</HI> not long since brought out of <HI>China</HI> to be perserv'd in
our Study.</P>
<P>The three Deities worshipp'd under the Name of one <HI>Pussa,</HI> are seated in a
more elevated place, together with two Attendants, which the Chorus or
Quite of the Deasters beneath, with stretched out and lifted up Hands seem to
uphold; in the middle is the Deaster term'd <HI>Fe</HI> or <HI>Fo,</HI> which signifieth <HI>A Sa∣viour,</HI>
like another <HI>Iupiter,</HI> resplendent with an august Face and wonderful Ma∣jesty,
encompass'd with many Gods and Goddesses (whom they call the He∣roes
of the ancient Times begotten by the Gods) under which are again plac'd
a Troop of the Semi-Gods, Gods of Nature and Kingdoms, which are usu∣ally
exhibited as so many <HI>Internuncii,</HI> who with great Veneration and signal
readiness attend to execute the Commands of the Great <HI>Fo</HI> or <HI>Chinesian Iupiter.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the wonderful Situation of China, and the manner of the Peoples Living there.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Empire of the <HI>Chineses</HI> is the most Opulent, Potent, and Populous,
containing fifteen Kingdoms, so the Government is the most abso∣lutely
Monarchical of all other Nations, being furnish'd both with
the Arts and Rarities of Nature, Policy, and good Order; so that being inde∣pendent
<PB N="402" REF="222"/>
and totally separated from the rest of the World, it seems a Microcosm
or little Universe within it self, Nature having on the North and West, besides
a Wall of three hundred <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, hedg'd it about with the vast and un∣bounded
Defence of a Sandy Sea; on the East and South she has so fortifi'd it,
both with the unlimited, and as yet unknown Recesses of the East and South
Ocean, and also with wild Roads and unsafe Harbors for Shipping, that with∣out
manifest danger you can hardly approach her Shores, both by reason of
the boisterousness of the Winds, and the most violent reciprocations of the
Marine Tides: And lest on the West some Entrance should be granted, Na∣ture
hath block'd up her Paths with rugged, inaccessible, and yet unpenetrated
Mountains, and so Arm'd with Garrisons of wild Beasts and venomous Ser∣pents,
ambuscaded in their obscure Recesses, that on this side no one can hope
for Passage; wherefore <HI>China</HI> is often call'd in their Language <HI>Cunghoa,</HI> signify∣ing
<HI>The Middle Empire,</HI> believing themselves to be situate in the midst and Na∣vel
of the World; and sometimes <HI>Cungque, A Garden in the midst,</HI> or <HI>A Florid
Garden,</HI> by reason of the affluence of all things necessary for Humane Life: for
the whole Empire is so much enrich'd from the defusion of Lakes and Rivers,
breaking out every where from the Mountains of the West, and from the Me∣diterranean
Parts of the continu'd Mountains, that there is scarcely a Field
that is not water'd with, almost no City but may hold a Correspondency with
others by Shipping, that Sail through Rivers and Trenches, to the great con∣venience
of Merchants and Travellers: the most perspicuous Rivers are, <HI>Ki∣ang,</HI>
for its largeness term'd <HI>The Son of the Sea,</HI> and <HI>Hoang,</HI> so call'd from his
Saffron Colour: These water all <HI>China,</HI> and rising from the bordering <HI>Indian</HI>
Mountains, by a divided Dominion separate the whole Empire, and at length
disembogue themselves into the Eastern Ocean. And this is also most worthy
of admiration in the <HI>Chinesian</HI> World, and which hapneth unto no other Mo∣narchy,
that at this day the Empire is so situate from the South towards the
North, that not content with the proper Munificences of the Temperate
Zone, it hath moreover subjected both the Torrid and Frigid unto its Iuris∣diction;
beginning from the 18. Degree of the Torrid Zone, and proceeding
in a straight Line through the Temperate, it is extended almost unto the 70.
Degree of the Altitude of the Frozen <HI>Tartarian</HI> Ocean within the Frigid Zone,
in all 32 Degrees, which if divided into 15. make 780 Astronomical Miles, of
which 15 make one Degree; and 3120 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, 60. of which Miles make
one Degree.</P>
<P>From whence it followeth, that all sorts of Fruits, Aromaticks, Trees, and
Animals, are so common unto this Empire, as they are each of them proper to
their peculiar Climate, and therefore what is scatter'd in sundry Parts, is here
collected with abundant Increase. What Monarch ever had the happiness every
Day to have his Table furnish'd with the seasonable and proper Fruits of the
<HI>Indies</HI> brought from the Burning Zone, and to be delighted with the variety
and abundance of all Fruits peculiar to the Temperate Zone, and whatever
else serves for Food, Raiment, or Pleasure? For what this vast Empire hath,
either rare, delicate, or admirable, is all serv'd up for the Emperor's use.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Political Government of the Chineses.</HEAD>
<P>SEeing in the former Chapters we have treated at large of the Political
Empire of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> here I thought good to adjoin some things wor∣thy
of greater consideration: The Emperor of <HI>China</HI> is absolute Lord of
the whole Monarchy, and the Empire is so Govern'd by him, that no Person
may undertake any Business of importance without his Assent. The Monar∣chy
descendeth successively from the Father to the Sons, and where the Direct
Line fails, it runs Collateral; all the rest, whether they be Brethren or Ne∣phews,
or otherways join'd in Consanguinity, are honor'd with the Title of
Kings, each of them having a Province assign'd him, which they Rule, but
yet with such a limitation of Authority, that having certain Revenues assign'd
them, all the rest is transferr'd into the Emperor's Treasury. There are six
Tribunals or Courts of Iustice which determine all Causes and Controversies
of the whole Empire: The first for chusing of Magistrates: The second, the
Exchequer of his Imperial Majesties Revenues: The third, for Emergencies
in Ecclesiastical Affairs: The fourth, for the Militia: The fifth orders Pub∣lick
Edifices, and such like Buildings: The sixth spreads it self into several
Courts, concerning Criminal Causes. And by these six, with their subordinate
Officers, all Business is dispatch'd. The Emperor hath Lords of his Privy-Council,
which they call <HI>Colaos,</HI> who as they are Persons excellently vers'd in
the knowledge of State Affairs, so also they are had in estimation next to him∣self;
he hath likewise his Governors, or Lords Lieutenants, of divers Degrees,
which are term'd <HI>Mandorins,</HI> and accomplish'd in variety of Learning and
Knowledge; so that the whole Kingdom is in a manner Rul'd (as <HI>Plato</HI>'s Com∣monwealth)
only by Learned Men; and that Kingdom cannot but arrive to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greatest heighth of Felicity, in which either the Prince acts like a Philoso∣pher,
or a Philosopher Reigneth. This is manifest by the innumerable multi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>des
of the Inhabitants, which the Emperor Governeth with as much facility,
as the Master of a Family doth his House; it is also clear from the Magnitude,
Splendor, and incredible Magnificence of the Cities, and the frequency of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ridges, the Structure of which, whether you have respect to their Length, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rules of Architecture, hath amaz'd such as beheld them: Add unto this the
convenience of Publick Passages, the afflux of Shipping from all Parts resort∣ing
to the Metropolitan Cities, the indefatigable Labor and Industry of the
Husbandmen in Cultivating their Lands, the great Vigilancy and unwearied
Guard of the Soldiery, the extraordinary Rigor and Severity of the Iudges in
punishing Malefactors; all which cannot have their original in so great an
Empire, without the supposition of excellent Laws establish'd for the confir∣mation
of the Peace and Tranquility thereof.</P>
<P>As for the Emperor's annual Revenues, although they are not always fix'd
and certain, by reason of the vicissitude and alteration of Times, yet for the
most part in Peace they easily amount to 150000000 <HI>Tayes,</HI> according to
their Exchequer Rolls, in which, as Father <HI>Martinius</HI> avoucheth, they have not
only the number of the Inhabitants in every Province and City, but also a
Compute of each Years Revenue most exactly Registred. In the Regency of
<PB N="404" REF="224"/>
the Emperor <HI>Vanly,</HI> the number of the Inhabitants throughout the whole Em∣pire
amounted to about two hundred Millions, not accounting the Emperor's
Servants, Eunuchs, Women, and Children, and the Revenue was estimated at
1500000. of Gold after our Rate; but now, under the Regency of this Empe∣ror,
the Revenues of his Kingdoms being also in the Audit, it far exceeds; and
for better satisfaction, I have here annex'd a Table of the annual Incomes of
each of the fifteen Provinces of the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> paid into the Exchequer;
together with the number of the Inhabitants contain'd in every one of them in
the time of the Emperor <HI>Vanly,</HI> which Table I have extracted out of <HI>Martinius</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Cities of China, and the Customs of the Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>FAther <HI>Martinius, Samedus, Trigautius,</HI> and <HI>Gruberus,</HI> Eye-witnesses, relate,
That the Empire of <HI>China</HI> is so full of Inhabitants, the Towns and Vil∣lages
so contiguous, that did the Wall reach the South Sea, it might de∣servedly
be term'd but one City; but there are Metropolitans and Chief Ci∣ties
of Provinces to the number of a hundred and fifty, and of those of the in∣ferior
rank, a thousand two hundred sixty two, all fortifi'd with Walls, Works,
and Trenches; besides, there are Castles, Corporation-Towns, Villages and
Granges without number. The Cities for the most part are built four-square:
Their Houses generally are Wood, and not above one Story, poor and rude
without, but within very splendid; each House is bound to affix a Shield up∣on
the Door, containing the number of Inhabitants, and of what Condition
each Person is, to the end the <HI>Mandorins</HI> may know how many Persons every
City contains, for the avoiding of Seditions, and to gather in the Revenues;
by which means it cannot be thought strange, that if Foreiners come into
<HI>China</HI> they are discover'd, their Landlords being oblig'd, under the infliction
of a severe Penalty, not to conceal them.</P>
<P>The Mechanick Arts are in great esteem amongst them, and they so ma∣nage
them, that they suffer not the vilest Dross to perish, but convert it to
some Gain. The Learned apply themselves unto no other Sciences, but Po∣litick
and Moral: They know not the Name of the Scholastick and Specula∣tive
Discipline, which is wonderful in a Nation that aboundeth with Ingeni∣ous
Persons; yet their Physicians by Tradition are endow'd with an ad∣mirable
knowledge of the Palsie, by which, with incredible Industry, they
find out the most Latent Causes of Diseases, and then apply for Cure their
proper Remedies. But in the Arts anvil'd out by modern Curiosity, as Archi∣tecture,
Sculpture, and Weaving, if you except the knowledge of Proportions
and the Opticks, they come not behind the <HI>Europeans.</HI> For their other Acquire∣ments,
see what I have said in the preceding Discourse; and he that desireth
more full Information, may have recourse to the above-cited Authors.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Mountains of China, and the stupendious Prodigies
of Nature which are observ'd in them.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough in this Empire Mountains are so numerous, yet the greatest
are the continual Theme and Argument of their Studies; for what
our Astrologers perform by the Celestial Houses, they make out by the
Terrestrial Hills. But amongst their many Enquiries by Terrene Calculations
after their good and bad Fortunes, there is nothing they more labor in, than
the Business of their Sepulture, about which they spare no Cost or Pains, not
only observing with no small scrutiny the Summits, Tops and Superficies,
but also making subtle Inspections into the very Bowels of the Mountains, to
<PB N="406" REF="225"/>
find a fortunate Spot of Ground, which they fancy to resemble the Head,
Tail, or Heart of the Dragon; which done, they joyfully conclude they have
found a Place in which the Person Interr'd shall be happy, and his Posterity
successful: which Opinion I believe to have been inculcated by some grave
Philosopher, to advance a filial Piety to the deceased Parents, and more special
care of the honor of Funerals.</P>
<P>Now the Mountains of <HI>China</HI> are for the most part encompass'd with great
Villages, pleasant for most beautiful Sepulchral Monuments, Chases, and
Groves, and a waving Sea of Rice makes them like a Plain, which when
Groves and Woods do smile with their Summer Attire, renders a most plea∣sant
Prospect, the Chappels plac'd on them excelling for Magnitude and
Splendor: there are also the Monasteries of the Priests; but yet in the thick
and overgrown Woods liveth a barbarous Nation not yet subjected to the
<HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>Many things are observ'd in these Mountains, which (if true) may be de∣servedly
accounted amongst the Miracles of Nature: Some by reason of their
immense heighth have a perpetual Serenity on their Tops; others are cover'd
with a continual dark Mantle of ambient thick Mists: there are some which
triumph only with wholsom Plants, exiling all venomous Weeds.</P>
<P>In the Mountain <HI>Queyu</HI> both small and great Stones are found, in a cubical
or four-square Figure, which are also in one of the Mountains of <HI>Calabria,</HI> of
which we have treated in our Book of the <HI>Subterranean World.</HI></P>
<P>The Mountain <HI>Paoki,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> hath the Figure of a Cock,
who on the approach of a Storm sendeth forth such Murmurs and Rorings,
as may be heard at a great distance; and <HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> in his History of the
Northern Reigons, saith, That such monstrous Sounds happen in the Moun∣tains
of the <HI>Botnick</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>That is also worthy of admiration which the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Oreoscopists relate
concerning the Mountain <HI>Cio,</HI> That on the top of it there is a Stone five Per∣ches
high; and another also in the Kingdom of <HI>Fokien,</HI> which as often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a
Storm is near, tottereth, and is moved hither and thither, as Cypress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
shaken by the Winds.</P>
<P>There is another Mountain continually cover'd with Frost, the cause of
which may be conjectur'd to be the Nitrous Spirits which the Mountain, to∣gether
with the Vapors of the Watry Receptacles therein laid up, perspireth.</P>
<P>There is a Mountain in the Province of <HI>Kiangsi</HI> which hath two Tops, the
uppermost of which resembles a Dragon, seeming to stoop fiercely at the
lower Spire, which appeareth like a Rampant Tyger; from whose various
Aspects the Priests make many Rules of Divination for their Disciples.</P>
<P>Another Mountain by its seven tops configureth the seven Stars in the
Constellation of the <HI>Greater Bear.</HI></P>
<P>But the Mountain fashion'd in the shape of an Idol, near the City of <HI>Tun∣chue</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> exceedeth all admiration; concerning which
thus writeth Father <HI>Martinius</HI> in his <HI>Atlas,</HI> Page 69. <HI>The first Mountain of this
Province</HI> (saith he) <HI>is worthy of admiration, being situate on the Banks of the River</HI> Feu;
<HI>for from this Mountain they have, as I may say, not form'd a monstrous, but a mounta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
Idol, which they call</HI> Fe; <HI>it sitteth with cross Legs, or decassated Feet, folding the Hands
in his Bosom: You may judge of the Magnitude, the Eyes, Ears, Nostrils, and Mouth being
perspicuous to the Beholders at least two Miles.</HI> This they suppose not to have been
cut out by the Labor of Art, (as <HI>Dinostratus</HI> offer'd to Carve the Mountain
<PB N="407" REF="225"/>
<HI>Athos</HI> into an <HI>Alexander,</HI> holding a City in one Hand, and a River in the other)
but the meer work of Nature much assisted by Fancy.</P>
<P>They report of the Mountain <HI>Taipe</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> much celebra∣ted
by the Oreoscopists or Mountain-Diviners, that a Drum being beaten on
it raiseth suddenly Thunder, Lightning, and great Tempests; therefore is
there a strict Law and severe Punishments provided, for whoever is found to
offend in this kind.</P>
<P>The Oreologists relate, that there is a Mountain in the Province <HI>Uquang,</HI>
which is so tenacious of its own Right, that if any one hath feloniously taken
any of its Wood, Fruit, or the like, he shall never be able to depart thence,
being perpetually included as in a Labyrinth, but he that religiously abstain∣eth,
may go thence without trouble. But we reckon this amongst the Fables
of the <HI>Bonzii.</HI></P>
<P>There also are <HI>Aeolian,</HI> or windy Mountains, such as in <HI>Europe;</HI> for in the
Province of <HI>Huquang</HI> is a Mountuin call'd <HI>Fang,</HI> from which (as <HI>Martinius</HI> re∣lates,
in the Spring and Autumn not the least Breath appears; but from the
hollow Caverns in Summer assiduous Blasts and continual Blowings issue.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of wonderful Lakes, Rivers, and Springs.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lakes of the <HI>Chineses</HI> are like their Mountains, full of Rarities.
There is a Lake in the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> which converteth Iron
into Copper; the Water being very green, we presume is full of
Nitrous Spirits, and so discolour'd with Coperas, which operates in the con∣version
of this Metal.</P>
<P>Another Lake call'd <HI>Chung</HI> in the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> hath a greater Won∣der;
for they report, that in a fair House there erected, as often as Rain or
Tempest is approaching, there is a sound heard like the ringing of a Bell.</P>
<P>In the Mountain <HI>Talaus,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> is said to be a Lake
which is most clear throughout the whole Year, except in the Autumnal Sea∣son,
in which it is tinctur'd so deep with a blue Colour, that it Dyes whate∣ver
is dipp'd in it.</P>
<P>There is near <HI>Sining,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> a Mountain call'd <HI>Tenlu,</HI>
full of Caverns, and dreadful to behold; in it, as Father <HI>Martinius</HI> witnesseth,
they report a standing Pool to be, into which if you cast a Stone from aloft,
you shall presently hear a roring and noise like Thunder, and immediately the
Skie being troubled, disembogues violent Showers.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Iunnan</HI> is the Lake call'd <HI>Chin,</HI> so much celebrated by
Geographers, and set forth in their Maps; concerning which their Histories
relate, That out of the Ruine of a great populous City, swallow'd by an
Earthquake, (after whose dreadful devoration the Scene suddenly chang'd in∣to
the Prospect of this pleasant Lake) none but a Child swimming on a piece
of Wood escap'd. This Lake is call'd also <HI>The Starry Sea,</HI> from certain Weeds
appearing on the surface like beamy Stars.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of strange or Forein Plants in China.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Empire of <HI>China</HI> by a continu'd Tract of Lands participateth of
the Properties of many things with <HI>India,</HI> the Seas being subject to the
<HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> so also it produces various Plants, endu'd with rare and
admirable Qualities; of some whereof take the following Account.</P>
<P>The first is of the Rose of <HI>China,</HI> which twice every day changeth its Co∣lour,
now being all Purple, and by and by becoming all White, yet without
any sweet Scent.</P>
<P>There is also the Plant call'd <HI>Cha,</HI> which not being able to contain it self
within the Bounds of <HI>China,</HI> hath insinuated it self into <HI>Europe:</HI> It aboundeth
in divers Regions of <HI>China,</HI> and there is great difference, but the best and more
choice is in the Province of <HI>Kiangnan,</HI> in the Territory of the City <HI>Hoeicheu.</HI>
The Leaf being boil'd and infus'd in Water, they drink very hot as often as
they please; it is of a Diuretick Faculty, much fortifies the Stomach, ex∣hilarates
the Spirits, and wonderfully openeth all the Nephritick Passages or
Reins; it freeth the Head by suppressing of fuliginous Vapors, so that it is a
most excellent Drink for studious and sedentary Persons, to quicken them in
their Operations; and albeit at the first it seemeth insipid and bitter, yet Cu∣stom
makes it pleasant: and though the <HI>Turkish Coffee</HI> is said to produce the
like effect, and the <HI>Mexican Chocolate</HI> be another excellent Drink, yet <HI>Tea,</HI> if the
best, very much excelleth them, because <HI>Chocolate</HI> in hot Seasons inflameth the
Blood more than ordinary, and <HI>Coffee</HI> agitateth Choler; but this Liquor in all
Seasons hath one and the same effect. Concerning this Plant, see more in <HI>Mar∣tinius</HI>
his <HI>Atlas Sinicus.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> groweth a Plant call'd <HI>Chisung,</HI> that is, <HI>Weather∣wise;</HI>
for the Mariners, as Father <HI>Martinius</HI> relateth, do by the number and di∣stance
of the Knots growing thereon, predict how many Tempests shall be
throughout the whole Year, and when they shall happen.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="226"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi</HI> there groweth a Tree which they call <HI>Quanlang,</HI>
which in stead of Pith hath a soft Pulp like unto Meal, whereof the Natives
make Bread, and apply to the same Uses with Flour; of which Trees <HI>Marcus
Paulus Venetus</HI> maketh mention, <HI>Lib. 3. Chap. 19.</HI></P>
<P>There is said to be a Lake near the City <HI>Vuting</HI> in the Province of <HI>Hunnam,</HI>
which is call'd <HI>Hociniao,</HI> on every side beautifully surrounded with Trees;
the Leaves that fall from them are chang'd into small Birds of a black Colour,
in such numbers, that the Inhabitants suppose them to be Spirits. So <HI>Marti∣nius</HI>
in his <HI>Atlas.</HI> The like to these are reported to be in <HI>Scotland</HI> and elswhere,
as <HI>Soland</HI> Geese, Clack-Geese, and Barnicles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Atlas</HI> of <HI>China</HI> mentions an Herb in the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> call'd <HI>Pu∣su,</HI>
which liveth a thousand years, and hath the vertue of restoring Youth, and
changing Gray Hairs into Black; the truth of which may well be doubted.</P>
<P>There is also found the Root call'd <HI>Ginseng</HI> in the Province of <HI>Leaotung,</HI> most
famous throughout all <HI>China;</HI> from the operation of whose wonderful Vertue
the vulgar <HI>Chineses</HI> believe strange Restoration of Health and Longevity. See
Father <HI>Martinius</HI> in his <HI>Atlas, Fol. 35.</HI></P>
<P>It is reported, that there groweth an Herb in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> call'd
<HI>Quei,</HI> which being eaten causeth Mirth and Laughter, somewhat like unto the
Weed <HI>Apiorisus.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Atlas</HI> reporteth an admirable kind of Withy or Vine to grow in the
Mountains of <HI>Quantung,</HI> call'd by the <HI>Chineses, Teng;</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese, The
Wheel;</HI> you would believe it to be a Rope wreath'd by Nature, of a very great
length, creeping along through the mountainous Earth; it is full of Prickles,
and with oblong Leaves, and often spreads for the space of a Furlong; there
is such plenty of it in the Mountains, that the long Branches being entangled
within one another, make the Way unpassable for the Deer; they make of it
Cables and Tackle for Ships, and being wrought in fine Threds, it serves to
make Bee-Hives, Cratches, Chairs, Pillows, Beds, and Mattresses; for no
Vermine will harbor in it: in the Summer it greatly refresheth Persons wea∣ried
with Heat.</P>
<P>There are also Trees in the Provinces of <HI>Iunnan</HI> and <HI>Chiangsi,</HI> whose Wood
<FIGURE>
<PB N="410" REF="227"/>
</FIGURE>
may deservedly be reckon'd amongst the precious Commodities; they call
that which is young and tender, <HI>Aqualin,</HI> and when it is grown to maturity, it
is call'd <HI>Calambi.</HI> The value of this Plant consisteth in the Odour, which is
sweetest when aged, and nothing can be more fragrant.</P>
<P>There is such plenty of the best sort of this <HI>Aqualin</HI> in the Mountains of
<HI>Couchinchina,</HI> call'd <HI>Moi,</HI> and in <HI>Iunnan</HI> and <HI>Chiangsi,</HI> Provinces conterminate on
<HI>Couchinchina,</HI> that it is free for all Persons to gather the same; and sometimes it
is transported to a hundred-fold Gain, especially amongst the <HI>Brachmans,</HI> who
make sacred Pyles of it on the great Days of Solemnity, in which Women
Consecrate themselves to the Flames, out of love to their deceased Husbands;
or when the Corps of great deserving Persons are burnt: for they sottishly
believe their false Gods are wonderfully delighted with such kind of Odours,
and are thereby rendred propitious unto the Souls of the Deceased, in their
Transmigration. But the <HI>Calambi</HI> is of a greater Price, and reserv'd for the
Emperor: It groweth upon the Mountains, and is fetcht thence by Night with
Torches, the better to evade the Incursions of wild Beasts there residing. In
<HI>Iapan</HI> the Noblemen make of it the <HI>Turpentine,</HI> although by the beneficiency of
the Sun and Climate, it is much improv'd.</P>
<P>In the Provinces of <HI>Suchuen</HI> and <HI>Xensi,</HI> and the City <HI>Socieu,</HI> near the <HI>Chi∣nesian</HI>
Wall, is found in great abundance that so famous and Physical Drug
<HI>Rhubarb.</HI></P>
<P>There are such variety of Fruit-Trees in <HI>China,</HI> that they answer to all the
Products of that nature in every Climate of the World, whether in the <HI>Torrid,
Temperate</HI> or <HI>Frozen Zones;</HI> but amongst them all she boasts of one Tree that
bears no Fruit, as we may say, and yet abounds with delicious Variety; it is
call'd by the <HI>Chineses</HI> for its thorny and prickly Leaves, <HI>Po-lo-mie;</HI> and in stead
of Buds and Blossoms it thrusts forth Excrescencies of a prodigious size, big∣ger
than our largest Pumpions, and not unlike, some of them as much as a Man
can carry; the Rind is tough and bristly, which opened, affordeth a Store∣house
of delicious Varieties, enough to satisfie twenty Persons, insomuch that
the <HI>Chineses</HI> call it <HI>A Sack full of Honey Fruit,</HI> the meanest of which for taste, as
some report, excels the choicest of our Mellons.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="227"/>
Like to this is the Tree which the <HI>Indians</HI> call <HI>Papaya,</HI> and the <HI>Chineses, Fanyay-Xu;</HI>
it beareth a Bunch of Fruit no bigger than our Mellon, of taste delicious;
the Iuice to be eaten with a Spoon: and throughout the whole Year it glo∣ries
in green Flowers and ripe Fruit.</P>
<P>There are in the aforesaide Regions, especially in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI>
near the City <HI>Sungiang,</HI> Pine-Trees of such a wonderful bigness, that eight
Men with their Arms extended cannot fathom the circumference of one of
them, within whose vast Rind forty Men may well stand; also Reeds of so
great bigness, that the Ioynts betwixt the Internodes or Knots will serve to
hold Liquor, in stead of a Kilderkin or Barrel.</P>
<P>They have likewise in <HI>China</HI> a Tree call'd <HI>Kagin,</HI> yielding Fruit twice a year,
which by inversion thrusts forth the Seed or Kernels, like Warts, or such Ex∣crescencies,
on the out-side of the Fruits, and is in common to the <HI>East</HI> and
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> who call it <HI>Ananas;</HI> but the <HI>Chineses</HI> call it <HI>Fam-Polo-Mie:</HI> it grow∣eth
in the Provinces of <HI>Quantung, Kiangsi,</HI> and <HI>Fokien,</HI> and is suppos'd to have
been first brought from <HI>Peru:</HI> The Tree on which it groweth is not a Shrub,
but an Herb, much like to our <HI>Carduus,</HI> but call'd by them <HI>Catriofoli;</HI> on whose
Leaf a Fruit groweth sticking unto its Stalk, of so pleasant and exquisite a taste,
that it may easily obtain the preeminence among the most noble Fruits of <HI>India</HI>
and <HI>China.</HI> The Spermatick Faculty is innate in all the Parts thereof; for not
only the Seeds shed on the Ground, but it's Sprouts and Leaves being Planted,
produce the like Fruits: Concerning which admirable Product of Nature, see
what I have discoursed at large concerning the Seeds of things, in the twelfth
Book of my <HI>Subterranean World.</HI> The Seeds of such Plants conduce much to
prove that new Philosophy of Plants, of which I have there laid the Platform.</P>
<P>The most noted Fruits, <HI>Manga, Lici,</HI> and <HI>Quei,</HI> are every where describ'd;
but how <HI>Manga</HI> is inoculated in the Pomecitron, is much different from the
Art of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> being perform'd without Transfoliation or Inoculation;
for they only bind a Bough of the Fruit <HI>Manga</HI> to a Bough of the Pomecitron,
and daub it about with Clay; which being done, they conjoyn, and so bring
forth the most excellent Fruit of both.</P>
<P>The Author of <HI>Atlas Sinicus</HI> makes mention of a Tree in the Province of
<HI>Chekiang,</HI> which produceth a Fruit that is fat, whereof they make most excel∣lent
white Candles, which neither foul the Hands, nor make any ill Scent
being extinguished; The Tree is like our Pear-tree; when the Fruit is ripe,
they break the Bark, macerate and steep it in hot Water, and when they have
water'd the heated Pulp, they make it up into a Lump, which looks like Suet;
and from its Nut they extract Oyl, like our Oyl of Olives, very useful in Win∣ter;
the Leaves are stain'd with a Copper-like redness, which dropping to the
Ground, afford Sheep and Kine good Food, by which they become very fat.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of strange Beasts or Animals in China.</HEAD>
<P>THere are in all the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> but especially in the Province of
<HI>Iunnan</HI> and <HI>Quangsi,</HI> great plenty of Elephants, Tygers, Bears, and other
wild Beasts, common to several Parts of the World; but I shall treat

<P><PB N="412" REF="228"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In the Western Provinces of <HI>China,</HI> viz. <HI>Xensi</HI> and <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> is the <HI>Odoriferous
Stag</HI> or <HI>Deer,</HI> (for so the <HI>Chineses</HI> call the <HI>Xechiam)</HI> being an Animal which pro∣duceth
Musk; Concerning which, thus the Author of <HI>Atlas Sinicus:</HI></P>
<P><Q>That there may be no doubt (saith he) what Musk is, I shall discover it,
having been more than once an ocular Spectator of what I now relate:
There is a certain Bunch or Excrescency about the Belly of the Animal
by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Xe,</HI> much like a Purse, consisting of a thin Skin, co∣ver'd
with Hair: the Odour or Fragrancy thereof is call'd <HI>Xehiang,</HI> which
signifieth <HI>Musk;</HI> it is a four-footed Beast, not much unlike a Deer, the Hair
of it somewhat more black, and altogether without Horns; the Flesh of it,
when kill'd, is eaten by the <HI>Chineses.</HI> In this Province, and in <HI>Suchuen</HI> and
<HI>Iunnan,</HI> and the Places more near the West, is found great plenty of Musk.
Those Bunches or Purses, if they be not adulterated, are of as strong a scent
as the pure <HI>Zybeth;</HI> but the crafty Merchants stuff the Purses which the Skin
of the Beast maketh, with the Blood, Skin, or some part else, and sell them
for the true and genuine: some mix it with Dragons Blood, and by this
means of one Bladder make two or three: but yet the more skilful do di∣scern
the Fallacy; for if being burn'd it evaporateth, it is believ'd to be true,
but if it remaineth like a Coal or Cinder, it is adulterate.</Q></P>
<P>Almost the same is deliver'd by Father <HI>Philip Marinus</HI> in his History of <HI>Tun∣chino,</HI>
in which Place there is plenty of these Animals, which he saith are so
simple, that not knowing how to escape, they will of their own accord pre∣sent
themselves unto the Huntsmen to be slaughter'd.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Hippopotame, or Sea-Horse, by the Chineses call'd Hayma.</HEAD>
<P>THese Animals are often seen on the Shores of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI>
Ocean, in <HI>Hainam,</HI> the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, the <HI>Maldivas,</HI> and especially
in <HI>Mozambique,</HI> on the Southern Coast of <HI>Africa.</HI> They are very deformed
Creatures, and terrible to behold. Father <HI>Boim,</HI> whilst he staid at <HI>Mozambique,</HI>
dissected and inspected one of them; of whom take the following Account in
his own words:</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="228"/>
<Q>I have (saith he) annexed a double Scheme of the true <HI>Sea-Horse,</HI> of which
when I was at <HI>Mozambique,</HI> I saw a great Company wallowing in the Sea in
a Creek on the Sands. The Iudge of the City <HI>Mozambique</HI> sent the Head of
an <HI>Hippopotame</HI> unto the Colledge, that I might peruse it; which measuring, I
found it in length three Cubits from the Mouth to the Shoulders; on the
lower Iaw it had two high bended Teeth, unto which in the upper Iaw the
great Teeth were consentaneous, and the Tongue lolling out. Afterwards
viewing the more Inland Parts of <HI>Crafraria,</HI> Coasting the Shore in a Gally,
we beheld at least fifty <HI>Sea-Horses</HI> within a Stones-cast, neighing, and
playing divers Tricks in the Water: a Slave with his Musquet kill'd one of
them; which bringing Ashore, and dividing it amongst his Companions,
they pull'd out his Teeth, and gave me some of the biggest of them. His
Skin is very hard; he hath no Hair but only in the end of his Tail, which
turns in; they cast a Brightness like polish'd black Horn, and are about
the bigness of a Quill or small Reed, of which the <HI>Cafres</HI> make Bracelets,
both for Ornament, and to prevent the Palsie: Of their Teeth are made
Beads, Crosses, and Images; some stop the Flux of Blood: but all have
not this Vertue, only those that are taken at a certain Season of the Year.
In the Royal Hospital at <HI>Goa</HI> there is a great <HI>Sea-Horse</HI> Tooth, which being
apply'd to a Vein that is open'd, will immediately stop the Blood. The
Story of a Prince of <HI>Malabar</HI> slain by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> is sufficiently known,
whom they finding wounded with many Bullets, yet without any sign of
Blood, though his Wounds were gaping, stripp'd, and pulling away a piece
of the Bone of the <HI>Hippopotame</HI> that hung about his Neck, the Blood, like
a Torrent that breaketh over the Banks, flow'd out of the dead Corps, be∣ing
before so stopp'd and coagulated only by the frigid Nature of this Crea∣ture.</Q> Thus Father <HI>Boim.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> hath an Animal perfectly resembling a Man, but
longer Arm'd, and Hairy all over, call'd <HI>Fese,</HI> most swift and greedy after
Humane Flesh; which that he may the better make his Prey, he feigneth a
Laughter, and suddenly while the Person stands listning, seiseth upon him.</P>
<P>There are also in <HI>China</HI> Apes and Baboons of a different kind, whereof
some imitate Men, others, Dogs and Cats, and are also tractable and docile
to admiration; of which take Father <HI>Roth</HI>'s Relation, he being an Eye-wit∣ness.</P>
<P><Q>The King of <HI>Bengala</HI> (saith he) in the Year 1650. dispatch'd unto the
Emperor of the <HI>Mogors</HI> a solemn Embassy, with many rich Presents, among
which was a Triumphal Chariot drawn by two white Horses, wonderfully
adorn'd with Gold and Gems: But that which was more worthy of admi∣ration,
the Charioteer was no humane Creature; for a great Baboon guided
the Reins with no small skill and dexterity, his Livery Cloke and Cap shi∣ning
with Scarlet and Gold; the Champion, a great Mastive, sitting on the
highest Seat, as in a Throne of Majesty, Deck'd and Adorn'd with Gold
and Iewels in so great Splendor, that he seem'd to be some great Prince
and not a Dog; his <HI>Valets-de-Chambre,</HI> Pages and Lacquies, richly Dress'd
according to their Place and Office, were all Apes and Monkies, offici∣ously
attending round about him, who so well had learnt his Lesson, that
when any Person of Quality drew near, he not only perform'd due Reve∣rence,
making low Congies, but his well instructed Followers did the like:
which the Emperor beholding with great pleasure and admiration, caus'd a

<P>AMongst these the <HI>Bird-Royal,</HI> which they call <HI>Fum Hoam,</HI> deserves the
first and chiefest place; of whom Father <HI>Boim</HI> in his <HI>Flora</HI> gives us this
following Account:</P>
<P><Q>This Bird (saith he) of most admirable beauty, if at any time absent, or
a while unseen, it is an Omen of some Misfortune to the Royal Family;
the Male is call'd <HI>Fum,</HI> the Female <HI>Hoam;</HI> they have their Nests in the
Mountains near <HI>Peking;</HI> their Heads are like a Peacocks: the <HI>Chineses</HI> em∣blem
their Shoulders to the Vertues, their Wings signifie Iustice, their Sides
Obedience, and the Nest Fidelity. This Pious Bird, as they term it, is in
this like a <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI> that it never turns, but goeth backward, with the Ma∣jestick
pace of a Stag; it hath a Cock's Train, Crested like a Serpent, Feet
like a Tortoise, and Angels Wings. The Emperor, <HI>Colaos,</HI> and <HI>Mandorins,</HI>
have these Birds Embroider'd on their Vests and other Habits.</Q></P>
<P>In the Kingdom of <HI>Suchue</HI> are Fleece-bearing Hens, they are small Duck∣leg'd,
yet bold and daring, and are much esteem'd by the Women for their
callow Down and soft Plumage, resembling Wooll, delightful to handle.</P>
<P>They also report, That in this Province there is a Bird produc'd of the
Flower <HI>Tunchon,</HI> which therefore is call'd <HI>Tunchonfung.</HI> This Bird doth measure
out Life with the Days of the Flower, so fading, and so expiring: She is
vested with so great variety of Plumes, that her Wings expanded, lively de∣portray
the Beauties of the Flower when blown.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Couchinchina</HI> and the Island <HI>Hainan,</HI> are many great and small
<PB N="415" REF="229"/>
Rocks, within which in the Spring-time a multitude of little Birds, like unto
Sparrows or Swallows, flock to build their Nests; from whence they come
is not known, they fix their Nests to the Rocks, where with singular artifice
they lay their Eggs, hatch their young ones, and flie away: Their Nests are

they are esteem'd as great Delicacies; they are in a manner diaphanous or
transparent: I have three of them in my Study; they are somewhat of a yel∣lowish
Colour, of an Aromatical Composition, and being mix'd with any
sort of Meat whatsoever, give it a grateful taste; the Matter whereof these
Nests are built, they produce out of their Stomachs, which fixing upon the
Rocks, they curiously form with a Liquor they find issuing from the Clefts:

<P>THere is in the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> the so much admir'd Animal, by
the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Hoangioyu,</HI> that is, <HI>The Saffron-Fish,</HI> which in the
Summer Season is wonderfully transform'd to a Bird of the same
Colour, and like other Fowls flying over the Mountains, seeketh its Nutri∣ment;
but when <HI>Autumn</HI> is ended, returning to the Sea, it is chang'd into a
Fish, which the Natives esteem as a great Delicacy for its most pleasant taste.</P>
<P>They report of a Fish in the same Province, which they call <HI>The Swimming
Cow,</HI> that it often cometh Ashore, and fighteth with the Land Cows; but con∣tinuing
long out of the Water, the Horn waxeth soft, and becoming of no
defence, the Fish is compell'd to return again to the Waters to recover the
hardness of the Horn.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Atlas</HI> saith, That there are a kind of Bats in the Province
of <HI>Xensi,</HI> which are as big as a Hen or Goose, and much sought after by the
<HI>Chineses</HI> as a singular Dish, their Flesh being much preferr'd before the most
delicate Meats that can be made of Hens. See what I have said before concern∣ing
Bats in the Empire of the <HI>Mogor.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> is found a Sea-Monster with four Eyes and six
Feet, which liveth by feeding on Oysters, and vomits up things like Pearls; it
resembleth the Creature call'd a Sea-Spider, and is not much unlike a Tor∣toise.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> in the Cleft of a Mountain, are Fish that have
four Feet and Horns, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>The Delight of the Dragon,</HI> and
esteem it an Offence worthy to be punish'd with Death to injure them. They
say also, That there is in this Tract of Land an Animal which resembleth a
Bird in the Head, and a Fish in the Tail, which they call <HI>Rondoves,</HI> that is
<HI>Swallows;</HI> I have one to shew in my Study, which will turn it self unto that
part from whence the Wind bloweth.</P>
<P>The same Author likewise reporteth▪ That in this Province are found
Crabs, which when they have left the Water and come into the Air, immedi∣ately
are turn'd into a hard Stone, yet retaining their form.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Serpents of China.</HEAD>
<P>THere are in this Empire Serpents of so prodigious a size, that (as <HI>Mar∣tinius</HI>
in his <HI>Atlas</HI> relateth) in the Province of <HI>Quangsi</HI> there are some
thirty Foot long, unto which if their Bulk answereth, one would be∣lieve
that greater cannot be.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flora Sinensis</HI> reporteth of the Serpent call'd <HI>Gento,</HI> <Q>That it devoureth
whole Stags, yet is not very venomous; it is of an Ash-colour, its length
from eighteen to twenty four Foot: Being hungry, it rusheth out of the
Thickets and seizeth its Prey: Erected upon his Tail, he maintains a Fight
with Men or wild Beasts; and oftentimes will seize upon a Man by leap∣ing
from a Tree, and kill him by its violent windings about him. The <HI>Chi∣neses</HI>
preserve his Gall to cure the Diseases of the Eyes.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> testifieth the same of the Serpents of <HI>Carrajam,</HI> which
are so great, that some are in length ten Paces, in thickness ten Palm; a Geo∣metrical
Pace consisting of five Foot, the length of this Serpent must be fifty
Foot, and so it exceeds the Serpents of <HI>Quangsi</HI> twenty Foot; but if the com∣mon
Pace, which is three Foot, then they are equal; But thus <HI>Marcus Paulus:</HI>
<Q>There are bred in the Province of <HI>Carrajam</HI> very great Serpents, some in
length ten Paces, and in thickness ten Palms, having in stead of Feet, Claws
like those of a Lion or Falcon; they have great Heads, and fiery Eyes, staring
as wide as Sawcers, and bunching forth like Footballs; their Mouth and
Iaws so wide, that are able to swallow a Man, with large and sharp Teeth,
being terrible to behold; they are taken after this manner: The Serpent in
the day-time lieth hid in Caves of the Mountains, and in the night-time go∣eth
forth to hunt the Dens of Beasts for Prey, which he devoureth, fearing
neither Lions, Bears, or any other Creature; and having satisfi'd his Hun∣ger,
returneth to his Cave, with the weight of his Body ploughing exceed∣ing
deep Furrows, the Earth being Sandy, in which Tract the Huntsmen fix
strong Stakes, pointed with sharp Iron, which they conceal with the Sand;
and when the Serpent cometh forth to seek his Prey, or returneth back,
as he creepeth along, the Sand giveth way, and the Iron Spikes pierce his
Breast, goring his Entrails; where being fastned, and sore wounded, the
Huntsmen kill him, and sell his Gall at a great Price, it being Medicinal;
the Flesh they sell for Meat, and Men feed freely on it.</Q> Thus far <HI>Marcus
Paulus Venetus.</HI> And though these may be reckon'd amongst Dragons, yet art
they without Poyson, of which there are divers others (as <HI>Martinius</HI> relateth)
in the Province of <HI>Chekiang.</HI></P>
<P>There are also other Serpents in <HI>China,</HI> full of incurable Poyson, call'd <HI>Cabra
de Cabelo,</HI> that is, <HI>The Hairy-Headed Serpent,</HI> of whose Stone we have made men∣tion.</P>
<P>In the Empire of the <HI>Mogor</HI> there is another sort, swoln with deadly Ve∣nom,
and exceedingly valu'd for the excellent Antidotes that are compounded
of them. Let this Serpent be steep'd in a large Vessel full of rich Wine, so that
his Head may come out at a Hole made in the middle of the Cover, then put
Fire under it till the Wine be ready to boil, and the Poyson of the Serpent
<PB N="417" REF="230"/>
breathe out, and is all dissolv'd into Smoke, the Head being cut off, the Flesh
is the most precious Antidote against all Poysons.</P>
<P>There are Tortoises discover'd in the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Ocean, as the <HI>Atlas</HI> testifieth,
that afar off appear like Rocks.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flora Sinensis</HI> says, That there are found Tortoises in the Kingdom of
<HI>Honan,</HI> some green, and some blue; there are also others, that to mend their
Face, have Wings added to their Feet.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the wondrous Stones and Minerals in China.</HEAD>
<P>THe Author of the <HI>Atlas Sinicus,</HI> and other Writers say, That Nature hath
here sported her self in Stones, and the Oeconomy of Minerals, as well
as Animals. In the Province <HI>Huquang,</HI> at the Mountain <HI>Xeyen,</HI> espe∣cially
after the fall of Rains, are found Stones which they call <HI>Swallows,</HI> because
they so exactly resemble that Bird, that they want nothing; the Physicians
distinguish them into Male and Female, and use them in their several Com∣pounds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinesian</HI> Genealogists report, That there is a Stone found in the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Xensi</HI> of an inestimable Price, for that it increaseth and decreaseth with
the Full and Wane of the Moon.</P>
<P>Many Writers of Natural Observations report, That the Stone call'd <HI>Se∣lenitis</HI>
hath the same effect amongst us: This is a kind of <HI>Talcus</HI> or Specular
Stone, which I have oftentimes observ'd, not only to shine at the Brightness
and Splendor of the Moon, but perfectly to shew, as in a Glass, the Figure
of the Moon, when at Full, when an half-Moon, and when in a Sextile Fi∣gure;
whence I suppose the Fable to have its original, That this Lunary Stone
sometimes increaseth, and sometimes decreaseth, according to the appearance
of the Moon.</P>
<P>They have an Earth call'd <HI>Quei,</HI> a Mineral very bright, and much esteem'd
by the Women, being endow'd with a Cosmetick Faculty, which infus'd in
Water with a gentle Fucus, mundifies the Skin, taking away all Morphew,
Freckles, Flushing, Pimples, and such Rubifying Ebullition; they call it <HI>Quei
X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that is, <HI>The Noble Lady.</HI></P>
<P>There is in the Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> a Stone taken out of a Cows Paunch,
of a Clay colour, about the bigness of a Gooses Egge, but inferior to a <HI>Bezoar</HI>
in solidity, being of a lighter Substance, and therefore thought by some to be
the more eminent in Vertue.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> at the Mountain <HI>Yangkiu,</HI> is seen a wonderful
Stone, which being form'd into an humane Shape, either by Nature of Art,
assumeth divers Colours, according to the various Temperature of the Air, as
some affirm, by which they prognosticate either fair or foul Weather.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinesian Atlas</HI> tells of an Herb call'd <HI>Asbestus,</HI> in <HI>Taniju,</HI> growing upon a
Stone, that defieth the Flames, not suffering in a fiery trial, but cometh forth
a Conqueror, no way impair'd by the fiercest ardor, though a fibrous small
Excrescency like Hairs; but being put into Water it moulders away like
Clay, and is suddenly consum'd. How this <HI>Asbestus</HI> is hatchel'd into Flax, and
woven into fine Linnen, whose Maculations, and all other Soil, is (as we
<FIGURE>
<PB N="418" REF="231"/>
</FIGURE>
may say, wash'd and rinsed by Fire, as other Linnen is by Water. See my
<HI>Mundus Subterraneus, Lib. 12.</HI></P>
<P>There is a City call'd <HI>Iaocheu,</HI> on the Northern Bank of the River <HI>Po,</HI> in the
Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> which alone hath the honor to make the best <HI>Porcelane</HI>
Ware, or <HI>China</HI> Dishes, so highly esteem'd in <HI>Europe</HI> and elsewhere; yet they
fetch their Materials from another City that hath that precious Vein of Earth
in great abundance, which yields them small Audits, not being able to make
the like use thereof. The Body of this Earth is rather of a sandy than cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie
Substance, tender and brittle, which they knead, with often sprinkling Water,
into a contiguous Paste, thence raising and modeling Vessels of what size or
Shape they please, which they bake with great care by gentle, yet continu'd
Heats, till they bring it to some perfection; and being broken, they new mould
them, bringing them almost to their first value.</P>
<P>As the Mountains of <HI>China</HI> are replenish'd with other Metals, so also there
are plenty of Gold and Silver Mines; but by the Emperor's Edicts they are
prohibited to dig them, because from the virulent Exhalations of that Earth,
the Workmen are expos'd to Diseases and Death. But they have Golden Ore,
which they extract from the Sand of Rivers and Springs. And besides, they
have those which promise to themselves and others, Mountains of Gold by
the Art of Chymistry; and there is a Place near <HI>Pukiang</HI> in the Province of
<HI>Sucheu,</HI> that boasts it self for the Birth-place of <HI>Hoangtius,</HI> the first Professor of
Alchymie, and Transmutation of Metals into Gold, two thousand five hun∣dred
years before the Birth of our Saviour. And that this Empire is rich in
Gold and other Metals, the plenty of hot Baths, the abundance of Nitre, Alu∣men,
Vitriol, Sulphur, and Subterranean Fires, do sufficiently evidence.</P>
<P>There is a Spring in the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> the upper part of whose Wa∣ter
is cold; but if you thrust your Hand in a little depth, you will find it to be
scalding hot.</P>
<P>But that which is most worthy of admiration is, That in the Province of
<HI>Xansi</HI> are Wells of Fire, and those as common as Springs of Water in other
Parts: the Inhabitants dress their Meat therewith, closing up the Mouth of
the Well, that it admitteth of nothing else but the Pot or Kettle; and the Heat
<PB N="419" REF="231"/>
so contracted, easily makes the Pot boil. Father <HI>Martinius</HI> in his <HI>Atlas</HI> saith,
<Q>That this Fire is thick, and not so bright as other Flame, and though very
hot, yet consumeth not Wood cast into it; being collected as in a Stove, it
may easily be carried about, and us'd to boil Meat, but at last it will expire.
They have also in this Province Mines of Coal, like to that us'd in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
being of great use to the Northern <HI>Chineses,</HI> especially for heating their
Furnaces; they are digg'd up in huge great Pieces, but they break them,
and mix'd with Water they make them up into Lumps, which with difficul∣ty
take fire, but when once kindled, burn fiercely, and continue long: The
Fnrnaces in their Stoves are like those in <HI>Germany,</HI> but sometimes they are
made like unto a Bed, and serve to lie upon in the Winter.</Q> Thus <HI>Martinius</HI>
in his <HI>Atlas.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Bridges and wonderful Fabricks of the Chineses.</HEAD>
<P>AND first the Bridge call'd <HI>Loyang</HI> in the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> built by a
Prefector Governor call'd <HI>Cayang,</HI> exceedeth all admiration, the Lon∣gitude
whereof extendeth about sixty Perches, and the Latitude six▪
Where this Bridge now stands there was formerly a Passage for Ships, but ve∣ry
dangerous, by reason of the extraordinary violence of the Current. The
building of this Bridge cost 4000000 Crowns; concerning which the Au∣thor
of the <HI>Atlas</HI> gives this Relation: <Q>I twice beheld (saith he) the famous
Bridge <HI>Loyang</HI> with amazement; it is all built of one sort of black hewn
Stone, having no Arches, but is erected upon three hundred Massie Stone-Piles,
all of the Figure of a Ship, on each side ending in an acute Angle, that,
they may the less suffer by the force and beating of the Waves; on the tops
of these Piles are laid Stones of an equal length, every one of which is twenty
two Paces in length, and two in breadth, as I measur'd them; and of these
Stones there are 1400 all alike: and to prevent falling off, there are Rails
with Lions cut in Stone on both sides, with many other Ornaments: A
most stupendious Work, and deservedly admir'd: But this is only the De∣scription
of part of this Bridge, which lieth between the Town <HI>Logan,</HI> and
a Castle built upon the Bridge; the other part being equal.</Q> That this
Bridge should be built with so little Cost, is no wonder, considering the
greatest part of the Laborers serve <HI>gratis</HI> in Publick Works, and those that re∣ceive
Wages have not the tenth part so much as our Laborers in <HI>Europe. Mar∣cus
Paulus Venetus</HI> maketh mention also of this Bridge when he describeth the
City of <HI>Xartes.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Bridge in the Province of <HI>Queicheu</HI> call'd <HI>Tiensem,</HI> that is, <HI>Built by
Heaven;</HI> it is a most excellent Work of Nature, consisting of one Stone, over
the Torrent <HI>Tanki,</HI> whose Latitude is two Perches, and the Longitude twenty.
This Place formerly was shut up within a Mountain; but by the force and
violence of the Floods, the Mountain being eaten away and hollow'd, this
Bridge was left.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xensi</HI> is a Way made with Bridges by the General of an
Army nam'd <HI>Chauleang,</HI> in the making whereof an Army of many hundred
thousand Men were employ'd, whole Mountains cut through at such a depth,
that the sides perpendicularly equal with the top of the Mountains, seem to
brave the Clouds, and yet every way admitteth the Light that elapseth from
above. In some Places he built Bridges with Beams and Spars laid from
Mountain to Mountain, and upheld by Beams plac'd under them; in places
where the Valleys are, wide Pillars are apply'd. The third part of the Voyage
consisteth of Bridges of so great heighth, that you scarcely dare look down;
the breadth of the Way is capable of receiving four Horsemen abreast, and to
prevent falling, they have plac'd Rails of Wood and Iron on both sides; it is
call'd <HI>Cientao,</HI> that is, <HI>The Bridge of Props and Rails,</HI> and was erected to shorten
the Way from the City of <HI>Hanchung</HI> unto the Metropolitan City of <HI>Siganfu,</HI>
which before was 20000 <HI>Stadia,</HI> through many Turnings and Windings; and
now by the Passage through these Mountains, their Voyage is but 80 <HI>Stadia.</HI></P>

There is another Bridge in this Province, near unto <HI>Chogan,</HI> on the Bank of
the River <HI>Fi,</HI> built on one Arch from Mountain to Mountain, whose length is
forty <HI>Chinesian</HI> Perches, that is four hundred Cubits; the Altitude or Perpen∣dicular
to the <HI>Saffron-River,</HI> which passeth under the Bridge, is reported to be
fifty Perches; the <HI>Chineses</HI> call it <HI>The Flying Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>I have seen the like Bridge built from Mountain to Mountain in <HI>France</HI> near
<HI>Nemanse,</HI> which hath three Stories; the first consisteth of four Arches, under
which Coaches pass, the other is rais'd upon twelve Arches, a Passage for
Horsemen; the third hath thirty six Arches, and serveth for an Aqueduct;
Report says 'twas built by the ancient <HI>Romans;</HI> it is vulgarly call'd <HI>Le Pont du
Garden,</HI> erected over a River of the same Name.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Iunnan,</HI> over a most deep Valley, through which a Tor∣rent
runneth with a rapid and violent flux of Waters, is a Bridge reported to
be built by the Emperor <HI>Mingus,</HI> of the Family of <HI>Hame,</HI> in the sixty fifth Year
of <HI>Christ,</HI> rais'd not with the cementing of Stones or Plaister-work, but with
Iron Chains fastned to Rings and Hooks, so placing the Bridge to Beams above;
there are twenty Chains, and every one consisteth of twenty Perches; many
passing over together, the Bridge removeth hither and thither, possessing the
Passengers with giddiness and fear of the ruine and fall of the Bridge.</P>
<P>I cannot sufficiently admire the dexterity of the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Architects, who
durst undertake so many difficult Works for the convenience of Passengers.</P>
<P>When once you descend from the Bridges upon the craggy Mountains into
the Campaign, you enter upon the publick Ways, which are so pleasant, being
Pav'd with foursquare Stone, that you would think you went still through a
City; and where the rough Mountains deny a Passage, there their Ingenuity
hath contriv'd a Way, though perform'd with great labor and difficulty; for
in some places they were compell'd to cut down Rocks, in others to level the
aspiring tops of Mountains, and fill up the low Valleys, an incredible num∣ber
of Hands having been employ'd to make an easie Passage throughout the
whole Region, which at length they have perform'd: And in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertain Distan∣ces,
at every Stone or Mile Boundary, which contain each ten <HI>Chinesian Stadia,</HI>
are appointed Posts, by whose Diligence, in a very short time, all the Procla∣mations
and Imperial Edicts are carried unto the Governors with much speed.
At each eighth Boundary, that is one Days Iourney, are erected Publick Hou∣ses,
which they call <HI>Cunquon</HI> and <HI>Yeli,</HI> unto which the Magistrates direct those
that Travel upon Publick Concerns, having first acquainted those to whose
Charge the keeping of these Houses is committed, with the Dignity of the
Person, and the Time when they will arrive, that so they may provide accor∣dingly
for their Entertainment and Reception.</P>
<P>The Banks of the Rivers are as commodious as the Imperial Ways, no Tree
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other Impediment being left within five Cubits distance of the Water, by
which the Towing of their Ships and Boats should be retarded. In many pla∣ces
they have made Wharfs of square Stone, and plac'd where necessity requi∣reth,
Stone Bridges of divers Arches; so that by the Magnificency of these
Works they at least equalize the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> if not excel them;
so great is the Zeal and Study of all Persons to advance the Publick Interest.</P>
<P>I shall here say nothing concerning the Magnificence, Splendor, and almost
infinite multitude of their Ships, which are found in every River throughout
the whole Empire, and in so great a number, that, as the Fathers write, any
one may well doubt whether more Persons live in their Ships, especially in
<PB N="424" REF="235"/>
the Kingdoms nigh unto the Sea, or in the Cities: But concerning these, see
<HI>Trigautius, Samedus, Atlas, Marinus,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>As for the Buildings within the Walls, those of Private Persons are not
stately, they having more regard to their Convenience than Splendor or Or∣nament;
for the most part they are but one Story, abhorring the trouble of
going up Stairs: but what they want in heighth, they recompence in length
and breadth, which makes it no wonder to find Cities in <HI>China</HI> of a vast extent:
the six Stories of the <HI>Roman</HI> Colledge plac'd in length, would extend fifty Pa∣ces
more than half an <HI>Italian</HI> Mile, which with the Gardens, Schools, and
Courts, would make a City: Nor doth the Splendor or Beauty of the Cities
of <HI>China</HI> come near those of <HI>Europe,</HI> for they admit of no Windows next the
Street, but all inwards, like the Religious Houses of Nuns amongst us. The
Houses of wealthy Persons are splendid and costly, but those of the Magistrates
or <HI>Mandorins</HI> exceed the rest, and may truly be call'd Palaces. In each Metro∣polis
there are fifteen or twenty, and oftentimes more; in the other Cities, for
the most part eight; in the lesser, four; they are all built alike, only some are
bigger than others, according to the Dignity of the Prefect or Magistrate, and
all erected at the Emperor's Cost, for his Officers either Civil or Military.
Neither doth the Emperor only allow them Palaces and Ships, but also Furni∣ture,
Provision, and Servants. The greater Palaces have four or five Courts,
with as many Houses on the Front of the several Courts; in the Frontispiece
of each are three Gates, that in the middle the biggest; both sides of the Gates
are Arm'd with Lions cut in Marble, at whose Bounds is a most capacious
Hall supported with mighty Pillars, call'd <HI>Tang;</HI> in this the Magistrate admi∣nistreth
Iustice, on each side whereof Publick Posts have their Lodgings;
next to this is the inward Hall call'd <HI>Sutang,</HI> which is the Privy-Chamber for
Retirement, Conference, and Salutation: lastly, the great Gate and House,
the Apartment of the Magistrate's Wife and Children, being most richly ador∣ned;
to which is adjoin'd Groves, Gardens, and Lakes, for Pleasure and De∣light.
But yet these Palaces being built all of Wood, have this Inconvenience,
that if a Fire break out, oftentimes whole Cities are reduc'd into Ashes in a
very small space, as it hapned to <HI>Peking,</HI> the greatest City in this large Empire,
except <HI>Nanking,</HI> which was totally consum'd with Fire by a Rebel, at the be∣ginning
of the Irruption made by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> in four Days space; yet it was
restor'd to its pristine Splendor by the <HI>Tartars</HI> in four Years time. But I will
conclude my Discourse of the Fabricks of <HI>China</HI> with the most stupendious, and
never enough to be admir'd Master-piece of all their Works.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The famous Chinese Wall.</HEAD>
<P><HI>COncerning which, thus saith</HI> Martinius <HI>in his</HI> Atlas: This mighty Wall forti∣fies
the Borders of four Kingdoms, the Longitude being three hundred <HI>German</HI>
Miles, of which fifteen make a Degree, <HI>i.e.</HI> twelve hundred <HI>English</HI> Miles. This long Se∣ries
continues without any Gap, only on the North part of the City <HI>Siuen,</HI> in the Province
of <HI>Peking,</HI> which is supply'd with the inaccessible part of a Mountain, and where the Mouth
of the <HI>Saffron River</HI> receiveth the Disembogues of lesser Rivers: The Avenues and
Passes for Strangers and Travellers repairing from Forein Countires, are contriv'd Arch∣wise
like Bridges, or through Vaults under Ground; all the rest uniform, though carried
on for the most part through rough and uneven Countries, forcing a Way not only over
the Skirts, but the Mountains themselves. At commutual Distances, where one may assist
<FIGURE>
<PB N="425" REF="235"/>
</FIGURE>
the other, are planted high Towers, and strong Gates or Sally-Ports, from whence they issue
forth, or retire to, when any Invasion or Assault requires; and convenient Fortresses also ad∣join'd,
not only Defensive, but accommodated for the Reception of the Soldiers, which to
make good and maintain, takes up no less than a Million. The Wall is thirty <HI>Chinesian</HI>
Cubits high, twelve broad, and in some places fifteen.</P>
<P><HI>Xius</HI> Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> and Founder of that Imperial Family, began this
Wall, who excell'd all the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Princes in the Magnitude of his Works,
and the Glory of his Martial Atchievements: Having conquer'd all <HI>China</HI> by
subjugating the Family of <HI>Cheva,</HI> from the Governor of a Province, he arose to
be absolute and sole Monarch, reducing the <HI>Tartars</HI> by many signal Victories;
and to prevent their future Incursions, he began this Work the twenty second
Year of his Reign, which was two hundred and ten Years before <HI>Christ,</HI> and in
five Years space compleated the whole Fabrick, impressing three Men out
of ten throughout the whole Empire, which amounted to many Millions.
And such was the Composure of this miraculous Work, being so strongly
compacted and closely joyn'd, that if in any place of the Cementations a Nail
might be driven between the Stones, those that committed that Error, were to
be put to Death without mercy; by reason whereof the Work became so won∣drous
strong, that it is the greatest part of admiration to this day; for not∣withstanding
the many Vicissitudes of the Empire, Changes of Government,
Batteries and Assaults, not only of the Enemy, but of violent Tempests, De∣luges
of Rain, shaking Winds, and wearing Weather, yet it discovers not the
least sign of Demolishment, nor crack'd or craz'd with Age, but appears al∣mostas
in its first strength, greatness, and beauty; and well may it be, for
whose solidity whole Mountains, by ripping up their rocky Bowels for Quar∣ries,
were levell'd, and vast Desarts, drown'd with deep and swallowing
Sands, swept clean to the firm bottom.</P>
<P>There is also a Channel made by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> at a vast Expence both
of Cost and Labor, for commodious Navigation unto the Royal City of <HI>Pe∣king:</HI>
And although many admire the <HI>Dutch</HI> for their Trenches or Cataracts
cut through the Land for Passage from Place to Place, yet the Channel <HI>Iun</HI> in
<HI>China</HI> is admirable, beyond all their Works; concerning which <HI>Martinius</HI> in his
<HI>Atlas</HI> gives the following Account:</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="236"/>
The Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> deservedly boasts of the River <HI>Iun,</HI> the most famous Chan∣nel
throughout the whole Empire of <HI>China,</HI> digg'd with incredible Labor and Industry, by
which from most Parts of the Empire Ships bring Merchandize to the Royal City of <HI>Pe∣king.</HI>
This Trench beginneth on the North of the City <HI>Socien,</HI> from the Bank of the <HI>Saf∣fron
River,</HI> thence stretching it self unto <HI>Cining</HI> and <HI>Lincing;</HI> from whence in that
Channel it passeth into the River <HI>Quei,</HI> being some hundred Miles. I have counted upon it
above twenty Cataracts or Waterfalls made of hewn Stone, with a Passage for Ships, where
they dam up the Waters with a Sluce, which is easily heav'd up by the benefit of an Engine
with a Wheel, affording an Outlet to the Waters; and if they want Water for great Vessels,
then in the middle Passage, before you come to <HI>Cining,</HI> they let it in from the Lake <HI>Cang,</HI>
through the greatest Cataract, as much as they please, timely closing the Passage, to prevent
an Inundation. These Cataracts are commonly call'd <HI>Tung-pa,</HI> because they sustain the
force of the Water flowing from the Lake: Now when Ships arrive, that they may not be
forc'd to Sail through the Lake, they have cut a Trench or Channel on the Bank, fortifi'd
with Rampiers, by which all Ships do easily pass. At each Cataract are Persons maintain'd at
the Publick Charge, to attend the Ships until they are pass'd the Cataracts.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Chekiang</HI> is rough and mountainous, not able to compare
with other Provinces for great Cities, multitude of Inhabitants; and richness
of Soil, yet affords two Commodities of great Profit, which none of the rest
have, and those of so great use, that they are an Ornament to the whole Em∣pire.
The first is many thousand Bails of the best Paper, which plentifully
furnisheth the fifteen Provinces. The other is that Gum which they call <HI>Cie,</HI>
distilling from Trees, not unlike that which drops from our Fir-Trees; and
of this they make that Varnish wherewith they so dress their Houses, that al∣though
the out-sides be but low and mean, yet within they far exceed all <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
for Splendor, every thing therein being so transparent, that you can look
no where, but as in a Mirror each opposite Object is represented; and being
temper'd with divers Colours, and beautifi'd with Birds, Flowers, and Dra∣gons,
the several Effigies of Gods and Goddesses, and other Figures drawn to
the Life, which at once abundantly delight, and cause admiration in the Be∣holders.
When the Gum is gather'd, they make it of what Colour they please,
but the Gold Colour is in most esteem, and next that the Black. Before it is
dry'd, it sendeth forth venomous Exhalations, which cause Swellings, the
Pthysick, and Consumption; but they who use this Preparation, have an
Antidote ready, which defends them from Infection. Things Painted with
this Gum or Varnish, dry soonest in a damp place; but once dry'd, never
yields nor melteth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> also boast of other excellent Inventions; as first, that ingenious
Art of <HI>PRINTING,</HI> us'd by them long before it was known in <HI>Europe:</HI>
But yet they understand not the right use of it, being ignorant of the Art of
Founding Letters, or Composing with them, but Cutting or Engraving upon
Wood what they have to Print, like our Sculp'd Plates fitted for the Rowling-Press;
so that not being able to Distribute their Character, they are forc'd to
have a standing From for every Page, by which means the Printing of one Vo∣lume
oft-times filleth a whole House with their Typographical Tables; as for
Example, if the whole have but 100 Sheets, they must have 400 Tables.</P>
<P>Secondly, Though we acknowledge they had the Invention of Gun-powder
before us, (because the Fathers of our Society have seen great Ordnance, as big
as <HI>Bazaliscoes,</HI> Cast for a Siege in divers Provinces, especially in <HI>Nanking,</HI> which
are very ancient) yet they never arriv'd to our Perfection, being unskill'd in
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
Fire-works; but their Art in Casting excells, as appears by the mighty Sta∣tues,
great Guns, and ponderous Bells every where frequent, and as the Bells
mention'd in a Letter from Father <HI>Ferdinando Verbist</HI> to Father <HI>Iohn Gruberus</HI> in
<HI>Peking</HI> (in respect of which the greatest in <HI>Europe</HI> may be call'd Saunce-Bells)
shall demonstrate; his words are these: <HI>Anno 1403. there Reign'd an Emperor in
China nam'd</HI> Yum lo, <HI>he that first remov'd the Court from</HI> Nanking <HI>to</HI> Peking, <HI>who
the better to perpetuate his Name, Cast many Bells of a prodigious Magnitude, whereof one
of Iron, and eight of Brass, are now at</HI> Peking, <HI>the least of which are 120000 weight: I
saw seven lying in one place near unto</HI> Chum leu, <HI>all fair and like ours, but the Margents
are not so spreading, nor the top so Conick: And because Father</HI> Athanasius Kircher, <HI>in
his</HI> Musurgia, fol. 522. <HI>hath set down the Measure of the Bell of</HI> Erford <HI>in</HI> Germany,
<HI>which for the bigness he termeth prodigious, I will here give the Dimensions of one of those
which I saw at</HI> Peking, <HI>and compare it with that of</HI> Erford, <HI>reducing Measures to the
Cubits of</HI> China.

<HEAD>Of the Hieroglyphical Characters of the Chineses.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here is no Nation so barbarous, but they have some
way to manifest their Conceptions one to another;
but above others, the <HI>Chineses</HI> have the most significant
Characters; the first Inventor of which was <HI>Fohi,</HI>
about three hundred years after the <HI>Flood,</HI> as their Re∣cords
say, who form'd divers Figures drawn from Ani∣mals,
Birds, Reptils, Fishes, Herbage, Plants, Trees,
and abundance of other things: so that according to
the numerous variety of the Products of Nature, and her several Resemblan∣ces,
such, and so infinite were their Characters; which though the modern
<HI>Chineses,</HI> taught by Experience, have rectifi'd, yet at this day they have above
eighty thousand, the Study of which is the Apex of all their Learning; but
they are able with ten thousand to make out handsomly most Expressions
upon all occasions: Yet those that wade farthest into the Puzzles and Diffi∣culties
of so long Lessons, and so tedious a Science, are preferr'd to the highest
Offices and Dignities of Place, which seldom happens till they grow aged.</P>
<P>The hardness of the Task ariseth from their having no Alphabet, Decli∣nations,
nor Conjugations, but every Case and Gender in Nouns, and every
Person and Tense in Verbs, with the like, have their several and distinct
<FIGURE>
<PB N="430" REF="238"/>
</FIGURE>
Characters: Formerly when they did treat about things of a fiery Nature,
they us'd Serpents, Asps and Dragons; in the description of Aerial Bodies, the
various Order of Birds; in a watry Subject, Fishes; in describing of Vege∣tives,
Flowers, Leaves, and Boughs; in the Constellations, Points and Cir∣cles,
each of which express'd a Star; in indifferent Arguments they exhibited
Wood, Globes, and Threds, dispos'd in a certain Order: But now in stead of
these Figures, they use Strokes and Lines, so contriv'd, that they answer to the
Significations of those drawn from Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Fohi</HI> invent∣ed
the Characters compos'd of Serpents, Dragons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the second was
found out by <HI>Xim Num,</HI> compos'd of the Husbandmans Tools, and us'd in de∣scribing
what belongs to Pasturage or Cultrature. The third sort were by the
Emperor <HI>Xan Hoam</HI> compos'd of the Wings of the Bird <HI>Fam Hoam.</HI> The fourth
form of Characters were contriv'd of Oysters and Silk-worms, by the Empe∣ror
<HI>Chuen Kim.</HI> The fifth were of Roots. The sixth made up of the Claws of
Birds, us'd by the Emperor <HI>Choam Ham.</HI> The seventh was the Work of the Em∣peror
<HI>Yao,</HI> of Tortoises. The eighth sort were Birds and Peacocks. The ninth
are made of Wings, Reeds, and Herbs. The tenth sort was their Art of Me∣mory.
The eleventh, of the Stars and Planets. The twelfth were Characters
us'd in Grants and Priviledges. The thirteenth are the Characters of <HI>Yeu Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Chi Cyan Tao.</HI> The fourteenth are the Characters to express Quietness. The
fifteenth are compos'd of Fishes. The sixteenth is a Composition that now is
neither read nor understood. And these are the Characters of the ancient <HI>Chi∣neses,</HI>
very much like the <HI>Egyptian Hieroglyphicks,</HI> but not adorn'd with such
illustrious Mysteries; in making of which they did not use a Pen and Ink, but
a Pencil, and rather Paint than Write.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinesian</HI> Characters being so numerous, the Language is wonderful
equivocal, and oneword oftentimes, only by the different Pronunciation; or
placing of the Accent, may signifie ten, or sometimes twenty various things,
whereby it is rendred more difficult than possibly can be imagin'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandorin</HI> Language is common to the Empire, and is the same as
the Language of <HI>Castile</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Tuscan</HI> in <HI>Italy:</HI> The Characters are
common unto the whole Empire of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> as also to <HI>Iapan, Couchinchina,
<PB N="431" REF="238"/>
Corea,</HI> and <HI>Touchin,</HI> though the Idiom is much different; so that the People of
<HI>Iapan</HI> &amp;c. do understand Books and Epistles that are written in this sort of
Characters but yet cannot speak mutually to, or understand one another;
like the Figures of Numbers us'd throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> and by all Persons under∣stood,
although the Words by which they are pronounced are exceeding dif∣ferent;
so that 'tis one thing to know the <HI>Chinesian</HI> Language, and another to
speak the Tongue.</P>
<P>A Stranger that hath a strong Memory, and doth apply himself to Study,
may arrive to a great heighth of that Learning, by reading the <HI>Chinefian</HI> Books,
although he be neither able to speak it himself, or understand those that speak
it. But Father <HI>Iacobus Pantoja,</HI> according to the Musical Notes, <HI>Ut, Re, Mi, Fa,
Sol, La,</HI> first of all found out the rising and falling of the Accents to be obser∣ved
in the Pronunciation, assisted by which, they overcome the Difficulties of
the Language. The first of the five <HI>Chinese</HI> Accents answereth to the Musical
Note <HI>Ut,</HI> and the sound of it is call'd in the <HI>Chinese, Cho Pim,</HI> as if you should
say, <HI>The first word equally proceeding.</HI> The second Note answereth to <HI>Re,</HI> and it is
term'd in the <HI>Chineses</HI> Language <HI>Pum Xim,</HI> that is, <HI>A clear equal Voice.</HI> The third
Note agreeth with <HI>Mi,</HI> and the sound in the <HI>Chinese</HI> is <HI>Xam Xim,</HI> that is, <HI>A lofty
Voice,</HI> The fourth Note is sounded like <HI>Fa,</HI> and is term'd in the <HI>Chinese, Kiu
Xun,</HI> that is, <HI>The elated Voice of one that is going away.</HI> The fifth Note answering
to <HI>Sol,</HI> in the <HI>Chinese</HI> is call'd <HI>Se Xun,</HI> that is, <HI>The proper Voice or Speech of one that is
coming in:</HI> For Example, that one word <HI>Ya,</HI> written in the <HI>European</HI> Characters,
and having the five Notes above affixed, it must be prounc'd with divers Voi∣ces
and Accents; A Tooth, <HI>Yâ;</HI> Dumb, <HI>Yā;</HI> Excellent, <HI>Yà;</HI> Stupidity, <HI>Yá;</HI>
A Goose, <HI>Ya:</HI> For as the same word suggesteth divers Significations, and the
Speech spoken slower or faster resembleth the Modes and Times in Musick;
so from the Words of Monosyllables (for the <HI>Chineses</HI> have none of <HI>bis, tres,</HI> or
more Syllables) is a timely Harmony; by the help of which Notes Strangers
may attain to something of the Tongue, though with great Labor, and inde∣fatigable
Patience: And though the same word hath one Signification in the
<HI>Mandorins</HI> Language, and a contrary in <HI>Iapan</HI> and other Places, yet knowing
this one Speech and Character, you may Travel not only through the Empire
of <HI>China,</HI> but the adjacent Kingdoms.</P>

<CLOSER>THose that are earnest to make further scrutiny in quest of all these wonderful Rela∣tions,
may resort to the Author himself, and to those in his Quotations; for this
we thought a sufficient Appendix to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Embassy, the one seeming the better to Illu∣strate
the other, many of the same Concerns being handled in both.</CLOSER>
