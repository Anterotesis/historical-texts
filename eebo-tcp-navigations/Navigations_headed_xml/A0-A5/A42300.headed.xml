<HEAD>To the RIGHT WORSHIPFUL, And my Much Honoured Friend, Sr. <HI>Edward Greaves</HI> Baronet, Fellow of the Colledge OF PHYSICIANS in <HI>London,</HI> AND Physician in Ordinary TO HIS MAJESTY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE kind reception you were pleased to afford a small Pa∣per of mine, that had lately the ho∣nour to have your Name prefixt,
<PB REF="5"/> hath given this encouragement to present to your view, a further Col∣lection of Experiments touching the same Subject, relating to the Waters of <HI>Bathe,</HI> a place you were pleased once to grace with your Practice, and still with your Favours, for which a more than ordinary respect is, in gratitude, your due.</P>
<P>Besides, Considering you have so far favoured my late Enquiries, as to assist me by your presence, and be an Eye-witness of some of the Experiments, and are a suffici∣ent Judge of them all, I could not fix on any fitter than your self, and the Learned Body you have Relation to, to make this Address unto, or give the Trouble of this present Dedication.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>It hath caus'd me sometimes not a little to admire, That the Me∣tropolitan Waters of all <HI>England,</HI> (as I may term Them) to say no more, should lye 2000 years, and it may be much longer, in so narrow a Diocess; for the dis∣covery I have made of many Things relating to Them, (of which in part here is some Account) that were never taken notice of by for∣mer Persons, and those few Wri∣ters that have Treated of Them, will Justifie the Expression.</P>
<P>The Principles formerly were accounted Sulphur, Copper, Iron, and a little Marcasite; of late, Bi∣tumen, Nitre, and some Sulphur, which last I endeavour to Confirm, with the Addition of many more, which will partly Constitute, and partly evidence the Nature of these
<PB REF="6"/> Waters: Besides the beneficial dis∣covery of the Rational use of the Bath-waters in Potion, which hi∣therto having been but as a good Back-Sword, are now become a Single-Rapier, ready to save, and not destroy, unless ill manag'd by a distemper'd hand.</P>
<P>I confess I did not think to have appeared in this Dress, having de∣signed, and in part compleated, as you know very well, something else, that would have better suited with my Condition, the Dignity of the Subject, and Reputation of These Waters. But finding some hasty Chirurgion that hath already launced what I intended should have had a longer Time to digest, and expecting, as none but in rea∣son must, the Pretences of many others, I found my self oblig'd to
<PB REF="6"/> appear, though in a careless habit, and in a manner undrest, rather than too much to exercise the Pa∣tience, if not justly incur the Cen∣sure of those friends, whose kind∣ness shall induce them to give me a Visit.</P>
<P>And although my Nature in∣clines me rather to a diffidence, than presumption on any thing that is my own, yet I must be so far confident as to believe, that the Existence of Nitre in the Waters of <HI>Bathe,</HI> so much question'd by some, and my particular Concern, is so fully establisht by the fol∣lowing Experiments, made with my own hands, as to keep those words upright in my late Letter to your self, wherein I assert it to be un∣deniable. And whoever shall take the pains to satisfie himself in that
<PB REF="7"/> Particular, as I have done, and shall let me know wherein he is dissatisfied, and can convince me to the Contrary, whom I will as∣sure he shall not find obstinate, he shall have the Honour, if that be any thing, of making me his Convert, (for I think my sin∣gle Reputation a small Sacrifice on the Altar of Truth;) but if not, it will appear, which is no great matter on either hand, that some Body hath been mistaken.</P>
<P>However the Satisfaction is not little, nor the Omen bad, that I have already gained the Appro∣bation of a Person so Judicious as your self, who have formerly taken pains on the same Account, and on which side soever the Scales shall turn, I have had this
<PB REF="7"/> opportunity of doing something to oblige my Countrey, as well as acknowledg my self</P>

<HEAD>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat the Reader may be acquainted with the occasion, time, and manner of my making these Enquiries (which are not hasty conclusions, but the product of more mature conside∣ration) I shall here premise something concerning that, and also discourse of, as more perti∣nent in this place, some other matters tending to the enlargement of the Reputation, and usefulness of the Waters.</P>
<P>Taking therefore into consideration the performances of some before me, and the attempts of others, in my time, which were not satisfactory, and having the ad∣vantages of a more retired nature, and constant re∣sidence on the place, with those Conveniencies which some others have not had, I thought it worth my while to employ my leisure hours in some Experiments on
<PB REF="9"/> the Waters, which none had done before to any great purpose, the Waters having hitherto been rather ad∣mir'd than understood, if so I might give my own Curiosity satisfaction in that affair. And indeed, no vain glorious humour of desiring to be Popular, which I never affected, nor itch to have my Name in print, which hath been already sufficiently done by the kind∣ness of my friends, and therefore needs not any labour of my own again, was the occasion of my entring on this undertaking; but observing the Bath-water was drank by some, and probably like to advance, I could not satisfie my self in advising my Patients to it, un∣less I had first made a particular search into what it did contain, it seeming as absurd to me to tell my friends tbat depended on my judgment for their health and preservation, they should drink the Bath-water, which I knew nothing of, as to advise them to the use of such Spirits, Pills, or any other Medicine, I was ignorant of the composition of, or had procured from others.</P>
<P>Had I found this done to my hand, I could well have dispensed witb the confinement and risque this design hath occasion'd, and spent these hours I have done in my Study, as chearfully elsewhere, but find∣ing little satisfaction in what had been before per∣form'd, I first made collection out of the best Mineral Authors, such as <HI>Fallopius, Agricola, Baccius,</HI> and others, what was the best way to obtain a Sediment out of any Water, and then how to know of what that sediment did consist, making application of this Theory to the Waters of this place.</P>
<P>Observing then the waies of gaining a Sediment to be chiefly sour, <HI>Evaporation, Distillation, Precipita∣tion,</HI> and <HI>Insolation,</HI> the last, as too laborious, I thought fit to wave, and resolved on the other three, Evapo∣rating precipitating, and distil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing first small quantities
<PB REF="9"/> of all the Baths, which gave me encouragement to pro∣ceed to greater.</P>
<P>Having obtained a Sediment, which I call the <HI>Contents</HI> of the Water, the very Notion of which was but lately a stranger here, I trusted not to my single judgment, but made it known to the best Physicians of my acquaintance, with whom I had Converse, particularly my ever honoured friend Sr. <HI>Edward Greaves,</HI> whose encouragement to this design hath not been little, and also addressed my self in writing to the very Ingenious and Eminent Doctor <HI>Willis</HI> (whose loss all Ingenious Philosophers and Physicians must la∣ment, his many thoughts now dying with him) whose assistance I desired by Letter dated <HI>1. Sept.—73,</HI> in these words:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Acquaintance I had the happiness to have with you formerly in <HI>Oxon,</HI> and the Civilities you have been pleased to confer on me since, with the readiness you have ever exprest of encouraging all ingenious Inquiries, have emboldened me to give you this Interruption. The desire also I under∣stand you have expressed to Mr. <HI>Robert Chapman</HI> an Apothecary of this City, of a better account of the Contents of these Waters, which hath hitherto I know not how, been too much neglected, and concerning which I have of late made some Ex∣periments, hath further encouraged me only at pre∣sent to acquaint you, that about <HI>Michaelmas</HI> next, God willing, I shall have a conveniency by a friend of mine, your Neighbour, to send you the true Contents of all the Baths apart, which if you please to examine, and honour me so far as to return me your thoughts of the Ingredients, being doubtless a
<PB REF="10"/> Compounded body, I shall with all alacrity and obsequiousness imaginable give you a larger account of my Observations, vvhich I forbear to do till you please to favour me with an Answer, that so I may not preoccupy your more exact enquiry. The thing it self being of so grand import, and so well suiting with your own genius, I may promise my self the greater happiness in your Correspondence, &amp;c. which is all the trouble shall at this time be given by</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most humble Servant, <HI>T. G.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>According to this Letter, I sent the Doctor what I promised, on the <HI>15.</HI> of <HI>October</HI> next ensuing, by my facetious, learned, good friend, Mr. <HI>Alexander Dyer,</HI> with this Letter, which because it contains the rude draught of what I afterwards took more pains about, and not much different from what I now publish, I shall here insert.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEaring nothing of <HI>Colonel Morgan,</HI> the Person I designed for conveyance of what I for∣merly promised, I have now met with a conveni∣ent opportunity by my vvorthy friend Mr. <HI>Alex. Dyer</HI> to present you with as true an Anatomy of the Baths, as my present inspection will permit: <HI>viz.</HI> The Contents of all the Baths, <HI>Kings, Cross</HI> and <HI>Hot,</HI> in Iron and Glass Vessels; the former ℥i. of each, the latter ℥ii. or thereabouts; that in Glass being all that one Gallon of the Water of each Bath did afford; the other in Iron, not the whole quantity,
<PB REF="10"/> but sufficient, I hope, for your satisfaction, that came from four Gallons, the <HI>Kings Bath</HI> yielding in Iron, on my first Experiment ʒxiiii; the <HI>Cross</HI> ʒxii ss; the <HI>Hot</HI> ℥ix. ℈ii: but on my second Trial performed in the late wet weather, much less out of the same vessel, and quantity of water, which may suggest something to Enquiry if I find it hold. But usually out of 4 Gallons in a Vessel of mixt Mettal, I commonly evaporate it in, I have ℥i. out of a gallon of all the Baths alike, so that I judge about ʒii. to be the common proportion out of a gallon the Water will afford.</P>
<P>Now of these ʒii, as I suppose, you will easily discover all is not Salt, but according to my best observation I find a third part only Saline, or ℈ii. in ʒii: the residue, which I have sent under the name of <HI>Residuum Sedimenti non Salinum,</HI> will not relent but continues of a gritty nature, and I suppose, consists of two different substances.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ochre</HI> ariseth in a large quantity, where the stream of the Bath meets with any resistance; but what I am not so fully satisfied in for the present is, that though so much continually is breathed out of the water, nothing yellow is discovered in the Con∣tents.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oleum Salis Thermarum per deliquium,</HI> is only that Salt I have sent you by the name of <HI>Sal Thermarum</HI> relented in the air, and cleansed from impurities that will subside, but tincted greenish by a touch of Copper it met with in extracting, when otherwise the true colour is more inclining to Amber.</P>
<P>One thing more also I think fit to advertise you of, that in Glass Vessels there is a thin crust in the outside covering that part that is most Saline, as thin as the thinnest Wafer, but not Salt at all,
<PB REF="11"/> which I have caused to be separated in the Con∣tents of the <HI>Hot Bath,</HI> and put in a distinct glass containing ʒi. gr. 10; this more flakey and much less, if at all Saline, being only ℈ii. gr. 14. The <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Cross Bath</HI> are alike, mixed here in one glass, only the <HI>Hoth Bath</HI> separated for your further satisfaction.</P>
<P>You have also the Sand, Mud, and Scum, in Boxes by themselves, all which I submit to your more exact scrutiny what names to call these by, which is the grand thing in question, and <HI>on which will be built, as I conceive, the truest Hypothesis of the Nature and Vertues of these Waters that hath yet been given, and much different from what hath hi∣therto been supposed and presumed on.</HI></P>
<P>I hope to have the honour of a few lines from you, what your thoughts are of the nature of these particulars, vvhich vvill be very acceptable to</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your obliged humble Servant, <HI>THO. GUIDOTT.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<DIV2 TYPE="postscript">
<HEAD>Postscript.</HEAD>
<P>IN an ordinary infusion of any of the Contents in Common Water, you will observe a white gritty substance, which will harden into a stone in the bot∣tom of the glass, one of which I have sent in the Box containing <HI>Sedimentum non Salinum;</HI> above that a blewish light, and more dirty substance; then the Salt in the Water to which it gives a yellow tin∣cture.</P>
<PB REF="11"/>
<P>The Doctors business being much on other accounts, I cannot understand he did any thing in this, only in a Latin Letter he had occasion to write me not long after, on the account of an Honourable Patient, for whom we then were both concern'd he takes a very kind notice of my Letters, and Experiments, and gives me thanks in this expression, <HI>Clarissime Domine, Multum Tibi debeo pro Litteris &amp; Experimentis Tuis circa Aquas Thermales mihi jam pridem mis∣sis, quae officia Tua ut gratissima habeo, ita compen∣sare studebo;</HI> but sent me no other satisfaction.</P>
<P>A little after, having an opportunity of obtaining the Contents of many Hogsheads of the Water, I wrought them all of, and came to an exact separation and distinction of Particulars, as expressed in the Ob∣servations hereunto annexed, and as occasion served, com∣municated my Experiments to my Honoured friends, the Learned and accomplisht Sr. <HI>Charles Scarbo∣rough,</HI> Doctor <HI>Thomas Witherley,</HI> Dr. <HI>Nathaniel Highmore,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Thomas Harbech.</HI> This I think is sufficient to take off the surmise of Singularity, if any such thing by chance should be thought upon.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but admire how a Judicious man should be so far imposed on by any person what∣soever, as to imagine, that a satisfactory enquiry into the nature of these Waters was so nice a speculation, as to be <HI>inconvenient</HI> or <HI>useless</HI> [according to these words; <HI>I have been desirous heretofore to have attempted some discovery of our Baths,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jord.</HI> Nat. Bath, c. <HI>17.</HI> in fin. p. <HI>147.</HI></NOTE> <HI>according to those Principles: but being thought (by some) either not convenient, or not useful, I was willing to save my labour, which perhaps might have seem∣ed not to be worth thanks.]</HI> For, what can be more necessary, and therefore useful and convenient too, than to know the Principles of any Water we recom∣mend our Patients to? and what did all the Mineral
<PB REF="12"/> Writers that treated of such Waters before him whose authority he uses, but either make such enquiries, or speak by guess? and which of these two is the more useful or convenient, is easily determin'd.</P>
<P>Besides, by this means we act as rational Physicians, and free the Baths and Mineral Waters from that aspersion they labour under, of being accounted Em∣pirical Medicines, whereas they are the exact compo∣sition of the best Physician, and perform their opera∣tions by virtue of the Ingredients they consist of, and the blessing of God Almighty, as all other good Medi∣cines and Prescriptions do.</P>
<P>Moreover, this way we can better judge of the rea∣son of the effects, which without this, perplex the un∣derstanding with an ignorant admiration, and we prove no better than the ordinary Spectators at a Puppet-play, who admire the motions, but know no∣thing of the hand within that occasions them.</P>
<P>I confess indeed, <HI>his thinking his pains might not have deserved thanks,</HI> might somewhat discourage him; but a man of Resolution would have considered that things of this kind, subjected to publick view, would fall either into the hands of understanding, ge∣nerous and unbiast persons; or else ignorant, self-interested, and narrow Souls: the former ever have been, and will be ever ready to give what encourage∣ment ingenuity shall deserve; and for the other, they are not much to be regarded, being best brought to a knowledge of themselves by an understanding of their errors; and as their mouths are no slanders, so their thanks are but slender, if any, commendations. And thanks be to God for it, there have been and now are many worthy, brave, and generous Spirits in this our Nation, who can discern and make distinction 'twixt things that differ, else had would be the condition ef those that have broken through that opposition at
<PB REF="12"/> which others have boggled, and think it no disparage∣ment to undergo rude Censures from the ruder multi∣tude, in prosecution of a design for publick advantage.</P>
<P>Although the Credit of the Waters hath been pre∣served by Bathing, and advanced by Drinking, espe∣cially these two Summers last past, yet a far greater degree of Reputation may be acquired, by a more par∣ticular account of the more remarkable Cures that are annually wrought, principally thereby; which be∣ing digested into the nature of a Register, would mightily conduce to the satisfaction of those that seek remedy here in the like distempers. And although I have endeavoured what in me lay to promote so neces∣sary a good work, yet such is the stupidity of some to things of their own advantage, that nothing of this nature hath yet been performed, although recom∣mended by the learned Doctor <HI>Jorden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B. <HI>Ch.</HI> 18. <HI>in fin. p.</HI> 163.</NOTE> then practising on the place, and often inculcated, though with like success, by my self: So that to the wonderful honour of those on whom it must reflect, the Waters have been more beholding to the gratitude of Forreigners in registring their own Cases, than to the care and duty of those that are at home. I shall instance in the Case of Sr. <HI>Humphrey Lloyd,</HI> who having received a hurt in his Hip, hy the kick of a horse in <HI>Milain,</HI> was grievously afflicted with a Sciatica for a twelve months time, and after having made use of much Physick, from several Physicians, to little purpose, in only six daies using these Waters was perfectly recovered.

<P>And that I may mention one fresh in the memory of all, whose gratitude in this kind deserves a remem∣brance, Mr. <HI>John Revet,</HI> an aged man, hath very late∣ly publickly testified his cure of an <HI>Hemiplegia,</HI> in a months bathing, by an Inscription round a very fair Brass ring, on the right hand of the Entrance into the Queens Bath out of the Kings, after this manner; <HI>Thanks to God. I</HI> John Revet <HI>his Majesties Bra∣zier, at 56 years of age, in this present month of</HI> July <HI>1674, in this place recovered a cure of health and limbs, of the</HI> Dead Palsey, <HI>on one side, from head to foot.</HI></P>
<P>That this way of Registring of Cures was also thought necessary, and recommended before the time of Dr. <HI>Jorden,</HI> may appear from the words of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> an honest <HI>Cambrobritan</HI> (whose authority I am constrained to make often use of in the following discourse, in regard he is the only man that hath treat∣ed any thing largely of these Waters,) which I re∣cite as they are, being the plain words of an honest meaning man.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bathes A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>fol.</HI> 33.</NOTE> <HI>I wish▪</HI> saith he <HI>that you leave a Note of the Commodity received, and a knowledge of your condition and calling in the Records of the Mayor of the City, where it shall be registred, until a Physician be appointed, who then shall be joyned with the Mayor, paying to the Poor-man's Box, and 4 pence for Registring your benefit received there.</HI> [And in another place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buxtons Benefit, <HI>fol.</HI> 22.</NOTE>] <HI>Alway provided the day of your coming thither be noted before you enter into the Baths, and the day of your departure, with the Country of your habitation, condition, or cal∣ling, with the Infirmities or cause you came for, in the Register book kept of the Warden of the Bath,
<PB REF="13"/> or the Physician that there shall be appointed, and the benefit you received, paying four pence for the Recording.</HI> This Register may be so contriv'd as that the Patients name, or only letters thereof, as shall be thought expedient, with thir place of residence, distem∣per, and time of using the Waters, may be exprest in short; a model whereof, in many instances, we have in <HI>Jo. Bauhinus</HI> de Aquis <HI>Bollensibus,</HI> lib. <HI>1.</HI> cap. <HI>17.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas mention is here made of the Poor-man's Box, it gives me a good occasion to remind this Age, of what prudent and charitable disposition the former Age was, in which for the necessary support of the many Poor that came hither for relief, (now sufficiently numerous, and burthensom too) Repara∣tions and Conveniences of the Bath, and other good uses, a Tax, or Pole-bill was made, and willingly con∣sented to by the users of such Waters, by which a cer∣tain reasonable rate, or sum, was required of every man or woman of all conditions, from a Duke to a Yeoman, by which all Clamours, now too frequent, were prevented, and all occasions of Exactions taken away, no person paying, or requiring more than what was commonly known to be their due, reserving their Gratuities to dispose of as they please. The mony collected to be put into the Treasury of the Bath, and intrusted in the hands of one or two honest and suf∣ficient persons, who should every <HI>Michaelmas</HI> give up their Accounts, and dispose of good part of the mony chiefly to the use of the poor abroad that come with good Certificates, or accounts of their condition, to be approved of by competent Judges in this case, and other necessary, good, and charitable uses, as shall be thought requisite; provided the Baths, Pumps, or any of their appurtenances be supply'd, and kept in good order and repair. And this was never intended in any violent or compulsory way, but only as a fair pro∣posal
<PB REF="14"/> to the better disposed persons, who by their good example, and readiness to comply in this particular, may have an efficacious influence on the more captious and excepting, to beget in them a better understand∣ing of this charitable, and orderly design.</P>
<P>Neither can this Tax in reason be imagin'd to be prejudicial to the Waters, as some others are reported to have been; on the imposition of which the Waters are said to have lost their virtue: for however the truth of such stories may be admitted, which are de∣liver'd by credible Authors, and I cannot contradict, yet certain it is, that if any such thing ever hap∣pen'd, it was either on the restraint of a publick re∣sort, by denying Poor people the use of the Waters, or else by an Impost collected by the Officers of the Prince to his private advantage; whereas this is only to pre∣vent exactions, and moral abuses, between man and man, and the Poor rather hence to be relieved than exacted of, with a probability of a much greater re∣sort that will be procured by a reasonable demand, and good order withal.</P>
<P>The overplus of this Collection, if rightly manag'd, and the years prove lucky, may in a short time, make a purse for the covering one or two of the Baths also, whereby the Waters would be rendred useful all the year, which hy reason of the coldness of the ambient Air, and fear of injury thereby, and no other, are thought not so fit to be used in the Winter season, the Waters then being as effectual as in Summer.</P>
<P>And this would be agreeable to the use and custom of most of the Baths in <HI>Europe</HI> which are cover'd, and thought by the best Physicians to be a means of keeping the Waters to an even Temper, being an equal defence against the wind and cold of the Winter, and the troublesom heat of the Sun in Summer; so that nothing external causing alteration supervening, the
<PB REF="14"/> benefit of the Waters may be safely received from the first of <HI>January,</HI> to the last of <HI>December,</HI> which would be much for the relief of those infirm persons that require a longer stay than ordinary here, and by their so long absence from the Bath, do but weave <HI>Pe∣nelope</HI>'s web, undoing in the Winter, what is done in Summer; whereas if they did in this manner, as we say, follow their blows, they probably would not only prevent a relapse, but set themselves in a way of perfect recovery with one resolution, without many comings at several seasons, being many times not so well at their second coming, as they went away on their first season of bathing.</P>
<P>For this use I think the Queens Bath most con∣venient, both in regard it is but small, and also more especially for the conveniences of the Slips, and Hou∣ses about it, where it is almost no more than out of Bath, into Bed; and if well cover'd, and care taken in rising, may be as well as if a man made use of a Bath in his own house or Chamber where he lies. After which the Cross Bath may follow, if it be thought fit, the Kings, and Hot, being kept open still.</P>
<P>But against this I foresee two Objections will be made. First, <HI>That it will be inconvenient in the Summer time to sit so close, if no offence doth a∣rise from the steam.</HI> And, Secondly, <HI>That it will be injurious to the Lights about the Bath.</HI></P>
<P>To the first, I answer generally; That those per∣sons that desire good, will think nothing an inconve∣nience that is in order to it, and those that come for pleasure may be somewhere else; yet that it may ap∣pear to be made out some other way, I suppose the increase of Heat, which sometimes that Bath wants, procured by keeping the Air out, and the steam in great measure in, (which yet will not be more than
<PB REF="15"/> will well be endured) will make a sufficient recom∣pence for this supposed molestation. And as for the Steam, a vent hole, or Tunnel at the top, will so dis∣charge, that it may not be offensive or troublesome at all.</P>
<P>As to the Lights, the Cross Bath will certainly inconvenience none, and the Queens may be so con∣triv'd, if made flat, as to do the same but if built more erect for gaining room below, there will be but a very little blind, or perhaps none at all, to the lower Windows on the <HI>Hart</HI> lodging side, which house, by reason of the accommodation of the Slip thereunto belonging, being, in all probability, likely to partake most of the profit, may contribute a little in this kind. But to avoid all exception, the Cover may be so made with shutters on a Timber frame, that it may be easily taken off if there be occasion, and as soon closed up again, if necessity shall require.</P>
<P>One thing more I shall only add, which as a means to establish greater order and content, with submission to more political judgments, I here propose, That I con∣ceive that the persons having dependance more imme∣diately on the Bath, may be better paid by Salaries, than the <HI>Nunquam-satis-arbitrary</HI> way now on foot; That their number may be lessen'd, being by that rea∣son, and (the consequent thereof) their necessity, only such as repine at now, and prey one upon another; and that two Serjeants, four able men to manage the Pumps, and cleanse the Baths, four Women to intro∣duce and place the Females; with twelve Chair-men, may be sufficient. The Salaries to be paid them by the Officer in chief, collected by the Serjeant, and raised by a moderate demand by the Pole from the Ʋsers of the Waters, according to their conditions, quality, and time of stay at the Bath, expressed in a Table for that purpose mentioned before; and if any
<PB REF="15"/> other clamorous demands, uncivil deportment, neglect, or want of duty, should at any time happen in those Servants, upon complaint made, to be animadverted on, suspended, or discharged by the Authority under which they are. These things some may make light of, but the Prudent will consider.</P>

<HEAD>A Discourse of BATHE, AND THE HOT WATERS There.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving formerly, in the year 1668, annexed a brief discourse of <HI>Bathe</HI> to one of Doctor <HI>Jorden</HI>'s of Natu∣ral Bathes and Mineral Waters, un∣der the name of an <HI>Appendix con∣cerning Bathe,</HI> by which and some other pains I had taken about the Treatise it self, I thought I had obliged (as was the opinion of most) not only the Relations of the deceased Au∣thor, but all his Friends and Well-wishers; but meeting, contrary to all expectation, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude and unhandsom returns from an Impudent person, to
<PB N="2" REF="18"/> whose Temper the modest Doctour was a great stranger, and of whose behaviour he would be much asham'd, were he now alive; who on his pretended relation hath repaid me with ill lan∣guage, and foolishly threatned me with Trouble for my good will. Now to put an end to all disputes of this kind, I have thought fit to appeal to any understanding person, that hath his senses exercised, and his wits about him, (for all have not, and some have none at all) whether my Additions have been any impair to the Doctor's Reputation, whom I have treated with all the Civility imaginable; and for the Sale of the Book (a good argument of its acceptance) I believe there were not more sold in the Doctor's life time, of what he printed himself, than went off the first year of my Impression. But to silence all Cavils and silly Objections of this nature, I have discharged that Author, and published in this discourse my own thoughts and Observations, and how much different they are from his, or agreeable to Truth, may best be de∣termin'd by the ingenious Reader.</P>
<P>I did intend indeed, according to my Promise in the end of my Preface to the Edition of Dr. <HI>Jorden,</HI> to have amplified that small discourse into an <HI>History of Bathe;</HI> but finding no encouragement since to that de∣sign, and many things that have made me alter my resolution, my intentions are to wave that, and apply my self, in some convenient time, to the <HI>Roman Court,</HI> where I shall have a fairer Trial, and more Justice done me. In the mean time, I hope this may in some measure stop the gap, and release me of my obligation to the Candid world; especially consi∣dering that the Antiquities of the Baths and City can hardly, I think, be improved higher, and the Mystery of the Sacred Waters of <HI>Minerva,</HI> is not
<PB N="3" REF="18"/> to be profan'd, which it wants little of if idly pro∣stituted to vulgar Capacities; which, besides that they are incompetent Judges in other matters, are apt to put a sinister interpretation on those very things, that really are, and were so intended for their own advantage; neither had I published the Observations I now do in this language, had it not been on a more particular account.</P>
<P>The ill Usages and great Indignities I have al∣ready met withal, from an ungrateful people, in the prosecution of my design of making further En∣quiries into the Nature of those Waters, are not here to be mentioned; they are sufficiently known to be products of Envy and Malice, and as I have hitherto contemned what pitiful opposition could be made against me by the united strength of En∣vy, Pride, Beggery and Revenge; so I shall not surcease my Thoughts in due time of performing that which will be better esteem'd by more Judici∣ous persons, and render me and my design most acceptable when best understood. It was a fit re∣turn of a grave Divine to a vainglorious opposer of his good Inclinations, <HI>Nec propter Te coepi, nec propter Te desinam. Thou, Satan,</HI> said he, <HI>hast nothing to do with my Concerns, for thou art at neither end of my design; and as I did not begin to do thee a kindness, so I will continue notwithstanding thy rage.</HI> Such unclean Spirits have no more to do with pub∣lick affairs, than to interrupt the quiet of better than themselves; and are like a troublesom Curr on the Road, that doth little else, with a besom tail and a whiffling bark, than make a man well mount∣ed look back, his horse kick, and so returns.</P>
<P>It hath ever been the fate of New Discoveries to meet with Course entertainment at their first appearance; and whereas men are usually courteous
<PB N="4" REF="19"/> and civilly demean'd to strange Persons, they treat strange Opinions and new Inventions at another rate. 'Tis the only Policy accounted to keep a bal∣lance among men, and if any one by a more than ordinary industry and God's blessing on it, hath made at any time a conquest in the Intellectual world, whereby 'tis thought he may get the start of his Neighbours, a rotten <HI>Cabal</HI> shall make head a∣gainst him, and perhaps, use him with as much se∣verity as a forceable Intruder on another's right; whereas the Secrets of Nature are free to all, and the Victor here enters not by Blood, and Rapine, and Tyrannical oppression, but in a way both innocent in it self, and advantagious to others.</P>
<P>When I reflect on the hard measure the Re∣nowned Dr. <HI>Harvey</HI> met withal from the pride and peevishness of some conceited Brethren (who esteem nothing Currant but what bears their image and superscription, if not minted in their own brain) on his first demonstration of the Circulation to the World, I cannot but conclude, if I had no other instance for it, That neither Ingenuity, Learning, Modesty, nor any thing that is good and truly valua∣ble can give protection from, though a sufficient antidote against, the poyson of Envy; <HI>Envy,</HI> that spreading Ring-worm, that <HI>Ʋbiquitarian</HI> infection, that Canker of what is sound, and Rust of what is bright! to be found almost in all places, in Town and in Country, in the Shop and in the Street, in the Tavern and in the Ale-house; it hovers over all, and pitches where it can, till at last, if it hurt not others, it preys upon it self:
<Q><L>Thou wicked Fiend! that ne'r didst good,</L>
<L>But hast perversly it withstood,</L>
<L>And ever will, till Time shall be</L>
<L>No more, or We</L>
<L>Be rid of Thee.</L></Q></P>
<PB N="5" REF="19"/>
<P>But to pass by things of this nature with that of the unconcerned <HI>Graecian</HI> to as abusive persons, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; or that of <HI>Tacitus, Convitia spreta exolescunt,</HI> the best answer being nothing at all; I shall rather chuse to acquaint the Read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, That whereas I conceive, when I writ my Letter of Observations, that <HI>Bitumen</HI> and <HI>Sul∣phur</HI> were not primarily concern'd in the Body of the Waters, and therefore no way observable in the Contents; by fresher Experiments and Observations of a later date, I am inclin'd to believe, that <HI>Sul∣phur</HI> is one ingredient in the Contents of the Wa∣ters, though not proportionable in quantity to the Salts, and lost in the bringing them to a better co∣lour. For if two or three ounces of the Contents, which at first much resemble the courser sort of Sugar, be put into a Crucible in order to fusion, when the Crucible is red, and before the Salt doth run, there is the perfect colour and smell of Brim∣stone, insomuch that it may be sensibly discerned in any part of the room, and as the Salt draws nearer the state of Fusion, the Sulphur wasts and is dimi∣nished; so that as dross or Recrement it burns off in Calcination, and is no way concerned in the refined Salt, though one Ingredient in the Waters, and contained in their body.</P>
<P>I shall further add, that I made a <HI>Lixivium</HI> of the Salt calcin'd before fusion, when probably the Sulphurous parts, or so reputed, were not all con∣sum'd, and observ'd so great a <HI>foetor</HI> in the <HI>Lixivi∣um</HI> representing Sulphur so effectually to my smell, that it presently obtain'd the Testimony (if that be any thing) of that sense.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="6" REF="20"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The Opinion of a late Author concerning the Nature of the Baths of <HI>Bathe.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh. May∣ow</HI> LL. D. &amp; Med.</NOTE>AND here I cannot but take notice of a Novel Writer, who Magisterially thus determines: <HI>Quod ad Nitrum &amp; Sulphur attinet, quibus Thermas Bathonienses imbutas esse hactenus creditum est, eorum neutrum Aquis Thermarum istarum solutum esse arbi∣tror: As to what concerns Nitre and Sulphur, with which the Bathes of Bathe have hitherto been thought to be impregnated, I suppose there is nothing of either of them dissolved in the Waters.</HI></P>
<P>A bold assertion! which had it been vented and believed but 50 years ago, would have prevented much trouble in evincing the contrary; but, since 'tis in fashion to be peremptory, I do assert, <HI>That both Nitre and Sulphur are to be found in all the Bathes of Bathe, and that dissolved in, and mixed with, the Body of the Waters.</HI> In order to the Proof of which, I shall take some account of the forementioned Author's 15th. Chapter of his Tract of Sal-Nitre, the arguments he hath against it, and his opinion to the contrary.</P>
<P>His words therefore, as well as I can translate them, are these:</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>Among the most celebrated Bathes, we may justly reckon those of <HI>Bathe,</HI> in which admirable Waters, a continual Vestal and sacred Fire is maintain'd, as if things of a most different na∣ture were interleagu'd. Before I come to the manner how these Bathes receive their Heat, it will not be improper if I make some enquiry into the Contents of these Waters.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
<P>It is therefore manifest, that the Bathes of <HI>Bathe</HI> are impregnated with a certain Salt of an acid na∣ture, for if any Sal alkali, or volatil Salt purely salin'd, be mixed with these Waters, a precipita∣tion will ensue, and the Waters will become tur∣bid, and of a milky nature.</P>
<P>Moreover, The <HI>Bathe</HI>-water powred on boyl∣ing Milk, will coagulate it, as any other acid doth.</P>
<P>Neither doth this acid Salt seem to be the only Salt of the <HI>Bathe,</HI> but is complicated with an Al∣kali; for if the Water be evaporated quite away, a certain Salt of a more fixt nature will be found in the bottom of the vessel, which, on the powr∣ing of any acid on it, will ferment.</P>
<P>Of the same nature also are the Mud and Sand of the Bathe, which are wrought up with the Springs; for any acid liquor being powred on them, an Ebullition will follow.</P>
<P>There may be also observed in these Waters a Salt, or rather a Lime-Chalk kind of Earth, sticking to the bottom of the Gouts, or passages, almost in all places where the Water passeth.</P>
<P>From what hath been said may be collected; That the Bathes of <HI>Bathe</HI> are impregnated with a certain acid saline Salt, and the Salt of the Bathe seems not much unlike Tartar vitriolated, or Aluminous Salt.</P>
<P>The Reason why these Salts destroy not one another, but each of them ferments with its con∣trary Salt; may be understood from what hath been delivered in the former Chapter: To wit; These Salts are so imperfect, that in Conjunction they cannot destroy one another. But more of these Salts, hereafter.</P>
<P>As to Nitre and Sulphur, with which the Bathes
<PB N="8" REF="21"/> have hitherto been thought to participate, I sup∣pose, That neither of them is dissolv'd in those Waters.</P>
<P>That there is no Nitre in the Waters appears by this, That the Salts that remain after the Eva∣poration of the Bathe-water, put on a Coal, burn not, as Nitre doth. Although I shall not deny, that those immature Salts of an Alkali nature, (which are also contained in the Sand, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">If that be meant by <HI>Fimus</HI> in the Au∣thor, to express which, <HI>Limus</HI> or <HI>Lutum</HI> had been more proper.</NOTE> Mud of the Bathe) being expos'd sometime to the air, may, perhaps, by its influence be converted into Nitre.</P>
<P>As to Sulphur, which hath been so much re∣ported to be in all Bathes, 'tis not, I believe, dissolved in these Waters. Because,</P>
<P>If a Solution of Alom, Vitriol, or any other Salt, whether acid, or fixt, be mixed with the Water of the Bathe, Sulphur discovers not it self to be precipitated, either by a fetid smell, or any other sign; which notwithstanding in the Soluti∣on of Sulphur in the water of unslak't Lime, or made into a Lixivium, doth appear, where the Sulphur by the affusion of any acid Liquor is precipitated.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that the Water of these Bathes, if Salt of Tartar, or a purely vola∣til Salt, be cast into it, will presently turn white, as is declared before; which colour proceeds not from Sulphur, but a stony, or Aluminous matter precipitated, not much unlike to what is observed in the Water of unslak't Lime, when any fixt Salt is mixed therewith; in which notwithstand∣ing it is not to be supposed the Sulphur is dissolv∣ed; for if Sulphur be boyled in Water of un∣slak't Lime, the Water becomes white, not by the affusion of a fixt Salt, as before, but of an
<PB N="9" REF="21"/> acid; so that fixt Salts may dissolve Sulphur, but not precipitate it. Wherefore if Sulphur be contained in the Waters of the Bathe, they would be precipitated, not by a purely saline, as former∣ly, but an acid Salt, and the Sulphur so precipi∣tated would discover it self by a fetid smell, which it doth not do.</P>
<P>To which I add, That an acid Salt, or some∣thing Aluminous, doth seem to predominate in the Bathes aforesaid, so that they become altoge∣ther unfit to dissolve the Sulphur.</P>
<P>Moreover, If Common Sulphur be boyled in those Waters, they are never tinged with a yellow or Sulphurous colour, neither can Sulphur, by any means, be precipitated from the decoction, as I have often experimented.</P>
<P>And therefore I much admire the famous <HI>Wil∣lis,</HI> in his Treatise of the heat of the Blood, should affirm, That Sulphur boyled in Bathe-wa∣ter may be dissolved after the same manner, as if boyled in Water of unslak't Lime.</P>
<P>Now if Sulphur seems to be dissolved in the Waters aforesaid, the occasion of the mistake, I suppose to be, That the decoction was made in a vessel, in which some fixt Salt had been decocted, so that the Solution of the Sulphur may be made by some particle of a fixt Salt, with which the vessel might be season'd.</P>
<P>Concerning the Baths of <HI>Bathe,</HI> 'Tis the com∣mon Opinion that Silver dipped into them is co∣loured yellow, in the same manner as if it were cast into a Solution of Sulphur, and hence it is supposed that the Baths have Sulphur in them; but experience evinceth the contrary; for Silver put into the Bath-water becomes not reddish, or yellow, but rather black.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="22"/>
<P>The mistake may seem to arise from this, That 'tis customary with the Bathe-Guids to tinge, and as it were guild over pieces of Silver with a Salino-Sulphurous Mud, or Dung, such as is often found in houses of Office, and put them off to Strangers, for a little profit, as if they were coloured with the Bathe-water.</P>
<P>And here this is to be noted, That a kind of Bituminous Mud, with a small pittance of Com∣mon Sulphur, is brought up with the Springs, which only swims on the top, or else continues at the bottom, but never is dissolved in the Waters themselves.</P>
<P>Neither is Sal Armoniack, as some imagine, to be found in these Waters; for if on the So∣lution of Sal Armoniack, Salt of Tartar be in∣jected, the purely saline volatil Salt (of which Sal Armoniack in part doth consist) being at li∣berty from the acid Salt, to which it was former∣ly united, will presently fly off into the air, and will quickly be discover'd by a pungent affecting the nostrils, which is never observ'd in the Bathe-waters.</P>
<P>Lastly; As to Vitriol, the Crosse and Hot Bathe seem to have none at all; for if Galls are beaten, and infused in these Waters, they nei∣ther turn purple nor black; which would cer∣tainly be, if these Waters had Vitriol in them.</P>
<P>The King's Bathe seems to have a little Vitriol in it; for if some beaten Galls are cast into that Water, it will have a light tincture of a black purple colour.</P>
<P>'Tis also to be noted, That a certain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Minera,</HI> for <HI>Mine∣rale,</HI> is corrupt∣ly, though Chymi∣cally, used here</NOTE> Mineral of a Metallick nature, ariseth out of the Earth, with the Springs of the Bathe, which is easily turn'd into Vitriol. For if any acid liquor be
<PB N="11" REF="22"/> affused on the Sand (which breaking out with the Springs, is found in the bottom of the Bathe) it being corroded with an acid Menstruum, not without a remarkable effervescence, will in part be converted into Vitriol, just as it happens to the filings of Iron corroded with an acid liquor.</P>
<P>For if that Sand of the Bathe corroded with an acid liquor, be put into the Infusion of Galls, the liquor acquires an atropurpureous colour. Whereas if the Infusion of Galls be put on the Sand newly taken out of the Bathe, and not cor∣roded with an acid liquor, it will, by no means, be of a purple colour; an apparent sign, that the Metallick Sand of the Bathe, unless corro∣ded with an acid Menstruum, doth not turn to Vitriol.</P>
<P>It is further observable; That the Sand of the Bathe kept some time, and exposed to the open air, will of its own accord, be converted into Vitriol; for if that Sand be mixed with the Infu∣sion of Galls, the Water will contract an atro∣purpureous appearance.</P>
<P>Moreover, If it be laid on the Tongue, it hath a perfect Vitriolick taste; and no wonder, for the Nitro-aereous Spirit, after some time, closeth with the Metallick Mineral, and Salino-Sulphureous Marchasite, of which Vitriol useth to be made, mixed in the Sand, and causeth it to ferment, and at last, as was shewed before, con∣verts it into Vitriol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> An Examination of some Particulars in the former Chapter.</HEAD>
<P>HOW far this Author hath ploughed with my Heifer, I leave to the consideration of those that have been any way acquainted with my design; and shall only here take notice, what Observations are agreeable with, or different from those I have often made with the greatest exactness, and repeat∣ed Trials, submitting all to the unbiast judgment of Indifferent persons.</P>
<P>And first of all, I concur with him, that the Baths of <HI>Bathe</HI> are in part impregnated with a certain Salt of an Acid nature; but why this acid Salt should be called <HI>Aluminous,</HI> I am not yet so fully resolv'd, as much on other accounts, so some∣what on this, That although an acid Spirit be in Alom, yet the most perceptible taste is either <HI>acerbe</HI> or <HI>austere;</HI> which being not observed in these Wa∣ters, I have so much reason to judge <HI>Alom</HI> not predominant, as asserted here.</P>
<P>The Experiment he mentions of precipitation or alteration of the Waters to a milky colour, or almond Milk, we owe to the Ingenuity of the In∣dustrious Mr. <HI>Stubbe,</HI> who, though he had not the good hap to discover what was precipitated, yet gives it the general name of an <HI>insipid Magistery,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pl. ult. red.</HI> To a Non∣pl. <HI>p.</HI> 135.</NOTE> and is nothing else but <HI>Freestone</HI> finely wrought, and intimately mixt with the body of the Wa∣ters.</P>
<P>If any blame me for calling it by so homely a name, I desire they would consider, that I had
<PB N="13" REF="23"/> rather call it so than a Metallick Mineral, or a <HI>Sali∣no-sulphureous Marchasite,</HI> supposing it more agreea∣ble to all their apprehensions that will be concern'd in things of this nature, and whom I would not have abused with hard names and uncouth ex∣pressions; the effect of Ostentation, or sanctuary of Ignorance.</P>
<P>That this is <HI>Freestone</HI> appears by this, that 'tis insipid, gritty, scowrs, leaves a white colour like Chalk on the fingers after it, and is inclinable to an union into a stony consistence.</P>
<P>That this is not <HI>Calx vive,</HI> or any <HI>lapis Calca∣rius</HI> that holds affinity with it, I am much induced to believe from this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Obs. <HI>83</HI></NOTE> That neither the Insipid ma∣gistery, nor the more gritty powder, being no∣thing different but in fineness and colour, will, either alone or together, open the body of Sul∣phur, which is usual with <HI>Calx vive,</HI> as I have fully experimented by decocting two parts of the powders with one of Sulphur in a proportionable quantity of Water, which gave the water very lit∣tle alteration, and as little was precipitated. To make it further evident, I calcin'd a large Cruci∣ble of it with as strong a fire as could well be given, yet nothing quick or limy did appear, but dead and gritty ashes, which, mixed with water, neither made it white, nor created any disturbance. But more of this in what will follow.</P>
<P>That the Bath-water will coagulate milk, I con∣fess, but not as any other acid liquor doth; for this doth it sooner upon affusion, and makes a hard curd; that with the Bath-water, must boyl again and that pretty smartly, else a soft white Curd, as commonly it is, will not appear.</P>
<P>I also agree with the forementioned Author in this, That there is a considerable quantity of
<PB N="14" REF="24"/> an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ʋnder this Notion, I take the liberty to understand Common Salt, or <HI>Sal Mari∣ne,</HI> conso∣nant to the proper no∣tation of the word: for the Salt of <HI>Kali</HI> or <HI>Glassewort</HI> is Marine, though used indifferently by the Chymists for the fixt Salt of any Vegetables, by Cal∣cination.</NOTE> <HI>Alkalizate</HI> Salt, mixed with some other Salt in the body of the waters, and apparently distin∣guishable by the taste, as well in a <HI>Lixivium</HI> made of the Contents of the waters, as in both the Courser part, the result of the Evaporation, and also the purer part, when made white and refin'd; and that this <HI>Alkali</HI> doth constitute good part of the Saline matter, with which the Baths are im∣pregnated.</P>
<P>For I am apt to believe, that great part of the acidity is breath'd off in evaporation, either in the Bath or over the fire, or both ways together, in re∣gard very little of that taste is perceptible in the Salt extracted, but the Saline is easily discover'd. To the confirmation of which the acting also of acids on it may somewhat conduce, and the expe∣rience of many this Summer, who according to my directions have dissolved the Salt in the Bath-water to improve it, and have sensibly found an in∣crease in the other taste, but little or nothing at all in acidity.</P>
<P>Neither doth the <HI>Lixivium,</HI> though made very strong, nor the <HI>Oleum per deliquium</HI> dropt 20, 30, or 40 drops into a small proportion of water, tinge with Galls either purple or black.</P>
<P>I may also urge as an Argument for the evapo∣ration of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> the abundance of a yellow <HI>Ochre</HI> which ascends with the steam of the Bath, and is there chiefly to be found where the steam of the Water meets with any resistance, as I have noted elsewhere, which probably may be the <HI>Terra Vi∣trioli:</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="24"/> And although 'tis not very easie to give the reason, why the <HI>Vitriol</HI> should not be as visible as the <HI>Ochre,</HI> or else make it more acid than we find it to be; yet if we conceive it to be in <HI>succo primiti∣vo, aut Solutis principiis,</HI> and there <HI>per halitum,</HI> and so <HI>per transitum</HI> too, it may better be conceived to go off, and not imbody as the other Salts do. Yet that all the Acidity is not breathed of, will appear from this, That the Bath-water cold will coagulate Milk. And what is more, the same water distill'd from a gallon to a pint, a fourth part of that pint will make a curd, when the distill'd water in the Receiver will do nothing at all: Which may pro∣bably proceed either from something Vitrioline, or rather from the acidity of Sulphur, in regard the Salt made white, in which is nothing wanting but the Sulphur, will not coagulate, as the water doth; whereas the browner Salt before calcination, dissol∣ved in Spring-water, will. So then, this <HI>Alkali</HI> is but one part of the fixt Salt, found in the bot∣tom of the Vessel after evaporation <HI>ad siccita∣tem.</HI></P>
<P>For a further confirmation that an <HI>Alkali</HI> is contained in the waters, which, considering the Quantity that may continually be made evident both to light and taste, will scarcely be judged to need other demonstration. Yet 'tis observable, that the Cross-Bath having lately been kept drawn four or five daies, the Saline matter not meeting with water sufficient for its dissolution, was driven up in substance from the Springs, and again reverberated by the ambient air, and incrustated on the tops of the stones that were above the water in the bottom of the Bath, which gave me some divertisement to behold, and, on examination, appeared much <HI>alkalizate</HI> both by taste and ignition; some pun∣gency
<PB N="16" REF="25"/> also I observ'd in it, which I rather judg'd to proceed from the acrimony of <HI>Nitre</HI> than <HI>Tartar,</HI> but the predominant taste was clearly <HI>alkalisate,</HI> which after the Nitrous parts were wasted, was less exceptionable in the remaining calx on the I∣ron after burning, in which the Alkalisate taste was most remarkable; not to mention its crepitation, and that some pungency also is observed in an <HI>Al∣kali</HI> it self.</P>
<P>To make it further evident that this accretion did probably arise from the <HI>Minera,</HI> I believe, not far distant, and was not engendred or contracted from some floating particles in the air derived elsewhere, and there settling by way of Magnetism, as some may imagine; 'tis further remarkable, That nei∣ther the stones under water, nor, what is more ma∣terial, any stone either of the Seats, or in the sides of the bottom of the Bath, remote from the water, had any Salt affixed to them, but only those, as I may so term it, that peeped out of the water, the tops of which only, as I said before, were incru∣stated. So that had a Magnetism any place here, the Salino-Nitrous particles must, I conceive, have lighted as well on the stones of the same nature hard by, as where they were, the reason of the thing being much the same. For a fuller Testimo∣ny of this, <HI>See Obs.</HI> 88.</P>
<P>I acknowledge also this, That a great Fermen∣tation is produc'd by the affusion of Acids on the Sand and Mud of the Bath, (but do not tell you who first observ'd it) and a much less on the Scum; yet I must be excus'd in this, if I say, That I cannot conceive how this should arise from the action of Acids on a Saline matter, in regard it transcends my understanding to apprehend, how any Salt can possibly lie at the bottom of the Bath,
<PB N="17" REF="25"/> either in the Sand or Mud, undissolved, and the waters no higher impregnated than we find they are.</P>
<P>'Tis a trivial Observation, that what is dissolva∣ble in any liquor, the pores of it will receive till it can hold no more; neither can I be yet perswaded, that there are just so many porosities in the Bath-water assigned for <HI>Vitriol,</HI> and the rest taken up with other Bodies, seeing the dissolution of <HI>Vitriol</HI> in the Bath-water afterwards, and the alteration in taste that happens thereupon, is sufficient to give me satisfaction to the contrary.</P>
<P>But to speak a little more to this, because the Author insists so much upon it; If any <HI>Vitriol</HI> be contained in the Sand, 'tis no absurdity to conceive that warm water may dissolve it and fetch it out; now, if half a pint of warm water be poured on an ounce of Sand, with what agitation you shall think convenient, and thus let stand infused ten or twelve hours, the water then decanted, and the sand dried and weighed again, there will be little wanting in the weight, abating for the <HI>Ochre,</HI> which ariseth first to the top, through the body of the wa∣ter, much like white <HI>Vitriol,</HI> afterwards precipitates and settles at the bottom on the Sand, and is hardly preserved in the decantation.</P>
<P>The Ebullition therefore, on the affusion of acid liquors on the Sand, I conceive doth arise from somewhat not Saline (if Taste be the judge) of which I shall treat more at large by and by: So that the Sand and Salt are no further of the same nature, than as fermentation may arise upon different Commixtures. How this may be reconcil'd to the Experiment I sometime made, of making Ink with Bath-water and Galls, and the Sand of the Bath, with other things which might have been
<PB N="18" REF="26"/> no small encouragement to this opinion, I shall have occasion in part to declare hereafter, but more when I find my Answer is required.</P>
<P>As to the Salt, or rather, to use the new-made word, <HI>Calcineous</HI> kind of Earth, sticking to the bottom of the Gouts and passages, almost in all places where the water passeth, I was never yet so happy, though I have searched particularly to find any such thing. I confess I have heard it spoken, that five years ago, or thereabouts, there was a Gout out of order at the Cross-Bath, in the recti∣fying of which there was observed some such matter adhering to the Passage; but this, I sup∣pose, was as much above the Civilian's knowledge, as the Physicians, and whether a bare Tradition with some other uncertainties, to say no worse, be a sufficient foundation for this Hypothesis; <HI>That the Salt of the Bath doth much resemble a Vitrio∣lated Tartar, or Aluminous Salt,</HI> I shall leave those to determine that know the meaning of this ap∣proved Sentence, <HI>Nullum simile est idem.</HI> And seeing that the Author chooses to call this adherent matter by the name of a <HI>Chalky kind of substance</HI> rather than a <HI>Salt,</HI> I think I may not be much mistaken if I imagine it to be <HI>Freestone;</HI> concerning which I can say no more, till I shall happily meet with the like accretion.</P>
<P>That the Fermentation on the affusion of Acids on the Sand, ariseth chiefly from the acting of that liquor on <HI>Freestone</HI> in conjunction with some Te∣staceous particles, and not from any other Saline matter, seems evident from this; That whereas these parts with a blew Clay or Marle, Rubrica, Ochre, and Chrystal-pebbles, are clearly distin∣guishable by a Magnifying-glass in the Sand, when the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> liquor hath done its worst, and the dif∣ference
<PB N="19" REF="26"/> between the Sand and it, is amicably com∣pos'd, the remaining particles of Sand that will not ferment, are only some part of the Marle and Chrystals; And this I call <HI>Arena castrata,</HI> be∣cause, by this means, the Sand loses its fermenting vigour, though the stones do remain.</P>
<P>And whereas the Mud of the Bath, which seems chiefly to consist of this blew Clay or Marle, with something Sulphurous, will do the like; the Fermentation I conceive doth arise not so much, though something I confess, from the Earth it self, as the Testaceous particles with which it a∣bounds, in which Earth nothing Saline can be discovered to which the ebullition may make any pretence.</P>
<P>To this may be added; That the colour of the Acid liquor, after Saturation by the Sand, is altogether the same with what ariseth from the <HI>Freestone,</HI> both equally resembling the infusion of the filings of Steel; so that in this also there is an agreement.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of <HI>Nitre</HI> in the Bath-Water.</HEAD>
<P>THat <HI>Nitre</HI> is contained in the Body of the Waters is evident from this, that it may, by art, be extracted thence; and I may as well sus∣pect, and, if I please, believe, that I had not mo∣ny in my pocket, when I took out some silver for a necessary use; as when I see <HI>Nitre</HI> taken out of the Bath, say it was never there.</P>
<P>But the difficulty will be to prove the thing; now, I say, a <HI>Sceptick</HI> may doubt whether a Man be a Man, a Brute a Brute, or whether he makes use of his voice that asks the Question; but whe∣ther he be not the wiser man that takes these for granted, and not pragmatically contradicts the u∣nanimous consent of Judicious Writers, is easie to determine.</P>
<P>I confess it burns not as Common <HI>Salt-Peter</HI> doth, because it leaves a Calx behind it; but in that more resembles the <HI>Nitre</HI> of the Ancients, a pound of which being burnt will leave four ounces of Ashes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jord. <HI>Nat. Bath. &amp; Min. Wat.</HI> chap. 7. p. 53.</NOTE> <HI>Salt-Peter</HI> will leave none.</P>
<P>Neither doth it huff, nor melt altogether in a small quantity as <HI>Salt-Peter</HI> doth, on the account of an allay it receives from the mixture of ano∣ther Salt of an <HI>Alkalisate</HI> taste with some bitter∣ness withal, which remains on the Iron-plate after accension, and is little more than a fourth part of the Body; wherefore to deny the being of <HI>Nitre</HI> in the Salt, because 'tis not all so, is as absurd, to make a Linsey-woolsey Comparison, as to affirm, there is no Woollen in that sort of Vesture where
<PB N="21" REF="27"/> Linnen is; or to say, That a man that is both Lawyer and Physician, hath nothing of Physick, because he hath something of Law.</P>
<P>But that <HI>Nitre</HI> is there, though not predominant, seems clear by the shooting in <HI>stiria's,</HI> which is concluded to be the proper form of that Salt; and although <HI>Tartar,</HI> and perhaps some other Salts, may somewhat resemble it; yet the diffe∣rence is easily perceptible by the sight, but more by the taste.</P>
<P>And now I am discoursing of this matter, I conceive the Author did not hit the mark, because he did not make the Bath-water shoot, in that he only mentions, <HI>the Salts that remain after evapora∣tion, which,</HI> he says, <HI>put on a Coal, burn not as Nitre doth.</HI> But the shootings so called, in a fi∣gure somewhat pyramidal, with many <HI>Columellae,</HI> or small pillars closely united, put on a red-hot Iron-plate, and so burnt, may alter the case, which I affirm to do, as I mention'd before.</P>
<P>And, what is not a little considerable, on the burning of six ounces of the Chrystals, in order to the Examination of the remaining Calx, the Nitrous parts of the shoots, being many in number, in a short time melted, and ran down both sides of the Iron-plate in a stream, consonant to <HI>Pliny</HI>'s ob∣servation of <HI>Nitre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">(Q)</NOTE> which he affirms <HI>ingentibus ri∣vulis profluxisse.</HI></P>
<P>To which I may add the bitter Taste apparent∣ly discoverable in the Salt, insomuch as to bring it within the verge of a suspicious appearance of a <HI>Sal amarum</HI> (if any such Salt there be distinct from <HI>Nitre</HI>) which bitterness hath been accounted pro∣per to <HI>Nitre,</HI> and the waters impregnated there∣with,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Therin.</HI> l. 5. c. 5.</NOTE> of which the Laborious <HI>Ballius</HI> gives this Testimony; <HI>Differunt etiam Nitrosae Aquae à Salsiae,
<PB N="22" REF="28"/> quòd amarorem Nitrosae sapiunt potius quam Salsu∣ginem, &amp; quo magis syncerum habent Nitrum eo sunt amariores.</HI> So that the bitter Calx mention∣ed before, seems, if any, to be the true Calx of <HI>Ni∣tre,</HI> and no small argument of its sincerity, although this taste be not perceptible in the water, in regard the <HI>Nitre</HI> is much diluted, and though sufficient for the purpose, not in so great a proportion there.</P>
<P>Also for a further satisfaction, if any Aluminous parts were contained in the Chrystal shoots, I ob∣serv'd, That the six ounces mentioned before, after they had hufft, melted and ran upon the Iron-plate, were in little more than one minute reduced to somewhat less than two ounces of a dead white <HI>Calx;</HI> which being again dissolved, filtred and e∣vaporated, gave me a plain <HI>Alkali</HI> with some re∣maining bitterness, which on the affusion of any acid would ferment, and being put to undergo the <HI>fire-ordeal</HI> Trial, would neither melt nor boyl, but crackle and leap.</P>
<P>To make a further Trial, whether what was bitter and suspiciously Nitrous might be separated from the <HI>Alkali;</HI> I dissolved and filtred the same Salt again, and evaporating it <HI>ad Cuticulam,</HI> it shot pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly into a white hoary down, penetrating cooling, and bitter, distinct from the <HI>Alkali</HI> with which before it was mixt, and partly into an in∣spissated juyce, which I judge to be the <HI>succus primitivus</HI> of <HI>Nitre,</HI> with the same qualities; both which put on the Plate did huff and melt as the former, leaving a small bitter Calx behind it, which, I believe, by frequent dissolutions, evaporations, and coagulations, would huff and melt all off, to the utter consumption of its whole body that way, I mean as far as Nitrous, the <HI>Alkali</HI> shewing
<PB N="23" REF="28"/> it self proportionable in the Calx, after every trial.</P>
<P>And here I would not be mistaken, as if I pre∣tended to that grand <HI>Arcanum,</HI> the discovery of the Nitre of the Ancients, for I am well assured, that the description of that is very much different from what I am now discoursing of, being acknowledged by <HI>Pliny, Dioscorides,</HI> and others, to be of a rosie colour, and almost purple, which they used some∣times to dye that colour with (though some white there was also) and came nearer to the nature of or∣dinary Salt, whereupon <HI>Dioscorides</HI> in his 85th. Chapter hath these words, <HI>Nitre, and the froth of Nitre</HI> (or <HI>Aphronitrum) have the same virtues as Salt, and are burn't like that;</HI> yet because some measures may be taken from that, for the better un∣derstanding of what is now under the test, I thought fit in that regard at present, only to make this bare mention of it.</P>
<P>Neither can the contrary, I think, be evinced from the effects; for cooling, penetrating, and purg∣ing, are attributed to Nitre, and confessedly in the waters, the two former evident in allaying thirst, abating inflammations, and quickness of passage: the latter, as plain in its operation, for Nitre as well as Salt, is said both <HI>alvum laxare,</HI> and <HI>urinas ciere,</HI> and <HI>Baccius</HI> treating of nitrous waters, af∣firms, that they do <HI>vacuare, virtute Nitri, per al∣vum, &amp; per urinas.</HI> The like may be said of the external effects by Bathing, which can no way pre∣judice the being of Nitre there.</P>
<P>Besides, This way of arguing from the effects is but <HI>à posteriori,</HI> and less significant where there is matter of fact, which may be useful in the dark; but if it thwart with a plain experiment, must yield; for, <HI>Quid verba audiam, cum videam facta?</HI> And
<PB N="24" REF="29"/> whoever shall undertake a business of this nature may consider, that the best judgment to be made of the effects, is from a constant observation of particu∣lars on the place, which cannot be conceived to be so well done at a distance, but must require, besides some time, a good attendance, as well as practice here. But to return.</P>
<P>These <HI>Stiriae,</HI> or Needles, I observed in the wa∣ter of all the Baths, yet in a different shape and consistence; for the King's Bath-water after a full imbibition of the Salt dissolved, and a strong Lixi∣vium thence procured, evaporated <HI>ad Cuticulam,</HI> and set in a cool place, shot from the inside of the evaporating Glass into its Cavity, into strong, and compacted Needles, with that strength, that it took some of the Common Salt with it, which ap∣peared in the Nitrous shoots, something like the stars in a clear sky, but white, and in a Cubical form, in perfect squares, or Tessera's distinct from the body of the Nitrous shoots, with which the Nitre was studded, being impacted into it.</P>
<P>The Cross Bath shot in smaller Needles, but long∣er and very thin, in great number, directly from the bottom of the glass, very close together, but distinct each from other, much like the Finnow, or hairy excrescence, that oftentimes ariseth from cor∣rupted matter, which on the least violence offer'd would break, and not endure any kind of resist∣ance.</P>
<P>The Hot Bath gave me more trouble to bring it to shoot, insomuch as being frustrated in two or three Experiments, I had almost concluded there was nothing Nitrous there, but the thing after∣wards succeeding, I had on a small quantity of the Salt dissolved, and the Lixivium evaporated ac∣cording to Art, five, or six single Stiria's, bigger,

Since which time on another Experiment, I had as firm and com∣pacted Needles from the Hot Bath, as I had formerly from the King's, both which Baths shoot much alike, and different from the Cross.</P>
<P>I shall not lay any great stress on these observati∣ons, in relation to the difference between the three Baths mentioned before, in regard it must be a bu∣siness of greater experience, and more exact obser∣vation of many Circumstances, to state that affair as it ought to be, and is, in good part done in the Miscellaneous Observations hereunto annex'd; only this use I may safely make of them, to confirm what I had before asserted, That there is Nitre dis∣solved in the Water of all the Baths of <HI>Bathe.</HI> And if this be not the thing that hath hitherto been de∣scribed under that name, by the most approved Writers, I presume we may afterwards take it for a Chimerical notion, that hath no foundation in any work of Nature, but owes its subsistence to a phantastical brain.</P>
<P>To this may be further added; That the <HI>Liqua∣men,</HI> or <HI>oleum per deliquium,</HI> being closely stopt, and but heated by the fire, presently, as soon as cold, concretes into a Nitrous form; so that we need not call in the secret, and invisible assistance of the external air, to make a Metamorphosis almost as strange as those mentioned by the Poet, when we have clear, and unalterable principles of Nature, and innate propensities, and disposition in matter it self, with a divine impression, that will serve the turn.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
<P>In the rear of these Philosophical Arguments, I shall offer one (supernumerary) Grammatical, which is this; That the Salt I call Nitrous, either in the Sun, or by Candle-light, shines and sparkles very much, consonant to the Notation of the word <HI>Nitrum,</HI> which probably, may not be so much a Grecian, as the great Etymologist would have it, and derived <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from its scouring, and absterging nature; as a Latinist, and so called <HI>à Ni∣tendo;</HI> because it gives a greater lustre than any other Salt doth.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of Sulphur in the Bath water.</HEAD>
<P>AS to Sulphur, the next thing to be insisted on, as contained in the Waters, I conceive that many that have endeavoured to avoid <HI>Charybdis,</HI> have fallen into <HI>Scylla,</HI> and because the ancient Au∣thors have asserted that Sulphur was undoubtedly concern'd in all Baths, they will affirm there is none in any; but whoever builds a fabrick on this foundation, and certainly concludes, that Sulphur is not in the Bath-waters, because it cannot be disco∣ver'd by precipitation, I would have forbear a posi∣tive determination on a negative experiment, till I see Vitriol precipitated in substance from the King's Bath-water, which is acknowledg'd to be there. And if I cannot light on an apt precipitater, which every way opposeth the particles to be so discover'd, and have some other reasons to incline me to the contrary, I should not be so fond of my own con∣ceit,
<PB N="27" REF="31"/> as to be prevail'd upon by a comparative in∣stance of unslak't Lime, to wipe my own Nose, and put out my Eyes, which as far as they can, assure me to the contrary.</P>
<P>I shall refer the Reader to what is mention'd be∣fore concerning the Colour and Smell, in calcining the Contents of the Bath-water in general, and till I shall meet with something that will both burn blew, and give a fetid smell, that is not Sulphur, I shall so esteem that, till ascertain'd of the con∣trary.</P>
<P>I may further add, That the Sulphur is proba∣bly incorporated with the Salt, as appears by its passing with it into the Lixivium, and through pa∣pers in filtration, and not discoverable but by a strong fire, by which the body of the Salt is open'd, and a solution of the Continuum made, in order to fusion; so that if you do not precipitate both, you can precipitate neither, unless a separation of the Sulphur from the Salt be made, which, I presume, is not easie to be done, without the help of fire, by which the Sulphur is consum'd: so that the com∣parative instance of unslak't Lime is little to the pur∣pose; where the Sulphur is separated, decocted, and precipitated; here not so, being not apart, but residing in a Saline-Sulphureous Salt, a piece of whose Body, as we now have it, it seems to be.</P>
<P>Moreover, Whereas he collects from the Bath-waters not ringing Silver yellow, but rather black, that there is no Sulphur contained in the same; I may retort, and that very justly, this as an argu∣ment to assert it. For the proper colour that Sul∣phur dissolved gives to Silver is not so much yellow as black, as may be e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sily discerned by putting any piece of Silver, but a very little while, into the de∣coction
<PB N="28" REF="32"/> of Sulphur made in the water of unslak't Lime, which gives as near the colour of the Silver I have caused to lye some time near the Springs of the Bath, as may be, so that the difference is not discernable; not to mention that some yellowness is observed on the Silver tinged by the Bath.</P>
<P>Neither am I fully satisfied that the only, or in∣deed the best, precipitator of Sulphur is an acid; for on the decoction of that Mineral in the water of quick Lime (the Lixivium, though with much Sulphur, not succeeding) and very sudden change, on the affusion of Spirit of Vitriol, into a milky, and much whiter Consistence, the Liquor after∣wards settled, and precipitated not as Sulphur, but Lime-stone; so that the Sulphur, although it gave a greater fetid smell, yet was not so apparently pre∣cipitated, as by Oyl of Tartar in another glass, which gave the Sulphur in proper colour precipita∣ted, without a permanent lacteous opacity. Where∣upon I made this observation, as to the present ex∣periment, That although acids do not precipitate of this lapideous matter alone, yet if in the embraces a strong sulphurous commixture, they will, and the Lime-stone is most properly precipitated by an acid, if Sulphur be decocted with it; whereas the Body of Sulphur, decocted as before, is best precipitated by a fixt Salt, the Sulphur appearing without white∣ness, in its own garb, though not so fetid as on the affusion of an acid.</P>
<P>It may be also noted that <HI>S. Closseus,</HI> in his pre∣paration of <HI>Lac Sulphuris,</HI> in which the body of Sulphur is open'd with <HI>Calx Vive,</HI> directs the Sul∣phur to be precipitated with Urine.</P>
<P>The occasion of this mistake (seeing he pretends to give the reason of another, concerning an expe∣riment of a like nature) I conceive to be, That
<PB N="29" REF="32"/> the white matter precipitated on the affusion of any acid, was, without much examination, reputed wholly sulphurous, as appears from these words; <HI>For if Sulphur be boyled in the water of unslak't Lime, the water becomes white, not by the affusion of a fixt Salt, as before, but of an acid: so that fixt Salts may dissolve Sulphur but not precipitate it.</HI> Where∣as the whiteness ariseth much from the mixture of the Lime-stone, as appears by the open confession of what is precipitated, if standing some time, fil∣ter'd, and brought to the test by fire, where the Lime-stone is discover'd, the Sulphur being rather disturb'd than precipitated by the acid liquor, which makes it give a greater fetor, but never kindly pre∣cipitates; the other precipitation with oyl of Tar∣tar, which here, contrary to its wonted course, joyns with the Lime-stone, which it usually preci∣pitates, and opposeth the Sulphur, is very apparent, and sulphurous beyond contradiction.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant, that in the preparation of <HI>Lac Sulphuris</HI> mentioned before, Sulphur also is precipitated by an acid, but <HI>that fixt Salts should dissolve Sulphur, but not precipitate it,</HI> is what I said I was not so fully satisfied in. Not to mention that the matter precipitated by a fixt Salt is white on the first affusion, though the whiteness be not so permanent, the Sulphur in a short time precipita∣ting in proper colour.</P>
<P>Besides, If Sulphur be boyled in the Bath-wa∣ter, and doth not tinge it with a yellow colour, I presume, it cannot thence be argu'd that there is no Brimstone there, for the colour of the water in which Sulphur is dissolved, is not so much yellow as Lixiviate, or reddish; and therefore <HI>Schroder</HI> gives this direction for the making that preparation of Sulphur mentioned before, that after the Sul∣phur
<PB N="30" REF="33"/> and Tartar are mixed, they ought to boyl, <HI>donec fere omne Sulphur solutum sit, liquor{que} rubeus appareat;</HI> though some addition I confess it may have from the Tartar. Yet <HI>Closseus,</HI> in his way of making that preparation where there is no Salt of Tartar, but, instead of that quick-Lime, which gives no such tincture of it self, hath this Note; <HI>Coque, donec partes tres aquae sint consumptae, ruborem∣que contraxerit instar sanguinis, ex Sulphure disso∣luto.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore think it no ill advice here, that they that are so much concern'd to give the reason of the mistakes of others, would a little mind to rectifie their own, and not be an <HI>Argus</HI> abroad, but a Mole at home.</P>
<P>I do also acknowledg, that I believe that the white Magistery or in-palpable Powder, precipita∣ted from the Bath-water on the affusion of Salt of Tartar, or any other analogous, or agreeable Salt, is not Sulphurous, much less Aluminous; but ra∣ther Stony, of a lapideous substance, the result of an intimate Commixture, with the body of the Wa∣ters, which may have no small influence on their fer∣mentation, as may hereafter be more fully consi∣der'd.</P>
<P>And as to what reflects on that famous Practitio∣ner, the Ingenious and Learned Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> I shall, at present, say no more than this, That ob∣serving one so pedantickly drest up in his own clothes, he ought not to be affrighted with his own shape; only this may be further noted, That where∣as Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> had desired of me the exacter trial of that Experiment of decocting Sulphur and An∣timony in the Bath-water, I well remember I re∣turn'd him something of both that was precipita∣ted after a double filtration, and the decoction per∣formed
<PB N="31" REF="33"/> in a Vessel altogether free from the season of any fixt Salt.</P>
<P>Yet I must acknowledg, that what was precipi∣tated was very inconsiderable to what was decoct∣ed, and not so much as to make much alteration in the colour of the water; which may deserve their consideration wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affirm, a Lime-Chalk Stone, or <HI>Lapis calcarius,</HI> to be contained in the Waters, and yet deny them to dissolve Sulphur, and again affirm, that Sulphur is dissolved in the water of Lime.</P>
<P>The same alteration of the water into a turbid milky appearance, and the precipitation by oyl of Tartar, of an insipid powder, mentioned before, was also observed in the Spaw at <HI>Scarborough,</HI> and Sulphur-Well at <HI>Knaresbrough,</HI> by <HI>William Simpson</HI> Doctor in Physick, as appears from several places in his <HI>Hydrologia Chymica,</HI> and Hydrological Essays, which he there asserts to be Aluminous, and page 118. of the latter Treatise saith; <HI>By the addition of Oyl of Tartar this Sulphur-water turns white, and that because it is impregnated with a small quantity of a Simple natural Alom Salt.</HI> How far Alom is concerned in that water, I shall not here dispute, but leave it to the Learned Dr. <HI>Wittie,</HI> whose con∣cern it is: only thus much I can say, that the like <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> appearing in these waters, what is thus precipitated here is not Aluminous, as hath been acknowledged by many eminent Physitians, who have seen some quantity of the precipitated powder; and was particularly noted by the ever Honoured Sir <HI>Charles Scarbrough,</HI> this Summer, here.</P>
<P>But to prevent any mis-understanding, I must acknowledg that this assertion stands on this founda∣tion, That the white powder precipitated by oyl of Tartar from the Waters, is the same with the finer
<PB N="32" REF="34"/> sort of what I had, in greater quantities precipita∣ted spontaneously <HI>per decubitum,</HI> on the evaporati∣on of many Hogsheads of the Water, and is now to be seen, though not altogether so white nor fine, having undergone many alterations, which being decocted in Spring-water, the water filter'd will precipitate with oyl of Tartar, as the Bath-water doth; yet if any one shall think fit to deem this Saline, and perhaps, Aluminous; he ought to con∣sider, how any Salt can so soon be devested of the essential property of what is saline, as to be rendred perfectly insipid, when saline at first: though I do not absolutely deny, but that we may attribute, though somewhat Catachrestically, the name of Salt, to something not saline, communicating with it in some other of its properties.</P>
<P>I know very well that Alom dissolved in Spring-water, the Water filter'd and the Salt precipitated with oyl of Tartar, will be impaired much in its saline taste; yet so much of the sowrness, and stip∣ticity will remain, as will be sufficient to discover its nature.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of Vitriol in the Bath-water.</HEAD>
<P>TO pass by the Reason of the Common Arti∣fice of tinging Silver at the Bath, what con∣cerns the Scum, and Sal Armoniack, as of no great moment; Vitriol is, by Him, denied to be in the Cross and Hot Bath, because Galls beaten and in∣fused in these Waters, will never turn them purple nor black, which is confessed would certainly be, if these Waters had Vitriol in them.</P>
<P>How true this is, a slight Experiment will soon evince, and if the Author had ever made trial, his Galls or Sight, must be worse than mine, if a pur∣ple colour did not appear.</P>
<P>To which may be added the Experience and Te∣stimony of my Honoured and Learned Friends Sir <HI>Edward Greaves,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Nat. Highmore,</HI> who have both made trial, and found the Waters turn. With the former of whom I lately further observ'd, that when we had been sufficiently satisfied in the turn∣ing colour of the Hot Bath Pump-water, with less than half a pint of Water and but two grains of Galls, and had thrown away the Water and Galls, in order to the trial of something else, more of the same Water, though much cooler than when brought at first, being powred into the same glass, turn'd colour also, receiving a brisk light purple, from the remaining particles of the former infusion about the glass, though nothing of the Galls did appear at all.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
<P>'Tis also confirm'd by this, That whereas the Leaves of Oak make little or no alteration in the Water of the King's Bath, the Chips, or inner Bark of the same make rather a better purple in the Water of all the Baths, than the Galls; only the King's Bath tingeth deeper than the other two, as in all Experiments of this nature, it appears to do. The like also will happen on the Seeds of Sumach contus'd and infus'd, but with Pomegranate Flow∣ers most apparently, so that the Water of any of the Baths affused hot on that, will presently turn purple; though the colour doth not keep so long in strength, as that which ariseth from the Oaken Chips.</P>
<P>These things consider'd, I conceive it no injury to the King's Bath to allow it a little Vitriol, though manifestly derogatory to the other two to deny it, since they make their claim by the same evi∣dence, and that Judg will hardly free himself from the censure of injustice and partiality, that will not hear a poor mans Tale, but suffers an honest Cause that hath weak lungs and a weaker purse to be lost, on the louder clamours of more importunate addresses.</P>
<P>The truth of this Experiment being thus far call'd in question, I am the more afraid of the cer∣tainty of some others; for I remember an old Story of Mr. <HI>Thief</HI> in the University, that was wont to be very busie in some Booksellers Shops, and entred in the Shop-Book under that name, whoever there∣fore was taken in the fact but one time, was oblig'd to quit the whole score, on this account, That he that was really convicted once, might commit the same thing five, ten, or twenty times before, and therefore he the man from whom all was re∣quir'd.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
<P>The Metallick Mineral, so called, hath nothing Metallick contained in it; and if this be so easily, by the air, converted into Vitriol, 'tis very strange we have not yet had any Houses of Vitriol, which surely have endur'd the air long enough to experi∣ence a Transmutation.</P>
<P>As for the Sand breaking out with the Springs in which Vitriol is supposed to lye undissolv'd, as was mentioned before, if there were no better ar∣guments for Vitriol than this, I shall not stick to say, that he that depends on this, builds at best but on a sandy foundation.</P>
<P>That the purple colour appearing from the mix∣ture of the Sand of the Bath, with the infusion of Galls, may not arise from the tincture of Vitriol, seems more than probable by this Experiment. I have formerly declared, that the Sand of the Bath may be so far corroded with an acid Menstruum, as not to ferment any longer, but lye quiet in the bot∣tom of the glass without any motion at all; now, this Sand on the affusion of Common Water gave an excellent purple, when 'tis not likely that any thing saline should remain, after so many washings and re∣affusions, as are requisite to reduce the Sand to that condition. Moreover 'tis considerable, the infusion was not acid, nor any way alter'd from its common tast. But this Experiment I made but once, and had not an opportunity of repeating it again.</P>
<P>'Tis likewise more observable, That after some hours standing, a purple floccous matter did sponta∣neously precipitate, upon which there being a clear separation, the Water return'd to its pristine colour, and the floccous matter subsided in the bottom of the glass, which being filter'd <HI>per Chartam,</HI> and exa∣min'd, was perfectly insipid, and not at all Vitrio∣line.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
<P>Besides, On the Calcination of half a pound of the Sand, when the Crucible was as red and the Sand as hot as usually it is when the Salts do run, the Sand powred out glowing hot, nothing saline was observ'd to concrete among it, which it would certainly do, if any fusible Salt were there, as in other Calcinations it appears to do.</P>
<P>I therefore rather judg it to proceed from an in∣sipid but astringent Ochre, such as is mentioned by <HI>Fallopius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Met. &amp; Foss. c. <HI>35.</HI> de Ochra.</NOTE> which lying some time in the open air, becomes more sowr than when taken out of the Bath, which may occasion the difference between the Sand newly taken, and that which is kept some time; the Ochre it self infus'd making the liquor much blacker after some standing, as is more fully declared in the following Chapter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Containing a farther Proof and Illustration of the former particulars.</HEAD>
<P>TO make this a little clearer; 'Tis an easie Ex∣periment to powr warm water on the Sand, in what proportion you please, which if kept some time will alter the water in which it is infus'd, into a yellowish or amber colour: when the water is impregnated very well, mix some of this with the infusion of Galls, and presently an atropurpureous colour will appear, in which if you infuse white paper but a very little while, you will quickly be satisfied what colour it will tinge. Now, if this infusion be permitted to cool, the Ochre will preci∣pitate, leaving the water somewhat yellower than in it self it is, to which it also communicates a harsh tast, and at last settles on the top of the Sand, from which it may be separated by decantation. The contrary happens to the Sand newly taken, in which the Ochre clogg'd with too much moisture cannot shew it self, as when older, and more dry. So that I see no reason or necessity, from this <HI>Phaeno∣menon,</HI> to assert the existence of Vitriol in the Sand of the Bath, otherwise than as it hath relation to this astringent Ochre, which I do believe receives this tinging property by the impression of Vitriol, this being in all probability, as is noted elsewhere, the <HI>Terra Vitrioli,</HI> or Earth, in which the Vitriol is contain'd before exhalation; as I conceive, the Marl or Mud is the bed of Sulphur, or the <HI>Terra,</HI> to which that Mineral doth more nearly ad∣here.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
<P>And that 'tis this yellow matter that occasions the alteration, may be further evident from this; That after the first decanting, if the Ochre be powred all off, and warm water affused on the Sand again, and that infusion mixed with the infu∣sion of Galls, no change of colour will ensue. To which may be added, that the Ochre it self kept some time, and infused in the decoction of Galls, will, after lying a pretty while, turn that Liquor into a much blacker appearance.</P>
<P>I shall end this dispute with the observation of one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. <HI>Simpson</HI></NOTE> who affirms, That Artificial Alom will not with Galls strike a purple colour, but the Natural Alom with its inbred Ochre, will; ascribing more to the Ochre than the Alom. So that this may be the end of that Controversie about Alom and Galls tinging Water purple, That Alom, as Alom, doth not tinge, but as in conjunction with this inbred Ochre, or as Vitrioline; for between Vitriol and Alom there are many resemblances, and a worthy Author hath observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jord. <HI>Nat. Bath.</HI> chap. 7. p. 52.</NOTE> that the Basis of Vitriol is Alom, both these being much alike, but that Vitri∣ol hath a garb from Copper or Iron, which in the Ochre gives the tinging quality, the Alom, as di∣stinct from Vitriol, contributing nothing at all.</P>
<P>If any shall affirm this Ochre to be Vitrioline, I have not deny'd it, having formerly supposed it might be <HI>Terra Vitrioli;</HI> but what I here question is, whether any Vitrioline saline body, different from the Ochre, be contained in the Sand, or can lye undissolved there.</P>
<P>'Tis very remarkable what is said, That if the Sand of the Bath, impregnated with an acid Li∣quor, be put into the infusion of Galls, the Liquor acquires an atropurpureous colour; and no wonder, since the acid Liquor may do much alone, as may
<PB N="39" REF="37"/> be seen in the mixture of Vinegar, with the deco∣ction or infusion of Galls, which supplying in some measure the place of Vitriol, by a kind of analogy inclines the infusion to an inky complexion.</P>
<P>And as for the Metallick Mineral contained in the Sand, which on the affusion and corrosion of an acid Menstruum, will in part be converted into Vi∣triol, I have said before that 'tis nothing else but a Common Freestone, a Mineral, I confess, but how far Metallick, I leave to the judgment of the men of that Art.</P>
<P>For a partial satisfaction in this thing; if the sharpest Vinegar be powred on the Sand in one glass, and on Freestone in another, the same fermentation will appear for the present, and the same blewish colour of the infusion afterwards upon Corrosion; so that it much resembles the colour and smell of the saturated Liquor, on the affusion of Vinegar on the filings of Iron. But whether this be a suffici∣ent argument to dub it Metallick, I shall be better satisfied, when I am convinced of this, That Truth hath never suffer'd by meer Resemblances.</P>
<P>But that it may appear that I desire to proceed in this Affair with all ingenuity and freedom from animosity, unless what will seem necessary to disco∣ver truth; I shall here recite a Passage out of Dr. <HI>Wittie</HI>'s Answer to <HI>Hydrologia Chymica,</HI> leaving how far it may be applicable to the saline Stiria's mentioned before, to the judicious Reader and further observation.</P>
<P>The Candid Doctor, <HI>pag.</HI> 63. among other Pre∣parations out of the Minerals of the Spaw at <HI>Scar∣brough,</HI> made by Mr. <HI>Sam. Johnston,</HI> a Physician at <HI>Beverly,</HI> and by him communicated to the Doctor, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes mention of <HI>an Essential Salt, which Mr.</HI> Johnston <HI>calls</HI> Anomalous, <HI>or</HI> sui generis, <HI>as differ∣ing
<PB N="40" REF="38"/> much from the factitious or natural kinds of Alom, Vitriol, or Nitre, though in some properties it agree with each of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Reason of this Scruple, he adds, is this, which</HI> Paracelsus <HI>hath clearly made out, That here they are not corporally, but</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I suppose, the Doctor doth not mean, that what is percolated hath no body or substance, but only that 'tis more re∣fin'd.</NOTE> <HI>percolated, not perfect in their several kinds, but</HI> in suo primitivo, <HI>not single, but all mixed together, which as yet I could never attain to separate. And therefore this Salt is nothing so acid as Vitriol, nor stiptick as Alom, nor inflammable as Nitre, notwithstanding it doth shoot in Stiria's. I'le only add this, That they are all here, though</HI> in fra∣ctis, imminutis, &amp; debilitatis viribus, <HI>and the vir∣tues of the Waters to be judged from them all.</HI></P>
<P>To which I shall only subjoyn this Remarque, That the Nitre, undoubtedly here, being allay'd with the mixture of some other Salts, could not be expected to do altogether as sincere Nitre doth, and the best way, I conceive, to discover the distinct natures in this <HI>Compositum,</HI> had been to have at∣tempted a separation by frequent Calcinations, Dis∣solutions, and Coagulations, which, if done, I much admire the several Salts did not appear in proper form, as they did in the anomalous Salt of these Waters, subjected to the same way of trial: and then I somewhat question, whether Alom would have deserved so much favour, as the Doctor's good nature hath allow'd it here.</P>
<P>I shall forbear, at present, to trace this Author or follow his track any further, as also to examine his Opinion, concerning the Cause of the Heat of the Bath-waters, till my Treatise, in the same lan∣guage he hath written in, be presented to the World; only thus much I shall say now, That I conceive an <HI>Hypothesis</HI> founded, though not on a subterranean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, yet on things under ground, may probably
<PB N="41" REF="38" MS="y"/> give more satisfaction than some airy notions, con∣sidering especially, that nothing external to the Body of the Earth, can in reason be supposed capable of reaching these Waters, but rather somewhat inclu∣ded in its own Bowels, which may be near at hand, of an active, even, and durable nature; when, to say no more, nothing is more variable than the air, nor unconstant than rain.</P>
<P>I shall also distinguish the whole bulk of what relates to the Body of the Waters, into things Sa∣line, and <HI>non</HI>-Saline: the former I shall endeavour to evince to be <HI>Nitre, Common Salt,</HI> and <HI>Vitriol;</HI> the latter, to be partly unctuous, as <HI>Bitumen</HI> and <HI>Sulphur;</HI> partly gritty, as <HI>Freestone;</HI> and partly earthy, as <HI>Marl</HI> and <HI>Ochre.</HI> I shall likewise exa∣mine what pretences Alom can make, and further discourse of the difference between that and Vitri∣ol: and lastly, enquire into the competition of <HI>Lapis Calcarius</HI> with Freestone; so that the Bath-water will have relation to, or comprehend in its largest extent, eight distinct Substances, at least ac∣cording to my Observations, which will be the bu∣siness, God willing, of the first Book of my Trea∣tise <HI>De Thermis Bathoniensibus,</HI> viz. <HI>de Aquarum Principiis, una cum earundem appendiculis, nimi∣rum, Arena, sive Sabulo, Luto, &amp; supernatante uligine, sive Spumâ.</HI> The second Book shall treat <HI>De Aquarum Calore.</HI> The third <HI>De usu Thermarum; ubi de modo Balneandi; de Aquarum potatione; de Antliatione jam in usu loco dulciae, aut Stillicidii Veterum; de usu Luti,</HI> &amp;c. The fourth and last Book, I intend, shall be <HI>De Aquarum Virtutibus, &amp; Nocumentis, observationibus quibusdam rarioribus, quantum res ipsa patitur confirmatis:</HI> Which Emo∣luments and Inconveniences shall be both evidently deduced from the precedent Principles, the one re∣commended,
<PB N="42" REF="39"/> the other provided against. But this will require some time; for I am willing to prevent that fault in my self, which I find in another, and would not have it justly said of me, <HI>Canis festinans coecos parit Catulos.</HI></P>

<P>I Know you (as well as other Ingenious and In∣quisitive Persons) are somewhat concern'd, and desirous to understand, what Success my late En∣quiries have had into one of the Grand Mysteries of Nature, I mean, the BATHS of this Ci∣ty: considering especially that you were pleased the last Summer to afford me the Honour of your Com∣pany and particular Acquaintance, and to express a more than ordinary desire of my proceeding in this Thing.</P>
<P>Concerning which I must tell you, That as I have not been wanting, either to Pains or Pay, in my Proceedings hitherto; so I have had the good Hap (which hath been my Encouragement) to meet with many considerable Discoveries.

<P>About the same time also one <HI>John Jones,</HI> an ho∣nest <HI>Cambro-Britan,</HI> frequenting the Baths for Pra∣ctice, composed a little Treatise of them, which he calls <HI>Baths Aid,</HI> in which are some things not con∣temptible, though in a plain Countrey dress, and which might satisfie and gratifie the Appetite of those times, which fed more heartily and healthily too, on good Beef and Bag-Pudding, than we do now upon Kickshaws and Haut-gusts; yet no∣thing of the true Nature is there discovered, only, as almost in all former Writers of Baths, chiefly Ca∣tholick, a strong Stench of Sulphur, and a great ado about a Subterranean Fire, a fit resemblance of Hell, at least of Purgatory.</P>
<P>Our Countrey-man Dr. <HI>William Turner,</HI> I con∣fess, was more particularly concern'd to give a bet∣ter account, than I find is done in his Discourse of English, German, and Italian Baths: And whether want of opportunity, or any other impediment was
<PB N="44" REF="40"/> in cause, I know not; but I find that at this stay they stood till the Famous Dr. <HI>Jorden</HI> took Pen in Hand, about the Year 1630. To whom I thought fit to make some Additions, at my first entrance on this Place, some five Years since. And although that Learned and Candid Physician had <HI>chiefly and more especially an intent to enlarge the Knowledg of our Baths in</HI> Somerset-shire, (as he declares to my Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> in his Dedicatory Epistle) and hath per∣formed more than any Man before him, yet what was first in Intention, was last in Execution; and how small a part of that Treatise is spent upon this Subject, how short he is in some Material Points, and what Objections may be framed against his Opi∣nion, I may sometime or other, with due Respect, more largely treat of; and for the present shall here, with good <HI>Sem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> cast a Garment over the Nakedness of this my Father.</P>
<P>What hath been done since (except in some par∣ticular pieces of other Tracts, to the Authors of which the Baths are also indebted for their kindness and good will) is not worth the mentioning. The old saying's true, <HI>Little Dogs must piss,</HI> and what is writ upon an Ale-bench claims the greater affinity to the Pipe and the Candle; especially if the best Wine at the Feast (which is usually kept till last) be but a silly Story of <HI>Tom Coriat,</HI> and an old <HI>Taun∣ton</HI> Ballad new vampt, abusing the dead Ghosts of <HI>Lud, Hudibras</HI> and <HI>Bladud,</HI> with a Nonsensico-Prag∣matical, Anticruzado-Orientado-Rhodomontado-Untruth-Le Grand, which we Westerly Moderns, call a GROTELYE, into the Bargain. A pretty Artifice in Rhetorick, to cry a thing up, and besmear, and <HI>shed plentifully</HI> on the Founder <HI>Ordure, both Humane and Belluine.</HI></P>

<P>I have Industriously omitted Dr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> Dr. <HI>Venner,</HI> and some others, in regard it would be improper here to Write more Historically. I shall therefore now let you know not so much what hath been done by others, as what further discoveries have been made by my endeavours, assisted by the careful Pains of Mr. <HI>Henry Moor</HI> an expert Apothe∣cary and Chymist of this City.</P>
<P>And here at first I cannot but take notice how that opinion hath so much prevailed as to be ac∣counted Orthodox, and not only received by Tra∣dition as certain, but Printed as such, that the Body of the Waters is so jejune and empty, as to afford little or nothing at all whereby to make a discovery of its Nature, and that what impregnates the Baths is not Substantially, Materially or Corporally there, but potentially, virtually and formally, or to use the Author's own words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carolus Claro∣mont</HI> de Aer. Aq. &amp; Loc. T. A. pag. <HI>32.</HI></NOTE> with much more canting after this manner, in a small discourse in Latin written by an Itinerant Exotick; when as a slight operation will soon evince it, though white and transparent of it self, being taken imme∣diately from the Pump, to contain a considerable quantity of a Dusky, Gritty, and Saline Matter, with many transparent Particles intermixed with it, to the proportion, (as near as I can calculate) of two drams to a gallon of the Water. And this I can ascertain, having had several ounces of it done in Earth, Iron, Bell-metal, and Glass, and have
<PB N="46" REF="41"/> at this time three or four ounces by me, untoucht, beside what I have made use of in other Experi∣ments.</P>
<P>But the thing I shall more Peculiarly insist on, at this present, is, That by God's blessing on my In∣dustrious Search, I suppose I have lighted on the main Constituent of the Virtues of the Bath, in which chiefly resides what benefit can be expected from the use of these Waters, and lodgeth in a Sa∣line substance, in a very small proportion to the Bo∣dy of the Waters; so that as they are now, not much more than forty grains is contained in a Gallon, insomuch that this little Soul, as I may so term it, is almost lost in so Gigantick a Body, and cannot animate it with that vigour and activity as may be rationally expected, were a greater quantity of the Salt contained in a less proportion of the Water. The Remainder, which is not Saline, being, as I judg, two Parts of Three of the Bulk of the con∣tents, is partly Whitish, Gritty, and of a Lapide∣ous Nature, concreting of it self, into a stony con∣sistence not easily dissolvable; partly more Light, and Dirty, resembling Clay, or Marle, and disco∣vers it self by an apparent separation from the Sa∣line and Gritty part mentioned before.</P>
<P>Now the chief Virtue of the Bath, as I conceive, consisting in the Salts, which appear by undeniable Experiments, to be Nitrous, and I believe Vitrio∣line (Bitumen and Sulphur being not Primarily, as these Salts, but Secondarily concern'd) and no small proportion of other things blended with it, the best way to make it most serviceable I conceived to be, to free it from those incumbrances and al∣lays it hath from the other Ingredients, and prepare it as exactly as may be performed by Art, for the benefit of those especially who are willing to Drink
<PB N="47" REF="41"/> the Waters with greater success in a lesser quantity; which they may now do, and have more of the virtue of the Waters in a quart, three pints, or a pottle, than they formerly had in two or three Gallons, did they drink so much; which will be, besides other Conveniencies, a great relief to the Stomach, which certainly must be relaxed, and the Tone of it injured by that vast quantity of Water which is usually taken, diluting its ferment over∣much, and distending its Membranes beyond all the bounds of a reasonable Capacity.</P>
<P>Besides, What is separated only by an artificial Extraction will better unite again, and mix with the Waters, as much more familiar, than the ex∣traneous Salts of <HI>Sal Prunella,</HI> Cream of Tartar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are usually dissolved and drunk with the Waters; so that a great part of the Operation may be ascribed to that; and the Waters being, as we say, between two Stools, that of it self, and the dissolvent in it, hath not attained to that degree of Reputation as they have deserved, and may be pro∣cured with much more advantage, if nothing but the same be spent upon the same, a way of Improve∣ment altogether equally beneficial to Fluids and So∣lids, to the wet as to the dry.</P>
<P>Again, Whereas it is a custom here as in all other places of the like Nature, when Persons are not willing, or have not conveniences to come to the Fountain Head, to send for the Waters to the pla∣ces of their Residence, not thinking it much material whether <HI>Mahomet</HI> go to the Mountain, or the Moun∣tain come to him, whereby the Virtue of the Wa∣ters is much impaired, if not stopped and sealed up with very great care; this defect may in good part be supplyed by the addition of a Quantity of the same Ingredients, which may repair the loss that
<PB N="48" REF="42"/> hath been sustained by Evaporation in the Carri∣age, or other way of damage, and restore it again, as near as may be, to its pristine Virtue, and genuine advantage. Not to mention, that if need require, and the poorer sort cannot procure or pay the Fraight for the Waters, they may take a short∣er course, by mixing the Salt, which they may have at reasonable Rates, with Spring-Water, brought to a proportionable degree of heat at home, and expect more advantage, for ought I know, than those that drink the Waters themselves at so great a distance.</P>
<P>And because I am now fallen on this Subject, I shall crave leave to remind you of what you well enough understand already, that not only <HI>Dulcius</HI> but <HI>Ʋtilius ex ipso Fonte, &amp;c.</HI> and Waters especially impregnated with volatile Spirits, such as most acid are, and peculiarly Vitrioline, to avoid the incon∣venience and expence, not so much of Money as Virtue, in the Carriage, must be drank on the place where they are, which, in some kind resembling Children, that must live by sucking, if once remov∣ed from their Mother, or Nurse, by degrees dwin∣dle away, and at last die.</P>
<P>It is observable in these Waters, that with four Grains of Galls injected into a Pint Glass of Water, or the Water poured on it, it immediately turns of a purple Colour, which in short time after, as the Water cools, abates much of its vividity, and be∣comes more faint: if the Waters be suffered to cool, and be quite cold before the Galls are injected, but little alteration happens upon a much greater proportion of Galls superadded, and (what is more remarkable) if the Water, which is permitted to cool, be recruited by the Fire, and the same Tryal reiterated, it offers no greater satisfaction in change
<PB N="49" REF="42"/> of Colour, than the second Experiment. Consonant to what <HI>Andreas Baccius</HI> hath formerly observ'd, who in his second Book <HI>de Thermis, Cap.</HI> 10. <HI>Pag.</HI> 69. hath these words, <HI>Nulla Balnei Aqua, eodem cum successu ac laude bibitur longe exportata, quo ad fontem proprium; maxima enim parte ex ipso fonte haustae ac delatae, amittunt omnem virtutem; multae non servantur per hyemem, dilutae pluviis; &amp; quae ut∣cunque servantur delatae à propriis fonticulis, fieri non potest, quin amittant, cum calore suo Minerali, vivificos illos Spiritus in quibus omnis Juvamenti vis consistit, quae semel amissa, nullo postea extrinseco calore restituitur. Quod est valde notandum.</HI></P>
<P>I have been the more particular in this, in regard it is a very useful and practical Discovery, and may procure more real advantage to Mankind, than the vain and unattainable attempts of the Philosophers Stone, making Glass malleable, and the Quadrature of a Circle.</P>
<P>Some other Observations I shall also mention, of a less magnitude, and more contracted circum∣ference, as the dying of the Bath-guides skins, the Bathers Linnen, and the Stones in the bottom of the Bath, of a yellow colour, and the eating out of the Iron Rings of the Bath, the Iron Bars of the Windows about the Bath, and any Iron infused in it; insomuch as I have now by me a Gad of Iron by accident taken up among the Stones of the Kings-Bath, so much eaten out, and digested by the Ostrich stomach of these Waters, that, the sweetness extracted, what remains resembles very much a Hony-comb, a deep perforation in many places be∣ing attempted, and the whole Gad it self reduced to a thing very much like a Sponge.</P>
<P>The first, <HI>viz.</HI> the Tincture I have discovered to arise from an Ochre, with which the Bath abounds,
<PB N="50" REF="43"/> and hath afforded me a considerable quantity, so that now I have near a pound by me, and with an infusion of that in warm water, tinge Stones as exactly of the Bath colour, that they are not discern∣able one from another. It is further observable, that the nearer the place of ebullition, where the Springs arise, the deeper and finer is the Yellow colour, so that in some places, about the Cross in the Kings Bath, and at the head of the great Spring, at the Southwest corner thereof, it is almost made a natu∣ral paint, being laboured together by the working of the Springs, and a continual succession of new Matter coming on, free from those impurities it contracts in other places, which make it distinguish∣able into two or three sorts, according to its mix∣tures with, or freedom from, more adulterating Matter. The Clouts also and Woollen Rags, which the Guides use to stop the Gouts withal, besides the Walls, Slip-doors and Posts, when the Bath is kept in a considerable time, as in the Winter season it useth to be, are all very much tinged with this yel∣low substance, and if at any time they chance to lie unwash'd or not thrown away, they send out so ungrateful a scent, that a man had rather smell to a Carnation, Rose, Violet, or a Pomander, than be within the wind of so unwelcom a smell, it being the greatest policy to get the Weather-gage in this encounter. The same thing I have experienced in Vessels at home, where after it had stood some time in a common infusion of warm water, I have the same reverence for that as Pictures, and do aver it to be true, <HI>E Longinquo reverentia major.</HI></P>
<P>One thing more is to be noted before I leave this particular, that although so much of this yel∣low Matter is continually bred, with which the neighbouring Ground is sufficiently replenisht, as I
<PB N="51" REF="43"/> have found by digging in some places not far distant, yet nothing of that colour is discovered in the Con∣tents, a probable argument it either evaporates, to which I am more inclin'd, in regard I find it much more copious where the Steam of the Bath meets with any resistence, or else it may be, which is less probable, turns colour by the fire in evaporation that way; less probable, I say, because for further satisfaction, I have decocted the Ochre more than once, and find rather that it gets than loses in its colour.</P>
<P>The Reason of this I conceive to be, That this Ochre being probably, as I have elsewhere dis∣courst, the vehicle of Vitriol, on its separation from it in the open air, precipitates to the bottom, and tinges the stones with a yellow colour, leaving the body of the waters through which it passes much unconcern'd; which may be one reason, why the Water of the open Bath tingeth not with Galls, as I have observ'd, like that from the Pumps, though the avolation of Spirits may not perhaps be alto∣gether ridiculous, considering especially, that the water from the Pump when cold, will lose its ting∣ing property, though nothing be observ'd to be precipitated. And that some of this yellow matter is contained in the water, though with some difficulty observed, doth appear from the fifty second Obser∣vation.</P>
<P>The greenish colour ariseth from another cause, which I conceive may be the effect either of the Salt or Vitriol, or both, the former making that colour in meats long in salt, and the latter, if from green Copperas, may easily be understood.</P>
<P>The eating out of the Iron I conceive must proceed from something Corrosive, and till any one can assure me 'tis something else, I shall judge
<PB N="52" REF="44"/> it to be Vitriol, though the Salt also may contribute not a little. And that it may appear not to be cau∣sed by the bare steam, as Rust is bred upon Pot∣hooks and Cotterels, besides the difficulty to con∣ceive how the steam should operate under water, as in the case of the Gad before mentioned, I made a Lixivium of the contents of the Water, and in it infused Iron but a very small time, and found it to do the same as in the Bath it self, considering the time of infusion; and the very Knives and Spatules I put in to stir some residence in the bottom, were almost as soon as dry, crusted over and defended with a rusty coat.</P>
<P>I have other Arguments I suppose will contri∣bute something more to the confirmation of this opinion; as that with the help of the Sand of the Bath, with Water and Galls, I made good writing Ink, which in a short time comes to be very legible; but the infusion of the Contents in Common wa∣ter, or the Lixivium thereof, with an addition of an inconsiderable proportion of the decoction of Galls makes it tolerably legible on the first com∣mixture, only the first, <HI>viz.</HI> that made with Sand, casting an eye of decayed red from a mixture of Ochre contained in the same. Neither is it altoge∣ther to be slighted, that the Water it self hath been heretofore used by the best writing Masters for the making of Ink, who observing by their experience, that Ink made with Bath-water, and the other u∣sual Ingredients, had a better colour, and was more lasting than any other, preferred this Water before any other for this use, as I have been informed by some credible persons. Also having not long since occasion to pour warm water on the Contents of the Bath, in order to the making a Lixivium, some of the water happened by an accident to fall on a
<PB N="53" REF="44"/> Bazil skin I sometimes use, and immediately turn∣ed the Red into a Black more than the breadth of an ordinary hand, with as much facility as any Curriers Liquor. Alum I know will do the like, but I find no necessity to assert that, which had it any thing to do here, must make the Water much rougher, whiter and sowrer, than I find it to be. To which I may add, that many judicious persons, my Patients, and some intelligent and eminent Phy∣sicians also have assured me, that they have perfect∣ly discerned by the taste a mixture of Vitriol, and that I need not doubt, but that was one principal Ingredient. 'Tis also not very inconsiderable, that the Bath-water alone will coagulate Milk, though not after the usual way of making a Posset; for after the Milk and Water are put together, it must boil pretty smartly, else the Curd will not rise. I may likewise subjoyn as a further probability, that on the relenting of the Salt extracted into an Oyl <HI>per deliquium,</HI> there is a very sharp Stiptick and Vitrioline taste perceived in the gross <HI>deliquium,</HI> as also in the clear Oyl, and the Salt it self; not to mention its shooting into glebes, of which I have some small assurances by trials I have made, not yet sufficiently satisfactory, and therefore I dis∣miss this part for the present, with the greatest pro∣bability, till a further inquiry shall make me po∣sitive.</P>
<P>But as to Nitre, there can be no question made about that I suppose; for besides the quick, acri∣monious, cooling, and nauseous taste, most apparent∣ly discoverable both in the infused contents, the Salt and Oyl (the latter of which, <HI>viz.</HI> the nauseous Taste, I take more particular notice o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in regard it is most predominant, and assigned by <HI>Fallopius</HI> to Nitre, and the Waters impregnated with it, which,
<PB N="54" REF="45"/> he says, sometimes do <HI>subvertere stomachum, &amp; facere nauseam, de Therm. Aq. &amp; Met. cap.</HI> 9. besides, I say, these probable conjectures) what will set it beyond all contradiction, is, that it hath the true Characteristick of Nitre, and shoots in Needles, of which I have now lately shot above twenty <HI>Stiriae.</HI></P>
<P>I the rather mention this, in regard it hath been my good hap to bring this thing to perfection and autoptical Demonstration, which hath been in vain attempted by some industrious persons; not that I am, in the least, willing to arrogate to my self, or derogate from them, more than what is fitting, but to confirm this truth, that there are some <HI>Mollia tempora fandi;</HI> some opportunities, when Nature will give willing audience, without much ceremo∣ny or ado, confessing more by fair perswasions, than racks and torments, and greater importunity. And that we ought to be very cautious how we affirm a thing not to be, upon the failure of a single, or some repeated Experiments.</P>
<P>In fine, Lest I should too much exceed the bounds of a Letter, what concerns the cause of the Heat of the Waters, I say little of here, only tell you, that when I shall come to discourse of that Subject, of which I intend, God willing, a large Disquisition in another Language, I believe I shall find my self obliged not so much to depend on a subterranean Fire, as to expect greater satis∣faction from another Hypothesis.</P>
<P>Many more Experiments I have made upon the Sand, Scum and Mud of the Bath, with some Observations drawn from the <HI>Natura Loci,</HI> or Ground hereabouts; but, I fear, I have been too tedious already, and therefore, without further
<PB N="55" REF="45"/> ceremony, shall release you out of this Purgatory, with the Subscription of,</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Antiquity of the Baths and City.</HEAD>
<P>AND now it may be expected I should say something concerning the Antiquity of the Baths and City, which I the rather do here, in regard since my writing any thing of this kind heretofore, in many Particulars I have met with better information.</P>
<P>Not to mention any thing of <HI>Bladud,</HI> and the <HI>British</HI> Histories, as at best, uncertain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul. Malm.</NOTE> I shall first take notice of the Opinion of those that ascribe their discovery to <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> fifty years, or there∣abouts, before Christ, which the Learned Antiqua∣ry Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> thinks not so probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Br. p <HI>234.</HI></NOTE> because <HI>Selinus,</HI> who lived in the time of <HI>Titus Vespasian,</HI> 130 years after, and 83 (rather 81) years after Christ, was the first of the <HI>Romans</HI> that made men∣tion of them. But if it be uncertain when <HI>So inus</HI> lived, and most likely after the year three hundred, as my Judicious friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Will: Lloyd.</NOTE> the Reverend and Learned Dean of <HI>Bangor</HI> hath observ'd, then the Antiquity reaches not so high.</P>
<P>To which may be added most assuredly, That <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> came not so far up into the Land: For
<PB N="56" REF="46"/> whatever some Poets and Poetical Historians that lived a thousand years after him, may deliver, certain it is that <HI>J. Caesar</HI> made not so great a Con∣quest here as they made for him; whence <HI>Tacitus</HI> writes, That he discover'd only, not delivered un∣to the <HI>Romans, Britain.</HI> His words in the life of <HI>Julius Agricola</HI> are these; <HI>Primus omnium D.</HI> Julius <HI>cum exercitu</HI> Britanniam <HI>ingressus, quanquam pros∣pera pugna terruerit incolas, ac littore potitus sit, potest videri ostendisse posteris, non tradidisse.

For ma∣ny years after this Entrance of <HI>Caesar,</HI> the Inhabi∣tants of this Island were left to the free govern∣ment of their own Kings, and used their own Laws.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Twin. <HI>Comm. p.</HI> 146, 147.</NOTE>Another Learned Antiquary treating of <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Conquest here, is of opinion that it extended no farther than <HI>Kent,</HI> some part of <HI>Sussex, Surrey, Mid∣dlesex</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> and perhaps, as the Learned Dr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> hath further noted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Bell. <HI>Gall.</HI> lib. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE> into the edge of <HI>Berks, Ox∣ford</HI> and <HI>Bucks;</HI> for he mentions the <HI>Bibroci</HI> and <HI>Anealites,</HI> which <HI>Cambden</HI> with good probability places there.

Re∣liqui vero populi manus quidem dederunt, quorum tamen regiones nunquam à</HI> Caesare <HI>conspectae sunt. To me, indeed, it seemeth probable, that</HI> Julius Caesar, <HI>with the Souldiers under his Command, conquered all</HI> Kent, <HI>the neighbouring parts of</HI> Sussex <HI>and</HI> Sur∣rey, <HI>called by the name of</HI> Regnum, <HI>also</HI> Middlesex <HI>and</HI> Essex, <HI>which the Learned call</HI> Trinobants; <HI>neither do I believe but that if he had conquered or made peace with more, he would have mentioned them: Some other Inhabitants nearest to danger yield∣ed, whose Country</HI> Ca sar <HI>never saw.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Saxon</HI> names of <HI>Bathancester, Hat Bathan,</HI> and <HI>Akmanchester,</HI> are of later date, the <HI>Saxons</HI> not arriving here till the time of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the younger, about the year of Christ, according to the most probable account of Venerable <HI>Bede,</HI> 449.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist.

<P><HI>Anno</HI> 575, saith the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle, <HI>the City of</HI> Bathe, <HI>as also</HI> Glocester <HI>and</HI> Ciceter, <HI>were taken by</HI> Cuthwin <HI>and</HI> Ceaulin <HI>the</HI> Saxons <HI>from the</HI> Britains, <HI>after the slaughter of three</HI> British <HI>Kings,</HI> Commail, Condidan, <HI>and</HI> Farinmail, <HI>that year in a battle at</HI> Deorham.</P>

<P>I know very well that <HI>Mons Palader</HI> was a name amongst the <HI>Britans</HI> for <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Tho.

<P>I shall only add, That <HI>Ptolomy</HI> reckons <HI>Therma</HI> and <HI>Ischalis</HI> as Cities of the <HI>Belgae,</HI> whereof <HI>Ischa∣lis,</HI> now <HI>Ilchester,</HI> he places in 16 degrees 40 minutes of Longitude; 53 degrees 30 minutes of Latitude; and the other City <HI>Therma,</HI> or <HI>Bathe,</HI> in 17 degrees 20 minutes of Longitude, and 53 degrees 40 mi∣nutes of Latitude.</P>

<P>Let this then suffice for the Antiquity of the
<PB N="60" REF="48"/> Waters, That we have a Tradition, and the Autho∣rity too of some suspected Writers, that the Baths were discovered eight hundred and odd years be∣fore Christ: That not long after Christ, we have undoubted mention made of them in credible Au∣thors, and that doubtless they were known, and made use of too, long before any Author writ of them: So that to trace their Original, is to unravel the Creation, and to make enquiry for their com∣mencement, little different than to seek after the Head of <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>To give but a taste of the Philosophy of the Times, but little more than two hundred years ago, in reference to these Waters, I shall mention a part of the Riming History of Unfortunate Prin∣ces, composed by <HI>John Boccace,</HI> who lived about <HI>A.

<P>What probability the Philosophical part of this Poetry may carry concerning the seven kinds of

<P><HI>Alexander Necham,</HI> somewhat above 400 years ago, wrote these Verses on the Baths.</P>

<P>As to the City, it is not, I think, to be doubted, but that the Baths were before that, and gave name to it, sick people making small Cottages first for their Conveniences, which were afterwards improv∣ed into fairer Buildings. <HI>Constat Latinum nomen huic Civitati ab Antiquis inditum, Aquae Calidae ex his Balneis,</HI> saith <HI>Andr. Baccius,</HI> if the Testimony of a Stranger may be admitted; <HI>It is certain the City was called</HI> Aquae Calidae, <HI>from the Baths.</HI> The Statues also of <HI>Coil</HI> a Britti h King, and <HI>Edgar</HI> a Saxon, who are said, how truly I know not, to have given Charters to this City, placed at the end of the Town-Hall, or Council-House, are argu∣ments of its Antiquity, although perhaps they might be Patrons that were chosen by the Monks.</P>
<P>That <HI>Edgar</HI> was Crowned at <HI>Bathe</HI> above 700 years ago, <HI>Bathe</HI> being then called an <HI>Old Borough,</HI> with great Solemnity, on <HI>Whitsunday,</HI> appears from these words of the <HI>Saxon Chronicle,</HI> written by one that then lived, and writ his History but three years after his Coronation. <HI>Anno</HI> 973. May 11. <HI>being</HI> Whitsunday, Edgar <HI>was Consecrated King with great glory, in that</HI> Old Borough Ake∣mannesceastre, <HI>which by another name they call</HI> Ba∣thon, <HI>there was great joy to all men on that Blessed Day, which they call</HI> Pentecost; <HI>there was a great Assembly of Priests and Monks, and the Wise met there in Councel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edgar</HI> had lived 29 years full of trouble and mi∣sery, when this came to pass, and in his 30th. year was Consecrated.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 520. or 71 years after their arrival here out of <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>English Saxons</HI> besieged this City, with whom K. <HI>Arthur</HI> fought a great Battel on <HI>Mons Badonicus,</HI> now called <HI>Bannesdown,</HI> and
<PB N="64" REF="50"/> slew so many of them, that they had little heart to make any further attempt for a considerable time, but left it to the quiet possession of the <HI>Britains.</HI> Yet <HI>Ninnius</HI> writeth, that the 12th. of K. <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Battels against the <HI>Saxons,</HI> was at the Hill or Town of <HI>Bathe,</HI> where many a one was slain by his force and might. The <HI>Saxons</HI> then had besieged <HI>Bathe,</HI> K. <HI>Arthur</HI> rais'd their Siege, and after besieged them on <HI>Mons Badonicus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Lloyd.</HI></NOTE> where he took their Camp, made a great slaughter of them, and then kept his <HI>Christmas</HI> in <HI>Bathe.</HI> This was the year that <HI>Gildas</HI> was born, and thereupon was called <HI>Badonicus</HI> ever after.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 676. <HI>Osbrich</HI> founded here a Nunnery, and not long after <HI>Offa</HI> K. of <HI>Mercia</HI> built a Church, both which in the time of the <HI>Danish</HI> Wars were demolisht.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities in <HI>Bathe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT the greatest Argument of Antiquity the Place affords, I suppose to be the <HI>Roman</HI> Coins found in or near it, with the Inscriptions and Ima∣ges in the Town or Borough Walls, the latter of which, to wit, the Inscriptions and Images, Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> took notice of, and inserted into his <HI>Bri∣tannia.</HI></P>
<P>To begin with the <HI>Roman</HI> Coins: The first I shall mention is that of <HI>Vespasian,</HI> made 1600 years since, this Emperour's Reign beginning <HI>A. D.</HI> 71. with this Circumscription on the Face-side: IMP. CAES. VESPASIAN. P. F. AUG. <HI>Imperator Caesar Vespasianus, Pius, Felix, Augustus.</HI> The Re∣verse; PIETAS AUGUSTI, with an Image be∣tween S.

<PB N="67" REF="51"/>
<P>A third is of <HI>Carausius,</HI> who usurpt Empire in <HI>Britain Anno Christi</HI> 285. reigned seven years, was slain by <HI>Alectus</HI> who usurpt after him, and was himself killed by <HI>Asclepiodotus praefectus Praeto∣rio Anno</HI> 295.

<P>The fourth is of <HI>Constantine</HI> the younger, made Caesar together with <HI>Licinius</HI> and <HI>Crispus</HI> in <HI>March, Anno Christi</HI> 316. with these Letters round the Head: CONSTANTINUS IUN. NOB.

<P>The fifth of <HI>Alex. Sever. A. D.</HI> 224. with this Inscription: IMP. C. M. AUR. SEV. ALEX∣AND. AUG. <HI>Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander Augustus.</HI> The Reverse; P. M. T.

<P>The sixth is a Coin of <HI>Constantius</HI> made <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 357. in <HI>May,</HI> when he kept his <HI>Vicenalia,</HI> as appears by <HI>Votis XXX. Votis triginta, Multis XXXX.

<PB N="68" REF="52"/> CONSTANTIUS P. F. AUG. <HI>Dominus Constan∣tius Pius, Felix, Augustus.</HI> This is Silver, and was found in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> not far hence, and given by Mr. <HI>Edward Barnard,</HI> a skilful Bone-setter at <HI>Tedbury</HI> in that County.</P>
<P>The seventh is a Brass piece of <HI>Valentinian</HI> the Second, who Reigned <HI>A. D.</HI> 375, with this Inscrip∣tion on the face-side DN. VALENTINIANUS P. F. AUG, <HI>Dominus Valentinianus Pius Foelix Augustus.</HI> The Reverse, <HI>Victory</HI> holding a Palm-branch in the left hand, and offering a Garland with the right; the Motto, SECURITAS REIPUB∣LICAE, and P.

<P>The eighth is a Brass Coin of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, about the year of Christ 307, with this In∣scription CONSTANTINO CAES. <HI>Constantino Caesari.</HI> Reverse, <HI>Victory</HI> with a Spear and Shield, only these letters under P.

<P>These are all the Coins I have met with yet of any value, among many others of none at all.</P>
<P>The Inscriptions and Images next succeed; and the first I take notice of is the nearest to the North-gate, being a Memorial of a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator, of the Colony of <HI>Glocester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambd. <HI>Br. p.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.</NOTE> a City built by the <HI>Romans,</HI> who also placed there a Colony called <HI>Colonia Gle∣vum.</HI> The Inscription thus:</P>

<P>The next is a little Image about a foot and half in length, supposed by Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> to be <HI>Hercules,</HI> bearing his left hand aloft, with a Club in his right. <HI>See Fig.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>Next to that lower, toward the West-gate, is the Monument of one of the Children of two <HI>Romans, Primulus, Romulus, Vipomulus,</HI> or rather <HI>Vete∣romulus</HI> (for that word in the stone is somewhat difficult to be read) and <HI>Victisarina,</HI> with a longer and exactly <HI>Roman</HI> Inscription, in a sepulchre Ta∣ble,

<P>For a fuller confirmation of the precedent parti∣culars, I think fit to insert in this place an extract out of an ancient Record, now in the house of my Honoured friend <HI>Edward Cosin</HI> Esquire, whose genius inclining him to the study of Antiquity, hath collected, and communicated it to me.</P>
<P><HI>Johannes de Villula,</HI> the 16th. Bishop of <HI>Wells,</HI> having bought the Town of <HI>Bathe</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> the First for five hundred Marks, transferred his Seat unto that City, 1088. Hence grew a jar between the Monks of <HI>Bathe</HI> and Canons of <HI>Wells,</HI> about the Election of the Bishop. At last the difference was composed by that Bishop <HI>Robert</HI> whom before I spake of: <HI>That</HI> from thence forward the Bishop should be nominated from both places, and that precedency in the style should be given to <HI>Bathe. That</HI> in the Vacancy of the See, a great number of
<PB N="89" REF="63"/> Delegates from both Churches should elect their Prelate, who being elected should be installed in them both: <HI>both</HI> of them to be reckon'd as the Bi∣shops Chapter, and the Grants and Patents con∣firmed in both. And so it stood until the reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth; what time the Monastery of <HI>Bathe</HI> being dissolved, there passed an Act of Parliament for the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Wells,</HI> to make one sole Chapter for the Bishop, A. 35. H. 8. c. 15. <HI>Thus far Mr. Cosin.</HI></P>
<P>The Church that now is, was first begun <HI>A. D.</HI> 1137. by <HI>Oliver King</HI> Doctor of Laws, of Kings Colledge in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> Principal Secretary to three Monarchs of this Land, <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Edward</HI> the fifth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; Register of the Knights of the Garter, Bishop of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and thence translated hither <HI>Novemb.</HI> 6. 1495. died 24th. of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1503, and is thought to lie buried at <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI> where he was sometime Canon. It was four hundred seventy five years before it was compleat∣ed and brought to perfection (having made many halts by the way) and was finisht about the middle of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, near. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1612, as by the Munificence of Noblemen, Knights, Gentlemen and others, so especially by the liberal hand of the Learned Dr. <HI>James Mountague</HI> Bishop of this Diocess, to whom the former Poem was directed, who at one time gave a thousand pounds towards its Reparation, and lies buried, by his own ap∣pointment under a fair Marble Monument, in the body of the Church, deceased <HI>July</HI> 20. 1618, with this elegant Epitaph on the South-side:

View, &amp;c.</HI> p. 101, 102, 103.</NOTE>Concerning <HI>Oliver King,</HI> the founder of this Church, Sr. <HI>John Harington</HI> tells this pretty story: That lying at <HI>Bathe,</HI> and musing or meditating one night late, after his Devotions and Prayers for the prosperity of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh and his Children (who were then all or most part living) to which King he was Principal Secretary, and by him pre∣ferred to this Bishoprick; he saw, or supposed he saw a Vision of the holy Trinity, with Angels as∣cending and descending by a Ladder, near to which there was a fair Olive Tree supporting a Crown, and a voice said, <HI>Let an</HI> Olive <HI>establish the Crown, and let a</HI> King <HI>restore the Church.</HI> Of this Dream or Vision he took exceeding great comfort, and told it divers of his friends, applying it to the King his Master in part, and some part to himself. To his Master, because the <HI>Olive</HI> being the Emblem or Hieroglyphick of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Plenty</HI> seemed to him to allude to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, who was worthily counted the wisest and most peaceable King in all Europe of that age. To himself (for the wisest will flatter themselves sometimes) be∣cause he was not only a chief Counsellour to this King, and had been his Ambassadour to conclude a most Honourable Peace with <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth, who paid, as <HI>Holinshead</HI> writeth, 745 Duckets, be∣sides a yearly Tribute of 25000 Crowns, but also he carried both the <HI>Olive</HI> and <HI>King</HI> in his Name; and therefore thought he was specially designed for
<PB N="93" REF="65"/> this Church-work, to the advancement of which, he had an extraordinary inclination. Thus though (as St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Aquin</HI> well noteth) all Dreams, be they never so sensible, will be found to halt in some part of their coherence: yet most certain it is, for the time, he was so transported with his Dream, that he presently set in hand with this Church, and at the West end thereof he caused a Representation to be graved of this Vision of the Trinity, the Angels and the Ladder; and on the North side the Olive and Crown, with certain <HI>French</HI> words (which I could not read) but in <HI>English</HI> is this verse taken out of the book of <HI>Judges,</HI> chap. 9.
<Q><L>Trees going to chese their King,</L>
<L>Said, be to us the Olive King.</L></Q> All which is so curiously cut and carved, as in the West part of <HI>England</HI> is no better work, than in the West end of this poor Church. And to make the credit of all this more authentick, he added this word to it, <HI>De sursum est, It is from on high.</HI> Thus much the Stones and Walls (though dumb witnesses, yet credible) do plainly testifie.</P>
<P>Thus far that Learned Knight, and Great Well-wisher to this Church; where it may be noted, that the Olive and Crown are on both sides of the Church, North and South, with an Elephant on each side of the Olive crown'd; and the words Sr. <HI>John</HI> saies he could not read, are not French, but Latin, being the old Translation of the English writ on both Pillars, of either side, in good Text hand, though now not so legible, above the Eng∣lish in this manner:

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the Baths of <HI>Bathe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COncerning the Nature, Use and Virtues of the Baths, I purpose, if God permit, to write a large and particular Account, in a Just Treatise on that Subject, consonant to my own Principles, which for the greater Credit of this Nation and Place (nothing having ever been before attempted in this kind) shall be in the general Language; the design of which I have expressed <HI>Chap.</HI> 7. For I well remember what I writ in my Appendix, seven years ago, in these words: <HI>I come now to speak some∣thing of the Nature, Ʋse and Virtues of the Baths. And here it cannot be expected I should say much, be∣cause my Experience of them as yet hath been but lit∣tle, and the Observations I have made seem fitter, as they are intended, for a foundation to a greater Work, which Time and Variety of Experiments must compleat, than at present to be Communicated to the Publick. And to make some compensation for my Brevity in this
<PB N="95" REF="66"/> Thing, which is justly deemed the most material of all other, I shall take the boldness to engage, as soon as Time and Opportunity shall permit, to make a through search into the Cause of the Heat, Nature, and Effi∣cacious Operations of the Baths, and perhaps give a more satisfactory Account of the former, than hath yet been given by any; and for the latter, I shall not build on the Hay and Stubble of the Talk and Rela∣tions of persons byast and concern'd, but on the solid basis of Reason, Observation, and Experience.</HI> And again, the last words: <HI>But I hope I may be excused on the score of my former Engagement, if I am not more particular at this time in things of this nature, till a just amassment of Observations and Experiments, and a rational deduction of Conclusions from them, which I hope in some time to accomplish, shall either confirm me in the opinion I now have of the Nature and Virtues of the Baths of</HI> Bathe, <HI>or supply me with a better.</HI></P>
<P>Having, I say, intended a Piece of this nature, and also published many Particulars relating to this Affair, in the ensuing Century of Observations, which I now make publick, as a Specimen of my way of procedure, and ground-work or foundation of my next Superstructure, I shall content my self at present with some few Remarks.</P>
<P>The Baths then in some Things do agree; in others are different.</P>
<P>They agree in this, That though chiefly three in number, the King's, Cross, and Hot (the Queen's being but an Appendent to the King's, as the Le∣per's to the Hot) yet they all participate of the same Minerals, only the Hot Bath, if some of my Observations hold, hath something more than the King's, or Cross, both which as to the particulars, and particular proportions, in a Hogshead, Gallon,
<PB N="96" REF="67"/> and Pint, are much the same, and what is defe∣ctive in one Ingredient in one Bath, is made up by another, in the other. So that herein the wonder∣ful Contrivance of the Almighty hath appeared, in making so fine a Composition of such various In∣gredients, and acted (with Reverence be it spoken) not only the Physician, but the Apothecary too, a good example and precedent for his Creatures to follow, who have liv'd to see that unhappy day, wherein a blear-ey'd <HI>Leah</HI> hath been advanc'd, though with shame and destruction too, above a legitimate <HI>Rachel.</HI></P>
<P>They differ chiefly in Dimension, and degree of Heat.</P>
<P>In Dimension; The King's Bath being 57 foot, or 19 yards, 10 inches, long; 40 foot, 8 inches, or 13 yards ½ and 2 inches in breadth.</P>
<P>The Queen's, 8 yards, or 24 foot, 2 inches, in breadth; in length 25 foot, 4 inches; or 8 yards, 16 inches.</P>
<P>The Cross Bath, 24 foot; or 8 yards, 6 inches long; 19 foot 11 inches, or 6 yards ½ and 5 inches over Northward; 12 foot, or 4 yards, 7 inches over on the South.</P>
<P>The Hot Bath, 10 yards 8 inches ½ long; 4 yards 13 inches ½ broad South; 4 yards ½ and 5 inches over North.</P>
<P>From this undeniably is deduc'd that they differ in the Water they contain; for being of different dimensions, the greater must hold more, and the lesser less. To pursue this Curiosity a little further, I find by Gage, The King's Bath being 1 yard 18 inches in Water, to contain three hundred and fourteen Tun, thirty six Gallons.</P>
<P>The Queen's, eighty one Tun, three Hogsheads, and eleven Gallons.</P>
<PB N="97" REF="67"/>
<P>The Cross, fifty three Tun, and forty seven Gallons.</P>
<P>The Hot, fifty four Tun, and twenty seven Gallons.</P>
<P>As to the difference arising from the degree of Heat, though I must acknowledg my defect of Ob∣servations in that kind, which I will hereafter sup∣ply, yet I may say thus much now, That the King's and Hot Baths are not more different in that parti∣cular than the Queen's, and Cross, and that this latter is the most temperate of all.</P>
<P>And here it may be noted, That what is written concerning the difference in degree of Heat in the Baths, is so to be understood as esteemed now; for the Hot Bath was formerly accounted the Hottest of all, whence it had its name, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the rest being ever, and so reputed Hot, though in some degrees inferior to that. Hence <HI>Jones</HI> says, From what he there deliver'd, the reason may be gather'd why some of the Waters of Baths break out most Hot, as the Hot Bath at <HI>Bathe;</HI> others meanly Hot, as the Cross Bath; others between both, as the King's Bath. And in another place; The King's Bath is Hot between both the other. But of this I intend, God willing, to make further Try∣als.</P>
<P>The Cause of this Variation I conceive to be not an Intention, and Remission of a Subterranean Fire, (which meeting with an Enemy that hath had so many recruits and reinforcements as the Water hath, and will have till the end of all Things, 'tis much should yet keep its ground, and not be extinct, to mention no other Absurdities at present, that unde∣niably follow on that <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> this Variation, I conceive, doth not arise on that score) but rather is caused by a greater or lesser fermentation, arising
<PB N="98" REF="68"/> from the Acting of an Acid on an Alcalizate Salt, both which are contained in the Bath, and much as∣sisted by the vast Quantity of an impalpable Pow∣der, the greatest Ingredient in the Waters, and seems to serve for no other end, except, what shall be hereafter mentioned, to administer a perpetual supply to the Fermentation.</P>
<P>'Tis likewise observable, That where the greatest Heat is, as in the King's, and Hot Bath, there is the greatest Quantity of this fermentative matter, insomuch as I have Calculated that near 50 pound weight goes off in little more than 24 hours in the King's; but in the Cross Bath, where less need is, there is less of this gritty matter, and much less goes off in a longer time. So that having sometime resembled this Fermentation to Generation, the fa∣ther of it being an acid saline Spirit, and the mo∣ther this gritty matter and Alcalizate Salt, the Conjunction made, and the Thing produc'd, the father slips away invisibly in a Mist of Steam, and the mother passes out at a back-door as soon as may be, resigning the Work to be successively promoted in the same manner, to future generations. And indeed should the matter still continue that hath done its work, the Springs and Channels would be quickly obstructed, so that what is acid being of light burden, and more active, quickly exhales, and the more Corpulent passeth off by convenient Sluces and Draughts, as an Excrement, upon which the Wheel of Fermentation is kept continually going, by an immediate succession of new matter of the same kind. That not only the acid part, but the more fixt Salts also do in part exhale, may be found confirmed by the 88th. Observation, which cannot but part with something of their Substance in the <HI>Lucta</HI> of Fermentation.</P>

<P>Again, In some places where the fermentation is less, as in the Water of St. <HI>Vincents Rock</HI> near <HI>Bristol,</HI> which hath not half the heat that the Cross-Bath hath, the Water abates near the proportion in the quantity of Ingredients; and although for the most part the same, yet in so small a proportion, cannot act as a greater quantity would do, and the acidity being so little as scarce to coagulate Milk, or turn with Galls, may not be expected to do wonders in a fermentation.</P>
<P>To conceive a continuation of the Hot waters of <HI>Bathe</HI> to that of <HI>Bristol,</HI> by way of Drein, as some Ingenious persons have imagin'd, is unphilo∣sophical. For if very Salt water becomes insipid by running but the tenth part of that course under ground, how can it rationally be expected that any Salt should be left of that little in the Bath here, after such a tedious journey, in which it may hap∣pily meet with many fresh Subterranean passengers in cross roads, that may intrude upon it, and, by mixing with it rob it long before both of its Salt∣ness and Heat.</P>
<P>I must therefore say here, what I shall further discourse of more at large in another place, That since my first consideration of this matter, I was ever inclin'd to believe, that the cause of the Heat and impregnation of the Baths was not far off from the Baths themselves, <HI>(Coram adest quod quaerimus)</HI> for to me it seems not a little strange, that on dig∣ging so many Wells, Stone-quarries, Cole-pits, and other penetrations of the Earth to a considerable depth, that have been made about the City, no Hot water should appear, but only in one Stone-quarry near <HI>Dunkerton</HI> about an hundred years ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bathes Aid,</HI> lib. 2. fol. 20.</NOTE> mentioned by <HI>Jones</HI> to have been so hot, that they were fain to forbear working: The truth of which
<PB N="100" REF="69"/> Relation I somewhat question, and rather believe the honest <HI>Cambrobritan,</HI> being a Stranger here, might the easier be imposed on by some fabulous Relator.</P>
<P>Another Argument for a different Fermentation I take to be the different forms of shooting of the Nitrous stiria's; otherwise, why should the Kings and Hot-Bath, that have the strongest heat, shoot into more compact needles, and much thicker than the Cross? but that the stronger fermentation ripens, and invigorates better the Crude matter of the shoots, when the other not so strong leaves the matter crude and weak.</P>
<P>Before I give a rough Draught of my own Hy∣pothesis, which I only here propose, and shall further, God willing, illustrate and polish in my next undertaking, I must premise these few parti∣culars, which in part contain a Survey of this Country.</P>
<P>First, That the ground on which the City of <HI>Bathe</HI> in good part stands, especially near the Baths, is raised ground, and that probably, under some yards of Gravel is a Bog, made by the confluence of Waters hither. This seems in good measure e∣vident from this, That on the digging some foun∣dations not long since, the Workmen came at last to a soft Mud, which yielding much, and a Soul∣diers Pike of a good length thrust into it, no bot∣tom was discovered, but a warm, Marly, Sulphurous mud adhering to the Pike. This was observ'd in the North and South-west parts of the Town.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Springs of Cold water a∣bout this place are very numerous, insomuch that sometime since, having been desired by that Inge∣nious and Learned Knight Sr. <HI>Anthony Morgan,</HI> since
<PB N="101" REF="69"/> dead in <HI>France,</HI> to search what Springs I could find hereabouts, in order to the making several mixtures, if that way we might give any light to a Fermentation; I remember I brought Water from twenty two several Springs, and might have done from as many more, within two miles com∣pass, on one side.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the two Water-houses supplying the City, are placed on two Hills, one on the North, and another on the South, for the more convenient supply of the whole with Water.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the Bowels of the Earth on the South of the Town, with the South-east and South-west parts, for four or five miles compass, are sufficiently replenisht with great plenty of Free∣stone, which supplies the Country round about with good Materials for building, and would do many Counties more were there a way agreed upon for its better conveyance.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That on the North part of the Town little or none of this Freestone is digged, but Wa∣ter arises in abundance, and on the Hills about <HI>Marshfield</HI> some Marcasites have been found, of which Vitriol is made, and probably more of that kind are contained in that ground. I mean not the white Marcasite found on <HI>Lansdown:</HI> what that was is notoriously known.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That another sort of Earth that abounds about <HI>Bathe,</HI> is blew Marle and Ochre. This is discovered almost in all sides of deep hollow ways, the River sides, and particularly at <HI>Lambridge,</HI> a mile off, is a blew Marly slate with Ochre sticking to it, and under that clear Ochre alone. And</P>
<P>Seventhly, That almost all things about the Bath, as Marle, Ochre, Freestone, Sand, Mud, Scum, Shells and Salts, will ferment on the affusion of any acid.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="70"/>
<P>These things premised, I proceed to my Con∣jecture concerning the Rise, Continuation and Heat of the Baths; and man can do no more; for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>the best Prophesie is but a good Guess.</HI></P>
<P>I conceive then, that the Salts and Marle with the conflux of Waters into this compass of lower ground, being created in the beginning, and then placed under or near where the Baths now stand, by the virtue of those words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>increase</HI> and <HI>multiply,</HI> have increased ever since from their own seeds, in their proper Seminaries, as the great∣est part of the Creation doth and ever will, till the consummation of all things. Neither do I see much more reason to admire the breeding and in∣crease of those Minerals under ground, than the perpetual springing and inexhaustible growth of the little spires of Grass we tread on above it: But it ever was and will be the humor of the gene∣rality of Mankind to overlook what's before them, and pay their admiration to what they do not see, it faring with many other things as with Vertue in the Poet:
<Q><L>— <HI>Praesentem odimus</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi.</HI></L>
<L>Vertue remov'd we dote on; present slight:</L>
<L>And darkness thus prefer before the light.</L></Q> The Salts being here sufficiently fixt, two large Currents of Water may come down upon them, and meet very near or under the Baths themselves; the one from the South, bringing with it its <HI>Cargo</HI> of Freestone, the commodity, as was said of that part of the Country; the other from the North, acuated by some Vitrioline Marcasites, over which
<PB N="103" REF="70"/> it may pass, and meeting near the place with all this matter that is fermentative, a fermentation may arise sufficiently productive of what heat we find; considering especially the closeness of the Caverns of the Earth in which it is bred, where little air can abate it, but rather by that advantage, reduplicate the heat.</P>
<P>Much to this purpose are the words of that In∣genious and Learned Physician Dr. <HI>Sherley,</HI> whose Philosophical Essay came late to my hands, and some considerable time after I had framed, and in these words written, my own Hypothesis; yet in regard some coincidencies, though at this di∣stance, and without any converse, have happen'd, which may confirm and illustrate what is before discoursed, I shall, by his permission, crave leave to say, That if the words I now recite be under∣stood of the Bath-waters, as he intended them of Water in general, the duration and equality of these Waters will be better understood, and found to be according as I have before asserted. He therefore saith in the beginning of the eighth Se∣ction of this Philosophical Essay, p. 112. <HI>In the beginning God infused into the bosom of the Waters the Seeds of all those things that were afterwards to be made out of the Waters, setting them their con∣stant rules and laws of acting, and by the power of the words,</HI> Increase <HI>and</HI> Multiply, <HI>they had a faculty given them to continue themselves in the same order till the World shall be destroyed by fire; at which time all Seminal beings shall desert their gross bodies, and return to their first fountain and grand Exemplar, GOD, on whom they have at this time a constant de∣pendance.</HI></P>
<P>This I am apt to believe might be made de∣monstrative, if digging about the Baths might be
<PB N="104" REF="71"/> admitted and practic'd without prejudice to the Springs, which, 'tis feared, will ensue, and there∣fore I must be content with that kind of Demon∣stration, which Art will afford in imitation of Na∣ture, some of which I could now propose; but I will not prevent my self in things of this nature, and therefore shall end this Subject for the present with these two Remarks:</P>
<P>First, That the Baths having the same Minerals, and but little differing in proportion neither, must be equally advantagious in the same distempers, but with this difference, that the different degrees of Heat altering somewhat the case, judgment must ad∣vise what Bath the Patient shall be committed to; how long it may be convenient to stay, and what government is to be used more in one Bath than another, besides the determination of the Distemper 'tis proper to relieve.</P>
<P>And, Secondly, Whereas great discourse hath arisen here concerning the conveyance of some Nuts that were observed in the Cistern over the main Spring of the Kings Bath, upon the altera∣tion of a firm stone cross in the middle, to that pretty Wooden device that now stands there; some whereof were black and rotten, others fresh with their kernels in them, and some with shales very green about them: the way of passage may be con∣ceived to have been by the currents of Cold water from an open Spring, if not the River, near a Cop∣pice or Wood-side, with which the water of the Bath may in part be supply'd, the Bath being, as I suppose, the great Exchequer, into which the lesser Rivulets do return their tribute, and to which they pay their homage, as to their Liege Lord and Soveraign, constituted such by Him, by whom Kings reign, and from whom alone they receive their Scep∣ters.
<PB N="105" REF="71"/> That these Nuts could not come, by a nearer cut, from the Bath-side, is most evident from this, That the Cistern was so well plaister'd about with Plaister of equal hardness with a stone, that it cost very many blows to get it up; presently from the rise of which the Nuts did appear, immediately shot up from the Springs themselves.</P>
<P>As to the Internal use of the Waters, so much of late applauded, and not without cause;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Ven∣ner <HI>Tr. of</HI> Bathe, p. 12.</NOTE> as a grave Physician, sometime of this Place, hath in his Wri∣tings condemned that, the Reason of which he ne∣ver understood; so would not I on the contrary, give my Vote for that which I had not throughly examin'd, and on good grounds judged and found advantagious.</P>
<P>It being therefore clear, that Vitrioline, Nitrous, and Saline springs, are recommended by the most Intelligent Writers to be used as a drink; and the forementioned Salts, the two latter fixt and visible to the eye, the former more invisible, transient and halituous, being contained in the Waters, I may conclude them by good consequence to be potable and most proper to be drank. Neither is the heat offensive, but amicable to the stomach, and doth not of it self, unless ingurgitation procure it, incline to Vomit. But because the drinking of the Wa∣ters hath so much obtain'd, I have the more par∣ticularly discours'd of that in the two following Chapt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the Use of the Bath-Water in Potion.</HEAD>
<P>HAving in the close of the former Chapter de∣bated and determin'd in short the Question, Whether the Bath-water may be safely used inward∣ly, and on good grounds carried it in the Affirma∣tive: The next Thing I am to proceed to, is, The manner how, and what course is to be taken by those that would use it so as to find benefit thereby. But before I treat of this, I shall enervate one grand Objection, and then give some preparatory directi∣ons for the better information, and greater benefit of the Patient.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="objection">
<HEAD>An OBJECTION.</HEAD>
<P>It may then be said; That the Bath-Water, ac∣cording to present discoveries, containing those In∣gredients that may be prejudicial to the Body, the use of them in potion may not seem to be safe, and the best way to decry the internal use, is to Anato∣mize their body, and declare their Contents; some of which being gritty, and of a Lapideous nature, may obstruct the mesentery, milky veins, and other passages, and conduce much to the heaping up a fa∣bulous matter in the Body, and thereby give occasi∣on to the intolerable excruciations of the Stone and Gout, besides the foundation it may lay for other distempers; others being of a relaxing and effemi∣nating nature, may have no good effect and influence upon the Nervous parts, especially the Stomach and
<PB N="107" REF="72"/> intestines, through which they pass; and therefore this use of the Waters seems rather to be avoided, and the inconveniences arising in probability from some parts <HI>non</HI>-saline, may be thought much to overbear the advantages expected from the Salts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>The ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>To this, I think the Substance of all that can be objected, I return this Answer;</P>
<P>That the supposed Culpable parts in and about the Contents of the Bath-water, being only three, Grit, Bitumen and Sulphur, the former, though in the greatest proportion, is so finely wrought and intimately mixed with the Body of the Waters, that in truth it cannot deserve that name, and there∣fore I call it so in relation to the more brown and gritty, appearing on Evaporation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Obs.</HI> 83.</NOTE> as I have else∣where observ'd; this then in the Waters that are drank being soft and impalpabable, and no magiste∣ry more finely pulveriz'd, must pass in Conjunction with the Water through all its Meanders; neither is the stay usually so long in the Body, as to occasion any fear of a Separation, which probably may be if they pass not well, and therein chiefly, I suppose, to lye the danger, the natural heat being not so vio∣lent, but of a more moderate and even tenour, and too weak to make an analysis of the Water in so short a time, or dissolve its body, as the fire doth, but having discharged its office, is discharged also by the usual ways of Evacuation, if the Water stay not in the Body too long.</P>
<P>Besides, The benefit of this Insipid magistery may not be a little; for if the acrimony of the blood be abated, and sharp humours allay'd, miti∣gated
<PB N="108" REF="73"/> and dulcifi'd, as the Experience of many per∣sons, the two Summers last past especially seem to testifie; I know nothing else in the Waters I can attribute this effect with greater justice to, than this impalpable powder, which like Coral and Pearls, being in themselves gritty and insipid, are known to produce the same effects without preju∣dice to the body, by imbibing the Acrimony, or altering the property of those humors they are found to allay. I confess indeed, some expecta∣tion might in reason be of a fermentation within, as by the means of this powder, in good part▪ there probably hath been without in the Waters them∣selves, according to my Hypothesis mentioned in the former Chapter, if the Powder were separated and immediately mixed with acids in the Bowels, Stomach, Spleen, or elsewhere, upon which, Eru∣ctations, Inflations, and other inconveniences might ensue; but the Water passing quickly off, and there being not that constant supply as underground, nor proportionable acids neither, as may be there, no such ill effects can reasonably be fear'd, nor yet have been observ'd.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Bitumen,</HI> either Liquid or Solid, the first of which is chiefly condemned by Mineral Writers, no inconvenience can arise from that, in regard I do not conceive it mixed, or indeed capable of mixing with the body of the Waters, but is at some certain times eructed from the Springs, chiefly in the Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> it ascends, being driven through the Waters, without mixture, to the surface, and there remains as a Scum, which taken off and dried burns like Stone-pitch, and is noted elsewhere:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Obs. <HI>100.</HI></NOTE> So that the quantity being in∣considerable to any other of the Minerals, and the times of breeding and appearing not constant, with
<PB N="109" REF="73"/> an incapacity of mixing with the body of the Wa∣ters, otherwise certainly it would not ascend and float on the surface as we find it doth: these things, I say, considered, I cannot but think it strange, the Learned Dr. <HI>Jorden</HI> should assert these Baths to be Bituminous <HI>à praedominio,</HI> or consist principally of Bitumen, which I shall hereafter make appear to be but a less principal Principle, and rather an ap∣purtenance to, than an Ingredient in the waters. So much also I must further say, That the swim∣ming of a Bituminous substance on the surface of the waters; the shrivelling of the tops of the fingers in the Bath; and the bare smell of Sulphur by the Baths-side; are no masculine foundations for as∣serting those Principles, and making <HI>that</HI> the great∣est ingredient in the waters, that is not capable of mixing with them.</P>
<P>Whereas <HI>Sulphur</HI> (the third Ingredient of Dr. <HI>Jorden,</HI> and least proportionable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B. <HI>Ch.</HI> 16. <HI>p.</HI> 150.</NOTE> affirming the Baths to consist principally of Bitumen, with Nitre and some Sulphur) is in much greater proportion than the Bitumen mentioned but now, and contains, I judge, near a fourth part of the courser Contents, the result of evaporation, for so much or there∣bouts is lost in Calcination, this, I say, though much in quantity, cannot relax or effeminate, either by fattiness or otherwise, as some Authors pretend; for, whatever it may have of that, 'tis certainly so much alter'd by the other Ingredients into whose bosom it is taken, and to which it is so nearly u∣nited, that nothing of that nature doth appear at any time, and is in nothing discovered more than its inflammability. We ought therefore here to expect the known vertues and benefits of Sulphur, to befriend the Lungs, to comfort and cherish weak parts, and do all those good offices we experience
<PB N="110" REF="74"/> in a Composition though made of many things be∣sides, rather than to imagine the Water of the Foun∣tain <HI>Salmacis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Salmacis,</HI> fons Cariae limpidissi∣mus, juxta <HI>Halicar∣nassium;</HI> eo nomine olim malè audiens, quòd la∣vantium in eo, aut ex eo bibenti∣um corpora effoemina∣ret. <HI>Ste∣phanus.</HI></NOTE> to be continued hither, or be fright∣ed with any <HI>Sardanapalian</HI> nature in Sulphur, which may create inconveniences we know not what. But if any person, notwithstanding what hath been said to the contrary, may be in some suspicion of any no∣cument from the Sulphur, he may have a Salt made out of the Waters to be dissolved in it, in which Sulphur is not concern'd, and so the Waters may be drank in lesser proportion.</P>
<P>Having therefore combated these three supposed Enemies to the Waters inward use, and found them weak and insufficient to maintain the opposition they pretend to, the greater confirmation will accrue from the consideration of the three-fold encourage∣ment, arising from the mixture of the triple Salt, Nitre, Salt and Vitriol, the further enlargement on which I shall at present forbear, and now give some few directions for the Patient's benefit I men∣tioned before.</P>
<P>The first of which is, That 'tis very necessary the Body be well prepar'd before the Waters be ta∣ken, and consequently that good advice be had whe∣ther it be proper or no, for the inconsiderate use of any thing must be very prejudicial; and the best rea∣son why many Effects are not produc'd, is because in reason they could not be expected. This prepa∣ration must be made, not slightly with a little Bath-water and Salt, Syrup of Roses, and Manna, and such like alimentary Medicines, but with proper, effectual, and frequent Purgations, as the knowing Physician will think requisite sometimes. For what Impurities are <HI>in primis viis,</HI> the Stomach, Inte∣stines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will certainly with the Current be car∣ried further into the Body, defile the blood, and
<PB N="111" REF="74"/> thereby create an Iliad of evils; whereas if the Bo∣dy be well prepar'd, the Water hath besides a cleaner passage, a more free one too, unto the parts it must relieve.</P>
<P>'Tis also less beneficial for the Patient to drink the Water in the Bath, and contrary to the rules and directions of intelligent Physicians; but if thirst be troublesom, somewhat may be taken to al∣lay that, and half an hour before rising a quantity may be drank, and the rest in bed, if occasion shall require; otherwise to set aside some time for drink∣ing alone, and never, during that time, to use the Bath at all, is what may give both Uses due liberty to exert their operations, and not cramp or supplant one another, as they often do when made use of together.</P>
<P>It is likewise requisite that a good course of Diet be observed in the use of the Waters, both as to Meat and Drink; that dinner be of meats of light and easie digestion, at twelve or one a clock, when the Waters have made a considerable pass; and that supper be in good time, that the Body may be clear against the next morning again.</P>
<P>The best time for drinking is in the morning ear∣ly, from the Pump, at the place it self, if it may be, otherwise, if near, at home, very warm, with a quarter of an hours walking after every Pint or Quart, at utmost; arising from three to six pints, four to eight, or five to ten, as the Body will bear, for no set gage can be given; and the best Rule is, that it ought to be taken <HI>pro Tolerantia,</HI> every one as they are able to bear, without ingurgitation, or relucting again. The number of days, 7, 14, 21, or a month, after which time I have observ'd the like effects not to be produc'd, as in the intermedi∣ate space, and therefore none ought to use it longer at one season.</P>

<P>To give a greater security and Credit to the drinking these Waters, with which I shall conclude this Chapter, it may be noted, That, besides the common Discourse of things within the memory of
<PB N="114" REF="76"/> man, the Bath-water hath been order'd to be drank above an hundred years ago;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jon. Bath. <HI>Aide. lib.</HI> 4. <HI>fol.</HI> 28.</NOTE> for I find in a Physi∣cian that writ concerning them, <HI>A.D.</HI> 1572. among other things, these directions:</P>
<P>About an hour after Sun-rising in the morning, drink the Water out of the Spring; the Body afore purged, the digestion fulfilled, and the Bath first cleansed, remaining clean six hours before.</P>
<P>So much of the Water as shall not be grievous to the Stomach may be drank.</P>
<P>The Water being drank, the Patient must walk gently a few paces in a temperate air.</P>
<P>By which it appears, how careful they were then of preparing the Body, and having the Water pure, which ought not to be less regarded now, other∣wise the danger will be more, and the benefit less, according to the right or wrong use of the Waters. That this was discontinu'd, no better reason, I think, can be given, than the Humour of the Times, to which also, a want of a due method in drinking, and a true understanding of the nature of the Wa∣ters, may much conduce.</P>

<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="115" REF="76"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of the Virtues of the Bath-water taken inwardly.</HEAD>
<P>THat the Water, and consequently the Salt ex∣tracted from it, and dissolved in it, may not be defrauded of their just Commendation internally used by way of Potion, as well as by Bathing, or Lotion, outwardly, and that it may be rightly made use of in a due way and manner, without expecting more from it than in reason is to be done; I shall give a short Account of the Distempers in which it may be profitable, and used with advan∣tage.</P>
<P>And first, in General, I conceive it very proper in all Diseases or Symptoms, that require cooling, cleansing, opening, or gentle Evacuation; under which Heads are comprehended many Maladies, which I shall but briefly touch on, and leave the fuller discovery of its Virtues to experience, and a longer use.</P>
<P>I shall begin with the Stomach, both in regard it is the part it first descends into, and also, because in righting that, it is a general Benefactor to the whole Body, the use of the Stomach being of absolute ne∣cessity to every part, without which there can be no supply.</P>
<P>It must therefore infallibly cleanse this useful Re∣ceptacle from any impurities lodging in the Bottom or Plicatures thereof, (which may render what is taken in more foul) and prepare it the better for digestion of the food, on which depends the main∣tenance
<PB N="116" REF="77"/> of the lesser Universe, conducing much this way to the making better Chyle, purer blood, and more clear and active spirits, the wheels and ma∣chines of all sense and motion.</P>
<P>The next Advantage is, That it procures an Ap∣petite, and makes those that drink it receive and enjoy their food with more delight and satisfaction. This is generally known to all that use it, and is ef∣fected partly by removing what lines the inner Coat of the Stomach with too much Viscosity, with which the fibres, and nervous filaments, the Organs of Sensation, are obstructed; partly by an Esurine quality residing in the Salt, provoking the desire of Sustenance, which we call Hunger, by its immedi∣ate application to the parts mentioned before. And in this Esurine Quality it doth exceed Common Water, of which <HI>Hippocrates</HI> hath written, That it makes men hungry; <HI>viz.</HI> by its washing and cleansing the Stomach, as is declared before; but this by the mixture of the Salt, is made more ef∣fectual.</P>
<P>A third Convenience is, That it allays Thirst, which is often very troublesom, and sometimes dan∣gerous to take in Liquors to suppress it, that may create farther disturbances in the Body, and prove more offensive; whereas this, by its cooling and moistening nature, is the best Remedy that can be provided, and that in no great proportion neither, as hath been often experimented.</P>
<P>It is also of good use in the Heart-burning, or <HI>Cardialgia,</HI> occasioned by the sharpness and acri∣mony of a bilious humour, vellicating the nerves and membranes of the upper orifice of the Sto∣mach, called by the Ancients, by reason of its great communication therewith, the Heart; which sharp and acrimonious humour it alters, washes off, and
<PB N="117" REF="77"/> at last evacuates, upon which the Passion ceaseth, and ease doth ensue.</P>
<P>Also it clears by its immediate passage out of the Stomach, for some water, I suppose, doth pass that way, whatever obstructions are found in the Ves∣sels about the Stomach, relating either to that or the Caul, arising from the <HI>Vena Porta,</HI> and known commonly among Anatomists by the hard names of <HI>Venae Gastricae, Epiplociae,</HI> and <HI>Gastro-Epiplociae,</HI> conveying what is transmitted from the Celiack Ar∣tery, to the Liver, and so by the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> to the Heart, according to the undoubted and esta∣blished doctrine of the Circulation.</P>
<P>Moreover, It is of singular use in all Fluxes, whether with blood, or without; Diarrhea's, Dy∣senteries, or bloody Urine; not that it hath any strong astringent quality, which oftentimes is pre∣judicial, but by its absterging and cleansing virtue, and gently evacuative withal, it allays Acrimony, sweeps away pungent particles, and discharges them by the draught. However, if astringent Medicines shall at any time be judged necessary, the Cure will be facilitated, and more speedily performed, if the Water be drank, or used by Clyster, or both ways made use of, before they are advised, which will be a good preparatory to other Remedies.</P>
<P>It is also good in the Colick, on the account be∣fore specified, and with the addition of its Heat; insomuch that those that drink the Bath-water, are observed to break more wind than other people, and find great relief in that case.</P>
<P>It is proper also in the Distemper that is com∣monly, though improperly, called the Heat of the Liver, when the Face is red, pimpled, and the Bo∣dy afflicted with cholerick and pustulous Eruptions, having its foundation in the blood, which the Wa∣ter
<PB N="118" REF="78"/> attemperates, and brings down to a just degree, proportionable to the Natural and Balsamick Tem∣per of its prime Composure.</P>
<P>It opens likewise the obstructions of the Liver, Spleen and Gall, and therefore proper in the Spleen, so far as it ariseth from that Cause, and not impro∣per, but very advantagious, in the Scurvy, Jaundise, and obstructions of the Mesentery, which, if the Waters pass, must be much advantage to the Body; in regard there most commonly lyes the <HI>Sentina Corporis,</HI> or Sink of the whole, which is cleansed this way, as the Sewers in <HI>Bristow,</HI> by St. <HI>David</HI>'s Flood.</P>
<P>It is also very beneficial, if moderately taken, in the Gravel of the Kidneys, or any Gravel or Phlegm obstructing them, or the Ureters, which it undeni∣ably cleanseth, and prevents Concretions, which may afterward terminate in Tophes and Stones; so that 'tis a good preservative against the Stone, and will dissolve what is not too firmly impacted, which may be discover'd, if the water pass not freely that way.</P>
<P>It is also of incomparable use in the <HI>Diabetes,</HI> or pissing Disease, which is usually attended with a great drought, which it allays above any thing; and, the quantity moderated for fear of pissing too much, produces great effects, as hath been experi∣enced of late by a Person of Honour.</P>
<P>I doubt not also to commend it in the Dropsie, but care must be taken that it pass well away, other∣wise it may prove more prejudicial than advan∣tagious. The like also may be said of the Gout.</P>
<P>'Tis beneficial likewise in the Whites in Women, and what is somewhat consequential, prepares them for Conception; so that in some kinds of Barren∣ness,
<PB N="119" REF="78"/> no more effectual Medicine can be used. <HI>Pli∣nius dicit, Aquarum aliquas sterilitatem foeminarum abolere, &amp; conceptus ipsis representare, sicut</HI> Sinues∣sanas <HI>in</HI> Campania; Thespiarum <HI>fontis in</HI> Boeotia; Elati <HI>fluminis in</HI> Arcadia; <HI>qui effectus significant hu∣jusmodi Aquas esse Nitrosas: Etenim hae vulvam, quo∣niam eam abstergunt, Conceptioni faciunt habilem,</HI> saith <HI>Georg. Agricola;</HI> and again, a little after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Nit. Eor. quae effl ex Ter∣ra, lib. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Nitrosae vulvam ad Concipiendum aptam faciunt. Nitrous Waters dispose the Matrix to Conception.</HI> So that I question not but that outwardly and inwardly used, but chiefly the latter, these Waters are very advantagious in that condition.</P>
<P>The inward use is also very profitable in all foul∣ness of the Blood, the Itch, Scabs, Leprosie, and the Worms.</P>
<P>For the Distempers of the Head it may be less useful, being somewhat remote, yet in many not prejudicial; for the fore-quoted Author says, speaking of Nitrous Waters; <HI>Capita, succis frigid s qui mentem obtundunt, repleta exiccantes &amp; robo∣rantes, tandem mentem denuo acuere, &amp; sanitati re∣stituere possunt. Those Heads that are filled with cold humours, which dull the mind, Nitrous Waters, by their drying and corroborating faculty, do relieve; and sharpening the understanding, restore to perfect health.</HI> Yet in regard this may be referred to the general Head of Obstructions, as before, I shall say no more at this time of the Virtues of the Water in parti∣cular: only add what <HI>Kircher</HI> says of Nitrous Wa∣ters in his Chapter of that Subject: <HI>When Nitre is</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">These Virtues are proportio∣nably in all Nitrous Waters, according as they more or less parti∣cipate of that Mine∣ral.</NOTE> <HI>predominant, it makes the Water that hath imbib'd it powerful in operation; enables it to correct an ill habit of Body, which such as are phlegmatick are prone to; it looses the Belly; is good in the diseases of the Nerves, and for such as are subject to defluxions
<PB N="120" REF="79"/> upon the Lungs; heals the Itch, and other diseases of the Skin; cures the ringing of the Ears, dropt into them; and, in a word, makes it to be of an emi∣nent absterging property.</HI> Where it may be noted, That whereas this Author affirms Nitrous Waters to be good for such as are subject to defluxions upon the Lungs, and consequently for those that are weakned by a consumptive disposition, in extenua∣ted persons; it is easie to determine to which of the Minerals chiefly we may attribute that great advan∣tage an Eminent Chirurgion of this Nation hath lately found by drinking the Waters, who from a thin body, and hoarse voice, hath now recover'd a plump Corpulency, clear speech, and good habit of Body and Lungs, to the great credit and reputa∣tion of the Water.</P>
<P>For the satisfaction of those that desire to know which way the Water comes to the Kidneys and Bladder, whereby they may somewhat judg of the usefulness of the Water, and true extent of its operation; I shall briefly, for a close, discourse of that.</P>
<P>The Drink, or Water, which descends into the Stomach by the Gullet, passes thence, either imme∣diately by the Veins, that have a more immediate relation to the Stomach, Caul, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or mediately, by the lower orifice of the Stomach, called <HI>Pylorus,</HI> into the Guts, whence the most part passeth by the milky Veins to the <HI>Lumbar glandules,</HI> or Kernels of the Kidneys, ascribed to the Learned D. <HI>Th. Bartholine,</HI> Professor at <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> as the first inventer, and answering to the Receptacle of Chyle in <HI>Brutes;</HI> and partly, perhaps, by the Mesaraicks, passeth to the Liver. From those <HI>Glandules,</HI> or the Receptacle, some affirm that the Potulent mat∣ter passeth directly to the Emulgents and Kidneys;
<PB N="121" REF="79"/> but since this opinion seems not to be beyond dis∣pute, as I have noted elsewhere, I shall add no more as to that here, only admit, that the greatest share of it passes from the Receptacle or <HI>Glandules,</HI> by the milky veins of the Breast, into the right Ven∣tricle of the Heart, thence, through the Lungs, into the left, then into the great Artery, and so, by the Circular motion of the Blood, is carried to the emulgent Arteries, and discharged into the Kid∣neys, where, by reason of their fabrick, aptly ac∣commodated to the work of Straining, the Serum is separated from the Blood, and drops down by the Ureters, into the Bladder, whence through the <HI>Ʋrethra,</HI> or passage of the Yard, it again visiteth the open air, where I shall now leave it, as of no further use, till it come into the Urinal, and meet with some juggling and quacking Phy∣sician.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Of the Water of St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock, near <HI>Bristol.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving in the 12th. Chapter of this Discourse made some mention of this Water, as a neighbouring Water to <HI>Bathe,</HI> and supposed only a Continuation thither, which I did not think pro∣bable on the Reasons there alledged; it will not be altogether improper in this place, to treat a little more largely of that, which hath a name among the useful Mineral Waters of this Land.</P>
<P>As to the Principles of this Hot-Well Water, as 'tis usually call'd, without which the Reason of the Virtues can never be understood, they have been variously reported; what I have found on my own observation, I here declare.</P>
<P>On the Evaporation of two Gallons of the Wa∣ter, I had ℈v. of the Contents; of which ℈iv. were a reddish ferrugineous Earth, somewhat re∣sembling in colour, an Iron Ore, but in substance, very light and friable, with a mixture of a Lime-stone: The other ℈. which the Lixivium gave me, evaporated in Glass, seemed to be Alom, yet in re∣gard the Lime-stone may counterfeit Alom, especi¦ally when precipitated, I could not absolutely con∣clude it to be Aluminous.</P>
<P>To be a little better satisfied, I caused Mr. <HI>Ri∣chard Millechape,</HI> an industrious and skilful Apothe∣cary in <HI>Bristol,</HI> to evaporate one Hogshead of the Water of the Hot-Well, which he did in a furnace, first, to three or four Gallons, afterwards finished
<PB N="123" REF="80"/> it in an evaporating Glass, and sent me the Con∣tents, which were little wanting of ℥v ss. four Ounces of which were, on examination, that red, rusty colour'd Earth, mentioned before, and some∣what, though much less in quantity, more white.</P>
<P>Upon this <HI>non</HI>-Saline part, as I call it, to distin∣guish it from the Saline part that constitutes the Lixivium, being put into a Crucible and calcin'd, I observ'd: That the red Earth was not harder, but more friable, and lost its rusty colour, becoming more blew; but the white being cold, and mixed with fair water, did, upon the first injection, hiss, and afterwards dissolve, leaving the water white, and a Limy residence in the bottom of the Vessel I infused it in; and both white and blew, after infu∣sion, being dryed again, became very white and limy.</P>
<P>The other part being Saline imbibed into a Lixi∣vium, I evaporated away to half a Pint, and set∣ting it in a cool pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, found the next morning, it had shot into long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nall Stiria's, much resembling those of the Cross Bath here, to the quantity of ʒiii. the remaining part of the Liquor that did not shoot, I breath'd away, and had ℥i. of another kind of Salt, now under examination; so that the Saline part is here much exceeded by the <HI>non</HI>-Saline, to which it seems to bear proportionably not much more than a 5th. part, and to be contained accor∣ding to this Estimate, scarce twelve Grains in a Gallon, whereas that of <HI>Bathe</HI> hath about forty impure.</P>
<P>To give then a short Account of the Principles of this Water, I judg it to consist of Iron, a Nitro-Sulphureous Salt, and some Lime-stone, according to the proportions before deliver'd, and the Con∣tents
<PB N="124" REF="81"/> tents Saline, and <HI>non</HI>-Saline, to be, in all, near half as much as in the Waters of <HI>Bathe,</HI> where the Salts are a third, and here a fifth, or thereabout, as was mentioned before.</P>
<P>That very little of an acid is contained in these Waters, may appear from this, That neither the cold Water, nor a strong Lixivium made of the Salt, will either turn with Galls, or coagulate Milk; neither doth any thing glebous shew it self among the Shoots I have had yet.</P>
<P>What the other Salt is, which I have not yet ful∣ly examin'd, and tasts much Alcalizate, I do here promise to declare on another occasion: only for the present, which is all I shall say of the Principles of this Water now, To make it further evident, that this is Lime-stone, after the <HI>non</HI>-Saline part was well calcin'd, with a strong fire, in the water of that I decocted Sulphur, which it did dissolve, and was precipitated with a fetid smell, both by di∣still'd Vinegar, Spirit of Vitriol, and Oyl of Tar∣tar, in a considerable quantity.</P>
<P>This Water then though participating of the same Salts with the Water of <HI>Bathe,</HI> but not in that proportion, cannot be expected to be as advantagi∣ous in the same Distempers, as it is less hot; but containing so much of Iron, hath that advantage above it, and may be as effectual as <HI>Tunbridg</HI> Wa∣ters, in any Diseases that Water is proper for, and, for ought I know, do every way as well.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Of <HI>Castle-Cary</HI> Water.</HEAD>
<P>THE Mineral Water in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> common∣ly known by the name of <HI>Castle-Cary,</HI> or <HI>Alford</HI>-water, being of a quick working nature, and by some persons made use of at <HI>Bathe,</HI> deserves also an Examination; which I the rather do here, in regard it may confirm and illustrate what I for∣merly discourst of, concerning the Nature and Vir∣tues of the Baths of <HI>Bathe,</HI> to which it may be also very subservient.</P>
<P>By Tryals therefore, according as I had done on the Waters of <HI>Bathe</HI> and <HI>Bristol,</HI> I find it to consist of some parts Saline, some <HI>non</HI>-Saline. The Sa∣line part is chiefly Nitrous, Nitre being almost double to the other Salts; and therefore I judg this Water, <HI>Nitrosa à praedominio;</HI> Nitre appearing in a nauseous taste, apparent bitterness, cooling, pe∣netrating, and shooting into as long and firm Sti∣ria's, as I have ever seen in the King's, or Hot Baths.</P>
<P>The other Salt, is common brown Salt, arising, I conceive, from a small Rock or Mine, of that sort of Salt in the ground about the Spring. This, I said, is little more than half the proportion of the former, and shews it self in proper Squares or Cubes, peculiar to that Salt, the Nitre shooting first, and this Salt last of all.</P>
<P>The parts <HI>non</HI>-Saline are likewise double:</P>
<P>First, A red Gritt, arising also from a Rock of that colour, and is the proper Gritt of the ground;
<PB N="126" REF="82"/> next the Earth under the Sward, of which I am now to treat a little. The Earth under the surface of the ground is first, a stiff blew Marl: under that a white Clay: and last of all the Red Rock.</P>
<P>The Earth, the second part <HI>non</HI>-Saline contain∣ed in the Water, is chiefly the latter, I mean the white Clay, which with the Rocky Sediment, makes up near the proportion of the brown Salt, or rather somewhat more, the Rock bearing not a fourth part to the Clay.</P>
<P>Out of 12 Gallons of this Water wanting 3 Pints, I had ℥18. ʒvi ss. of the Contents, besides dross and scum in the depuration of the Water, of which ℥iii. Nitre; ℥i. ʒvi. brown Salt; and ℥ii. Earth and Rock. ℥iii. gr. 30. lost in working. So that ℥ss. of Salt is contained in every Gallon of the Water, or proportionably ʒss. in every Pint, or between 20 and 30 Grains, of which two parts are Nitre, and one brown Salt.</P>
<P>Note, That out of the quantity of Water men∣tioned before, I had of the pure refined Salt only ℥iv. 2 Drams, and 40 Grains, in a Gallon; 20 Grains in a Pint.</P>
<P>This Water then must be of good use to cool, cleanse, penetrate and attenuate gross humours; allay acrimony; attemperate and suppress undue fermentation. Good in the Spleen, Scurvy, Jaun∣dise, and all obstructions of the Mesentery and Bowels, having all those properties <HI>Kircher</HI> gives of Nitrous Waters, mentioned <HI>Chap.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>It cleanses the Kidneys and Ureters, and is very beneficial in the Stone, moving by Siege, Urine and Sweat, and that very effectually, in regard the Minerals are so strongly imbibed, which makes it better to be mixed with the Water from the Springs
<PB N="127" REF="82"/> at <HI>Bathe,</HI> which, having the same Salts are less, operative, because less impregnated.</P>
<P>And thus having discours'd of Three Mineral Waters, by the Salts, the main of their Compositi∣on, somewhat related, St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s <HI>Hot Well,</HI> less impregnated; <HI>Bathe,</HI> more; and <HI>Castle-Cary Wa∣ter,</HI> in the highest degree; I hope the best use will be made of them all. And so I take leave of this Subject for the present, referring the Curious to more Particulars, concerning the principal part of my Design, to the ensuing <HI>Century of Observa∣tions.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Lives and Character OF THE PHYSICIANS OF BATHE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING hitherto discoursed of the Waters and City, I think it not improper here to give some ac∣count of the PHYSICIANS of <HI>Bathe,</HI> both in regard they have been as eminent as any, I think, in any part of <HI>England,</HI> and also for the most part have been continued in a <HI>Series</HI> of Judicious, able men, well qualified and graduated in Universities, which deserve the greatest and most particular mention here. And although I would have wish∣ed, that they had signaliz'd themselves on the place,
<PB N="164" REF="101"/> by some other way besides their practice, by which more remarkable Memorials would have remained to posterity, and been a good occasion of my Com∣mendation; yet since they were pleased, for rea∣sons best known to themselves, to pass by the thing that best deserv'd their consideration, I mean the nature of the Waters, (only one or two having written of them) I shall not make them the like requital, but give what account I either know or can procure, and gather up the fragments of their Memories that remain. And first of Doctor <HI>Reu∣ben Sherwood.</HI></P>

<P>AT the same time also flourished Dr. <HI>John Sherwood,</HI> graduated in the University of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who died two years after Dr. <HI>Elton,</HI> and was buried in the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> in the South-Isle, as appears by this indiffe∣rent poetry on a piece of Brass against the Wall; in which he is recommended to posterity with this bare Title: <HI>Joannes Sherwood Doctor Med.

<P>The Verses these;

<HEAD>4. Doctor <HI>Edward Jorden.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COncerning Dr. <HI>Jorden,</HI> whose Name is yet fresh, and memory very acceptable to all that knew him, having left the deserved Reputation of a Learned, Candid, and Sober Physician: I have written something heretofore, and shall only here again mention some particulars more nearly relating to his person and condition.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Jorden,</HI> I understand, was a Gentleman of a good Family, and, being a younger Brother, designed for a Profession, for which when he had accomplish't himself, by a convenient course of studies in his own Country, he travelled abroad to see the Manners and Customes of the Universities be∣yond Sea, and having spent some time there, espe∣cially at <HI>Padua,</HI> where he took the degree of Doctor in Physick, returned home, practiced at <HI>London,</HI> became an eminently solid and rational Philosopher and Physician, and one of that famous and learned Society, <HI>The Kings Colledge of the Physicians there.</HI></P>
<P>He had a natural inclination to Mineral works, and was at great charges about the ordering of Alom, which succeeding not according to expecta∣tion, he was thereby much prejudic'd in his estate, as appears from these words in the seventh Chap∣ter of his Treatise of <HI>Nat. Bathes</HI> and <HI>Mineral Waters;</HI> Now I come to <HI>Allum (Indignum vex ipsa jubet renovare dolorem,)</HI> the greatest debtor I have, and I the greatest benefactor to it, as shall appear when I think fit to publish the artifice thereof. For the Patent or Grant for the profit of the Alom works, which he reasonably did expect,
<PB N="167" REF="102"/> fell afterwards, I know not how, to Sr. <HI>Arthur In∣grams</HI> lot, although the Doctor also had a good share in the affection of King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>After he had practised sometime in <HI>London,</HI> he settled at <HI>Bathe,</HI> where living many years, and ha∣ving Children not a few, his conversation was so sweet, his carriage so obliging, and his life so an∣swerable to the port and dignity of the faculty he profest, that he had the applause of the Learned, the respect of the Rich, the prayers of the Poor, and the love of all. But living a studious and se∣dentary life, which might encourage his two grand distempers he labours under, the Stone and Gout, departed this life in the great Climacterical year of his age 63, and of our Saviours Nativity 1632, lying buried in the South Isle of the Abbey Church, but without a Monument, or any Inscription. And thus much for Dr. <HI>Jorden</HI> who was the first Physi∣cian that writ any thing of the Waters, that resi∣ded on the place.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>5. Doctor <HI>Edward Lapworth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DOctor <HI>Lapworth</HI> was bred up in the famous University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and a member of that flourishing Society, <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge there, where he proceeded Doctor in a solemn Act in the year 1611, with two eminent Physicians his contemporaries, Dr. <HI>Simon Baskervill,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Tho∣mas Clayton.</HI></P>
<P>His correspondence was good with <HI>Jorden,</HI> be∣ing both at one time practicioners on the place, as appears from the verses he hath prefixt to Dr. <HI>Jor∣den</HI> in <HI>Laudem operis.</HI> He had only one Daughter, who being married out of this place, caused his
<PB N="168" REF="103"/> Name to be extinct here, lying buried in the North Isle of the Abbey Church in <HI>Bathe,</HI> and deserv'd a better Epitaph than this <HI>English</HI> Inscription cut round the Stone that lies over him:
<Q>Here lieth the Body of <HI>Edward Lap∣worth,</HI> Doctor in Physick, who deceased <HI>24</HI> of <HI>May, An. Dom. 1636.</HI></Q> His age I guess was near 60. As to his gifts of Mind they are doubtless beyond exception, having been so well educated, and a professour, if I mi∣stake not, in <HI>Oxford,</HI> which gave some interruption to his practice here; being in body not tall, fat and corpulent, which inclin'd him the more to take his ease.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>6. Doctor <HI>Tobias Venner.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DOctor <HI>Tobias Venner</HI> was born at <HI>Petherton</HI> near <HI>Bridgwater</HI> in the County of <HI>Somerset,</HI> of honest Parents, who sent him to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he was made Doctor in Physick to the great repute of his own family, and <HI>Alban Hall,</HI> in the year 1613. He lived many years at <HI>Bathe,</HI> and had the Name of a plain, charitable Physician, but no ready man at stating a Case, which occasion'd one, a little tartly, to say, <HI>That whereas some other men had,</HI> (according to the common Phrase) <HI>Guts in their Brains;</HI> Dr. Venners <HI>Brains were in his Guts.</HI> However he found the right way to write a book called <HI>Via recta ad vitam longam,</HI> wherein is this memorable Observation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">V.R. <HI>ad</HI> V.L <HI>p.</HI> 59, <HI>l.</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>That a Gammon of Bacon is of the same nature with the rest of the Hog.</HI> He wrote also a little discourse of <HI>Bathe,</HI> thereby ex∣pressing
<PB N="169" REF="103"/> his good will to the Waters, which had it been bigger he should have had more thanks, but being very small, must be contented with the like commendation.</P>
<P>He lived to see both his Wives, and all his Children die before him, and left his Estate to the Relations by his second wife now in <HI>Bathe:</HI>

<P>The Author of this Epitaph, for who made it is uncertain, seems rather to me to have been a Divine than a Physician, for which conjecture I have these Reasons:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the form thereof is borrowed from one made on Doctor <HI>Daniel Featley,</HI> now in <HI>Lambeth,</HI> as I could clearly make appear by comparing the Expressions, as I have sometime done, and for the satisfaction of any that desire it, may without a journey thither, be read, <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> in Doctor <HI>Featley</HI>'s Book against the Anabaptists, where it is copied, and whence it was probably taken. Now a Physician, I conceive, would never have taken pattern from a Divine, to make an Epitaph on his own faculty, which is proper for a Divine, being more his concern.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Venerandus</HI> is a word suiting better with a Divine, and a more proper Epithete than for a Physician, as <HI>Reverendus &amp; Venerabilis;</HI> and is most likely to have come from one whose tongue was tipp'd with such language, who vvould rather chuse to run the risque of an impropriety in speech, than lose the honour of a jingling quib∣ble.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis probable this Epitaph was made near a Church, and that either when the Bells were go∣ing,
<PB N="172" REF="105"/> or else in imitation of that sound, as may ap∣pear from the Chime of <HI>Hoc</HI> and <HI>Illo, Horum</HI> and <HI>Illorum, His</HI> and <HI>Illis,</HI> with the great pains taken to observe the Cadences so exactly as is done.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the fourth place, the word <HI>plus</HI> is some∣what suspicious, by which vve must understand <HI>Minus,</HI> otherwise, <HI>Nec plus defuit sanis quam aegris paupe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibus,</HI> may bear this sense, and not well any other, <HI>that the Doctor was wanting both to the one and the other,</HI> vvhen the Author, I suppose, meant <HI>he was wanting to neither.</HI> Now <HI>Plus</HI> is a fit word for a divine, and might the sooner have been made choice of for this, that 'tis the origin or sourse of the word <HI>Plurality.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly and lastly; No Physician would have used that Expression, <HI>Theoriam unius anni confir∣mans Praxi</HI> 85, by vvhich Doctor <HI>Venner</HI> is made a Practicioner from his Mothers womb, and longer a Physician than St. <HI>John Baptist</HI> was a Prophet, which in it self being somewhat harsh, though ta∣ken in relation to his course of life, vvhere the life of that expression lay, can proceed from none but a Divine, vvho oftentimes will be nibbling at Physick.</P>
<P>Again, for I reserved something for a second part, That expression is justly liable to exception, <HI>Quod Charitatem solus hic tamdiu exercuisset,</HI> where∣in Dr. <HI>Venner</HI> is made the only Charitable person in <HI>Bathe,</HI> whereas there vvere then living, besides some Charitable Inhabitants of another stamp, three or four more Physicians there, whose Charity, though perhaps not so rampant as Dr. <HI>Venners,</HI> was enough both in food and Physick to call the truth of that expression into question.</P>
<PB N="173" REF="105"/>
<P>And although this necessary requisite to every good Christian that is in a condition so to do, be not with that ostentation put into the Epitaph of Dr. <HI>Baue.</HI> Yet I have heard a good Character of him also in this kind, and do know many poor persons now alive in <HI>Bathe,</HI> that will affirm they have re∣ceived good Alms and Physick too from his Cha∣rity. I confess <HI>Tamdiu</HI> may do some service here, to this effect, that Dr. <HI>Venner</HI> vvas the only man that was charitable here so long, which, though it may abate somewhat, doth not take off the arro∣gance of <HI>Solus,</HI> which, like the Sun, never appears without reflection. I vvrite not this to derogate from Dr. <HI>Venner,</HI> or disparage the Epitaph, having that esteem for both they do deserve; but as the Devil, we say, should have his due, so I think, 'tis not fitting a Saint should have more. And thus much for the Charitable Dr. <HI>Venner.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>7. Dr. <HI>Ralph Bayly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DOctor <HI>Ralph Bayly,</HI> of whom I am next to treat, was well known to all his Collegues of <HI>New-Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxon,</HI> where he had his Edu∣cation, to be as stout a man as that Society hath yielded, having in his Temper an equal mixture of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI> or rather, born under the <HI>praedominium</HI> of <HI>Mars,</HI> as he hath often evidenced when he long'd for Venison, though sometimes bought at a dear rate.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Bayly</HI> was born in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> descended of a good Family in that County, whose Coat-armour is, <HI>In a field Gules, three Martlets;</HI> or, <HI>A Chief Vairy Argent of Azure.</HI> Having spent some time in <HI>Winchester</HI> School, that fruitful Seminary of
<PB N="174" REF="106"/> Learning, he was in due time transplanted to <HI>New-Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he gradually proceeded with good applause, till he arrived at the per∣fection of Doctor of Physick, which hapned in the year 1618. By two Wives, the one a <HI>Quintin,</HI> the other a <HI>Hungerford,</HI> both comely Women; he had issue both Male and Female.</P>
<P>His eldest Son <HI>Walter,</HI> my intimate friend and acquaintance, he educated in the University, in <HI>Magdalen</HI> Hall in <HI>Oxford;</HI> but finding his genius not so much inclining him to Learning, though he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great admirer of it, and had much respect for any Scholar that was truly so, and had Learn∣ing enough himself to render him facetious, and as good company as any man could wish; finding, I say, his genius not so much bent to study, he rather chose a gentile Education, and being very acceptable to all persons of Quality, especially the Gentry of <HI>Hampshire,</HI> in particular Sr. <HI>Richard Gifford</HI> of <HI>Sumburne, Henry Ludlow</HI> of <HI>Tadley</HI> Esquire, and many others, where he used to hunt and recreate with all the kindness imaginable; at last, on the death of his Father took to the Estate, and settled at <HI>Bathe</HI> in the same house the Doctor enjoy'd, where he lived plentifully many years, and saw an end of all his Generation, till at length, for Death is the end as well of the good Compani∣on as the Sot, of a lingring distemper, being much obstructed in the Mesentery and Urinary passages; he ended this life about the sixtieth year of his age, on the 15 day of <HI>November, An. Dom.</HI> 1672, and is buried in the Abbey Church in <HI>Bathe.</HI></P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Bayly</HI> is further remarkable in this, that he is the only man save one, of any Physician that lived here; that had a Son of his own Profession, which was Mr. <HI>Thomas Bayly,</HI> by his second Wife
<PB N="175" REF="106"/> Mrs. <HI>Hungerford,</HI> an Ingenious man, and good Phy∣sician, of whom his Brother would often speak with much affection and respect, who in the be∣ginning of the Wars, when no Acts were kept, was with many others, created Doctor <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1642, and practising at <HI>Newbury</HI> in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> with good success and reputation, died of a high infection in the prime of his years, not long after. He was much encouraged to the Delivery of Women, be∣ing fitted for that service both by art and na∣ture.</P>
<P>It is also further observable in Doctor <HI>Ralph Bayly,</HI> that although he had good practise, and pre∣scribed to many Patients, yet such was his good Temper of Nature, and Temperance withal, that he never took any Physick himself, or made use of the Bath, being never sick in all his life; which fell the heavier on him, according to the vulgar obser∣vation; for going from his house at <HI>Bathe</HI> to ano∣ther he had at <HI>Widcombe,</HI> a mile distant, he was suddenly taken with a great faintness, insomuch as he was constrained to call at a Neighbours house before he came to his own, to desire something to refresh him, using these words, <HI>as God shall mend me,</HI> which was his usual saying, <HI>I am ill,</HI> and presently departed, and was buried at <HI>Widcombe,</HI> Nov. 16. 1645.</P>
<P>He was a proper, Comely person, charitable, and well read in the Ancient learning, witness a good Collection of old Authors, well markt with his own Hand, now in my possession. And so much for Dr. <HI>Ralph Bayly,</HI> being the only man, I think, that ever liv'd and dy'd without pain.</P>

<HEAD>9. Doctor <HI>Samuel Baue.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WIth Doctor <HI>Baue</HI> I had the happiness to have a particular acquaintance, being the eldest Physician on the place at my coming hither, in the year 1667, and although many things are observable in his life and practise, having lived to see compleated fourscore years, yet I shall con∣tract my self as much as may be, in regard I would not be tedious in a thing that ought to be brief.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Baue</HI> was born in the remarkable year 1588, at <HI>Colen</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> of a good Family, as appears by a good Coat of Arms brought thence, vvhence he came young for <HI>England,</HI> on occasion, as he told me, of his being Tutor to Sr. <HI>Thomas Ed∣mond</HI>'s Son, which Sr. <HI>Thomas</HI> vvas Ambassadour
<PB N="177" REF="107"/> from King <HI>James</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> vvhere Mr. <HI>Baue</HI> was then a Student, in which Family, and about the Court, he continued some time vvith an honourable allowance from the Knight, but chiefly bent his studies to the faculty of Physick, in order to which he afterwards became a Member of that great Body and famous Society of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford;</HI> vvhere he proceeded Doctor in Physick in the year 1628, vvith three other Phy∣sicians that vvent out vvith him, <HI>viz.</HI> Dr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Speed</HI> of St. <HI>Johns,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Saunders</HI> of <HI>Oriel,</HI> at a very splendid Act.</P>
<P>The first beginning of his publick Practise vvas at <HI>Glocester,</HI> being invited thither by one <HI>Whitting∣ton</HI> an Apothecary, vvhere though his condition could not be expected to be extraordinary, having no Natural, but acquired Friends in <HI>England,</HI> yet in time he made his own fortunes, and so vvell im∣prov'd his small Talent at first, as to leave behind him, besides what he parted with in his life time which was not inconsiderable) the best estate of any Physician that died in <HI>Bathe.</HI> And I have often heard him bless God for that good success he had given his undertakings, and the prosperous condi∣tion he had brought him to, not without a modest humble reflection on what no man had any reason to be asham'd of, in the words of good Old <HI>Jacob,</HI> in the like condition, <HI>With my staff have I passed over this</HI> Jordan, <HI>and now the Lord hath made me many bands.</HI> Which is more than many men have said, that have been raised to greater Estates by less skill or pains, it being no disparagement to any man to have a beginning since none but God but had so; and a gatherer, though the first rise of a Fa∣mily, is much better than him that scatters through many Generations.</P>
<PB N="148" REF="108"/>
<P>After he had been some time in <HI>Glocester,</HI> his Parts and Learning procured the good opinion of Alderman <HI>Robinson,</HI> a wealthy Citizen, and Coun∣sellor at Law, whose Daughter he married, with vvhom he lived many years, and had Sons and Daughters. From <HI>Glocester</HI> he removed to <HI>Bathe,</HI> about the year 1640, where practising with ad∣mirable success, for near thirty years, and main∣taining a mighty riding practise, died in a good old age, in his eightieth year, as may further ap∣pear by this Epitaph I caused to be engraven in Marble on a handsom Monument, erected by his Wife Mrs. <HI>Hester Baue</HI> in the South Isle of the Ab∣bey Church, as followeth:

In short, He was an industrious man, an able Physician, and much in the favour of that great Physician of his Time Sir <HI>Theodore May∣ern,</HI> between whom many Letters passed, on Com∣mendation of Patients, chiefly French. And so I pass on to Dr. <HI>Maplet.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>10. Dr. <HI>John Maplet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DOctor <HI>John Maplet</HI> was born in <HI>London,</HI> bred at <HI>Westminster</HI>-School, and afterwards re∣moved to <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he was first Proctor of the University, then Doctor of Phy∣sick, in the year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">When he had his Grace, but kept no Act till <HI>1654.</HI></NOTE> 1647. and after that Principal of <HI>Glocester-Hall;</HI> a man well accomplisht as a Gentle∣man and a Scholar, meek, sober, and temperate, beloved and respected by all that knew him.</P>
<P>While he was in the University, he had an op∣portunity by accompanying the Lord Viscount <HI>Falk∣land,</HI> to whom he was Tutor, to Travel, and ac∣cordingly went in the year 1650. into <HI>France,</HI> where he continued near two years, chiefly at <HI>Or∣leans, Bloys</HI> and <HI>Saumur,</HI> and made many Observa∣tions on those Countreys, which he committed to Writing in a neat and curious Hand, in some Epistles now with me, with a particular Tract of his Tra∣vels, in an elegant Latin Style, which I may some∣time or other make publick, and do further right to the memory of this Worthy Person.</P>
<P>A second time he Travell'd into <HI>Holland</HI> and the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> with my Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> then Vis∣count, on the death of his elder Brother, whom before he had accompanied into <HI>France,</HI> the young
<PB N="152" REF="110"/> Lord <HI>Scudamore,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Jones,</HI> who lost his life by an unfortunate Shot at the late Siege of <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and at his return, or shortly after, mar∣ried Mrs. <HI>Anne Hull</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> where he usually practised in the Winter time, and at <HI>Bathe</HI> in the Summer.</P>
<P>And although he left a good Estate, considering the small time he had for practice, dying not old, and spending much of his time at first abroad, yet I must say, he had no right done him, by one that pretended much kindness to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.</HI> Wall <HI>of</HI> Chr. Ch. Oxon.</NOTE> on whom, to my knowledg, he had reason to depend, and whom he not only courted and honoured as a Patron, but had almost the same Reverence for as for a Father, as doth appear by that Volume of familiar Latin Epi∣stles, I have by me directed to him for the whole space of 16 years, <HI>viz.</HI> from the year 1650. in which he travell'd, to the year 1666. But seeing that Cunning Fox is now earth'd, I shall not dig af∣ter him; but proceed to some other Particulars, of no Vulpone alike under ground.</P>
<P>He was of a tender, brittle Constitution, incli∣ning to feminine, clear skin'd, and of a very fresh Complexion, and though very temperate, as I said before, yet inclinable to Rheumatick Distempers, chiefly Gouts and Catarrhs, which would often∣times confine his Body, but not his Mind, which was then more at liberty to expatiate, and give some invitation to his Poetick Genius, which was very good, to descant on the Tormenter, and trans∣mute his Sorrow into a Scene of Mirth. I shall mention one or two out of the Manus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ripts I have, because Ingenious and short.</P>

<P>I have not adventured to Translate the two for∣mer Copies on the Catarrh, in regard I think they cannot be so aptly expressed in any other language, those Verses, as many others, sounding best in their own words; yet as a foyl to the Doctor's Jewel, to render it more radiant, I have attempted a Tran∣slation of the last, thus:

<L>Old age creeps on, that Silent Thing,</L>

<L>Death stops not now, but warns, my breath.</L>

<P>His Body being macerated by a weakness of the Tone of all the Parts, by degrees languished to that measure, that confined him for some few days to his Chamber and Bed, and a flux of blood supervening from the Hemorroides, which, though stopp'd in time, gave him little hopes of recovery, and there∣fore after the use of many means in vain attempted, he resigned himself to death, which in a short time ensued.</P>
<P>One thing I must remind, as an argument of his Contentedness to leave this World, That after my self, and Mr. <HI>Rob. Chapman</HI> his Apothecary, who attended him in his sickness, had left him, and taken our leaves of this dying Friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sr.</HI> R. N.</NOTE> an Eminent Physi∣cian of his former acquaintance coming accidentally to Town, and hearing the Doctor was so danger∣ously ill, made what hast he could to pay him his respects, and enquiring of Mrs. <HI>Maplet</HI> how the Doctor did, and she replying, without any hope of Life, he, in kindness, said, <HI>If he were not dead, he would do his utmost endeavour to recover him;</HI> and desired her to acquaint him with as much, which she did; but the Doctor replyed in his modest manner, <HI>Pray remember my Service to Sr.</HI> Richard, <HI>and let him know that I thank him for his visit, but am past his cure and any body's else, and shall take it as a kindness, if in the condition I am now in I am not troubled;</HI> and the same night parted with this Life for a better, according to the Motto of the Rings at his Funeral, <HI>Morier ut vivam.</HI></P>
<P>He wrote several Latin Epistles, in which he had a singular faculty, (which, with some Poems, and a few Observations, were the greatest part of his Writings he left behind) as well to the most Eminent Sir <HI>Alexander Fraiser</HI> Knight, and Princi∣pal Physician to his Majesty, his Learned and good
<PB N="188" REF="113"/> Friend Sir <HI>John Baber,</HI> with whom he had an inti∣mate acquaintance, Sir <HI>Francis Prujean,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bate,</HI> Dr. <HI>Meara,</HI> Dr. <HI>Nedham,</HI> and others at home, as also to some abroad, particularly Dr. <HI>Neal</HI> of <HI>Leedes,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Bennet</HI> of <HI>Saumur,</HI> where he was very sick, and recover'd from an im∣minent danger of death, by the help and assistance of this Physician, as he most pertinently exprest in one Epistle, in which are these words; <HI>Sed &amp; Si∣lente illa Comitatis Tuae voce, resuscitata Mihi Tua ope Sanitas, ad hoc scribendi officium, nullo etiamsi alio devinctum nomine, adegisset, ut qui fuerit conser∣vatum Corpus, Corporis saltem pars manus recognos∣ceret. Per Tuam scilicet Apollineam manum, in suo refloruit domicilio, robustus ille vigor, quo itinerum aut suscipere labores, aut perferre debueram.</HI></P>
<P>I shall end the Life of Dr. <HI>Maplet,</HI> with one ex∣pression of his kindness to me, and another of mine in return to himself.</P>
<P>The first is, That on the setting up of Dr. <HI>Bave</HI>'s Monument, there having been some envious spirits that rais'd a discourse to the disparagement of that Epitaph, I was constrained to appeal to this Wor∣thy Judg of Learning for a Censure, which I did in these words. <HI>Censuram Tuam, Vir Doctissime, de hoc Epitaphio liberam &amp; vere criticam peto obnixe; Ʋtrum Prisciani, ut dicitur, Capiti vulnus aliquod sit inflictum, quemadmodum Tenebrio quidam anony∣mus, cui sinciput uti suspicor, parum sanum est, de∣blaterat, fac ut sciat Tui Observantissimus.</HI> To which the Candid Doctor returned this answer; <HI>Cur dicam Tibi Epitaphii hujus causâ scribat ullam, aut ferulae plagam cur jubeat retribui, ob vulnus ali∣quod in Capite suo inde acceptum, omnino non habet Prisci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nus.

<L>His pockets searcht too were unwilling</L>
<L>To part with all they had, a shilling,</L>
<L>Which was too little judg'd by all</L>

<L>The boards of a poor Hut he built</L>
<L>Were sold to multiply the gilt,</L>
<L>To set the <HI>Caput mort</HI> in ground</L>
<L>Of this Philosopher profound.</L>
<L>Th'Apothecaries too, they say,</L>
<L>Were willing something to defray,</L>
<L>As part of what they got to boot</L>
<L>By sale of's famed Spirit of Soot.</L>
<L><HI>Hermes</HI> his Bird went thus to rest,</L>
<L>Leaving a Feather in his nest.</L>

<L><HI>Here lies</HI> John Dauntsey<HI>'s famous Poet.</HI></L>
