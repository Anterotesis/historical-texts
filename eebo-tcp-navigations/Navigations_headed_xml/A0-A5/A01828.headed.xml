For in this lytle treatyce be con¦teyned, the state, the fayth, the rely∣gyon, the ceremonyes, the Patry∣arche wyth his offyce, the powre, the lawes of the lande and empyre of pre¦stre Iohn̄, besydes his royall maiestie

and order of his courte. All whyche thynges were rehersed vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> mygh∣ty and pusaunt prynce Emanuell kynge of Portyngale, by the mouth of one Mathew, sent frō themperour of Inde prester Iohn̄, vnto the forna¦med Emanuel, in the yere of our lord M.v. hundred .xiii. And all though of this prester Iohn̄ syr Iohn̄ Maū∣defeld knyght, in a worke y<SUP>t</SUP> he made of the dyscrypcyon of coūtrees, som∣what hath made mencyon: yet this embassatour that came from thens to the kynge of Portyngale, as he to whome euery thynge perteynyng ey¦ther to the religyon and fayth of that people, or to the polytyque order of that lande, was myche more perfyte∣ly knowen, yt is no meruayle though he myche more perfytely descrybe theym, namely to that prynce, whych from poynte to poynte was curyouse to enquyre. This empyre of prester Iohn̄ ys reputed as great a maygne countre in a maner (yf yt be not gret¦ter) as all the remanaunt that nowe remayneth christened, except the new founden landes, that haue ben byco∣men

chrystened wythin few yeres of late. And therfore yt greatly may, &amp; of reason greatly ought to reioyce all good chrystē people, to perceyue that though there are dyuerse thynges wherein they and we dyffere in rytes lawes, customes, and ceremonyes: yet in all other thynges necessary∣ly perteynynge as well to the ver∣tues of fayth and relygyon, as all other vertues morall, they so farre∣forth accorde and agre wyth these cri¦sten nacyons of ours, and wyth the catholyque doctryne of the chyrche, that yt may well appere euen by that thynge alone, that the spyryte of god hath wrought and worketh this full agrement &amp; consent, in so many thyn¦ges necessary to saluacyon, thorowe so many great countreys and regyōs as ours are and theyres both, y<SUP>e</SUP> tone by so longe space hauynge so lytle ac¦cesse vnto the tother, that of many ye¦res tyl nowe very late, we coulde not wel tell whyther they were well criste¦ned or not.

But syth that we begyn nowe eache to heare more of other, I pray god as there is in bothe many thynges very good, and some thyn∣ges that myght be better: eche peple may lerne &amp; take of other those thyn∣ges that be good, and lette the badde go by.

that embassate, some oldermen, men of more grauyte, of greater experyēce and bysydes this Ebyssyns borne, whyche myght haue borne a greater porte and maieste before our prynce rather then these, of whome the one was farre frome the nobilyte ether of an Ebyssyne or Indyane eyther, bycause beyng an Armenycane / and the other all though he was an Ebys¦syne and in y<SUP>e</SUP> kynges court brought vppe, yet but a yonge man, an wyth∣oute the company waytyng on hym y<SUP>t</SUP> becometh a prynces embassatour to haue / and therby sheweth not the dygnyte of a legate. But hereof may there be two causes alledged.</P>
<P>The fyrste, in all those regyons (as great as they be) from the see of Araby, to the water of Gange, there be but two languages, that is to wit, Persyke and Arabyke. whyche lan∣guages who so perfytely knoweth, may easely passe thorough all those prouynces. Nowe in Prester Iohn̄s courte be there very fewe or none no∣bles, Ebyssyns borne, that can skyll of those tonges. Fyrste bycause they
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
haue lyttell cōpany or acquayntaūce wyth the out borderars. Secondely for that yt seldome causeth theym to go out of theyr owne countrey, as be∣ynge contente wyth theyre countrey lawes. And for y<SUP>t</SUP> cause the same Ma¦thew, skylled in both the tonges and in all the prouynces there about, for he hadde ofte ben in them / and seyng that at that tyme, all though he were an Armenyane, yet he was of the que¦nys counsayll, and very great about her, he was thoughte the metyst for that message / namely syns he hadde one ioyned wyth hym an Ebyssyne borne, whyche both knewe the ton∣ges and maners of many nacyons / so that yf nede shold requyre, he were mete to be sent on a lyke embassat.</P>
<P>The seconde cause is. The actes of warre of the Portyngales done wyth the Indyans, agaynst the Tur¦kes or Persyes at that tyme was not so well knowen of the Ebyssyns, that they thought it nedefull to vēter any old noble Ebyssyne, &amp; specyally syns they were vnexperte in y<SUP>e</SUP> tonges, in so farre and so dyffyculte a vyage, tyll
<PB REF="26"/>
tyme they were farther certyfyed by some other. And therfore pleased to sende that Mathew, an Armenycane borne, as moste meate for that besy∣nes whyche not greatly accōpanyed, but as a marchaunt sholde go and espye al to gether. And that it so was ment, the mater selfe shewed. For af∣ter ones all was exactely tryed by hym, there was then a nother embas¦satour sent, both an old man, a noble man, an Ebissyne borne, and a preste, connyng both in scrypture and Cal∣day / on whome wayted a very great company of nobles of the Ebyssyns, of themperours p̄ster Iohn̄s courte. And this mā was sent vnto the most myghty prīce one Iohn̄, y<SUP>e</SUP> thyrd king of Portyngale. For Emanuel that was his father departed almost .x. ye¦res ago. This legate wyth all his cō¦pany at this present day is wyth our kynge, myche made on, and hadde in great reuerence. whome ques∣tyonlesse they wold neuer haue sent, hadde they not ben afore surely certy¦fyed of our maters by Mathew. But now we be a littell degressed therfore
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
let vs agayn returne to our purpose. This Mathew then vnder the pre∣texte of fayned marchaundyse, after his beynge at many other cytyes, re∣sorted to Aden / whych is a cytye by y<SUP>e</SUP> see of Arabye vnder the Turkes do∣mynyon, byelded euen as our cytyes be, very ryche, and very well fensyd wyth fortresses. where after he hadde fallē in some familiare acqueyntaūce wyth certayne marchaunt men, and hadde serched all thynge to the vtter moste, and fynyshed the maters he came for, makynge hym selfe euer a∣mōgest y<SUP>e</SUP> Turkes a Turke, for other wyse coulde he neuer haue escaped &amp; done his besynesse saufe without daū¦ger, he returned to Arquique where before he had left his houshold wyth his companyon the Ebyssyne, &amp; thus he remoued, toke his houshold again and so retourned to Aden, hopynge that from thens he myght sayle wyth his warys and his housholde to In∣dia. For why at the towne of Aden they are wonte to take shippynge to∣warde India. where when he was landed he sold al his lether &amp; bought
<PB REF="27"/>
other marchandyse of Alexandrye to cary wyth hym to Indy, by whych he muste nedes passe into Portyngale.</P>
<P>Now was a shyppe redy goynge to Inde, and he redy wyth all his mar¦chandyse to go wyth that shyppe, whyle there spronge a certayne suspy¦cyon amonges the cetezyns of Aden, that he sholde be a spye. wheruppon he was taryed and let that he coulde not take passage at that season. But he as one of a great wyt and expery∣ence, so clerely purged hym selfe of that suspycyon, prouynge in dede he was a marchaūt man, and that there he soughte nothynge but marchaun∣dyse, that they gaue hym wyth hys housholde free pasporte, to departe whether hym pleased. But now then beynge dysmyssed / he founde neuer a vessel goynge toward Inde. Then he was fayn to hyer one, &amp; so he with all his company toke shyppyng, and came towarde Inde, to a certayn no¦ble ryche cytye called Xaer. whych is dystant from Aden about a hundred myle, where lykewyse he founde no shyppes goynge to Inde, bycause y<SUP>t</SUP>
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
nowe yt was wynter, whyche there begynneth in Marche. And whyle yt lasteth no man may saile toward In∣de, for the great stormes of wynde (whyche is a meruaylous thynge) y<SUP>t</SUP> contynually blows contrary oute of one quarter. But when the sees ser∣ued hym, he sayled from the cytye of Xaer vnto a towne called Fartaque, there in euery place faynynge hym selfe a marchaunt of Turkey. From whens he wente to a place called the inhabitours of Dabul / &amp; from thens to departe to the town of Goa. where thē wyntered the gret Alfonsus Dal∣bubarque a Portyngale, the chyefe capytayne of all India, predecessour vnto Lupus Soarez, whom we haue made mencyon of byfore, whych was he y<SUP>e</SUP> subdewed al that same Inde, Ara¦by, Perse, Malach, and the hole see of Ganges, and made all them sub∣iectes to Portyngale. Dabull is dy∣stant from Fartaque, whych is in the cost of Inde .iiii. hundred myle, from Goa .xl. frō Dio .iii. score great myle. Dio is a very ryche cytye, vnder the domynyon of Cambaie very well fen¦sed,
<PB REF="28"/>
wyth gonnes and suche other in∣gens of warre, and very well walled.</P>
<P>Furthermore he taried at Dabul from May to Decēber, and there oc∣cupied hym selfe about marchaūdyse because in all that tyme he could not take shyppynge. At laste he gate hym a smale vessell, and beganne to gete hym away. And by y<SUP>e</SUP> reason he shew∣ed certayn of his frendes &amp; the mays∣ter of the shyppe that he wolde go vn¦to Portyngale wyth his marchaun∣dyse, by and by yt was shewed to cer¦tayne hed offycers of the towne, that there was a straunger one vnknowē, whyche pryuyly wolde conuey hym selfe to Portyngale. wheruppon wot¦tynge neuer what they shuld thynke of the mater, they kept him styll with fayre wordes, and so let hym of hys passage for y<SUP>e</SUP> season. After he saw this incontynēt by certayn marchaūt men whych were wonte to be cōuersant in Inde with the Portyngales, whyche he before hadde made hys frendes, he wrote secretely vnto the capy∣tayne Alfonsus Dalbuberque, cer∣tifyeng hym as diligētly as he could
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
how it stode with him. He as soone as he knew it sent thither certain shypp{is} and galleys some great some smale vnto hym. Siluester Corzo was y<SUP>e</SUP> ca¦pitayn of them, where whē he was ar¦ryued, strayt way he shewed the offy∣cers of the town that he was sent vn∣to them from y<SUP>e</SUP> great duke Alfonsus Dulbuberque to seke a certayn mar∣chaunt man whyche he muste nedes speke wyth all, &amp; that the same Ma∣thew was he whom he sought / which knowen they gaue hym leue to speke wyth hym and so delyuered hym into his handes. For this cause the Dabu¦lenses vsed this liberalyte towarde hī, for fere they shold seme our opē eni¦myes, for as mych as they take mych profyte by our Portyngales whyche vse Goa &amp; Inde, &amp; yet in place &amp; time whē the may, secretly do vs displease. This Mathew then cōuayde frō the citie of Dabull, cam with this noble yong man y<SUP>e</SUP> Ebyssyne his felow, &amp; al his famyly, at y<SUP>e</SUP> last to Goa, where as we before recyted, y<SUP>e</SUP> noble capytayne Alfonsus then wintered wyth a gret number bothe of people &amp; nobles of
<PB REF="29"/>
the Portyngales. There is bothe an ile &amp; also a citie of this name of Goa. The citye I say as it is very riche, so is yt also very habūdaūt of all thyng that seruyth for the fyndyng of men. In that dwelleth marchaunt men of all kyndes, Indians, Arabyes, Per∣syās, wyth diuers of the realmes of Narsynga &amp; Cambaia. In thys yle be .iiii. great &amp; very well fensed for∣tresys, well māned wyth many hye∣red souldyers of the Portyngales. There inhabiteth the city, about .xv. hundred Portyngales. These be cy∣tezyns there, wyth theyr wyues, chyl∣dren, and seruauntes, besydes many other, as soudiours, &amp; marchauntes. Both that hole Ile the cytye &amp; the ca∣steles, be vnder the Portyngales. In the cytye be grāmer scoles kept, wher in is taught in comyn scoles both the latyne and the Portyngale tonge. wherby the inhabytours of those par¦tes, be as well skylled in both those lāguages, as in the lāguage of theyr natyue coūtre, where they were brede and brought vp. The fayth of Cryste is euery where receyued amongest

them. Many sumptuous and costely temples &amp; houses of relygyō be there as well of other as of saynt Fraūces order, where dayly is vsed diuine ser¦uyce. Ouer y<SUP>e</SUP> hyghest parte of a gate in the cytye, whyche they call saynte Mary da sera, be kept &amp; had in great veneracyon &amp; honour, the bones of that capytayne Alfonsus Dalbuber∣que. But nowe after y<SUP>t</SUP> Mathew had arriued, from the town of Dabull in the hauen of Goa, the Capitayne Al∣fonsus cōmaunded hym to come vn¦to him. He denyed &amp; sayd he wold not come out of the shyppes, alledgynge y<SUP>t</SUP> he was not the legate of any meane prince but of y<SUP>e</SUP> hygh mighty em{per}our of Inde Prester Iohn̄ / &amp; hereūto ad∣ded that it were not cōuenyēt nor me∣tely that thembassatour of so hygh a myghty chrystened emperour, shold be receyued to so noble a duke as Al∣fonsus is wythout dewe reuerence &amp; honour. Thē Alfonsus callyng to ge¦ther his clerkes, prestes, &amp; all his no∣bilite y<SUP>t</SUP> were nigh at hand, goth forth (namely syns he was y<SUP>e</SUP> embassatour of thēperour Prester Iohn̄s) to mete
<PB REF="30"/>
hym wyth crosses, and such other or∣namentes of the chyrche, the prestes and clerkes syngynge this hymne: <HI>Te deum laudamus,</HI> within a fewe dayes after Alfonsus began to aske hym of his legacy, to whome he answered, y<SUP>t</SUP> he was sent from prester Iohn̄ vnto the most Crystened prynce Emanuel kynge of Portīgale, &amp; that he ought onely to open the cause of hys em∣bassate to no creature but vnto hym alone. whych when he hard the duke Alfonsus axed hym no further ques∣tyons. wythin a whyle after when he saw his time, this Mathew &amp; this no¦ble yonge mā y<SUP>e</SUP> Ebyssyne, with al his company makyng hast toward Por∣tyngale, Alfonsus very gentylly ac∣cōpanied him vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> hauen, where ta¦kyng shyppyng frō Goa they cam to¦ward Portīgale. All this shewed vn me this George Lupe Dandrade, that he knewe of a suerty for trewth, for as myche (as we haue shewed you before) the great rular of Inde Lup{us} Soarez had sent him from the Ile of Camara, as a spye amonge the Ebys¦synes vnder the pretexte of marchaū¦dyse,

to serche out the trewth of that legacye. when he &amp; that noble yonge man the Ebyssyne, wyth all his fa∣myly came to Portyngale, my selfe (as I haue shewed your holynes by¦fore) was by, whome I both saw and spoke often wyth all. He was a man of mean stature, very whitly visaged and somwhat sallowe, wyth a syde &amp; hore here, wyth a longe whyte berde. whych a lyttell more at lēgth I haue shewed your holynes, to thentēt you with all other y<SUP>t</SUP> be desyrous to know the very trewth shall not thynke yt be a lye or fayned.</P>
