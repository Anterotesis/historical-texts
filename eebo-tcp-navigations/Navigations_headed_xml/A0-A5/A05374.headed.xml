<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His olde prouerbe (as cōmonly all other) hath his groūd vpon knowē experience, <HI>Malus ani∣mus, malamens,</HI> an euill affection maketh an e∣uill construction. Men wrest or driue the interpretaciō of doings to the frame of their owne coceits, which they deriue from the fauour or disfauour that they haue settled in their owne perswasions. It is not vnknowen what extraordina∣ry discourses, &amp; what priuate fansies in common meetīgs, are daily made of the case of our neighbours in the low Coun∣try. Such maner of debatinge where cō∣trary opiniōs haue distracted you seeme to be the cause of your question, wherof you desire to be resolued in your letters.
<PB REF="4"/>You coulde not haue written to a man more indifferent than I am: who am as farre from parcialitie, as he that loueth, (that is to say preferreth) neither party before other, but our country before thē both. I do therefore (as I wish you to doe) set the pin of the beame eauen, and examine the weight of either skale. Let vs then cōpare the sides, and begin with the sharper, that we maye haue the mil∣der ending.</P>
<P>First I will call to minde, what thone of those sides obiecteth:</P>
<P>Secondly what thother aunswereth: And thirdly what to drawe to concerne our selues.</P>
<P>In the matter of obiection, let vs see what strength it hath in iustice:</P>

<P>And for the matter of Our selues, let vs see what necessity, what commodity, what right, and what facilitie it is said to beare, to draw vs to any side.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>It is sayd by some, which are loth that Spaine should be weaker or Englande stronger, that the Prince of Orendge &amp; his adherēts are rebels in Armes agaīst their natural Prince, and maintayners of a most daungerous president against all Princes.</P>
<P>To this is aunswered on thother part (as in this booke you shal see discoursed) that there is difference of the bande &amp; maner of their subiection from other. None of them holdeth that a king maye be shaken of by his subiects: but they all saye, that Lords electible vpon pacts &amp; conditions are also reiectible accordīge to the same pacts &amp; cōditions, special∣ly in Dominions subiecte to the ciuill lawes, which are not the Lawes of Eng∣land. The order of eche state is to be re∣garded: not all States haue kings. Some haue other formes of gouernment. Not all kingdoms haue like maner of admis∣sions or receyuings of kings. Som follow natural succession of bloud: some Choise:
<PB REF="5"/>some Lot or chaunce. Some kings or ru∣lers haue simple &amp; absolute power: some limitted &amp; circumscribed. Therles of Holland and Zealand (as is well knowē &amp; many examples haue proued, at their <HI>Ioyous entree</HI> that is to saye, at ther re∣ceyuinge to inauguration or seisen of their Estate) be bound by oth to prescri∣bed pacts &amp; orders: whereby not onelye their forme of rule is bounded, but also vpon diuers points the subiects homage &amp; allegiance expresly discharged. And that discharg in fact hath bin executed, &amp; by such fact, (say they,) the auncesters of the Prince himself that now chargeth them, haue bin receyued. The Prince and states of that Country alledge the othe of their Earle, the precise forme of assoylmēt vpon his breach of their Pri∣uiledges: they produce one chiefe point, that they ought not to be pestered with gouernaunce or garrison of straungers: they recken vp thintollerable, outragi∣ous &amp; manifest oppressions done vpon
<PB REF="5"/>them, and the euident practise to bring that free Nation to most vnsufferable seruitude: they shield themselues vnder the liberty &amp; right of Nature, the pro∣uision of agreements, the othes of their Princes, their power of refusall vppon their Princes periurie, wyth many like matters, whereof they make the worlde Iudges by their many Protestacions, A∣pologies, Iustifications, &amp; Supplicatiōs to the states of thempyre, &amp; other mea∣nes: alwayes seuering their case from o∣ther subiectes of Naturall and absolute Kinges.</P>
<P>FOR (say they) in their case of resi∣stinge the Kinge, these things are to be considered: the nature of the Gouerne∣ment and subiection, &amp; the cause of re∣sistance, and thirdly the maner of the resistance. The nature of the Gouern∣ment &amp; the subiection stādeth in these two considerations. VVhether it hee <HI>Merum Imperium,</HI> that all thinges may be done <HI>Pro voluntate Regnanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</HI> or it be <HI>Mo∣deratum,</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>which is <HI>Temperatū Legibus,</HI> where∣in the Ruler hath his rule prescribed him which way to rule, &amp; the Subiect a Pa∣terne described him which way to obey. If the Gouernment be <HI>Merum &amp; absolutū,</HI> then is the Person inferiour, a slaue and no subiecte. For in all due subiection there is <HI>Taxis,</HI> which is neuer in <HI>Voluntate.</HI> If the Gouernmente be <HI>Temperatum,</HI> then is thinferiour a subiect and no slaue.</P>
<P>IN all subiection there is an honest liberty giuen by Law it self, whereby all Actions and Pleas in Lawe are as o∣pen to the subiect as to the ruler, for the maintenaunce of truth and equitie. In slauerie there is none such: because he is not to be measured but by the will of the Ruler, which howsoeuer it turneth, is his right: &amp; he hath no actiō of Appeal or Plea to the contrary.</P>
<P>Then it followeth that the Law is the rightest Auctoritie, and the same is to be maintayned by all the iust and right∣full executers of it: for if the Lawe
<PB REF="6"/>be not maynteined, the life of the whole common wealth is lost.</P>
<P>This mayntenaunce of the Lawe no man doubteth vvhether it ought to bee or no: for it is thende vvhy Counsellers &amp; vnder magistrats are appoīted: yea it is the cause of placing the highest Magi∣strate hymselfe. So that to maintayne the Lavv, is iudged meete by all men: if the Lavv be iust.</P>
<P>But whether the Law may be mayn∣tayned agaynst the Highest Magistrate or no, that is the doubt. For here upō this maintenance of Law is called resistāce, and is called Rebellion?</P>
<P>This question doth imply a contradi∣ction: for it importeth that thone is a∣gaynst thother, &amp; no man can serue two Maisters: &amp; so stādeth the vvhole case in the righteousnes of the Lavv, which for the present purpose is presumed to be most iust &amp; most holy. VVhy then? The Person that is agaynst this Lavv, goeth aboute to disanull that that is
<PB REF="7"/>most iust and most holy, &amp; laboureth to bring in that, that is most vniust, most vnholy. For touchinge his owne person the question and debate standeth not, but for thinforcing of the subiects to the same.</P>
<P>VVHY then, there is no doubt but as it is confessed of all mē, both that ne∣uer knew God, and of them that do pro∣fesse God, that iustice is to be maintay∣ned against iniustice, Godlines against vngodlines, &amp; God against the deuill: els were the law no law, neither the sub∣iect a subiect: being (as I sayd before) a person licenced to liue in liberty of law.</P>
<P>Thus by the nature of Gouernment &amp; the subiection, it is euidente that the rightest Magistrate may be resisted, &amp; this resistance is truly a maintenaunce of Law &amp; equitie and so to be termed, and vntruly and vniustly called Rebel∣lion. For these words of rebellion and suche like cannot iustlye bee vsed, but where the wyll of the Ruler and the law
<PB REF="7"/>are concurrent and agree in one.</P>
<P>By this that hath bin saide of the Go∣uernment it selfe, ensueth a right aun∣swere to the cause of resistāce. Nothing may cause resistance to the Magistrate but the maintenaunce of righte and e∣quitie: for there is no equitie in this, that the will of the subiect should stand for a lawe to the Prince, where the sub∣iect thinketh it vnmeete that the wil of his Prince should stande for a law of his subiection. This is against Iustice di∣stributiue, which the Heathen teach in their common wealth, &amp; flatly against the rule of GOD: <HI>Thou shalte not do to thy Neighbour y<SUP>t</SUP> thou vvilt not haue don to thy selfe.</HI></P>
<P>SO then he that hath law &amp; main∣taineth the law, is resisted on which part soeuer he be: &amp; he that resisteth the law is a rebell and traitour whosoeuer he be: for the law is <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> life of the cōmon weale. And the consideration of resistance stā∣deth not in the person, vnlesse hee haue the law with him: if he be not <HI>Lex loquēs,</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>he is not resisted, but resisteth.</P>
<P>But euery man may not resist. They onely that are made keepers of the La∣wes, to thē it belōgeth: otherwyse there would be a confusiō, and euery man en∣croche vpon an others office. The shed∣ding of bloude is murther in euery pri∣uate man: but if a Magistrate do it, he doth it lawfully, and is excused before man, and doth his dutie to God: For hee beareth not the sword in vaine.</P>
<P>IN sum, where the kind of Gouern∣ment is tempered by Law, &amp; the Prince hath aswell to liue by law as the subiect: if the Prince wil breake this Law which is iust, &amp; enforce an obedience to a law vniust against the will of the Subiects: the law may be maintayned agaīst him, by such as are appointed from God &amp; the law, to be Gardians &amp; kepers of the law. But the case of the Prince of Orenge &amp; his associats stādeth in <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> same termes. The king with whom he hath to deale had auctoritie <HI>Temperatam Laegibus:</HI> hee
<PB REF="8"/>was sworne aswel to the keeping of those lawes and bringing in of no new, as the subiects vvere, &amp; if hee brake his othe, they vvere quit of all obedience. This appeareth in <HI>Forma iuramenti,</HI> vvhich hee toke at his Ioyous entraunce.</P>
<P>This othe &amp; Lavv vvas broken by brīging in a nevv lavv of Inquisition, vvhich tended to the vtter supplāting of the Prince and states of the country, vvhich notvvythstanding they endu∣red for a season, vsing al dutiful meanes by complaints made from the counsell &amp; states at diuers &amp; sōdry times, as are to be seene, but coulde haue no redresse in deede, though oftentimes they had faire promises. VVhen iustice could not be had by vvay of iust complaint from the Coūsell &amp; States: the Prince &amp; States toke the maintenaūce of the lavv into their ovvne hands, and so retaine it by Iustice, reseruing the auncient liberties &amp; lavves to the benefite of all the sub∣iects, so y<SUP>t</SUP> none cōplayneth of wrōg done
<PB REF="9"/>vnto him, but the will of that Prince who woulde his will shoulde preuaile a∣gaīst Law to the subuersion of the whole state, as appeareth in their Records.</P>
<P>Therfore this maintenaunce of law by the Prince of Orenge, is right, against the breaker of Lawe and bringer in of Tyrannie, the Spanish kinge. They say, brīger in of Tirāny &amp; breaker of Law, for that contrary to his oth, wherby both he &amp; all the Erles of Holland &amp; Zelād haue bin receiued into <HI>y<SUP>t</SUP></HI> gouernmēt, &amp; no otherwyse but vpon those condicions limitted to them by their said oth, he al∣tereth the whole state of gouernmente, leaueth no law but his own wil, &amp; so v∣seth himself, as though he had neuer bin sworne, nor taken the countries vvith condicion, but had entred as an absolute conquerour: Farre inferiour therin to Heathē &amp; barbarous Prīces. VVe read of Cyrus the greate Monarche of the Easte, that aboue all his singuler ver∣tues, which purchased him so greate a
<PB REF="9"/>Fame as euer any Prince had, hee had this in him, that he suffered all Natiōs vnder his Monarchie to enioye their owne Lawes, customes, liberties &amp; re∣ligion, and made no alteration against their wills. The like we finde recorded of Alexander the Greate, who vsed himselfe after the same sort in all his cō∣quests, contenting him onely with the Soueraignties ouer <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> Natiōs which he subdued, without any alteratiō of their Estate. And did not the auncient Romaynes walke after the same sorte, whē they subdued any Nation to their obediēce? Did they euer alter the state, of any coūtry which they conquered, &amp; enforce their people to receiue their la∣wes and Religion? VVhat course vsed <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> in his Conquests of Fraūce▪ Did he chaūg any one iote of the state of those Citties which he conquered?</P>
<P>Thus was the behauiour of those barba∣rous Princes, euen in their Conquests. such moderation and equitie vsed they
<PB REF="10"/>euē in the middes of their fire &amp; sword.</P>
<P>The kinge of Spaine came not in by force, he was receyued by curtesie, &amp; re∣ceiued as a Patrone and Protectour of their liberties, and vpon this condition onely, had the Seigniories giuen him, as to his predecessours before him, that hee should keepe those Lawes and liberties safe &amp; sound, by vertue of which, &amp; for preseruation wherof they cast vpon him the Erledom, as they had don in former times vpon his auncesters. Vppon this condition he toke it, &amp; to this conditi he swore, as all his aūcesters did, submit∣ting &amp; yelding himselfe to the like dis∣honour that other had incurred before him, &amp; by whose fall his auncesters came into that preferment, if he committed the like trespasse against the states. To this, (I say) he was boūd by oth, let him∣self be demaunded, if he cā denie it, they are cōtent to stand to the condemnati∣on of all the world, as falsaccusers of so mighty a Prince, in charging him wyth
<PB REF="10"/>periurie, a most horrible crime both be∣fore God &amp; man. But hee wil not, hee doth not denie it, it is confessed of him∣self and published by Print in his owne books, vnder his owne Priuiledge. How thē stādeth his case &amp; theirs? was he not boūd by oth to obserue their lawes? And in case he or any of his officers &amp; Mini∣sters did not obserue but breake theim, did he not expresly charge &amp; enioyne al his subiects by the same oth to make re∣sistance against him &amp; them, and in no wyse to yeld him any obedience, vntil he stoode and yelded to the fulfilling of his othe? The matter, as I sayde, is to e∣uident, books imprīted vnder his owne Priuiledge vouch it to all the vvorlde. And shall they that stand for the main∣tenance of a law so iustly, being further charged thereto by the kings owne oth, be notvvithstandinge deemed for re∣bels? Surely if there be no more than so, wee haue no reasō so to esteme or iudge
<PB REF="11"/>of thē. Mē might do no more, if either the kings auctority ouer thē vvere ab∣solute, or they had contrary to all right of obediēce, made resistāce there, where they ought to haue shewed all obediēce. But as the vvorld is not able to charge them vvith the one, so the king I suppose will not chaleng vnto himself the other. VVe finde recorded by all that are lear∣ned as vvell heathen as Christians, as vvell in lavves of the Gētiles as in the lavves of God: that it is one thing to be <HI>Princeps supremus,</HI> a Superiour &amp; highest gouernour: &amp; an other thing to be <HI>Seni∣or absolutus,</HI> an absolute lord. The one im∣porteth a soueraintie &amp; chieftie of all y<SUP>t</SUP> are within one list of lavv, as the high∣est minister of the lavv, but yet he him∣selfe vvithin the compasse of the same lavv: the other noteth a person vvith∣out the compasse of al iurisdiction, a cō∣troller of all men, &amp; to be controlled of none. VVhoso vvould chaleng this lat∣ter point to be the right of the kings ti∣title
<PB REF="11"/>in those coūtryes, (I meane, that he would make him an absolute Lord &amp; not a Supreme and highest Gouernoure,) hee should greatly discredite his honour in taking his othe. For force any personne what soeuer he bee, to take an othe and not to mynde to keepe it, is in that degree of dishonoure, as carryeth wyth it an impietie against GOD himselfe, and ingendreth a iuste suspicion in all men that shall haue to deale with him: for who would contract with that mā in any sorte, that can &amp; will make so small accompte of that, which hee hath called God himselfe to witnes of, &amp; vowed to his Maiestie to keepe, in the presence of the Angels. I can not thinck so euill of the honour of a Prince, as that he would enter into so greate impietie: I iudge honourably of the Kinge of Spaine, and therefore I may not deeme, that he was of the Nature of that wicked Heathen, that sayd for excuse of himselfe, in a case of like quality. <HI>Lingua iuraui, mentem iniu∣iuratam
<PB REF="12"/>gero:</HI> I svvore wyth my tongue, so that my tongue standeth bounde by othe, but I cary a minde and hart about me that hath not sworne, ne standeth so tyed. Be it farre from any Christian, to haue so euill an opinion of any Christiā, wee haue not so to thincke of any Hea∣then, vnlesse we heare him speake and protest so, as that wretched caitife did. VVe see euidently by his ovvne confes∣sion, &amp; testimonie of all the world, that such an oth he toke, and the honourable opinion that we oughte to conceyue of the Maiestie of a Kinge muste needes persvvade vs, that hee meant them as he swore. As he swore (I say) when hee in the same article exempted them from all obedience, and armed them that should attempte ought to the contrary: If hee svvore this, and mente this, then are they no rebelles, in fulfillinge that, vvhich hee charged them vppon theyr othes.</P>
<P>But vvhat saye they, that vvil (not∣vvithstandinge)
<PB REF="12"/>iustifie the Kings do∣inges and blame the subiectes with so greeuous a crime. For no one iote of that that is aforesayd can be denyed. They saye that the Pope, who hath from GOD <HI>Plenitudinē potestatis,</HI> Fulnes of povver, did dispense vvith him from this othe. Firste if that bee so, that the Pope hath freed him from his othe, then hath hee by the same facte freed them from their obedience: for they vvere in no wyse, nor by vertue of any title sub∣iecte to him, but by vertue and title of his othe. Take the grounde of their sub∣iection avvay, and they are not subiect but free.</P>
<P>But vvhether it he so or no, that the Pope hath throughe his absolute power, (which he calleth <HI>Plenitudinē,</HI> fulnes of povver) freed him from that othe, I knovv not: onely this I know, that the Bishop of <HI>Arras,</HI> aftervvard Cardinal of <HI>Granuile</HI> gaue him suche Counsell, &amp; sayd the Pope should do so. And if it
<PB REF="13"/>followed so in effect, as it may be wel cō∣iectured by the sequel, (for no doubte a king would not stād so stoutly to the de∣fence &amp; maintenaunce of such impietie against God &amp; man, as periurie is, vn∣lesse he had some better ground &amp; war∣rante) this wilbe a Caueat, and a lesson for all Princes &amp; States to teach them to bevvare howe they deale anye more with the kinge of Spaine, or any other that giueth such credite to y<SUP>e</SUP> Pope. For what assurance cā they haue of all their Contracts and Leagues that passe and are made betwene them, if the othes ta∣ken, may be dispensed withall at the Po∣pes pleasure? That were nothing els in deede and effecte, but to bring all true Christian Kinges and Princes, vvhich make conscience and put a Religion in the bretch of their othes, into bondage &amp; slauery: to make them serue the plea∣sure and profite of the other Romishe kinge: vvho mindeth no further to ob∣serue his, then shall stande vvith his be∣nefite,
<PB REF="13"/>or pleasure of that higher power of Rome. If the case stand so, what faults soeuer Princes haue committed in for∣mer time in this behalf, I doubt not but they wilbe wyser and more circumspect hereafter. I meane they will make no leagues nor take anye othes of the Pope ☜ or any Princes and States of his adhe∣rentes, seing they haue so plaine a presi∣dēt in this case, that their othes may &amp; shalbe dispensed wythall, when and how ofte soeuer they liste. I suppose there vvas such a clause in the Contract that vvas made vvith the kinge of Spayne for the mariage of Queene Mary, that he should not alter or chaunge any one iote of the Lawes and Customes aswel publike as priuate of the Realme of En∣gland, if he had broken this braunch, &amp; vouched the equity of his dealing ther∣in, vppon a licence &amp; dispensation from the Pope, I doubt sore whether the peo∣ple and States of England would haue taken that for good payment: I doubte
<PB REF="14"/>I say, vvhether the Nobility and Com∣mons of Englande, would haue suffered him vnder that cloake, to haue bani∣shed all the Lavves of Englande and brought in the gouernmēt of <HI>Millan</HI> or <HI>Naples?</HI> I doubt, vvhether the Nobles and people of England would haue bin accōpted rebels for vvithstanding such breatch of Contract. I doubt, vvhether they vvould haue suffred him so quietly to haue caryed awaye the Crowne from the Queenes Maiestie to haue set it v∣pon his Spaniards heads? And yet hee might as iustly haue done that, as this, if this rule be good. VVe may thanck God we are deliuered from him, wee cannot tell what he woulde haue done, thoughe wee may surmise by this president, what he might haue pretended. I tell you, this excuse of periurie may seeme reasonable to them that are of his Court, for such a God they haue: but it is a perillous presi∣dent for vs, vnlesse wee bevvare of it. If it seeme a good plea for king Philip to
<PB REF="14"/>say, he hath not broken his othe herein, because the Pope dispēsed with him, what maye all Princes that haue made Con∣tracts with him loke for, but iuste quar∣rell againste themselues to be reuenged both with fire and svvord, when soeuer the Pope shall list to dispense? And I am afrayde the benefite of this dispensation wilbe vsed, if at any time they may haue oportunity (which God forbid) for <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> Q. Ma. &amp; the realm of Englād as they say, stand excōmunicat: if so thē all oth is di∣spēsed withall, you know that very well. How be it if Christiā Prīces, which pro∣fesse God &amp; conscience, shall iudge this dealing to be good, &amp; if they can so eas∣ly perswade thēselues, that such maner of dalying with othes, is Christiā &amp; Prīce∣like, surely then wil I as they say &amp; con∣clude <HI>y<SUP>t</SUP></HI> the K. of Spaine hath right, and the Prince of Orenge &amp; States of Hol∣land &amp; Zelande haue wronge, that his bretch of oth, law &amp; custome, is lawful, &amp; they in withstāding it, are rebels &amp; traitours.</P>
<PB REF="15"/>
<P>But if they shall iudge with the truth, as truth is in deede, that no mortall man can dispense with an othe that bindeth the conscience of man, for it is a matter within the iurisdictiō of God alone, &amp; againe, if they shal cōsider this wyth thē selues, that all the righte and title that the King of Spaine hath to those coun∣tryes is onely by vertue of this othe and no otherwyse, so that his superioritie o∣uer them stādeth but by way of Stipula∣tion, if hee performe those conditions, (for hee hath no better title then all his predecessours had) then will they easelie resolue, that there is great fault in that pretence, yea very preiudicious and an euill presidente to all Princes that haue to contract vvyth him: &amp; on the other side, that the Prince and the States do in iustice and equitie both before God and man what they do: and are not to be charged with these greeuous termes of Rebels and Traytours.</P>
<P>NOVV for our owne case, (say they
<PB REF="15"/>that like of that parte) it is good to re∣member for the necessitie, what neigh∣bours we haue &amp; what mīds our neigh∣bours haue: vvhat affections haue bin vttered, in subscriptions to the Counsel or conspiracie of Trent, wherin the de∣struction of all Protestant Princes (&amp; namely of <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> Queene &amp; Realme of Eng¦land (haue bin determined: vvhat pra∣ctises haue bin vsed &amp; furthered to ad∣uaūce <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> pretēsed title of the cōpetitrice of her Maiesties crowne: what intelligē∣ces entred with the rebels of England: what ayds promised to them in their a∣ctuall rebellion: how the rebels haue bin receiued, succoured and releeued wyth pensions, &amp; maintayned there, sithens their ouerthrowe here: what letters of Marck or disguised Pyracie against En∣glish subiectes graūted to <HI>Don Thomas Coppley,</HI> graund Lorde of the Maze, Gatten, Roughey, and of many otherga∣ping sounds of petie titles, &amp; such other little fellowes, besides Stories Cōmissi∣on:
<PB REF="16"/>How in those dominions daily boo∣kes haue bin published with open war∣rant, priuiledge, and allowaunce most slaunderous to the Queene, and sediti∣ous against her state: How the traite∣rous Papists are there vpholden in cre∣dite and dignitie, who doubte not con∣tinually to affirme, that he cannot erre that hath pronounced our Queene de∣priued: what deuises haue bin vsed by one Embassadour, a holy bishop, the Bi∣shop of Aquila, against her Maiestie and her Counsell: How by an other Em∣bassadour De Spese, lewde and vncome∣ly letters haue bin written vnder saucy signes of the names of <HI>Oriane Amadis,</HI> and such vnprincely toyes, audaciously to reatch at the honour of such a moste vertuous, high &amp; noble Queene: Howe the same rashe personage hath not bin misliked there for his so doing: How the <HI>Bull</HI> of her Maiesties depriuation, &amp; of the assoyling of her subiects frō their alle giaūce, hath bin printed, spred abroade,
<PB REF="16"/>set vpon posts, &amp; magnificētly deliue∣red to knowledge in the low Countryes remayninge vnder that Princes rule: How in Spaine it self, her Ma subiects are daily takē &amp; imprisoned, manacled tormented &amp; exquisitely murdered in cōtēpte of her Maiesties honour, and <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> safe freedō of mutual trafique: How <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> ho¦ly Inquisitiō is permitted dayly to rage against Englishmē, for praying to God euen on Seabord, accordīg to the lawes of the Church of England: Howe the Prince excuseth thē, by saying he cānot disobey the Church. And must he obey the Church, in following their sentence that the Queene of Englād is depriued of her Crowne? The euident apparence that he lacketh onely opportunity to in∣uade England: a thing most apt for ex∣tending his conquest, and a thing most needefull for him, wherewith to reteyne the rest of his owne.</P>
<P>One most vrgent neede, not to haue him to strong. One most important pol∣licy,
<PB REF="17"/>to hold warre farther of, rather thā to draw it home. Infinite are both the reasons &amp; occasions that this cause de∣liuereth.</P>
<P>For the cōmoditie, behold (say they) the fruitful land: the dominiō of Sea by si∣tuaciō: the neerenes of the Continēt to hold our warres, or do displeasures far∣ther of from England: the rule of trade both of the riuer of Rhene, and land of Germany: the commodities passing that vvay both for Marchandise and Naui∣gation: as Cables, Pitch, Tarre, Mastes &amp; other matter for Shippes, to be plen∣tifull to ourselues, &amp; scarce to our ene∣myes at oure pleasures, the greater in∣crease &amp; safety of the trade of our mar∣chants euery where. But of these profits there is no end. And among other this is the greatest, that they vvill not (like Ireland) be chargeable, but a most Noble encrease of reuenevves to the Crovvne, able at their ovvne charge to defende themselues vnder her Ma∣gisties
<PB REF="17"/>name &amp; protection, and to serue the Realme of Englād: a Nauie ioyned with her Maiesties Nauie, and mari∣ners able to hold and driue from Sea all Princes in Christēdom. Finally Safety, Riches, Strēgth, and honour.</P>
<P>For right, their offers (say they) make it apparent both by discent in her Ma. (if the holder against his oth vvil stand vpon discent alone): electiō by the Sta∣tes vpō breach of othes &amp; pacts: on tho∣ther parte rightfull conquest vppon iust causes, for so manifest iniuries &amp; perils: a conquest I say, yet with a sweete and easye yoke to y<SUP>e</SUP> people willing to receiue it. For facility, is to be marked (saye they) their owne offer, the readinesse of the people to embrace, their owne strēg∣the to haue stand thus long alone, the di∣stracting of the aduersary, &amp; all cōmodi∣ous opportunities, delyuered by God him self. And to all these good meanes, the moste glorious acte to releue the Church of God against Papists, the vio∣lators
<PB REF="18"/>and enemyes of publike naturall and Christen fayth, the great meane to appease the controuersies of Christen∣dome for Religion.</P>
<P>Adde also the noble pollicy &amp; fitnes, to enter into vniuersal league of Chri∣stians against the Pope &amp; Popish con∣spiracies: the aide of so noble a Prince, y<SUP>e</SUP> Prince of Orenge, so able, so worthy and so likely a man to serue Christendom a∣gainst the Empire of the Turcke, &amp; ty∣ranny of Rome: the greedy ioye of her Maiesties people to follow her pleasure in pursuing of such a noble enterprise.</P>
<P>Thus you see what I haue heard say on all sides: I leaue to you the iudgment of all these conceits: I leaue to Counsellers the gouerning of vs all by the best adui∣ses and directions: who (I doubt not in their wisedoms) do see the best: &amp; in this Parliamēt cā lack no help of consent &amp; sinewes, that this Realme cā giue. And I leaue to God the guidinge of harts &amp; successes.</P>
<PB REF="18"/>
<P>But beside all that I haue noted be∣fore as y<SUP>e</SUP> opiniōs of other, this you shall take as mine owne full beleuing: that it is not in our will to haue peace by lettīg them alone, when the aduersary tarieth but to subdue them, that he may aduaūce himself agaīst vs. But to hold warre fur∣ther of, both in place and time is novv offered to her Maiesties Election. Peace she cannot haue sure, by peace.</P>
<P>And one notable matter I hear of: they be most desirous <HI>y<SUP>t</SUP></HI> England will receiue them: but rather then they will returne to their old thraldome, they will creepe vnder the yoke, euen of the Muscouite or Turke himselfe. Much rather will they yeld them to Fraunce, that hath now so many armies ready to take hold of thē, if Englād reiect thē. That consequence may proue ill for vs: And I do not take it certaine that Fraunce shall for euer haue ciuill warres. It maye be that God after the bloud of so many Martirs, wil giue peace to his Church in Fraūce. You
<PB REF="19"/>see ther is but one life betwene them &amp; the successiue raigne of many tollerabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prīces. If God should bereaue the world of the present French king sodenly, or o∣therwyse blesse Fraunce wyth an other or that the Kinge of necessity yelde to a firme peace: How easly vpon our refusal vvill the alliaunce of the Prince of O∣renge wyth the house of Fraunce, draw Holland and Zeland to Fraunce.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>IKE AS in time paste, oure aduersaries haue alwayes frō the beginning pickte quarrels against our cause, with intente to procure a greater mislike thereof in all mennes mindes, and to that ef∣fecte haue framed many fayned slaunders, in layinge to our charge, that wee are not onely fallen awaye from the fayth, but also become rebells against the Maiestie of the Kinge of <HI>Spaine</HI> oure soueraigne and naturall Prince, to thende that vnder the shadowe of such fine coulours, they mighte both blemishe the eyes of the simple sorte which are altogether ig∣norante of the cause, and also seeme closely to couer their owne disordinate greedines of gaine, euen to the face of the wysest, vn∣lesse they bee the better acquainted wyth those affayres: Euen so wee ascertaine oure selues, that they will not sticke (by all meanes they maye) hereafter likewyse to practise the drowninge and vtter suppressinge of all such true dealing, as doth nowe but begin by litle and litle to come to lighte. They publishe and proclaime, (althoughe moste vntrulye) that wee are the persōs that will giue no eare to any agreemente, be it neuer so reasonable:
<PB N="2" REF="20"/>and that we endeuour our selues to seeke no∣thing els but how we may maintayn this ciuil dissention and dangerous warres within oure owne boosome, although it procure the vtter destruction of this our poore Country: and all for oure pleasure (they say,) because wee are minded to bend our wills &amp; appetits to crosse his Maiestie. Thus do they still cauil. VVher∣fore to thend that none may hereafter by gi∣uing to light credit to their false reports, so much abuse themselues, as to condēne those that are innocentes, and to iustifie such as bee most cruell enemies to iustice: VVee thought it most necessary (after many supplications at diuers &amp; sōdry times exhibited vnto his ma∣iestie) yet once againe to publish this our last request made vnto him, &amp; therwithall to lay before your eyes, all such meanes as haue bin made on our parte for the appeasinge of this warre, as ye may most plainly perceiue by se∣ing of such letters, as haue bin written on ey∣ther part to that effect, without adding or de∣minishing any thing therin, to thēd that euery man may iudge without any suspicion, accor∣ding to the truth of the matter. Meaning thereby most manifestly to show forth, both in whō lyeth the originall cause &amp; beginning of
<PB N="3" REF="20"/>this warre, &amp; also who is most to be blamed, for that we attaine not vnto a perfecte peace and vnity. Moreouer, that we haue alwayes acknowledged the kinge of Spaine to be oure Soueraigne Prince and liege Lord, as one gi∣uen vnto vs of God to rule and gouerne vs with all iustice and equity, according to such contractes as we weare both bound vnto, and according to such aunciente Rights, Vsages, Liberties, and Priuiledges, as hee hath bin most solemply sworne vnto: and that we haue alwayes had our recourse vnto him most hū∣ble and with al due reuerence. For albeit that some pretending a fayned desire of quietnes and vnity in our Country, haue priuately per∣swaded vs, that in oure treaty of peace, wee must looke especially to the obseruing of two points, that is to witte, that respect of the dig∣nity and Maiesty of the King be kept moste inuiolable, and that in anye wyse no mention be made of the alteringe of Religion: and al∣though we haue had most euident proofes to perswade vs, that this is not the way to mitti∣gate the mortall hatred of oure enemies, but rather to encrease and sharpen it: Yet neuer∣thelesse wee haue in all pointes behaued oure selues so reasonably, and wyth so great humi∣litie,
<PB N="4" REF="21"/>as euen our enemies them selues cannot accuse vs (and say truly) but that we haue in all pointes obserued a dutifull order, as moste plainly shall appeare by the discourse followīg. Considering that wee haue franckly remitted the whole iustice of our cause, vnto the Iudg∣mēt of his Maiestie, &amp; the generall estates of our Countrie. Hoping that they, both beinge better acquainted with our estate, &amp; also bet∣ter affectioned, both to the King and countrye then Straungers can bee: mighte the rather haue both the meanes &amp; the will, to giue such counsell vnto the king, as may be most expedi∣ent for the seruice of his Maiestie, for the e∣stablishīg of a perfect peace &amp; vnitie amōgst vs, and last of all, for setting our coūtry in her auncient prosperitie. Hereuppon our aduer∣saries (contrary to our expectacion) haue be∣haued themselues with suche parcialitie, as they woulde not once so much as haue any re∣garde or respecte vnto our request made vnto his Maiestie, but vsurpīg the soueraigne do∣miniō of our Country, they haue cleane depri∣ued his Maiestie from all libertie of Iudgmēt, and according to their owne appetite &amp; will, cleane barred oure cause frō all knowledge of Iustice, of set purpose to hinder all concorde.
<PB N="5" REF="21"/>And that haue they done principally (as they themselues confesse) for because we haue vr∣ged the generall assembly of the Estates, whi∣ch beyonde all memorie of man, hath alwayes ben vsed heretofore amongst our auncitours and Predecessours. Besides this, to make their malice more manifeste, they haue euer since committed greater cruelties in burning and scorchīg such as were of our Religiō, than e∣uer they did before. Moreouer, they haue sou∣ght to brīg in all the rest of the Estates of our coūtry with threatnings &amp; force, of purpose to make thē serue their turne towards thexe∣cutiō of their tyrānical appetites. VVherby it appeareth most plainly, that they are not con∣tent with hauing once raised this great blou∣dy warre to the preiudice of his Maiestie, &amp; vtter destructiō of his Country: but do shall en∣deuour themselues to procede with their ty∣rānous deuises, to thend they may subdue the Countrie at their owne pleasure, and bring it into perpetuall seruitude &amp; bondage. More∣ouer wheras they make shew at some times, of a desire to entre into some treaty with vs of agreement: they do not pretend that to any o∣ther end, but onely to deceaue vs, and by such a fayned dissimulatiō, to hold the other Tow∣nes
<PB N="6" REF="22"/>and Villages in some good hope, that they may not ioyne themselues with vs to resiste their tirāny, hoping that by this meanes they may come to their purpose, Like as they haue already procured in Fraūce by their vndirect and priuie practises. But such is our trust in y<SUP>e</SUP> bountifull mercy of our good God, by whō we haue bin so myraculously defended hitherto frō their wicked enterprises, as wee not onely hope to escape frō the daunger of their diue∣lish deuises, but also that all people &amp; nations of Christendome, all Kings &amp; Potētates, and especially the Maiesty imperiall with the E∣lectours &amp; Princes of the Empire, seing here by most clerely our faithfull and sincere hum∣lity, &amp; our most sure and certaine equity, ioy∣ned with our feruēt desire to attaine to peac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and vnity, &amp; cōparing the same with the dis∣dainful pride &amp; cruell tirāny of our aduersa∣ries: will yeld vnto vs their indifferēt fauour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and maintaine the iustice of oure cause by a∣cōuenient meanes they may. And if peradui∣ture it fall out hereaster, that we be forced by the vniust &amp; vnreasonable procedings of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aduersaries, euē against our willes to seeke &amp; serch for som other relief more to our assurāce &amp; safety, thā we haue don heretofore: we hope
<PB N="7" REF="22"/>that euen then they will not impute the fault thereof vnto vs, but vnto oure enemies, who haue forced vs therunto. VVherof we require all and euery person by maner of protestacion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be aduertised herein, that we only haue re∣course vnto the Iustice, equity, &amp; wisedom of the most high, and renowmed Maiesty of the Emperour, &amp; to all the most noble and excel∣lent Electours and Princes of the Empyre of Almaigne, together with all the potentates of Christēdome, that they may take some care of our cause, &amp; not giue credit or hearing vnto the slanderous reports of our aduersaries, but cōsider somwhat neerer the indifferēcy of our cause &amp; mainteigne the same, so farre forth, as duty to God &amp; the world doth require. Al∣so wee do aduise all the Estates of these Lowe Coūtries, to cōsider herein as it were in a glass what estimaciō our enemies make of them, &amp; withall to imagine how they determine to hā∣dle them, if their deuises take such effecte as they do desire. VVherefore let them beware that for wāt of courage or other occasiō they suffer not thēselues to be abused by their fay∣ned and double dealinges, Altho they make shewe of a feruente affection for the perfecte peace &amp; quietnes of oure Conutry. But rather hauinge regarde vnto their tyranni∣call
<PB N="8" REF="23"/>call euill meaninges, which they beare in ge∣nerall vnto the Estates of our Country. Let them resolue thēselues, couragiously to resiste such insolencies, and call to minde both their othe and dutie that they owe to their Coūtry and by all industrie seeke the maintenance of the good and lawfull rights, contracts aend li∣berties of their foresaide country. In the do∣ing wherof, they shall not only do a good deede in their life time, but also leaue vnto their posterity a good report to their immortal glo∣ry. Now then to thende you may the better vnderstād theffect of the letters folowing, and the ground of all the matter: You must be ad∣uertised, that at suche time as <HI>Mounsieur Philip</HI> of <HI>Marnix,</HI> &amp; <HI>Mounsieur</HI> of <HI>Mont Saīt Aldegōdy,</HI> being prisoners at <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> had (by the licence and commaundement of <HI>Mounsieur</HI> of <HI>Noircarmes</HI>) written diuers &amp; sondry times vnto the Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> as touchinge the meanes to enter into some communication for finishing of these present warres: the matter was brought to such per∣fection, as that after the death of the forena∣med <HI>Seig.</HI> of <HI>Noircarmes,</HI> the persons were nominated, which were to be imployed in this matter. But in the meane time happened the
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>ouerthrow of <HI>Mounsieur</HI> the <HI>Coūte Ludovvyk,</HI> and for that cause it seemed not good vnto the great Cōmaundador, to proceede any further herein: alledging that thereby, the aucthori∣tye of the King shoulde be somewhat dymi∣nished. Neuertheles the said Cōmaundador wished and aduised all the townes of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> to addresse them selues vnto the King by maner of supplicatiō, to this end, that the effect of the agreement which mighte en∣sue thereof, mighte be attributed rather vnto the bountye, and liberalitye of the Kinge, than to any righte or equitye that we mighte looke for of dutye. This Kinde of dealing was cause sufficient, why this treaty ceassed, vntill suche tyme as <HI>Mounsieur de Champaign,</HI> sent a letter vnto <HI>Mounsieur Charles de Boisot</HI> Gouernour of <HI>Mydleburch,</HI> the tenure whereof follweth her-afterword forword, with an anuswere the∣reof made by his Brother <HI>Moūsieur Lois de Boi∣sot,</HI> being marked with. A. and. B. But vnder∣standing that he was absent by reason that he was sent of a message into <HI>England</HI> from his excellency, he thought best, him self to make a voyage vnto <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> whether it were to assist his brother in lawe <HI>Mounsieur</HI> the Coente <HI>de la Roche</HI> towardes the obteyning of a pardō then
<PB N="10" REF="24"/>published as him self sayd, or for some other pryuate affayres of his owne, I know not. But this I am sure of, that when he cāme thither, he talked at landge of the matters aforesayd with <HI>Moūsieur de Sainct Aldegond</HI> who remayned then prisoner, as with one whome he fownd yet still so affected to the furthera∣unce of our peace, as that he requested moste earnestly, that notwythstanding the difficul∣ty before rehersed, yet the pursute of a thinge so necessary for our publique weal might not be left of vpō suche a soden. Herein, he made promise on the behalf of the Prince of <HI>Orēge</HI> and of the Estates of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> that they would rather be cōtēt to leese sōme parte of their owne right, than seek to vsurpe any thing vpon the Kings Maiestie, for the which cause it was thought good to ymploy the forenamed prisoner, who presently was sent to <HI>Roterdā</HI> towards his excellency, to treat vpō exchaunge of prisoners, to thend that ther with all he might woorke somme good effect in the matters before rehersed. Prouided al∣wayes that he tooke great regard to the auct∣hority of the King, and that no poynts of reli∣gion weare in any wise mencioned It hapned also that <HI>Signeor Ian de Mattenes, Moū∣sire
<PB N="11" REF="24"/>de la Rinicre</HI> and the <HI>Aduocat Treslōg</HI> cāme a litle befor this, by lycēce also vnto <HI>Rot¦terdā</HI> for certē particuler affaires, as thei said &amp; had by &amp; by cōmitted vnto them a special∣chdarge to deale with his excellēcy, &amp; with the foresaid Estates, touching sōme good meane of pacification. The aunswere that theis estates gaue vnto thē followeth hereafter, woord by woord, and is marked with the. C. But as it appeareth, this aunsuere pleased not <HI>Moū∣sire de Chāpagni.</HI> Wherefore during the a∣bode of <HI>Moūsier de S.

<PB N="12" REF="25"/>him to cause all the straūgers which troubled the conutrye to auoyde from thence: submit∣ting thēselues in all things besids to any suche order as his Maitstie, and the Estates generall shoulde thinck moste meete for them (as ap∣peareth by ther request) which is marked with the letter.

And certenly this cannot be brought to passe: so longe as theis straingers shalbe suffred to exercise their force, and tirannie, whose gaine and proffit dothe more consist vpon troubles and disor∣dres, than in any good gouernment of the countrie. For they be suche persons, as na∣turally are moste sludious of their owne parti∣culer proffit. Loe here the speciall cause and mocion of this warre. Wherfore it may please his Maiestie: to cause theis straun∣gers to retyre them selues, and afterward by a franke communication together with the aduice of the generall estates of the countrie, dutifully assembled, to set so good order, pollecy, and gouernment amongst vs, as that the Subiectes of his Maiestie may from hencefoorth assure them selues from all perrils and inconueniences that may happen vnto them. And forasmuche as (of wee may speake franckly) noughte els can bee looked for, by the continewance of this warre, but only a dispeopling, a solita∣rynes, and an vtter Ruyne of all his Maie∣sties countries in theis partes, specially for

<HEAD>E. A Supplication to the Kinge</HEAD>
<P>In most humble wyse doo all the Knightes and Townes of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> pro∣test that at all times and places they haue yelded bothe vnto your Maiestie, and to your Predecessours all humble obedien∣ce,
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>reuerence and seruice, whensoeuer it hath bin required for the maintenaunce of the greatnes, glory and Maiesty of your highnes, as became good, and faithful vass∣als and subiects to doo: in respect whereof they nothing doubte but that your Maiesties affection is increased thereby, the rather to conserue &amp; mayntaine thē in all their rights and liberties, with all quietnes and tranquil∣lity, vnder sounde Iustice and good pollicy. Now whereas the Duke of <HI>Alua</HI> being then Gouernour for your Maiestie ought by good reason to haue shewed himselfe conformable to all things before sayd: Yet hath he cleane contrariwyse vnder the title of his gouerne∣ment, committed such iniuries and violences vppon your countries and subiectes, as well spirituall as temporall, as well noble as not no∣ble; as that your poore subiectes for the pre∣seruinge▪ and keepinge of their priuiledges, rightes, aunciente customes, and allowed li∣berties, haue bin forced againste theyr will to withstande with force and armes, the proude and violente kinde of gouernmente of the said Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> and his adheren∣tes and straungers. VVho haue soughte
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>by all meanes to hinder the quietnes of your common weale, by raysinge vp pernicious ne∣welties, vnwonted exactions, and generall op∣pression of your Maiesties subiectes. We see they shoote at noone other marke, but onely to subdue thinhabitants of your Coūtry to their appetits, and insolencies, onely to impouerishe them, and bring them to bondage to the great hinderaunce of your Maiesties seruice, dig∣nitie, and dominion. Whereof your saide oratours haue already moste openly made su∣ite and protestaciō, euen as other estates and prouīces haue oftē sued for the same respect. This notwithstāding, the said Duke of <HI>Alua</HI> persisteth and continueth still in his wicked determinacion, whereby not onely the forena∣med Coūtries of your Maiesties, and thinha∣bitours therof are brought into great altera∣cions, calamities &amp; troubles of warre: but al∣so the kingdomes, countries and nacions ad∣ioyning, haue conceiued a maruelous hatred &amp; horrour of the disdainefull pride of these straungers and ill willers, enemies to the cō∣mon quiet, for that by them they finde both losse, and laying a side of all trafique and han∣dicrafts, of all marchauntes trade, and pro∣speritie.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
<P>Nowe therefore, seing that your poore Ora∣tours haue not hitherto sought, neither do at this present seeke for any other thing, than to procure as much as they may, thaduaunce∣mente of their Country cause, for the better seruice of your Maiestie, as becommeth loyall subiects to do: They most hūbly request with all reuerence, that it would please your Ma∣iestie like a most gentle father, to behold &amp; loke vppon the miserable and pitifull Estate presente of these Lowe Countryes, and to set them againe in some good vnity, trade, and tranquillity. Whereby both the greatnes of your Maiestie may maruelously encrease, and also the prosperity of oure countrymen grow and florish in your seruice. And surely this cānot be brought to passe, so long as these straungers shalbe suffred to vse, and exercise their tyrannical gouernment, in our country: Considering, that all their gaines, and cōmo∣ditie, consisteth more in disquietnes &amp; con∣fusion, than in any good order or rule. And surely by daily experience wee finde, that they by nature are rather giuen to their owne gre∣die gaine and appetites, than to seeke for any good to these Countryes, where they be but mere straungers. And this is th'occasion of
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>our troubles and presente warre. May it therefore please your Maiestie, to cause these straūgers to be drawen away from hence, and by fre communication and aduise of the na∣tural Estates of this Country being generally and lawfully called together, to set and esta∣blish some such good order pollicie and rule, as the saide Countries and subiectes of your Maiesties, may from henceforth be the bet∣ter mainteyned in one vnity and assured trā∣quility, and voyde of all troubles and incōue∣niences that are to come hereafter. More∣ouer, consideringe that at the length by the cōtinuaunce of these present warres, nought els can be hoped for, than the pillinge, dissolu∣tion and vtter destruction of your Maiesties Countryes on euery side: and so much the ra∣ther, for that wee see thinhabitaunts therof to giue themselues euery day more and more vnto th'exercise and feates of armes, forget∣ting quite, and laying aside their wonted tra∣fique and trade of Marchaundize: And su∣re it is, that men by nature are most commō∣ly enclined to all kinde of licentious libertie that warre bringeth with it, in such sort, that by longe vse, and practize of the broyles in warre, such rigour and hatred will encrease

<P><HI>M. Iunius</HI> I did not a whit miscaste my accompte, when as at oure laste beings
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>together in the presence of your self, and <HI>M. de Carmes,</HI> I did declare vnto <HI>Monsire de Monte Saint Aldegonde,</HI> that I feared greatly lest the writing which he brought frō <HI>Rotterdam</HI> would find but litle fauour in the Court. For from the time that I first arriued there vntill this houre, hauing tried in euery corner how it might be taken, I finde that the opinions of all men here do so farre differ frō the desiers of all mē there, as I dare not deale any further therein: and therefore I thought it best, to sende you this letter together wyth the selfesame request, that <HI>M. de Mont S. Aldegond</HI> brought vnto me annexed there∣unto, to whom I would not write, for that he may receiue no papers without perusing, ney∣ther could I write into your quarters, but by the same cōdicions. As I haue declared vnto you before this time: so do I thincke at this present, that som other forme of writing had bin more fit for all parts. For albeit that that which he brought was in the maner of a sup∣plication, (as in deede all subiects ought to do towards their Prīces:) Yet this which they of <HI>Holland &amp; Zeland</HI> haue offred, is to farre besides the quallitie that should be loked for in that respect. For first &amp; formost they would
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>that the king should disarme himself, &amp; that he should not be serued but with such as they like: not considering at all, that it lyeth in his power both to take or leaue armes, when hee himself listeth. Who knoweth what is conue∣nient for his subiects, and his affaires, better than himself? or who can tell better then he, what kinde of people will serue his turne best for the profit and commoditie of the same? Whereas in deede, it is not permitted to sub∣iectes, no not in a good cause, to take armes but by the appointment of their Lord, neither to call in any straungers as those of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zelande</HI> haue done: therefore their faulte is so much the more greuous, &amp; inex∣cusable, in taking theym vppe against their Prince, or against his officers which is al one, since that they be ordained by him to repre∣sēt his person, &amp; to occupie his place, because he himselfe cannot be in all places at once.</P>
<P>But forasmuch as they haue offēded already by entering into armes of their owne priuate auctoritie, and by taking the kinges Townes, wherof, or of the restitutiō wherof they make no mention at all: in very deede, in steede of their demaunding of that thinge at his Ma∣iesties hand, which they of your side oughte to
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>performe if reason mighie take place: they should trust to the clemency of their Printe, and referre themselues wholly thereunto. On thother side, it seemeth also very straung, that subiects, wil seeme to inforce their Price to follow their appetite in assembling of Esta∣tes, yea and that generally amongst a sorte of Seignories, which in degrees, iurisdictions, &amp; customes haue nothing in common, but onely neighbour hode th'one with thother. In deede they haue one Lord who oftētimes hath giuē them leaue to talk at their pleasure for their owne benefite, about their affaires, not mea∣ning that this his bounty shoulde bee wrested vnto any preiudice against himselfe: for it seemeth certaine by the request of this assem∣blie, that they woulde make lawes, and keepe him as Warde. Of all other pointes which I passe vnder silence, (whereof neuerthelesse I haue oft giuen my verdite, that his Maiesty may not in any point yeld vnto) I will reherse no more at this present. Of all those matters, I talked at lardge with <HI>Mon. de Monte S. Aldegonde.</HI> Neuertheles the great desire that I had to do some good as touchinge the quietnes of this Countrie, if God woulde permitte, and his earnest requiringe that
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>I woulde not lightly leaue of from this enter∣prise, haue made me to do the best that I can, althoughe I dispaired of any good issue before I began. Surely I am sory, besides the gene∣rall cause, euen in particuler, for such as I thought very well of. And for the frendship that I haue borne vnto the house of <HI>Mon. de Monte Saint Aldegond,</HI> I would haue wi∣shed that he had concluded somewhat more touching the affaires of <HI>Mons. le Count de Bossu.</HI> For after that report was made here, of the aunswere that was made touching that matter, by <HI>M</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> vnto <HI>M. de Monte S.

I haue thoughte it good to make this rehersall vnto you of all that is paste since I retourned from <HI>Mountforde,</HI> partly to let you vnder∣stande of my foreward good will, and partly to aduertise you to seeke other meanes that were more expediente for the pacification of these your calamities.

Desiring you that you wilbe a witnes to all the worlde, how that they haue presented the foresaid request, and thereby haue satisfyed some part of their du∣tie: And so maye you moste truly excuse and iustifie them, if any question do arise hereof. And to thend that your Lordship may know the grounde and cause of their complainte, and wherefore they thincke themselues so extremely iniured by the sendinge backe of their foresaid request: I haue thought good to gather together in forme of discourse, the principall Articles of all their cōplaint vpon your last letters, the which I mēt to haue sent you before this time, but that I wayted for your mans comming to me for my aunsweare to yours, whoe beinge come receiued his dis∣patche without any long staying.

<HEAD>H DISCOVRSE.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, first men may thinck it straunge, that the opinions of your Court ingenerall haue bin so farre alienated from those agreements which our men did most desire, that (as your letter mencioneth) you durste not once open your mouth any further touching, that mat∣ter. For it is altogether vnlikely that you whō I haue accompted alwayes, and do accompte to be a noble gentleman, desirous both of the
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>preseruatiō of his Maiestie, and of the quiet, and tranquillitie of the common weale: haue withdrawen your self from a busines so much importing the seruice of the king, and the ge∣nerall quiet and safety of the whole country: vppon the opinion of certaine priuate men, and of small countenaunce in the Court. For therein you should not onely do wrong to that noble minde, and valiaunte courage which I haue alwayes seene in you: but also it mighte be a discredite to the greate duty, and truste you owe to his Maiestie. Wherefore, I saye that their opinions of whom you spake, haue proceeded from certaine of the priuie Coun∣cell in these estates, vpō whom the king hath reposed his chiefest confidence, touchinge the gouernment and rule of these Coūtryes. The which Councellours, are sworne to reueale &amp; make knowen euery thing, which in their cō∣sciences may any way bee preiudiciall to the kinges highnes, or commoditye. They make vs thinck assuredly, that you haue not conferred at all with thē of any such matter: for if they had receiued any incklinge at all thereof, of necessity it muste haue come to the kinges ea∣res, or at the least to their eares who had full power and auctoritie to deale therein. Wee
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>cannot comprehend nor imagine what should so much coole your courage, and make you a∣fearde to preferre openly our requeste, the which of necessitie (as you know) must come to their vnderstanding. And the rather be∣cause that with you they doe altogether con∣dempne and mislike the doinges of certaine confederate gentlemen, who preferred the like suite vnto <HI>Madame de Parma,</HI> in the yeare 1566. especially, because that they did not rather vse a meane more ordinary, ei∣ther by some of the Estates, or els by some one principall man in the Courte, who in their names might haue exhibited their supplica∣tion, and not to haue aduaunced themselues so boldly, and in such maner, as they did. Not∣withstandinge, by this your example you seeme to allow, and iustifie them. For you say, that if the Courte cannot digeste a supplica∣tion or suite, it is great folly for any one man, thoughe of auctoritie (as your selfe is) to take vppon him, the preferringe vppe of a∣nye suche matter, but rather by sendinge it backe againe to incurre all daungers, which maye happen for wante of exhibitinge the same in conuenient time. But whereas you saye, that you haue not broken the
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>matter to any mā, but onely groped their min∣des a farre of: surely it seemeth to be nothīg answerable to that professed zeale, and great affection you haue alwayes seemed to beare vnto the Mat. of the king, &amp; good of his coū∣trie. The which in my iudgemente, seemeth most manifest, in that you were aserd to pre∣sent a request so expedient both for the king and his countrie. Wherfore, if the euent of thinges hereafter shall happen to frustrate &amp; deceiue their opinions whose minds you haue but groped a farre of: assure yourselfe it is impossible for you to eschew some excedinge greate blame, in that you reiected and sente backe without any occasion, a request of such importaunce. For thoughe you ment not to follow the matter your selfe, yet mought you haue vttered it openly, excepte by your owne auctoritie you woulde seeme to depriue both King and countrie of so necessary a meanes, as to haue consulted and determined, con∣cerning the pointes of a generall pacificatiō. Moreouer, if those Courtiers in auctoritie and of the priuie counsell haue seene the fore∣said requeste, and would not make the Kinge acquainted therewith: yet should they at the least either haue published that selfe same
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>thing, which they wolde not communicate, or els haue geuen somme good aduice &amp; coun∣saill vnto vs, withowt vsurping after that sorte their aucthoritie, in a matter that so particularly did touche the Kings owne per∣son. For if you respect but the othe only (whe∣reby his Maiestie was sollemly sworne (&amp; there vpon admytted in to this countrie) ne∣uer to refuse, or reiect any Bill, or supplicaciō whatsoeuer, of any of his Subiectes, howe me∣ane soeuer, and muche lesse of corporacions and whole Prouinces: Surely you nyghte haue showed a singuler care and earnest desyer for the perfourmaunce of the same. Moreouer, yt is altogether disagreeing from the lawe of nature, (the which worketh effect in all people and nations) that a Prince (to whom the people haue committed their forces to thend they may be gouerned by iustice and e∣quitye, and haue their causes harde) should reiect them withowt making any care or coū∣tenance to vnderstand them. This did <HI>A∣drian</HI> the Emperour know very well, being a Pagan and one that knew not God: who ha∣uing a supplicacion presented him in the streetes by a poore woman, aunswered that he had not conuenient time to looke vpon suche
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>small matters: but she nothing dismayed, re∣plyed, that if he had not leysure to peruse the particuler requestes of his poore subiectes, he shoud haue farre lesse leysuer to rule &amp; com∣maunde: her reason was becaus yt was the duty of a King to dooe Iustice. With which aunswere he feeling himself touched to the quick, forth with acknowledged his fault, and afterwards perusing her request, gaue her presently her righte. By theis we are tole∣arne in how great faulte they ar, which make the King culpable bothe before God and the worlde, in taking away from him the meanes to heare and vnderstand the requestes of his subiectes, yea &amp; of his townes and whole Pro∣uinces. The which is not only disagreeing from the naturall care of Princes to their Sub¦iectes: but also against the profession of a Christian, yea and cōtrary to the particuler othewhich he is sworne vnto. And sure in theis respects owr Prince is more heauely charged, and hathe more to aunswere for, than had that Emperour <HI>Adrian.</HI> But since you alle∣dge some apparaunce of reasons, whereby it semeth we ought many wise to cōmit the Iudg∣mēt of this Present quarel to the arbitriment of the Prince: I beseeche you consider of what
<PB N="43" REF="40"/>force your perswasions may bee with them of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland.</HI> Marke whether they cā be made to beleeue the contrarye, but that by theis meanes they haue been moste yniu∣rioustye dealt withal, and the Maiestie of their Prince the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Coūte</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> moste extremely abused and set at nought.</P>
<P><HI>You say, they vvould that the King shoudle disarme him self.</HI> Surely if it weare soe: Yet might they aunswere, that so long as the King did holde the sworde in his hand, redy to murther them at his pleasure, yt were great folly, (but more daunger) for them to humble them selues, and to shew that dutye which ought to be in subiectes to their Prince. For what could minister a greater likelyhod to haue all their throtes to be cutt by creditt, than this? For if he bee not armed against them, they will neuer wishe him to laye asyde his weapens. And contrarywise, if hee bee, it followeth that hee becommeth, not as their King (that is to say, as their father and pastour,) but (which is more pro∣per for him) their vtter enemye and des∣troyer.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="41"/>
<P>But God forbid, that those good Subiectes of <HI>Holland</HI> &amp; <HI>Zeland</HI> which haue alwaies borne an especiall dutie and honour to their prince, &amp; likewise haue fownde in him a sin∣guler kinde of clemencie towardes them, shoulde bee constrained to thinck that their king is in armes against them, and so bent to their ruine and destruction, as that he will not giue eare or harken to their complaintes. Nay, they cōplayne rather that certen straū∣gers, suche as are not knowen to the King, neither allied by blood nor affinitie, nor that once can cary good meaning to theis low countries, are cōme in the Kings name, armed at all pointes to exercise barbarous and Tur∣kish Tyrannies of their owne aucthorities: nothing esteming the solemne othe &amp; firme composicion which the King had made, but haue brought in with thē a new world, aswell contrarye to the auncient pollecie &amp; custome of lawes &amp; priuileges, As also against the au∣ctoritye of the Kings Maiestratie and offi∣cers, whom they pray with all humilitie, that yt woolde please him by his aucthoritye, to cause them to lay aside their weapons, and to retire thē selues, leauing the country to that gouernment which was vsed before tyme, of
<PB N="45" REF="41"/>long cōtynewaunce, by the predicessours of the Kings Maiestie: of glorious memorye. The which if it were brought to passe, there should be no subiectes more dutifull▪ none more redy to acknowledge the aucthoritie of the Prince ouer them, nor none more ioifull to accōplishe what soeuer shoulde be commaunded them. And I pray you, how coulde you lay (I will not say any foundaciō of peace) but only some fained apparance of an agreement, except that theis as ringleaders doe first geue vp their weapens and get them packing owt of this coūtrie? vnlesse you thinck that the mea∣nes to attaine to peace, dothe consist in setting straungers (yea &amp; straungers of such cōditiō) in possessiō of the Subiectes goods (moueables, &amp; ymmoueables,) &amp; to let thē vyolate their wynes and children: and that for a full end of such their benifites and fauours, the subiects mighte doe well to interteme &amp; cherish them to cut al their throtes, so as they might at once plead full possession, and the King be ryd of his trew subiects.</P>
<P><HI>But you say, that they demaūde that the Kinge shoulde not be serued of any, but of suche as they themselues vvoulde appoint him.</HI> It shall neuer bee founde, that euer they did so muche as
<PB N="46" REF="42"/>ymagine, that the Ki. might not make warre against his enemies, whosoeuer or of what cō∣dicion soeuer they weare, with suche and so many as he thought good, and that they be not so euill aduised as to prescribe any lawes to his Ma. especially in a thing sovnreasonable. But they hūbly beseeche his Ma. that Straū∣gers be not lycensed, (only vpō priuate quar∣rels) to make warre against the countrie, and townes of the King &amp; his subiectes: And that Spaniardes▪ Italiās, Swissers, &amp; an infinite nomber of others, miht not deuide amōge thē the booties, and spoiles gotten within his Ma. dominions, or at least that their goodes, their wyues, and children, be not made praies nor subiectes to the thraldomme of so barbarous, and vnknowen people in theis partes. The which suyte, can not be construed anywaies that the King shold altogether lay a side wea∣pens. For if at any tyme his Ma. woulde make warres in theis partes or in any other, he might be hable to leauy as great an army of <HI>Hollād</HI> &amp; <HI>Zeland</HI> &amp; theis Countries on horse backe or on foote, by sea or by lande, as easely should be hable to resist, or rather ouercōme his grea¦test enemyes, as yt hathe been apparētly seene by the Predecessours of the Kings Matestie
<PB N="47" REF="42"/>the dukes of <HI>Burgōdy,</HI> &amp; Lordes of this coū¦trie. Whoe whē they had no straūgers neither <HI>Spāiardes,</HI> nor <HI>Italiās,</HI> yet weare neuer des∣titute of suche souldiars, as were sufficiēt for the defēce of their coūtrie. But on thother side Duke <HI>Charles</HI> the hardy, as long as he did put his trust &amp; cōfidence in theis coūtriemen &amp; thinhabitantes of theis partes, &amp; gaue no en∣tertainmēt to any but <HI>Burgoniōs</HI> &amp; <HI>VVal∣lons:</HI> he prospered allwayes &amp; had the victo∣res, in so muche as he was feared of all his neighbours. But after he begane to geue credit to straungers, &amp; woulde be serued of <HI>Italiās,</HI> &amp; such like which were vnder the charge of one called <HI>Campobasso,</HI> the case was altered anon after. For by the treason of this foresaid <HI>Cāpobasso</HI> (corrupted either by money, or by somother meanes) the Duke hauing receiued the woorse at two battailes, at the third being before <HI>Nancy</HI> lost bothe his lief, &amp; al the ho∣nor which his faithful Subiectes of those coū∣tries had gottē before. Not with standing if it be not lawfull to intreat the King not too bee serued in theis warres of any but theis coū∣trymen his Subiectes: Why then haue the Estates generally desired the same of the <HI>Commandador</HI> at <HI>Bruxels?</HI> or why hathe their sute ben accepted, synce yt bare all
<PB N="48" REF="43"/>one show of Rebelliō against the Kinge? For as concerning this, where you say, it is lawfull for the Kinge to be at warres or at peace with whome or when he listeth: Surely you accuse in this the Auncestours of his Maiestie, who haue alwayes vowed and sworn to the esta∣tes, not to make warre or to take any quarrell in hād, withowt their cōsentes. A thing which hath been obserued amongest Princes synce the worlde was a worlde, and by all suche as woulde not publikely be estemed as Tyrans. For seeing that not only the expences of the warre, but also all thinconueniences, dama∣ges, and mischaunces of the same do fal prin∣cipally vppon the neckes of the people: surely both naturall reason, &amp; equity requyres, that some in their behalfe (as the Maiestrate in some place, in other places the Estates, in o∣ther places the Coūsailes, assistēts &amp; Parlia∣mēts of Princes) should be admitted to speake &amp; sit in coūsaile for their be hoofe. Except they had rather follow <HI>Xerxes:</HI> who after he had assembled his Counsaile of Estates, and all the Princes and Maiestrates of <HI>Persia</HI> concer∣ning the warres he toke in hand against the <HI>Gretians:</HI> protested to them, that the chiefest and onely cause why he sent for them, was not
<PB N="49" REF="43"/>to thend they should geue him any aduice, or counsell: but that they might heare and allow of his deuice and enterprise which he had al∣ready determyned and resolued on. Where vp∣on, he was not only accompted a Tyrant, but fell into moste opprobrious and detestable in famye, which continewed, to the losse all moste of all his dominion. But for all this, here is nothing spoken to appoint the King what war∣res, or with whome he shoulde wage thē. For let him but only say the woorde, when or with whome, and he shall fynde bothe <HI>Hollanders</HI> &amp; <HI>Zelanders</HI> in suche redynes, as if the drū do but sounde, their bodies &amp; their goodes shalbe sufficient pledges to shew their willing mindes, &amp; trew hartes they beare to their Prince, the which their predicessours before them haue allwayes showed to the King, &amp; his auncestors. But here is warre made against the Kings owne countries, to ouerrunne the prouinces of his owne demaynes, to pil, to sack to put to Ruin and destruction, his owne Su∣biectes. And to be shorte, he maketh warre a∣gainst him self. A Prince withowt his Sub∣iectes is no Pince. Wherefore I meruaile you doe so muche mislike that theis poor molested people shulde humbly beseache his Maiestie,
<PB N="50" REF="44"/>that by his aucthoritye and commaundemēt, this warre so hurt full to them, so vnprofita∣ble to the King, so detestable before God, and so to be lamēted and pitied of all honest min∣des, might ceasse. <HI>You say the King knovves vvhat his subiectes haue neede of.</HI> Would youe by this maintayn that it is conueniente that the Kings Subiectes shoulde be robbed, vn∣doone, and murdred by straungers, their how∣ses burnt, their townes spoilled, their feelds wa∣sted, their inheritaūces decaied, their wyues &amp; daughters deslowred, and their childrē led vnder the seruitude of Straūgers? The which if it bee conuenyent and necessarye for the Kings Subiectes: surely it were better for thē to be vnder the protection of the moste cruel∣lest Tiraunt that euer reigned. Except (as in deed yt appeareth) the King hath not soe commaunded, synce he vnderstandes so well what is moste conuenyent for his Subiectes. Therefore haue they great reason, with all humillity to referre them selues to his moste gracious order, commaunding all forreigners too gett them packing owt of the countrie. But if you say the woorst you can, and think to cut all their throotes by a worde speaking, in saying theis men are rebels to the King, &amp;
<PB N="51" REF="44"/>therefore cannot be accōpted as his subiects: Leauing to debate this question presently, which woulde be bothe long and tedious, they wil only aunswere you thus. That if they bee rebels, you ought to leaue that to the Iudgemēt of his Maiestie, vnto whome they submitted them selues by their foresaid request, &amp; that you ought not (by sending the same backe a∣gaine) to take away from his Ma. al his righte of equitie, &amp; Iustice, &amp; frō thē all the meanes they had for their iustification. And as tou∣ching that which you take for a Maxime <HI>That it is not lavvful for any subiecte to take armes in handes, vvithout thorder and appointment of their Lordes:</HI> It will appeare to al mē of Iud∣gement, that it is suche a kinde of speache, as can haue no good ground of truthe, because yt is so generall. For if the Lorde be owt of the countrie, and the said countrie be sodenly in vaded by enemyes, I doe not thinck that your meaning is in this case by this your lawe, that men shoulde make adoubt of taking weapens in hand, vntill their countrie weare clene o∣uerrunne &amp; spoilled. For by that meanes you must condemne the Dukes of <HI>Burgōdy</HI> the Predicessore of his Maiestie, of fellony and treasō, for that they being then the vassals of
<PB N="52" REF="45"/>the King of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> yea (and that more is) lincked very nere vnto him in bādes of blood, and hauing yelded vnto him their homage &amp; fealtye, did take armes, not only withowt his appointment, but also against his owne person and estates in the feeld. Surely no mā cā make me beleue, but that the good Duke <HI>Phillip</HI> knew very well, what was the dutye of a sub∣iect, whē as (to reuenge the deathe of Duke <HI>Ihon</HI> his father, who alitle before had slayne the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> brother to the King (he caused the King of <HI>England</HI> to comme into <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and made him Lorde of the Cittye of <HI>Paris,</HI> and of the best parte of the whole kingdome. If this lawe which nou set downe here, were so generall as you woulde make it surely he had neuer atteined vnto the name of so good a Prince as he was accompted, neither had he lefte behinde him to his post∣erity so good a reporte of immortall glory as wee know of. Likewise his sonne <HI>Charles</HI> the hardy, when he tooke armes against <HI>Lois</HI> the. 11. and defeated a parte of his armye at <HI>Monthelery:</HI> knew not hee very well that subiectes mighte make no sturre withowt appointment or aucthoritie from their Lorde? wil you say then that owr King doothe
<PB N="53" REF="45"/>wrongfully enioy the countye of <HI>Burgondy,</HI> the which was graunted by the same <HI>Lois</HI> and <HI>Charles,</HI> vnder the title that the subiect did beare armes against his liege Lorde? But howe often hathe it been sene, and iudged to be right and reasonable, that the subiectes in particuler, and the Townes and Prouinces in generall haue taken Armes in such cases as this, not only withowt the appointment of their Lorde, but also euen against their soueraignes them selues, and yet hathe nether your lawe nor Maxime been of sufficient waight against the reasons, and argumentes that they alledged in defence of their equytie. Wherefore of force your conclusion cannot holde, when as you inferre by this your Maxime, that they of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> haue committed an offence vn∣excusable, in hauing taken armes against their Prince. For first you shoulde haue declared that the groundes, and occasi∣ons that forste them therevnto were not reasonable, or at the least not suffici∣ent to maynteyne the equitye of their cause: and then mighte you haue had somme bet∣ter apparāce of reason. But surely it seemeth, that for becaus you wolde haue the equitye of
<PB N="54" REF="46"/>their cause quyte suppressed from the eares of the worlde, and from the knowledg of his Maiestie, you haue cleane troden vnder foote and sent backe againe their request: grownding your self only vpon the opinions of suche of the courte, as you knewe before to bee aduersaries to their attemptes. And I pray you, what if theis of owr side shall say, that they not only haue not taken ar∣mes against his Maiestie, but also that they haue not stirred, but by his consent and aucthoritie? Dothe it not seeme vnto you rea∣sonable, that the othe (which the King hath taken, and the expresse article wherin he cō∣maundeth that no man shall any longer yelde obedience vnto him self, than he obserueth the points of the artiles that he is sworne vnto) may iustifye their doinges, especially seeing that bothe his Maiestie is absent, &amp; that straungers, vnder the title of his name, haue not only broken theis articles, but also soughte vtterli to disanull that sollemne cō∣tract, the which he made at his entrye into <HI>Brabant,</HI> which is the chiefest of all the Pro∣uinces he possesseth in theis partes? for as tou∣ching that which you saie, <HI>That to beare armes against his Maiestie or his Ministers is all one:</HI> I cannot comprehend, where of that should be
<PB N="55" REF="46"/>grounded, considering that the King him self at his foresaid entry and acceptacion, dothe promise, sweare, &amp; declare, that presently &amp; <HI>ipso facto</HI> all officers, Maiestrates ad My∣nisters, shalbe taken but for sciphers, &amp; of no validity, who either haue ben heere before, or shalbe hereafter placed in preiudice of those articles, which he is sworne vnto, or that shal cōmit any thing against the same. So that the King him self dothe by his othe disgrade all suche ministers, and dothe put weapens into owr hādes, to resist their iniquitye &amp; violēce. And if that you graunte that all this is trew, in respect of thē of <HI>Brabant,</HI> but that <HI>Hollād</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> may be no partakers thereof: thē muste you needes Iustifie the Prince of <HI>Orēg,</HI> and all those that serue him, being bothe in∣habitantes &amp; naturally borne in <HI>Brabant,</HI> in that they wolde not acknowledge suche ministers, as haue violated and broken the othes and contractes of the King. And since that they wear not bounde to acknowledge or allow thē, but mighte take armes against thē it followeth that they might with good reaso occupie &amp; enioy all those landes &amp; Prouin∣ces which did yelde any fauour, or deuo∣cyon at any tyme to suche mynisters, being
<PB N="56" REF="47"/>disanulled and disgraded. And as touching the rest of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> their fault and offence can be none other, but that they bee not borne in <HI>Brabant.</HI> For I cannot thinck that you wil denie, but that the said ministers against whome they beare armes, haue brokē and violated in a maner all those articles which the King was sworne vnto at his firste entrye. And if thies things were not thus: what is he that seeth not plainly, how that in this point the Kings hands be fast tyed toge∣ther, synce that your selues doe confesse, that in all matters Ecclesiasticall and touching faithe, he is bounde to be obedient vnto the Pope, his legates, and vicars. Dooe not we know how that, that Cōmission which was cō∣cluded vpon, and ordeined amongest your ecclesiastical persons, and Bishops, to roote owt this owr religion, which you call new, was inuented and forged by Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the four∣the, being sollicited therevnto by Docter <HI>Sōnius</HI> who for that cause remayned at <HI>Ro∣me</HI> by the space of three or fower yeares, &amp; af∣terwarde broughte amongest vs into theis quarters the pestilēt seed of theis troubles, &amp; calamities, that we feele at this day? Do not we
<PB N="57" REF="47"/>knowe that it was onely the Pope, which gaue cōmaundemēt to the king, that thordinaūces of the Councell of <HI>Trent</HI> should be published here, againste the which all the Estates both Ecclesiasticall and Temporall did set them∣selues to withstand, as a thing preiudiciall a∣gainst the aunciente lawes, customes and pri∣uiledges which the king hath sworn vnto vs? Briefly, haue not all the Instruments and Au∣thours of this Tragedy bin created onely by the Pope? And who is ignorāt I pray you, that the Pope in his decres doth openly vaunte that all kinges and Princes are bound to hold all their Crownes and Scepters of him, and to obey him in euery point? Haue we no lear∣ned of our auncestours, how that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opes of <HI>Rome</HI> haue cōmaunded at their plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, the most noble Emperours and Prince▪ of Chri∣stendome, and sought to execute their wils by excommunicating and accursinge of them, as often as they would resist their pleasures? Frō whence proceeded those cruell and bloudy warres betweene the three <HI>Henries, Frede∣ricke</HI> and <HI>Philip,</HI> and an insinite nomber of other Emperours agaīst the Popes of <HI>Rome:</HI> but for because that the same Emperours, woulde not obey their Commaundementes,
<PB N="58" REF="48"/>sometimes when they willed them to make warre in all hast vppon the <HI>Sarrasins,</HI> some∣times when they woulde haue them leaue of that title which they had receiued by suc∣cession of their auncestours, sometimes when the Popes themselues would be put in possessi∣on of certaine townes and territories, which they said, they should inherite as the patrimo∣ny of <HI>S. Peter,</HI> and finally vppon any cause that it pleased them to picke, whereof all the Chronicles and Histories be filled. And what was the cause why Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> marched in publique place vppon the necke of the Emperour <HI>Fredericke Barbarossa,</HI> ad∣ding thereunto many wordes full of reproche and shame? And what is the cause againe, why euen at this day they make the Monarks and kinges to kisse their feete, but onely in signe and token of subiection which they claime as due? And presently if they be not obeyed, they thunder againste them: and pro∣nounce absolution vnto all their subiectes, although they reuolt frō that fidelitie which they owe of duty. Wherfore seing that the kīg is so much subiect to the Pope of Rome (whō in no wise we cā acknowledge to be our supe∣riour) &amp; since <HI>y<SUP>t</SUP></HI> he feareth so much his thū∣drings &amp; excōmunications: How can you ei∣ther
<PB N="59" REF="48"/>say or beleue, that his Ma. doth cōmaūd absolutely amōgst vs what he listeth himself, specially in such a matter wherin <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> Pope pre∣tendeth to haue more interrest than any man aliue? I beseech you if the king woulde here our requests, &amp; finding thē grounded vppon good reasons, were willing to graūt vs the ex∣ercise of our religiō: do you thīck that it were lawfull for him so to do? Your selfe haue tould me very plainly, <HI>y<SUP>t</SUP></HI> if the king would cōdiscēd to any such matter, you would take armes a∣gaīst him, &amp; cause (to your power) the whole coūtrie to rebell. And this I am sure your self wil not denie to haue said, whē I was with you at <HI>Mountford.</HI> Wher thē remayneth the fre auctoritie of the king to cōmaund? where is <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> greatnes of his Ma. yea rather what becom∣meth of his liberty &amp; of your Maxime, that no subiecte may take armes in hād without <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> appointmēt of his king &amp; lord, seing that one only vassal wil to his power cause al his Estats to rebell, if that the aduice &amp; opinion of his Maiesty, touching the cause of his Coūtry &amp; subiects, shal not agre with his cōceite? But I am contente to pardon you herein, conside∣ringe the zeale which you beare to the Ro∣mishe Religion, vppon condition that you
<PB N="60" REF="49"/>will imagine that oure zeale which we beare vnto our Apostolicall Religiō of the Gospel, is not a whit lesse, althoughe peraduenture it is nether so plausible in mans capacitie, ney∣ther so profitable to them that maintaine it. Yet haue we examples very freshe of the Em∣perour <HI>Charles</HI> of noble memorie, who esca∣ped very hardly from beinge excommunica∣ted by Pope <HI>Paulus 3.</HI> for that hee graunted vnto the Almaynes but onely the <HI>Interim,</HI> which was almost conformable in all poincts vnto the decrees of the Pope. And I pray you what ado was there when he willed that a generall Councell shoulde be called in Al∣maine, where the Almaynes might be harde in free disputacion? And finally was it not the Pope, that constrained him to make warre vpon the Christiās, and did oftentimes threa∣ten him with thundringes, if he wente not to worke with speede, in such sort that the Em∣perour was constrayned to couer the pretence of his warre with the cloke of rebelliō, to thēd he might draw vnto him <HI>Mawrice</HI> and th'o∣ther Princes which were confederates of the <HI>Smalcaldiens?</HI> I speake nothing here of the holy Inquisition of Spaine, nor of the Prelates of the Counsayle, which be of the Popes crea∣tion,
<PB N="61" REF="49"/>and haue made a solempne othe vnto him, neuer to agree to anye matter that they shall thinck to be preiudicial to the aduaūce∣ment of the Sea of <HI>Rome,</HI> but that they shall reueale the same, and resist it with all their power. Who seeth not how that our king is so possessed with them, as hee is not able by anye meanes in the world, to iudge any thīg in this matter contrary to their opinions &amp; aduice, vppon paine of being condempned for a rebel vnto the sea of <HI>Rome?</HI> Howe then can that be true where you say, that wee make warre vppon the king? Take away once the respect of the Pope and his Prelates, and bringe to passe that either the king himself be not sub∣iecte vnto him or els that he be content that we may be free from his lawes: and then shall you see how soone and how soundlye, wee will yeld our selues vnto the perfect obedience of our king &amp; naturall Prince, as to one annoin∣ted of God himself to do vs right &amp; Iustice? And if you esteeme this to be vtterly vnrea∣sonable, and that you meane to make the minde of oure Prince to be at the commaun∣demente of other mennes willes: do not mar∣uaile I pray you, if we pretend to be no rebels in seeking that he maye gouerne vs by his ab∣solute
<PB N="62" REF="50"/>Auctoritie, withoute receyuing lawes from others. I come now to that other poinct where you say, <HI>That it is a very straung thing for subiectes to force their Prince to assemble Estats at their pleasure.</HI> Surely this seemeth very wonderfull, considering that you cannot be ig∣norant, how that the king himself by his owne pure will, hath tyed himselfe thereunto, as to the firmest ground and surest staffe whereup∣pon, his auctority &amp; power Regall doth chiefly (yea I may say, onely) leane &amp; rest. For seing the Estates in a fourme of politique gouerne∣ment, are none other thing but the chiefe and principall heads of the people representing the body of the multitude: What thing is there, that can bee so naturally vnited vnto a good king, who desireth to be both father and Pa∣stour of his people, as are the Estates of his Country? Euē as for exāple, there is nothing that hath such affinity with the head of a mās bodye, as those members which are called vital, for that they be the chiefest Instrumēts by the which the vitall spirits proceding from the braynes to diuers sinewes, are communi∣cated in generall to the whole body, and to e∣uery member, and by the which likewyse, e∣uery member retayneth his perfecte vnity,
<PB N="63" REF="50"/>and naturall knitting to the body. Euen so a good king, being the head of his people, doth by the meanes of his Estates, communicate and imparte vnto the whole body of his cō∣mon wealth, not onely his fauoure, grace &amp; priuiledges, whereby he keepeth them in v∣nitie: but also his bounty, Iustice and wise∣dome, from the which as out of a quicke foun∣taine, do springe good lawes &amp; Ordinaunces, whereby the people are still gouerned in good discipline, as it were in the liuely being and naturall motion of the same. This is the cause why our auncestours excelling in wisedome and perfecte pollioy, haue very well ordeyned heretofore, that especially the king should ve∣ry straightly be bounde and vnited with the Estates of the Country, not to do any thing of importaūce without communicating the mat∣ter vnto them firste, as they on the other side oughte to behaue themselues vnto theyr Prince, as to their heade giuen to theim of GOD. From hence is proceeded the great and vniforme loue and Fidelitie, which Prin∣ces in these partes haue borne to their peo∣ple, and they likewise to them. And surely this principle appeared in the person of the good Duke <HI>PHILIP,</HI> who at the firste
<PB N="64" REF="51"/>vnited all those low Countries into one body, and made many lawes, the assured vnitye which either is or oughte to bee betweene a Prince and his people. Esteeminge it better to be beloued &amp; called father by them, than to be feared and redouted of thē. For he knew well ynoughe, that loue is the surest grounde and faithfullest garde of all gouernmēts and preheminēces, in such sort, that they be great¦ly to be detested, and to be accōpted publique pestilēces, who to bringe thēselues in credite by villanies and seruile flatteries, vnder the pretence of maintayning the auctoritie of our Prince, haue whispered in the eares of his councell, that whosoeuer talketh of the gene∣rall assemble of the Estates, doth catch at the Crowne from his Maiesties head. For surely these be the auctours of all tyrānies, troubles, and insolencies: these be the disturbers of our common quiet: these be the enemies both of God and the worlde, although they attribute neuer so much wisdome and experience vn∣to themselues: doing in this case not vnlike vnto him that would dismember the parts of the body from the head, and depriue them of their vertues and naturall actions, vnder the pretence of doing good to the head. True it
<PB N="65" REF="51"/>is, that for a time they seeme to yelde as it were a staye and proppe vnto the power of Princes in causinge theym in generall to be more feared than loued: but in thende they shew themselues to seeke noughte els, but the fall of Princes, and the ouerthrow of all their people at one time: as wee see most clearely by th'example of the kingdome of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> the calamitie and ruine whereof, hath not proceded from any thing els, but by the brea∣king of thordinaunces of the Estates generall, and by sufferaunce that the kinge mighte go∣uerne at his owne appetite with absolute au∣thoritie, without hauing regard either to the body politique, or to them that should repre∣sent the same. I would to GOD that this poore Country of ours would behold it selfe in this glasse, which is so cleare &amp; so neare vn∣to it, without fallinge into the same inconue∣niences. But our sinnes being already growen to a certaine rypenes, haue hastened our vtter ouerthrowe, in blindinge the eyes of such go∣uernours, as haue perswaded our Princes to thinck, that their ruine consisteth in the As∣semblie of the generall Estates of the coun∣try, whose order is a common consente to re∣solue vppon such pointes, as do concerne the
<PB N="66" REF="52"/>tranquillitie of the same: whereas, if at the least this had bin lookt vnto in the begīning, before that those troubles did breake out in∣to so great a flame according to those instru∣ctions which the Gentlemen of the confede∣rates gaue vnto his Maiestie: surely then might all the incōueniences which haue hap∣pened since, haue very well bin auoyded. Yet at length let vs looke, although very late, first which be the grounds and occasions that hin∣der vs from hauinge recourse vnto that so ready and wholsome a remedie, which in ti∣mes past hath alwayes bin the refuge, both of Prince &amp; People, when any incōuenience did threatē them. You say <HI>That since y<SUP>t</SUP> these Coun∣tries do consist vppon diuers Seignories, vvhich in degree, iurisdictions and customes haue nothing to do the one vvith the other, but onely a neigh∣bourhode vnder one Lord: therefore they are not to compell the king to assemble the estates gene∣rally.</HI> I beseech you then sirs, If wee shoulde demaunde of the kinge to assemble onely the Estates of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> which Pro∣uinces haue alwayes bin ioyned together, and that by their aduise hee woulde ordaine some conuenient remedies for these present trou∣bles &amp; calamities, euen as his Maiesties pre∣decessours
<PB N="67" REF="52"/>the Princes of <HI>Bauier</HI> were wont to do in the like cases, not adding any other to these Prouinces, except it were <HI>Hainault</HI> and <HI>Ostrenant:</HI> woulde you iudge then that wee had any reason on oure sides? At the leaste your argumente whereon you seeme to ground moste, would seeme to be of no force. And I surely do thincke that this particuler assembly (since that you cannot abyde the ge∣nerall) were much fitter for the people of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> than th'other weare which they demaunde. But I pray you consi∣der what wrong they of <HI>Holland</HI> &amp; <HI>Zeland</HI> haue committēd in submitting themselues in their foresayd request vnto thorder of their Prince, without presuming to prescribe any law vnto him, or in referringe themselues to the Iudgement of the generall Estates of all the low Countries, to whō they were content to submit thēselues, to thend that they might not seeme to seeke to be iudges in their owne cause? And if there be no reason at all to assē∣ble the generall estates of so many and diuers Prouīces, in a matter <HI>y<SUP>t</SUP></HI> toucheth only one par¦ticuler Prouince: then I pray you, why should <HI>y<SUP>t</SUP></HI> protestatiō which the Estats of <HI>Brabant</HI> &amp; <HI>Flaūders</HI> presōted, wherin they would admit
<PB N="68" REF="53"/>Religion but that of <HI>Rome:</HI> bee preiudiciall vnto them of <HI>Holland and Zeland?</HI> Howe be it surely (if all be well considered) this dis∣ease is growen so generall in all these prouin∣ces, as it cannot be remedied but by a mede∣cine generally taken. For who knoweth not howe that in this cause, there are ioyned to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zelande,</HI> in a maner all <HI>Gel∣derland, Phriseland,</HI> and <HI>Ouerijsel</HI> wyth many both of the townes and peoples of <HI>Bra∣bant, Flaunders, Hainault</HI> and <HI>Arthois?</HI> who vnderstandeth not, that (when this re∣quest was presented by those gentlemen in the yeare 66. there were almost as many of oure Prouince, as of any other, yea and that the nomber of them of <HI>Hainaulte, Arthois</HI> and <HI>Nanin</HI> did farre exceede them of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zelande?</HI> Wherefore if some haue bin frighted by force and threatninges, some o∣ther oppressed by the tyranny of the Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> and some againe haue not bin able to finde oute the oportunities and open wayes which they of <HI>Hollande</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> haue founde: is it therefore to be saide that they ought to be barred from giuinge ayde and re∣medie to quench this great fier, and generall cause of Ruine? No: for this is certaine, that
<PB N="69" REF="53"/>the harme which proceedeth of these war∣res, doth touche the other Prouinces as neere as it doth <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland.</HI> For if it happen that these Countryes bee either de∣stroyed or alienated from the obedience of the Kinge. Consider I pray you whether <HI>Bra∣band</HI> and <HI>Flaunders</HI> with many other Pro∣uinces shalbe subiect to any inuasion that first will assaulte them or not, and how in such ne∣cessitie, hauinge loste the commoditie of the Sea, they may be releaued with vitaile, or succoured from <HI>Spaine</HI> or <HI>Italie?</HI> In so much that to barre alother Prouinces from this ge∣neralitie, is nought els than to seeke the mea∣nes to depriue the Kinge and his successours from all possession of any estate or Prouince in these parts. But let vs see how these matters will hang together. You say, <HI>That it is but by speciall grace and fauour, that the auncestoure of our king haue suffered and permitted a generall Conuocation of the Estates in vrgente affayres.</HI> Admit that it were so: yet surely it were a great discurtesie to perswade the king to shew lesse fauour vnto these Countries than his predecessours haue done: and it were the waye to force him to seeke some other kinde of superioritie, and gouernemente, cleane cō∣trary
<PB N="70" REF="54"/>to that which they followed, in such sort that thereof nought els can be hoped for, thā a contrary fruit to that which they gathered, that is to say, the hatred of subiects in steede of loue, and tyranny in place of good gouern∣ment, and finally vtter destruction in steede of flourishing prosperitie. But sure I cannot imagine that you are so ignorant of the Chro¦nicles, or such a straunger to the knowledge of the state of these Countries, as that you know not how that since the time of <HI>Charle∣mayne,</HI> these Countries and Prouinces haue euer bin vnited in one body together, with ma¦ny other neighbours &amp; borderers, vnder the title of beinge called <HI>Austrasia or Lorein,</HI> which toke that name, for that in diuision, that part fel to one of his nephews called <HI>Lho¦thayre:</HI> and how that afterward by diuersi∣ty of successours, beinge dismembred thone from the other, yet they did alwayes keepe a certaine vnitie of Amitie and alliaunce to∣gether, euen vntill the tyme of the good Duke <HI>Philip,</HI> who broughte them againe into one body, and tyed them fast and vnseperable by many good ordinaunces, lawes and priuiled∣ges, which he gaue vnto them in generall, she∣wing him selfe therein to be both a father to
<PB N="71" REF="54"/>his Country, &amp; a pastour to his people, in such sort that it was offred vnto him by the Empe∣rour and Pope for that tyme, to make therof a kingdome, the which he would neuer agree vnto, both because that he would not offer by such innouations any kinde of preiudice vn∣to the Priuiledges of the Prouīces and Tow∣nes particulerly, neither yet go against the o∣thes that he had sworne vnto them. And if you liste to alledge, that oure Kinge doth at this present occupie certain prouinces which then had nothing a do with them: I will aun∣swere, that likewise the foresaid Duke did at that time enioy certaine others, almost of like importaunce, the which haue since that time bin seperated, and dismembred in such sort, that the said good Duke <HI>Philip</HI> being recei∣ued into the possession of <HI>Hollande</HI> and <HI>Ze∣lande</HI> almost in the ende of his raigne, did leaue this coniunction of these Prouinces vnto his sonne and onely heire <HI>CHARLES</HI> the hardy, who being of a more hauty minde went about openly to make these Countries a kingdome, had he not bin hindered part∣lye by the Estates of the saide Countries whoe withstoode the same, and partly by
<PB N="72" REF="55"/>the disfauour of the Emperour <HI>Frederick 3.</HI> who raigned at that time. But let the cause be as be may: hee left vnto his daughter and heire, the succession of all the said countries, as one body vnited and knitte together with many faste and straighte bandes: after the which sorte <HI>Maximilian</HI> her husbande the Emperour, and his sonne the Archeduke <HI>Phillip,</HI> receiued the same, and in such sort lefte theim vnto the Emperour of noble me∣mory <HI>Charles</HI> the fifte father to oure Kinge: who being not content with the foresaid con∣iunction and bandes, and as it were foreseing how that afterwards some would go about to sowe hatred amongst them, and to set th'one against thother, vnder this pretēce that they had nothinge common amonge themselues: tooke awaye and abolished from theim all the diuersitie of Questions that mighte encoun∣ter them, some from vnder the Crowne of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> some from the title of the Empyre, and some from other places. And at a ge∣nerall diet of Almaigne, by the consente of all the Electours and Estates of the Empyre, hee vnited and broughte together all these prouinces into one compasse or Circle of the Empyre, ordayning and appointing that from
<PB N="73" REF="55"/>that tyme forward, all they should ioyntly and vnseperably be acknowledged too be of the Empire, and that for that cause, they shoulde pay in thordinary contribucions of the Em∣pire, as muche as twoe Electors did. And this hath been inuiolablye kept bothe of his Maiestie: of noble memory, And also by own king and Maistar that now is, so farre foorth as that his Maiestie did sende one <HI>S.</HI> of <HI>Hoochstrate</HI> into <HI>Almaigne</HI> in his name, to acknowledge the foresaid prouinces as one bodye politique ioyned to the Empire. And for such were they taken at that time: soe that I cannot sufficienly meruaile, howe you can saye that in degrees and Iurisdictions they be so dyuers, and that there is nothing common amongst them, but only neighborhod. And I pray you how hapneth yt then, that in all Cō∣tribucions and reliefs, they be euer assembled generally, and that the participaciōs of eache relif, is gathered according to the abillitye and facultie of euery prouince? Woulde you wishe that in the tyme of contributing, the prouinces shoul be but one bodye, and that whē they seeke to remedie the euident Ruine of the whole countrie in generall, eache should seeke for their remedye in particuler, with owt
<PB N="74" REF="56"/>ioyning thone to thother? surely in my simple Iudgement this thing is not onlye withowt all reason, but also dothe simell of tooto tyrran∣nius wyckednes. But what shall we say? when his Maiestie propounded the necessitie of his warre with <HI>Fraūce</HI> in the yeare 1557: in what sorte did the Estates then chardg them selues with that great burden, but only in generall? the which warre in thend of nine yeres with a single fidelitye shewed towardes their King, &amp; a woonderfull vnitye kept among thē sel∣ues, they brought to happy end by their nine yeres cōtribuciō, to the great glorye &amp; honour of his roiall Maiestie. Is it reason then that in making warre vpon a straunge Prince, theys prouinces shalbe but one body, and the Esta∣tes vnited together: and that in turninge a∣way from themselues an vtter overthrow pro¦cured by this ciuill warre, they shalbe counted diuers &amp; dismembred, &amp; not be suffred to as∣semble the estates general, to thende that by a generall remedye they may help and cure a common maladie? But is it not plaine howe that in all thinges wherein any prouinces borde∣ring together, may by any meanes be ioyned and vnited: theis countries be and haue ben always in the same sorte vnitid more than
<PB N="75" REF="56"/>any others? for from whence proceedeth that custome which they haue euer had to assem∣ble the Townes and prouinces in the exercyse of the bowe, and other armes left vnto vs by our predicessours, but only by this vnitye? Howe cometh it to passe, that at feastes and publique places, the townes &amp; prouinces haue bin alwayes called together by publique aucthority: but only to shewe the vnity of the poore countrie, euen as <HI>Grece</HI> did by the as∣semblye at their <HI>Olimpiades?</HI> Is not the name of the Base <HI>Almaignes</HI> or <HI>Flemings</HI> (as the <HI>Spaniardes</HI> do cal vs at this day) cō∣mon vnto vs all? The speache althoughe it be distinctly of diuers sortes, yet is so common a∣mongst vs, that in the self same townes they be vsed equallye. The iurisdictions owt of owr soueraigne court, doe they not almoste gene∣rally proceed from Machlyne? and all spiri∣tuall processes, Doe not they of auncient custome proceed eyther from <HI>Coleigne</HI> or from <HI>Maians?</HI> What shoulde I say more, than that owr whole countre is but one Circuyte or Prouince of the Empire? Doe you then thinck yt so straūge, that an Imperial Circuyt shoulde assēble estates iointlie, cōsydering that
<PB N="76" REF="57"/>shoulde otherwise seeme monstruous, if one Prouince should be assembled withowt the rest? But paraduenture you will say, that this warre in the respect of <HI>Brabant</HI> is no Ciuill warres: the which sayeng no man of Iudge∣ment will affirme. And if there were none other thing to alledge, but that owr King and the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> had made al their Edicts and Plackartes of Religion in generall to all the prouinces, weare not that a sufficient Argument to confute your saying, that they haue nought in cōmon the one with thother? yea rather is it not a full iustification of the re∣quest of those of <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> in that point, if you will be ruled by right and reason <HI>Quod omnes attingit, ab omnibus probari debet?</HI> for if the rigowr of those Placartes laid vpon all theis Prouinces in generall, hathe caused a generall alteracion of the people: Why shoulde not we assemble and call together the generall estates of theis pro∣uinces, to remedye suche inconueniences as generally doe light vpon vs all? And sure this is the better cōfirmed by those two causes that you alleadged, for the which Princes in tymes past were wont to assemble generall estates, that is to witt, <HI>the benefit of their Coū∣trie
<PB N="77" REF="57"/>and the vveale of their affaires.</HI> For they coulde neuer be better spoken, of than at this present, when we treat not of one simple benifitt, but of the whole saffetye of owr coū∣trie and especiall restitucion of his Maiesties dignitye. Wherefore if euer there weare cause to assemble estates in generallitye, sure∣ly now there is greater cause soe to doe than e∣uer ther was. This notwithstanding (if I may speake of myne owne hed, witheowt thaduise of the Estates and Townes in theis partes) I doe thinck that if the King or his counsell be offended with this generallity, they will be content to haue agraunt from his Maiestie that they may lawfully assemble the states on∣ly of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> and that it will please hym to ratifie that which they shall find by sounde coūsell and deliberaciō, to be fit for his Maiesties seruice, and for their coūtries saffetye. Considering that herin (as I haue said) they haue had agreater respect to the Auctorite of the King, than to any thing els. But it seemeth that there is some other hiddē cause which moueth you to be so suspitious of this assembling of estates in that you saye <HI>that this request seemeth to be made as it vvere to tye him to a lavv, and to kepe him as a vvarde</HI> I can∣not
<PB N="78" REF="58"/>beleue but that this proceedeth rather of some ill grounded conceytes, or sinister suspi∣cions of suche in the court; as cannot disgest owr simple peticion, than of your owne good iudgement or aduise. I cannot be parswaded that you can digresse so farre from all reason. For surely you know well ynoughe, howe that the moste true and legittimate power and dignitie of all kinges, monarches, and Empe∣rours, &amp; the greatest vnitye &amp; prosperitye of all people and prouinces, dothe especialie cō∣sist, and principally depende vpon the assemble of estates: euē as it appeareth in <HI>Almaigne</HI> &amp; in al other Kingdomes &amp; Prouinces which are wel &amp; quietly gouerned. For those assembles which we call Edictes in the comon wealthe, are euen the same which in the churce of God were called counselles, the which owr aūces∣tors, holy fathers &amp; doctors in the Prima∣tiue churche helde in suche reuerence &amp; esti∣macion, as that they ordeigned that frō half yere to half yeare, or at the furthest from yere to yere, generall Sinodes should bee called as often as any necessitye required. Whereunto they euer had a moste soueraigne recourse, vntill suche tyme as that the great power of the Popes did subdewe the Sinodes by their
<PB N="79" REF="58"/>absolute aucthoritie, against the which owr forefathers at mani tymes, and especiallye in the coūcell of <HI>Basil,</HI> did moste openly resist. They ordeigned that from tenne yere to ten yeares a generall counsell and Synode should be called thorow owt all Christendome wher∣ūto the Pope himself shoulde be subiect. Which thing was so odious vnto the ambicion of the successours of that Pope, as that to their power they haue hindred euer since the assē∣ble of the councelles, so farr foor thas that in the great necessitye of Christendome, and at the earnest solliciting of the Emperour <HI>Char∣les,</HI> the councell of <HI>Trent</HI> was at length cal∣led and prolonged almoste by the space of 30. yeres after with a 1000. Kindes of delayes &amp; excuses to delay the same. After that like∣wise in the councell of <HI>Constaunce, Thoan</HI> the 32. one of the 3. Popes that were degra∣ded at that tyme, being accused of 50. articles at the least, and all those cryminall, sighing sore, aunswered thus: that besides all those faultes, he had cōmitted a greater offence, &amp; that was for because that he had suffered suche a free councell to be called as him self was bounde to be ruled by, &amp; the reby he him self was with great infamye deposed. I doe
<PB N="80" REF="59"/>alledge all this, to showe that it is the parte of Tyrantes only to mislike generall assem∣blies, and that all good Princes Kinges and Emperours haue alwaies desicred theis diet∣tes and assemblies, as all good prelates haue (to their power) procured the assemble of Synodes and councels in the Churche of God. For this is certein, that whereas many doe assemble to∣gether and consult, (whether yt be for the af∣faires of the cōmon welthe, or of the churche of God,) there ordinarily is God him self president, &amp; sendeth his goodspirit, lightninge moste commōly the eyes of a nomber in suche cases, as paraduenture one alone or a fewe cā∣not discerne awhit. Wherefore me thine∣keth that in this case they of <HI>Hollād</HI> &amp; <HI>Ze∣lād</HI> haue declared what great confidence they haue in the mercifull gouernment and cle∣mency of the King, in hauing set be fore his face the true and only meane to pacifie the troubles of this countrie. For synce that in any wise they muste make no questions of Religiō what coulde they in this worlde offer with more humilite and better right, than to submit thē solues to the Iudgement of his Maiestie: in a generall assemble of all owr estates, shewing therin that they feared not at all to haue
<PB N="81" REF="59"/>their cause brought to light before the face of the whole world and of his Maiestie, because they felte themselues cleare from all crimes which wrongfully were laide to their charge? And if their religion were so wicked as the Kinge is informed that it is: what can they do more sincerely than with humble sute to re∣quest that it might be iudged and tryed, euē by those who haue protested most plainly, that they will by no meanes admit or receiue the same? Cā there be any thing more conueniēc for the dignity and honour of his Maiestie, or for to expresse their owne faithfull seruice, than to submit themselues wholly to the iudg¦ment of his Ma. and of those Estates which he shall lawfully call together? It seemeth cer∣tainly that you amongst you do feare and flye from the iudgement and aduice of the kinge, and that you take him to be so childishe, as that he cannot discerne white from blacke, or els that your selues must prescribe him what he shall do. For you hindered our request from cōminge to his cares. It falleth out now, that your selues are they y<SUP>t</SUP> make the king a Ward, in that you will not suffer him to here the cō∣plaints and sutes of his subiectes. This is to take the Crowne from his Maiestyes head, &amp;
<PB N="82" REF="60"/>to make your selues kinges: Considering that the dignity and prehemiēnce of Royalty, doth not so much consist vpon titles and ritches, as in the discerninge &amp; iudging of the cōplaints and requests of his subiects &amp; in administrīg Iustice vnto them. The pretēce then of these <HI>Hollāders</HI> &amp; <HI>Zelāders</HI> is so farre frō makīg him a Warde, as that y<SUP>e</SUP> onely mark that they tēd vnto, is to set him at his ful liberty again, which is to iudge lawfully (accordinge to the custome of his Auncestours) vpon all the con∣trouersies, &amp; complaints of his people: which libertie you haue cleane berest him of, &amp; yel∣ded the same vnto the Italian Pope, &amp; to the Prelats of the inquisiciō, &amp; barred him clene both from hearing &amp; iudging of his subiects causes. As touching the last point, wherin you say, <HI>That in your opinion his Maiestye ought not to yelde vnto our request, no not one iote:</HI> Sure∣ly I do most of all marueile, that you woulde wish the K. to iudge no otherwyse than as you list. If you be vassall to the K. leaue the choise to his Maiestie, whether he wil yelde or not, and do not you prescribe a law, before that he himself haue first herd our requests, &amp; after∣wards giuen his iudgement vppon the same. Otherwise you will giue the worlde to vnder∣stād,
<PB N="83" REF="60"/>how that you take the king to be so igno∣raunt, as that he cannot iudge of his owne af∣fayres, or els that your opinion must be a law, whereby his Maiestie must of force be ruled. Well, if your opinion which you haue groūded vpon your owne conceite, be so fast settled in your stomacke as that you will not alter the same: Yet I woulde ye considered, that all the Estates and Cities in these quarters, be of an other minde. And peraduenture it may bee, that if the opinion of all the Estates in gene∣ral may be vnderstood the greater part of thē wilbe of our minde. If you thinck otherwyse, why do yee not suffer the matter to come to proofe, by leauinge to his maiestie full liberty to iudge &amp; discerne of all sutes &amp; requests? except your meanīg be, that we must of force take your opinion for the kings determinaciō. But surely for mine owne parte, I cannot yet be so well perswaded of your great modestie &amp; wisedome. Wherefore I am to request you, that (without suffering your selfe to be any longer blinded wyth these cauilling pretences) you indeuour your self in good faith &amp; true mea∣ninge, to further the tranquillity and quiet of these Countries, the which cannot by anye meanes be reestablished, but by this, that the
<PB N="84" REF="61"/>king may haue his auctoritie kept to himselfe inuiolablie, in hearing and cōsidering the re∣questes and controuersies of all such his Sub∣iectes, as crye and call for his helpe and mer∣cye: that hee may see some remedie for the same, by the common aduice of the generall Estates of the Countrie, and that he suffer vs not to bee oppressed by the cruell tiranny of Strangers, who seeke nothing els but to satis∣fie their couetous mindes and greedines of gaine, with the price of our bloude and wyth the vtter ouerthrow &amp; desolacion of his ma∣iesties inheritaūce in these Prouinces, to the great diminishing of his Maiesties Royall E∣state, not caringe a point though all this go to wracke, so that they may returne into their Countries againe, loden &amp; charged with the spoile of vs, from the which I hope that Al∣mighty God will defende vs with his puissant Arme, as he hath done heretofore.</P>
