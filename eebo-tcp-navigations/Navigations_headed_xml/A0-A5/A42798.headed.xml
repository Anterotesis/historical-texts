TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Good Reception the World afforded to the First Impression of the greater part of the following Sheets, has en∣gaged me to send 'em again abroad, ina more exact dress, and with considerable Additi∣ons. You will find in these <HI>Memoires</HI> a number of things which have escap'd the vi∣gilance of all former Travellers. First you have a Description of all the Islands of <HI>Cape-Verd;</HI> From whence the Author Sayling to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> where he stays long enough to know the Quality of the Country, and the Manners of the Inhabi∣tants, whereof he gives so exact a Descrip∣tion, that nothing seems to be omitted.</P>
<P>Then he pursues his Voyage to the Isle of <HI>Java Major,</HI> of which, and especially of the Kingdom of <HI>BANTAM,</HI> he gives so particular an account, that it equally serves to the Readers instruction and entertain∣ment; is both profitable and agreeable.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
What he says afterwards of <HI>SIAM,</HI> is no less useful and pleasant. He relates circumstances of that Country as were not yet known; and the Description he makes of it is so perfect and delightful, that it is easie to perceive he himself took a singular plea∣sure therein. I say nothing of <HI>Formosa,</HI> whereof he only speaks by the by, tho what he says thereof, teaches us that all Men are not made after the same manner. He ends his Voyage with a Description of <HI>Nangue∣siaque,</HI> and of the Manners of the <HI>Japane∣zes,</HI> whereof he gives a pretty, tho short ac∣count, knowing there have been great Volumes upon that Subject. And this Edition be∣ing perfect and correct, I do not question but the Reader will give it even a more favou∣rable entertainment than the former; espe∣cially being all along interwoven with such surprizing Cercumstances and Stories, as will undoubtedly render the perusal of it ve∣ry delightful; particularly at this Jun∣cture, when an Ambassador from those Countries, does make People the more de∣sirous of an account of this nature.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Sect.</HI> I.</HEAD>
<P>THO I was Born with a desire of Travelling, yet there was little probability, I could pursue my Inclinati∣ons: My Father not being Rich, and also considering, I might be useful to him, and to the World, if I learnt an honest Trade, made it his business to perswade me into an Apprentiship. What repug∣nance soever I might have to that sort of Life, I was forced to obey, at first indeed with much difficulty▪ imagining that
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
imploy would be an invincible hinde∣tance to the design I had▪ formed of see∣ing other Countries besides my own; but afterwards with delight, when my Reason made me know, that what I did, was so far from being an obstacle to my Inclination, as it opened me a way to the Travels which I meditated. Assoon as I perceived this, I was the more fer∣vent and brisk at my work; I became more tractable and more assiduous than before. I never heard the Compass men∣tioned without feeling an extraordinary joy; and when I saw Marine Cards, I could never be wear with looking on them. The passion of Voyaging did so fortifie it self in me with Age, that I had hardly attain'd Seventeen Years, but I began to grow weary of the life I led. Methoughts it was time to think of de∣parting, the difficulty was to find the means of doing so, and procuring my Fathers consent. Seeing very little like∣lihood of prevailing with him, I became extream Melancholy; the young people whose Company I frequented, knowing the cause of my sadness, dissipated it by some Discourses, which revived my hopes that were half dead▪ and as about that time I happened to let fly some words,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
which might be ill interpreted; My Fa∣ther reprehended me with so much seve∣rity, that I left him immediately, and went to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where by good luck having found, that two Ships were fit∣ting out for <HI>Genoa,</HI> I engaged my self in one of them in quality of Boatswain's Mate, being little concerned at the em∣ploy I had in it, or the place whither I went, provided only that I might Tra∣vel.</P>
<P>On the 26th. of <HI>December</HI> in the Year 1667, having set Sail, we were hardly out of the <HI>Texel,</HI> when we perceived that our two Ships were not well ballasted: thus, the shortest way was to return from whence we came, for the taking in as much Pewter and Chests of Quicksilver, as was requisite for the giving them their just Weight. After which, we made Sail the second time, on the first of <HI>Jan.</HI> in the following Year, in a time, when the Ice was extreamly thick.</P>
<P>On the 10th. a quite contrary Wind constrain'd us to put in at <HI>Dunkirk▪</HI> and two days afterwards, the Wind being bet∣ter, we pursued our Course; but we went not very far without being obliged to seek out a Haven to shelter us from the foul Weather and a very furious Tem∣pest.
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
The Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> being pretty near, we put in there and stayed until the 25th. When we weighed Anchor again, but were not destined without impediment to continue our Course▪ for on the Morrow the Wind came again to be so contrary, that we found it very difficult to get into a Neighbouring Ha∣ven.</P>
<P>At length on the 6th. of <HI>February</HI> we cast Anchor at <HI>Portland,</HI> from whence we Sail'd three days afterwards; and on the 10. the Currents carried us into the Bay of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> because they were much stronger than the Wind; but on th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> morrow the Wind made us overcom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, and was afterwards so favourable to us, that in fifteen days after we came into sight of <HI>Genoa,</HI> when we cast An∣chor behind the old Mole.</P>
<P>On the 29th. of the same Month, the <HI>Cargo</HI> of the two Ships being unload<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and discharged, by reason the Repub¦lick bought those two Vessels which sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> furnished with all manner of Ammuni▪tion for three Years, and into each of which she put an Hundred Men all <HI>Ger▪mans,</HI> except some few <HI>Bandities.</HI> By this means I became free much soone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then I expected; but as this liberty di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
put a stop to the Passion I had of going much farther, I re▪ingaged my self there∣in.</P>
<P>While the Ships were fitting out, I sa∣tisfied the Curiosity I had a long time of seeing that famous City. The Port on the South side is open, and beset in se∣veral places with little Rocks, that lie even with the Water, and are dangerous in Tempestuous Weather. 'Tis built like an <HI>Amphitheater</HI> round about the Port, and is a most pleasing Prospect to the sight. It is about Ten Miles in Com∣pass, surrounded with good Walls; which however have not the appearance of being able to hold out against a long Siege, at least, if the Besieged do not make extraordinary Efforts to defend them. Their <HI>Militia</HI> is Composed of some Companies of <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Corses,</HI> and others of light Horse; some maintained for the watching along the Coasts, and discovering the <HI>Turks;</HI> and the others, to hinder any secret Practices and Con∣spiraces in the City. The entrance of the Port is defended by Four Galleys, always ready upon occasion▪ and there are a great number of them in the Ar∣senal, which the <HI>Genouezes</HI> often lend to the <HI>Venetians</HI> against the <HI>Turks.</HI> On
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
one side of the Port stands a Tower con∣siderably high, where fires are kindled by night, for the regulating the Course of the Ships. There is at the foot of that Tower, a great Piece of Cannon mounted upon its Carriage, which is ne∣ver without a Sentinel. The Guard of the Princes Palace is of Five Hundred Men all <HI>Germans,</HI> under a Colonel of the same Nation, who have their Quarters there. As for the Buildings of the City, they are all far beyond the <HI>Idea</HI> we can conceive of them: all Palaces, all of Mar∣ble, especially along the Rivers side. But the Pomp of the Churches does exceed all these Beauties; there are Thirty Pa∣rish-Churches, in one of which they shew a Key of an exact Figure of an Emerauld perfectly good. In that of St. <HI>Bartholo∣mew,</HI> they keep the St. <HI>Suaire,</HI> whither the People flock upon the rumours of the Miracles that are done there. This Ci∣ty is very Populous, and the Merchants are there in great numbers and very rich; their Principal Traffick is in Velvet▪ and we may judge how great it is▪ by the number of the Workmen who are em∣ployed about it; I having been assured, that there was above Eight Thousand of them at the time I was there.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
On the 12th. of <HI>April</HI> we made Sail towards <HI>Velez Malga,</HI> whither we came in Four Weeks, from whence after two days repose, we made for <HI>Malgue,</HI> where we cast Anchor on the 24th. of <HI>May.</HI> We were no sooner there, but all the <HI>Bandities</HI> were set on Shore, and since that time we never heard of any of them. 'Tis well known how famous that Coun∣try is for its Wine; whereof we took an Hundred Pipes on board us, and af∣ter having provided our selves with ne∣cessary refreshments for the Sick, on the 29th. of <HI>May</HI> the Wind seconding our Designs, we weighed Anchor and made Sail towards <HI>Cap-Verd,</HI> where we were to stay and repose our selves for some time. This design made us judge, that the Voyage must needs be long; but none except the Officers, knew our in∣tention, or whither we went.</P>
<P>The 4<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>June</HI> at night we found our selves near 9 Ships which we took for <HI>Corsaires.</HI> We were quickly satisfi∣ed of the Truth; for the Men of those Ships having asked us, who we were, and from whence we came, we found they were <HI>Algermes.</HI> This News did some∣thing Alarum our Commander; but as he was brave, far from shewing, that he
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
was startled at this rencounter, he told the <HI>Corsaires</HI> with a very good grace, that he only waited till break of day to make an Acquaintance with them, and he should take it for an Obligation, would they come on board him, where he would take care that nothing should be omitted for their being well entertained. At the same time turning towards our Officers; <HI>You see Gentlemen,</HI> said he to them, <HI>what Guests we have to Treat, and what Dishes we must prepare for their good Reception; they are in great numbers as you see, but that signifies nothing, and I hope that our Cou∣rage will make them repent of their bold∣ness, if they have so much as to attack us.</HI> They made no Answer to the Com∣manders Speech, but every one running to his Post, gave him to understand the resolution they were in, of making a brave defence. And indeed, assoon as it was day, tho the Match was very unequal, all was disposed in such a man∣ner, that we had a kind of displeasure to see the Enemies, who had the advantage of the Wind, make away from us with∣out saying a word more. From that time the Heavens were so favourable to us, that at the three Weeks end we found our selves near the Island of <HI>Boa-vista.</HI> We
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
had no sooner cast Anchor there, than the <HI>Bandities,</HI> who inhabit it, brought us a great Quantity of salted Goats-flesh and other refreshments. After which we loaded about ten Chaloupes with Salt. This Island does so abound in all sorts of Fish, that provided, People fish ne're so little there, they take as many as they please: especially the great Salmon-Trouts are there in so great abundance, that we took above fifteen Hundred of them in the space of half a day.</P>
<P><HI>Boa-vista</HI> is one of the Islands of <HI>Cap∣verd.</HI> Both near, and at a distance, noth∣ing can be more agreeable to the sight; and it is for its beauty it has received that name. 'Tis very Mountainous, and about some 7 Leagues distance from the Isle of <HI>Sabu.</HI> 'Tis about Twenty Leagues in Circumference, and 'tis very hot. It has towards the North a bank of Sand of about Twenty Leagues in Length, a∣gainst which the Sea makes a terrible Noise. There are some other Banks <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so as dangerous as that, which have occa∣sioned the loss of several Ships. On the South side, there's a shelve of the same length as the former, but it is likewise beset with Rocks, whose tops are some∣times seen above Water; its extent is
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
more towards the North, and the su∣rest place of Ancorage is on the South-West, where is but fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen Fathom Water at the most.</P>
<P>In advancing towards the South, we found the Isle of <HI>May;</HI> that Island is a∣bout Eight or Nine Leagues distant from <HI>Boa-vista,</HI> and is without contradiction, the smallest of all the Islands of <HI>Cap-verd,</HI> having but Eight Leagues in Circum∣ference. In the midst of it stands high Mountains; and towards the North is seen a Plain of above a League in Breadth▪ 'Tis likewise on that side, that there is a great extent of Sand, which reaches a great way into the Sea; there is also, One towards the West, which renders the Sea very dangerous on that part. The figure of this Island is round, it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Length and Breadth being almost aqual▪ It is bordered with several little Points▪ which make as many Capes. The com∣mon Road is on the South-West, wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is but Fifteen or 16 Fathom Water. Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> behind a considerable high Point toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the North, is a convenient place for An∣chorage, when there is only Five or Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fathom Water. There is at the foot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Point a small Village of about Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Twelve Houses, from which Strang∣ers
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
may receive considerable assistance. There is nothing to be seen but Rocks amongst the Clefts whereof do grow some herbs, wherein consists almost all the Verdine of the Country, the Soil being generally very dry. This dryness joyned to the heats which are there ex∣cessive, is the reason, we never see there either <HI>Oranges</HI> or <HI>Lemmons,</HI> and all the fruit Trees consist in certain Fig Trees, the fruit whereof hardly ever comes to be ripe: or if it sometimes happens, that the colour of it is passable, the tast of it is however bad▪ Those ill Fig-trees, and some other Trees▪ that bear Cotton, are all that grow in that Island▪ but in recom∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence, there's a wonderful number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oats, and indeed the whole Traffick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Country consists in those Animals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce they vend every year an infinite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umber of their Skins.

As for Fish▪ especially the Salmon-Trouts, Guilt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heads or Goldenies, they have always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great abundance of them.</P>

Some Four Leagues from that Island, towards the <HI>South-West,</HI> is the Isle of <HI>Brave,</HI> almost a desert and uncultivated, and to∣wards the <HI>North,</HI> two or three more that are very small. On the <HI>West</HI> of <HI>Brave</HI> there is a convenient Road for the taking in fresh Water; but on the <HI>South-East</HI> there is another much more commodious; its depth is of Fifteen Fathom; so that the greatest Ships may lie by the Banks of it without danger. Above the Haven is a very Populous Village, and at some di∣stance from thence an Hermitage, the Si∣tuation whereof is very pleasant; the Fruits of this Island are Figgs, Mulbe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, Melons and Maiz; but it does not so much abound in Cattle as the others.</P>
<P>The Air of these Islands is generally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot and unhealthful; insomuch as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nhabitants are tormented with Burn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g Feavors, Colicks, Dissenteries, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>veral other Diseases.

<P>We left these Islands on the Twelfth, and on the Second of <HI>August,</HI> we came in sight of <HI>Sierra-Leona.</HI> Without seeing it, we were certain, that we were not far distant; for according as we came nearer it, we heard without ceasing, a Wind which issued from that Mountain, that resembled very much the Roaring of a Lion, from whence it had the name of <HI>the Mountain of Lions.</HI> In the Eve∣ning we went into the Pinnace, and as soon as we were on Land, we heard a terrible noise; it was occasioned by the Waves, which being impetuously thru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on between the Clifts of a Rock, made in their fall a certain noise, that is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> easie to be expressed; this <HI>Mountain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lions</HI> begins at the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ends at <HI>Cape Tagrin,</HI> or <HI>Ledo,</HI> which like∣wise bears the name of <HI>Sierra Leona.</HI> 'T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> situated under the 8<HI>th.</HI> Degree of Lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tude, and Thirteen Minutes of Longi∣tude.

'Tis seen afar off, for that it is much higher than all on the <HI>North</HI> of that <HI>Cape▪</HI> as also by reason it reaches very far into the Sea. This Country is Mountainous on the <HI>South-East,</HI> but low, flat and Marshy towards the <HI>North:</HI> There are to the Number of Thirteen Rivers, what in the Mountains and else∣where, all Planted on each side with Lemmon and Orange trees, Pomegra∣nates, and other Trees, which form an ad∣mirable Prospect at all times, even to asto∣nishment.</P>
<P>On the 3<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>August</HI> we cast Anchor in the <HI>Bay</HI> of that Mountain, and at the same time, our Commander sent to the King of the Country, Five Barrs of I∣ron, a Barrel of Brandy, and another of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine.</P>
<P>Our Deputies were kindly received; and our Presents were so acceptable, that the King and his Courtiers, who looked like wretched Fisher-men, asked, double of all that was offered 'em, by way of Repetition. We were not over-well pleased with this Complement; but as we had occasion for Water, Wood, Oran∣ges, Lemons and other Refreshments, which are there in great abundance, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranted them what they desired. From
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
that time those <HI>Caffres</HI> seem'd to us goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tractable People; they came every day on board us with Fruits, and returned very much satisfied with our kindness. In the mean while the King being allu∣ed with our Easiness to grant him hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Demand, sent word, that he expected the same Present should be made him the Third time, if we desired to have leave to come on Shore. This procedure did so Nettle our Commander, that he resolv'd to be revenged, which that he might the better effect, he dissembled his resentment, and let him know, that if he pleas'd to come on Board of him in the Pinnace he sent him, he would endeavonr to give him satisfaction. The poor King not dreaming of any Treache∣ry, did not stick to come on Board, where they only let in with him five or six of his Gentlemen; he was so full o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> confidence, that he was no sooner there, but he went directly to the Captains <HI>Cabin,</HI> where he did not doubt but that a Treat was prepared for him; but in∣stead of what he expected, he found there People who very r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dely put shack∣les upon his Hands and Feet. And what augmented the Suprize he was in to see himself so ill treated, was, that the Com∣mander
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
after having remonstrated to him, that he was too Brutal for so high a Dignity, threatned to have him Hang∣ed; and indeed the punishment had at∣tended very closely these menaces, if the Officers of the Ship had not represented, how the execution might have very ill consequences. Upon their instances, the Commander changed his Punishment, which was to be cast into the Sea: his Attendants being terrified at that sight, leapt into their Canoes, and scudded to Shore, as fast as it was possible for them. No sooner were they there, than they put themselves in a posture of Defence, to hinder us from coming on Land. Our Commander being full of Indignation at their daring to make Head against him, or fearing perhaps lest they should be∣lieve it was for want of Courage that he doubled his Presents, filled two Pinna∣ces with Souldiers, whom he ordered to cut to pieces those miserable Wretches, if they had the temerity to oppose their Landing. Those two Pinnaces being se∣conded by two more, our Men dispersed the <HI>Cafres,</HI> and took in spight of their Teeth, all that they had occasion for: and to revenge themselves fully and finally, our Commander caused their Houses and
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
their Gardens to be Plundred, and set Fire to the Temples of their Idols. In the mean time, the King having saved himself by swimming, seeing we had the better, and the lamentable condition we had reduced his Subjects to, assembled all his Forces, so as in a short time we saw a Thousand Canoes half loaden with Ga∣bions coming down the River, in all pro∣bability to have set Fire to our Ship, and make themselves Masters of our Lives: but their design had no effect by the dili∣gence we used to get away from them, and to pursue our Course.</P>
<P>During our stay at <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> we met with some <HI>Hollanders</HI> who Traded along that Coast: They told us that the King of the Country had dealt with them as he had done with us, and that in revenge they had paid him with the same Coyn, so that in less than fifteen days, he had had the affront of being Cast twice into the Sea. Our Com∣mander was upon the point of the giv∣ing one of his Ships for the <HI>Hollander<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Vessel, thinking it to be more prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than his own for the passing the Sands o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Red Sea, and for the running along these Coasts, but was disswaded from i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the Pilot.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="13"/>
<HI>Sierra Leona</HI> is the most proper place in the World for the taking in fresh wa∣ter, and all other refreshments. For besides that the fresh Water is admirably good, there grows Millet, Oranges, Le∣mons, <HI>Bananas,</HI> Cocoes, Wild-Grapes, Sugar Canes, Long Pepper, in a word, Fruits of all sort sand Species. There is moreover excellent wood both for Dying and Building, which we might have pro∣vided our selves with, as we did with all other things, had it not been for the Ad∣venture which happened to us. The Fish is very excellent, and in great quan∣tity; and all the Rocks which we saw, were covered▪ with great and excellent Oysters. Tho there be a great deal of good fresh Water, its goodness however does not continue in all Seasons; for about the Moneth of <HI>May,</HI> which is the beginning of the Rains, 'tis there so unwholesome, that in strangers it causes hot Feavors, bloody Fluxes, and other vi∣olent Diseases. The malignity of the Rain at that time is such, that so many drops are so many blistors upon the Skin, and as many Worms in the Clothes: for which reason, strangers to whom it is only fa∣tal, ought not to provide themselves with Water, until some Monthsafter it begins
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
to fall; because that towards the end it is more pure and less dangerous, which we had the experience of, not any of our Company having been incommo∣ded.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of that Country are not [however] black. Their Complexi∣on is something Tawny or Swarthy, and they make several Figures with hot Irons in their Skins. One of their fin∣est Ornaments is to boar their Ears and Nostrils, which they embelish with Rings of Gold and other Metals. The Men and Women go all naked, except a girdle made of the rind of a Tree, which hangs down to the middle of their Thighs. The further you go into the Country, the less Huma∣nity you meet with; the Inhabitants are cruel, and even eat one another; those who dwell along the Sea Coasts, are somewhat more tractable, by reason of the frequent Commerce they have with the <HI>Europeans▪</HI> The King that was Cast into the Sea, seem'd to be about Sixty Years old, was neither handsome in bo∣dy, nor of a generous temper; His Ha∣bit was after the <HI>Moorish</HI> manner, his Hat grey, but had bare-feet, wherein

<P>FRom the sixteenth of <HI>August</HI> which was the day of our departure from <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> until the 13<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> which was that of our Arrival at <HI>Mada∣gascar,</HI> we had not any considerable Ad∣venture. The first Port that we met with, was that at <HI>Antongil.</HI> As soon as we had cast Anchor, we went into a Pinnace, wherein we set the white Flag; the People of the Island did the same, but however with precaution; for they assembled upon the Mountains armed with Arrows and <HI>Azagu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> which are Staves of about five or six foot long, which they lance very dexterously a∣gainst the Enemy. This made us appre∣hend, that they designed to seize upon us, and in that Opinion we would have returned on Board, when one of the <HI>Insularies</HI> taking notice of the fear we were in, called out to us in <HI>Dutch,</HI> and bid us be of good Courage,
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>
and if we would come on Shore, he would answer for't, that no mischief should hap∣pen to us. The word of a Man we un∣derstood, dissipated our Fears; and we went on Shore, where we were kindly received by the King in Person, who was attended with a numerous Train. The King after having told us we were very welcome, had us along to his Palace. It is situated upon a rising ground, and Reintrenched on all sides: the inner parts of it are neat, and all covered with ex∣traordinary fine Mats. The King asked the Commander who he was? whither he went? and for what design he had Cast Anchor on his Island? to which the Commander answer'd, that he and his Men were <HI>Hollanders,</HI> but that they Sailed for the Service of the Re∣publick of <HI>Genoa.</HI> The King having in∣terrupted him to inform himself of some other things, the Commander was sur∣prised to hear him speak <HI>Dutch</HI> so well, and asked him the reason of it; I have, replied the King, been the Slave of a Pi∣lot called <HI>Iean Meas</HI> originally of <HI>Hol∣land;</HI> the necessity I was in, of under∣standing his Tongue for to obey him, obliged me to learn it, and you see to
<PB N="25" REF="15"/>
what perfection I attain'd in it. At our return from the <HI>Indies,</HI> where we had been, we were so shattered by a furious Tempest, that it cast us upon this Island, and broke our Masts. After that we had refitted our Ship, the day being appoint∣ed for our Departure, the repugnance I had to the Name and Life of a Slave, made me hide my self in the Island, where I have remained ever since that time. Did not you call your self <HI>Diem∣bro,</HI> said the Commander? how came you, replied the King, to know my Name? because I had a Slave in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> rejoyn'd the Captain, who had all your Features, and whose Adventures were very like yours: I brought him hi∣ther by the Accident you have mention∣ed, where he hid himself for fear of fol∣lowing me, as you you say you did: in a word, I am that <HI>John Meas,</HI> and if I am not mistaken, I meet again in you, what I lost at my leaving of this Island. You are not mistaken, replied the King, looking upon him with joy, you find a∣gain in me the Man whom you had, and whom Heaven has preserved to ren∣der you greater Services, than those you could have exacted from me at that time. You were a good Master to me,
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>
pursued he, embracing him; it is but ju∣stice, that I remember it, and it is with pleasure, I meet with this occasion, to testifie my sincere acknowledgments. I am obeyed by all here, and I will like∣wise have all obey you: do here what you please, and do not fear, that any one should have the boldness to contra∣dict you. The Commander being sur∣prized at so much Generosity, gave him thanks for his offer, which he did not merit, and told him, that he only desired the permission of changing some of his Merchandizes for those of the Country. In short, the King remained stedfast; he would needs have him to take all he had a mind to, and keep his Merchandizes. Af∣ter which, according to the Custom used amongst Friends of that Island, he offer∣ed him his Wives, and made others do the same to all those of his Ship, As the Women of that Country are not ve∣ry avaricious of their Caresses, and the <HI>Europians</HI> are a singular good ragoust to them, far from suffering us to beg their favours, they offered themselves, and that too with so good a grace, that it would have been very uncivil to have denied them.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="16"/>
While our Men were diverting them∣selves, and were all dissolv'd in Joy and Mirth, Death came to disturb it, and caus∣ed a Division, which had like to have been the ruine of us all. The Vice-Commander having languished under a fit of Sickness for some time, at last died some days af∣ter our Arrival at <HI>Madagascar▪</HI> The Commander puts the Master of his Ship into his place, and would needs have the other come on Board of his, but instead of obeying, this last sent word to the Commander, that he did not understand, why he should be deprived of a Place that was his Due, and that he would not go out of his Ship but by force: at the same time causing all his Canon to be Mounted, that was at the bottom of the Hold, and prepared himself as if he had been to fight. On the Morrow the Com∣mander seeing this Rebel had set up the Red Flagg, made preparations on his side, insomuch as nothing was expected but the Hour of coming to Engagement. In the mean while the <HI>Boutefeu</HI> sent a Chaloupe to a convenient place to take in Water; which the Commander per∣ceiving, filled his own with Souldiers, with whom he went himself, and so or∣dered the business; that he constrained 'em
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>
to yield themselves up, and put them all into Fetters, until he was made acquaint∣ed with their Design. Whereupon he posted himself in such manner, as it was impossible for the other to stir from his place. Whereupon the chief of the Rebels seeing himself shut up on all sides, and besides his Men being weakened by the loss of those whom the Commander had taken, repented of the fault he had com∣mitted, and fancied that the shortest way of reparation, was to yield himself up at the Commanders Direction. And taking along with him some of the Ships Crew, he went on Board, the Com∣mander, where as soon as he was come, he had Fetters put upon his Hands and Feet, notwithstanding the cries of his Men, who protested, that if he was not released, they were resolved to fight to the extremity, and not give any Quar∣ter. This <HI>Bravado</HI> had so little effect, that upon the first resistance, that was made to the two Pilots in the Comman∣ders Name to come on board him, they went thither as Sheep, and were treated after the same manner as the others. Those who remained being daunted by the detention of their Leaders, lost heart, and yielded upon discretion. By order
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>
of the Council of War, it was demand∣ed of all the Officers, that were revolted, except the Master, Which they would choose rather, either to burn altogether with their Ship, or to submit themselves blindly to whatsoever Orders the Com∣mander should please to impose upon them? 'Tis easie to conjecture that they chose rather to live than to undergoe so hard a Death: and indeed they promis∣ed to be more supple than Gloves, and protested after having asked pardon, not to fall any more into such like faults. As for the Master's Punishment, it was remitted until the return of the Ships to <HI>Genoa,</HI> and in the mean while, for the preventing such like disorders, they divi∣ded the two Ship's Crew, whereof the half was obliged to go board the other. This business did very much delay our Voyage, for the time of continuing it, being passed before that all was set to rights again, we were forced to wait for another <HI>Monzoon;</HI> but as in the mean time we made good Chear, and spent our time in Hunting, Fishing, gathering excellent Fruits with which the Island abounds, we were easily comforted for that Rub in our Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="18"/>
From the Coasts of <HI>Sofala</HI> to <HI>Mada∣gascar,</HI> is reckoned about a hundred and Ten Leagues, and from the <HI>Mozambiques</HI> Fourty four. It is situated on the <HI>East</HI> of the Coast of <HI>Zanguebar</HI> and the <HI>Cafrees;</HI> between the Eleventh and Sixteenth de∣gree of <HI>Southern</HI> Latitude; and extends from 72 degrees of Longitude to 81: so that it is about 350 Leagues in Length from the <HI>South</HI> to the <HI>North;</HI> 120 in its greatest breadth, and 900 in Circuit. The Island is divided into several Provinces, which are almost all parted by great Rivers.</P>
<P>The Air is healthful and temperate, the soil very fertile in Fruits, as Oranges, Pome-citrons, Lemons, very large Me∣lons, and Pulse. It produces Ginger, Rice, Cotton, Saffron, and other ex∣cellent Roots. They gather Wax and Honey; several sorts of Gums, Balm; Oyls, whose effects are admirable. There are several Mines of Gold and Silver: the Gold is much courser there than in <HI>Peru,</HI> and every where else, but the Steel of this Country is most excellent. They have very choice Trees; as Ebony, Bra∣zile and Sandale Wood, Red, Yellow and White; Palm Trees of four or five sorts, from which the <HI>Insularies</HI> draw
<PB N="31" REF="18"/>
very great conveniences: and several o∣thers which are of no less profit than these. The Precious Stones which are most commonly found there, are <HI>Topa∣zes, Amnectysts, Emeraulds, Sapphires, Hyacinths</HI> and <HI>Agats.</HI> There are nei∣ther Lions, Elephants nor Horses; but abundance of Tame and Wild Swine, Goats who bring forth four times in the Year. The Sheep are so fat, that their Tayles weigh from twenty to five and twenty Pounds. The Swine and wild Boares are there much fatter and more delicate than those of <HI>Europe.</HI> There are likewise Porcupines, whose flesh, tho something harsh, has a most particular gust. These Animals sleep there six Months together, and during that time their skin is renewed as well as that of their Hedg-hogs, which are very com∣mon in this Island. The Dogs here are very small, and most part of them flat-nosed, and without Hair; the Mon∣keys are there in Troops, never less than fifty together, some are white of the bigness of a Fox; they are cruel and hard to be tamed; but there are some much smaller and browner, that are much more docible. Some very large, that only go upon their Hind Feet, whose
<PB N="32" REF="19"/>
Skins are white, and not so tawny as the rest. These love Women to that degree, that if they meet with one, they help one another to violate her every one in his turn, after which they tear her in pieces. There are those, whose Eyes sparkle like burning Coales; these are look'd upon as much the siner; but they are so wild, that when they are taken they starve themselves to Death. They have great Numbers of Martins, Weasels and Squirrels, as likewise Scorpions, Spi∣ders, Cheeselips, and other hurtful Ani∣mals, whose Venom is so subtile, that 'tis present Death to them who are stung. All manner of Gumm is there very plen∣tiful. The Island is inhabited both by Whites and Blacks; these are for the most part of a middle Stature; and their Hair is black and Curled: The Whites are somewhat bigger, their Hair is less black, less frizled, and much longer; they shave their Beards, and are tracta∣ble and humane, because they inhabit to∣wards the Coasts. But they who dwell in the midst of the Island, never shave their Beards, nor cut their Hair. They are Brutal Savages, and without inte∣grity, like the <HI>Cafres.</HI> Treachery and Revenge are their Vertues; and those
<PB N="33" REF="19"/>
who are the best instructed in 'em are the most esteemed; but Charity and Com∣passion are Monsters which they have a horrour for; and those who have the least grain of them, are reviled and con∣temned. Idleness is natural to 'em, and they spend most of their time in singing and dancing. Notwithstanding which, they have Workmen, as Smiths, Carpen∣ters, Potters, Cord-makers, and Weavers that are expert enough in their Trades; some Goldsmiths they have, but they are none of the most dexterous. Fishing and Hunting are their ordinary Occupations.</P>
<P>The places, whither they retire, are very pitiful Cottages, which nevertheless they are used to take possession of with as much joy, as if they were the most glo∣rious Palaces. When these Hutts are in a condition to be inhabited, the Proprietors fix the day of their Entrance, and make a Feast, to which they invite their Relations and Friends; every one goes thither with Presents, for it is forbidden to come with empty hands; and those presents consist of Gold, Silver, Iron, Corn and Utensils, that are in use with 'em. Some give Oxen, Sheep, Goats, Fruits; and all this mounts so high, that at the end of the Enter∣tainment, the Proprietor finds himself
<PB N="34" REF="20"/>
largely re-imbursed for his Building and his Entertainment. The Feast lasts for some days, during which they commit several Excesses. Their way of living is very plain, for they have neither Tables, Chairs, Seats, Table-Cloathes, Nap∣kins, Beds or Pillows. Insomuch that whether it be for eating or drinking, they have only a pitiful Mat spread up∣on the Floor.</P>
<P>The Common People go almost all naked, and often without hiding what we dare not discover. Persons of Qua∣lity have a kind of Drawers, which rea∣ches down to the middle of their Legs; the rest of the body is covered very negligently with a piece of Cotton. The Women are clothed with certain Robes, which reach but to their knees: some of those Robes have Sleeves, and others none. They wear under them a kind of Drawers, which differs little from those of the Men. They have a Handkerchief upon their Necks, much like to those of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> Those Robes are made of Cotton, rinds of Trees, and of Silk of several Co∣lours, garnished with Guimps and La∣ces, that differ much from the colour of the Stuffs. All the Inhabitants of
<PB N="35" REF="20"/>
both Sexes, go bare-headed and bare-footed; except those who are of a cer∣tain Race, whose Men wear a Bonnet much like a <HI>Jesuites</HI> Cap; and the Wo∣men an Hood or Ornament in form of a Pyramid which falls down upon their Shoulders.</P>
<P>Their Weddings are Celebrated with very few Ceremonies, and upon very slight pretexts the Men put away their Wives. As it is neither a sin nor scan∣dal to Caress one another, the Men and Women make no scruple of doing so; and when Lovers are taken in the Fact, they are acquitted for a Present of lit∣tle Value. For the Maids to Prostitute themselves is looked upon as a good honest Trade: the more they gain there∣by, the more are they esteemed; and the most notorious Gallantry is the most ready way to Marriage. It is ac∣counted a kind of shame for Maidens not to know what it is before they are Contracted: they must first of all have made several Tryals, and when they have not Wit to find Gallants, their Mothers have the goodness to furnish 'em with the means of so doing, and to teach 'em to keep those whose Mistres∣ses they are. With all this facility

<P>When any Person dies, all the Rela∣tions assemble to wash the Body; af∣ter which they deck the Deceased with his finest Attire; put him on Rings, Pendants and Bracelets, afterwards they wrap him up in fine Linnen, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> last in a Mat, wherein he is carried to his Grave. This is the Custom of the Common People, but the Ceremonies of Persons of Quality there are wholl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> different. When they have washed their Bodies, and cut of all, their Hair, they pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Crown of the finest Flowers that can be found upon their Heads, then the Relations and Domesticks bewail and lament round the Body with Gri∣maces that raise Horrour. After the Tears have made a pawse, the most An∣cient of the Relations makes a kind of Funeral Oration which contains the Life and most Memorable Actions of the Defunct. After which they make a terrible noise in tingling upon Copper Basons, to the noise of which they dance

carry about them any thing of a red co∣lour, because their presence, say they, would hinder the stopping of the bloud in the Wound, All being thus dispo∣sed, the Priest approaches with measured steps, and with Devotion takes the Knife destined to that use, and ties a Nap∣kin on his left Leg; the Father and Unckles of the Child do the same upon their Arms; and in that Equipage they follow the Priest thro the Door situated on the West, into the Hut, where the Mother is in Bed with the Child. In fine, after the Circumcision, the Fore-skin is cast upon the ground, if the per∣son Circumcised be a Slave; but if free, the Fore-skin is put upon the Yelk of an Egg, whereon the Father or Unckle of the Child receive it from the hand of the Priests. After having put upon the Wound a Mixture of the bloud of a Cock and the Juice of Herbs, the Child is brought back to his Fathers House, with <HI>Huzzas</HI> and Acclamations, which last the rest of the day.</P>
<P>To see these Grimaces, one would say, that these <HI>Insularies</HI> are very Reli∣gious, and very tender of their Chil∣dren; however we may affirm, they are nothing less than that; for indeed they
<PB N="42" REF="24"/>
neither sincerity nor affection, which it is easie to prove. When they have a Child born, they give notice thereof to their Priests, who make those ignorant People believe, they read in the Stars all that happens upon Earth. The Priest pretends to consult the Heavens upon what is to happen to the Child; and according to the humour he is in, he speaks well or ill of his future inclina∣tions: and if His Holiness says, that he is born under an ill Constellation, that his manners will be corrupted, that he will be wicked, cruel and bloudy mind∣ed, from that moment the Child is carried out of the House and cast into a Bush, where it serves for food unto the Beasts. If a Woman during her big∣belly finds her self more ill than usually, they stick not to believe, that 'tis the Child who torments her, and this is an ill <HI>Omen:</HI> whereupon they give the Mother a certain Potion, which kills the Child; or if they wait till it be born, it is no sooner born, but 'tis cast into a Ditch, or into Water. This inhumani∣ty is so general, that all Women both Free and Slaves, make no scruple of lo∣sing their Fruit upon any pretext what∣soever. Sometimes it is by reason that
<PB N="43" REF="24"/>
the Mother being a Slave, takes it ill to see her self put away by her Master, who has deflowred her: sometimes for that a white Maid being got with Child by a Blackmore, has some horrour of being the Mother of a Child of a different co∣lour; and lastly, sometimes for that a Maid having got an itch to Libertinisme, and is not willing to Marry, chooses ra∣ther to kill her Children, than take the trouble of breeding them up. But if the Women are unnatural, the Men do not fall short of them in that ill Quality; for if it happens, that the Mother ex∣pires in the Delivery, the Father causes the Child to be put in the same Coffin, saying, <HI>that it is better for it to be dead, than to be brought up by Strangers.</HI> Be∣sides these unhappy pretences of getting rid of their Children, there are a hun∣dred others caused by Superstition: thus it is no wonder, that this Island, as vo∣luptuous as it is, is however so thinly populated. Those who inhabit towards the Coasts being become more humane thro Commerce with strangers, are some∣thing less easie to put their Children to Death. When the Priest has told them his Sentiment, and gives them no good hopes, there are those who will have
<PB N="44" REF="25"/>
them educated privately by Slaves, who bring them up like Beasts, to the end, (say they) that they may overcome by that means their ill nature.</P>
<P>The Island is governed by several Kings, who are almost always in War. Their Armes are Bows and Arrows, Javelins and Targets; they do not want Courage, but they Fight without Rules and Art. Their principal dexterity con∣sists in surprizing the Enemy in an ad∣vantageous Place, and keeping him in play, while the others secure the Coun∣try, and burn all they meet with. In the mean while the Women take their pleasure, and seek out all means of di∣version, but they dare not be unfaithful to their Husbands, at least, those who love them; believing that if they had any favour to their prejudice, they would not fail to be killed or dangerously wounded: whereas by making good chear without having to do with Men, the Husband would become both stronger and more couragious.</P>
<P>During our abode in the Island, King <HI>Diembro</HI> having marcht against His Ene∣mies in the Head of Seven Thousand Men, we went upon a Mountain, from whence we saw the field of Battel. The
<PB N="45" REF="25"/>
two Armies being in sight, they began confusedly with Javelins; then endea∣vouring to join, the strongest flung his Man upon the Ground, and killed him without remission; the Fight was long and doubtful, but at length, <HI>Diembro</HI> had the advantage, tho he was much in∣feriour in Number, those who remain Conquerors, return to their Homes sing∣ing, but the greatest noise comes from those, who have been made Nobles, which is performed in this manner. some days before that of the Battel, there are Detachments drawn out on both sides to skirmish; those who are the strong∣est cut their Enemies Heads off, and carry and lay them at the Kings feet, who Caresses 'em very highly, and gives 'em the Title of Noblemen: if in the following Wars, those Noblemen bring still more Heads, they are qualify'd pro∣portionably, insomuch as the Heads of their Enemies are as so many steps, which raise 'em to the highest Offices and Dig∣nities.</P>
<P>When they have a desire to make Peace, the first means to attain it, is to make Presents on both sides, and to ap∣point the day for the Treaty. The day being come, both Armies set 'emselves
<PB N="46" REF="26"/>
in Battel-Array upon the Banks of a Ri∣ver, which parts 'em: They kill a Bull on each side, out of whose Liver, Kings send one another a Portion, whereof they and their Generals eat in the presence of their Deputies: at the same time they swear to execute punctually the Articles of Peace, which they had newly agreed to; which commonly consist in never poysoning the Waters nor Cattel more; and in not burning the Houses, and in abstaining from all Pillage: Wishing that the Liver they eat may serve 'em for Poison, if they speak against their Thoughts.</P>

All the People they had on Board, leapt into the Sea, ex∣cept a Woman, whom all the <HI>Italians</HI> vitiated, in spight of our Officers, after the most bruitish manner imaginable; when their Rage was glutted, they let her go, but she was no sooner on Land, than her Husband stab'd her to Death.</P>
<P>On the 28<HI>th.</HI> we made Sail towards <HI>Indrapoura,</HI> and in our way we took two Joncks more of <HI>Arquin,</HI> that were laded with Pepper, Sandalewood, Cam∣phire and such like things.

<P>From thence we made towards the <HI>Sonda,</HI> and a little after that we were in the <HI>Streights,</HI> Fourteen <HI>Holland</HI> Ships came thundring upon us. They came from <HI>Batavia,</HI> with Orders from the Company to bring us thither either by fair means or foul; immediately they Summon'd our Commander, who ve∣ry bravely made Answer, <HI>That he was not a Man to yield till after having bravely defended himself, and that perhaps, how</HI>

<HI>strong soever they might be, they would find it difficult to constrain him to it.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> not thinking to have met with so resolute a Man, sent to <HI>Ba∣tavia</HI> to know what they were to do; the Answer was, that they should press us, and if they found themselves too weak to perform their Commissions, they should make use of the Reinforce∣ment that was coming to them, which was a great Man of War advantageously fitted out, whose help was in no wise necessary. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> having re∣ceived this Order, bid us with an im∣perious Tone, bring to them our Flag and strike Sail, or they would sink us to the bottom. This daunted our Com∣mander, who had had time to think of what he was to do: he became pensive uneasie, and perhaps he had reason so to be. His Men had still in mind the Dispute at <HI>Madagascar;</HI> he knew they hated him, and they only waited for an opportunity to be revenged for the af∣front he had put upon them. These Considerations made him inclinable to yield; but before he came to that Reso∣lution, he took Council of his Officers, who were unanimously of Opinion, that he should follow the Law of the Strong∣est,
<PB N="49" REF="27"/>
since their loss was infallible, if they persisted to make resistance; this Reso∣lution was applauded by all the Ships Crew, whose disunion was so visible, that they could hardly have lived long∣er together: thus the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were received with open Arms. We were o∣verjoy'd at the changing of our Masters, and never were any Men better pleased with coming out of Prison, than our Men were to go into it. If the passion of Separating had not been so great among them, it would have been easie for them to have made their Escape by Night by the way of <HI>Batavia,</HI> for our Ship was a swift Sailer, and those of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> so heavy, that we were always twen∣ty four Hours more advanced than they.</P>
<P>On the 15<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> the Comman∣der of the <HI>Hollander,</HI> called <HI>Jacob vander Meule</HI> came on Board us; and in the General of <HI>Batavia</HI>'s name, took an In∣ventory of all he found there. After having written our Names, and the Name of the place of our Birth, those whom they met withal of our own Na∣tion, were put apart in the <HI>Corps de garde</HI> of <HI>Java;</HI> the others remained in the Ship, whose Coffers they picked,

taking out all the Money they found there, and making their escape, the <HI>Ita∣lians</HI> to <HI>Goa</HI> and <HI>Bantam,</HI> and the <HI>Ham∣burghers</HI> to their own Country. Pre∣sently after this Plunder, our Comman∣der was found dead, and we judged, by the signs he saw upon his Body, that he was poysoned, probably by the <HI>Itali∣ans,</HI> for fear he should have defeated 'em at his return. As for our parts, we were kept Prisoners for fourteen or fifteen days, but having presented our requests to be set at liberty, we were according∣ly set free; and by order of the Gene∣ral, each Man having received the Wa∣ges he pretended to from the Republick of <HI>Genoa,</HI> it was left to his choice, ei∣ther to return into his own Country, or enter into the Service of the Com∣pany.

<HI>Java Major</HI> is an Isle declining 7 de∣grees 40 Minutes towards the <HI>Antartic</HI> from the <HI>Equinoctial;</HI> and placed in 21 degree of Longitude; a very great and noble Isle for from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West</HI> it stretch∣es one Hundred and Fifty Leagues, or of Miles Four Hundred and Fifty, and from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South</HI> Ninty Leagues, or two Hundred and Seventy Miles <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI> The Mid-land is for the most part Mountainous, and meanly Peopled; but the Maritine low, and very Populous: the first is very subject is Wind but Heal∣thy: the latter Marish and insalubrious. It may be called a <HI>Compendium</HI> of the World; for it abounds in all things that be either useful or excellent. The Coast by reason of Trade for P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per has Towns well built, and very wealthy: upon the <HI>North</HI> side and to the <HI>North East,</HI> are <HI>Bantam, Palamban, Jachatra,</HI> (now cal∣led <HI>Batavia</HI> by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but formerly <HI>Sunda Calapa</HI> by the Inhabitants, and not unlikely to be that City <HI>Sunda,</HI> where the People used with a dead Man to bu∣ry so many live fish, as he had slain Ene∣mies in his life time) as also <HI>Japarra, Tubur, Jortan, Grecy, Chiringen, Sere∣baya,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<HI>Bantam</HI> is under the <HI>Antartic</HI> declina∣tion or Latitude 6 degrees 20 minutes▪ and of Westerly variation, 3 degrees. 'Tis the biggest City in the Island, being situated at the foot of a Mountain▪ whence three Rivers rise, two whereof run by the Walls, the other thro the Ci∣ty; but all too shallow for Navigation▪ the Town is indifferently great, but Ras∣cally Houses; the Walls which are Brick, and three foot thickness, are not entirely lined with Earth, yet so flanked, that at every Hundred Paces lies a Canon, which would sufficiently secure the Cur∣tains, were it in condition for service, but their Artillery is not mounted, and they have no other Ammunition than a little Powder, brought from <HI>Malaca,</HI> where the <HI>Portugueses</HI> have a Mill. The City Gates are so wretched, that they might be beaten down with a Club; but so vigilantly guarded, 'twould be hard to approach without notice; there are neither Bastions nor Towers, but in lieu thereof Scaffolds of three Stories, which yield a strong defence.</P>
<P>In the whole City there are but three principal Streets, which all about upon the Castle called <HI>Pacebam.</HI> The one from the <HI>Pacebam</HI> to the Haven; another
<PB N="53" REF="29"/>
where the Kings Slaves and Domesticks inhabits, leads to the Gate towards the Fields, and the third to the Gate at the foot of the Mountain. The Streets are not pav'd, but are as commodious, by means of the Sand they are covered with. The Channels which in divers places cross the City, are foul and stink∣ing, in regard the Stream of the River is not strong enough to carry off the filth it brings, and what is thrown forth choaks the Water, and makes Puddles, that infect the whole City. No Per∣son of Quality, but has his private Chap∣pel, or Mosquite in his House; but one is common near the Palace on the Ma∣gazin and Stable-side. The City is di∣vided into several Posts, each of which is assigned to some Person of Quality, who commands in time of War, and gives direction in Civil Affairs. They have a Drum as big as those <HI>German</HI> Casks called Thunderbolts, used instead of Bells, which they beat with a wooden∣bar as big as a Weavers Beam, Morning and Evening, as also upon Alarums they have brass Basons, which they beat Mu∣sically and Chime upon, as we do our Bells.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="30"/>
At every corner of the Streets there stands a Guard, and at Sun▪set they draw up to make fast all passage Boats, so as in the Night there is no stirring in the Street. At the Prison-Gate, near the Palace, stands a Guard of Fifty Men: nor is there a Person of Quality, who has not one of Ten or Twelve at his House. The Town is full of Coco-Trees, nor is there a Mansion without divers belonging to it. The Houses are poorly built of Straw Reeds upon Piles made like those at <HI>Ackim.</HI> They cover their Houses with Coco-Leaves, and the sides of their Lodging Rooms have only Curtains for freedom of the Air, which is exceeding necessary in this hot Climate. For preservation of their Wares they have store Houses of Stone, but they are covered with straw, so as to secure them from fire, which is but too fre∣quent amongst them; they lay great pieces of Timber on the Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, and co∣ver it with Sand, that the Fire may not find passage. The Rooms in their Hou∣ses are only divided by partitions made of Canes called <HI>Bamboos,</HI> which they slit so thin, that a Horse-Load serves for all the Rooms in their Houses. At the Houses of Persons of Quality upon
<PB N="55" REF="30"/>
the first Entrance, you come into a Square Court, where the Guard is, and where the Master of the House speaks with such as have business with him, un∣der a little shed, covered with Canes or Coco-leaves, in one of the corners of this Court stands the Mosquite, where at Noon they do their Devotions, and not far thence the Cistern where they wash themselves. Being entred the House, you find on both sides of a very narrow Gallery several little Nicks, for Slaves to rest in, who watch there for their Masters security; by reason they are all afraid of being surprized and killed by their enemies in the night. All Foreigners, as the Natives of <HI>Benga∣la,</HI> as <HI>Gusurats, Malayans, Abyssins, Chineses, Portugals,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> ly out of Town. Here are three great Mar∣ket Places, where the Merchants meet daily; the Grand <HI>Bazaror</HI> Exchange, is towards the East part of the Town, and is the Meeting place of Foreign Mer∣chants, as <HI>Portugueses, Arabians, Turks, Chineses, Pagans, Malayans, Bengalans, Gusarats, Malabars,</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> who are there from the break of the day until Nine of the Clock, and then break up; the second Market Place is before
<PB N="56" REF="31"/>
the great Mesquite divided from it by a Palisado. To this place Women resort with Sacks, and a weight of three Pounds, they call <HI>Gantam,</HI> who buy Pe∣per of the Country People, an eight or nine Hundred <HI>Caxas</HI> the <HI>Gantam.</HI> But the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who are very skilful in this Trade, forestal them sometimes, for they go to the Peasants, and buy all they have by the lump before-hand. Betwixt the <HI>Pallisado</HI> and the <HI>Mosquite,</HI> stand Women that sell <HI>Bettele, Araca, Bananas, Melons,</HI> &amp;c. and some there are set fine Cakes to be eaten hot.</P>
<P>A little higher on the Right Hand are Armorers, who sell small pieces of Can∣non, Pistols, Sword-blades, Battle-axes, &amp;c. Not far thence, there are others that sell Sandale Wood, White and Yellow, and on the Left Hand are Confectioners that sell Sugar, Honey, and all sorts of Sweet-meats wet or dry. Near to that is the Bean-Market, where are sold all sorts of Beans, black white, red, yellow, green and gray, at the three Hundred <HI>Caxas</HI> the <HI>Gantam.</HI> Next to this is the Onion Market, where the Merchants that sell Cloth by whole∣sale come, and such as deal in return of Money, and assurances of the return in
<PB N="57" REF="31"/>
Vessels. Hard by this is the Poultry, where besides tame Fowl, they sell also Kids, Geese, Pidgeons, Parrots▪ &amp;c. com∣ing thence you meet with 3 ways, one going to the <HI>Chineses</HI> shop, another to the Herb and Pulse Market; and the 3<HI>d.</HI> to the Shambles. By the way to the <HI>Chineses</HI> shops, on the Right Hand are some Jewellers, who for the greater part are <HI>Choroacones,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Persians</HI> or <HI>Arabians,</HI> who sell Rubies, Hyacinths, Turquesses, Granats, &amp;c. And on the Left Hand is the place for the <HI>Bengalians,</HI> with their Toys and small Wares. On the back side of this Street, the <HI>Chineses</HI> sell their Silks Raw and Coloured, Da∣mask, Velvet, Sattins, Brocadoes of Gold and Silver, Purcelane Cabinets and works of Lacques, &amp;c. By the way to the Herb Market, on the Right Hand upon the Sand, are the <HI>Bengalians</HI> with their small Wares. On the Left Hand Merchants of Linnen-Cloth, and at the lower end of this Market, Married Wo∣men have Seamstresses shops; but Men are forbidden to come there under pain of a Forfeiture. Then you come to the Herb Market, where are a multitude of Simples unknown to us. Turning thence you see the Fish-market, then the sham∣bles,
<PB N="58" REF="32"/>
with Stalls full of Beef, Buffles and Venison: Then the Spice-market, where Women sell Peper, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, &amp;c. and all sorts of Gumms and Druggs, to <HI>Europians</HI> unknown: and the Rice-market where likewise they sell Earthen Ware and Salt; whence they pass by the same way they came to the place, where Merchants and Masters of ships meet about their Affairs:</P>
<P>The sale of these Commodities lasts but till Nine of the Clock, and then o∣pens the Market before the <HI>Pacebam,</HI> or Palace-Royal, where are sold all sorts of Victuals, as likewise some Pepper, which they truck with the <HI>Chineses.</HI> A∣bout Noon the Market in the <HI>Chineses</HI> Quarters begins, where nothing is sold but for the Table.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Bantam, Tuba,</HI> or <HI>Tuban,</HI> is the Chiefest Town in <HI>Java,</HI> and in effect is stronger than all the rest, and although not so great as <HI>Bantam,</HI> 'tis at least as handsome; and as well built. The Palace is exceeding spacious, and hath very fair Apartments, where Ele∣phants and other Beasts have their seve∣ral Quarters: each Elephant hath his Lodge built upon four Pillars, with a Post in the middle to tie him to. The
<PB N="59" REF="32"/>
Rooms are filled with Chests, and Ham∣pers for the Baggage, when the King goes His Progress. Near to his Lodg∣ings is a place where his Game-Cocks are kept every one in his Pen apart, and every one his keeper; as likewise the Parrats, which are much before those brought into these Parts, the greatest part of a beautiful flame colour, with a great Golden spot on the back: The out∣side of their Wings blue and red, and the in-side a lovely Carnation. They are to endure the inconveniencies of a long Voyage: besides the <HI>Indians</HI> highly e∣steem them, for that they love their ow∣ners, and delight to be made much of by them. The King of <HI>Tuban</HI> was much taken with all these Creatures, as also with Dogs, Horses, and white Ducks, much larger than ours. He had four legitimate Wives, Six Sons, and Two Daughters; besides Natural Children, a great number by Concubines, which he kept in several Apartments: His Bed was raised at some distance from the Ground, built like an Altar of Great Stones, whereon lay a Quilt, and certain Pillows of Satin, filled with raw Silk.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="33"/>
The chief Commerce they have at <HI>Tuban</HI> consists in Pepper, which they car∣ry to the Isle of <HI>Bady,</HI> where they truck it for Cloth and Stuffes of Cotton and Silk, which afterwards they bring to <HI>Banda, Toanate,</HI> and the <HI>Philippins,</HI> and other parts, to truck for Cloves, Mace and Nutmegs, The Inhabitants for the greatest part, live only on Fish. They wear no other Garments than a Linnen Cloth about the Loyns; only Persons of the First Quality have sometimes Hangselines of Chamelet, which reach but to their Knees. They are by this Habit distinguished from others Persons, and by their Trains of Slaves, without whom they never come abroad. They delight much in Horses, and to have their Sad∣dles exceeding Rich, which are made like our great Saddles; only their Trap∣pings studded with Gold and Silver, striving to appear well Mounted at Assemblies, and to shew the King their Horsemanship, and the dexterity of their Horses.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants that live in the inner part of the Isle of <HI>Java</HI> are <HI>Pagans,</HI> and the greatest part <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> believing a Transmigration of the Soul; for which reason they eat neither Fish nor Flesh.
<PB N="61" REF="33"/>
Towards the <HI>South</HI> part of the Isle, there are, tho but few, <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who ob∣serve the <HI>Turkish</HI> Religion in all things, sending for Priests to <HI>Mecca.</HI></P>
<P>They observe two great Festivals, the greater of the two begins the 5<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Au∣gust;</HI> and at the beginning of this fast∣ing <HI>Lent</HI> it is, the Slaves renew their Sub∣mission to their Masters, with Ceremo∣nies extraordinary; for they take them by the Feet, and rub 'em upwards to the Knees; then closing their Hands, they rub the Head, Face and Neck, and then unclose them again.</P>
<P><HI>Lent</HI> being ended, they celebrate their <HI>Easter,</HI> entertaining their Children and all their Domestics with a Dinner. There is scarce a Man in <HI>Bantam,</HI> who hath not three or four Wives, and some have ten or twelve, besides Concubines, who wait on their Wives, especially when they go abroad: they make no difference between legitimate and natural Children: a Father hath not power to sell his Child though he had it by a Slave. Children go stark naked, only the Girls cover their Privities with a thin Plate of Gold and Silver: they marry at the AGe of Eight, Nine or Ten Years, not only to prevent the Disorders, which in this hot Cli∣mate
<PB N="62" REF="34"/>
were inevitable, but because the King is Heir to all who dying leave their Children under Age, whom he makes his Slaves, as he doth the Widdows and Fa∣mily of the deceased. The Dowry which Persons of Quality give with their Daugh∣ters consists in Slaves of both Sexes, and in a sum of <HI>Coxas,</HI> which is very consi∣derable among them when it amounts to three hundred thousand, tho it be but much about twenty two Crowns and a half of our Money.</P>
<P>The Women appear with great De∣cency at the Marriage of their Relations, tho they use no great Ceremony. One may know the day by certain Poles, which are stuck in the Houses of the Bride and Bridegroom, with Tassels of red and white Cotton.</P>
<P>Dinner ended, they bring a Horse to the Bridegroom, whereon he rides about the Town till Evening, expecting the Slaves he is to have in Marriage, who come commonly loaden with Presents. None but the nearest Kindred sup with them, and see the new Married Couple abed.</P>
<P>Women of the first Rank are kept in such restraint, that their own Sons are not suffered to come into their Cham∣bers;
<PB N="63" REF="34"/>
and when they go abroad, which is very seldom, all give place and respect to them, even the King himself does it: nor dares any Man speak to a Married Woman without the leave of her Hus∣band. Women of Quality are known from others only by their Train; for all are dressed after the same Fashion, wear∣ing a Petticoat of Cotton or Silk, which comes from the Breast to the mid-leg, Stockings they have none, and go all bare▪headed, tying up their Hair toge∣ther on the Crown of their Head; but, when they come to Weddings or other Publick Assemblies, they wear a Coro∣net of Gold, and have Coronets and Bracelets on their Fingers, and about their Arms. They are so much addict∣ed to Cleanliness, that there passes not a day, but they bath themselves three or four times. They never do their natural Necessities, nor receive their Benevolen∣ces from their Husbands, but they go up to the neck in Water to cleanse them∣selves: they do no work at all, which is no wonder; since the Husbands them∣selves having employed two or three Hours about their Merchandize, all the day after do nothing but chew <HI>Bettele</HI> amongst their Wives, who are very sol∣licitous,
<PB N="64" REF="35"/>
by all the little Kindnesses, ima∣ginable to court their Loves, washing and rubbing 'em till they are stirred up to Vo∣luptuousness.</P>
<P>The Magistrate of the Town of <HI>Bantam</HI> sits in Judicature in the Court of <HI>Pace∣bam,</HI> from four or five in the evening un∣til it be night. The Plaintiff and Defen∣dant appear both in Person, and plead their own Cause. One only Punishment is used for Criminals; that is, they tie them to a Post, and stab them to death with a Ponyard. Strangers have this privilege, that giving satisfaction to the party complaining, they may redeem themselves from death, except they have murdered in cold bloud, or upon advan∣tage.</P>
<P>The Kings Council meets upon Affairs of State under a broad spread Tree by Moon▪light, where sometime there comes near five Hundred Persons, who part not till the Moon goes down. When the Council is risen, they go to Bed, and there ly till Dinner. Afterwards the Coun∣sellors of State give audience to all who have ought to propose to the Council. When the King comes there in Person, he sits in the midst of them, or else with the four Principal Ministers of State, and
<PB N="65" REF="35"/>
propounds the point wherein he requi∣reth their advice, or causes the Gover∣nour of the Town to propound it, To a Council of War they call the three Hun∣dred Captrins, Commanders of the Troops the Armies consist of, which are raised in the Town it self. They have a particular course for quenching Fire, which happecs but too often among 'em; for the Women have this office imposed upon them, while the Men stand in Arms to defend 'em in the mean time from Pillage.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality, when they go to Court, or through the Town, they have carried before them a Lance and a Sword sheathed in a black Velvet Scabbard, and by these Ensigns oblige all the Street to make way for them, and retiring back to sit on their Heels, till these Grandees are past. Their ordinary wear is of Stuff wrought with Silk, and they wear Tur∣bants of a fine <HI>Bengalian</HI> Cloth. Some amongst them wear <HI>Mandillions</HI> of Velvet black or crimson, and never forget the Dagger or Poniard under their Girdle. They ever go with a numerous Train of slaves, one amongst them carrying the <HI>Bet∣tel</HI> Bottel, another the Chamber▪pot, and a third the <HI>Ʋmbrello.</HI> They all go bare∣footed,
<PB N="66" REF="36"/>
it being thought a disparagement among 'em to walk with Shooes thro the Town. In their Houses many wear 'em; they are made at <HI>Achim, Malacca,</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> where are also made most part of the <HI>Ʋmbrello's</HI> used in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bantamites</HI> are haughty, self∣conceited, perfidious, mischievous, and cruel; who never fail to make an end of such they get advantage of; and having once committed a Murder they kill all in their power; for knowing Death to be their inevitable reward, their discharge their fury indifferently on all they en∣counter, without consideration of Sex or Age: so as sometimes they are constrain∣ed to kill them in the place, instead of ta∣king them to be delivered up into the Hands of Justice.</P>
<P>They generally wear long Hair, are of a Chesnut Complexion, having great Jaw Bones, flat Faces, great Eyebrows, little Eyes, thin Beard; and being of a middle stature, well set, and strongly limb'd. They are naturally addicted to Theft, and so vindicative, that to be re∣venged of an Enemy they stick not to turn upon his Weapon, and choose an assured Death to take away anothers Life.
<PB N="65" REF="36"/>
Of which there was an example during the King of <HI>Bantam</HI>'s besieging <HI>Batavia</HI> in the Year 1659. a <HI>Dutch</HI> Souldier lying in Ambushcade in a Marsh, a <HI>Bantamite</HI> little dreaming that any body had been there, came to the same place to discover the Enemy, and was by the <HI>Dutchman</HI> thrust with his Pike into his body. Up∣on which the <HI>Bantamite</HI> finding him∣self wounded, did not strive to pull the Pike out of his body, but thrust himself further upon it, to the end he might come at his Enemy, whom he stabb'd to the heart as soon as he got within his reach.</P>
<P>This bloudy disposition shews, they have courage, and would make good Souldiers, were they but as dexterous at Fire Arms, as they are at their usual weapons, which are the Pike, the Battle-Axe, and the Broad Sword, but above all the Dagger or Poniard. Their Buck∣lers are of Wood or boyled Leather stretch'd upon a Hoop; and for their Bo∣dies they have <HI>Cuinasses,</HI> the pieces being fastned together with Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls of Iron. Soul∣diers in times of Peace have no Pay, but in time War they have Arms and Cloths, and Rice, and Fish for Provision. They are all Slaves, and not only such as belong
<PB N="66" REF="37"/>
to the King, but likewise to other Lords, who are obliged to enroll them for their Princes service. They are seldom or ne∣ver idle, but imploy themselves most commonly in making Sheaths for Poni∣ards of <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood made hollow, or polishing their Arms, which they gene∣rally poyson, keeping 'em so well, that no Razor can be sharper than their Swords. The <HI>Bantamites,</HI> as indeed all the rest of the <HI>Indians,</HI> hold their Dag∣gers so dear to them, that they will not speak to any Man without that by their side, not one Brother with another, and at Night they lay it under their Bolsters. Some use Trunks, thorow which they blow little poysoned Arrows, so bearded that pulling it out, the Head remains in the Wound, which by these means be∣comes incurable and mortal. Amongst such a multitude of Villains, there are notwithstanding some honest People, but the number is very small; for except some that inhabit near <HI>Bantam</HI> upon the Streight of <HI>Sunda,</HI> at the foot of the Mountain <HI>Gonon Bezar,</HI> who were trans∣planted thither from <HI>Pasarvan,</HI> all the rest are depraved. The People not able to live under the Tyranny of the King of <HI>Pasarvan,</HI> put themselves on certain con∣ditions
<PB N="67" REF="37"/>
under the protection of the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and have built the Town of <HI>Su∣ra,</HI> which has a peculiar King, but subordi∣nate notwithstanding to the King of <HI>Ban∣tam,</HI> they living peaceably, and persevering in the exercise of the <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>The Soil is cultivated either by free People, who take it of their King or other Lords at a certain Rent, and are not bound to labour longer than by their Bargain, and may afterwards do what they please; or by Slaves, who cultivate their Pepper, Rice and Cocoes, breed Poultry and Cattel for their Masters pro∣fit, and supply his Kitchin. Some Slaves take the Cocoes at 1000 <HI>Caxaes</HI> the Tree. Others work by the day, and get Eight Hundred <HI>Caxaes</HI> the day, which is to their Masters profit. Others are not maintain'd by their Masters, but serve them six days, and the six days follow∣ing work for themselves, and so get their Livelihood. The Women-Slaves keep Market, where they sell their Masters Pep∣per and other Commodities; or else im∣ploy themselves in scouring or making Cloth, that they might not live unprofita∣bly. When they have a mind to be cas'd of them, they lead 'em from Port to Port, and sell them to him who will
<PB N="68" REF="38"/>
give most. The ordinary price for one of an able body, is five <HI>Fardoes,</HI> that is about a Pistol a piece. The Children of a Slave belong to the Master, who disposes of 'em as he thinks best; but he hath not power over the life of his Slave, without the ex∣press consent of the King or Governour.</P>
<P>The Pepper, which the <HI>Bantamites</HI> sell to Strangers, is usually mix'd with Ordure, black Sand, or Gravel; or they adulterate it some other way, either in quality or weight, as they do all their other Commodities. They keep a Trade amidst all the neighbouring Islands, with notable advantage. At the Towns of <HI>Macasser</HI> and <HI>Surubya</HI> they fetch Rice, which there they buy for one <HI>Sata de Caxa</HI> the <HI>Gantan,</HI> and sell it for double the Price. At <HI>Balambuam</HI> they buy <HI>Co∣coes,</HI> a thousand <HI>Caxaes</HI> the Hundred, and venting 'em by retail at <HI>Bantam,</HI> they sell eight <HI>Cocoes</HI> for two Hundred <HI>Caxaes,</HI> there they likewise buy the Oyl of the same Fruit. At <HI>Joartam, Gerrici Pati,</HI> and <HI>Juama,</HI> they fetch Salt at a Hundred and fifty thousand <HI>Caxaes</HI> the eight Hun∣dred <HI>Gantans;</HI> and at <HI>Bantam</HI> three <HI>Gan∣tans</HI> are worth a thousand <HI>Caxaes.</HI> They carry Salt to <HI>Sumatra,</HI> where they truck for Lacque, Pepper, Benjamin, Cotton,
<PB N="69" REF="38"/>
Tortoyse-shells and divers other Com∣modities; from <HI>Jacatra, Jappara, Cra∣vaon, Timor</HI> and <HI>Palimbaon,</HI> they fetch Honey, Wax, Sugar, &amp;c. Salt-fish from <HI>Cravaon,</HI> and <HI>Bender-messing;</HI> Iron from <HI>Crimata</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Borneo;</HI> Copper and Lead from <HI>Pepa</HI> and <HI>Gusebun</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Malacca;</HI> from <HI>Bali</HI> and <HI>Cambaya,</HI> Cotton, and Cotton-Cloth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Rich Merchants make no Voyages themselves, but venture the greatest part of their Money for more or less profit, as the Voyages are long and dangerous, and near upon the like Conditions we do here in <HI>Europe.</HI> Obligations, as all other Instruments, are written upon the Bark of a Tree, the Letters ingrav'd with a Bodkin; and they make it up in a Roll, or fold it four-square betwixt two Boards, which they tye together with a Pack-thread very neatly: sometimes they use <HI>China</HI> Paper, which is very fine and of all colours. As yet they know not the Art of Printing; but they paint their own Characters exactly well, which are rather Figures than Let∣ters. The usual Language is peculiar to the Country, but the <HI>Malayans</HI> is more general; the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Relion hath like∣wise brought in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Language.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="39"/>
The <HI>Persians,</HI> by the <HI>Bantamites</HI> called <HI>Coracons,</HI> traffick here for precious Stones, and all sorts of Gums and Drugs, and are a People to be confided in, because they are open-hearted and civil. The <HI>Arabians</HI> and the <HI>Beguians</HI> come thither for <HI>China</HI> Ware, and bring with them the Commodities of the neighbouring Islands. The <HI>Malayans</HI> and <HI>Quilens</HI> let their Money out at Interest, or upon Change. The <HI>Gusurattans</HI> are poor, and commonly Sea Men. All these Foreign∣ers are attired all of one Fashion, in a Cotton Garment, and in a Turbant of the same Stuff. At their coming to <HI>Ban∣tam,</HI> they buy a Woman that is for all Uses, and at their Departure thence they sell her again; but, if they have Chil∣dren by her they are tyed to provide for them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> are they, that bring the greatest Trade thither, the most industri∣ous to get Wealth, and live the best. They are a self-ended People, that live by Usu∣ry, and have there the same repute as the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI> They go into the Coun∣trey with a Weight in hand to buy all the Pepper they can meet with, and ha∣ving weighed one parcel, so as they may have a near guess at the rest, pay them
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>
present money, or according as they have occasion for it, and by this means engross so great a Quantity, that they have suffi∣cient to lade the <HI>China</HI> Fleet when it arrives, selling for fifty thousand <HI>Caxaes</HI> the Sack▪ what cost them but twelve thousand. This Fleet arrives at <HI>Bantam,</HI> in the Month of <HI>January,</HI> to the number of eight or Ten, and are Vessels of forty five or fifty Tun.</P>
<P>By them likewise comes the Money hither, which in the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language is called <HI>Cus,</HI> in the <HI>Bantam</HI> Tongue <HI>Pitty,</HI> and is current not only at <HI>Bantam,</HI> and all the Isle of <HI>Java,</HI> but through all the Neighbouring Islands. 'Tis a little thin Plate made of Lead, and the scum of Brass, so brittle, that letting fall a string of <HI>Caxaes,</HI> you shall break at least ten or twelve. They are made in the Town of <HI>Chincoa</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> and they are beholding to <HI>Wantay</HI> King of <HI>China</HI> for them, who lived about the Year 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, and finding that the <HI>Caxas</HI> made by his Predecessor <HI>Huyen</HI> King of <HI>China,</HI> went not off, by reason the <HI>Chineses</HI> had so filled the ad∣jacent Islands with 'em; He contrived this brittle Money, which his Successor <HI>Humedon</HI> put forth, as now it is corrupted. It hath a four-square hole through it, at
<PB N="72" REF="40"/>
which they string them on a string of Straw; a string of two Hundred <HI>Caxaes,</HI> called <HI>Sata,</HI> is worth about three far∣things Sterling, and five <HI>Sataes</HI> ty'd to∣gether make a <HI>Sapocon.</HI> The <HI>Bantamites</HI> when this Money came first among them, were so cheated with the No∣velty, that they wonld give six Baggs of Pepper, for ten <HI>Sapocons,</HI> thirteen whereof amount but to a Crown. But they have had leisure enough to see their Errour, for in a short time the Island was so filled with this Stuff, that they were compelled absolutely to prohibit all Tra∣ding, which so disparaged this Money, that at present two Sacks of Pepper will scarce come for one Hundred Thousand <HI>Caxaes.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise from <HI>China</HI> they bring Pur∣celane, which they sell here at cheap rates; for at the first arrival of the <HI>China</HI> Fleet, six pieces of Purcelane may be bought for a thousand <HI>Caxaes.</HI> They bring their Countrey Silks, Sattins and Damasks, and take away Pepper and Lacque brought to <HI>Bantam</HI> from the City of <HI>Tabenbaen, Ani</HI> or <HI>Indico,</HI> brought thither from the Town of <HI>Anier,</HI> Sandal-wood, Nutmegs, Cloves, Tortoise-shells whereof they make Chairs for the <HI>Mandowins,</HI> who prefer this stuff before Silver.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="40"/>
The <HI>Portugals</HI> that deal at <HI>Bantam</HI> live out of Town, in the same Quarter with the <HI>Chinezes.</HI> They drive here a great Trade in Pepper, Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace, Sandal-wood, Cubebs, long Pepper, and other Drugs that are sent them from <HI>Ma∣lacca;</HI> for the greater part of them are Factors, and Commissioners of the Go∣vernour of <HI>Malacca,</HI> and the Arch-bishop of <HI>Goa.</HI> At <HI>Bantam</HI> they have neither Priest nor Chappel, but at <HI>Panarucan</HI> they have both.</P>
<P>In the King of <HI>Bantam</HI>'s Dominions are all sorts of Beasts, both wild and tame: the Forests are full of Elephants and Rhinocerots, Leopards and Tygers, which are more cruel and furious than those of any other place, and do so much mischief, that People go not without dan∣ger to gather Frankincense, Mastick, Myrrhe, and Benjamin, which is there in its greatest Perfection, and whereof there were great quantity to be gotten, if the Forrests were not almost inaccessible, by reason of the Wild-Beasts, as also for Serpents, Lizards and Salamanders, excee∣ding dangerous, and of so extraordinary a growth, that there are Serpents have swallowed Children and Sheep, eaten <HI>Ty∣gers</HI> and Leopards, often come out of the
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>
Wood and make great Spoil among the Cattel which for this reason are reared with great difficulty. Their Swine have no Bristles, and are so fat, their Bellies trail on the ground.</P>
<P>The Rivers breed Fish in abundance, and Oysters have there been seen, that have weighed three Hundred Pound; a thing that would seem incredible if there were not two Oyster-shells, which weigh four Hundred sixty and seven Pounds, now to be seen in the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI>'s Cabinet at <HI>Gottorp,</HI> that were brought by a Sea-Captain from the <HI>Indies:</HI> the Cap∣tain affirming, that there was so much Meat in them, that it sufficed all that were in the Ship, being a Hundred and twenty Persons.</P>
<P>'Tis very hard to hunt Deer, Goats, Boars, and other Game, fallow or black, which abound there, in regard the Woods are so thick, that 'tis impossible to make any way through them; and the <HI>Ban∣tamites</HI> are so unskilful at their Fire-Arms, that it hath been observed, that a <HI>Bantamite</HI> having shot a wild Buffler, made a shift to kill the Beast: but, the Musquet recoyling he fell down, with his Cheek all bruised, and the loss of two of his Teeth; insomuch as these Crea∣tures
<PB N="75" REF="41"/>
may be seen in whole Herds feeding up and down the fields. There are like∣wise abundance of Apes, Foins, Squirrels, wild Peacocks and Parrots, and infinite other Birds exceeding beautiful to the Eye.</P>
<P>In the Rivers there is abundance of Crocodiles, which seize not only on Men bathing, but attempt the very <HI>Canoes</HI> as they pass along, snatching men out of 'em, and dragging 'em to the bottom. The <HI>Chineses</HI> tame this Creature, and fatten it, to be afterwards eaten as a great dainty. Their Civet yields as much perfume as that of <HI>Guiney,</HI> but it is neither so white nor so good.</P>
<P>They have two sorts of Poultry, one like ours, the other betwixt ours and the <HI>Indian</HI> kind; and these last, which are in a manner Monsters, are so furious, they will fight, till death decides the Battel. Amongst the common sort there are some whose flesh is black, yet are they very good meat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rhinocerots,</HI> by the <HI>Indians</HI> called <HI>Abadu,</HI> is not so ordinary in the Country of <HI>Buntam,</HI> as in <HI>Bengala, Patane,</HI> and other places, though there are some; and the <HI>Bantamites</HI> make so great account of this Beast, that there is nothing about
<PB N="76" REF="42"/>
him, which they use not in Medicine, not only the Flesh, the Bloud, the Horn, the Teeth, but even his very Dung; they hold there is no better Antidote against Poison, and attribute the same qualities to this, as Ancient Authors do to the Unicorn.</P>
<P>The Ants are exceeding troublesome in most of these places, but especially in the Country of <HI>Bantam.</HI> They are much bigger than in our parts, and so mischie∣vous, that there is no Stuff, but what they spoil, no Victuals but what they con∣sume, if they can get to't; wherefore they ordinarily set the feet of Tables and Cupboards on dishes half filled with wa∣ter, to hinder the Ants from creeping up; and 'twere impossible to preserve any Birds, did not they set them on Poles planted in a dish of Water; for should they put them in a Cage, the Ants would get up and kill 'em. There is besides ano∣ther sort of Ants about the length of a mans finger, and red; but these are one∣ly in the fields, where they live on the Barks of Trees and Herbs.</P>
<P>As concerning the Trees and Fruits in the Isle of <HI>Java,</HI> amongst others there is the <HI>Areca,</HI> the <HI>Portugals</HI> call the Tree that bears it <HI>Arrequero,</HI> the <HI>Arabians,</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="42"/>
<HI>Faufel,</HI> and the <HI>Malayans, Pinang.</HI> It is a kind of <HI>Coco,</HI> but not so great, nor the Leaves so big and broad: the Fruit is like a Date; Nature encloses it in a Husk, which opens not till it flower, and when it ripens the Shell falls off, the fruit re∣maining at the Branch. It hath scarce any Tast, but it moistens the Mouth, dyes the Lips red, and the Teeth black. The <HI>Indians</HI> lap it up in a <HI>Bettele</HI> Leaf, mix a little Chalk or Lime with it, and chew it rather out of Custom than for any Pleasure, though they hold that it strengthens the Stomach and Gums, and is a topical Medicine against the Scurvy; and in effect, there is scarce an <HI>Indian</HI> that is subject to this Disease or troubled with the Tooth-ach. This Drug will make some People so drunk, that all things to 'em seem to run round; but that dizziness is presently over.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mangas</HI> grow on Trees not much unlike our Nut Trees, but they have not so many Leaves: They are of the big∣ness of a Peach, but longer and some∣thing bending like a Crescent of a light green, drawing a little towards the red. It has a great shell, that encloses an Al∣mond of greater length than breadth, and eaten raw is very distastful, but roast∣ed
<PB N="78" REF="43"/>
on the Coals not unpleasant: 'tis use∣ful in Physick against the Worms, and the <HI>Diarrhaea.</HI> It ripens in <HI>October, No∣vember,</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> and being perfectly ripe, 'tis full as good as a Peach. They get them, while they are green, and put 'em up in Salt, Vinegar, and Garlick, and then they call them <HI>Mangas d'acher,</HI> and they serve instead of Olives. There are like∣wise wild ones, which they call <HI>Mangas bravas,</HI> of a pale green too, but brighter than the other, and full of Juice, which is immediate Death without a present An∣tidote.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ananas</HI> is one of the loveliest, pleasantest, and wholesomest Fruits of the <HI>Indies:</HI> it grows on a Bush, and hath Leaves like <HI>Sempervivum;</HI> the Fruit at first is green▪ but being ripe, turns Orange or Aurora coloured, drawing a little to a red, sharp like a Pine-Apple; for which reason, the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> who met with this Fruit first in <HI>Brasil,</HI> called it <HI>Pinas;</HI> but 'tis tender an easie to cut▪ 'Tis yellow within, of a delicate Scent; 'tis eaten in Wine, but the excess is dangerous for Feavers; the Juice is so sharp, that if one wipe not the Knife it is cut with, next Morning it will be found eaten. The Tree is so apt to grow, that a Sprig will
<PB N="79" REF="43"/>
take Root in the Earth, tho it have not past two or three Leaves, be half wither∣ed, and have been cut fifteen days be∣fore. The <HI>Canarins</HI> call this Fruit <HI>Ana∣nasa,</HI> the <HI>Brasilians Nava,</HI> and in <HI>Hispa∣niola,</HI> and the other Western Islands, they call it <HI>Jajana;</HI> 'tis as big as the larger sort of Lemmons, or the middle Melons, excellent both in Scent and Taste. At a distance they look like Artichoaks, on∣ly they are not so picked as the Leaves of that Plant: the Stalk is like that of a Thistle, and every stalk bears but one, and that at the top of it; for tho many times it puts forth at the side other stems, yet the Fruit that comes of 'em is ve∣ry small, and seldom comes to Matu∣rity. They have of them in <HI>March,</HI> and then they are very pleasant, for the Juice hath the Taste of sweet or new Wine, and is exceeding easie of digestion, but it heats and after brings a Fever.</P>
<P>In the Territories of <HI>Bantam</HI> there is another Fruit called <HI>Lamnea;</HI> 'tis as big as a Citron, the Colour green, some∣thing drawing to a red; full of Juice that is tart and Toothsome, and with∣in hath divers black Kernels: the Leaves are like those of Lemmon Trees, but
<PB N="80" REF="44"/>
not so long: they put them up in Salt or Sugar, or use them as <HI>Tamarinds</HI> a∣gainst burning Feavers, Inflammations of the Breast, against pains in the Stomach and Fluxes.</P>
<P><HI>Tamarinds</HI> grow on great Trees full of Branches, whereof the Leaves are not bigger, nor unlike to the Leaves of <HI>Pim∣pernel,</HI> only somewhat longer. The flow∣er at first is like the Peaches, but at last turns white, and puts forth its Fruit at the end of certain strings: assoon as the Sun is set, the Leaves close up the Fruit, to preserve it from the Dew, and open assoon as that Planet eppears again. The Fruit at first is green, but ripening, it be∣comes of a dark gray, drawing towards red, inclosed in husks, brown or tawny, of taste a little bitter, like our Prunelloes. Every husk contains three or four little Beans in a certain skin, which is that the <HI>Portugals</HI> call <HI>Tamarincho.</HI> The Fruit is viscous, and sticks to the Fingers, but of so good a taste, that the <HI>Indlans</HI> use it almost in all Sawces, as we do Verjuice; but 'twould turn a mans Stomach to see them cook meat with this Drug: for squeezing it between their hands, the juice that runs through their fingers looks more like a Medicine than a Sawce. These
<PB N="81" REF="44"/>
Trees bear twice in the Year, and grow every whete without being planted, or otherwise looked after. Physicians use this Drug against burning Feavers, heat of the Liver, and Diseases in the Gall; and infused a Night in cold Water, it purges gently. The <HI>Tamarinds</HI> brought to our Parts, are either Salted or preserv∣ed in Sugar. The Inhabitants of the Isle of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> where there grows plen∣ty of it, call it <HI>Quille,</HI> and the <HI>Bantamites Sundalassa.</HI> The <HI>Portugals</HI> give it the name of <HI>Tamarinches,</HI> for the resemblance the Fruit holds with the Date of <HI>Arabia,</HI> called <HI>Tamar,</HI> as if they would say, Dates of <HI>India.</HI> The <HI>Malabars</HI> call it <HI>Pali,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Indians Ampuli:</HI> the Tree is as big as a Walnut Tree, full of Leaves, bearing its Fruit at the Branches, like the sheath of a Knife, but not so strait, rather bent like a Bow. The <HI>In∣dians</HI> when they would transport their <HI>Tamarinds,</HI> take them out of the Husks, and make them up in Balls as big as a man's Fist, unhandsom to look on, and worse to handle.</P>
<P>Common it is in this Country to plant Pepper near a sort of Canes, by the <HI>Ban∣tamites</HI> called <HI>Mambu,</HI> in which the <HI>Ta∣baxir</HI> is found. 'Tis true, in the Isle of
<PB N="82" REF="45"/>
<HI>Java</HI> these were never any of 'em found; but again, 'tis certain that on the Coast of <HI>Malabar, Coromandel, Bisnagar,</HI> and near to <HI>Malacca,</HI> this sort of Cane pro∣duces a Drug called <HI>Sacar Mambus,</HI> that is Sugar of <HI>Mambus,</HI> The <HI>Arabians, Persians</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> call it <HI>Tabaxir,</HI> which in their Language signifies, a white fro∣zen Liquor. These Canes are as big as the Body of a Poplar, having strait Bran∣ches, and Leaves something longer than the Olive tree. They are divided into divers knots, wherein there is a certain white Matter like Starch, for which the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> give the weight in Silver, for the Use they make of it in Physick, against burning Feavers, and bloudy Fluxes, but especially upon the first approaches of any Disease: and which, according to their Application, is a Soveraign Remedy against the Stone.</P>
<P>These Canes are so big, that the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> cleave them to make Boats, leaving Knots at each end, whereon they sit to guide it, one before, another behind, and use this sort of Boat the rather, for that they are perswaded <HI>Crocodiles</HI> bear a respect to the <HI>Mambu,</HI> and never hurt the Boats made of this Cane.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="45"/>
In the Isle of <HI>Java</HI> there is another Fruit, called amongst the <HI>Malagars Duri∣aon,</HI> not to be seen any where but in this place, and the <HI>Malaccaos.</HI> The Tree that bears 'em, by the <HI>Malagars</HI> called <HI>Batan,</HI> is as big as our Apple-tree, the Bark thick, plentiful of Boughs, and wealthy in fruit: the Blossom, which they call <HI>Bnaa,</HI> is white, inclining to yellow, and the Leaves half a Foot in length, and two or three Fingers broad; on the out-side of a pale Green, drawing towards a Grey, but on the in-side the Green is very de∣licate and lively; the Fruit is as big as a Melon, covered with a thick rough Rind, green, and hath ribs, as the Melons. With∣in 'tis divided into four quarters, which are again divided into two or three lit∣tle Cells, that contain the Fruit, which is as big and white as a Pullets Egg, and of taste so delicious, that the <HI>Bianc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Man∣giares,</HI> which the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> compound of Rice, brawns of Capons, Cream, Su∣gar, and Rose-water, is not more dainty; Each Fruit hath a Stone as big and rough as that of the Peach; ii will not keep; for when the White begins to turn, it must be thrown away and must be eaten as soon as the Husk begins to open. Such as are not used to this Fruit, will not
<PB N="84" REF="46"/>
like it at first, being it hath the smell of a roasted Onion, but the Taste is so plea∣sing, that it may be reckoned amongst the prime, and most excellent Fruits of the <HI>Indies.</HI> One thing it is very remar∣kable for, that there is so great an Anti∣pathy between it and the <HI>Bettele,</HI> that the least number of <HI>Bettele</HI> Leaves laid near a Room full of <HI>Duriaons,</HI> they cor∣rupt and rot immediately. According∣ly, when a Man hath eaten too much of this Fruit, let him but lay two or three <HI>Bettele</HI> Leaves upon his breast, and he shall be eased; and the eating but one of these Leaves after the <HI>Duriaons,</HI> causeth speedy Digestion; so as thus one may eat as much as he will, without the least incon∣venience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lantor</HI>-Tree, which is another sort of <HI>Cocoe</HI>-Tree, as we said before, is frequent in the Isle of <HI>Java;</HI> the Leaves are five or six foot long, and so smooth that the <HI>Bantamites</HI> write upon▪ it with a Bodkin, and use it instead of Pa∣per.</P>
<P>Of all the <HI>Indies</HI> no part bears <HI>Cubebs</HI> but the Country belonging to the King of <HI>Bantam;</HI> the <HI>Bantamites</HI> call it <HI>Cuci∣ombi</HI> and <HI>Cuma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> the other <HI>Indians</HI> call it▪ <HI>Cuba Chini,</HI> because the <HI>Chineses</HI> first
<PB N="85" REF="46"/>
fetch'd it thence, to furnish other Parts, before the <HI>Portugals</HI> or <HI>Hollanders</HI> had any Commerce there. This fruit grows upon another Tree like Pepper, and in Bunches like Grapes. The <HI>Bantamites</HI> knowing it to be no where but with them, esteem it so much as they will not suffer a Plant to go from them, and sell it not unboyl'd, for fear it should be planted elsewhere, tho there is such plenty of it, that at <HI>Bantam</HI> a Weight of fifty six Pounds is worth but six, or at most, seven thousand <HI>Caxaes.</HI> The Use of it is, to fortifie the Stomack, and clease the Breast, but the <HI>Mahometans</HI> take it with a little <HI>Arek,</HI> and are of opi∣nion it restores languishing and spent Na∣ture.</P>
<P>The <HI>Manghostan</HI> is a fruit growing by the High-ways of <HI>Bantam,</HI> upon Bushes, like our Sloes, and much of the same taste.</P>
<P>The Herb the <HI>Bantamites</HI> call <HI>Talassa,</HI> and the <HI>Malagars Lalade.</HI> It bears neither Fruit nor Flower, but is used in Sawces, and some eat it green, and assign it the same Vertues as they do the Cubebs.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="47"/>
In <HI>Java</HI> they have another Fruit, which grows likewise in other places call'd <HI>Jaca,</HI> in form and bigness like a <HI>Citrul,</HI> with a thick and rough Rind; Within 'tis full of certain Nuts, the ker∣nels whereof being roasted on Coals, are good to eat, and stay the flux of the bel∣ly. The Tree is very great, but the Boughs not being strong enough to bear the fruit, it hangs all along the Body of it, up from the very ground: Being full ripe, the Rind grows hard and black, and emits a very sweet scent; the fruit it self chang∣es taste, yielding one while that of the Melon, another that of the Peach, some∣times that of Honey, sometimes that of sweet Lemon; but is so hard of digesti∣on, that 'tis never eaten, but vomited up again. The Nut of it is as big as a Date, and causeth windiness in those that eat it green, but roasted after the manner we told you, they are very plea∣sant, and good for such as have a kindness for Women.</P>
<P>In the same Island, towards the Streight of <HI>Sundy,</HI> grows also abundance of wild Cinnamon, which the <HI>Portugals</HI> call <HI>Canela de Mato,</HI> and <HI>Malayans Ca∣jumanis.</HI> It is not near so good as the fine Cinnamon, whence it comes,
<PB N="87" REF="47"/>
there's but very little of it bought, it being hardly worth the Transporta∣tion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carcapuli</HI> is a Fruit about the big∣ness of a Cherry, and much of the same taste, and the Trees which bear it are like our Cherry-Trees▪ Of these there are se∣veral kinds, whereof some are white, some of a dark red, and some of a lively Car∣nation Colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Costus Indicus,</HI> by the <HI>Malayans</HI> called <HI>Pucho,</HI> by the <HI>Arabians, Cost,</HI> or <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> is the Wood of a Tree resembling the Elder, as well in height, as in Flower and Scent: the <HI>Turks, Persians</HI> and <HI>Ara∣bians,</HI> make an extraordinary Traffick of it, as they likewise do of <HI>Calamus Aro∣maticus,</HI> which also grows on the Coast of the Streight of <HI>Sundy.</HI> That yellow and Spungy Matter which Women use against pains in the <HI>Matrix,</HI> is properly in the Stalk of it. The <HI>Bantamites</HI> give it to their Horses, compounding it with Garlick, Cummin-seed, Salt, Sugar, and Butter, making it into a Paste, which they call <HI>Arata;</HI> and they hold it very so∣vereign for their Beasts, to whom notwith∣standing they never give it, till the ex∣tremity of the Heats be over.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="48"/>
The <HI>Zerumbal,</HI> which the <HI>Bantamites</HI> and <HI>Malayans</HI> call <HI>Canior</HI> too, grows in these parts and is like to Ginger, only the Leaves somewhat more long and broad. They use to dry it, or preserve it in Su∣gar, as they do Ginger, but esteem it a∣bove Ginger.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of <HI>Galanga,</HI> by the <HI>Arabians</HI> called <HI>Calvegian.</HI> The lesser comes from <HI>China,</HI> and is much better than that which is brought out of the Isle of <HI>Javan,</HI> where they call it <HI>Lanquas.</HI> This Herb is neither sowed nor set, but grows naturally, and is about two foot high above the ground. The Flower is white, and the Leaves pointed, and as hard as the point of a Knife. The <HI>Banta∣mites</HI> use it for a Sallad, as also in Phy∣sick, as they do the Root, which is thick and long, and full of knots like a Cane, as biting in taste as Ginger, and of a very sweet scent.</P>
<P><HI>Benjamine</HI> is a Gum distilling from Trees, not unlike Lemon trees. While they are young the <HI>Benjamine</HI> is black, which is the best. But as they grow old the <HI>Benja∣mine</HI> grows white, and loses strength; so as to put it off they mingle it with black. The <HI>Moors</HI> call it <HI>Louan Javii,</HI> that is, <HI>The Incense of Java.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="48"/>
In the Forest of <HI>Java,</HI> Trees there grow of red <HI>Sandale,</HI> but the white and yellow <HI>Sandale,</HI> which is without compa∣rison the better, comes from the Isles of <HI>Timor</HI> and <HI>Salor.</HI> This Tree is of the big∣ness of a Walnut-Tree, and bears a fruit not unlike our Cherries, but 'tis black and insipid. The <HI>Indians</HI> beat white and yellow <HI>Sandale,</HI> and make a Concoction, wherewith they rub their Bodies, not on∣ly for the odour, but for that they believe 'tis restorative. They value not red <HI>San∣dale,</HI> but sell it at cheap rates to other Parts.</P>
<P>They have likewise abundance of Gin∣ger, by the <HI>Malayans</HI> called <HI>Aliaa,</HI> and by the <HI>Bantamites Gauti;</HI> but they either eat it green in Sauces, or preserve it, for they never dry it.</P>
<P><HI>Anacardium</HI> by the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> called <HI>Fava de Malacca,</HI> by reason of its like∣ness to a Bean, is very common here: and the <HI>Bantamites</HI> take it in Milk a∣gainst the <HI>Asthma,</HI> and the Worms. Some pickle 'em as they do Olives; and they are altogether as pleasant as O∣lives.</P>
<P>That Wood the <HI>Portugals</HI> call <HI>Pala de Cuebra,</HI> grows there in great abundance. 'Tis white inclining to yellow, hard and
<PB N="90" REF="49"/>
bitter. The <HI>Indians</HI> bruise, and take it in Wine or Water against burning Fea∣vers and the stinging of Serpents: 'tis said, that for this Cure they are behold∣ing to a Creature in size and shape like our Ferrets, by them called <HI>Quil</HI> or <HI>Quirpela,</HI> which they breed for Recreati∣on, and to catch Rats and Mice. This lit∣tle Beast being a mortal Enemy to Ser∣pents, never meets with any of 'em, but it sets upon 'em, and being bitten runs im∣mediately to this Root, which is his pre∣sent Cure.</P>
<P><HI>Palo d' Aguila,</HI> by Druggists called <HI>Lig∣num Aloes,</HI> by the <HI>Portugueze Palo d' aguila,</HI> and by the <HI>Indians Calamba,</HI> grows in <HI>Java,</HI> but not in such quantity as in <HI>Malacca, Sumatra, Cambaya,</HI> and other places. The Tree is like the Olive tree, only a little bigger. The Wood while green hath no scent, but as it drys its odour increases. The weightiest and brownest is the best: its perfection is known by the Oyl that issues out of it when it is held to the fire. They make Bands of it, and the <HI>Indians</HI> use it to embellish their Cabinets; but the chief∣est use is for Physick, for this Wood bea∣ten to Powder, and taken in Broth or Wine, fortifies the Stomach, stays Vo∣miting,
<PB N="91" REF="49"/>
and Cures the Pleurisie and Bloudy Flux. What the <HI>Portugals</HI> call <HI>Aquila brava,</HI> or wild <HI>Calamba,</HI> is not so good as the others, and the <HI>Indians</HI> chiefly use it at the Funerals of their <HI>Bramins,</HI> making the fire of it that burns the Corps.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bantam</HI> they sell also store of <HI>Lacque,</HI> whereof they make <HI>Spanish</HI> Wax, and the Varnish they lay over so many excellent Works in <HI>China, Japan,</HI> and other pla∣ces: the Territories of <HI>Bantam</HI> produce it, but the best comes from <HI>Pegu,</HI> where 'tis called <HI>Tieck,</HI> and where great and winged Ants get up the Trees, and suck the Gum, which afterwards they lay upon the Boughs as Bees do Honey and Wax. When the Boughs are full, the Owners cut them, setting 'em to dry in the Sun till the <HI>Lacque</HI> falls from the Boughs, then they beat it to powder, and give it what colour and form they please.</P>
<P>The other Druggs gotten in the King of <HI>Bantam</HI>'s Dominions are <HI>Pody,</HI> a mea∣ly kind of substance, which they use a∣gainst Rheum and Wind. <HI>Carumba</HI> or <HI>Floris</HI> a Root whereof they make Saw∣ces, and wherewith they dye their Cot∣ton Cloths. <HI>Conjuapi</HI> a Wood with which
<PB N="92" REF="50"/>
they rub their bodies. <HI>Samperentam</HI> is a root found near <HI>Sundy,</HI> stronger than Ginger, and very bitter. <HI>Pontiou</HI> they hold good against Feavers, but 'tis exceeding dear. <HI>Gatogamber</HI> is a fruit like an Olive, good against the Tooth-ach. <HI>Ganti,</HI> a Root so like Ginger, that the <HI>Bantamites</HI> have given it the same name, but 'tis dearer; and with it they rub their Bodies. <HI>Sa∣sum</HI> is Mustard-seed. <HI>Doringi</HI> a Drug they give Children as soon as they come into the World. <HI>Galan,</HI> a root grow∣ing in the water, and very refreshing. <HI>Madian, Maya,</HI> and <HI>Corassini,</HI> are intoxi∣cating Drugs they mix in their Drinks. <HI>Rhodium</HI> the ashes of a Tree growing near <HI>Sundy,</HI> wherewith they scour their Bodies, as they do with <HI>Sary,</HI> which is a flower, The <HI>Turgary, Sarahan,</HI> and <HI>Se∣dowaya</HI> are Roots for the same use. <HI>Sam∣baya</HI> is the fruit, the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Gui∣duar,</HI> as big as an Acorn, of high price, by reason 'tis not ordinary, and is a so∣vereign remedy against Poison, and the biting of Venemous Beasts. <HI>Jalave</HI> is like <HI>Sambaya,</HI> and of the same use in Medi∣cine. <HI>Paravas</HI> is a very cooling Herb, but very scarce and very dear. <HI>Tomonpate</HI> a Root like <HI>Galican,</HI> used against Inflam∣mations of the Spleen. The <HI>Condu∣ri,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="50"/>
which the <HI>Bantamites</HI> call <HI>Saga,</HI> are red Beerries spotted with black, where∣with they weigh Gold and Silver, but are not to be eaten they are so bitter, and as some say poysonous. There is like∣wise <HI>Azebar,</HI> the <HI>Sycomore,</HI> the <HI>Nux In∣dica,</HI> and divers other Trees, Plants and Druggs, to <HI>Europeans</HI> some unknown; but 'twould require a peculiar Treatife to name 'em all, and would fill a large Volume to describe their good and bad qualities.</P>

<P>AMong the Creatures, which we said the Land of <HI>Bantam</HI> abounds withal, we mentioned Apes; and it is observable, that where there are a great number of these Animals, there are very few Crows; for assoon as they have built their Nests, and laid their Eggs, the Apes get upon the Trees, and throw their Eggs to the ground: I do not know whether it be to see, if they can fly or no. As I was one day travelling along the Road in a Coach, attended with a
<PB N="94" REF="51"/>
great many, we saw a vast number of Monkeys Males and Females, and many of the Females holding young ones in their Arms: Having a desire to shoot at one, I took a Harquebuss, and kill'd a Female Monkey, who lay stretched out upon the Boughs, letting her little one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all to the ground. But immediately all the Monkeys that were upon the Trees, to the number of sixty, came down in a great fury to have leap'd into our Coach, where they would soon have strangled us, had we not prevented them by clo∣sing the Shutters; and had we not had a great number of Men, who with much ado kept them off; yet they pursued our Coach above a League, and were stout lusty Monkeys. In several parts of this Country there are particular Hospitals for these Creatures. On the ways there are commonly Copses of <HI>Bamboos</HI> grow∣ing very high; some of these are so thick, that it is impossible for a Man to get into 'em; but they are pestered with prodigious numbers of Apes. Those that breed in the Copses upon one side of the way, are enemies to them that are bred on the other side; so that they dare not cross from one side to the other, but they are in danger of being immediate∣ly
<PB N="95" REF="51"/>
strangled. Here the Travellers have good sport by setting the Apes together by the ears, which is done after this man∣ner; In several parts of the Road there is Rice to be sold, and they that would see the sport, cause five or six Baskets of Rice to be set in the Road, some for∣ty or fifty paces the one from the other, and close by every Basket they lay five or six Botoons about two foot long, and two inches about; then they retire and hide themselves: presently they shall see the Apes on both sides of the way, descend from the tops of the <HI>Bamboos,</HI> and advance towards the Baskets which are full of Rice; They are about half an hour shewing their Teeth at one ano∣ther, before they come near the Baskets; sometimes they advance, then retreat a∣gain, being Ioath to encounter. At length the Female Baboons, who are more eager and couragious than the Males, especially they that have young ones, which they carry in their Arms as Women do their Children, venture to approach the Bas∣kets; and as they are about to put in their hands to eat, the Males on the o∣ther side advance to hinder 'em. Im∣mediately the other Party comes for∣ward, and thus the feud being kindled
<PB N="96" REF="52"/>
on both sides, they take up the Battoons, that lie by the Baskets, and thrash one a∣nother in good earnest. The weakest are constrained to fly into the Woods with their Pates broken, and their Limbs maimed, while the Masters of the Field glut themselves with Rice, and the joys of Victory, tho it may be when their Bellies are full, they will suffer some of the Female Party to come along with 'em.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Elephants,</HI> I happened to see two that were lately taken. Each of them was placed between two Tame ones. Round about the wild Elephants stood six Men, with every one a Half Pike in their Hands, and a lighted Torch fastened at the end of a Pike; who talkt to the Beasts, giving them Meat, and crying out in their Language, <HI>Take, eat it.</HI> The food which they gave 'em was a little Bottle of Hay, some pieces of brown Sugar, and Rice boiled in Wa∣ter, with some few Corns of Pepper. If the wild Elephants refused to do as they were bidden, the Men made Signs to the Tame Elephant to beat 'em, which they did, banging the Refractory Ele∣phant upon the Head and Forehead with their Trunks; and if he offered to make
<PB N="97" REF="52"/>
any stir or resistance, the other Elephant thwack'd him most unmercifully on the other side; so that the poor <HI>Elephant</HI> not knowing what to do, was constrained to learn obedience.</P>
<P>Being thus fallen into the Story of <HI>Elephants,</HI> I will add some other Ob∣servations, which I have made upon the nature of these Creatures. Though the <HI>Elephant</HI> never meddles with the Female after he is once taken, yet he is sometimes seized with a kind of lustful Rage. One day that the King was Hunting upon an <HI>Elephant,</HI> with one of his Sons that sate by him to fan him, the <HI>Elephant</HI> became so furious by reason of his Lust, that the <HI>Governour</HI> who was by no means able to master or rule him, declared to the King, that to allay the fury of the <HI>Elephant▪</HI> who would doubtless bruise him to pie∣ces among the Trees, there was no way but for one of the three to forfeit his Life, and that he would willingly sacri∣fice his for the safety of the King, and the Prince his Son; only he desir'd His Majesty to take care of the three small Children which he must leave behind him. Having so said, he threw himself under the <HI>Elephants</HI> Feet, who had no sooner taken him in his Trunk, and
<PB N="98" REF="53"/>
squeez'd him to pieces with his feet, but he grew quiet and peaceable as before. The King as an acknowledgment of so signal a deliverance, gave to the poor Widow 200000 <HI>Roopies,</HI> and highly advanc'd every one of his Sons, that had so generously laid down his life for the safety of the Father of his Country.</P>
<P>I observed also, that tho the <HI>Elephants</HI> skin be very hard whilst he is alive, yet when he is dead the skin is just like melt∣ed Glew.</P>
<P>There are several Parks that are em∣paled with nothing but <HI>Elephants</HI> Teeth, the least of which Parks is above a League about. In some places they Hunt the <HI>Elephants,</HI> and eat the Flesh; but they are obliged to give the Tushes of every one they kill to the Lord of the place. When they intend to take their <HI>Ele∣phants,</HI> they make a long Lane clos'd in on both sides, so as the <HI>Elephant</HI> can run neither to the right nor to the left. This Lane is broad at the first, but grows narrower and narrower, till there is no more Room left at the further end, than for the Female <HI>Elephant</HI> to lie down, which must be one that is desirous of the Male at the same time. Tho she be tame, yet she is bound with good Ropes and
<PB N="99" REF="53"/>
Cords, and by her Cries will call the Male, who presently runs through the Lane towards her. Now when the <HI>Elephant</HI> comes where the Lane grows narrow, they that lie hid for that purpose, imme∣diately barricado up the Lane behind; and when he comes near the Female, then is another barricado set up, that stops him from going any further. When he is thus between the Barricadoes, they so entangle his Legs and Trunk with Ropes and Cords, that he is soon taken, hav∣ing no way to help himself. The same way they use for the most part in the Kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> and <HI>Pegu;</HI> onely that the Natives there mount the Female <HI>Elephant,</HI> and go to find out the Male in the Forests; and when they have met with his haunt, they tie the Female to the most convenient place they can find, and then they fix their Snares for the <HI>Ele∣phant,</HI> who in a short time hastens to∣wards the Female hot for generation, where her Cries call him.</P>
<P>This is observable of the Female, that when she begins to be hot, she gathers together a great heap of Herbs and Weeds, and makes her self a kind of Bed some four or five foot high from the ground, where contrary to the Custom
<PB N="100" REF="54"/>
of all other Creatures she lies upon her back in expectation of the Male, whom she calls to her by a peculiar Cry.</P>
<P>This is furthermore particular to the <HI>Elephant</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> that only the first, which the Female brings forth has Tushes. And it is also observable, that the Ivory which comes from <HI>Achem,</HI> when it is wrought has this peculiar quality with it, that it never grows yellow, like that which comes out of the Continent, and from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> which makes it more esteemed and dearer than any other.</P>
<P>When the Merchants bring <HI>Elephants</HI> to any place to sell, 'tis a pleasant sight to see 'em go along; for in regard there are generally old and young together, when the old ones are gone by, the Chil∣dren will be running after the little ones to play with 'em, and give 'em some∣thing or other to eat. While the young <HI>Elephants</HI> (which are very wanton) are busily taking what is offered them, the Children leap upon their Back; but then the young Elephants, that lately stopt for the lucre of Victuals, perceiving their D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms a great way before 'em, double their pace, and playing with their Trunks,
<PB N="101" REF="54"/>
throw the Children off their backs to the ground, and that without doing 'em any harm.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all the Inquiry I have made, I could never find exactly how long the <HI>Elephant</HI> will live; nor can all the Governours and Keepers of those Creatures tell you more, than that such an Elephant has been in the possession of their Father, Grandfather, and Great Grandfather: and by that computation I have found, that they have liv'd some of 'em six score, or an Hundred and Thirty Years.</P>
<P>The <HI>Javians</HI> making their benefit of the <HI>Portugals</HI> Ingratitude to the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes, who entertained 'em, did perti∣naciously oppose the establishment of any strangers in the Isle. But the profit the Kings of <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Jacatra</HI> receive by vending their Spices to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> was so considerable, that at last they consented, that the People of those two Nations should build a House for such Factors, as they should have occasi∣on to leave there, and for stowing up the Commodities they traffiqu'd in. The <HI>Dutch</HI> by Treaty with those Kings, regulated the Customs of Importation and Exportation; but those Articles
<PB N="102" REF="55"/>
were so ill kept by the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings, who raised their Rates according as they dis∣covered the strangers necessity of Com∣merce; that the <HI>Dutch</HI> to avoid this In∣justice, and secure 'emselves from the vio∣lence of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> by degrees se∣cretly fortified their Quarters at <HI>Jaca∣tra,</HI> and in a short time made it defen∣sible. The <HI>Indians</HI> perceived it not, till 'twas past their hopes of forcing it; so as in this despair of driving out the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they made use of the bad Cor∣respondence between the <HI>English</HI> and them, which chiefly appeared in a Sea∣fight they had near <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Jacatra, June</HI> 2. 1619. the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet being put to Flight by the <HI>English.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> being forced to retreat, the King of <HI>Ja∣catra</HI> with the <HI>English</HI> Forces, besieged the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fort, now called <HI>Batavia,</HI> which Siege lasted six Moneths, till the <HI>Holland</HI> Admiral having reinforced his Fleet with the Ships that lay in the <HI>Mo∣lucques,</HI> constrained the <HI>English</HI> to raise the Sieg, to embarque their Guns, and quit the Streight of <HI>Sundy,</HI> to get into the main Sea. The King of <HI>Jacatra</HI> would have cast the blame of all these distur∣bances upon the <HI>English,</HI> but the <HI>Dutch</HI> General would not be satisfied with such
<PB N="103" REF="55"/>
excuses, but landing his Forces, to the number of Eleven Hundred Men, he assaulted the Town of <HI>Jacatra,</HI> which he took by force, and having put all to the Sword, fir'd it. That done, the <HI>Dutch</HI> compleated the Fortification of their Quarters, and brought it to a regu∣lar form, with four Bastions of Free-stone, well Trench'd and Pallizado'd, with Half Moons, Redoubts, and other necessary works. The King of <HI>Matram,</HI> who is (as it were) Emperour of <HI>Java,</HI> in the Year 1628. besieged this Fort, and lying under the Canon storm'd it several times; but in the end was forc'd to raise the Siege, as he in like manner was the Year following; and since that time the <HI>Dutch</HI> have established their Commerce joyntly with the <HI>Chineses, Siameses, Succadans,</HI> and other Neighbours, taking Ten in the Hundred Custom upon all Com∣modities, whether imported or exported thence.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Batavia</HI> is twelve Leagues from <HI>Bantam,</HI> Eastward in a Bay, which being sheltered with some small Islands on the Sea-side, is one of the best Roads in all the <HI>Indies.</HI> Strangers that inha∣bit there pay a certain Tax by the Moneth, according to the profits they
<PB N="104" REF="56"/>
make, which is great; for a Porter who will with ease get two Royals a day, pays but one and a half in a Moneth; a Fruiterer four Royals, a Fisherman three Royals, Distillers of <HI>Arach</HI> eight Roy∣als; Mechanicks, as Shoomakers, Tay∣lors, and the like, so as at present 'tis the most important place and firm esta∣blishment the <HI>Dutch</HI> have throughout the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Shortly after my return from <HI>Bantam</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> I was drawn out amongst others to be sent to <HI>Siam,</HI> where we arri∣ved safely. That Kingdom extends not onely in the <HI>Peninsula,</HI> beyond the <HI>Ganges</HI> as far as <HI>Cape sin Capare;</HI> but it likewise comprehends the Kingdom of <HI>Martaban,</HI> which is upon the Gulph of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and that of <HI>Cambaia,</HI> upon the Gulph of <HI>Siam;</HI> it is situated in the most Eastern part of all the <HI>Indies,</HI> and con∣tains abut 360 Leagues from the <HI>South</HI> to the <HI>North,</HI> and about 200 in its great∣est extent from East to West above the <HI>Peninsula.</HI></P>
<P>It may be divided into four or five principal parts; that which is above the <HI>Peninsula,</HI> in the midst of the others, is particularly the Kingdom of <HI>Siam.</HI> On its West is that of <HI>Martaban,</HI> on the East
<PB N="105" REF="56"/>
<HI>Cambaya,</HI> and <HI>Maluca</HI> on the South▪ This Island formerly contained several Kingdoms, that are at present reduced into Provinces, the Princes whereof are Subjects and Tributaries of the King of <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>Very pleasant and fruitful is this Country, being watered with several great Rivers, the principal of which is called <HI>Menan,</HI> which after having Bathed <HI>Prom, Travai,</HI> and <HI>Brema,</HI> Cities of <HI>Ava</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> enters into that of <HI>Siam,</HI> passing thorough <HI>India</HI> the Capital thereof. This River is so deep, that it can carry Ships of four Hundred Tun, and which take Twelve or Thirteen Foot Water; and it might bear those that draw as much more, were it not that at its mouth there is a Rock, which fills the bottom near which you are to pass, and hinders great∣er Vessels from coming in. Its breadth near the City, and for two Leagues be∣yond it, is two Bow-shoot, which renders the unlading of Commodities so much the more easie. Every where else its Banks are a good Musquet shot distance one from another. From the City to thirty Leagues beyond it 'tis all along be∣set with Gardens, Burroughs, Villages, Monasteries, and other very fine glori∣ous
<PB N="106" REF="57"/>
Buildings, the sight of which is in∣finitely charming. And what exalts their beauty, is that instead of Moun∣tains, we see nothing in all that Coun∣try which is plain and even, but Tow∣ers and Pyramids, which have something very singular both for Art and Mate∣rials.</P>
<P>Eight Leagues from the City stands another called <HI>Bancock,</HI> where all man∣ner of Ships, of what Nation soever they be, are obliged to stop to declare from whence they come, whither they go, what is their <HI>Cargo?</HI> and how ma∣ny Men they have on Board? after which they pay the Customs, for which the Toll-man gives an Acquittance, which they are obliged to shew to ano∣ther little City, called <HI>Canon Bantenau,</HI> which is but a League from <HI>India;</HI> and in case it be without deceit, they are permitted to go whither they please, and to trade freely through all the King∣doms, without being obliged to pay any other Customs than those of going out, which every Ship is to pay upon pain of Confiscation. As for <HI>India,</HI> which, as I have said, is the Capital of the King∣dom, 'tis without contradiction, one of the finest things that can be seen. Its
<PB N="107" REF="57"/>
Ramparts are about three fathoms in height, with Bastions of all sorts, for there are both solid, plain and cut. Ad∣mirable are its Buildings, but especially the Temples, the Monasteries, and gilt Towers, are there of an unexpressible Richness and Ornament. The River <HI>Menan</HI> does there run into eight parts, which after having formed two Islands, discharges it self into the Gulph of <HI>Si∣am.</HI> The Kings Palace is of so vast an extent, that one would take it for a Ci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. It has its separate Ramparts, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Towers which environ it are in such great numbers, so high built, that no∣thing is more magnificent; and the in∣side is answerable to the outside. I know by those who have travell'd <HI>China,</HI> that in no other Country is any thing so perfect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be seen.</P>
<P>The Air is very temperate, considering its being so near the Line, (for it is but fifteen degrees distant) perhaps by rea∣son of the narrowness of the Country, which is refreshed by Winds. The Soil is fat, and very fruitful in Rice, Barley, and Fruits. They gather there a great quantity of Pepper, Benjamin, Musk and Aloes. There are Mines of Gold, Silver, Copper, Pewter, and other Metals. It
<PB N="108" REF="58"/>
breeds a great number of <HI>Elephants</HI> and Horses. There are great Forests towards <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> which serve for retreats to Tygers, Lions, Leopards, and other ra∣venous Beasts, and for Venison; but the number of Red and Fallow Deer is in∣credible, since that there is carried eve∣ry Year to <HI>Japan,</HI> above Three Hundred Thousand Skins of those Creatures, wherein the Company have a good share. Oxen, Cows, Hares, Hogs, wild Boars, Buffeloes, and Rabbets are there without number. Birds there are of a Thousand several <HI>Species,</HI> and even of all sorts, except the Swan and Nightingale, which have never bin seen there. The Country▪ wants not Fish, but above all they make a great Trade of the Skins of Thornback, the most part of which are sold in <HI>Japan,</HI> where they are worth fif∣ty, sixty, and some an Hundred Ducats a piece. I have seen one sold for an Hundred Crowns; and that was no ex∣traordinary rate, yet they would not give five Pence for one that has the least de∣fect. There is a great number of Cro∣codiles, which the Inhabitants do hap∣pily make use of for the Curing many evils.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="58"/>
The Natives are all Idolaters, and ex∣treamly superstitious. They have many Temples inhabited by Monks, who are had in great Veneration.</P>
<P>This Country was always governed by a King or an Emperour, to whom His Subjects pay a kind of Adoration. He reckons Princes among His Subjects; His Dominions are so vast and so exten∣ded, that he is esteemed one of the most powerful Monarchs in the World, which we shall see more at large in the follow∣ing Section.</P>

<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> tho vast, yet is Populous, proportionably to its greatness. The Natives are good∣natur'd, witty and industrious. All the Artificers are very dexterous; and tho they be of all sorts, most part of 'em however are either Fishermen or Hus∣bandmen, because very few but have their Lands in Property, or certain Pla∣ces of Rivers and other Waters, where
<PB N="110" REF="59"/>
they have Right of Fishing, which suffi∣ces them for their subsistence. For Ava∣rice and Ambition are no Vices of this Country; the Abundance being so great, that mostly the day-labouring People have but three Pence a day for their nou∣rishment and pains, on which they live very handsomly, and have besides some∣thing to lay up. The Merchants are all rich, because perhaps they know the end and art of Trade, wherein few Nations excel them.</P>
<P>In each City is a Sovereign Court, whose President, that is Triennial, being assisted with his Counsellours, sits as Judge in all Causes both Civil and Cri∣minal. But they do not judge there in the last Appeal, and none but the great Council, which resides in the <HI>Metropolis,</HI> have that priviledge. The Proceedings there are much shorter, and less subject to Corruption, than in <HI>Europe.</HI> They do justice without distinction, and who∣soever finds himself attainted and con∣victed of Larceny, of Murder, &amp;c. no favour can hinder him from being pu∣nished, according to the enormity of the Crime.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="59"/>
There is no Court more <HI>superb</HI> than that of this Emperour. He never goes on foot, no, not in his own Palace, where he causes himself to be carried from one place to another in a Chair of Massie Gold. The greatest Lords of the Em∣pire, who are obliged to follow him at all hours, and at all times, however ne∣ver see him more than once a day; and that too with so much Pomp and Splen∣dour, that he dazles all those who look on him. When one of these great Men is desirous to speak to him, he approaches him with his Knees upon the ground, his Hands joyned, his Head bowed down, and begins and ends his Speech with these words, <HI>Javva Fiauw Perre Bonde, Tiauw Javva;</HI> which signifies, <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> His Throne, which is of Massie Gold, and all best with Precious Stones, is raised very high from the ground; he mounts it by se∣veral steps of the same Metal, but 'tis a Crime to see him mount it, and every step at both ends supports an <HI>Animal</HI> of different kind, and of fine Gold. When he goes out of His Palace, whether out of Devotion▪ or for Pleasure, which hap∣pens two or three times in the Year, he is attended by the greatest Princes of His
<PB N="112" REF="60"/>
Empire, by His Wives and Concubines, who are in great numbers all very rich∣ly clothed, by Land upon <HI>Elephants,</HI> and by Water in Barges all guilt without and within. From the Palace to the place where the Emperour goes, the Life-Guard stands in a row on each side, all well apparelled and mounted to advantage; principally the chief Officers, who are upon <HI>Elephants,</HI> whose Houses are of Gold and Silver. All along the way nothing is to be heard but Fifes, Drums, Flutes, and other Instruments, which make a passable Harmony. And assoon as the Emperour appears, every one upon pain of Death is obliged to come out before him, prostrate 'emselves, and adore him: wherein they are so rigorous, that if one waits never so little to acquit himself of this <HI>Devoir,</HI> he is punished at that instant, which I have seen with my own eyes. This Custom is quite contrary to what is practised in <HI>Peru;</HI> for in all places where the King goes with his Wives and Con∣cubines, the People must shut their Doors and Windows, and remain as in Prison until all is gone by. Those who hap∣pen to be in the Emperours way, are ob∣liged to dislodge, and make way for His Attendants; which often occasions
<PB N="113" REF="60"/>
people to die of Hunger and Cold; es∣pecially when the Order comes by night, those who give it being so punctual, or rather so hard-hearted, as they force o∣bedience, without giving the People time to provide themselves with Clothes and Food. A hard extremity in all parti∣culars, since besides the inconveniency which they receive from this surprize, they have likewise the displeasure of lea∣ving their Houses to be plundered.</P>
<P>Gold is so common in this Court, that their Cattle are served in Vessels of no other Metal. The <HI>Elephants,</HI> and espe∣cially the White Ones, are there treated like Princes; and of this last sort there is always one in so great Veneration, that they attribute to his presence the Prospe∣rity of the Empire. Those Creatures have in all times served for a pretext to Wars of long continuance betwixt the Neighbouring Kings; for besides, that they are rarely of that colour, they reve∣rence 'em in memory of <HI>Xaca,</HI> whose Mother being with Child of him, once dream't, that a <HI>White Elephant</HI> came out of her mouth, and at another time out of her left side.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="61"/>
It was upon the account of these Ani∣mals, that in the Year 1548, the Kings of <HI>Ava</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> made a League against the Emperour of <HI>Siam,</HI> in whose Terri∣tories they had made a great Progress, before he was in a condition to resist 'em. At length with the Aid of His Generals He got in the Head of two Hundred Thousand Men, with whom he went to encamp within Half a League of His Enemies. Those who thought to have surprized him, seeing so strong a Barri∣er opposed to their Design, made shew of preparing 'emselves for a Battel; but whether their Forces were unequal, or they began to abate in their good intelli∣gence among 'emselves, three Moneths passed without making any attempt; at the end of which those Kings seeing their Armies perish for want of Victuals, aban∣doned the ground, and left by that means the Emperour of <HI>Siam</HI> the peace∣able possessour of the two <HI>White Ele∣phants,</HI> which they pretended to seize on. What at first delayed his March, was, that he had neither Souldiers nor Ships to go to the place, where he was to joyn the Enemy; and he caused above Twen∣ty Thousand Vessels to be built, which required some time. Besides the two
<PB N="115" REF="61"/>
Hundred Thousand Men which he brought with him, he left upon the Fron∣tiers Fifty Thousand Citizens, who were obliged to guard 'em at their own costs. Some were amazed, he did not take ad∣vantage of His Enemies weakness; but he said, <HI>That he had gained more by de∣stroying them after that manner, than if he had constrained 'em to end the quarrel by a Battel, the issue whereof was uncertain.</HI> He pretended to have conquered 'em more cunningly, and more happily for His Sub∣jects, whose Lives and Estates he preserv∣ed, without costing 'em one drop of bloud. So that he was received in Tri∣umph in His <HI>Metropolis,</HI> as if he had made the greatest Conquests. After the death of the King, if he has left no Male Infant, or his Son has not attained the Age of 15 Years, this Son loses His Right to the Crown, to which the eldest Brother of the deceased becomes the Legitimate Suc∣cessor. And as for the Offices possessed by the Grandees of the Court, they are all Hereditary, at least if he who enjoys 'em does not oblige the Prince to declare his Heir uncapable of succeeding him.</P>

<P>THE great number of Strangers, who trade at <HI>Siam,</HI> help much to in∣crease the Treasures of the King; there is continually a coming in and going out of His Kingdom, a prodigious quan∣tity of Merchandizes, on which there are considerable Imposts. His Mines of Gold, Lead and Pewter, do contribute very much thereunto; as likewise great Forests of as fine wood of <HI>Japan</HI> as that of <HI>Brasile.</HI> The Trade of this Wood lies along the Coasts of <HI>Coromandel, Dabul' China, Japan,</HI> and all the Neighbouring Islands. Add to this, that all His Sub∣jects being His Slaves, He inherits all their Estates, or at least two Thirds, leav∣ing out of favour, the other Third to the Relations of the Defunct. A Custom so advantageous, as this Prince extends it even to Strangers, whose Heir he is, as well as those that are born in His Country; and as there is ever an incredible multi∣tude of 'em, 'tis certain, His Finances are thereby much augmented.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="62"/>
The greatest Expence of this Prince is the great number of Pagods, Con∣vents, Hospitals and Towers, which he causes incessantly to be built, and what it costs him in raising 'em, does surpass the <HI>Idea</HI> People have conceived there∣of. After having applied Himself to what concerns Religion, he takes care His Arsenals be largely provided with all that is requisite for War: and indeed all things there are in a surprising a∣bundance, and so neatly kept, that it would be very difficult to imitate them therein.</P>
<P>As for His Forces, they consist almost all in Infantry, which is very good; the Pay of the Souldiers is but a little Rice; the rest they have occasion for, they are to gain it from the Enemy, or by labouring very hard at any kind of Work, for they are treated as Slaves, and they give a blind Obedience to whatsoever they are com∣manded.</P>
<P>As for the Citizens, their condition is little better than that of the Souldiers; for, besides the Subsidies with which they are excessively oppressed, and that they have nothing in Propriety: they are obliged to work on the Fortificati∣ons, and to work as well as the Souldiers
<PB N="118" REF="63"/>
in occasions of necessity. Notwithstand∣ing this, they are so supple, and so tra∣ctable, that they are never heard to complain or murmur: tho the Govern∣ment is severe, they live contented and happy, because they desire nothing. From that soft and tractable Humour, they ea∣sily proceed to Devotion, which is as na∣tural to 'em; and whether they are little addicted to Riches, whereof they have only the use, and not the Proper∣ty, or they think 'em unworthy of their Affection, they employ 'em almost all in Alms, which they bestow upon the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the Priests of the Coun∣try, and in building Pagods and Con∣vents, to which they annex so many Revenues, as no Monks live more at their ease, nor know better, how to take ad∣vantage of the useful Ignorance and Su∣perstition of the People, than the Monks of that Country. The great esteem the People have for 'em, causes 'em to mul∣tiply more than can be imagined; these Priests affect a fine out-side, and a mo∣desty which savours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of nothing less than of Ambition. But this appearance is very deceitful, for under pretences of maintaining the Glory of their Gods, to whom they boast they are much
<PB N="119" REF="63"/>
dearer than their Lives, they only think of advancing themselves, insomuch that there has been those found, who have made secret Cabals for the de∣throning the King, for to Reign in His place.</P>
<P>These good People are clothed in yel∣low, and every New Moon they have their Heads, Beards and Eye brows sha∣ved. They neither wear Gold nor Sil∣ver, and dare not so much as touch it, but they receive and dispence it by a <HI>Procurator,</HI> that is to say, by the Hands of a Man of an approved Fidelity, and who Honours the Secrets of the Order, but pretends to see nothing. They make a Vow of Chastity, and seem to keep it very rigorously; but they see Women in private, and provided there results no scandal from that Commerce, they make little scruple on't▪ but if it comes to light, the Criminal is punished very se∣verely. Bating this, they lead a very de∣licious life, exempt from all care; for as they want nothing, and they have not so much as the care of heaping up Riches, which shower down upon 'em, without spending their thoughts in that way, they have nothing more to do than to study, how to entertain their Vota∣ries
<PB N="120" REF="64"/>
in the good intention they have of nourishing 'em in a Heavenly Idleness. Their Rule obliges 'em to preach to the People every Quarter of the Moon, to Ca∣techise at all times, and to induce 'em to Peace. The great Modesty which they affect in their Pious Exercises, does in∣vite to their Houses all the People, who in acknowledgment of the spiritual Be∣nefits which the Monks communicate to 'em, bestow upon 'em such as are tem∣poral, and that even to profusion. A∣bout four a clock in the Morning, they rise at the ringing of the Bells, and go all together to a certain place appointed for Prayer; part of the day is spent in visit∣ing the sick; in the Evening they return to Prayers, where they remember the dead, for they believe that their Pray∣ers contribute very much towards their comfort and ease, and for the freeing 'em from an imaginary Place, where (they say) they endure great Pains.</P>
<P>They have an infinite number of Idols, who represent several postures of Men and Women, most being of Gold or Sil∣ver, some of Copper and Pewter, and very few of Stone or Wood. In the great Pagod, where the King goes once a year, there is one, who tho seated with
<PB N="121" REF="64"/>
Legs across, is about sixty foot high; the others are much richer, but not so great. Those of the Altars are much the finest, but their Beauty is not in the least to be compared with the Idols of the Pagod, which is in the midst of the City; where of four Thousand which it contains, there is not one but what is either of Gold or Gilt. As for their Ceremonies, they are in many things conformable to those of the <HI>Papists,</HI> who its easie to prove, have suck'd most of their Superstition from <HI>Paganism;</HI> for at the Entrance of their Pagods, there is Holy Water; and without speaking of their Altars, that are loaded with Ima∣ges or Idols, there are Lamps always burning, a number of other Lights, and every where Boxes to receive the Alms of Pilgrims. The Works of <HI>Supererogation</HI> are in great Credit amongst 'em; and if we would believe 'em, there is not a dead Person, but whom their Prayers are a great help to, nor any living, but to whom they are considerably useful. Tho the <HI>Indians,</HI> especially the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> have commonly a blind aversion to those who are of a contrary Religion to theirs, these People seem very moderate in that respect, and far from being passi∣onate.

<P>NOthing is wanting in that King∣dom of things necessary for the Structure of all sorts of Buildings, espe∣cially it abounds in very fine Stones, and yet the Houses there are only of Wood:
<PB N="123" REF="65"/>
the reason of it is, that the Stones are reserved for the building both the <HI>Pagods</HI> and <HI>Pyramids,</HI> whereof there is a prodi∣gious number through all the Country, Stools, Chairs and Tables are of no use there, and the <HI>Siamites</HI> as well as all the other <HI>Orientals,</HI> sit in all occasions, only upon Mats or Carpets. All their Move∣ables, which consist in some Utensils of the Kitchin, are of Brass, always very bright and very neat; their Houses are so clean and neat, that they far exceed <HI>Holland</HI> in that; and as for their Per∣sons, they wash their Bodies three times a day from Head to Foot, in the clearest Fountain water that can be found; then they rub 'emselves with a Perfume com∣posed of Sandal Wood, Aloes, Amber∣greece, Rose-Water, Musk, and such like things, whose Odour is very agreeable; wherein they take a much better course than the <HI>Javans,</HI> who perfume 'emselves with a Drug that is insupportable to those that are nice in the least. Com∣monly it is forthwith after those Bath∣ings, that they make their Visits and their Devotions, but they first deck 'em∣selves with all their fineries; those of the Men consisting in a number of Gold-Rings, and a long Vest of Cotton-stuff,
<PB N="124" REF="66"/>
upon which they have a Sash of several colours, and under, a very loose shirt of Linnen or Cotton, which is sometimes red, sometimes white, or of another co∣lour. The Sleeves of their Vests are very large, most of 'em open about the Elbow, and hanging to the Knees, but they go almost bare-headed, and without shooes.</P>
<P>The Women make a round of their Hair, which they fasten behind their Head with a Bodkin. Their Pendants are of blades of Gold, of a Fingers length, which are inchased with some Jewels; those blades are so massie, that the weight of them makes holes in their Ears big enough to put a Thumb through. Their Bracelets are likewise of Gold and Preci∣ous Stones, and they have very fine Dia∣monds upon their Fingers. As for their Habits, they are of Cotton, as well as those of the Men, and made much after the same manner; except that they have upon their Bosoms a Veil of Linnen or Silk, the colour of which is Arbitrary, and the form something resembles the Scarfs Women wear in <HI>England.</HI> The Complexion of both Sexes is Tawny; they are Tall of Stature, but well set, and of a Free Carriage, and general∣ly
<PB N="125" REF="66"/>
the People there are good natur'd and polite.</P>
<P>Tho the young Men and Maids see one another with liberty enough, and it is no Scandal for the latter to grant sometimes Favours, they live in Marriage with so much reservedness, that there is no Na∣tion where the Women have more: Not that they are all perhaps so many <HI>Lu∣cretiaes,</HI> but as Adultery is there severe∣ly punished, the fear of Punishment is capable of rendring 'em discreet. More∣over, the Mothers forbid their Daugh∣ters when they are young, too great a Commerce with Men, for fear <HI>of getting an ill Habit;</HI> or perhaps too, for fear that the Men should not be so eager to court 'em by way of Marriage. This Circum∣stance makes the Maids, who have a de∣sire to be Married, of difficult access; and the more they conceal 'emselves, the more do their Lovers crowd after 'em. The means to obtain 'em is, to address ones self to the Parents, who, without consulting their Daughters Inclinations, grant her to the Man, who pleases 'em most, provided he be of the Kindred; for it is the Custom of the <HI>Siamites,</HI> to ally 'emselves only in their own Family, where all Alliance is permitted, except
<PB N="126" REF="67"/>
between Brother and Sister; nay, and these may Marry together, in case they be but Half-Brothers and Half-Sisters; that is to say, of the same Father, and not of the same Mother. Thus Intrigues of Gallantry are of no use in that Coun∣try, and such an one Marries, who has never seen the Person she is to wed. As Interest reigns there as well as else∣where, they make Alliances commonly in consideration of Estate and Fortune; and when the Match is advantageous, for fear of a disappointment, the Maids are Married at Nine years, and the Young Men at Twelve; insomuch as the married Couple do not both make five and twen∣ty years, when they find 'emselves alrea∣dy Fathers and Mothers. Out of Marriage the Men are permitted to have as many Concubines as they can maintain, and in Marriage, if they have but one Wife, they are free to quit her upon slight pre∣texts, especially when they have no Children, and then either the one or the other may Marry again when they please.</P>
<P>Tho the Priests are very much reve∣renced in that Country, yet there is no respect had to 'em in Marriage, and far from calling 'em to be Witnesses of the
<PB N="127" REF="67"/>
Union, they are on the contrary avoided, and People take it for an ill <HI>Omen,</HI> that they should be present at such a time. He who performs the Ceremony of it, is one of the nearest Relations, who in the heat of the Feast, makes an Exhortation, after his mode, to the new married Cou∣ple: and whether the Bride and Bride∣groom live together until death, or they part, the Clauses of the Contract of Mar∣riage are religiously observed.</P>
<P>As to the Children, they are brought up with great gentleness, and yet they are very supple, and do punctually, without any need of using rigour, all that is exacted from them. 'Tis usually the Priests, who take care of their Education; and as this sort of People live happily, their Disciples observing it, turn Priests as well as they, for to enjoy the same pleasures.</P>
<P>Their Custom in regard of the Dead, is to burn them, and to make their Fu∣nerals conformably to their Means, which is performed in the manner following; The Relations of the Defunct raise up a Tomb, which they fill with sweet scented Wood, which serves to burn the Corps, and whereto the Priests set fire, after having said Prayers. The
<PB N="128" REF="68"/>
Rich preserve the Ashes in Urns of Gold or Silver, or bury 'em under a Pyramid, or in a Pagod, which the Deceased has caused to be built; for there is not a rich <HI>Siamite,</HI> but who is at that expence to eternize his Memory. The Ashes of the Poor are cast into the Wind. Those who die naked of all, through an excess of Charity, that is to say, for having spent what they had of Value in building Mo∣nasteries or <HI>Pagods,</HI> those I say, are burnt at the expence of the Priests and Monks, who have profited thereby, for which reason the Pomp is very small. As for Criminals and Children, who end their Lives, those by a Criminal, these by an untimely death, their bodies are not burnt, but they inter 'em, it not being reasonable, that they who have lived without honour, or died before they attained to the Knowledge of Re∣ligion and the Gods, should enjoy the Honours and Priviledges of the Coun∣try.</P>
<P>The Civility of the <HI>Siamites</HI> extends even to Strangers, and of what Nation soever a Man be, he is favourably re∣ceived there. What contributes to this good Reception is, that the more Stran∣gers there be there, the more are the Na∣tives
<PB N="129" REF="68"/>
of the Country esteemed by the Neighbouring States; for which Rea∣son, it is forbidden to trouble them in any kind, whether in the course of their Trade, or Customs, or in the exercise of their Religion. True it is however, that there are some who are priviledged; and of all those who frequent there, none are so well received as the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to whom the King has been particularly kind, as well in their Trade as Imposts; and even contrary to his Custom, which is to see no Foreigners, he gives 'em Ac∣cess in His Palaces, and calls 'em, <HI>His Children.</HI></P>

<P>THose sensible Marks of the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Goodness towards our Na∣tion, have raised us Enemies who have endeavoured to destroy us; but far from attaining to their ends: their Hatred has only served to make us take Precauti∣ons, which have confirmed us in the Favour and good Opinion of that Prince. Since we have had the Honour of having
<PB N="130" REF="69"/>
Access into His Palace, he has heaped up∣on us new kindnesses; and that which he did in permitting us to assist at the Funerals of his only Daughter, is cer∣tainly one of the greatest that Strangers can receive. This Princess being deceas∣ed at my first arrival there, six Moneths afterwards the King sent word to the <HI>Sieur van Muyden</HI> Principal Commissio∣ner of the Company, that he had leave given him to be present at the Obsequi∣es. <HI>Van Muyden</HI> received with all due respect the Honour the King did him: and thus, with some others, of which number I was, he was Spectatour of a Ceremony which merited well to be seen.</P>
<P>Preparations were made for that Pomp in one of the Courts of that Palace, where there were raised five Towers of Wood; whereof that in the midst was about an Hundred and twenty Foot in Height, the others diminishing by the same degrees they stood at a distance from that. Those Towers were painted and gilt, and had communication by Galleries, with Bal∣listers enriched with the same Ornaments. Before the highest of those Towers, the Body of the Defunct, was reposed upon an Altar, all covered with Gold and pre∣cious
<PB N="131" REF="69"/>
Stones; she was standing, her Hands joyned, her Face turn'd towards Heaven, in a Coffin of Gold an inch thick. Her Robe had a long Train, and was all beset with Jewels; her Crown, her Neck∣lace, and her Bracelets likewise, all over covered with Diamonds, were of an in∣estimable price. When every one had taken places upon Scaffolds made on purpose, all the <HI>Grandees</HI> of the Kingdom went to make their Bows to her. The Ladies came thither afterwards, and both Sexes were only apparell'd with a white Cloth, without any Attire or Ornament; each one scattering round the Body and the Altar Flowers and Perfumes, with a very sad Countenance. After which, the Body was carried twenty paces from thence in a Chariot, the riches whereof equalled that of the Altar. The Poten∣tates of the Kingdom, and the Ladies, having paid her the same Honours, they all wept bitterly, and after so mournful a manner▪ that it seemed as if they had lost what they had dearest in the world. These Tears and Lamentations having lasted for half an hour, the Principal Officers of the Crown drew the Chari∣ot very gently towards the place where the Funeral Pile was. It was attended
<PB N="132" REF="70"/>
by the same Lords and Ladies we hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> already mentioned, still weeping and la∣menting. Before 'em marched the Eld∣est Son of the King, only Brother of the deceased Princess, and both born of the same Mother: He was clothed in white▪ as well as the Lords who attended him▪ and was mounted on an <HI>Elephant</HI> whos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hoose was embroidered, with Chains o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gold upon his Neck. On each side o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him went his two Brothers, born of o∣ther Women, upon <HI>Elephants,</HI> like th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first, each holding a long Skarf of white Silk, whereof one of the ends was fasten∣ed to the Coffin. Round the Bed, walk∣ed fourteen of the Kings Sons on foot, clothed also in white, with a branch of a Tree in their Hands, all so well in∣structed in weeping, that there was not one in the Company but did it with a good grace. At half way from the Fu∣neral Pile, there were Stages or Scaffolds, where the Lords of lesser Quality than the former, expected the Convoy. When the Body was come up over a∣gainst them, some cast several sorts of Habits to the People; others, Oranges full of Ficols, which makes half a Crown of our Money: and some certain pieces
<PB N="133" REF="70"/>
called <HI>Masen,</HI> which are about our Crown in value.</P>
<P>The Convoy being arrived at the place where the Ceremony was to end, the <HI>Grandees</HI> of the Kingdom took the Body with great Respect, and laid it up∣on the Funeral Pile, several Instruments in the mean while sounding, whose mournful Harmony, attended with the Tears and Lamentations of all the Court, was capable of staggering the hardest Hearts. This sad Consort being ended, they covered the Body with <HI>Sandal</HI> and <HI>Agor</HI> Wood; and after having cast there∣in a great quantity of Perfumes, the King and Lords Children returned to the Palace, leaving the Ladies with the Corps, which was not to be burnt till two days afterwards. Tho this Term appointed for Tears, seem'd long to Persons wea∣ry with weeping, they were notwith∣standing forced to continue that sad Ex∣ercise for the space of two whole days, without any ones being permitted, of what Quality soever she was, to exempt her self a Quarter of an Hour: a severe Custom upon my word, but necessary to all that have Ambition, Tears on that occasion, being the surest and short∣est means of rendring ones self recom∣mendable.
<PB N="134" REF="71"/>
Tho a Persons Honour i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerned to shew a deep mourning and a profound silence, there were how∣ever some, on whom those Conside∣rations had so little effect, that they grew weary of weeping; and it was for those weak Souls, that they had left Old Women among them, to re∣vive 'em with Lashes of a Whip, made in the form of those sorts of Disci∣plines, which the Monks make use of in <HI>Europe;</HI> and if it happened that those poor Ladies left off weeping for one moment, because they were oppressed with weariness and sleep, they lashed 'em in such a manner, that instead of feigned Tears, they obliged 'em to shed real ones.</P>
<P>Whilst the Ladies were weeping round the deceased Princess, the Priests were upon Scaffolds in the Court where the first Tears were shed, praying Night and day for her Soul: And while the Body was exposed there, they interrup∣ted their Prayers often, for to cast to the People Garments of all sorts, Utensils for House-keeping, Instruments for Artificers, Beds, Mats, and other Moveables. On the side of the Court, there were Twenty other Towers made
<PB N="135" REF="71"/>
of Reeds, faced within and without with Paper of several Colours: those Towers were filled with numbers of Fire-Works, which lasted fifteen days together: during which, the King caus∣ed great Alms to be given, both to the Poor, and the Priests, the Expence whereof was [the Preparations being comprehended therein] of Five Thou∣sand <HI>Calfi,</HI> which makes of our Money about Sixty Thousand Pounds, beside the Statues of Gold and Silver, amongst which, there were two of Gold, of four Foot and a half high, and an inch and a half thick, which were put, for the Honour of the Deceased, in the finest <HI>Pagods</HI> of the Country; all made of Gold Silver and Jewels, which the Deceased had received during her life, as well from the King her Father, as from the Principal Lords of the Court.</P>

<P>THE Body having reposed two days upon the sweet sented Wood, which serv'd to burn it, all the Court went to relieve the doleful Ladies, whom their Fatigue had rendred very lean. The Ceremony began with Prayers and Speeches, which the Priests made; and when they had done 'em, the King took a lighted Wax-Candle from the Hands of the Arch-Priest, and set fire himself to the Funeral Pile, where the Body was reduced to Ashes in the Coffin of Gold, wherein they had left the Riches, where∣with it was adorned. When they thought the Body consumed, and went to gather up the Ashes for the putting 'em into an Urn of Gold, there was found a piece of flesh of the bigness of a little Child, so fine, and so Vermilion-like, that it seemed at first, as if the Fire had spared it out of respect; but that thought was followed by another, which occasioned the shedding of a great deal of bloud. The King, who was one of those who gather∣ed
<PB N="137" REF="72"/>
up the Ashes, looking upon that piece of flesh, <HI>What do ye think</HI> (said he, to the Lords who were present) <HI>is it out of respect, the fire has spared what remains of the body of my Daughter?</HI> The King waiting their answer, one amongst 'em said, <HI>That His Majesty had too much un∣derstanding to doubt what he saw. How!</HI> (replied the King all in a fury) <HI>I have but too much reason not to doubt any longer of a suspicion I have had a hundred times, my Daughter was poisoned.</HI> In finishing those words he gave order they should secure all the Women who had serv'd the Defunct, and that not one should be ex∣cepted.</P>
<P>The days following, new suspicions were formed, upon which a number of innocent People were imprisoned: for what tortures soever they made them suffer, there was not one but disavowed the Crime. In the mean while the Kings fury daily augmented; all those that were accused made appear, they were not culpable: but the Cruelties did not di∣minish; and when the Court was drei∣ned, and the King no longer found any one upon whom to discharge his Anger, he sent upon divers pretexts, for the greatest Men of the Kingdom, and their
<PB N="138" REF="73"/>
Wives, whom he caused to be put in Prison as soon as they arrived at Court. When he had 'em in his power, he caused several holes to be digged round the Ci∣ty, about twenty Foot square, wherein great Fires were kindled, guarded by Souldiers, who took care to hinder 'em from going out. And thither he sent the Prisoners, loaded with Chains, to the end he might draw from 'em by force what Threatnings and Promises had not been able to make 'em confess. When they were at the place of Punishment, it was begun with making 'em enter into a Tub of hot water for to soften their skin, and render it more susceptible of the im∣pression of the Fire. After which they scra∣ped the Soles of their Feet with Irons as sharp as Knives; then carried 'em before Judges, who examined 'em concerning the pretended business of poysoning; those who continued obstinate to deny that they were culpable of it, were for∣ced to walk bare footed upon burning Coals; and if it was found afterwards that the Fire had penetrated 'em, it was a convicting proof, they were guilty of the fact whereof they had bin accused. An Errour which in all times has been entertained among the <HI>Pagans,</HI> who
<PB N="139" REF="73"/>
made use of Fire for the trying of Cri∣minals; Witness the <HI>Roman Vestals,</HI> who only proved their Chastity by grasping a burning Iron, without burning 'em∣selves. As for the <HI>Siamites</HI> we speak of, they whom the heat of the Fire cau∣sed to fall into a Swoun, and who had not Strength enough to get out of 'em∣selves, perished there miferably, no body daring to to help 'em, for fear of running the same danger. Those who escaped it, were tyed to a Post, from whence an <HI>Elephant</HI> instructed in that manner of Death, tore 'em with his Trunk, cast 'em into the Air, from whence they fell again upon his Teeth, and after several Tosses he trod 'em under Foot, and made their Guts come out, which were afterwards cast into the River. Besides this hard punishment, there was one, that was no less to be feared, which was to be Interred all alive unto the Chin, upon the High-way of the City, with obliga∣tion to Passengers to spit upon 'em, and prohibition to give 'em ease in any man∣ner, and even to advance their Deaths, which was the favour those miserable Wretches demanded with most Arden∣cy.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="74"/>
Amongst other Punishments, there was this very remarkable, and which is also very frequently executed upon notori∣ous Malefactors. The Criminal is bound so streight about with a Napkin, that a Man may grasp him with his Hands, and then is pricked with Engines as sharp as Needles; not only make the bloud gush out, but force the Patient to hold in his breath. Which taking the opportunity of on a sudden, they cut him through the middle, and clapping immediately the upper part of his body upon a flam∣ing hot piece of Brass, through the cau∣terization of which, he remains a consi∣derable time alive, in far greater torments than can be imagined.</P>
<P>These cruel Executions lasted for a∣bove four Moneths, during which, they took the Lives away of an incredible Multitude. One day in less than four or five Hours, I my self saw above fifty put to death. People imagined, that would have been the last day of the Massacres, because some Moneths passed afterwards without putting any body to death; but they were quickly disabused. As the Nobility, that were terrified, began to take Heart and return to Court, the Executions were renewed, and so ma∣ny
<PB N="141" REF="74"/>
Heads fell at length, that the flower of the most Apparent, whom the King thought ill intentioned to His Person and Children, perished upon the Pretext of having had a Hand in this Sham-busi∣ness of Poysoning, or of having been privy to it. To have seen those Cruel∣ties, and so visible an Injustice, it was much to be wondered there was no Ri∣sing, and indeed, there has been such for less considerable Reasons: but the King had provided against that, by keep∣ing on foot a great number of Forces, with which he had filled his best Towns, in appearance, for to send 'em against the <HI>Chinezes,</HI> but indeed to bridle those whom he distrusted, while he made sure of the others. And further, His Hatred did only extend to the Great Men, whose Fall the People did joy∣fully see, by reason of their Insolence, and the ill Treatments they received from 'em.</P>
<P>On the 28 of <HI>February,</HI> they carried three Hundred Persons, who had served the Defunct Lady to go thro the Fire: but whether it was only a Fire of Straw, or painted, it is said to have spared those three Hundred Domesticks, who by those means were absolved and released: some
<PB N="142" REF="75"/>
days after one of the deceased Kings Daughters was impeached; she was one of the youngest of his Children, who was suspected of the Crime then in Ex∣amination, because it had been observed, that she laughed when all the others wept at the Obsequies of the Princess. They were fortified in this Suspicion by the Remembrance of the frequent com∣plaints she had made of the King, by reason he had not Consideration enough for her, and His Slights were the cause, that she was no longer treated as a Kings Daughter, wherein she was in no wise inferiour to His other Children who were the Delight and Admiration of the Court.</P>
<P><HI>Tho these Conjectures were but Half Proofs, yet they were made use of for the bringing her to a Tryal; or rather, she was condemned contrary to all forms of Justice; for, without hearing her rea∣sons, they caused her to pass thro the Fire, with almost all her Attendants: but, as they had only a design upon her, a Rumour was spread abroad, that it had hurt no body but her; wherefore they loaded her with Chains of Gold in an obscure place, with prohibition, to whom∣soever it was, to see and speak with</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="75"/>
<HI>her. Nothing was now expected but the Hour of that Princesses Death, when People learn'd, that the King being mov∣ed with Compassion, desired nothing more than to save her, provided she could justifie her self of the Crime, that was imputed unto her in the Presence of His Counsel. On the day of her Ap∣pearance, instead of being terrified at the Torments that were preparing for her, <HI>My Lords,</HI> said she, looking scornfully up∣on her Judges,</HI> All in Chains as you see me, I am of the Bloud, which you adore in the Person of the King, and which you have adored in the Person of my Father. 'Tis of the same value; 'tis the same in my Veins that it is in his; and yet the same Bloud is treated in me, as if I was a vile Slave, at the same time that Incense is pay∣ed to it elsewhere, and they render the same Honour as to the Bloud of the Gods. From whence comes this difference, My Lords? Is it, that the Bloud which animates me is corrupted? But whence should that Corruption <NOTE PLACE="marg">Infamous Di∣seases among the <HI>Siamites,</HI> and for woh they are ig∣nominiously trea∣ted.</NOTE>proceed? Thanks to the Gods, I have neither a Fe∣ver nor the Pox; and tho there had been something impure in me, the Fire I have been made to
<PB N="144" REF="76"/>
pass through must needs have purged it: but I am said to have taken away my Cousins Life, and by that Action I have degenera∣ted from the Dignity of my Ancestors. I do not examine the Effects of the Crime, whereof I am accused, nor if our Actions deface in us a Character, which Nature bath imprinted there; but let us see if it be just to condemn me without hearing me; the greatest <HI>Barbarians</HI> take another course, and the worst of Crimes are punished among Them according to the Laws. However, they make a scruple of treating me as all the World is treated; I do not deserve the least regard should be had for me, and upon the least appearances, I must be condemned to undergo the severest Punishments. But I laughed, <HI>said they,</HI> instead of weeping at the Obsequies of my Cousin, I have com∣plain'd of the Kings slights, How! When were the most innocent Actions ever condem∣ned? Is it so culpable a thing to laugh when we are young, and not yet at an Age to dis∣semble? And for some small Complaints which were none of the worst grounded, have I merited either Fire or Sword, and ought they to prophane in me the Bloud of a Prince, who never sought Pretexts to pro∣phane Yours, under whose Reign this Empire has so long flourished, and under
<PB N="145" REF="76"/>
whom it would still perhaps have flou∣rished, if certain secret Enemies had not snatch'd the Scepter from him by an Acti∣on that is commended in them, because they have had the Happiness of trium∣phing without Opposition, and which is basely punished in me because I am weak, and all the Authority is in the hands of my Antagonist. Thus you see, <HI>My Lords,</HI> the Injustice of this Procedure; but after the manner I speak thereof, you may very well judge I have no desire to be spared; and indeed, <HI>My Lords,</HI> I hate Life, and since the Affront that has been put upon me, I only wish for Death; not that I am troubled with the Remorses of my Conscience, but because I blush to live in so sordid an Age, and I have no Body to help me to repulse the Blows of a Tyrant, who cannot endure the sad Reliques of your Kings, Go, <HI>My Lords,</HI> and tell him my Resolution, and endeavour to re∣present it to him after such a manner as may terrifie him in case my Death be in the least deferred: This is the only favour I demand of you.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="77"/>
The Princesses boldness did stagger Peoples Minds, and if the King had not foreseen it by the raising of the Forces we have before mentioned, 'tis certain, that there would have bin some Revolt; but the fear of the approaching Danger stifl'd the grief of the Judges: they made their report of what they had heard, and the King dissembling the Vexation he had to see himself braved after that man∣ner, pretended to have some pity, and made her appear before him with an Air, as gave occasion to believe, he had a desire to save her. <Q>Well, said he, to her, at her coming into his Presence, I hear that Life is grown a burden to you, and it would be in vain for us to endeavourto save it; but from whence proceeds that great Aversion to it? Is it not from the Remorse of having poysoned my Daughter, or from some other yet more violent? for I do not believe you of a humour to confine your self to one Crime: but as wicked as you are, I have no desire to see your Ruine, which it lies only in your Pow∣er to try, which you may easily do by confessing your Crimes, and your Ac∣complices.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="77"/>
<Q>Do not think, Sir, (replied the Prin∣cess boldly) I am terrified with Me∣naces, or your false kindness is capable of surprising me. I am in a conditi∣on to speak to you sincerely; you have lost a Daughter, and you will needs have me to be the cause of her loss: Yes, yes, let it be so, I confess, it was I, who poysoned her, but I likewise a∣vow, that this Crime is not so great as you make it, or rather that that Victim was too vile to be sacrificed to my just resentment. 'Tis well known, that it was by your Plots, the Scepter of my Ancestors fell into your Hands; and by your Order, we are in the dust: could I do less than take Vengeance for so considerable a loss, and for a Treatment so unworthy the Bloud of so many Kings? Wherefore I have sought to comfort my self in the death of my Enemies; but I have so ill per∣formed it, that I think my self unwor∣thy of the Light; and it is for having failed of depriving you of it, that I can no longer endure living. As for my Accomplices, I confess with the same sincerity, I have had none of those whom you have so cruelly murdered. But why should I tell you what you know,
<PB N="148" REF="78"/>
and what no body is ignorant of? No body is ignorant, that you, hated 'em long since, you dreaded 'em, and have a long time sought for a pretext to get rid of 'em; you have found that happy moment, you triumph, you are belo∣ved by Heaven, enjoy in repose the favours which it heaps upon you; and if you have still any humanity left, finish what you have begun; for I must confess, I am weary of breathing the same Air that is sucked by the Executi∣oner of my bloud, and the basest of all Tyrants.</Q></P>
<P>The King used great violence upon himself to suffer her speak so long, but at length, affecting to appear what he was not, that is to say, good natur'd and humane; after having asked her if she had nothing more to say, the Prin∣cess making no answer, he caused a piece of her flesh to be cut off, which he commanded her to eat; <HI>Content thy self</HI> (said she to him) <HI>with being my Exe∣cutioner; thou mayst tear my body to pieces, but thou hast no Power over my Will.</HI> She was going to continue, when the Kings Choler augmenting, she was cut to pieces as she finished these words, and cast into the River.</P>

Of the Family of the deceased King there remained no more than two Chil∣dren, <HI>viz.</HI> one Son of twenty years old, and a Daughter who had not yet seen ten. Her extream Youth saved her life, but the Son lost it the same day, and after the same manner as his Sister did. What torments soever he was made to suffer, he protested, his Sister and he were inno∣cent of the Crimes that were imposed upon 'em; and he was not very sorry to die, Life being insupportable to him, since he saw himself fallen from the State that he was born to; but he had a regret that the Tyrant survived him.</P>

<P>WE have already said, that the King of <HI>Siam</HI> is one of the rich∣est and more powerful Monarchs of the East; but we have not yet seen the Ti∣tles which he gives himself. As the man∣ner thereof is singular, I imagine the Rea∣der would take it as an obligation to be shewn two Copies, which fell into my Hands while I was at <HI>Siam,</HI> thro the
<PB N="150" REF="79"/>
intermission of one of the Great Lords of the Country, to whom I testified my desire, that he would leave them with me. As the Phrase of that Tongue is some∣thing barbarous, I have caused them to be Translated according to the <HI>genius</HI> of ours.</P>
<P><Q>Alliance written in Letters of Gold, wherein shines the Divine Splendour, and which is the most excellent of all those that are in the World; which comprehends the Sublimest Sciences, and which is alone capable of rendering Men happy. It is the best and surest in Heaven, and above and below the Earth. All the Words thereof are Royal; they are soft and delicious, but Almighty and Energical. The Renown that is spread thereof thorow all the Earth, pro∣duces there the same effect, which the sighs of the Dead raised to life would produce, when done by an all-Divine Vertue, and purged from their corrup∣tion, as well spiritual as corporal. All Persons too, constituted in Dignity, as well amongst the Nobility and Cler∣gy as the Commonalty, do never see 'em without feeling a certain joy which no other thing can cause. Thus there is nothing in the Universe which is
<PB N="151" REF="79"/>
comparable to 'em, no more than to the Source from whence they issue, as being a Monarch most Illustrious, most Invincible, most Powerful, and most High, and Crowned with an Hundred and one Crowns of Gold, all adorned with nine sorts of Precious Stones: be∣ing the greatest, the purest, and the most Divine Master of Immortal Souls, the most Holy who sees all things, and the Sovereign Emperour, who holds under the shadow of his Wings, the Great, the Rich, and the most incomparable King∣dom of <HI>Siam;</HI> the Splendour of the fine and famous City of <HI>India,</HI> whose Gates and Passages are inhabited by an infinity of People, and which is, without Contradiction, the Capital of the Universe, the only Throne wor∣thy of the greatest of Kings, to which is subdued the goodliest and the most fruitful of all Countries, which the Sun gives light to; who is a greater Lord than the Gods, and whose Pa∣lace is only of fine Gold and Precious Stones: the divine Master of the Heaps of Gold, of the White, Red, and round Tail <HI>Elephants,</HI> which three Animals are the Sovereign God of Nine sorts of Gods: the Divine Lord, in whose hand
<PB N="152" REF="80"/>
is the Victorious Sword, who resem∣bles the God of Armies, with Arms all of Fire, and the most Noble and most Ex∣cellent of all Kings.</Q></P>
<P>The Second was much of the same force, and is as follows: <Q>The most High <HI>Paducco Dyrisultaan nelmonam, Welgahu, Nelmochadin magiviitha, Jou∣hen der Eateten lillaula fulan,</HI> the King of Kings, who causes the Waters to ebb and flow, the Monarch who is as a God, as a Sun in the highest point of its Elevation, as bright as the Moon in its greatest Lustre, the Elect of God for to be esteemed as much as the Star of the North, whose Extraction is alto∣gether Royal, as being the Issue of the Great <HI>Alexander,</HI> and whose Wit is all-perfect, all-seeing, and all-penetra∣ting; like to a Globe, always rowling, and so made, as to measure the Abysses of the Sea: a King who has adorned the Tombs of all the decayed Saints; who is as just as God; and of so vast a power, that all the World may hide it self under the Shadow of his Wings: a King who holds from the Hand of God a number of Mines of Gold; who has caused <HI>Pagods</HI> all of Gold and Cop∣per
<PB N="153" REF="80"/>
to be built; who sets upon a Throne that is only of Gold and precious Stones: the King of the <HI>White Elephant,</HI> who is King of all the other <HI>Elephants,</HI> and before whom, several Millions of other <HI>Elephants</HI> are obliged to prostrate them∣selves: a King whose Eyes are so spark∣ling as the Morning Star: under whom are <HI>Elephants</HI> with four Teeth; red <HI>Elephants,</HI> purple coloured <HI>Elephants,</HI> and of several other colours; as like∣wise, of an <HI>Elephant Buytenaque,</HI> for which the Almighty God has made him a Present of several sorts of em∣broidered Houses, in great numbers, and all beset with Precious Stones; a number of other <HI>Elephants</HI> exercised in War, whose Harnaces are Shot proof; others whose Teeth are armed with Steel, and their Harnace of Brass: a King who has Horses without number, shod with Iron, whose Houses are likewise of Gold, and all beset with Stones, be∣sides an infinite number of others, which are proper for War. A King who is above all the Emperours, Mo∣narchs, Princes and Potentates of the Universe, from East to West; who raises to Honour and to Dignities, those who have the Wit to get into his good
<PB N="154" REF="81"/>
Opinion, and who on the contrary causes those to be burnt alive who re∣volt from him: A King as powerful as God, and in whom resides the power of doing all that God has done and created.</Q></P>
<P>By these proud Titles the King of <HI>Si∣am</HI> pretends to insinuate into His Sub∣jects that he is as great as God, and more than all the Powers which reign upon Earth; and to confirm it, he makes 'em believe, that he stops the Course of the Waters, which he goes to work to af∣ter this manner: The River of <HI>Siam</HI> be∣ing one of the Branches of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> which Increases and Decreases regularly in certain Seasons of the Year: its In∣crease and Decrease is likewise limited. When it begins to diminish, which hap∣pens in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> the King takes that time to make one of his pub∣lick Appearances, whereof we have spo∣ken: to which, he is attended by all his Court, and shews himself on that Oc∣casion, with all the Riches and Splendour imaginable. His Galley is all shining with Gold and Precious Stones; he is therein seated upon a Golden Throne, covered with a Canopy set with Dia∣monds; he is attended by two Hun∣dred
<PB N="155" REF="81"/>
Galleys of a prodigious length, each having two Hundred Rowers, and being for the most part, painted and gilt. About six Leagues from the City, the King and Arch-Priest enter alone into a little Barge; wherein the latter, after having uttered some Prayers upon a <HI>Sabre</HI> of Gold, presents it to the King, who strikes the River three times with it, and commands it, by His Divine Au∣thority, to retire into the Sea. While the King is employed in this Ceremony, the People, whom the Priests do make believe that none but His Majesty can stop the Course, are prostrated upon the Shore, surprized at the Power of their King.</P>

<P>ON the twelfth of <HI>April</HI> we depart∣ed from <HI>Siam,</HI> in a Ship freighted with Buck-skins, <HI>Sandale</HI> Wood, and <HI>Amrac,</HI> whereof the <HI>Japanezes</HI> make the finest Varnish; and we made Sail towards <HI>Formosa.</HI> In the way near a Shelf called <HI>Pracel</HI> we discovered a <HI>Jone</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="82"/>
with an <HI>Holland</HI> Flag, which seemed to come directly to us; the more it ap∣proached, the more did we believe, it was a Pyrate: wherefore for fear of a surprize, and to be so much the more free in case he attaqued us, we were contriving how to cast some Merchan∣dizes into the Sea, when we perceived, it was a Merchant-man. Being delivered from our fears, we called to 'em to come shew us their Passport, but they excused 'emselves, in that their <HI>Jonc</HI> was in so ill a condition, that it sprung Leaks on all sides. We armed Seven or Eight of our Men, and put 'em into a Pinnace to go on board of 'em. All the Men on board the <HI>Jonc</HI> were <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Gambodians;</HI> they had <HI>Sandale</HI> Wood, <HI>Amrac,</HI> and Buck-skins as well as we; but they were moreover freighted with counterband Goods, and had no Pasport, for which reason we seized upon 'em. Having got all they had on board of us, while the <HI>Jonc</HI> was repairing, we caused the <HI>Gambodians</HI> and the <HI>Chineses</HI> to re∣turn into it, who were exposed to the Sea without Sails, Masts and Rudder, that we might be revenged of the Massacre which the latter had executed a little be∣fore upon some <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="82"/>
On the tenth of <HI>May</HI> being arrived at <HI>Formosa,</HI> we cast Anchor before the Fort called <HI>Zelandoia,</HI> from whence presently after, we saw a <HI>Jonc</HI> strike so hard upon a Rock, that both it, the Goods, and Men were all cast away.</P>
<P>This Island is situated under the <HI>Tro∣pick of Cancer,</HI> at 21 degrees of Southern Latitude, and ending towards the 25<HI>th.</HI> of Northern; its Circuit is 130 Leagues. It abounds in Fish of all sorts, but a∣bove all they catch a sort called <HI>Har∣der,</HI> of the bigness of a <HI>Whiting,</HI> which being salted and prepared like <HI>Stock fish,</HI> is distributed thorow all <HI>China,</HI> as <HI>Her∣rings</HI> are in <HI>Europe.</HI> They salt appart the Eggs of that Fish, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> make a very savoury Dish of. That Nati∣on paid formerly to the <HI>Dutch East India</HI> Company a certain Impost for the fishing of this Fish, but that Right does no longer subsist.</P>
<P>Its Soil is very fruitful, but the Inha∣bitants (who are lasie) do not make the best advantage on't. It produces Rice, Wheat, Barley, Millet, Ginger, Cinamon, Coco's, Lemons, Oranges, Melons, Gourds, and all sorts of Pulse, <HI>Majavinades, Gui∣gavas, Cadiany, Potates;</HI> and the <HI>Focu∣focoes,</HI> which is a Fruit of the form and
<PB N="158" REF="83"/>
bigness of a <HI>Bon Chrestien</HI> Pear. This Fruit is of a Purple colour, and lies up∣on the ground as Melons do, and is of a most excellent taste. There are likewise some Sheep, but not so many as Deer, Goats, Hares, Rabbets, Pidgeons, Fal∣low Deer, wild Goats, wild Boars, Ty∣gers, Bears and Monkeys; besides a cer∣tain Animal, called by the <HI>Hollanders, the Devil of Fayovan;</HI> it is about three quarters of a yard in length, and about twenty Inches large; it has Scales like a Fish, and very sharp Claws. It only feeds upon Pismires, who go of themselves upon its Tongue, when Hunger presses it to put it out. This Creature is very timorous, and especially of Mankind: if it can only shun one by hiding it self in the Earth, it makes a hole there∣in with so much ardour, that in a mo∣ment it retrenches it self as in a Fort; or if it be surprised in such a manner, as that it has not time to get in, it wraps its self up in its Scales, and takes the form of a Ball. Those who have named it <HI>Devil,</HI> must needs not have known it, or they were frighted with its Figure; for tho you hurt it never so much, it will rather suffer it self to be killed than make any Defence. There are no Parrots, but
<PB N="159" REF="83"/>
many other sorts of Birds, and an infinity of flying Locusts that are very dangerous and troublesome.</P>
<P>The Men are of a low stature, particu∣larly those who inhabit the Mountains; neither are the Women of a larger size, most of whom have broad Faces, great Eyes, flat Noses, and full bosomed; and what they have most singular is, that they have Beards grow upon their Chins as well as Men; and were they not very diligent in pulling it out, they would be much better furnished. Add to this beauty very long Ears, which they take great care to lengthen and augment by the weight of certain great Shells, which serve 'em instead of Pen∣dants. This Ornament seems to 'em so rare, that the more Solemn the Feasts are, and of the greater quality the Peo∣ple they see, the more they lengthen their Ears, which reach, on those occasions, down to their very Breasts, by the coun∣ter weights which they put in 'em. Their Hair is both very black and long; some wear it much after the same manner as they do in <HI>Holland;</HI> others tye it up af∣ter the <HI>Chineze</HI> manner, or make it into several Tresses, which they fasten round behind their Heads with a Tin Bodkin.
<PB N="160" REF="84"/>
Their Necklaces are of Glass or Stone, and of little pieces of Silver in several Figures. Their Complexion is yellow and black, and some towards <HI>Kubeland</HI> are yellow and white. The Women of <HI>Miday,</HI> whose King is Master of the greatest part of the Isle of <HI>Souten, Norwe</HI> and <HI>Lamei,</HI> are altogether yel∣low. As for the Gifts of Mind, all the Inhabitants in general are pretty well furnished.</P>
<P>The Women are cloathed from the Neck to the Middle with a piece of Cot∣ton, which flys about negligently; and from the Middle to the Knees with ano∣ther piece of Cotton. Their Head-geer is of some Silk stuff, or most commonly of Velvet, whereof they make two points, which advance on either side the Fore∣head: They go always bare-footed, and are almost ever followed by an Hog, who is as familiar to them as the Dog is in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Habits of the Men consist in se∣veral Ells of Cotton, whereof one part falls from the right Shoulder to the mid∣leg, the two ends crossing over the left Arms, insomuch as half of the Body is always uncovered. They go common∣ly bare-footed, except in a long Tract
<PB N="161" REF="84"/>
of way, when they have sometimes cer∣tain Shooes made of Goats Skin, and much like the Sandales of our Monks. In Winter they dress 'emselves in Beasts Skins, as Tygers, Bears, and Leopards. Those of the Province of <HI>Soulang</HI> dressed 'emselves formerly after the Mode of the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> At this day it is after that of <HI>China,</HI> as well as in all the rest of the Island, where all the Inhabitants went naked, before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> set foot there, which is still at this day observed by those who in∣habit the Mountains; except that they cover grosly, what Civility forbids to name.</P>
<P>The Men paint their Breasts, Backs, and Arms, with a juyce of Herbs, which is ne∣ver worn out: they have Bracelets of Glass and Necklaces of the same, and they have such streight Sleeves of Iron upon their Arms, that they can hardly move 'em; as for their Legs, they deck 'em with rows of white Shells very neat∣ly wrought.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Tocadeol</HI> take for a Sumptuous Ornament (for they only deck themselves with it on Holy-days) a long Reed or Cane of a yard and a quarter in length, the one end of which,
<PB N="162" REF="85"/>
is fastened upon the Reins, the other bends over the Head, to which, is tyed a floating knot of red and white stuff, of almost half a yard long, and seven or eight Inches broad. They have more∣over a Crown of Cocks Feathers, and the Tails of Bares upon their Arms and Legs. Their Beds are as extraordinary as the rest, two Stags Skins serving 'em for Quilts, Sheets and Blankets: these Beds seem so delicate to 'em, that they are loath to leave 'em; and when that hap∣pens, which they do the latest they can, 'tis with no design to go to work, for they are neither Shoo-makers, Weavers nor Joyners. In a word, they make Profession of having no need of the most necessary Trades: or rather, they know 'em all, every one being capable of do∣ing what he has occasion for: their par∣ticular Dexterity lies in handling the Bow; and whether running, lying, stand∣ing, or sitting, they never fail of hitting the Mark they aim at, provided it be visible. They are also excellent Swim∣mers, but especially they run with an incredible Swiftness, and when they un∣dertake it, there is not a Horse that can outgo 'em; they have, while they are running, a piece of Iron of a round Fi∣gure,
<PB N="163" REF="85"/>
six Inches long, and five Inches broad; they strike with those Instru∣ments upon the Bracelets or Sleeves of Iron we have mentioned, to animate one another, according to the need they have thereof, making more haste, or making the less speed, according to the number of the blows they give. Na∣vigation is an Art which they do not understand; and all they know in point of <HI>Water</HI> is to cross a River in the hollow of a Trunk of a Tree: but tho they are ignorant of what is the delight of most other Nations, yet they live ve∣ry happily, fishing and hunting furnish∣ing 'em abundantly wherewith to live; and if they have an occasion or desire of something else, their Women have so natural an Inclination to Agriculture, that they find means, without the help of o∣ther living Creatures, to dispose the Earth, to produce 'em what they sow there. They make War after the same manner, that Savage and Brutal Nations do, <HI>that is to say,</HI> without Art and Or∣der; and what is therein most inhu∣mane, without Quarter too: for, those to whom Hazard gives the advantage, never give Quarter to their Enemies, for fear they should be taken with a de∣sire
<PB N="164" REF="86"/>
of returning to the Charge, or they should become more happy the second time than the former. <HI>Thus,</HI> say they, <HI>to remove all Fears that may arise from that side, it is requisite to take that course.</HI></P>
<P>Before I had seen this Island, I had of∣ten heard say, there were Men with long Tails like Beasts, but I could never be∣lieve it, and I thought the thing so far from our Nature, that I could hardly give credit to my Eyes, when they took away all doubts by an Adventure some∣what odd. The Inhabitants of <HI>Formo∣sa</HI> being accustomed to see us, we saw one another with so much confidence, as not to be afraid of any ill accident on either side. So that tho Foreiners, we belie∣ved our selves in safety, and went of∣ten abroad without a Guard, when Ex∣perience made us know that we hazard∣ed our selves too far. One day some of our People walking together, one of our Ministers being of the Company, went a Stones Cast from 'em upon some Natural Occasions, the others in the mean while walked still on, very attentive to a story that was told 'em. When it was ended, they remembred the Minister did not re∣turn, and waited for him some time:
<PB N="165" REF="86"/>
after which, being weary of waiting, they went towards the place where they expected he was; they found him, but without life, and the sad condition he was in, gave sufficiently to understand that he had not languished long. While some kept him, others went on several sides for to discover the Murderers: they went not far without finding a man▪ who seeing himself inclosed by ours, foamed, howled, and made 'em comprehend, that he would make him repent who should first approach him. His desperate Car∣riage made at first some impression, but at length their fears ceased, they took that miserable Wretch, who confessed, that he killed the Minister, but they could not learn for what reason. As it was a heinous crime, and that impunity might have ill consequences, they condemned him to be burnt. He was tied to a Post, where he remained for some hours before the Execution. It was then that I saw what hitherto I had not been able to believe; his Tail was above a foot long, all covered with red hair, and very like to that of an Ox. When he saw that the Spectators were much sur∣prised to see in him what they had not themselves, he told 'em▪ that that defect,
<PB N="166" REF="87"/>
if it was one, came from the Climate, since all those of the Southern part of this Isle where he was born, had the like as well as he.</P>

<P>HAving made Sail on the 15<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>July</HI> for <HI>Japan,</HI> we arrived there on the 10<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>August.</HI> Half an hour after having given the Signal of our Ar∣rival, we saw on board of us a hundred <HI>Japoneses,</HI> who made us a sign at their coming, that we needed only to be at rest, and they were going to do our busi∣ness. What desire soever we had to dis∣charge 'em from that trouble, we were forced to obey, and remain with Arms across, while some took away the Sails, others the Rudder, some the Ammuni∣tions of War, others the Anchors, car∣rying all on shoar, as well as the Mer∣chandizes, which were shut up in a Ma∣gazine, which the Governour of <HI>Nan∣guesaque,</HI> being the place where we went
<PB N="167" REF="87"/>
on Shoar, did answer for. This course was no Novelty it is a Custom establi∣shed for all strangers; the <HI>Japonezes,</HI> who are extreamly distrustful, act in that manner for the securing their Repose, for they are always in fear, it is l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss the Traf∣fique, than the desire of supplanting 'em, that invites other Nations thither. The Magazine which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have in that City, is situated in a little Isle, se∣parated from the City by a River of a∣bout forty foot broad. The Ramparts of that Island are of Planks of a foot and a half thick; the Bridge of Communi∣cation is an Hundred and fifty foot long, and fifty broad. At the end of the Bridge they enter into the Magazine, in the midst whereof is the House of the chief or principal Officer of the Company. 'Tis a very regular Building, very large and well furnished. There is round the Ma∣gazine a number of Houses, which form Streets of a good handsome largeness, where there are convenient places for the Inhabitants of that little City. On the Sea-side they descend by a large Pair of Stairs, from the Magazine to a great Court, where they discharge their Mer∣chandizes, which consist in raw and wrought Silks, in Velvet, Damask, Satin
<PB N="168" REF="88"/>
and Cotton, in Bucks and <HI>Kaimans</HI> Skins, in Quicksilver, Sublimy, <HI>Spanish</HI> Green, Camphire, Wax, Alum, Pepper, <HI>Elephants</HI> Teeth, and several other Com∣modities.</P>
<P>Three days after our Arrival at <HI>Nan∣quesaque,</HI> the <HI>Japoneses</HI> finding that the Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of our Mearchandizes did agree with what they had 'emselves unloaded, came on board us, and sealed up the Hatches; and to charm the displeasure which this course caused in us, they brought with 'em six little Barrels of <HI>Saqui,</HI> which is a strong drink made of several sorts of Corn, but wherein there is most Rice, and which fuddles like Wine. There were those of our Ships Crew, who without being much concerned for what might happen, gave their hearts up to joy, and drank so largely thereof, that they set up the Flag, round which they sung, danced, and to which they preten∣ded likewise to shew a Comedy, when a Hurricane came, and broke all their Measures; it came with so much fury, that we had hardly time to get into the Hold, than the Masts, Sail-yards, Main∣yards, all were broke like Glass, and cast very far into the Sea. Our Cables broke like Threads, and our Ship had such fu∣rious
<PB N="169" REF="88"/>
shakes, that we believed it was go∣ing to open; however it held good: wherein we were more happy than those who were at the mouth of the River, for they were so hardly treated, that they had much ado to save 'emselves. Those who were on Land, were not much more in surety, all running the risque of being incessantly oppressed under the ruins of the Houses, that fell pell-mell, which commonly happens on the like occa∣sions.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Nanguesaque</HI> is situated in 33 Degrees of <HI>Northern Latitude,</HI> in a very agreeable place. Very great and very Populous it is, but without Walls, as well as most of the Cities of <HI>Japan;</HI> its Port is large and commodious: it is full of fine Buildings, especially on the Sea∣side; over which do appear at a great distance the Towers of the <HI>Pagods,</HI> in great numbers. The Houses are only of Wood, as being l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss dangerous during the Earthquakes, which are very frequent in that Country, than if they were of Stone. Ordinary Peoples Houses, are pitiful and low; they are covered with Planks, which advance the one upon the other, and reach beyond the Wall about four foot, for to cover the Galle∣ry,
<PB N="170" REF="89"/>
which reaches the length of the Hou∣ses on the Garden side.</P>
<P>The Houses of the Nobility and the Rich, are more exalted and more beauti∣ful; their Apartments are divided, inso∣much as that of the Husband has no communication with that of the Wife. All the Chambers are painted and gilt, and generally the Houses there are more gay and agreeable than in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Walls on the inside are garnished by se∣veral stories of all sorts of Porcelaine Ware, and Boxes of a very fine Varnish, all being ranged upon Frames, that stand out for half a foot broad. The plain ground is a painting of some excellent workmanship, and from space to space the Floor is covered with great vessels of Porcelain, filled with sweet-scented Flow∣ers. The out-sides are not so fine, and to see 'em one would not say, that such nice Gentlemen as those of <HI>Japan</HI> would inhabit there, but enter never so little, and one is quickly undeceived. The City is cut by several Canals, much after the same manner as in <HI>Holland.</HI> There are counted Eighty Eight Streets, all in a right line, and four Hundred Paces long. Each of these Streets is locked up sepa∣rately, and from Ten a clock in the Eve∣ning
<PB N="171" REF="89"/>
until the next morning, there is no reason strong enough to have it opened. It is thought strange, that in case of Fire, or any other such like accident, that or∣der should be so rigorously observed, but when the <HI>Japanezes</HI> have taken a Resolution, it must needs subsist even at the Expence of their Lives.</P>
<P>The Country round about is pleasant and fruitful; most of the Nobility have their Houses that are only made for Plea∣sure, not only for that of the Eyes, but likewise the Taste and Ears: for besides sweet Oranges▪ excellent Pears, and o∣ther good fruits which grow there, the Birds with their wild Notes charm your Senses there more than they do in other places.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of all <HI>Japan</HI> do not pre∣tend much to whiteness. They are com∣only Tawny, but much less at <HI>Nangue∣saque</HI> than in other parts. Of a strong com∣plexion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obust Bodies, flat Faces, their No∣ses the same, and their Eyes small and black. The Habits of the Men consist in certain Vests, which reach down to their Feet, the one side crossing over the other, and being so fastned by a Girdle more or less large, plain or rich, according to the humour and inclination of every one.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="90"/>
The Modes of the Women differ little from those of the Men, for they are both much of the same length, and carried af∣ter the same manner; but Women of Quality have usually such Vestments as are so rich, that it is easie to distinguish 'em from the Commonalty: All their Robes are embroidered with Gold and Silver, at least those that are uppermost: if the others are not so rich, the Stuff of 'em is so fine, that they may put 10 or 12 of them one upon another, without hav∣ing too many Clothes on, or being too much troubled. All these Robes are hanging, and have Trains, and are ti∣ed with a Sash extreamly large, and which is answerable to the riches of the Habits. Though these Ladies are so pom∣pously cloathed, they seldom go abroad, and when they do so, it is either in a Chair or a Boat, as well because Walk∣ing is something too common to be the Mode amongst them, as because they have hardly any feet, having, like the Ladies of <HI>China,</HI> the folly to ima∣gine, that a Woman is so much the more beautiful, as that her Foot is small.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="90"/>
The <HI>Japonezes</HI> have for the most part great hearts; of what condition soever they are, they love Honour and Glory, and are so sensible of Contempt, that they do all things to avoid it, and for to revenge themselves if they are insulted; insomuch as an Artisan leaves his work imperfect, if he who employs him pre∣tends to treat him scornfully. There is no Nation that knows so well to con∣strain themselves, principally in Adver∣sity; they endure it like <HI>Stoicks,</HI> and the greater the Misfortune, the less does it outwardly appear. They have Friends as well as elsewhere, hut they never make use of them either to receive their Complaints, or to give 'em pity in their Troubles; how great soever they be▪ nei∣ther Regrets nor Murmurs are ever heard to come out of their Mouths. But tho they are firm in the miseries of Life, they are uncapable of a vain joy in Prosperi∣ty. They live there without Concern, and see with the same Eyes their Ad∣vancement and Fall. This firmness is a Vertue which passes in them from Fa∣ther to Son, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd is become natural to them by the frequent Revolutions to which they are subject; their Fortune is so wavering, that they may fall in a
<PB N="174" REF="91"/>
Thousand ways; and it is from Ex∣perience they have learnt to contemn it, or at least, to enjoy it without fearing to lose it.</P>
<P>With all this the <HI>Japonezes</HI> are not without Defects; and without speaking of their contemning Christianity, of their Idolatry, and that they have neither Pi∣ety nor Religion, but through Interest, they have little sincerity, never faithful to any body, and especially to Strangers. Cruel they are, treacherous, deceitful, and so vindicative, that to repel an inju∣ry, they violate the most holy Laws.</P>
<P>An <HI>Idea</HI> of their Cruelty may be had from the punishments they inflict upon Criminals, one of which consists in flea∣ing some parts of the Offendour, tying him to a Tree, bedawbing him all over with Honey, and then they leave him to the mercy of Bees and Wasps, who meet∣ing with such a Regal never leave him till they have stung him to Death, which he suffers with all the Tortures and Torments that may be imagined. Charity is a Vertue which they are ig∣norant of, and neither the Poor nor the Sick can hope from them either ease or pity.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="91"/>
The Government is Monarchical; above threescore petty Princes do Ho∣mage and Prostrate their Coronets afore the Supream Diadem. The Country is most part Mountainous, but full of Ri∣vulets, which makes it abound with Corn, Grass and Minerals: The North and East parts are less peopled than the South and West. Upon any trivial ac∣cusation, their Children are so sensible of their Reputation, that without any pawse, to evince the Truth, they will whip off a Joynt from their Finger, with this Imprecation, if true, I wish my Hand may never heal again.</P>
<P>Of all the great Towns of this Island, <HI>Fucate</HI> or <HI>Falcate</HI> is look'd upon as the most pleasant, being watered with a sweet River, and made defensive by a Castle; a Forrest of lofty Pines, and spreading <HI>Sycamores,</HI> for three Miles space, well nigh compasses the Town; of force a∣gainst the scorching Sun, delightful to the eye, more grateful than any other Object, did not Idolatry render it unpleasing; for under those green Trees, where are many small, but richly tyled Fotiques, they adore <HI>Pagothas,</HI> in shape not unlike <HI>Pan</HI> and <HI>Priapus,</HI> yea the Devil himself in his ugliest resemblance. For where
<PB N="176" REF="92" MS="y"/>
the Country is most inhabited, and gar∣nisht with greatest variety of Trees, and Corn, &amp;c. as 'twixt <HI>Edoo</HI> and <HI>Suring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> there are erected most Fotiques, and there the People are the greatest Idolaters. In <HI>Meacco</HI> a Mediterranean City, and the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Japan,</HI> are 60 Temples and Colledges, in which some have num∣bred 3333 <HI>Chamortirae,</HI> or▪ little guilded <HI>Daemons,</HI> of several shapes, which they call <HI>Mannada<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s:</HI> of which <HI>Shaca</HI> and <HI>Amida</HI> have the highest rank in their Kalendar. Nevertheless one of their Princes has erected there a monstrous Image of <HI>Awricalk,</HI> so large, as albeit was sitting, the Chair was not less than 70 Foot high, and 80 broad: His Head was capable to hold Fifteen Men, and the Thumb in compass was Forty Inch∣es, by which the rest may be conjectur∣ed. Near this grand Pagod is a <HI>Fotique,</HI> in the Cloister whereof a Memorial is registred, how that the Ears and Noses of Three Thousand of the captived <HI>Cor∣cans</HI> were there interred.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dabys</HI> such another Coloss of Con∣cave Copper was raised; an Idol 24 Foot high, notwithstanding his posture was such, as his Buttocks rested upon his Legs, as the usual Mode of the Orient.
<PB N="177" REF="92"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of most remark was the Fotique at <HI>Fencheday,</HI> where, if Fame speak truth, the Devil oft times made an Apparition. This Temple was of more than ordinary bigness, and the <HI>Bonzes</HI> numerous. A∣mongst other Sacrifices or Forms of Wor∣ship, one was, that a Damosel every New Moon was by the <HI>Bonzes</HI> brought into the Temple and placed right against the Idol. The Room was forthwith illu∣minated by a preparation of <HI>Lignum vitae</HI> with other costly Perfumes, put into a Lamp of Gold; after a small space, the Lights (as it were by a Miracle) extin∣guish, and then in gross darkness, the <HI>Phasma</HI> having assumed a Bodily shape, or other false representation accompa∣nies her, at least, as she imagines, and the rather, because certain Scales like those of Fishes are left behind as an argument to perswade it was no Phantasm. But unless the <HI>Bonzes</HI> second that work, upon that imaginary familiarity, the most is but a Tympany or false Conception. Ne∣vertheless for her Applause, at her issuing she is entertained with Musick and Songs, and the Enthusiastick Girl resolves 'em several Questions they propound, and is of more repute with 'em ever after.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="93"/>
One Temple is dedicated to a Lizard, which they make the Author and Patron of Learning without Altar or Image in it. He that readeth of the huge Works of <HI>Taiscosoma</HI> holding sometime an Hundred Thousand Workmen in labour at once, may present to his imagination the incredible Buildings which those Tyrants, by so many Slavish Hands, can raise. Their buisy Wits appears by their questions to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> of the Nature of the Soul, of Angels and Devils, &amp;c. And some of 'em seeing the absurdities of the <HI>Bonzii,</HI> worship nothing at all. The <HI>Bonzii,</HI> as the <HI>Jesuites</HI> report, raised slanderous Rumours of 'em, to be eaters of Mans Flesh, and causes of the Wars and Plagues, which their Gods, provo∣ked by this new Sect, sent among 'em: they slandered the new Converts as mi∣serable Apostates, which became <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> because they would not be at the Charges of their Idolatry. The <HI>Jesu∣ites</HI> tell of a great Woman, possessed with a Devil, which said, that he was a Fox, for some injuries offered by the Maid, thus dealing with the Mistress. There were in those parts store of Foxes, mul∣tiplied by their Superstition, not daring to hurt any, notwithstanding their great
<PB N="179" REF="93"/>
harms, hecause forsooth, they were the Devils instruments to punish 'em. Yet in this case, the Wizard being consult∣ed, counselled, to take a Fox, without hurting him, (which with a Trap was done) and to give him all kind entertain∣ment, with most delicate food and usage, so to pacifie the good Wifes angry <HI>Dae∣mon,</HI> who yet (like a Devil) with fair entreaty grew worse. Hereupon ano∣ther famous Wizard was called, who writ a long Scroll, binding himself in the Devil Foxes name to free the Wo∣man, subscribing with bis bloud; which Scroll he hanged on the Foxes Neck before taken, which being neatly trim∣med and shaven by a Barber, and paint∣ed (as their Women, being of pale Com∣plexion, use) was let go, and the Devil intermitted his Tortures a while, but af∣ter reiterating the same, the Womans Husband caused all the Foxes therea∣bouts to be slain, for this perfidious∣ness: and a third Wizard cured the Mistress, by Conjuring the Devil into one of her Maids.</P>
<P>They are very curious and ambitious in setting forth their Funerals. Thus briefly: The Friends assemble in their best Array to the Fire: the Women of
<PB N="180" REF="94"/>
his Acquaintance go forth in White Rai∣ment, with party colour'd Veils on their Heads, and their Maids attending, thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chief Women are carried in Beds, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Litters of Cedar. After 'em follow th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men in sumptuons Habit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Next come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Chief <HI>Bonzius</HI> of his Sect in his <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tificalibus,</HI> carried in a costly Bed, atten∣ded with three other <HI>Bonzii,</HI> in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Linnen Vestments, Then one in Ash∣coloured Garments (for that is also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mourning colour) with a long Torch lighted, sheweth the Gorps the way to the Fire; followed by two Hundred <HI>Bonzii,</HI> singing to the Deity which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dead had chiefly observed. Others bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the Bason till they come at the Fire▪ Others carry Paper Baskets full of paint∣ed Flowers, which they shake out by the way, as a token that his Soul is gon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Paradise. Eight <HI>Bonzii</HI> draw Banners on the ground, in which is written thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Idols name: Ten Lanterns with the same Inscription, are carried with Light<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> burning. Two follow with Torche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unlighted, wherewith afterward they kindle the Fire. Many come after i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ash-coloured Habits, with three Squar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Caps on their Heads, with the name also of their Devil therein written, which
<PB N="181" REF="94"/>
Name another beareth written in a Ta∣ble with large Letters of Gold. After all these (did you think you had lost him) comes the Corps sitting in a Bed, in white, borne by four Men, his Hands joyned in a praying Gesture. His Chil∣dren are next, the Eldest carrying a Torch to kindle the Fire. Lastly, comes the Multitudes with strange sort of Caps. After an hours hallowing their Holies by all this multitude, and three times com∣passing about the inclosed square place, in which (besides Tables for Viands) the Fire is made, the Chief <HI>Bonzii</HI> in an un∣known Language mumbleth over an Hymn, and lighting a Torch, doth thrice brandish it about his Head, (thereby sig∣nifying the Soul is without beginning, aud without end) and then casts it away. Two of his Children take it up, and af∣ter a triple Ceremony (the Body being laid thereon) kindle therewith the Wood: On which they hurl costly Woods and Oyl, and so burn the Carcass to ashes. Which done the Children, making In∣cense, adore their Father, as now assu∣med to the Heavenly Society, and rich∣ly reward the <HI>Bonzii.</HI> Next day they return, and put the Reliques of this Corps Ashes and Bones, into a guilded Vessel,
<PB N="182" REF="95"/>
which is hanged in the House, there to receive the like exequies, and afterwards with no less Ceremony buried; every Seventh Day, and Seventh Month, and Seventh Year▪ his Children renewing their Devotions. The poorer spend herein two or three Hundred, the rich as many Thousand Ducats. In the Obits of great Persons, the Lords and Men of Rank assemble 'emselves, and are call∣ed every Man by Name, to do honour to the Image of the Deceased, with Incense, as in Sacrifices. After so much wick∣edness of the Men, I think it will be time for us to leave <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>Our Trade being at an end at <HI>Nan∣guesaque,</HI> we departed from thence for <HI>Batavia,</HI> on the 30<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> and ar∣rived at the Fort <HI>Zelandia,</HI> on the 9<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>January.</HI> After some stay, there being a Ship that was going for <HI>Siam,</HI> I was comman∣ded to go thither, and we arrived there on the 22d. of the same Month. The <HI>Sieur van Muyden,</HI> Commander for the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, in the Countoir of that Country, caused 8 Elephants to be embarked on board us for <HI>Batavia,</HI> whi∣ther he himself went with us. Eight days after our Arrival, the Fleet departed for <HI>Holland,</HI> whither I had leave to return.
<PB N="183" REF="95"/>
As we had a good Wind, we in a short time passed the Streight of <HI>Sunda,</HI> and two Months after our departure from <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI> we came in sight of <HI>Sancta Helena,</HI> where having cast Anchor, we reposed for fifteen days. During the abode we made there, we killed a great many wild Boars, Goats and Deer, which that Island is full of, We took by fishing a prodigious quantity of Fish, which being salted and dried in the Wind▪ s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rves commonly the Ships crew the rest of the Voyage. We likewise found there Pome-citrons, and a certain Purgative Sorrel, which without being disagreeable, produces the same effect with <HI>Sene.</HI></P>
<P>After having thus refreshed our selves, we pursued our Course, whose end being as happy as the beginning, we went and cast Anchor at <HI>Gouri</HI> on the first of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> where I finished my Voyage.</P>
