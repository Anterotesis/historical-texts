If there be store (saith hee) giue euery one as much as he requireth: if there be but little, diuide it equally amongst them; to the ende there should neither be want of wine, nor any man enforced to drinke more then hee thought sufficiently conuenient: So I, tracing his steps herein, wish no man to spend his pretious time in reading this my historie, any longer, then it standeth with his owne liking: neyther will I discourage any one, that taketh liking therof, frō the cōtinuall reading; promising to him that desireth most, inough: and leauing to them, that at the most esteeme the least for i∣nough, leaue inough to vse therein their owne discretions. As for those who hauing once perused the same, and are desirous once more to renewe some especiall matters: as also for thē, whose waightier affaires will not lend leasure to the reading of so long an Historie, I haue set downe my Chapters so, as some of them are almost full histories; at least, amongst other straunge aduentures, containe sundry Tragicall and lamenta∣ble relations: The names wherof you may finde in the table. What faultes are eyther committed for want of good heede in the writing, or haste in the reviewing, it resteth in thy pati∣ence to pardon it: if in the historie it selfe, it remaineth to my power to perfect it.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S soone as the bashfull mi∣stresse of the morning, from the windowes of the East (mounted in her golden Char∣riot) had sent forth her radiant blushes to illuminate the dark∣some foreheade of night-sha∣dowed <HI>Cosmos:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olbiocles de∣parteth se∣cretly with Princesse Al∣midiana from Hungary.</NOTE> The illustri∣ous Prince of <HI>Graecia, Olbio∣cles,</HI> being alreadie spedde of his pretious prize, the inua∣luable Princesse <HI>Almidiana;</HI> poasted with all the speede pos∣sibly hee could, from the vnsuspecting Court of <HI>Rubaldo.</HI> And taking his troublesome iourney with most speedy cele∣ritie
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> from his pursuing enimies, within fower or fiue daies hee attained the vttermost boundes of <HI>Hungaria.</HI> From whence with great ioye entering into the confines of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Territories, hee leasurely shaped the latter part of his trauaile towards the famous citie of <HI>Constantinople:</HI> where arriuing, hee remained in secret in an acquainted friends howse, w<SUP>t</SUP> his most beautious sister (for so he termed her for that season) the admired princesse <HI>Almidiana.</HI> Who attyring themselues in vnknowne abillimenrs, trauersed vp and downe the streetes to their good contentment; vntill such time as <HI>Olbiocles</HI> page, <HI>Curio,</HI> hauing followed a great concourse of people to the Emperours palace; brought ti∣dings that <HI>Rubaldo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Open warres proclaimed betweene Hungary and Greece.</NOTE> king of <HI>Hungary,</HI> had by his Embassa∣doures proclamed open warre against the whole Empire of <HI>Greece,</HI> in regard of the dishonour offered vnto him, by the stealth of his daughter <HI>Almidiana</HI> from his Court, by you my Lord <HI>Olbiocles,</HI> quoth hee. But what answere (said <HI>Olbio∣cles</HI>) did the Emperour my father returne them? Answered y<SUP>e</SUP> page: He denyed any such fact to be done by his consent: and for his excuse (being vrged) hee proffered to defend his innocencie by dint of Sworde. And now on both partes they are making heade, to inuade each others Ter∣ritories.</P>
<P>These newes strooke the princesse <HI>Almidiana</HI> to the very hearte; so as her colour chaunging, shee was almost readie to swoune, for the sorrow that she endured: Insomuch as at length, enforced by the extremitie of her griefe, she brast forth into these passions. </P>
<Q><P>Wretched <HI>Almidiana,</HI> how art thou tos∣sed in the seas of endlesse trouble! and vexed with the tor∣ments of eternall anguishe! hauing no remedy to helpe thy misery, nor no Balsame to salue thy misfortune. First, by reason of my loyall loue, did I forsake my kingdome to enioy an husband: And now (miserable that I am) hauing obtai∣ned, I dare not be acknowne I doe affect him. And thus (vn∣able to preuent it) shall I see my deare deare loue, the causer of my Fathers, Countries, and husbands harmes: &amp; by their vntimely hurts, mine owne finall destruction: which I can not eschew but by danger; which I cannot conceale but to
<PB N="3" REF="6"/> my disparagement: which (gratious heauens) I would only might extend to me; thereby that I alone might wofully bewaile such happened misfortunes.</P>

<P>In these lamentations continued the wofull princesse of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> continually receiuing hopefull comfort from her deare <HI>Olbiocles;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grecian &amp; Hungarian armies en∣counter.</NOTE> vntill such time as (open warres being pro∣clamed on either parties, betweene the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Hunga∣rians</HI>) both the Emperour <HI>Claranax,</HI> and <HI>Rubaldo</HI> had brought their armies to the incounter: wherein many wor∣thy knights, on either side, by the deadly furie of their fierce opponents being most cruelly done to death, the Ge∣neralles at length pitying the wonderfull destruction of their innocent subiectes, incited each other to try the right of their quarrelles in a single combat: whereto the King <HI>Rubaldo</HI> was the first in moouing of the que∣stion.</P>
<P>Mightie Emperour of <HI>Constantinople</HI> (for though thou bee my enemie, I will not abase thy tytle) since it hath beene our vnhappie fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honorable not to dero∣gate euen frō his enemy.</NOTE> to contende in this vn∣kinde enmitie together, to the endangering of both our Diademes; let our indignation reach no more to the ru∣ine of our subiectes: but since for our cause is growne this contention, let our owne armes defende our iustice; that thereby none but the offenders might make satis∣faction for his offence, with his bloude. To which the

<P>Now are the souldiours on both sides, barred out by strong fastened launces from a prepared place, purposely chosen out by most skilfull champions, for the two chiefe∣taines to fight in which being finished; the king of <HI>Hunga∣ry</HI> entered as chalenger on a milkewhite palphrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Single cōbat betweene the Emperor Cla∣ranax &amp; Ru∣baldo.</NOTE> with trappings of the same coloured veluet, embossed about with siluer barres: prauncing vp and downe the listes with a wrathfull minde, expecting y<SUP>e</SUP> comming of his opponent: who presently approached the listes, on a dapple-gray cour∣ser, clad in rich caparisons of tissue; adorned with mightie hosses of the refined gould of <HI>Ophir;</HI> who, putting his Launce in the rest, gaue forth to encounter with his fierce <HI>Hungarian</HI> aduersarie.

But nothing amased at their falles, they rose vp lightly, &amp; vnsheathing their keene courtelaxes, they ganne speedily to prepare themselues to their foot encounter. But <HI>Olbio∣cles,</HI> at length fearing the heauie chaunce of warre between such noble potentates; hauing with him his beauteous <HI>Al∣midiana,</HI> with great celeritie possed vnto the combat; see∣ing so fit an oportunitie; stepped in betweene the menacing Potentates; and shewing his naked brest, began in this wise to allay the furie of the inraged Combattants.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olbiocles with the Princesse manifest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>clues to their Parents.</NOTE></P>

<P>Herewith he finished his speach with sighes; and as well the good Emperour, as <HI>Rubaldo,</HI> vnable to refraine from weeping, let fall their swordes and stoode amazedly gazing vpon their submissiue children; with sorrowfull soules, cra∣uing their reinstalment in their absented fatherly fa∣uours.

<P>Thinke not vntutored knight of the <HI>Tygre,</HI> that thy bare boasting and threatning braues, shall in regarde of the maintenance of so iust a quarrell, driue the meanest knight in the Emperours Court to his trumpes, or make any of vs feare thy manlinesse; whose manhoode wee haue neuer experienced.

<PB N="7" REF="8"/> returne to the citie; where hauing armed himselfe in vn∣knowne armor, arriued at the lists, as <HI>Alfortio</HI> was ready to enter: whom beckning aside, he entred the lists and prepared himself to answere the threatned obiection of his aduersary: Who hauing set his speare in the rest, spurred forth so fiersly against <HI>Olbiocles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Combat be∣twixt Olbio∣cles, and the knight of the Tygre.</NOTE> as breaking his staffe on his shield he pas¦sed by with as good a guerdon; being wounded a little in the left shoulder.

<P>Faire <HI>Grecian</HI> Prince (she said) if euer mercie did har∣bour in thy knightly breast; or thy mollifiable heart can relent at the pitiful intreatie of a Damzel, then be now most gently moued vnto compassion; and intimated by my wofull prayers, be gracious vnto thy vassaile: and though hee haue thus grieuously offended, yet (gentle <HI>Olbiocies</HI>) by my words, let thy heart be wooed to relenting. Damsel (replyed <HI>Olbiocles</HI>) is this wounded knight anie thing of kindred vnto you, that you intreate thus for him? Not anie thing a kinne to me (answered the Damzell) but for the deare af∣fection that I beare vnto him, I haue aduentured to craue his release. Damzel (quoth <HI>Olbiocles</HI>) at your intreaty I shal willingly grant him life; but otherwise assure you he should

<P><HI>Olbiocles,</HI> hauing thus obtained the victory of the knight of the <HI>Tygre,</HI> presently spurred his horse to depart againe from the companie; But <HI>Alfortio</HI> clapping his hand fast v∣pon his shoulder, beganne to stay his iorney with these speaches.</P>
<P>Sir knight, although I may thinke it a profered iniury, to be in such sort disappointed of y<SUP>e</SUP> combat; which in knight∣hoode I ought to haue performed; yet scorning to enuy your cheualrie, I only demaund you to declare your name. in recompence of the iniury.

<P>The distressed Princesse <HI>Almidiana,</HI> was somewhat re∣comforted,
<PB N="19" REF="14"/> by the good aduice of <HI>Eristama;</HI> wherefore she clea∣red vp her cloudie browes, and with a more mild fare (accor∣ding as her sorrow would suffer her) looking vpon the infant, he seemed to her thinking, to smile vpon her.

On what should they so (in vaine) con∣sult? Two wayes onely there was, both doubtfull; either of life, or death. If they should keepe him still, who coulde tell whether <HI>Ortolomorgantell</HI> would saue him; or offer him (according to his wicked custome) vp on the aultar; of his heathenish God <HI>Metrath Agorah?</HI> Or if peraduenture he did decline from his diuelish custome, and saue his inno∣cent bloud; yet it was too manifest, that hee should for euer∣more continue a most wretched captiue: where, if he had not what was sufficient to maintaine him, hee was like enough, eyther by colde or hunger, to suffer daunger. What then should be done? This one way wrought assured mis∣chiefe, and the other brought as mickle daunger. For if they should commit him to the mercie of the <HI>Ocean,</HI> who knowes not that the Seas are senslesse, and therefore mercilesse?<NOTE PLACE="marg">An hard choyse.</NOTE> If they place him in a boate, where will he haue victuals? or hauing victualling prouision, in this haplesse miserie, what man shall helpe him? Who shall feede him? or what kinde heart shall cherish him? Helpe himselfe he cannot: yea, though meate be put into his mouth, hee can not eate it He is but an hower olde, and can not shift: he is but tender, and of no force, and therefore can not helpe it selfe. what then shall hee doe? What meanes shall the wretched mother deuise for his deliuerie? Cast him into the Seas? Perhaps some nature-incited Dolphin, wil on his back take
<PB N="20" REF="15"/> pitie on him? Who knowes that? were hee <HI>Aryon,</HI> he could not without an harpe be saued: or had hee an harpe, being he could not vse it, it were bootlesse: or coulde hee vse it, yet being so tender, the windes would haue power of him, and the chilling colde of the billowing waters, would with a sodaine stifnesse stifle him. Oh poore childe, how vnfortu∣nate is thy fate, and how vnhappie thy chaunce, to be borne in such a time of miseries? Yet God shall purueye thee of better fortunes.</P>
<P>With these sorrowfull considerations, the wofull mother exceedingly terrified, for very griefe was readie to giue vp the ghost: but being recomforted by her ladies, shee recei∣ued courage to crosse her mifortunes; and at the last con∣sented, with patience to commit her silly soule to the tuiti∣on of y<SUP>e</SUP> calmed Seas. In which determination, taking the babe in her armes, bestowing on his heart (whereon by Na∣ture were liuely depainted the billowes of the Ocean; which by his hearts panting waued vp and downe like the mari∣time deepe) a thousand kisses, into his opened bosome, af- a whole volley of sighes, shee breathed out this affectionate farewell.</P>

<P>The wofull Prince of <HI>Greece,</HI> was greatly eased of his griefs, by this and such like pleasant tales of <HI>Curio;</HI> who en∣deuoured, both in speech and action, so neatly to set forth the matter he pronoūced, as <HI>Olbiocles</HI> could not chuse but both applaud the poore pages inuention, and added grace; which made the matter handled, farre more pleasant and delight∣some. But notwithstanding all this iouisance that he recei∣ued; he could in no wise forget the miseries that most galled him; neither did he at al leaue to meditate on his misfortū<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, for although his countenāce waxed calme, &amp; the clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of his browes were sometime cleared; yet his heart harboured dis∣content, and the faire welkin of his happinesse was surchar∣ged with sorrow; so as euen in y<SUP>e</SUP> very center of his soule, was sadnesse inclosed; and in his wofull breast, a whole legion of tormenting passions were included: which feeding vpon his liues maintainer, with such eager fiercenesse, as the star∣uen Eagle vpon the outcast carion, scarcely suffered him to desist one minute, from thinking on his deare and louing La∣die <HI>Almidiana:</HI> whose sacred <HI>Idea</HI> continually presenting it selfe before his sleepelesse eyes, caused new commotions to arise in his breast, and vnwonted perturbations to perplex his soule: which agony so afflicted him: as euen in his night∣ly rest (which was nought but of broken slumbers) he would rise out of his bed, exclaime against Fortune, and in his rage and furie call for his sworde and armour, to defend his di∣stressed <HI>Almidiana.</HI></P>
<P>In this perplexitie he continued almost for the space of fourteene dayes, with a most earnest desire, wishing to at∣taine some straunge harbour, where hee might heare of anie tydings concerning the distressed prisoned Princesses.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olbiocles arriueth on the round Iland.</NOTE> And after a while sayling, he came within the ken of an Iland; into the hauens mouth wherof being entred, he enquired of a certaine Marriner, the name of the countrie, and in what state the gouernment thereof remained. To all which inter∣rogatories the Mariner answered, that the countrie wherin they were now landed, was named the <HI>Round Iland;</HI> wherein in times past the cruell knight <HI>Acconumbo</HI> helde his tyrannie: for the which deposed and done to
<PB N="30" REF="20"/> death by the helpe of his daughter (who lately here arriued all massacred) and the vngentle prince that now raigneth; he left his diadem to this knight <HI>Proglador</HI> to inherit; who (as we heare credibly by the Damosels dwarfe reported) hath since most inhumanely murthered the young maiden, named <HI>Allua.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The inhabi∣tants in armes to reuenge All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as death against Trog∣lador.</NOTE> For which cause y<SUP>e</SUP> whole Iland is vp in armes; and by the reason of <HI>Trogladors</HI> mightinesse, it is likely that the contrary partie shall suffer a great hazard of their good fortunes, and the Common wealthes extreame ruine of her most loyall subiectes. The Prince thanked the mariner for his relation, and presently striking saile to come nigher y<SUP>e</SUP> shoare, he went a land with his dwarfe <HI>Curio:</HI> who carying his helmet and launce after him, trauailed farther onwarde into the Iland; when they perceiued a great company of pa∣uilions pitched about the walles of a Castle, wherein, as then y<SUP>e</SUP> Damozels friendes were besieged. Wherfore, he spe∣dily buckled on his helmet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olbiocles en∣treth the cāp of Troglador.</NOTE> and kept on his pase, vntill hee was entered into the campe of <HI>Troglador:</HI> where hee was greeted by a company of knightes after this sort;</P>

<P>In this anger he armed himselfe; and taking (on his arme) a most strong shielde of wel tempered steele, hee mounted a mightie Courser, wherewith he praunced gallantly vp and downe, before the gates of the Castle, awaiting the com∣ming of his fierce aduersarie: who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The iustnesse of the quarrel to be respect∣ed.</NOTE> in the meane time (being loath to enter the combat but in cause of trueth) examined the dwarfe <HI>Toydel,</HI> of the whole misfor∣tune of his mistresse: who making relation of her mi∣series, begunne in her life, and continuing vnto her death; declared also, how after the Damozell was so mas∣sacred, and himselfe toppled into the sea, by reason hee had some cunning in swimming, he attained the boate, wherein <HI>Allua</HI> lay murthered, and the helpe of a poore fisherman (whom <HI>Troglador</HI> kild for his labour) hee was set a lande on this <HI>Round Iland:</HI> where he, with the Damoz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls friendes and aliance, hath euer since sustained the furie of the tyrant.

<PB N="35" REF="22"/> was no lesse confoūded for ioy of this little Babe, &amp; his gotten infinitie of treasures, then the poore Princesse was comforted with the hope of her Childes more happy safety: wherefore with a glad hart &amp; a merrie gale, he cut his course towardes the coastes of <HI>Greece,</HI> fully hoping, for the presen∣ting of so bewtifull an Infant, to receiue of his Landlord (who was a great Gentleman of his countrey) some rich re∣compence for his labour.</P>
<P>But as no Garment sooner receiueth staine, then that which is most brightly coloured: nor any man sooner decei∣ued, then hee who by hope was most assured: so this man, in his chiefest expectation of good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kalus ouerta∣ken with a tempest.</NOTE> was sodainely crossed wyth vexation.

<P>¶ How after <HI>Orthisius</HI> and <HI>Alfortio</HI> had put themselues to the Sea, they encountred with a strange aduenture of the Dutchesse of <HI>Siracusa,</HI> whom they deliuered frō the terror of death, to which she was betrayed by the vniust dealing of her wicked Aunt: who by the consent of the Estates of the city, was put to a most cruell death; and the young Dutchesse reinstalled in her inheritance.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>Ven as these thinges were thus in acting, the two valiant Princes of <HI>Fraunce</HI> and <HI>Spaine</HI> hauing put themselues in enquest (as you haue heard) after y<SUP>e</SUP> Gyant <HI>Ortolo∣morgantell;</HI> bending their course towards the west end of <HI>Europe,</HI> they furrowed so spedily crosse the <HI>Greekish</HI> Seas, as into the <HI>Mare Mediterraneum;</HI> wherein they sayled a good space, vntill such time as by the rage of the rising billowes, they were enforced to seeke for harbour on the Coastes of <HI>Sici∣lia:</HI> where, surging at the porte of <HI>Sicacusa</HI> (a citie in the forenamed Iland) they were very ioyfully receiued by the young duke of <HI>Hybla;</HI> who was brother to a most beautifull Ladie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hisius and Alsortio ar∣riue at Siracu∣sa.</NOTE> being Dutchesse of <HI>Siracuse,</HI> named <HI>Oaezima.</HI> For the redresse of whose miseries, her brother <HI>Oreardey,</HI> hearing of the arriuall of the worthy Princes, attended their aduent with exceeding diligence; whome, hee causing to land, after
<PB N="37" REF="23"/> most courteous embracements, in this sort most kindly wel∣comed: Faire knights and (as I guesse) noble princes of <HI>Grecia:</HI> If vnknowne <HI>Choraebus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kindly enter∣tained by O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</NOTE> with his troupes of vp∣daunted souldiers, were in <HI>Troyes</HI> extreamity welcome to the distressed <HI>Priamus;</HI> or the resolued bandes of <HI>Achil es,</HI> w<SUP>t</SUP> his fierce and fearefull <HI>Mirmedons,</HI> acceptable to the <HI>Gre∣cians,</HI> in the time of intestine skirmishes; then thinke braue minded Champions, that your cōming is not vnwelcome vn∣to my country; or that I will prooue vnthankefull to the Almighty for your most lucky arriuall in my hauen, in this time of disaster; wherein I haue more neede of your heroick actions, then either <HI>Priam,</HI> or the <HI>Grecian Heroes,</HI> of their proffered succouring aiders. The Princes were ready to reply vpon him, when hee thus cut off their inceptions. But yet for all my miseries which I endure, let them not a∣ny whit aggrieue you, vntil such time, as (hearing the whole circumstance of our misfortunes) ruthe may driue you to rage, &amp; your conceiued anguish moue you to such exrreame anger, as by your knightly vertues you may dissolue y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Gor∣dian</HI> knot of our miseries. Herewith he led them with him towards the Dutchesses Palace, where the two princes found exceeding good entertainement, both for delicate cheare, as for sweete sounding musique: which, though it somewhat solemnely sounded, yet exceedingly delighted the noble Champions, so as with great content (after their royall welcomes) they betooke their wearied bodies vnto the downe-soft couches: with which they were not a little contented; finding themselues so safely seated from the furie of their late feared tēpest. In this quiet they remained vntil y<SUP>e</SUP> morning at which time <HI>Apollo,</HI> the daies glorious direc∣tour, had no sooner chased away the coale-blacke night; but that the noble Princes of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spaine</HI> presently brake off their slumbers, and attiring themselues in scarlet co∣loured veluet mantels, they were by an attending Page conducted into the Palace garden: wherein, by the varietie of most sweete smelling hearbes, flowers, and diuersitie of <HI>Indian</HI> shrubs, their drooping senses were exceedingly de∣lighted and refreshed, There they walked vp and downe,
<PB N="38" REF="24"/> meditating and asking many questions of the boy concer∣ning his Lord, and the young Dutchesse <HI>Oezima;</HI> whereun∣to, the Page in this manner answered.</P>
<P>My Lords, it is not the part of an honest seruant to de∣lay the delating of his mistresses sorrow; neither should it be the propertie of a curteous <HI>Siracusan</HI> bluntly to deny any interrogant, asking whatsoeuer is lawfull, and more necessary for the required, than the inquirers, to be decla∣clared: Therefore in that which I can, I will resolue you; especially touching my selfe: But as for any thing tou∣ching my Lady the Dutchesse of <HI>Siracusa,</HI> I neither can nor may informe you, since it is a matter onely to bee re∣solued by her selfe, after her deliuery: to the contrary whereof shee hath sworne neuer to performe any thing to the infringement of her determination, though shee dye therefore.</P>
<P>The two knightes seeing they could get no more con∣cerning this Ladie Dutchesse, being loath to vrge him to tell any thing against his will, or the oath of his deare Ladie; required the relation of his owne misfortunes wher∣unto the Page willingly consenting, reported vnto them the same, after this manner.</P>

<P>Although (most noble and valourous Champions) my mi∣series bee without remedy, and my sorrowes vnsalueable; yet. notwithstanding to requite your courteous requestes; I shall not sticke to rippe vp the whole history of my misfortunes. Know yee therefore, that in times past, I was bestowed by Fortunes sauour, on a most beautifull Ladie, for her Page: whom with how much loue and diligent care I serued for the space of two or three yeares, I will not at this time di∣late: onely thus much knowe yee, that I attended her w<SUP>t</SUP> such affection, as should she haue required my head I should haue thought my selfe ingrate, if I could not haue founde in my heart to haue giuen it her: But alas, I would she had had it, so by my death she might haue beene defended from following misfortunes: which a little after befell her in this wise.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="24"/>
<P>There was a knight of great power in the Iland of <HI>Vul∣cania</HI> (whereof my Ladie was Gouernesse) named <HI>Terindan∣tes:</HI> who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mabina La¦dy of Vul∣cania.</NOTE> as his possessions and power were greater than any others in the Iland; so he had his hearts centre im∣pleate with farre more pride, and his thoughtes soothed more high exceeding ambition, than any others else within the confines.

<P><HI>Teridantes,</HI> galled to the heart with this nipping repre∣hension, in a rage departing from the gates, vowed or e∣uer the Goddesse <HI>Cynthia</HI> had thrice changed shape, to

Which almost made him to be past all hope of euer winning it; and the rather, be∣cause that the defendants (in a sally, which they sodainely made out at a backe posterne gate, vpon his vnsuspecting souldiers) had by their valour not only greatly disturbed his Campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tarisdin taken pri∣soner.</NOTE> but also taken a Cosen of his (named <HI>Tarisdin</HI>) prisoner. Wherfore he resolued to breake vp his Campe: but cruelty not suffering him to proue cowardly, he sodainly be∣gan to stay, and bethinking on his reuenge, hee at length ef∣fected it by this stratagem.</P>
<P>Hauing parlously pondered with himselfe of the sundry mischiefes and infinite miseries that happened to a Com∣mon-wealth, through such ciuill warres, &amp; homebred con∣tentions, he cunningly concluded a peace for eight daies with the Queene <HI>Mabina;</HI> with lawfull leaue graunted for either other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Truce for eight daies</NOTE> quietly to passe and repasse from the Campe to the Court, or the Court to the Campe; and in as peaceable manner (during the time of the truce) to conuerse one with another, as if there had neuer before beene any deadly fued betwixt them. Of the which truce, not only <HI>Tirindates,</HI> but also <HI>Maniba</HI> (vnsuspecting future misery) was greatly re∣ioyced.</P>
<P>But how long continued it? Not (scarcely) passing two daies. For <HI>Tirindates</HI> (who minded nothing but reuenge for iniuries) cleane contrary to his taken oath and plighted fidelity, spying his time of aduantage (though hee was nar∣rowly watcht by the Queenes loyall defendants) entered y<SUP>e</SUP> Palace with his armed souldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mabinas two sisters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed.</NOTE> and laying hould on <HI>Ma∣binaes</HI> two young sisters of exceeding beauty, in spight of
<PB N="41" REF="25"/> of all the resistance that could be made to the contrary, hee departed with them to his tents; where, for that night hee kept sure watch and ward about his armie, for feare of some sodaine sally from his fortified enemies. Which indeed ser∣ued him in good steede; for about midnight, hee had gone nigh to haue payed for his treason, had hee not beene fore∣warned by his skoutes; and so being in a readinesse, pre∣uented the furie of his assailants. But, what profited these secret assaults? since what they aduentured for, was in the handes of their enemies. On the next morrow, <HI>Tirindan∣tes,</HI> causing all his army to be in armes, with a troope of lusty knightes, caried with them the Queenes sisters to the gates of the Palace: where, erecting a place of execu∣tion for the two innocent young Ladies; he threatned the Queene, that vnlesse shee would presently deliuer him his captiue cosen <HI>Tarisdin,</HI> she should speedily see the destructi∣on of her louing sisters; who wofully houlding vp their hands, most pitifully requested her hearts compassion. But, as the Lyon scorneth to bee bearded by any seruile or base condicioned beast;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maiesty cannot brooke in∣solency.</NOTE> but with his pawes and gnashing his tushes together, will fiercely assaile him: so this worthy Queene disdaining the terrible threates of the disloyall traitour, with a couragious heart, and vnterrified sto∣mache, for his former menace, did mete the like measure.</P>
<P>Doe what thou canst, or darest, proude Traitour (quoth shee) vnto my innocent sisters: for of this thou maiest bee assured, that if they perishe; nay if thou doest but wring their fingers, thy Cosen <HI>Tarisdin</HI> (whom thou louest as dearely as thy life) shall of his heade, make a footeball for my souldiers to spurne at.

And then againe hee set∣tled him to sollicite his former suite. Nowe Queene <HI>Vol∣cania,</HI> resolue thy selfe what thou wilt doe; since thou se∣est mee resolute in my enterprise: answere mee to the proofe: wilt thou restore my Cosen <HI>Tarisdin?</HI> or wilt thou perspect thy second sisters execution? Speake therefore,
<PB N="42" REF="26"/> and that briefely: otherwise, no longer deceiue thy selfe, but be sure I will make short with <HI>Straffera.</HI> Herewith hee paused a while, expecting the Queenes determi∣nation.</P>
<P>But <HI>Mabinaes</HI> heart being already stricken deade with the former butcherly spectacle; and with sorrow amazed in her soule, for her sister <HI>Katharinas</HI> death; ouerwhelmed in a sea of griefe, shee sanke downe in a swoune; not being able for the space of halfe an howre to vtter one worde, or heaue vp the liddes of her eyes; vntill such time, as reuiued from her passion by the piteous and lowde cryes of her loyall subiectes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Straffera beheaded.</NOTE> who lamented the death of her second sister; shee sodainely started vppe: and viewing the cruell murder, cursing and crying out vpon the wicked Traitour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tarisdin slaine.</NOTE> shee resolued on reuenge on captiue <HI>Tarisdin:</HI> whome causing to bee helde ouer the walles by her souldiers, with his owne dagger shee digged out his heart from his traiterous brest, and griping it in her hand, shee flang it, in des∣pite, at <HI>Tirindantes</HI> face, saying; And not this onely, O bloudie tirant, but a farther reuenge I doe seeke for.</P>
<P>With which her fierce reuenge, <HI>Tirindantes</HI> being enraged, presently embattailed his armie; and approa∣ching to the walles of the Palace, at the seconde as∣sault, hee mounted the gates; and winning the ma∣stery ouer the Queenes subiectes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mabinas power o∣uerthrown and her eyes put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t.</NOTE> in his fury hee put all to the sworde, except the Queene (whome, hauing put out her eyes, hee keepeth in extreame thraldome) and a fewe others, who getting out by a posterne gate, fledde for the safety of their liues both night and day from the furie of their pursuing enemies.

<P>The two Princes of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Fraunce,</HI> were greatly mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed at this dolefull lamentation; &amp; therfore turning them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lues to the Page, they enquired of him y<SUP>e</SUP> cōplainants name,
<PB N="45" REF="27"/> as also the estate of torments, wherein she remained. Wher∣vnto, Noble Knight, answered the Ladie, this is the La∣die Dutchesse of this Cittie called <HI>Oezima;</HI> sister to my L. y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke of <HI>Hybla:</HI> who by y<SUP>e</SUP> insidious dealing of her Aunte, the ould Dutchesse <HI>Atrielpha,</HI> is here cast into this prison, where she sustaines her wearie life with onely course bread and puddle water; which with a woodden dish, she is fayne to take out of the stinking kennell, that runneth cleane tho∣rough the dungeon: thus doth she lie helplesse and hopelesse continually, as at this time, imploring the heauens, to haue mercy on her soule, wearied of her earthly tormented body.</P>
<P>Herewith, entred the Duke of <HI>Hybla,</HI> into the Garden vnto them; who, with teares in his eyes, requested their knightly ayde in the defence of his imprisoned sister, against three wicked Knights, that wrongfully accused her for the death of her Husband, the late Duke of <HI>Siracusa,</HI> &amp; in defence of their quarrels, taken on the behalfe of the ould Dutchesse <HI>Attrielpha;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Princes accept the combate a∣gainst Atriel∣phaes chalen¦gers.</NOTE> threatning to venture their bodies against any Champions. Which when the valiant Princes heard, they bad him be of comfort; for in their owne persons they meant to combate the Knights Traytors; and yer long, by force of armes to make them openly to confesse their treason. And presently they departed to their chambers, where endorsing on their armours, they were attended on by 4. Dwarfes, who carryed their Speares and Helmets.</P>
<P>In this guise, they came into the palace base Court, where they found their aduersaries (according to the won∣ted custome, which should continue for Fiue moneths) at∣tending the comming of any knights, that durst aduenture to challenge them for their treason: who praunced vp and downe the listes with such infinite pride (daring the behol∣ders with their threatning menaces) as the heroycke min∣ded Princes of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Fraunce</HI> (vnable to endure silent any longer) began to thunder forth their deaths peale, into their eares.</P>
<P>At the last, O ye wicked traytours; at the last (I say) the iust Gods from their heauenly thrones perceiuing your per∣petrated villanies, haue prouided for the safetie of oppressed
<PB N="46" REF="28"/> Innocent, and in his iust iudgements, will powre downe vengeance vppon the heades of the malefactors. Prepare your selues therefore (O ye wicked men) to receiue the iust recompence of your treasons, by the hands of them, who not for number, but iustnesse of the quarrell, will offer you the combate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They enter combate.</NOTE>Herewithall the Princes entered the lists, and the three Knights (whose names were <HI>Licandro, Mirnao,</HI> and <HI>Rogesto</HI>) prepared themselues to the Careyre.</P>
<P><HI>Licandro,</HI> and <HI>Rogesto</HI> fewtered their Launces at once against <HI>Alphortio,</HI> who receiued them with such a fiercenesse, as, though they both brake their speares vppon his shielde, yet he little or nothing moued, but answering them in their owne language, gaue <HI>Rogesto</HI> such a wicked welcome, as piercing him cleane through the cuirace into the flesh, hee made fal dead to the groūd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rogesto slaine.</NOTE> where he lay gasping for life, vn∣till they had begun the second Careyr: which being perfor∣med with Semitars was very notable, and of a pretie con∣tinuance, vntill such time, as <HI>Licandro</HI> hauing wounded <HI>Al∣fortio,</HI> in the sword arme, so enraged him, as the <HI>Spaniarde,</HI> little liking such a bargaine, with a maine blowe striking of a great peece of <HI>Licandros</HI> helmet, and a péece of his brawne of the shoulder, rendered him a sufficient requitall for his proffered furie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Licandro wounded.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the meane season, <HI>Mirnao,</HI> who was in combate with <HI>Orthisius,</HI> seing how the world went with his companions, hauing receiued a great fall, and being likely to receiue the foyle at his enemies handes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirnao yeil∣deth, and re∣uealeth the treason.</NOTE> fell downe on his knees, and yeilding vp his weapon to the Prince of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> confessed openly his complotte, and how they were allured, by the ould Dutchesse <HI>Atrielpha,</HI> vniustly to accuse the innocent <HI>Oezima,</HI> of the murther of her husband the good Duke of <HI>Siracusa;</HI> whom in a secret complot w<SUP>t</SUP> the ould wicked Dut∣chesse, they had most cruelly done to death, and throwne him into the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea. Which discourse, so soone as the beholding people had heard related, they cast vp their hats for ioy of the Dutchesses approued Innocence: &amp; not any longer withhoulding their furies, they leapt ouer the listes, and in a
<PB N="47" REF="28"/> rage, running to the ouercome traytours, they sett fiercely vpon them, &amp; neuer rested, vntil they had torne their flesh from the bones, no man thinking himselfe happy, but he that had rent some gobbet from the slaughtered carcases.</P>
<P>Cursed <HI>Atrielpha,</HI> in the meane while knowing by y<SUP>e</SUP> shoute of the people, howe the matter stoode with her Champions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atrielph de∣termineth to murther Oe∣zima.</NOTE> pre∣sently ran towardes the prison gates, with a clubbe in her handes, meaning to dispatch the innocent Dutchesse: but blinded with rage, not knowing where to finde the key of y<SUP>e</SUP> dungeon, she cursed her selfe, banned Fortune, &amp; exclaming against the Heauens, so sayde at the dore with her iron bee∣tle; as by the reuerberation thereof, <HI>Orlardey,</HI> being aduer∣tised about what worke the wicked wretch was, called vnto the worthy Champions, and conducting them vnto the dun∣geon dore, surprised the ould Traytresse, yer she were aware,<NOTE PLACE="marg">She is attach∣ed.</NOTE> and carrying her in their armes, out vnto the people, requi∣red their iudgements, to what death she should be cōdemned: whereunto, some answered this, and others that, according to the common prouerbe;
<Q><L><HI>Quot homines, tot sententiae.</HI></L>
<L>How many men, so many sundry mindes.</L></Q></P>
<P>AT length they required her to be deliuered them where∣unto, at the Duke at <HI>Hyblas</HI> intreates, the Knightes consented, and yeilding her into their handes, gaue them power of her life &amp; death. So soone as they had her among them, they stripped her out of her clothes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atrielph tro∣den to death by the people</NOTE> and tying her hande and foote, ran vp and downe ouer her, vntill such time as they hadde squiesed her to death by their often treading. Whome, being thus dispatched, they cast into the Hauen of <HI>Siracusa;</HI> reioycing in their harts, that they had taken such vengeance on her treason.</P>
<P><HI>Oriardey,</HI> in the while returned vnto the prison, vnto his pined sister: whome loosing from her chaynes, hee brought forth of the dungeon, into the vpper Chamber: where cau∣sing her to put on her best attire, and declaring vnto her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oezima set at libertie.</NOTE> the whole historie of her releasement, brought her by the hand into the palace Hall; in humble wise, to render thanks for her happy deliuery, fro her thraldome which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sone as she

God forbid; &amp; the Heauens themselues will frowne, if so great a crime should be passed duer so lightly: herewithall they rushed into my chamber, where I was rea∣ding of my booke, and all at once, rayled on me saying: Ah, ha, thou wicked woman, and thou villanous wretch, for all thou couldest doe it so cunningly, yet by the iust iudgement of the Heauens thy treason is detected: I, poore soule, was
<PB N="49" REF="29"/> not a little amazed at these their out-cries, but standing still in a sodaine passion, I gazed vpon them, not knowing in my hart, after what sort to answere vnto their vniust accusati∣ōs: wherupon my infidious Aunte taking sufficient aduan∣tage, sayd: See you not (O you worthy knight) howe her shamefull silence detectes her, and howe hee heart pricked with the stinge of her infected conscience, withhouldeth her tongue, from executing the function of an excuser?</P>
<P>Herewithall, I could with-hould no longer: But, O yee iust dooming Iudges of <HI>Olimpus</HI> (quoth I) looke downe frō your throanes of Iustice, and with the eyes of Truth per∣spect my vnspotted innocence, that is accused wrongfully of what I neyther knowe, nor euer committed.</P>

Which he, knowing the force of my husband, &amp; by armes not daring to attempt, by a newe deuised and vnsuspected stratagem, in this wise ef∣fected.</P>
<P>He caused by the sea side, a huge theater of lime and stones so artificially to be builded by most cunning workemen; as, it hauing but only one little wicket to enter in at, seemed within to haue an infinite number of faire posternes, which being barred ouer with great iron plates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A stran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stratag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> obumbred (from the sight of any straunger) the viewe of a number of great pipes of leade, which dispersed themselues into euery pos∣terne so innumerably, as being vnstopped by the most cunning <HI>artifex,</HI> they would in a short time, ouerflowe the whole compasse of the Theatre, and drowne all, whatso∣euer was therein contained.</P>
<P>This deceiptfull instrument, thus vnhappily, by the great
<PB N="54" REF="32"/> labour &amp; toyle of most expert workmen, at last finished; <HI>Mar∣cin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odes</HI> in most curteous and louing manner, inuited my Lord and husband <HI>Asd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey</HI> vnto that accursed Theatre, to the end to be hould the sundry fights of most strange beastes and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrible monsters;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falshood in fellow∣ship.</NOTE> whereof at that time he had prouided a number, which were sent him from the deserts of <HI>Ara∣bia.</HI> With which his curteous embassage, my deare husbād (enticed to his destruction) repaired, accompanied with a royall troope of loyall attendants, according to his promise, vnto the forepointed place of the beholding pastimes: into the circuit of whose fatall walles, being graciously conduc∣ted by certaine attendants of <HI>Marcimodes,</HI> they remained expecting the performance of sundry promised pastimes. Which expectation was accordingly in a moment satisfied, to their no small content, that least of all suspected any fol∣lowing misfortune.</P>
<P>But when men thinke themselues most secure, then are they most subiect to danger: as it fell out with my deare <HI>As∣drey,</HI> and my suspectlesse countrimen. For, in the very mid∣dest of their pleasures, when they were most intenciue to their sports, the tyrant caused the leaden pipes to be ope∣ned by his artificers: which spouting forth their streames all about the encōpassed game-place, yielded no free roome from the springing of their waters: which in short while, swelling vp as high as a mans chinne, gaue the drenched <HI>Carthagenians,</HI> a sufficient warning to seeke shiftes for their safeties. But all was in vaine: for out at the gates, they could not passe; by reason the wicket was with wa∣ter ouerwhelmed, and also so surely barred, as had <HI>Her∣cules</HI> beene in such a taking, his clubbe would haue done him little seruice. What then should they doe? Get vp the walles they might not: for, beside the daunger in climing, the <HI>Thebans</HI> with their warlike weapons so resisted the skalers, as either armelesse, or headelesse, they sent them backwardes into the water. How then shoulde they saue their liues? By a hard shift for they must either swimme or sinke: and endure aboue water they could no longer, but vntill they were wearie: which (out of doubt) would be very
<PB N="55" REF="32"/> quickly: for most of them already had yielded vp their ghostes, and with their heads dounewards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A woefull &amp; lamen∣table exi∣gent.</NOTE> bid adiewe to the world in the bottome of the water. In the meane while my poore and louing <HI>Asdrey</HI> laboured for his life; and being in a quandary, whither hee should sinke or swimme, was cheered vp with this comfortable speech of <HI>Marcimo∣des:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cold com∣fort.</NOTE> Maintaine thy wearie life by swimming a little lon∣ger, O noble <HI>Carthaginian</HI> king; and I shall fetch thee a sufficient supporter to holde thee vp from sinking. My innocent husband, though hee was almost deade with o∣uer-labouring himselfe in the water; yet hearing the Ty∣rant speake so gently, as well as hee could, hee rendered him thankes for his vnlooked for curtesie, and with all his might, stayed his bodie against the side of the wall, expec∣ting the comming of the outragious Tyrant:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sigandes beheaded.</NOTE> who mind∣ing nothing but infidious cruelty, presently caused my sweete sonne <HI>Sigandes,</HI> by his souldiers, before my hus∣bands face to bee beheaded.

<P>But, as soone, as the blushing morning had brought as∣sured tydings of the approaching day, the noble Gentle∣man of the Sea (with a desirous minde of finishing the ad∣uenture of the Inchaunted shield) arose out of his bed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virtue is im∣patient of de∣lay.</NOTE> and with all haste possible he shaped his way, towards his foster-mothers, the Queene <HI>Raniraes,</HI> chamber: whom finding wal∣king alone in a faire large gallerie, very fairely hunge with right Tapistrie, he thus dutyfully saluted</P>
<P>My deare Mother, Gods graunt you a happie daye, and sende you as pleasant a downe-lying, as they haue affoorded you an vnsorrowfull vprising.

<P>The Queene answered him very pleasantly againe, some time reprehending him, and some time reioycing at his handsome saluing of his ignorante dispute, with excuses and therewith shee beganne to propound her second questi∣on, to Sir <HI>Luganto;</HI> who excusing himselfe, by shewing them the toppe of the rocke of the charmed shielde, gaue <HI>Ka∣nira</HI> occasion to reprehend <HI>Oceander</HI> a little, for his so long tarying in his related story, as also the rest to haue a need∣full care of both the Prince <HI>Oceander,</HI> and their owne a∣billiments; to the end that when they should attempt any dangerous aduenture, they might not the sooner miscarry by reason of some vnlooked to misse, in their armour.

For to what other purpose doth the rocke effuse so exceeding a splendour about the shield? but therby to manifest, how thy exceeding valiancy shall make thee wondersome, and thy heroicke atchieuements shall make thy glory to illuminate the earth: as in a sommers day doth the glorious raies of light-bringing <HI>Tytan,</HI> begild the billowes of the Ocean with his brightsome reflexions.

<P>The forward young Prince, hearing his mothers com∣fortable excitements of him, to vndertake the performance of the enterprise, though hee foreknewe it to be somewhat dif∣ficult in atchieuing; yet with an vndaunted stomach hee de∣termined to hazard the aduenture: and in this resolution set∣ting spurres to his Palfrey, he galloped a pase towardes the rocke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceander vn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orsed by an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uisible op∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onent.</NOTE> determining in spight of his inuisible resisters, on horsebacke to approach the shield.

<P>This notwithstanding, he was no whit at all abashed: but rather enraged at his receiued fall, hee leaped vp light∣ly on his legggs againe: and vnsheathing his good Curtelax (that for the approuednesse thereof was cleped <HI>Scindifer</HI>) he mainly pressed on vnto the rocke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatchieueth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e aduenture</NOTE> and clapping his armed hand vpon the shield (for all he receiued multitudes of buf∣fets on his gauntlet) by force he pulled it from the hard stone where it was fastned; &amp; clapping it before him, he supposed by the safegard thereof, to rush through the middest of the vnseene defendants. But as he was so indeauoring, he was thus staide by the sound of a voice, which proceeding from the hollownesse of the rocke, pronounced forth these words of comfort.</P>

<P>These verses draue such exceeding ioy into the young Princes heart, as hee presently kneeled downe vpon his knees, and with great deuotion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nulli pietate secundus.</NOTE> he rendered thanks to the Gods, for that they had giuen so good successe vnto his en∣terprise. Which his sodain gladnesse, so soone as <HI>Carthagini∣nian Kanira</HI> perceiued, with the other six knights, she ranne vnto the young gentleman of the Sea, and most kindly em∣bracing, and kissing him, she gratefully rendered him excesse of thankes for his good atchieuement: which being thus happily finished, with great ioy and mirth, they mounted thē∣selues (hauing before alighted for the <HI>Bassient</HI>) and putting spurs to their Palfreys, they pased home againe withan in∣different celerity: &amp; hauing forgotten to propound any more questions, they counted it their <HI>propositum,</HI> to prattle onely of the prince <HI>Oceanders</HI> actions; which not only the knight, but the Queene herselfe; euen vnto the very heauens, extolled with admiration.</P>
<P>Iourneying onwards in this sort towards their Castle in great iouisance, they perceiued a farre off, a dwarfe to ap∣proach towards them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dwarfe frō Artimagus.</NOTE> leading a horse loaden with very cost∣ly furniture for a warlike Champion: which being of a new faire colour very richly ennameled, and beautified with di∣uers rockes of gould &amp; siluery hewe, interlaced here &amp; there w<SUP>t</SUP> sundry sorts of Cristall scaled fishes, made such a faire shew through y<SUP>e</SUP> pleits of a loose Lawne (wherwith it was co∣uered) as this troope of gallants were greatly delighted w<SUP>t</SUP> the beautifulnesse therof. But so soone as the dwarfe was come something nigh vnto them, he demaunded, which of thē was the young gentleman of the Sea? Who being shewed him, taking <HI>Oceander</HI> by the armed hand, &amp; kissing it, hee in this wise saluted him from his master: Noble gen∣tleman

<P>Hauing ended his salute, hee tooke downe the armour from his hackney, and vncouering it, gaue it vnto <HI>Oceander:</HI> who not a little ioyfull for being owner of so gorgeous a piece of harnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceander pre¦sented with an inchaunted coat-armour from Artima∣gus.</NOTE> rewarding the dwarfe, sent him backe with innumerable thankes to his master <HI>Artimagus,</HI> for so rare a present: and causing himselfe presently to bee indos∣sed with his inchaunted armour, hee found it more fit for him then the nine hide-folded Target for the vigorous arme of the invulnerable <HI>Greekish</HI> Champion <HI>Achilles;</HI> and more gorgeous, then the Vulcan-framed armour of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> fetched from the <HI>Cyclops</HI> forge by the <HI>Paphian</HI> Goddesse <HI>Cytharea,</HI> when she sought for her sonnes safeguarde (from the fury of <HI>Rutilian Turnus</HI>) fighting for a kingdome, and his loue <HI>La∣uinia.

<P>But, by this time hauing sufficiently glutted their eyes with gazing on the gorgeousnesse of the armour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returned to the Castle they finde di∣uers of their knights woū∣ded.</NOTE> they once againe set forward to the Castle: which, by the shutting in of the euening, they entred; but alas, in an ill hower.

<P>The good Queene, hearing these sorrowfull tidings, was exceedingly vexed; insomuch as, sitting her downe, shee re∣sted silent for a long while; for very griefe of hart not able to vtter a word, and in that sort remained all the other, both knights and gentlemen: But <HI>Oceander</HI> (whose stomach ra∣ther yearned to wreake an iniury, than waile a misfortune; coueting rather to cry quittance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A noble minde makes mis∣fortune a spur to vertue.</NOTE> then to lamēt quite helples with his enemies) made <HI>Nigrastoes</HI> cruel dealing an edge to reuenge; &amp; enraged w<SUP>c</SUP> the <HI>Thebans</HI> actions, in y<SUP>e</SUP> vehemency of his anger, he plighted solemne promises, to requite <HI>Nigrastoe</HI> to the proofe for his so bould aduenturing: and therewith all hee plotted forth a stratagem, befitting to the night; and only made the Queene, and certaine others of his friends priuy to his attempts; with onely one dwarfe named <HI>Trufidill.</HI> Af∣ter his repast taken, hee departed from the Castle <HI>Carzar,</HI> and in the silence of the pitchy night, hee tooke his way spee∣dily towards the sea side; where hee rested himselfe vntill the appearing of y<SUP>e</SUP> cheerefull morning: whose due harbēger, <HI>Lucifer,</HI> was no sooner mounted on the clouds, giuing vnfai∣ned notice of the approperating day, but that this wor∣thy Prince remounted his Palfrey, and from the shoare side directly trauailed to the campe of <HI>Marcimodes</HI> (part wherof being not able to be lodged within the citie, was pitched, without the walles of <HI>Carthage</HI>) where being admitted vn∣to the presence of <HI>Marcimodes,</HI> he faining himselfe (more truely then hee thought) to be a <HI>Grecian;</HI> humbly requested his orders of knighthoode at the tyrants handes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceander en∣ters the camp of Marcimo∣des.</NOTE> to be giuen him. <HI>Marcimodes</HI> eying the yoūg prince, &amp; perceiuing him to be of an excellent feature, was very greatly delighted; and hoping thereby hee might winne the <HI>Greeke</HI> for his con∣stant friend, taking his sword and striking him three blowes
<PB N="74" REF="42"/> on the shield, he girded the knightly sworde vnto him, and commaunding him to rise sir knight, he schooled him to ob∣serue religiously and loyally his orders of knighthoode:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceander re∣ceiueth the honour of knighthoode of Marcimo∣des.</NOTE> and neuer but in a iust quarrel to offer the combat vnto any per∣son.</P>
<P>Schoole thy selfe tyrant with that lesson (quoth the gentle∣myn of the Sea) and teach not me those precepts, which thou thy selfe hast dissoyally eschewed. For assure thy selfe hereof <HI>Marcimodes;</HI> that I, only to correct such villany and iniu∣stice, haue at this time taken vpon mee these knightly orders. <HI>Marcimodes</HI> hearing the boulde (though true) speaches of the knight of the Sea, could in no wise re∣fraine from vttering his conceiued anger by his hearts mes∣senger.</P>
<P>Proud and vndiscrete new made knight, how darest thou, being but euen now inuested with the royall orders, once so presumptuously to vpbraid mee with disloyalty, who haue (almost longer yeares, then thou hast daies) with my sword, couragiously maintained the honour of vnstained knight∣hoode?

<P>Herewith, in a chafe, he went hastily into his tent to arme himselfe, thinking in a moment to haue made <HI>Oceander</HI> w<SUP>t</SUP> his life to doe penant satisfaction, for his committed presūp∣tion.

<P>By <HI>loue,</HI> thou foolish strippling.

Defend thee therefore; for not thou,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceander and Nigrasto en∣counter.</NOTE> but I, am determined the assailant. And herewith they both set spurres to their coursers, and encountered toge∣ther with such a fiercenesse, as both their Launces being shiuered in pieces, they prouided them of fresh and stron∣ger: wherewith, returning to the second encounter, they crossed each others helmes so rigorously, as <HI>Oceander</HI> was by the strength of his aduersaries push, inforced (in spight of his heart) to kisse his horse crouper. But <HI>Nigrastoe,</HI> hauing his buckles of his helmet broken, by the fury of <HI>Oceanders</HI> affronting, was deceiued of his headpeece: and being cast out of his saddle (and yet loath to leaue his stir∣roppes) hee hung backwardes at his horse heeles: who, in dragging him vy the feete alongst the fieldes, with his horned hooues, battered his armour, so close vnto his backeside and ribbes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nigrasto slain with his horse heeles.</NOTE> as hee soone made his weary soule with dolefull grones and heartbreaking sighes, to giue his battered bodie a sorrowfull farewell.</P>

Wherefore the baser sort of souldi∣ers, at so vnexpected an infinitie of enemies, stoode amazed; and their courage failing them, they wauered betwixt hope and feare, to whether side they should betake themselues. Which the valorous knight of the Sea perceiuing; like a good Captaine, in this sort hee cheared vp the hearts of his drouping souldiers.</P>
<P>O yee noble and couragious <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> my mates in armes, and worthy followers; what cause hath so crac∣ked
<PB N="90" REF="50"/> your credits? and what auke occasion hath thus cooled your vndaunted courages? What is it at a rabble of tyran∣nizing robbers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceanders oration to the dismayed Car¦thaginians.</NOTE> that you are amazed? and is it at the sight of a few base &amp; cowardly carpet knights that you are in this vnwonted sort troubled?

<P>But <HI>Oceander</HI> gained nothing by this bargaine. For <HI>Marcimodes</HI> couragiously brandishing his fauchone about his heade, hee rendered the knight of the Sea so sounde an answere vpon the crest of his helmet; as had hee not caught the surer houldefast vpon the stones, hee had gone nigh to haue staggered off from the battlements.</P>
<P>Yet recouering himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marcimodes tumbleth himselfe and Oceander downe from the wall.</NOTE> hee so furiously prepared his good sworde <HI>Scindifer,</HI> for his requitance; as <HI>Marcimodes</HI> loath to abide the doubtfull fury of his descending blowe, cast away his weapons: and grappling close with <HI>Oce∣ander,</HI> or euer hee was aware or able to preuent any such mischiefe, hee cast both himselfe and his aduersarie downe headlong amongst his souldiers; with a lowde voice cal∣ling vnto them; Heere, heere, O my worthy followers, heere lyes the enemy of all your happinesse, enclosed in the steely armes of your noble Generall, like conquered <HI>Hector</HI> yielded to the ouermatching might of the war∣like <HI>Ithacan.</HI> Hether therefore bende your forces, vali∣antly to bereaue him of libertie, who hath against the royall order of his Knighthoode, offered vnto our line∣age such hainous iniuries.

<P>Now in faith (quoth <HI>Oceander</HI> with a great laughter) this same burley piece of mans flesh brags well: &amp; if there came no better then I hither, in sooth they should praise his scarbugge faculty; and yet in despite of his threatnings, I remain here to try the euent of this enterprise. What a diuel, doth he thinke men of valour to be so foolish, as vpon his bare menaces, and the setting forth of his painted picture, so so∣dainely to terrifie their senses? Now by the high Gods of <HI>Carthage;</HI> I do verely auowe, that I shal neuer in my heart, ioy hereafter, if I cannot coole the courage of this boasting beast, <HI>Briarostes.</HI> And therewith, taking the pommel of his sworde, he bounced at the steely barres of the gate so sound∣ly, as he made all the Castle therewith ring againe: and then looking vp towards y<SUP>e</SUP> battlements, he espyed where the wic∣ked witch <HI>Mardigua,</HI> sate lasciuiously playing &amp; dallying w<SUP>t</SUP> the sense-reaued young prince <HI>Ptoladine;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardigua.</NOTE> who amorously en∣tertained whatsoeuer loue-trickes she offered. Wherat the knight of the Sea enraged, he said: Ah, thou wicked &amp; las∣ciuious woman; shamest thou not with thy whordome, to a∣buse so noble a yoūg gentleman?

<P>How commeth it to passe (my honour-vnminding Aunt) that by the little regard thou hast vnto my credit, thou hast suffered the damned wretches, to enter so neere vnto my Castle (whether neuer as yet, the best Champions durst ap∣proach) without condigne punishment for their aduentu∣ring?

<Q><P>O yee wretched death-seeking men, what fury hath incensed your foolish fancies, thus audaciously to attempt the indaunge∣ring of my dignity? at whose feete, both the liues of you, and al other <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Champions, are submissiuely humiliated:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Briarostes to Ocean∣der &amp; Me∣dion.</NOTE> in whose hands both your weale, woe, paine and pleasure is so surely engaged, as with the bending of my frowning brow I could worke your wretchednesse, &amp; with the furious out∣breathing from mine angry spleene, I could ouerthrow and consume you.</P>
<P>What? haue ye lead your liues at too much ease, and liued so pleasantly frée from the burdenous yoake of my afflictions; as now, growing carelesse of any farther continuing consola∣tion, you doe dare the triall of his strēgth, whose halfe-pitche vigour shal ouerwaigh your too weake bodies, to destructions</P>

<P> If so it be, proceede to your perill: but if, as wandring pas∣sengers, you haue in the middest of your iourney gone astray vnto this Castle, wee willingly (of curtesie, though not of custome) permitte you to depart hence, to the perfecting of your painefull pilgrimage. Hauing thus ended, hee sternely looked on the two valorous knights, expecting their answere: which, with resolution, was in this sort vttered by <HI>Oce∣ander.</HI></P>
<P>Thinke not <HI>Briarostes,</HI> that our comming to this thy Castle was by happe or chaunce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceāders answer to Briarostes.</NOTE> as waiefaring trauellers, which in their need seeke to relieue their necessities at some neighbouring hamlets. For know, that we are no painefull pilgrimes, but honour-prizing Princes; into whose eares the true report of thy horrible villanies being sounded, hath caused vs in this sort of set purpose to approach this thy for∣tresse: in armes to let thee vnderstand of the extreame wrongs thou hast offered vnto most mightie Potentates: and there∣fore wee craue at thy hands, restitution of iniuries; or thou denying (vtterly refusing thy proffered pittie, and scorning thy presumptions) wee defie thee to the combat; hoping yer the decline of <HI>Climenes</HI> Parramour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gyant defied to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he cōbat.</NOTE> to giue thee the iust recompence of an inhumane and butcherly ty∣rant.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Briarostes</HI> (hauing as yet neuer heretofore found any one that durst so bouldly vpbraid him with his villanyes) was so angred at the heart with the knight of the Sea; as, without bidding him beware, he flang his boare-speare so strongly at him, as had he not all the nimbler leaped from his station, he had beene peppered for his presuming. Which (as God would) missing him, smote so deepe into an oaken poste of the gate (which was ouercouered with iron barres) that they might well perceiue the diuelish gyants force was admira∣ble. For, almost fower hand fulles, he had hidden the iron head, within the thicknesse of the woodden propper, which was riuen euen from the bottome, by the force of the en∣tring.</P>
<P>Which <HI>Oceander</HI> well weighing, he determined, as little as hee could to hazard himselfe to the Gyants vnresistable
<PB N="105" REF="57"/> outward fury; &amp; therfore, as soon as he could, resolued to close with him. Where, although he receiued some small disaduan∣tage, hee knewe he could not greatly be harmed, by reason of the goodnesse of his armour: which being impenetrable, could neuer be bruised by y<SUP>e</SUP> crushing of his enemy: whē pray∣ing the helpe of the knight of the fiue swordes, in his extrea∣mity, he vnsheathed his good curtlear, &amp; bearing his inchaū∣ted shield before him, he couragiously pased towards the gy∣ant: who as furiously with his brandished fauchon with out-breathed threatnings aduanced himselfe as fast forward to meete him. Who incountred with <HI>Oceande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> so fiercely, as he made him surely to vnderstand the great power and strength that lay inclosed within the sinewes of his boisterous braw∣nie armes.</P>
<P>For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The comba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> with his fauchon he so lashed on the helmet of y<SUP>e</SUP> young Champion, as had not the inchauntment stoode him y<SUP>t</SUP> more in steede, for all his nimble auoidings, he had in a moment beene heawed into as smal pieces as flesh to y<SUP>e</SUP> pot. And yet, I beleeue, the gyant had but small cause to boast of his win∣nings. For, being but slightly armed, only with a single Cor∣slet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Briarostes wounded.</NOTE> as one who little fore-suspected any such aduenture hee was wounded so deepely on the thighes, and vnder the left side, as by the great effusion of his bloud from out those wide gashes he was so weakned, as (perceiuing he could not long continue the combat) he determined at one blowe to make an end of the conflict.

<P>But the couragious knight of the Sea, recouering againe vpon his feete, and seing that to endure any more such di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣lish buffets, was but to hasten himselfe to destruction, hee resolued a through requitall for the gyants fury.

<P><HI>Oceander</HI> reioycing at the calmed courage of the gyant, gently tooke him from the ground:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Curtesie mat∣ched with co∣rage.</NOTE> &amp; kindly embracing him in his armes, auowed, y<SUP>t</SUP> if he loyally performed his promises, not only not to accept him as his vassaile: but also, louingly to receiue him for his most constant friende Wherewith <HI>Briarostes</HI> was so exceedingly well pleased, as for very ioye the teares brast out of his eyes; and in a sweete extasie, hee manifested the great delight he conceiued, by y<SUP>e</SUP> Princes cur∣tesie: and therewith commaunding the gates to be opened, entered with the two knights straungers into the Castle∣yarde: wherethrough they had scarcely passed, but that wic∣ked sorceresse <HI>Mardigna</HI> hauing raised all her seruants in ar∣mour, came marching towards the knight of the Sea shoo∣ting, and casting arrowes stones, borespeares, iauelins, and darts; so fast and furiously against him, as it seamed for a while, that the heauens had rained them downe vpon them: so thicke they fel vpon the armours of the Champions.

<P>SHee had no sooner sighed out her sorrowes, but that the vnmercifull vsurper, entering the prison, reprehended her sharply, for being so lauish in her laments; with menacing words threatning her most cruelly to cut out that apt &amp; deli∣cate organe of her speach if she continued any longer in her lamentations. Which when the Noble minded <HI>Spaniarde</HI> heard, he thus began canuasse him for his beastly and trea∣cherous cruelty: In humane monster; &amp; vnciuill tyrant, who hath instituted thee a sterne corrector of most disconsolate Ladies?

<P><HI>Tyrindantez,</HI> though he was gallen to the very heart with these obiections, yet the better to make the common citizens to beare the better liking to his cause, he very patiently see∣med to brooke these menaces.

Who, with his heauy sworde smote so thicke and fury∣ously vpon <HI>Alfortioes</HI> shield; as, if he had in such sort long con∣tinued, he had not onely heawen his shield (wherwith he de∣fended himselfe) in sunder, but also gone nighe within lesse than an howers space, by wide-gashed woundes, to haue made his <HI>Volcanian</HI> grasse of purple hew, by the effusion of <HI>Spanish</HI> goare. But <HI>Tirindantez,</HI> beeing alreadye awearied with his so thicke bestowing of his vaine sent blowes on the shield of his valourous enemie, began somewhat more lazily to lift vp his courtleaxe, as if he had more minde to haue re∣sted his wearie limbes on some downe-bed, then continued his resistance against approaching daunger.</P>
<P>Which the worthy <HI>Spaniarde</HI> with great dexteritie tur∣ning to <HI>Tirindantez</HI> disaduantage, with his sword of spanish steele he so couragiously behaued himselfe against the Ty∣rant, as hauing sliced his shield in sūder, within two or three soundly sent buffets, he so cooled the <HI>Volcanians</HI> courage, as on his knees hee made his humbly to prostrate himselfe before his knightly feete. With which his so sodain foyle, the wicked vsurper was so enraged, as rysing vppe agayne, he so couragiously redoubled his blowes on his aduersaries shielde, as (hauing now sufficiently freed himselfe from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> furie, and fearing some sower answer to his sharpe obiection) making way w<SUP>t</SUP> his courtlear, through the thicke preasse of the behoulding multitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terindantez leaueth the combate.</NOTE> he left the combate: and despairing of any future good fortune, he speedily ran vp into the gate-house; and burst open violently the prison dore, where the vnhappy wronged Queene <HI>Mabina</HI> remained, in teares bewailing her misfortunes. To whome with a fained penitency, as sorrowing for the wrongs that he had done her, Now deare (though by my meanes wretched) Madame, said he, am I at last (lamēting my iniustice, and tyrannous mis∣dealing) come happily to release you of your torments. And therewith lifting her vp from the bare bords (by whose ascending, coldnesse her limbes were chilled, benumned and
<PB N="113" REF="61"/> stiffened) he knocked off her manacles, which hadde so long time made her beawtious body swell with their hard engri∣ping: and taking her gentlye by the (once lillie white) hands, he presently ledde her vp to the top of the gate-house; where she (poore soule) vnsuspecting any such insidiousnesse (to her griefe) heard him with an hoarce voice, to sound forth the dreadfull allarum, to her fatall tragedie.</P>

And wilt not thou aduenture a frowne, to obtaine her fauour? which is more glorious then a conquest, and more high-prized, then the Oliue garden: whose lookes infuse life, and whose pretty smiles, seeme a petty Paradice of eternall pleasures: whose ruddy cheekes like the raies of <HI>Cynthia</HI> re∣fresh thy loues flower; &amp; from out whose Rubilike fine closu∣rets proceedes a comfortable warme deawe, to infuse new mirth into thy loue-massacred soule in the middest of thy martyrdome.

Nay rather, thereby shalt thou worke thy con∣fusion, then content; and kill thy owne selfe, by quelling thy fancifull cogitations. For, what be came of the branch that was nipped? it neuer bloomed? true. For his opened iuyce being dryed vp by the hote reflexion of the scorching Sunne, sodainely withered: and the talent-wanting Eagle, neuer after prospered. Thus both perished: and so shall I, if I follow their example, finish a like end vnto my follies.

<P>With this conclusion, he cloased his eyes, and in their slō∣bers he quietly accōpanied his sleeping cōpanions: in which quiet repose, they remained y<SUP>e</SUP> remnāt of y<SUP>e</SUP> night: which no soo∣ner was put to accustomed flight, by y<SUP>e</SUP> appearing of y<SUP>e</SUP> bright∣some morning, but that these exquisite Cheualiers, <HI>Ocean∣der, Briarostes,</HI> and <HI>Medion,</HI> forsooke their graue-imitating beds: and causing their armoures to be presently buckled on their shoulders, crauing a conductour to the burning Caue, they tooke their leaue of their Hostesse: which was so soundly sealed on the lips of <HI>Lidia</HI> by <HI>Medion,</HI> as she had a suffitint <HI>Item,</HI> to iudge of his affections.

<P><Q>It seemeth vnmercifull Tyrant, by the outcryes that this captiued knight here maketh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceander to Grand Cardigan.</NOTE> that thou hast villanous∣ly offred him some outrage: which if it bee, assure thy selfe, incompassionate, infringer of the lawe of Nations, that ven∣geance is already at this instant hanging ouer thy vngrati∣ous heade; which powred on thee by the iudgement of the iustest Iusticer, shall make thee all to late to repent thy com∣mitted wickednesse.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Grand Cardigan</HI> (for so was the Gyant named) hearing the Princes peart challenge, could not chuse but laugh at his (supposed) folly. And therefore without speaking any worde, for an answere; with his huge hands hee thought to haue fastened vpon his helmet, and so drawing him into his Chariot, to haue there carried him captiue in company of his other prisoner: But he farre failed in his effectes. For <HI>Oce∣ander</HI> (whom vse of armes had taught to knowe aduātages) seeing the incōparable pride of the haughty diuell to exceede reason so farre, as with his weaponlesse hand to thinke to sur∣prise an harnessed knight; vnsheathing his trusty Curtelax, he so curtold <HI>Cardigans</HI> arme off at the elbowe; as the hand falling to y<SUP>e</SUP> ground he taught his haughty heart a sound les∣son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceander smiteth off the Gyants arme,</NOTE> for y<SUP>e</SUP> inconsiderate reattempting of any so dangerous an enterprise. But the diuelish Giant was herewith incensed with such an vnspeakeable fury; as for very anger, his eyes seemed to sparkle fire, and out of his ribs of his beauer his angry breath issued out w<SUP>t</SUP> such a thicknesse, as therwith his eyesight being dimmed, he sat stil for a great while in a quan∣dary, not knowing well which way to bestir himselfe: till vexed w<SUP>c</SUP> y<SUP>e</SUP> extreeme smarting of his wound, he grew sodainly so enraged as dismounting his steely Coach, &amp; furiously ad∣uancing his iron we apon ouer y<SUP>e</SUP> helmet of <HI>Oceander,</HI> hee let the blow descend downe with such a fury vpon his inchaun∣ted armour, as battering <HI>Oceanders</HI> shield with y<SUP>e</SUP> mighty forcefull poyse thereof, vnto his headpeece, hee made him sufficiently to feele the fury of such angry Giants. And
<PB N="124" REF="67"/> to say the trueth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A daungerous combat be∣tweene Oce∣ander and Grand Cardi∣gan.</NOTE> had not the iron mace beene somewhat more, then the maimed monster could well haue wielded, <HI>Cardigan</HI> had at that one blowe, battered <HI>Oceander</HI> all so pieces. For such was the inuincible force of this giant before he happenned to be thus dishanded, as young oakes pluc∣ked vp by the very rootes, scarcely sufficed him for a mace, to ouermaster the most mightiest monsters: and with his owne hands he would subdue fierce Lyons, and bring them to a wonderfull tamenesse. But y<SUP>e</SUP> heauens viewing his pride to be so vncomparable, at last made him to bee humbled by a knight, whose stature (though not stomache) was farre, to his, inferiour. For the worthy knight of the Sea (though hee was beaten to the ground, and sorely inly brui∣sed by that diuelish stroke of <HI>Cardigan</HI>) so nimbly arose from the slippery earth, as before <HI>Cardigan</HI> could mount his mace to redouble his blowe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceander grappleth with the gyant.</NOTE> he was gotten within him; and running strongly against him to ouerthrowe him, he great∣ly bruised the gyants armour; but by his vneffected po∣licy, enwrapped himselfe in a net of exceeding daunger: which surely had beene ineuitable; had not <HI>Cardigan,</HI> who with his boisterous arme endeauoured to crush him against his brestplate, in the middest of his action, for want of bloud to maintaine his vigour, fallen downe to the grounde for faintnesse: and yet in his fall with his huge body hee so ouerwhelmed him, as <HI>Oceander</HI> for a great while, was not able to recouer himselfe from his furie, and heauie ouerpoise: but hauing at last after much struggling, safely freed himselfe and remounted vpon his feete, he drew out <HI>Cardigans</HI> mighty and broad fauchon; wherewith smi∣ting off his other arme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardigans o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her arme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mitten off, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anquished.</NOTE> he left the vgly gyant in a pitti∣full pickle, to expect his wretched liues approaching pe∣riod.</P>
<P>And then turning himselfe towards the Chariot, hee vn∣bound the enthralled knight with the golden shield,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hianora res∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ued by Oce∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder.</NOTE> who in this sort rendered him thanks for his liberty: Noble and couragious knight, whomsoeuer thou art; the Gods, whome thou adorest, send thee as great good fortune, as thou deser∣uest fauour at my hands for this thy shewed friendshippe in

Herewith the Knight with the goulden shield offered to kisse his gauntlet. But <HI>O∣ceander,</HI> in whose hart meekenesse and courtesie sate royal∣ly enthronized) toke him gently by the hand, and in this ma∣ner made refusall of the proffered fauour: what I haue effec∣ted for thy freedome (Knight of the golden shield) was by the fauour of the Gods, and as I was obliged by the noble order of my Knighthood: and therefore requireth no thankes, at your hands; since what I did, was not at your request, but for the performance of my duetie: wherein I hope I haue ho∣nourably accōplished the part of a worthy champion, by free∣ing the oppressed, and giuing a bridle vnto haire-brainde presumption: desist therefore from such vnmerited requitall, and let vs both reioyce for the fruition of our happy cōquest. Now because that by this time, it grewe toward the appro∣ching of the euening, they left the Gyant to his griefes, &amp; tooke their wayes towarde the sea side where, in <HI>Cardigans</HI> argosie, they determined for that night to take vp their lod∣gings.

Wherunto the Knight of y<SUP>e</SUP> goldē shield condescending, and with a religious oath confirming, the insidious wretch, after some faigned teares, forceably wrūg out from her hollow eye-lids, in this sort began to taske her champion to his promises performance: Knowe then, most worthy Prince, that it was yonder Knight of the Sea, that hath so villanously outraged me, raced my castle, slain my subiects, and (obdurate to my intreaties) carried awaye my kinsmen, captiue prisoners: chastice him therefore accor∣ding to his deserts, and euermore be renowned by being my couragious champion. <HI>Oceander</HI> very well knowing her, &amp; hearing how shamefully she had before his face belied him, could not for his bloud refraine; but with his sword drawne he must needes proffer to loppe of her accursed head from her withered shoulders: whereof, the vnsuspecting Knight of the goulden shield, taking aduantage; nay, nay (sayd he) thou hast too too much already manifested thy malice against her: prepare thy selfe therefore to receiue thy iust deseruinges at his hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The knight of the golden shield comba¦teth Ocean∣der.</NOTE> who is sorie so soone to bee thy correctour: And therwith, she strake <HI>Oceander</HI> a sound buffet on the cuirace: wherewith he was so enangred, as leauing of excuses, hee soone requited the Knight with the goulden shield for his la∣bour.

Thinke not, most vile and wicked traytors, by this your sodaine taking flight, to passe thoroughly vnpunished for the cruell murther of our deare father the mighty <HI>Cardigā;</HI> whose princely blood, shed cowardly by your peasant blades, presents a sorrowfull re∣membraunce of wrathfull vengeance to be wreaked on your carrion carcasses.

Therewith they both met together so fiercely, as breaking their pinetree speares a∣gainst their pouldrōs, they were both sent headlōg frō their horsebackes, to finish the rest of their Monimachy on foote,
<PB N="129" REF="69"/> who nimbly recouering themselues from the fall, presently drewe out their steele-heawing weapons; and so stoutly be∣labred one another about the crestes, as it might well haue made them dissy: for their intollerable stroakes, made the o∣ther foure behoulders, very exceedingly amazed: <HI>Briarostez</HI> with his broad fawchon <HI>Cordelue,</HI> sent such a strong blowe on the shield of <HI>Norin,</HI> as nigh therewith he parted it in two peeces; and then slyding betweene the breast-plate and the arme-hole, it straight descended vnto the grounde; where doing no other harme it stayde: but so was it stricken into y<SUP>e</SUP> muddy substance, as before <HI>Briarostez</HI> could thoroughly vn∣loosen it, <HI>Norin</HI> flourishing his battleaxe with a stronge whirle about his heade, stroke <HI>Briarostez</HI> such a sound buffet ouerthwart his shoulders, as with the furie thereof, he was forced to stagger backwarde, at least three yardes from the place where he first stood. But, as hap would, in his retyring he gaue such a twitch at the hilt of his sword <HI>Cordelue,</HI> as he vnburyed it from the bowels of the earth, wherein it was so fast enclosed.

<P><Q>What? haue I dreamed that I haue seene, or doe I nowe dreame that I doe perspect these straunge accidents? haue I beene mocked with illusions? or are my senses enchaunted; that I nowe doe what I knowe not of, and remember what I haue but as yet surmised.

<P>¶ How <HI>Phianora</HI> arriued at the cittie of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where she founde the Emperour <HI>Claranax</HI> his court in exceeding sadnesse, how she proclaimed a Iust for the pretious man∣tle of <HI>Mardegua,</HI> her cōquest ouer many Knightes, &amp; com∣bate with the Knight of the Sea.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Hianora</HI> in such sort (as you hearde) beeing departed in the wherrie of the Inchauntresse wicked <HI>Mardigua,</HI> from the shoares of <HI>Afri∣ca,</HI> as ashamed of her disclosure of <HI>Ocean∣der,</HI> in all hast shaped forth her iourney to
<PB N="142" REF="76"/> the coastes of <HI>Grecia,</HI> when surging within a short while be∣fore the hauens mouth of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> they perceiued there neyther ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phianora ar∣riueth at Cō∣stantinople.</NOTE> nor men of any reckoning; but only a few fisher-boates for to apport there. Which solitary spectacle so amated the young Princesse, as for very griefe to see so fa∣mous an harbour, so little frequented now, which in times past, yea euen within her owne fathers memorie, had been the onely receptacle for all, both heathen and christian na∣tions; y<SUP>e</SUP> teares trickled downe so abundātly, by her cheeks, as for very pitie therof the (though otherwise pittilesse) In∣chauntresse, could not chuse but comfort her vp with these kinde speeches;</P>
<P>Perplex not thy selfe in this sort (deare daughter) with the sodain sorrow conceiued for so strange an alteration. For of this I shall assure thée, that yer I (as ould as I am) should die, <HI>Phianora</HI> shal see the court of <HI>Constātinople</HI> far more fa∣mous and frequented, then hitherto any enrowled recorde hath left in notice. With these wordes the Princesse was somewhat comforted: and taking heart of grace, as hoping for better fortune to befall so faire a cittie, she entreated the witch to put to land: which <HI>Mardigua</HI> performing, they both togither passed vp vnto the Emperour <HI>Claranax</HI> his palace: where they found the hall, parlour, and galleries, hung all with sable hanginges;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grecian court, in a dead quiet∣nesse.</NOTE> the Knights and Ladies, attendāts, cloathed in mourning vestures; bearing in their lookes the signes of sorrow, and breathing frō their hearts centre me∣teorized sighes, multiplied by the continuall commemora∣tions of their misfortunes: at the vpper end of the galleries, the liuely images of the Emperour <HI>Claranax</HI> and the Em∣presse <HI>Basilia</HI> were engraued in alablaster in full proportiōs, hanging their heades in their bosomes, and with their na∣ked hands instead of a Mounde, vphoulding a deathes head: whereupon in latine characters was written; <HI>NOSTRAE SPES TANTA SALVTIS.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This is our onely hope of safety.</NOTE></P>
<P>At this sad sight, <HI>Phianora</HI> was exceedingly mooued to compassionate sorrowe, insomuch as shee could not refraine from kissing the hands of the stony pictures; saying, ha, my royall friends, how greatly is fortune to blame for affrēting
<PB N="143" REF="76"/> you in such cruell manner! Once before haue I vowed, and heare againe doe I auouch, an eternall enquest after your most distressed children, for whose losse you thus languish, &amp; for whose mischaunces you are growen thus miserable: w<SUP>t</SUP> these speeches she effused her sorrowes: which were no sooner ending, but that the Emperour and the Empresse <HI>Basilia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe∣ror &amp; the em∣presse mourn for the losse of their chil∣dren.</NOTE> all attired in a sad suite of blacke veluet, entered into the gal∣lerie, with such cast downe countenances, as (respecting on∣ly their sad entercoursings) they neuer so much as regarded the two straungers <HI>Phianora</HI> &amp; <HI>Mardigua;</HI> vntill they so nigh approached them; as <HI>Phianora,</HI> doing her dutie, in this ma∣ner raysed the Emperour from his melancholy; <Q>Mighty Emperour, and my dreade soueraigne Queene <HI>Basilia,</HI> the gracious god of heauē,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phianoras salute vn∣to them▪</NOTE> for the loue of his deare sonne Iesus Christ, comfort vp your disconsolate thoughtes; and of his mercy, free you from your long-endured miserie: by y<SUP>e</SUP> hap∣pie resending of your haplesse children.</Q> The Emperour hea∣ring this salutation, could not but in courtesie regreet the straunger: and therefore kindly embracing <HI>Phianora</HI> about the gorget, with his eyes full of brinish teares, <Q>Knight of y<SUP>e</SUP> goulden shield (quoth he) how much I am endebted vnto thee for thy continuall deprecations to the highest, for my happi∣nesse, I am not able to explaine: onely with thankes I must needes expresse the great good will that I beare vnto thee, whose demerits haue more then firmely obliged mee, in an vndissolvable bonde of eternall amitie.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ha, my good Lord (answered <HI>Phianora</HI>) I thanke your Maiestie that you doe so graciously accept of my poore and humble seruice: which since with such loue it is recompēced, I protest before the almightie, neuer to slacke, vntill by Gods gracious helpe, I shall regaine your, almost irrepai∣rable and vnhopeable comfort; that once againe I may with ioye behould the Court of <HI>Grecia</HI> to bee repleni∣shed with as many valiaunt and vndaunted Champions, as euer hitherto, you may remember it.

With which sight not onely y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperour, Empresse, &amp; the Knight of the goulden shield, but also <HI>Mardegua</HI> (as she whose cun∣ning inuention had conspired some worthy knights destruc∣tion) greatly reioyced: insomuch as now w<SUP>t</SUP> great preparatiō they stayed for the day of pleasure prefixed. Which being ap∣proached, they no sooner espyed the morninges mistresse, with disheueled tressalines to mount her iuorie charriot, but they endossed on their armours; and on their foming cour∣sers, they praunced vp and downe before the Listes, away∣ting the arriuall of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Challengers: who by reasō that that morning y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperor found himselfe somewhat ill at ease; and also the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> by reason of his late long iourney, was faint and weary, as yet had no leasure to come. And in the meane time, the alyen Knightes doing their deuoyres, spent the whole fore-noone in Iusting:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iusting amōg the stranger Knights.</NOTE> which was very valiauntly performed, to the foyle of many good Knights, and the brasting of many stronge launces. At the end whereof, a lustie knight attendant of <HI>Xanzimar</HI> (for hee scorned to iuste with the basest himselfe) named <HI>Martio,</HI> re∣mained with the honour of the field; hauing since his first encountring, ouerthrowne sixteene <HI>Transiluanian</HI> knights to the grounde: from whome (though against the lawe) hee tooke away both horse and harnesse.</P>
<P>After dinner was ended in the Emperours palace, the day grewe so serene and pleasant by reason of the bright
<PB N="146" REF="78"/> ascent of the dayes illustratour, into the top-front of the Zodiacke; as the Emperour <HI>Claranax</HI> his feeble minde was exceedingly refreshed: and therefore taking the oulde King <HI>Fiardon,</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI> (to whose cheekes also the estiue heate hadde added a crimoson blush) by the age-wrinkled handes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claranax &amp; Fiardon goe to behold the Iourney.</NOTE> hee chearefully sayde; Brother of <HI>Bo∣hemia</HI> though euen nowe fainte sicknesse made vs giue small respect vnto our Princely pastimes: yet nowe a∣gaine, the faire sunshine inuiteth vs to the conspecting of our royall feates of late-renewed Knight-hoode. From the viewe whereof I protest I would not bee any longer absent, for twice the price of the inestimable Mantle of <HI>Mardegua;</HI> such heroicke encouragement, I knowe, my presence will infuse into the vndaunted heartes of my <HI>Grecian</HI> Companions. Accompany me therefore deare friend O couzen <HI>Fyardon,</HI> with a merrie countenance, vnto the behoulding of our prepared Iustes: which one∣ly to relieue the drooping sadnesse of sorrowfull Gree∣kish soules, was purposely proclaimed, by the worthy Knight of the goulden shield: whose exquisite a bearing against these repaired forrainers, shall winne him the de∣serued name of the flower of Chiualrie. In this sort the good Emperour inuited the ould <HI>Bohemian</HI> King, to the behoulding of the Iusts: who gladly graunting his high∣nesse request, staying his feeble ioyntes with an Iuorie staffe, presently departed with him vnto the great To∣wers of the Cittie gate; which hadde beene in former times erected to the same intent and purpose: to the top whereof ascending, they might at ease ouer-view y<SUP>e</SUP> whole circuite of the newe-suburbized pauilions: which being of sundrye Nations, and therefore of diuers fashions, drew great delight vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> hearts of the great Potentates, who now had fresh occasion of calling to minde their won∣ted such like pleasures.</P>

<P>The Emperour and Empresse being placed, there en∣tred vppe into a high scaffold, for Iudges of the fielde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudges of the fielde.</NOTE> foure verie auntient Knightes of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> named <HI>Sornio, Florido, Sanio,</HI> and <HI>Sigando:</HI> who commaunding the trumpets to bee sounded, gaue licence to the knights that would, to doe their deuoires. Then entred there into the Lists, three <HI>Grecian</HI> Knightes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grecian knights, vn∣horsed by Martio, Ipe∣rom, and Pe∣ronu.</NOTE> with their launces in their reastes; who were encountred and vnhorsed by <HI>Martio,</HI> and two other sturdie Pagans, <HI>Iperom,</HI> and <HI>Perronu:</HI> who abore themselues so valiauntly against the <HI>Greekes,</HI> as in lesse then a quarter of an hower, they vanquished a dozen worthy <HI>Constantinopolitans,</HI> approo∣ued Knightes. Whereat the Emperour looked verye sad, saying; I pray God wee haue a better ending then we haue had a beginning: or else shame and woe to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Knight-hoode.</P>
<P>Herewith hee turned about to the King <HI>Rubaldo,</HI> with intente to require his helpe towardes the recouerie of his <HI>Grecian</HI> credite. But yer hee coulde vtter his minde, hee was recalled to the battlementes, by the ould King, of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> who shewed him him three exquisite young Knightes all in white armour (who by their hero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>call demeanours gaue perfect notyce of their wonderfull va∣lour) whome when the Emperour sawe, he highly com∣mended their couragious carriages; and therefore earnestly

Neuerthelesse so exceeding couragious was the resistaunce of the valiaunt Knights, as in spight of his heart he was sometimes enforced to confesse his foolish hardinesse, in attempting so daungerous a conquest.</P>
<P>But, now too late hee stoode to repent him: and there∣fore, seeing howe it stoode vppon his safetie to ridde him speedily from two such fierce enemies, hee raysed hym∣selfe vpright in his stirrops, and (casting his crooked shield behinde him) with his sworde in both his handes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tholōs arme disiointed frō his shoulder.</NOTE> hee strake such a resistlesse blowe on the shield-arme of <HI>Tho∣lon,</HI> as disiointing it from the shoulder, hee made him for safetie of his life to turne his horse heade, and flie amaine for some succour to the Surgeons of the Empe∣rour.

For shee knowing the great loue that <HI>Olbiocles</HI> did beare his worthy deliuerer, had by her cunning framed that monstrous billow, to seeme to ouerswallowe the enchaunted wherry-boate; to the end
<PB N="150" REF="80"/> that thereby she might perplex the friendly thoughts of the worthy <HI>Greeke;</HI> who shee knewe would extreamely bewaile the death of so good a Champion.

For, ētring into his bootes of maile, it sliced away, at least an handfull of the calfe of his legge: which not smally grieued the huge monster; so as betaking him againe vnto his clubbe, hee pursued <HI>Phianora</HI> so hoate∣ly, as driuing her into a narrowe corner betweene two conioyning pillers, he put her to her trumpes. And euen there had shee acted an vntimely tragedie, had it not been for y<SUP>e</SUP> approued goodnesse of her golden shield: w<SUP>t</SUP> which, as vnder a canopie, ouercouering her helmet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phianora dri∣uen to a de∣ceitfull e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣gent.</NOTE> shee pretily preserued her selfe from wounding; though her crest of her

Wherwith he was so agrieued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olbiocles closeth with Ortolomor∣gantell.</NOTE> as no∣thing respecting the greatnesse of the daunger, hee ran and closed within him, thinking by wrastling to haue withstood his enterprise. But alas, his armes and legges are so weake and wearie, as hee was not able to grapple and keepe his ground, at one time. Which <HI>Ortolomorgātell</HI> perceiuing he cast the worthy <HI>Greciā,</HI> with great impatiencie, to the earth: and setting his foote vpon him, hee there kept him downe; vntill hauing dragged the body of the English princesse, crosse ouer his breast, hee tooke vp his heauie club, and breathing out most beastly blasphemies against the sauiour of all Christian soules, he menaced the heauēs in his haugh∣tinesse, &amp; lifting vp his wicked weapon with both his hands aboue his temples, hee now menaced e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernall night to the trembling Princes. But <HI>Oceander</HI> grieuing to behould her whom hee best loued, the fairest of all faires, faire <HI>Phiano∣ra,</HI> sorrowfully ouer-canopyed with such imminent crueltie (stepping betweene the Gyant and the Knightes) in the de∣clining of the dreadfull blowe, hee encountered the Gyants

<P>Glorious in thy conquestes, and gracious in thy mercies, (most illustrious knight of <HI>Carthage</HI>) alas poore sielie crea∣tures as we are, how shal we be able, euer to requite thy ma∣nifold deseruings? which are so infinite, as our tongues are vnable to tell: much lesse, our thankes for to regratifie.

Vn∣derstand you therefore, my Lordes, that not onely euer since our arriuall, but euen at this instant, our armie hath been, and is so pestered with pernitious traytours and conspiratours; as neuer a day, nor houre, nay nor scarcely at this present, our friends and loyall followers can rest free from their disturbances: whose hearts are still concei∣ting, whose heads euer complotting, and whose handes are ready to the accōplishing of all wickednesse and treasonous insidies, that can possibly be plotted or performed.</P>
<P>Such conspiracies were contriued by <HI>Cascar</HI> and <HI>Om∣bator</HI> against the holy <HI>Alcheron</HI> of <HI>Mahomet:</HI> and such was the blasphemie of <HI>Blandulon</HI> against his deitie.

<P>Though the Knight of the Sea were gauled euen to the quicke, w<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Ebators</HI> spitefull quirke; yet seing neyther the time, nor place to bee fitte for reuenge, he wisely re∣tained his anger: and, with the subtle Serpent <HI>Echid∣non,</HI> ceased hissing vntill some better season, wherein he might safely hitte the <HI>Moroccane</HI> home, with a full re∣quitall. But in the meane while, defiance beeing de∣nounced against each other; aswell the Pagans as the christians drewe forth their forces into the middest of the plaine, before <HI>Constantinople:</HI> whose walles and warlike battlementes being emburdened with a multi∣tude of beawtious Ladies, set on the same so faire an embellishment; as hadde the Sunne shone neuer so

<P>Wherfore, by the commaundements of the gouernours on both sides, y<SUP>e</SUP> dreadfull signall to y<SUP>e</SUP> fight being sounded, there no sooner approached the King of <HI>Tangur</HI> with his <HI>Fessians</HI> from the armie of the Pagans; but that Prince <HI>Morcauill,</HI> with his <HI>Hungarian</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The battels of Fessians &amp; Hungari∣ans affront.</NOTE> horsemen, pressed furiously against thē. Betweene whom there was so strong an encounter as king <HI>Tangur,</HI> breaking his launce vppon the gorget of the young <HI>Hungarian,</HI> was quite vnhorsed, &amp; fifteen of his best knights at the same time in the like sort serued. Where they had en∣ded their liues, had not a fresh band of <HI>Barbarians</HI> bosterous∣ly buskled in amongst them; &amp; ouerthrowing a great num∣ber of christians, made the residue to retire thēselues, vntil the King of <HI>Tangur</HI> was rehorsed. Who no sooner found him∣selfe repossessed of his his saddle, but that setting spurs to his palfrey (like an angrie Lyon) he lashed with such fierce∣nesse into the thick troope of his enemies, as the prince <HI>Mor∣cauill</HI> being vnable to withstand his force, by little &amp; little he retreated from the Pagans furie. Which his deare friend <HI>Arcanio</HI> perceiuing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A supply of Bohemians.</NOTE> he called amaine to his <HI>Bohemiā</HI> Mar∣tialists; and putting his strong speare made of knotty Cor∣nel, in his rest, he ran so swiftly against a prue pagan knight named <HI>Rodorin</HI> (who was one of the K. of <HI>Tangurs</HI> gard) as, bearing him quite ouer his saddle, he made him to take a new and more vneasie seate on the crooper of his palfrey. Whom leauing to his shame, with the same speare he bare to ground seauen other sturdie Pagans, before his arme or aime failed. In which his enterprise he was so brauely seconded, by his battaglion of <HI>Bulgarians;</HI> as in spight of the king of <HI>Tan∣gur,</HI> they not onely wan grounde of his <HI>Barbarians,</HI> but in a moment made them, maugre the might of their commaū∣der, to betake themselues vnto most fearefull flight.</P>
<P>At which their cowardise, the Knight of the Sea was
<PB N="209" REF="111"/> so exceedingly enraged, as for very wrath, hee waxed so wood as vnneath any Sarrasen was able to behould him: vntill, taking <HI>Xamaru</HI> and <HI>Brammadon</HI> by the gauntlets; How long (sayde hee) shall our generous hearts trust our honours, in the handes of these heartlesse souldi∣ers? Vntill our christian enemie shall ioyfully tryumph, in our ouerthrowe? Our holy <HI>Mahomet</HI> fore-fend it: and then in what I can, I shall defend it. For rather had I die, then suffer our selues to be thus cowardly sacrificed vnto all misfortune by these vnbelieuing christians.</P>
<P>Ending these wordes, he caused <HI>Brammadon</HI> and his bro∣ther to followe him▪ who, with his launce in his rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceander Brammadon and Xamaru enter the battaile.</NOTE> and his shield on his shoulder, leauelled so stronge a stroake against the helmet of <HI>Arcanio,</HI> as beating him quite from his horse, he left him to seeke for succour, amonge a number more of <HI>Bulgarian</HI> knightes, whome his fellowes sent downe head∣long to associate him. Whereat the good Prince of <HI>Hunga∣rie</HI> waxed so wroth, as with a hundred of his best and coura∣giousest warriours, he presently encompassed the three Pa∣gan knights within their armed angle: &amp; in such sort beha∣ued themselues against them, as though <HI>Oceander</HI> was most excellently armed, and of a most inuincible courage; yet had he much adoe to match so many worthy Martialists. Whom though many times he exceedingly endammaged, hurt, and beate off from their horses, yet he could not so quietly rid his hands of them, as he should (w<SUP>t</SUP>out some sound knocks) scape scotfree from their furies: especially Prince <HI>Morcauill,</HI> who three times though he were felled to his horse mane; yet so many times he reuiued: and recouering his vigour, seald such sorrowfull quittances on the helmets of his aduersaries, as hee made them in an ertasie, to decline their heades, and leaning on their palfreyes creastes, quite forget to execute their entended enterprise. But in vaine it is to contend with ones stronger: a mightier manageth armes against <HI>Morcauill:</HI> and therefore no meruaile, though any longer he cannot withstand his furious &amp; waighty blowes: which, in such irresistable sort, and vnceasing maner, lashed against his burgonet; as the buckles being broken, and the armour
<PB N="210" REF="112"/> brast in peeces, he was forced for want of defence, to loose some of the best bloud in his bodie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Morcauill flieth.</NOTE> and by swiftnesse of his horse speedily to escape frō the furie of his vnmatchable ad∣uersarie <HI>Oceander:</HI> who, with his good sword <HI>Scindifer,</HI> did cut such broad lanes crosse the battaglion of <HI>Bulgarians,</HI> as there was not any one that durst once so much as oppose him selfe against him: so like a neuer-matchable Martialist, or rather <HI>Mars</HI> himselfe, he behaued himselfe amongst the ama∣zed christians. Who had presently beene foyled, had not the stronge King of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> with the Princes <HI>Kauis∣kon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The battaile of Huns, Thessalians, and Transil∣uanians set forward.</NOTE> and <HI>Curan,</HI> with their vnbroken bandes of <HI>Rutters, Thessalians,</HI> and <HI>Transiluanians,</HI> incontinently come to their rescue. At whose angrie assault the battaile began, once more, to be so fortunate vnto the christians; as the knight of the sea was on a sodaine beaten backe; &amp; his, &amp; <HI>Brammadons</HI> horses slaine vnder them; &amp; <HI>Xamaru,</HI> with the scattered legiō of Sarasens, enforced violently, to betake themselues, by little and little to the retreat. Whom the King <HI>Rubaldo</HI> pursued so couragiously, as the whole cōpany of christiās (as∣well within, as without the cittie of <HI>Constantinople</HI>) clapped their hands, &amp; shouted for ioy; praysing god for giuing them such good prosperitie, and almost an assured victorie ouer all their misbelieuing enemies: whome at that time they had vtterly vanquished, or at least exceedingly foyled; had they not for greedinesse of getting the conquest, dis∣arraunged themselues, and run headlong after their ene∣mies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Through dis∣order of the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istians, they lose ad∣uantage o∣uer their eni∣mies, and fall into disad∣uantage thē∣selues.</NOTE> Which, y<SUP>e</SUP> couragious and wise leader of the discom∣forted Sarasens, no sooner aduised, but he presently tooke thereby occasion of aduantage. For, horsing himselfe againe by pure force, on the palfrey of a sturdy Knight of <HI>Thessa∣ly,</HI> named <HI>Radoron</HI> (whome at one blowe hee seuered to the breastbone) hee spurred speedily into the middest of his daunted souldiers; and there strongly brandishing his courtleaxe, with a loude voice and a commaunding ac∣tion, hee stoutly recalled his slying fellowes, saying; For shame, for shame (my worthy countrie men) flie not so fearefully before your following enemies: but, remem∣bring the iustice of your quarrell, and for what cause
<PB N="211" REF="112"/> yee vndertooke this enterprise (<HI>viz,</HI> for the death of <HI>Tabar∣can Tumanto,</HI> and the exalting of the holy <HI>Alcheron</HI>) cheare vp your disconsolated courages; and turning your faces to∣wards them, like a streame dammed vp, make your recoy∣ling be the recouering of more furie; and on the sodaine with farre greater violence breake out vpon their resisting troopes; and by the resistlesse vigour of your armes, make them to breake now, who earst made you to bend: or, refusing to performe it, prepare your selues to receiue the guerdon of your cowardize, at the hands of him, who esteemes his life lesse, then the losse of so assured and glorious a vic∣tory.</P>
<P>These wrathful words, were so excellently graced w<SUP>t</SUP> ire∣full actions, as his Pagan souldiers, partly for shame, partly for feare, were incontinently enforced to follow him. Wher∣vpon, ioyning himselfe with <HI>Xamaru, Tribarte, Vibrante,</HI> and <HI>Cammatu,</HI> he thundred in, with such furie amongst the dis∣arayed troopes of the suspectlesse Christians; as at the first brunt, there were ouerthrowne, to the very ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Transil∣uanians and Thessalians re∣coyle.</NOTE> thirty of the most approued <HI>Transiluanians,</HI> and <HI>Thessalians;</HI> and the valourous Princes <HI>Curan</HI> and <HI>Cauiskon,</HI> both at once, enfor∣sed to loose their stirrops, and embrace their horses neckes, to saue themselues from falling.</P>
<P>The dismayed Christians, with wonder, made way for the Paganne Champions: who neuer rested, vntill such time, as they approached vnto the strong garrison of <HI>Bulgarians;</HI> who, had all this while encompassed in the braue knight <HI>Bram∣madon;</HI> though in vaine: who had so couragiously main∣tained the combat against them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bulgari∣ans giue back</NOTE> as eleauen of their fel∣lowes being slaine, the rest stoode a loofe off, without once daring to approach him. Whereof the good king <HI>Rubaldo</HI> being aduertised, he presently poasted vnto the Paganne, &amp; with him hand to hand, entred to sore a combat; as, had they not beene both of the most approued Knights in the whole armie, the battel had in a moment on one or other side beene finished. But, ha good good, that <HI>Rubaldo</HI> was so farre in yeares; for had he beene in his prime, two <HI>Brammadons</HI> could scarcely haue matcht him. Neuerthelesse, he so brauely
<PB N="212" REF="113"/> behaued himselfe against the <HI>Barbariā;</HI> as, despoyling him of certaine parcels of his empaired armour, he had in a short space put him to the worst; had not the Knight of the Sea and the whole knighthood of <HI>Morocco</HI> (seconded with fortie thousand <HI>Tabarcan</HI> souldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A supply of Tabarcans.</NOTE> brought freshly in, vnder the conduct of the <HI>Arabian Argostas</HI>) set so fiercely vppon the garrison of <HI>Hungaria;</HI> as making a bloody lane quite tho∣rough them, they presently parted the combate: &amp; hauing (though not verie easilie) taken <HI>Rubaldo</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rubaldo ta∣ken prisoner.</NOTE> prisoner, sent him pinioned backe vnto their pauilions, by a stronge bande of <HI>Sarasens,</HI> and <HI>Brammadon;</HI> whilest they hotly pursued after the discomfited <HI>Hungarians:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hunga∣rians discō∣forted.</NOTE> who, like sheepe before the wolues, fled fearefully from the furie of their mercilesse pursuers. Who followed thē so fiercely, as, before they could gaine the gates of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> there fell three thousand christians, vnder the slaughtering swordes of the mercilesse miscreants: against whose endeauours the Lord of his mer∣cie oppose his power; or else the perill of all christendome is perpetrated in their proceedings. Which brought extream sorrowe to the verie soules of the controwled souldiers: who entred the gates of the Cittie with such sad gestures, and heauie countenances, as if the destruction of <HI>Phrygian Troy</HI> had been counterenacted by the woefull <HI>Grecians.</HI> For, some came in with their armes off, other with their helmets cleft, and more with their bodies wounded: all hanging downe their heads, and houlding downe the points of their weapons, and trayling their pikes and launces by the club endes on the ground, in such sorrowfull sort; as who hadde seene them, and would not pittie their perplexities,

<PB N="213" REF="113"/> <HI>Transiluanians:</HI> who brought such a sorrowful relation of the conflict, as there was neuer the like terrour within the ama∣zed hearts of the wofull <HI>Constantinopolitans,</HI> before. But, oh; when the Emperour <HI>Claranax,</HI> the Empresse, and all the rest of that worthy rout, heard the taking of <HI>Rubaldo</HI> prisoner, and the death of <HI>Kauiscon</HI> related; with what an irefull gea∣sture did they teare their tresses, beate their breastes, and bewaile their miseries! But in especial, the Queene <HI>Anaxia</HI> so extreamely bewailed the captiuitie of her deare husband, as, for agony of heart, shee fell into such an hot burning a∣gue, as shee neuer while she liued, recouered perfectly ther∣of againe. And surely at that instant, shee had yielded vp her weary life, had she not beene the better comforted vp, by the sage councellings of the Princesses <HI>Almidiana</HI> and <HI>Eristama;</HI> who had (as you haue heard) proued by experience, that the only remedy in aduersity was patience. If these were woful, how wroth on the other side was the good Prince <HI>Olbiocles?</HI> who was angry at nothing so much, as y<SUP>t</SUP> he was so shrewdly taken downe by a feauer; as, like another <HI>Hector,</HI> he coulde not patronize the notable performances of his country men; whose body should haue beene the buckler to his Christian followers. Wherefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olbiocles im∣patient for his extreame weaknesse.</NOTE> hee smote himselfe sorely on the sto∣mach, and beating his head against the boulster, hee continu∣ed for a while almost in a franticke passion. Vnhappy wretch (quoth hee) and most accursed caytife that thou art; why was I borne to see the ruine of my Country and Religion, and not be able in such extreames to succour them? If so, I would I had neuer rather receiued life, then thus haue li∣ued to behould such irrepairable misfortunes. And there∣withall hee sodainely threwe the sheetes ouer his face, as if hee had beene ashamed of what could not be salued. For, by the prouidence of the Highest he was preuēted in his prince∣ly purpose; least by couragiously defending himselfe, hee might haue more offended himselfe, then by mans forepro∣uidence could be perceiued. For, had he and the knight of y<SUP>e</SUP> sea, once entered the combat; who knoweth not, y<SUP>t</SUP> their vn∣daunted courages would haue brought one of their confusi∣ons? whose neare affinitie being once known to the relieuer;
<PB N="214" REF="114"/> who then would bee more sorrowfull then the vanquisher? and more care oppressed, then the conquerour? But to re∣turne, together with the day; that daies destruction of the poore Christians being ended, the knight of the Sea cau∣sed the retreate to bee sounded: whereupon, all of them retyred to their tents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Retreat soūd∣ed by the Pa∣gās.</NOTE> Where, how gratiously each couragi∣ous souldier was guerdoned for his valiancie, and what wonderfull reioycing there was generally through the whole Campe of Pagans, I take it to bee both tedious for the reading, and superfluous for the relating: and ther∣fore, I will backe addresse mee to the brused bands of sor∣rowfull and disconsolate Christians. Whose hearts as they were full of sorrow for their recoyle, so were they hopeful of wreaking a ful reuenge on their inhumane and diuelish ene∣mies.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">Z</SEG>ABIER,</HI> the good ould Duke of <HI>Alca∣azar,</HI> though hee well had proued by ex∣perience, that haste bringeth wast; yet he determined willingly not to affront ey∣ther <HI>Brammadon,</HI> or any of the others, in their resolues. Neuerthelesse, as one somwhat displeased, that y<SUP>e</SUP> whole coun∣sell had so rashly consented vnto the youthfull vnaduised deuise of <HI>Brammadon;</HI> as to surmise the sodaine surprise of <HI>Constantinople</HI> (wherein the better part of the powerfull prowesse of Christendome was strongly engarrisonned: he
<PB N="218" REF="116"/> turned to the one side, as a male content, from the company of such young Counsellers: and leaning his arme vpon his helmet, he there rested in a melancholie dumpe; vntill, se∣ing both the kings, <HI>Tomarin</HI> and <HI>Tangut,</HI> with silence to expect his verdicte (as one whome they knewe most prudent) w<SUP>t</SUP> his snow-white hand, smoothing downe his whiter beard, he grauely endeauoured in this sort better to aduise them; </P>
<Q><P>It is not vnknowne vnto ye (my noble Lords) how at that time the Emperour <HI>Claranax,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zabiers sage coun∣sell vnto the Pagan Princes.</NOTE> with his millions of manful Chri∣stians, embattelled himselfe against the armed bands of <HI>Tu∣nis,</HI> I bouldly met him in the face, &amp; not only cōbatted him, but woūded him in the head very sorely: yet I but little pre∣uailed: for I scaped not scarrelesse (I assure ye) in my enter∣prise. Also at the battels of <HI>Tangur</HI> and <HI>Tabarca,</HI> I bouldly bad him battell, and hand to hand three times in one after∣noone affronted him; but to no purpose. For by my vnaduised rashnesse, I stil lost more then I gained, &amp; went away w<SUP>t</SUP> the disaduantage; yea, euen when I had my enemies at most aduantage.</P>
<P>The Christian Emperour <HI>Claranax</HI> (my worthy Countri∣men) is not only warlike, but wary, wise and wily: &amp; is not therefore to be dealt withall so rashly and headily, as any of our neighbouring nations, in <HI>Barbarie, Lidia,</HI> or the rude <HI>A∣rabians,</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> foster themselues in the desert wildernesses, by base pillage &amp; petty pilfry; whom in a moment, w<SUP>t</SUP> a band of Laū∣ciers, or at the most w<SUP>t</SUP> a small army, ye may presently put ei∣ther to the flight or the foile. But, this nation w<SUP>t</SUP> whom wee now contend, are Christians: whose forces wee haue (to our costs) so throughly felt, as they seeme in armes, rather to bee like those valiant <HI>Heroes</HI> their auncestours (on whose helmet creasts, is engrauen <HI>Assured victory</HI>) then to haue fetched their pedigree from puling <HI>Paris,</HI> who more delighted in amours then in armours; as one who cared not for bloody <HI>Bellona,</HI> so he might enioy his harmelesse <HI>Helena,</HI> to dally with. These are no such simple soules (O ye worthy knights of <HI>Africa</HI>) &amp; therefore not to be dealt withall scarbugge-like, as young <HI>Brammadon</HI> would haue thē. For it is not one battels losse will ouercome them: but sundry slight skirmishes, y<SUP>t</SUP> must
<PB N="219" REF="116"/> first weaken them: for they are both prewe and pollitique,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the Lions skin will not serue, wee must piece it, with the soxes case.</NOTE> ha∣uing some of their knights in armes, whilest others be in am∣bush. And therfore, it is ill for vs, with the eagre mastiffe, to venture to far in pursuite after the subtill Panther; least, vn∣awares entangled within his renting pawes, we finde our selues subiect to ineuitable daunger, and destruction.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Oceander</HI> harkened most attentiuely to the briefe oration of the good ould Duke of <HI>Alcaazar;</HI> who had no sooner ended, but <Q>by y<SUP>e</SUP> holy <HI>Alcheron, Zabier</HI> (quoth he) thy counsell is both politicke and profitable: for hereby we may both weaken the <HI>Constantinopolitans,</HI> and yer long (<HI>Mahomet</HI> and his holie Angels fauouring vs) take them at such aduantage, as all the prisons in <HI>Greece</HI> may easily be filled with their captiue carcasses.</Q></P>
<P>Hereunto the whole counsell condescended: and thereu∣pon each one departed to his owne pauilion; except <HI>Tomarin, Tangut,</HI> the knight of y<SUP>e</SUP> Sea and <HI>Zabieir:</HI> who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pagan princes goe to view the city.</NOTE> with their pa∣ges &amp; six other attendāt knights, secretly stale out of y<SUP>e</SUP> campe, &amp; poasted to the city: which they saw so exceedingly wel wat∣ched &amp; warded w<SUP>t</SUP> bands of souldiers at that time, as they all wondered to see the Christians so vigilāt in their defēcings. Whereupon, <HI>Tomarin</HI> (quoth <HI>Tangut</HI>) I would to the Gods my men had bin Christians, on y<SUP>t</SUP> condition they would thus safely haue guarded themselues from their <HI>Grecian</HI> surprise∣ments. Wherat they al fetched a deepe sigh, &amp; speedily depar∣ted to their campe again. Where they were no sooner entred, but they might perceiue on their pauilions, the brightsome glimmering of the blushing morning, to bid good morrowe to those Martialistes, whose eyelids y<SUP>e</SUP> drowsie slumbers of y<SUP>e</SUP> former night had neuer closed. When, speedily &amp; prouidētly embattelling their souldiers, before it was fully daylight. <HI>Brammadon, Xamaru,</HI> &amp; <HI>Taliertez</HI> tooke their way, w<SUP>t</SUP> a strong battaglion of 3000. stout and valiant souldiers (as spéedily as they could) vnto a little nooke of y<SUP>e</SUP> forrest, adioyning w<SUP>t</SUP>in half a league of <HI>Cōstantinople.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An ambuscado of Pagans.</NOTE> Within whose bushy entrails they closely enambushed themselues; whilest y<SUP>e</SUP> knight of the Sea, <HI>Bamaru, Tomarin,</HI> &amp; a selected battaglion of <HI>Tunis</HI> marched celerously forward, to encoūter their Christiā enemies. Who
<PB N="220" REF="117"/> (vnder the generall conduction, of the wounded Prince of <HI>Hungary, Labasto</HI> of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and Prince <HI>Curan</HI> of <HI>Thessaly,</HI> with their eager bands of <HI>Huns, Moldauians, Bulgarians, Bo∣hemians, Budans, Transiluanians,</HI> &amp; angry <HI>Spartans</HI>) had war∣likely enraunged themselues in battell aray, against the ap∣proaching of their reproachfull aduersaries of <HI>Tunis</HI> and <HI>Tangur:</HI> whose hearts were enflamed with such an ardent de∣sire of reuenging their Religion, and the death of their slain friendes and brethren in the last daies conflicte; as like en∣raged Lions (running furiously to pray vpon an hearde of Neat, or Buffins) they marched fiercely against their Pa∣gan foes. When, with their Launces in their rests, each side charged the other so strongly, as at y<SUP>e</SUP> first encounter, sixteene of either part, were quight borne out of their saddles: amongst whom <HI>Curan</HI> and <HI>Tomarin</HI> accompanied their foyled fellow souldiers. But <HI>Tomarin</HI> in a moment receiued his horse a∣gaine, at the hands of <HI>Oceander:</HI> who with almost an hūdreth couragious knights, endeauoured w<SUP>t</SUP> all might and maine to repell the irresistable furie of the <HI>Spartans.</HI> Who (hauing hemmed in strongly on all sides, amongst them, <HI>Bamaru</HI> &amp; the knight of the sea, whom they most enuied) crying all aloud; The death of <HI>Ismerion</HI> of <HI>Sparta,</HI> shall this day be reuenged: w<SUP>t</SUP> one accord they lashed so furiously on y<SUP>e</SUP> misbeleeuing Sa∣rasens; as, though the knight of the sea wrought wonders, in wounding and killing them without ceasing; yet they so desperately pressed vpon him; as, had not <HI>Bramma∣don, Xamaru,</HI> and <HI>Taliartez</HI> discouered themselues the soo∣ner out of their ambushe<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ambushe breaketh out.</NOTE> (maugre his magicke armour) hee had been in a moment, either taken prisoner, or heawen into a thousand pieces: so exceeding dreadful were the angry for∣ces of the enraged knightes of <HI>Sparta,</HI> for the reuenge∣ment of the vntimely death of their young Prince <HI>Ismerion.</HI></P>
<P>In the meane time, <HI>Tomarin</HI> and <HI>Bamaru</HI> were neither idle nor knightly occupied: for with multitudes of pittilesse Pagans, they inuironed the good Prince <HI>Curan</HI> in such strong, &amp; straunge manner amongst them; as, being on foote, and the Sarazens all horsed, hee had much adoe, of a long while, to settle one sound blowe vpon any of his aduersaries:
<PB N="221" REF="117"/> vntill by the happy helpe of the young Prince <HI>Morcauill,</HI> his enemies thicke set troopes were forcibly broken: and foure of the mightiest Sarasens beeing quite vnhorsed, hee was speedily remounted on a stronge <HI>Barbarian</HI> palfrey, whose maisters head he payd for y<SUP>e</SUP> horse hire. When with his cour∣sers heeles making some rome amongst them, he smote a big knight named <HI>Tleas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tleas slain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> so smart a blowe ouer the left thigh, as cutting it quite from the loynes, hee made him quickly to leaue his saddle to the sauegard of some vnhorsed Christian. And therewithall, ioyning side to side with the Prince of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> they heawed such a lane, through y<SUP>e</SUP> thick troupes of the misbelieuing enemies, as within the space of a quar∣ter of an houre, they quite freede thēselues from the furies of the diuelish Pagans.</P>
<P>But alas, they could not long enioy such happily en∣franchised libertie.</P>
<P>For now approacheth the pitious period of all their ge∣nerous proceedings. <HI>Oceander</HI> is at hand (freede, &amp; hauing foyled and confounded his <HI>Spartan</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spartās foild.</NOTE> opponentes, slaine <HI>La∣bastoe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Labasto slaine.</NOTE> and slaughtered almost euery of his souldiers) with his faucheon <HI>Scindifer,</HI> reaking with luke-warme blood of new-slaine christians. Who brādishing it aboue his helme, lent such a right-downe blowe vppon the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Prin∣ces helmet; as, battering it into his braine-panne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Morcauill slaine by Oceander.</NOTE> hee sent him headlong vnto the colde earth. Whose yellowe dust (as pittying the innocent young Princes death) gathered into clottered balles, before the mouth of his bleeding wounde: which straungely seeking to stop, it neuer ceased till it selfe was drowned in the bloody gore of the slaine young Gen∣tleman. Whose executioner the God of heauen forgiue: for when hee strake the stroake, he knewe not that hee wrought the downefall of his dearest kinsman. At whose death, the Prince of <HI>Thessalie</HI> was so enflamed with desire of re∣uenge, as (not regarding the multitudes of his mischieuing enemies) he roughly rushed into the thickest squadrons of <HI>Barbarians:</HI> and with his trustie courtleaxe he layed so lusti∣ly about him, as he neuer lent blow that lighted in vaine; his brandished sword bringing assured death to his opponents:
<PB REF="118"/> so as, before he once so much as rested, hee brought eleuen of his resisting foes to ground; with his owne hands, still ma∣king an easie way, for his almost slaughtered souldiers, to follow him through. But what preuaile doughty deedes, against death? or a warlike Martialist against a more wor∣thy <HI>Mars? Oceāder,</HI> with a fatall furie, hath crossed him tho∣rough the troupes, and by the brandishing of his cutting courtleaxe, hath summoned his sweete soule to take flight from his earthely prison house. For, with such an irresistable furie the faucheon descended vppon <HI>Curans</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Curan it slaine.</NOTE> cuirace, as par∣ting it in peeces, it buried his cursed blade in the bowels of his christian stomacke: which, belching out his life togither with his bloud, bad a sorrowfull farewell to his more then sorrowfullest souldiers. Who like good subiects neuer ioy∣ed, vnreuenged to after-liue their slaughtered Soueraigne: but, desperately dispersing themselues amongst their ene∣mies, they ioyfully dyed, in effecting of their reuengefull re∣solutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thessalians slaughtered.</NOTE> after the slaughter of more then fourteene hun∣dreth stout <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>In this sort, from day to day, did the good fortune of the christians cōtinually decline; so as, the good old Emperour, perceiuing no happie helpe for his helplesse hap, remained in a most melācholy pensiuenesse, as one who had lost himselfe in some desert wildernesse; where, not hauing what to re∣lieue him he determineth to banish his breath from his body by dolefull dumpishnesse: such and so sorrowfull was the good Emperour, for the emprisement of <HI>Rubaldo,</HI> death of prince <HI>Morcauil,</HI> losse of his friends, slaughter of his subiects, ruin of his Realme, &amp; sodaine confusion of all christendome. The meditating on which miseries so mightily massacred his soule; as, had he not been of the greater wisedome, &amp; had y<SUP>e</SUP> surer confidence in the power of his God, to whom nothing can be impossible, it had been almost impossible for him, to haue any long time, kept his life &amp; body togith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. Neuer∣thelesse, with y<SUP>e</SUP> assiduous thought of his thronging misfor∣tunes, he was so exceedingly vexed, as in his agonie hee seemed more like some anatomie; then as he was, the ge∣nerous, worthy and thrice excellent Emperour <HI>Clara∣nax.</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="118"/> Whose sorrowes dayly more and more encreased, in such abundance, as it was a wonder to see the excesse of his extreamities, like an vnhealeable vlcer, still to en∣crease; whilest his power, pleasure, and princely pompe de∣cayed, ceased and decreased.</P>
<P>And euen in the middest of these his mischiefes, his enemies pressed, and oppressed, towardes his Cit∣tie, and subiects, in such huge multitudes; as, hauing encompassed <HI>Constantinople</HI> in, on all sides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Constantino∣ple straight engirt on al sides.</NOTE> and by their narrowe watchinges, disappointed the Cittizens of all further prouision of victualling necessaries, they penned them in, like a flocke of sillie sheepe, with∣in the encompassing circlings of deuouring Leopardes: whose staying brought staruing, and whose egresse as∣sured daunger, destruction and death. In these infinities of extreamitie; O God therefore, at last take pittie and compassion of thy distressed seruants pitious perplexities; that by their foile receiued of their remorselesse ene∣mies, thy owne honour, and thy sweete Sonne Iesus Christes glorie may neuer fall, or bee defiled with the filthie and horrible blasphemies, that will proceede out of the malitious mouthes of misbelieuing and faithlesse Sarrasens: from whose power, if of thy gracious good∣nesse, thou doest not protect thy deare children, vndoubt∣edly, euen in a moment, all christendome shalbe conuerted vnto Maumetrie.</P>
<P>But, least wee seeme herein too redious, let vs now re∣uert our stile to the last act of this lamentable storie, or ra∣ther dolefull Tragedie.</P>
<P>After that (to their no little ioy) the plagues of <HI>Europe,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> misbelieuing Pagans, had in many skirmishes (by the vnmatchable chiualrie of that same choyce flower of Knighthood, thrice exquisite <HI>Oceander</HI>) sequestered all good fortune from the proceedinges of the pent vp <HI>Grecians;</HI> and that they perfectly perceiued the <HI>quondam</HI> power of the christians, to be in such straunge sort dimi∣nished; as only w<SUP>t</SUP>in the circuit of the wals of <HI>Cōstantinople,</HI>
<PB REF="119"/> there were remaining but thirtie or fortie thousand figh∣ting souldiers (most of which number were eyther pined w<SUP>t</SUP> hunger euen vnto the boanes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The miserie of the christi∣ans.</NOTE> or preiudiced so in their bo∣dies by woundes, as they were not able to make any strong resistance) they waxed continually more boulder &amp; boulder in bidding battaile to their vnabiding enemies: who rather sought, if it were possible, by peace to pro∣cure some happy conclusion; thē by conflicting any more, to bring their Citties &amp; religion to confusion.

At which sorrowfull spectacle, the Christian souldiers were so exceedingly amazed, as by little and lit∣tle they gaue ground to their following foes; and in short time would haue fled; had not the god king <HI>Fiardon,</HI> after his breathing space, once more put in amongst them; and like a good Chiefetaine, sought rather to forsake his life, then forgoe his souldiers, in such extreamitie. Wherefore, with his faucheon in his fist, and his shield on his arme, hee speedily rode vnto the place where <HI>Oceander</HI> remained vn∣horsed: when, calling vnto him; <Q>Sir knight (quoth the good king of <HI>Bohemia</HI>) induced therto by thy vertue, though thy foe, and hostile enemie; yet enuying that any one should tri∣umphe in thy misfortune-caused ouerthrow, I shall quick∣ly deliuer thee from the daunger of thy enemies horses feete; that with the greater glory I may bouldly boast of my got∣ten victory.

<P><HI>Oceander,</HI> though he could not chuse but wonder at <HI>Fi∣ardons</HI> vnprofitable curtesie; yet he would not refuse his so gentle offer, especially standing in neede at that time of such an happie adiuver. And therefore, taking the horse by the raignes, hee lightly mounted vp into the saddle: &amp; then approaching to the king of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> Now sir knight (quoth he) wil you I should performe the promise I made vnto you? Yea, replyed <HI>Fiardon.</HI> Surely (answered the knight of
<PB REF="122"/> the sea) then, thought it might seeme a point of discurtesie to do so; yet since you wil needes haue it so, I shal willingly condescend to satisfie your fancie: prepare your selfe ther∣fore for the encounter. You shall be welcome, said <HI>Fiardon:</HI> &amp; thereupon they buckled together so fiercely, as if two hun∣gry Panthers had bin contending for some gotten prey:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Combat be∣tweene Fiar∣don and Oce∣ander.</NOTE> &amp; w<SUP>t</SUP> such exceeding strength, with their keene-edged Curtelaxes, they vnceasingly lashed on one anothers helmet, as it seemed they were al on fire, w<SUP>t</SUP> the sparkles that were raised by their furies. When, <HI>Fiardon</HI> (angry to be so long in such a simple combat) lifted vp Queene <HI>Gilorias</HI> sharpe slicing fauchon, and therewith smote the knight of the sea, so sound a buffet on the beauer; as, had not his age made him crazed (for all his enchaūted armour) he would at that same blowe, haue either slaine him outright, or so amazed him, as all y<SUP>e</SUP> Chirurgeons in Europe, w<SUP>t</SUP> their <HI>Esculapian</HI> skill, should neuer haue beene able to heale him againe. Neuerthelesse, the same descended not so lightly, but y<SUP>t</SUP> it made the knight of the sea not onely to stagger, but also to embrace his horse necke, to saue himselfe frō falling. But recouering himselfe, now by y<SUP>e</SUP> holy <HI>Alcheron</HI> (quoth he) I shall not be behinde hand w<SUP>t</SUP> thee for my paie∣ment: and therewithal raising himselfe vp in his stirrops, he lent y<SUP>e</SUP> good ould king of <HI>Bohemia</HI> so sound a blowe vpon the shield; as, parting it quight in two pieces, the sword neuer stayed, til it vncreasted his helmet. With the heauinesse of whose fal, <HI>Fiardon</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiardon ca∣ried captiue to Tomarins pauilion.</NOTE> was so amazed; as in a swoun he lay stil on his Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ser, vntill, by the commaundement of <HI>Oceander,</HI> he was carried captiue vnto <HI>Tomarins</HI> pauilion: whilest y<SUP>e</SUP> more then thrice renouned son of <HI>Olbiocles,</HI> followed eagrely after his flying enemies; whom to the very gates of <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Christiās goe to wrack.</NOTE> with a great slaughter, hee swiftly pursued.</P>
<P>As here, so in all parts of the battel, the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Bo∣hemians</HI> went to the worst. For, where the fower new dub∣bed knights of <HI>Athens, Siranius, Riscion, Libarano,</HI> &amp; <HI>Vponto</HI> were in combat against <HI>Xamaru, Vibrant, Accoell,</HI> &amp; <HI>Norlas,</HI> the battel went so disastrously against them; as, though <HI>Sira∣nius</HI> and <HI>Libarano,</HI> had slaine their opponents <HI>Vibrant</HI> and <HI>Norlas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vibrant &amp; Norlas slaine.</NOTE> and the other two had sorely wounded <HI>Accoell</HI> &amp; <HI>Xa∣maru;</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="122"/> yet they were at last so wōderfully weakened, not on∣ly with the offending and defending of their enemies, and friends; but also with y<SUP>e</SUP> abundance of bloud that issued in no small quantitie out of their broad woundes at the be∣ginning of the combat, their strengthes so exceedingly de∣creased, as in spight of their vncontrouled courages, they were faine submissiuely to prostrate themselues, and their liues to the doubtfull mercy of the misbeleeuing Pagans. Who, not a little glad of their gotten victory, sending them altogether (with the deade bodies of <HI>Vibrante</HI> and <HI>Norlas</HI>) vnto their brother <HI>Brammadons</HI> tent Royall, they present∣ly rushed into the middest of the <HI>Athenian</HI> regiments, with such puissance; as, maugre their couragious magnanimi∣ties, the Christians were faine to graunt themselues con∣quered; and by base flight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Christiās fly.</NOTE> to seeke to saue their wretched liues, frō y<SUP>e</SUP> furies of their wicked oppressours.

With which his virtuous valour &amp; true knightly prowesse, <HI>Acanio</HI> was so amazed, as he presently deliuered vp his sword vnto his hands; &amp; yielded himselfe &amp; his safety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arcanio priso∣ner.</NOTE> prisoner to so praise worthy a vāquisher; who speedily sent him to accōpany Fiardon,

But alas, such their hope was sodainely frustrated. For, as by the appro∣ching of the Prince <HI>Olbiocles</HI> (whose ague the fearefull a∣gony of the subuersion of all Christendome, had straungely banished) together with the ould Queene <HI>Zaama</HI> of <HI>Bohe∣mia</HI> (who hearing of her husband <HI>Fiardons</HI> harmes, had ta∣ken armes <HI>Amazon</HI>-like, for his reuengement) the retiring <HI>Bohemians</HI> and <HI>Athenians</HI> were againe reduced into their martiall order;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battell renewed by Olbiocles &amp; Zaama.</NOTE> and the battell on the <HI>Grecians</HI> side, was ranke by ranke couragiously begun a fresh against their e∣nemies; so as those that got groūd lately, were now growen to be good inough for their pursuers; whome they continu∣ally chased, with a newe encreased slaughter: Euen so a∣gaine, the stout Queene <HI>Zaama</HI> of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> being ouermat∣ched, by the valour and youthfull vigour of a lustie <HI>Afri∣can,</HI> named <HI>Caliartez</HI> (who had quite vnbuckled her haber∣geon)
