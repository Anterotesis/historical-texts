<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have often observed the In∣convenience of too obstinately maintaining an Opinion con∣trary to that which has generally obtained, and in serious or weigh∣ty Matters have carefully avoid∣ed that Rock upon which I have known some to have been lost;
<PB REF="3"/> but in our last Converse, the Sub∣ject whereof was the Finess with which the Ladies and Gallants of this present Age manage their A∣mours, which the Company then present unanimously agreed was advanced to a perfection, no former Age could parallel; hav∣ing uncontrouledly asserted the contrary; and perhaps too posi∣tively, and having given an In∣stance in some Passages of above five hundred years ago, which you all would positively conclude to be a Fiction, till I satisfi'd you, that I met with the Histo∣ry in an antient Greek Manu∣script, which by the Injury of time, and the Ignorance of the
<PB REF="3"/> Persons, through whose hands it had passed, was very imperfect, as having neither beginning nor ending; and in some places not legible, and with many interrup∣tions of some excellent Passages, yet contain'd enough to justifie my Assertion, and to convince the Hearers, that in that Age and Countrey, there were Per∣sons who lived much after our Mode, and that there is nothing new under the Sun. I thought I should have had the general applause of that illustrious Com∣pany, for having so well justified my self; but instead thereof, am punisht with their and your indis∣pensible Commands, to put what
<PB REF="4"/> remains of that Piece; the short account whereof was agreeably received by you, into a Language intelligible to persons more con∣cerned in affairs of that nature, than acquainted with the Tongue in which before now it was only extant. My Style, I know, is very unfit for the Subject, and my time designed for a far different Em∣ployment; but rather than disob∣lige so many, and so fair Friends, I have put a Force upon my self, and sequestered some few hours for this her View, but freely profess to you, it is a Piece very im∣perfect in the Matter, by the Misfortune and Injury of many Ages, but more by the rudeness
<PB REF="4"/> of the Translators Style, who in the Judgment of the Learned, will be censur'd for having done the elegant Author much wrong; but in regard his Name is not known, and so none can be con∣cern'd for him, I cannot be con∣demn'd to reparation, and there∣fore with more confidence pre∣sent it to you, as it is with all its Defects.</P>

<DIV2 N="1-44" TYPE="pages">
<P>AH unfortunate <HI>Nicerotis!</HI> To what infelicities art thou destin'd? No sooner does the world take notice of thy blooming Beauties, but thou art hurri'd away into a Desart; no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooner become the Adoration of the great∣est Court upon Earth, but thou art ra∣vish'd from it, and banish'd to an obscure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sland, as if Youth and Beauty were a Crime: Thou must suffer the punishment of Tray∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors, for pleasing the sweetest and most ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iging Monarch that sits upon a Throne.
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> Too late I perceive the difference between a Lover and a Husband. Where are the Vows, my dear <HI>Nicias,</HI> so often made, be∣fore he could prevail with me, to give him my heart? How often did he, with the most solemn Oaths protest, his whole Life should be employ'd to please me: That he never would entertain so much as a Thought, that should be disagreeable to mine? That my Inclinations should govern his with a Sympa∣thy? But he is now on a sudden grown po∣sitive and imperious, as the Guardian Eunuch of the Palace, and inflexible as a peevish a∣ged Father. While <HI>Nicerotis</HI> thus passio∣nately bewail'd her condition, <HI>Phylaenis</HI> who was employ'd in her Cabinet, and overheard some part of her Lamentation, coming from thence, and making use of the Confidence that was between them, thus interrupted her: Madam, What means this weakness in a Person of your Quality? It ill becomes one of your Understanding and Spirit, to grieve at the Traverses of Fortune: Persons like you, either foresee their Adversities at a distance, and then consult how to avoid or oppose them, or when they are surpriz'd, bear them with courage. Before you sub∣mitted your self to the Dominion of a Hus∣band, you should have believed those that told you they are all Tyrants, whose Will
<PB N="3" REF="6"/> is their Law, and Interest their only affection; when their first Heats are cool'd, their Passion becomes in the best of them Kind∣ness, in some indifferency, but in the most, an Aversion. If a poor Soul fall into the hands of one of them, if he be a Fool, she is presently persecuted with a thousand Im∣pertinencies, groundless Quarrels, Suspitions, and Jealousies without cause, cross Humors, peevish, and always unseasonable Wars: But of the two, a wise man is the greater E∣vil; so many Precepts and Cautions, such Pretensions and Circumspection, a Woman had better forswear the World, and be cloi∣ster'd up, then be bound to the Rules of his Order. Your Satyr against Marriage is al∣together as unseasonable, reply'd <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> as my Complaints against Fortune; but I must confess, you have a little rais'd my Spi∣rits, and made me sensible, 'tis fitter to think of some way to prevent, if it be possi∣ble, this sudden Retreat, than vainly to be∣wail it; the time is very short, and if your Invention be as happy in this Instant, as I have sometime found it, you shall ever be my Tutelar Angel. <HI>Phylaenis,</HI> who was a Per∣son of Experience, as well as great presence of mind in such Affairs, had formed in her thoughts an Expedient, which so pleas'd her own Fancy, that with great assurance,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/> and Gaity in her Countenance, she cry'd out, Madam, be no more afflicted; if you can re∣solve not to be wanting, to your self, I dare promise to stop your Journey for some months, if you will consent to — At this word, <HI>Niceas</HI> entred the Room, and <HI>Phylaenis</HI> in some confusion, for fear she had been overheard by her Lord, withdrew, to leave it to her Lady, to receive the first E∣ruption of his Resentments; but he coming in great hast, as being intent upon the Exe∣cution of a Design, which he knew admit∣ted no delay, where the least omission might prove an unavoidable ruine, was so taken up with it, that if he overheard any of their Words, he yet knew not that he did: Ma∣dam, says he, I have been to perform those necessary Civilities for you, to those of your Friends and Relations, who are most con∣cerned in you, and I have satisfi'd them, that it is indispensibly requisite for preserving my Life and Honour, that we proceed immedi∣ately on our Journey: The Galley lies ready upon her Oars in a week without the Harbour, and I am come to conduct you thither; there is no time to be lost, call your Woman, and let us be going, we shall have better leisure to discourse the motives of this so sudden resolution in our Voyage, and taking her by the hand, he call'd out to <HI>Phylaenis</HI> to fol∣low
<PB N="5" REF="7"/> her Lady, and said he had given order to the Steward, to send all their Necessaries by another way, to meet them at the Ship side. The Surprize was most astonishing to <HI>Nicerotis;</HI> but giving her hand to her Lord, <HI>Nicias,</HI> says she, you are all the World to me, and where-ever I go with you, that place will be more pleasing to me, than all the Delights and Glories of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I cannot only be content but happy with you in a Desart: Let us go then; where you please, and though I have been instructed, the great Respects that ought to be paid to Relations, Familiars, and Superiours upon such occasions, and that the neglect of them, does always, if not destroy, at least diminish the esteem that persons of Quality ought to desire to live in, in the World; I have now learnt, that an absolute conformity to the Government of a Husband is the greatest Duty, as well as Felicity of a Wife. Madam, reply'd <HI>Nicias,</HI> as we go, I will satisfie all your Scruples; and to convince you of the necessity of this abrupt departure, that you will confess, I only wanted time to let you know the Reasons of it beforehand, to have made it your Resolution before it was mine. By this time they were at the Chariot, and being entred, were soon at the Water-side, having only to pass a Back-way by the Walls
<PB REF="8"/> of the Palace-Gardens; so that unobserv'd they went aboard the Gally that attended them, and immediately setting forward with a gentle stroak of their Oars, they made no great hast, that a small Sloop, which was to bring their Servants and Necessaries, just with the fall of Night, might overtake them. <HI>Nicerotis</HI> follow'd by her Woman, was con∣ducted into the State-room of the Gally by the Captain, who leaving her there, went out to wait on <HI>Nicias,</HI> who was got upon the Poop, to observe the pleasant Shores on both sides the <HI>Hellespont;</HI> and to take notice of Landmarks, by which the Pilots govern their Course in passing those Straits. The Day being calm, and the motion of the Vessel steady and slow, the Lady and her Wo∣man did not yet perceive that Discomposure creeping on them, which being at Sea, brings upon most Constitutions not accustomed to it, so that they were not interrupted by it, to entertain themselves with the Discourse of their present Condition; and <HI>Phylaenis</HI> first breaking silence, Madam, said she, it is no time to shew your Ladiship, the means I had found out to have retarded this Voyage, which I had just then modell'd, and was going to propose to you when my Lord came upon us, and I fear, overheard some part of a Conversation, which may hereafter
<PB N="7" REF="8"/> breed troublesome apprehensions in a Head so capricious as his. You may be secure from any fear of that kind, says <HI>Nicerotis;</HI> for his mind was so intent upon the Design he was to execute, of removing me from Court, that I believe there must have been some great violence offer'd him, to have made him take notice of any thing else. There is no remedy, now we are wholly in his power, and there is nothing to be done, but to put on a good Countenance, and to appear pleas'd with what cannot be avoided; though I would venture a thousand Lives in the attempt of returning to the Palace, and to appear there but one hour, so it could be ef∣fected without blemish to my Honour. You know it is but two dayes since the Prince <HI>Athemistius</HI> made me a Visit at my Lodgings; and after he had a while entertained the Com∣pany there with me, with the most diverting Conversation in the World, and charm'd us all into an Admiration of his Wit, he took me aside to a Window, and with a voice lower then to be heard by any present but my self; Madam, says he, I ought to be very wel∣come to you, on this Visit, for I come to tell you, that your Beauty, (which in the short time you have appear'd at Court, has inspir'd all the Men with Love, and the Ladies with Envy) is ready to advance you above all
<PB N="8" REF="9"/> their Passions, and above their Qualities too; for I come from our Imperial Master, to tell you, that he observes nothing in his Royal Palace so glorious as you, and that he begs (who commands us all) that you will make your Court to the Empress, and be constant at her side at the usual hour, when he will take the first opportunity to tell you himself the Value he has for you. I heard this with several inward Commotions, and not without a guilty Blush, which discovered, I well enough understood what was the meaning of this Complement, and was going to make an An∣swer, that would have better suited a vertuous Prudence, then the Princes Design; when he stopt me, saying, Madam, I must beg your Par∣don, if I do not permit you to charge me with an Answer: I have executed my Commission fully, and his Majesty will better understand how you receive his Commands, by your obeying them, then by any words I can de∣liver from you. And thus breaking off with me, he addrest his Discourse to a Kinswoman of mine, who had possest the Emperors Fa∣vour in the highest degree for some years, and rallying her at his usual rates, upon some Intrigues that were not understood by the rest of the Company, some piquant Repartées past between them; and at last the Prince said to her, Madam, let us not be angry,
<PB N="9" REF="9"/> we shall shortly be upon more equal terms, and then we may agree or fall out, as the hu∣mour takes us. This put an end to his Visit, and put the Dutchess into such a Fret, that the rest of the Company taking notice of it, one after another took their Leaves and de∣parted, and she and I being left alone, she passionately breaks out into these Ex∣pressions: I must no longer endure the Inso∣lencies of <HI>Athemistius;</HI> his Buffoonery pleases, 'tis true, the Emperor; but when I let him know how often it is uneasie to me, and with how little respect he treats me in all Companies, he will be made sensible of his Folly, in using his Wit against me, that has more powerful ways of securing her Interest, than pratling. I could not but smile at these Threats, when I reflected on the Message I had just then received, and saw that what the Prince said to her, might be grounded upon the Prospect he had of the Affair he was then engag'd in; which she perceiving, Cousin, says she, I hope the ill Usage I have had from <HI>Athemistius,</HI> or the Disorder it has put me in, is no occasion of your appearing so well pleased. Madam, said I, I have too much Interest in you, to be pleas'd at any thing that displeases you; but I could not without some disdain, think of the Carriage of the Prince, who, though he be a man of
<PB N="10" REF="10" MS="y"/> extraordinary Wit, I take to be one not of ordinary Discretion, who after having en∣tertained me with Expressions of the highest respect, should so soon forget himself before my face, at that rate to use a Person of your Grandure, to whom I had the honour to be related, I shall frame this Action, take my Measures how to value him: beware of him, says she, he makes Love to every new Face, and whatever his Success be, he makes it the subject of his Rallery in the next Company. Keep your self upon your Guard, take my Advice, and have no Converse with the most uncertain Person in the World. She took leave, and waited on her to her Cha∣riot, and returning, fell into considera∣tion of the Commands <HI>Athemistius</HI> had brought me: I became very pensive, and retir'd into my Cabinet, and lock∣ing my self up there, that I might with∣out interruption examine my Heart, which I found began to be interessed what it would have me do, I ballanc'd a thousand things, before I could observe the Scales to turn; the Precepts of Religion, and the Rules of Mo∣desty, in which I had been carefully instruct∣ed in my Childhood; the faith I had given to <HI>Nicias;</HI> the Love I really have for him, and his great Merits; his lovely Person, and graceful Meen; his Gallantry, and obliging
<PB N="11" REF="10"/> De∣meanour towards me, were irresistible Ar∣guments to confirm me in my Virtue: but on the other hand, the Glories of the most splendid Court in the World, the Charms of Wealth and Power, and the Ambition of Pre∣cedency, which is a most vehement Passion in our Sex: the glory of being concern'd in the Intrigues of Court and State; and the Pride to see the Grecian <HI>Monarch</HI> at my Feet, began to incline the Scale, and seem more weighty; and I was about to have call'd for you, to take your Judgment in a Case of this importance, when my own heart told me, if thou wouldst be happy, preserve thy Innocence, 'tis that will make all things pleasant, and without it there is no Enjoy∣ment, but has more of Gall than Sweetness. This divine Thought so ravisht and possest my Soul, that I immediately resolved to de∣spise all those Allurements, to desire to be no∣thing, but what was most grateful to my dear <HI>Nicias;</HI> to look upon <HI>Athemistius,</HI> as the most unworthy Person in the World, who being of the greatest Quality, would take upon him the basest of Imployments. I determin'd to take no notice of what had passed between him and I, no not to you, in whom I have an entire Confidence, to a∣void the Court, and divert my self in our Family, and among my Relations, which
<PB N="12" REF="11"/> are numerous and honourable enough to af∣ford all the Delights of virtuous Conversati∣on; and thus having composed my self, and pass'd the rest of that and the next day, after my usual manner, as you very well know; for if you could have observ'd any change, I am sure you would have enquired into the cause of it. Yesternight <HI>Nicias</HI> came home somewhat earlier then was his Custom, and with a Countenance that discovered more of concern, than I had ever observed in him, finding me alone; Madam, says he, read this Paper, giving me a Billet, directed to the Lord <HI>Nicias,</HI> which contained these words; <HI>This is a Design,</HI> Nicias, <HI>against your Ho∣nour, which nothing can prevent, but the sudden Removal of the Fair</HI> Nicerotis <HI>from the Court, your Sword nor your Friends, must not serve you in this occasion, or else I should not be the Man that could advise you to fly from the Danger.</HI> By this I per∣ceive the Secret had taken vent at Court, but resolv'd not to seem to understand the meaning of it: I cry'd out, what Riddle is this, my Lord? What Words? What Dan∣gers are these? What Design, that nothing can prevent, but my Removal? Tell me presently the Truth, or my Fear will act up∣on me, what the cruellest Murtherer could design. There is no Danger to either of us,
<PB N="13" REF="11" MS="y"/> said he; if we take this Advice, 'tis from so good a Hand, that I am certain of the Im∣portance of it without further enquiry: All you have to do, is to prepare for your Voi∣age to <HI>Crete</HI> with me to morrow, of which you must take notice to no creature alive: I have already provided a Gally with all Conve∣niencies, and in the Morning, while you are dressing, I will make those Visits that are necessary for you, and satisfie your Friends of the manner of our Departure. He then gave order to his Servants, if any Friends came to sup with him, they should tell them, he was gone indisposed to Bed, and that their Lady was so concerned for him, she could not be Company for any one that Night. Having thus plac'd Centries and Guards upon me, he sate ruminating a while and silent; but when a Sigh or extravagant Oath gave a sudden and short vent to his Passion, I flattered and begg'd, he would tell me the whole matter that troubl'd him; I wept when he refused me, and at last, fell into some Fits, which frighted him, and were really incommodious to me; the Servants were call'd, and after the help of some Cor∣dials you brought me, he directed I should go to Bed, and was not long behind me him∣self. I must confess, this was the first un∣pleasant night I had with <HI>Nicias.</HI> She was
<PB N="14" REF="12"/> here inturrepted with a sudden Shout of all the Slaves and Mariners of the Gally, who saluted the Castles of <HI>Sestos</HI> and <HI>Abydos,</HI> as they pass'd by them; and running to the Door of the Cabin, to know what the Matter was, when she understood it, she walk'd out up∣on the Deck, to take the view of those Pla∣ces, so famous for the unfortunate Loves of <HI>Hero</HI> and <HI>Leander;</HI> the History whereof, be∣ing so well known, only <HI>Nicias</HI> mentioned to his Lady; but from thence, the Captain of the Gally took occasion to tell them the Story of a very Tragical Love-Adventure, which had lately happened in that Place, which was thus: <HI>Callippus,</HI> a Country Gen∣tleman, lived not far from <HI>Cestos,</HI> and was Lord of part of the Village, who by coming sometimes among his Tenants there, for the management and improving his Concerns, took notice of a young Woman, who had not long been married to <HI>Dictyon</HI> a Fisher∣man, who held a Tenement under him; to have the better pretence to frequent her, under colour of incouraging a young Man, whose industry and carefulness he would of∣ten applaud, offer'd to advance him some Money, to fit him with the best Utensils for carrying on his Trade; which being gladly accepted of by him, and his Lords kindness much magnified to his Wife. <HI>Callippus</HI> was
<PB N="15" REF="12" MS="y"/> the most welcome man in the World, when ever he would do them the Honour to look into his House, which as often as he came to the Town, he fail'd not to do; and upon pretence of erecting some new Build∣ing next to the Fishermans Habitation, which he took in hand, to countenance his frequent∣ing that place more than usual, rather than for any other advantage he could propose to himself by it, he had opportunity to let young <HI>Phaedra</HI> know he had observ'd so much Beauty in her, that he could not but judge her worthy of a much better condition of Living, and that Compassion had grown at last, into so great an Affection, that he could not live, unless she would make him a just return; and if she would, he would provide that she should live in much better Fashion than any of her Neighbours, and take such care of her Credit, by finding Employment for her Husband, that all should be attributed to his thriving. The young Woman, who had been bred in a rich Family, where she had learnt to value good Cloaths, and had begun to understand some∣what of Love, but by her careful poor Pa∣rents, was married to one of their own Qua∣lity and Neighbourhood, to prevent the Miscarriages, that Girls, who have any appea∣rance of Beauty, are apt to be seduced to
<PB N="16" REF="13"/> in such Places, was soon convinc'd by <HI>Cal∣lippus</HI> his Arguments, that it was better to love a Gentleman, whose Person was capa∣ble enough, without any other consideration, to prevail upon the greatest Beauties of his own Quality, then to grow old and poor in the Embraces of her Fisherman, soon con∣sented to his Desires, and with so good a Grace, that he, who before probably had no fur∣ther Design, then to gratifie an Appetite which young Gallants are not very desirous to re∣strain, and to add to the Trophies of his amorous Victories, upon which men of his Age and Humour use to value themselves, be∣came enamour'd of her to that degree, that he could not live without her, and his assi∣duity began to give suspition to the Neigh∣berhood, who always are maliciously disposed to suspect and defame the frequent Converses of Persons of different Sexes. To remedy this Inconvenience, which he saw would inevita∣bly cause the interruption of a Satisfaction he priz'd more than all other Enjoyments, he pretended to leave the care of his Buildings to his Servant, and that he had a mind to try the Hunting on the <HI>Asian</HI> side of the Streight; and to that end, he agreed with <HI>Dictyon</HI> to fit up his Boat, for the more ac∣commodate transporting him three days in the Week, and attending him on the other
<PB N="17" REF="13"/> side, where he might as beneficially use his Fishing as any other place, whilst he him∣self follow'd another Task in the Plains near <HI>Abydos:</HI> And having conserted the Intrigue with <HI>Phoedra,</HI> that when her Husband at∣tended him, so soon as the good Man was gone off from the Shore, she should dress her self in those Habits he had furnish'd her with, and close Vail'd, as the Custom is for Persons of Quality, take a Gondala, and pass over to <HI>Abydos,</HI> where he had pro∣vided a place for her Reception, and would meet her, to entertain their Delights in more security, and with more freedom than they could at home. This was put in execution, and the Practice was continued for some time. The Gentleman, when he had landed in the bottom of a Bay, about half a Mile above the Town, and always giving order that the Boat should lye within sight of that Place, when he came again to the Shore, that upon a Sign made, might immediate∣ly come to take him in; and in the mean time, the Master of the Boat and his Servant might attend their Fishing; so well he thought he had projected this Contrivance, that it was impossible he should be disturb'd in the Execution of it; and for a while, it succeeded to his Wish, till some of those e∣vil Eyes, that had observ'd them at first,
<PB N="18" REF="14"/> now perceiving the Scene was chang'd, so narrowly watched <HI>Phaedra,</HI> that they trac'd her to the Rendezvous appointed her by <HI>Callippus;</HI> where finding that true Love in effect, which they presum'd so before, they did not spare to make themselves merry with the Discourse of it at their usual Meetings; till at last, some who were concern'd for poor <HI>Dictyon,</HI> could not digest the Ralleries, that were on all occasions plac'd upon him, advertiz'd him of the Game he so often car∣ry'd his Patron to hunt: The man was na∣turally, as the Natives of <HI>Thrace</HI> are, of a dark and revengeful Disposition, soon resolved to do himself right, both against his too kind Master and lascivious Wife: And having for some time debated in his thoughts the man∣ner of it, he took upon him a more than ordinary Kindness for her, and a greater Re∣spect for him: And one day, as he pass'd him over, he told him, that he was resolv'd to make his Boat more convenient for him, and to contrive a Cabbin, that he and his Servants might sit in security from the Wash of the Sea in windy Weather, and from the dashing of the Oars in Calms, which he might take down, and set up at his pleasure, whenever he found it inconvenient to his Fishing, or dangerous in too high Winds. <HI>Callippus</HI> was well pleas'd with the Fisher∣mans
<PB N="19" REF="14"/> seeming care of him, and promis'd him to defray the Charge of it. He set his Carpenter the next day to work, and fram'd such a Box, which lockt the two sides toge∣ther, it parted of it self, and fell the one half on one side, and the other of the other, over the Boat sides; if the Boatmen were not ready, as soon the Bolt was drawn, to set their hands to it, and take it down: This being finished, the Ingenuity and Neat∣ness of it very well pleased the amorous Gallant, who had not the least suspition of any Trap laid for him. Thus continued he his usual recreation twice or thrice; after this, when <HI>Dictyon</HI> having ripen'd his Pro∣ject, the Morning he resolv'd to take a full Revenge of all that were Parties in the Injury done him, he takes a Bottle of Wine, and as his Custom was, before he went out, took a lusty Draught of it, and then con∣veying a violent Poyson into it, pretended so much kindness to his Wife, and so much commended the goodness of the Wine, that he oblig'd her to pledge him, without much difficulty, and so hastned to fit out his Boat, and attend his Master, who at his hour, was at the Water-side; he receiv'd him into the Boat very jocundly, and set him on Shoar on the other side. <HI>Callippus</HI> hasted to his Rendezvous, having given his Servants or∣der
<PB N="20" REF="15"/> where to hunt, and where they should expect him, at the usual hour of his Return; but he had not been long with his Mistress, but she began to be sick, her Colour to come and go, and to be griped in her Sto∣mach, which put the two Lovers into great disorder; for if she were sick unto Death, she was no less afflicted; in a while, the Poyson began to work on her Vitals, she fell into fainting Fits; the Neighbours were call'd into the Assistance, the Physitian sent for to the next City, but she liv'd not till he came, for in six or seven hours she expi∣red in great Tortures and Convulsions; at the time of her being ill, she complained on∣ly of a Draught of Wine she drank in the Morning; but having no inkling of her Husbands Jealousie, did not at all suspect him of any Malice to her. Her Lover was in great perplexity, not only the loss of a Person so dear to him, opprest him with grief, but the Solicitude how to avoid the Scandal that must arise, by her dying in that Place; from whence, he knew not how to convey her to her own House, privately set his In∣vention upon the Rack; at last, he directed the Confidents of his Amours, that she should be buried as a Stranger, who had come to their House the night before, from a Place infected with the Plague, and so should keep
<PB N="21" REF="15"/> their House shut up for some time, till they had satisfied the Magistrate, the Infection had not touched any one of the Family. And by that time, he would think of some way, to pacifie <HI>Dictyons</HI> Sorrow, and give out, that she, walking on the Shoar-side, to take the Air, in the Evening, was taken by a <HI>Sarazen</HI> Pirat, who happen'd at that time to have pursued a small light Vessel, bound for <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to the very Streights mouth, but missing his Prey, and upon his Return, tacking near the Shoar, when he es∣pied her alone, sent off his Boat and took her away. Having setled his Thoughts as well as he could, and adjusted all this Affair with his Host, whom he entirely trusted, having largely obliged him, he went very melancholy out of Town, towards his Ser∣vants, and who had attended him after their Sport was over, near an hour longer than it was usual, and with them went on to the Shoar, where they found the Boat in readi∣ness: For <HI>Dictyon</HI> had long left off his Fish∣ing, being impatient with the Desire of ex∣ecuting his Design, and with fear, that some∣thing might disappoint it, or the sudden Death of his Wife, might make his Master apprehend some foul play. But when he perceived he came, he was very busie and officious in helping him on Board; and
<PB N="22" REF="16"/> when he was seated, perceiving his deep sadness (though he too well understood the true cause of it) he pretended to wonder at, and became more inquisitive into it, then his Masters humour could well dispence with; who, therefore gave him a Reprimand, which not being accustomed to receive, spurr'd up his Revenge, though that need∣ed no provocation, yet dissembling his Rage, when the Servants were setled, he puts off from the Shore, and gets into the Steerage of the Boat, to guide her, whilst his two Men plyed the Oars; they were no sooner come into the middle of the Channel, but he slips out the Bolt, which held the frame of the Cabbin together, and immediately the Gentleman and his two Servants fell over the Boat, and it being a dark night, were all three drown'd. <HI>Dictyon</HI> would make his Servants believe it was an accident; but they should all suffer Death for it, if they were taken, and therefore told them, if they would fly with them, they might preserve themselves. That they would go to Shoar, and he would fetch what Money, and what valuable things he had, and immediately go to Sea, and recover some of the Islands pos∣sessed by the <HI>Sarazens,</HI> who were Enemies to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and very powerful at Sea, by whom they would be gladly received. This
<PB N="23" REF="16"/> seeming the best thing they could do, in the Condition they were, it was consented to; and bringing the Boat to Shoar, the Master and one of his Men went to his House, and finding not his Wife, seemed to be angry, and to want the Keys of some Boxes, and broke open what ever was lock't in the House, and seizing on a Purse of Gold, and some other good things, wherewith his Ma∣sters Liberality had enriched his Wife, and loading his Servant with such Provisions as were necessary, he goes out of doors towards the Boat. When he came to it, he found not the Servant he left there; but having not leisure to wait for him (being under ap∣prehension of a Discovery) he hastily be∣stows his Carriage aboard, and with the help of him that was with him, he put off to Sea. The vigor wherewith they apply'd themselves to their Oars, carried them many Leagues, before the Night fell; at which time the Moon being risen, had sufficiently fa∣vour'd their purpose; but that divers Symp∣toms of rough weather approaching, oblig'd them to put in at the next convenient Creek; where bestowing themselves under shelter of a hanging Rock, after they had struck a Light, they fell to the Provisions they had brought from home, little suspecting the con∣sequence of that Banquet. For in the hur∣ry
<PB N="24" REF="17"/> of their Dispatch, the Servant (as by the just Judgment of Heaven) had taken that Bottle, whereof his Masters Wife had drank so fatal a Draught, which filling up and bringing aboard, prov'd share of their En∣tertainment; the dire effects of which, after short repose, awakt them, to sleep for ever: the Bodies, together with the Treasure in the Boat, prov'd an Object of no less won∣der than joy, to some neighbouring Cotta∣gers, who descending to their usual Employ∣ments to the Sea-side, soon after discovered them.—This Relation of the Captains, though listned unto with equal Attention, was with various Sentiments reflected on by <HI>Ni∣cias</HI> and <HI>Nicerotis;</HI> he justifying the Pro∣ceedings of <HI>Dictyon,</HI> and applauding so nice a sense of Honour, in a Person of such mean Degree, whilst she silently commiserated the Misfortune of the Lovers. Her Indispositi∣on, by reason of being unaccustomed to Sea, was now so much increased, that for the rest of that day, and part of the next, she kept within her Cabbin. The Vessel was all the while follow'd by so brisk a Gale, that in less time than cou'd be propos'd, they arriv'd where they intended. <HI>Nicerotis</HI> con∣sulting Prudence, and applying her self to her wonted Subtlety, joyns with <HI>Nicias,</HI> in Acknowledgments to the Captain of the Gally,
<PB N="25" REF="17"/> for his Conduct and Care, and dissembling a Joy, which she knew would please her Lord, was before-hand with him, in giving the Welcome to <HI>Cydon.</HI> The Lord <HI>Emathi∣us</HI> being informed of their Arrival, imme∣diately descends to the Port to receive them, with such Attendance of Chariots and Com∣pany, as was suitable to their Quality and Re∣lation to him; so discharging the Captain well presented, he conducts them to the Ci∣ty. The Place appointed for their Re∣sidence, was an extraordinary Fabrick, which in the original Design of it, contained not only an Oratory and Court of Sacrifice for the Deity there in former times ador'd, but also spacious Mansions for such Priests as were employed in those Rites. Which ancient Seat of Idolatry and Superstition, together with the rest of the same sort, had, since days of better Knowledge, been demolisht or alter'd, and their rich appendant Possessions, and were given as Rewards to such Persons as had merited of the Empire. This Tem∣ple, with the Revenues belonging to it, had been conferred on the Ancestors of <HI>Amathi∣us,</HI> for eminent Services by them per∣formed, who, according to their several Fancies, built it up in several Ages; so that that though it wanted that regular neatness, which the modern Builder so much affect;
<PB N="26" REF="18"/> yet the stateliness of the Rooms, shewing the large Souls of the Lords of that Family, and the convenient disposition of the Apart∣ments, largely supplied that Defect. The Apartment appointed for <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> was one of the last built parts of the Palace, and faced a large Garden, of three hundred Cu∣bits square, encompassed with a very high Wall; out of her Anti-Chamber, opened a folding Door, into the midst of a Terrace Walk, of the length of one side of the Gar∣den, paved with Black and White Marble; from which was a Descent of six large Steps, of the same Materials into the Walks be∣low, which were laid with a gross sort of Gravel of various Colours, so fast, so bind∣ing and so smooth, that it seems at first view, to resemble that curious <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work that adorns the Pavement of the Quire, in the great Cathedral of <HI>Sancta So∣phia</HI> in <HI>Constantinople;</HI> between the Walks were Grass-Plots. <GAP DESC="omitted" REASON="lacuna" RESP="source" REND="———" DISP="〈 ——— 〉"/> <HI>[These Marks shews a great Breach in the Original, by the Defacements of the Writing of more than a Page.]</HI> In the midst was a large Bason of black Marble, about thirty Cubits in Compass, exquisitely polished, sup∣ported
<PB N="27" REF="18"/> by the Effigies at large, of eleven of the Twelve Signs of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> all made of white Marble; the Twelfth, being the Fishes, was placed within the little Sea, as in their proper Elements. In the middle was placed a large Pedestal, which to the surface of the Water was a ragged piece of Marble, as it was digg'd out of the Quarry, topp'd with a greenish coloured Stone, cut after the form of the Island of <HI>Crete,</HI> with all the Creeks, Harbours and Rivers, and all the Hills and Mountains of it; with the little Figures of the hundred Cities, for which that Island was once famous, cut in seve∣ral coloured Stones, and inchased into it, in the several Distances and Positions, in which the real ones were placed. In the midst was the Mountain <HI>Ida,</HI> out of which rose seve∣ral small Streams that fill'd those Channels, made to represent the Rivers, and ran ac∣cording to their proper Courses into the Sea; on the top of the Mountain was placed the Statue of a Woman, of the purest Alabaster, holding in her Arms the Figure of a Child, sucking at one Breast, whilst the other spout∣ed a Stream of Water into the Bason; about her Head, was a Chaplet of Ivy, very natu∣ral, the Stone being artificially stain'd to the Colour of the Leaf; she was naked to the Waste, but from thence to the middle of her
<PB N="28" REF="19"/> Thighs hung a Goatskin, being the Dress of the <HI>Bacchanal,</HI> to whom the Poets feign <HI>Ju∣piter</HI> was sent to be nursed; this was a piece of that admired Statuary <HI>Praxite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> who lived a thousand years before, and being found by <HI>Amathius</HI> his Father, in the Ruins of the Temple, when he was clearing a Foun∣dation, was for the Excellency of the Work∣manship, repaired and set up to view, though it had been formerly the Idol of that Place, as may well be judged, being the Image of <HI>Jupiters</HI> Nurse, giving suck to the young God, the Honour of whose fostering Anti∣quity, has attributed to this Country.

She had re∣ceived the Visits of the Relations of the Fami∣ly, and of such other Persons of Quality in that City, who were any way obliged to make them, and it was time she should re∣pay that Debt, and make Acquaintances in a Place, where she was no longer to be a Stran∣ger. Her first Visit was the Court of <HI>Basi∣lucius,</HI> then Exurch or Chief Governour of the Island, under the Emperour <HI>Isiaacius.</HI> He was a Person of great Magnificence, and be∣sides the Favour of his Master, which he en∣joyed in a great Proportion, he was Lord of a vast Patrimonial Estate, which enabled him to keep one of the best Provincial Courts in the whole Empire: His own Family was numerous; his Daughters were arrived to that Age, in which their Sex begins to be
<PB N="30" REF="20"/> sen∣sible of their Priviledges, and their Beauties gave them no unreasonable Pretences, to think they had the Prerogative of all others of the Country, as well in right of their Perfections as Quality; his three Sons were now all well accomplished, but the Eldest, <HI>Leontius,</HI> was a Person who had given those Proofs of his Courage and Abilities to the World, that he was deservedly reputed one of the bravest Gentlemen alive; his Succes∣ses in the Wars, and in his Amours, were always glorious, and in both his Merits and his Fortune still made it disputable which of them most promoted his Conquests. The Authority of the Father, the Virtue and Prudence of the Mother, the Gallantry and Beauty of the Children, drew together such a Concourse of the Nobility and Gentry, that <HI>Lycias</HI> his Court had no small resemblance of the Emperors, and yet when <HI>Nicerotis</HI> first appear'd there, she presently became the Idol of one Sex, but the Envy of the other: The Ladies, who could spy no fault in her Face, in her Stature, or Meen, in her Wit, or Deport∣ment, in a short time began to blame her Conduct, the Gallants of the Court and Town made their Resort where she frequen∣ted, she was desired of every one that had Quality enough, to pretend to her Favour; Comedies and Balls were more frequently
<PB N="31" REF="20"/> appointed then it was usual in <HI>Cydon;</HI> and some of the Court-Wits, who would not al∣low themselves thought enough to write Plays, made Prologues, to give</P>
<P>At every publick Meeting, some one or other took the opportunity to pay her some extraordinary of his Respect. <HI>Leontius</HI> had so many Advantages over all the rest, that it is not to be wondred at, if his Addresses met the best Reception. He visited her often; he omitted no occasion of seeing her, either in publick or private, and gave her such E∣vidences of his Passion, as could not but con∣vince her of it; he made Presents to <HI>Phile∣nis,</HI> and by that means had her whole Coun∣cel in Pension; so that she could take no Resolutions, but what were in his Favour, nor discover her Sentiments, but immediate∣ly he had notice of them: For <HI>Philenis</HI> was the only Person she had intire confidence in, and for whom she had nothing of reserve. One Morning, says <HI>Nicerotis</HI> to her, How impossible is it to resist the Courtship of <HI>Leontius? Nicias,</HI> since his coming to his own Country, having tempted me from mine, either despites me as a Stranger, or has received some former commerce, or has abandoned himself to the Debauch; I have little of his Company, and his Kindnesses are both rarer and less agreeable than formerly.
<PB N="32" REF="21"/> What reason is there I should reserve my self for him only, that never gives himself to me, but when he knows not what else to do with himself? None in the World, Madam, re∣plied <HI>Philenis,</HI> no more then that you should fast, when he does not come home to Din∣ner; if he neglects, you must therefore neg∣lect your self: If he has found out other ways of passing his time to his Content, does it oblige you to spend your days in misery and Complaints? Alas, Madam! Life is an uncertain thing, and at the best, those Mi∣nutes of it that are designed by Fate for Happiness, are so few, that to let any of them pass unimployed, is an incorrigible Er∣ror, and a loss that is but meanly recompen∣ced, by the Opinion one gains among those only that are past the relishing of Pleasures. I did not think, says <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> so much rea∣son could be given for Sinning; I thought the most could be said for it, was that passion might excuse Women in Love, as it does Men in Murder: But be it as it will, my heart has betrayed me to <HI>Leontius,</HI> and I blush to think what his success will be at the next as∣sault. It was not long before the diligent Intelligencer sent advice of this to <HI>Leontius.</HI> The hour of his Visit was assigned, and all things so contrived, that he must needs be infinitely happy, if there were as much felici∣ty
<PB N="33" REF="21"/> in fruition as Men fancy to themselves be∣forehand. However these two Lovers were so well satisfied with one another, that they lived in an exact Correspondence; no Jea∣lousies, no Capricious, no little Peeks di∣sturbed good Humour, no unhappy Acci∣dents put them out of their Measures; till <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> weary of so easie delights, took a Freak in her head, and would needs appoint her Gallant a Rendezvous abroad; she told him, she had by accident been at one of the Gardens near the Town, where they sell their Fruit, and the choicest of all sorts, and where was the prettiest Labyrinth for Lovers to lose themselves in that could be imagin∣ed; she desired he would meet her there the next day, an hour before Sun, without any Retinue, that they might not be known; he easily agreed to any thing she proposed, and being a Frollick of her own, she was the earliest up, she and her Woman put on the Dress of the sprucest of those sort of Girls, that carry Fruit among Persons of Quality, at the Theaters and publick Pa∣zades, and with their Baskets on their Arms, went privately out of her Lodgings to the Place appointed; they knockt up the Gar∣diners, and demanded to have entrance, and have such and such Fruits gathered; the Fel∣lows went about what they were directed,
<PB N="34" REF="22"/> and one of them a lusty young Springle, casting his Eye upon these new Customers, and observing a more than ordinary Beauty in them, when he had gathered what he was bid, presented them their Baskets, and <HI>Philenis</HI> looking for Money to pay them, pull'd out a piece of Gold and offered him; but the Youth laying hold of <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> said, he had rather be paid in another Coin, and began rudely to kiss her; whilst they were struggling, <HI>Leontius</HI> came in, but not thinking himself concerned, was walking in, when the Lady called him to her Assistance; he knew the Voice, and turning about with some disorder, advanced in hast towards the Scuffle, which the Fellow perceiving, left off his Rudeness and stept aside, and she addres∣sing her self to him, said, Sir, I had like to have paid too dear for this Fruit, and it is but just I should present it to my Rescuer. He thought he knew the Sound, but the Dis∣guise had so altered the Person, that looking on her as one of the Condition she appeared in, he said, he had no mind to eat any so early, and was turning away from her, when she laid hold of his Arm, and said; Sir, here is somewhat you will have a mind to if you look upon it; this little Importunity, with the Tone in which she spoke, and the Glance of her Eye opened his; <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> says he, I
<PB N="35" REF="22"/> did not think I should have had so dange∣rous a Rival, I must chastise the Insolence of this Fellow; says she; I believe his fear of you has already done that, and his Ignorance may excuse him from any other Punishment; and besides, it's best for us he should be in∣dempnified by that, for we have no desire to be known here; she took him by the hand, and they walked into the Labyrinth, <HI>Philenis</HI> following them at a distance, and after some entertainment there, they return∣ed, and went out of the Garden; he waited on her to the Vineyard behind her Gar∣dens, where, when she was entred, he went of to the Place he appointed his Servants and Chariot to attend him; after he parted from her, he began to reflect upon his Morn∣ings Adventure, he could not conceive her Design, to give her self and him that trou∣ble to no end, but the hazard of giving Scandal; he judged she had not been long enough in the Country, to have used this way of Assignation to other Persons, that had not his Opportunities: he was not at all satisfied with her, and concluded it a light∣ness of mind, which he could not approve of. The young Gardiner <HI>Cornelius,</HI> who after his Fright was a little over, found the relish of the ravished Kisses on his Lips, set himself to watch the two Women and this
<PB N="36" REF="23"/> Gentleman; he followed them at a distance, till he observed where the Women entred, and then returned, with a thousand imaginati∣ons in his Noddle, that a long time after disquieted him. <HI>Leontius</HI> continued his or∣dinary Visits, and the Ladies Charms quick∣ly put away the Disgust he had taken, and he was more in Love then ever; yet a while after it happened, that being engaged in some Affair, that he could not free himself from, he missed an appointment given him; <HI>Nicerotis</HI> spent that time very unquietly, she began to be jealous, that <HI>Leontius</HI> his Passion might be growing cool, or that he had some new Intrigue; she impeached <HI>Philenis,</HI> for so often magnifying his Riches and good Qualities, she accused him of Infidelity, and said, that a Man in his Circumstances, that was guilty of the least neglect, was never to be pardoned, or at least, not till he had suf∣fered ten-fold in the same kind; she threat∣ned him severely, and was going to pass the dreadful Sentence of Indifferency against him; when she checkt her self; well, says she, 'tis folly to determine any thing of him, till I am truly informed of all the Aggravati∣ons of his Crime; if the Expressions of my Resentment be not proportioned to his Of∣fence, he will think me easie to be imposed on, and he will take a Liberty in a short
<PB N="37" REF="23"/> time, to use me as a Wife, which none must ever have a Priviledge to do▪ But <HI>Nicias;</HI> I must know the secret of this Absence, and I will be the Discoverer my self, for you are too much his Friend, to be entirely re∣lied on in the Inquiry. This Evening a new Habit was brought home for the Page, which was ordered against the next ap∣proaching Solemnity; do you send for it into your Chamber, on pretence, that I have directed somewhat to be altered about it, and let that, with the other Accoutre∣ments of such an Officer, be provided ready in the Garden-house, in the Morning, by the dawn of day; I will carry him a Visit, as from my self, and by that Pretence, will learn among his Servants, how he spent this Night. The next day very early, this was put in execution; the Lady was drest in her Pages Habit, left <HI>Philenis</HI> in the Garden-house to attend her Return, and goes to the Palace of the <HI>Exarch,</HI> and coming to <HI>Leon∣tius</HI> his Apartment, she went up into his Anti-Chamber very briskly, where two of the Officers of his Chamber were attending half asleep; but being rouzed by the busling the young Gentleman made, they beckned him to make less noise, which he taking no notice of, advanced in the same manner to them, and desired to be admitted to their
<PB N="38" REF="24"/> Lord, with a Message he had to deliver from the Lady <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> The Officers seeing this Rudeness, told him, they believed he had not been long in the Service of any Person of Quality, or he would have understood better, how he ought to make his Approaches towards them. They said, their Lord went late to Bed, and that none should come in till he call'd; she was incensed at this An∣swer, so little satisfactory to her, to the Point she had given her self so much trouble to be resolved in. She prest between them to the Door, and knockt hard, which made the Gentlemen lay hold of her, to take her away by force, and turn her out of the Pa∣lace; But she struggling with them, made such a stir, that the Lord call'd to know what was the matter? and one going in, he angerly askt what meant that noise, who was told the whole Rudeness of the Page; he ordered his Admittance, and being willing to receive the Message privately, commanded his Servant to stay without and shut the Door. The Struggling had raised a most love∣ly Red in her Face, and so disordered her Hair, that was trust up under a Peruke, that the long Trails of it falling down as she made her Bows, in advancing to the Bed∣side; he needed no other Discovery, but rais∣ing himself in his Bed, he reached out his Arm
<PB N="39" REF="24"/> and pull'd her to him, and embracing her, after a thousand Kisses, told her, Madam, I confess the Crime you come to reproach me with, and declare the commiting it, was it self a cruel Punishment, since it prevented the happiness of seeing you last night. Those are no Punishments, my Lord, says she, which we choose, and since you have chosen other Imployments for that little time you promised to set apart for me, I come to ease you of the trouble of making any Excuses, and to resign back into your hands, all your Obligations and Vows of Perseverance; it is better to bestow Liberty upon the Prisoner that has broke his Chains, than to leave him the Glory of having been his own Deliverer; you shall never have it to boast of, that you have forsaken <HI>Nicerotis;</HI> she was proceeding to more bitterness, when he interrupted her with a Sigh: Ah Madam! says he, you are too sudden, in passing your Judgment on me, before you hear me. It was an unfore∣seen and unresistible Accident that kept me from you, and when you hear it, you will confess that you ought not to be angry with me, unless you will impute Misfortune as a Crime, and believe Punishments were devis∣ed for the Unhappy, not for the Guilty. I was last night invited to a Treat, by some of the Officers of my Army, I do not
<PB N="40" REF="25"/> often engage in those Entertainments, but to endear those brave men, who are ready to venture their Lives at my Command, I some∣times spend an hour or two at the most, chear∣fully with them; the time appointed for this Meeting, and the ordinary measure of my Stay with them, agreed so well with my Ap∣pointment with you, that I could not refuse them; but as we were ready to break up, your Lord came in upon us, either wanting other Company, or being in quest of some of ours. We were all very forward to pay him those Respects that are due to his Qua∣lity, and to the Reputation he justly holds among Souldiers, and a Glass or two going round, had so improved the Humour, he had put himself into some other place, that he would take upon him to give Law to us all, which I would not have allow'd to any body, not so nearly related to you; he pressed so upon us, that without being rude to him, we could not break up, till we all were become as unruly as he, and I believe 'tis not two hours since we parted. This says she (kissing him, rather to try if his Zeal justified his Words, than out of kind∣ness at that time) shall serve for once; but for the future, when any thing is preferrible by you to my Company, I shall believe you begin not to value it. Madam, says he, I
<PB N="41" REF="25"/> refer my self to my future Services, which shall sufficiently clear me of all Suspition; up∣on those terms, I leave you to your Rest, says she, which I perceive is now more ne∣cessary for you, than any further Justificati∣ons, which I refer to our Meeting this Even∣ing: he would have kept her, but she sprang from the Bed-side, and he called his Servants, and commanded the discreetest of them, to wait on that young Gentleman out of the Palace, but first, that they should beg her Pardon for their Incivility to her, and that from thenceforth they should not at any time refuse admittance to any that came from <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> whatever Orders they had given them in the general. She departed pretty well satisfied, and return'd to the Garden-house where <HI>Philaenis</HI> attended her, and the Lord composed himself to rest as soon as he could, for the Reflections he could not avoid to make upon this Adventure; about three hours after, when he was rising, <HI>Polyphon,</HI> one of those Commanders who had been with him over night, came to visit him, and to enquire how he did, after that unusual Skir∣mish he had been engag'd in. He told him, he suffered deeply for that Excess, and was resolved not to allow himself the like Liber∣ty again for any Respect; <HI>Polyphon</HI> told him, it was for want of use, and he would find it
<PB N="42" REF="26"/> to agree with him after a little Practice; I had rather, said <HI>Leontius,</HI> you and the rest of my Friends would find it as inconvenient as I do, for I look upon Drinking, to be a Vice as unbecoming Souldiers as any Pro∣fession whatsoever. My Lord, says he, mer∣rily, that is a Doctrine will hardly obtain a∣mong us, whilst we are out of Action; in time of War 'tis enough to be Sober; in Peace, we have nothing else to do but drink and make Love. Does your Lordship hear nothing of the Emperors Designs this Spring? I heard, said <HI>Leontius,</HI> some Gallies of the <HI>Sarazens,</HI> have contrary to the late Peace, made a Descent on the Coast of <HI>Cilici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and that they are preparing to set out a great Fleet to Sea; but how the Emperor resents it, we do not yet understand. With∣in a few days after, <HI>Leontius</HI> received Or∣ders to repair to Court, to take the Com∣mand of a Squadron of the Fleet, that was preparing to punish the Insolencies of those <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and some days afterwards, he told <HI>Polyphon,</HI> in the Discourse of his Prepa∣rations for his Voyage, that he had been engaged in an Affair of Love, that would have been troublesome to him upon this occasion, if his Passion had not been a little rebated, by some indiscretions of the Person he was engaged with. But, says he, I leave
<PB N="43" REF="26"/> amongst you, one of the most beautiful Per∣sons in the World, and if she were not some∣what so importune, the most agreeable. My Lord, says <HI>Polyphon,</HI> you need not name her, for your Amour has not been as great a Secre∣cy as you imagined, and if you abandon your Interests in her, every one may, with∣out disobliging you, pretend to his own Ad∣vantages.—I am not so ill natured, says <HI>Le∣ontius,</HI> to envy my Friends their good For∣tune, nor so great a Fool, to expect to con∣fine a Humour, that I know hates all Con∣straint. And since I can make her no Assu∣rances of my Return, it is just I should leave her to her own Liberty. This was a suffici∣ent Evidence of an Indifferency, that not long before, all the World could not have convinced him, he should ever be guilty of. The News of the Town, carried the Inti∣mation of his being commanded to Court, before he himself brought it to <HI>Nicerotis;</HI> it put her into a thousand Troubles, which she did not long defer to let him know, for his Affairs having kept him one day from wait∣ing on her, the next Morning he received this Billet from her. <HI>You need not joyn Ʋnkindness with the necessity of your leav∣ing me, the one or the other has Force e∣nough to kill</HI> Nicerotis.

<P>Says <HI>Nicias</HI> to <HI>Glaneus,</HI> I have been told of the Liberty <HI>Polyphon</HI> has taken, in a certain Company, to speak of some Designs he has upon my Wife, and with some dark Reflections upon the Departure of <HI>Leontius;</HI> I am not of a Spirit so weak, as to be subject to Jea∣lousies; or if I were, could so mean a Per∣son be a reasonable Cause of it? yet I think his Impertinence ought not to go unchastised, and I am resolved to take the first occasion that I can, to fix a Quarrel upon him; but to avoid the being talked of, as a jealous Coxcomb, I must have you to begin it, and I will come in as a Second. <HI>Glaneus</HI> was a Person the forwardest in the World, in A∣ctions of that kind; he had passed over many Encounters and Duels, with such success, as made him very haughty, and desirous of getting Honour that way, and on the other side, had warned those that kept him Com∣pany, to be wary in their Conversation, not
<PB N="45" REF="27"/> to give him a Pretence, so that he had lived a long time quiet, and began to obtain the name of a sociable and well conditioned Gen∣tleman; but being put in mind by his Friend, of the way he had formerly so prided him∣self, he presently took Fire, and was all of a Flame, and leaving <HI>Nicias,</HI> told him, he would give him an Account of his Man, be∣fore the next Morning; the rest of the day, he spent in finding out <HI>Polyphon,</HI> who at last he found engaged in Company of Ladies; he could hardly refrain from making the Quarrel there, but he judged that fitter to be done by one that had not a mind to fight, then such a one whose greatest concern it was not to be prevented; yet hardly dissem∣bling his Design, in a huffing away, he askt him where they might meet in the Evening? and being told he would be in such a Com∣pany at a Tavern, he named to him (where they had appointed to play off some pieces of Gold) after some high flown Complements, passed upon the Ladies, <HI>Glaneus</HI> took his leave, and carried his Intelligence to <HI>Nicias,</HI> at the Time and Place named, they found the Company met together, and pretty well advanced in Play; <HI>Polyphon</HI> had lost, and began to be uneasie (as Gamesters for the most part are, when they have had an ill Run, and accusing Fortune on the Dice, and
<PB N="46" REF="28"/> <HI>Glaneus</HI> took the Occasion that he found favourable enough for his Design, and in a rough way of Rallery, excused Fortune, and cast the blame of his Losses upon his Folly, and want of Judgment, and pulling out a hand∣ful of Gold, set it him to throw at, which, as he prepared to do, <HI>Glaneus</HI> took up his Gold, and put it in his Pocket, and ac∣companied this Action with some disrepective Gestures; at which, <HI>Polyphon</HI> being justly provokt, told him, he was not a Person to be so used, and that he must lay down his Money, and after he had try'd his Fortune at that, he must give him satisfaction for the Affront: <HI>Glaneus</HI> scornfully told him, he was not disposed to Play<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at that time, but for what other Satisfaction he expected, he might demand and have it; the other was laying hand on his Sword, when <HI>Aristander</HI> stept to him and held him; whilst <HI>Gephyrius</HI> did the like to <HI>Glaneus,</HI> intending to pacifie them; But <HI>Nicias,</HI> whose Design was to blow the Coal, said, things could not arrive to that height among men of Honour, but they must go further; when <HI>Satirius,</HI> a Per∣son not inferiour to him in Quality, a Friend to <HI>Polyphon,</HI> and as prompt as any of them in the like Adventures, said, he was of his mind, and taking him by the Hand, told him, he should be concerned if he pleased,
<PB N="47" REF="28"/> which the others hearing, quitted one ano∣ther, and presently made a Parley to meet the next Morning on Horse-back, in a Val∣ley, about a Mile distant from the City; having agreed this, to the end they might appear pacified, and take off the Suspitions of the Servants of the House, they drank a Glass or two of Wine to each other, and so parted every one to his own Lodgings, to give Order for their preparation against the next day; by the Dawn they were all moun∣ted, pretending severally, that they were to meet some Country Gentlemen, who had given them notice over night, they had har∣bour'd (<GAP DESC="omitted" REASON="lacuna" RESP="source" DISP="〈 ---------- 〉"/>) a wild Boar in a Wood, about four mile off the Town (another way then that which they had appointed) and that they would be there with their Dogs, and Nets by break of day; they took each of them a Foot-man with his Hunting Spear, and going out several ways, when they came to the foot of a Hill, beyond which was the Place they were to meet at, they placed their Servants, with charge, they should not stir ground till they were called; then they advanced over the Hill, without other Arms then a Horse-mans Sword and a Javelin (the Weapons in that time, only in use in single Combats, fought on Horse-back) they were all Persons of great Courage, and every one
<PB N="48" REF="29"/> striving to be the earliest, they did not stay long one for another. When they were all come, after a few words importing their de∣sire, that they might lose no time in the Dispatch of the Business they were met a∣bout, they every one turned their Horses, and galloping a little distance, wheeled about, and then drawing their Swords, and poising their Javelins, they almost at one instance delivered them; <HI>Aristander,</HI> to his share it fell to fight; <HI>Gephyrius</HI> received his Enemies Javelin in his Bridle-Arm, which piercing the fleshy part of it, and passing between the Skin of his Side, and the Ribs, seemed to have gone through his Body, whilst his Jave∣lin lighted on the Thigh of <HI>Gephyrius,</HI> and piercing it and the Skirts of the Saddle, en∣tred into the Horses side, which so gald him, that he began to plunge; when <HI>Aristan∣der</HI> coming up in his Career, with his Sword elevated, he had had a great advantage over his Adversary, had not the unruliness of the Horse broke all his Girts, and thrown the Rider with the Saddle to the Ground. <HI>A∣ristander,</HI> at this success, was about to have alighted, either to have succoured his Adver∣sary, if he were dangerously wounded, or to have made an end of the Fight on Foot; when looking about, to see what was the Success of the rest of the Parties, he saw
<PB N="49" REF="29"/> <HI>Nicias</HI> and <HI>Satirius</HI> engaged very close with their Swords, dealing their Stroaks with great fury and nimbleness; when <HI>Satirius</HI> by the agility of a well drest Numidian, on which he was mounted, had gain'd the Crooper of <HI>Nicias: Aristander</HI> spying his Friends danger, flew like lightning to his Succour, and presenting his Point to <HI>Satiri∣us,</HI> who stepping short, put himself in his defence against this New-comer, gave <HI>Nicias</HI> the opportunity to turn again upon his Ene∣my; they were then two to one, but were too generous to take the Advantage, yet <HI>Sa∣tirius</HI> pressed them hard, they only defend∣ing themselves, told him, it was fit the Com∣bat should cease, there was enough done to vindicate their Honours, and they did not meet there to butcher one another, but to try their Courage; in this while <HI>Gephirius,</HI> who had drawn the Javelin out of his Thigh, yet not sensible of the loss of Blood, nor wholly disabled by his Wound, came to take part with <HI>Satirius,</HI> and began to attack his first man, who starting a little off, alighted from his Horse, to put himself in e∣qual condition with his Adversary, and as he advanced towards him, <HI>Glaneus</HI> came gal∣loping between them, and calling aloud to <HI>Nicias,</HI> and <HI>Satirius,</HI> desired them to stop their Fury, for <HI>Polyphon</HI> was fallen dead from
<PB N="50" REF="30"/> his Horse, and they were now the greater number, and perhaps there was Blood enough spilt already. At the news of <HI>Polyphons</HI> Fall, they all made a little pause, and <HI>Satirius</HI> looking about, spyed a Party of about twenty Horse, galloping over the Hill. It is not your being three to two, says he, should have prevailed with me, to have quitted you so easily, but that I see more Company coming in to take part with us, than you or I wish. See where a Party comes, pointing that way no doubt, by the Command of the <HI>Exarch,</HI> to seize us; let us mount <HI>Gephirius</HI> on <HI>Polyphons</HI> Horse, and ride away to the Town, to have our Wounds drest, and send the Servants to bring off the Body of <HI>Polyphon.</HI> This being necessary Counsel, and no time of Debate left them, how more ceremoniously they should treat the dead Body they put in execution, and away they gallopt a full Carreer, to the Place where the Ser∣vants were placed, and sent <HI>Gephirius</HI> and <HI>Polyphons</HI> two Men, to bring off the Horse and Body of the Slain; every one hasted to his own Lodgings, and the Condition they were in, required it, they had all of them lost a great deal of blood, and some were dangerously wounded; <HI>Nicias</HI> had several Wounds, but one especially, between two of the Ribs of his left side, that though it did
<PB N="51" REF="30"/> not seem at first to be the most considerable, yet in effect, afterwards it proved of very ill consequence to him. <HI>Aristander,</HI> by the great effusion of Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, and the festering of his Wound, was cast into a Feaver, which kept him a long time fixed to his Bed, and put him in a Condition, that made his Friends fear he would hardly rise out of it. <HI>Nicias</HI> was no sooner drest, but he began to think of the seasonable assistance <HI>Aristander</HI> had brought him, when <HI>Satirius</HI> was at the point to have dispatcht him, and considering he had been the cause of this Quarrel, in which <HI>Aristander</HI> had no concern, but from his ac∣cidental being in the Company, when it was begun, and considering their old Friendship, which had grown up from their Childhood, and his Quality, which was very eminent, he immediately sent a Gentleman to visit him, and to enquire of his Condition: <HI>Aristan∣ders</HI> Wounds were drest, but his loss of Blood had so weakned him, that it was di∣rected by his Physicians, that none should be suffered to come at him, that might give him occasion of spending any of those few Spirits that were left him, so that the Gen∣tleman was fain to return with such Errand as the Chyrurgions would give him. The next morning <HI>Nicias</HI> was very inquisitive of his Friends Condition, and not being satis∣fied
<PB N="52" REF="31"/> with the Account that was given him, he call'd for his Lady, and told her how much she was obliged to his Valour, that had se∣conded him with so much Gallantry, when his Enemy had the advantage of him, and enjoyned her that day to make him a Visit, and to have the same concern for <HI>Aristan∣ders</HI> Recovery, that she had of his: she dis∣charged herself of this Commission very obli∣gingly, and the first time she went to see him, said so many endearing things to him, and so wittily expressed her Resentment, and the Opinion she had of his Courage, that he began to think that Blood was not ill spent, that had purchased him the Acknowledg∣ments of one of the greatest Beauties of the Age. His Wounds were long in healing, and he was longer before he recovered strength enough to go abroad, and perhaps he kept his Chamber longer then he needed, because he would not lose the satisfaction of entertaining her every day for an hour while he did so, and when he was well, he found himself wounded in a more sensible part than his Enemies Sword had reached unto. But <HI>Nicerotis</HI> after a while, thought she lost too much time in this desolate State she was in: during the weakness of her Lord, she was obliged by the Decencies and Rules of a Conjugal State, to pass the whole days in his
<PB N="53" REF="31"/> Chamber, to receive all her Visits there, and could have no Conversation, but what he or the old Lady <HI>Sophonia</HI> his Mother, or some of his Relations were privy to, and the only Visits she was permitted to make, being to <HI>Aristander,</HI> who was not in a Condition to make those warm Addresses that were ne∣cessary to engage a Person of her humour. She resolved to take her satisfaction in any manner she could; she had entertained a little before the Combat, a sprightly young Fellow, in quality of a Footman, who from the time of being entertained in her Service, had expressed all the diligence and observance that was possible; he was of a middle Sta∣ture, well set, active of Body, and of a ruddy Complexion, and when she began to ob∣serve him, she soon perceived that he used to look on her often, with more concern, than Servants of that sort have audacity to do, on Persons of her Rank; she began to think she had seen his Face somewhere before he came into her Family, and this inflamed her Desires, and she began to fancy he might be some Person of better Condition then he ap∣peared, who, overcome by his Passion for her, had in that Disguise, sought to be near her Person. Whilst she flattered herself with this Imagination, she began to find an Inclina∣tion for him, and judging the Opportunity
<PB N="54" REF="32"/> favourable, to shew Pity, as well as to gra∣tifie her own Appetite; One night, as he was called to take the Lights, to carry them before her to her own Apartment, from her Lords, she took occasion to send away her other Attendants, in some Imployments she found for them; when he had set down the Candles, says she with a pleasant Coun∣tenance, and with a Look that might encou∣rage the most timorous Lover; <HI>Cornelius,</HI> I cannot put it out of my thoughts, that I have seen you somewhere, before you came into my service; pray tell me, if I did, on what occasion it was? the young man sur∣prised, between Joy and Fear, at that un∣expected Question, immediately falling on his Knees, said; Madam, you have seen me, but if I tell you the occasion, perhaps you will turn me out of your Service, and then I am undone for ever; I am sure it will cost me my little Wits, if not my Life; for in the Condition I am now, I know not what I do, when I am out of your sight, and am once a day, in the mind to hang my self, but when I think I shall never see you afterwards, I cannot find in my heart to do it. This foolish way of expressing himself, made her lose the Opinion she had conceiv∣ed of his Quality but increased her Curiosi∣ty, to know what he was, and what he
<PB N="55" REF="32"/> meant, and then looking sternly on him, she said, I must know what and from whence you are, or else I shall certainly turn you a∣way to morrow; she heard her Women coming, and therefore commanded him to rise, and resolve to satisfie her the next Morning, when she should send for him, and so dismist him, to hasten <HI>Philaenis</HI> to her, who met her coming into the Chamber as he went out. The next Morning, <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> who, though she had sometime after she went to bed, ruminated on the Answer <HI>Cornelius</HI> mader her, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manner of his expressing himself, could not unriddle the meaning of it; as soon as sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was up, sent for him, and dismissing her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttendants, till she should send for them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to him, you must now give me a true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccount of what I demand∣ed of you last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght, or I shall immediately cause you to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dismissed, with Directions, that if afterw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds you are seen about my House, you sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l be driven away with Cudg∣els.

About two months since I was a Servant to <HI>Melon,</HI> that keeps the great Gardens near the old Laby∣rinth, where attending one morning early, to deliver out Fruits to the Hucksters, who came to buy, there came into the Garden two young Women, drest in the Habits of those Fruit-sellers, that go about among Persons of Quality, but who were much bet∣ter drest, and a thousand times handsomer, than any that ever I saw there before on that business; it was my Fortu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to attend them, and to gather what they call'd for; whilst I was at work, they askt m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so many pretty Questions, and then talked to one another about something I did not understand, but which I perceived made th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m very merry, that I could not but take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otice of them, especially of one who seeme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be the bet∣ter Woman, on whom I had no sooner fixt my Eye, but I found someth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng stick to my heart; when I had delivered t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em the Fruit, I could not forbear to venture to kiss the Person I liked so well, though she refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d me with a great deal of anger. Whilst we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere strugling, a Gentleman came towards us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hreatning me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for my Rudeness; I withdr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w hastily, to decline hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fury, and getting b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ind a Hedg, I observed him to joyn the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Women,
<PB N="57" REF="33"/> and then separating her that I had ingaged with, they walked into a Wilderness, I durst not go too near, to discover what they did, and to overhear what they said; for besides that, I was really afraid of the Gentleman, the other Woman kept that distance from them, that no body could come near enough to observe them, without being first discri∣ed. I watcht notwithstanding till they went out of the Garden, and at a distance followed till I saw the Gentleman put the two Women into your Ladiships Vineyard. All the day-after, and for several others, I could do nothing but think of those two Women, and cast about, how I might know who they were; I concluded they were some of the Maids of your Family, who ap∣pointed to meet this Gentleman, yet I could not rest, till I saw them again; I took all occasions to be about your house, to observe all that went in and out, to seek pretences to come to the Laundry and other Offices of your Family, but could not set eye on the Person I lookt for, till one day thus, as I was standing in the Court, your Ladiship came out to take Coach, talking pleasantly with Madam <HI>Philaenis,</HI> by the sound of your Voice and the air of your Face, I was instantly con∣vinced that you were the Lady I had been so rude to, which struck such a Terrour into
<PB N="58" REF="34"/> me, that as soon as your Chariot was gone, and I could not see it any longer, I came home to my Master, fearing that if you had taken notice of me, I should have been pu∣nished for my sawciness, as I deserved; but I found it was in vain to keep from you, my mind was so imployed in the thoughts of what I had done, and to whom, that I could not follow my work as I was used to do, many Rebukes and some Blows I received from my Master, and in five days, was turned out of my Service, as being become Fool or Mad∣man. It was then much worse with me, and I had not wherewithal to maintain my self, and found no inclination to go to labour, but hanging about this House, not being a∣ble to be from it, nor knowing why I staid here, I happened among your Ladiships Footmen, who were making a Running Match between two of them that disputed which had the best heel; when they ran, I started with them, and being used to con∣stant labour, and so better winded, I beat them both, by which I gained credit amongst them, that in few days I was offered your Ladiships Livery; since then, your Ladi∣ship knows the diligence I have used in my Waiting. Well, says <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> I have pro∣mised you my Pardon, and I must keep my Word; but take care you carry your self so,

I do not envy you that Imployme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, says <HI>Pardelis,</HI> I had rather sleep at night, and not dream of the Devil; besides, are you not afraid of Spirits?

<PB N="61" REF="35"/> <HI>Nicerotis</HI> her temper, had made some un∣succesful Addresses, and therefore was resol∣ved to discover her Intrigues, which he was assured she could not live without. His Spy, soon gave him an Account of this Passage, and his Curiosity pressed him to pry farther into the Affair. He ordered <HI>Pardelis</HI> to get his Lord or Ladies Master-Key, that opened all the Locks of the House and Gar∣dens, and to bring it to him as soon as pos∣sibly he could, and it was not difficult for him to do so: For during <HI>Nicias</HI> his Sick∣ness, his Key had lain on his twi-light, un∣minded of any, which he conveyed the next day to <HI>Zenisces;</HI> the next night he entred the Garden, and came to the Terrace, where he observed <HI>Cornelius</HI> bringing in his Bed and laying down, and soon after, rising in his Shirt, and going into his Ladies Chamber; after a very little pause, he softly opens the Terrace Door, and comes softly into the Chamber to the Bed-side, and opening a Dark-Lanthorn which he had in one hand, with the other opens the Curtains, and views the kind Couple in their Embraces; he made a terrible roaring Noise, the Lady shriekt, and the Footman frighted at the Noise and flash of the Light, as if the Devil were come to take him in the Fact, swound∣ed away; <HI>Zenisces</HI> retired immediately, and
<PB N="62" REF="36"/> locking the Door after him, went off, mali∣ciously laughing to himself at the prank he had plaid, and studying how to improve it, to be revenged for the Neglects and Slights he had received. The noise wakned <HI>Phi∣lenis,</HI> whose Chamber was next her Ladies; she ran in to see what was the Matter, and there found her in her Smock, risen out of her Bed, and pulling the Footman by the Nose, to bring him to Life. O Madam! says she, what is the Matter? Ask me no Questions, says she, but help to pull this Fel∣low away, and carry him to his Bed, the House will be all up presently, and I shall be undone; they pull'd him out by the Hair and the Nose, the violence and falling on the Ground, brought him to himself, and they thrust him out into his own Bed, and bid him lie still, as if he were yet in a Swound, what ever happened. By this time several of the Family were raised, and some running where the Noise was heard (for the Lady and <HI>Philenis</HI> both call'd out as loud as they could) found them in great disorder, complaining of a strange Apparition, which had put them into a terrible Fright; they went to pull up <HI>Cornelius,</HI> but he holding the Cloaths fast about him, cryed, good De∣vil let me alone, do not take me, take my Lady. Which she hearing, and fearing the
<PB N="63" REF="36"/> Fool might make some Confession, bid the Company withdraw, and that <HI>Philaenis</HI> should come to Bed to her; she bid them see if the Terrace Doors were lockt, and make no more noise in the House. <HI>Corneli∣us</HI> hearing these Orders, got up, drest him∣self, and went away to his Fellows Lodgings, and <HI>Pardelis</HI> set up the rest of the night to secure the frighted Lady, who knew the sup∣posed Devil too well, to be afraid of him; the next morning, the House was all in an Uproar; the old Lady <HI>Sophonia</HI> was much scandalized, at her Daughters appointing the Footman to lye in her Anti-Chamber and suspected there was some unhandsome Prank plaid, that would be discovered, to the Dis∣honour of her Family. She spake to <HI>Nicero∣tis,</HI> with some severe Reflections upon her Conduct, which coming from a Mother-in-Law, galled so cruelly, that afterwards she could not endure the gentlest Advice from her.

<P>This Adventure of <HI>Nicerotis</HI> (as we be∣fore hinted) was only a Fiction, invented by the witty Malice of a certain Person, that had prov'd unsuccessful in attempting that Kindness from her, whereof he thought some others were possest. And indeed the Story was contriv'd with so much Art and Humor, that it was presently taken up by the Poetaster of the Times; but by reason that the first inventer of the Tale, reported it under borrowed Names, there was none of them that knew upon what Person to fasten, so that her own Friends and Relati∣ons never suspected her to be concern'd in it. One of these Essays being of a particular Humour from all the rest, and in Vindicati∣on
<PB N="66" REF="38"/> of the Lady, as if the Passages had been really true, we have thought fit to insert it. The Lines were these.</P>

<P>This Apology was lookt upon as tolerable enough, and the severest Criticks cou'd
<PB N="67" REF="38"/> not but allow some, to so generous an Un∣dertaker.</P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Nicias</HI> was so well recovered of his Wounds, that he had been abroad, and more than once made Visits to his Friend <HI>Aristander.</HI> The Intimacy be∣tween them was so great, that their being together, though never so frequently, cou'd seem no wonder; yet <HI>Nicias,</HI> in his latter Conferences, exprest more Importunacy of Affection, than had been observ'd by <HI>Ari∣stander</HI> in his former Friendship. Some weighty Concern seem'd to be working in his thoughts, which he appear'd desirous to have communicated to his Friend, and thought fitting to usher in that Trust he meant to repose in him, with new and more than common Endearments. <HI>Aristander</HI> however was yet in the dark, as to the par∣ticular, and <HI>Nicias</HI> concluded within him∣self, that the properest Advance, would be by first breaking his Design to <HI>Nicerotis;</HI> to whom, in private, with an unusual Zeal, he continually extolls the Merits of his Friend <HI>Aristander.</HI> She was for some time at a loss, concerning his Intention herein, not think∣ing it possible that a Person of his Disposi∣tion, so nice in his Honour, and sensible of his Ladies extraordinary Beauty, could ever in the least sollicite her, to confer the enjoy∣ment
<PB N="68" REF="39"/> of such Sweets on any but himself. She wanted not various Reflections hereup∣on, and that he hereby made but an Essay of her Virtue, yet the Importunity with which he prest her, convinc'd her at last that he was in earnest. <HI>Aristander</HI> was not want∣ing in Accomplishments, that might charm a Lady of more reservedness than <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> Yet this Sollici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation coming from her Hus∣band, provokt her to extream Rage, what∣ever her own Inclination might have been; yet this Entreaty seeming to express in him less esteem of the Beauty he enjoy'd, than it deserv'd, made his demand most displeasing to her; insomuch that out of Revenge of his Contempt (as she judg'd it) and the easie∣ness of his Temper, as Love was no hard Task to her, she really admits a Passion for <HI>Aristander.</HI> In order to this Affair, she contracts an intimate Acquaintance with his Wife <HI>Eubea,</HI> a Lady of such Sincerity and Innocence in her self, and so free from Cen∣sure of others, with many more such good Dispositions, as every way qualified her for a Friend.</P>
<P>One Afternoon, in the freedom of Dis∣course, amongst other Arguments, they spent some Talk on the Nature and Effects of Love; which of all Passions, had this Qua∣lity particular to it self, that it was of no
<PB N="69" REF="39"/> less difficulty to create it where it was not, than to extinguish it where it had once ta∣ken fire. Several Tragical Instances of the former were repeated by <HI>Eubea;</HI> in the Conclusion whereof, <HI>Nicerotis</HI> bursting forth into Tears, cries out, Let the Misfortunes of Antiquity sleep in silence; our own Age a∣bounds too much with sad Examples of this nature, and amongst them all none more wretched than <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> I know not (said she) whether the Privation of Happiness, ought really to be accounted misery, but what shall we say, when the Disappoint∣ment of that is attended with the most in∣sufferable and incurable Evils? such, my <HI>Eu∣bea,</HI> is the state of disappointed Love; where the Unhappy are not only deprived of that Paradise which was presented to their Ima∣gination, and left to their primitive free∣dom, but with the utmost severity of for∣tune, condemn'd to loath'd Embraces. It is not enough for the rendring of a Conjugal State happy, that the Person to whom we give our Vows, has all the Endowments of Art and Nature to make him amiable, unless our Breasts are disengag'd from any other Passion, for that will be sure to maintain the Fort against the bravest Assailants, and in spight of all Attempts that our Prudence can make, to suppress the Remembrance of it,
<PB N="70" REF="40"/> will often return upon us, to the Disturbance of our Quiet.</P>
<P>It cannot be deny'd, that the Birth and Education, the many natural and acquired Excellencies of the Lord <HI>Nicias,</HI> were such, as wou'd have blest any Breast but mine, and that I perhaps was the only person, whom so accomplisht a Man cou'd have made un∣happy. Take my <HI>Eubea,</HI> this Confession, for the greatest Instance of Friendship to your self, as it is the Argument of greatest sorrow to me. <HI>Nicias,</HI> though destin'd for my Husband, came yet too late for a Lo∣ver. My Heart had been before, without the least reserve, dispos'd off to young <HI>Phi∣lanthus,</HI> nor was my Conquest over his, less entire. It was the first time that either of us had been sensible of Love; and as first Desires are generally most violent, I am confident that no Transports ever equall'd ours. Besides the Advantages of his Edu∣cation, and the singular Charms of his Per∣son, which sate upon him without the least Affectation, such was the agreeableness of his Conversation, and every way so suited to my Inclination, that I could not perswade my self, but that we were born for each o∣thers happiness. It is impossible to express the Satisfaction we took in each others Com∣pany; and though our Opportunities of
<PB N="71" REF="40"/> meeting were frequent, yet every parting was with such regret, that we even envy'd our selves those delightful Minutes, we were before so impatient to be possest of. No∣thing was now wanting to compleat our Joy, but the Consent of our Friends, which we had no reason to despair of; for beside the Equality of our Fortune, it had been an eternal Tye of the Amity that had long been between the two Families. And indeed the Prudence, as well as the Kindness of our Parents was herein exerted, in that they con∣ceal'd as much as they cou'd, their designing a Match between us, to make it seem as much as cou'd be, the effect of our own Choice and free Inclination, which was likely to have made it much more easie to us, than if it had seemed of their imposing. <HI>Philanthus</HI> was now taking resolution to acquaint his Parents with his Passion, when the safety of the Publick was threatned, by a most suddain and unexpected Disturbance from the <HI>Sara∣zens,</HI> who came with all their Naval Force to surprize us in our Security, as depending upon the late Peace that was solemnly con∣cluded on between us. <HI>Philanthus</HI> was now of those years, in which several of his An∣cestors had signaliz'd their Courage; a∣mongst whom, none was ever absent from the Service of his Country in any publick
<PB N="72" REF="41"/> Action; nor could he be prevail'd with, to degenerate from their Example on this occa∣sion. To which, notwithstanding all the Cautions that a tender Mistress cou'd repeat to a Lover, whom Youth and Ambition might betray to utmost danger, I parted from him with all the Violence of a Prophe∣tick Sorrow, while he was possest with no less confidence of Success. Our Residence was on the Borders of the Sea, and the En∣gagement of the Fleets not many Leagues from the Coast. The Dispute continued for almost three days, two whereof were con∣sum'd by me, in watching from the Clifts, where he and I had been wont to view the Sea, and enjoy the Calmness of the Ev'nings. On the third Morning, I cou'd perceive the Fleets make further and further off to Sea, by which I knew our Ships had the <HI>Sara∣zens</HI> upon the Chace. This was the first time I could endure to withdraw my Eyes from them, when casting them down to the Foot of the Rock, I was saluted with the most lamentable Object that ever wretched Maid beheld; the Body of my Lover brought in a Boat to the Shore. Think my <HI>Eubea,</HI> if possible, what Agonies that Spectacle must have struck me with, and what Effects it was likely to produce. Spare, spare me the Remembrance of those sorrowful Hours
<PB N="73" REF="41"/> that ensu'd, and the mournful Reflections of my Despair, upon the happy Minutes we had pass'd together; the thousand endearing Words with which he used to charm my Soul into his Breast; which now, all forsaken and disconsolate, I in vain repeated to the Rocks and Shades, where we were wont to converse. It was no wonder, if now I grew indifferent, which way I was disposed on for the future, and unconcern'd, to whose share this little Beauty fell, when <HI>Philanthus</HI> was cut off from possessing it. It was at this time, that <HI>Nicias</HI> made his Application, and prest for Marriage with me, which I sub∣mitted to, being tired with the Importuni∣ty of my Parents, who presum'd it the best expedient that could be, to bring forget∣fulness of what had happen'd. I am con∣fident, that <HI>Nicias,</HI> his Passion for me, was for a long time what he pretended, and ac∣cordingly I apply'd my self to make him all possible Returns of Duty, which even the Eyes of Jealousie and Envy cou'd never di∣stinguish from the sincerity of Affection, which in time became indeed advanc'd to that degree of Kindness, that few Wives are possest with, for the Husbands of their own choosing. It was at this unseasonable time that <HI>Nicias</HI> began to take a Surfeit of his Happiness, when indeed, I ought to have
<PB N="74" REF="42"/> been more dear to him than ever; but such is the Choice or Fate of Mankind, to pur∣sue with eagerness those Blessings that shun them, and to fly from them that pursue. I could perceive by many Instances, the cold∣ness and indifferency of his Carriage towards me, nor was it long, before I understood that <HI>Thalassa's</HI> Charms had occasion'd this Change; and if any thing could have been an excuse for broken Faith, her extraordinary Beauty would even have justified the Fals∣hood. He took all possible occasions of making her acquainted with his Passion, and at last became so importunate with her, that in her own Defence (being a Lady of strict Virtue) she was forc'd to acquaint me <HI>Nicias</HI> his Addresses to her, and askt my Di∣rections, what course to take for my Interest, and her own Quiet. Notwithstanding my In∣dignation at the hearing of this, I returned her my thanks, and told her, that to com∣pleat the Obligation, she must feign a Com∣pliance with <HI>Nicias,</HI> when he next came to sollicite her, and to make him an Appoint∣ment at such time and Place, that I might, unknown to him, supply her Room. This was several times performed by the dis∣guising of my Voice, and the Darkness of the Apartments. With what Transport did he meet those Embraces, for which he
<PB N="75" REF="42"/> shew'd so much Indifference at home? Di∣vine <HI>Thalassa,</HI> said he, I was never acquain∣ted with Bliss till this Minute; dull mistaken <HI>Nicias,</HI> that cou'd ever imagine that he tasted Delight in the Arms of <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> I was before scarce able to contain with Rage, and now with Laughter. At our parting he immediately went towards home, yet not so soon but that I made a shift to reach the House, and bestow my self on a Couch, be∣fore he arriv'd at his entring of the Cham∣ber. You must imagine (continued she) what Sentiments this Discovery possest me with, and my uneasiness was the greater, be∣cause I had as yet reserved the Trouble within my own Thoughts, nor so much as once in express Words, let <HI>Nicias</HI> under∣stand, that I was sensible of his Falshood; it is therefore no wonder, if at this time, my Friends observ'd in me an unusual Re∣servedness and Melancholy. All this Rela∣tion was delivered by <HI>Nicerotis</HI> with so much tenderness, that <HI>Eubea</HI> was extreamly toucht, having a Heart and Temper apt for all those Impressions that are felt in a Passio∣nate Friendship, which she possest in the highest degree for <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> However, she thought that condoling with her on this Argument, might only give her a greater sense of her Misfortune; she therefore judg∣ed
<PB N="76" REF="43"/> it more prudent to pacifie her what she cou'd, and above all things counselled her, to suffer nothing to be occasion of breach between her Husband and her. And in∣deed, such was the singular goodness of her Temper, that she w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a constant Reconci∣ler, when any Diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rence happen'd between them. Being therefore possest with so great a Kindness for <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> and so high an O∣pinion of her Virtue, it is not to be won∣dered at, that she had not the least Jealou∣sie of the Inclination she had entertained for <HI>Aristander,</HI> and of which he was now sen∣sible by several Instances. It was impossi∣ble for the strictest Virtue to be insensible of <HI>Nicerotis</HI> Charms; yet there were so many complicated Reasons against his indulging any such Thought (and chiefly, his Friend∣ship with <HI>Nicias</HI>) that he was resolved to pursue no Advantage that might offer it self, but to shun all Occasions that might lead thereunto. <HI>Nicias</HI> (as was before hinted) had in later Conferences with him, expressed more importunate Friendship than formerly, as it were, to prepare for consi∣derable Trust that he intended to repose in him, though as yet he had not expresly communicated it to him. However, he was so far proceeded in it, that he had already engaged <HI>Aristander</HI> in the whole care of his
<PB N="77" REF="43"/> Affairs, which he at first scrupled, not as being an act of Friendship, and for several specious Reasons which <HI>Nicias</HI> gave him for so doing: Yet finding after a little Experi∣ence, that it might minister opportunities of any Amour with <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> or occasion any Difference between himself and <HI>Eubea,</HI> he wholly declined the Management of <HI>Ni∣cias</HI> his Concerns, on Pretences plausible enough, without informing him of the true Cause. This Cessation notwithstand∣ing was but of short continuance; for <HI>Ni∣cias</HI> his ill Adventures in the Duel, together with private Discontents, and other Misfor∣tunes, reduced him to such Indisposition of Body, that to recover his Health, it was ab∣solutely necessary for him to leave that Country, and remove to a more agreeable Climate. So that now in the height of <HI>A∣ristanders</HI> satisfaction, which he took in hav∣ing so handsomely disengaged himself from the Management of his Friends Concerns, without disobliging him in the refusal, whereby he thought himself free from all occasion and temptation towards any In∣trigue with <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> which for the Reasons we have exprest, he was resolved to de∣cline; at the very time (I say) that he was most pleasing himself with these Reflections, he was unexpectedly acquainted with the
<PB N="78" REF="44"/> News of <HI>Nicias</HI>'s sudden departure from that Place, and could by no means believe it, till he was confirmed of it by this Let∣ter, directed to himself.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MY Departure to another Countrey, with∣out any Leave taken of so dear a Friend as <HI>Aristander,</HI> must possess him with no little Surprize; But by all the sincerity of our Friendship, I conjure you not to im∣pute that to Ʋnkindness, which is the Re∣sult of Discontent: I leave your self to judge how afflicting that trouble must be, which I would make any scruple of commu∣nicating to <HI>Aristander.</HI> The Griefs with which I labour, would extort Pity from an Enemy; what influence then would they have upon you? no, my Friend, I will be more tender of your Quiet, then to wound you with the Knowledge of them; and thus far acquaint you with them, only to engage you to the performance of what I have to re∣quest. My VVife and my whole Concerns I leave to your care; I am sensible of the Bur∣then I lay upon you, but to accept of trouble, is the Office of a Friend, such I have found you in the highest Degree, and know, that beside the Consideration of Friendship, you undetake here∣in a Kindness to the Miserable.</P>
</LETTER>
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
<P><HI>Aristander</HI> read over these Lines several times, and still found himself more and more astonisht with the Contents. The Disorder in the Expression, and the matter they con∣tain'd, sufficiently confirm'd him, how great Trouble and Difficulty his Friend labour'd under, at the writing of them, and was not a little afflicted, that he was in no possibili∣ty (by reason of his Absence) of admi∣nistring such Counsel or Relief, as his Kind∣ness might inspire him with, on such an Oc∣casion. But having sufficiently condoled within himself the Miseries with which <HI>Ni∣cias</HI> was opprest, he perceiv'd himself again inevitably involv'd in the Management of his Concerns, and consequently the same Inconveniencies and Apprehensions return'd upon him, for which he so industriously de∣clin'd that Office before. His doubts and perplexity hereupon were so great, that his Uneasiness was presently observ'd by <HI>Eubea,</HI> who extreamly prest him to discover the Cause. All the Account that he gave her, was his Sorrow for his Friends so sudden Removal, and the Unsetled Posture in which he had left his Affairs. I condole (reply'd <HI>Eubea</HI>) as much as possibly you can do, any Misfortune of the Lord <HI>Nicias,</HI> o∣therwise I should very ill deserve that Degree of Friendship, which I am favour'd with by
<PB N="80" REF="45"/> <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> The smallest Concern of his, whilst out of his own Power ought to be of great importance to you, but espe∣cially his dearest part, the destitute <HI>Nicero∣tis,</HI> must be your principal Care. Let me therefore conjure you, as I have any share in your Affection, to contribute all that possibly you can to the diverting of her Grief, and making her Trouble sit easie up∣on her. These Arguments, and whatever else could possibly be insisted on by <HI>Eubea,</HI> in behalf of her Friend <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> were urged by her with all the earnestness that could be. <HI>Aristander</HI> notwithstanding made her no sudden Answer, being wholly taken up with contemplation on this Adventure, and yet could not but smile secretly at <HI>Eu∣bea's</HI> pressing Sollicitation, being conscious to himself, that his Aversion to engage in <HI>Nicerotis</HI> Affairs, was not out of any want of kindness to her, but meerly a Principle of justice, and most especially towards <HI>Eu∣bea.</HI> He was now sensible by many instan∣ces, that an Address from him to <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> was likely to meet with small Opposition; nor was he willing to venture on such Op∣portunities of making Advances that way, as the whole Management of her Concerns must needs offer to him.</P>

<P>And though an Attempt of that kind might seem inconsistent with a generous Nature in any Circumstances, yet the pre∣sent Distress which his Friend lay under, and the Confidence he had reposed in him at this time, made every thought that might have a tendency that way, with the utmost Resolution rejected by him. However, <HI>Eubea</HI> was so restless in her Entreaties, and the disconsolate Condition of his Friend were so prevailing, that he could not but comply with his Desire, in espousing intirely the Care of his Wife and Fortunes, and by this means, to be under necessity of frequent Conversation with <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> She was not displeased herewith, nor was it less to the satisfacti∣on of <HI>Eubea,</HI> who was never better con∣tented, than when <HI>Nicerotis</HI> and <HI>Aristan∣der</HI> were in Company with each other.</P>
<P>Some considerable time passed over in this manner, while <HI>Aristander,</HI> with all the sincerity of a faithful Friend, and with much industry, performed the Charge that was left upon him. <HI>Eubea</HI> continu∣ing still without the least Jealousie, and infinitely pleased, to find the Trust re∣posed in her Husband, discharged with so much advantage to <HI>Nicerotis. Nicias,</HI> in the mean time, after much weakness, and
<PB N="82" REF="46"/> increase of his Indisposition, was at last recovered to that seeming degree of health, as to think of adventuring back again to his own Country, where he found, upon all Accounts, the good effects of his Friends careful Management; nor was <HI>Ari∣stander</HI> less pleased at having had oppor∣tunity of being serviceable to him at a time of distress: but withal, for the Con∣siderations we have exprest, was well e∣nough contented to be disengaged from his Imployment, and to resign his Office into <HI>Nicias</HI> his own Hands. <HI>Nicias</HI> could not but accept of the Surrender, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing now in a Condition to excuse his F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nd from the trouble; yet <HI>Aristander</HI> perceived a secret reluctancy in him, on the removal of his Affairs out of his hands, and seemed inclinable, that not only his Fortunes but his Wife should still be under <HI>Aristanders</HI> Care. Howe∣ver, not being very express therein at that time, <HI>Aristander</HI> once more, thought himself totally exempted from that Office, and from danger or inconvenience that might occur thereby. This Respite again was but of short Continuance, for <HI>Nicias</HI> relapsing into a worse Condition than e∣ver, once more entreats his Friends Go∣vernment and Conduct in his Business,
<PB N="83" REF="46"/> which was accepted as formerly by <HI>Ari∣stander.</HI> After this re-engagement, <HI>Nicias</HI> seemed every day increase in his Endear∣ments and Amity towards his Friend; but still labouring with some secret, which he was restless to communicate unto him. One Evening, being something more than ordinary refresht in his Spirits, when none were present besides his Wife and <HI>Ari∣stander,</HI> after silence for some minutes, with a Smile, he uttered these Words. The Love (said he) of Parents to their own Off-spring is the practice of all the World, and has been so in all Ages; yet I can∣not but reflect with some wonder, how a Custom should prevail so upon all man∣kind, without any one rational Cause to enforce it. The oddness of this Assertion, and the abrupt manner of his introducing it, put <HI>Nicerotis</HI> and <HI>Aristander</HI> into a pause, till <HI>Aristander</HI> made this Reply. It should (said he) rather be a Wonder (as the greatest Crime against nature and de∣viation from common sense) to find that Parent, that were void of Love towards his own Issue. I grant you (proceeded <HI>Nicias</HI>) that a Descent of kindness to po∣sterity is most natural; but from whence that Distinction should proceed, the great difference of Affection between the Off-spring
<PB N="84" REF="47"/> of our own Bodies, and other mens, especially of Kindred and Friends, is to me, altogether unaccountable; for it is plain (continued he) that it is not the personal Merit, the intrinsick Virtues and Qualifications which our Children may happen to be endowed with, that engages our Love towards them; for we often find them far excelled upon these accounts, by the Off-spring of others, for whom, yet we are possest with no such fondness, and what other Consideration should lead a reasonable man to such partiality, is past my understanding. You will not certainly (said <HI>Nicerotis</HI>) dispute the Prudence of a Practice which nature (that is the supream eternal Reason) in∣spires; besides, if it were not the Effect of an Instinct that reigns through the whole Creation, yet what can be more agreea∣ble to common Equity, than for Parents to have particular care and indulgence for those Persons, of whose Beings (next to Providence) they were the immediate Authors▪ To say nothing of these duti∣ful Retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which ought, and for the most p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt are paid by Children to them a∣gain, there is yet methinks (replies <HI>Ni∣cias</HI>) a poorness of Spirit, and something of a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>id selfishness, in fondness of our
<PB N="85" REF="47"/> own Products, more than those of a Friend. It is evidently the nature of friendship, in perfection, to hold our friend in equal value with our selves, nay, even to submit our own Interest and De∣sires to his; if therefore my Friend appear to me of such merit, as to claim Affecti∣on from me, equal to what I have for my self, I know not why I should not be as fond of his Likeness as my own. Why should not the same reasoning hold in the Copy, as in the Original? And why the Son of that Person whom I hold dearer than my self, should not be dearer to me, than one that sprung from my self, I cannot comprehend? and that my Friendship for <HI>Aristander,</HI> is elevated to that Degree I must needs acknowledge. These last Expressions of <HI>Nicias,</HI> put <HI>A∣ristander</HI> and <HI>Nicerotis</HI> to the Blush, who knew not how to reply on this occasion; for they could not take notice of the Consequence that must necessarily follow, from what <HI>Nicias</HI> had said. He plainly exprest it his judgment, that the Child of a Friend, should be dearer to him than his own, and that <HI>Aristander</HI> was that Friend, and they were also sensible, that towards such a Birth, he included his own Wife. The Right of a Husband (proceeded he) in
<PB N="86" REF="48"/> his own Wife, is indisputable, and certain∣ly, it is the foulest Violation of Justice, to invade any man in that Tenure; but Consent removes all notion of Injury, and to say that a Man has not disposal of that Possession, as he shall think fit, is to say, he has less Right in his Wife, than in his meanest Chattels; if therefore a Husband, by any Misfortune or Irregula∣rity, should think himself uncapable of Off-spring in his own Person, I know not why the Wife should therefore be de∣frauded from the comfort of Children. Therefore in such Circumstances (especial∣ly where the having an Heir is requisite) if by Consent, the Friend supplies the Of∣fice of the Husband, it is so far from be∣ing an Injury, that it must be esteemed an Obligation. These Arguments were delivered by <HI>Nicias,</HI> with so firm a Coun∣tenance, and such an earnestness in his Eyes, as plainly discovered his Intention by this Discourse, and that he desired his Wife and <HI>Aristander</HI> to take it, with particular application to themselves; and that the breaking this Design to them, was the Difficulty that had so long made him uneasie, and towards which, he had so often made imperfect Attempts. Hav∣ing therefore after this manner exprest
<PB N="87" REF="48"/> himself (fixing his Looks most eagerly up∣on them) he sate expecting their Reply. But still, the more plainly that his Drift was understood, the greater the Confusion appeared in them.</P>
<P><HI>Nicerotis</HI> was far from an Aversion to <HI>Aristander,</HI> and she was by her Constituti∣on, no Enemy to Variety (besides her be∣ing desirous enough of Children, and in no probability of having any by <HI>Nicias</HI>) yet, whether she thought that this Proposal of her Husbands, savoured something of Neglect towards her, though under pre∣tence of Justice to her, or whether she thought her self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bliged in Modesty to re∣sent (at least in appearance) so unexpect∣ed a Charge, there was thereupon, a great Change of Colour, and Combat of Passi∣ons in her Face. <HI>Aristander</HI> laboured with no less difficulty; for all the plausible Reasons that <HI>Nicias</HI> alledged, could not convince him, but that there was too much injustice in such a Practice.</P>
<P>The Conference was here broken off, by the approach of a Visitant, who was not to be denied. It was the Lady <HI>Do∣riska,</HI> one that scorned to suffer time to have his usual triumph over Persons of her years, notwithstanding which, she still retained all the Mirth and Gaity of her
<PB N="88" REF="49"/> youthful Humour. Her Inclination had always been for Company and Treats, and never so well satisfied as when she saw the Affairs of Love going forward; if she could therein make her Endea∣vours serviceable to a Friend, it was so much the more to her Content; but ra∣ther than see a fair Opportunity lost, and stand out, when Action offered it self, she would not refuse obliging a Stran∣ger. In the mean time, <HI>Aristander</HI> is wholly at a loss, how to behave himself in this Adventure. And after through consideration, once more resolves upon wholly leaving <HI>Nicerotis</HI> Company, but is again prevented by the Sollicitations of his Wife. <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> however was resolv∣ed not utterly to lose the Advantage that offered it self by this freedom. She therefore perceiving this Method so satis∣factory to her Husband, contrives all Opportunities she can of meeting with <HI>Aristander.</HI> Therefore as a fit Expedient herein, she betakes her to <HI>Doriska</HI> for her assistance and direction, as it were to an Oracle, and the more, as knowing her to have some intimacy with <HI>Aristan∣der.</HI> The Matron return'd her many Complements, for the Opinion she exprest of her Judgment, and the Confidence she
<PB N="89" REF="49"/> was pleased to repose in her readiness to serve her; and I hope (said she) I can give a more reasonable account of my time and experience, than not to be able to direct any Friend that shall apply themselves to me for Counsel in the Pro∣vince of Love. <HI>Nicerotis</HI> smiled to her self, and proceeded to say, it would be the most injurious thing in the World, not to allow her Ladiship an extrordina∣ry Talent in the Conduct of Amour. After this, she freely imparted to her the sub∣stance of the late Discourse that past be∣tween <HI>Nicias,</HI> and <HI>Aristander</HI> and her self. The Matron again appeared extreamly satisfied with the Matter, with many poli∣tick Remarks upon it, but above all, ap∣plauded the Sentiments and Resolves of <HI>Nicias;</HI> and amongst other things (said she) the wisest Records of Antiquity will be found to be of his side. Let us go no farther for Instance, than the Confines of our own Country of <HI>Greece;</HI> what Com∣mon-wealth can boast of a Continuance like that of <HI>Lacedaemon?</HI> and what could pro∣duce such duration, but the prudence and po∣licy of those sanctions that were in∣stituted by the wise <HI>Lycurgus?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch <HI>in</HI> Vitâ Ly∣curgi.</NOTE> a∣mongst which, I will be bold to affirm the great Latitude permit∣ted
<PB N="90" REF="50" MS="y"/> to Wives in extraordinary Cases, to have been of most important Advantage, where the Person substituted to him that was incapacitated, was not only reputed to perform a Kindness to his Friend, but likewise a most laudable Service to the State.</P>
<P>This learned Discourse of the old Lad∣dies, and the Zeal with which she ex∣prest her self, gave no small Diversion to <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> Nor she think bare Counsel sufficient, for one that pretended friend∣ship, without shewing her self active too in her Service. She therefore so con∣trived Matters, that <HI>Aristander</HI> was by her means, often brought into her Com∣pany; but being at length sensible that it was all to no effect, she reflected with some indignation, to have her Labours defeated, and however took resolution within her self, not to see so fair an opportunity utterly lost. She knew there wanted not Lovers that would think themselves happy in such Advanta∣ges, and therefore cast about to bestow her Endeavours, where the Benefit might be received with gratitude. In the mean time, the Visits that she made and receiv∣ed from <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> were very frequent. She was so far from being past the Re∣lish
<PB N="91" REF="50"/> of youthful Diversions and Enter∣tainments of Mirth, that she was fre∣quently the Life of the Company; and where-ever she was present, triumpht over Melancholy, both in her self and others. <HI>Nicerotis</HI> and <HI>Aristander,</HI> had always found a great agreeableness in each others Com∣pany, and the perplexity of her Affairs, had often made it necessary. Yet as much as they delighted in retired Conversati∣on together, <HI>Doriska</HI> still brought so much easiness and good humour along with her, that her coming was seldom unwelcome; and if the Nicety of his Friendship could have dispensed with what was proposed, it would have been extreamly to her Content; but finding still that a harm∣less Correspondence was the utmost of his Design, she thought such poor Advances un∣worthy a Patroness of her Politicks, and so giving him wholly over, looks out for a new Adventurer.</P>
<P>And it so fell out at this time, that a young Spark that was her Kinsman, had entertained no small Passion for <HI>Nicero∣tis,</HI> and (having observed the intimacy be∣tween them) was encouraged to apply himself to his Kinswoman for her As∣sistance. The Proposal was readily enough embraced by her, who engaged in a short
<PB N="92" REF="51"/> time to bring his Desires to effect, or forfeit her Conduct in Affairs of Love for ever. The young Gentleman was ex∣treamly transported with her Answer, and whatever Difficulties he might apprehend, he had good confidence in so skilful a Guide. She therefore immediately bestirs her in his behalf, with so much Craft and good Management, that (as Circumstances stood) she would not have fail'd of suc∣cess with a Lady of more reservedness than <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> The Business in short was so well agreed amongst them, that he is kindly received, and almost continually in private with her, <HI>Aristander</HI> in the mean time, appearing in publick, both as her Friend to her Husband, and her Protector. It must be imagined, that he soon found it very uneasie for him, to be Patron to these Practices, yet was uncertain what course to take, being cordially a Friend to <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> and unwilling to do any thing that might prove prejudicial to her Reputation. But there appearing no like∣lyhood of Discountenance of this Intrigue, he could not longer bear to have his Pro∣tection made a Property, and thereupon discovers the whole truth of the Matter to his Wife <HI>Eubea,</HI> informing her withal, that it was requisite for her to break off
<PB N="93" REF="51"/> her Acquaintance with <HI>Nicerotis. Eubea</HI> was very difficult at first, to believe any thing to the Prejudice of her Friends Re∣putation, yet being at length convinc'd thereof, she judged it altogether necessary to cease from conversing with her. She made choice by way of Letter to acquaint her with her Resolution, and that in the mildest Terms she could express her self. <HI>Nicerotis</HI> however fell into all the Violence of Passion at the Perusal, yet as she wanted not tenderness of Temper and Art of Expres∣sion, she sent her this Reply.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>I</HI> Am sorry that our Conversation is re∣duced to Letters, and that this is like∣ly to be the last of that kind too. The Thoughts of losing your Friendship for e∣ver, strikes me with unspeakable surprize, yet my happiness in possessing it, was so great, that I might without Prophecy, long since have concluded it was not always to be en∣joyed; but this is not the only ill Treat∣ment I have received at Fortunes hands, and <HI>Eubea</HI> well knows, that it is not the first, though the greatest Affliction of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Nicerotis.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<PB N="94" REF="52"/>
<P><HI>Eubea</HI> read over these Lines with Tears, and summoned all her good Nature in her Excuse, and particularly reflected on the Relation she had formerly given, of her un∣happy Disappointment in her first Love, and imputed altogether to that Misfortune, any frailty that she might afterwards fall into. <HI>Aristander</HI> in the mean time was no less afflicted, his Kindness for <HI>Nicerotis</HI> was so great, that it was as much as he could do to contain it within the Bounds of Friendship; he was not insensible of her Beauty, and he always thought the pleasure he possest in her Conversation, a sufficient Recompence for any Toil or Dif∣ficulty in the Management of her Affairs. So that his Uneasiness and Melancholy for being deprived of her Company, was al∣together as great, as if he had indulged himself in all the freedom of a Lover, and perhaps the innocent manner of their conversing together (as it was more re∣fin'd and generous) so it gave something of delight and endearment beyond the grosser sense. He seemed wholly at a loss within himself, and with many a Sigh visit∣ed the Walks, that had so often been the pleasant Scenes of their Discourse. On the other side, the Discontent and Grief where∣with <HI>Nicerotis</HI> was possest, proved of longer
<PB N="95" REF="52"/> continuance than could be expected from a Person of her airy humour, and it was as much as all <HI>Doriska's</HI> Art and Gaity could do, to bring her to any tolerable Quiet.</P>
