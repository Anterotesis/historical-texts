<HEAD>The Isle of <HI>Pines,</HI> Or a late Discovery of a fourth Island in <HI>Terra Australis, Incognita.</HI> Be∣ing a true Relation of certain <HI>English</HI> persons, who in the dayes of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> making a Voyage to the <HI>East India,</HI> were cast away, and wracked upon the Island near to the Coast of <HI>Terra Australis, Incognita,</HI> and all drowned, except one man and four women, whereof one was a <HI>Negro.</HI> And now lately <HI>Anno dom. 1667.</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship driven by foul weather there, by chance have found their posterity (speaking good <HI>English</HI>) to amount to ten or twelve thousand persons, as they sup∣pose.

<P>AWay to the East <HI>India's</HI> being lately discovered by Sea, to the South of <HI>Affrick</HI> by certain <HI>Portugals,</HI> far more safe and profitable then had been heretofore; certain <HI>English</HI> Merchants encouraged by the great advantages arising from the Eastern commodities, to settle a Factory there for the advantage of Trade. And having to that purpose obtained the Queens Royal Licence <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1589. 11. or 12. <HI>Eliz.</HI> furnisht out of those parts four Ships, my Master being sent as Factor to deal and Negotiate for them, and to settle there, took with him his whole Family, (that is to say) his Wife, and one son of about twelve years of age, one daughter of about fourteen years, two maid ser∣vants, one <HI>Negro</HI> female slave, and my self, who went under him as his Book-keeper, with this company on Monday the
<PB N="2" REF="3"/><HI>third of</HI> April <HI>next following; (having all necessaries for House-keeping when we should come there, we emberqued our selves in the good ship called the</HI> India Merchant, <HI>of about four hundred and fifty Tuns burthen, and having a go it wind, we on the fourteenth of</HI> May <HI>had sight of the</HI> Canaries <HI>and not long after of the Isles of</HI> Cape Vert <HI>or</HI> Verd, <HI>where taking in such things as were necessary for our Voyage, and some fresh Previsions we stearing our course South, and a point East, about the first of</HI> August <HI>came within sight of the Island of St.</HI> Hellen, <HI>where we took in some fresh water, we then set our forces for the</HI> Cape <HI>of good Hope, where by Gods blessing after some sickness, whereof some of our Company died, though none of our Family: and hitherto we had met with none but calm weather, yet so it pleased God, when wer were almost in sight of St.</HI> Laurence <HI>an Istand so called, one of the greatest in the world, as Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> overtaken and dispersed by a great storm of wind, which continued, with such violence many dayes, that loosing all hopes of safety, being out of our own knowledge, and whether we should fall on Falts or Ricks, uncertain in the night, not having the least benefit of the light, we feared most, always wishing for day, and then for Land, cut it come too soon for our good; for about the first of</HI> October, <HI>our fears having made us forget how the time passed to a certainty; we about the break of day discerned Land (but what we knew not) the Land seemed high and Rockey, and the See continued still very storney and tempe∣stuous, insomuch as there, seemed no hope of safety, but looked suddenly by to perish. As we grew near Land, perceiving no, safely in the ship which we looked would suddenly be beat in pieces: The Captain my Master, and some others got into the long Boat, thinking by that means to save their lives, and presently after all the Seamen cast themselves over∣board, thinking to save their lives by swimming, onely my Self, my Masters Daughter, the two Maids, and the</HI> Negro <HI>were left on board, for we could not swim; but those that left us, might as well have carried with us, for we saw them, or most of them perish, our Selves now ready after to follow their for∣tune, but God was pleased to spare our lives, as it were by</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>miracle, though to further sorrow; for when we come a∣gainst the Rocks, our Ship having endured two or three blows against the Rocks, (being now broken and quite foun∣dred in the Waters, we having with much ado gotten our selves on the Bowspright, which being broken off, was driven by the Waves into a small Creek, wherein fell a little River, which being encompassed by the Rocks, was sheltred from the wind so that we had opportunity to land our selves, (though almost drowned) in all four person, besides the <HI>Negro; When we were got upon the Rocks, we could per∣ceive the miserable wrack to our great terrour, I had in my Pocket a little Tinder-box, and Steel, and Flint to strike fire at any time upon occasion, which served now to good purpose, for its being so close, preserved the Tinder dry; with this, and the help of some old Rotten Wood which we got together, we kindled a Fire and dryed our selves, which done, I left my Fe∣male company, and went to see, if I could find any of our Ships company, that were escaped, but could hear of none, though I hooted, and made all the noise I could; neither could I perceive the footsteps of any living Creature (save a few Birds, and other Bowls.</HI> At length it drawing towards the Evening I went back to my company, who were very much troubled for want of me. <HI>I being now all their stay in this lost condition;</HI> we were at first affraid that the wild people of the Countrey might find us out, although we saw no footsteps of any, no not so much as a Path; the Woods round about being fult of Briers and Bramble, we also stood in fear of wild Beasts, of such also we saw none, nor sign of any: But abve all, that we had greatest reason to fear, was to be star∣ved to death for want of Food, <HI>but God had otherwise provided for us, as you shall know hereafter;</HI> this done; we spent our time in getting some broken pieces of Board and Planks, and some of the Sails an Rigging on Shoar for shelter; I set up two or three Poles, an drew two or three of the Cords and Line from Tree to Tree, over which throwing some Sail∣cloathes and having gotten Wood by us, and three or four Sea g<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wns which we had dryed, we took up our lodging for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> night altogether (the <HI>Blackmore</HI> being less sensible then
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>the rest we made our Centry, we slept soundly that night, as having not slept in three or four nights before (our fears of what happened preventing us) neither could our hard lodging, fear, and danger hinder us, we were so overwatcht.</P>
<P>On the morrow, being well refresht with sleep, the wind ceased, and the weather was very warm; we went down the Rocks on the Sands at low Water, where we found great part of our lading, either on shore or floating near it. I by the help of my company, dragged most of it on shore; what was too heavy for us we broke, and unbound the Casks and Chests, and, taking out the goods, secured all; so that we wanted no clothes, nor any other provision necessary for Housekeeping, to furnish a better House than any we were like to have; but no Victuals (the salt Water having spoiled all) onely one Cask of Bisket, being lighter than the rest was dry; this served for Bread a while, and we found no Land a sort of fowl about the bignesse of a Swan, very heavy and fat, that by reason of their weight could not fly, of these we found little difficulty to kill, so that they were our present food; we carried out of <HI>England</HI> certain Hens and Cocks to eat by the way, some of these when the Ship was broken, by some means got to Land, and bred exceedingly, so that in the future they were a great help unto us; we found also, by a little River, in the flags, store of eggs, of a sort of fowl much like our Ducks, which were very good meat, so that we want∣ed nothing to keep us alive.</P>
<P>On the morrow, which was the third day, as soon as it was morning, seeing nothing to disturb us, I lookt out a convenient place to dwell in, that we might build us a Hut to shelter us from the weather, and from any other danger of annoyance, from wild Beasts (if any should find us out): So closse by a large Spring which rose out of a high hill over looking the Sea; on the side of a Wood, having a prospect towards the Sea (by the help of an Ax and some other implements, for we had all necessaries, the working of the Sea, having cast up most of our goods) I cut down all the streightest poles I could find, and which were enough for my purpose, by the help of my company, (necessity
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>being our Master) I digged holes in the earth, setting my poles at an equal distance, and nailing the broken boards of the Casks, Chests, and Cabins, and such like to them, making my door to the Seaward, and having covered the top, with Sail clothes strain'd, and nail'd; I in the space of a week had made a large Cabbin big enough to hold all our goods and our selves in it; I also placed our Hamocks for lodging, purposing (if it pleased God to send any Ship that way) we might be transported home, but it never came to pass, the place, wherein we were (as I conceived) being much out of the way.</P>
<P>We having now lived in this manner full four moneths, and not so much as seeing or hearing of any wild people or of any of our own company, more then our selves (they be∣ing found now by experience to be all drowned) and the place as we after found, being a large Island, and disjoyned, and out of sight of any other Land, was wholly uninhabited by any people, neither was there any hurtful beast to annoy us. But on the contrary, the Countrey so very pleasant, being always clothed with green, and full of pleasant fruits, and variety of Birds, ever warm, and never colder then in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> in <HI>September:</HI> so that this place (had it the culture that skilful people might bestow on it) would prove a <HI>Para∣dise.</HI></P>
<P>The Woods afforded us a sort of Nuts, as big as a large Apple, whose kernil being pleasant and dry, we made use of instead of Bread, that Fowl before mentioned, and a sort of Water-fowl like Ducks, and their Eggs, and a Beast about the size of a Goat, and almost such a like Creature, which brought two young ones at a time, and that twice a year, of which the Low Lands and Woods were very full, being a very harmless Creature and tame, so that we could easily take and kill them: Fish also, especially Shell-fish (which we could best come by) we had great store of, so that in effect as to Food we wanted nothing; and thus, and by such like helps, we continued six moneths, without any disturbance or want.</P>
<P>Idleness and fulness of every thing begot in me a desire
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>of enjoying the Women, beginning now to grow more fa∣miliar. I had perswaded the two Maids to let me lie with them, which I did at first in private, but after, custome tak∣ing away shame (there being none but us) we did it more openly, as our Lust gave us liberty; afterwards my Masters Daughter was content also to do as we did; the truth is, they were all handsome women, when they had clothes, and well shaped, feeding well. For we wanted no Food, and li∣ving idlely, and seeing us at liberty to do our wills, without hope of ever returning home made us thus bold: One of the first of my Consorts, with whom I first accompanied (the tallest and handsomest) proved presently with child, the se∣cond was my Masters Daughter, and the other also not long after fell into the same condition: none now remaining but my <HI>Megro,</HI> who seeing what we did, longed also for her share one night, I being asleep, my <HI>Negro</HI> (with the con∣sent of others) got close to me, thinking it being dark to begule me, but I awaking and feeling her, and perceiving who it was, yet willing to try the difference, satisfied my self with her, as well as with one of the rest; that night al∣though the first time, she proved also with child, so that in the year of our being here, all my women were with child by me, and they all coming at different seasons, were a great help to one another.</P>
<P>The first brought me a brave boy, my Masters Daughter was the youngest she brought me a Girl, so did the other Maid, who being something fat sped worse at her labour, <HI>the</HI> Negro <HI>had no pain at all, and brought me a fine white Girle, so I had one Boy, and three Girles:</HI> the Women were soon well again, <HI>and the two first with child again, before the two last were brought to bed:</HI> My custome being not to lie with any of them after they were with child, till other were so like∣wise; <HI>and not with the Black, at all after: she was with child:</HI> which commonly was at the first tiem, I lay with her, which <HI>was in the night and not else,</HI> my stomach would not serve me, although she was one of the handsomest Blacks, I had seen, and her children as comely as any fo the rest; <HI>we had no clothes for them, and therefore when they had suckt, we said, them in M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse to sleep, and took no further care of them,</HI> for we knew, when they were gone more would come; the Wo∣men
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>never failing once a year at least, and none of the Children (for all the hardship we put them to) were ever sick; so that wanting now nothing but Cloathes, nor them much neither, other then for decency, the warmth of the Countrey and Custome supplying that Defect, we were now well satisfied with our condition, our Family beginning to grow large, and there being nothing to hurt us, we many times lay abroad on Mossey Banks, under the shelter of some Trees, or such like (for having nothing else to do) I had made me several Arbors to sleep in with my Women in the heat of the day, in these I and my Women passed the time away, they being never willing to be out of my company.</P>
<P>And having now no thought of ever returning home, as having resolved and sworn each to other, never to part or leave one another, or the place; having by my several Wives, forty seven Children, Boys and Girls, but most Girls, and growing up apace, we were all of us very fleshy, the Coun∣try so well agreeing with us, that we never ailed any thing; my <HI>Negro</HI> having had twelve, was the first that left bearing, so I never medled with her more: My Masters Daughter (by whom I had most Children, being the youngest and hand∣somest) was most fond of me, and I of her. Thus we lived for sixteen years, till perceiving my eldest Boy to mind the ordinary work of Nature, by seeing what we did, I gave him a Mate, and so I did to all the rest, as fast as they grew up, and were capable: My Wives having left bearing, my chil∣dren began to breed apace, so we were like to be a multitude; My first Wife brought me thirteen Children, my second seven, my Masters Daughter fifteen, and the <HI>Negro</HI> twelve, in all forty seven.</P>
<P>After we had lived there twenty two years, my <HI>Negro</HI> died suddenly, but I could not percive any thing that ailed her; most of my children being grown, as fast as we married them, I sent them and placed them over the River by themselves se∣verally, because we would not pester one another; and now they being all grown up, and gone, and married after our man∣ner (some two or three of the youngest) for (growing my self into years) I liked not the wanton annoyance of young company.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<P>Thus having lived to the sixtieth year of my age, and the fortieth of my coming thither, at which time I sent for all of them to bring their children, and there were in number descended from me by these four Women, of my Children, Grand-children, &amp; great Grand-children, five hundred sixty five of both sorts; I took off the Males of one Family, and marri∣ed them to the Females of another, not letting any to marry their sisters, as we did formerly out of necessity, so blessing God for his Providence and goodness, I dismist them, I having taught some of my Children to read formerly, for I had left still the Bible, I charged it should be read once a moneth at a general meeting: At last one of my Wives died being sixty eighth years of age, which I buried in a place, set out on pur∣pose, and within a year after another, so I had none now left but my Masters Daughter, and we lived together twelve years longer, at length she died also, so I buried her also next the place where I purposed to be buried my self, and the tall Maid my first Wife next me on the other side, the <HI>Negro</HI> next without her, and the other Maid next my Masters Daughter. I had now nothing to mind, but the place whether I was to go, being very old, almost eighty years, I gave my Cabin and Furniture that was left to my eldest son after my decease, who had married my eldest Daughter by my be∣loved Wife, whom I made King and Governour of all the rest: I informed them of the Manners of <HI>Europe,</HI> and charged them to remember the Christian Religion, after the manner of them that spake the same Language, and to admit no other, if hereafter any should come and find them out.</P>
<P>And now once for all, I summoned them to come to me, that I might number them, which I did, and found the estimate to con∣tain in or about the eightieth year of my age, and the fifty ninth of my coming there; in all of all sorts one thousand seven hundred eighty and nine. Thus praying God to multi∣ply them, and send them the true light of the Gospel, I last of all dismist them: For, being now very old, and my sight decayed, I could not expect to live long. I gave this Narra∣tion (written with my own hand) to my Eldest Son, who now li∣ved
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>with me, commanding him to keep it, and if any stran∣gers should come hither by chance, to let them see it, and take a Copy of it if they would, that our name be not lost from off the earth. I gave this People (descended from me) the name of the <HI>ENGLISH PINES, George Pine</HI> being my name, and my Masters Daughters name <HI>Sarah English,</HI> my two other Wives were <HI>Mary Sparkes,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth Trevor,</HI> so their several Descendants are called the <HI>ENGLISH,</HI> the <HI>SPARKS,</HI> and the <HI>TREVORS,</HI> and the <HI>PHILLS,</HI> from the Christian Name of the Negro, which was <HI>Phillippa,</HI> she having no surname: And the general name of the whole the <HI>ENGLISH PINES;</HI> whom God blesse with the dew of Heaven, and the fat of the Earth, AMEN,</P>
