<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N this unquiet age, I conceive, there is no∣thing so pertinent to a mans felicity, next to the enjoying of happy places, as to know where they are. And to think our neigh∣bouring Regions of <HI>Europe</HI> receive a greater share of prosperity than we in <HI>England,</HI> is (without doubt) a great mistake. Neither doth any part of the old World make such promises to all sorts of men as doth the New World, commonly called <HI>America.</HI> For he that shall desire to advance himself by his labour, will finde many places
<PB REF="5"/>
where he may do it with much qui∣etnesse. He that shall desire to en∣joy much land, and live in a Civil Government under others, may finde places enough for him to pitch upon. He that shall desire to command a Countrey him∣self, and get into possession of it, without difficulty, wil finde many Islands fit for his turn, that are fruitfull and desolate, wanting In∣habitants, which at small charge may be transported thither. He that shall desire to be possest of great rich mines of gold and silver, and precious stones, and large Do∣minions, and withall hath but for∣titude, courage, and a reasonable English Gentlemans Estate, may by an ordinary Providence over him, attain to these great matters. And that man that shall have store of Commodities lie by him, which he cannot vent, although they are necessary for mans accomodation,
<PB REF="5"/>
will finde here places, that he may exchange them at, to his great ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>But if the Decipherers of this Orbe had been as cautious in set∣ting down truths, as they have been prolixious in impertinencies, our Nation would certainly ere this have made greater advantages upon those Regions.</P>
<P>For, my part, as I am an English man, so I desire that name and people may grow great and famous and extend their authority and name beyond either <HI>Roman, Greci∣an, Assyrian</HI> or <HI>Persian</HI> Nations. And if from this discourse they may draw any thing that may prove for their Honour or Profit, I have my aim. And I shall assure them, I have related nothing but what my own knowledg or good intelligence perswades me is cer∣tainly true, which my future acti∣ons with Gods leave shall declare.

I have been plain in discourse of the Forreign Commerce of our Nation.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Commerce of the English Nation.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Navigation and Commerce of the En∣glish Nation, is so pro∣portioned, that upon the division of the world, it may properly be said, that it is traded
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
by four severall parts. The grea∣test of which is <HI>America,</HI> the next in account is <HI>Asia,</HI> the third <HI>Africa▪</HI> and the least <HI>Europe,</HI> in which is out native Countrey, it being a Westwardly part of this Division. From whence there arises to mee these Questions.</P>
<P>The first, whether the trade be equally divided according to the quality of the places traded with.</P>
<P>The second, whether the losse to some of these places be not grea∣ter then the gains.</P>
<P>The third, whether the trade of the Common-wealth may not be increased.</P>
<P>The fourth, how it hath been hindred, and what is the let in the grants of it.</P>
<P>The fifth, whether there may not be a course taken to quicken the trade and encourage Adventu∣rers.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>To answer the first.</HEAD>
<P>We finde that in <HI>Asia,</HI> there are six most patent Emperours, which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Emperour of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> of <HI>Japan,</HI> of <HI>China,</HI> of <HI>Turkey,</HI> of <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> and of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gals</HI> or <HI>Mogores.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar,</HI> hath few or no Ports, the <HI>Persian</HI> not many, all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est have store of Ports, and rich Cities, on them, fit for Com∣merce and prade. And it hath been affirmed by the Natives of those part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that were well acquainted with the <HI>East Indies,</HI> that in <HI>India major,</HI> which is from <HI>Mallabar</HI> to <HI>Ches<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>coram,</HI> there are 13 King∣domes, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>700 Islands, desolate and un-inhabited. And in <HI>India mi∣nor,</HI> which is from <HI>Siambi,</HI> to <HI>Mur∣fili,</HI> there are eight Kingdomes be∣side many Islands. And the Com∣modities of these parts are of the best sort, and probably by the great
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
quantities that have been yearly carried thither from <HI>Europe,</HI> there is more silver then in all the other parts of the world.</P>
<P>And although there is this great¦nesse yet we send yearly, but a few ships which belong to the <HI>East In∣dia,</HI> and Turkish Company.</P>
<P>The trade of <HI>America</HI> is much greater, although it be but with our own Nation, which are seated in <HI>New-England, Virginia, Barba∣dos, Christophers, Antego, Santey, Crus, Meaguis, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ferat,</HI> and <HI>Bar∣moudas,</HI> what else of that Orbe is in the hands of Spaniards Portu∣gals, and Dutch in any considera∣ble place, cannot be traded with by the English, <HI>Africa</HI> almost an I∣land joyning to <HI>Asia</HI> by that nar∣row <HI>Isthmus,</HI> part of <HI>Arabia Deserta</HI> neer cut asunder by the Red and Mediterranean Seas, hath for its coasts on the Mediterranean Sea▪ <HI>Egypt, Barbary,</HI> and a part of <HI>Mau∣ritania,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
on the North sea the King∣dom of <HI>Morocco, Fesse, Tombuto,</HI> the large Regions of <HI>Giney, Conge,</HI> and Empire of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> and from the Cape of <HI>Bona Speranza,</HI> unto the Iland of <HI>Scotia,</HI> the King∣dom of <HI>Armeto, Mosambique, Qui∣lioa, Melinde, Magadoxo, Badivis, Ethiopia,</HI> and part of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and from thence alongst the Red Sea, <HI>Seila, Adel,</HI> and the Empire of <HI>Prester John.</HI></P>
<P>And all these Countries have many Rivers and Ports, and great store of people living on them. And we trade onely to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in <HI>Egypt, Morocco, Fesse</HI> and <HI>Giney,</HI> and there but little neither, all the other places being left, as <HI>terrain∣cognita.</HI></P>
<P>The trade of <HI>Europe,</HI> doth justly challenge a greater Commerce then any of the other parts have, although it be the least. On this consideration, the Ports are neer
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
adjacent, the people more ingeni∣ous in procuring Merchandize, and and their Comodities more in use with us, and ours more wanting with them, as our broad Cloth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And from these considerations, I conclude, that unlesse in <HI>Europe,</HI> there is no equality in the trade of our Nation with the other parts of the World.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The second Question.</HEAD>
<P>Whether the losse be not grea∣ter then the gaines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o some of these places.</P>
<P>As the end of all trade and mens carnall thoughts are commonly for silver and gold, so that Countrey that hath most of it is accounted the richest. And indeed it is almost all things, for he that hath enough of that, cannot lack any worldly thing that can be had.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="11"/>Upon which, I conceive, that the principall ayme of all forreign trade should be to bring much of it in, and carry little of it out of our Countrey, and that Commerce that doth not is managed to the disadvantage of our Nation, and ought to be rejected.</P>
<P>And upon examination it will be found, that the greatest trade which we drive in <HI>Asia,</HI> which is to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> either by the way of <HI>Bagdet, Caro,</HI> and the red Seas, or Cape of <HI>Bona Speranza,</HI> is with ready money.</P>
<P>I can with confidence say, it may be managed so to the advan∣tage of our Nation, that we may have their Commodity for ours, and their Ports better traded. And whereas it hath been the practise of our people to carry much money thither, we may now fetch it home again.</P>
<P>And the trade of <HI>America</HI> is pre∣judiciall,
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
very dishonest, and high∣ly dishonourable to our Nation. It is prejudiciall, in that it carrieth a∣way daily such men as might serve their Country, either in fighting to defend it at home, or else a∣broad.</P>
<P>'Tis dishonourable, in that we are upbraided by all other Nations that know that trade for selling our own Countreymen for the Com∣modities of those places. And, I affirm, that I have been told by the Dutch and others, that we English were worse than the Turks, for that they sold strangers onely, and we sold our own Countreymen. And it is well known, that people in au∣thority, and some that professe much to Christianity of those parts, will hang a man for selling or ta∣king away an Indian that worship∣eth the Devill, when at the same time they allow others, and will themselves buy of their own Na∣tion,
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
which have most barbarously been stolne out of their Countrey.</P>
<P>And 'tis dishonest, if murther be so, for when they have by Spi∣rits or lying tales, forced them aboard the ships, in their transpor∣tation onely, there is yearly many starved to death, those that remain are sold to those that wil give most for them; some for fourteen years, others for ten, and lesse, but the least four: and it were better for them to serve fourteen years with the Turks, then four in the Planta∣tions with most of the Masters in those places, especially in <HI>Virginia,</HI> for besides, their being back-beaten and belly-beaten, it is three to one if they live out their servitude, by reason of the unwholsomenesse of the Countreys.</P>
<P>In which disasters that happen to our Nation, I cannot but con∣dole their misfortunes, as if we of all <HI>Europe</HI> were of the seed of
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<HI>Cham,</HI> when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> at the same time managed their businesse so well, that scarcely will one of them serve in the <HI>Indies,</HI> except it be the <HI>Viceroy,</HI> or some great Per∣sonage, and I know that Nation in nothing exceeds us, but in their keeping together as one people.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The third Question.</HEAD>
<P>Is whether the trade of <HI>England</HI> may not be increased.</P>
<P>It is not hard to imagine, when we see the greatnesse of <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and the little Commerce that we have with them, that it may well be increased. And although the trade of <HI>Europe</HI> be much grea∣ter the rest, yet doth it want much of that exactnesse which we may have in it. For where <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we gain in some parts, and lose in others, it is possible to assure the Land, to gain in all and lose in none.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="part">
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>The fourth Question.</HEAD>
<P>Is, how it hath been hindred, and what is the let in the growth of it?</P>
<P>The people generally suppose 'tis the danger of the seas, and the little security in the parts abroad, for the Merchants Goods and ships. In answer, I affirm, the trade of the Hollanders never flourished so as in time of War, and their ene∣mies were more strong at Sea then ours, upon which we may conclude, it is not that that is the true cause.</P>
<P>Wherefore, I finde these other causes to be the obstruction in the trade. The first is, the Companies of our Nation, which fort of peo∣ple I account a benefit of a losse, according as they are established and managed, in which the Com∣panies of <HI>England</HI> have been de∣fective, which appeareth in the
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
generall damages which themselves and Adventurers have had with them, and few publick memorials they have erected at home or abroad that hath appeared a publick good, but divers acts have seemed the contrary.</P>
<P>And on particulars we finde, there are five Companies that are well in years amongst us, the other which was of later establishment, which really was the best (the <HI>Giney</HI> Company) is dissolved.</P>
<P>And to omit the general damage that all the <HI>Inland</HI> Companies do to our Nation, which is from my purpose now to treat of, the five Companies of exportation are: first, the Cloth Company that trade into <HI>Holland, Hamborough,</HI> the <HI>Bal∣tick</HI> Seas, and elsewhere, with all the white Clothes exported the Kingdome.</P>
<P>The second is the <HI>East India</HI> Company, the third the <HI>Turkey,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
the fourth the <HI>Muscovia,</HI> the fifth the Company of <HI>Greenland, alias Grinland.</HI> Of which, I conceive, the Cloth Company to be the greatest Monopoly, for this cause. Besides the ingrossing of the commodity of white Cloth to themselves, which is a great barre to the pri∣viledge of the Nation. The car∣rying of them out of the Laud, is a pernicious thing to five sorts of men, Merchants, Seamen, Cloth∣dressers, Sheare-men and Diers, which last people receive the grea∣test damage, although they were accounted anciently the Staple-ma∣nufacture of our Nation. The pre∣judice to the Cloth-dressers and Diers, appears in the carrying away from them forty Clothes white more then are worked at home, by which it appears, that where there is one imploy'd now in that course, there might be forty, if it were ma∣naged at home.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>And all that ever I heard that the Company could say for themselvs is▪ that the trade of making white Cloth would be spoiled, for the Dutch and Poles if they could not have it white would forbear buy∣ing of it. But I am sure the Mer∣chants buy it beyond the se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for their profit▪ and not to▪ se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Country-men at worke, or else they differ much from them of the Company. And if they want it to▪ trade with▪ they will have it as well drest by us▪ as their ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Na∣tion; but if they be obstinate and will not buy it, we shall gaine and not lose, for our Sea-men and Merchants that make short Voy∣ages with small profit will the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vent it to those parts which now have it at the second hand from them, that buy it white from us▪ and so the Merchants will make two profits in stead of one; and the Sea-men longer Voyages.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15"/>The <HI>East-India</HI> Company come home to this question in that it hath lost many advantagious places there, and impoverished many that adventured with them, giving them after fifteen or sixteen yeares forbearance of their money in∣stead of 70li▪ yearly, which the Dutch give most yeares to their Adventurers▪ 70li▪ for their princi∣pall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ And the Dutch, lately to re∣new their Lease, which not long since was neer expired, being but for 21 yeares at the first, com∣pounded with the States Generall to have it renewed for so much longer for the summe of eight hundred thousand pound paid to them▪ and five hundred thousand to the <HI>West-India▪</HI> Company, which the States owed the said <HI>West-India</HI> Company.</P>
<P>And whereas the Dutch Com∣pany hath whole Countries, divers Islands▪ Cities, Castles, Forts, &amp;c.
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
and all taken in by the sword, to the contrary, our men hath lost mo∣ney, lost time, which was consider∣able in those actions, and divers Countries which they never got but were delivered by the Natives, such was <HI>Pulway, Pullerroon, Lan∣tor, Rosingen, Wayer, Timor, Tiadore, Ternat,</HI> and the Castle of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> where the Dutch committed the greatest murther that of late yeares hath been heard of upon our Nati∣on, by racking, torturing by fire, and water, throwing in dungeons, and their easing themselves on them untill their bodies became blistered, then drawing them forth, and be∣heading some, sawing a-sunder o∣thers, at other times their cruelty hath been after the same manner▪ and this accompanied with revil∣ling of our Nation; which things are in perticular related by them that escaped from those miseries, recording before the Tribunall of
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
the late King, their sufferings, and his dishonour which he heard with as much parience, as the losse of the English at the Isle of <HI>Ree.</HI> I know not the hearts of other men, but my minde is, that all men that acknow∣ledge a Government, and subscribe to maintaine it, ought to be pro∣tected as well abroad as at home. There is difference between the bloud of Peace and War, as <HI>David</HI> saith, and this was not as the rest, of <HI>Rochell,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Ree,</HI> but by the snare that <HI>Joab</HI> smote <HI>Ama∣sa.</HI> And upon discourse, it will be found, that act is justified by that people to this day.</P>
<P>The cause of the Dutches flou∣rishing, our Companies say, was there stock exceeding the English▪ But it will appear, upon examina∣tion, that the English Company had sixteene hundred thousand pounds▪ under writ for, when the Dutch had but eight.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>The <HI>Turkey</HI> Company is little before it in goodnesse, although men have not so eminently suffe∣red, yet some have been inslaved by the Turks of <HI>Barbary.</HI> But the great prejudice (as the case now standeth) without alteration in all the Companies, is the ingrossing the trade of his dominions to them∣selves, which might serve them∣selves, and divers others. For the Ports of the Grand Seignour are many; the chief being <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> there are on the coasts of the seas in his Territories, the Provin∣ces of <HI>Arcadia, Accea, Poliponesus, Epirus,</HI> part of <HI>Dalmatis,</HI> the Island of the <HI>Archipelagus</HI> and <HI>Cyprus,</HI> in the Mediterranean Sea on the coast of the <HI>Begler-Begship</HI> of <HI>Cairo,</HI> the Provinces of <HI>Troas,</HI> the fair scitua∣ted Town of <HI>Symrna,</HI> then <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the Ports of <HI>Jewry,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> the trade of the great City of <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> where there might be more
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
Commerce onely, then we have now in all the Turkish Empire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovia</HI> Company is alike prejudiciall, in monopolizing the trade of that large Empire, which trade is not valuable in relation to the Ports, for that of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> the Archangel is the principall, and almost onely Port in his Do∣minions, but when you are within the land, there are most large Terri∣tories to trade with, as the Com∣merce of the black. Seas, which may conveniently be entred by the river <HI>Volga,</HI> and so traded, which the Grand Seignour prohibits by way of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the peace which the <HI>Muscovite</HI> hath for the most part with the <HI>Tartar,</HI> and many <HI>Tartars</HI> stil resident in <HI>Musco,</HI> by whom, were it a generall Trade, divers men likely would for their profit get Commerce with that Na∣tion, which would make way for a farther trade, even to the <HI>Cathai∣ans,</HI> and <HI>China's.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="18"/>The <HI>Greenland</HI> Company hath as great a share in oppression as the rest, although it is not so eminent in fame, and in this it exceedeth, that whereas the other Compa∣nies are a hindrance to such Mer∣chants as might trade (were it not for their Patent) into those Coun∣tries of their divisions, this I say, is not onely a Barre to those that would trade to <HI>Greenland,</HI> but hath so much power, as to hinder other Merchants from importing into the Land the Commodities they have from <HI>Greenland.</HI> So that those that buy that usefull Com∣modity, must give their rates for it. And although it be in others a fault to bring it from neerer places to hinder the trade to <HI>Greenland,</HI> yet 'tis reported, they are not bound by this Law, being forced for want of sufficient from <HI>Greenland</HI> to supply the English at second hand.</P>
<P>Now, as it is clear by this I have
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
said, that these Companies are a great hinderance to the Com∣merce of our Nation. There is also another, which the Merchants complain of, and that is the Dutch Nation, that daily so insinuate into the trade of all places where ever they are admitted, to the putting by of the English. And were it not that we sell our Conntreymen for the Commodity of the English Plantations, I am fully perswaded, within a few years, we should be forced to have what comes from thence at a second hand from the Dutch: which in reason seems strange, considering they export nothing but what they import, and we export much which we need not import, &amp; how those that have it at a second hand, should sell a thing cheaper then him that hath it at the first, seems irrationall, yet they will do it, which is done by our ir∣regularity in trade, and the Mer∣chants
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
that are the great Complay∣nants, are the chief causers of their own hinderance.</P>
<P>But upon Examination, it will be found, that the principall Com∣merce of the whole World is in hands of the English, and the U∣nited Provinces. And what we lose they get. And as it is their great care, by all means, to increase their own Commerce, though with the ruine of ours, so, I conceive, it is honest and honourable, to endea∣vour our own good, although by their hurt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The fifth Question</HEAD>
<P>Is, Whether there may not be a course taken to quicken the trade and Commerce of the English Nation?</P>
<P>As I apprehend the Companies to be a great cause of hinderance in our trade, with the ill managing of
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
the generall trade of our Nation, so I think these things I have offered, doe in part demonstrate it. Where∣fore, I conceive, that if they were taken away, with some irregularity in trade, our Nation would not be found wanting, either in inclination to trade, or abilities for trade to ad∣vance our Commerce to what height we please.</P>
<P>And because there may arise an Objection against the overthrow of Companies, in regard we see the Hollanders have a very flourishing trade in the World, although it be managed by more Companies then we have.</P>
<P>I shall to that and the second hinderance which is the trade of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> affirme, the first con∣stitution of Companies were, or ought to have been established to keep up a trade subject to alterati∣on, without fortification, and strength of shipping, for to those
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>
places that give us an equall en∣gagement by oath of Princes, Em∣bassadours and Agents constantly Leger to see right, and performance of Articles, there is no need of Companies, or else, why are they not in <HI>Europe?</HI> And where there is this ful assurance 'tis contrary to all sence, that there should be a mono∣poly of the trade, and where it is not assured this way, or by Forts, we lie at the mercy of those Princes we trade with, that permit us but for their profit, and no longer, I con∣ceive, it is madnesse without assu∣rance of fortification, to assure Mer∣chants goods and ships to have any Commerce with such men or Countreys. And it was for this reason, that the Companies of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> were first erected. For it was proposed that private men ma∣king a voyage, and according to the losse or gain of that continue or forsake the trade, and although it
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
were profitable; yet want of abili∣ty or will would hinder them from gaining that assurance for the fu∣ture; which a joynt stock well ma∣naged would do. And although the Hollanders come far short of that perfection in trade which they might have, yet are they in this ve∣ry circumspect. For the Compa∣nies of <HI>Holland,</HI> do not only forti∣fie in most places, where they come; but gain whole Regions and Pro∣vinces, which is still managed to the advantage and honour of their Common-wealth▪ But our Com∣panies have so much swerved from this intention of their first consti∣tuting, that whereas the Dutch keep the <HI>East India</HI> Provinces in awe, we are miserable slaves to them. For if a Prince of <HI>India,</HI> loseth on the seas by Piracy of En∣glish or any other people of <HI>Europe,</HI> what they have in their Countrey of the English Merchants wil sure∣ly,
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
make good their losse. Or in case an English power, or French, &amp;c▪ saying, he were English, should come into the Red Seas, and take ships bound for any <HI>Turkish</HI> Port, or <HI>Cameron</HI> land, and desire trade, &amp; be surprized, and getting free, revenge themselves on the goods and per∣sons of the <HI>Arabs</HI> or <HI>Turkes,</HI> the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Merchants in <HI>Turkey</HI> under the Command of the Grand Seig∣nour, would surely pay for it in their persons and goods.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greenland</HI> Company was first established to bring in the whole Commerce of the Whale∣fishing into <HI>England,</HI> and with much honesty might they have barred others from comming thi∣ther, in regard, the English were the first Discoverers of it, but in∣stead of going before others, we come behinde them, and far-short of the Dutch, which appoint us their leavings, instead of taking ours.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="21"/>The Dutch which is a second hinderance to us in our Commerce, overtop us very strangely, if wee seriously consider the people, and their Country, which is compre∣hended within the title of the Uni∣ted Provinces. In which lyeth on∣ly <HI>Zealand, Holland, Frisland, U∣trick,</HI> and these Provinces they have entirely, the biggest of them no greater then <HI>Kent.</HI> They have a little part of <HI>East Flanders, Brabant,</HI> and a good part of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> which places doth not afford them common necessaries, for they have most of their flesh from <HI>Emden, Holsten</HI> and <HI>Westphalia,</HI> their Corn from the Countreys on the Baltick seas, for their housing and ship∣ping, their Timber and Iron from <HI>Norway, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Lukeland,</HI> their Hemp, Pitch, and Tar, as we from <HI>Muscovia,</HI> or the Baltick Seas. And for commodities of exporta∣tion to maintain the great trade,
<PB N="28" REF="22"/>
they have at Sea, their land is as barren and deficient, so that their trade consists meerly in what they get from one Nation, and sell to another. And upon a true exami∣nation it wil be found, what they have gotten from us in the <HI>East In∣dies,</HI> and in or about our Country, is the foundation of all their staple manufacture.</P>
<P>And to come to some perticulars, we find that the Spices of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> the Herrings they have on our Coasts, and our white Cloth which they dresse and die, is the ve∣ry ground of all their Commerce, all which comes to them for little, or at least, no visible payment. For we get nothing for our Herrings nor for the Spices, they have from those places, which formerly were ours, and though they speak of their paying for them to some of our Nation, yet it is not visible to us. And the white Cloth, they
<PB N="29" REF="22"/>
have at the third part they make of it. And although with these, and the other Commodities of our Countrey, as Stockings, course Cloth, Stuffs, &amp;c. they make the most of their trades, yet for those they buy from us, they have with∣out any just exception. Although it were necessary, we did make the best use of our native Commodi∣ties, which we misse as much of, as if we had never known the way of adventuring from our own Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>And now I have said this, it is likely, that there are many will affirm, that they knew as much be∣fore, as I relate, but the remedy is not amply proposed. But I to ex∣cuse my self, say, that I have been often in discourse of this subject, and have not heard as much as I here shew to you.</P>
<P>And the great Physicians say, it is harder to finde out the disease,
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>
then to prescribe a remedy. And since I have done that, I conceive, I ought to be silent, yet with an in∣tent to shew my self as forward in prescribing a remedy, as I have been in informing of this subtle di∣sease: And in order to that, if it shal be required by those, who sit at the helme of our Affairs, I shall un∣doubtedly bring to their knowledg a man that will shew himself most expert in serving his Country this way. And when the trade of our Nation shall be regulated to such exactnesse, as may procure a gene∣rall profit and honour to our Nati∣on; it will peradventure appear as small and ordinary a matter as the Navigation of <HI>America,</HI> which is now a thing of little difficulty, but was formerly accompted an impos∣sibility to the disparagement of for∣mer ages, and amazement of the present.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. 2.</HI> The generall description of <HI>America,</HI> or the new World.</HEAD>
<P>THis great part of the globe was unknown unto the <HI>Europeans</HI> untill the year of our Redemption 1492. At which time it was disco∣vered by <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> a <HI>Genowes,</HI> in the behalf of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Castel,</HI> and <HI>Leon</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> that to this day, enjoys the greatest and richest part of it. And especi∣ally those golden and fruitfull Re∣gions, that are between the Tro∣picks, which is commonly called the <HI>West Indies.</HI> And what there is unpossest of him and the Natives, and in the hands of English, Dutch
<PB N="32" REF="24"/>
or French is not considerable to the rest.</P>
<P>This title of <HI>America,</HI> compre∣hends as well Islands, as Conti∣nents, the Islands for the most part lieth in the Seas on this side the Continent. The other of the West side are few and small, the Seas that compasse this Continent on the East side, are commonly called the North Seas; On the West side the South Seas, which lieth be∣tween it and <HI>Asia,</HI> and on the North end it hideth it selfe under the Pole; and to the South of the straight of <HI>Magellan,</HI> the North and South Seas meet together, and di∣vide it from the South Pole.</P>
<P>The Continent of <HI>America</HI> in seven degrees of North Latitude, is very narrow from sea to sea, that is to say, from <HI>Porto Bello</HI> to <HI>Pana∣ma</HI> eight leagues, a rough &amp; rocky passage, from whence both North and South, the Land groweth ex∣ceeding
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>
broad to the North be∣yond knowledg, and to the South, one thousand leagues, as 'tis guest.</P>
<P>It containeth divers Regions and Provinces, in which are compre∣hended some good and wholsome places, other bad and unwholsome, and as there is indifferents, so there is extreams.</P>
<P>And as the best places are with∣in the Tropicks, so the more north or south you goe, the more barren and cold you finde the Climates, even to unsufferable extremities.</P>
<P>The passage and course of say∣ling to the most parts of <HI>America,</HI> is by the wind that bloweth a gen∣tle gale, constantly between the Tropicks east, or east South-east, not much wavering unlesse by a <HI>Tornado</HI> or <HI>Hericano.</HI></P>
<P>The Natives of <HI>America,</HI> at this day are of three sorts; The first, that live the most civilly, are them that live within the govern∣ment
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> after the same manner that they do, in appa∣rell, building, trades and Religion. The second sort, are those that live under the contribution of the Eng∣lish, Portugals, Dutch, French, &amp;c. And these keep still their an∣cient Customes, Religions, and Manners: and these I say are di∣vided under severall Governours, or Kings, and live in Towns, some of which are paled round, contein∣ing houses covered with Mats, their frames of Arbour works, the best are made more substantiall of great Poles and mats, covered with the bark of trees, their food is what the Woods, Seas and Rivers af∣fords naturally, and their bread of that grain we call <HI>Virginia</HI> wheat, and of this their wives plant about their Towns, whom they accu∣stome also to do their other house∣hold work, the men spending their time in hunting and fishing, being
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>
attended by the boys, whom they breed up to this kind of life with themselves. And this way of li∣ving runs throughout all <HI>America,</HI> North and South, for this sort of people.</P>
<P>The third kind of <HI>Indians</HI> which are on the land, they call in the Spa∣nish <HI>Dominions</HI> (where there is the most of them) <HI>Chickameckians,</HI> and in the Islands <HI>Canables.</HI> In which sort of people, the <HI>Craibey</HI> Islands do so abound, that they prove bad neighbours to the Eng∣lish and French, that are there seated, as those in the land are to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> And these <HI>Indians</HI> live upon what they get from the strangers that are neer them, &amp; the other more civil <HI>Indians:</HI> and some of them are so inhumane, that they will eat mans flesh. Their common food is what they get by hunting and fishing. And such of them that have Islands, and Provinces to
<PB N="36" REF="26"/>
themselves, live in such kind o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> habitation (as I have said, the se¦cond sort of <HI>Indians</HI> do.) The Re¦ligion of all of them, that are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made Spanish Christians, is to wor¦ship stones, beasts, or fowls, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> serpents, but generally the Devill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom they much fear, and there¦fore worship.</P>
<P>Their Priests are conjurers an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> witches and in those arts can do ve¦ry strange things.</P>
<P>The statures of the Natives dif¦fer as with us in <HI>Europe,</HI> but thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> complexions generally are tawn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and swarthy, as also their skins Although in divers places, I sup¦pose, they would be otherwise, did they not anoint their flesh with oiles and grease, and bask them¦selves in the Sun and winde, agains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which they have little or no de¦fence, going almost all naked, ex¦cepting amongst those Civill <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> with the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="26"/>Their naturall weapons, are ge∣nerally Batoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Bowes and Ar∣rows. Their Bows are made of some bending wood, their Arrows of Canes and Reeds, headed with fishes bones, and flints, with which they are excellent marksmen. The heads of divers they poyson to do the more mischief. There are na∣turall to these parts which are wild in the Woods, divers kinds of Beasts and Fowles, many of which are not elsewhere in the world to be found, as also many fruits not known amongst us.</P>
<P>Amongst the Plantations, there is not any thing wanting that is to be had in <HI>Europe;</HI> and much more, which is naturall to those parts, but the substance of flesh, fish, and fruits is not so substantiall as that of <HI>Europe,</HI> and not any thing com∣parable with that in <HI>England:</HI> which is the cause that they are much easier of digestion, and cau∣seth
<PB N="38" REF="27"/>
a more constant appetite then we have with us.</P>
<P>The treasures that are yearly drawn from the bowels of the Spa∣nish Regions, are infinitely great. And in the subjection of any other Prince or people of <HI>Europe,</HI> there is neither Mine of Gold, Silver, Quick-silver, Emraulds, or Beads of Pearl, all which are in great plenty in the Spanish Dominions. And in regard I shall in my relati∣ons, speak of many Countreys, that are plentifull of these riches, I shall here describe how they are obtained.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="39" REF="27"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. 3.</HI> Of Gold, Silver, Quick∣silver, Emraulds, and Pearl.</HEAD>
<P>THe gold is engendred in the Mountains, from whence by rains and flouds into the Plains, and rivers, where for the most part they find it. That of the plains, is in veines of hard earth that con∣teineth part pure grains of gold like pompeon-seeds, which is the best, but the most that is got in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> is in the Rivers, where it is found mixed with the sand in pou∣der, even as the sand it self. They separate it from the earth, and sand, by washing in a bowle of the fashion of a Barbers bason. Where
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
they finde it in hard veines, they break them with the Hammers, and make them fit to wash: first, putting the earth or sand into the bason, and receiving water into one side of it, turn it out at the other, untill they have washed out the earth from the gold, which as the heavier substance remains behind at the bottome of the bowle.</P>
<P>The silver Mine is found in the earth in veines or branches, much like the Tinne or Cole in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and is worked almost in the same manner under the ground.</P>
<P>The way of separating the silver from the drosse, is first to take the oare, and break it in Hammer-mils, and grind it to powder, then sift it through a Copper searse, and put it into a furnace, under which they make a fire by degrees, mixing with every fifty quarts of pouder five of salt, and stirring it, together with quick-silver, which they squeeze
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>
through a piece of holland upon the said pouder and salt, and when they finde the quick-silver, suffi∣ciently incorporate with the silver, then they put it altogether in a Cauldron, in which there is water, and a wheel, that going round, turneth out the earth and drosse with the water, the quick-silver, and silver, as the more heavy sub∣stance remains behind, which they take from the Cauldron, and wash it after the manner of gold, till they finde it clean from all drosse, and filth, and then putting it into a cloth, they strain forcibly from it some quick-silver, the remainder being as a leafe of silver.</P>
<P>And to separate the silver from the quick-silver, they put it into a violent fire, and cover it with an earthen pot of the fashion of a su∣gar loa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which is also covered with coals, and kept very hot, and from a hole in the said pot, to which is
<PB N="42" REF="29"/>
fashioned a pipe, like the pipe of a Limbeck, they receive the quick∣silver, which evacuates by the same pipe, leaving the silver of the same form it was put in, but wanting much of the bignesse and waight.</P>
<P>The Quick-silver and Vermilli∣on, is found together in Rocks, or very hard earth. That part that is found to contein the quick-silver, they break to pieces, and putting it into earthen fire-pots well luted, they set it on a violent fire (made in the <HI>Indies</HI> of straw, which they find to be excellent for that work) whatof it evacuateth out of the pot, goeth up, till meeting nothing to receive it, it falleth down cold, in the same manner we have it. The remainner in the pot, being suffici∣ently separated from the drosse and earth, the fire is taken away, and when it is throughly cold, they open the pot, and poure out the Quick-silver. into leather baggs,
<PB N="43" REF="29"/>
which keepeth it best, conveighing it where they please in them. Those that open these pots, and stirreth the silver and it together, in refi∣ning the silver, swallow a pellet of gold, that lying in the stomack, draweth the Quick-silver, which in time getteth into their bodies, from whence it goeth out with the said pellet in excrement. And if the pot be not throughly cold, when 'tis open; it is two to one, if they lose not their teeth or hair, dis-figure their noses and faces, and many times utterly spoile them∣selves.

The Natives of this place are few, and savage, neither is there any thing in this Countrey to invite a Plantation, it is so Rockie, and bar∣ren. But for the commoditie of fish, which are taken on the Coast in great plenty, there are some men that do endure the heat of Summer, and cold in Winter, both

which come in extreams, some are French, but the most English, in whose hand lieth the supream pow∣er, the plenty of fish (w<SUP>ch</SUP> sort is wel known in <HI>England,</HI> by the name of <HI>New-found land</HI> fish) inviteth ma∣ny ships thither, whose lading is procured sometimes by themselves, but for the most part by the dwel∣lers in the place. This Island lyeth at the mouth of the River <HI>Canida,</HI> distant from the Continent at the North end neer half a league, and the South west point is about a league from <HI>Cape Briton,</HI> and by the one of these ways, you passe to the River <HI>Canida.</HI></P>

<P>Next to <HI>Bahama,</HI> is a small Isle surrounded with the shelves of <HI>Bimny.</HI></P>

<P>This Land is exceeding plea∣sant,

and hath divers Vallies, one being so great, as to reach from the one side of the Island to other, that hath many golden rivers issuing in∣to it, which Vallies are always stock∣ed with multitudes of wilde kine, goats, hogs, shag-hair'd sheep and horses, amongst which, as their deadly enemy, are many wild dogs, that are bred of such as have been lost a hunting, and run away from the Spaniards: the woods have abundance of Oranges, Limons, Limes, Cotton-wool and Plantens, and many green Birds.</P>
<P>The commodities the Spaniards yearly export from thence is Gin∣ger, Sugar, Cotton-wool, <HI>Cassia, Fistula, Sasaprila,</HI> and <HI>Lignum vi∣tae;</HI> with Tallow, and a hundred thousand hides, which are yearly gotten of those wild cattell, which are the largest of the world.</P>
<P>There are divers Rivers that af∣ford gold, and some Mines which

It hath divers fruits and poultrey: and as there is a greater trade here then in the rest of the Islands, yet in regard the sellers are, well matched by the buyers, I conceive it the worst Plantation to goe to either to live or make a Voyage and returne.

<P>THat which is most remarkable in this north part of <HI>America,</HI> is the straight of the north west passage, which is generally talked of, and indeed is nothing but a nar∣row difficult passage to <HI>Buttons</HI> Bay, the entrance being properly called <HI>Hudsons</HI> Straight, in regard of his first finding it: the mouth of this
<PB N="84" REF="50"/>
straight lyeth in 62 degrees, and because of the impossibility of this Mathematicall story, I shall say, there is certainly no such Straight, as this which they call <HI>Anian,</HI> or the north-west passage: it hath been so thorowly searched into by our Nation that can give no incourage∣mēt to a farther trial, save that story men tel of a Manuscript in <HI>Portugall,</HI> shewed to one of our Merchants of the passage that way, of a Portu∣gall ship of the <HI>Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ipinus</HI> droven from thence by foule weather, through this straight to <HI>Portugall,</HI> but to men that know the distance between that streight, and those Ilands, it would seem the most ri∣diculous story in the World, be∣side the falsity of the Informers: the Greeks relation being a far bet∣ter story, for he saith in regard he was taken by Squire <HI>Candis</HI> in the South-sea, and lost all he had, to procure some relief in his old age, he would advise the English a spee∣dier
<PB N="85" REF="50"/>
way to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> then they now took. And this intelli∣gence he giveth after he is retired to his Native Country, to repose from his troublesome way of ad∣venturing to Sea. From whence we may easily guesse, for the bad turn our Nation did him, he would not wish us a good one, but the scope of his intelligence being but to have a bill of exchange to receive money, as he pretended to come into <HI>England.</HI> But how likely it was, that he would leave those rich parts of <HI>America,</HI> which he lived in with the Spaniards to re∣tire to his own Nation, and from thence to undertake a Voyage for us to the worst place in the World, a rationall man cannot apprehend. But were there such a passage, it would much more concern the Por¦tugals, and the Spaniards, then it doth the English, for their trade is to the north part of the <HI>East Indies,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="51"/>
and ours to the south: theirs to the <HI>Moluccos, Philipinaes, Japan,</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> whereas we seldome passe beyond <HI>Bantam</HI> in <HI>Java,</HI> but were there a passage that way, yet it were not to be chosen before the other, for could a man sail in a strait line: first, from <HI>England</HI> to the straight, and then from the straight to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> it would prove a farther way than the o∣ther by the Cape of <HI>Bonaspei.</HI> But those that know any thing of those seas, know that the sea course to any part of north <HI>America</HI> is as low as 23, 24, 25, or 30 the highest. For the wind which bloweth in the south sea east and west, as well as in the north, that is to say, for the most part west without the Tro∣picks, and almost constantly East within them.</P>
<P>Wherefore you must go out of your way aswell from the north part of <HI>America,</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="51"/>
as from <HI>England</HI> to this supposed Straight: and there is as much dif∣ference in relation to pleasantnesse in voyages, as between summer and winter. For when you are clean of the Bay of <HI>Biscai</HI> in all the voy∣age, by the Cape you find no cold weather till you return to the same place again, but to the contrary, is so cold &amp; icy about the Straight in the middle of Summer, that there is no making way without much difficulty and trouble.</P>
<P>And in the south sea, where the Sun keeps the same course as in the north in <HI>June,</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in compassing the world found so much cold in thirty eight degrees north latitude, that he was forced into a southerly course.</P>
<P>And this makes a strong proba∣bility that there is no sea to the north of <HI>America,</HI> but that the land of this New world reacheth by the north parts; even to the northward∣ly

Provinces of the Empire of <HI>Ja∣pan,</HI> or <HI>Tartaria.</HI> For I finde that the winds that blow West and north-west in <HI>England</HI> being sea winds are not so cold, as those that come east and north-east, which are land-winds. Which I appre∣hend the onely cause of difference in the temperature of the air with us, and the north parts of <HI>America.</HI> For <HI>New England</HI> that lyeth in 41 &amp; 42 is much colder in the winter then the most northwardly parts of <HI>England,</HI> which are in 56. And those parts of <HI>America,</HI> that are in that height are cold, almost the whole year through, as the un∣dertakers in the north passage plain∣ly prove, and this is caused cer∣tainly by the land-wind, which that height for the most part blow∣eth west, and northwardly, which is so much more colder, in regard it cometh from those vast Regions that are far thicker and untill'd

<P>On the land of the north-side <HI>Hudsons</HI> Straight, there hath been seen some of the wild Natives, but how they live is a kind of miracle.

<P>There are good store of the Na∣tives in these parts all alongst the Coast, and are willing to exchange such Commodities as they have, for such truck as the French bring them, although it is to be done

<P>The entrance into this strait is in 52 degrees, and the comming out into the south sea the same height.</P>
<P>It is an extream difficult passage by reason of the meeting of the north and south seas in the chan∣nell, driving each other back▪ pre∣vailing as they are favoured by the wind, which commonly bloweth there exceeding boysterously and cold. There are divers caves and bays in it, but no incouragement for a sea-man to adventure that way. The Inhabitants on this strait are few, and extream savage, nei∣ther is this passage any more in use: for those that will go by the south of <HI>America</HI> to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> or into the south sea to any part of the west coast of <HI>America,</HI> have a more convenient passage south of this strait in an open sea.

<P>On the coast of the south sea, which lyeth between the strait and <HI>Chilli,</HI> there are no inhabitants save the wild Natives, but it hath the Bay of horses in 52 degrees, and the Bay of Saint <HI>John</HI> in 50.

<P>THis coast reacheth to 28 de∣grees of south latitude. This Region is wholsome above all other in the <HI>Indies,</HI> being of an excellent temperature, as neither too hot nor too cold. It is abundantly rich in gold and silver mines, and all sorts of cattle &amp; grain, fruits &amp; excellent pleasant wine. The Countrey men are strong and valiant beyond com∣pare, which the Spaniards know to their great cost, for they could ne∣ver totally subdue this Nation. The Spaniards had formerly 12 Spanish towns in this Province, the most south was the City of <HI>Chillon</HI> in an Island of fifty leagues long, that almost joyneth to the firm

The City <HI>Imperiall</HI> in 39 degrees of height 3 leagues from the sea: in it was resident the Cathedrall, and two Monasteries of Friars. The City of Conception lyeth in 37 degrees neer the sea. And there did reside the Gover∣nour of the Countrey. The har∣bour is good, and made by an Island which lyeth before a nook in the land. The Port of <HI>Quoquim∣bo,</HI> is a good harbour, and standeth in 32 degrees. The town of <HI>Lasera∣na,</HI> is next to <HI>Peru.</HI> It lyeth plea∣santly

<P>THis Kingdome is governed by a Councill and Viceroy. It hath to the North the Councill of <HI>Quipo,</HI> on the south <HI>Charcas,</HI> and to the west the south sea, and to the east without limits. This King∣dome is well peopled with Civill orderly Indians, that are in great subjection to the Spaniards. <HI>Peru</HI> doth abound in all sorts of fruits, seed, cattle, horses, sheep, swine, rich mines of gold, silver, quick-sil∣ver, plentifull of wine, oil, and su∣gar. The <HI>Andes</HI> run through this Province within ten leagues of the sea. In all which coasts it never rai∣neth, but on the said hils it raineth continually, and beyond as in o∣ther
<PB N="177" REF="99"/>
Regions. The plains between the sea, and the said Hils, have few or no rivers, but the industrie of the Inhabitants draw in trenches, (which are artificially made) the water either from those few rivers, or from the side of the said <HI>Andes,</HI> which maketh that the said plain is mightily populous, fruitfull and pleasant even as a garden.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Lema</HI> is neer the south sea in 12 degrees of south la∣latitude, on the side of a rich and pleasant valley. It consisteth of 4000 houses. On the east-side of it runneth a fair river, by which the Citizens have Gardens with most excellent fruits. And this is the sole place in the world that is without thunder and lightning, which ne∣ver happen here, neither is there plague or pestilence, but the inhabi∣tants enjoy perpetually a clear and fair sky.

Quito</HI> lyeth between <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Popyan</HI> on the south sea, and far in∣to the land under the Equinoctiall line: and contrary to the opinion of the Ancients, it is a most whole∣some temperate Countrey, and ra∣ther cold than hot in most parts of it. In those places where the snowes continue all the year, it rai∣neth from <HI>October</HI> to <HI>March,</HI> which they call winter: this province is rich in Mines of Emraulds, and
<PB N="183" REF="102"/>
gold, silver and quick-silver, plen∣tifull of English grain and cattle, horse and swine. This Region is happy in the temperature of the air, there being neither extream cold nor heat, as lying Equinocti∣all to these Extreams, and which is most delightfull to mans nature always, a cleer skie. The Spanish towns are the City of Saint <HI>Francis,</HI> 60 leagues from the south sea, and half a league to the north of the Equinoctiall: in it are resident the Councill, the Officers of the Spa∣nish Kings Revenues, and a Ca∣thedrall with three Monasteries.

<P>It hath a good port on a river that runneth fair by the City fit for vessels of great burthen.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Porto Vivegio</HI> stan∣deth on the sea neer the borders of <HI>Peru,</HI> the Indians of this place have red warts that sometimes grow on their Noses and Foreheads, Cheeks and Chins, which eateth as a ring∣worm with us, but far more to the dis-figuring the face, and in extre∣mity of pain.</P>

<P>This Countrey is exceeding rich in gold mines, which maketh that the Spaniards endure the o∣ther inconveniences of the Coun∣trey with great patience.</P>
