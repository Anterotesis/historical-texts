<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS the late <HI>Revolution</HI> that has given birth to this new Piece of Work; a New Face of Things required a <HI>New State of Eng∣land.</HI> And of all the Changes this King∣dom has gone through, as this was the most sudden, so it is the most wonderfull. To see Popery in so few days crowing upon the Throne and groaning under its Ruins, but t'other day upon the Pinnacle and now stun∣ned with its sudden Fall, is such a Change as may deserve the Admiration of this and future Ages. In short, such is our present Settlement, upon Their Majesties happy Ac∣cession to the Crown, that the Popish Party may assoon see a Protestant Pope of Rome as a Popish King of England.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>Now, to make this Work the more accep∣table and usefull to the Publick, I have di∣vided it into three several Parts. In the <HI>First</HI> you have a particular Description of <HI>EN∣GLAND</HI> in its several Counties; of e∣very County-Town, with the Distance, and the common Road to it, from <HI>London</HI> the Metropolis; and of all other Places of note in each County. Here you have particularly a List of the Market-Towns in every Shire, with the Days pointed when their Markets are kept; also, an account of most other Remarkable Things, either of Nature or Art. Besides the Honours, or Noblemens Titles, from Counties, Cities, Towns, Man∣nors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Number of Men each City, or Borough, sends to serve in Parlia∣ment. I conclude this Part with a particular Description of <HI>London, Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Cam∣idge. London</HI> as the Capital City of England, the Seat of its Monarchs, and the Center of Trade. <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> as being the two famous Ʋniversities of the Land, and the glorious Seats of the Muses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second Part</HI> treats of the <HI>INHA∣BITANTS</HI> of England; their Com∣plexion,
<PB REF="4"/>Temper, Genius, Language, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of the English Way of Living, Commerce, Laws, Religion, and Government. Of the King of England, and the Royal Family; particularly of the present King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> with a brief Relation of their Accession to the Crown, and the Ʋn∣reasonableness of the Disaffected Party under their Government. Of Their Majesties Court, Forces, and Revenues. Of the Queen Dowager, the Prince, and the Prin∣cess of Denmark. Of the Nobility, Gen∣try, and Commonalty. Of the Episcopal, Dignify'd, and Inferiour Clergy. And last∣ly of Women, Children, and Servants. All of them with their respective Privi∣ledges.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> and <HI>last Part</HI> is about the <HI>COURTS</HI> of <HI>JUDICATURE.</HI> Viz. The High Court of Parliament, with a large Account of their Proceedings, Orders, Debates, Passing of Bills and Acts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of the Privy-Council, and there particular∣ly of the Principal Secretaries of State. Of the Chancery, Kings-Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer, Dutchy of Lancaster, and all
<PB REF="5"/>other Courts. To which is annexed a Cata∣logue of the chief Persons of the Realm both in Church and State, Magistrates, and Of∣ficers Civil and Military. Who being subject to Change, though the Offices continue the same, I thought it improper to mix Cer∣tainties and Ʋncertainties together. There∣fore I chose rather to place the Officers toge∣ther by themselves, as I have done here, than to have them dispersed where I speak of their Offices. And from this Method you will reap this Conveniency, that, by Interleaving of the Catalogue only, you may fill up Vacan∣cies as they become void.</P>
<P>Thus you have (as it were) a <HI>Scheme</HI> of the whole Drift of this Book. The Foundati∣on whereof is that Ingenious Piece <HI>De Repub∣lica Anglorum,</HI> written in Latin by <HI>Sir Tho∣mas Smith,</HI> Improved as you see, and fitted to the present Times. The Matter of it self, is of a general Ʋse both for English and Foreiners; and the Variety so great, that it cannot but be Pleasant and Ʋsefull to the Reader.</P>

<HEAD>THE TABLE For the First PART.</HEAD>
<P>This Table contains the Names of the Towns and Cities, Hills, Islands, Meers, and Rivers, and other Curiosities mentioned in the first Part of this Book. And for such as desire only to know what County any of them lies in, the Table it self will give them that Sa∣tisfaction, without any further Trouble; it being so contrived, that it is in a manner a Geographical Dictionary for England.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Treating of</HI> ENGLAND <HI>in ge∣neral, and of every</HI> County <HI>in particular.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">England</HEAD>
<P><HI>ENGLAND</HI> is the best and largest Part of the greatest Island of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> An Island anciently called <HI>Albion,</HI> from its white chalky Cliffs; but since better known by the Name of <HI>Great Britain. Great,</HI> for the vast Extent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, reaching (as it does) in Length, from North to South, about 600 Miles. <HI>Britain,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="21"/>that is, a Country Inhabited by Painted Men, as formerly they were wont to be.</P>
<P>At this time 'tis principally divided into three Parts, <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> the first two being two distinct Kingdoms, the last a Principality, but all of them happily united under one Head.</P>
<P><HI>ENGLAND</HI> takes up the South Parts of the Island, being parted from <HI>Scotland</HI> North∣ward by the River <HI>Tweede;</HI> from <HI>Wales</HI> West∣ward, in part by the River <HI>Dee;</HI> and from the rest of the World, by the <HI>Ocean.</HI> Thus it con∣tains in Length, from North to South, as from <HI>Barwick</HI> to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> 320 miles; and in breadth, from East to West, as from <HI>Dover</HI> to the Lands End, 270.</P>
<P>But such is the Variety of its Breadth, that in the South Parts, which face the Channel, 'tis three times the Breadth of the North. And all along the Sea-Coast in general there are so many Creeks and Inlets, some greater and some lesser, that <HI>England</HI> (and indeed the whole Island) delineated as it is in Globes and Maps, makes but an odd kind of Figure. However in this Spot of Ground, not exceeding one third Part of <HI>France,</HI> there are reckoned 30 millions of Acres.</P>
<P>In reference to the Globe, it lies between the 50, and 57 Degree of North Latitude; the longest Day in the most Northern Parts being 17 hours, 30 minutes; and the shortest in the most Southern, almost eight hours long.</P>
<P>The name of <HI>ENGLAND</HI> it took from the <HI>Angles,</HI> an ancient People of <HI>Jutland</HI> in <HI>Denmark;</HI> who, joyning with their Neighbours the <HI>Saxons,</HI> went under their Name in the Conquest of <HI>Britain.</HI> And this Name was
<PB N="3" REF="21"/>given it by a special Edict of <HI>Egbert,</HI> the first sole Monarch of <HI>England,</HI> since the Hep∣tarchy. Who, being descended from those <HI>Angles,</HI> and having reduced the whole Coun∣try from a divided State into one intire Body, called it (with the Concurrence of the States of the Realm, then convened at <HI>Winchester,</HI> Anno 819.) by the Name of <HI>Engle-lond,</HI> since turned into <HI>ENGLAND.</HI> From whence the Nation and Language came to be called <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Romans</HI> were possessed of this Country, they made but two Parts of it, and another of <HI>Wales.</HI> Called

<ITEM><HI>Britannia Secunda,</HI> Contain∣ing Wales.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Maxima Caesariensis,</HI> Contain∣ing the North of England.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Their particular Divisions were not of the Country it self, but of the Inhabitants. As the <HI>Atrebatii, Belgae, Brigantes, Catieuchlani,</HI> and ten Nations more they reckoned only in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the time of the <HI>Anglo-Saxons, England</HI> alone was divided into seven Kingdoms, <HI>Viz.</HI>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Advantages</HI> of ENGLAND <HI>from its</HI> Situation, <HI>in opposition to Inland Countries. The natural</HI> Beauty <HI>of it. A Description of its principal</HI> Rivers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF all the <HI>States</HI> of Europe, there's none more happy than <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> whe∣ther we consider the Advantages of its <HI>Situation,</HI> the Temperateness of its <HI>Air,</HI> the
<PB N="8" REF="24"/>Richness of its <HI>Soil,</HI> the happy temper of its <HI>In∣habitants,</HI> or the Blessed Constitution of its <HI>Go∣vernment,</HI> especially under their present Ma∣jesties.</P>
<P>As it is in a manner surrounded by the <HI>Sea,</HI> it injoys Two great <HI>Advantages,</HI> the One in Re∣lation to foreign <HI>Trade,</HI> and the Other in point of Security from forein <HI>Invasion.</HI></P>
<P>In relation to forein <HI>Trade,</HI> it lies open to all Parts of the World that are adjacent to the Sea, either for the Exportation of home∣bred, or the Importation of foreign Commo∣dities. To which purpose, as Nature has fenced its Sea-Coasts from the Irruptions and Inunda∣tions of the Sea with high <HI>Cliffs,</HI> so she has fur∣nished it with abundance of safe and capacious <HI>Harbours</HI> for the security of Ships.</P>
<P>As for a forein <HI>Invasion,</HI> 'tis certain, that Islands of any great Importance, are by Nature the most defensible Places, and the least open to Conquests. The Sea, that fluid Element which surrounds them, is such a Bar to their E∣nemies Attempts; the Winds that govern it, so fickle and uncertain; the Charges of a Fleet and Land Army so vast; the Preparations such as cannot be carried on with that speed and se∣crecy as for an Invasion by Land; and the Dif∣ficulty of Landing so great, in case of Opposi∣tion.</P>
<P>'Tis true no Continent perhaps was oftener Conquered than <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> first by the <HI>Romans,</HI> then by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> afterwards by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and last of all by the <HI>Normans.</HI> But how was it done? always by the help of some dis∣contented, or corrupted Party in the Island. Thus <HI>Bericus,</HI> a noble (but disgusted) <HI>Britain,</HI> incouraged <HI>Claudius</HI> the Roman Emperour, to stretch his Empire hither. And <HI>Vortiger</HI> an Usur∣per
<PB N="9" REF="24"/>of the British Throne, called in the Saxons to his help; who, having got a footing here, could not be so easily expelled as brought in. In short, it may be said, England was never, and can scarce be Conquered but by England; especially since its happy Conjunction with <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and the Annexion of <HI>Wales.</HI> As to the late <HI>Revolution,</HI> 'tis self evident, that the chief Part of the Nation had a hand in it; and as it proved, we may justly call it, not an Invasion, (as King <HI>James</HI> affected to do,) but a wonderful and signal Deliverance.</P>
<P>To those Two great Advantages of <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Security,</HI> which England does injoy from its Si∣tuation near the Sea, let us add the Prospect it has from the Sea-Coast of the wonderful <HI>Ocean,</HI> one of the three great Antiquities of the World; and the plentiful Variety of Fish, and Sea-Fowl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it affords to this Island.</P>
<P>But that which raises my Admiration of <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> is the <HI>Beauty</HI> of it, being gene∣rally a flat and open Country, not overgrown with wild and unwholsom Forests, nor dreadful high Mountains. What <HI>Hills</HI> it has are gene∣rally very gentle and pleasant, and raised as it were to give a charming Prospect to the Eye; as its <HI>Forests</HI> seem only contrived for Variety, and the pleasure of Hunting.</P>
<P>But one Thing there is, which adds much to the Beauty of it, and that is its excellent <HI>Verdure.</HI> Which by reason of the mildness of the Air, even in the Winter-Season, exceeds in dura∣tion of Time the most fruitful Places of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></P>
<P>To which add the Concourse of so many <HI>Ri∣vers,</HI> which glide through this Country, and strive to make it agreeable and fruitful.</P>

<P>They are reckoned in all 325, the chief where∣of are these following. <HI>Viz.</HI>

</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Thames</HI> is a Compound of the <HI>Thame</HI> and <HI>Isis,</HI> two Rivers, the first whereof rises in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> the other near <HI>Cirencester</HI> in <HI>Glo∣cestershire,</HI> both joyning together into one Stream by Dorcester in Oxfordshire, where it parts that County from Barkshire. From whence taking its course Eastward, with many Wind∣ings and Turnings, it parts <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> from <HI>Barkshire, Middlesex</HI> from <HI>Surrey,</HI> and <HI>Essex</HI> from <HI>Kent.</HI> Where being swelled with the In∣flux of several lesser Rivers, it discharges it self into the Sea; watering by the way, amongst o∣ther Towns, <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Windsor</HI> in Barkshire, <HI>Kingston</HI> and <HI>Southwark</HI> in <HI>Surrey, London</HI> in Middlesex, <HI>Barking</HI> in Essex, and <HI>Gravesend</HI> in Kent. A River the Water whereof is extra∣ordinary wholsom, the Stream exceeding gentle, and the Tides very commodious for Naviga∣tion. For the Sea flows gently up this River a∣bout 80 Miles, almost as far as <HI>Kingston,</HI> being 12 Miles by Land, and 20 by Water, above London.</P>
<P>The <HI>Medway</HI> is a Kentish River, not so re∣markable for the length of its Course, as for the Depth of its Channel; and therefore made use of for harbouring the Royal Navy. It runs thorough <HI>Maidstone, Rochester</HI> and <HI>Chatham,</HI> a few Miles from whence it empties it self in the Mouth of the <HI>Thames.</HI> This River loses it self
<PB N="11" REF="25"/>under Ground, and rises again at <HI>Loose,</HI> not far from <HI>Cox-Heath.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Severn</HI> rises in <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> a County of North-Wales. From whence it runs through <HI>Shropshire, Worcestershire,</HI> and <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> where it does so expatiate it self, that the Mouth of it is more like an Arm of the Sea, than any part of a River. It waters in its course <HI>Shrews∣bury, Worcester</HI> and <HI>Glocester,</HI> the chief Towns of the foresaid three Counties; and takes in by the way several Rivers of good note, two <HI>Avons,</HI> the <HI>Temd,</HI> the <HI>Wye,</HI> and the <HI>Ʋsk.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ouse</HI> has its source in the South-Borders of <HI>Northamptonshire.</HI> From whence it runs through the Counties of <HI>Bucks, Bedford, Huntington, Cam∣bridge,</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> where it discharges it self in∣to the Ocean; watering in its Course <HI>Bucking∣ham, Bedford, Huntington, Ely,</HI> and the Sea-Port of <HI>Lyn</HI> in Norfolk. The River that runs through York, has also the Name of <HI>Ouse,</HI> being a Com∣pound chiefly of these three Yorkshire Rivers, the <HI>Swale,</HI> the <HI>Youre,</HI> and the <HI>Warfe.</HI> And be∣tween <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> you will find the little <HI>Ouse,</HI> which parting these Two Counties, runs at last into the great <HI>Ouse.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Trent,</HI> which divides England into Two Parts, North and South, has its Rise in <HI>Staf∣fordshire;</HI> and from thence runs through <HI>Darby∣shire, Nottinghamshire,</HI> and <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> where it falls into the <HI>Humber</HI> not far from <HI>Hull.</HI> It wa∣ters in its course these three chief Places, <HI>Not∣tingham, Newark,</HI> and <HI>Gainsborough.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Humber</HI> is a Yorkshire River, if that can be called a distinct River which has no Spring of its own, but is more properly a Compound (or rather a Mouth) of several Rivers joyning into one Stream, especially the <HI>Trent,</HI> and the <HI>York Ouse,</HI> the <HI>Dun,</HI> and the <HI>Darewent.</HI> The Town of
<PB N="12" REF="26"/><HI>Hull</HI> is seated upon it, before which Place it widens it self (much like the <HI>Severn</HI> at its Mouth) to a great breadth, and so falls into the Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tees</HI> is another River of the North, parting <HI>Yorkshire</HI> from the <HI>Bishoprick of Dur∣ham,</HI> and running from West to East into the Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tine,</HI> famous for its Coal-trade, parts for some Miles <HI>Durham</HI> from <HI>Northumberland,</HI> run∣ning likewise from West to East Seaward, by <HI>Newcastle,</HI> therefore called <HI>Newcastle upon Tine.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Twede</HI> is the furthest River Northward, and that which parts <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland.</HI> At the Influx whereof into the Sea is seated <HI>Barwick,</HI> called from this River <HI>Barwick upon Twede.</HI></P>
<P>But, besides these principal Rivers, and many others of less note, though several of them Na∣vigable, I cannot but mention those pleasant <HI>Rivulets</HI> and <HI>Brooks</HI> which are so numerous in this Country. Whose clear and swift-running Streams add much to the Beauty and Fruitful∣ness of it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the</HI> Air <HI>of</HI> ENGLAND. <HI>Its Temperateness, and the Effects of it.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the Situation of <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> so far North as it is, one would think the <HI>Air</HI> should be pretty sharp here, and at least colder than in France, which lies South from it. Whereas it is so Temperate, Winter and Sum∣mer, that the Winters are milder here, and the Summers much more moderate.</P>
<P>In Winter-time the warm Vapours of the Sea on every side do so thicken the <HI>Air,</HI> that it can∣not so soon penetrate as the thin Air of hot Countries. In Summer the frequent Interposi∣tion of Clouds, often dissolving into Rain, and the usual Blasts from the Sea, allay those ex∣cessive Heats, which both hot and cold Cli∣mates are troubled with in that Season, for want of Wind and Rain.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>ENGLAND</HI> has the happiness of being seldom tired, either with a long <HI>Frost</HI> in Winter, or <HI>Drought</HI> in Summer. On the con∣trary, while Continents in the same Latitude, and some of a much more Southern Situation, ly under Snow, pinched with a hard Frost, it happens often that our Fields are here cloathed with Grass, as in the Spring. And whilst the Sun in Summer scorches the Plants, and the In∣habitants themselves of hot Climates, here it shines so kindly, that it does but warm us by
<PB N="14" REF="27"/>a moderate Heat, which makes the Country so plentiful both of Corn and Pasture.</P>
<P>'Tis true, on the other side, the Air is no∣thing so pure, nor the Weather so serene, or regular, as it is in Continents. Most part of the Winter <HI>ENGLAND</HI> is under a Cloud, often stuffed up with Fogs, troubled with rainy Weather, and (except there happens a Frost) but seldom injoying the Sun in its splendour. Whence proceed those frequent <HI>Colds,</HI> which are in a manner the original Cause of most of our Distempers; and from the frequency of Rain, <HI>Land-floods,</HI> which drown the Countries where the Rivers swell out of their Channels, and break over their Banks.</P>
<P>And yet, as rainy as this Country is, we sel∣dom see here such impetuous Showers (or rather Storms) of Rain, as hot Countries are subject to, which often drown the fairest Hopes of the Husbandman. For, if they have Rain but sel∣dom, they have it by the great, and sometimes with a Vengeance. Whereas in England, where it is more frequent, it proves most com∣monly a gentle soaking Rain.</P>
<P>But there is another Inconveniency in the Weather here, and that is its <HI>Changeableness,</HI> and <HI>Irregularity,</HI> according to the Wind that blows. Which happens sometimes to be so fre∣quent and sudden, that in the space of 24 hours I have observed four different sorts of Weather, proper enough for the four Seasons of the Year. This I confess, is an extraordinary Case. But however such is the Mutableness of the Wea∣ther, that it seldom holds out many Days in the same degree, either of Warmth, Coldness, or Driness. And of all Times of the Year, the Month of March is the most subject to Change, witness the usual Expression, <HI>March Many-wea∣ther.</HI></P>
<PB N="15" REF="27"/>
<P>And yet this may be said for Changeableness of Weather, that it creates Diversion by its Variety. What is more comfortable in Win∣ter than a warm Day after a fit of cold Wea∣ther; and a cool Day in Summer, after a fit of hot Weather? The quickest and most re∣fined Pleasures grow dull by their Continuance, but Change sets an edge upon 'em. And, as glorious as the Sun appears in its greatest splendour, I have oftentimes been weary of its undiscontinued Appearance for a long time to∣gether.</P>
<P>On the other side <HI>ENGLAND</HI> is nothing near so subject to <HI>Hail,</HI> to <HI>Thunder,</HI> and <HI>Lightning,</HI> or to the Heavens darting of <HI>Thunderbolts,</HI> as many other Regions, which are frequently a∣larmed with those dreadful Meteors.</P>
<P>And, if Nature be somewhat too prodigal of Moisture in this Country, she is on the other side as careful to cure it. Scarce a fit of Rain is over, but comes a fit of <HI>Wind</HI> to dry up the Moisture, and purify the Air. So that the most part of the Year is commonly divided be∣twixt these two Gods of the Heathens, <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Aeolus.</HI></P>
<P>The Wind that reigns most in <HI>ENGLAND</HI> is the <HI>Westerly Wind,</HI> which blows from the vast Western Ocean perhaps three parts in four of the Year. But when I say a Westerly Wind, I don't mean only that which blows directly from the Cardinal Point, but all the Collateral Points from South to North.</P>
<P>An <HI>Easterly Wind,</HI> especially in the Spring, is lookt upon here to be fatal to Plants; and if the Proverb be true, to Man and Beast.</P>
<P>For <HI>high Winds,</HI> and <HI>tempestuous Weather,</HI> we have here two Times of the Year, seldom free from it. And those are the two Equinoxes,
<PB N="16" REF="28"/>in September and March. But for <HI>Hurricanes,</HI> and <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> England of all the Countries in Europe, is the least subject to 'em. The Storm indeed which hapned on the 12th of Ja∣nuary last, was so very violent, blew with such impetuous Gusts, and proved so mischievous, that it may pass for an Hurricane. But it was such as the like has not been known here within the Memory of Man.</P>
<P>In short, whatever be the Disadvantages of <HI>ENGLAND</HI> in point of <HI>Air,</HI> in respect to other Countries, the same is sufficiently coun∣tervailed by the Sweetness and Comforts of it, as 'twill further appear by the insuing Chap∣ter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the</HI> Products <HI>of</HI> ENGLAND, <HI>both from the Land and Water, and the</HI> Fruitfulness <HI>thereof.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>'TIS said of Henry the Seventh, one of the wisest Kings that ever sat upon the Throne of England, but whose Breeding had been low and private, That, be∣ing once pressed by some of his Council to pur∣sue his Title to France, he returned this An∣swer; 'Tis true, says he, France <HI>is a noble and gallant Kingdom, but</HI> England <HI>in my mind is as fine a Seat for a Country Gentleman as any is in Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I pass by the Reflection; and taking his An∣swer in a plain literal Sense, I own, that En∣gland
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>is, in most Things, one of the finest and best Countries in Europe. I have already de∣monstrated wherein its Beauty consists, and now the Subject of this Chapter shall be its Plentifulness.</P>
<P>And first for <HI>Corn,</HI> either for Man or Beast, it may cerainly outvy most Countries in Eu∣rope; As it may for <HI>Pasture,</HI> which makes the Cattel thrive here exceedingly. And, though here be many Heaths, yet they are not so barren, but that they afford wherewithall to feed a World of Sheep.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>ENGLAND</HI> yields, not only Plen∣ty of <HI>Corn,</HI> to make Bread and Drink with, &amp;c. but also abundance of all manner of <HI>Cattle,</HI> for wholesom substantial Food; with plenty of <HI>Salt, Cheese,</HI> and <HI>Butter.</HI> For Dainties and Variety, 'tis stocked with <HI>Fallow Deer,</HI> beyond any part of Europe. <HI>Hares</HI> and <HI>Conies,</HI> tame and wild <HI>Fowl,</HI> eatable <HI>Roots</HI> and <HI>Herbs, Fruits</HI> of most sorts it has abundance of. And so constant is the Continuance of these Things in England, by reason of the Clemency of the Air, that it has not felt a Famine for several Ages.</P>
<P>The Sea and Rivers, on the other side, fur∣nish it with plenty of all manner of <HI>Fish,</HI> as <HI>Herrings, Mackerels, Whitings, Pilchards, Soles, Plaices, Flounders, Cods, Salmons, Sturgeons, Lampreys, Congers, Turbots, Thornbaeks, Lohsters,</HI> and <HI>Oysters,</HI> &amp;c. these last being famous, a∣mong the old Romans, for their extraordinary goodness. Here is also abundance of <HI>Carps. Pikes, Perches, Trouts, Gudgeons, Tenches, Roaches, Daces, Breams, Eeles, Cray-fish,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Spices</HI> we have, as all the rest of Europe, from the East and West-Indies; and from this last, that inchanting Commodity which has got so
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>much the vogue here, I mean <HI>Tobacco.</HI> Not but that the English Soil can bear it plenti∣fully, as has been found by Experience; but, because it is more proper, for several Reasons of State, to fetch it at that di∣stance.</P>
<P>In short, what other Things <HI>ENGLAND</HI> wants, whether for delight or fancy, are easi∣ly supplied by Sea from those Countries where they grow; which either exchange 'em fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mony, or such Commodities of our Growth as we can spare, and they stand in need of.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Wine,</HI> 'tis said indeed the South Parts of <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> as <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Hamp∣shire</HI> amongst others, have had formerly great Numbers of Vineyards, and (as the Summe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proved) made of them tolerable Wine. But since better Wine could be had from o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Neighbours at an easier rate, the Vineyard were laid aside, and the Soil turned to bette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> account. And yet, when the Season does an∣swer to the singular Care and Industry of the Husbandman, I may say this without Pre∣judice, and from my own Experience, that England then affords in some Places as good and delicious <HI>Grapes</HI> as most Parts of France. The same I may aver of some other Fruits, as <HI>Peache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> amongst others; but then I must confess, Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has a great hand in it.</P>
<P>Lastly, The want of Wine is otherwise sup∣plied by <HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Ale,</HI> the usual Drinks of the Country. Which, rightly made, is as whole∣som a Liquour, though not so cheerful, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wine.</P>
<P>Now for <HI>Rayment,</HI> English <HI>Wool</HI> is famous all over the World, both for its fineness and

Of this Wool are made excellent broad <HI>Cloths,</HI> dispersed not only all over England, but all over the World, especially high Germany, Poland, Mos∣covy, Turky, and Persia, to the great bene∣fit of this Kingdom. For the advancing of which Manufacture, that necessary Earth, called <HI>Fullers-Earth,</HI> is no where else produ∣ced in that abundance and excellency as in En∣gland.</P>
<P>For <HI>Flax</HI> and <HI>Hemp,</HI> to make <HI>Linnen</HI> of, here is a great deal of good and proper Soil; which I wonder should not be improved for that purpose, rather than have so much <HI>Lin∣nen</HI> imported as there is from beyond Sea. But, as for <HI>Leather,</HI> here's great Plenty of it, and such as is excellent for all manner of Use. And, as England does swarm with <HI>Conies,</HI> their Furs go a great way for the making of Hats.</P>
<P><HI>Silks</HI> also might be here produced, as it was once designed by King James the first.</P>
<P>For other necessary Conveniences, as for building of <HI>Houses, ENGLAND</HI> wants not Materials, except such <HI>Timber</HI> as comes from Norway. For <HI>Firing,</HI> here is indeed in most Places a Scarcity of <HI>Wood;</HI> but that Defect is abundantly supplied by the <HI>Coal-Mines.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Shipping,</HI> no where better <HI>Oak.</HI> For <HI>Land-Carriage,</HI> Plenty of good stout Horses. For <HI>Hunting,</HI> or <HI>Racing,</HI> such as are incompara∣ble. And for <HI>Beauty</HI> or <HI>Fineness,</HI> scarce any Country like this.</P>
<P><HI>Dogs</HI> of all sorts, sizes, and uses are also to be found here. Amongst which the <HI>Mastiffs,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>whether Bear or Bull-dogs, are extraordinary, the first for their Size, and both for their Stoutness. Our <HI>Spaniels</HI> also, and all sorts of <HI>Hounds</HI> for Hunting, are of great request be∣yond Sea.</P>
<P>For <HI>Smell</HI> and <HI>Ornament,</HI> here all sorts of <HI>Flowers,</HI> even those that come from the remo∣test Countries, thrive to admiration. But no Region perhaps abounds like this in <HI>Laurel</HI> and <HI>Rosemary,</HI> two remarkable Plants for their perpetual Greenness.</P>
<P>For <HI>Physical Ʋses,</HI> it scarce wants any <HI>Simple.</HI> Here grows plenty of excellent <HI>Saffron</HI> and <HI>Li∣corish;</HI> neither does it want <HI>Hony</HI> or <HI>Wax,</HI> of the best fort. Here are also <HI>hot Baths,</HI> and abundance of <HI>Medicinal Springs.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to those inexhaustible Trea∣sures of <HI>Coals, Lead, Copper, Tin,</HI> and <HI>Iron,</HI> which are dug out of the Bowels of the Earth in this Kingdom. The <HI>Coal-mines</HI> do chiefly in∣rich Newcastle in Northumberland, from whence a great part of the Kingdom is sup∣plied with Coals for Fewel; without which it could not possibly subsist, so great is the Decay of Woods, and the Neglect of plant∣ing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lead-Mines</HI> are most considerable in the Peak of Derbyshire; and those of <HI>Tin</HI> in Cornwal, where they dig Tin not much infe∣riour to Silver in fineness. Here are also <HI>Cop∣per-Mines,</HI> but herein Cumberland does exceed it. As for the <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Iron,</HI> 'tis true they bring more Damage to the Publick by the Spoil of Woods, than the Profit that accrues thereby to private Persons amounts to.</P>
<P>Here are also <HI>Silver-Mines,</HI> as in <HI>Cornwal, Lancashire,</HI> and the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> richer than the very Mines of Potosi, in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>whence the King of Spain has most of his Silver. For, whereas these yield usually but one Ounce and a half of Silver in one hun∣dred Ounces of Oar, our English Mines com∣monly yield six or eight Ounces per Cent. 'Tis true ours lying deeper, and harder to come unto, and the Workmen being dear (which is otherwise in <HI>Potosi,</HI>) all these things concurring together, are like to secure them from any further Attempt.</P>
<P>In short, though some Countries excel <HI>ENGLAND</HI> in some Things, yet this may be said of it in general; That there is scarce any Country, whose Fields are better stored with all sort of <HI>Corn;</HI> the Pastures, with <HI>Cat∣tel;</HI> the Woods, and Forrests, Parks, and War∣rens, with <HI>wild Beasts,</HI> only for Recreation and Food; the Air with <HI>Birds</HI> and <HI>Fowls;</HI> the Seas and Rivers, with <HI>Fishes;</HI> and the Mines with <HI>Coals</HI> and <HI>Metals.</HI></P>
<P>On the other side, there is scarce a Coun∣try so little troubled with <HI>hurtful</HI> and <HI>ravenous Beasts,</HI> with <HI>venomous Serpents,</HI> or noisom <HI>Flies</HI> and <HI>Vermine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wolves,</HI> which of all ravenous Beasts are the most pernicious and destructive of Cattel, have been so wonderfully extirpated out of this Land, that I cannot omit the History of it. I know it has been a Tradition of old Writers, that <HI>England</HI> never had any <HI>Wolves</HI> at all, and that being brought hither from other Places, they would not live. But History tells us the contrary, here being abundance of them, till King <HI>Edgar</HI> commuted for 300 Wolves the yearly Tribute paid him by the Prince of Wales. Which made the Welch so industrious and active in Wolf-hunting, that the Wolves were in time quite rooted out of the Land,
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>the Welch protesting at last, they could find no more of 'em.</P>
<P>Whereby 'tis come to pass, that whereas in other Countries they are at the Charge and Trouble of guarding their Sheep, and housing them by night, here they are left feeding in the Fields day and night, secure from any Danger, unless it be sometimes from <HI>Men-Wolves,</HI> or Sheep-stealers.</P>
<P>And yet I am credibly informed, that in some Places, as Warwickshire among the rest, some Wolves from time to time have been discovered. But, as it happens but sel∣dom, so upon the least notice the Country rises amain, as it were against a common Ene∣my; there being such a hue and cry after the Wolf, that it is hard for him to escape the <HI>Posse Comitatus.</HI></P>

<P><HI>BARKSHIRE, BERKSHIRE,</HI> or <HI>BERKS,</HI> is an Inland County. 'Tis bounded on the <HI>North</HI> by the Thames and Isis, which part it from Oxfordshire; On the <HI>South,</HI> by Hampshire; <HI>Eastward,</HI> by Sur∣rey;

<P>The Country is very pleasant, the Air sweet, and the Soil fruitful.</P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Isis</HI> and the <HI>Thames,</HI> which wa∣ter the North Parts of it, the <HI>Kennet</HI> is the principal River, which runs into the Thames at Reading, and yields excellent Trouts, espe∣cially about Hungerford.</P>

<P>Amongst which <HI>Wallingford</HI> and <HI>Abington,</HI> are two Towns of great Antiquity, and such as have flourished in their time, but since gone to decay. The first being the <HI>Guallena</HI> of the
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>Ancients, and then the chief Town of the <HI>At∣trebatii,</HI> was afterwards also among the West Saxons the chief Town of this County. A Mile in compass at that time within the Walls, for∣tified with a strong Castle, and adorned with 12 Parish Churches. But in the Year 1348, so desolated by a Plague, that there is now but one Church left, hardly Inhabitants enough to keep that in repair; and nothing of the Walls left (as not much of the Castle) but the Tract and Ruins of 'em. However as it is seat∣ed upon the Thames (over which it has a Bridge,) it makes shift to support it self by its Trade of Maulting, and its Commodiousness for Transporting Corn and other Commodities to London. And so doth <HI>Abington,</HI> which lies North-West from it, at the fall of the <HI>Ouse</HI> into the <HI>Isis.</HI> Noted for giving the Title of an Earl∣dom to the Right Honourable <HI>James Bertie,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Abington,</HI> Baron <HI>Norreys,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Windsor,</HI> on the <HI>Thames</HI> is chiefly remarkable for its Castle, the finest Royal Pallace of Eng∣land, and the only Castle of six this County has formerly had, which is now remaining. Which being seated on a great Eminence, with a stately and spacious Terrass before it, injoys a pure Air, and a delicate Prospect. Famous for being the Place where the Ceremony of the Knights of the Garter is solemnized on St. George's Day.</P>
<P><HI>Newbury</HI> and <HI>Hungerford</HI> are both seated on the River <HI>Kennet,</HI> few Miles distant from each other. The first, of chief note for the Batte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fought here in the long Civil Wars, called <HI>New∣bury Fight,</HI> where King <HI>Charles</HI> I. remained victo∣rious.

<P>This County, formerly a Part of the ancient Kingdom of the West-Saxons, (the Inhabitants whereof called <HI>Attrebatii</HI> by the ancient Ro∣mans,) is in the Diocese of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> Dignified with the Title of an Earldom, in the person of the Right Honourable <HI>Thomas Howard,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Barkshire,</HI> Viscount <HI>Andover,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>A memorable Thing is recorded of this River <HI>Ouse,</HI> which I am unwilling to pretermit.

<HEAD>Cam∣bridge∣shire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAMBRIDGESHIRE,</HI> another In∣land County, has for its Bounds <HI>East∣ward,</HI> both Suffolk and Norfolk; <HI>West∣ward,</HI> Northampton, Huntington, and Bedford shires; <HI>Northward,</HI> Lincolnshire; <HI>Scuthward,</HI> Essex, and Hartfordshire.</P>
<P>It extends it self in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, 35 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, 20. The Whole divided into 17 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> 163 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 8 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis for the most part a pleasant, fruitful, Champain Country, abounding in all Things necessary, stored with Meadows and Pastures, plentiful of Corn and Barley, and abundantly furnished with Fish and Fowl. The Northern Parts indeed are Fenny, and therefore less fruit∣ful of Corn.</P>
<P>But that Defect is sufficiently supplied ano∣ther way, I mean by that plenty of Cattel, Fish, and Fowl that are bred in those Fens. 'Tis true the <HI>Air,</HI> in those Parts, is something the worse for them.</P>
<P>One Thing this County may boast of, besides <HI>Essex;</HI> viz. the Saffron it yields in great plenty, which is the dearest Commodity that England produces.</P>
<P>The Herb called <HI>Scordium,</HI> or Water Ger∣mander (of which the Cordial <HI>Dioscordium</HI> is made) grows here also very plentifully.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
<P>About 2 miles South-Eastward from Cam∣bridge is a Ridge of Hills, called <HI>Hog-magog Hills,</HI> retaining yet the remembrance of the Danish Station, and whereof the Country peo∣ple tell fine fabulous Stories. On the top of these Hills is seen a Rampier, so strengthen∣ed formerly with a threefold Trench, that the Place was counted to be in a manner Impreg∣nable.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> here is the <HI>Ouse,</HI> which runs through the midst of it from West to East, and then bending its Course to the North, parts this County from Norfolk, till it discharges it self at Lyn into the Sea. The South Parts are watered with two lesser Streams, the one called <HI>Cam,</HI> and the other <HI>Grant,</HI> both which joyn together into one Stream near Cambridge, under the first Name, and so run together Northward into the <HI>Ouse.</HI> The North Parts indeed are too much watered by the frequent Overflowings of the <HI>Ouse,</HI> and other Streams, that have turned most of those Parts into Marshes.</P>
<P>I should now fall to the Description of <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> but that it is a Place of that Conse∣quence as to deserve a particular Description by it self. For which I refer you, together with that of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to the Conclusion of this Part. And so I proceed to a View of the other Places of chief note in this County, which are Mar∣ket-Towns, besides Cambridge.</P>

<P>Among which <HI>Ely</HI> is situate in an Isle of that name, occasioned by the divided streams of the <HI>Ouse</HI> and other lesser Rivers, turning a great part of this Tract into Fens and Mar∣shes. A Place of no great beauty or reputa∣tion, being seated in a foggy and unhealthful Air; but only for being a Bishops See, and a County Palatine, since the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eign of Hen∣ry I.</P>
<P><HI>Newmarket</HI> is partly in this County, and partly in Suffolk. It stands in such a plain, that it has a Prospect three quarters of the Compass, almost to the Bounds of the Horizon; the South-East Parts being more rising Ground, and ending in Woodland. A famous Plain both for Hunting and Horse-races, where the Kings of England use yearly to divertise themselves for some Days before Winter. To which pur∣pose there is a House built, on Cambridge side, for their Reception. The Town it self is composed of a well-built Street; and being a great Thorough-fare, the Townsmen live chiefly upon Passengers; besides the Advan∣tage of the Court, when the King goes thi∣ther. It consists of two Parishes, one in Suffolk, the other in Cambridgeshire. Its Market is well served, particularly with Fish and wild Fowl from the fenny Parts, as it is with Pigeons from the Fiekling. The Women here imploy themselves very much in spinning of white Work. And, not far from this Town, is the huge Ditch, called the <HI>Devil's Ditch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Royston</HI> stands in the bottom of a Hill, part∣ly in this County, and partly in Hartfordshire. Whose Market is very considerable, for Malt especially.</P>
<P>Lastly, this County (which formerly was
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>Part of the Kingdom of the East-Angles, and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Iceni,</HI> as the Romans called them) is now in the Diocess of <HI>Ely.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the 2 Knights of the Shire, 4 Members of Parliament; viz. 2 by the Town of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and 2 more by the <HI>Ʋniversity.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Cheshire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CHESHIRE,</HI> a Maritime County in the North-West Parts of England, is bounded on the <HI>East</HI> by Derbyshire and Staffordshire; on the <HI>West,</HI> partly by the Irish Sea, partly by Flintshire and Denbighshire, two Counties of Wales; <HI>Northward,</HI> by Lancashire; <HI>Southward,</HI> part by Denbighshire, and part by Shropshire and Staffordshire.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, about 45 Miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, 25. The Whole divieled into 7 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> 85 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 13 <HI>Market Towns.</HI></P>
<P>As flat as this Country is, yet it is not with∣out several noted <HI>Hills,</HI> besides the Mountains which divide it from Darby and Stafford Shires. It has also several <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Forests,</HI> as namely Delamere and Maclesfield Forests; and is so well stored with <HI>Parks,</HI> that almost every Gen∣tleman has one peculiar to himself.</P>
<P><HI>Heaths</HI> and <HI>Mosses</HI> are frequent here; but the first serve to feed Sheep, and Horses, and Mos∣ses to make Turves of for Fewel.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> this Country is well watered with them; the South-west Parts, with the <HI>Dee;</HI> the middle, with the <HI>Weever;</HI> and the North Parts, with the Mersey, which divides this County from Lancashire. The <HI>Dee</HI> affords great plenty of Sal∣mon. And 'tis observable of this River, that upon the fall of much Rain, it rises but little; but, if the South Wind beat long upon it, it swells
<PB N="37" REF="38"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd overflows the Grounds adjoyning. Here are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lso many <HI>Meres,</HI> and <HI>Pools,</HI> in all which are a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undance of excellent Fish.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Air</HI> for Temperature, and the <HI>Soil</HI> for Fertility, is inferiour to none, and far ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeding the Neighbouring Counties.</P>
<P>Its chief Commodities are Corn, Cattel, Sheep, Fish, Fowl, Salt, and Cheese, the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n all England.</P>
<P><HI>Chester,</HI> (otherwife called <HI>West-Chester,</HI> by reason of its Western Situation) is the chief Place of this County, bearing from <HI>London</HI> North-West, and distant therefrom (by com∣mon Computation) 150 Miles, thus. <HI>Viz.</HI> from London to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> 20. from thence to <HI>Stony-Stratford,</HI> 24; to <HI>Daventry,</HI> 16 more; from Daventry to <HI>Coventry,</HI> 22; thence to <HI>Lichfield,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o more; to <HI>Stone</HI> 18; to <HI>Nantwich,</HI> 15; and to <HI>Chester,</HI> 15 more.</P>
<P>This City was raised from the Fort <HI>Ostorius,</HI> Lieutenant of Britain for the Emperour Clau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius. And 'tis pleasantly seated on the River Dee, about 25 miles from its fall into the Sea, the River widening it self all the way to a great breadth. But the Channel is so choakt up with Sand for some Miles, that all Ships now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to a Place called the New Key, about 6 miles distance.</P>
<P>Over the River it has a fair Stone-bridge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilt upon 8 Arches, with a Gate at each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, from whence issue the Walls of the City <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a quadrangular form, high and strongly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilt. In this Wall are 4 Gates, viz. the East-Gate, Bridge-gate, Water-gate, and North-Gate; the first being esteemed one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he stateliest Gates in England. Besides these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our principal Gates, there are three others of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess note, called the Posterns, and on the Wall
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>are 7 Watch-towers, and broad Battlements for Pieces of Ordnance. On the South side, is a stately strong Castle, built in a circular form, with a Court-yard about it inclosed with a Wall. In the North Part is the Cathedral adjoyning to which is the Bishops Pallace.</P>
<P>In short, this City is beautify'd with divers fair Buildings, both publick and private; and graced with large and well-ordered Streets▪ which are supplied with fresh Water, by Con∣duit Pipes, from a Tower at the Bridge calle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Water-Tower, 35 yards high, and 8 broad Along the chief Streets are Galleries (or Row<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as they call them) with Shops on one side through which Galleries one may walk fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Wet in the greatest Showers.</P>
<P>As to the Number of Parishes in it, I fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no less than ten; so well frequented this Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is by Gentry and Tradesmen. For, besides th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Assises held here twice a Year, Chester being a County Palatine has also its Courts Pala∣tine kept here. And, as it stands commodi∣ously for Ireland, with which it has a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Intercourse, so it is a constant Thorough-far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for that Kingdom.</P>

<P>Amongst which, <HI>Nantwich</HI> and <HI>Fordsham</HI> are feated on the Banks of the <HI>Weever; Stopford,</HI> on the <HI>Mersey; Northwich</HI> and <HI>Congleton,</HI> on the <HI>Dane,</HI> which runs into the Weeve; <HI>Middlewich</HI> on the <HI>Croke,</HI> near its fall into the Dane; <HI>Max∣field,</HI> or <HI>Maclesfield,</HI> on the <HI>Bollin; Sandbich,</HI> on the <HI>Welock.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nantwich, Middlewich,</HI> and <HI>Northwich,</HI> are of chief note for their Salt-pits; but the first especially, which (next to Chester) is the greatest and the fairest built Town in the County. Here is the best white Salt made, and great plenty of it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Congleton,</HI> they make great store of Points, Purses, and leather Gloves. <HI>Sandbich</HI> is only famous for its Ale, sold at London for 12 pence the bottle; which, for strength and clearness, does equalize Canary. <HI>Maxfield,</HI> or <HI>Maclesfield,</HI> is a large and fair Town, which drives a great Trade of Buttons. But it is of most note for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honour∣able <HI>Charles Gerard,</HI> Earl of <HI>Maclesfield,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This County (formerly a Part of the an∣cient Kingdom of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Cornavii,</HI> as the Romans called them) is now in the Diocese of <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
<P>The Earls hereof were anciently accounted Palatines; since William the Conquerour gave this Earldom to <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> a noble Norman, <HI>to be holden as freely by his Sword, as the King himself held England by his Crown;</HI> which was the Tenure of all Counts Palatine, more like Princes than Subjects. And, though it be now, (and has long been) reannexed to the Crown; yet it still holds the Rights and Privi∣ledges of a County Palatine; having, for the administration thereof, a Chamberlain, a Ju∣stice for the Common-Pleas of the Crown, two Barons of the Exchequer, a Sheriff, an Es∣cheator, and other Officers, to the great ease of all the Country, in expedition of their Busi∣ness.</P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Members of Parliament, and <HI>Chester</HI> only has the Right of Election.</P>
<P><HI>CORNWAL,</HI> the furthest County in the West of England, is on all sides surround∣ed with the Sea; except Eastward, where the River <HI>Tamer</HI> parts it from Devon∣shire.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length</HI> from East to West is about 70. miles; and the <HI>broadest Part,</HI> next to Devon∣shire, 40. The Whole divided into nine <HI>Hun∣dreds,</HI> wherein 161 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 21 <HI>Market Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The Country being for the most part but narrow, you cannot expect here Rivers of any long Course. The <HI>Tamer</HI> aforesaid is the most considerable; next to which you have the <HI>Camel,</HI> and the <HI>Fale.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Air is pure and subtile, but much subject to Winds and stormy Weather; and more apt to preserve than to recover Health, espe∣cially to Strangers.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
<P>The Spring is something backward here, which makes the Harvest to be later than in the Eastern Parts; but, on the other side, the Win∣ter does prove milder.</P>
<P>The Country in general is hilly, and rocky, the Rocks being crusted over with a shallow Earth. The Parts towards the Sea are the most fruitful both in Corn and Pasturage. Which happens partly by the industrious ma∣nuring the Ground with a fruitful sort of Sand, and a Sea-weed called Orewood. The middle Parts, except the Inclosures about Towns and Villages, ly generally waste and open, and serve chiefly for Summer Cattel. But, as to Game, both for the Hawk and the Hound, here's great store of it.</P>
<P>One Thing it excels all other Counties in, and that is its Tin Mines, the Tin whereof goes beyond any in Europe for fineness.</P>
<P>Here is also found in some Rocks a sort of precious Stone, called the Cornish Diamond, shaped and polished by Nature; and some of them as big as a Walnut, but indeed not so hard as the right Diamond.</P>
<P>For Fishing of <HI>Pilchards,</HI> this is the Place; the Time, from July to November. When the Sea does so swarm of them, that enough can be spared to supply France, Spain, and Ita∣ly with them in great Stores; the smoaked one being called <HI>Fumados</HI> in Italy, where they pass for a great Dainty.</P>
<P>In Mounts Bay is the famous Hill, called <HI>S. Michael's Mount,</HI> severed from the main Land by a sandy Plain, which at Ebb-water may be passed over on foot. A Hill that proudly raises it self to a great eminence, the top of it be∣ing a small Plain, the greatest part on't taken up by an old Fort.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
<P>Nigh unto the said Bay is a strong Rock, called <HI>Main Amber,</HI> which lieth as it were mounted on others of a smaller size with so equal a Counterpoise, that it may be stirred, but not moved out of its place. And in S. Cleere's Parish there are upon a Plain 6 or 8 Stones, such as are upon Salisbury Plain. Which, like them too, will be mistaken in their telling; so that, when they are told over again, they will be found either more o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> less than before.</P>
<P>At <HI>Boskenna</HI> is a Trophy erected, 18 Stone placed round, and pitched 12 foot from each other, with another in the Center far bigge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than the rest. And in many Places hereabout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are Pieces of Armour, both for Horse and Man, digged out of the Ground.</P>
<P>Among Sea-faring Men, here are (beside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Harbours) two Places of chief note <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> viz. <HI>the Lizard Point,</HI> and the <HI>Lands End.</HI> The first is the furthest part South-West of the <HI>Goon hilly Downs,</HI> a pretty large Tract <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ground shooting forth from the main Land into the South Sea. The <HI>Lands End</HI> is the fur∣thest Point Westward of Cornwal, and conse∣quently of England.</P>
<P><HI>Lanceston,</HI> the County Town, bears from London West-South-West, and is distant there from 170 miles. Viz. from London to <HI>Salis∣bury,</HI> 70 miles, for the particulars of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> refer you to Wiltshire; from thence to <HI>Shaft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bury,</HI> 18; to <HI>Sherburn,</HI> 12 more; to <HI>Axminster</HI> 19; to <HI>Honiton,</HI> 7 more; thence to <HI>Exeter,</HI> 12. and to <HI>Lanceston,</HI> 32 more.</P>

<P><HI>Falmouth,</HI> the most-frequented Place in these Parts by Mariners, deserves a particular De∣scription. First it is called <HI>Falmouth,</HI> from its Situation at the Mouth of the River <HI>Fale;</HI> and that in a fertile Tract of Ground called <HI>Roseland,</HI> which contains several Parishes, and feeds great Flocks of Sheep.</P>
<P>The Haven before it is so safe and so capaci∣ous, that the Town has thriven of late very much upon it; the Creeks being coasted with steep Shores, and so large withal, that 100 Sail of Ships may safely ride at Anchor. Besides, it lieth more in the way of Trade to wind-driven Ships, than Plimouth in Devonshire. And over against it is the Castle called <HI>Pendennis,</HI> erected for the better security of this Coast by King Henry VIII.</P>
<P>But that which adds much of late to the Repu∣tation of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> is his Majesty's setling of a Sea-Post here for Spain and Portugal; whereby all immediate Correspondence with France is inter∣rupted, at least during this present War, and
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>the Benefit of it cut off from that Kingdom. The <HI>Groyn,</HI> a Sea-Port Town of Gallicia in Spain, is the Place appointed to receive our Packet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there; from thence to be distributed through all Places of Correspondence, both in Spain and Portugal. Lastly, this Town is of some note for giving the Title of Viscount to the Duke of <HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P>Further in the County Northward lies <HI>Truro</HI> a Town of good note, seated in the middle o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Streams that run into Falmouth Haven and giving the Title of Baron to the Right Ho∣nourable <HI>Charles Bodvile Roberts,</HI> Earl of <HI>Radnor, Penrin,</HI> another Town of note lies something nearer, but to the Northwest of Falmouth, on a Creek of Falmouth Haven. <HI>Penzance</HI> and <HI>Market-Jew</HI> stand over against one another, West and East of Mounts Bay, the first a good traded Town, the other but inconsiderable.</P>
<P>Eastward you will find <HI>Fouay, East</HI> and <HI>We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Iowe,</HI> upon the South Sea; and on the North or Irish Sea, the Havens of <HI>Padstow</HI> and <HI>S. Ives</HI> The rest of the Market Towns are up in the Country.</P>
<P>This County (which formerly was part of the ancient Kingdom of the West Saxons, and the Inhabitants, together with those of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> Known among the old Romans by the Name o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Danmonii</HI>) is now in the Diocese of Exeter.</P>

<P>West of Cornwal, about 24 miles distant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies a Cluster of small Islands, called by us the <HI>Isles</HI> of <HI>Scilly,</HI> by the Dutch <HI>Sorlings,</HI> and by the ancient Greeks <HI>Hesperides</HI> from their Western Situation, <HI>Cassiterides</HI> from the Tin-Mines they found amongst them.

<P><HI>Scilly,</HI> which communicates its Name to the rest, was formerly counted the chief of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slands. But now <HI>S.

<P>These Islands, after the Romans had forsaken their Holds in Britain, returned again into the power and possession of the Natives. From whom it was subdued, and added to this Crown, by <HI>Athelstane</HI> the eighth King of England, and since that time governed, as a part of Corn∣wal.</P>

<P><HI>CƲMBERLAND</HI> is a Maritime Coun∣ty in the North-West Parts of England. Bounded on the <HI>East</HI> by Northumberland and Westmorland; on the <HI>West,</HI> by the Irish Sea; on the <HI>North,</HI> by Scotland; on the <HI>South</HI> by Westmorland and Lancashire.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length</HI> from North to South is about 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, some thing less than 40.

<P>This Country is generally <HI>Mountainous,</HI> and some of the Hills both very high and stee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Those of most note are <HI>Skiddaw, Haraknot, Black coum,</HI> and <HI>Wry-nose.</HI> On the Top of this last on the high Way-side, are placed 3 stones, ca∣led the <HI>Shire-stones,</HI> standing within a foot o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> each other, one in this County, another i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Westmorland, and the third in Lancashire.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers</HI> and <HI>Meres,</HI> here is abundance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them; the principal River known by the Nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Eden.</HI></P>
<P>Here the <HI>Air</HI> is pretty sharp and piercing though the Country be something sheltered b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Northern Hills.</P>
<P>And, as hilly as this Country is, yet the Hil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>The Sea and Rivers, on the other side, strive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a manner to furnish it with plenty of Fish, and wild Fowl. And, which is remarkable, here they have Muscles that bear a sort of Pearl.</P>
<P>But, besides Rivers, here are a great ma∣ny <HI>Meers (or Lakes)</HI> yielding great plenty of Fish; but chiefly <HI>Ʋlles Water,</HI> bordering both upon Cumberland and Westmorland.</P>
<P>In the Bowels of the Earth, not only Coals for Fewel, but also Lead and Copper, are found in great plenty.</P>
<P>Of all the Counties in England, this shews the most Roman Antiquities. The principal of which is the <HI>Picts Wall,</HI> a prodigious Stone-wall built by the Romans for their security, against the Incursion of the raging Picts; the track whereof in many places is yet to be seen. This Wall was 8 foot broad, and 12 high, reaching cross the Country from Carlisle to Newcastle, that is, from Sea to Sea, at least 80 miles. Thus it ascended and descended over great Crags and high Hills, with Watch-Towers erected at every thousand Paces, in which Souldiers were kept for its Defence.</P>
<P>At Salkeld, on the Eden, is a <HI>Trophy</HI> of Victo∣ry erected, called by the Inhabitants <HI>Long Meg</HI> and her Daughters. This Monument consists of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7 Stones, each 10 foot above ground, and one of them (namely <HI>Long Meg</HI>) is 15 foot high.</P>

After him, Henry the First, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brother and Successor, made it a Bishops See. Thus by degrees it recovered it self, being now a fine City, well inhabited, and a Place of good Trade, chiefly for Fustians.

<P>Amongst which <HI>Perith,</HI> or <HI>Penrith,</HI> seated between <HI>Eimont</HI> a River on the South-side and <HI>Lowther</HI> another River on the West, is counted the second Town of note in this County; being large, well built, and in∣habited by Tradesmen, but Tanners especi∣ally.</P>
<P><HI>Cockermouth,</HI> a goodly Town, is so called from its Situation on the River <HI>Cocker,</HI> near its fall into the <HI>Derwent,</HI> by which two Rivers it is almost incompassed. It lies about 8 miles from the Sea, between two Hills, upon one of which stands the Church, and upon the other a Castle. Its chief Trade is of course broad Cloaths, here made. And here is a Custom, common to most other Market Towns of this County, to hire Servants at their Fairs; to which end such as want either Service or Servants do resort hither.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="45"/>
<P><HI>Egremont</HI> and <HI>Ravenglass,</HI> are seated not sar from the Sea. The first on the Banks of a River, over which it has two Bridges. <HI>Ravenglass,</HI> be∣twixt two Rivers, which together with the Sea incompass three Parts of it.</P>
<P><HI>White-Haven,</HI> is situate on a Creek of the Sea, at the North end of a Hill, where is a great Rock (or Quarrey) of hard white Stone, which gives name unto it. This Harbour is of late much improved in its Buildings, being well frequented and inhabited, and driving a good Trade to Ireland, Scotland, Chester, Bristol, and other Places. Whose chief Trade is of Salt, and Coals here plentifully digged up, for which they bring in exchange several good Commodities.</P>
<P><HI>Keswick,</HI> seated in a Valley hemmed in with Hills, has been a famous Town for Copper Mines, and much frequented by mineral Men, who had here many Smelting Houses. But now it is gone to decay. Not far from this Town is dug up <HI>Wadd,</HI> or Black Lead, in great plenty.</P>
<P>Formerly they reckoned in this County 25 <HI>Castles,</HI> few of which are remaining, most of them being decayed, and gone to ruin.</P>
<P>Lastly, this County (which in the time of the Heptarchy was part of the Kingdom of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and whose Inhabitants, as well as those of most part of the North besides, were called <HI>Brigantes</HI> by the ancient Romans) is part∣ly in the Diocese of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> and partly in That of <HI>Chester.</HI> For the South Part of it, called <HI>Copeland,</HI> lying betwixt the Rivers Duddon and Darwent, is within the Arch. Deaconry of Rich∣mond in <HI>Chester-Diocese;</HI> and all the rest of the County in the <HI>Diocese</HI> of <HI>Carlisle.</HI></P>
<P>Out of this County; besides the two Knights of the Shire, there are but four Members chosen
<PB N="51" REF="45"/>to sit in Parliament; 2 from <HI>Carlisle,</HI> and 2 from <HI>Cockermouth.</HI></P>
<P>In the North Parts of it, is a Tract called <HI>Gillesland,</HI> from whence the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> in∣titles himself Baron <HI>Dacre</HI> of <HI>Gillesland;</HI> and South-Westward, near the Sea, stands the Barony of <HI>Millum.</HI></P>
<P>In short, this County became first an Earl∣dom in the Reign of King Henry VIII, who bestowed the Title upon <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Clifford,</HI> Anno 1525, in whose Issue it continued till the Year 1642, the last that injoyed it being also a <HI>Henry Clifford.</HI> Of an Earldom it became a Duke∣dom in the Person of the late Illustrious Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> second Son of Frederick Prince Elector Palatine, and of Elizabeth his Wife, the only Daughter of King James the first; being Crea∣ted Duke of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Holder∣ness,</HI> by King Charles I. his Uncle, Anno 1643. He died without Issue at Whitehall, Nov. 29. 1682. And the Title of Duke of <HI>Cumberland</HI> is now in the Person of his Royal Highness, Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Man.</HI><LB/>Isle of Man</HEAD>
<P> The <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> lying most of it opposite to <HI>Cumberland,</HI> between this County and the North of Ireland, this I think therefore to be the most proper Place to take notice of it.</P>
<P>This Island runs in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, about 30 miles; and in <HI>Breadth,</HI> where it is broadest, 10 miles. The Whole divided into two Parts, <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South;</HI> the Inhabitants of the one having affinity with the Scotch, and the other with the Irish. And in these Parts, de∣fended by Two Castles, are reckoned 17 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and but 5 <HI>Market Towns.</HI></P>
<PB N="52" REF="46"/>
<P>It is generally an High-land on the Sea-Coast, and that well garded with Rocks. The middle part of it runs up into high Hills. The highest of all, called <HI>Seafull,</HI> has this very re∣markable in it, That from the Top of it, on a clear Day, one may easily behold three King∣doms at once, viz. <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland; England</HI> Eastward, <HI>Scotland</HI> Northward, and <HI>Ire∣land</HI> Westward.</P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> of this Island is sharp, and subject to high Winds; but 'tis healthful. And, as sharp as it is in Winter, yet the Frosts are short, and the Snow does not ly very long in the Val∣leys.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> is pretty fruitful, both in Corn and Pasture; affording good store of Wheat and o∣ther Grain, and feeding good Flocks of Sheep and Herds of Cattle, but none of the biggest size. Here are also red Deer, abundance of Conies, and Fowl of sundry sorts. In a little adjacent Island, called the <HI>Isle of Calf,</HI> is abun∣dance of Puffins, a sort of Sea Fowl that breeds in Cony-holes, chiefly used for their Feathers, and Oyl made of them. But their Flesh being pickled or salted, as it has a Fish-like taste, so it comes little short of Anchoves. And as for Fish, both the Sea and Rivers yield great plenty of it.</P>
<P>Its chief <HI>Places</HI> are <HI>Douglas, Laxi,</HI> and <HI>Ram∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> on the East Shore; <HI>Rushin,</HI> on the South, and <HI>Peel,</HI> with its strong Castle, on the West Shore.</P>
<P>'Twas about the Year 1340, that this Island was conquered from the Scots by <HI>William Mon∣tacute,</HI> Earl of Salisbury, who was thereupon honoured with the Title of King of Man. Af∣terwards it was sold to the Lord Scrope; who, being convicted of Treason, forfeited it to the
<PB N="53" REF="46"/>Crown. Henry IV. gave it to Henry Pierce Earl of Northumberland, the last that kept it with the Title of King. But, he proving also false to his Sovereign, the King gave it to William Lord Stanley; whose Grandchild <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord Stanley was created Earl of Derby. In whose House this Estate has continued hitherto, with the Title of Lord of Man, though a King in effect.</P>
<P>For he has here all kind of Civil Power and Jurisdiction over the Inhabitants, and the very Nomination of the Bishop of Man; but still under the Fief and Sovereignty of the Crown of England. And as to the Bishop, he must be presented to the King for his Royal Assent, then to the Archbishop of York for his Conse∣cration. Which is the Reason why the Bishop of Man is no Lord of Parliament, none being admitted to that Honour, but such as hold im∣mediately of the King himself.</P>

<P><HI>DERBYSHIRE,</HI> or (as some spell it) <HI>DARBYSHIRE,</HI> an Inland County, is bound∣ed on the <HI>East</HI> by Nottinghamshire; on the <HI>West,</HI> by Cheshire and Staffordshire; on the <HI>North,</HI> by Yorkshire; and on the <HI>South,</HI> by Lei∣cestershire. And it lies so in respect to the rest of <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> that the South Parts of this County are in a manner the Center of it.</P>
<P>It is in <HI>Length</HI> from North to South, about 34 miles; and in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, 16. The Whole divided into six <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 106 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 10 <HI>Market Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The Temperature of the <HI>Air</HI> of this County is very wholsom, as most of the Inland Coun∣ties are.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="47"/>
<P>Next to the River <HI>Trent,</HI> wherewith the South Parts of it are irrigated, that of chief note is <HI>Derwent,</HI> which crossing the Country from North to South, empties it self into the <HI>Trent,</HI> and so divides the County into East and West.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil,</HI> in the South and East Parts, is ve∣ry fruitful, and yields both good Grass and Corn. But the North and West Parts, being both Hilly and Stony, with a black and mossy barren Ground, are not so fertile. Yet they are not without some rich Valleys; and on the Hills themselves are bred abundance of very good (though not very large) Sheep.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fewel,</HI> it is not beholden to Wood, the Woods having been destroyed in a great mea∣sure by the Countries Iron-Works, Lead-mines, and Coal-Delfs. But 'tis so well stored with Coals, that it supplies with this sort of Fewel many neighbouring Counties, as Leicester, Nor∣thampton, Rutland, and Lincoln. Whose In∣habitants frequently bring Barley to sell at Darby, and load themselves back with Coals.</P>
<P>For <HI>Buildings,</HI> it affords, not only good Clay for Bricks, but also store of Free-Stone, or du∣rable Greet Stone; and in many parts Lime∣stone, both useful in Building, and for manu∣ring the Ground. Here is also Alabaster, Cry∣stal, black and grey Marble, not only very du∣rable, but such as polishes well.</P>
<P>As for Mill-Stones, and Whet-stones, here's whole <HI>Quarries</HI> of 'em; in the working where∣of a great many hands are imployed, before they come to be dispersed over the Nation.</P>
<P>But the chiefest Commodity of this Country is <HI>Lead,</HI> which for goodness or Plenty yields to no Place in the World. Famous for this is
<PB N="55" REF="47"/>the Peak of Derbyshire, as well as for its Quar∣ries; but particularly for its three wonderful Caves.</P>
<P>This <HI>Peak</HI> ly's amongst the Mountains, in the North-West Parts; and its three Caves, of a wonderful vast height, length, and depth, are known by the Names of <HI>Devils Arse, Elden∣hole,</HI> and <HI>Pools hole.</HI> From the <HI>Devils Arse</HI> a Water comes, which is said to ebb and flow 4 times in an hour, (as the Well in the Peak Fo∣rest) and to keep its just Tides. Noted besides for the strange Irregularities of the Rocks with∣in the Water.</P>
<P><HI>Eldenhole</HI> is very spacious, but wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a low and narrow entrance. The Waters which trickle down from the top thereof do congeal into Stone, and hang like Isicles in the root there∣of. Some are hollow within, and grow Ta∣per-wise, very white, and not unlike to Cry∣stal.</P>
<P>But the greatest Wonder of all is that of <HI>Buxton-Wells.</HI> Nine Springs arise out of a Rock in the compass of 8 or 9 Yards, eight of which are warm, and the ninth very cold. These Springs run from under a square Building of Free Stone, and about 300 foot off receive an∣other hot Spring from a Well inclosed with four flat Stones; near unto which another very cold Spring bubbles up. These Waters are experi∣mentally found good for the Stomach and Si∣news, and good to bathe in.</P>
<P>And now I come to Mineral Waters, I can∣not but mention <HI>Kedlaston Well, Quarndon</HI> and <HI>Stanly Springs.</HI> The first of which being in <HI>Ked∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ston Parish,</HI> is noted for having cured (as 'tis said) the Leprosy, and for being singular in the Cure of old Ulcers. <HI>Quarndon Springs</HI> are two Springs about a mile and a half from <HI>Derby,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="48"/>much of the nature of <HI>Tunbridge-Waters</HI> in Kent, and the <HI>Spaws</HI> in Yorkshire, as strong of the Mineral, and as effectual in the Operation. As for <HI>Stanly-Spring,</HI> 'tis of the same nature, but not so strong.</P>
<P>But about <HI>Wirksworth</HI> there's a warm and a cold Spring, so near each other, that one may put one hand in the cold, and the other in the warm.</P>
<P><HI>Derby,</HI> the Shire-Town, from whence the County it self is denominated, bears from Lon∣don North and by West, and is distant there∣from 98 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Leicester,</HI> 78, as you may see in Leicestershire; thence to <HI>Lougborough,</HI> 8; and to <HI>Derby</HI> 12 more.</P>
<P>This Town is seated upon the West Bank of <HI>Derwent</HI> (from whence probably the Name of <HI>Derby</HI> is extracted) over which there is a fine Bridge of free Stone, and upon the Bridge a Chap∣pel called St. Maries Chappel. But, besides <HI>Der∣went,</HI> which empties it self but 6 miles lower into the <HI>Trent,</HI> this Town has the Conveniency of a <HI>Brook</HI> rising Westward, and running through it under nine several Bridges.</P>
<P>'Tis a large, populous, and rich Place, few inland Towns equalizing it. Here are five Parish Churches, of which that of All-Saints is the fairest. Whose Tower-Steeple (in which are 8 tunable Bells) built at the only Charge of the young Men and Maids about the Reign of Q. Mary, is equalled for height and beauty by few in the Nation. Here is also a fair Hall, built not many years since of free Stone at the Coun∣ties Charge, where the Assizes are constantly kept.</P>
<P>In short, 'tis a Place of good Trade and Re∣sort, no less famous for good Ale than Banbu∣ry for its Cakes and Cheese. Here is chiefly a
<PB N="57" REF="48"/>great Vent for Barley, which they make into Malt, and so sell it again in Cheshire, Lan∣cashire, and the North of this County. Its Market is on Fridays, which is very great for Cattel, Corn, and all Provisions; besides small Markets on Wednesdays, and Saturdays.</P>
<P>Lastly, this Town is dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom, now in the person of the Right Honourable <HI>William Stanley,</HI> Earl of Derby, and Lord of the Isle of Man. Descen∣ded to him from his Ancestor <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Stanley,</HI> and of <HI>Man,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> by King Henry VII. Anno 1486. Which Title was first injoy'd by the Earls of Ferrers and Derby, and afterwards by several Princes of the Royal Family, till it came (as I said before) to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord Stanley, by Creation.</P>

<P>Amongst which <HI>Chesterfield</HI> is pleasantly seat∣ed in a good Soil, for the most part on the South-side of a little Hill, and that between two small Rivers. A Town which, by the Ruins of it, does seem to be of good Anti∣quity, and therefore likely to have had some more ancient Name, now buried in its Ruins. It was made a free Borough in the time of King John. And hard by it was the Battel fought between King Henry III and his Ba∣rons, in which <HI>Robert de Ferrers</HI> Earl of Derby being taken Prisoner lost his Estate and Dignity,
<PB N="58" REF="49"/>though not his Life. But that wherein it has most cause to glory is, that from an ordi∣nary Market Town, it is become the Seat of an Earldom, the Stile and Title of Earl of <HI>Chester∣field</HI> being conferred by King Charles I. upon <HI>Philip</HI> Lord <HI>Stanhop</HI> of <HI>Shelford,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> Anno 1628. From whom it descen∣ded next, by Henry his eldest Son, to the Right Honourable <HI>Philip</HI> Lord <HI>Stanhop,</HI> the pre∣sent Earl of <HI>Chesterfield.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wirksworth</HI> is so called from the Worth of the Lead-Works. And 'tis the greatest Lead-Market in England.</P>
<P>This County (formerly Part of the ancient Kingdom of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Coritani</HI>) is now in the Diocese of <HI>Lich∣field.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Parliament Men, and these two by <HI>Derby</HI> Town.</P>
<P>But, before I leave this County, I cannot but observe that, of all Parts of England (which in general is famous for its Stone-Bridges) <HI>Derbyshire</HI> is of special note upon that very ac∣count. Witness, amongst the rest, <HI>Burton-Bridge</HI> on the River Trent, in the Borders of Staffordshire, which has no less than 35 large Stone Arches. 'Twas at this Bridge that Edward II. put to flight Thomas Earl of Lancaster, and many of the Barons. Here is also <HI>Swarkeston Bridge,</HI> over the same Ri∣ver, reputed to be near a mile in length; but much of it is rather a Causey than a Bridge.

<HEAD>Devonshire</HEAD>
<P><HI>DEVONSHIRE,</HI> a Maritime County in the West of England, lies open to the Sea, both Northward and Southward; on the <HI>North</HI> being bounded with the North Sea, otherwise called the Severn Sea, or S. George's Channel, which parts it from Wales; and on the <HI>South,</HI> with the South Sea, commonly called the Chan∣nel, which parts England from France. But <HI>Eastward</HI> it is bounded by Somersetshire and Dorsetshire; and <HI>Westward,</HI> by Cornwal.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, a∣bout 52 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, 46. The whole divided into 33 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 32 <HI>Market Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> of this County is sharp and whole∣som. The <HI>Soil,</HI> in some Parts, generally beauti∣fied with fresh and pleasant Meadows, in other Parts shaded with great store of Woods, but in few places not so fit for Corn as most other Counties. 'Tis true, good Husbandry supplies that Defect, and adds unto it by cost and industry what it wants by Nature.</P>
<P>Amongst the many Rivers wherewith 'tis abundantly watered, the <HI>Tamer</HI> which parts it from Cornwal, the <HI>Turridge,</HI> the <HI>Taw, Ex,</HI> and <HI>Dart</HI> are the chiefest.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="50"/>
<P>In short, this County is well provided with Flesh, Fish, and Fowl. And as for Sea-Fish, Pilchards and Herrings chiefly are here fished in great abundance. Noted besides for its Wools and Clothings, the best and finest Ker∣seys in the Kingdom being here made; but chiefly, for its Tin and Lead-Mines.</P>
<P><HI>Exeter,</HI> the chief Place of it, ly's West-South-West from London, about 130 miles, thus. Viz. from London to <HI>Salisbury</HI> 70 miles, as you may see in the Description of Wiltshire. From Salisbury to <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> 15; and to <HI>Sherburn,</HI> 12 more; from Sherburn to <HI>Crookham,</HI> 10; thence to <HI>Axminster,</HI> 9; and to <HI>Exeter,</HI> 22 more.</P>
<P>This City is so called from the River <HI>Ex,</HI> on the East-banks whereof it is seated, and over which it has a fair Stone bridge, not above 12 or 15 miles from its fall into the Sea. 'Tis a large and well compacted City, and a Place of good Trade. But the River is so choaked up, that all Vessels are forced to load and unload their Goods at Topsham, about 3 miles di∣stance. Within its Walls and Suburbs are reckoned, besides the Cathedral, no less than 15 Parish-Churches. It has the Priviledge of two Markets weekly, kept on Wednesdays and Fridays.</P>
<P>Noted besides for giving the Title of Duke, Marquess, and Earl to several noble Personages. Of Duke, to <HI>John Holland,</HI> Earl of Huntington, made Duke of Exeter by King Richard II; and to <HI>Tho. Beaufort,</HI> Earl of Dorset, created Duke of Exeter by King Henry V. Next to whom this Title was injoy'd by <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Henry Holland,</HI> both of them Admi∣rals. Afterwards the Title of Marquess of <HI>Exeter</HI> was by King Henry VIII. conferred
<PB N="61" REF="50"/>upon <HI>Henry Courtney,</HI> Earl of Devonshire. Suc∣ceeded in it by his Son, <HI>Edward Courtney,</HI> with whom this Title died. But in the Reign of King James I, <HI>Tho.

<P>Among which <HI>Plimouth</HI> and <HI>Dartmouth</HI> are two noted Harbours in the Channel, but the first especially. Seated between the <HI>Tamer</HI> and the <HI>Plime,</HI> at both their falls into the Sea; the <HI>Plime</HI> being but a small River, from whence <HI>Plimouth</HI> however has took its Denomination. 'Tis one of the best Ports in England, having a safe and commodious Haven, strongly fortifi∣ed on both sides. A Place of great importance
<PB N="62" REF="51"/>to the Kingdom, not only for his Majesty's, but for Merchants Ships outward or home∣ward bound, to anchor in, upon any Casualty. The Conveniency whereof has so improved this Town, from a poor fishing Village, that it is now grown up to Stateliness. Lastly, this Place is dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom, now in the person of the Right Honourable <HI>Other Windsor,</HI> Earl of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> &amp;c. Derived to him from his Grandfather <HI>Thomas,</HI> Created Earl of <HI>Plimouth</HI> by King Charles II. But the first that injoy'd this Title was <HI>Charles Fitz Charles,</HI> commonly called <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> created Baron of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> Viscount <HI>Totnes,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> Anno 1675. who soon after died at Tangier.</P>
<P><HI>Dartmouth,</HI> so called from its Situation at the Mouth of the River <HI>Dart,</HI> is also a good Port Town, having a commodious Haven, well fre∣quented and traded unto. There's in it three Parish Churches. And it gives the Title of Baron to the Right Honourable <HI>George Leg,</HI> made Baron of <HI>Dartmouth</HI> by King Charles II.</P>
<P>Few miles from <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> to the North-East, is the Bay called <HI>Torbay,</HI> of chief note for the Descent here made by his present Ma∣jesty and his Land-Forces from Holland, upon the fifth of Nov. (being Gun-powder Treason Day) 1688.</P>
<P>From <HI>Torbay</HI> to the Coast of Dorsetshire, there is not a Sea-Town of any note, but <HI>Sid∣mouth.</HI> Which indeed was a good Port Town, as well as <HI>Seaton</HI> and <HI>Budley</HI> near adjoyning, be∣fore their Havens were choaked up with Sands. Now 'tis but a small Fisher-Town.</P>
<P>On the North Coast you will find <HI>Combe∣merton, Ilfarcomb,</HI> and <HI>Hartland,</HI> all of them but mean Towns.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="51"/>
<P>But, at some distance from that Sea, lies <HI>Barnstaple,</HI> a good trading Place, seated on the River <HI>Yaw,</HI> over which it has a large Bridge.</P>
<P>Further Westward you will find <HI>Bediford, Torrington,</HI> and <HI>Hatherley,</HI> all three on the <HI>Tow∣ridge.</HI> Over which River <HI>Bediford</HI> has a large Stone-bridge of arched Work, consisting of 24 Peers; and so high, that a Vessel of 50 or 60 Tuns may pass under it. Which Accommo∣dation has made it a Place of good account and trade. <HI>Torrington,</HI> a pretty large Town, is chiefly noted, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>Arthur Herbert,</HI> lately created Earl of <HI>Torrington,</HI> by our present King, and made Lord Admiral of Their Ma∣jesties Fleet. Whereas this Title was before in the Person of the Duke of Albemarle de∣ceased.</P>
<P><HI>Tavestock</HI> is seated on the Tave; <HI>Modberry,</HI> betwixt the Arme and the Aune; <HI>Totness,</HI> on the Dart, and <HI>Ashburton</HI> near it; <HI>Chidley,</HI> on the Tinge; <HI>Crediton,</HI> upon Credit and Forton, both which run into the <HI>Ex; Tiverton,</HI> at the fall of the Leman into the Ex; <HI>Columpton,</HI> on the <HI>Culme; Honiton,</HI> on the <HI>Otter; Axminster,</HI> on the <HI>Ax.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Totness,</HI> among the rest, is an ancient little Town, about 6 miles from the Influx of the Dart into the Sea. It stands on the fall of a Hill, lying East and West. Honoured once with the Title of an Earldom, in the person of <HI>George,</HI> Lord <HI>Carew</HI> of <HI>Clopton,</HI> Created Earl of <HI>Totness</HI> by King Charles I. Anno 1625. He was Son of <HI>George Carew,</HI> Dr. of Divinity, Arch-Deacon of <HI>Totness,</HI> and afterwards ad∣vanced to the Deanry of <HI>Windsor.</HI> But, dying without Issue male, the Title died with him.
<PB N="64" REF="52"/>In the Reign of King Charles II. this Town gave the Title of Viscount (as is said before) to <HI>Charles Fitz Charles,</HI> Earl of <HI>Plimouth</HI> but that Title also went with him into the Grave.</P>
<P><HI>Tiverton,</HI> (otherwise called <HI>Twiford-Town</HI>) is a Town of good account for the Cloths he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> made, which create a good Trade among th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inhabitants.</P>

'Tis very well inhabited, and drives a good Trade of Serges. There is a fair Churc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in it, built Cathedral-wise; this Town having been formerly the Bishops See, before it was by King Edward the Confessour trans∣ferred to <HI>Exeter.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, this County (which formerly wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Part of the Kingdom of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> and its Inhabitants, together with those of Corn∣wal, known by the name of <HI>Danmonii,</HI> among the ancient Romans) is now in the Diocese o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Exeter.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, no less than 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Members to sit in Parliament.

<P>To conclude, over against <HI>Devonshire,</HI> a good way off in the Severn Sea, is an Island called <HI>Lundey,</HI> not above 5 miles long, and 2 broad; but begirt about with dangerous unapproach∣able Rocks, having but one entrance into it, and that so narrow, that two men can hardly go a-breast.

<P>The North Parts, being somewhat flat, have the richest Meadows, and are not desti∣tute of Woods and Timber-trees; but in Win∣ter sadly clogged with Dirt. An Inconveni∣ency the South Parts are freer from, as consisting most of Hills or Downs, which being over∣spread with innumerable Flocks of Sheep, proves no small profit to the Inhabitants. And here are many (though not large) Valleys, in which most Towns and Gentlemens Houses are seated, the better to avoid those sharp Blasts this Southern Part is subject unto, lying so open and destitute of Woods as it does.</P>

And yet abroad all goes now under the Name of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> since they were both, by Act of Parliament, made but one Corporation; and the Occasion of it thus.

And, by their continual Suits, they still wearied the Lords of the Council and the Judges, till by an Act of Parliament in the Reign of Q.

<P>This Place is noted most of all for the late Duke of Monmouth's Landing here with his small Force from Holland in the late Reign, which brought him shortly after to his tragi∣cal End.

<P><HI>Bridport,</HI> East from <HI>Lime,</HI> was a Town of good account in Edward the Confessor's Time.

But now 'tis choakt up with Sands. The Town however is still a good Market-Town, and chiefly noted for Hemp. Inso∣much that once 'twas the only Place appointed for the twisting of Cordage and Ropes for the Navy of England, as well in respect of the adjoyning Soil yielding great store of excel∣lent Hemp, as for the skill of the People in twisting it.</P>

<P>This Town, from a mean Hamlet consisting of a few Fishermens-Houses in the Reign of Edward III, grew to be a Market Town of good Trade; and, by reason of its large and safe Harbour, increased so that Henry VI. granted it the Priviledge of a Haven, and licensed the Mayor to wall it in. Then be∣gan the Inhabitants to abound in Wealth; who, to free themselves from Subjection to

<P><HI>Blandford</HI> is a fair, large, and well compacted Town, well inhabited, and neighboured with Gentry. <HI>Wimborn-Minster,</HI> is seated in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertile Soil, and is pretty well frequented and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nhabited.

<HEAD>Of <HI>Portland</HI> and <HI>Purbeck.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I should now have done with <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> but that it were improper to leave it so, without taking notice of its two Peninsules, which generally go by the name of Islands. And those two are <HI>Portland,</HI> and <HI>Purbeck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Portland</HI> is that Tract of Ground which runs South from Weymouth some miles into the Sea. A Place of great strength, both by Na∣ture and Art; being surrounded with inaccessi∣ble Rocks, except at the very Place of Land∣ing, where stands a strong Castle called <HI>Port∣land Castle,</HI> built by Henry VIII. And, almost opposite to it on the Lands side towards Wey∣mouth, stands another called <HI>Sandford Castle.</HI> Which two Castles command all Ships that pass into this Road.</P>
<P>The whole Peninsule does shew it self from the top of the Rocks in a Flat, and is in com∣pass about 7 miles. The Ground is very good for Corn, and indifferent for Pasture but so destitute of Wood and other Fewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the Inhabitants are fain to dry their Cow-dung, and burn it. Which Defect i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made up another way, by its Quarries o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> excellent free Stone for Building; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in such plenty, that they make use of it fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Fences.</P>
<P>On the South-East-side stands the only Church in the Isle, and that so near the Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that, to fence it from its furious Waves, the Church-yard Banks were fain to be walled to
<PB N="73" REF="56"/>an incredible height. And here it is that <HI>Port∣land Race</HI> shews it self. For so they call the Meeting of the two Tides here, with so great stri∣ving and beating of the Waves, that 'tis not safe, even in the calmest Season, for Barks to pass over it.</P>
<P>This Peninsule has been dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom, first in the person of <HI>Richard Weston,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> by King Charles I. Anno 1632; and continued in his Son <HI>Jeremy,</HI> then in <HI>Charles</HI> Son and Heir of <HI>Jeremy,</HI> and lastly in <HI>Thomas Weston</HI> Uncle to <HI>Charles,</HI> the late Earl of Portland. But since the late Revolution, our present King was pleased to confer this Title upon the Right Honoura∣ble <HI>William Bentinck,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Port∣land,</HI> and Groom of the Stole to His Maje∣sty.</P>
<P>East of Portland lies <HI>Purbeck,</HI> an Island (or rather a Peninsule) that takes up the South-East part of this County, about 10 miles in length and 6 in breadth, reaching from Luck∣ford Lake to the Channel. So that it is sur∣rounded with the Sea North, East, and South; and Westward with Rivers, within less than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile. In this Compass of Ground are many small Towns, whereof <HI>Corfe</HI> is the chief. Seated on the banks of a River running through the middle parts of Purbeck into Luckford Lake; and that in a barren Soil, betwixt two Hills, upon one of which stands a Castle, called from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Town <HI>Corfe-Castle.</HI> A Castle that had great Priviledges granted to the Lords thereof; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the free Warren Chase over all the Isle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea-wracks, Freedom from the Lord Admiral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f England, &amp;c.</P>

<P>To conclude, this County (formerly Part of the Kingdom of the West-Saxons, and its Inhabitants the ancient <HI>Durotriges</HI>) is now in the Diocese of Bristol.</P>

<PB N="75" REF="57"/>So true it is, that those Northern Counties which are so nearly related to Scotland by their Situation, participate likewise of its nature.</P>
<P>This County is so well watered, what with the Sea, and what with the Rivers, that it is almost incompassed with Water. Next to the River <HI>Tine</HI> which parts it for some miles from Northumberland, and the <HI>Tees</HI> from Yorkshire, here is the <HI>Ware</HI> which runs through <HI>Durham,</HI> and <HI>Derwent</HI> into the Tine.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Soil</HI> of it is different, so it is in some Parts fertile, in others barren, and ac∣cordingly inhabited. The Eastern Part is Champain, and bears plenty of Coal; the South∣ern is the most fertile; the Western is hilly and barren, and thin of Woods and Towns. But it is recompensed by its Store of Coal, Lead, and Iron Mines.</P>
<P><HI>Durham,</HI> the County Town, bears from Lon∣don North by West, and is distant therefrom (by common Computation) 200 miles. That is 150 miles to <HI>York,</HI> for the Particulars of which I refer you to Yorkshire; and 50 miles more to <HI>Durham.</HI> Viz. from York to <HI>Borough∣bridge,</HI> 13; to <HI>North-Allerton,</HI> 13 more; 10 from thence to <HI>Darlington;</HI> and 14 more to <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>Whose Situation is upon Hills and Bottoms of Hills, all surrounded with Hills; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow Parts watered with the River <HI>Ware,</HI> which incircles the best Part of it, and over which there are two Stone-Bridges. If what Mr. <HI>Bloom</HI> says of it in his <HI>Britannia</HI> was true when it was published, the Case is altered. I have been often upon the Place, but could never find it fair and neatly compacted, nor so beautified as he represents it, nor its Market-Place
<PB N="76" REF="58"/>so spacious, nor its Trade so flourish∣ing. On the contrary, 'tis a good retiring Place, free from the noise and hurry of Trade; unless it be upon Saturdays, on which Day the Market is kept. Here indeed one may live plentifuly, and breath good Air, at an easy rate.</P>
<P>The greatest Ornament of this Place is the Castle, and the Cathedral. The Castle where the Bishop makes his Residence, is (I confess) a stately Fabrick, raised on the top of a Hill by William the Conquerour, with all the Ad∣vantages both of a Pallace and a Castle. Over against it, on the same Hill, stands the Ca∣thedral, whose Structure has this Defect, that it is built of a soft mouldering Stone. Between both these is a spacious Place, called the Green. On one side whereof is the Hall where the Assizes are kept, with a handsom publick Li∣brary erected and founded by Dr. <HI>Cosins,</HI> the late Bishop of Durham; and on the other side, a Row of Alms-Houses, the standing Fruits of his Charity.</P>
<P>At <HI>Nevils Cross,</HI> near Durham, a bloudy Battel was fought the 20th of Oct. 1346, be∣tween the English and the Scots; where <HI>David Bruce,</HI> King of Scots, was taken Prisoner by one Copland, a Man of a mean degree, but Knighted for this Action. Then was Queen Philip, Wife to King Edward III, in person in the Field; the Battel being managed by the Lords Mowbray, Percy, and Nevil.</P>

<P><HI>Darlington,</HI> is a good large Town, seated up∣on two Rivers, the <HI>Skerne,</HI> and a Rivulet that runs there into it. Over the first, which falls within 2 miles into the Tees, it has a fair Stone-Bridge.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, at Oxenhall, are 3 Pits called <HI>Hell-Kettles,</HI> of a wonderful depth, supposed to come of an Earthquake that hap∣ned in the Year 1179. 'Tis said of Bishop <HI>Tunstall</HI> of this Diocese, that he took a Goose which he markt, and put into one of the Pits; and the same Goose was found afterwards in the River <HI>Tees.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bernard Castle</HI> is seated in a Bottom, on the River Tees, and adjoyning to Marwood Park. 'Tis but an indifferent Town, and of chief note for Stockings here made.</P>
<P><HI>Bishop Aukland</HI> is pleasantly seated on the side of a Hill, between the Ware (over which it has a Bridge) and a Rivulet that runs into it. This is a neat Town, and noted for its good Air. But that which adds much to its Reputation is its stately <HI>Castle,</HI> the Bishops Summer Pallace, beautifully repaired by Dr. <HI>Cosins</HI> the late Bishop of Durham; and a fine <HI>Chappel,</HI> raised by the same Bishop from its Ruins.</P>
<P><HI>Sunderland</HI> is a Sea-Town, on the Mouth of the River Ware. Called <HI>Sunderland,</HI> because by the Working of the Sea it is in a manner pull∣ed from the rest of the Land, it being at high Water invironed on all sides with the Sea. This is a noted Place for its Sea-Coal Trade; but chiefly for giving the Title of Earl, first to <HI>Emanuel</HI> Lord <HI>Scrope</HI> of Bolton, and Lord President of the North, created Earl of <HI>Sun∣derland</HI> by King Charles I. Anno 1627. Upon whose Death, without lawful Issue, the Title
<PB N="78" REF="59"/>was bestowed by the same King upon <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Spencer</HI> of <HI>Wormleighton,</HI> in the Year 1643. Who, being slain the same Year at the first Newberry Fight, the Title fell to <HI>Robert,</HI> his Son and Heir, the present Earl of Sun∣derland.</P>
<P><HI>Stainthorp,</HI> or <HI>Staindrop,</HI> ly's but 5 miles East-North-East from Bernard Castle, among Parks, and on a Rivulet that runs from thence into the Tees. And not far from it is another Castle, called <HI>Raby-Castle,</HI> which King Ca∣nute gave to the Church of Durham, with the Lands about it.</P>
<P>But, besides the said Market-Towns, here is in the South-East Parts <HI>Stockton</HI> and <HI>Billingham,</HI> noted for their strong Ale; And further North∣ward <HI>Hartlepool,</HI> that stands upon a Neck of Land shooting forth into the Sea, which sur∣rounds it on all sides, except Westward.</P>
<P>On the Mouth of the River Tine you will find <HI>Sheals,</HI> where the New-Castle Coal-Fleet takes its Cargo. A little higher stands <HI>Jar∣row,</HI> noted for being the Birth place of the Venerable <HI>Beda.</HI> And, over against Newcastle, <HI>Gateshead</HI> or <HI>Gateside,</HI> the Receptacle of those numerous Men that work in the Coal-pits. Men that rake their mean Subsistence from the very Bowels of the Earth.</P>
<P>This County was formerly called <HI>St. Cuth∣berts Patrimony,</HI> from <HI>S. Cuthbert,</HI> the Raiser of Durham; whose Episcopal See was removed hither from <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> or Holy Island, on the Coast of Northumberland. A Saint for whom several of the Saxon Kings, and after them <HI>Ca∣nute</HI> the Dane, had so great a Veneration, that upon him, and his Successors in that See, was all the Country between Tees and Tine con∣ferred by <HI>Alfred</HI> King of England. Which his
<PB N="79" REF="59"/>Donation was confirmed, and in part increased, by his Successors <HI>Edward, Athelstan,</HI> and <HI>Canute</HI> the Dane. So fortified it was with Priviledges and Royal Grants, that, at the coming in of the Norman Conquerour, the Bishop was reputed for a Count Palatine, and did ingrave upon his Seal an armed Knight, holding a naked Sword in one hand, and in the other the Bishops Arms. Nay, it was once adjudged in Law, that the Bishop was to have all Forfeitures and Escheats within the Liber∣ties, as the King had without. In short, the Bishops hereof had the Royalty of Princes, having their own Courts of Judicature both for Civil and Criminal Causes, and covning their own Coin. But these exorbitant Privi∣ledges and Immunities were in part impaired by a Statute under Henry VIII, and altogether with the Lands and whole Rights thereof conferred upon the Crown by Act of Par∣liament in the last Year of the Reign of Ed∣ward VI.</P>
<P>To conclude, when England was divided into seven Kingdoms, this County was Part of that of Northumberland. And the Inha∣bitants of it, as well as those of most part of the North besides, were called <HI>Brigantes</HI> by the ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omans.</P>

<PB N="80" REF="60"/>
<P>This is a pretty large County, being in <HI>Length</HI> about 45 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> 36. The Whole divided into 20 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 45 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 21 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The same is abundantly irrigated, both with great and small Rivers.

<P>Here the <HI>Air</HI> is very Temperate; but down in the Hundreds towards the Sea-side it is very Aguish.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> for the most part is good, and in some Parts so fruitful, that (according to the Author of <HI>Englands Remarqnes</HI>) after 3 Years Glebe of Saffron, the Land for 18 years more will yield plenty of Barley, without any Ma∣nuring with Dung or the like, and then bear Saffron again. One Acre of this Ground (which is most in the North Part of the County) will yield 80 or 100 weight of moist Saffron in a Year, which being dried is valued 2. pound sterling.</P>
<P>Its chief Commodities, besides Saffron as aforesaid, are Cloths, Stuffs, Hops, and the best of Oysters.</P>
<P><HI>Colchester,</HI> the chief Place of it, bears from London North-East, and is distant from it, 43 miles, by common Computation. Viz. 10 from London to <HI>Rumford,</HI> 5 more to <HI>Burnt∣wood,</HI> 10 from thence to <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> and to <HI>Colchester</HI> 18 more.</P>

'Tis a fair and well-built Town, forti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed with an old Roman Wall, and having six Gates of entrance, besides 3 Posterns. Towards the East stands an old Castle, within the Ruins of a Trench containing about two Acres. In short, there were in it 14 Parish Churches, several of which are now re∣duced to ruin. But it is still a Place of good Trade for the Stuffs here made, and of some note for its excellent Oysters. In short, 'tis the richest, fairest, and best traded Town in the whole County, from whence the Earl <HI>Rivers</HI> takes his Title of Viscount.

<P>Among which <HI>Maldon</HI> and <HI>Harwich</HI> are two noted Harbours. The first, by the Romans called <HI>Camelodunum,</HI> a Town of great antiqui∣ty, and the Seat of <HI>Cunobelin</HI> King of the <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> about the Time of Christ's Birth. 'Tis seated on the River <HI>Chelmer,</HI> about 7 miles from the Sea, between which and the Sea ly two small Isles, called <HI>Northey</HI> and <HI>Osey.</HI> It has one Street about a mile in length, and is well inhabited. In short, 'tis one of the chief Places in the whole County; particularly noted for giving the Title of Viscount to the Earl of Essex.</P>
<P>In the Parts adjoyning to this Town are ex∣cellent Pastures, which feed store of Sheep, (amongst other Cattel) of whose milk they make Cheese. And on the utmost Promonto∣ry stood an ancient City of the Romans, called <HI>Ithancester,</HI> where the <HI>Fortenses</HI> with their Cap∣tain kept their Station or Gard, in the Dedi∣nation of the Roman Empire, for the Security of these Parts against the Saxon Rovers. No∣thing of which is now remaining, but the Ruins of a thick Wall, where many Roman Coyns have been found. And out of the Ruins of this City was built <HI>S. Peters upon the Wall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harwich</HI> lies the furthest East of any, by the Sea-side, and at the mouth of the River <HI>Stower.</HI> So that 3 Parts of it are surrounded with Water. The Town is not large, but well inhabited and frequented; not only for the commodiousness and safety of its Harbour, but because it is the readiest Passage for Holland, and the Station for the Packet-Boats imploy'd for that purpose. But there is a great Inconve∣niency to the Inhabitants, the Brackishness of its Waters. Which puts the Inhabitants upon the necessity of being supplied with sweet Wa∣ter from other Places.</P>

<P><HI>GLOCESTERSHIRE,</HI> a large Inland County, is bounded <HI>on the East</HI> by Warwickshire and Oxfordshire; <HI>on the West,</HI> by Monmouthshire and part of Hereford∣shire, <HI>Northward</HI> by Worcestershire; <HI>South∣ward,</HI> by Wiltshire and Somersetshire.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, 50 miles; and in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, about 25. The Whole divided into 30 <HI>Hundreds;</HI> wherein 280 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 26 Market Towns.</P>
<P>This is in general a most pleasant and fruitful Country, blessed with a full Course of the Ri∣ver <HI>Severn.</HI> That Part thereof which is beyond the River is overspread with Woods; all which, included in one Name, made the <HI>Forest</HI> of <HI>Dean.</HI> That part which buts upon Oxford∣shire is swelled up with Hills, called the <HI>Corswold Hills;</HI> but these are in a manner covered with Sheep, which yields a Wool of a notable fine∣ness. Whereof great Quantities of Cloth are here made, that find vent throughout all Eng∣land, and divers forein Countries. Between these two, I mean the Forest and the Hills, is seated a most fruitful Vale, yielding most sorts
<PB N="85" REF="62"/>of Grain to admiration, and formerly stock'd with Vines and Vineyards. The want of which is now supplied with Cider, which they make here in great abundance.</P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Severn,</HI> which crosses the Coun∣try from North to South, here's the <HI>Avon</HI> which parts it from Somersetshire, the <HI>Wye</HI> which severs it in part from Monmouthshire, besides the <HI>Stroud</HI> and the <HI>Isis.</HI> All which afford great plenty of Fish, and the <HI>Severn</HI> particularly abundance of Salmon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Forest</HI> of <HI>Dean,</HI> which ly's in the West∣side of the County between the Severn and the Wye, is reckoned to be 20 miles long, and 10 broad. A Place formerly much more woody than it is at present, the Iron Mines that are here having consumed a good part of the Wood.</P>
<P><HI>Glocester,</HI> the County Town, is 81 miles di∣stant West and by North from London. Viz. from London to <HI>Colebrook,</HI> 15; to <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> 7 more; and 11 from thence to <HI>Nettlebed;</HI> from Nette∣bed to <HI>Abington,</HI> 12; to <HI>Faringdon,</HI> 10 more; to <HI>Perrors Bridge,</HI> 14 more; and 12 from thence to <HI>Glocester.</HI></P>
<P>A City of good Antiquity, and first built by the Romans, to whom it was known by the Name of <HI>Glevum.</HI> It ly's stretch∣ed out in length on the Severn, over which it has a fine Bridge, and on the Banks thereof a large Key or Wharf, very commodious for the Merchandize and Trade of the Place. The Streets are generally fair, and the Town well built upon an easy Ascent, the Streets descending every way from the Cross. It has been for∣merly walled about with a strong Wall, except on the Rivers side; and some Remains of its Walls are still in many places to be seen, which shew what strength they were of.</P>
<PB N="86" REF="63"/>
<P>The City is not very large, but very well in∣habited and frequented, and enjoying a good Trade. It has two Markets a Week, <HI>viz. Wed∣nesdays</HI> and <HI>Saturdays,</HI> which are very great for Corn and Cattle, and well served with all Pro∣visions. And, for Divine Worship, here are twelve Parish-Churches; besides the Cathedral, a fine piece of Architecture, noted amongst o∣ther things for its <HI>Whispering Place,</HI> which is in an Arch of the Quire? but chiefly for be∣ing the Burying-place of <HI>Lucius,</HI> the first Chri∣stian King; and of the unfortunate King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> II. who at Barkley-Castle was barbarously murdered by the Cruelty of Isabel his Wife.</P>
<P>Lastly, this City is both a Bishops See, and a County of it self, being made a County by King Richard III, once Duke of Glocester. And, as it has the advantage of denominating so rich a Country as this, so it has been of∣ten dignified with the Title of a Dukedom, sometimes that of an Earldom, in those eminent Persons who in their several Times and Ages have been either Dukes or Earls of <HI>Glocester.</HI> The Number of 'em is too great for me to produce 'em all here. Therefore I shall only say, that the last Duke of <HI>Glocester</HI> was <HI>Henry,</HI> the third Son of King Charles I, declared by his Royal Father Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and so Intituled Anno 1641, but not so created till the Year 1659. He lived to see the Restauration of the Royal Family, and died the same Year it hapned, viz. Sept. 13. 1660. With him the Title has lain dormant, till it was lately revived in the person of the young Prince <HI>William,</HI> the Son of the Illustrious Prince George of Denmark.</P>
<PB N="87" REF="63"/>
<P>Nigh to this City is <HI>Alney-Isle,</HI> so made by the Severn. In which Edmund Ironside King of the English Saxons, and Canute the Dane, after many Conflicts and bloody Battels, fought a single Combat hand to hand, for the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> The Issue of which was, that they agreed to part the Kingdom; which they joyntly governed, till Treason took away the Life of King Edmund, and left Canute sole Monarch of England.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lassington,</HI> a mile from <HI>Glocester,</HI> is found a sort of Stone, called the <HI>Star-Stone,</HI> being a∣bout the breadth of a Silver Peny, and the thickness of a Half-crown. These Stones are flat, and (like a Star) five-pointed; of a gray∣ish colour, and on the flat sides naturally in∣graven in fine Works, as one Mullet within another.</P>

<P>Amongst which <HI>Bristol,</HI> being not only the greatest Place of Trade in <HI>England</HI> next to
<PB N="88" REF="64"/>London, but also a Bishops See, and a County of it self, deserves a particular Description. It is both pleasantly and commodiously seat∣ed at the fall of the <HI>Frome</HI> into the <HI>Avon,</HI> which five Miles from thence empties it self into the Severn. By this River the City is divided in∣to two Parts, the chief Part in Glocester∣shire, and the other in Somersetshire, but with the conveniency of Communication by means of a fair Stone Bridge. Which (like London Bridge) is so covered with Houses, that it looks more like a Street than a Bridge. Its Streets are neatly ordered, and set out with many fine Edifices. Among which may be reckoned the Cathedral, and most of the Parish Churches, which are 18 in Number. The City is be∣girt with a Wall, besides other Fortifi∣cations. At the East end of it stood a Castle, wherein King Stephen was kept a Prisoner by Maud the Empress. But it was demolish∣ed by Oliver Cromwel, and is now built in∣to Streets, called Castle-street and Castle-Green.</P>
<P>But that which has chiefly made <HI>Bristol</HI> so considerable is the goodness of its Port. The principal Key whereof stands on the <HI>Frome,</HI> which at Spring-Tides does flow about 40 Foot, and so brings Ships in of a great Burden. Thus <HI>Bristol,</HI> by its Commodious∣ness for Shipping, is become a Place of great Resort both for Merchants and Tradesmen; those driving a great Trade to most Parts of the Known World, these a Home-Trade, es∣pecially to Wales, to Shropshire, and other Counties.</P>
<P>About <HI>Bristol</HI> is great store of Coals; also, a sort of Precious Stone, called from thence <HI>Bristol-Stones,</HI> taken out of S. Vincents Rock.
<PB N="89" REF="64"/>At the bottom whereof is a <HI>hot Well,</HI> of a Me∣dicinal nature.</P>
<P>Lastly, though <HI>Bristol</HI> stands partly (as I said before) in this County, and partly in Somer∣setshire; yet, as it is a County of it self, it yields Obedience to neither. And considering its Beauty, Trade, Riches, Extent, and Po∣pulousness, it may be counted the chief Place in England, next to London.</P>
<P>'Tis but about 150 Years since this Town came to he a Bishops See, this being one of the six new Sees erected by Henry VIII. by virtue of an Act of Parliament made in order to it. But it is less since it became a Title of Nobility, which was not till King James I. conferred the Honour of Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> upon <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Digby</HI> of <HI>Sherburn,</HI> Anno 1622. From him devolved by his Death to his Son <HI>George,</HI> in the Year 1650, and from him to the Right Hononrable <HI>John Digby,</HI> the present Earl of Bristol.</P>
<P><HI>Cirencester,</HI> commonly pronounced <HI>Circester,</HI> is seated on the River <HI>Churn,</HI> over which it has a Bridge. It has been a Place of great ac∣count in the time of the <HI>Romans;</HI> and, with∣out insisting upon the Roman Coyns, Checker-work Pavements, and engraven Marble Stones, that have oft been digged up here, its very ruinous Walls, still to be seen, and about 2 Miles in Circuit, are a sufficient proof of its former Greatness. This City was taken from the Britains by the West-Saxons, and afterwards possessed by the Mercians, till laid in Ashes by a Stratagem of the merciless Danes, in tying fire to the Wings of Sparrows, from whence it came to be called the <HI>Sparrows City.</HI> Since which Desolation, it could never recover it self to any thing beyond the Name of a good Borough Town.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="65"/>
<P><HI>Tewksbury</HI> is a goodly Town, situate at the fall of the North-Avon into the Severn, and water∣ed besides with two Rivulets. A Town of good account for making of Woollen Cloth, and for the best Mustard in the Kingdom, as <HI>Dijon</HI> is in France. But most of all memorable for the Battel fought here Anno 1471. between King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and his immediate Successor Edward IV, that is, between the House of Lancaster and York, where the Lancastrians were intire∣ly defeated, and the young Prince Edward (the only Son of King Henry) slain.</P>
<P><HI>Stroud,</HI> situate on the River so called, is a well-built Town, whose Houses for the most part are of Stone. It has a Bridge over the River, on the Banks of which are placed abundance of fulling Mills. Here they die Scarlet, the Stroud Water having a peculiar quality to give the right Tincture.</P>
<P>Near the Severn Banks stands <HI>Berkley Castle,</HI> which gives Name to a noble and ancient Family dispersed in many Places of this King∣dom, and whereof they were made Barons by King Henry the II. Whereas before that time they were called <HI>Fitz-Harding,</HI> as being descen∣ded from one Robert <HI>Fitz-Harding,</HI> of the Blood-Royal of the Danes. William Lord Berkley of this House descended from the Mowbraies (who, amongst other Titles, were Earls of Nottingham) was in the Year 1432 created Viscount Berkley by King Richard III; after∣wards Earl of Nottingham, and Earl Marshal, by King Henry VIII; and finally Marquess Berkley, by the same King Anno 1509. But dying without Issue, all those Titles ended with him. Only the Title of Lord Berkley continued in the Collateral Line, till advanced to the Title of Earl by King Charles II.
<PB N="91" REF="65"/>Anno 1679. in the person of the Right Ho∣nourable <HI>George,</HI> Earl of <HI>Berkley,</HI> Viscount <HI>Dursley,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To conclude, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and its Inhabitants, with those of Oxfordshire, known among the ancient Romans by the Name of <HI>Dobuni</HI>) is now partly in the Diocese of <HI>Glo∣cester,</HI> and partly in that of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>Ont of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, six Members of Parlia∣ment; Viz. 2 out of <HI>Glocester,</HI> 2 out of <HI>Tewksbury,</HI> and 2 more out of <HI>Cirencester.</HI> In this Case <HI>Bristol</HI> is counted in Somerset∣shire.</P>

<HEAD>Hampshire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HAMPSHIRE,</HI> or <HI>HANTSHIRE,</HI> otherwise called the County of <HI>Southampton,</HI> from <HI>Southampton</HI> the Shire-Town, is a Maritime County. Bounded on the <HI>East</HI> by Surrey and Sussex; on the <HI>West,</HI> by Wiltshire and Dorsetshire; on the <HI>North,</HI> by Barkshire; and on the <HI>South,</HI> by the Channel, or British Sea.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, is about 46 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, 30. The Whole divided into 39 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 253 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 16 Market-Towns.</P>
<P>This County is rich in all Commodities, both of Sea and Land; and those Parts of it which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y furthest from the Sea, of a pure and excellent Air.</P>
<P>In particular, the Country is well cloathed with Wood, affords plenty of Iron, which is here wrought from the Mines, with abundance of Wool, which the Inhabitants make Cloths and Kerseys of, and the best sort of Hony.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="66"/>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> here is in the West Parts of the County, the <HI>Avon,</HI> and the <HI>Stower</HI> a Dor∣setshire River, which meet together at their fall into the Sea. More Eastward you will find the <HI>Test,</HI> and the <HI>Itching,</HI> which also meet at their fall into the Sea, and that near South∣ampton.</P>
<P>In this County is the <HI>New Forest,</HI> about 30 miles in compass. A Forest which <HI>William the Conquerour</HI> so delighted to hunt in, that (to make it compleat and intire) he caused ma∣ny Towns and Villages, with no less than 36 Parish-Churches, to be pulled down and le∣velled with the ground. But this Exorbitance of his did not escape unpunished. For in this very Forest <HI>Richard,</HI> his second Son, was goared by a Deer, and died; <HI>William,</HI> his third Son, was accidentally slain by Sir Walter Tyrrel; and his Grandchild, <HI>Robert Curtoyse,</HI> being in pursuit of the Game, was struck by a Bough in∣to the Jaws, and died.</P>
<P><HI>Southampton,</HI> the Shire-Town, bears from London South-West by West, and is distant therefrom 60 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Stanes,</HI> 15; to <HI>Bagshot,</HI> 10 more; thence to <HI>Alton,</HI> 14; to <HI>Alesford,</HI> 8 more; from Ales∣ford to <HI>Twiford,</HI> 7; and to <HI>Southampton,</HI> 6 more.</P>
<P>This Town is commodiously seated at the very Mouth of the Rivers Test and Itching both which Streams being here united together into one go under the Name of <HI>Hampton,</HI> which is more like an Arm of the Sea than a River. And 'tis capable of Ships of good Burden to the very Key, which is very com∣modious for lading and unlading of Ships. Ac∣cordingly this Town has flourished for some time, and injoy'd a great Trade with France
<PB N="93" REF="66"/>especially; being conveniently seated, oppo∣site to Normandy, and its adjacent Isles, Jer∣sey and Garnsey. It has been likewise a Place of good Defence, surrounded with a double Ditch, and strong Walls, with several good Towers, and fortified besides with a Castle. At present both its Trade and Strength are very much decay'd and diminished. How∣ever it is still of that extent as to contain five Parish Churches. And, though it be within the County, yet it is (as some other Towns) a County of it self, for which it stands beholding to King Henry VI.</P>
<P>The Bishops of Winchester were anciently reputed to be Earls of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and are so stiled in the new Statutes of the Garter made by Henry VIII. But that Title has been since otherwise disposed of; <HI>Thomas Wriothesley,</HI> Lord Chancellour, being created Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> by King Edward VI. Anno 1547. In whose Line it has continued, till it died with <HI>Thomas Wriothesley,</HI> Lord Treasurer, Anno 1667. In the Reign of Charles II. After whom <HI>Charles Fitz-Roy,</HI> Lord <HI>Limrick,</HI> eldest Son to the Dutchess of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> was created Baron of <HI>Newberry,</HI> Earl of <HI>Chichester,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Southampton,</HI> Anno 1675.</P>
<P>For Provisions, and other Commodities, this Town has two Markets a Week, viz. Tuesdays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Fridays.</P>
<P>But, though <HI>Southampton</HI> be properly the Shire Town, yet the City of <HI>Winchester</HI> out∣loes it upon several accounts, and there∣sore deserves a particular Description by it self.</P>
<P><HI>Winchester,</HI> the <HI>Venta Belgarum</HI> of the ancient Romans, is pleasantly seated in a Valley be∣twixt Hills, and on the Banks of the River
<PB N="94" REF="67"/>Itching. A City of great Antiquity, and noted among the Romans for being the Place where the rich Imbroideries were made for their Emperours. In the time of the Saxons it was twice consumed by fire, and by them rebuilt; being made the Royal Seat of the West-Saxon Kings, and the chief Episcopal See. Afterwards it felt, with many other Places, the fury of the Danes. In the time of the Normans it was repaired, and honoured with the keeping of the publick Records of the Kingdom. But soon after it had a Relapse, be∣ing sore oppressed during the Civil Wars of Maud the Empress and King Stephen. At last it began in the Reign of Edward III. to reco∣ver it self, having made it the Mart for Wool and Cloth.</P>
<P>At present this City contains, within its Walls, about a mile and a half in Circuit, but not without some waste. Here is a fine Hall, where the Assizes and Sessions are kept for the Coun∣ty; and in this Hall hangs up <HI>King Arthur's Round Table,</HI> which is kept as a Monument.</P>
<P>For Divine Worship, here are five Parish Churches. Besides the Cathedral, a large and beautiful Structure, dedicated to the Holy Tri∣nity; and of special note, for being the Se∣pulchre of many Saxon Kings and Queens, besides two Kings of the Danish, and two of the Norman Race. For the Education of Youth, here is in the Suburbs a fair Colledge, liberally endowed, and a place of good Lite∣rature; built and endowed by <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham</HI> for a Seminary to his other Colledge in Oxford. And for the Relief of the Poor, a very fair Hospital, called S. <HI>Crosles,</HI> not far off from the Colledge. Here is also a goodly and capacious Palace for the Bishops Dwel∣ling,
<PB N="95" REF="67"/>called <HI>Wolvesey-House;</HI> and, upon a Hill, a strong Castle, which overlooks the Country.</P>
<P>In short, the City of Winchester is indiffe∣rently well peopled, and frequented. And its reekly Markets, kept on Wednesdays and Satur∣days, are well served with all sorts of Provisi∣ons, especially that on Saturdays. Noted be∣sides, for giving the Title of Marquess to his Grace <HI>Charles Paulet,</HI> lately made Duke of <HI>Bol∣ton</HI> by our present King.</P>

<P>Amongst which <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> the strongest Place in this Kingdom, is seated in the Isle of <HI>Porsey,</HI> South-East from Southampton; Which Isle has Communication on the North with the main Land, by a Bridge. This Place is both a good Harbour for Ships, and by its strong Fortifications a Shelter to this Country. Here are Docks and Store-houses for the King to build and equip Men of War; and for its Defence, two Castles, one in the North, and another in the South, besides other Fortifications, and a good Garrison withall. But it is counted an unhealthy Place.</P>
<PB N="96" REF="68"/>
<P>However, it gives the Title of Dutchess to a famous French Lady, <HI>Louisa de Querouaille,</HI> creat∣ed Baroness of <HI>Petersfield,</HI> Countess of <HI>Faru∣ham,</HI> and Dutchess of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Anno 1673. A Town noted besides for a Race of small Dogs like Beagles, bred about it; which hunt Moles, as their natural Game.</P>
<P><HI>Odiam,</HI> seated on the Road, did formerly be∣long to the Bishops of Winchester. Near un∣to it stand the Ruins of an old Castle, once so strong, that in the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> 13 Englishmen kept out the Dauphin of France and his Army for the space of 15 days.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Whitechurch, Stocksbridge,</HI> and <HI>Rumsey,</HI> they are all three seated upon the <HI>Test; Ring∣wood,</HI> upon the <HI>Avon; Christ-Church,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Avon</HI> and the <HI>Stower,</HI> at their fall into the Sea; and <HI>Lemington,</HI> East from it, by the Sea∣side. <HI>Stockbridge, Basingstoke, Petersfield,</HI> and <HI>Ando∣ver,</HI> are great Thorow-fare Towns.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Wight.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Wight</HI> falls next under our Con∣sideration. And as Nature has parted it from the rest, so in her Imitation, I give you here a separate Account of it.</P>
<P>This Island, being scarce 3 miles from <HI>Hurst-Castle,</HI> is generally supposed to have been dismembred from Hampshire by the Sea. 'Tis about 20 miles in length, and 12 broad where broadest; of an oval Form, ending with two Peninsules, one East, and the other West. Naturally fenced
<PB N="97" REF="68"/>about with steep and craggy Rocks, amongst which the <HI>Shingles</HI> and the <HI>Needles</HI> North∣westward are of chief note amongst Sea-men. Southward, where it looks towards France, it is inaccessible; but, towards the North-East, something flat and level.</P>
<P>The Soil hereof abundantly answers the Pains of the Husband man. So plentiful it is of Corn and Pasturage, that the Inhabitants have not only sufficient for themselves, but fur∣nish also the Markets of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> and <HI>Sou∣thampton,</HI> (but the first especially,) with the greatest part of the Wheat, Flesh, Cheese, and Butter, which is spent amongst them. Insomuch that the Souldiers of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> pre∣suming on the strength of that Town, use to say, That as long as they have the Isle of Wight to their Friend, and the Seas open, they need not care for all the World besides. And, as the Sea about this Island is exceeding full of Fish, so is the Land stored almost in all Places with Conies, Hares, Partridges, and Pheasants. And the Sheep here yield so fine a Fleece, that the Wool hereof has the preceden∣ty of that of Coteswold in Glocestershire, and is next in esteem to that of Lemster in He∣refordshire.</P>
<P>This Island is divided into two principal Parts, <HI>viz. East,</HI> and <HI>West-Meden;</HI> containing 36 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and in them 3 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Newport,</HI> the chief of all the Isle, stands on the North-East Coast, with a little Creek be∣fore it, where small Vessels come to the very Key, which does very much facilitate its Trade. 'Tis a large and populous Town, having two Markets a Week, <HI>viz.</HI> Wednesdays and Satur∣days.</P>
<P>At the entrance of the aforesaid Creek is
<PB N="98" REF="69"/><HI>Cowes,</HI> often mentioned in our <HI>Gazets,</HI> a noted place for harbouring of Ships, therefore fortified with a Castle. And a little way West from Newport, stands another, call'd <HI>Cares∣brook Castle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yarmouth,</HI> the best Town in this Island, next to Newport, is situate on the North-West Coast. This Town is strengthened with a Castle, and other pieces of Fortification; most of it's Houses built of Free Stone, and covered with Slate.</P>
<P>In the South-East-Parts is <HI>Sandham,</HI> on a Bay so called, also fortified with a Castle. So that here are more Castles in this Spot of Ground, than there is in any the like Spot in England.</P>
<P>Lastly, this Island, as well as the Isle of Man, has had the honour of being advanced to the Title of a Kingdom; but either of 'em much more deservedly than the Lordship of <HI>Ivitot</HI> in France. 'Twas in the Year 1445, when King Henry VI, out of his particular affection to <HI>Henry Beauchamp,</HI> Earl of Warwick, crowned him King of Wight. Which Title ended with his Life about two years after.</P>
<P>Besides this Island, there are to the Eastward of Portsmouth, two lesser Isles, called <HI>Haling</HI> and <HI>Thorney;</HI> and having two Towns of their Name.</P>
<P>This County, whereof the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Wight</HI> makes a Part, is in the Diocess of Winchester, and was formerly part of the Kingdom of the West Saxons. The Inhabitants whereof, together with those of Wiltshire and Somersetshire, were known by the Name of <HI>Belgae</HI> among the anci∣ent Romans.</P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>A Country not only blest with a sweet and wholsom <HI>Air,</HI> but also with a fruitful <HI>Soil;</HI> well watered with fresh and delightful <HI>Streams,</HI> the principal whereof are the <HI>Lea</HI> and the <HI>Coln.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hartford,</HI> the Shire-Town, from whence the County took its Name, stands North by West 20 miles from London, Viz. 10 from London to <HI>Barnet,</HI> and 10 more to <HI>Hartford.</HI></P>
<P>A Town of great note, in the time of <HI>Beda,</HI> (by whom named <HI>Herudford,</HI>) for a Synod there held in the dawning of the day of Christianity, amongst the Saxons; in which S. Augustine the Monk, the first Apostle of that People, had a Conference (or Consultation) with the British Bishops. More memorable, in the following Times, for giving the Title of an Earl to the Illustrious Family, surnamed <HI>De Clare;</HI> the ad∣dition of an Honour, and a goodly Patrimony to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster;</HI> and at this time the Title of Marquess to the Duke of <HI>Somerset.</HI></P>

<P>This Town is seated on the <HI>Lea,</HI> much decay'd by the turning the High-way through Ware, and having now but 3 Parish Churches. Here however, is kept the County Goal, and 'tis a well frequented Market on Saturdays.</P>

<P>Amongst which <HI>S. Alhans,</HI> seated on the Ri∣ver <HI>Coln,</HI> was so called from a famous Monastery here, founded by <HI>Offa,</HI> the great King of the Mercians, in honour of <HI>St. Albans</HI> the Proto∣martyr of Britain, a Citizen of <HI>Verulamium</HI> near adjoyning to it. Out of the Ruins whereof (decay'd by Age, and destroy'd by War) arose the present <HI>S. Albans,</HI> the fairest and best trad∣ed Town in this County. A Town which for∣merly injoy'd great Priviledges. For Divine Worship it has now 3 Parish Churches; and in one of 'em ly interred the Bodies of many Nobles, slain in two Battels fought here be∣tween the Houses of York and Lancaster.</P>
<P>This Town has been dignifyed with the se∣veral Titles of Viscount, Earl, and Duke. With the first, Anno 1620, in the Person of <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> Viscount S. Albans, Lord Verulam, and Lord High Chancellour of England. With the Title of Earl, Anno 1628. in the person of <HI>Richard de Burgh,</HI> and continued in his Son Ulick,
<PB N="101" REF="70"/>with whom it dyed; till revived again, Anno 1660. by King Charles II. in the person of <HI>Hen∣ry Jermin,</HI> the last Earl of St. Albans. Who dying without Issue, King Charles advanced his Grace <HI>Charles Beauclare,</HI> Earl of Burford, to the Title of Duke, by making him Duke of <HI>S. Al∣bans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ware, Hatfield,</HI> and <HI>Hodsdon,</HI> are all three seat∣ed on the Lea. The first a good Thorough-fare Town, much improved since the High-Way was turned from Hartford hither. Noted be∣sides for the Channel cut from thence to Lon∣don where it serves so many hundred Fa∣milies with the Conveniency of that ex∣cellent Water, called New River Water. To which may be added another Observa∣tion, the pleasantness and easiness of the Road from Ware up to London; which being of a Sandy Soil, proves seldom dirty but with∣in a mile of London, and is so filled with Towns and Gentlemens Houses from mile to mile, that one would think the Suburbs of London on the North side fetch their beginning at Ware. So strange is the Influence of this rich and popu∣lous City.</P>
<P><HI>Hatfield</HI> is a Place of great Delight and Re∣creation; but of chief note for that stately House called <HI>Hatfield House,</HI> formerly one of the Kings of Englands Pallaces, till it came in the possession of the Earls of Salisbury. A House which for Situation, Prospect, Contri∣vance, and Building, for Air, water, and all other Accommodations, is inferiour to none in England.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Hodsdon,</HI> but nearer to Wal∣tham Abby in Essex, is <HI>Theoballs,</HI> one of the Kings Royal Seats, pleasantly situate among delightful Walks, Gardens, Groves, and Springs.
<PB N="102" REF="71"/>First built by Sir William Cecil, and afterwards beautifyed by his Son Robert, both Lord Trea∣surers of England.</P>
<P><HI>Barnet,</HI> or <HI>high Barnet,</HI> is pleasantly seated on a Hill, and in the Road within ten miles of London. Of some account for its Medicinal Waters; but much more memorable for a bloody Battel fought here between the two Houses of York and Lancaster, wherein the former prevailed.</P>
<P><HI>Warford</HI> and <HI>Rickmansworth</HI> are both seated near the Coln. And, not far from the first, <HI>Langley Abbey,</HI> the Birth-place of that proud and high-spirited Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> IV. first known by Nicholas, and surnamed Break-Spear.</P>
<P><HI>Bishops-Stratford</HI> is a great Market Town, seat∣ed near the River <HI>Stowr,</HI> on the side of a Hill, and much resorted unto. On the East-side whereof are to be seen the Ruins of a Castle, called the <HI>Castle of Waymour,</HI> standing very steep in an Isle upon an artificial Mount, with a dark and deep Dungeon in it, which denotes some great Priviledges to have belonged unto it in former Times. It was ruinated by King <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Market-Towns here, I might have put in <HI>Royston,</HI> part of which stands in this County; but I refer you for it to <HI>Cam∣bridgeshire.</HI></P>
<P>In short, this County (which formerly was di∣vided betwixt the Kings of Mercia and the East-Saxons, and whose Inhabitants were part of the <HI>Catieuchlani,</HI> as the Romans called them,) stands now divided betwixt the Dioceses of London and Lincoln.</P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but four Members to serve in Parliament; 2 by <HI>Hartford,</HI> and 2 by <HI>St. Albans.</HI></P>

<P><HI>HEREFORDSHIRE,</HI> or the County of <HI>Hereford,</HI> is an Inland County. Which has for its Eounds <HI>Eastward,</HI> Glocestershire and Worcestershire; <HI>Westward,</HI> Radnockshire and Brecknockshire in Wales; <HI>Northward,</HI> Shropshire; and <HI>Southward,</HI> Monmouthshire.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, is about 35 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West 30. The Whole divided into 11 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> where∣in 176 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and but 8 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>This County was formerly part of Wales, before it was by Conquest annexed to this Crown. And then it was strengthened with no less than 28 Castles, whereof there's scarce any thing now remaining but their Ru∣ins.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Air</HI> is temperate and healthful; and the <HI>Soil</HI> exceeding rich. Tis well cloathed with Wood, and refreshed with Rivers; the principal of which are the <HI>Wye, Lug, Arrow,</HI> and <HI>Frome.</HI></P>
<P>Two Things this County excels in, its plenty of Fruit, and the finest Wool in any part of England. And, amongst all sorts of Fruits, the Red-streak Apple (which makes the best sort of Cider) is that which thrives here to admiration.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="72"/>
<P><HI>Hereford,</HI> the chief Place hereof, bears West-North-West from London, and is distant from it 101 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Glocester,</HI> 81 miles, as you may see in Glocester∣shire; then from Glocester to <HI>Ross,</HI> 10 miles; and to <HI>Hereford</HI> 10 more.</P>
<P>'Tis seated on the Banks of the River <HI>Wye,</HI> and another that, runs into it, amongst rich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Meadows and plentiful Corn-fields. Raised out of the Ruins of <HI>Ariconium,</HI> a Place of good account in the time of the Romans. It had once a strong and stately Castle, built by the Normans, which Time has now ruinated. And now it is walled about, having six Gates for entrance, and 15 Watch-Towers for de∣fence. 'Twas a Bishops See in the time of the Britains, and restored to that Dignity by the Saxons Anno 680. Noted besides, for gi∣ving first the Title of Earl, then that of Duke, and lastly that of Viscount, now in the Per∣son of the Right Honourable <HI>Edward D'Evreux,</HI> Viscount Hereford, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Descended to him from his Ancestor Sir <HI>Walter D'Evreux;</HI> who, on the Death of <HI>Robert D'Evreux,</HI> Viscount <HI>Hereford,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> succeeded in the Title of Viscount, Anno 1646.</P>
<P>Here are three Markets a Week, viz. on Wednesdav, Friday, and Saturday. And, in point of Trade, this Place is particularly no∣ted for the Gloves here made, and vended in great quantities in London and elsewhere.</P>

<P>Among which <HI>Pembridge</HI> and <HI>Kyneton</HI> are seated on the River Arrow; <HI>Rosse,</HI> on the Wye; and <HI>Lemster,</HI> on the Lug. This last of chief note for the fine Wool which the Sheep in its Neighbourhood bear, and likewise for its fine Wheat and Flower; as <HI>Webley</HI> is for its good Ale.</P>
<P>At <HI>Kyneton,</HI> a pretty large and well-built Town, they drive a good I rade for narrow Cloths; and the Market is counted the best for Corn, Cattle, Provisions, and several other Commodities, especially the Wednesdays before Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide.</P>
<P><HI>Ledbury;</HI> seated near the <HI>Malvern Hills,</HI> in a rich Clay Ground, is a well built Town, and much inhabited by Clothiers, who drive a good Trade here.</P>
<P>Among the Things remarkable in this Coun∣ty, here is first, by Snod-hill Castle, a Quar∣ry of excellent Marble. And, by Richards Castle, in the North Part of the County, a Well called <HI>Bone-Well,</HI> wherein are always found sinall Fishes Bones, but not a Fin to be seen. Which Well being wholly cleansed of them, yet will the like come again, and no Man knows whe∣ther they be produced naturally, or brought thither in Veins through the Earth.</P>
<P>Neither can I omit to relate the Story of <HI>Marsley Hill,</HI> tho' I could scarce give credit to it, were it not related both by Cambden and Speed, two Authentick Authors. This Hill, in the Year 1571, removed it self with a roar∣ing noise from the place where it stood, and for 3 days together travelled from its old Seat. It began this Motion on Saturday the 7th of February about 6 a Clock at Night, and by 7 a Clock the next Morning it had gone about 200 Foot; carrying with it Sheep in their
<PB N="106" REF="73"/>Coats, Hedge-rows, and Trees, whereof some stood, and others were overthrown. Kinna∣ston Chappel fell down in this Remove, and two high Ways were turned about 300 Foot from their old Paths; the East-Parts turned to the West, &amp; the West turned to the East, Pasturage being left in the place of Tillage, and Tillage on the other side overspreading the Pasturage. Thus about 26 Acres of Ground travelled 3 days together, till being raised to a Hill 12 fa∣doms high, there it rested.</P>
<P>This County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and its Inhabitants known among the Romans by the Name of <HI>Silures</HI>) is now in the Diocese of <HI>Hereford.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, six Members of Parliament, Viz. 2 out of <HI>Hereford,</HI> 2 out of <HI>Lemster,</HI> and 2 out of <HI>Webley.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Hunting∣tonshire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HƲNTINGTONSHIRE,</HI> another Inland County, but of a small extent, is boun∣ded on the <HI>East</HI> by Cambridgeshire; on the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>West</HI> by Northamptonshire; and on the <HI>South,</HI> by Bedfordshire.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length</HI> about 22 Miles, and in <HI>Breadth</HI> 18. The Whole divided into four <HI>Hun∣dreds,</HI> wherein 79 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 6 <HI>Market</HI> Towns.</P>
<P>In former time this County was very Woody, being counted a Forest, and such as afforded excellent Game for Hunting, from whence it took its Denomination. But in the beginning of the Reign of Henry II. it was disforested, being at present a very open Country, and ge∣nerally flat. Only in some Parts it rises into lit∣tle Hills, best for the Plough; as the Valleys are for Pasture, which is counted as good here as any in England.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="73"/>
<P>The East Part of it towards Cambridge∣shire, is something troubled with Fens, which makes the Air not so good here as in other Parts of England. Yet the Natives that dwell about them are healthfull, and many of 'em long-lived; but it is not so with Stran∣gers.</P>
<P>In general this Country is very fertile, both for Corn and Pasturage; and is well watered with Rivers, the chief whereof is the <HI>Owse.</HI></P>
<P>One Thing it is peculiar in, which is its plenty of Willows; from whence it is nick∣named the <HI>Willow-shire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Huntington,</HI> the chief Place of it, bears from London North by West, and is distant from it 48 Miles, thus. From London to <HI>Edmonton</HI> 6; to <HI>Waltham-Cross</HI> 6 more; and 8 from thence to <HI>Ware;</HI> from Ware to <HI>Puckeridge,</HI> 4; to <HI>Roy∣ston,</HI> 9 more; and thence to <HI>Huntington</HI> 15.</P>
<P>The same is pleasantly seated on a soft As∣cent, and on the North Banks of the River <HI>Owse,</HI> over which it has a fair Stone-bridge, which leads to Godmanchester. It is a Town of great Antiquity, and has formerly enjoyed great Priviledges. Once so large and popu∣lous as to contain 15 Parish-Churches, now reduced to four. However it is still a Place of good Trade, well inhabited and frequented, being a Thorough-fare Town for Travellers to and from the North. Here is kept the County Goal, and the County Assizes. And its Market, which is on Saturdays, is well served with Provisions. Of some Note besides for an Abbey, founded here by Maud the Empress; and Eustace Loveloft; the Ruins of which, and of a far more ancient Castle built by King Edward the Elder, are yet to be seen.</P>
<PB N="108" REF="74"/>
<P>This Town became an Earldom presently upon the Norman Conquest, the Title of it injoyed by several Families, before it came to <HI>George,</HI> Lord <HI>Hastings,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Hunting∣ton</HI> by King Henry VIII. Anno 1529. From whom is descended in a right Line the Right Honourable <HI>Theophilus Hastings,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Huntington.</HI></P>

St. <HI>Ives</HI> so called from one <HI>Ivo,</HI> a Persian Bi∣shop, who about the Year 600. travelled (as 'tis said) through England, preaching the Gos∣pel, and here ended his Days. Whose Body, in a short time after, was removed to Bamsey Abbey. This Town is much resorted to for Cat∣tle by London Butchers.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Neots,</HI> or St. <HI>Needs,</HI> from <HI>Neotus</HI> a Monk of Glastenbury. A Man no less holy than learned, whose Body was translated hither from Neotstoke in Cornwal, and in whose Honour Earl Elfrides Palace was converted into a Mo∣nastery. This Town is beautified with a neat Church, and a fine Steeple to it.</P>
<P>A little beneath it, at a Place called <HI>Ailewe∣ston,</HI> are two Springs, the one fresh, and the other brackish; the first good for dim Sights, the other for curing of Scabs and Le∣prosy.</P>
<PB N="109" REF="74"/>
<P><HI>Kimbolton,</HI> a pretty fair Town, seated in the bottom near Bedfordshire, is of chief note for giving the Title of Baron to the Earl of <HI>Man∣ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster;</HI> whose Mansion is called the Castle of Kimbolton.</P>
<P><HI>Ramsey</HI> is seated in the Fens among rich Grounds, towards Cambridgeshire, near the Meers of Ramsey and Whitlesey. Which, with the Rivers that plentifully water it, afford excellent Fish, and wild Fowl in great plenty. A noted Place in former time for its wonderfull rich Abbey, which continued in its glory till its Dissolution by King Henry VIII.</P>
<P>This County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of Mercia, and its Inhabitants Part of the <HI>Iceni,</HI> as the Romans called them) is now in the Diocese of Lincoln.</P>

<HEAD>Kent.</HEAD>
<P><HI>KENT,</HI> in Latin <HI>Cantium,</HI> so called as being seated in a Canton or Corner of the Kingdom, is a large, rich, and pleasant Coun∣try <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ying between the Thames and the Nar∣row Seas. So that it is invironed on all sides with the Sea, except Westward, where it bor∣ders both upon Surrey and Sussex.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, 60 Miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, 30. The Whole divided into five <HI>Lathes</HI> (cal∣led <HI>Sutton, Aylesford, Scray, St. Augustine,</HI> and <HI>Shepway Lathes,</HI>) and these into 67 <HI>Hundreds;</HI> wherein 408 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 30 <HI>Market Towns.</HI> Which is an Argument of its Populousness.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Air</HI> is neither so serene, nor so health∣ful here, as in other Counties, especially near the Sea and Marshes; which makes this Coun∣try
<PB N="110" REF="75"/>so noted for its Kentish Agues. Now, that you may know in few words the Nature of this Country, both as to its Air and Soil, I shall bring in the Remark made upon it, which is, that there are 3 Ridges of Hills in Kent, one called Health without Wealth, the second Health and Wealth, and the third Wealth without Health. Others, as to the Soil, give this different Character of it. <HI>The Weald</HI> for Wood, <HI>East Kent</HI> for Corn, <HI>Rumney</HI> for Meadow, <HI>Tenham</HI> for an Orchard, <HI>Shepey</HI> and <HI>Reculver</HI> for Wheat, <HI>Thanet</HI> for Barley, and <HI>Hed∣corn</HI> for Capons.</P>
<P>In general this may be said of Kent, that it is a Country very good for Corn, and fit for Pasturage, according to the several Plots and Parts thereof; and wondrous full of fruitful and well-ordered Orchards, from whence the City of London is supplied with most sorts of Fruit, but chiefly with Pippins and Cherries, which are counted the best in England. On the Cliffs between Deal and Dover, there grows a great store of Samphire.</P>
<P>The same is well watered with <HI>Rivers.</HI> For, besides the <HI>Thames</HI> that washes its North Parts, here is the <HI>Medway,</HI> which in a manner parts it in the middle, the <HI>Stower</HI> that runs by Can∣terbury, the <HI>Tun</HI> through Tunbridge, and the <HI>Rother</HI> upon which Appledore is seated, not to mention the <HI>lesser Streams.</HI></P>
<P>Of all the Counties in England, this was the first Kingdom of the Heptarchy, and had a par∣ticular King to it self, which no other County ever had. Neither was it conquered by the Normans, the Kentish Men yielding upon Ar∣ticles, and having their ancient Franchises and Customs confirmed to 'em by William the Con∣queror. One of which is the <HI>Cavelkind,</HI> where∣by
<PB N="111" REF="75"/>they are not so bound by Copy-hold as in other Parts of England; Lands of this nature being equally divided here among the male Children, and for want of Males, among the Females. By the same Law they are at age at 15 years old, and they may sell or make over the Land without the consent of the Lord. Also, the Son (tho of a convicted Father for Felony or Murder) succeeds him in such Kind of Lands.</P>
<P>The Kentish Men besides have this to glo∣ry in, that they were the first Christians of this Island. And this is the only County at this time that has two Cities, or Episcopal Sees, namely Canterbury and Rochester.</P>
<P><HI>Canterbury,</HI> the chief Place of this County, is 46 miles East of London, Viz. from Lon∣don to <HI>Dartford,</HI> 12; to <HI>Rochester,</HI> 11 more; from thence to <HI>Sittingborn,</HI> 10; and to <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> 13 more.</P>
<P>A City of great Antiquity, if it was built (as some Authors aver) 900 years before Christ. 'Tis seated on the River <HI>Stower,</HI> (noted for breeding the best Trouts in the South East Parts of <HI>England,</HI>) and is counted in the Lath of S. Augustine. The Buildings of it but mean, and the Wall which encompasses it, in a de∣cayed condition. The greatest Ornament of all is the Cathedral, wherein ly interred the Bodies of eight Kings. For this City had been the Seat of the Kings of Kent, till given by Ethelbert, the first Christian King of this Coun∣try, to Augustine the first Archbishop thereof, and his Successors. Whereupon the King re∣moved his Seat to <HI>Reculver,</HI> a Town by the Sea∣side. In this Cathedral is also interred the Bo∣dy of <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> once Archbishop hereof, that famous Saint so reverenced by the Ro∣manists.
<PB N="112" REF="76"/>In this City, and its Suburbs, are reckoned 14 Parish Churches; besides a Meet∣ing-place under the Cathedral, for the <HI>Walloon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that dwell in this City, who are very nume∣rous, and drive a considerable Trade of the Stuffs they make here. It has two Markets a Week, Wednesdays and Saturdays, the latter of which is the most considerable.</P>
<P>But to the honour this City has had of being the Regal Seat of the first Kings of Kent, and of being to this day the See of the Primate of England, let us add the Coronation of King John and Queen Izabel his Wife, the Marriages of Henry II. and Edward I, and the Interments of Edward the black Prince, King Henry the Fourth, and Queen Joan his Wife, all which was performed in this Place.</P>

<P>Among which <HI>Rockester</HI> requires the pre∣eminence, as a Bishops See, and the second for Antiquity in all the Island. It is seated upon the Medway, over which it has a state∣ly Stone-bridge, one of the fairest in England. It consists most of one principal Street, which extends it self a long way; the Houses being but ordinary, as they are inhabited for the most part but by Trades-men and Inn-keepers.

A Town of great Re∣fort for Travellers, both by Sea and Land, that either come up the Thames to London, or go down the River in order to take Ship∣ping; well furnished therefore with Inns, and other Houses of Entertainment, but noted for their exactings. Over against it, in Essex, is
<PB N="114" REF="77"/><HI>Tilbury-Fort,</HI> that commands this Passage.</P>
<P>Nearer to London stands <HI>Dartford,</HI> on the River <HI>Darent,</HI> not far from its Influx into the Thames; which gives good advantage to the Town, in conveying their Goods to London. The Town is large; and, being in Dover Road, is therefore well accommodated with Inns and Houses of Entertainment. Of chief note for the Rebellion begun here, and headed by <HI>John Tiler,</HI> (commonly nick-named <HI>Jack∣straw,</HI>) in the Reign of Richard the second, Anno 1381.</P>
<P><HI>Woolwich,</HI> seated on the Thames, is remark∣able for nothing but its Dock, used for the Royal Navy.</P>
<P>But nearer to London stand <HI>Greenwich</HI> and <HI>Deptford,</HI> two Towns of better account, tho they be no Market-Towns. The first is plea∣santly seated on the Banks of the Thames, a neat and healthful Place, well inhabited and frequented by Gentry. Adjoyning to which is a Royal House, called Queen Elizabeth's Pallace, with a Park about it, yielding a fair Prospect. Besides another Pallace by the Rivers-side, first built by Humphrey Duke of Glocester, and after him inlarged and beauti∣fy'd by several Kings; till being fallen to ruin, King Charles II. attempted to make it a state∣ly Pile of Building, but left it unfinished. Ad∣joyning to Greenwich is <HI>Black-Heath,</HI> noted for the Battels fought here against Rebels, under the Reigns of Richard II. Henry VI. and Henry VII.</P>
<P><HI>Deptford</HI> is another large Town, divided into the Upper and the Lower; seated the nearest to Surrey, at the very fall of the <HI>Ravensburn</HI> (a small River) into the Thames, among rich and low Meadows. A Town well
<PB N="115" REF="77"/>inhabited and frequented by Sea-men, by rea∣son of its Docks and Store-houses for the Na∣vy Royal.</P>
<P><HI>Bromley</HI> stands upon the same River; graced with the Bishop of Rochester's Seat (a Coun∣try House) by it. One of whose late Prede∣cessors, I mean Dr. <HI>Warner,</HI> founded here a Colledge for 20 Clergy-mens Widows. Where each one hath a fair Apartment, and 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year Rent-Charge duly paid; and, for their publick Devotion, a Chaplain, provided with fair Lodgings, and 50 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year Rent-Charge.</P>
<P><HI>Eltham,</HI> seated on the South-side of Shooters∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hill, among Woods, is a neat Town, and well inhabited by Gentry. Formerly honoured with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Royal Pallace, but laid aside and gone to decay, since Greenwich came to be lookt upon (as indeed it is) a Place of greater Delight.</P>
<P>Near Westram, on the Darent, stands <HI>Ot∣ford,</HI> on or near the same River, a place of good Antiquity. Noted for the Battel sought here betwixt King Edmund surnamed Iron∣side, and Canute the Dane, wherein Canute was put to flight, with the Loss of 5000 Danes.</P>
<P><HI>S. Mary Cray</HI> is so called from <HI>Cray,</HI> a small (but swift) River, on which it is situate in a Wood-land Country. Its Market is very in∣considerable.</P>
<P><HI>Sevenoke,</HI> not far distant from thence, is a Town of good Resort. Here is an Hospi∣tal, and a Free-School, founded by one <HI>Wil∣liam Sevenoke,</HI> Lord Mayor of London, Anno 1418. who was a Foundling in this Town, and from hence took his Name.</P>
<P><HI>Tunbridge,</HI> so called from the River <HI>Tun</HI> upon which it is seated, within few miles of its fall into the Medway, is a noted place for its
<PB N="116" REF="78"/>mineral <HI>Waters,</HI> so much resorted unto by the Gentry, and drunk in the Summer-Season. Known by the Name of <HI>Tunbridge-Wells,</HI> tho' at some distance from thence, at a Place cal∣led <HI>Speldherst.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cranbrook</HI> is seated at the very head of the River Medway, and <HI>Lenham</HI> at the Spring of the Stower. Upon which last River you will find also both <HI>Ashford</HI> and <HI>Wye.</HI> And, upon the Rother, <HI>Appledore,</HI> an Island called <HI>Oxney-Isle.</HI></P>
<P>This Island is seated in the South-West Parts of Kent, towards Sussex; incompassed with the River <HI>Rother,</HI> and a lesser River that runs into it. It has but 3 Towns in it, <HI>Wittrisham, Stonae,</HI> and <HI>Ebony,</HI> all three but inconsidera∣ble.</P>
<P>North-Eastward, near the Isle of Shepey, lie <HI>Milton</HI> and <HI>Feversham;</HI> the first a Place of good account in the Reign of Edward the Con∣fessour, but <HI>Feversham</HI> the best trading Place at this time. For it has the Conveniency of a Creek that comes up to it, which makes it the chief Port-Town for all this Part of Kent, being well frequented by Hoys, and such like small Vessels. The Town is large, and well inhabited; and its Markets well served with Provisions. But it is counted an Aguish Place. Here was ere∣cted an Abbey by King Stephen where him∣self, his Queen, and Eustace his Son were bu∣ried. Of late years it has been dignified with the Title of an Earldom, in the Person of the Right Honourable <HI>Lewis de Duras,</HI> Earl of Feversham, &amp;c. And, since that, it has made a greater Noise in the World, on the account of the late King's landing there <HI>Incognito,</HI> in the first Attempt he made to withdraw himself in∣to France.</P>
<PB N="117" REF="78"/>
<P>Not far from this Town are Pits of a great depth, narrow at the mouth, and very broad below; with several distinct Rooms in 'em and Pillars of Chalk, as it were to support, them.</P>
<P><HI>Whitstable</HI> and <HI>Reculver</HI> are two Sea-Towns, few Miles North of Canterbury, well fre∣quented by Hoymen and Fishermen. <HI>Recul∣ver,</HI> of special note, for that Ethelbert, the first Christian King of Kent, had his Palace, and did reside here. Its Church remarkable for its lofty spired Steeple, which serves for a Sea-Mark.</P>
<P>I come now to the <HI>Cinque-Port</HI> Towns that belong to this County, Those are called <HI>Cinque∣Forts,</HI> which lying on the Coast of Kent and Sussex had great Priviledges granted them by former Kings, the better to enable 'em to se∣ture these Coasts against the Incroachments of France. They were at first but five, as is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mply'd by the Word, which is originally French. But three more were added to 'em, which makes up the Number of eight. Where∣of four are in this County, Viz. <HI>Dover, Sand∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich, Hythe,</HI> and <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Rumney;</HI> the others in Sussex, to wit, <HI>Rye, Winchelsey, Seaford,</HI> and <HI>Hastings.</HI> And of these in their proper place.</P>
<P><HI>Dover,</HI> the principal of 'em, stands over a∣gainst <HI>Calais</HI> in France; the Passage by Sea being reckoned but 7 Leagues (or 21 Miles) over. Seated it is in the very South-East Point of <HI>Kent,</HI> in a Bottom among Cliffs, from whence one may easily discern the Coast of France. Upon one of those Cliffs stands the Castle, both to command and defend the Town, which some will have to be built by Julius Caesar. A Castle of that importance, that Philip King of France,
<PB N="118" REF="79"/>when Lewis his Son (being called in hither by the factious Barons against King John) had gotten many Towns and Forts, without being able to get the mastery of this, slighted all that was taken, and said his Son had not one Foot of Land in England, if he were not Ma∣ster of Dover-Castle. As to the Buildings of this Town, they are but mean; tho' it be in Time of Peace the greatest Thorow-fare for Travellers from England to France, and from that Kingdom to this. It has formerly had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parish-Churches, which are now reduced to two. Its Haven is indifferent good, and (as <HI>Calais</HI> on the other side of the Water) fit on∣ly for smaller Vessels. As for honourary Ti∣tles, I don't find any it has yielded before the Reign of King Charles I, by whom <HI>Henry Carey,</HI> Viscount <HI>Rochford,</HI> and Baron <HI>Hunsden,</HI> was created Earl of <HI>Dover,</HI> Anno 1627. Which Title expired with his Son <HI>John Carey,</HI> dying without Issue-male in the Year 1667; the Barony continuing in the Collateral Line.</P>
<P><HI>Sandwich</HI> lies about 12 miles North from Dover, and was formerly a Place of good Strength. But, since the Sea has forsaken it, and its Haven has been choakt up, it has los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much of its Trade and Reputation. Noted however for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>Edward Montague,</HI> the pre∣sent Earl of Sandwich. Devolved to him from his Father, <HI>Edward Montague,</HI> created Baro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Montague of <HI>S. Neots,</HI> Viscount <HI>Hinchingbroo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> by King Charles II 1660. Who lost his Life in a Sea-fight against the Dutch, May 29. 1672.</P>
<P><HI>Hythe,</HI> another of the Cinque-Port Towns has run the same fate as Sandwich, by the un∣kindness of the Sea. It lies South and by Wes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="119" REF="79"/>from Dover, within a Mile of Sangate Ca∣de.</P>
<P><HI>Rumney</HI> is seated in a Marsh so called, a∣bout 14 Miles long, and 8 broad. Much more famous for the Conveniency of the Marsh in the Grazing of Cattel, than either for good Air or a good Harbour.</P>
<P>To the Port of Dover belongs <HI>Folkstone,</HI> as a Member thereof; a Sea-Town near San∣gate Castle, formerly containing 5 Parish Churches, now reduced to one.</P>
<P><HI>Lyd</HI> is likewise a Member of the Cinque-Ports. And so are <HI>Deal</HI> and <HI>Fordwich,</HI> Mem∣bers of the Town and Port of Sandwich. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst of which is of most note in these Parts for the Fleets that from time to time harbour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereabouts, in order to sail East or West.</P>

<HEAD>The Kentish Isles, <HI>Thanet</HI> and <HI>Shepey.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In the North-East Parts of Kent, near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andwich, is an Island called <HI>Thanet,</HI> sur∣rounded on all sides with the Sea, except West∣ward, where it is severed from the main Land by the River Stoure, here called Yenlade; but so, that, by the benefit of a Causey and Passage for the Waters in convenient Places, it is united to the Continent (or main Land) of Kent. This Island called by the Saxons <HI>Thanet,</HI> from <HI>Thanatos,</HI> or <HI>Athanatos,</HI> by which Name it is found in <HI>Solinus,</HI> is about 9 Miles in length, and 8 in breadth at the broadest.</P>
<P>An Island plentifully stored with Provisions, but Corn especially; and withall very popu∣lous. Famous for being the Place which the Saxons landed at, when they first came into Britain; the first Livery and Seisin which they had of the whole Kingdom, conferred by the improvident Bounty of Vortiger, to whose
<PB N="120" REF="80"/>Aid they were called in. And no less remar∣kable for being the Landing Place of Augu∣stine the Monk, when he brought the Gospel to the victorious Heathen Saxons, and by his Preaching subjected them to the Rules of Chri∣stianity.</P>
<P>At <HI>Stonar,</HI> a Port Town of this Island, is the Sepulchre (says <HI>Heylin</HI>) of <HI>Vortimer,</HI> King of the Britains. Who, having vanquished the Saxons in many Battels, and finally driven them out of the Island, desired to be here interred, on a fond conceit that his dead Corps would fright them from Landing any more upon these Goasts. Which he did probably in imi∣tation of that <HI>Scipio,</HI> who having had a for∣tunate Hand against those of Carthage, gave order that his Tomb should be turned towards Africk, to fright the Carthaginians from the Coasts of Italy. But the Britains found at last by sad experience, the difference there is be∣twixt a King in the Field and a King in the Grave.</P>
<P>On the North Shore of this Island is a Point of Land, of special note among Mariners, by the Name of <HI>North Foreland.</HI> And the whole Isle in general is noted for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>Thomas Tuf∣ton,</HI> the present Earl of Thanet.</P>
<P><HI>Shepey</HI> is another Island, much about the bigness of the former. Surrounded on all sides with the Sea, except Southward, where it is parted by the Medway from the main Land of Kent. This is likewise a very fruitful I∣sland, winch from the great Flocks of Sheep that feed here, came perhaps to be called <HI>She∣pey.</HI> 'Tis well watered with Rivers, espe∣cially the South Parts of it. And the Soil of it has a peculiar quality, in not breeding
<PB N="121" REF="80"/>of Moles. This Island has been much haras∣sed by the Danes, and by the Followers of Earl Goodwin and his Sons. At present it gives the Title of Countess to the Lady Eli∣zabeth, Countess of Shepey, Lady Dacres, &amp;c. The chief Place is <HI>Queenborough,</HI> which stands on the West Coast. Besides which here are se∣veral other Towns, as <HI>Minster, East-Church, Warden, Leysden, Elmley,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>West from this Island is another of a small Compass, on which stands the Fort called <HI>Sheerness,</HI> which commands the Mouth of the Thames and Medway.</P>
<P>To conclude, as to the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> it stands now divided between the Diocese of Canterbury and Rochester, and was (as I said before) a Kingdom of it self in the Time of the Heptarchy. Called <HI>Cantium</HI> and the Inha∣bitants <HI>Cantii,</HI> by the Romans.</P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 16 Members of Parliament. Viz. Two out of each of these Towns, <HI>Canterbury, Ro∣chester, Maidstone,</HI> and <HI>Queenborough;</HI> besides these Cinque-Port Towns, <HI>Sandwich, Dover, Hythe,</HI> and <HI>New-Rumney.</HI></P>
<P>It has been for several Ages dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom, that is, ever since the Entrance of the Normans, but not without seve∣ral Interruptions. Till upon the Death of <HI>William Nevil,</HI> Earl thereof, the Title was con∣ferred by King Edward IV. upon <HI>Edmund Grey,</HI> Lord <HI>Ruthen,</HI> Created Earl of <HI>Kent</HI> An∣no 1465. From whom is descended the Right Honourable <HI>Anthony Grey,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> Grandchild of <HI>Anthony Grey</HI> Clerk, Par∣son of <HI>Burbage</HI> in the County of <HI>Leicester.</HI> Who, upon the Death of <HI>Henry Grey,</HI> without Issue

<P>Lastly, to those several Things Remarkable in this County, which I brought in occasional∣ly, I shall only add, That at <HI>Egerton</HI> is a Spring, whose Water turns Wood into Stone. And at Boxley-Abbey another Spring of the same nature, the Water whereof will turn in 9 days time Sticks and small Wood into Stone.</P>

<P><HI>LANCASHIRE,</HI> or the County Pala∣tine of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> is a large Maritim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> County, in the North-West Parts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> England. Founded on the <HI>East</HI> with York shire, and part of Derbyshire; on the <HI>Wes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> by the Irish Sea; on the <HI>North,</HI> by Cumberlan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Westmorland; and on the <HI>South,</HI> by Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣shire.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, is 57 miles its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, 32. The Who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> divided into six <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 61 <HI>Parishe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and 26 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI> The Number of <HI>Parish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="123" REF="83"/>but small, in so large a quantity of Ground; but that there are many Chappels of Ease, equal to Parishes elsewhere for Multitudes of People.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Air</HI> is sharp, thin, and piercing, seldom troubled with Fogs. And the Inhabi∣tants accordingly are healthfull, comely, strong, and long-lived, not subject to many Disea∣ses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> differs much, according to its dif∣ferent nature and situation; some Parts being Mountainous, and of the Champain Country some very fruitfull, some Mossy, and the rest Moorish.</P>
<P>The Champain Country is very good for Wheat and Barley; but that which lies at the bottom of the Hills is best for Oats.</P>
<P>From the Mosses, which are not unlike the Irish Bogs, some of them many Miles in Com∣pass, the common People get Turves for their Firing. And sometimes they dig up Trees out of them, which serve both for Building and Fewel. Cambden seems to be of Opinion, that they are subterraneous Trees growing un∣der Ground, as some other Plants do.</P>
<P>The Mountainous Part, which lies East∣ward, is full of stony, craggy, and barren Hills, bare of Wood, and the Habitation of Foxes, Conies, Otters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Amongst these Hills, some are of a prodigious height; espe∣cially <HI>Pendle-Hill,</HI> on the top whereof grow's a peculiar Plant called <HI>Cloudsberry,</HI> as coming from the Clouds. But one thing besides is remarkable in this Hill, that, whenever the Top of it is covered with a Mist, 'tis an in∣fallible Sign of Rain.</P>
<PB N="124" REF="84"/>
<P>The Country in general is well watered with <HI>Rivers;</HI> the chief whereof are the <HI>Mer∣sey,</HI> the <HI>Rible,</HI> and the <HI>Lon,</HI> all three running from East to West into the Irish Sea. The <HI>Mersey</HI> Waters the South Parts, and serves for a Boundary betwixt this County and Che∣shire; the <HI>Rible</HI> waters the middle; and the <HI>Lon,</HI> the North Parts.</P>
<P>Besides these Rivers, and many others of less note, here are several great <HI>Meers</HI> (or <HI>Lakes,</HI>) as <HI>Merton,</HI> and <HI>Winder</HI> (or <HI>Wimander</HI>) Meer. This last divides part of <HI>Lancashire</HI> from <HI>West∣morland,</HI> reaching about 10 miles in length, and 3 or 4 in breadth. It has (as most Lakes in the North) a clear pebbly Bottom, whence the Saying, that this Lake is all paved with Stone. And it breeds great store of Fish, particularly Trouts, Pikes, Pearches, Eels, and Skellies. But there's one sort of Fish peculiar to it, and not to be found else∣where, except in <HI>Vlles Water,</HI> another Lake, bordering both upon Cumberland and West∣morland. <HI>Charre</HI> is the Name of it, and 'tis a dainty Fish, whereof many Pies are yearly sent abroad for Presents.</P>
<P>In short, tho' this Country in general cannot be called a fruitfull Country, yet what is good of it yields abundance of good Grass and Corn, the fairest Oxen in England, and in general all sorts of Provisions. Fish and Fowl particularly here's great plenty of; and in the River Lon, near Cockerfand Abbey, is great store of Salmon.</P>
<P>To make Linnen, here grows a great deal of Flax; for Fewel the Country yields, not only fat Earth, but good Coals; and for Build∣ing, Quarries of good Stone.</P>
<PB N="125" REF="84"/>
<P><HI>Lancaster,</HI> the Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Town, bears from Lon∣don North-West and by North, and is distant therefrom (by common computation) 187 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Stafford,</HI> 104, for the particulars whereof I refer you to Staffordshire. Then from Stafford to <HI>Stone,</HI> 10; to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> 6 more; thence to <HI>Warington,</HI> 20; to <HI>Wigan,</HI> 14 more; to <HI>Preston,</HI> 14 more; then to <HI>Gar∣stang,</HI> 10; and to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> 15 more.</P>
<P>A Town pleasantly seated, in a good Soil, on the South-side of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver <HI>Lon,</HI> near its fall into the Sea. From which River it came to be called <HI>Loncaster,</HI> since turn'd into <HI>Lancaster,</HI> as from <HI>Lancaster</HI> the whole County took the Name of <HI>Lancashire.</HI> The Town not very well peopled, nor much frequented. There are in it several fair and long Streets, from the Length whereof this Town (I suppose) might be called <HI>Longovicus</HI> by the Emperor Antonine. And yet there is but one Parish-Church, which indeed is large and fair. It stands on the side of a Hill; on the top of which is the Castle, now made use of for the County Goal both for Debtors and Malefactors, and for keeping the Assizes for the County. Besides the Church and Castle, two of the chief Ornaments of this Town, here's a fair Stone-Bridge over the <HI>Lon,</HI> supported by five Arches. To which add the Market-house, or Town-hall, where the Mayor and his Brethren keep their Courts. Its Market, which is kept on Saturdays, is com∣monly well furnished with all sorts of Provi∣sions, but Fish (and among the rest, Salmon,) especially.</P>
<P>Lastly, this Town is of sufficient Fame in the Annals of England, for those noble Per∣sons which have successively born the Titles of Earls and Dukes of it; the greatest Princes
<PB N="126" REF="85"/>in their time, for Revenues, of any Subjects in Christendom. Of which House there have been four Kings of England, all under the Name of Henry, viz. Henry the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh. The last, by marrying with Elizabeth, Daughter and Heir to Edward IV. of the House of York, did hap∣pily unite the two Houses of York and Lanca∣ster; Whose Competition for the Crown of England, under the Names of Red and White Roses, had caused more Blood-shed than the Conquest of France by the English.</P>

<P><HI>Manchester,</HI> is seated upon a stony Hill in the South-East Parts of the County, between the Rivers Irk and Irwell, both which empty themselves, not far off into the Mersey. This Town, called by Antonine the Emperour <HI>Man∣tunium,</HI> was a Station of the Romans. And it
<PB N="127" REF="85"/>is to this day a Town much beyond Lancaster, in beauty, and populousness. Its chief Orna∣ments are the Colledge, and the Market-Place; but, above all, the Collegiate Church, beauti∣fied with a small Quire of excellent Workman∣ship. Honoured besides with the Title of an Earldom, in the person of the Right Honoura∣ble <HI>Charles Montague,</HI> the present Earl of Man∣chester; derived to him from his great Grand∣father <HI>Henry Montague,</HI> Viscount <HI>Mandeville,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Manchester</HI> by King Charles I. Anno 1625. being then Lord Treasurer, and President of the Council, and afterwards Lord Privy Seal.</P>
<P>And lastly, 'tis a noted Place for its Linnen and Woollen Cloths; as also for its Cottons, which are held in great esteem.</P>
<P><HI>Leverpool</HI> is the next Place of chief note in this County. Tis an excellent Sea-port, com∣modiously seated at the fall of the River Mer∣sey into the Sea, where it affords a safe Har∣bour for Ships, and a convenient Passage into Ireland. To the immortal Praise of the Fami∣ly of the <HI>Mores</HI> of <HI>Banck-hall,</HI> this Town has been very much improved and beautified, at their Charge and Industry. Here is a Town∣house erected upon Pillars and Arches of hewn Stone, and underneath an Exchange for the Merchants. Among its Antiquities, a Castle on the South-side, which commands the Pool, built by King John, during his stay here for a Wind to Ireland; and on the West-side, upon the River, the Tower, being a stately and strong Pile of Building.</P>
<P><HI>Preston,</HI> near to Leverpool, is a fair, large, well inhabited and frequented Borough-Town. Seated on the North-side of the Rible, over which it has a very fair Stone-bridge. In this

<P>Not far from Preston aforesaid is a small Town, from the River on which it is situate, called <HI>Rible-Chester,</HI> which has been esteemed and called the richest Town in Christendom. No doubt but it has been a Place of great account in the Time of the Romans, if we consider the many Statues, pieces of Coin, Al∣tars, Pillars, Inscriptions, and other Pieces of Antiquity, that have been often digged up here.</P>
<P><HI>Wigan</HI> is another Town of note in this Coun∣try. Seated on the River Dowles, and much inhabited by Braziers, Pewterers, Diers, Weavers of Rugs, Coverlets, and Tackling for Bedding. Of special note for the choicest Coal in Eng∣land, called <HI>Caunel;</HI> but most of all for a burn∣ing Well, not far from it.</P>
<P><HI>Warington,</HI> a good large Town, is seated on the River <HI>Mersey,</HI> over which there's a fine Stone-bridge, which leads to Cheshire.

<P><HI>LEICESTERSHIRE,</HI> an Inland County, is bounded on the <HI>East</HI> by the Coun∣ties of Lincoln and Rutland; on the <HI>West,</HI> by Warwickshire; <HI>Northward,</HI> by Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire; and <HI>Southward,</HI> by Nor∣thamptonshire.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, is about 30 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, about 25. The whole divided into six <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 192 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 12 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> in this County is mild and whol∣som; and the Inhabitants accordingly are healthy, and long-lived.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil,</HI> in the South-East parts especially, is extream fertile for all sorts of Grain, but chiefly Peas and Beans; and has also rich Pastures, feeding Cattel and Sheep in great Numbers, whose Wool for its fineness is had in great esteem. But the North-West part is gene∣rally barren, and in some places rocky and sto∣ny.
<PB N="130" REF="87"/>About the Forest of <HI>Charwood</HI> (where is <HI>Bardon-Hill</HI>) is great store of Lime-Stone, wherewith they manure their Ground.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fewel,</HI> this Country is but thinly cloathed with Wood, especially in the South-East Parts. But this Defect is sufficiently sup∣ply'd by the great plenty of Pit-coal digged up in the North Parts.</P>
<P>Here are a great many small Rivers, but none of any long Course, besides the <HI>Stower</HI> and the <HI>Wreak.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leicester,</HI> the County Town, bears from London North-North-West, and is distant therefrom 78 miles, thus.

<P>It is pleasantly seated in a good Air, and rich Soil, on the Banks of the Stower (of old called Leir) that washes its North and West Parts, and over which it has two Bridges. Once a Bishops See, and in those Days. beau∣tified with a fair Collegiate Church, a magni∣ficent Abbey, and a strong Castle, all decay'd and ruined by the iniquity and injury of the Times. As to the present State of it, it is indifferent large, containing 3 Parish Churches, has several good Buildings, and is well inha∣bited. In short, 'tis in as good plight, both for Trade and Buildings, as most Towns are that want a navigable River. And its Mar∣ket, which is on Saturdays, is well served with Provisions, and Country Commodities.</P>

<P><HI>Mont-Sorrel</HI> is seated on a great Eminency, near the Stowr, over which it has a Bridge.

<P><HI>Melton-Mowbray</HI> is situate in a fertile Soil, on the banks of the Wreak, over which it has two Stone-bridges. <HI>Harborough,</HI> on the Borders of Northamptonshire, and the banks of the Weland, which parts the two Counties.</P>
<P><HI>Bosworth</HI> is loftily seated on a Hill, and in a fertile Soil. Noted for the bloody Battle fought at Redmore, near adjoyning, betwixt Richard III. and his Successor Henry VII.
<PB N="132" REF="88"/>Which decided the long-depending Differences betwixt the Houses of York and Lancaster, giving the Crown from Richard to Henry, de∣scended from the latter House. Richard being slain in this Battle, his Body was ignomini∣ously cast cross a Horse's back, naked and torn in pieces, and meanly buried in the Grey-Friars of Leicester. Which being afterwards destroy'd, the Stone-Chest wherein the Corps lay, serves now in an Inn for a drinking Trough for Horses.</P>
<P><HI>Loughborow,</HI> a good handsom Town, flands pleasantly, among fertile Meadows, near the Forest of Charwood, on the Banks of the Ri∣ver Stowr, over which it has a Bridge. <HI>Lutter∣worth,</HI> a goodly Town also, beautified with a large and fair Church, with a neat and lofty Spire-Steeple, is seated in a good Soil, on the River Swift, which at a small distance from hence, falls into the Avon in Warwickshire. Of this Town the famous <HI>Wicless</HI> was Parson, an okl Champion against the Corruptions and Errours of the Church of Rome.</P>
<P>This County (now in the Diocese of Lin∣coln) was part of the ancient Kingdom of Mercia, in the Time of the Heptarchy; and its Inhabitants (with several of their Neigh∣bours) went, among the ancient Romans, under the Name of <HI>Coritani.</HI></P>

<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, almost 60 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, 35. The Whole divided into 3 Parts, called <HI>Lindsey, Kesteven,</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> And these 3 Divisions contain 30 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 630 <HI>Pa∣rishes,</HI> and 35 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>This Country being Fenny, especially in the East and South Parts, makes the <HI>Air</HI> some∣thing unhealthful, because it is apt to be thick and foggy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil,</HI> in the North and West Parts, is exceeding pleasant and fertile, stored with Pasturage, Arable, and Meadow Grounds. But the East and South Parts, that are full of Fenny Grounds, and something brackish by reason of the Salt Waters that come in from the Sea through several Inlets, are barren, and unfit for Corn. 'Tis true, in recompence thereof, there is such a plenty both of Fowl and Fish, that no County in the Kingdom can compare with it. And there goes a Story, that at one draught with a Net 30<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 Mallards have been taken, besides other sorts. How true it is, I am as yet to seek; but am apt to think, there's one Cypher too much.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> no County in England is better irrigated, nor Rivers any where more plentifull of Fish. Northward is the <HI>Humber,</HI> which (as I said before) parts it from York∣shire; and Westward the <HI>Trent,</HI> which severs Part of it from Nottinghamshire.

<P>That Part of the County which goes by the Name of <HI>Lindsey</HI> lies to the Northward, and is so named from <HI>Lindissi,</HI> the ancient Name of Lincoln, according to Beda. This Part is so surrounded with Water, that it is an Island; and its Extent so great, in pro∣portion to the rest, that it takes up at least one half of the County. Noted for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>Robert Bertie,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Lindsey,</HI> Lord Great Chamberlain of England. <HI>Kesteven,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> take up the South Parts from Lindsey, <HI>Holland</HI> lying towards the Sea, and <HI>Kesteven</HI> West from it. Of <HI>Holland</HI> there has been 3 Earls, <HI>Henry, Robert,</HI> and <HI>Edward Rich.</HI> The first, created Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> by King James I. Anno 1624. <HI>Robert,</HI> his Son, succeed∣ed not only in this Title, but also in that of Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> upon the Death of his Cousin∣german, Charles Rich, Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who died without Issue.

<P>A City seated on the side of a Hill, the lower part whereof is watered by the River <HI>Witham;</HI> over which there are several Bridges, for the Conveniency of Passengers. A Place of great Antiquity, whose ancient ruinated
<PB N="135" REF="89"/>Places are still an Argument of its former Greatness. In the Time of the Romans 'twas a Town of great strength and fame; and, in the Time of the Normans a Place of great Trading. Whose flourishing Condition occa∣sioned the Episcopal See, then at Dorchester near Oxon, to be removed hither. But this City has gone through all the Calamities of Fire, Sword, and Earth-quake. Which has so much weakned and impaired it, that of 50 Churches it is said to have had for divine Worship, there remains but 15, besides the Cathedral.</P>
<P>In the Time of the Saxons, King Arthur drove away their Forces from this Place. The like did Edmund Ironside to the Danes, who had made sore havock thereof. On the 5th of Sept. 1140. here was a great Battel fought between King Stephen and Maud the Empress, in which the King was taken Pri∣soner, and afterwards laid in irons in Bristol. On the 19th of May 1217. here was ano∣ther sore Battel fought betwixt King Henry III. and his disloyal Barons, who stood for Lewis the Dauphin of France; in which the King got the day.</P>
<P>But, whatever Disasters and Calamities this City has gone through, still 'tis a large, populous, and well frequented Place. Dig∣nified not only with an Episcopal See, whose Diocese to this day is the greatest of any in the Kingdom; but also for many Ages, with the Title of an Earldom. Which, having passed through severall Families, with frequent Interruptions, came at last to be in the pos∣session of <HI>Edward Fiennes,</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> who being Lord Admiral in Queen Elizabeth's Time, was by her Majesty created Earl
<PB N="136" REF="90"/>of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> Anno 1565. From whom the Ti∣tle is now devolved, in a direct Line, to the Right Honourable <HI>Edward Clinton,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Lincoln.</HI></P>
<P>The Cathedral, or Minster, as now standing, is one of the stateliest Piles in En∣gland, and perhaps in Christendom; high seated on a Hill, and from thence discerned over all the Country. In short, this City is a County of it self, whose Liberties extend about 20 miles in compass; and is called the County of the City of Lincoln.

<PB N="141" REF="92"/>an honourary Title to any Family, till King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ames conferred it on <HI>Sir Oliver St. Johns.</HI> Who, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>possibly might affect to be thence denominated, as fetching his Descent from the Lady <HI>Marga∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et Beauchamp,</HI> Grandmother to King Henry VII, the Heir of the Lancastrian Family.

<P><HI>Kirkton</HI> is situate on a sandy Ground rising in that flat Country.

<PB N="145" REF="94"/>
<P><HI>Ʋxbridge</HI> is another good Town, that lies North of Stanes, on the River Coln, which parts (as I said before) this County from Buckinghamshire. And, as it is seated in the high Road from London to Oxford, so it is well accommodated with Inns, and Houses of In∣tertainment.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Edgeware,</HI> 'tis but a small Town.</P>
<P>But, besides these four Market-Towns, the flourishing City of London has such an In∣fluence over all its Neighbourhood, that it swarms all over with pretty Towns, not only in Middlesex, but even in Surrey.</P>
<P>In Middlesex, as <HI>Islington, Highgate, Hamp∣sted, Chelsey, Kensington, Fulham, Hamersmith, Thistleworth, Hounslow,</HI> &amp;c. most of them graced with the Seats of divers Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Citizens.</P>

<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, six Members of Parliament; viz. 4 out of London, and 2 out of West∣minster.</P>
<P>As for honourary Titles, I know not by what popular Errour the Citizens of London reckoned the Lord Mayor elect for Earl of <HI>Middlesex.</HI> But whatever Ground it had, now it has none to stand on, since that Title was bestowed, first on <HI>Lionel</HI> Lord <HI>Cranfield,</HI> Lord Treasurer of England, created Earl of <HI>Mid∣dlesex</HI> by King James I. Anno 1622.

<P>Neither is it to be omitted, that betwixt Brentford and Colebrook is a small Town reckoned as 3 Mannors, viz. <HI>Arlington, Shepston,</HI> and <HI>Dawling.</HI> From the first of these Mannors <HI>Henry Bennet,</HI> the late Earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> took his Title.

<P><HI>MONMOƲTHSHIRE,</HI> formerly a Welch County, and now reckoned among the English, is bounded <HI>on the East</HI> by the River Wye, which parts it from Glocestershire; <HI>on the West,</HI> by two Welch Counties, Brecknock∣shire

<P>It is blest, not only with a healthfull and temperate <HI>Air,</HI> but also with a rich <HI>Soil.</HI> And, though the Country be both hilly and woody, yet all Parts thereof are fruitfull, and scarce any barren. The Hills are grazed upon by great and small Cattel, and the Val∣leys laden with Corn and Grass.</P>
<P>Its fertility is much furthered by its being plentifully watered with so many Rivers, the principal whereof are the <HI>Ʋske</HI> and the <HI>Wye,</HI> the <HI>Rumney</HI> and the <HI>Monnow,</HI> all which fall into the Severn. Among which the first two are full of Salmon and Trouts.</P>

<P><HI>Chepstow</HI> stands upon the side of a Hill, on the Banks of the Wye, near its fall into the Severn. A Town in former times famous, and of great resort; supposed to be raised out of the Ruins of <HI>Venta Silurum,</HI> 4 miles distant, the ancient and chief City of the <HI>Silures,</HI> which flourished in the Days of Antonine the Em∣perour. This Town, says Cambden, was fortified about with a Wall of a large Circuit, and had a very spacious Castle, once fronted by a Prio∣ry, the better part of which being pulled down, the rest was converted to a Parish Church. At this present time, the Town is large and well built, well inhabited, and frequented; having a fair and high Bridge over the Wye. And so it needs, for here the River rises to a great height.</P>
<P>In the Year 1606. the Moor (or Marsh) near Chepstow was very much indamaged by the Severn. For that Year, at the Change of the Moon in February, this River at a Spring∣tide
<PB N="149" REF="96"/>was driven back for 3 days together with a South Wind. Which made it swell so high, that it came rushing in a main upon this Tract, and carried all before it.</P>
<P><HI>Newport,</HI> a goodly Town, is seated on the Uske, over which it has a fair Bridge; the Uske discharging it self not far off into the Se∣vern, where it has a good Haven, bearing the Name of the Town.</P>
<P>Some miles East from this Haven is the <HI>Gold-Cliff,</HI> so called from the golden Colour of the Stones that lie hereabouts; which makes some suspect a Mine to be there. And opposite to that Cliff, about the midst of the Severn, lieth a small Isle, called <HI>Denny-Island.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pont-Pool</HI> is but a small Town, seated be∣twixt the Hills. Of chief note for its Iron-Mills.</P>
<P><HI>Ʋske,</HI> a good large Town, is so called from the River Uske on which it is situate, with a Bridge over it. 'Tis beautified with well built Stone-houses, and formerly was fortified with a large and strong Castle, now ruinated. According to Antonine, here stood the little City <HI>Burrium.</HI> But, not far from it Northward is <HI>Ragland Castle,</HI> a noble Seat belonging to the Duke of Beaufort.</P>
<P><HI>Abergavenny,</HI> by Antonine called <HI>Gobanium,</HI> stands also upon the Uske, where a small River (Keveny by name) empty's it self into it. This is a Place of some strength, being forti∣fied with Walls, and a Castle of great note in former times. The Town is large, the Houses well built, and injoy's a good Trade, for Flan∣nels especially.</P>
<P><HI>Caer-Leon,</HI> by the Romans called <HI>Isca Silurum,</HI> stands also upon the Uske, a little above <HI>New∣port,</HI> and has a large wooden Bridge over the
<PB N="150" REF="97"/>River. This Town was once, a famous and flourishing City in the time of the Romans, where lay the second Roman Legion called <HI>Augusta,</HI> to keep the <HI>Silures</HI> in aw. The Ru∣ins of its stately Buildings, Palaces, Temples, Theaters, together with the Water-pipes, Vaults, Hot-Houses, Altars, and Roman Coyns, often digged up here, do sufficiently evidence its former Antiquity and Greatness. Here King Arthur kept his Court; and in this City was a famous School or Colledge, to learn Astronomy, and other Arts. As for its pre∣sent State, the Town is pretty large, and the Houses for the generality built of Stone. It has yet the Ruins of a Castle standing.</P>
<P>To conclude, this County (formerly the Habitation of the <HI>Silures</HI>) is in the Welch Diocese of <HI>Llandaff.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the two Knights of the Shire, there's but one Member elected to serve in parliament, and that's out of <HI>Monmouth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Norfolk.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NORFOLK,</HI> a Maritime County of a large extent, is bounded <HI>Eastward</HI> and <HI>North∣ward</HI> with the German Ocean; <HI>Westward,</HI> with the River Ouse, which severs it from the County's of Lincoln and Cambridge; <HI>South∣ward,</HI> with the little Ouse and the Waveney, which part it from Suffolk. Thus <HI>Norfolk,</HI> what with the Sea, and what with the Ri∣vers, is so incompassed with Waters, that it wants very little of being an Islland of it felf.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, 50 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, a∣bout 35. The Whole divided into 31 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 660 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 31 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI> Which is an Argument of its Populousness.</P>
<PB N="151" REF="97"/>
<P>Here the Air is sharp and piercing, espe∣cially near the Sea, and in the Champain Part; which occasions a later Spring and Harvest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> in many Places, but chiefly along the Sea-Coast, which is a Champain Coun∣try, affords plenty of Corn. The Heaths feed a World of Sheep, and breed abundance of Conies. And the Woodland Part serves for Grazing of Cattel, yet not without Corn∣ground.</P>
<P>The Sea, and the Rivers besides that glide through this Country, strive as it were to fur∣nish it with their plenty of F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh. And, among these (besides those above-named, viz. the two <HI>Ouses,</HI> and the <HI>Waveney,</HI>) there are two of chief note, called the <HI>Yare,</HI> and the <HI>Thryn.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Yare,</HI> particularly noted for its great plenty of a certain Fish called <HI>Ruff,</HI> whose body is all Prickled over; the tail and fins spotted with black Specks. This Fish eats tender and short as a Perch, and is counted a wholsom Fish. It delights in sandy Places, and is rarely seen in any other River. One Thing is observable of it, that, when the Fish is angry, the fins stand up stiff; and, after its Anger is over, they fall flat a∣gain.</P>
<P>In short, the Soil of this Country, ac∣cording to the Variety of Places, is of dif∣ferent nature. In some Parts it is fat, rank, and full of moisture; in others, very light and sandy. Yet so, that one contributing to the other, and the Sea giving help to both, it is a very plentiful Country for Corn, Sheep, and Fish.</P>

<P><HI>Norwich,</HI> the chief Place hereof, and a Bishops See, bears from London North-East and by North, and is distant therefrom 90 miles, thus.

<P>A City seated on the River <HI>Yare,</HI> which runs thence to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and over which it has several Bridges.</P>
<P>It was formerly the Seat of the <HI>East-An∣gles,</HI> and then a Place of great splendour. But it has since undergone so many Calamities, by Sword and Famine, by Fire and Pestilence, that it is much it should prove to this day, a fair, large, populous, and well frequented City. Insomuch that it ly's out a Mile and a half in length, and half as much in breadth, containing in that Circuit about 20 Parishes; well walled about, with several Turrets, and 12 Gates for entrance, but not without much waste Ground within it.</P>
<P>Its chief Buildings are the Cathedral, beauti∣fied with a lofty Spire; then the Bishops and the Duke of Norfolk's Pallaces, the Market-House, the Cross, and the House of Correction made of free Stone, and so well cemented that no Mortar is seen. Here is also an Hospital, where 100 poor Men and Women are main∣tained; and the Ruins of an ancient Castle, of the Saxons building. In short, here is so pleasant an Intermixture of the Houses with Trees, that it may not improperly be called an Orchard in a City, or a City in an Orchard; the populousness of a City, and the pleasure of the Country meeting here together. Of
<PB N="153" REF="98"/>some Note besides, for giving the Title of Earl to his Grace the Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Arundel, Surrey, and Norwich.</P>
<P>Finally, this City do's injoy a great Trade, but chiefly for its Stuffs, Stockings, and other Manufactures here made; for the learning of which it is beholding to the Dutch that came to inhabit here.

<P>Besides <HI>Southwold,</HI> and <HI>Winfield,</HI> two new Markets; and <HI>Hickling,</HI> whose Market-Days I am ignorant of.</P>

<PB N="154" REF="99"/>is called the <HI>Washes.</HI> Watered besides by two little Rivers, that fall there into the Ouse, which are passed over by about 15 Bridges. A Town of good antiquity, large, and well built, containing 3 Parish-Churches; and for its Defence, incompassed with a Wall, and a good Ditch. Well Inhabited by Mer∣chants and Tradesmen, who drive a conside∣rable Trade, and the more by reason of its commodious Haven. Yet it is much eclipsed in its Trade, to what it was formerly, be∣cause of the stoppage of a Sluce upon the Ouse, which do's so obstruct the Current of salt Water, that the River is scarce navigable to Cambridge.</P>
<P>Nigh unto this Town, on the other side of the Ouse, is a little Marsh Country, called <HI>Marsh-Land,</HI> very subject to the Inundations of the Sea, and therefore very moist and aguish. But, in recompence, its Soil is exceeding fat, and feed abundance of Cattel. In this Marsh are seated several Towns, but so destitute of fresh Water for houshold Use, that many of 'em are fain to get a supply thereof at 4 miles distance.</P>
<P>About 3 miles from <HI>Lyn,</HI> towards the Sea, stands a decayed Town called <HI>Castle-Rising.</HI> Its Decay occasioned by its Haven's being many years since choakt up with Sands, where∣by 'tis become useless. Which has done a Kindness to <HI>Lyn.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yarmouth,</HI> the best Harbour in all this County, and the Key of this Coast, is seated at the Mouth of the River Yare, from whence it is called Yarmouth. A Town of good Strength as well by Nature as Art, well built, and pretty large; and yet it has but one Church, which is beautify'd with a lofty Spire. The
<PB N="155" REF="99"/>same is well inhabited, and much resorted unto by Seamen; affording a ready Passage to Holland, and being a frequent Shelter to the New-castle Fleets, when distressed by Wea∣ther. Of special note besides, for Herring∣fishing, in the Seas adjacent, in the Month of September. Which draws a great Concourse of People hither, and makes the Town much richer all the Year after. Lastly, 'tis dig∣nified with the Title of Earl, in the person of the Right Honourable <HI>William Paston,</HI> the present Earl of Yarmouth.</P>
<P><HI>Thetford</HI> is an Inland Town, situate on the Confluence of the Thet and the little Ouse, over wich it has a Bridge leading to Suffolk. A Place of great Antiquity, built out of the Ruins of the ancient City <HI>Sitomagus,</HI> which was destroyed by the merciless Danes. The Bi∣shop's See of the East Angles was from North-Elmham removed hither, and from hence to Norwich. It is not very well Inhabited, to what it has been. However this is the Town, where the Lent-Assizes for the Coun∣ty are usually kept.</P>
<P><HI>Herling,</HI> and <HI>New Buckenham,</HI> ly not far from Thetford, to the Eastward; <HI>Diss,</HI> and <HI>Harleston,</HI> on the Waveney; <HI>Watton, Windham, Hingham, Swafham,</HI> and <HI>East-Derham,</HI> do not ly far asunder, about the middle of the Coun∣ty. Further to the Northward you will find <HI>Repeham, Caston, Fakenham, Walsingham, Holt, Ale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ham, Worsted, North Walsham,</HI> and <HI>Hickling</HI> this last in a Marsh-Ground, not far from the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Downham</HI> is upon the Ouse, over which it has a Bridge, leading into Cambridgeshire. <HI>Snetham,</HI> North of <HI>Lyn,</HI> is seated on a bivuler, not far from the Sea. <HI>Burnham-Market,</HI> and <HI>Cromere,</HI> are two Sea-Towns in the North
<PB N="156" REF="100"/>Parts of the County. Between which is <HI>Clay,</HI> another Sea-Town, on three sides incompassed with Waters, and once a Market Town, but now discontinued. And near it <HI>Wayborn-hope,</HI> a noted Place amongst Seamen; as is <HI>Win∣terton Ness,</HI> or <HI>Point,</HI> in the East, which is very coldly seated. And yet it is observed, that the Ground about <HI>Winterton</HI> is one of the richest and fattest in England.</P>
<P>Among the aforesaid Towns, <HI>Walsingham</HI> was formerly renowned, as for its Colledge of Ca∣nons, so for the continual Concourse of Pil∣grims to this Place. Who came hither to pay their Superstitious Devotion to the Blessed Vir∣gin, at a Chappel near the two Wells called to this day the <HI>Virgin Mary's Wells.</HI> It was also a Place of note, for its good Saffron.</P>
<P>Near Burnham-Market, within 2 Miles from it to the Westward, is a small Country-Town, called <HI>Brancaster,</HI> the Ruins of an ancient Town known by the Name of <HI>Branodunum.</HI> Seated near the Sea-shore, and a Place of good account in the time of the Romans, who kept here a Garrison.</P>
<P>Not far from Hickling, in the North-East Parts, is the ancient decay'd <HI>Abbey of St. Bennet's in the Holme,</HI> built by the Danish King Ca∣nute. An Abbey so fortified afterwards by its Monks with Walls and Bulwarks, that it seemed rather a Castle than a Cloyster; and yet was betrayed by a Monk to William the Conqueror. The Bishop of Norwich re∣tains to this Day the Title of Lord Abbot of St. Bennets. And it is observable, that hereabouts both Cockles and Perwinkles are digged out of the Ground.</P>
<PB N="157" REF="100"/>
<P>Lastly, this County (which is the largest in England next to Yorkshire, but much more populous) was Part of the Kingdom of the East-Angles, in the time of the Heptarchy; and its Inhabitants, part of the <HI>Iceni,</HI> as the Romans called them.</P>
<P>It is observed of the People in this Coun∣ty, that they are notably industrious for Plough and Manufactures, insomuch that one shall hardly see a Beggar throughout all the Coun∣try. And yet (which one would wonder at) they are notable Wranglers, and generally so well versed in the Quirks of the Law, that they create more work for the Assizes than almost all the Circuit else. Accordingly Nor∣folk is the County, which commonly yields the best Breed of Lawyers, and has furnished the Courts of Justice with many an emiment Man in the Laws of England. But a great Antiquary has made another material Obser∣vation, That in this County are a hundred Families of ancient Gentry, that never were attainted of high Treason. Which if it be true, the Gentry here have had better fortune than the Dukes, Dutchesses, and Earls of Nor∣folk.</P>
<P>His Grace, <HI>Henry Howard,</HI> the present Duke of Norfolk, derives his Title from his noble Ancestor <HI>John-Lord Howard,</HI> created Duke of Norfolk by King Edward IV. Anno 1483, and descended from the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> Dutchess of Norfolk, Daughter of <HI>Tho. de Brotherton,</HI> Earl of Norfolk, first Son of King Ed∣ward I.</P>
<P>Out of this County are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, ten Members of Parliament. Viz. Two out of each of these following Places, <HI>Norwich, Kings I yn, Yar∣mouth, Thetford,</HI> and <HI>Castle-rising.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Northamp∣tonshire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NORTHAMPTONSHIRE,</HI> an In∣land County, is bounded <HI>on the East</HI> with the Counties of Cambridge, Huntington, Bed∣ford, and Buckingham; <HI>on the West,</HI> with Rut∣land, Leicestershire, and Warwickshire; <HI>North∣ward,</HI> with the Counties of Lincoln, Rutland, and Leicester; <HI>Southward,</HI> with Buckingham∣shire, and Oxfordshire.</P>
<P>This County, being long, but narrow, runs in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, ahout 50 miles; and in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, but half. The Whole divided into 20 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 326 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 13 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>Here the <HI>Air</HI> is temperate and health∣full; the <HI>Soil</HI> as rich, either for Corn or Grass, as in any Place in England. And the Inha∣bitants find such a Profit here by Grazing and Tillage, that they improve the Ground every where. Insomuch that it is said, there is less waste Ground in this County than in any other.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> and other fresh Streams, 'tis as well watered as most Counties are. Its principal Rivers are the <HI>Nen</HI> and the <HI>Weland,</HI> both having their Rise here; besides the <HI>Ouse,</HI> which rises in the South Parts, near Bucking, hamshire.</P>
<P>A further Proof of the excellency of this County might be fetched from its Populousness. For it is so garnished with Towns, that in many Places 20 or 30 Steeples present themselves at one view. And considering its Extent, 'tis said to be honoured with the Seats of as many (if not more) of the Nobility and Gentry, as any County in the Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Northampton,</HI> the chief Place hereof, ly's North-West from London, and (by common Computation) is distant from it 54 miles, thus, From London to <HI>Barnet,</HI> 10; thence to <HI>St. Al∣lans,</HI>

<P>A Town pleasantly seated on the Banks of the River <HI>Nen,</HI> where it meets with two Ri∣vulets, one from the North, the other from the South. And, though it has suffered much by the sore hand of the Dane, and other Calamities (and of late particularly by the dreadfull Fire which buried it all in Ashes in September 1675) yet it has raised it self again more glorious than before. So that for Circuit and Beauty it may at this time be ranked with many Ci∣ties. Fortified heretofore with good Walls, and a strong Castle; and seated in so good an Air, that once the Students of Cambridge had a mind to remove their University hither. Here the Inhabitants drive a considerable Trade, especially of Leather; and its Market, which is on Saturdays, is well served with Provisions. This Town is the Place where the County-Goal, and the Assizes are kept. Of special note, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>George Compton,</HI> the present Earl of Northampton. Devolved to him from his noble Ancestor <HI>William,</HI> Lord <HI>Compton,</HI> and Lord President of Wales, Crea∣ted Earl of Northampton by King James I. An∣no 1618.</P>

<P>Among which <HI>Peterborough</HI> is seated in a Nook (or Angle) of the County, bordering upon Cambridgeshire, and Huntingtonshire, where formerly had been a Gulf or Whirl∣pool of an exceeding depth. 'Tis seated on the River <HI>Nen,</HI> over which it has a Bridge leading into Huntingtonshire. A Town of no great account, but for being a Bishops See, since the Reign of Henry VIII. For, as it is no plausible Place either for health or pleasure, so it stands out of the way for Trade. Yet it shews two handsom Streets, a large Mar∣ket-Place, and a fair Parish Church, besides the Abbey. Which last, from a Monastery founded by Wolpher the Mercian King, is now become a Cathedral. And, from that Monastery dedicated by him to St. Peter. This Town, formerly known by the Name of <HI>Medanshede,</HI> came to be called <HI>Peterburgh,</HI> or <HI>Peterborough.</HI> Dignify<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with the Title of an Earldom in the person of <HI>Henry Mordant,</HI> the present Earl of Peterborough; devolved to him from his Father <HI>John,</HI> Lord Mordant, created Earl of Peterborough by King Charles I. Anno 1627.</P>
<P><HI>Oundle</HI> is pleasantly seated on the Banks of the Nen, over which it has two Bridges. A well built and uniform Town, beautified with a fair Church, a free School, and an Alms∣house.</P>
<P>Nigh unto Oundle Northwards, and upon the same River, stands <HI>Fotheringhay-Castle,</HI> in∣vironed on all sides with pleasant Meadows. Noted for that here Mary, Queen of Scots, was beheaded.</P>
<P><HI>Thrapston, Higham-Ferrers,</HI> and <HI>Wellingborow,</HI> ly all three upon the Nen; the first two on the Eastern, the last on the Western Banks
<PB N="161" REF="102"/>and each of them with a Bridge over the River. <HI>Higham-Ferrers</HI> has a Free-School for the Education of Youth, and an Alms house for the Relief of poor people; and was anciently strengthned with a Castle, whose Ruins are yet to be seen. <HI>Wellingborow,</HI> pleasantly seated upon the Ascent of a Hill, is a large, and well inhabited Town, injoying a good Trade, beau∣tified with a fair Church, and having the Con∣vieniency besides of a Free School.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Rothwell,</HI> or <HI>Rowel,</HI> is <HI>Naseby,</HI> which is said to stand on the highest Ground in England, near which the Avon and the Nen (two considerable Rivers) have their Spring∣heads. A noted Town for the Battel fought here June 14th 1645; where the Kings For∣ces commanded by Prince Rupert were totally routed by General Fairfax.</P>
<P><HI>Towcester,</HI> situate in a Valley, and on the Banks of a small River that empty's it self in the Ouse, is a Place of good Antiquity. Cambden takes it for the ancient <HI>Tripontium,</HI> which took its Name from 3 Bridges; the Roman Port-way (which in many places be∣tween it and Stony-Stratford shews it self) be∣ing cut through by three Streams or Chan∣nels, which the Rivulet there divides it self into. About the Year 917. it was so strong∣ly fortified, as to resist the furious Assaults of the Danes. At present 'tis but a small Town, beautified however with a fine Church.</P>
<P>Near this Place Eastward is <HI>Grafton,</HI> a Road-Town in this part of Northamptonshire, with a fine Park adjoyning to it, and a Mannor∣house of great Antiquity, most part whereof was burnt and pulled down in the long In∣testine War, Anno 1643. Memorable for the
<PB N="162" REF="103"/>Marriage here consummated betwixt Edward IV. and the Lady Grey, the first King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> England since the Conquest that married his Subject. This was the ancient Seat of the Family <HI>de Wideville,</HI> Earls of Rivers. And Richard, the last of the male Line, dying An∣no 1490. did by his Will bequeath it (a∣mongst other Lands) to Thomas Grey, Mar∣quess of Dorset. In which Name it continued till Henry VIII, with whom it was exchanged for other Lands in Leicestershire, and so has ever since continued in the Crown. Of late become of more remark, for giving the Ti∣tle of Duke to his Grace <HI>Henry Fitz-Roy,</HI> cre∣ated Baron of Sudbury, Viscount Ipswich, and Earl of Euston Anno 1672, and Duke of <HI>Grafton</HI> five years after.</P>
<P><HI>Brackley,</HI> a Town of Note when it was in a manner the Staple Town in the County for Wool, is seated near the Spring of the Ouse, upon the edge of the County towards Buckinghamshire. It contains two Parish-Churches, and had formerly a Colledge, now made use of for a Free-School.</P>
<P><HI>Daventry</HI> and <HI>Kettering</HI> are seated, each of 'em upon a Rivulet, that falls into the Nen. The first, a great Road-Town from London to the North-West Counties, and from thence hither.

<HEAD>Northum∣berland,</HEAD>
<P><HI>NORTHƲMBERLAND,</HI> a Mari∣time County, and the furthest North in England, is bounded <HI>on the East</HI> by the German Ocean; <HI>on the West,</HI> by Cumber∣land, and the Cheviot Hills which part it from Scotland; <HI>Northward,</HI> by the River <HI>Twede,</HI> which divides it also from Scotland; and <HI>Southward,</HI> by the Bishoprick of Durham, from which severed in part by the River <HI>Tine.</HI></P>
<P>Its <HI>Form</HI> is triangular, contains in <HI>Length</HI> from North to South about 40 long Miles, and in <HI>Breadth</HI> from East to West (at the broadest) 30. The Whole divided into six <HI>Wards,</HI> wherein 460 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and but 6 <HI>Mar∣ket-Towns.</HI></P>
<PB N="164" REF="104"/>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> of this County is sharp and piercing in Winter, and sometimes troubled with deep Snows and pinching Frosts, sutable to its Cli∣mate. But yet 'tis nothing near so sharp as the People. And by my late Experi∣ence, here wet Weather is not so sensible and searching, as it is in Middlesex. 'Tis possible the warm Breaths that continually come out of its numberless Colepits helps, with the Vapours of the Sea, to take off the rawness of a cold dampish Air.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Soil,</HI> as this County is nearly re∣lated to Scotland, so it is one of the worst Counties in England; being for the most part rough and hilly, and hard to be manured. Yet in some Parts, chiefly towards the Sea, it is fertile enough. But the greatest Ri∣ches of this Country lies in the Bowels of the Earth, full of Coal-mines. Which supply with Coals, not only this Country (where that Fewel is always bought at very easy rates) but a good Part of England be∣sides; and London particularly, for whose Use many hundred Sail of Ships have yearly from hence their Loading.</P>
<P>The Coal-Pits, made use of to get up this Treasure, are all square, commonly 7 or 8 foot in diameter, and timbered from top to bottom; some 30, some 40, more or less, but few above 50 fadoms deep. A great Depth for Workmen, to go and rake a Livelyhood. And yet here is a Legion of such Men, bred and born to it, that spend most of their Life in this Land of Darkness; in continual Danger (besides that of the Rope) of being crushed below by a <HI>Thrust,</HI> sometimes in Danger of Water, and in some places of Fire.</P>
<PB N="165" REF="104"/>
<P>The Way to go down these Pits, and to come up, is by the help of a Rope; one end whereof being made into a Loop, the Work∣man gets a Leg and Knee into it, as far as the very Hip. Thus hugging the Rope with one Arm, his Life wrapt up with it, down he goes, while the Rope turns about an En∣gine made for that purpose. If the Rope fails, as sometimes it does through Careles∣ness, there's an end of the Man and of the Conveyance.</P>
<P>By a <HI>Thrust</HI> is meant the fall of some Earth, or great Stones, whereby 'tis the ill fate of some to be crushed; as it is of others to be drowned by a sudden Irruption of Waters, from an old Waste, or otherwise.</P>
<P>But some Pits at Sunderland, in the Bishop∣rick of Durham, are subject besides to <HI>Fire-Damps.</HI> So they call an Inflammation of the Air in those subterraneous Parts, which be∣ing more than ordinary affected with sulphu∣rous matter, are sometimes apt to catch fire, and then all go's to wrack. It breaks out like a Thunder-bolt, carries all away with it higher than the Pits Mouth, and that with a dismal noise, as it were with a crack of Thun∣der. In this Case one might compare the inflamed Sulphur to Gun-powder, the Coal∣pit to a great Gun, and what it brings up with it to Bullets, it comes up with such a force. But, when this happens, the Work∣men foresee it, by their Candles burning blue and blazing more than ordinary. Where∣upon they lay themselves flat upon the Ground, and let the Meteor work it self a∣bove it.</P>
<PB N="166" REF="105"/>
<P>But this is too deep a piece of Geography, for me to insist upon. I leave it therefore to those Men of deep reaches who live upon the Spot; in order first to take a View of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> the chief Place of this County.</P>
<P><HI>Newcastel,</HI> for distinctions sake called <HI>New∣castel upon Tine,</HI> to difference it from another Town of that Name in Staffordshire, bears from London North-by-West, and is reckoned to be distant from it 212 miles. Viz. 200 from London to <HI>Durham,</HI> for the particulars whereof I refer you to my Description of <HI>Dur∣ham;</HI> and 12 more from Durham to <HI>New∣castle.</HI></P>
<P>This Town is seated on the North-Bank of the River <HI>Tine,</HI> about 7 miles from its fall into the Sea. Over the River it has a fair Stone-Bridge leading to Gateshead in the Bi∣shoprick of Durham, with an Iron-Gate upon it, which parts the two Counties. It stands high and low, part upon a steep Hill, and part in the bottom on't near the River. The Streets upon the Ascent are so very steep, that they stand like so many Ladders. And yet both Men and Horses are so used to 'em, that they make little of it, either with or without a Load. The Houses are most of Stone, some Timber, and a few Brick-houses. In short, it is a Place of that extent as to contain four large Parishes, with as many Churches. The Whole incompassed with a Wall, and fortified with a Castle, but neg∣lected, and going to ruin. Built by Robert, Son to William the Conquerour; from whence this Town, formerly called <HI>Monk-Chester,</HI> took the Name of <HI>Newcastle,</HI></P>
<PB N="167" REF="105"/>
<P>Among the other publick Buildings of this Place, the Key next to the River, the Town-House <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard by it, the Custom-house upon Sandy-Hill, and S. Nicholas Church in the midst of the Town, are the most Remarkable. Ships of good Burden come up to the very Key as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar as the Bridge; though the Newcastle-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet seldom comes higher than <HI>Sheales,</HI> near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he River's Mouth. Under the Town-house (which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no mean Structure) is the Exchange, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeting Place for Merchants. Before this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse, in the Market-Place, stood lately a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew brazen Statue, the Image of the late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing James on horseback. Which, soon after is Abdication, was suddenly pulled down by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Forces then quartered in Town; to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat grief of many devout Jacobites in those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arts, who reverently paid to the Image the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onour they retained for the Original. S. Ni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olas Church stands very lofty on the top of Hill, and looks more like a Cathedral than Parish Church, with a fair Steeple of curious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rchitecture.</P>
<P>But <HI>Newcastle</HI> do's not glory so much in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, as it do's in the great Trade it drives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth by Sea and Land for all Commodities; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>somuch that one may well call it the <HI>Bristol</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the North, it being the wealthiest, as it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most trading Place in the whole Northern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ract.</P>
<P>'Tis true nothing has made it thrive so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch as the Coal-Trade, being surrounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it is) with Coal-Mines, and blessed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Conveniency of a navigable River for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Transportation of so necessary and usefull Commodity. For the Carrying on of this
<PB N="168" REF="106"/>Trade they have such Priviledges, as might seem to some people exorbitant. No Owner of Coals can load his Ship with his own Com∣modity, but it must be done by a Member of a Company they have for that purpose, called the Company of <HI>Fitters;</HI> and every <HI>Fitter</HI> has six pence allowed him for every Newcastle Chaldron that go's out, which makes up near upon two of London Measure. The Town moreover takes 3 pence a Chaldron, as a Duty; besides 12 pence a Chaldron to the King, paid at the Custom-house.</P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>Newcastle</HI> is a County of it self, that is, has the Priviledge of governing it self independently from the rest of the Coun∣ty.</P>
<P>Of some note besides for giving the Title of Duke to his Grace <HI>Henry Cavendish,</HI> the present Duke of Newcastle. Whose Father, <HI>William Cavendish,</HI> was created first <HI>Earl,</HI> af∣terwards <HI>Marquess</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> by King Charles the first; and in the Year 1664. <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> Earl of <HI>Ogle,</HI> &amp;c. by Charles II.</P>

<P><HI>Barwick</HI> is seated at the mouth of the River Twede, over which it has a fair Bridge, sup∣ported
<PB N="169" REF="106"/>by no less than 14 or 15 Arches. But as it stands on the North side of the River, by the Bounds of Northumberland, it ought rather to be counted in Scotland than En∣gland. And, because it has been in the hands of the English from the Reign of Edward IV, therefore in all Acts of Parliament, and Royal Proclamations, wherein this Town is con∣cerned, <HI>Barwick upon Twede</HI> is always named by it self, as a distinct Part of this Realm, and of Northumberland by consequence. How∣ever, as it is so near a Neighbour to this County, I am unwilling to deviate from the Method of all Geographers, whose way is to bring it under this Head, as if it were a part of Northumberland.</P>
<P>In short, <HI>Barwick,</HI> by its Situation, is a Place of good Strength, being almost surrounded with Water, what with the Sea, and what with the River. But it is fortified besides with good Walls and a Castle, besides other Forti∣fications. The Occasion of it was its being a Frontire-Town, sometimes possessed by the Scots, and sometimes by the English, before these two Nations came to be united under one Head. So that, upon the least Rupture, this Town was sure to undergo the first brunts of the War. It is large and populous, and the Houses well built; injoying a good Trade, especially for Corn and Salmon. Here one may have a good Salmon for 12 pence.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Barwick</HI> is, like Newcastel, a Coun∣ty of it self. Dignified also with the Title of a Dukedom, and that by the late King James, in the person of <HI>James Fitz-James,</HI> the present Duke of Barwick, his natural Son, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inked with him in his Misfortunes.</P>
<PB N="170" REF="107"/>
<P><HI>Alnwick,</HI> so called from the River <HI>Alne</HI> upon which it is seated, about 8 miles from the Sea, is an indifferent good Town. Once strengthened with a great Castle, which is now something ruinous. However a noted Place, for the Battel fought here between the En∣glish and the Scots, in the Reign of Henry II; where William, King of Scots, was taken Prisoner.</P>
<P><HI>Hexam</HI> is situate West of Newcastel, on the South-side of the River <HI>Tine.</HI> Once a Bishop∣rick, in the Infancy of the Saxon Church; the Bishop whereof called <HI>Episcopus Hagulstadiensis,</HI> according to Beda. S. Eata, the fifth Bishop of Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, was the first Bishop of this Place. Succeeded by nine o∣thers, till by the fury and rapine of the Danes it discontinued, the Jurisdiction of it being added to the See of York. But in the Reign of Henry VIII. it was taken from that Arch∣bishoprick, and by Authority of Parliament united to the County of Northumberland, whereby it became annexed to the Bishoprick of Durham. Here was a most stately Church, said to surpass most Minsters in England, before a great part thereof was pulled down by the Scots.</P>
<P><HI>Morpeth,</HI> a goodly Town, is situate on the River <HI>Wensbeck,</HI> and fortified with a Castle Its Market is esteemed the best in the County for Provisions and living Cattel, which from hence are dispersed to divers Parts of the Kingdom. The Town of some note besides, for giving the Title of Viscount to the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Carlisle.</P>
<P>Some miles South-west from it, near a Town called <HI>Belsey,</HI> on the River <HI>Pont,</HI> stands <HI>Ogle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Castle,</HI> formerly belonging to the Barons <HI>Ogle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="171" REF="107"/>and now to the Duke of Newcastle, from hence stiled Earl of Ogle.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Weller,</HI> 'tis but a small Town, seated on the side of a Hill, near the Banks of the River Till, which runs Northward into the Twede. But its Market is great for Corn, and other Provisions.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="associated places">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>Islands</HI> along the Sea-Coast of <HI>Northumberland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Along the Coast of this Country you will find 3 principal Islands, as you go from South to North; viz. <HI>Cocket, Farn,</HI> and <HI>Holy I∣sland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cocket</HI> is but a small Island, lying not far from Wetherington Castle.</P>
<P><HI>Farne Island,</HI> something bigger, lies North from Cocket, 2 miles from Bamburg Castle. North-East of which lie six smaller Islands, hardly worth the naming.</P>
<P><HI>Holy Island,</HI> the biggest of the three, and yet of no great extent, is not far from Bar∣wick. This Island, being in shape not un∣like a Wedge, runs out with a Neck of Land towards Northumberland. And this is it which formerly was known by the Name of <HI>Lindis∣farne,</HI> in the dawning of Christianity among the Northumbers made a Bishops See by <HI>S. Aidan,</HI> one of the first Apostles of these Parts. Selected for that Dignity by that holy Man, for the Solitude and Privacy of it, which made it thought more fit and proper for Devotion. Till at last, by the religious Lives of so ma∣ny pious Bishops, Monks, and others of the Clergy as did inhabit here, it got the Name of <HI>Holy Island.</HI> And here the See continued 353 years, that, is from the Year 637 to 990,
<PB N="172" REF="108"/>under 22 Bishops, hence called Bishops of <HI>Lindisfarne.</HI> From whence the See was remov∣ed to Durham, the Insolencies of the Danes (who then terribly raged on these Coasts) com∣pelling these religious Men to forsake their Solitude.</P>
<P>The Air of this Island is so unhealth∣full, and the Soil ungratefull, that it is but thinly peopled. Fish and Fowl is the best Accommodation of it. So that here is but one Town with a Church and Castle; un∣der which is a good Haven, defended by a Block-house.</P>
<P>In short, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and its Inha∣bitants part of the <HI>Ottadini,</HI> as the Romans caded them) is now in the Diocese of <HI>Dur∣ham.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, six Members of Parliament. Viz. 2 by <HI>Newcastle,</HI> 2 by <HI>Morpeth,</HI> and 2 more by <HI>Barwick.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, this County is noted for the Title of Duke and Earl it has given to several no∣ble Personages, but with frequent Interrup∣tions. As for the Title of Duke, I find but one that has injoy'd it, till of late, viz. <HI>John Dudley,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and Lord Admiral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> beheaded by Quee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mary. Put that of Earl has gone through several Changes, and different Families. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Piercies</HI> are those who have injoy'd it the long est of any, and yet not without some Inter∣ruption too. The first of 'em that had the Title conferred upon him was <HI>Henry Piercy</HI> Lord Constable, who took possession of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Anno 1377. under the Reign of Richard II.
<PB N="173" REF="108"/>Three of his Name and Family injoy'd it after him, before <HI>John Nevil,</HI> Lord <HI>Montague,</HI> was advanced to this Honour by King Edward II; who, after six years, resigned it to <HI>Henry Piercy,</HI> that had been dispossessed of it. An∣other <HI>Henry Piercy</HI> injoy'd it after him, who died in the Year 1527. And 24 years after his Death, the foresaid <HI>John Dudley,</HI> Earl of Warwick, was by Edward VI. created Duke of Northumberland, viz. Anno 1551. Six Years after this the Title of Earl returned to the <HI>Piercies,</HI> in the person of <HI>Thomas,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> In which Family it has continued ever since, till the Year 1670, when <HI>Joceline Piercy</HI> died at Turin in Italy, without Issue male. At present we have a Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> his Grace <HI>George Fitz-Roy,</HI> third Son to the Dutchess of <HI>Cleveland;</HI> who in the Year 1674. was created by King Charles II. Baron of <HI>Pontefract,</HI> Viscount <HI>Fal∣mouth,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>

<P><HI>NOTTINGHAMSHIRE,</HI> an Inland County, is bounded <HI>Eastward</HI> with Lincoln∣shire, from which it is separated a good way by the River Trent; <HI>Westward,</HI> with Derby∣shire, and some part of Yorkshire; <HI>North∣ward,</HI> with Yorkshire; and <HI>Southward,</HI> with Leicestershire.</P>
<P>It is of an oval Form, doubling in length twice its breadth.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, is about 40 miles; the <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, 20. The Whole divided into 8 <HI>Wapentakes</HI> or <HI>Hundreds,</HI> 168 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 9 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Soil</HI> of this County, part of it is Clay-Ground, part sandy Ground, and the rest Woody. The South East Part, be∣ing
<PB N="174" REF="109"/>watered by the Trent and small Rivers that fall into it, is the most fruitfull; and this is the Clay Part. The Western, where the Forest of Shirwood is, (so famous for <HI>Robin-Hood,</HI> and his Companions) is stocked not only with Wood, but Pit-Coal; well served besides with Game.</P>
<P>Besides the River <HI>Trent,</HI> here are several small Streams whereby this Country is watered. Among which the <HI>Iddie,</HI> which empty's it self Northward into the Dun, is the most con∣siderable.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Air,</HI> 'tis counted as good here, especially in the sandy Parts, as any where else in England.</P>
<P><HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Shire-Town, from whence the whole County takes its Denomination, is 94 miles from London, to the North-West. Viz. from London to <HI>Leicester,</HI> 78 miles, the Particulars whereof you may see in Leicester∣shire; from thence to <HI>Loughborow</HI> 8; and to <HI>Nottingham,</HI> 8 more.</P>
<P>'Tis seated about a mile on the North-side of the River Trent, upon a Hill, which over∣looks it. Over this River it has a fair Stone∣bridge, and another over the <HI>Lean</HI> a small River; besides two other Bridges over two Ponds, called the <HI>Cheney Bridges.</HI> The Town is large, containing 3 Parish Churches; for Buildings, fair Streets, and a spacious Market-Place, not yielding to many Cities. But of most fame for its Castle, which for strength, stateliness, and prospect, did formerly challenge the precedency of most Castles in England. Honoured besides with the Title of an Earl∣dom, at this time injoy'd by the Right Ho∣nourable <HI>Daniel Finch,</HI> Earl of Nottingham, and principal Secretary of State. Descended
<PB N="175" REF="109"/>to him from his Father <HI>Heneage Finch,</HI> Lord High Chancellour of England in the Reign of King Charles II, and by him created Earl of Nottingham, Baron Finch of Daventry, &amp;c. Which hapned soon after the Death of the Lord <HI>Charles Howard,</HI> who dying without Issue male was the last of that Family which injoy'd that Title. In short, Nottingham is a Town well inhabited and frequented, this being the Place where the County-Goal is, and where the Assizes are held; and injoy's as good a Trade, as most Inland Towns. For Provisions it has 3 Markets a Week, Wednes∣days, Fridays, and Saturdays, this last the most considerable.</P>

<P><HI>Newark,</HI> the Place of most note in this County next to Nottingham, ly's in the high Road to York, on the Banks of the River Trent, where it divides it self into two Branches, and makes up an Island before the Town.

'Tis true it gives the Title of Viscount to the Earl of <HI>Kingston.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mansfield</HI> and <HI>Worksop</HI> are both in the Fo∣rest of Sherwood.

<P>The Air of this County is mightily com∣mended for its sweetness and temperateness, as the <HI>Soil</HI> is for its fruitfulness. Both which make this Country so much inhabited as it is by Gentry.

<P>Among which <HI>Burford,</HI> seated on an Ascent near the River <HI>Windrush</HI> in the West of Oxfordshire, is a Town of good Antiquity. Remarkable heretofore for a great Battle fought near it about the Year 750. between Cuthbert, a Tri∣butary King of the West-Saxons, and Ethel∣bald the Mercian King, whose insupportable Exactions Cuthbert could not indure. In this Fight Cuthbert had the fortune to overthrow the Mercian King, and to win his Banner, wherein was depicted a golden Dragon. The Memory whereof has continued for several Ages in the Custom used here of making a Dragon yearly, and carrying it about the Town in great Jollity on Midsummer Eve, with the addition of a Giant to it. At pre∣sent <HI>Burford</HI> is a famons Place for Saddles; and something advantaged besides by the neigh∣bouring Downs, much resorted unto by the Gentry for Horse races. Of late become of further note, by giving the Title of Earl to the Duke of St. Albans.</P>
<P><HI>Woodstock,</HI> a well-compacted Borough-Town, is pleasantly seated near a small River, on a rising Ground, with a large Park near it, surrounded with a Wall, and said to be the first inclosed Park. In which was once a Royal House, called <HI>Woodstock Bower,</HI> built by King Henry I, and inlarged by Henry II, but demo∣lished
<PB N="179" REF="111"/>in the long Civil Wars. In this House was born Edward the black Prince; and in the Labyrinth that belonged to it the beau∣tifull Rosamond, King Henry the Second's Mi∣stress, catched her Death, by the poysonous Dose the jealous Queen forced upon her. Where∣upon she was interred at a Nunnery called <HI>Godstow,</HI> not far from this Town, with this La∣tin Epitaph,
<Q><L>Hàc jacet in Tumbâ Rosa Mundi non Rosa munda,</L>
<L>Non redolet, sed olet, quae redolere solet.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Tame,</HI> so called from the River of that Name, which with its Branches does almost incom∣pass it, is a pretty large Town, having one spacious Street, and in the midst of it the Market-Place. Over the River is a Bridge, which leads to Buckinghamshire, so near this Town is seated to its Borders. Here is a famous Free School, with a small Hospital, founded by the Lord Williams of Tame, and its Market is eminent chiefly for the buying of Cattle, which makes it much frequented by Grasiers and Butchers from London and other Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Bampton,</HI> near the <HI>Isis,</HI> is a large Town, within a larger Parish, having several Places besides belonging to it. It has a Chappel of Ease, to which belong 3 Vicars, with a li∣beral Maintenance.</P>
<P><HI>Banbury,</HI> for wealth and beauty the second Town in this County, is seated in a Flat, on the River <HI>Cherwell.</HI> Memorable for a great Battle sought near it between the two Hou∣ses of York and Lancaster, which proved so favourable to the Lancastrians, that Edward the Pretender to the Crown was taken Priso∣ner
<PB N="180" REF="112"/>in it. This Town also has been digni∣fy'd with the Title of an Earldom, first in the person of <HI>William Lord Knolles,</HI> created Earl of Banbury, Anno 1626; and continued in his Son▪ <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the late Earl of <HI>Banbury.</HI> Lastly, in this Town is made a delicate sort of Cheese, which has added something to its Fame.</P>
<P><HI>Henley</HI> stands upon the Thames, over which it has a fair Bridge. 'Tis a large Town Cor∣porate, driving a great Trade of Malt. And its Market is so considerable for Corn, and Barley especially, that there is often sold in one day about 300 Cart-load of Barley for the Malt-Trade of it. The Barge-Men besides of Henley, which make up a good Part of its Inhabitants, gain a good Livelyhood by trans∣porting of Malt, Wood, and other Goods to London. From whence they bring in return such Commodities as they and the Inhabitants of the neighbouring Towns stand in need of.</P>
<P><HI>Witney,</HI> seated on the Banks of the River Windrush, and not far from Burford, is a large stragling Town. Most of whose Inha∣bitants get a Livelihood by spinning and card∣ing for Blankets and Rugs, whereof the Clo∣thiers here drive a good Trade. Here is a Free School for the Education of Youth, with a fine Library.</P>
<P>Not far from this Town, and near Eni∣sham, is a Monument of huge and unwrought Stone, called <HI>Roll-rich-Stones,</HI> set in a circular Compass not unlike those of <HI>Stonehinge,</HI> and sup∣posed to be there erected, in memory of some great Victory. In this Tract of Ground is a Forest of a large extent, called <HI>Whitwood-Forest.</HI></P>

<P>At the Confluence of the Thame and Isis stands <HI>Dorcester.</HI> Which indeed is no Market-Town; but, as it is seated on the Road, is well frequented, and accommodated with Inns. A Town formerly of more note than now it is; when Berinus, Apostle of the West Sax∣ons, had his Episcopal See here, which was afterwards removed to Lincoln. However it is graced to this day with a very large and fair Church.</P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> (now in the Dio∣cese of Oxford) was Part of the ancient King∣dom of <HI>Mercia.</HI> And its Inhabitants, toge∣ther with those of Glocestershire, were known a mong the old Romans by the Name of <HI>Dobuni.</HI></P>

<P>Called <HI>Okeham,</HI> as some would have it, from the plenty of Oaks that grow in its Neigh∣bourhood; and seated in a rich and pleasant Valley, called the Vale of Catmoss. Its Buid∣ings are indifferent good, especially the Church, the Free-School, and the Hospital. The Ca∣stle, where the Assizes are held, is a Place of more antiquity than beauty.

<P>This Town has an ancient Priviledge be∣longing to its Royalty; which is, if any No∣ble-man enter within its Precinct on Horse∣back, he forfeits a Shoe from his Horse, un∣less he redeem it by Mony.

<P>As for fresh Streams, no County is better watered than this. For, besides the <HI>Severn,</HI> which in its crooked and winding Course, cuts the Shire in the midst, here are the <HI>Roden,</HI> the <HI>Terne, Clum, Rea,</HI> and <HI>Teme.</HI> In all which are plenty of fresh-Water Fish.</P>
<P>And, as this County is inferiour to none about it, either for delight or penty; So for the Number of Towns and Castles, standing exceeding thick on every side (as having formerly been a Frontier-County to∣wards Wales) it is far above 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> the chief Place hereof, bears from London North-West and by West, and is distant therefrom 124 miles, thus. Viz. From London to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> 20; and to <HI>Dun∣stable,</HI> 10 more; thence to <HI>Stony-Stratford,</HI> 14; to <HI>Towcester,</HI> 6; and to <HI>Daventry,</HI> 10 more; from thence to <HI>Covenrry,</HI> 14; and to <HI>Ber∣mingham,</HI> 14 more; then to <HI>Dudley,</HI> 8; to <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> 12 more; from Bridgenorth to <HI>Wenlock,</HI> 6; and from thence to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> 10.</P>
<P>'Tis seated in the very midst (or Cen∣ter as it were) of the County, on a pleasant Ascent, and on the Banks of the Severn, not far from the Place where stood <HI>Ʋriconium,</HI> out of whose Ruins 'tis said to be raised. The
<PB N="185" REF="114"/>Severn do's almost incompass it round; and that Part of it which is not fenced with it is fortified with a strong Castle, built by <HI>Ro∣ger de Montgomery,</HI> the first Earl hereof. A Town which, for neatness of Buildings both publick and private, for variety and fineness of Streets, for extent and populousness, yields to few Cities in England It contains five Parish-Churches, two of which (viz. St. Ma∣rie's and St. Alchmond's) are fair Structures, and beautify'd with lofty Spires. And here are still to be seen the Remains of a stately Ab∣bey, founded by the foresaid Earl of Mont∣gomery. Besides the natural Strength of this Place, it is fenced about with a strong Wall, with a Bulwark ranging from the Castle unto (and part along) the Severn. On the East and West there are three Entrances into the Town by two fair Stone-bridges, with Gates, Towers, and Bars; and on the North, by a Gate, over which stands the Castle, once ex∣ceeding strong. Remarkable besides for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>Charles Talbot,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> In short, 'tis a well-traded and frequented Town by all sorts of people, both English and Welch, whose frequent Intercourse brought them to speak both Speeches. The principal Trade they drive here is in Cloths, Frizes, Welch Cottons, and some other Commodities, this being the common Mart or Empory between England and Wales. And here are Weekly 3 Markets, Viz. On Wednesdays for Provi∣sions, on Thursdays for Welch Cottons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (here sold in great abundance, and thence sent to London,) on Saturdays for all sorts of Provisions.</P>

<P>Among which <HI>Ludlow,</HI> seated in the South Parts of the County, upon the Banks of the Teme, is the most considerable. The Town is large, and populous; beautified with many fair Edifices. It is also defended by a Wall and a Castle, both built by Earl Roger of Montgomery.</P>
<P>But it is of chief note, for being the Place where the Court for the Marshes of Wales were kept, first ordained by King Henry VIII. for the Trial of Causes, but suppressed in the late Session of Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P><HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> or the Borough of <HI>Bruges,</HI> is situate upon the Severn, over which there's a fair Stone-bridge. 'Tis a good large Town, divided into two Parts, the one called the Upper, the other the Lower Town, contain∣ing two Parish Churches. In former time fortified with Walls, a Ditch, and a stately Castle seated on a Rock, now decay'd.</P>
<P><HI>Drayton,</HI> on the River Terne, where it se∣vers this County from Staffordshire, is a Place of some note for a Battel there fought betwixt the Houses of York and Lanca∣ster.</P>
<PB N="187" REF="115"/>
<P><HI>Newport</HI> lies South of Drayton, on a Plain or Flat adjoyning to Staffordshire. <HI>Great Wenlock,</HI> in the Road from Worcester to Shrewsbury. <HI>Bishops Castle,</HI> in the South Parts, not far from the River Clun. <HI>Wem,</HI> on the Roden, in the North Parts of the County; noted for the Title of Baron it lately gave to the Lord Chancellour <HI>Jeffreys.

<P>At <HI>Wenlock,</HI> in the Time of Richard the Second, was found a rich Copper Mine.

<P><HI>Alderbury,</HI> though no Market-Town, is famed for being the Birth-place of old <HI>Thomas Parre,</HI> who lived to a great Age, and about two years before he died was brought up to London to King Charles I. Where he died, and lies buried in Westminster Abbey.

<HEAD>Somerset∣shire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SOMERSETSHIRE,</HI> a large Ma∣ritime County in the West of England, is so called from <HI>Somerton,</HI> once the most famous and most considerable Town in all the County, and now but a small Market-Town of little or no credit.</P>
<P>'Tis bounded <HI>on the East</HI> by Wiltshire and part of Devonshire; <HI>on the West,</HI> by Devon∣shire; <HI>Northward,</HI> by the Severn Sea, and part of Glocestershire; <HI>Southward,</HI> by the Coun∣ties of Devon and Dorset.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, is about 55 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, 40. The Whole divided into 42 <HI>Hun∣dreds,</HI> wherein 385 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 30 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> of this County, in the Summer Season, is very agreeable; but, in Winter∣time, 'tis apt to be too moist and foggy.</P>
<P>Accordingly the <HI>Soil</HI> in Winter is wet, miry, and moorish, especially in the midst of the Country, which makes the Roads very uneasy to Travellers. But in Summer there is no pleasanter Country, being garnished (as it is) with rich Pastures and delight∣ful Meadows. Which has given occasion to an usual Proverb here, that <HI>what is worse for the Rider is best for the Abider.</HI></P>
<P>And, besides Corn and Cattle, wherewith this Country is plentifully stored, here are in∣some Parts, especially towards Wiltshire, rich Lead-Mines, to the great benefit not only of the County, but of the whole Kingdom. These Mines are found particularly in the Hills called <HI>Mendip-Hills;</HI> of no small Profit to the Owners.</P>
<P>As for its Diamonds, commonly called Bri∣stol-Stones,
<PB N="189" REF="116"/>I refer you to Bristol in Glo∣cestershire.</P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Severns</HI> Mouth, whereby the North-West Part of this Country is water∣ed, here is the <HI>Avon,</HI> which parts this Coun∣ty from Glocestershire, the <HI>Parret,</HI> the <HI>Tor, Tone, Frome,</HI> and others, well stored with ex∣cellent Fish.</P>
<P>In this County are three Cities, <HI>Bristol, Bath,</HI> and <HI>Wells. Bristol</HI> indeed stands also in Glo∣cestershire; and, as I have already described it there, I shall pass it over here.</P>
<P><HI>Bath</HI> bears West and by South from Lon∣don, and is distant therefrom 94 miles. Viz. from London to <HI>Reading,</HI> 32 miles, as you may see in Parkshire; from thence to <HI>Newbery,</HI> 15; and to <HI>Marlborough,</HI> 15 more; thence to <HI>Chipenham,</HI> 15; and to <HI>Bath</HI> 13 more.</P>
<P>It is so called from its Medicinal hot Baths, much resorted unto from all Parts, as being found by long experience to be of great virtue in the curing of Aches and other Di∣stempers.</P>
<P>Its Situation is on the River <HI>Avon,</HI> over which it has a Stone-Bridge; and there it lies in a low and small Plain, surrounded with Hills very high and steep, out of which issue forth several Springs of Water, which pay Tribute to it. This is a Place of great Antiquity, as does appear by many Roman Inscriptions and Images commonly found in the Walls which incompass it. And where the Abbey now stands, 'tis said there was of old a Temple consecrated to Minerva, the Goddess of Fountains and Baths. In short, 'tis a fine City, graced with well∣built Houses; and for divine Worship, hav∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a Parish Church, besides its Cathe∣dral.</P>
<PB N="190" REF="117"/>
<P>The Baths in it are four in number, viz. the <HI>Cross,</HI> and the <HI>hot Bath,</HI> in the West Parts of the City, the <HI>King's</HI> and the <HI>Queen's-Bath,</HI> in the middle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cross Bath,</HI> so called from a Cross that formerly stood in the midst of it, is Triangular, about 25 foot long, and as broad at one end. This is of a more gentle heat than the rest, because it has fewer Springs. About 100 foot from it is the <HI>Hot-Bath,</HI> so called, because formerly it was much hotter than the rest, when it was not so large as now it is.</P>
<P>The <HI>King's Bath</HI> is about 60 foot square, and has about the middle of it many hot Springs rising, whence it has the greater heat. The <HI>Queen's Bath</HI> has no Spring in it, but on∣ly receives the Water from the King's Bath, from which it is only divided by a Wall; and so it is more temperate than the King's. In these two Baths is a Pump, to pump Water upon the Diseased, where strong Embrocati∣ons are required.</P>
<P>In every one of the <HI>Baths</HI> are Seats of Stone, for the conveniency of those that use 'em. But from 8 a Clock in the morning till about 3 in the afternoon, these Baths are shut up, and none permitted entrance; being then so very hot, that they work and cast up a filth from the bottom.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Bath</HI> do not only find a great advantage by these Medicinal Springs, but also by their Cloth Manufacture, wherein they drive a considerable Trade. And, for Provisions, they have two Markets a Week, viz. Wednesdays and Satur∣days.</P>
<PB N="191" REF="117"/>
<P>This City is Partner with <HI>Wells,</HI> the Bi∣shops See, in the Title Episcopal.</P>
<P>Noted besides, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>John Granvile,</HI> creat∣ed Earl of Bath by King Charles the II. Anno 1661. Which Title was formerly in∣joy'd by the Heirs of <HI>John Bourchier,</HI> who was created Earl of Bath by King Henry VIII. Anno 1536; but went away from that Fa∣mily by the Death of <HI>Henry Bourchier,</HI> dying without Issue male.</P>
<P><HI>Wells,</HI> seated at the foot of a Hill, is so called from the Springs and Wells that spring about it. 'Tis a small City, but well inha∣bited, and adorned with fair Buildings, both publick and private. The Cathedral, among the rest, is a stately Pile of building, hav∣ing in the West End a Frontispiece of excel∣lent Imagery and carved Stone-work; de∣dicated to S. Andrew, and said to be first built by Ina, King of the West-Saxons. Ad∣joyning to it is the Bishops Pallace, built in the manner of a Castle, and fortified with Walls and a Mote; and on the other side are the Prebends Houses, &amp;c. The Market-house is also a neat Building, supported by Pillars. Lastly, this City has two Markets a Week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, as Bath.</P>

<P>Among which <HI>Bruton,</HI> seated on the River <HI>Brue,</HI> is a well-built and inhabited Town, that drives a good Trade for Clothing, Serges, and Maulting. 'Tis graced with a beautifull Church, has a Free School founded by King Edward the Sixth, and a very fine Alms∣house.</P>
<P><HI>Langport</HI> stands on the top of a Hill, in a miry and moorish Country, and near the River <HI>Parret,</HI> which next to the Avon is the most considerable.</P>
<P><HI>South-Petherton, Crokehorn, Chard,</HI> and <HI>Il∣mister</HI> ly not far asunder, near the West-Bor∣ders of Dorsetshire; the first two, on the Banks of the Parret. <HI>Dulverton,</HI> on the Ex, borders upon Devonshire.</P>
<P><HI>Wivescomb, Wellington, North Curry,</HI> and <HI>Taun∣ton</HI> are seated on the River <HI>Tone. Taunton,</HI> the chief of all the List, is a neat and popu∣lous Town, graced with spacious Streets, and
<PB N="193" REF="118"/>a fine Bridge over the River. Inhabited chiefly by Clothiers, who drive a considera∣ble Trade with the Cloths and Serges made here, and in the adjacent Parts. It con∣tains two Parish Churches.</P>
<P><HI>Bridgewater</HI> and <HI>Glassenbury</HI> are the two Pla∣ces of chief note next to Taunton; the first seated on the <HI>Parret,</HI> the laft on the <HI>Tor,</HI> and each with a Stone-Bridge over its proper Ri∣ver. The first is a large, well-inhabited, and frequented Town, adorned with the Title of an Earldom, in the person of the Right Ho∣nourable <HI>John Egerton,</HI> the present Earl of Bridgewater. Derived to him from his Father <HI>John Egerton,</HI> created Earl of Brigewater by King James I. Anno 1617. Which Title was formerly injoyed by <HI>Henvy</HI> Lord <HI>Dawbeney,</HI> ad∣vanced from a Knight to this Dignity by King Henry VIII; he being Son of that <HI>Giles Daw∣beney,</HI> who came in with King Henry VII. from Bretagne in France. But he dying with∣out Issue, this Title died with him; till re∣vived, as aforesaid.</P>
<P><HI>Glassenbury,</HI> of old called the Island of <HI>Avalon,</HI> is of chief note for its once famous and state∣ly Abbey; the Monks whereof (for the Cre∣dit of it) gave it out, that the Body of <HI>Jo∣seph of Arimathea</HI> lay there Interred. Cer∣tain it is, that this was a Shelter to the Britains in the latter Times of the British Churches, when they were miserably harassed and persecuted by the Pagan Saxons And it might be (as Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> says) of far greater request among the Britains, because it was the Place where King <HI>Arthur</HI> was bu∣ried. Whose Body was found there very deep in the Earth in the Reign of Henry II, with a Latine Inscription on a leaden Cross, ex∣pressing
<PB N="194" REF="119"/>that King Arthur lay there buried in the Island of <HI>Avalon.</HI> And his Body was laid so deep for fear of the Saxons, this being a Place of Retreat in the British Times, but not without the apprehension of their Ene∣mies Invasion.</P>
<P><HI>Axebridge</HI> is so called from the River Axe, on which it is situate, <HI>Pensford</HI> and <HI>Canesham</HI> ly North and by East from Axebridge; both seated on the Chire, and the last at its very fall into the Avon, near Bristol. <HI>Philip-Nor∣ton</HI> and <HI>Froumselwood</HI> stand near the Froume, on the Confines of Wiltshire. <HI>Shepton-Malles</HI> and <HI>Somerton</HI> ly South and by West from 'em; both pretty large, but poor Towns. Whereas <HI>Somerton</HI> (as I said before) was once a Place of such note, that the Shire took its Name from it.</P>
<P><HI>Ilchester,</HI> so called from the River <HI>Ill,</HI> or <HI>Yeovel,</HI> upon which it is seated, is a Town of great Antiquity, and was once a Place of good Strength. Then it had 16 Parish Churches, now reduced to two. However this is the Place where the County-Goal is kept. <HI>Evil,</HI> or <HI>Yeovel,</HI> stands upon the same River, and grows by the decay of of its Neighbour Ilchester.</P>
<P><HI>Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aunton</HI> stands on the side of a Hill, in the Road to London; and is a good Mar∣ket-Town, for Cheese especially.</P>
<P><HI>Minehead, Watchet,</HI> and <HI>Dunster</HI> ly all three by the Sea-side. But the first has the best Harbour, and is a Place of some Trade, es∣pecially into Ireland. West from which, to∣wards Devonshire, stands another Sea-Town called <HI>Porlock,</HI> noted for its Bay or Harbour, sometimes resorted unto by Seamen in those Parts.</P>
<PB N="195" REF="119"/>
<P>But, to conclude, this County in general is noted for two Things, besides the fore-men∣tioned. The first, for giving the Title of Duke to his Grace, <HI>Charles Seymour,</HI> the pre∣sent Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> Marquess of <HI>Hartford, &amp;c.</HI> Descended from <HI>Edward Seymour,</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and Lord Protector of King Ed∣ward the Sixth, who was beheaded Anno 1552. But, upon the Restauration of King Charles the Second, the Title was restored to the Line in the person of <HI>William Seymour,</HI> the great Grandchild of the foresaid Duke; from whom it is now devolved to the present Duke, Bro∣ther to <HI>Francis</HI> who was killed in Italy.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable besides, that this County was few Years since the Scene which brought the late Duke of Monmouth, with many of his Followers, to their tragical End; and gave an Opportunity to the Popish Party, by the uncontroulable Authority of the late King James, to hurry on their Design of Intailing Popery and Slavery upon these Nations. Which was wonderfully defeated, under God, by the Magnanimity of our present King.</P>
<P>Lastly, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> and its Inhabitants Part of the <HI>Belgae</HI> in the Time of the Romans) is now in the Diocese of <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> and <HI>Wells.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 16 Members of Parliament, Viz. Two out of each of these following Pla∣ces, <HI>Bristol, Bath, Wells, Taunton, Bridgewater, Minehead, Ilchester,</HI> and <HI>Milburn Port.</HI> Which last stands on the Confines of Dorset∣shire.</P>
<PB N="196" REF="120"/>
<P>In the South Parts of this County is a sharp Hill, called <HI>Montacute,</HI> which gives the Title of Viscount to the Right-Honourable <HI>Francis Brown,</HI> the present Viscount <HI>Montacute.</HI> Derived to him from <HI>Anthony Brown,</HI> created Viscount <HI>Montacute</HI> in the Reign of Queen Mary, Anno 1354; being descended from the Lady <HI>Lucy,</HI> Daughter of <HI>John Nevil,</HI> Grand∣child of <HI>Tho. Montacute</HI> Earl of Salisbury, who was created Lord <HI>Montacute,</HI> and afterwards Marquess <HI>Montacute,</HI> by King Edward the fourth.</P>

<HEAD>Stafford∣shire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>STAFFORDSHIRE,</HI> an Inland Coun∣ty, is bounded <HI>Eastward</HI> by Derbyshire and part of Warwickshire, parted from the first for the most part by the River Dove; <HI>West∣ward,</HI> by Cheshire and Shropshire; <HI>Northward,</HI> by Cheshire and part of Derbyshire; and <HI>Southward,</HI> by Worcestershire.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, is at least 40 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, a∣bout 25. The whole divided into five <HI>Hun∣dreds,</HI> where in 130 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 18 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> is counted here pretty good and healthfull, but it is somewhat sharp in Win∣ter.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Soil,</HI> 'tis true the greatest Part of the Country is taken up with Moors, and Woods; insomuch that one may go the whole length of the County, and see little but Heaths and Moors. But they are such as yield both profit and pleasure. Profit, by breeding Multitudes of Sheep, Deer, and Co∣nies; and many of 'em by the Husbandmans Industry, yielding very good Corn. Plea∣sure, for they afford the greatest plenty of
<PB N="197" REF="120"/>Heath-Game of any County in the King∣dom, either by Hawking or Hunting. And so great was formerly the Number of Parks and Warrens in this Shire, that there was scarce any Gentlemans Seat in the Coun∣ty but what had both Park and Warrens. The chief Forests are those of Cank and Kinvare; and among Chases, those of Need∣wood, Peasey, and Alderwas Hay.</P>
<P>In short, the North Part of this Country is full of Hills, and Woods, the South stored with Coals and Mines of Iron, and the middle Part (being watered with the River Trent) adorned with fair Corn-fields and Meadows. And yet in the North-Parts the Pastures near the River Dove yield the sweetest and fattest Mutton in England.</P>
<P>For Manuring the Ground, here's plenty both of Lime and Marl. For Building, a∣bundance of Timber and Stone, which last for its fineness and durableness is held in good esteem. A sort of Plaister is made of the Lime, which soon after it is laid, grows as white as Snow, and as hard as a Stone. Here is also a good deal of Alabaster; and, in some Places, salt Springs, yielding plenty of white Salt, not much inferiour to the best Salt in Cheshire.</P>
<P>The Hills of most note are <HI>Mowcop-hill,</HI> in the Confines of Cheshire, where Mill-stones are got; <HI>Dudley-hill,</HI> which affords a fine Pro∣spect; the <HI>Shaw,</HI> which overlooks the Coun∣ties of Darby and Leicester; and the <HI>We∣ver.</HI></P>
<P>With Rivers, Springs, and Brooks, no Coun∣ty in England is better watered than this. Besides the <HI>Trent,</HI> here is the <HI>Dove,</HI> the <HI>Chur∣net,</HI> the <HI>Blithe,</HI> the <HI>Line,</HI> the <HI>Tean,</HI> the <HI>Sowe,</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="121"/>the <HI>Penk,</HI> the <HI>Manifold,</HI> and several others; some emptying themselves into the <HI>Dove,</HI> as this dees into the <HI>Trent,</HI> and all of them sto∣red with most sorts of fresh-water Fish. The <HI>Trent,</HI> of special note for its Pikes, Pearches, Fels, and Graylings; the <HI>Dove,</HI> for its Trouts; and the <HI>Blithe,</HI> for Eels. And over all these Rivers are reckoned at least 24 Stone∣bridges.</P>
<P>But as the Gentry here are not so curi∣ous in their private Buildings as they be in other Places, to amongst the numerous Towns that are here few can boast of any Beau∣ty.</P>
<P><HI>Stafford,</HI> the Shire-Town, from whence the County takes its Name, bears from London North-West, and is distant therefrom 104 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Northampton,</HI> 54 miles, for the particulars whereof I re∣fer you to Northamptonshire; from thence to <HI>Coventry,</HI> 20 miles; to <HI>Lichfield,</HI> 20 more; and thence to <HI>Stafford,</HI> 10.</P>
<P>A Town pleasantly seated on the Banks of the-River <HI>Sowe,</HI> which washes its South and West Parts, with a Bridge over it. For∣merly fenced with a Wall, except where it was secured by a large Pool or Water on the North and East. Here are two Parish-Churches, a free School, and a fine Market-Place. The Streets are large, and graced with many good Buildings. And its Market, which is kept on Saturdays, is well served with most sorts of Provisions.</P>
<P>This Town did formerly belong to the noble Family of the <HI>Staffords,</HI> first with the Title of Earl hereof and afterwards of Lord or Baron. <HI>Henry Stafford</HI> was the last of that Line, who dying Anno 1639, the Family of
<PB N="199" REF="121"/>the Staffords died also with him. But, the next year after, <HI>William Howard,</HI> Knight of the Bath, and second Son of Thomas Earl of Arundel and Surrey, having to Wife a Daughter of the last Lord Stafford, was by King Charles I. created Viscount and Lord Stafford. Who, being found Guilty of High Treason by his Peers, Dec. 7th 1680, was beheaded upon Tower-Hill Dec. 29. But the Title was in the late Reign revived in his Son <HI>Henry,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Staf∣ford.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, though <HI>Stafford</HI> be the County-Town, yet it is not the chief, either for extent or beauty, it being out-done by</P>
<P><HI>Lichfield,</HI> a City and County of it self, seated in a low and Moorish Ground, on a shallow Pool, by which it is divided into two Parts, both joyned together by a Bridge and a Causey, and making up a City of indiffe∣rent bigness. In the South Part, which is the greater of the two, stands a Grammar-School for the Education of Children, and an Hospi∣tal dedicated to S. John, for the Relief of the Poor. In the other Parts there's nothing considerable but a fair Cathedral, and that suf∣ficient of it self to renoun the Place. First built by Oswin, King of Northumberland, about the Year 656, who gave the Bishops hereof many Possessions. Afterwards being taken down by Roger de Clinton, the 37th Bi∣shop of this Diocese, that which now stands was built by him, and dedicated to the Vir∣gin Mary and S. Chad. Besides the Cathedral, this City has 3 Parish Churches. And its Weekly Markets, kept on Tuesdays and Fri∣days, are well served with Provisions.</P>

<P><HI>Ʋtoxeter</HI> and <HI>Tudbury</HI> are seated on the River Dove; <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Burton,</HI> upon Trent, the first in the Road from London to Chester, and the last famous for its Bridge leading into Derbyshire; <HI>Pagets Bromley,</HI> on the Blithe; and <HI>Checkley,</HI> on the Teane.</P>
<P><HI>Tamworth</HI> is seated on the Tame, where the Auker falls into it, with a Stone-Bridge over each. It stands part in this County, and part in Staffordshire; one part washed by the Tame, and the other Part by the
<PB N="201" REF="123"/>Auker. In short, 'tis a good Town, beau∣tified with a large Church, and strength∣ened with a small (but strong) Castle.</P>
<P><HI>Walsall</HI> is seated on the top of a high Hill, pretty well built, and driving a good Trade of Nails, Spurs, Stirrups, Bridle-bits, and Bel∣lows made here in great plenty.</P>
<P><HI>Penkridge,</HI> a Place of good Antiquity, seat∣ed near the River Penk, is now only famous for its Horse-Fair, and chiefly for Saddle-Nags. And <HI>Brewood,</HI> for that the Bishops of this Diocese had here their Pallace before the Conquest.</P>
<P><HI>Wolverhampton</HI> was only called <HI>Hampton,</HI> till such time as one <HI>Vulver,</HI> a devout Woman, inriched the Town with a Religious House.

<DIV3 TYPE="county">
<HEAD>Suffolk.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SƲFFOLK,</HI> a large Maritime County, is bounded <HI>on the East</HI> with the Ger∣man Ocean; <HI>on the West,</HI> with Cam∣bridgeshire; <HI>Northward,</HI> with Norfolk; and <HI>Southward,</HI> with Essex.</P>
<P>Called <HI>Suffolk,</HI> q. d. <HI>Southfolk,</HI> in opposition to <HI>Norfolk,</HI> which lies North from it.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, about 45 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, where broadest, at least 30. The Whole divided into 22 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 575 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 30 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI> A strong Argument of its Populousness.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Air</HI> is counted so wholsom, that some London Physicians have prescribed it for the Cure of their consumptive Pati∣ents.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Soil,</HI> the Eastern Parts all along the Coast, for five or six miles Inland, are ge∣nerally heathy, sandy, and full of blea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hills; yet such as yield abundance of Rye Pease, and Hemp, and feed abundance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sheep. The more Inland Part, commonly called high Suffolk, or the Wood-Lands, is for the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> part Clay-Ground, and is husbanded chiefly for the Dairy, this County being noted fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its excellent Butter. The Southern Parts
<PB N="203" REF="124"/>along the Borders of Essex and Cambridge∣shire, are much of the same nature for Wood and Pasture-Ground. But the Parts about Bury, and to the North-West from thence, are generally Champain, abounding with excellent Corn of all sorts. And as for Parks, here are reckoned in this County near upon fifty.</P>
<P>For <HI>Rivers,</HI> few Counties are so well wa∣tered. Besides the little <HI>Ouse</HI> and the <HI>Wave∣ney,</HI> which part it from Norfolk here is the <HI>Stoure,</HI> which severs it from Essex, the <HI>Orwell</HI> or <HI>Gippe,</HI> the <HI>Ore, Blithe, Deben,</HI> and <HI>Breton,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Ipswich,</HI> the chief Place hereof, bears from London North-East, and is distant from thence 55 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Colchester,</HI> 43 miles, as you may see in Essex; and 12 from thence to <HI>Ipswich.</HI></P>
<P>This is one of the best and most thriving Towns in England, seated in the South-East Parts of the County, on the Banks of the <HI>Orwell,</HI> about 20 miles from its fall into the Sea. A Place of great Antiquity, former∣ly walled about by a Rampire of Earth, which in the Year 991 was thrown down by the Danes; who grievously harassed these Parts, and some years after came with such a fury, that they left scarce any thing of Ipswich but the Ruins of its Buildings. But, that Storm being over, it began in the Nor∣mans Time to recover it self. So that at this present, whether we consider its Extent, Populousness, or Trade, it yields to very few Cities in England. It reaches a mile in length, and above a mile in breath, with no less than 12 Parish Churches, which shews its Populousness.</P>
<PB N="204" REF="125"/>
<P>Within that Compass are several fair Buildings, both publick and private; and, among those, the Place of Judicature, a free School with the Conveniency of a good Li∣brary, and for the Relief of the Poor an Hospital. And, as for Cleanliness, 'tis count∣ed (next to Bristol) one of the cleanliest Towns in England. Its chief Trade consists in the Manufacture of Cloth, both Linnen and Woollen, besides Fishing and Ship-build∣ing. For Provisions, &amp;c. it has 3 Markets a Week, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. And, to conclude, it is of some note for be∣ing the Birth-place of <HI>Cardinal Wolsey,</HI> who be∣gan here to build a stately Colledge, bearing his Name to this day. The same gives the Title of Viscount to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Grafton.</HI></P>

<P>Among which <HI>Bury,</HI> or <HI>S. Edmunds Bury,</HI> is the most remarkable; being so called from King <HI>Edmund</HI> the Martyr, here interred. Who, for not renouncing the Christian Faith, was shot to death at Hoxon by the Danes, and his Body stuck by degrees with Arrows. In this Town was erected the first Christian Church by Sigebert, King of the East-Angles, in which King Edmund was buried. And, in Memory of him, here was erected a most stately Abbey, of which and the Town it self take this Description from an ancient Author. The Sun, says he, has not seen a Town more finely or delicately seated, upon the East Ascent of a Hill, with a River running on the East side. Nor a more stately Abbey, incom∣parable either for Magnificence or Revenues, in whose prospect appeareth rather a City than a Monastery. So many Gates it has for entrance, and many of them Brass; so many Towers; and, above all, a most glorious Chuch. Upon which attend three others, standing all in the same Church-yard, all of them very fine, and of curious Artifice. The Town, at present, do's consist of two Parish-Churches; the Houses pretty well built; the Market-hill, Fair-stead, and Corn-Cross, spa∣cious and handsom. And for what remains of the Abbey it self (in whose Yard stands an old Shire-House) 'tis far more majestick, than any other Ruins of its kind. The Market is of special note, for the extraordinary Quan∣tities of Corn brought to it, for which 'tis usually the Standard of the Country. Last∣ly, not far from this Town was that great Battel fought against King Henry the Second, where this King had the good fortune to overthrow Robert Earl of Leicester, with his
<PB N="206" REF="126"/>Rabble of Flemings, who joyned with the rebellious Son of King Henry, the Earl him∣self and his Wife being taken Prisoners.</P>
<P><HI>Stow-Market</HI> and <HI>Needham</HI> are both seated upon the Orwell. The first, as it were, in the Center of the County, having a fair Pro∣spect down the River Eastward. 'Tis a large and beautifull Town, graced with a spacious Church, and its Steeple adorned with a huge and lofty Pinnacle, not easy to be paral∣lelled. The grand Trade of this Town is in Tammeys, and other Norwich Stuffs, this be∣ing the only Town in Suffolk considerable for such Things.</P>
<P><HI>Needham,</HI> an ominous Name, drives still a Trade (but less than formerly) in the Suf∣folk blue and broad Cloths for Russia, Turky, and orher Countries. Which creates spinning Work for the poorer sort of Women, whilst others get a Livelyhood by making of Bone∣lace.</P>
<P><HI>Debenham,</HI> and <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> are on the River. Deben. The last a large Town, seated on the East-side of a sandy Hill, watered with several Streams, and having a pleasant Pro∣spect down the River Deben, which about 12 miles lower discharges it self into the Sea. Here is a fair Church, with several Monu∣ments in it. In the midst of its Market-Place is also a fair Pile of brick, in a Chamber whereof are held the Quarter-Sessions for the Liberty of S. Ethelred and Audry. The Mar∣ket well traded unto, especially for Hemp. In this Town are four or five good Docks for building of Ships, most of 'em well imploy'd, and noted among Seamen for good Work∣manship. The Inhabitants, for their part, drive a considerable Trade by Sea, for which
<PB N="207" REF="126"/>they are furnished with several Ships of bur∣den. And the principal Commodities they deal in are Butter, Cheese, Pouldavis, Sack∣cloth, Planks, &amp;c. besides their refining of Salt.</P>
<P><HI>Orford,</HI> a few miles East and by South from Woodbridge, is seated between the River Ore on the East and a smaller Stream on the West, within two miles from the Sea. Here is a Church well mounted, but unsightly with∣in; and hard by it the Ruins of a high close-built Castle. Which, together with the Church-Steeple, are good Directions to Sea∣men, as the Light-house at the Ness is by night.</P>
<P>In the Reign of Henry the Second (say's Sir Richard Baker) there was taken near <HI>Or∣ford</HI> a Fish in the Shape of a Man, which was kept in the Castle above 6 months. This Fish eat all manner of Meat, but delighted chiefly in Fish. An Author that comments upon it says very seriously, that <HI>he spoke not one Word,</HI> and Reason good, for it was a Fish; and that <HI>the People brought him sometimes to Church, but he never shewed any Sign of Adoration,</HI> which is no wonder of a Fish. At length, for want of looking to, this Man-Fish stole into the Sea, and was never more seen, <HI>because</HI> (I guess) <HI>the Water was his Element.</HI></P>
<P>But here is something more admirable. On the narrow stony Beach, that shoots Southerly betwixt the Town and the Sea, 'tis said that in the Year 1555, when there was a great Dearth, there sprang up among the <HI>Meer∣shingle</HI> such Quantities of Pease, that the People gathered of 'em above 100 Quarters; which both abated the price of Corn, and preserved many from famishing. And at the
<PB N="208" REF="127"/>South Point of it, there still comes up yearly certain course gray Pease, and good Coleworts out of the Stone-heaps.</P>
<P><HI>Alborough,</HI> another Coast-Town, ly's 2 miles North-East of <HI>Orford.</HI> Pleasantly seated in a Dale, between the Sea on the East, a high Hill on the West where stands a large and old-built Church, and a small River that runs to the Southward. This is a long, large, and plain-built Town, with mean Houses. Chief∣ly noted for its Fishery, for which they have a commodious Key at <HI>Slaughden,</HI> a quarter of a mile Southwards; and, along the Beach towards <HI>Orford,</HI> Conveniencies above other Towns, for the drying of their North-Sea-Fish. A little North of the Town is a Village, call∣ed <HI>Thorp,</HI> whence several Parts of the County are served with Lobsters and Crabs.</P>
<P><HI>Saxmundsham</HI> lies North of Alborough, and at some distance from the Sea, upon a small River.</P>
<P><HI>Dunwich,</HI> on the Sea-shore, was the first Bishops See of the East-Angles, for the Coun∣ty of Suffolk. Then a Town capable of that Dignity; now ruinous, decay'd, and for the greatest part worn into the Sea. However it do's still contain two Parish Churches. Fishing of Sprats in Winter, and of Herrings, Mackerels, Soles, and the like, in their pro∣per Seasons, is the chief Imployment of its Inhabitants, as it is with those of Albo∣rough.</P>
<P><HI>Swold,</HI> or <HI>Sowold,</HI> a few miles more North∣ward, stands also by the Sea-side. Seated on a pleasant Cliff, the Sea on the East, the Har∣bour on the South, the River Blithe with a Draw-bridge on the West, and a small Neck of Land on the North. So that it is almost
<PB N="209" REF="127"/>incompassed with Water, especially at every floud. And, besides the natural Situation of the Place, which renders it a Town of good strength, here are planted on the Cliff seve∣ral Pieces of Ordnance. Its Bay called <HI>Swolds Bay,</HI> so famous for Ships to ride in, is chiefly made by the Shooting forth of <HI>Easton Ness,</HI> a little North of it, which is the most Eastern Part of all England.</P>
<P><HI>Lestoft</HI> is the most Northern Sea-Town of this County, and a good thriving Place. Its chief Trade consists in fishing for Cod in the North Sea, and at home for Herrings, for which it lies most conveniently over against the chief Herring-Beds.</P>
<P><HI>Beckles</HI> and <HI>Bungay</HI> are both seated on the banks of the Waveney. The first has two Parish-Churches; and a Grammar-School, with ten Scholarships for Emanuel Colledge in Cambridge. Here the Womens Imploy is to knit Worsted Stockings, whilst at Diss in Norfolk on the other side of the River they imploy themselves in knitting of Silk ones.</P>
<P><HI>Halesworth, Framlingham,</HI> and <HI>Eye,</HI> make a kind of Triangle. The first is a thriving Town for Retail Trade, dealing much in Linnen, Yarn and Sale Cloth.</P>
<P><HI>Framlingham,</HI> a good large Town, is seated upon a Clay-hill, near the head of the River Ore. Defended by a spacious tall Castle of Saxon Work, well walled, and double ditched on one part, with a large Meer on the other part. This Castle had once no less than 13 high Towers; and was counted so strong, that Robert, the rebellious Earl of Leicester against King Henry the Second, took up his Quarters here. Its Inworks are now
<PB N="210" REF="128"/>much defaced, there being only a large Dwelling-house, a Grammar-School-House, &amp;c; but the Outworks are more like a Castle, than the Ruins of one.</P>
<P><HI>Eye,</HI> a pretty large Market-Town, and an ancient Corporation, is situate in a watery Place. It shew's a fair Church, with the Ruins of a Castle, and of an ancient Bene∣dictine Abbey called S. Peter's. The Wo∣mens Imploy in this Town is making of Bone∣lace. This Corporation is a Peculiar of the Crown, an Honour of ancient Time, and has been given in Joynture with the Queens of England.</P>
<P><HI>Buddesdale,</HI> some miles West of Eye, is but a little Borough-Town, seated (according to its Name) in a Dale. Here is a Grammar-School indowed, with certain Scholarships as∣signed to Bennet (or Corpus Christi Colledge) in Cambridge.</P>
<P><HI>Hadleigh</HI> and <HI>Lavenham</HI> are both seated on the River Breton, and <HI>Bilston</HI> on a Rivulet that falls into it. The first a Town of great ac∣count formerly for its Clothing, has a fine Church, which is a great Ornament to it, and is a Peculiar of Canterbury. Of some note for the Martyrdom of Dr. Taylor, their some∣time famous Minister, who suffered here for his Religion.</P>
<P>But, whereas <HI>Hadleigh</HI> is seated in a Bot∣tom, <HI>Lavenham</HI> on the contrary stands on an Eminence. This also has a comely and spacious Church and Steeple, injoy's a pretty good Trade, and is something the more fre∣quented for its famous Lecture.</P>
<P><HI>Bilston,</HI> or <HI>Bildeston,</HI> is noted for its Blues and Blankets. And the Women here either spin corded Wool for the Clothier, or white Work for the Packer.</P>
<PB N="211" REF="128"/>
<P><HI>Neyland, Sudbury, Clare,</HI> and <HI>Haverill,</HI> are all four seated on the River Stower. The first, in a rich Bottom, is a good Country Town, noted for its Clothing, but chiefly for its Bays and Sayes, wherein the Inhabitants drive a Trade with London.</P>
<P><HI>Sudbury</HI> is a good large Town, having a fair Bridge over the River Stower, which leads in∣to Essex. It contains 3 Parish Churches, and drives a good Trade of Cloathing; being chiefly noted for Says, as Colchester in Essex for Bays. Of some Note besides, for giving the Title of Baron to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Grafton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Clare</HI> is a Town of more antiquity than beauty, having nothing to boast of but the Ruins of a Castle and Collegiate Church, but that it gave both Name and Title to that noble Family surnamed <HI>De Clare,</HI> who in their Times were Earls of <HI>Hartford, Clare,</HI> and <HI>Glo∣cester.</HI> The last of that Name was <HI>Gilbert de Clare,</HI> who died Anno 1295. He had a Sister and Coheir, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> by Name, the Wife of <HI>William de Burg,</HI> Earl of Ulster in Ireland, by whom she got a Daughter, their sole Heir. To this great Heiress <HI>Lionel,</HI> the third Son of King Edward III, was married, and upon his Marriage made Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> the Termi∣nation of the Title being only changed, not the Place denominating. And from this Change the second King of Arms is surnamed <HI>Claren∣cieux,</HI> as appertaining formerly to the Dukes of <HI>Clarence.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this first Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> I can find but two more. Viz. <HI>Thomas,</HI> second Son to King Henry IV, Lord Admiral, who was slain in France; and <HI>George,</HI> Brother to King Ed. ward IV, Lord Constable.</P>
<PB N="212" REF="129"/>
<P>But, in the Year 1624, the first Title of <HI>Clare</HI> was revived in the person of <HI>John Holles,</HI> Lord <HI>Houghton,</HI> Created Earl of <HI>Clare</HI> by King James the first. To whom succeeded <HI>John Hol∣les,</HI> his eldest Son; then <HI>Gilbert Holles,</HI> the late Earl; and upon his Decease, the Right Ho∣nourable <HI>John Holles,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Clare.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Haveril,</HI> on the edge of Suffolk, Essex, and Cambridgeshire, is a small and plain Market-Town not far from the Head of the Stow∣er, adjoyning to the Saffron Grounds. The principal Trade here is Fustians.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Newmarket,</HI> I refer you to <HI>Cambridge∣shire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mildenhall,</HI> a large and populous Market-Town, is seated on the Banks of a River that runs from East to West into the Ouse, al∣most over against <HI>Littleport</HI> in Cambridge∣shire. Here is a fair Church, with a very tall Steeple. And its Market does chiefly abound with Fish and wild Fowl from the Fens. Spin∣ning is here the principal Imployment of the poorer sort of Women.</P>
<P><HI>Iksworth</HI> is but a small Market-Town, which (according to Cambden) retains in its Name the Memory of the <HI>Iceni,</HI> who partly dwelt in this County. In this Town are yet some Remains of an ancient Priory, founded by <HI>Gil∣bert Blunt,</HI> Lord of the Town; as also of a Guild-Hall, where (not many years since) has been digged up a Pot of Roman Coyn, bear∣ing Inscriptions of divers Roman Emperours.</P>
<P>But, besides the foresaid Market-Tows, there are other Towns in Suffolk, which upon some account or other do deserve a place here.</P>
<PB N="213" REF="129"/>
<P><HI>Exning,</HI> or <HI>Ixning,</HI> among others, not far from Newmarket, has at least as much right as <HI>Iksworth</HI> to claim its Name from the anci∣ent <HI>Iceni.</HI> This is the Place which gave Birth to St. <HI>Audry,</HI> the Virgin Daughter of <HI>Anna,</HI> King of the East-Angles; who, for her holy Life and Works of Piety, was Canonized for a Saint. From this Town to Ely, Henry Bishop of Ely made a Causey or high Way.</P>
<P><HI>Brandon,</HI> seated upon the little Ouse, over which it has a Bridge, was once a Market-Town, but has lost that Conveniency. How∣ever 'tis of some note for giving the Title of Baron to the Earl of <HI>Maclesfield.</HI> And, not far from it, is a noted Ferry, called from hence the <HI>Brandon Ferry,</HI> where Things come up from the Isle of <HI>Ely.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Euston,</HI> some miles from Brandon to the Eastward, is also situate on the Banks of the little Ouse, and that hard by Fackenham. This indeed is but a small Place, but (as an Author describes it) finely seated on a Flat, in a fair Champain Country, for pleasure and delight. Which induced the late Earl of Ar∣lington to raise a noble Structure there, called <HI>Euston-Hall,</HI> of extraordinary Beauty. Adjoyn∣ing to which is a large Nursery, containing 1560. Fruit-trees of several sorts; besides artificial Fountains, and a Canal which makes a plea∣sant noise as it falls into the River. There is also to be seen a Grove of near ten thousand Trees, a large Warren, and many other Cu∣riosities. The Particulars whereof I shall wave, to acquaint the Reader, that upon the Mar∣riage of the second Son of the Dutchess of Cleveland to the only Daughter of the Earl of Arlington, it pleased King Charles II. that
<PB N="214" REF="130"/>he should receive Denomination from the no∣ble Seat aforesaid. Accordingly he was crea∣ted Baron of <HI>Sudbury,</HI> Viscount <HI>Ipswich,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Euston</HI> Anno 1672; and finally Duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> in the Year 1675.</P>
<P><HI>Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> that is Offa's Town, King of Mer∣cia. Who, having treacherously murdered Ethelbert King of the East-Angles (to whose Court he came an invited Guest, Anno 793.) and thereupon usurped his Kingdom, erected here a small Castle on a Clay-hill. The Ruins of which are yet apparent, under the Name of <HI>Offton-Castle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rendlesham,</HI> situate on the River Deben, to∣wards Orford, is noted for being the Place where Redwald, the first Christian King of the East-Angles, kept his Court. Who, being af∣terward seduced by his Queen, permitted an Altar to be placed in the Church for her Heathenish Sacrifices to Devils, together with his Altar for the Worship of the true God.</P>
<P><HI>Wickham,</HI> or <HI>Wickham-Market,</HI> North of Wood∣bridge, and upon the same River, is as big as many Market-Towns; though its Market be now lost, by reason of its Neighbourhood to Woodbridge. 'Tis a Stage-Town upon the Eastern London Road, and one of those where general and Spiritual Courts are held for the Arch-Deacon of Suffolk; to whom the Eastern Part of the County is assigned as the Western is to the Arch-Deacon o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sudbury. Here is a Spire-Steeple, which serves as a Sea-mark to Saylers off the Whi∣ting Sand by Orford.</P>
<P><HI>Walderswick,</HI> a Sea-Town near Sowolds Bay, has a fine Church and Spire-Steeple, which shews it to have been a much better Town than it is at present.</P>

<P><HI>Blithborough,</HI> a poor decayed Town, not far West from Walderswick, is so called from the River Blithe, over which it has a Bridge. Here are still to be seen the Ruins of a Pri∣ory, founded by King Henry I; and the Goal for the Division of Beckles, as a Re∣membrance of the Session, formerly kept here. Of some note besides for being the Burial Place of <HI>Anna,</HI> a Christian King of the East-Angles, slain in the Field by <HI>Peuda</HI> the Mercian King. The Church is very handsom still, and that's the only Ornament of this Place.</P>
<P>So much for the Towns of Suffolk. What remains is to acquaint you, that this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Iceni,</HI> as the Romans called them) is now in the Diocese of <HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, fourteen Members of Parliament. Viz. Two out of each of these following Places, <HI>Ipswich, Dunwich, Orford, Alborough, Sudbury, Eye, St. Edmundsbury.</HI></P>
<P>Of this County there have been Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls. And this last Title lives still in the person of the Right Honoura∣ble <HI>George Howard,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> Devolved to him from his Ancestor <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Howard</HI> of <HI>Walden,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Suffolk</HI> by King James the I. in the Year 1603.</P>

<HEAD>Surrey.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SƲRREY,</HI> an Inland County of no great extent, is bounded <HI>on the East</HI> by Kent; <HI>on the West,</HI> by Barkshire and Hampshire; <HI>North∣ward,</HI> by Middlesex, from which parted by the Thames; and <HI>Southward,</HI> by Sussex.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="131"/>
<P>Called <HI>Surrey,</HI> from its Situation on the South∣side of the River Thames; the Saxons calling that <HI>Rey,</HI> which we term a River, and so from <HI>Southrey</HI> came the Name of <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, a∣bout 35 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, 25. The Whole divided into thir∣teen <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 140 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and yet but 8 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>The Skirts of this County are very rich and fruitfull, especially towards the Thames, where it yields plenty both of Corn and Grass; but the middle Parts are somewhat hard and bar∣ren. From whence the People use to say, that their County was like a course piece of Cloth, with a fine List.</P>
<P>But what the middle Parts want in Riches they supply with Pleasures, as being famous for good <HI>Air,</HI> and well stored with Parks; the Downs affording excellent Opportunity as well for Horse-races as Hunting.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> besides the <HI>Thames</HI> aforesaid, here is none of any Note but the <HI>Wey</HI> which runs through Guildford, the <HI>Mole</HI> through Darking, and the <HI>Wandle</HI> whose Spring-head is at Croydon. All which empty themselves into the Thames, the first two near Hampton-Court, and the last near Richmond.</P>
<P><HI>Guilford,</HI> the County-Town, bears from London South-West by West, and (by com∣mon Computation) is distant from it 25 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Kingston,</HI> 10 miles; from Kingston to <HI>Cobham,</HI> 7; and to <HI>Guilford,</HI> 8 more.</P>
<P>A Town no less pleasantly than commodi∣ously seated on the River Wey, which affords a good Advantage to the Inhabitants in the Conveyance of their Goods in Barges up to
<PB N="217" REF="131"/>London, much facilitated by the several Land∣locks or Sluces on the said River. In old time it was the Royal Mansion of the English Saxon Kings, and then a Place of larger ex∣tent than now it is. Near the River stand the broken Walls of an old large Castle; and in the midst of the Town is a Church, the West-end whereof made of arched Work, and imbowed over Head, seems to be very ancient. In short, the Town is beautifull, well frequented, and full of fair Inns. It con∣tains 3 Parish Churches; and its Market, which is on Saturdays, iis well served with Corn, and other Provisions.</P>
<P>As for honourary Titles, the first that had any from hence was <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Viscountels of <HI>Kynelmalky</HI> in Ireland, Created Countess of <HI>Guilford</HI> during life by Charles II. Anno 1660. Then in the Year 1671. the same King con∣ferred the Title of Earl of <HI>Guilford</HI> upon <HI>John Maitland,</HI> the late Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> in Scotland.

<P><HI>Southwark,</HI> commonly pronounced <HI>Suthrick,</HI> stands opposite to the City of London on the Banks of the Thames. A Place which, for number of Buildings and Inhabitants, goes beyond most of the Cities in England. But,
<PB N="218" REF="132"/>for its Streets and Buildings, they are but ordinary, except the broad Street which leads from the Bridge to St. George's Church. A Street beautified with fair Buildings, raised from the Ashes of frequent Conflagrations this Place has been afflicted with. And here the Inhabitants drive a considerable Trade with the whole County, this being the most convenient Place for the <HI>Surrey</HI> Carriers that come up; for whose Accommodation here is Multitude of Inns. The principal Church here is that of St. <HI>Mary over Rey,</HI> formerly a Prio∣ry of the B. Virgin; Next to which is St. <HI>George's Church.</HI> Here is also a famous Hos∣pital, called <HI>St. Thomas's Hospital,</HI> founded by the Citizens of London, for the Relief of impotent Persons. The <HI>King's Bench</HI> and the <HI>Marshalsea</HI> are two other noted Places, and but too well known to many. To which add the <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> where Prizes are fought, and the common People diverted with the Fighting of Dogs with Bears and Bulls. In short, though this Place be counted Part of London, and under the Lord Mayor's Juris∣diction; yet it does still injoy several of its ancient Priviledges peculiar to it self, as hold∣ing of Courts within themselves, and electing of Members of Parliament, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, because it lies in Surrey, as London does in Middle∣sex, I thought it not improper to bring i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into this List.</P>
<P><HI>Kingston</HI> is situate ten Miles South-West from London, on the Banks of the Thames, over which it has a Bridge leading into Mid∣dlesex. A Town heretofore famous for the Coronation of the Monarchs of the English Saxons, whence it had the Name of <HI>Kingston,</HI> or Kings Town, whereas before it went by the
<PB N="219" REF="132"/>Name of <HI>Moreford.</HI> And, for Distinctions∣sake 'tis called <HI>Kingston upon the Thames,</HI> to difference it from <HI>Kingston upon Hull</HI> in Yorkshire. A Place in former times well known for its Castle, belonging to the <HI>Clares,</HI> Earls of Glocester. And, as for its present State, 'tis yet a goodly Town, well accommo∣dated with Inns for the Reception of Strangers, and of late something advantaged by the King's Residence in Summer at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> in its Neighbourhood, as it is by the County-Assizes which are frequently held here.</P>
<P><HI>Croydon</HI> is a long Town ten miles South from London. Seated near the Spring-head of the Wan∣dle, which falls into the Thames at Wands∣worth; and in a manner begirt with Hills well cloathed with Wood, affording good Game to the Hunter, and furnishing London with great store of Charcoal. This Town has but few good Buildings, the Houses in it being for the most part but mean and or∣dinary. But it has the advantage of being graced with a fine large Church, set out with a lofty Steeple, and with a Summer-Pal∣lace of the Lord Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Accommodated besides with an Hospital for the Relief of the Poor, and a Free School for the Education of Youth. From this Town to <HI>Farnham</HI> runs the Downs, called <HI>Banstead Downs,</HI> so noted for Hawking, Hunting, and Horse-racing. And near the Town is a Bourn, or Stream, the Rising whereof has been some∣times observed to have been a Fore runner of some publick Calamity.</P>
<P><HI>Reygate,</HI> a good large Town, is seated in the Vale called <HI>Holmes Dale,</HI> and is now of chief note for the great plenty of excellent Fullers Earth which is digged up in its Neighbour∣hood.
<PB N="220" REF="133"/>Here is an ancient, but ruinated Ca∣stle; with a long Vault under Ground, and a large Room at the end of it, where (if the Story be true) the Barons met in Coun∣cil in their War against King John. Near this Town several Battels have been fought against the Danes, which proved fatal to them.</P>
<P><HI>Darking</HI> is situate on a Branch of the Ri∣ver Mole. Where, at the foot of White-Hill (on which grow plenty of Box-trees) the said River runs under Ground for above a Mile, and rises again near Norbury. The Place where it falls in is therefore called the Swallow.</P>
<P><HI>Farnham</HI> seems to take its Name from the great Store of Fern that grows in its Neigh∣bourhood. It ly's on the edge of Surrey to∣wards Hampshire, watered by the River Wey, and graced with an Episcopal Seat, the usual Residence of the Bishops of Win∣chester. Here King Alfred, with a small Pow∣er, had the good fortune to overcome the Danes, of whom he made a great slaugh∣ter.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Ewel,</HI> all I have to say is, that it is but very mean and inconsiderable.</P>

<HEAD>Other Places of Note in this County.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Richmond,</HI> among the rest, deserves the pre∣cedency. A fair, large, and well built Town, seat∣upon an easy ascent, on the Banks of the Thames; Whose pleasant and healthfull Situ∣ation has invited so many of the Gentry to be its Inhabitants. Here King Henry VII. built a stately Pallace, which (with <HI>Nonsuch</HI> and <HI>Otelands,</HI> two other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyal Pallaces in
<PB N="221" REF="133"/>this County) has felt the sad effects of the Civil Wars in the Reign of Charles I. Here died several of the dearest Princes that ever England had Viz. King <HI>Edward</HI> III, the Conquerour of France; the beautifull <HI>Ann,</HI> Wife to King Richard the Second, and Daughter to the Emperour Charles the fourth; the most wise Prince, <HI>Henry the Seventh;</HI> and the Wonder of her Sex, the famous Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lambeth.</HI> situate opposite to Westminster, is a large Parish, of chief note for being the Residence of the Lord Archbishop of Canter∣bury, where he has a fine Pallace. And, though, it is counted unwholsom to live in, yet it is well inhabited; and the Skirts of it graced with many Gentlemens and Citizens Houses. Here Canute, the last Danish King, ended his Days among his Cups.</P>
<P>From Lambeth Westward, you will find a∣long the River <HI>Battersea, Putney, Moreclack,</HI> three goodly Towns; and, at some distance from the River, <HI>Newington, Clapham,</HI> and <HI>Wandes∣worth.</HI> This last on the River Wandle, which drives several Mills, imploy'd by Londoners; and of late much improved by the French Protestants that have resorted thither.</P>
<P>Further in the Country you'l find <HI>Stretham</HI> a sweet Place, <HI>Micham</HI> four miles West of Croydon, <HI>Cheame,</HI> and near it <HI>Nonsuch.</HI> This a Royal Pallace, so delightfully seated a∣mong Parks, and built with so much Magni∣ficence and such rare Workmanship by King Henry the eighth, with delicate Gardens, Or∣chards and Groves, that (as <HI>Speed</HI> says) no County had none such as <HI>Nonsuch</HI> it self.</P>
<PB N="222" REF="134"/>
<P>Not far from Nonsuch is <HI>Epsham,</HI> very plea∣santly seated, and much resorted unto in Summer by the Gentry and Citizens of Lon∣don, for drinking its medicinal Waters.</P>
<P>Here is also a Place called <HI>Effingham,</HI> which gives the Title of Baron to the Right Honou∣rable <HI>Charles Howard,</HI> Baron <HI>Effingham;</HI> de∣volved to him some Years since, upon the De∣cease of <HI>Charles Howard</HI> Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and Baron <HI>Effingham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Blechingly, Gatton,</HI> and <HI>Haselmere</HI> are 3 anci∣ent Borough-Towns, which have the Election of Parliament-Men. Now but small and in∣considerable, but formerly of good note; espe∣cially <HI>Gatton,</HI> where Roman Coyns have often been digged up. <HI>Haselmere</HI> stands on the edge of the County, towards Hampshire.</P>
<P><HI>Chertsey,</HI> not far from the Thames, over which it has a Bridge, is a Town of good antiquity. Here King Henry the Sixth being deposed and made away in the Tower of Lon∣don, was Interred without funeral Pomp; but, for his holy Life being reputed a Saint, was afterwards Intombed at Windsor in Bark∣shire.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ockl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> King Ethelwolf, Son to King Egbert, fought a successfull Battel against the Danes. And if <HI>Merton</HI> be famous for any thing, 'tis for the <HI>Statute</HI> of <HI>Merton,</HI> here inacted, in the Reign of King Henry the Third.</P>
<P>Lastly, this County (which with <HI>Sussex</HI> made the Kingdom of the <HI>South-Saxons,</HI> and whose Inhabitants went under the Name of <HI>Regni</HI> among the ancient Romans) is now in the Diocese of <HI>Winchester.</HI></P>

<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, about 55 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South 20. The Whole divided into six <HI>Rapes,</HI> called from their respective chief Places <HI>Chi∣chester, Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey,</HI> and <HI>Hestings Rapes.</HI> All which, one with another, contain 65 <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 312 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 16 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>Here the <HI>Air</HI> is counted generally good, though subject to Mists and Vapours arising from the Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> is rich, and such as yields plenty of all Things necessary. The North Parts, towards Kent and Surrey, are well shaded with Woods, as was all the Country heretofore, till the Iron-Works consumed them. The Southern Parts, towards the Sea, lying upon a Chalk or Marl, yield Corn abundantly; with a delightful Intermixture of Groves and Mea∣dows.</P>
<P>Where the Land is low, as it is in that Part called the <HI>Weld,</HI> the Ways are so deep
<PB N="224" REF="135"/>in Winter, that then it is exceeding bad Travelling. But that Part called the <HI>Downs</HI> is very pleasant and easy to Travel∣lers.</P>
<P>One would think, that in so large an Ex∣tent of Sea-Coast there should be many a good Harbour. Whereas 'tis very thin of 'em; and such as it has are, by reason of its Shelves and Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks, both dangerous for entrance and uncertain for continuance.</P>
<P>Here are several good <HI>Rivers,</HI> (among which <HI>Arun</HI> is the principal) that make the Country both pleasant and fruitfull, and supply it, as the Sea do's for its part, with abundance of Fish.</P>
<P>And, among Fowl, here's abundance of <HI>Wheat-ears,</HI> a small Bird about the bigness of a Lark. Which being in the prime, when Wheat is ripe, exceeds all others for fatness and daintiness. <HI>Fast-bourn,</HI> near the Sea, is the noted Place, where they catch plenty of these Birds.</P>
<P><HI>Chichester,</HI> the chief Place of this County, and that which gives Name to one of the six <HI>Rapes,</HI> is (by common Computation) 50 miles distant from London, and bears from it South-West and by South. The Way to it is through <HI>Guilford</HI> 25 miles, as you may see in Surrey; from Guilford to <HI>Godalmin,</HI> 3; thence to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>echford Bridge,</HI> 11; and to <HI>Chichester</HI> 11 more.</P>
<P>This City (for it is a Bishops See) is seated in a Plain, on the Banks of the <HI>Levant,</HI> which incompasses the South and West Parts, and at a small distance discharges it self into the Sea. First built by Cissa, the second King of the South-Saxons, where he had his Royal Pallace. It contains at this time five
<PB N="225" REF="135"/>or six Parish Churches, besides its Cathedral. Its Buildings are indifferent; but it has four spacious Streets, with a fine Market-Place of Stone, and supported round about with Pillars. The Cathedral is of a circular form, and graced with a stately Spire, built of Stone. Twice it was almost consumed by a raging fire, since it was first built by Radulph, the third Bishop here; but was afterwards re∣built and beautify'd by Seff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id the second Bi∣shop of that Name. In short, this City in∣joy's a pretty good Trade; which might be better, were not the Haven near unto it choak∣ed up. Here are two Markets weekly, kept on Wednesdays and Saturdays, well served with Corn, Flesh, Fish, and Fowl, and generally all sorts of Provisions.</P>
<P>Nigh unto this City is the Peninsule, com∣monly called <HI>Selsey Isle,</HI> of chief note at pre∣sent for the excellent Cockles and Lobsters it yields in great plenty. But in former times far more considerable, when it was an Epis∣copal See, before Bishop Stigand removed it to Chichester in the year 107.</P>
<P>Over against the West of this Peninsule lies a small Island, called <HI>Thorney Isle,</HI> from a small Town of that Name in it.</P>

<P><HI>Lewes,</HI> among all these, is the most con∣fiderable, and is therefore the Place where the Assizes are commonly kept.

<P><HI>Petworth,</HI> but a small Town, is finely seated near two Parks, and not far from the River <HI>Arun.</HI> Of chief note for its noble House, for∣merly belonging to the Earls of Northum∣berland, and now by Marriage to the Duke of Somerset.</P>
<P><HI>Arundel</HI> stands in a Dale (or Valley) on the Western Banks of the River <HI>Arun,</HI> from whence it is called <HI>Arundel,</HI> by contraction from <HI>Arundale.</HI> Over the River it has a Wooden Bridge, and from the Sea 'tis but a small distance. This is an ancient Town, no∣ted for its Castle, once of great fame and strength; but far more famous for the Lords and Earls thereof, than either for its strength or beauty. A Place in this far different from the rest of England, the Title of Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> being annexed to the Castle and its Lordship, and going along with the pos∣session of it. Witness the Judgment given in that great Controversy between Sr. <HI>John Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z-Allen,</HI> being in possession of the Castle, against <HI>John Mowbray</HI> Duke of Norfolk, be∣ing the right Heir in the nearest degree. Thus it passed through several hands, viz. the Montgomery's, the Albeneys, and the Fitz-Allens, till Anno 1604 both Castle and Title came to the possession of <HI>Thomas-Howard,</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> and Earl Marshal of England. From whom is descended in a right Line the present Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Rye,</HI> a Member of the Cinque-Ports, stands on the edge of the County towards Kent, and at the very fall of the Rother into the Sea, where it has a commodious Haven. 'Tis not a Town of any beauty. But, as it stands con∣venient for a ready Passage over Sea to Nor∣mandy,
<PB N="228" REF="137"/>and particularly to Diepe, it is upon that account much frequented in Time of Peace. Its Inhabitants are for the most part Fishermen, who fish here ex∣cellent Herrings.</P>
<P><HI>Winchelsey</HI> stands near the Place where stood another of that Name, which in the Year 1250, was swallowed up by the raging Sea; being a large, strong, and beautiful Place, in which were numbered 18 Parish Churches. Whereas the present <HI>Winchelsey</HI> consists but of one Parish, and that going still to decay, insomuch that its Markets are in a manner disused. 'Tis seated upon an Inlet of the Sea, in the Neighbourhood of Rye. But its Haven long since so choakt up, that the Town suffers much by it, Rye having got the advantage of it. However it is still a Mem∣ber of the Cinque-Ports; and what it lost in Wealth it has got in Honour, being ad∣vanced to the Reputation of an Earldom, first in the person of — <HI>Finch,</HI> Vis∣count <HI>Maidstone,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Winchelsey</HI> by King Charles I, Anno 1628. The Title from him devolved to his Son <HI>Thomas,</HI> after him to <HI>Heneage</HI> the late Earl; and lately to his Son and Heir, the Right Honourable <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Winchelsey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Battel</HI> is seated in a dirty part of the Country, some miles West from Winchelsey. A noted Place for the Battel fought here Oct. 14. 1066. betwixt King <HI>Harold</HI> II. and <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour; where <HI>Harold</HI> lost his Life, and <HI>William</HI> obtained the Crown of England. After which the Conquerour built an Abbey here, called <HI>Battel-Abbey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hastings,</HI> one of the Cinque-Ports, is a Town of good note and antiquity. It has
<PB N="229" REF="137"/>two Streets, extending from North to South; and in each Street, a Parish-Church. Its Ha∣ven is fed by a small River, and had once for its Defence a strong Castle seated on a Hill; which, as ruinous as it is, serves in the Night as a Direction to Sailers, by the Lights that are there placed.</P>
<P>But, besides the said Market-Towns, which are the most considerable, <HI>Pevensey</HI> and <HI>Bramber</HI> ought to find a place here, as giving the Denomination to two of the six Rapes. The first (commonly pronounced, for shortness sake, <HI>Pensey</HI>) is the very Harbour, where <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour</HI> landed from Normandy, with 896 Ships, such as they were in those Times.</P>
<P><HI>Buckhurst,</HI> a Town in the North-East Parts of this County, is of some Note, for gi∣ving the Title of Earon to the Earl of <HI>Dor∣set.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, this County (now being in the Diocese of <HI>Chichester</HI>) made up with Surrey the Kingdom of the <HI>South-Saxons,</HI> and its In∣habitants were part of the <HI>Regni,</HI> as the Ro∣mans called them.</P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 24 Members of Parlia∣ment.

<P><HI>WARWICKSHIRE,</HI> an Inland County, is bounded on the <HI>East</HI> by the Counties of Leicester and Northampton; on the <HI>West,</HI> by Worcestershire; on the <HI>North,</HI> by Staffordshire; on the <HI>South,</HI> by the Counties of Oxford, Glocester, and Worcester.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, is some∣thing less than 40 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, about 30. The Whole divided into sive <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 158 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 15 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>Here both the <HI>Air</HI> is wholsom, and the <HI>Soil</HI> rich, especially the South Parts of it, called <HI>Feldon.</HI> Which affords rich Meadows, feeds store of Sheep and Cattle, and is exceeding grateful to the Husbandman in its Crops of Corn. The North Parts, formerly called <HI>Arden,</HI> and since <HI>Woodland,</HI> from its great plenty of Woods (though at this time much wasted by reason of its Iron Mines) are not altogether so∣fruitful as the Southern Parts.</P>
<PB N="231" REF="138"/>
<P>It is generally well watered with fresh Streams; the principal of which is the <HI>Avon,</HI> which with many windings and turnings runneth through the Country, and falls at last into the Severn.</P>
<P><HI>Warwick,</HI> the Shire-Town, from whence the County took its Name, bears from London North-West, and is distant therefrom 70 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Buckingham</HI> 44 miles, as you may see in Buckingham∣shire; from thence to <HI>Banbury,</HI> 10; to <HI>Kyne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> 8 more; and to <HI>Warwick,</HI> 8 more.</P>
<P>'Tis seated on the Banks of the River <HI>Avon,</HI> over which it has a well compact Stone-Bridge. A Town adorned with very fair Houses, spacious and well ordered Streets, with a fine Market-house of free-Stone, sustained by seve∣ral Pillars. It contains two fair Parish-Churches, of which S. Maries is the chief. Here is also, for the Education of Youth, a free School; and, for decay'd Gentlemen, a well indowed Hospital. But the chief Beauty of it, as heretofore so now, is a most stately and magnificent Castle, the Seat of Sir <HI>Fulk Grevill,</HI> the late Lord <HI>Brooks,</HI> by whom it was repaired at his great cost and charges. In short, this Town injoy's a good Trade, chiefly for Mault; and the rather as being the Place where the Assizes and general Ses∣sions for the County are kept. Its Market, which is kept on Saturdays, is great, and well furnished with all sorts of Provisi∣ons.</P>
<P>But that which has added the most Lustre to this Town is the honourary Titles where∣with it has been dignify'd for several Ages. Of Earl, first in the person of <HI>Henry de New∣burg,</HI> Created Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> by Wisliam
<PB N="232" REF="139"/>the Conquerour, Anno 1076; and continued in five more of his name, viz. <HI>Roger, Wil∣liam, Waleran, Henry,</HI> and <HI>Thomas de Newburg.</HI> From whom it passed through several Fami∣lies, either by Marriage or Bloud allied to the former. Till at last the Title of Earl was by King Henry VI, turned into that of Duke in the person of <HI>Henry Beauchamp,</HI> who was made and crowned King of the Isles of <HI>Wight, Jersey,</HI> and <HI>Garnsey,</HI> and soon after created Duke of <HI>Warwick.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true the Title of Duke went no fur∣ther, and that of Earl was renewed in the person of <HI>Richard Nevil,</HI> who married <HI>Ann</HI> the Duke's Sister. From him it went to <HI>George,</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> who married <HI>Ann</HI> Daughter of <HI>Richard Nevil;</HI> and from <HI>George,</HI> to <HI>Edward Plantagenet,</HI> his Son. From these it came to two <HI>Dud eys</HI> successively, to wit <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Ambrose,</HI> descended from the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Richard Beauchamp,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI> And in the Year 1618. King James I. conferred it upon <HI>Robert,</HI> Lord <HI>Rich</HI> of <HI>Leeze;</HI> in whose Line it con∣tinued, till <HI>Charles</HI> his great Grandson died without Issue. Upon whose Death, <HI>Robert Rich</HI> Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> his Cousin german, succeeded in the Earldom of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and so injoy'd both Titles. Which fell by his Death to his Son, the Right Honourable <HI>Edward Rich,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>War∣wick.</HI></P>
<P>Near Warwick is a Cliff, most delectably seated among Groves and fresh Streams; and called <HI>Guy-Cliff,</HI> from the Hercules of England, <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Warwick.</HI> Who, having left off his noble and valiant Exploits, betook himself (as the Story say's) to this Place, where he
<PB N="233" REF="139"/>led a kind of Hermetical Life, and built a Chappel wherein he was interred.</P>
<P>But, though Warwick be the County-Town, and a considerable Place upon other accounts; yet here is another of greater im∣portance, which therefore doth deserve a par∣ticular Description in this place, before we proceed to the List of the Market-Towns. And that is</P>
<P><HI>Coventry,</HI> a City so called from an old Con∣vent (or Monastery) founded by King Ca∣nute. It stands upon a small Stream, called <HI>Sherborn,</HI> which joyning with another Stream runs not far from thence into the River Avon. 'Tis a fair, neat, and large City; beautify'd with handsom Houses, and spacious Streets, besides a Cross of curious Workmanship, and its two Churches of St. Michael and of the Holy Trinity that are loftily built. It was formerly begirt with a fine Wall, with 13 Gates giving entrance into the City; and what with the Convent and the translating the See Episcopal from Lichsield hither it grew exceeding rich and wealthy. 'Tis true now it has neither Convent nor Epis∣copal See, more than in the Ruin and Title; and yet it does still continue its old Wealth, being the best City for Trade in all these Parts, and more than ordinarily frequented for an Inland Town. Among other its Ma∣nufactures, here are great quanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of Cloths made and vended. And its Market for Pro∣visions is kept on Fridays.</P>
<P>It belonged once unto the Earls of Chester, and after wards by many Conveniances to John of Eltham Earl of Cornwal, whereby it be∣came annexed to that Earldom. Nor did it lose any thing, but rather gain much, by
<PB N="234" REF="140"/>that Annexation; Henry the VI, laying un∣to it several adjacent Towns and Villages, and making it with them a County Corporate, clearly distinct from that of Warwick. Thus Coventry, though within the Confines of War∣wickshire, became exempted from its Juris∣diction. And, in the very first Year of the Reign of William the Conquerour, it was ho∣noured with the Title of an Earldom in the Person of <HI>Edwin</HI> a Saxon, with whom the Title died, and lay buried till the Reign of King James I, when <HI>George Villiers</HI> (the late Duke of Buckingham's Father) was created Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Coventry,</HI> Anno 1623.</P>

<P>Among which <HI>Stratford,</HI> seated upon the A∣von, is one of the prsncipal; it being a good Town, well inhabited, and driving a good Trade of Malt. It contains two Parish Chur∣ches, and has over the River a fair Stone∣bridge with several Arches.</P>
<P><HI>Tamworth</HI> stands part in this County, and part in Staffordshire, where you will find it described.</P>
<P><HI>Aulcester</HI> is seated on the Confluence of the Alne and the Arrow, and not far from their fall into the Avon; <HI>Shipton,</HI> on the Stower;
<PB N="235" REF="140"/><HI>Coleshill,</HI> on the Cole; <HI>Kyneton,</HI> on a small River that runs into the Avon; <HI>Rugby,</HI> upon the Avon; <HI>Nun-Eaton,</HI> and <HI>Atherston,</HI> near the Auker; <HI>Henley,</HI> on the Alne; and <HI>Bromicham,</HI> on the Rea. Among which <HI>Henley</HI> is called <HI>Henley in Arden,</HI> to distinguish it from <HI>Henley</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bromicham</HI> is a large and well built Town, very populous, and much resorted unto; par∣ticularly noted, few years ago, for the coun∣terfeit Groats made here, and from hence dispersed all over the Kingdom. It drives a great Trade of Iron and Steel Wares, Saddles, and Bridles; which find good vent at London, Ireland, and other Parts.</P>
<P>But, besides those Market-Towns, there are three Places, <HI>Shughury, Lemington,</HI> and <HI>Menham Regis,</HI> of note for some particular Things. The first, for the <HI>Astroits,</HI> or Star-Stones, found about it. <HI>Lemington,</HI> for two Springs of Wa∣ter that issue out there within a stride of each other; but of different taste and ope∣ration, the one being fresh, and the other salt, though at a great distance from the Sea. <HI>Menham Regis,</HI> for a Spring, the Water where∣of looks and tasts like Milk. If drunk with Salt, it loosens; if with Sugar, it binds the Body. Said to be Sovereign against the Stone, good to cure green Wounds, Ulcers, and Im∣posthumes, and apt to turn Wood into Stone.</P>
<P>To conclude, this County (which formerly was part of the Kingdom of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Cornavii,</HI> as the Romans called them) is now in the Diocese of <HI>Lichsield.</HI></P>
<PB N="236" REF="141"/>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but four Members to sit in Parliament; Viz. 2 by <HI>Warwick,</HI> and 2 by <HI>Coventry.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="county">
<HEAD>Westmor∣land.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WESTMORLAND,</HI> one of the worst Counties in England, lies in the North-West; and is called <HI>Westmorland,</HI> as lying a∣mong Moors and Fells (or high Hills) for the most part unmanured.</P>
<P>'Tis bounded <HI>on the East</HI> with Yorkshire, and the Bishoprick of Darham; <HI>on the West</HI> and <HI>North,</HI> with Cumberland; and <HI>on the South,</HI> with Lancashire. Which last does so interfere with <HI>Westmorland,</HI> along the Sea-Coast, that this County has but one Corner to peep out upon the Sea; which is about the Place where the <HI>Ken</HI> falls into it.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, about 35 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, about 25. The Whole divided into four <HI>Wards,</HI> called <HI>Kendale, Lensdale, East,</HI> and <HI>West Wards.</HI> Wherein are contained 26 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 8 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>This County is very hilly, there being two several Ridges of high Hills, that cross the Country as far as Cumberland. However it has, especially in the Southern Parts, many fruitfull Valleys, with good Arable, Meadow, and Pasture-Grounds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Air,</HI> by reason those Hills and the Northern Situation of the Country, is very sharp and piercing, and not so subject to the Fogs as many other Counties. Whereby the People are very healthfull, free from strange and infectious Diseases, and commonly live to a great Age.</P>
<PB N="237" REF="141"/>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> this County is very well watered. The principal of which are the <HI>Eden,</HI> the <HI>Can,</HI> or <HI>Ken,</HI> the <HI>Lon,</HI> and the <HI>Ea∣mon.</HI> The <HI>Can,</HI> of some note for its two Cataracts, or Water-falls, near <HI>Kendall,</HI> where the Waters descend with a great fall and noise. From which the Country-people have made this Observation, that when the North Water∣fall sounds clearer and louder than the other, 'tis a certain presage of fair Weather. But, when the other does so, they expect rainy Weather.</P>
<P>Here are also two noted <HI>Lakes,</HI> or Meers, the one called <HI>Ʋlles Water,</HI> and the other <HI>Winder</HI> (or <HI>Wimander</HI>) Meer; the first bordering both upon Cumberland and Westmorland, and the last upon this County and Lancashire, where you will find it described.</P>
<P><HI>Kendall,</HI> or <HI>Candale,</HI> the Shire Town, from whence one of the Wards (or Divisions) has the Name of <HI>Kendall</HI> Ward, bears from Lon∣don North-West and by North, and is distant therefrom 201 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> 181 miles, the particulars whereof you may see in <HI>Lancastire;</HI> and from Lancaster to <HI>Kendall,</HI> 14.</P>
<P>It is seated in a Dale, on the River <HI>Ken,</HI> whence it had the Name; built in the man∣ner of a Cross, two long and broad Streets thwarting one another, besides some by-Streets. The same is a rich, populous, and well-traded Town; especially for the making of woolen Cloth, Druggets, Serges, Hats, and worsted Stockings, whereby the poor people are im∣ployed, and the adjacent Parts inriched. Over the River it has two fair Stone-Bridges; besides another of Wood, which leads to the Ruins of a Castle, the Birth-place of Queen
<PB N="238" REF="142"/>Catherine, the sixth Wife to King Henry VIII. Here is a fair and large Church, to which (as the Parish-Church) belong 12 Chappels of Ease. And by the Church-yard stands a Free-School, being a large Building, well in∣dowed with good Exhibitions for poor Scho∣lars, going from hence to Queens Colledge in Oxford. Here are also in this Town seven Companies, viz. the Mercers, Shearmen, Cordwainers, Tanners, Glovers, Taylors, and Pewterers, having their respective Halls for managing their Concerns. And, for Pro∣visions, here is a great Market, which is kept on Saturdays.</P>
<P>Lastly, this Town is an ancient Barony. Noted besides for giving the Title of an Earl to <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> Regent of France; and to <HI>John de Foix,</HI> created Earl hereof by King Henry VI.</P>

<P>Among which <HI>Appleby, Kirby Stephens, Burgh,</HI> and <HI>Orton</HI> are in East Ward; <HI>Kirby Lonsdale,</HI> and <HI>Burton,</HI> in Lonsdale Ward; <HI>Ambleside,</HI> in Kendale Ward.</P>
<P><HI>Appleby,</HI> the <HI>Abellaba</HI> of the ancient Ro∣mans, is memorable for its Antiquity. 'Tis pleasantly seated on the Banks of the River <HI>Eden,</HI> over which' it has a Stone-Bridge; and does chiefly consist of one broad Street, ri∣sing from North to South with an easy as∣cent. In the upper Part of it stands a Castle
<PB N="239" REF="142"/>once of good Strength, in the nether end the Church, and not far from it a free School. In the East side of the Street leading to the Castle is an Amls-House (or Hospital) found∣ed and liberally indowed by the Lady Clifford. Where, about the Year 1652, she placed a deceased Minister's Wife, with her 12 Daugh∣ters, whereof eleven Widows, and the twelfth a maimed Maid. She also purchased Lands (which she settled upon Feoffees in Trust) for the Repairing of the Church then very ruinous, the School-House, the Moot (or Town) Hall, and the Bridge, as Occasion re∣quired. In this Town the Assizes and Bessions are usually held.</P>
<P><HI>Kirby Lonsdale,</HI> that is, the Church-Town in <HI>Lonsdale,</HI> is seated on the Banks of the Ri∣ver <HI>Lon,</HI> in the pleasant and rich Vale of <HI>Lons∣dale,</HI> towards Lancashire. A large, and well∣built Town, well inhabited and resorted unto, being the greatest Town in the County, ex∣cept <HI>Kendale.</HI> Beautified with a fair Church, and a large Stone-Bride, and driving a good Trade for Cloth. This Place gives Name to one of the four Divisions of the County, from hence called <HI>Lonsdale Ward,</HI> of some note besides, for the many deep and hollow Caves near it.</P>
<P><HI>Kirby Stephens,</HI> a goodly Town, is seated in East ward, near the Skirts of the Hills which sever this County from Yorkshire. Beautified with a fair Church, and much improved by the Trade of making Stockings. Near this Town is <HI>Wharton-Hall,</HI> a Seat belonging to the Lord <HI>Wharton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Burton,</HI> an indifferent Town, stands in a Valley, near the great Hill called <HI>Farleton-Knot-Hill.</HI> And <HI>Orton,</HI> among the Heaths, is so
<PB N="240" REF="143"/>destitute of Wood, that the people say, they han't so much as a Stick to hang a Dog on.</P>
<P>I pass by the other Towns, as inconside∣rable, to take notice of the Stone-Cross upon <HI>Stainmore-Hill,</HI> a Hill so called for its being exceeding stony, <HI>Stain</HI> in the North being the Word used for a Stone. The Cross said to be erected upon a Peace concluded between William the Conquerour and Malcolm King of Scotland, with the Arms of the King of En∣gland on the South-side, and those of the King of Scotland on the North-side. Which served for a Boundary, as the Case stood then, be∣twixt the two Kingdoms.</P>
<P>In the North-West Parts, at the joyning of the River Eamont with the Lowther, is <HI>Whin∣feld Forest,</HI> and hard by it, <HI>Brougham-Castle,</HI> which by the Coyns &amp;c. that have been there digged up seems to have been a Place of good account in the time of the Romans.</P>
<P>By the High-Way side, leading between Lowther and Eamont Bridges, is a large Circle of Ground with a fair Plain in the midst. Which the Country-people give out to be the Place made use of by the Knight of the Round Table for their Tilts and Turnaments, there being two opposite Passes to make their Approaches in. And accord∣ingly they call it <HI>King Arthur's Table.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Shap,</HI> a great Parish, stood the only Abbey in this County, founded by <HI>Thomas</HI> Son of <HI>Jospatrick,</HI> in the Reign of Henry I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and seated near the River <HI>Lowther.</HI> Not far from which is a Well, or Fountain, which (<HI>Euripus</HI>-like) ebbs and flow's many tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; in a day.</P>
<PB N="241" REF="143"/>
<P>In the same Place are <HI>Stones</HI> like Pyra∣mids, some of them 9 foot high and 14 thick, pitched directly in a Row for a mile to∣gether, and placed at equal distances from each other.</P>
<P>On the Banks of the Lowther is <HI>Lowther-Hall,</HI> the Seat of Sir <HI>John Lowther</HI> Baronet. Whose Family has there flourished so long a time, that they reckon 30 Descents lineally from Father to Son, and the greatest part of 'em Knights. Neither do's the House only carry the Name of the Family, but also the Park belonging to it, the Parish, and (which is remarkable) the very River, with the Bridge over it.</P>
<P>To conclude, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of the <HI>Northumbers,</HI> and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> as the Ro∣mans called them) stands now divided betwixt the Dioceses of <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Carlisle.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Members of Parlia∣ment, and <HI>Appleby</HI> has the Right of Electi∣on.</P>
<P>As for honourary Titles, this County be∣gan to be dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom in the Reign of Richard II. By whom <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> Lord of <HI>Raby,</HI> and Earl Marshal, was created Earl of <HI>Westmorland,</HI> Anno 1398. Which Title continued in his Family almost 200 years, till it failed by the Death of <HI>Charles Nevil,</HI> in the Year 1584. But it was revived by King James I. in the person of <HI>Francis Fane,</HI> eldest Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> descended from the said <HI>Nevils;</HI> who was treated Earl of <HI>Westmorland,</HI> and Baron of <HI>Burghersh,</HI> Anno 1624.

<HEAD>Wilishire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WILTSHIRE,</HI> an Inland County, is bounded <HI>on the East</HI> with Barkshire and Hamp∣shire; <HI>on the West,</HI> with Somersetshire; <HI>North∣ward,</HI> by Glocestershire; and <HI>Southward,</HI> by Dorsetshire.</P>
<P>Called <HI>Wiltshire</HI> from <HI>Wilton,</HI> once the chief Town of it; as this is from the River <HI>Willy,</HI> upon which it is seated.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, at least 40 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, 30. The Whole divided into 29 <HI>Hun∣dreds,</HI> wherein 304 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 23 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>A Country not only pleasant and delight∣som, but withall very plentifull. Its Northern Part, called <HI>North Wiltshire,</HI> has very pleasant Hills, and well cloathed with Woods. The <HI>Southern Parts</HI> are more even, and yield plenty both of Grass and Corn. But the <HI>Middle Parts,</HI> called the Plains, are most scant of Corn. Yet as they are wonderfull large and spacious, reaching round about to the Horizon, they feed such innumerable Flocks of Sheep, that the Inhabitants find a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much profit by their Fleece, and the gainful Trade of Cloathing, as others do by their more fertile Grounds.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> here is the <HI>Isis,</HI> which with the <HI>Tame</HI> makes up the Thames. The <HI>Kennet</HI> which runs Westward from this County through Barkshire into the Thames. The <HI>Avon</HI> (a Name common to many English Ri∣vers) which runs from North to South, and then bending its Course to the Westward fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the Severn not far from Bristol. Ano∣ther
<PB N="243" REF="144"/><HI>Avon,</HI> which takes its Course Southward, and having washed Salisbury runs on through Hampshire, where it falls near Christchurch into the Sea. The <HI>Willy</HI> and the <HI>Nadder,</HI> which joyning together into one Stream at <HI>Wilton,</HI> near Salisbury, fall there into the Avon. Besides several lesser Streams, among which is the <HI>Deverill,</HI> which runs a mile under Ground.</P>
<P>Now, before I proceed any further in my usual Method, it will not be improper to take notice in this Place of two Remarkable Things in this County, viz. the <HI>Wansdike,</HI> and <HI>Stone-henge.</HI></P>
<P>The first is a Dike running for many miles from West to East in the midst of this Shire, and which (according to the vulgar Opinion) was cast up by the Devil upon a Wednesday, from whence the Name of <HI>Wans∣dike.</HI> But, as Cambden observeth, it was ra∣ther made by the West-Saxons, for the di∣viding of their Kingdom from that of the Mercians; this being the Place where they usually fought, in order to stretch the Bounds of their Dominions.</P>
<P><HI>Stone-henge,</HI> the greater Wonder of the two, and indeed the most admirable Rarity this Island affords, is a stupendious Piece of Work. It consists of huge Stones, standing upright in three Ranks round like a Crown, and laid overthwart one another; some of which are 28 foot high, and 7 broad. Now the Question is, how these Stones came hither. For the whole Country round for some miles hardly affords a Stone, either great or small; and these seem too vast to be brought hi∣ther by Wagon, Cart, or any other Arti∣fice. Cambden therefore is of Opinion, that
<PB N="244" REF="145"/>they were made there by Art, of pure Sand and some unctuous Cement, the Ancients having had the Art of making Stone. Thus the Cesterns of Rome were made of Sand digged out of the Ground, which with the strongest kind of Lime wrought together be∣came so hard, that they seemed Stones.</P>
<P><HI>Salisbury,</HI> the chief Place of this County, is reckoned 70 miles West-South-West from London, thus. From London to <HI>New Brent∣ford,</HI> 8 miles; thence to <HI>Stanes,</HI> 7; to <HI>Hart∣ley-row,</HI> 16 more; from thence to <HI>Basing∣stoke,</HI> 8; thence to <HI>Whitchurch,</HI> 10; to <HI>Ando∣ver,</HI> 6 more; and from Andover to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> 15.</P>
<P>This is the City otherwise called <HI>New Sarum,</HI> raised out of an old one known to the Romans by the Name of <HI>Sorbiodunum,</HI> which was drily seated on a great Eminence, being a Place only designed for Strength. Yet it was for some time honoured with an Epis∣copal See, and a fair Cathedral. As to the present City, 'tis pleasantly seated among se∣veral Rivers, whose Streams do commodi∣ously water most of the Streets; and almost incompassed with open Fields and Plains, which take their Name from it. In which Plains, about 6 miles distance, is to be seen the <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> as before described. In short, this City for fair Buildings is inferiour to none, and transcends all others for the benefit of Water, almost every Street having a River running through the midst thereof, among which the <HI>Avon</HI> is the principal. The Streets are large and spacious, accommodated with a fine Market-Place, and adorned with a fair Building, the Town-Hall. But the greatest Ornament of this City, and indeed one of
<PB N="245" REF="145"/>the principal Ornaments of England, is the Cathedral, a most stately and magnificent Church. Which, being begun by <HI>Richard Poore</HI> Bishop of this See, and finished in the Year 1258. by <HI>Bridport,</HI> the third Bishop from him, was dedicated to the honour of the Blessed Virgin. This Church has 12 Gates, 52 Windows, and 365 Pillars great and small; the first answering to the Number of Months, the second to that of the Weeks, and the third to the Number of Days, in the Year. Its Steeple has a lofty Spire, which proudly shews it self from a great distance. And (which is remarkable) an Imperial Crown stood at the very top of all, which by a sudden Gust of Wind was thrown down to the Ground at the very time when the late King James was at Salisbury, in order to oppose the Prince of Orange's Forces coming this way from the West. Which two days after was followed by his Desertion of that Place, and soon after by the Desertion of the Crown and Government.</P>
<P>Moreover, this City has been for several Ages honoured with the Title of an Earldom, 1. in the persons of <HI>Patrick</HI> and <HI>William D'Ev∣reux,</HI> successively. 2.

<P>Among which <HI>Marlborough</HI> (or <HI>Marleburgh</HI>) is, next to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> the most considerable. Town in this County. The Town called an∣ciently <HI>Cunetio</HI> in <HI>Antonine's Itinerarium,</HI> as the River Kennet was upon which it stands; but by the Normans, in whose Time this Town revived out of the Ruins of the old, it was named <HI>Marleburgh,</HI> as being seated in a chalky Soil, which in some Places is still call∣ed by the name of Marl. A Town stretched out from East to West upon the ascent of a Hill, watered by the Kennet, not far from the head of it; and having the conveniency both of a Forest and Chase in its Neighbour∣hood, the first called <HI>Savernake-Forest,</HI> and the
<PB N="247" REF="146"/>other <HI>Aldburn Chase.</HI> It had once a Castle belonging unto John, surnamed <HI>Sans Terre,</HI> who afterwards was King of England. The Castle still famous in our Law-Books for a Parliament there held in the Reign of King Henry III. in which were made the Statutes from hence called of <HI>Marleburgh,</HI> for the sup∣pressing of Tumults. But King Charles 1. at this Coronation made it yet more notable, in making it the Honour, as it was the Neigh∣bour, of <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Ley,</HI> Lord Treasurer, created by that King Earl of <HI>Marlbourough</HI> An∣no 1625. Which Title continued in three Persons more of his Name and Family; and, since the late Revolution, was conferred by our present King upon the Right Honourable <HI>John Churchill,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> This Town has suffered very much by the fre∣quent Misfortune of Fire, under which it groans to this day.</P>
<P>Near unto this Place is a Village called <HI>Rockley,</HI> from divers Stones like Rocks pitcht up on end. Among which there sometimes breaks forth a violent Stream of Water, call∣ed <HI>Hungersbourn</HI> by the Country-people, by whom 'tis reputed as the fore-runner of a Dearth.</P>
<P><HI>Malmesbury,</HI> another good Town, stands in the North-West Parts of the County, plea∣santly seated on a Hill, near the Spring of the River <HI>Avon,</HI> over which it has six Bridges, being almost incircled with that River.</P>
<P><HI>Chippenham</HI> and <HI>Bradford</HI> are also seated on the Avon; and <HI>Troubridge,</HI> near it; <HI>Amers∣bury,</HI> or <HI>Ambresbury,</HI> (commonly pronounced <HI>Ambsbury</HI>) on the other Avon, near the <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> and but 6 miles North of Salis∣bury.
<PB N="248" REF="147"/>Upon which River, near the Con∣fines of Hampshire, you will find also the Town called <HI>Downton,</HI> or <HI>Duncton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Calne</HI> is situate on a River so called, which runs from East to West into the Bristol Avon. This Town is noted for the Provin∣cial Synod held here in the Year 977, to determine the hot Disputes in those Times between the Monks and the Priests concern∣ing Celibacy. But, whilst they were debat∣ing the Matter in hand, the Convocation-house suddenly fell down; by which Fall several were slain, and many cruelly wounded.</P>
<P><HI>Wilton</HI> is seated between two Rivers, the Willy Northward, and the Nadder Southward. From the first it took its Denomination, as the whole County from <HI>Wilton.</HI> Once the chief Town thereof, and a Bishops See, ho∣noured with the Residence of nine several Bishops. But by translating the See to Salisbu∣ry, and carrying thither withall the Thorough∣fare into the West-Country, which before was here, it fell by little and little to decay. So that it is at present but a mean Town. Yet still a Borough-Town, the Place where the Knights of the Shire are chosen, and where the Sheriff keeps his monthly County-Courts.</P>
<P><HI>Werminster,</HI> of old <HI>Verlucio,</HI> a Town in for∣mer Time of very good account, is seated at the Springs of the River Willy, otherwise called Willybourn.</P>
<P><HI>Westbury</HI> and <HI>Devizes</HI> are two Borough-Towns, that is, such Towns as fend Burgesses to Par∣liament. The first situate on the Broke, a small River that falls into the Avon; <HI>Devizes,</HI> at the very head of another Stream bearing the Name of the Town, which likewise do's emp∣ty it self into the Avon.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="147"/>
<P>I pass by the rest as Inconsiderable, to take notice of <HI>Clarendon;</HI> a fine spacious Park lying near to and Eastward of Salisbury. 'Tis seated upon a Hill, on which stand twenty Groves, severally inclosed, and each a mile in compass. Adorned in Times past with a Royal House, which in process of time is faln∣to ruin. But more remarkable for that in the Reign of Henry the Second, Anno 1164, here was made a certain Recognition and Re∣cord of the Customs and Liberties of the Kings of England before the Prelates and Peers of the Kingdom, for the avoiding Dis∣sentions between the Clergy, the Judges, and Barons of the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lm. Which Act was called <HI>The Constitutions of Clarendon,</HI> whereof so many as the Pope approved have been set down in the Tomes of the Councils, and the rest omitted. But that which has added more lustre to <HI>Clarendon</HI> is its being Dignify'd with the Title of an Earldom; first in the person of <HI>Edward Hyde,</HI> sometime Lord Chancellour of England, who was created Viscount <HI>Corn∣bury</HI> in Oxfordshire, and Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> by King Charles II, Anno 1661. Upon whose Death at Rouen in Normandy Dec. 19th, 1674, he was succeeded in his Title by his eldest Son <HI>Henry Hyde,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Clarendon.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Belgae,</HI> as the Romans called them) is now in the Diocese of <HI>Salisbury.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are chosen, besides the two Knights of the Shire, no less than 32 Mem∣bers to fit in Parliament, Viz. two out of each of these following Towns, <HI>New Sarum</HI>
<PB N="250" REF="148"/>or <HI>Salisbury, Wilton, Downton, Hindon, West∣bury, Heytesbury, Calne, the Devizes, Chippen. ham, Malmesbury, Cricklade, Great Bedwin, Lur∣gershal, Old Sarum, Wootton Basset,</HI> and <HI>Marl∣borough.</HI></P>
<P>But we must not omit the famous <HI>Caves,</HI> that ly in the edge of this Shire, between Luckington and great Badminton. They are about nine in Number, all lying in a Row, but of different Dimensions. The Manner of them is two long Stones set upon the sides, and broad Stones on the top to cover them. The least of these Caves is 4 foot broad, and some of them 9 or 10 foot long. They are credibly thought, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be <HI>Gyants Caves,</HI> as the Country-people give it out, but ra∣ther the Tombs of some heroick Men a∣mong the ancient Romans, Saxons, or Danes. And that which makes it so much the more probable is, that Spurs, and pieces of Armour, &amp;c. have been found there not long since by those who digged into them.</P>
<P>Lastly, this County has given the Title of an Earl to several Families; which now be∣longs to his Grace <HI>Charles Pawlet,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bolton,</HI> Marquess of <HI>Winchester,</HI> Earl of <HI>Wilt∣shire,</HI> and Baron <HI>S. John</HI> of <HI>Basing.</HI> All which Titles, except that of Duke, devolved to him from his Ancestor <HI>William Pawlet;</HI> Created Earl of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and afterward Marquess of <HI>Winchester,</HI> by King Edward VI. And that of Duke was lately conferred upon him by his present Majesty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of</HI> Worcestershire, <HI>and</HI> Yorkshire.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="county">
<HEAD>Worcester∣shire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WORCESTERSHIRE,</HI> an In∣land County, is bounded <HI>on the East</HI> by Warwickshire, and part of Glocestershire; <HI>on the West,</HI> by Hereford∣shire, and part of Shropshire; <HI>on the North,</HI> by Staffordshire; and <HI>on the South,</HI> by Glo∣cestershire.</P>
<P>It contains in <HI>Length,</HI> from North to South, about 35 miles; in <HI>Breadth,</HI> from East to West, about 25. The Whole divided into se∣ven <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 152 <HI>Parishes,</HI> and 11 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI></P>
<P>A County of an <HI>Air</HI> so temperate, and a <HI>Soil</HI> so fortunate, that it gives place to none about it, either for health or plenty. Abun∣dant certainly it is in all sorts of Fruits this Climate can afford, Pears and Cherries espe∣cially, insomuch that here is made abun∣dance of Perry. Here are also many Salt-pits, called <HI>Wiches,</HI> which yield excellent Salt, and such as for whiteness and hardness imitateth Loaf-Sugar.</P>
<P>'Tis true this County is pretty full of Hills, but such Hills as are not barren, yielding plen∣ty of Wood and store of Pasturage; whilst the Valleys on the other side feed abundance of Cattle, and bear good Crops of Corn.</P>
<PB N="252" REF="149"/>
<P>Through these Valleys run so many Rivers, that few Counties are better watered with fresh Streams. Here we meet again that noble River, the <HI>Severn,</HI> which runs quite through the Country from North to South, and affords here great store of fresh-Water Lampreys. Besides the <HI>Avon,</HI> the <HI>Team,</HI> the <HI>Salwarp,</HI> &amp;c. which run into the Severn, and yield abundance of Fish.</P>
<P><HI>Worcester,</HI> the chief Place hereof, and from whence the County is denominated, bears from London West-North-West, and is distant therefrom near upon 90 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Oxford</HI> 47 miles, as you may see afterwards in my Description of Oxford; from thence to <HI>Chipping-Norton,</HI> 12; and to <HI>Campden,</HI> 12 more; thence to <HI>Pershore,</HI> 10; and to <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI> 6 more.</P>
<P>Pleasantly seated on the East Bank of the Severn, over which it has a fair Stone-Bridge with a Tower upon it, and thence arising with a gentle ascent affords to the upper Parts a very goodly Prospect in the Vale beneath. A City every way considerable, for Situation, neat Buildings, Number of Churches, and Wealth of the Inhabitants, by reason of their Cloth-Trade which does here flourish very much.</P>
<P>This City called by Antonine and Pto∣lomy <HI>Branonium,</HI> and by the Romans <HI>Vigor∣nia,</HI> is said to have been first built by the Romans, the better to secure themselves from the Britains beyond the Severn. But in the time of King Canute, it suftered much from the Danes, and afterwards by frequent Con∣flagrations, which laid it almost waste, and despairing of a Recovery. Yet it rose at last out of its Ashes, and by degrees so impro∣ved as to contain at present nine Parish-Churches,
<PB N="253" REF="149"/>besides the Cathedral. This is a stately Structure, in whose Quire are the Monuments of King John in white Marble, and of Arthur Prince of Wales, and Son to Henry VII. in blak Jeat. The Castle I shall say nothing of, as having nothing left of it but the Name and Ruins.</P>
<P>But <HI>Worcester</HI> is particularly memorable for the Battel fought there Sept. 3. 1651. be∣twixt the late King Charles and the Par∣liament Forces, wherein the King's Army was totally defeated. So that he was fain to shift for himself, and to wander six Weeks in Disguise about the Country, till he was at laft transported from a Creek near Sho∣ram in Sussex to <HI>Feccam</HI> near <HI>Havre de Grace</HI> in France.</P>
<P>Lastly, this City has a long time given the Title of Earl, and at last that of Marquess, to the Family of the <HI>Somersets,</HI> extracted by the <HI>Beauforts</HI> from <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt.</HI> For <HI>Charles Somerset,</HI> who was created Earl of <HI>Worcester</HI> by King Henry VIII, was base Son of <HI>Henry Beaufort,</HI> the 8th Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> beheaded in Edward the fourth's Reign.</P>
<P>Lastly this City keeps 3 Markets a Week, viz. Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.</P>

<PB N="254" REF="150"/>
<P>Among which <HI>Bewdley</HI> and <HI>Ʋpton</HI> stand upon the Severn, the first in the North, the other in the South Parts of this County. <HI>Bewdley,</HI> near the Forest of Wire, was in former time a Place of great delight, and of good account in the Reign of Henry VII, where he built a retiring House for Prince Arthur, and called it <HI>Ticken-Hall.</HI> The Town at present is neat and well-built, and injoys a good Trade for Barley, Malt, Caps, and Leather. <HI>Ʋpton</HI> is also a well-built Town, and was of great account in the time of the Romans. Not far from which are the <HI>Malvern-Hills,</HI> and opposite to 'em Eastwards the <HI>Bredon-Hills.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Evesham</HI> (or <HI>Evesholm</HI>) and <HI>Pershore</HI> are both seated on the Avon, over which they have each a Bridge. The first esteemed the best Town in the County next to Worcester, containing two or three Parish-Churches, and driving a good Trade, of Stockings especially. The o∣ther a great Thorough-fare betwixt London and Worcester, but somewhat decayed in its Trade, since the Dissolution of its ancient Abbey.</P>
<P><HI>Droitwich</HI> and <HI>Bromes-grove</HI> are both situate on the Banks of the Salwarp. The first no∣ted for its Salt-pits, and the last for its Clo∣thing Trade. Not far from Droitwich is <HI>Fakenham-Forest</HI> and <HI>Norton-Wood,</HI> which stand commodious for the Salt-Works, to supply them with Wood for the boyling the brine in their Coppers.</P>
<P><HI>Sturbridge</HI> and <HI>Kidderminster,</HI> two goodly Towns stand both on the River Stow∣er, over which they have each a Bridge. The first is situate on a Flat, and has the accom∣modation of a Free-Shool, with a Library. <HI>Kidderminster</HI> is well inhabited, much traded unto for its Stuffs, and beautify'd with a very fair Church.</P>
<PB N="255" REF="150"/>
<P>As for <HI>Tenbury</HI> and <HI>Shipton,</HI> the first stands on the very edge of Shropshire, upon the Banks of the River Tent. And <HI>Shipton,</HI> up∣on Stower, in a slip of the County taken off from Warwickshire.</P>
<P>To conclude this Connty (now in the Dio∣cese of <HI>Worcester</HI>) was part of the ancient Kingdom of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and its Inhabitants part of the <HI>Cornavii,</HI> in the Time of the Ro∣mans.</P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, seven Members of Par∣liament. Viz. 2 by <HI>Worcester,</HI> 2 by <HI>Droitwich,</HI> 2 by <HI>Evesham,</HI> 1. by <HI>Bewdley.</HI> And so much for <HI>Worcestershire.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="county">
<HEAD>Yorkshire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>YORKSHIRE,</HI> a Maritime County, and the greatest in the whole Kingdom, is bounded <HI>Eastward</HI> by the German Ocean; <HI>Westward,</HI> by Lancashire and Westmorland; <HI>Northward,</HI> by the said Ocean, and the Bishoprick of Durham, from which parted by the River Tees; and <HI>Southward,</HI> by Lincoln, Nottingham, and Derby Shires.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Length,</HI> from East to West, is 80 miles; its <HI>Breadth,</HI> from North to South, 70. The Whole divided first into three Parts, called <HI>Ridings,</HI> viz. the <HI>East, West,</HI> and <HI>North Ri∣ding.</HI> Which together contain 26 <HI>Wapentakes</HI> or <HI>Hundreds,</HI> wherein 563 <HI>Parish-Churches,</HI> and 49 <HI>Market-Towns.</HI> A small number of Pa∣rishes for such an Extent of Ground, but that there are great many Chappels of Ease, e∣qual for bignesss and resort of people to any Parish elsewhere.</P>
<P>The <HI>East-Riding</HI> (which is by much the least of the three) takes up only that part of Yorkshire which lies between the River Der∣went
<PB N="256" REF="151"/>went and the Sea. The <HI>North-Riding</HI> takes up the North Parts as far as Westmorland. And the <HI>West-Riding,</HI> the largest of the three, is bounded on the North by the two former <HI>Ridings,</HI> on the South by the Counties of Derby, Nottingham, and Cheshire, Eastward by Lincolnshire, and Westward by Lanca∣shire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> is generally fruitfull, in a very good measure. And, (as says <HI>Speed,</HI>) if one Part thereof is stony and barren Ground, another is as fertile and richly adorned with Corn and Pasturage. If here you find it naked and destitute of Woods, in other Places you shall find it shadowed with most spacious Forests. If it be somewhere moorish, miry, and un∣pleasant, elsewhere it is as pleasant as the Eye can wish.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Rivers,</HI> here are many of good note. For, besides the <HI>Tees</HI> which parts this County from Durham, here you will find the <HI>Swale,</HI> the <HI>Youre,</HI> and the <HI>Nyd,</HI> of which the <HI>Ouse</HI> at York is a Compound. Besides the <HI>Warfe,</HI> the <HI>Are,</HI> the <HI>Calder,</HI> and <HI>Derwent,</HI> which from several Parts fall into the Ouse below York. To which add the <HI>Dun,</HI> which severs part of this County from Lincolnshire; and the <HI>Hull,</HI> which falls into the Humber at Hull. As for the <HI>Humber,</HI> which is the largest of all, it cannot be said properly to be a di∣stinct River, but rather a Compound, or a Mouth, of several Rivers joyning into one Stream, as I have already hinted in the be∣ginning of this Part.</P>
<P><HI>York,</HI> (in Latin <HI>Eboracum</HI>) the chief Place of Yorkshire, bears from London North-by-West, and is distant therefrom 150 miles; thus. From London to <HI>Huntington,</HI> 48 miles,
<PB N="257" REF="151"/>for the particulars of which I refer you to <HI>Huntingtonshire;</HI> from Huntington to <HI>Stamford,</HI> 21; to <HI>Grantham,</HI> 16 more; thence to <HI>New∣ark,</HI> 10; to <HI>Tuxford,</HI> 9 more; from Tuxford to <HI>Duncaster,</HI> 18; to <HI>Wentbridge,</HI> 7 more; thence to <HI>Tadcaster,</HI> 12; and to <HI>York,</HI> 9 more.</P>
<P>A City which, for fame and greatness, is the second City of England. It is in the <HI>North-Riding,</HI> situate on the River <HI>Ouse,</HI> which divides it into two Parts, but joyned toge∣ther by a stately Stone-Bridge. Of which two Parts, that towards the East is the most po∣pulous, the Houses standing thicker, and the Streets narrower. In general, 'tis a fair, large, and beautifull City, adorned with ma∣ny fair Buildings both publick and private, and inclosed with a strong Wall, with several Turrets upon it. A City rich and popu∣lous, well inhabited by Gentry and wealthy Tradesmen, and containing about 30 Parish-Churches and Chappels, besides its Cathedral, dedicated to St. Peter. First built by <HI>Edwyn,</HI> the first Christian King of the Northumbers Anno 627, and finished by King <HI>Oswald</HI> his next Successor but one. But, being after∣wards destroyed by Fire, and by the fury of the Danes, that which now stands was ere∣cted in the place thereof by Archbishop <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI> the 25th of this See, and after by de∣grees adorned and beautify'd by his Successors. Of that magnificent Structure, which may just∣ly put her in the first Rank of the Cathe∣drals in Europe.</P>
<P>In short, the Romans of old had this City in such great esteem, that <HI>Severus</HI> their Emperour had his Palace here, where he ended his Days. Here also, upon the Death of <HI>Fl. Va∣lerius Constantius,</HI> surnamed <HI>Chlorus,</HI> his Son
<PB N="258" REF="152"/><HI>Constantine</HI> was forthwith proclaimed Empe∣rour. Nor did this City flourish only under the Romans, for it has been of as eminent Repu∣tation in all Ages since; and in the several Turns and Changes which have befallen this Kingdom, under the Saxons, Danes, and Nor∣mans, has still preserved its ancient Lustre. Adorned it was with an Archbishops See in the time of the Britains; nor stooped it low∣er when the Saxons imbraced the Gospel. Richard II, laying unto it a little Territory on the West-side thereof, made it a County Incorporate, as our Lawyers term it; in which the Archbishops of York injoy the Right of Palatines. It is governed, as Lon∣don, by a Lord Mayor, London and York being the only Cities whose Mayors bear the Title of Lord. But not so much famed by that, as by the Title of Duke it has given to divers Princes of the Royal Bloud; and par∣ticularly to the late King James, before he came to the Crown.</P>

<P>In the <HI>East-Riding,</HI> the Town of chief note is <HI>Hull,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Kingston upon Hull,</HI> seated at the very fall of the Hull into the Humber. A Town of no great Anti∣quity, being first built by King Edward I;

<P><HI>Sheffield,</HI> upon the <HI>Dun,</HI> is a good large Town, whose Houses are built of Stone. Its Market is great for several Commodities, but Corn especially, which is much bought up here for the supply of some Parts of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and the West of Yorkshire. A Town that trades much be∣sides, by reason of the Iron Mines in these Parts, in Iron Wares, and Edge-tools, espe∣cially Knives and Blades. Whereof so anci∣ent an Author as <HI>Chaucer</HI> takes notice, speak∣ing of a Person that had a Sheafield Whittle by his side. Here is still to be seen the Rains of a Castle, one of the five which
<PB N="263" REF="154"/>were seated on this River, all within ten miles distance.</P>
<P>Lastly, this Town, with divers others, be∣longs to the Wapentake of Strafford. Which gives the Title of an Earl to the Right Ho∣nourable <HI>William Wentworth,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rotheram</HI> has a fine Stone-Bridge over the River <HI>Dun,</HI> and its Houses are also built of Stone.

In the Year 759. this Town was reduced to ashes, and lay for some time in its Ruins. But it was raised up again, with a fair Church and Steeple. And it is now a goodly Town, well accommodated with Inns for Travellers, and driving a good Trade of knit Wastcoats, Peticoats, Gloves, and Stockings.</P>
<P>But we must not omit, that of late years it became of more remark, by giving the Title of Viscount to <HI>James Hay,</HI> Baron of <HI>Sauley,</HI> Created by King James I.

<P>About 6 miles from Halifax, near the Cal∣der, and on a steep, Hill, is seated <HI>Almond∣bury,</HI> the ancient <HI>Cambodunum.</HI> A Place of great repute, when the English-Saxons first began their Regal Government. For it was then the Royal Seat, and had in it a Cathe∣dral, built by <HI>Paulinus</HI> the Apostle of these Parts. Here was also a Fort and Castle, long since reduced to ruins.</P>
<P><HI>Wakefield,</HI> on the <HI>Calder,</HI> is a large Stone∣built Town, of good Antiquity. Over the River it has a fair Stone-Bridge, upon which Edward IV. erected a stately Chappel, in remembrance of those who lost their Lives in his Quarrel. The Inhabitants of this Town are noted for their Clothing Trade.</P>

<P><HI>Skipton, Bradforth,</HI> and <HI>Pontefract,</HI> are all three seated upon so many small Streams, near their fall into the Are.

<P><HI>Pontefract,</HI> or <HI>Pomfret,</HI> is a neat Borough-Town, pleasantly seated in a dry Spot of Ground, upon a small Stream a little below the Confluence of the Warfe and the Are. Formerly strengthened with a strong and state∣ly Castle, mounted on an Ascent, and forti∣fy'd with Ditches and Bulwarks; but was de∣molished in the long Civil Wars. In this Castle it was that Richard II. was murdered, after his Resignation of the Crown. About <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Town grow's plenty of Licorish.</P>
<P><HI>Leeds,</HI> on the <HI>Are,</HI> is an ancient Town, where formerly the Kings of Northumberland <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad their Royal Pallace. And now 'tis so considerable, that it is counted one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Towns in Yorkshire. Well-inhabited it is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>specially by Clothiers, who drive a great Trade for their Cloths.</P>
<P>Near unto <HI>Snathe,</HI> a small Town, is a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountry of about 15 miles in compass, called <HI>Marsh-Land</HI> and <HI>Ditch-Marsh,</HI> which yields ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellent feeding for Cattel.</P>
<P><HI>Tadcaster,</HI> on the <HI>Warfe,</HI> is noted for two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings. Viz. the large Stone-Bridge it has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the River, and the plenty of Lime-stone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gged up in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><HI>Sherburn</HI> is seated between the Are and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arfe upon a small Stream that mixes its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aters with those of the Warfe and Ouse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here those two meet together. The Town
<PB N="266" REF="156"/>is small, but well inhabited, and has a famous Free-School. Of some note besides for its Pins, and Cherries; and for the Quarries near it, whose Stones when first taken out of the Quarries are very soft, but seasoned with Wind and Weather become very hard and durable.</P>
<P><HI>Selby,</HI> on the <HI>Ouse,</HI> is a good large Town; chiefly noted for being the Birth∣place of King Henry I.</P>
<P><HI>Ripley,</HI> on the <HI>Nyd,</HI> is but a small Market-Town. <HI>Knaresborough</HI> is much more consider∣able, being a well-built Borough-Town, and fortified with a Castle upon a ragged rough Rock. About this Town, as well as <HI>Ponte∣fract,</HI> grow's plenty of Licorish. And under it is a Well, distilled from the Rocks that hang over it, the Water whereof (say's Speed) do's turn Wood into Stone.</P>
<P><HI>Rippon,</HI> near the <HI>Youre,</HI> over which it has a Bridge, is a Place of good Antiquity.

<P><HI>Boroughbridge,</HI> on the <HI>Youre,</HI> over which it has a Stone-Bridge, is a small Borough-Town, but a great Thorough-Fare in the Northern Road. Of special note for the four huge Stones, like unto Pyramids, that stand in a direct line in three little Fields near this Town. The Country-people call them the <HI>Devil's Bolts;</HI> but Cambden is of opinion, that they were here erected by the Romans, for a Monument of some Victory obtained by them.</P>
<P>In the <HI>North-Riding,</HI> we may reckon <HI>Rich∣mond</HI> as one of the chief Places. 'Tis at least the chief of that Part of it which is called <HI>Richmondshire,</HI> containing five Wapentakes (or Hundreds) within its Jurisdiction. A Tract of Ground lying North-Westward, with rugged Rocks and swelling Mountains; whose Sides in some places bear good Grass, and the Bot∣toms underneath not unfruitful. And in the Hills themselves are found good Mines of Lead and Pit-coal. Yet there are in it many waste Places, void of Inhabitants; as <HI>Deep-Dale, Swale-Dale-Forest, Apple-Garth-Forest,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Richmond</HI> it self, 'tis seated on the North-Banks of the <HI>Swale,</HI> over which it has a Stone-Bridge. This River (which with a mighty noise runs here underneath the Town) was reputed very sacred by the ancient English, for that in it <HI>Paulinus,</HI> the first Archbishop of York, baptized in one day above ten thou∣sand Men, besides Women and Children. The Town is of a small Circuit in the Walls;
<PB N="268" REF="157"/>but, by reason of its Suburbs lying out in length, very well peopled and frequented. First built by <HI>Alane</HI> (Earl of Bretagne in France, and the first Earl of this Place) after the Entrance of the Normans. Who fenced it with a Wall, and a most strong Castle, the better to secure these Parts a∣gainst the English; and, having finished the same, gave it the Name of <HI>Richmount,</HI> as a Place equally participating of strength and beauty. As to its present state, it contains two Parish-Churches, is graced with well-built Houses, many of them of free-Stone, well inhabited by Gentry and Tradesmen, and injoys a good Trade (for an Inland Town) for Stockings chiefty, and woollen Knit Caps for Seamen.</P>
<P>The Earls of Bretagne for a long time to∣gether continued in the Title and Possession of this County; and since, it has been bestowed upon other Families. In the Year 1641. <HI>James Stewart,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> and Earl of <HI>March,</HI> was created Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> by King Charles I. <HI>Esme,</HI> his Son, succeeded him; who died young, Anno 1660. Thus the Title fell to his Cousin german, <HI>Charles</HI> Earl of <HI>Lichfield;</HI> who died without Issue Embassadour in Denmark, in the year 1672. And, within less than 3 years after, the Title was conferred by King Charles II, upon his Grace <HI>Charles Lenox,</HI> the present Duke of Richmond, his natural Son by the Dutchess of Portsmouth.</P>
<P>In this Tract also, near <HI>Middleton</HI> on the <HI>Youre,</HI> is <HI>Bolton-Castle,</HI> seated in a Park. Late∣ly honoured with the Title of a Dukedom, in the person of his Grace <HI>Charles Pawlet,</HI> the present Duke of <HI>Bolton.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Scarborough,</HI> upon the Sea, is a Place of great Strength, as well by Nature as Art. Seated on a steep Rock, with such craggy Cliffs, that it is almost Inaccessible on every side; and washed by the Sea on all parts but the West, where there is a narrow Passage, and that fenced with a strong Wall. On the top of the Rock is a fair, green, and large Plain, containing above 60 Acres of Ground, with a fresh Water Spring issuing out of the Rock. Here was formerly a stately Tower which served as a Land-Mark for Ships, but was demolished in the long Civil Wars. At this time it is fortified with a strong Castle, wherein a Garrison is kept. The Town is not very large, but well built, and well in∣habited; and, as it has a commodious Key, it injoy's a pretty good Trade. Several Ves∣sels belong unto this Town, imploy'd espe∣cially in Herring-Fishing Season, which are taken on this Coast in great plenty. This Place is also noted for its famous Spaw, which is much resorted unto. But of late, in a more particular manner, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honourable <HI>Richard Lumley,</HI> newly created Earl of <HI>Scar∣borough.</HI></P>
<P>Between this Town and Whitby to the Northward is <HI>Robin Hoods Bay,</HI> so called from <HI>Robin-Hood,</HI> that noted Robber in the Reign of Richard I. About which is found a sort of Jeat, or black Amber.</P>
<P><HI>Whitby,</HI> another Sea-Town, is commodiously seated on the River <HI>Esk,</HI> at its Influx into the Sea. A pretty neat Town, with a Bridge over the River, and driving a good Trade, chiefly for Allum and Butter. Here is a Custom-House, and great many Vessels
<PB N="270" REF="158"/>belonging to the Town. Formerly a Place of note for its Abbey, but chiefly for the Abbess thereof, <HI>S. Hilda,</HI> so famed in her time for working of Miracles. One of which Tradition tells us was her ridding this Part of the Country of Snakes which infected it much, and conjuring of them into the Sea by her fervent Prayers. Which is backed by those who aver, that at the Root of the craggy Rocks that are upon the Shore there¦ly Stones scattered here and there, naturally as round as a Bullet. In which Stones, being broken, are found stony Serpents wrapt round, but most of them headless.</P>
<P>Not far from Whitby is <HI>Mulgrave,</HI> an an∣cient Castle situate near unto the Sea, and first built in the Time of Richard II by <HI>Peter de Mauley.</HI> Who, being pleased with it, called it <HI>Mouligrace,</HI> that is, a fine Seat. But, as it proved a grievous Yoke to the neighbour In∣habitants, they nicknamed it, and called it <HI>Moultgrave,</HI> since turned into <HI>Mulgrave,</HI> by which Name it go's to this day. It continu∣ed in this Line for 7 Generations, and all of them called <HI>Peters</HI> too.

<P>Some miles West from Mulgrave Castle is a small Sea-Town, called <HI>Skeningrave;</HI> not to be omitted, were it but for the following Ac∣count of the Seal-fish. Hereabouts near unto Hunt-Cliff, at low Water, appear Rocks not far from the Shore, about which the Seal-fish come in great Sholes, and in fair and warm Weather ly sleeping and sunning themselves. But, as it has been observed, while they ly thus asleep, one of them is upon the Watch, and acts the part of a Sen∣tinel. Who, upon the appearance of any Danger, gives the Signal by flouncing into the Water, the Noise whereof awakes the rest, and so they make their escape. They are not afraid (say's my Author) of Women, but only of Men; and therefore they that catch 'em put on Womens Cloaths. If, when they are chased, they find themselves too far from the Water, their Way is with their hinder feet to fling Sand and Gravel backward in the Pursuers faces, which forces 'em sometimes to quit the Sport.</P>
<P>Some miles from this Coast to the South∣ward is a Tract of Land, called <HI>Cleveland,</HI> taking that Name (as Cambden tells us) of the Cliffs, or steep Banks, which run all along the side thereof, and at the foot of which the Country spreads it self into a fine fruit∣ful Plain. A Territory besides of a good extent, which gave the Title of an Earl to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Cleve∣land</HI> by King Charles I. But, leaving no Issue, the Title died with him, Anno 1670. King Charles II. conferred the Title of Dutchess of <HI>Cleveland</HI> upon <HI>Barbara Villiers,</HI> Daughter to the Lord Viscount <HI>Grandison</HI> who was slain in the Civil Wars, the Earl of <HI>Castlemain's</HI>

<P>In this Tract (I mean <HI>Cleveland</HI>) is an an∣cient Castle, called <HI>Danby,</HI> seated near unto a large Park, and a goodly Chase of the same Name. It belonged anciently to the Lord <HI>Latimer,</HI> and was sold (with other Lands belonging to that Family) to <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> Earl of <HI>Westmorland,</HI> who forthwith gave the same to his Son Sir <HI>George Nevil.</HI> And, not long after, King Henry VI. summoned him to the Parliament by the Name of Lord <HI>Latimer.</HI> Whose Issue male failing in Queen Eli∣zabeths Time, the Estate was divided be∣tween his two Daughters. The Castle, with the Lands adjoyning, fell to the share of <HI>Mary,</HI> Wife to <HI>Sir John Danvers</HI> of Wiltshire. By whom she got Sir <HI>Henry Danvers,</HI> Crea∣ted by King James I. Lord <HI>Danvers</HI> of <HI>Danby,</HI> and by King Charles I. Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> But he, dying without Issue, the Title lay dormant, till revived by Charles II.

<P><HI>Gisborough</HI> is pleasantly seated in a Flat, between Mulgrave and the River Tees. A mean Town to what it was, when it had its rich Abbey; but of some note however, for being the first place where Allum was made in England. Not far from which is <HI>Roseberry-Topping,</HI> a Hill Pyramid-like, serving to Sail∣ers for a Land-Mark, and being to the Coun∣try-people a certain Sign of Rain, when they see a Cloud over it.

<P><HI>New Malton, Pickering, Kirby-Moreside,</HI> and <HI>Helmley,</HI> ly all four Eastward, not far distant from each other, nor from the Sea. The first, a Borough-Town, is seated on the Banks of the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> over which it has a Stone-bridge; and contains 3 Parish Churches, being well-inhabited, and accommodated with good Inns for Travellers. Its Market on Saturdays is counted one of the best in all the County for Horses, living Cattle, Pro∣visions, and most Country-Commodities, es∣pecially Tools for Husbandry. The other three are all seated on small Rivers, which after some small Course joyn together into one Stream, and so fall into the <HI>Derwent,</HI> a little below New Malton.</P>
<P>To conclude, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and its In∣habitants Part of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> as the Ro∣mans called them,) is now in the Diocese of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 28 Members of Par∣liament;
<PB N="274" REF="160"/>Viz. Two by each of these following Towns, <HI>York, Kingston upon Hull, Knaresborough, Scarborough, Rippon, Richmond, Heydon, Borough∣bridge, Malton, Thirsk, Aldborough, Beverly, North-Allerton, Pomfret.</HI></P>
<P>And, which is remarkable, it yields at this time two <HI>Dukes,</HI> and one <HI>Dutchess,</HI> one <HI>Mar∣quess,</HI> and nine <HI>Earls.</HI> The Dukes are of <HI>Rich∣mond,</HI> and <HI>Bolton;</HI> the Dutchess, of <HI>Cleveland;</HI> the Marquess, of <HI>Halifax;</HI> the Earls, of <HI>Mulgrave, Kingston, Strafford, Craven, Burlington, Holderness, Derwentwater, Faulconberg,</HI> and <HI>Scarborough.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have compassed a very difficult Task, the Description of forty Counties, with so much variety of Matter, in so short a Compass. The Reader perhaps expects in the next place, I should give an Account of the Twelve <HI>Counties</HI> of <HI>Wales,</HI> as being In∣corporated with <HI>England,</HI> at least in point of Government. But what Union soever it may have with <HI>England,</HI> 'tis but like those remote Cities conquered by the Romans, whose Inhabitants were <HI>Civitate donati,</HI> that is, made Citizens of Rome. <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> are naturally so distinct from each other, both as to the Country and the Inhabitants, that they cannot possibly fall under the same Character. And so I lay <HI>Wales</HI> aside to present you, by way of Precapitulation, with a <HI>Table,</HI> shewing by distinct Columns the Number of <HI>Hundreds, Parishes,</HI> and <HI>Market-Towns</HI> belonging to every County of England, with the Names of the <HI>Shire-Towns.</HI> Only 'tis to be observed that, in∣stead of <HI>Hundreds,</HI> Durham is divided into <HI>Wakes;</HI> Cumberland, Westmorland, and Nor∣thumberland, into <HI>Wards.</HI> Also, that some Counties are more generally divided than into
<PB N="275" REF="160"/><HI>Hundreds;</HI> as Yorkshire, first into three <HI>Ri∣dings,</HI> Kent into five <HI>Lathes,</HI> Sussex into six <HI>Rapes,</HI> Linconshire into these three Parts, <HI>Lind∣sey, Kesteven,</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>LONDON</HI> and <HI>WEST∣MINSTER.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Joyn these two together, because conti∣guous. And, tho' they be two distinct Cities, both by their Foundation and distinct Government; yet, as they make to∣gether one compact Body, the City of West∣minster, under that Notion, is generally com∣prehended under the Name of London, and lookt upon as a Part of it. In the Descri∣ption whereof, I shall joyn and part them, as occasion shall offer.</P>
<P>My Design is not to make a long Pream∣ble about the uncertain <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>LONDON,</HI> which (as some write) was built above eleven hundred Years before the Birth of our Saviour.
<PB N="277" REF="161"/>That it is a most ancient City, is a thing past all doubt. For History tells us, that the British King <HI>Lud,</HI> above 60 Years before our Saviours Birth, repaired and improved it. The Romans, in whose Time it was an Archbishop's See, gave it the Title of <HI>Au∣gusta.</HI> And Animianus Marcellinus, who wrote near 1300 Years ago, calls it then an ancient City.</P>
<P>As for its <HI>Name,</HI> the most probable Con∣jecture in my Judgment is that of those who derive it from the British Word <HI>Llongdin,</HI> a Town of Ships.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Situation</HI> is, upon all accounts, very ad∣vantageous, whether we consider the Soil on which it stands, the River that waters it, the Fruitfulness of the Country about it, the Roads that lead into it, or its convenient Distance from the Sea.</P>
<P>The Soil is gravelly, and therefore so much the wholsomer. And, as it stands upon a gentle rising Bank, on the North-side of the River, this adds much to the healthfulness of the Place; the South-side being counted something unhealthy by reason of the Vapours the Sun draws upon it.</P>
<P>The Thames that waters it I have already described, as the chief River of England, and an excellent navigable River. This City stands where the River is cast into the form of a Crescent; and stretches it self in length along the Shore, as Cologne does upon the Rhine. Which is a great Advantage, upon several Accounts, especially to a great City First, because it ly's the more convenient for the several Uses and Benefits of the River. Se∣condly, for the Freeness of the Air; which makes it so much the healthfuller; lying open
<PB N="278" REF="162"/>to the Fields Northward, and to the River Southward. Whereas Paris, and all other Cities of an orbicular Form, ly close toge∣ther, and the middle Parts half choackt for want of Air. To which add another Conve∣niency in London by its Situation along the River, that by the Course of it one may sooner find out any Place than is possible in Paris, which is a very Labyrinth in com∣parison.</P>
<P>This River besides is full of excellent Fish, such as Barbels, Trouts, Chevins, Pearches, Smelts, Breams, Roaches, Daces, Gudgeons, Flounders, Shrimps, Eels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, after the Smelt-time is past, it yields also sweet Sal∣mons. But Carps it is scarce of, except up∣on Land-flouds, when they get out of Gen∣tlemens Ponds. Great number of Swans are daily seen upon this River. Besides a per∣petual Motion of Wherries and small Boats, above 2000 in Number, whereby 3000 Water∣men are maintained, by carrying Goods and Passengers thereon. Not counting those large Tilt-Boats, Tide-Boats, and Barges, which ei∣ther carry People, or bring Provision from most Parts of the neighbouring Coun∣ties.</P>
<P>For Navigation, no River more commodi∣ous, as may appear by a Passage in the Reign of King James I. Who, being displeas∣ed with the City, for refusing to lend him a Sum of Mony he required, threatned the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, that he would remove his Court, with all the Records of the Tower, and the Courts of Westmin∣ster-Hall, to another Place, with further expressions of his Indignation. Your Maje∣sty, answered the Lord Mayor calmly, may
<PB N="279" REF="162"/>do what you please therein, and your City of London will prove still dutifull; but she comforts her self with the Thoughts, that your Majesty will leave the Thames behind you.</P>
<P>This River besides is so Kind, that it sel∣dom indamages any Part of this City by its Overflowings. Here the highest Tides are upon a Land-floud, and the Moon at full, when sometimes it does swell over its Banks. But then Westminster, lying low, feels alone the effects of it, and that seldom further than the Cellars. Whereas the Chambers and Upper Rooms at Rome and Paris are some∣times overflowed, Rome by the Tiber, and Paris by the Seine.</P>
<P>From this River the City, by Water-En∣gines, is in many places supplied with good Water. But, to serve with Water the North Parts of the City, as the Thames does the South Parts, it has the Conveniency of an artificial River, commonly called the <HI>New River,</HI> which was begun Anno 1608, and fi∣nished in five Years time. A noble Under∣taking of Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton,</HI> who for this great Work deserves his Statue in Brass. This River he brought from Amwell and Chad∣well, two Springs near <HI>Ware</HI> in Hartfordshire; from whence, in a turning and winding Course, it runs near upon 60 miles, before it reach∣es this City. In this Undertaking, fitter in∣deed for a Prince than any Subject, there have been six hundred Men at once imploy∣ed, which was a prodigious Charge. The Channel in some Places 30 foot deep, in o∣thers carried over Valleys 20 foot at least above Ground, in open Troughs. And over this River are 800 Bridges, some of Stone,
<PB N="280" REF="163"/>some of Wood, and others of Brick.</P>
<P>This City besides has the Conveniency of several Conduits of Spring-Water, so com∣modiously placed, that they serve all the chief Parts of it. And it is so situated, that in all Parts (though on the highest Ground) 'tis abundantly served with Pump-Water, the Pumps in many Places not six foot deep in the Ground.</P>
<P>For a constant Supply of Provisions, be∣sides the fruitfull County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> in which it stands, and that of <HI>Surrey</HI> on the other side of the River (both which are rea∣dy at hand to furnish it with their Provisi∣ons) it is neighboured with many other plentifull Counties, out of whose abundance this City lives in great plenty, and seldom knows what Scarcity is.</P>
<P>The Conveyance so easy, both by Land and Water, that no City in Europe has bet∣ter Conveniencies. So large, fair, and smooth are the High Ways that lead from all Parts to it, and so convenient is the River, that almost all the Fewel for firing is brought up that Way to Town. The Coals from New∣castle, and the Wood from Kent and Essex; some of which last comes also down the River from Surrey and Middlesex. Lastly, as it has the Command of the Sea, so there is scarce any Blessing in the Terrestrial Globe but this City has her Share in it.</P>
<P>Moreover, its Distance from the Sea (which is about 60 Miles) is a great Argument of the Founder's Wisdom. For, by that Distance, as it is not so near as to be annoyed by the unwholsom Vapours of the Sea, or to be sud∣denly surprised by an Enemies Fleet; so it is not so far but that, by the help of the
<PB N="281" REF="163"/>Tide (which comes up every 12 hours) Ships of great burden may be brought into her bosom.</P>
<P>In point of Latitude, 'tis in 51 Degree, 30 Minutes.</P>
<P>I come now to its full <HI>Extent,</HI> with its Suburbs and Places adjacent. Its Length from East to West, that is, from Lime-house to the further end of Mill-Bank in Westmin∣ster, is above 7500 Geometrical Paces, which comes to seven measured miles and an half, at 1000 paces a mile; that is, about five computed miles, or two Parisian Leagues and a half. The Breadth indeed is not pro∣portionable, the City being built in Length for the Conveniency of the River. And yet, taking Southwark in on the other side of the River, as it is under the Lord May∣or's Jurisdiction, and joyned to London by the Bridge, this vast City reaches there in Breadth, from North to South, that is, from the further end of White-Chappel Street to St. George's Fields in Southwark, near upon 3 miles. So that I cannot but conceive that, if London were cast (as Paris) into an or∣bicular Form, the Circumference of it would be much larger than that of Paris. So much it is increased in Buildings, since the dismal Con∣flagration in the Year 1666.</P>
<P>But whether it is profitable to the Body of the State or not, to have so vast a Head, may be made a Question. And, if Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> had cause to complain in his time of its being grown then too big for the Kingdom, he might with much more reason do it now. Great Towns, says he, in the Body of a State are like the Spleen or Milt in the Bo∣dy natural. The monstrous Growth of which
<PB N="282" REF="164"/>impoverishes all the rest of the Members, by drawing to it all the animal and vital Spirits which should give nourishment unto them; and in the end cracked or surcharged by its own fulness, not only sends unwhol∣som Fumes and Vapours to the Head, and heavy Pangs upon the Heart, but draws a Consumption on it self. He adds further, that the Overgrowth of great Cities is of dange∣rous consequence, not only in regard of Fa∣mine, such Multitudes of Mouths not being easy to be fed; but in respect of the irre∣parable Danger of Insurrections, if once those Multitudes, sensible of their own Strength, oppressed with Want, or otherwise distem∣pered with Faction or Discontent, should gather to a head, and break out into Action.</P>
<P>These are all, I confess, very plausible Ar∣guments. But, if we consider <HI>London</HI> as it is in a manner the Head of three King∣doms, at least the Seat of their Monarch, I see nothing of Monstrousness in it. On the other side, <HI>London</HI> having the Conveni∣ency of the Sea and of a navigable River, is so much the less subject to a Famine; for that in case of Scarcity at home, it may be supply'd from abroad. And, as in so great a Body there be commonly different Parties led by opposite Interests, so there is the less Cause to fear Insurrections, because one Par∣ty keeps still another in aw. Just so <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Hamburg,</HI> two free Cities, do not sub∣sist so much by their own Strength, as by the Jealousy of the several States that neigh∣bour upon 'em.</P>
<PB N="283" REF="164"/>
<P>But the greatest Danger incident to great Cities (and omitted by Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>) is in Case of Contagious Diseases; Which, the more Matter they find to work upon, make so much the greater havock; and like a ra∣ging Fire, get strength by their Motion. Witness the Year 1665, when at <HI>London</HI> there died of the Plague in one day no less than 1200.</P>
<P>When all is done, I have this to urge in the behalf of great Cities, that they are a visible Sign of a flourishing State, and such as draws Respect from its Neighbours, who look upon it as the Luxuriancy and Result of its Wealth. And, of all the Cities of Eu∣rope, none can so justly challenge the Pre∣eminency in this Point as <HI>London,</HI> the Metropo∣lis of England; being not only perhaps the most ancient, but also the wealthiest, and (reckoning all its Annexes) the greatest City now extant in Europe.</P>
<P>Such a City as contains above 600 Streets, Lanes, Courts, and Alleys; and in them all, by a late Computation, at least a hundred thousand Houses. So that, allowing only 8 Persons to each House one with another, (which I think is moderate) the Number of the Inhabitants will amount at that rate to above eight hundred thousand Souls. Be∣fides a World of Seamen, that live and swarm in that constant (tho' moving) Forest of Ships down the River, on the East side of the Bridge.</P>
<P>The Dwelling Houses raised since the Fire are generally very fair, and built much more convenient and uniform than heretofore. Be∣fore the Fire, they were most Timber Hou∣ses, built with little regard to Uniformity;
<PB N="284" REF="165"/>but since the Fire, Building of Bricks has been the general Way, and that with so much Art and Skill in Architecture, that I have often wondered to see in well-compact Houses so many Conveniences in a small com∣pass of Ground. In short, our English Build∣ers have built so much of late Years, that no Nation perhaps at this time can vy with them for making much of any Ground (tho' never so little) and contriving all the Parts of it to the best advantage, in the neatest and most regular way, with all the Conveni∣ences the Ground can possibly afford. And that which adds much to the Neatness of the late Buildings is the Wainscot, now so much in use. Which, as it is the cleanest Furniture, so it is the most durable, and indeed the most proper for so moist a Country.</P>
<P>If we come to Stateliness, I confess the Noblemens Houses at Paris, being built of free Stone (as most of that City are) with large Courts before 'em for the Reception of Coaches, make a fine outward Appearance. But, for uniformity, state, and magnificence, we have some here, and chiefly <HI>Montague-House,</HI> that exceed by far most of 'em. As for great Merchants Houses, and fair Taverns, scarce any City surpasseth London in this particu∣lar. For publick Buildings, as Halls, Inns of Court, Exchanges, Market-Places, Hospitals, Colledges, Churches, besides the Bridge upon the River, the Monument, Custom-House, and the Tower, they are Things worth any Stran∣gers Curiosity to view, at least a good part of them. Most of which have indeed the disad∣vantage of being built backward, and out of the way, to make room for Tradesmens Shops in the Streets. Whereas, if they had
<PB N="285" REF="165"/>been all built towards the Street, as generally they are in other Countries, few Cities could make so great an Appearance.</P>
<P>But for stately, strait, and spacious Streets, (to pass by many curious Courts) where shall one see finer than <HI>Cheapside, Cornhill, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ombard-Street, Fleet-Street, Hatton Garden, Pall∣nall,</HI> and several others, especially near the Court? What forein City can shew so many <HI>Piazzas,</HI> or fine Squares, such as <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields, Lincolns-Inn-Square, Grays-Inn, Red Lion,</HI> and <HI>Southampton-Squares,</HI> the <HI>Golden Square, King's Square</HI> in Sohoe, <HI>S. James's Square, Lei∣cester-Fields,</HI> and <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> The first of which is chiefly noted for its Spaciousness, and <HI>King's Square</HI> for its Stateliness.</P>
<P>Lastly, when I reflect upon that disinal Fire, which in three Days time consumed a∣bove thirteen thousand Houses (besides 89 Parish Churches, the vast Cathedral of S. Paul, divers Chappels, Halls, Colledges, Schools, and other publick Edifices) it is a matter of amazement to me to see how soon the English recovered themselves from so great a Desola∣tion, and a Loss not to be computed. At 3 Years end near upon ten thousand Houses were raised up again from their Ashes, with great Improvements. And by that time the fit of Building grew so strong, that, besides a full and glorious Restauration of a City that a raging Fire had lately buried in its Ashes, the Suburbs have been increased to that de∣gree, that (to speak modestly) as many more Houses have been added to it, with all the Advantages that able and skilfull Builders could invent, both for Conveniency and Beau∣ty.</P>
<PB N="286" REF="166"/>
<P>But it is time to come to Particulars The City, properly so called, is begirt with a <HI>Wall,</HI> which gives entrance at seven prin∣cipal <HI>Gates,</HI> besides <HI>Posterns</HI> of later erection Viz. on the West-side <HI>Ludgate</HI> and <HI>Newgate,</HI> both which serve for Prisons; the first, for such Debtors as are Freemen of the City the other for Malefactors both of the City and Country, and is besides the County Goa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Debt. Northwards, those of <HI>Aldersgate, Cripglegate, Moorgate,</HI> and <HI>Bishopsgate.</HI> And Eastward, <HI>Aldgate.</HI></P>
<P>Within the Compass of the Walls there are reckoned 97 Parishes; and in relation to the Civil Government, the City within the Walls and Freedom is divided into 26 Wards or Aldermanries, of which more hereaf∣ter.</P>
<P>As to the publick Buildings here, I shall begin with the <HI>Tower,</HI> a Fort upon the Thames, which commands both the City and River. Called the Tower, from the great white Tower in the middle, which gives Name to the Whole. 'Tis all surrounded with a Wall and Ditch about a mile in compass, with Cannon planted on the Walls, and the Tur∣rets thereof. But it is besides the principal Store-house of England for Arms and Ammu∣nition, such as is said to contain Arms for about 60000 Men.</P>
<P>Here are also kept the Jewels and Orna∣ments of the Crown, and the ancient Re∣cords of the Nation. As among others, the Original of all the Laws that have been enacted or recorded till the Reign of Richard II. The Grants of several Kings to their Subjects at home and abroad, and
<PB N="287" REF="166"/>the Confirmations thereof. The several Treaties and Leagues with forein Princes. The Dominion of the British Seas. The Title of the Kings of England to the King∣dom of France, and how obtained. All the Atchievements of this Nation in France, and other forein Parts. The Homage and De∣pendency of Scotland upon England. The Esta∣blishment of Ireland in Laws and Dominions. These, and many other Records, are reposited in <HI>Wakefield Tower,</HI> near the Traytors Gate, under the Custody of an Officer, called the <HI>Keeper of the Records,</HI> and whose Salary is 500 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per Annum.</HI> This Place is properly in the Master of the Rolls his Gift.</P>
<P>Every day of the Week (except Sundays, Holy-Days, publick Fasting, and Thanksgiv∣ing-Days, and Times of great Pestilence) they that have occasion to look into the Re∣cords have admittance. In the Morning from 7 to 11 a clock, and in the Afternoon from one till five. Except in the Months of De∣cember, January, and February, where Atten∣dance is not given till 8 in the Morning, and in the Afternoon not beyond 4 a clock.</P>
<P>In the Tower is the only <HI>Mint</HI> of En∣gland, for Coyning of Gold and Silver. To which belong several Offices, which I intend to muster in my second Part, where I shall speak of the English Coyns.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Tower, which has been for∣merly honoured with the Residence of seve∣ral Kings, who kept their Courts here, is now the chief Prison, where Persons of quality that are charged with Crimes against the Go∣vernment are kept in Custody.</P>
<PB N="288" REF="167"/>
<P>Here are also many Dwelling-Houses fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Officers that belong to it, either as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Arsenal, or a Mint, &amp;c. And, as an Arsenal here is kept the Office of his Majesties O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dinance, to be explained in my second Part For the publick Devotion of all the Dwelle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the Tower there is within its Walls on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parochial Church, called <HI>S.

<P>The Government of the Tower, as it is a Place of great Trust, so it has been usually put in the hands of two Persons of great worth, the one called <HI>Constable,</HI> and the other <HI>Lieutenant of the Tower.</HI> The <HI>Constable</HI> has the chief Command, and is Lord Lieutenant of the 21 Hamlets belonging to it, which ly in several Parishes of large extent. Whose Train-bands, making two intire Regiments of Foot, and above 3000 Men, are to attend the Kings Person when commanded, but are to march no farther than the King. They were sometimes the Gards of the Tower, and are bound (if occasion be) to reinforce the Garrison, upon the Constable's Com∣mand. Who, by his Place is to be in the Commission of the Peace for the City of London, and the Counties of Middlesex, Kent, and Surrey. And so is the <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> who is subordinate, to the Constable for the time being, but in his absence commands with the full Power of both. His Salary is 200 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum,</HI> with all the Fees and Perquisites, which are very considerable, both from the Prisoners that happen to be in the Tower, and from the Warders Places, which are all at his Disposal.</P>
<PB N="289" REF="167"/>
<P>Under the Command of the Constable, and the Lieutenant of the Tower in his absence, are the <HI>Gentleman Porter,</HI> the 24 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eomen Warders,</HI> and the <HI>Gunners of the Tow∣er.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gentleman Porter</HI> (who holds his Place by Patent) has the Charge of the Gates. The Keys whereof he is every night to de∣liver to the Constable, and in his absence to the Lieutenant, and to receive them of him the next morning. He commands the War∣ders that are upon duty, and claims for his Fee at the entrance of a Prisoner his Upper Garment, or else a Composition for the same.</P>
<P>The <HI>Warders</HI> are accounted the King's Do∣mestick Servants, and sworn accordingly by the Lord High Chamberlain, or by the Clerk of the Check. Their Duty is to wait at the Gates, and by the Lieutenant of the Tower's appointment to attend Prisoners of State, which is the most profitable and be∣neficial part of their Station. At the Gates they examine every Stranger that offers to go in, and before admittance (according to the Rules of Military Discipline) those that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear Swords must leave 'em in their hands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill they go out. Ten of them are usually upon the Days Wait, and two upon the Watch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very night.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gunners</HI> are to look after the Ord∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance mounted on the Batteries and Lines, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd ready for Service on the shortest Warn∣ing. One or more of them are upon Duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay and night, to wait for Orders.</P>
<P>For the Liberty of the Tower (to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as been annexed the old Artillery Garden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Spittle-Fields, and the little Minories)
<PB N="290" REF="168"/>here is an ancient Court of Record; held by a Steward every Monday by Prescription, for Debts, Trespasses, &amp;c. And in the said Li∣berty the Gentleman Porter has the same Power and Authority as Sheriffs have with∣in their respective Counties. He constitutes Bayliffs thereof, to execute all Process and Warrants directed to them by the Steward of the Court; and has all Escheats, Deodands, and Goods of all <HI>Felones de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se.</HI></P>
<P>For Ecclesiastical Causes and Probate of Wills, the Tower and Liberties thereof have a Royal Jurisdiction. From which there is no Appeal but to the King in his Court of Chancery; who thereupon issues out a Commission under the Great Seal, as in Appeals from the Arches or Prerogative Courts.</P>
<P>But, whether the Tower be in the County (that is under the Jurisdiction) of Middle∣sex, or in the Liberty of the City, 'tis un∣determined to this day. Some will have it to be part of it in Middlesex, and part in the Liberty of the City. And in the Case of Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury</HI>'s Murder, the Judges Opinion was, that the Trial must be made in the City, the Fact being done in that Part of the Tower held to be in the City Liberties.</P>
<P>Next to the Tower, I come to the <HI>Custom House,</HI> placed between the Tower and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bridge. Which, having been destroy'd by the Fire in the Year 1666, was soon afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rebuilt much more commodious, uniform, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> magnificent; and the Building cost the Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 10000 pounds.</P>
<PB N="291" REF="168"/>
<P>Here are received and managed all the Im∣positions laid upon Merchandise Imported, and Exported from this City. Which are so con∣siderable, that, of all the Customs of En∣gland divided into 3 Parts, the Port of Lon∣don pay's two Thirds, that is (when Trade flourishes) about 400000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly.</P>
<P>In this Office are imploy'd a great Num∣ber of Officers, an Account whereof you will find in my Second Part, where I speak of the King's Revenues.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bridge</HI> of London offers it self in the next place to our Consideration. Which, considering the constant great Flux and Reflux at that Place, was certainly a very difficult and costly piece of Work. It consists of 19 Arches, at 20 foot distance of each other, with a Draw∣bridge almost in the middle 'Tis about 800 foot long, and 30 broad. Set out with a fine Row of Houses all along, with Shops fur∣nished with most sorts of Commodities. So that it looks more like a Street than a Bridge, the Street being widened in the late Reign from 12 to 20 foot. It was built in the year 1200, in the Reign of King John. And so great are the Charges of keeping it in repair, that there is a large Revenue in Lands and Houses set apart for that pur∣pose, and two Bridge-Masters (besides other Officers) chosen out of the Liverv-men on Midsummer-Day to look after the same.</P>
<P>Near this Bridge is the fatal Place where the dreadful Fire afore-mentioned first began. In perpetual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Memory whereof was erected, by virtue of an Act of Parliament, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aster-piece of Building, called the <HI>Monu∣ment,</HI>

This Pillar, not unlike those two ancient white Marble Pillars at Rome, erect∣ed in honour of the Emperours Trajan and Antonius, is all built of <HI>Portland</HI> Stone, as du∣rable almost as Marble; and is of the Do∣rick Order, 202 foot high, and 15 foot Dia∣meter. Within-side is a fair winding Stair∣case, with Iron rails up to the top; where this stately Pile is surrounded with an Iron-Balcony, yielding a pleasant Prospect all over the City. The Pedestal is 40 foot high, and 21 foot Square; the Front of it adorned with ingenious Emblems, and the North and South∣sides with these two Latine Inscriptions.</P>

<P>The same thus Englished by Dr. Chamberlain.</P>
<Q>In the Year of Christ 1666, the second Day of September, Eastward from hence, at the Distance of Two hundred and two foot (the height of this Column) a terrible Fire broke out about Midnight; which driven on by a high Wind, not only wasted the adjacent Parts, but also very remote Places, with incredible noise and fury. It consumed eighty nine Churches, the City-Gates, Guildhall, many publick Structures, Hospitals, Schools, Libraries, a vast Number of stately Edifices, Thirteen thousand two hundred Dwelling-houses, four hundred Streets. Of the six and twenty Wards it utterly destroy'd fifteen, and left eight o∣thers shattered and half-burnt. The Ruins of the City were four hundred thirty six Acres, from the Tower by the Thames-side to the Temple-Church, and from the North-East Gate along the City-Wall to Holborn-Bridge. To the Estates and Fortunes of the Citizens it was merciless, but to their Lives very favourable, that it might in all things resemble the last Conflagration of the World. The Destruction was sudden, for in a small space of time the same City was seen most flourishing, and reduced to nothing. Three days after, when this fatal Fire had baffled all humane Counsels and In∣deavours in the Opinion of all, it stopt as it were by a Command from Heaven, and was on every side extinguished.</Q>

<P>In English, thus.</P>
<Q>Charles II. Son of Charles the Martyr, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, De∣fender of the Faith, a most gracious Prince, Commiserating the deplorable state of
<PB N="295" REF="170"/>Things, whilst the Ruins were yet smoak∣ing, provided for the Comfort of his Citi∣zens, and the Ornament of his City; Re∣mitted their Taxes, and referred the Peti∣tions of the Magistrates and Inhabitants to the Parliament; who immediately passed an Act, that publick Works should be re∣stored to greater Beauty with publick Mo∣ny, to be raised by an Imposition on Coals; That Churches and the Cathedral of S. Paul's should be Rebuilt from their Foundations, with all Magnificence; That Bridges, Gates, and Prisons should be new made, the Sewers cleansed, the Streets made strait and regular, such as were steep le∣velled, and those too narrow made wider; Markets and Shambles removed to sepa∣rate Places. They also Enacted, that eve∣ry House should be built with Party Walls, and all in Front raised of equal height, and those Walls all of square Stone or Brick, and that no man should delay Building be∣yond the space of seven Years. Moreover, Care was taken by Law, to prevent all Suits about their Bounds. Also anniver∣sary Prayers were injoyned; and, to per∣petuate the Memory hereof to Posterity, they caused this Column to be erected. The Work was carried on with diligence, and London is restored; but, whether with greater speed or beauty, may be made a question. At three years time the World sees that finished, which was supposed to be the Business of an Age.</Q>
<P>From the Monument I come now to the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> the finest Building of this kind in Europe. First erected in the year
<PB N="296" REF="171"/>1566 (just one hundred years before it was burnt) at the Cost and Chargers of a no∣ble Merchant, Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham;</HI> and, by the special Command of Queen Elizabeth, proclaimed in a solemn manner by the Name of the <HI>Royal-Exchange.</HI> But then it was built most of Brick; and now all of free-stone within and without, with admirable Archi∣tecture.</P>
<P>The same is Quadrangular, with a stately Front to it, and a high Turret at the top, with a Chime of 12 Bells. Within is a large Court, wherein the Merchants meet daily about one a Clock; and all round it fine arched Galleries or Walks, for a Shelter in case of Rain, or hot Sun-shiny Wea∣ther.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Court stands a fine Statue of white Marble, upon a Pedestal 7 foot high. 'Tis the Statue of King Charles II, done with great beauty and spirit in the ancient Habit of the Roman Caesars, with a Wreath of Laurel on his Head. The Work of Mr. <HI>Gibbons,</HI> (a most skilfull Artist,) at the charge of the Merchant Adventurers of England.</P>
<P>But the greatest Ornament of this Place is in the Niches above, where the Kings of England from William the Conquerour are now partly set up, till the rest can be finish∣ed.</P>
<P>Above Stairs is the Exchange, chiefly for wearing Apparel. It consists of almost 200 Shops, where the richest sort of Commodi∣ties are sold, both for Use and Orna∣ment.</P>
<P>The whole Fabrick cost above 50000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> whereof one half being disbursed by the Chamber of London, and the other by the
<PB N="297" REF="171"/>Company of Mercers, they now reimburse themselves by the Rent of the Shops above and below Stairs, and the vaulted Cellars un∣der Ground. Which comes to about 4000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year, besides 30 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Fine, which is paid for every Shop. And, as Dr. <HI>Chamberlain</HI> ob∣serves, this goodly Fabrick not taking up quite an Acre of Ground, is perhaps the richest piece of Ground in the whole World.</P>
<P>In our Way towards Westminster, before we come to St. Pauls Cathedral, are three Things worth taking notice of. On the left hand, a <HI>Statute</HI> of King Charles II. on Horse∣back in Stock-Market, with a fine Con∣duit to it, <HI>Bow steeple</HI> in the middle of Cheapside, and on the right hand the <HI>Guild∣hall.</HI> The first done in white Marble, at the Cost and Charges of Sir Robert Viner. The other a solid and beautifull Structure, composed of four of the Orders of Building, which shews the rare Invention of the Ar∣chitect. The whole Height of it from the Ground is 225 foot, and yet is but half so high as the intended Dome of St. Pauls Ca∣thedral is designed to be. Noted besides for its Ring of Bells, reputed to be the best in all England. <HI>Guildhall,</HI> where the the City Courts of Judicature are held; and where the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council meet for the Management of the City-Concerns, is a spacious Building, but more glorious within than without. At the first coming in is a spacious Hall, set out (among other Things) with the Pictures of Their Majesties King William and Queen Mary, with those of several Judges. Here are also two Giauts, that stand up in their bulky Figures.</P>
<PB N="298" REF="172"/>
<P><HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> is so near this Place, and so famous for the Sale of Woollen-Cloths, that I cannot pass it by in Silence. The same was purchased by the Lord Mayor and Com∣monalty in the Beign of Richard II, and has been since imployed as a Weekly Market-Place for all sorts of Woollen-Cloth, broad and narrow, brought from all Parts of the Kingdom there to be sold. And it is to this day the greatest Market and Store-house for all sorts of Woolen-Cloth.</P>
<P>And now we come to St. <HI>Pauls Cathedral,</HI> seated on the highest Part of all the City, and first built by Sebert, the first Christian King of the East-Saxons. Before the Fire it was in Length 690 Foot, that is 20 foot long∣er than St. Peter's in Rome, which for beauty, proportion, and divers other Things, excels all other Churches. Its Breadth and Height were proportionable to the Length, so that it stood upon so much ground as contained above 3 Acres and a half. This famous Church, as vast and solid as it was, was devoured by that dreadfull Fire in the Year 1666. But, some Years after, Sir <HI>Chri∣stopher Wren</HI> having, by the King's Command, designed a new Model of it, a new Foun∣dation was laid accordingly. And, ever since, this stately Fabrick has been carried on to that height we see it now. So that for Great∣ness and Figure, for Solidity, Magnificence, and curious-Architecture, 'tis like to excel all Churches in Christendom, except in some particulars St. Peter's Church in Rome. To this Cathedral belongs a Dean, and thirty Prebendaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Sergeants Inns</HI> are so called, because divers Judges and Sergeants at Law keep their Commons and Lodge there in Term∣time. The Number of these is about 26, who being arrived to the highest Degree in the Study of the Common Law, have here their Lodging and Diet.

<P>The Degrees by which the Student in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommon Law rises to that of a Sergeant are
<PB N="304" REF="173"/>first, by being bred 2 or 3 years in the Uni∣versity, in the Study of Logick and Rheto∣rick, with some Insight into the Civil Law. Upon which he is admitted to one of the four Inns of Court, where he is first called a Student, or Inner-Barrister, till after 7 Years Study he becomes a Mootman or Utter-Bar∣rister, and some Years after a Bencher.</P>
<P>Those are Utter-Barristers, who from their Learning and Standing are called by the Benchers, in the Mooting Time, to plead and argue Moots, that is doubtfull Cases and Questions. And, whilst they argue the said Cases, they sit uttermost on the Forms of the Benchers. Out of these Mootmen, are chosen Readers for the Inns of Chancery, where in Term-Time and Grand Vacations they argue Cases in the presence of Attor∣neys and Clerks. In the four Inns of Chan∣cery seated in Holbourn, the Moots are read either by those of Grays-Inn, or Lincolns-Inn; and in the others, by those of the two Temples.</P>
<P>The Benchers, so called from the Bench whereon they sit at the upper end of the Hall, are the Seniors, to whom is committed the Government of the whole House; and out of whose Number is yearly chosen a Trea∣surer, who receives, disburses, and accounts for all Moneys belonging to the House. Out of these are also chosen those Readers, whose Reading is kept with so much feasting and so∣lemnity. To which are invited the chief Nobles, Judges, Bishops, great Officers of the King∣dom, and sometimes the King himself. Such a Feasting as has cost some Readers 1000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> After which the Reader wears a long Rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣different
<PB N="305" REF="173"/>from other Barristers, and is then in a capacity to be made a Sergeant at Law, the Sergeants being usually chosen out of these Readers.</P>
<P>The Manner of their Choice is thus. When the Number of Sergeants is small, the Lord Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas, by the advice and consent of the other Judges, makes choice of some of the most grave and learned of the Inns of Court, and presents their Names to the Lord Chancellour, or Lord Keeper. Who sends, by the King's Writ, to each of them, to appear on such a day be∣fore the King, to receive the State and De∣gree of a Sergeant at Law. At the appoint∣ed Time, they, being habited in party∣coloured Robes, come to Westminster-Hall, accompany'd with the Students of the Inns of Court, and attended by a Train of Ser∣vants and Retainers in their Cloth Liveries. Where they take in publick a solemn Oath, and are cloathed with Coifs, which they wear always in publick. After this, they feast the great Persons of the Nation in a most splendid manner, and present them with gold Rings, according to their Quality. Out of these Sergeants the King calls by Writ some of them to be of his Council at Law. These fit within the Bar in all Courts at West∣minster, except in the Common-Pleas.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inns of Court</HI> are so called, either be∣cause the Students therein are to serve the Courts of Judicature, or elfe (as <HI>Fortescue</HI> affirms) because these Colledges received only the Sons of Noblemen and better sort of Gentlemen. They are the largest and the most beautiful Inns; <HI>Grays-Inn</HI> particularly being beautify'd of late with a fine Square,
<PB N="306" REF="174"/>and another being now building in <HI>Lincolns-Inn,</HI> which will be a great Set-off and Orna∣ment to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Two Temples</HI> (heretofore the Dwell∣ing of the Knights Templers, purchased above 300 years since by some Professors of the Common Law) are called the <HI>Inner</HI> and <HI>Middle Temple,</HI> in relation to Essex-House, now built up into Streets. Which House was part of the Knights Templers, and called the <HI>Outer-Temple,</HI> because seated without Temple-Bar.</P>
<P><HI>Lincolns Inn</HI> is so called from the ancient Earls of Lincoln, whose House it was; and <HI>Grays-Inn,</HI> from the noble Family of the Grays, to whom it formerly belonged.</P>
<P>In these four Inns of Court are reckoned about 800 Students.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inns of Chancery</HI> were heretofore pre∣paratory Colledges for younger Students; where they were usually entred, before they could be admitted into the Inns of Court. Now they are for the most part taken up by Attorneys, Sollicitors, and Clerks; who have here their Chambers apart, and their Diet at an easy rate. Here they eat in a Hall to∣gether, where they are obliged to appear in their Robes, and black round knit Caps.</P>
<P>These Inns belong to the Inns of Court, some to one, some to another. As <HI>Bernard's</HI> and <HI>Staple-Inns</HI> to Grays Inn, <HI>Thavies</HI> and <HI>Furnival's</HI> to Lincolns-Inn, and the rest to the two Temples. Accordingly the Inns of Court send yearly some of their Barristers to Read in those Colledges, all which one with another contain about 500 Lawyers.</P>
<PB N="307" REF="174"/>
<P><HI>Cliffords Inn,</HI> among the rest, was anciently the House of the Lord Clifford, from whence it is so denominated; <HI>Staple Inn</HI> belonged to the Merchants of the Staple; and <HI>Lyons Inn</HI> was anciently a common Inn with the Sign of the Lyon.</P>
<P>But, besides those 8 Inns of Chancery, there is another in Chancery-Lane, known by the Name of <HI>Symonds Inn,</HI> being formerly a publick Inn kept by one <HI>Symond.</HI> This is an Inn by it self, belonging to no Inn of Court, nor liv∣ing under any Rules, such as the other Inns live under.</P>
<P>Now 'tis to be observed, that the foresaid Societies are no Corporations, and have no Judicial Power over their Members. Only they have among themselves certain Orders, which by Consent have the force of Laws. Neither have they any Lands or Revenues, as Societies; and, for the defraying the Charges of the House, they have but what is paid at Admittances, and Quit-rents for their Cham∣bers. At the Colledge-Chappel, or Hall, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Courts of Judicature, they wear a black Robe and Cap; at other times they walk in Gentlemens Habit. For light Offences they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re only Excommoned, and not to eat with the rest. For great Offences they lose their Chambers, and are expelled the Colledge; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, being once expelled, they are never received by any of the three other Socie∣ties.</P>
<P>But, besides all the foresaid Inns, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re for the Common Law and Chancery, here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also a Colledge of Civilians, called <HI>Doctors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommons.</HI> For, though Degrees in the Civil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw may be taken only in Oxford and Cam∣ridge, and the Theory best there to be ac∣quired;
<PB N="308" REF="175"/>yet the Practice thereof is most of all in London. Where this Colledge (stand∣ing near S. Paul's, in the Parish of S. Bennets Pauls-Wharf) was founded by Dr. <HI>Harvey.</HI> Dean of the Arches, for the Professors of the Civil Law in this City. And here did commonly reside the Judge of the Arches, the Judge of the Admiralty, and the Judge of the Prerogative Court, with divers other emi∣nent Civilians. From whose living, for Diet and Lodging, in a Collegiate manner, and Commoning together, it got the Name of <HI>Doctors Commons.</HI> This Colledge, in the time of the great Fire, being involved in the Ru∣ins of the City, they all removed to Exete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House in the Strand. Till that being rebuilt, at their own proper Costs and Charges, in a more convenient and splendid manner than before they returned to it. Where they no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> keep their several Courts and Pleadings every Term.</P>
<P>But London being in a manner an Univer∣sity, there are in it several other Colledges worth our taking notice.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>Colledge of Physicians,</HI> which stood formerly in Knight-Rider Street; and was the Gift of Dr. <HI>Linacre,</HI> Physician to King Henry VIII. Since which a House and Ground was purchased by the Society of Phy∣sicians at the end of Amen-Street, whereon a stately Structure for a Library and a public<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hall was erected by Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> Anno 1652. who indowed the same with his whole In∣heritance, which he resigned while he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet living and in health. But this goodly Edifice could not escape the rage of the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Fire. And that Ground being but a Lease
<PB N="309" REF="175"/>the Society purchased a Piece of Ground in Warwick Lane near Newgate, whereon they have raised the present Colledge, a magnifi∣cent Edifice.</P>
<P>The Physicians of this Colledge have, by Charters and Acts of Parliament, such Pri∣viledges as exclude all others (though Gra∣duates in Physick, of Oxford or Cambridge) from practising Physick in London, or with∣in 7 miles of it, without a Licence under the Colledge-Seal. And all Offenders in that Case, and divers others, they may fine, and imprison. They have Authority to search all the Shops of Apothecaries in and about London, to see if their Drugs and Compositi∣ons are wholsom and well made. And, by virtue of the said Charters, they are freed from all troublesom Offices, as to serve upon Juries, to be Constable, to keep Watch and Ward, to bear Arms, or provide Arms or Am∣munition, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Colledge do's chiefly consist of Fellows and Candidates; besides the honourary Fellows, and Licentiates. The Number of <HI>Fellows</HI> is always to be forty, besides the King's Physi∣cians. And, when any Fellow dies, or leaves this City, the next Candidate succeeds to make up the Number. But the <HI>Candidates,</HI> before their Admission, are strictly examined (or at least ought to be so) in all Parts of Physick. The <HI>honourary Fellows</HI> and <HI>Licentiates</HI> do both injoy the Priviledges of the Colledge, but have no share in the Government.</P>
<P>The Title of <HI>Honourary</HI> was first bestowed on some worthy Physicians who were un∣willing or unable to come in by the right Line of Candidates. The <HI>Licentiates</HI> are such as for want of sufficient Learning, &amp;c. are
<PB N="310" REF="176"/>judged unfit to be received into the Num∣ber of Fellows or Candidates. Yet, because they may be serviceable to the Publick, and do good at least in some sorts of Diseases, they are, after due Examination and Appro∣bation, licensed to practise.</P>
<P>Of this Colledge there is a President, four Censors, and eight Elects, who are all prin∣cipal Members of the Society. Out of these one is chosen every Year to preside, and Michaelmas is the Time of Election. But, if the President chance to die before, the eldest Fellow has full power to execute his Place till the next Election. As for the Censors, 'tis their province to look to and correct those Interlopers that practise without Au∣thority. Whose Number in London is great, and yet connived at, according to the Rule, <HI>Si Populus vult decipi, decipiatur.</HI> But one would wonder there should be so many, considering the Hazard both they and their Patients do run by their Practice. They by the Law of England, which makes it Felony in any one presuming to practise Physick without Authority, whose Patient dies under his hand.</P>
<P>The next Colledge of note is <HI>That of the Heralds,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Heralds Office,</HI> being upon S. Bennets Hill, near Doctors Commons. An ancient House, first built by that Earl of Darby who married the Mother of Henry VII, and bestowed by Queen Mary on the Kings Heralds and Pur∣sevants at Arms for ever. The greatest Part of which is rebuilt since the great Fire, which laid it in Ashes. Where some Officers of Arms do give a constant Attendance, to sa∣tisfy all Comers touching Descents, Pedigrees, Coats of Arms, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="311" REF="176"/>
<P>Within the Walls of London (in Bishops-Gate Street) is also seated the Colledge call∣ed <HI>Gresham Colledge,</HI> from his Founder Sir Thomas Gresham, who also built the Royal Exchange. After the Building whereof he gave one Moity of its Revenue to the May∣or and Commonalty of London, and their Successors; the other Moiety, to the Com∣pany of Mercers in trust, that the Mayor and Aldermen should find in all Time to come four able Persons to read within this Col∣ledge Divinity, Geometry, Astronomy, and Musick, allowing each of them (besides their Lodgings) 50 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year; and that the Com∣pany of Mercers should find three more able Men to read Civil Law, Physick, and Rhe∣torick, with the same Allowance as to the former. The said Lecturers to read in Term∣time every Day in the Week (except Sun∣days) Aforenoon in Latine, and Afternoon the same in English; the Musick Lecture to be read only in English.</P>
<P>This Colledge is noted besides, for being the Meeting Place of that famous Society of Virtuoso's called the <HI>Royal-Society;</HI> made a Cor∣poration by virtue of a Charter King Charles II. granted them, bearing date the 22th of A∣pril 1663. It consists of a President, a Coun∣til, and several Fellows; among which there is a Treasurer, two Secretaries, and a Num∣ber of Curators or Experimentors. Their Business is, by Experiments to promote the Knowledge of Natural Things, and usefull Arts; which they have hitherto done in a great measure. For, by the great Number of their Experiments and Inventions, they have mightily improved the Naval, Civil, and Military Architecture, but especially the
<PB N="312" REF="177"/>Art of Navigation. They have also incon∣raged Husbandry to that degree, that not on∣ly England, but many other Countries, and even the remotest of our foreign Plantations, feel the sweet effects of it. But, besides those Experiments of Fruit and Profit, they have made many curious Discoveries, such as the learned Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> calls Experiments of Light. And, if they have not answered to the full the Expectation of some People in point of Usefulness, they have at least very industri∣ously laid a solid Ground-work for future Ages to improve Experimental Know∣ledge.</P>
<P>Therefore King Charles gave them for their Coat of Arms a Scutcheon, with 3 Lyons of England in chief, intimating that the Society was Royal; for the Crest an Eagle, and for the Supporter hunting Hounds, to intimate the Sagacity imployed in penetra∣ting and searching after the Works of Na∣ture. And His Majesty was pleased, for the Credit of the Society, to list himself amongst them.</P>
<P>Their Meeting is upon Wednesdays, at 3 a Clock in the Afternoon. And the Office of the <HI>President</HI> is to call and dissolve the Meet∣ings, to propose the Matter to be considered of, to put Questions, and call for Experi∣ments, to admit the Members that from time to time shall be elected, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Treasurer</HI> receives, and disburses all Moneys. The <HI>Se∣cretaries</HI> read all Letters and Informations both from England and foreign Parts, directed to the Society, and make such Returns as the Society thinks fit. They take notice of the Orders and material Passages at the Meet∣ings, segister all Experiments, all certain
<PB N="313" REF="177"/>Informations, all Conclusions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and publish whatsoever is ordered and allowed by the So∣ciety. Lastly, the <HI>Curators</HI> are to receive the Directions of the Society, and at another Meeting they bring all to the Test, the Society being Judges thereof. Whereby the World has the concurring Testimony of ma∣ny Persons of undoubted Credit for the Truth of what they publish.</P>
<P>The Council consists of 21 Members, eleven whereof are to be continued for the next Year, and the other ten to be chosen yearly upon the Feast of St. Andrew in the Mor∣ning. After which they all dine together at a Venison-Feast.</P>
<P>The Manner of electing their <HI>Fellows</HI> is by Ballotting, according to the Venetian way. The Candidate is proposed at one As∣sembly by some that know him well, and the next he may be put to the Scrutiny. To carry it, he must have the major Number of 21 Suffrages at the least. And then at that, or the next Assembly, he may be in∣troduced, and solemnly admitted by the Pre∣sident. At his Admission he subscribes this Promise, <HI>That he will indeavour to promote the Good of the Royal Society of London, for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge;</HI> pays to the Treasurer only 40 Shillings, and so long as he continues a Member 13 Shillings a Quarter. But he may at any time free him∣self from this Obligation, by signifying under his hand to the President that he desires to withdraw from the Society.</P>
<P>Of this Society there have been all along, and are still, Persons of the highest Rank, and many eminent Gentlemen and Doctors, both English and Foreiners, sober, learned, solid,
<PB N="314" REF="178"/>and ingenious Persons. Who, though of diffe∣rent Degrees, Religions, Countries, Professions, Trades, and Fortunes; yet, laying aside all Names of Distinction, have united together, amicably to promote Experimental Know∣ledge. Among which I cannot but make par∣ticular mention of the Honourable Mr. <HI>Ro∣bert Boyl,</HI> the Glory of England, and the O∣racle of Europe in point of Philosophy.</P>
<P>In this Colledge is the <HI>Repository,</HI> consisting of many Rarities of Nature, some of 'em brought from the furthest Corners of the World. Such as Beasts, Birds, Fishes, Ser∣pents, Flies, Shells, Feathers, Seeds, Minerals, Mummies, Gums, some things petrify'd, o∣thers Ossify'd, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The last Colledge I am to speak of is another also within London, called <HI>Sion Colledge,</HI> near Cripplegate. Founded by <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Doctor in Divinity, for the Use of the Cler∣gy of London, and the Liberties thereof; and part for 20 poor People. To perform all which he gave 3000 <ABBR><HI>l</HI></ABBR>; and for the main∣tenance of those Poor, he settled 120 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year for ever. Besides 40 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year for a Sermon in Latine, at the beginning of every Quarter, and a plentifull Dinner for all the Clergy that shall then meet there.</P>
<P>In this Colledge (now repaired, since the dreadfull Fire) is a fair spacious Library, built by <HI>John Sympson</HI> Rector of St. Olaves Heart-street, and one of the said Founder's Executors. Which Library, by the Bounty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> divers Benefactors, has been well furnished with Books, especially such as relate to Di∣vinity.</P>
<PB N="315" REF="178"/>
<P>There are likewise in London divers <HI>Pub∣lick Schools</HI> indowed, as <HI>St. Pauls, Merchant Taylors, Mercers Chappel,</HI> &amp;c. which in other Countries would be stiled Colledges. But e∣specially <HI>Paul's School,</HI> a commodious and state∣ly Building at the East end of St. Paul's Ca. thedral. Founded in the Year 1512. by <HI>John Collet,</HI> Dr. of Divinity, and Dean of St. Pauls, for 153 Children to be taught there gratis. For which purpose he appointed a Master, a Sub-Master or Usher, and a Chaplain, with large Stipends for ever; committing the Oversight thereof to the Ma∣sters, Wardens, and Assistants of the Mercers in London, his Father <HI>Henry Collet</HI> (some∣time Lord Mayor of London) having been of their Company.</P>
<P>Moreover, for the Correction of Vagabonds, and other Persons of a loose Life and Con∣versation, there are several <HI>Work-houses.</HI> The principal of which is <HI>Bridewell</HI> near Fleet-Bridge. A stately Building, first built by King Henry VIII. for the Reception of the Em∣perour Charles the fifth, but since converted to this Use. And, for Trying of Malefactors, there is in the Old-Baily the <HI>Sessions-House,</HI> which may go with the rest among the Ornaments of this glorious City, as unplea∣sant as it is to many people that are there tried for their Lives.</P>
<P>Within the Precincts of Westminster are also many Things worthy our Observati∣on.</P>
<P>I begin with <HI>Whitehall,</HI> belonging hereto∣fore to Cardinal Woolsey, and since his Time become the usual Place of Residence of the English Monarchs. 'Tis seated betwixt the
<PB N="316" REF="179"/>Thames on the East and a fine Park on the West, amidst the Pleasures of the Water, and the Charms of a fine spacious Spot of Ground. The River of one side affording a great deal of Variety by the Multitude of Boats that cover it; the Park on the other side charming the Eye with its delicate Walks, well gravelled and as well shadowed, parted with a fine Canal in the middle, and this fronted with a brazen Statue, which for cu∣rious Workmanship is admired by Artists themselves.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Whitehall</HI> it self, I confess its out∣ward Appearance is not great, but it is very convenient, and more glorious within than without. And yet the Chamber at the front of it, called the <HI>Banquetting-House,</HI> is such a Piece of Building as for Spaciousness, Beau∣ty, Painting, and exact Proportion, is not to be parallelled by any King in Europe; the Cieling whereof was all painted by the hand of the famous Sir <HI>Peter Paul Rubens.</HI> Here is also, besides the Protestant Chappel, a neat one built by the late King James for his Use, which by the Grace of God ly's now dormant. And in one of the Courts stands his Brazen Statue, which has had bet∣ter luck than that of Newcastle upon Tine.</P>
<P>On the North-West side of the Park is an∣other Royal Pallace, called <HI>St. James,</HI> which gives name to the Park. In the Strand is another Pallace, called <HI>Somerset-House,</HI> where the Queen Dowager resides, and keeps her Dourt. This was built by Edward, Duke of Somerset, Uncle to King Edward the fixth.</P>
<PB N="317" REF="179"/>
<P>But the Glory of Westminster is the <HI>Abbey-Church</HI> there, founded before the Norman Conquest by King Edward the Confessour, and most richly indowed; afterwards rebuilt from the Ground by King Henry III. This huge Fabrick stands on that piece of Ground which formerly was called <HI>Thorney-Island;</HI> then sur∣rounded with Water, and where of old stood a Temple dedicated to Apollo. In this Church is usually performed the Coronation of our Kings, with that Pomp and Magni∣ficence as becomes such potent Monarchs. On the East end of it is <HI>Henry the Sevenths Chappel,</HI> built by that King with admirable artificial Work both within and without. And here are the Tombs and Monuments of several of our Kings and Queens, among which that of massy Brass is so curiously wrought, that it is scarcely to be parallelled.</P>
<P>The Abbey was converted into a Collegi∣ate Church by Queen Elizabeth, who pla∣ced therein a Dean, and 12 Prebendaries; besides about 30 petty Canons and others, belonging to the Quire. The Dean is in∣trusted with the Custody of the <HI>Regalia</HI> at the Coronation, and honoured with a Place of necessary Service at all Coronations.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this Church is a famous <HI>School</HI> and <HI>Colledge</HI> called <HI>Westminster School,</HI> a Seminary for the Universities. The Colledge consists of 40 Scholars, commonly called <HI>Kings Scholars;</HI> who, being chosen out of the School, and put into the Colledge, are there maintained. And, as they are fitted for the University, they are yearly elected away, and placed with good Allowances in Christ-Church Colledge in Oxford, and Trinity College in Cambridge.</P>
<PB N="318" REF="180"/>
<P>Here is also in the Cloysters a fair publick <HI>Library,</HI> free for all Strangers to study both Morning and Afternoon always in Term∣time.</P>
<P>Next this Church stood the <HI>Royal Pallace</HI> of the Kings of England, a great Part where∣of was burnt down in the Time of Henry VIII. What remained has still been imploy'd for the Use of the Lords and Commons as∣sembled in Parliament, and for the chief Courts of Judicature. The great Hall where these are kept, commonly called <HI>Wesiminster-Hell,</HI> is 270 foot in length, and 74 in breadth, for its Dimensions not to be equalled by any Hall in Christendom. And were it set out according to its Greatness and the Dignity of the Courts that are kept there, it might pass for one of the most remarkable Build∣ings in Europe. Erected, as some say, by King William Rufus; or, according to others, by Richard II, about 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 years ago.</P>
<P>But this is not all that <HI>Westminster</HI> affords wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h our taking notice. The <HI>Brazen Statue</HI> of King Charles I, at Charing-Cross, the <HI>New Exchange,</HI> and <HI>Exeter Change</HI> in the Strand, the <HI>Savoy</HI> once a famous Hospital, several <HI>Noblemens Houses</HI> more like Princely Pallaces (such as Montague, Berkley, Wall∣ingford, Southampton, and Northumberland House) the <HI>New Buildings</HI> raised from York, Arundel, Worcester, Essex, Newport, and Clarendon-House. Those of <HI>Sohoe,</HI> which alone might make a good large City, and many more too numerous to insist upon; All these, together with so many fine <HI>Piazza's</HI> or <HI>Squares</HI> I have already mentioned, are enough (if
<PB N="319" REF="180"/>duly considered) to raise the Admiration of all Strangers.</P>
<P>But, for a publick Building of a late Erection, 'tis worth our while to step out of the Way, and take a View of <HI>Chelsey-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spital.</HI> Begun by Charles II. continued by King James his Brother, and brought to perfection by our present King and Queen; for the Refuge and Maintenance of poor and disabled Souldiers that have faithfully served their King and Country. A stately Pile, which in some respects outdo's, in others is out done by the famous <HI>Hotel des Invalides</HI> at Pa∣ris.</P>
<P>As for the Government of London and Westminster, the City of London, with the Liberties thereof, is governed in chief as to Civil Affairs, by a <HI>MAYOR,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Lord</HI> prefixt, given to no Mayor in England but that of London, and of late to the Mayor of York. In the Time of the Romans, he was called <HI>Prefect of London;</HI> in the Saxons time, <HI>Port-greeve,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Provost of London;</HI> and, after the Coming in of the Normans, <HI>Bayliff.</HI> 'Twas King Richard I, who in the Year 1189 (being the first of his Reign) changed the Name of Bayliff into that of <HI>Mayor,</HI> a French Word originally; which has continued ever since.</P>
<P>This great and mighty Magistrate is yearly chosen by the Citizens, upon Michaelmas Day, the 29th of September. The Body out of which he is chosen are the 26 <HI>Aldermen,</HI> all Persons of great Wealth and Wisdom, at least ought so to be. Those that chuse him are first the <HI>Livory-men,</HI> or Members of the several Companies of Tradesmen within the City,
<PB N="320" REF="181"/>and at last the Aldermen; which is done in this manner. First, the Livery-Men do usu∣ally put up four Candidates, out of which they chuse two by the Plurality of Voices; and, out of these two, the Court of Alder∣men select whom they think fit. And, though they be free in their Choice, yet commonly they have a regard for the Senior Alderman that has not been Lord Mayor, and give him the Precedence.</P>
<P>The Mayor Elect being Proclaimed, is sworn first at Guildhall, and afterwards at Westmin∣ster. There he swears to maintain the Pri∣viledges of the People; and here, to be True to the King.</P>
<P>The Installation-Day is the 29th of October, a Month after the Election. The Solemnity of which Day upon his Account is so great, that no Magistrate in Europe appears with so much state and grandure as the Mayor of London upon his Installation. First, he go's by water to Westminster in his Barge of state, accompanied with the Aldermen in all their Formalities, with their Scarlet Robes and Chains of gold hanging before their Breasts. The Twelve Companies also, in their several Barges, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et out with their Arms, Colours, and Screamers on both sides, attend him in their furred Gowns. In his way he is saluted from the Shore with the noise of great Guns; and, as he passes by Whitehall, the King from thence viewing the Solemnity gives him and his Brethren a Mark of his Respect. At last being landed at Westminster Bridge, the seve∣ral Companies march in order to their Hall, and after them the Mayor and Aldermen, with the Sword and Mace before them, the Sword∣bearer with his Cap of Maintenance on his
<PB N="321" REF="181"/>head. At their Entrance into the Hall, the Hall is Intertained with the harmonious Mu∣sick of a Set of Hoboys, marching in order before them, and playing all the Way. First they walk round the Hall, where they pay their respects to each Court of Judicature; and from the Hall they proceed to the Exche∣quer-Chamber, where the New Lord Mayor is Sworn by the Barons. This done, they walk again in Procession round the Hall, to invite the several Judges of each Court to Dinner at Guildhall. And, after this, the whole Procession returns in the same man∣ner by Water to Black-Friars. From whence the Lord Mayor and Aldermen make their Cavalcade to Guildhall, all mounted upon Horses richly Caparisoned; the Livery-Men marching before in good order. And now the <HI>Artillery men</HI> make their best appearance, with their Buff-coats and Head-pieces. But the most diverting Sight is that of the <HI>Pageants,</HI> here and there in motion to divert the Spectators. At last a most splendid Din∣ner, to which, besides the Judges, many of the great Lords and Ladies, the Privy Coun∣sellours, the forein Embassadors, and often∣times the King and Queen are invited, con∣cludes the Solemnity.</P>
<P>Such is the Magnificence of the Lord Mayor of London, though always a Citizen and Tradesman, being a Member of one of the 12 Companies. Who, for his great Dignity, is usually Knighted by the King, before the Year of his Mayoralty be expired; unless he had received that Honour before, whilst he was an Alderman, as of late has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣shal.</P>
<PB N="322" REF="182"/>
<P>His Authority reaches, not only all over this great City and part of the Suburbs, (except some particular Places) but also on the Thames as far as the Mouth of it, and Westward as far as Stanes-Bridge.</P>
<P>And so great is his Power, that he may cause any Person inhabiting within London, or the Liberties thereof, to be Summoned to appear before him, upon the Complaint of any Citizen; and, for Non-appearance, may grant his Warrant to bring such Person before him. For he has Power to determine Differ∣ences between Party and Party.</P>
<P>His Attendance, whilst he is a Mayor, is very considerable. For, besides his proper Servants, first he has four principal Officers that wait on him as Lord Mayor, who are reputed Esquires by their Places. And those are the <HI>Sword-bearer,</HI> the <HI>Common Hunt,</HI> the <HI>Common Crier,</HI> and the <HI>Water-Bayliff;</HI> whose Places are very advantageous, and purchased (when vacant) at a great rate from the Lord Mayor for the time being. Besides them, there is the <HI>Coroner,</HI> 3 <HI>Sergeants Carvers,</HI> 3 <HI>Sergeants of the Chamber,</HI> 1 <HI>Sergeant of the Channel,</HI> 4 <HI>Yeomen of the Waterside,</HI> 1 <HI>Ʋnder Water-Bayliff,</HI> 2 <HI>Yeomen of the Chamber,</HI> 3 <HI>Meal∣Weighers,</HI> 2 <HI>Yeomen of the Wood-Wharf,</HI> and several others. Most of which have Servants allowed them, with Livories. Among which the <HI>Sword-bearer</HI> has a 1000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year allow∣ed him for his Table in the Lord Mayor's House.</P>
<P>When he appears abroad on horseback (which is his usual Appearance) 'tis with rich Caparison, and always in long Robes, sometimes of fine Scarlet-Cloth richly furred, sometimes Purple, and sometimes Puke, with
<PB N="323" REF="182"/>a black Velvet Hood over his Robes, and a great Chain of Gold (with a rich Jewel to it) hanging from his Neck downwards. At∣tended by several Officers walking before, and on both sides of him.</P>
<P>He keeps an open Table all the Year to all Comers of any quality; and so well fur∣nished, that it is always fit to receive the greatest Subject of England, or of any other Po∣tentate. He has a Priviledge to hunt, not only in Middlesex, but also in Essex and Sur∣rey, and for this purpose has a Kennel of Hounds always maintained. On the King's Coronation-Day he claims to be the chief Butler, and bears the King's Cup among the highest Nobles of the Kingdom which serve on that Day in other Offices. And, upon the King's Death, he is said to be the prime Person of England. Therefore, when King James I, was invited to come and take the Crown of England, <HI>Robert Lee,</HI> then May∣or of London, subscribed in the first place, before all the Officers of the Crown, and all the Nobility.</P>
<P>One Thing is observable, which hapned not long since. I mean four Mayors the City had in little more than half a Year; viz. <HI>Sir John Shorter, Sir John Eyles, Sir John Chapman,</HI> and <HI>Sir Thomas Pilkington.</HI> For, upon the Death of the first in September 1688, <HI>Sir John Eyles</HI> was made Lord Mayor; and in October fol∣lowing, the Charter being restored, <HI>Sir John Chapman</HI> was chosen Lord Mayor. Who dying in March following, <HI>Sir Thomas Pilkington</HI> was chosen in his room. In whose Person the Chance is turned almost quite contra∣ry. For, if he do's outlive the Time appointed for his Mayoralty by his late
<PB N="324" REF="183"/>Re-election, instead of being Mayor but one Year, according to the usual Course, his Mayoralty will reach near two Years and a half.</P>
<P>Next to the Lord Mayor there are
<LIST>
<ITEM>26 <HI>Aldermen,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>A <HI>Recorder,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Two <HI>Sheriffs,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>A <HI>Chamberlain.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Ʋnder-Sheriffs,</HI> the <HI>Town-Clerk</HI> (or <HI>Common Clerk,</HI>) and a <HI>Remembrancer,</HI> these two last being both Esquires by their Places.</P>
<P>The 26 Aldermen preside over the 26 Wards of the City, a peculiar Alderman being as∣signed to every Ward. Who has under him a certain Number of Common-Council-Men, and one of them his Deputy; besides Consta∣bles, Scavengers, Beadles, &amp;c. Now the Aldermen who have been Lord Mayors, and the three eldest Aldermen that have not yet arrived to that honourable estate, are by the City-Charter Justices of Peace of the City. Upon the Death of an Alderman, the Lord Mayor issues out his Precept to the Ward whereof he was Alderman, to chuse two substantial Men of the City, and return their Names to the Court of Aldermen. Which being done, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen select one of the two, such as they judge fittest for that Station.</P>
<P>The <HI>Recorder</HI> is usually a grave and learned Lawyer, well versed in the Laws and Customs of the City, and in that Capacity is an As∣sistant to the Lord Mayor. He takes his place in Councils, and in Court, before any Man that has not been Mayor; and 'tis he that de∣livers the Sentences of the whole Court.</P>
<PB N="325" REF="183"/>
<P>The two <HI>Sheriffs</HI> of this City are also <HI>She∣riffs</HI> of the County of Middlesex. They are yearly chosen in the Guildhall on Midsummer-Day, by the Livery-Men of the respective Companies, that is, by the Citizens from a∣mong themselves. A high Priviledge, consi∣dering the Importance of this Magistracy, e∣specially in their power of Impanelling Juries. Yet my Lord Mayor by his Prerogative may drink to any Citizen, and nominate him to be one of the Sheriffs; In which Case the Usage has been for the Commons to confirm such a Person, and to elect another to serve with him. However, the new-chosen Sheriffs are not sworn till Michaelmas Eve, and till then they do not enter upon their Office. If any of the Parties chosen refuse to hold, he in∣ours a Penalty of 450 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> unless he do take his Oath, that he is not worth ten thousand pounds.</P>
<P>Each <HI>Sheriff</HI> has under him an <HI>Ʋnder-She∣riff,</HI> and six <HI>Clerks,</HI> viz. a Secondary, a Clerk of the Papers, and four other Clerks. He has also a certain Number of <HI>Sergeants,</HI> and every Sergeant a <HI>Yeoman.</HI> The <HI>Ʋnder-Sheriffs</HI> have also <HI>Clerks</HI> under them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chamberlain</HI> is an Officer of great Power in the City. For without him no man can set up Shop, or follow his Trade without being sworn before him; neither can one be bound an Apprentice to any Tradesman, but by his Licence. He may Imprison any that disobey's his Summons, or anv Apprentice that misdemeans himself, or else he may punish him in another man∣ner.</P>
<PB N="326" REF="184"/>
<P>But these are only general Notions of the chief Officers and Magistrates of London; for the Particulars, I refer you to the Courts of Judicature, in my Third Part.</P>
<P>In relation to Trade, which is the Life of this City, the Traders thereof are divided in∣to <HI>Companies,</HI> which are so many Bodies Po∣litique, all injoying large Privileges granted by former Kings unto them.</P>
<P>Those Companies are in all about 70, twelve whereof are called the Chief Compa∣nies. Viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Mercers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Grocers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Drapers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Fishmongers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Goldsmiths,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Skinners,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Merchant Taylors</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Haberdashers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Salters,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Iron-Mongers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Vintners,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Cloth-Workers.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Each Company (or Mystery) has a Master yearly chosen from among themselves; and other subordinate Governours, called War∣dens, and Assistants. Such is the Harmony of this Government, that these Companies do exactly correspond to the general Govern∣ment of the City by a Lord Mayor and Com∣mon Council, who are selected out of these several Companies. For he that is chosen Lord Mayor must be free of one of these 12 Companies; and, if he be of any other Company, he presently removes to one of these. Which have got so great Credit and Reputation in the World, that several Kings have honoured some of them by taking their Freedom thereof. The present King was late∣ly pleased to accept of the Freedom of the
<PB N="327" REF="184"/>Company of Grocers; presented to Him in a golden Box in the Name of the City by Mr. <HI>Box;</HI> upon which he was Knighted by His Majesty.</P>
<P>In short, such are the Priviledges of the Citizens of London, that they are Toll-free throughout England. And the Lord Mayor usually, at the Request of any Citizen that trades in remote Parts, grants him his War∣rant or Certificate.</P>
<P>They have also the Priviledge to keep out all Artificers and Handicraftsmen not free of the City. So that if a Freeman of London do imploy any such to work within the City or Liberties, he is liable to the Forfeiture of 5 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Day, and an Action lies against him for the same. An Alien indeed may be imploy'd six Weeks, but no longer. And how severe soever this may seem to Foreiners, yet it is grounded upon Equity. For were it not for that Priviledge, here would be such a Con∣course of Foreiners, that it would prove (as it has by Experience) the utter undoing of a great Number of poor Citizens and Free∣men, whose Livelyhood depends upon their Handicrafts.</P>
<P>Another great Priviledge they have, is their sending no less than four Members to Par∣liament, which is twice the Number of other Cities and Borough-Towns in England. And it is observable, that their Members do usu∣ally appear in their Scarlet-Robes the first Day the Parliament sits, when all other Mem∣bers (except the Speaker of the House) ap∣pear in their usual Habit.</P>
<PB N="328" REF="185"/>
<P>Thus the Lord Mayor of London, under the gracious Influences of the English Mo∣narchs, makes a Figure more like a Prince than a Subject. And the Citizens of London, though under the same general Government as all the rest of the Kings Subjects, yet live within themselves, blest with so many Advan∣tages, that I can compare them no better than to the old Citizens of Rome under the best of their Emperours.</P>
<P>And indeed the main Thing which has in∣couraged Trade here to that degree as to ren∣der this Place so rich and flourishing, is the great Charters, Priviledges, and Immunities it is invested with, by the Munificence of several of the former Kings. Whereby the Londoners are Impowered to chuse their own Magistrates, to do themselves Justice, to main∣tain their own Peace, and pursue all the good and advantagious Ends of Trade, with the better Success and greater Security. In or∣der to which they keep within them∣selves many Courts and Councils, where they make Laws for the better Govern∣ment of the several Ranks and Orders of Men among them. And, though these grand Priviledges were judged to be for∣feited by the Court of Kings Bench upon the <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> brought in at the latter end of Charles II his Reign, and a new Charter granted the City, but with several Restrictions of great moment; yet that Judgement was Reversed upon their late Application to the Parliament, and their ancient Charter Con∣firmed. So that Things run now, as they did before that Judgment, in their proper Channel.</P>
<PB N="329" REF="185"/>
<P>For Military Affairs, the City of <HI>London</HI> is a Lieutenancy of it self. So that the Power of a Lord Lieutenant is in the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and other principal Members of the City, for the Time being. Who, by a peculiar Commission from His Ma∣jesty, are authorized to act as his Lieutenants in London, for the ordering the City-Mi∣litia, with the same Power that the Lord Lieutenants have in their respective Coun∣ties.</P>
<P>Now the City-Militia consists of 6 Regi∣ments of Foot, making about 90000 men; besides the Hamlets of the Tower 2 Regiments, and the Regiment of Southwark. To which if we add the Militia of Westminster, consist∣ing of 2 Regiments, called Holborn and West∣minster, each of 2000 men, we find in all eleven Regiments. But, in case of Necessity the Auxiliaries are raised, consisting of Ap∣prentices, which make up six Regiments more; every Freeman that has two Apprentices find∣ing one for that purpose.</P>
<P>To supply the City Train-Bands and Auxiliary men with Commanders, there is a Nursery of Souldiers, called the <HI>Artillery Com∣pany,</HI> of above 60 Years standing. This Company consists of 600 choice men, com∣manded in chief by the King, and under his Majesty by a Leader. Who exercises this Company every Tuesday fortnight in the Artillery-Ground, a spacious Place near Moorfields, inclosed for that purpose with a fair Brick-Wall. And the other Tuesday the Exercise is performed by the several Mem∣bers of the Company, who are there trained up to command, most of them being Com∣manders of the Train-Bands. They have a
<PB N="330" REF="186"/>Court-Marshal, consisting of a President, Vice-President, Colonel, and 24 Members of the Company. On the second Tuesday in February is their general Rendezvous every Year, when they chuse their Officers. Which, besides the Leader, are two Lieutenants, 2 Ensigns, 2 Sergeants, a Provost Marshal, 3 Gentlemen of Arms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Church-Government is by the Bishop of London. The Parishes whereof, for the most part provided with able and eminent Divines under the Title of Rector or Vicar, are under his Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>And, for maintaining these Divines, with their Families, there is in most Parishes a Parsonage, or Vicarage-House, with a yearly Allowance, besides the Perquisites arising from Christenings, Marriages, and Burials. Which Allowance, since the Reformation, falls much short of what it was in the time of Popery; when, besides the Tythes of the Trades∣mens Gains, the Mortuaries, Obits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Priest (tho' in a state of Celibacy) had 3 shillings and 5 pence in the pound of the yearly Rent of all the Houses and Shops in his Parish. Which afterwards was brought to 2 shillings, 9 pence in the pound, by an Act of Parliament under the Reign of Hen∣ry VIII, and that confirmed by a subsequent Act. But, since the Reformation, this being lookt upon as too large an Allowance, it has been so curtailed, that 'twill be hard to bring back that golden Age. 'Tis true under the Reign of Charles II. a Regulation was made by Act of Parliament, but it concerned only those Parishes, whose Churches had been demo∣lished by the dreadfull Fire. And, according
<PB N="331" REF="186"/>to the several Extents of Parishes, the Par∣sons thereof, by virtue of that Act, have a certain yearly Allowance, none under 100 Pounds, and none above 200; but most be∣tween one and two hundred Pounds. The same to be raised, in lieu of Tythe, within the said respective Parishes, by rating the Hou∣ses and Shops therein proportionably to their respective Rents. As to those Parishes all over the City and Suburbs where there is, besides the Parson, a Lecturer, he has his maintenance no otherwise than by a voluntary Contribution from the Parishio∣ners.</P>
<P>As for the City of Westminster, the Dean and Chapter are invested with all man∣der of Jurisdiction, both Civil and Ecclesia∣stical; not only within the City of West∣minster, but also in other Places of their Ju∣risdiction, as the Precincts of S. Martin le Grand within the Walls of London, and some Towns in Essex. The Dean in particular has a Commission of Peace within the City and Liberties of Westminster.</P>
<P>The principal Officer in it, called the High Steward of Westminster, is usually one of the prime Nobility. Under whom there is a De∣puty Steward, then the Bayliff, and the two high Burgesses, these chosen every Year.</P>
<P>Within the Precincts of Westminster, but chiefly near the Court, the Nobility and Gen∣try take up for the most part their Quarters. But the proper Station of the Lawyers is in their Inns, between the City and the Court; and that of Merchants and Seamen, in and a∣bout the East-end of the City.</P>
<PB N="332" REF="187"/>
<P>Thus you have a short Description of the famous City of London, the Metropolis of England, the Seat of the British Empire, the Epitome and Glory of this Kingdom. A City which for Greatness, Beauty, Conveni∣encies, Plenty of Provisions, Commerce, Riches, and good Government, is inferiour to none beyond Sea. 'Tis a Magazine of all sorts of Commodities, necessary or expedient for the Use or Pleasure of Mankind. The great Rendez-vous of the Nobility, Gentry, Cour∣tiers, Divines, Lawyers, Physicians, Mer∣chants, Seamen, of the best Artificers, the most refined Wits, and the greatest Beauties of the Land.</P>
<P>For a constant Supply of Provisions, here are abundance of <HI>Markets,</HI> the best furnished of any in Christendom; but especially <HI>Leaden-Hall-Market,</HI> near the Royal Exchange in the City, the greatest Flesh-Market about the City, and a great Magazine of Corn. So that there is scarce a great City in Europe, where poor People, or such as love a frugal Life, may live cheaper, or the splendid Liver, gallanter.</P>
<P>To get a Livelyhood, and raise himself in the World, no Place like this; by Me∣chanick or Liberal Arts, by Merchandizing, Offices, Preferments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>For Conveniencies and Delight, here all is at hand; and scarce any Thing wanting, that Money can purchase. In point of So∣ciety, here learned and unlearned, high and low, rich and poor, good and bad, may fit themselves any where.</P>
<P>And this I must needs say to the Praise of <HI>London,</HI> that, there is not a Place in Eu∣rope of such a vast Confluence of all sorts of
<PB N="333" REF="187"/>People, where Murders and Outrages, so fre∣quent in great and populous Cities beyond Sea, are so seldom heard of. Which argues a great deal of Wisdom in the Magistrate, that so great a Body should be kept in so good Order.</P>
<P><HI>William the Conquerour,</HI> to prevent Disorders and Mischiefs in the Night, commanded that in every Town and Village a Bell (called <HI>Curfew-Bell,</HI> a Corrupt Word from the French <HI>Couvre-feu</HI>) should be rung every Night at 8 of the Clock, and that all people should then put out their Fire and Candle. This continued in his Reign, and that of his next Successor <HI>William Rufus.</HI> But <HI>Henry</HI> I. revoked that Order; and <HI>Henry</HI> III. Anno 1253. command∣ed Watches to be kept in Cities and Boroughs, for the Preservation of Peace and Quietness among his Subjects.</P>
<P>Therefore there are in the respective Streets of London to this day convenient Stations for the Watchmen; who are to examine all Persons walking in unseasonable Hours, and to secure till next Day such as are either sus∣picious or riotous. And then they bring them before a Justice of Peace, who deals with them according to the Merit of the Cause. Thus Murders, Robberies, Felonies, Fires, and other Evils, are oftentimes pre∣vented; which could not be avoided in so great and populous a Place, where a great many wicked People ly lurking for Mischief. This Duty of Watching is commonly perform∣ed by Men hired for that purpose, and paid for't by the Citizens, under the Command of a Constable, assisted by the Eeadle of the Parish. In case of a publick Riot, the King usually sends a Party of his Gards to sup∣press
<PB N="334" REF="188"/>it; and, if occasion requires, part of the Militia is raised.</P>
<P>But, to draw to a Conclusion, if we cast our Eyes upon the vast Traffick and Com∣merce, whereby this Place is become so flou∣rishing, it will every where afford matter of Admiration. The same does plainly appear by the Customs yearly paid for all Merchan∣dise Imported and Exported, by the great Wealth of many Citizens, by the infinite Number of Shops both in the City and Su∣burbs for the Retailing Trade, and lastly by the incredible Abundance of Apprentices which are here brought up to all manner of Trades.</P>
<P>The Customs for this City alone (tho' ve∣ry moderate, in comparison of most other Places in Europe) did lately amount to near 400000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year. The Wealth of the Citi∣zens so vast, that some of 'em, for great E∣states in Mony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> excel some Princes be∣yond Sea; and live accordingly in great state and plenty, few so penuriously as most of the Dutch Merchants do. The Number of Shops both in the City and Suburbs so great, and indeed so far beyond that of any forei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> City, that it is to Strangers a just Matter of Amazement. Proportionable to which is That of the Apprentices, reckoned to be at least forty thousand.</P>
<P>Now this great Trade of the Londoners runs into three several Streams, 1. among them∣selves, 2 in the Country, and 3 beyond Sea, of which in my second Part.</P>
<P>Only I shall observe here, that the vast Trade of this Place has chiefly occasioned that great Appearance in it of <HI>Pictures in the
<PB N="335" REF="188"/>Air,</HI> a Thing taken particular notice of at the first view by Strangers. I mean the Multi∣tude of Signs which hang before the Houses; many of them very rich and costly, and all together yielding a fine Prospect.</P>
<P>But, on the other side, its frequent <HI>Dirt</HI> in Winter, and <HI>Dust</HI> in Summer, are two such Nusances as take off very much from the Glory of it. And yet both of them might with ease be Remedied, and will (I hope) in time. For, in point of Cleanness, few Towns are better Seated than London is, standing upon an easy Ascent from the River. And the Allowance for it from each House∣keeper is so considerable, that one would think it enough to keep it cleaner than it is. But the Truth is, there's a sort of <HI>Chy∣mists,</HI> that can extract Gold out of Dirt. And I conjecture the less Care has been ta∣ken to take off that Reproach from so noble a City, because of the two great Conve∣niences it has to go free from the Dirt from one End of it to the other, that is, by Land in Coaches, and by Water in Boats. Besides that the principal Streets, and most of the New Buildings, are paved a good conveni∣ent Breadth on each side with smooth hewn Stone, for the benefit of Foot-Passengers. Which is a great Commodiousness, as well as an Ornament.</P>
<P>I conclude, as to <HI>Loudon,</HI> with three no∣table Conveniencies it has, not elsewhere to be found; Viz. the <HI>New Lights,</HI> the <HI>Peny-Post,</HI> and the <HI>Insurance-Office for Houses in case of</HI> Fire.</P>
<PB N="336" REF="189"/>
<P>The <HI>New Lights</HI> is so ingenious and usefull an Invention, that Mr. <HI>Edmund Heming</HI> the Inventor deserves an immortal Praise for it. He brought it to light about 6 Years ago, with a Patent from King Charles II, for the Injoyment of the Profits thereof. And such is the Reflexion of these Lights, tho' at a good distance from each other, that few of them serve to light a whole Street in the Night, better than ten times the Number of Glass Lanthorns. For, by the regular Position of one of them before the Front of every tenth House on each side of a broad Street, there is such a mutual Re∣flection, that they all seem to be but one great solar Light.</P>
<P>And so cheap is this Conveniency, that for five Shillings down and five Shillings a Year for five Years, to be paid at two Quar∣terly Payments, the Inventor obliges himself to light the Front of ones House from Mi∣chaelmas to Lady Day every Night from six to twelve, beginning the third Night after every Full-Moon, and ending the sixth Night after every New Moon, which is in all 120 Nights.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peny-Post</HI> is such a Contrivance, that for one Peny a Letter, or Parcel not ex∣ceeding one pound Weight, or ten pounds in value, is presently conveyed from all Parts of the Town and Suburbs to the remotest Places thereof. And it has been so far im∣proved, since the first settling of it, as to reath ten miles about London. He that sends pays the Peny; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, when the Letter or Parcel goes beyond the Bounds of the Weekly Bills of Mortality, the Receiver pays another Peny.</P>
<PB N="337" REF="189"/>
<P>To carry on this usefull Design, first there are about the Town four or five hundred Hou∣ses to take in Letters and Parcels. And, to convey them according to their Directi∣ons, there are about 100 messengers imploy∣ed from Morning to Night, to call every Hour at the said Houses, and take what Let∣ters and Parcels they find there. Who carry the same to their respective Offices, from whence the Letters and Parcels are dispatch∣ed away according to their Directions. The Offices are six in Number; Viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>The General</HI> Office.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>St. Paul's</HI> Office.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>The Temple</HI> Office.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Westminster</HI> Office.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Soutwark</HI> Office.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>The Hermitage</HI> Office.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>General Office</HI> is in Star-Court in Corn∣hill, and has 3 Clerks belonging to it; where∣as the rest have but two Clerks each.</P>
<P>The whole Concern is managed in chief by three Persons, a <HI>Comptroller,</HI> an <HI>Accomptant,</HI> and a <HI>Receiver.</HI> Every one of the <HI>Messengers,</HI> imployed in the bringing in and carrying out of Letters, gives 50 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Security by Bond to the Office for his Fidelity. And for this Contrivance the Publick is indebted to that ingenious Citizen of London, Mr. <HI>William Dockwrea,</HI> who settled it some Years since, not without much trouble and cost. But the late King, when Duke of York, sued him for the lame, as his Right, and carried it from the Inventor. So that the Benefit of it is now inherent in the Crown.</P>
<P>The <HI>Insurance Office for Houses in case of Fire</HI> is also an Invention worth our taking notice. To Insure, for example, 100 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> upon a Brick∣house,
<PB N="338" REF="190"/>the Rates are 6 Shillings for one Year, 12 for two Years, 18 for three Years; and double for a Timber-house. But, if any Insure for four Years, there is a Discount allowed for paying down the Mony, so that he pays but three Years and a Quarter; and propor∣tionably five for seven, seven for eleven Years Insurance. And, as often as the House is Burnt, or Demolished by reason of Fire, within the Term Insured, the Mony Insured on the House is to be paid; but, if only Damaged, then to be Repaired at the Charge of the Office. For the security of which Payment, the Office has a Fund to the Value of 60000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> in Ground-Rents of Inheritance (which is above 2600 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum</HI>) to answer Los∣ses and Damages; and settled on Twelve Gentlemen Trustees, by many of the most eminent Counsel at Law.</P>
<P>This Ingenious and Usefull Invention was first put into practice about 8 Years since, and has deservedly met with good Incourage∣ment, insomuch that there are now above 7300 Houses Insured. The Office is kept on the Back-side of the Royal-Exchange, and at the Rainbow Coffee-house by the Inner-Temple Gate in Fleetstreet.</P>
<P>Now, to put a present stop, as far as is possible, to any su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den Fire, there are be∣longing to the Office a great many stout and lusty Servants in Livery with Badges, dwelling in several parts of the City, and always to be ready on all Occasions of sud∣den Fires. Who, in such Cases, do common∣ly expose themselves to the utmost Hazards, and with great Dexterity labour to suppress the Fire.</P>
<PB N="339" REF="190"/>
<P>There is also another <HI>Office of Insuring of Houses,</HI> called the <HI>Friendly Society,</HI> by a mutual Contribution agreed to by the Trustees; That every Member of that Society shall pay year∣ly at the Office, before hand, only one shil∣ling four pence for every 100 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> secured up∣on Timber-houses by way of <HI>Praemium.</HI> By this Office there are likewise a great many Houses secured.</P>
<P>To conclude, the <HI>Arms</HI> of the City of Lon∣don are <HI>Argent,</HI> a <HI>Cross Gules,</HI> with the <HI>Swerd of St. Paul.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Oxford.</HEAD>
<P><HI>OXFORD,</HI> or <HI>Oxon,</HI> the principal Place of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> which from hence takes its De∣nomination, bears from London West-North-West, and is distant therefrom 47 miles, thus.

<PB N="340" REF="191"/>
<P>'Tis finely seated, for health, for pleasure▪ and plenty, at the Influx of the <HI>Charwell</HI> in∣to the <HI>Isis;</HI> where this divides it self into several Streams, wherewith and the Charwell most part of the City is incompassed. But, for the Conveniency of its Inhabitants, here are several Bridges.</P>
<P>This is so ancient a City, as to fetch her Original from the Time of the Britains. So large, as to contain 13 Parish-Churches, besides the Cathedral. And so beautifull, that whether one looks on the compacted U∣niformity of private Houses, or the Magnifi∣cence of the publick Structures, it must be allowed to be a fair and goodly City.</P>
<P>Besides the Glory of being a most fa∣mous University, it is honoured with a Bi∣shops See, founded by King Henry VIII. An∣no 1541. and has been dignify'd above 500 years successively with the Title of an Earl∣dom in twenty of the noble Family of the <HI>Veres.</HI> The first that injoyed it was <HI>Aubrey de Vere,</HI> created Earl of Oxford by Henry II.

<P>As it is an University, this may be said o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it in general, without immodesty, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hope without dislike or envy, That for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stateliness of the Schools and publick Libra∣ry, the bravery and beauty of particular Co∣ledges all built of fair and polished Stone the liberal Indowments of those Houses and notable Incouragements of Industr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Learning in the Salary of the Professo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in most Arts and Sciences, it is not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parallelled in the Christian World; and for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>That <HI>Oxford</HI> has been for many Ages a Place of publick Studies, is a Thing past all doubt. But it is true withal, that there has been a Time of Decay; when this City sharing with the rest of the Land in those common Calamities brought by the Saxons and Danes, the Muses were dispersed, and shifted for themselves. <HI>Alfred,</HI> the learned Sa∣ron King of England, was he that recalled them; who, having intirely subjected the irk∣som Danes to his Government, made it his business to restore this University, and re∣pair the Ruins thereof. And, the better to in∣vite Students to Oxford, he sent thither his Son <HI>Ethelward,</HI> which dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the young Nobles from all Parts to <HI>Oxford.</HI> This came to pass about the latter end of the ninth Cen∣tury. Then <HI>Oxford</HI> began to flourish again, and by degrees to grow to what it is.</P>
<P>But, as now in <HI>Leyden</HI> and many other forein Universities, so anciently in Oxford the Students lived in Citizens Houses, having only Meeting Places to hear Lectures and Disputations, and that without any distincti∣on of Habit. After that, there were divers Houses (now called Halls) for Students only to live together in Society, as now the Inns of Court and of Chancery at London. A∣mongst which some afterwards Indowed by the bounty of divers Patrons of Learning; who thought best to settle for ever plenti∣tiful Revenues in Lands and Houses, in order to maintain such Students as by merit and worth should from time to time be chosen,
<PB N="342" REF="192"/>and to settle large Salaries for Professors to inftruct 'em, and for a Head to govern them, according to certain Statutes and Ordinances made by the said Patrons or Founders. And these are the <HI>Colledges,</HI> whereof the first thus Indowed in Europe were <HI>Ʋniversity, Baliol,</HI> and <HI>Merton Colledges.</HI></P>
<P>In short, there are in Oxford 18 of such Indowed <HI>Colledges,</HI> and 7 <HI>Halls.</HI> In which Halls the Students live with the same Disci∣pline as those in the Colledges, but upon their own Means, except certain Exhibitions (or annual Pensions) annext to one or two of them. The Names of the Colledges, and their Founders, together with the Time of their Foundation, you have in the following Table.</P>

<P>Now, to make a particular Description of those stately Colledges, their Halls, Chappels, and Libraries, their excellent Accommodation for young Noblemen and Gentlemen, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arge Revenues, great Salaries for publick Professors, and Allowances for poor Scholars, &amp;c. would require another Volume. But this I must say of the <HI>Bodlean Library,</HI> a no∣table
<PB N="344" REF="193"/>lightsom Fabrick, that for Number of choice Books, rare Manuscripts, diversity of Languages, liberty of studying, and facility of finding any Book, it scarce falls short of the famous Vatican. The New <HI>Theatre,</HI> built for Scholastick Exercises by Dr. <HI>Sheldon,</HI> the late most Reverend Archbishop of Canter∣bury, is so curious a Piece of Architecture, that it were a Trespass not to take notice of it. And the publick <HI>Physick Garden,</HI> sur∣rounded with stately Stone-Walls, and abound∣ing with Variety of choice Plants, is so de∣lightful a Place, that I could not do less than mention it.</P>
<P>But the lately erected <HI>Musaeum,</HI> finished in the Year 1683, deserves a brief Account. 'Tis a large and stately Pile of squared Stone, built at the Charge of the University, and designed not only to advance the Studies of true and real Philosophy, but also to conduce to the Uses of Life, and the Improvement of Physick. This Building borders upon the West-end of the Theater, having a stately Portal on that side, sustained by Pillars of the Corinthian Order. But the Front of it is to the Street Northward. It consists of ten Rooms, whereof the three principal and larg∣est are publick, being in length about 56 foot, and in breadth 25. The uppermost is properly the <HI>Musaeum Ashmoleanum,</HI> so called from <HI>Elias Ashmole</HI> Esquire, who inriched it with a noble Collection of Curiosities. To which have been added since several Hiero∣glyphicks, and other Aegyptian Antiquities by Dr. <HI>Robert Huntington;</HI> an intire Mum∣my, by Mr. <HI>Aaron Goodyear;</HI> a large Cabinet of Natural Rarities, by <HI>Martin Lister,</HI> Dr. of Physick; besides several Roman Antiqui∣ties,
<PB N="345" REF="193"/>as Altars, Medals, Lamps, &amp;c. found here in England. So that in a few Years this is like to be one of the most famous Re∣positories in Europe. The middle Room is the School of Natural History, where the Professor of Chymistry reads 3 times a Week, on Mundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, during the time of the Chymical Course, which continues a whole Month. His Busi∣ness is to explain the natures, qualities, and virtues, &amp;c. of all natural Bodies, relating to and made use of in Chymical Preparations. The lower Room is the Laboratory, furnish∣ed with all sorts of Furnaces, and other Ma∣terials, in order to Chymical Practice. Near unto which is the Store-Room for Chymical Preparations, and another fitted for a Chy∣mical Library.</P>
<P>Now every Colledge has within its own Walls Lectures and Disputations in all Libe∣ral Arts; and some of them publick Le∣ctures for all Comers, with large Salaries for the Readers. Insomuch that they seem to be so many Universities.</P>
<P>The whole Number of Students in Oxford, that live upon the Revenues of the Colledges, is about One thousand; and of other Students, about twice as many. Besides Stewards, Manciples, Butlers, Cooks, Porters, Garden∣ers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He that intends to take any Degree is to take his Diet and Lodging, and have a Tu∣tor constantly, in some Colledge or Hall; where he must be subject to all Statutes, and to the Head of the House. He must be likewise subject to the chief Magistrate of the University, and the publick Statutes thereof. He is constantly to wear a black Cap and
<PB N="346" REF="194"/>Gown, only the Sons of Noblemen are herein indulged. By Night all Scholars are to be shut up in their several Houses. And, before they can attain to any Degree, they must per∣form all Exercises.</P>
<P>The <HI>Degrees</HI> taken in the University are in Arts properly but two, viz. of <HI>Batchelour</HI> and <HI>Master.</HI> To take the Degree of <HI>Batchelor</HI> is required 4 Years, and 3 Years more for to be <HI>Master of Arts.</HI></P>
<P>In the three Professions of Divinity, Law, and Physick, there is a higher Degree, that of <HI>Doctor,</HI> which requires a great deal more time. For, to attain unto it, a Master of Arts must be first capable of being a <HI>Batche∣lor</HI> in any of those Professions; which in Divinity requires 7 Years more, in Law or Physick most commonly but 3. And, after that, before the Degree of <HI>Doctor</HI> can be had, 4 Years more is requisite.</P>
<P>The Exercises required for taking these Degrees are many, and difficult enough; yet not such but that they may be performed in less time by any Man of good Abilities. But so much Time is required, first because Judgement and Discretion comes with Time and Years; and perhaps, that those of slower Parts might by Time and Industry make them∣selves capable of that Honour, as well as those of quicker Abilities.</P>
<P>The Time of compleating the Degree of <HI>Batchelor of Arts</HI> is in Lent, at which time there commonly proceed about 200 Batche∣lors. And that of compleating the Degree of <HI>Master of Arts,</HI> or of <HI>Doctor</HI> in any of the three Professions, is always the Munday after the sixth of July, when there proceed <HI>Ma∣sters</HI> or <HI>Doctors</HI> yearly about 150. Then is
<PB N="347" REF="194"/>the <HI>Act,</HI> that is the Time, not only for pub∣lick Exercises, but also for Feastings and Comedies, unless some extraordinary Occa∣sion do hinder it. Which draw's a mighty Concourse of Strangers from all Parts to their Friends and Relations then compleat∣ing their Degrees. Whereby, and by the set Fees, it usually costs a Doctor about 100 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> sterling, and a Master of Arts 20 or 30 pounds.</P>
<P>But, besides these famous Societies in the Colledges and Halls of this University, there is another lately established, by the Name of the <HI>Philosophical Society,</HI> for the Improvement of real and experimental Philosophy. This Society (being much of the same nature as the Royal Society at London, with whom they have settled a Correspondency) meets every Tuesday in the Afternoon, by the per∣mission and favour of the Government, in the Natural History-School.</P>
<P>Lastly, as this City consists of two sorts of Inhabitants, Students and Citizens, living one among another, so they are wholly sepa∣rate for Government and Manners.</P>
<P>The chief Magistrate of the University is called the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> who is usually One of the prime Nobility, and nearest in favour with the King; Elected by the Students themselves in Convocation, to continue <HI>du∣rante Vita.</HI> Whose Office is to take care of the Government of the whole University, to maintain the Liberties and Priviledges there∣of, to call Assemblies to hear and determine Controversies, to call Courts, punish Delin∣quents, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="348" REF="195"/>
<P>The next is the <HI>Vice-Chancellor,</HI> who is yearly nominated by the Chancellor, and is commonly the Head of some Colledge. His Duty is, in the Chancellor's absence, to do whatever almost the Chancellour might do if he were present. He keeps Judicial Courts, wholly ruled by the Civil Law, which all Members of the University are subject to. And, by Charter of Henry IV, it is left to his Choice, whether any Member in the Uni∣versity there inhabiting, accused for Felony or High Treason, shall be tried by the Laws of the Land, or by the Laws and Customs of the University. Though now, where Life or Limb is concerned, the Criminal is left to be tried by the Laws of the Land. But in all Suits for Debts, Accounts, Contracts, Injuries, &amp;c. betwixt the Students, he is the proper Judge; and has Power to determine such Causes, to Imprison, to give corporal Punish∣ment, to excommunicate, to suspend, and to banish.</P>
<P>'Tis the Vice-Chancellor's Business to see, that Sermons, Lectures, Disputations, and other Exercises, be performed; that lewd people, Hereticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be expelled the University, and the Converse with Stu∣dents; that the Proctors, and other Officers of the University, duly perform their Duty; that Courts be duly called, and Law-Suits determined without delay. In a word, that whatever is for the Honour and Benefit of the University, or may conduce to the Ad∣vancement of good Literature, may be care∣fully obtained.</P>
<P>Next to the Vice-Chancellor are the two <HI>Proctors,</HI> yearly chosen by turns out of the several Colledges. These are to assist in the
<PB N="349" REF="195"/>Government of the University; more parti∣cularly in the business of Scholastick Exer∣cises, and taking Degrees, in searching after and punishing all Violaters of Statutes or Pri∣viledges of the University, all Night-Walkers, &amp;c. They have also the Oversight of Weights and Measures, that Students may not be wronged.</P>
<P>Next in order is the <HI>Publick Orator.</HI> Whose Charge is to write Letters, according to the Orders of the Convocation or Congregation; and, at the Reception of any Prince or great Person that comes to see the University, to make proper Harangues, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then there is the <HI>Custos Archivorum,</HI> or Keeper of Records. Whose Duty is to collect and keep the Charters, Priviledges, and Records that concern the University; to be always ready to produce them before the chief Officers; and to plead the Rights and Priviledges of the University.</P>
<P>Lastly, there is a <HI>Register</HI> of the Univer∣fity; whose Office is to register all Transacti∣ons in Convocations, Congregations, Delega∣cies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Besides the foresaid Officers, there are cer∣tain publick Servants, the chief whereof are the six <HI>Beadles,</HI> and the <HI>Verger.</HI> Three of the first are called <HI>Squire Beadles,</HI> who carry large Maces of Silver gilt; and the other three, <HI>Yeomen Beadles,</HI> whose Maces are of Silver but ungilt. Their Office is always to wait on the Vice-Chancellor in publick, doing what belongs to his Place; and, at his Command, to seize any Delinquent, and carry him to Prison; to summon, and publish the Calling of Courts or Convocations, to conduct Preachers to Church, and Lecturers to School,
<PB N="350" REF="196"/>&amp;c. But, upon Solemnities, the <HI>Verger</HI> ap∣pears with a Silver Rod in his hand; and, walking with the other six before the Vice-Chancellor, is to observe his Commands, and to wait on Grand Compounders, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned several great Priviledges, granted by former Kings to this University. That of sending two Burgesses to Parliament they hold from King James I. An∣other, that no Victuals be taken by the King's Purveyors within 5 miles of Oxford, unless the King himself comes thither, is of a much more ancient Date.</P>
<P>But one of the most considerable is That granted by Charter of King Edward III, whereby the Mayor of Oxford is to obey the Orders of the Vice-Chancellor, and be in subjection to him. Accordingly the May∣or, with the chief Burgesses in Oxford, and the High-Sheriff of Oxfordshire besides, eve∣ry Year in a solemn manner take an Oath, given by the Vice-Chancellor, to observe and conserve the Rights, Priviledges, and Li∣berties of the University of Oxford. And every Year on the tenth of February, be∣ing the Day of <HI>S. Scholastica,</HI> a certain Num∣ber of the principal Burgesses, publickly and solemnly do pay to each Colledge a Peny, in token of their Submission to the Orders and Rights of the University.</P>
<P>Thus you have a short Description of <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> as a City and an University. My next Business is the Description of <HI>Cam∣bridge.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="University town">
<HEAD>Cambridge.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAMBRIDGE,</HI> the chief Town of Cambridgeshire, and that from whence the Country is denominated, bears from London
<PB N="351" REF="196"/>North by East, and is distant therefrom 44 miles, thus. From London to <HI>Waltham</HI> 12; to <HI>Ware,</HI> 8 more; thence to <HI>Puckeridge,</HI> 5; to <HI>Barkway,</HI> 7; and to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> 12 more.</P>
<P>'Tis seated at the Confluence of two Ri∣vers, the <HI>Cam</HI> and the <HI>Grant;</HI> which running from thence Northward in one Channel empty themselves in the Ouse, 3 miles above Ely. By these Rivers it is separated into two (but unequal) Parts, but they have Communication by a Bridge.</P>
<P>It is a Place of a large Extent, number∣ing 14 Parishes. And, according to Doctor <HI>Fuller's</HI> Observation in his Worthies of En∣gland, 'tis a Town within an University, whereas <HI>Oxford</HI> is an University within a Town. For in <HI>Cambridge</HI> the Colledges are not so surrounded with Streets as in <HI>Oxford,</HI> but for the generality seated in the Skirts of the Town, which afford them the better and more delightfull Walks and Gardens about them.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Oxford</HI> (as I said before) 18 Indowed Colledges, and 7 Halls. In <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI> there is but 12 Colledges, and 4 Halls. 'Tis true they are all Indowed, and generally so large that the Number of Students is com∣monly little different from that of <HI>Oxford.</HI> The Names of them, and of their Founders, together with the Time of their Foundation, you have in the following Table.</P>

<P>The Degrees at <HI>Cambridge</HI> are usually taken as at <HI>Oxford,</HI> except in Law and Physick. For at <HI>Cambridge</HI> six Years after one has taken the Degree of Master of Art, one may take the Degree of Batchelor; and, after five Years more, that of Doctor.</P>
<P>The Batchelors of Arts compleat their De∣gree in Lent, beginning at Ash-Wednesday. And the first Tuesday of July is always <HI>Dies Comitiorum,</HI> there called the <HI>Commencement,</HI> wherein the Masters of Arts and the Doctors of all Faculties compleat their Degrees re∣spectively.</P>
<P>Here is, as in Oxford, a <HI>Chancellor,</HI> a <HI>Vice-Chancellor,</HI> two <HI>Prectors,</HI> and a <HI>Register.</HI> But the <HI>Chancellor</HI> is not so <HI>durante Vita;</HI> for he may be elected every three years, or continue in the same Office <HI>durante tacito Consensu Senatus Cantabr.</HI></P>
<P>He has under him a <HI>Commissary,</HI> who holds a Court of Record of Civil Causes for all priviledged Persons and Scholars under the Degree of Master of Arts; where all Causes are try'd and determined by the Civil and Statute-Law, and by the Customs of the Uni∣versity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI> is a high Officer, chosen every Year on the 3d of Nov. by the Senate out of two Persons nominated by the Heads of the several Colledges and Halls.</P>
<P>Together with the two <HI>Proctors,</HI> chosen as at Oxford, there are two <HI>Taxers</HI> chosen; who with the Proctors look to the Weights and Measures, as Clerks of the Market.</P>
<P>Here are also three <HI>Esquire-Beadles,</HI> but only one <HI>Yeoman-Beadle.</HI></P>
<PB N="354" REF="198"/>
<P>The <HI>Mayor</HI> of the Town is like that of Oxford, subject to the University, and takes a solemn Oath, at the Entrance into his Office, to observe and conserve the Priviledges, Liberties, and Customs thereof. And on Fri∣day before St. Simon and Jude he brings with him to St. Maries Church, allotted for the Assembly of the whole University, two Al∣dermen, four Burgesses, and two of every Parish, to take their Oaths before the Vice-Chancellor, for the due search of Vagabonds, and suspected Persons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At the same time are sworn 14 Persons for the University, and 14 for the Town, to look to the Cleansing and Paving of the Streets.</P>
<P>The University has also a <HI>Court-Leet,</HI> held twice every Year, wherein are presented all Nusances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>What remains is the Question about the Antiquity of <HI>Cambridge</HI> as a Place of Learn∣ing, in opposition to <HI>Oxford.</HI> To me it ap∣pears to be in that respect of an older date than Oxford. For <HI>Cambridge,</HI> in the time of the Romans, (among whom it was known by the Name of <HI>Camboritum,</HI> or, as some Copies have it, <HI>Camboricum,</HI>) was a Roman Colony, mentioned in the best Copies among the 28 Cities of Britain. And the Roman Co∣lonies had their Schools of Learning, where∣in the several Professors of Arts and Sci∣ences did instruct both the Roman and Bri∣tish Youth. In the Bull of Pope Honorius the first, bearing date Febr. 20. 624, men∣tion is made of Priviledges granted to the University of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> The <HI>Bull</HI> says by <HI>Eleutherius,</HI> the 12th Bishop of Rome, who lived about the latter end of the second Cen∣tury, but King Arthur's <HI>Diploma</HI> says by
<PB N="355" REF="198"/>Lucius, a British King, the first Christian King in Europe, and Contemporary with the said Eleutherius. Which <HI>Diploma</HI> says, that King Lucius was converted by the preaching of the Doctors of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> for which reason he gave Priviledges to that University, which were confirmed by King Arthur. Whether the <HI>Diploma</HI> be counterfeit or not, or whe∣ther the aforesaid Priviledges were granted by King Lucius or Pope Eleutherius, is a Question by it self. Certain is, that both the <HI>Diploma</HI> and the <HI>Bull</HI> agree, in point of Time. So that here is Proof enough, to make it at least probable, that in the time of King Lucius and Pope Eleutherius there might be a sufficient Number of learn∣ed Men in Cambridge to have instructed King Lucius in the Christian Faith; and that Eluanus and Medwinus, who were sent by that King to Rome for his fuller Satisfa∣ction in that point, might be of that Num∣ber.</P>
<P>Upon these Grounds it must be granted, that <HI>Cambridge</HI> is a Place long since dedi∣cated unto Learning; and I doubt much whether Oxford (as great a Respect as I have for it) can pretend to so great an Anti∣quity.</P>
<P>But Dr. Heylin, an Oxonian, alledges a notable Reason for the Precedency of <HI>Oxford</HI> before <HI>Cambridge;</HI> Viz. the Resolution of the Commons in the first Parliament held under King James I. For (says he) when the Clerk of that House had put the Name of <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI> before <HI>Oxford,</HI> they taking disdainfully that <HI>Hysteron-Proteron</HI> commanded the Antiqui∣ties of both Universities to be searched, and after search made gave place to Oxford.</P>
<PB N="356" REF="199"/>
<P>To clear this Point, we must take notice, that both <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> since their first Foundation, lay for several Ages for∣lorn and discontinued, during the long Wars of the Saxons and Danes in this Island. Till <HI>Oxford</HI> had the happiness to be first restored by King Alfred, towards the latter end of the Ninth Century. Which from that time grew into such esteem, as to be counted one of the four principal Universities of Europe, the other three being <HI>Paris</HI> in France, <HI>Bono∣nia</HI> (now <HI>Bologna</HI>) in Italy, and <HI>Salamanca</HI> in Spain. Whereas <HI>Cambridge</HI> did not begin to flourish again, till the Reign of Henry I, for his Learning surnamed <HI>Beau-Clerc,</HI> that is in the beginning of the Twelfth Century. So that in point of Restauration, 'tis plain that <HI>Oxford</HI> has got the start of <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>But let us leave this Speculation of <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI> as an Academy, and look upon it as a Title of Honour. In this Point we shall find <HI>Cambridge</HI> to have the Preeminency. For it has been Dignify'd, not only with the Title of an Earldom in several eminent Persons, but also with the Title of a Dukedom, in four Sons of the late King James, when Duke of York. Three of them by the first Dutchess, <HI>Charles, James,</HI> and <HI>Edgar,</HI> who all died very young; and the fourth, by the last Dutchess <HI>Charles</HI> by Name, the short Hopes of the Popish Faction. Who, being born Nov. 7. 1677. died Dec. 12. following, and so lived but five Weeks.</P>
<P>Thus I have done with <HI>OXFORD</HI> and <HI>CAMBRIDGE,</HI> those two great Foun∣tains of Learning, both seated at almost an e∣qual Distance from London, the one West,
<PB N="357" REF="199"/>and the other North. From whence are year∣ly sent forth a great Number of Divines, Civilians, Physicians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to serve all Parts of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>For a constant Supply whereof there are several Colledges and famous Schools in Eng∣land; the principal <HI>Winchester, Eaton, West∣minster, St. Pauls, Merchant-Taylors,</HI> and <HI>Charter-House,</HI> all richly Indowed, to maintain Ma∣sters, Ushers, and a certain Number of Scho∣lars. So that a Child, once admitted into any of these Schools, may by his Capacity be preferred to be a Scholar, or Fellow in some Colledge of one of these Universities. Where having a good Allowance, he will want little or no help from his Parents all his Life∣time after.</P>

<HEAD>THE NEW STATE OF ENGLAND. PART II.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the</HI> Inhabitants <HI>of</HI> ENGLAND. <HI>And first of their</HI> Complexion, Temper, Genius, Language; <HI>with an Account of the most</HI> fa∣mous Men <HI>of this Nation, either for Souldiery or Learning.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT the <HI>Britains</HI> were the ancient Inhabitants of <HI>England,</HI> is a Thing agreed by all. But, whether they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere the <HI>Aborigines,</HI> that is, the very first In∣abitants of all, it may be made a Question,
<PB N="2" REF="202"/>and such as can scarce be solved. Therefore that wise Roman Historian, <HI>Tacitus,</HI> puts it off with an Ignoramus; <HI>Qui Mortales</HI> (says he) <HI>Initio coluerint, parum compertum est.</HI> As to the Original of the <HI>Britains</HI> themselves, <HI>Caesar</HI> proves them to be derived from the <HI>Gauls,</HI> by their Agreeableness in their Making, Speech, Man∣ners, Laws, and Customs. A rude and illite∣rate Nation, whose Learning (such as it was) was all lockt up in the breasts of the <HI>Druids,</HI> their Priests; who communicated what they knew to none but those of their own Order, and by that means kept the People (much like the Papists of our Days) in continual Ignorance of their sacred Mysteries.</P>
<P>The Romans began the Conquest of this Peo∣ple under the Emperor <HI>Claudius,</HI> about the middle of the first Century, and compleated it in the time of <HI>Domitian,</HI> as far at least as the <HI>Frythes</HI> of <HI>Edenburgh</HI> and <HI>Dunbarton</HI> in Scotland; unwilling to venture further, where there was nothing to be got but blows, cold, and hunger. For, as to <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> he rather discovered than con∣quered England; and his three next Successors, <HI>Augustus, Tiberius,</HI> and <HI>Caligula,</HI> made no Attempt upon it. So that we cannot properly reckon the Conquest of England, but from the Empire o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Claudius,</HI> Uncle to <HI>Caligula.</HI> Thus the <HI>Britains</HI> continued subject to the <HI>Romans</HI> about 400 Years after Christ, till the Reign of <HI>Honorius:</HI> When Italy being invaded by the Goths, the Romans abandoned Britain, to defend their own Country.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Romans</HI> were departed, under whose Protection and easy Government the <HI>Britains</HI> lived comfortably, they soon became a Prey to the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Saxons;</HI> but chiefly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Saxons</HI> who never left off teazing of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="3" REF="202"/><HI>Britains,</HI> till these quitted the Stage, and re∣tired beyond the Severn into Wales. Thus <HI>England</HI> came to be wholly possessed by a new Nation, that is, an aggregate Body of many People amongst the Germans, who came hither to try their fortune.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Saxons</HI> came the <HI>Danes,</HI> the next considerable, and the most cruel Actors on the Stage of England. Who, in the time of <HI>Egbert</HI> the Saxon Monarch, (that is, in the Ninth Century) first invaded this Country; and so exercised the patience of his Posterity, till at last they overpowred them, and got the King∣dom to themselves. But then the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> lived together, mixed in Marriages and Alliance, and so made one Nation consisting of <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>At last, in the eleventh Century, the <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> (a Northern People of France) came in with their Duke <HI>William.</HI> Who in one Battel got his pretended Right to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and from a single Victory the Title of <HI>Conquerour.</HI> Now the <HI>Normans</HI> mixing (as they did) with the Body of this Nation, we may say, that the <HI>English</HI> Bloud at this day is a Mixture chiefly of <HI>Saxon, Dane,</HI> and <HI>Norman,</HI> not without a Tincture of <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Romish</HI> Blood.</P>
<P>And, as the Country is temperate and moist, so the English have naturally the advantage of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> clear Complexion; not Sindged as in hot Climates, nor Weather-beaten as in cold Regi∣ons. The generality, of a comely Stature, graceful Countenance, well-featured, gray∣yed, and brown-haired. But for Talness and Strength the Western People exceed all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="203"/>
<P>The Women generally more handsom than in other Places, and without Sophistications sufficiently indowed with natural beauties. In an absolute Woman, say the Italians, are re∣quired the Parts of a Dutch-Woman from the Waste downwards; of a French-Woman, from the Waste up to the Shoulders; and over them an English Pace. Therefore an English-Woman makes one of the six Things wherein England excels, comprehended in this Latine Verse,
<Q>Anglia, Mons, Pons, Fons, Ecclesia, Foemina, Lana.</Q></P>
<P>That is to say, For Mountains, Bridges, Rivers, Churches fair, Women, and Wool, <HI>England</HI> is past Compare.</P>
<P>In short, there is no Country in Europe where Youth is generally so charming, Men so proper and well proportioned, and Women so beauti∣ful.</P>
<P>The Truth is, this Happiness is not only to be attributed to the Clemency of the Air. Their easy Life unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e best of Governments, which saves them from the Drudgery and Hard∣ship of other Nations, has a great hand in it. And the Experience of a Neighbouring People shew's us sufficiently, there's nothing more de∣structive of good Complexion than that Mon∣ster of Slavery. A fit Subject therefore for that Sex, which is so tender of Beauty, to chew upon.</P>
<P>The English <HI>Temper</HI> is naturally sutable to their Climate. They are neither so fiery a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the French, nor so cold as the Northern People; better tempered for Counsel than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first, for Execution than the last. A happy tem∣per
<PB N="5" REF="203"/>besides for all sorts of Learning. The gene∣rality of them reserved and wary, not apt to communicate but with their best and serious Acquaintances. And as their Friendship is not easily gained, so when once got 'tis not easily lost.</P>
<P>The Mischief is, that by their different In∣terests both in Civil Matters and Points of Re∣ligion, they are apt to be divided into Facti∣ons, which takes off very much from their Happiness. After so great a Deliverance as they were lately blessed with, who would have thought that there should be now a Party, (tho incon∣siderable) which repineth at it? And that a Protestant Party; who, like the Israelites, have a lingering Mind after the Onions of Egypt. Brought as they are out of Captivity by the wounderful hand of Providence into a happy state of Liberty, they grumble, and weary of their happiness seem willing to exchange their Moses for a Pharaoh. Were none but they concerned in the Change, 'tis pity but they should have it, and be crushed into Common Sense. They put me in mind of those silly Women in Mo∣scovy, (which according to Olearius) fancy their Husbands love them best that whip 'em most.</P>
<P>For Courage, I cannot but say this for the English, That Death, the King of Terrours, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o where so affronted as it is amongst them. Whether I look upon those that die privately in their Beds, or publickly upon a Scaffold or Gibet, I see so much Unconcernedness, that 'tis a wonder how a Nation that lives in so much case should value their Lives so little. In point of Fighting, 'tis true they are not altogether so hasty as the French to fight out a single Quar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el. But 'tis not so much for want of Courage,
<PB N="6" REF="204"/>as out of respect to the Laws, which are severe upon those that break the Peace.</P>
<P>For, upon a publick Account, when Men fight with Authority, no Nation shew's more forwardness. As they are a free People, their Spirits are accordingly averse from Slavery, and as greedy of Glory. Their Fore fathers Exploits, which by oral Tradition, and read∣ing of Histories, they are generally pretty well acquainted with, adds much to their Courage, But especially the Notion of their Conquest of France is so universally spread all over the Nation, and their Antipathy against the French so great and universal, that one may reasonably expect a good Success from their first Attempt upon France, when Opportunity shall serve. For desperate Attempts no Nation like the English, either by Sea or Land. If they be bent upon Fighting, they go to it undaunted, without telling the Number, or valuing the Strength of their Enemies. With this bold and undaunted Courage, not common with other Nations, they have sometimes outdone the very Romans themselves; and for this I appeal particularly to the History of France, where with a hand-full of Men they have rout∣ed and defeated the bravest Armies. 'Tis true they were at last expelled from thence, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Expulsion was not so much the Fruit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the French Valour, as the Effect of our Divi∣sions. So redoubted they were afterwards i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> France, that in the Wars between Charles VIII and the Duke of Bretagne, the Duke, to strik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Terrour amongst the French, apparelled 150<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his own Subjects in the Arms and Cross <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> England. But it proved as the Ass, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had on the Lions Skin.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="204"/>
<P>For a further Proof of the English Valour, I might recount their Victories of old over the Irish, Scots, Cypriots, and Turks. And Spain it self has sufficiently experienced both by Sea and Land the English Valour, to its cost; but by Sea especially. Wit∣ness the Battel <HI>Anno</HI> 1588. where Q. Eliza∣beth, with a few Ships, vanquished the Spa∣nish Fleet, which for the greatness of it was called <HI>Invincible.</HI> Sir Francis Drake, the Year before that, had with four Ships only took from the Spaniard one Million and 189200 Ducats in one Voyage. And afterwards with 25 Ships he awed the Ocean, sacked S. Jago, S. Dominico, and Carthagena; carrying away with him, besides Treasure, 240 Pieces of Ord∣nance. Sr. Richard Greenvile, Captain of one of the Queens Ships called the Revenge, with 180 Souldiers (whereof 90 were disabled with Sickness) maintained a Sea-fight for 24 hours a∣gainst an incredible Number of the Spanish Gal∣leons, sunk four of the greatest, and killed se∣veral thousands of their Men. Till at last, her Powder being spent to the last Barrel, she yielded upon honourable Terms, yet was never brought into Spain. To this I shall add the famous Adventure of John Oxenham an Eng∣lishman, one of the Followers of Sr. Francis Drake, in the West Indies. Where being land∣ed in a small Barque, with 70 of his Compa∣nions, a little above <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> in the Isthmus of Panama, he drew his Barque on Land, covered it with Boughs, and marched over the Land with his Company, guided by Negroes, till he came to a River. There he cut down Wood, to make him a Pinnace; where∣with he entred the South Sea, and went to the Isle of Pearls. About which Island in few days
<PB N="8" REF="205"/>he surprized two Spanish Ships, with an incre∣dible Treasure of Gold and Silver, and so re∣turned in safety to the Land. An Adventure not to be forgotten, and recorded by Spanish Writers with much admiration; so bold was the Attempt, so strange the Success, and so prodigious the Booty.</P>
<P>These Things I thought fit to record, now this is a Time for Action. We have a great Enemy to incounter with, the Irish, but only great by their Numbers. 'Tis but fighting with Cyphers. But with the French there is both Laurels and Booty to be got. And, if the Eng∣lish Souldiery will but seriously reflect how much this Nation has been in the late Reigns abused and undermined by Them, whose Ma∣sters they were formerly, I doubt not but with Gods Blessing and their natural Courage, under the Conduct of a magnanimous King and of a great General, they will right themselves, and be a glorious Instrument for the setling the Peace of Europe upon a sure and lasting Foun∣dation.</P>
<P>The Character of Pride which <HI>Scaliger</HI> gives the English Nation,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Scaliger <HI>de Re Poe∣tica, Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 16.</NOTE> when he calls them <HI>In∣flatos &amp; Contemptores,</HI> is a Character common to most Nations, but to none so well adapted as to his own. For the French, like the Ro∣mans of old, look upon most other Nations as barbarous, and count themselves the most ac∣complished. I confess they have great many good Qualifications, but this presumptuous Con∣ceit spoils all. And, all Things being consi∣dered, if the English have a little Pride, it is perhaps the best grounded of any Nation.</P>
<P>Cruelty and Barbarity, which the same Au∣thor charges 'em with, when he calls them <HI>Inhospitales, Immanes,</HI> is a meer Phantasm of his
<PB N="9" REF="205"/>own. 'Tis true, the English are not so fawn∣ing as the French upon Strangers, because they can make better shift without them; but I hope they don't want common Civility. They have indeed some thing of a natural Antipathy against the French, as there is to this day be∣twixt the French and the Spaniards. Yet, when the French Protestants fled to them for Refuge in the late Persecution, the strength of their Charity overcame their Nature. They laid a∣side their inbred Prejudices, and forthwith made it their business to relieve them as Bre∣thren, who suffered for their Religion. How mo∣derate they have been towards the plotting Papists, I leave the World to judge. Had the Huguenots of France plotted against the Go∣vernment there, as the Papists have done here ever since the Reformation, what do you think could have expiated their Crime? Nothing but a quick and general Massacre, such as they suffered under Charles IX, without the least Provocation. The late Experience tells us, what Spirit of Cruelty has possessed the French; when, upon the Kings Protestant Subjects ut∣most Submission to him in Civil Matters, and his most solemn and sacred Ingagements to pre∣serve their Liberties, this very Prince (whom they had lifted upon the Throne, with the ex∣pence of their Bloud) contrary to Equity and the Laws of the Land, to his Oaths and Promises, and to the Rules of Gratitude and Humanity, let them loose to the Cruelty of his Apostolick Dragoons; by whom they were crushed, persecu∣ted, and used beyond the Barbarity of the very Heathens themselves. But in England, as obnoxi∣ous as the Catholicks are to the Government, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d liable to the lash of the Law, still they are tole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ted, and connived at, almost beyond measure. Were
<PB N="10" REF="206"/><HI>Scaliger</HI> alive, what could he say to all this? How could he answer the late cruel Burnings and Devastations the French made in Germany, con∣trary to the Rules of War, and the very Pra∣ctice of the most barbarous Nations? And what could he say to their genteel Way of Poyson∣ing, wherein they have been of late so dexte∣rous, and the English so dull?</P>
<P>But, to clear further the English from that foul Imputation of Cruelty and Barbarity, if we look upon their Plantations abroad, who more courteous and gentle than this Nation? If we inspect their Proceedings against Male∣factors, no Nation in the World shews so much humanity, or proceeds with more equity. The barbarous Use of Racks, apt to extort Confes∣sion right or wrong, is absolutely laid aside amongst us. Nothing but the Prisoners un∣forced Confession, or the Deposition of Wit∣nesses upon Oath made out with good Circum∣stances, will take a Mans Life away. The Break∣ing on the Wheel, and other like torturing Deaths, are lookt upon here as too cruel for Christians to use. Neither are the Criminals, who with their Lives have expiated their Crimes before the World, denied Christian Burial, ex∣cept in particular Cases.</P>
<P>All this shews a great deal of Moderati∣on, and averseness from Cruelty. And, if we look upon the English in their private Fami∣lies, there we shall find a greater Harmony than perhaps in any Nation. For here generally Husbands are the most Kind to their Wives, Wives as tender of their Husbands, and Pa∣rents indulgent to Children. The first is so great a Truth, that England is every where acknowledged to be the Paradise of Women, as it is the Hell of Horses. And it is a com∣mon
<PB N="11" REF="206"/>By-Word among the Italians, that, if there were a Bridge over the Narrow Seas, all the Women of Europe would run into England. For here they are neither so servilely submissive as the French, nor so jealously garded as the Italian. Here they have the upper hand in the Streets, the upper place at Table, the Thirds of their Husbands Estates, and in many Cases share in all Lands.</P>
<P>I wish I could clear the English aswell from Wantonness and Debauchery, as I have from Cruelty. But, if they have too much degene∣rated in this point from their Ancestors, the Reason of it is at hand,
<Q>Regis ad Exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</Q></P>
<P>And, if that Rule be constantly true, we have now the fairest Prospect of a Reformation that ever Nation had, and the greatest Reason to hope shortly to see the English, now under a sober and religious (as well as a warlike) Prince, recover their Reputation, which has been so long obscured by the Licentiousness of two effeminate Reigns.</P>
<P>From their Temper I proceed to their <HI>Genius,</HI> wherein our Characterizer is no less abusive. And one would think his too much Learning made him mad, when he calls the English no less than <HI>stolidos, amentes, inertes,</HI> that is, wit∣less, and dull. The Truth is, other Nations are as deeply ingaged as the English against him in this Quarrel, of whom he gives like∣wise an unmanly Character. But, to confute him in this Point, this I dare aver, that no Nation has been more industrious than the Eng∣lish in Mechanick Arts, and the World to this day is obliged to them for many of their use∣full
<PB N="12" REF="207"/>Inventions and Discoveries. For Merchan∣dizing and Navigation, no People can com∣pare with them but the Hollanders, and their great Wealth arising from thence is a plain Proof and Demonstration of it. For Litera∣ture, especially since the Reformation, there is no Nation in the World so generally knowing. And, as Experimental Philosophy, so Divinity both Scholastick and Practical has been Im∣proved here beyond all other Places. Which makes Forein Divines, and the best sort of them, so conversant with the learned Works of those famous Lights of the Church, our best English Divines.</P>
<P>In short, the English <HI>Genius</HI> is for close Speaking and Writing, and always to the Point. They look upon loose and rambling Discourses with contempt and indignation, tho' they be seasoned with never so much wit. The gawdy part and pomp of Rhetorick, so much affected by the French, is slighted by the English; who, like Men of Reason, stick chiefly to Logick. And what they speak in publick they deliver it with a Gravity sutable to the Subject, slighting those mimical Gesticulations so much used be∣yond Sea, and indeavouring not so much to move the Hearer's Affections as to convince his Reason. <HI>Gutta cavat Lapidem.</HI></P>
<P>No Nation perhaps is more <HI>Satyrical,</HI> and quicker in <HI>Repartees,</HI> but still with much gravi∣ty; and I have often wondered at the Acute∣ness of some of the common Sort, which ar∣gues more Wit than our Censurer allow's.</P>
<P>To express themselves significantly, and with the greatest advantages, they have a most happy <HI>Language,</HI> tho' (like their Bloud) it be but a Mixture. For it is a Compound
<PB N="13" REF="207"/>chiefly of these three, <HI>Saxon, Latine,</HI> and <HI>French;</HI> but so that the <HI>Saxon</HI> is the Stock, in which the other two are Ingrafted.</P>
<P>As for the Excellency of it, I have little to add to what has been lately published by Mr. <HI>Miege</HI> in his Prefatory Discourse to his <HI>English Grammar.</HI> The Excellency (says he) of the Eng∣lish Tongue consists in these four Things, viz. its <HI>Facility, Copiousness, Significancy,</HI> and <HI>Sweetness.</HI></P>
<P>Its <HI>Facility</HI> is easily demonstrable in its Ex∣emption from Flexions, from that Multiplicity of Cases, and other Variations, which an Au∣thor calls the Emblems of Babel's Curse and Confusion. The Invariableness of its Nouns Adjective makes their Concordance easy with the Substantives. The Pronouns, so puzzling and intricate in French, admit of little diffi∣culty in English; and what is more easy than the Conjugation of English Verbs? Instead of one Particle <HI>(To)</HI> used before the Infinitive, the French have no less than three Prepositi∣ons, <HI>de, a</HI> and <HI>pour,</HI> differently used in that Mood. Nor is the English troubled with Verbs Reciprocal, one of the hardest Ingredients of that Language; especially when used with an Interrogation, and these intricate Particles <HI>en, y, ne,</HI> and <HI>pas,</HI> the right placing of which is so puzzling to Strangers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Copiousness</HI> I need not use much art to demonstrate. For, besides the Treasures of the old Saxon which the English retains in its Monosyllables, the choicer Wits of the Nation have fetcht hither the very Quintessence of some forein Languages; who, like Bees, have gathered the best, and left the worst. By which means they have so happily improved their Mother-Tongue, that those amongst Fo∣reiners who understand the Genius of it are
<PB N="14" REF="208"/>in a maze to see this Language so far outdo their own, and to find many of their trans∣planted Words thrive better in England than in their proper and natural Soil. And, where∣as the French is stinted, and grown barren through its exceeding Nicety, the English on the contrary is grown mighty Copious, by its innate Liberty of making such Compounds and Derivatives as are proper and sutable to abridge the Expression, and to say <HI>Multum in parvo.</HI> Insomuch that it do's almost equalize the Greek, and even exceed the Latine, in a peculiar grace of compounding Words toge∣ther, which is one of the greatest Beauties that can be in a Language. Nor do's its Abundance ly here altogether; there being Court and Country English, and peculiar Dia∣lects (besides the general one) in the West and North Countries. In short, no Vulgar Lan∣guage can deliver a Matter with more Variety, either plainly by Synonima's, or by Circumlo∣cution with Metaphors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Significancy</HI> of the English is made out to my hand by the <HI>Vindex Anglicus,</HI> in Words to this effect. There is scarce, says he, any Variety that any other Nation can brag of, but the English has almost with equal felicity made its own. Witness the <HI>Italian Courtier,</HI> the <HI>French Salust,</HI> the <HI>Spanish Guzman,</HI> the <HI>Latine Naso,</HI> and the <HI>Greek Polybius.</HI> Whoever reads that matchless Essay of Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> upon the <HI>Aeneids,</HI> would think it writ so by the peerless <HI>Maro</HI> himself. How properly has the renown∣ed Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> taught us to speak the Terms of Art in our own Language? A Thing Judged impossible, till we saw it performed. What matchless and incomparable Pieces have we seen in our Time, and where shall one see
<PB N="15" REF="208"/>more sense in so few Words? What Poetry has more Majesty, and bears a greater sense than the English, when it flows from a true Poet?</P>
<P>In point of <HI>Sweetness,</HI> whereas the <HI>Italian</HI> swarms with Vowels, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> with Con∣sonants, the <HI>English</HI> has the Advantage of them both in a happy Mixture. 'Tis true, the <HI>Italian</HI> is an excellent, Princely, and pleasant Language; but it wants Sinews, and passes as silent Water. The <HI>French</HI> is truly delicate, but something too nice and affected; the <HI>Spanish</HI> Majestical, but terrible and boisterous; the <HI>Dutch</HI> manly, but harsh. Now the <HI>English</HI> is both sweet, and man∣ly. 'Tis true, there are in it some particular sounds unknown to the French Tongue; which are indeed something harsh and uncouth in the mouth of a French Learner, and yet very smooth when they run in their proper and na∣tural Channel. Viz. <HI>i</HI> long, as in <HI>Vice; ou</HI> and <HI>ow,</HI> in <HI>Cloud, Vow,</HI> &amp;c; <HI>o</HI> and <HI>i,</HI> as in <HI>God, Lord, bird,</HI> and <HI>shirt,</HI> pronounced with a mixt sound of the French <HI>o</HI> and <HI>a.</HI> But those which puzzle most of all the French Learner are the found of <HI>g</HI> before <HI>e</HI> and <HI>i,</HI> and (which is the same Thing,) of <HI>j</HI> Consonant before any Vowel, as in <HI>ginger, jack, jest, jil, jog,</HI> and <HI>jug;</HI> of <HI>ch,</HI> as in <HI>Chamber;</HI> but chiefly of <HI>th,</HI> called a <HI>t</HI> aspi∣rate, as in <HI>thanks, thief, thorough, thunder,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In short, such is the mixture of the <HI>English,</HI> that one may frame his Speech majestical, plea∣sant, delicate, or manly, according to the Sub∣ject. Of all which Advantages inherent to the English Tongue Foreiners are at last become very sensible. For, whereas they used to slight it as an Insular Speech, not worth their taking notice, they are at present great Admirers of it.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="209"/>
<P>What remains is to answer the usual <HI>Ob∣jections</HI> against it, whereby some People pretend to degrade it from the Worth of a Language, viz. its <HI>Mixture,</HI> and <HI>Mutability. Mixture,</HI> a Thing so very natural to Languages, that none but the <HI>Hebrew</HI> (if that) is free from it. The <HI>Latine</HI> it self had a great Mixture of Greek and Gothish.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the English</HI> Names, <HI>and of their Way of</HI> Computing.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHristian Names, says <HI>Cambden,</HI> were first imposed for the Distinction of Persons; Surnames, for the Distinction of Fa∣milies.</P>
<P>The first, amongst the English, are either Saxon; as <HI>Edward, Gilbert, Henry, Richard, Walter, William,</HI> &amp;c. Or taken out of the Holy Writ; as <HI>Abraham, Jacob, James, Jsaac,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>'Tis rare for the English to have two Christen Names together, as they have in Ger∣many. But it is not unusual with them to christen Children by their Godfathers Sur∣names, which is unpractised beyond Sea.</P>
<P>The Ancients took particular care to give their Children significative and good Names, according to the Proverb, <HI>Bonum Nomen, Bonum Omen.</HI> And the Pythagoreans affirmed the Minds, Actions, and Successes of Men to be ac∣cording to their Fate, Genius, and Name. In short, such was Mens Superstition of old in this particular, that they used a kind of Divination by Names, called <HI>Onomantia,</HI> which was con∣demned by the last General Council.</P>
<P>The Story of Augustus the Emperour is re∣markable upon this Subject. The Day before his Sea-fight at <HI>Actium,</HI> the first Man he met was a poor Man, driving his Ass before him. Augustus demanded his Name; and he answer∣ed
<PB N="22" REF="212"/><HI>Eutyches,</HI> that is, Happy-man; then he asked his Asse's Name, which proved to be <HI>Nicon,</HI> that is, Victor. Augustus took it for a good O∣men; and having accordingly obtained the Victory, there he built <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> or the City of Victory, and erected brazen Images of the Man and his Ass.</P>
<P>Alfonso IV. King of Castille had two Daugh∣ters, by one of the Daughters of Henry II. King of England. The Eldest, <HI>Ʋrraca</HI> by Name, was far surpassing her Sister <HI>Blanche</HI> in beauty. Lewis VIII. of France sent to Alfonso, to de∣mand one of the Daughters. They were both presented to the Ambassadors Choice; who, inquiring of their Names, preferred the Lady <HI>Blanche,</HI> and made choice of her, contrary to all expectation. The Name of <HI>Ʋrraca,</HI> though the more beautiful Lady, proved unpleasing; and that of the Lady <HI>Blanche,</HI> signifying Fair and Beautiful, carried it, as a Name that would be more acceptable in France.</P>
<P>For my part, though I am not so much a Pythagorean as to think a Mans Name should in∣terpret his Fate; yet I think it not amiss to name Children with Names of a happy signifi∣cation, as it was usual among the Primitive Christians, were it but to stir them up to live according to their Names, and not give them∣selves the lie.</P>
<P>As for the English <HI>Surnames,</HI> they are gene∣rally <HI>Saxon,</HI> some few Danish, as <HI>Whitfeld,</HI> and <HI>Wren.</HI> The <HI>Whitfelds,</HI> a very ancient Family, came over with King <HI>Canute</HI> into England; and their chief Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch is continued to this day in Northumberland, with a good Estate. In Q. Elizabeths Time, there was a <HI>Whitfeld</HI> sent hither Embassadour from the King of Den∣mark.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="212"/>
<P>But the Surnames now of best account in England are Local, and so were many Names a∣mong the Romans. Those you will find deduced from Places in Normandy, or Countries adja∣cent; being either the Patrimonial Possessions, or native Places of such as served the Conque∣ror, or came in after out of Normandy. As <HI>Mortimer, Albigny, Percy, Gournay, Devereux, Ne∣vil, Ferrers, Montfort, Courtney, Cressy,</HI> &amp;c. Or from Places in England, and Scotland; as <HI>Barkley, Clifford, Lumley, Ratcliff, Willoughby, Douglas.</HI></P>
<P>Some of which Local Names were formerly used with <HI>de,</HI> prefixt; but of late generally neglected, or joyned to the Name, as <HI>Darcy, Devereux.</HI> Others had <HI>at</HI> prefixed, as <HI>At More, At Wood, At Down,</HI> which has been removed from some, and has been conjoyned to others, as in these, <HI>Atmore, Atwood, Atwells,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Many have also had their Names from Rivers, as <HI>Trent, Eden, Swale, Stoure.</HI> From Trees near their Habitations, as <HI>Oak, Box, Elder, Beech.</HI> Some from their Situation in respect to adjoyn∣ing Places; as <HI>North, South, East, West,</HI> according to the Greek Names <HI>Anatolius, Zephyrius,</HI> &amp;c. Others from several Parts of a House; as <HI>Hall, Parlour, Cellar, Lodge,</HI> &amp;c. From Towns where they were born, or from whence they came, without being Lords or Possessors of them; as <HI>Compton, Egerton.</HI> Or from several Denominations of Land and Water, as <HI>Hill, Wood, Warren, Field, Ford, Pool,</HI> and <HI>Wells.</HI></P>
<P>Among Foreiners, several retained the Names of their Countries; as <HI>Scot, Picard, Fleming, French, Lombard, Poitevin, German.</HI> And these had commonly <HI>Le</HI> prefixt in Records, and other Writings, as <HI>Le Fleming, Le Picard.</HI></P>
<PB N="24" REF="213"/>
<P>Next to these Local Names, I shall take no∣tice of those that have been assumed by some Families from Civil Honours, and Dignities; as <HI>King, Duke, Prince, Lord, Baron, Knight,</HI> and <HI>Squire,</HI> probably because their Ancestors ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣acted such Parts, or were Kings of the Bean, Christmas Lords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Agreeable to which are the old Greek and Roman Names, <HI>Archelaus, Augustulus, Regulus, Basilius, Caesarius, Flaminius,</HI> though they were neither Kings, Caesars, Dukes, or Priests.</P>
<P>Others have been assumed from Offices; as <HI>Chamberlain, Steward, Page, Cook, Spencer, Gardener, Butler, Porter, Foster, Parker, Faulco∣ner, Fowler, Forester, Woodward, Clark, Ser∣geant,</HI> &amp;c. From Ecclesiastical Functions; as <HI>Bishop, Abbot, Priest, Monk, Dean, Deacon.</HI> But most of all from Trades; as <HI>Taylor, Smith, Pot∣ter, Fisher, Baker, Chapman, Spelman,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Some from Parts of the Body; as <HI>Head, Arm, Leg, Foot.</HI> Others from Qualities of the Body, good or bad; as <HI>Greathead, Whitehead, Strong, Armstrong, Long, Low, Short, Fair,</HI> and <HI>Bell</HI> in the same sense, <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and <HI>Whitelock,</HI> in the same sense, <HI>Thin, Heile</HI> or healthful, &amp;c. No more to be disliked than these Roman Names, <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Nero,</HI> which signify Strong, <HI>Capito, Ped<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Labeo, Naso, Longus, Longinus, Minutius, Crispus, Calvus, Gracchus, Salustius, Cocles,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Not a few got their Names from the Colour of their Complexions, Hair, or Garments; As, <HI>White, Black, Brown, Red, Green,</HI> and these Nor∣man Names, <HI>Blanch</HI> or white, <HI>Blount</HI> for <HI>Blond</HI> Flaxen Hair, <HI>Rous</HI> for <HI>Roux</HI> red, and these de∣rived from the two last, viz. <HI>Blundell, Russel.</HI> Others have received their Names from their Age; as <HI>Young, Old, Child, Stripling.</HI> In Imita∣tion
<PB N="25" REF="213"/>of the Romans <HI>Juvenalis, Junius, Virginius, Senecio, Priscus.</HI> Others again from that which they commonly carried; as <HI>Palmer,</HI> and <HI>Wag∣staff.</HI></P>
<P>Some from the Qualities of the Mind; as <HI>Good, Goodman, Goodenough, Wise, Sharp, Speed.</HI> And such the Greeks and Romans of old had; witness <HI>Agathias, Andragathius, Eubulus, Eume∣nius, Sophocles, Thraseas, Prudentius, Lepidus, Va∣lens, Constans.</HI></P>
<P>Some took their Names from Beasts; as <HI>Lamb, Lion, Bear, Buck, Fox, Hind, Hound, Hare, Hog, Pig, Roe, Badger,</HI> &amp;c. And the like you will find among the noblest Romans; as <HI>Leo, Catulus, Lupus, Leporius, Aper, Apronius, Caninius, Castor. Cyrus</HI> (a Dog) was common amongst the Persians.</P>
<P>Others derive their Surnames from Birds; as <HI>Eagle, Kite, Swan, Wildgoose, Gosling, Par∣tridge, Parrat, Woodcock, Alcock, Wilcock, Hand∣cock, Peacock, Dove, Lark, Finch, Chaffinch, Nightingale, Wren, Hulet</HI> or <HI>Howlet, Corbet</HI> or <HI>Ra∣ven, Arundel</HI> or <HI>Swallow.</HI> As good as these Ro∣man Names, <HI>Corvinus, Aquilius, Milvius, Gallus, Picus, Falco, Livia,</HI> or Stock-Dove.</P>
<P>From Fishes; as <HI>Salmon, Trout, Plaice, Sole, Gurnard, Herring, Pike, Pickerell, Bream, Burt, Whiting, Crab, Mullet, Base,</HI> &amp;c. Nothing infe∣riour to these Roman Names, <HI>Muraena, Phocas, Aurata,</HI> &amp;c. which happily they took, or were given them, because they loved these Fishes best.</P>
<P>From Flowers, and Fruits, as <HI>Lilly, Rose, Peach, Filbert, Pescod.</HI> As fair Names as <HI>Len∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lus, Piso, Fabius,</HI> which sounded great amongst the Romans.</P>
<P>Many have got their Surnames by adding <HI>s</HI> to Christen Names, as <HI>Philips, Williams, Rogers,
<PB N="26" REF="214"/>Peters, Davis, Harris, Roberts, Simonds, Guyse, Stephens, Richards, Hughs, Jones,</HI> &amp;c. Others, by adding of <HI>s</HI> to these Nicknames or Nurse-Names; as <HI>Robins, Nicks, Nichols, Thoms, Dicks, Hicks, Wills, Sims, Sams, Collins, Jenks, Hodges, Hobs, Saunders, Gibs, Wats,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Many likewise have been made by adjoyning <HI>Kins</HI> to those Nurse-Names, making them as it were Diminutives: As <HI>Dickins</HI> from <HI>Dicks, Per∣kins</HI> from Peir for Peter, <HI>Tomkins</HI> from Tom, <HI>Wilkins</HI> from Will, <HI>Lambkins</HI> from Lambert, <HI>Hobkins</HI> and <HI>Hopkins</HI> from <HI>Hob, Atkins</HI> from Ar∣thur, <HI>Jenkins</HI> from John, <HI>Watkins</HI> from Wat, <HI>Tipkins</HI> from Tibald, <HI>Daukins</HI> from Davy. And so did the Romans vary their Names; as <HI>Con∣stans, Constantius, Constantinus, Justus, Justulus, Justinus, Justinianus, Aurelius, Aureolus, Aurelia∣nus, Augustus, Augustinus, Augustinianus, Augustu∣lus,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Or else, by adding <HI>ins</HI> to curtailed Names; as <HI>Hutchins, Huggins, Hitchins,</HI> and <HI>Higgins</HI> from Hugh, <HI>Gibbins</HI> from Gibby, <HI>Jennings</HI> from John, and <HI>Rawlins</HI> from Raoul, that is, Ralph.</P>
<P>To which add Diminutive Surnames, ending in <HI>et</HI> or <HI>ot;</HI> as <HI>Willet</HI> from Will, <HI>Bartlet</HI> from Bartholomew, <HI>Millet</HI> from Miles, <HI>Huet</HI> from Hugh, <HI>Eliot</HI> from Elias.</P>
<P>But you will find many more of these Dimi∣nutive Surnames, by the addition of <HI>Son,</HI> to the Father's Christian or Nickname. As <HI>William∣son, Richardson, Dickson, Harrison, Gibson, Simson, Stevenson, Robinson, Nicholson, Tomson, Wilson, Wat∣son, Wilkinson, Johnson, Jackson, Sanderson,</HI> and <HI>Pattison</HI> from Patrick.</P>
<P>To which answers the ancient Way of Nor∣man Families, when a Son took for his Sur∣name his Fathers Christen-Name, with the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Fitz</HI> prefixt, which signified Son. As <HI>Rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="27" REF="214"/>Fitz-William,</HI> that is, Robert the Son of Wil∣liam; <HI>Henry Fitz Gerard,</HI> that is, Henry the Son of Gerard.</P>
<P>What remains is to answer the Question, how people came by their Names. <HI>Cambden</HI> thinks (as it is probable enough) that some took up their Names themselves, and others had their Names given them by the People, in whom lies the Sovereignty of Words and Names. Amongst the first he reckons those that assumed local Names of such Places as they were Owners of. And, amongst the Au∣thors of the last, especially the Diminutives, he brings in the Nurses as the principal.</P>
<P>Neither is it improbable, say's he, but that many Names, that seem unfitting for Men, as those of brutish Beasts, &amp;c. came from the very Signs of the Houses where they inhabited. And he alledges for Instance some that, living at the Sign of the Dolphin, Bull, and White-Horse, were commonly called <HI>Thomas</HI> at the <HI>Dolphin, Will</HI> at the <HI>Bull, George</HI> at the <HI>White-Horse.</HI> Which Names (as many others of the like sort) with omitting <HI>At,</HI> became after∣wards hereditary to their Children.</P>
<P>Another Thing observable in Names is their frequent Change, a Thing practised of old by the Romans themselves. For some have chan∣ged their Names, to avoid the Opinion of Base∣ness; others, in remembrance of their more honourable Progenitors. Some upon the Ac∣count of Adoption, others in remembrance of some particular Favours. Some again, by ta∣king the Names of those whose Lands they had; and others, by taking the Name of their own Office. As when <HI>Edward Fitz-Theobald</HI> was made <HI>Butler</HI> of Ireland, the Earls of <HI>Or∣mond,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="215"/>and others descended from them, took the Name of <HI>Butler.</HI></P>
<P>The Pride of Scholars has also wrought Al∣terations in some Names. And the fear of Punishment has been all along the Occasion of several Mens changing their Names, to avoid being discovered. But Time especially has changed Names the most, by contracting, curtailing, and mollifying of them in such a manner, that they are quite another Thing from what they were at first.</P>
<P>Lastly, Foreiners may observe, that Women in England at their Marriage change their Surnames, and pass into their Husbands Names. Which is but reasonable, because married peo∣ple <HI>Non sunt duo, sed Caro una,</HI> they are but one Flesh. And yet in France, and elsewhere, married Women retain so far their own Names with their Husbands, as to write themselves by their Fathers Surnames.</P>
<P>I come now to the English Way of Com∣puting. Who do not begin the Year till the 25th of March, being the Day of Christ's Incar∣nation; wherein they agree with Spain. This is the Rule, both in Church and State; accord∣ing to which they date all their publick Writ∣ings. Though, according to the Cycles of the Sun and Moon, they allow the Year to begin only the first of January; which therefore is by them called, as by most other Christians in Europe, the New-Years Day. And, to di∣stinguish that mongrel Time from the first of January to the 25th of March following, 'tis usual with many, in the Dates of their Letters during that Interval, to set down both the Years thus, as from the 1st of January 1688. to the 25th of March 1689/90</P>
<PB N="29" REF="215"/>
<P>As for the Natural Day, consisting of 24 hours, the English begin (as most Parts of Europe do) at Midnight, counting 12 hours to Noon the next Day, and 12 hours more to next Midnight; according to the Custom of the Egyptians, and ancient Romans. Whereas in some other Countries, as Italy, Poland, and Bohemia, they reckon 24 hours together, from Sun-set to Sun-set, which must needs be very troublesom to tell after the Clock. In Moscovy, and some Places in Germany (as Nuremberg, and Wirtemberg) they begin the Day and end it with the Sun; so that the first Hour of the Day is with them at Sun rise, and the first hour of the Night at Sun-set, which is according to the old Babylonian Account.</P>
<P>The Old Style is used in England, as in most Protestant States; and the New Style, in all Popish States. According to this Style, these reckon ten Days before us regularly, as to the beginning of Months, and all fixt Festi∣vals; but for all moveable Feasts, the Account proves various.</P>
<P>The Old Style is otherwise called the <HI>Ju∣lian Account,</HI> from <HI>Julius Caesar;</HI> who, 43 Years before our Saviours Birth, ordained the Year to consist of 365 Days and 6 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ours. And, as these 6 hours, at 4 Years end, make up 24 hours, therefore a Day is then added to the Month of February; and that Year called Leap Year, or Bissextile Year, from the Latine <HI>Bissextilis.</HI></P>
<P>The New Style is otherwise termed the <HI>Gre∣gorian Account,</HI> from <HI>Pope Gregory XIII;</HI> who, above 100 Years ago, undertook to correct the Calendar, by the advice and direction of Anto∣nius Lilius, and other excellent Mathematicians. For, tho the Julian Account for many Ages seemed to have no sensible Errour; yet it was
<PB N="30" REF="216"/>at last discovered to be not altogether agree∣able with the natural Motion of the Sun. In short, it was made out, that the Julian Year exceeded the true Solar Year by 10 Minutes and 48 Seconds; whereby the Equinoxes and Sol∣stices yearly changed their places, and flew back so many minutes and seconds. Therefore Pope Gregory ordered the Year to consist of 365 Days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 12 seconds. And, that the Vernal Equinox (which then was on the 11th of March) might be reduced to the 21th, as it was at the time of the first Nicene Council, he commanded ten Days in October to be left out, by calling the fifth Day thereof the fifteenth.</P>
<P>To find Easter, the Church of <HI>England</HI> ob∣serves still the Cycle found out and finished in the sixth Century by that worthy Roman, <HI>Dionysius Exiguus,</HI> or <HI>Abas.</HI> Whereas the Ro∣man Church, having invented new Rules about Easter, it happens sometimes that their Easter is full five Weeks before ours, sometimes with, but never after ours.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the English Way of Living, as to Lodging, Fewel, Food, Rai∣ment, Exercise, Recreations, and some particular Customs.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHen I compare the Modern English Way of <HI>Building</HI> with the Old Way, I cannot but wonder at the Genius of old Times. Nothing is more delightful and convenient than Light, nothing more agreeable to health than a free Air. And yet of old they used to dwell in Houses, most with a blind Stair∣case, low Cielings, and dark Windows; the Rooms built at random, often with Steps from one to another. So that one would think the Men of former Ages were afraid of Light and good Air, or loved to play at Hide and Seek. Whereas the Genius of our time is altogether for lightsom Stair-Cases, fine Sash-Windows, and lofty Cielings. And such has been of late our Builders Industry, in point of Compactness and Uniformity, that a House after the new Way will afford upon the same Quantity of Ground as many more Conveniences.</P>
<P>The Contrivance of Closets in most Rooms, and the painted Wainscotting now so much u∣sed, are also two great Improvements; the one for Conveniency, the other for Cleanness and Health. And indeed, for so damp a Country as <HI>England</HI> is, nothing could be better contrived
<PB N="32" REF="217"/>than Wainscot, to keep off the ill Impression of damp Walls. In short, for handsom Accommo∣dations and Neatness of Lodgings, <HI>London</HI> un∣doubtedly has got the preeminence.</P>
<P>The greatest Objection against the London-Houses (being for the most part Brick) is their Slightness, occasioned by the Fines exacted by the Landlords. So that few Houses, at the com∣mon rate of Building, last longer than the Ground-Lease, that is about 50 or 60 Years. In the mean time, if there happens to be a long fit of excessive Heat in Summer or Cold in Winter, the Walls being but thin, become at last so penetrated with the Air, that the Te∣nant must needs be uneasy with it. But those Extreams happen but seldom. And this Way of Building is wonderful beneficial to all Trades relating to it; for they never want Work in so great a City, where Houses here and there are always repairing, or building up again.</P>
<P>The plaistered <HI>Cielings,</HI> so much used in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> beyond all other Countries, make by their Whiteness the Rooms so much lightsomer, and are excellent against a raging Fire. They stop the passage of Dust, and lessen the Noise over∣head. In Summer-time the Air of the Room is something the cooler for't, and the warmer in Winter.</P>
<P>The Use of <HI>Stoves,</HI> so common in Northern Countries, as Germany, Denmark, Sueden, Po∣land, and Moscovy, and even so far Southward as Swisserland, is in a manner unknown in this Country. And indeed its Temperateness does no way require it. Therefore the English use no outward Remedy against Cold Weather but a Chimney-Fire, which is both comfortable to the Body, and chearful to the Sight. 'Tis true,
<PB N="33" REF="217"/>there is a double Conveniency in Stoves. First in point of Savingness, for once heating of a Stove in the Morning, keeps the Room warm a whole Day. Secondly, in Point of Warmth, the Room being so warm with it, that all Pla∣ces in it feel the benefit thereof. But those two Conveniences are more than over-ballanced by one Inconveniency, <HI>viz.</HI> the aptness of Stoves to gather and foment all the noisom Smells of a Room for want of Vent, which must needs be very unwholsom; whereas a Chimney-fire draws 'em to it, and there they find vent with the Smoak. To that Inconveniency we may add the chilling Impressions of a cold and sharp Air, upon ones coming into it out of so warm a Room as commonly Stove-rooms are. Besides the Cumbersomness of Stoves in Summer-time, when being altogether useless, they take up a great deal of room to no purpose.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Fewel,</HI> England affords three Sorts, Wood, Coals, and Turves; but Coals is the most common, in London especially, where they have 'em by Sea from Newcastle and Sun∣derland. A lasting sort of Fewel, being a mix∣ture of small and round Coals together, which by their aptness to cake, is the most durable of any; and for Kitchin Use, far beyond Wood it self, as yielding not only a more even, but more piercing Heat. The Smoak of it is indeed grosser, and of a corrosive nature; but yet no∣thing so offensive to the Eye, whatever it is to the Lungs, as some pretend it to be. In many Parts of the Country they have Pit-coals, which is a cleaner and more chearful Fewel, but not so durable as Sea-coals. But the Cheapness of these at London in Time of Peace is worth ta∣king notice; where for so small a matter as two or three pence a Day one may keep a constant
<PB N="34" REF="218"/>moderate Fire from Morning till Bed-time. Which is a mighty Advantage to so vast and populous a Place, especially considering it comes 300 miles by Sea. And whatever the Parisians can say to the praise of their Wood∣fires, I dare say the common sort of People there would be glad, could they compass it, to change in Winter-time Fewel with the Lon∣doners.</P>
<P>The English <HI>Diet</HI> falls next under our Consi∣deration; which for the eating part, does most consist in Flesh, and chiefly in Butchers Meat. For, though they have great Plenty and Variety of Fish and Fowl, Roots and Herbs, yet they are most commonly used but as a Supplement or an Accessory to the Principal. And there∣fore the English ever went amongst Strangers for the greatest Flesh-eaters. Which is cer∣tainly the best, and the most proper nourish∣ment for this Country.</P>
<P>But, whereas formerly the English used to eat three or Four Meals a Day, the generality of them, since the long Civil Wars in the Reign of Char. I. have used themselves to eat but one Meal a Day. If then they eat plentifully, and perhaps beyond the rate of other People, who eat three or four times a Day, it is no matter of amaze∣ment. Some thing more than ordinary must be laid up in store, to hold out 24 Hours. There is the less Time lost in eating, and the more sa∣ved for Business. So that, if other Nations live to eat, the English may be said to eat only to live. In short, all things considered, we may reckon the English, (who heretofore were perhaps not unjustly taxed of Gluttony, and to be a People most given to their Bellies) to be now one of the most sober Nations of Europe, as to Eating.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="218"/>
<P>Not but that in their Feastings, both pub∣lick and private, they are as great as any Na∣tion. Witness (for publick ones) the Feasts at Coronations, at the Installation of the Knights of the Garter, Consecration of Bishops, Inter∣tainments of Embassadors, the Feasts of the Lord Mayor of London, of Sergeants at Law, and of Readers in the Inns of Court. And yet, as sumptuous and magnificent as they are in these Times, they are not to compare to the wonderful Feastings of elder Times. 'Tis re∣corded (says Dr. <HI>Chamberlain,</HI>) of Richard Earl of Cornwal, Brother to Henry III, that at his Marriage-Feast he had thirty thousand Dishes of Meat; and that King Richard II, spent dai∣ly at a Christmas 26 Oxen, and 300 Sheep, besides Fowl, and all other Provision propor∣tionably. Anciently, says <HI>Fortescue,</HI> at a Call of Sergeants at Law, each Sergeant spent 1600 Crowns in Feasting, which in those Days was more than 1600 Pounds now.</P>
<P>But the Civil Wars aforesaid are not the on∣ly Thing which has brought the English to this Moderation of eating but one Meal a Day. The frequent Use of Tobacco, Tea, and Coffee, has had also a great hand in it. And the Experi∣ence of making but slight Suppers, or rather of turning Suppers into Beverages, has proved so conducive to Health, that few People in England make a set Supper. Whereas, beyond Sea, 'tis counted the principal Meal.</P>
<P>The Plainness of the English Diet is also very observable in point of Health. Their usual Way is downright Boiled and Roasted, without any Sophistication; and 'tis certainly the most agree∣able to ones Health. The French Kickshaws are meer Kitchin Sophistry, invented more toplease a curious Palate, than to satisfy a natural Appetite.
<PB N="36" REF="219"/>Their Cooks meer Legerdemains. You take one thing for another, the proper Taste of the Meat is gone, and another by the virtue of <HI>Co∣quus Pocus</HI> is substituted: Thus the Palate is gra∣tified, and the Stomack cheated. 'Tis true, the dainty Frenchified Palates in England love this kind of Transmigration; but those who are for Variety, may find here pretty Knacks enough, without running to France for it. For Pastry no Nation excels the English, but in Venison-Pasties they excel all Nations.</P>
<P>But if we go from the Kitchin to the Butte∣ry, here indeed the English Butler does outdo the French Cook in point of Variety. Besides the Diversity of Wines from abroad, from the East and from the South, here we find Beer and Ale, small and strong of both sorts; and of the last twenty Species, all noted for some peculiar quality, most for their strength. Nothing plea∣santer than this to the Eye, or to the Palate, when skill and age has brought it to perfection; but nothing more treacherous. It goes down gently and palatably; but, as if it were too no∣ble a Liquor for those lower Parts, it presently flyes up to the Head, and puts all there in a con∣fusion. So quick is the Operation of those strong sorts of Liquors, upon too large a Dose, that they run a Man out of his Senses, before he can have an Interval of Mirth. I speak of Men that are not so well used to those sorts of Liquors as the North Country Men are, who know best how to deal with them.</P>
<P>But, besides the Variety of Wines from a∣broad, of Beer and Ale brewed at home, here is drunk abundance of Sider, Perry, Mead, Me∣theglin, Mum, and since the Plague, French Brandy, and Irish Usquebach: two dangerous sorts of Drink, when taken immoderately. To con∣clude,
<PB N="37" REF="219"/>I wish I could say the English are as so∣ber in point of Drinking, as they are in their Eating. But, since <HI>Scaliger's</HI> Time, they have in a great measure clubbed with the Germans, their old Kinred, in the Character he gives of these in one of his Epigrams.</P>
<Q><L>Tres sunt Convivae, <HI>Germanus, Flander,</HI> &amp; <HI>Anglus;</HI></L>
<L>Dic quis edat meliùs, quis meliùsve bibat.</L>
<L>Non comedis, <HI>Germane,</HI> bibis; tu non bibis <HI>Angle,</HI></L>
<L>Sed comedis; comedis <HI>Flandre,</HI> bibisque bene.</L></Q>
<P>In English thus.
<Q><L><HI>Dutch, Flemings, English,</HI> are your only Guests;</L>
<L>Say which of all do's eat, or drink it best.</L>
<L>Th' <HI>English</HI> love most to eat, the <HI>Dutch</HI> to swill,</L>
<L>Only the <HI>Fleming</HI> eats and drinks his fill.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus was it in <HI>Scaliger's</HI> time with the Eng∣lish Nation. But now the Case is altered, so far at least as concerns the <HI>English,</HI> who are at this time less Eaters, but more addicted to Drinking than formerly; and yet not to that excess neither generally, as the Germans are.</P>
<P>The Use of Coffee and Tea, two sober Li∣quours now so prevalent in England, do's take off people considerably from drinking of strong Liquours. And, were it but for that, the Coffee-houses ought to be kept up and in∣couraged.</P>
<P>Now Coffee is made with the berries of a Tree that grows in the Levant, and Tea with the leaves of an India Plant; both hot and dry, and therefore very proper for Phleg∣matick people. And, whereas strong Liquours
<PB N="38" REF="220"/>are apt to disorder the Brain, these on the contrary do settle and compose it. Which makes it so much used by Men of Learning and Business, who know best the virtue of 'em.</P>
<P>As for Tobacco, the Use whereof is indeed more universal, 'tis a Remedy for phlegmatick people, and consequently not amiss in this Country. Tis a Companion in Solitude, an Amusement in Company, an innocent Diver∣sion to Melancholy, and a Help to Fancy in private Studies and Meditations.</P>
<P>I come now to the English Wearing <HI>Apparel,</HI> wherein this Nation has shewed in former Ages much Pride and Levity. So foolish and ex∣travagant they were, so superfluous and obscene, that divers Statutes were made against that Ex∣cess, even before the Reformation. Then an English-man was wont to be pictured naked, with a pair of Sheers in his hand, a piece of Cloth under his Arm, and Verses annext, in∣timating that he knew not what fashion of Cloaths to have. In Q. Elizabeths Time, sometimes they took up the German, and sometimes the Spanish Mode. But the French Fashion has prevailed for the most part since. Only there was a Time in King Charles the se∣cond his Reign, that is, about 23 Years since, when Men took up a grave sort of Habit, some∣thing like that of the Oriental Nations. But it was soon laid aside, and the French Mode taken up again, which has continued ever since.</P>
<P>Cloth, amongst Men, is the general and al∣most the only Wear. And that with so much plainness and comeliness, with so much mo∣desty and so little prodigality, that the Eng∣lish,
<PB N="39" REF="220"/>formerly so apish in imitating forein Na∣tions in their Garb, might go now for a Model. The Women indeed, who value them∣selves most upon a fine outward Appearance, cannot keep within those Bounds. Whether it be to make a Figure in the World, or out of Emulation amongst themselves, or out of Design upon Men, they go still in rich Silks, with all the Set-offs that Art can possibly invent from time to time. They know that Love do's love Toys, and that Men love to be caught in a fine Net. And herein the Citizens Wives, and Maid-Servants, do run into such Excess as makes a Confusion. So hard it is sometimes to know a Tradesmans Wife from a Lady, or the Maid from the Mistris.</P>
<P>As for the English <HI>Exercises</HI> and <HI>Recreations,</HI> some they have common with other Nations, as Hunting, Hawking, Fowling, Fishing, Tennis, Bowling, Shooting at Bow and Arrows, Leap∣ing, Wrestling, Dancing, Musick, Stage-Plays, Operas, Mascarades, Balls, Ballets, &amp;c. A∣mongst which their Way of Bowling in fine Greens, contrived and kept for that purpose, is beyond any Thing that forein Countries do afford. Wrestling is an Exercise, wherein they have a peculiar Skill, but chiefly the North and Western People. Their Musick, like their Temper, inclines to gravity. And, if France outdo's the English in Comedies, England may be said to outdo all Europe in Trage∣dies.</P>
<P>But, besides those Exercises and Recrea∣tions usual with other Nations, they have some more peculiar to themselves; such as Paddock-Courses, Horse-races, Cock-fighting, Bear-baiting, Bull-baiting, Prizes, Cudgels,
<PB N="40" REF="221"/>Foot-ball, Throwing at Cocks, and their Way of Ringing of Bells. Amongst which the Races shew the Swiftness of English Horses brought up for that purpose, which to Fo∣reiners unacquainted with it go's almost for a Romance. Cock-fighting shews the Courage of their Cocks; Bear-baiting, and Bull-baiting that of their Dogs; and Prizes, the dexterity of some Men in handling of Weapons, tho' with some effusion of Bloud. Foot ball is a rude Diversion for the common sort of People in frosty Weather. Throwing at Cocks is not only rude, but cruel. And, as to the Mu∣sical Way of Ringing the Bells in England, the frequency of it makes it rather a Recrea∣tion to the Ringers than others.</P>
<P>The Publick Days for Feasting, amongst the English, are first the Holy Daies at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, but chiefly Christ∣mas Holy-Days: When 'tis usual for Landlords to treat their Tenants, for Relations and Friends to invite each other, and pass the Time in Merriments. And, though those Holy-Days are not kept of late Years with that Profuseness as formerly they were; yet I could wish they were kept with more devo∣tion, and less intemporateness.</P>
<P>From All-Saints Day to Candlemas, 'tis usual for each Inn of Court to have Revels on Holy-Days, that is, Musick and Dancing; and for this they chuse some young Student to be Master of the Revels. Before Christmas, the Students, who are for the most part Gentle∣men of quality that come hither only to learn so much Law as may serve their turn to pre∣serve their Estates, meet together in order to keep a solemn Christmas. At this Meeting, which they call a Parliament, Officers are
<PB N="41" REF="221"/>chosen from among them to bear Rule in the House during the whole Christmas; as a Com∣ptroller, Treasurer, &amp;c. Sometimes, when their publick Treasury can reach it, they make a Prince among themselves, who keeps a Court accordingly. By whom many of the chief Nobility and great Officers of State are feasted, and intertained with Interludes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But, whether a Prince or no, the whole Christmas-time (except Sundays) is devoted here to Feasting, Musick, Dancing, and Di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing. This last, being allowed to all Comers, is so excessive, that the Box-mony do's usually amount to about 50 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> each 24 hours. Which Mony go's a great way towards the defraying the Charges of the whole Christmas, the rest being made up by a Contribution from each Student.</P>
<P>But, besides Christmas Holy-Days (which may be called the Carnaval of England) there are other Days of publick Rejoycing. As, the King and Queens Birth and Coronation-Days; the present Kings Birth-Day being the 4th of November, the Queens the 30th of April, and their Coronation Day April the 11th.</P>
<P>The 5th of November, being Gun-powder Treason Day, when the Popish Conspirators had prepared all Things to blow up King James I. and his Parliament then sitting, is a Day of Thanksgiving, solemnly kept to the eternal Confusion of Popery. This is the Day, when the Pope, by way of Reta∣liation, used solemnly to be burnt in Effigie at Temple-Bar in King Charles the Seconds Time, with so much State and Pomp, that the Undertakers spared for nothing to have it
<PB N="42" REF="222"/>done sutable to the Subject. But, this being discontinued, since the late King came to the Crown, and being lookt upon besides by sober people as a Piece of Exorbitancy, I have done with it, and hope it won't be renew∣ed.</P>
<P>My Lord Mayors Day, being the 29th of October, is also a solemn Day of publick Re∣joycing and Feasting for the City of London. Societies have likewise their Feasting Days, when they meet in a Body, either upon the Election of a new Officer, or on some other account. But, of all the Societies, there is none to be compared in this point to the Inns of Court, for state and magnificence.</P>
<P>As to private Families, 'tis usual with many to celebrate their Birth and Marriage-Days with their most intimate Friends.</P>
<P>To improve Society, the life of Recreation, the English have, besides their usual and friend∣ly Meetings called <HI>Clubs,</HI> the Conveniency of <HI>Coffee-Houses,</HI> more common here than any where else. In these all Comers intermix together, with mutual freedom; and, at the small Charge of a peny or two pence of such Liquours as are sold there, Men have the Op∣portunity of meeting together, and getting Acquaintance, with choice of Conversation, and the advantage of reading all forein and do∣mestick News.</P>
<P><HI>S. Bartholomew</HI>'s (vulgarly called <HI>Bartelmy</HI>) Fair is a particular Time for Diversion to the City of London. It begins on S. Bartholo∣mew's Day the 24th of August, and conti∣nues 14 Days in West-Smithfield; at the end whereof it removes for so many Days more to Southwark, on the other side of the River. Then is the dead Time of the Year, which
<PB N="43" REF="222"/>amongst Citizens is the most proper for their Diversion. This Fair is famous, not so much for Things bought or sold, as for its great Variety of Shews, either of Nature or Art. So that one may apply to it what the Romans of old used to say of Africk, <HI>Quid novi fert Africa?</HI> For here is always to be seen strange sorts of living Creatures. And for such as love Feats of Activity, Comical, or Tragical Shews, here they are to be seen in the utmost per∣section. Which draws daily during the Fair a great Concourse of people, to the benefit of the Shewers and the satisfaction of the Be∣holders.</P>
<P>And now, amongst the English particular <HI>Customs,</HI> I shall in the first place take notice of their Way of Pledging one another, where∣of this is the Original. When the Danes Lorded it over England, they used, when the English drank, to stab them, or cut their Throats. To avoid which Villany, the Party then drinking requested some of the next to him to be his Surety or Pledge, for his Life. From whence came the Expression used to this day of Pledging one another, when the Party drunk to takes his turn, and drinks next after him.</P>
<P>Another Custom the English had formerly upon the Danes account; which Time has so corrupted, that there remains no sign of the first Institution, except in the Name <HI>Hock-tide,</HI> an old Saxon Word, which signify's the Time of Scorning, or Triumphing. The Eng∣lish, in the Reign of King Ethelred, were so oppressed and broken by the Danes, that E∣thelred was fain to buy his Peace of them at the yearly Tribute of 10000 pound, soon af∣ter
<PB N="44" REF="223"/>inhaunced to 48000, which Monies were raised upon the Subjects by the Name of <HI>Dane∣gelt.</HI> But the King, weary of this Exaction, plotted with his Subjects to kill all the Danes, as they slept in their Beds. Which was ac∣cordingly done on <HI>S. Brice</HI>'s Night, <HI>Nov.</HI> 12.1012. The joyfull English, having thus clear∣ed their Country of the Danes, instituted the annual Sports of <HI>Hock tide;</HI> in Imitation of the Romans <HI>Fugalia,</HI> at the expulsion of their Kings. This Solemnity consisted in the merry Meerings of the Neighbours in those Days during which the Festival lasted, and was ce∣lebrated by the younger sort of both Sexes, with all manner of Exercises and Pastimes in the Streets. At Coventry they yearly acted a Play called <HI>Hock-Tuesday,</HI> till Q. Elizabeths Time.</P>
<P>The 14th of February, being <HI>S. Valentines</HI> Day, has been kept Time out of mind, (and is so to this day) both by the English and Scots, with some relation to the Instinct of Animals. For Nature teaches us, that about this time of the Year the Beasts of the Field and Fowls of the Air feeling a new heat by the approach of the Sun, the Males chuse their Females, and begin to couple. From whence it is probable young Men and Maidens took occasion to meet together at this time to an equal Number; and, having their respective Names writ down severally upon pieces of paper rolled up, the Men draw the Maidens Names, and these the Mens. So the Lot gives every Man a She Valentine, and every Maid a He one; the Men wearing their Lots for some Days rolled up about their Hat-bands, and the Women before their Breast. Where∣upon they make each other a Present, and
<PB N="45" REF="223"/>sometimes it comes to be a Match in good earnest.</P>
<P>These Particulars, so well known to the whole Nation, I would not have insisted up∣on, but for the satisfaction of Foreiners. Up∣on whose Account I shall likewise explain, but in few Words, the Story of the Welsh Custom of wearing Leeks on their Hats the first day of March, being S. David's Day. Once upon a time (to use the old English Style) the Welsh Liberty lay grievously at stake; and they must either be victorious, or lose it. In that Extremity they called for help upon S. David, their Patron. Armed with Confidence in that Saint, they crossed Fields sowed with Leeks, before they came to ingage; and, for distinction sake, each Soul∣dier took up a Leek. The Welsh got the Vi∣ctory; and, to perpetuate the Memory thereof, as well as out of respect to the Saint, they made a Law amongst themselves, that on S. David's Day every Man should wear a Leek about his Head. Which is religiously by them observed every Year; the common people wearing but Garden Leeks, and the better sort wrought ones. The King himself, out of Complacency to that People, wears one upon that Day.</P>
<P>The Scots, on their fide, wear a blue Cross on the fore-part of their Hats upon S. An∣drew's Day, their Patron. And the Irish a red Cross on one side of their Hats, to the Me∣mory of their old Patron, S. Patrick.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>I. <HI>Of the English Way of Travelling by Land, either Horseback, or in Coaches.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>Of the general Post, for Intercourse of Letters.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Of the English Coins, Weights and Measures, in relation to Trade.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>Of the great Trade of Eng∣land, in foreign Parts.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEsides the Conveniency of <HI>Travelling</HI> by Water, either by Sea, or here and there upon Rivers, I may say the English Na∣tion is the best provided of any for Land-Tra∣vel, as to Horses and Coaches. And the Truth is, there is not perhaps a Country so proper for't, 'tis generally so open and level.</P>
<P>Travelling on Horseback is so common a Thing in England, that the meanest sort of People use it as well as the rest. Which some∣times fills the Roads with Riders, not without frequent Disputes about giving the way, which is unusual beyond Sea. And, as English Horses are the best for Expedition, so 'tis rare upon the Road to see an Englishman but upon the Gallop.</P>
<P>But for Persons that are tender, or disabled, England excels all other Nations in the Con∣veniency of Coaches, but especially in that of
<PB N="47" REF="224"/>Stage-Coaches; a very commodious and easy Way of Travelling. Here one may be trans∣ported without over-violent Motion, and shel∣tered from the Injuries of the Air, to most no∣ted Places in England. With so much speed, that some of these Coaches will reach above 50 Miles in a Summer Day; and at so easy Rates, that it is in some Places less than a Shil∣ling for every Five Miles.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Post,</HI> for Intercourse of Letters, there is a general Office in the City of London, from whence Letters and Pacquets are dispatch∣ed to all Parts, and the Returns according to their respective Directions.</P>
<P>This Office, now in Lombard-street London, is managed in chief by the Post-master General, who is constituted thereto by the King's Let∣ters Patents under the Great Seal of England, whose Place is counted to be worth 2000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year. Under him he has a Deputy, and other Officers to a great Number, who give their actual attendance respectively in the Dispatch of Business.</P>
<P>Upon this General Post-Office depends 182 Deputy Post-Masters in England and Scotland; most of which keep regular Offices in their Stages, and Sub-Post Masters in their Branches. So that there is no considerable Market-Town but has an easy and certain. Conveyance for Letters to and from the said Post Office in the due Course of the Mails every Post.</P>
<P>There are Weekly three general Post Days to send from London to any Part of <HI>England, Wales, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> viz. Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The Returns certain upon Mundays, Wednesdays, or Fridays; ex∣cept
<PB N="48" REF="225" MS="y"/><HI>Ireland,</HI> from whence the Return is not so certain, by reason of the Sea.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Kent</HI> and the <HI>Downs,</HI> the Post goes thi∣ther from London every Day of the Week, ex∣cept Sundays.</P>
<P>The Post Days fix'd for <HI>France, Italy, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> are Mundays and Thurs∣days.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Low-Countries, Germany, Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>other Parts</HI> that way, Tuesdays and Fridays.</P>
<P>But, since our late Breach with France, his Majesty to out off all immediate Correspondency with that Kingdom, has settled the Correspondency with Spain and Portugal by Sea, from <HI>Falmouth</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Cornwal,</HI> to the <HI>Groyn</HI> a Sea-Port Town of Gal∣licia in Spain. And the Letters to <HI>Italy</HI> go by the way of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>For the Transports of Letters and Pacquets over Sea, there are
<LIST>
<ITEM>Between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> 2 Pacquet, Boats.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> 3 Pacquet, Boats.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> 3 Pacquet, Boats.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> 2 Pacquet, Boats.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The last of which goes out on Tuesdays e∣very Fortnight.</P>
<P>All which Offices, Post-Masters, and Pacque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Boats are maintained at the Post-master Gene∣ral's own Charge.</P>
<P>For the better Ordering whereof, he has se∣veral Officers under him, amongst which these are the chief, viz. <HI>two Comptrollers,</HI> one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inland, and the other of the Outland Office, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Receiver General,</HI> an <HI>Accomptant General,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>twelve Clerks,</HI> whereof six of the Inland, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the other six of the Outland Office.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="225"/>
<P>Now for the Conveniency of the Londoners that live far from the Post-Office, there are particular Post-Houses from Place to Place ap∣pointed to take in the Letters, to be transmit∣ted from thence in due time to the General Post-Office.</P>
<P>By what is said, it may easily be guessed in general, that the Charge of the Post-Office is infinitely great. But the Return of it to the King does so much over-ballance it, that this Office yields to his Majesty yearly about Fifty thousand pounds, all Charges born.</P>
<P>Another Use of this excellent Conveniency is in relation to Travellers, whose Business re∣quires expedition. To which purpose there are always Post-horses in readiness in every Post-Stage, which is the main Profit of the Deputy Post-Masters. The Pay is 3 pence for every English Mile, besides the Allowance to the Post-Boy for Conducting.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Peny-Post,</HI> which is used only for London and its Neighbourhood, I have already spoke of it in my Description of London. And so I proceed to the Coyns.</P>
<P>Formerly all English <HI>Coyns</HI> were coyned or stamp'd by Hammers; but, since the Restaura∣tion of King Charles II, a new Way of Stamp∣ing by a Mill or Screw was found out, and fol∣lowed ever since. Which makes the English Coyns, for neatness and security from Coun∣erseiting to be the most excellent.</P>
<P>The Mony of England is either Gold or Sil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, called Sterling Mony. The Gold is either <HI>Guinea,</HI> or a <HI>half Guinea;</HI> the first valued at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Shillings, and six pence, the half Guinea pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtionably, that is, at Ten shillings nine pence. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled <HI>Guinea,</HI> from a Country of that Name in
<PB N="50" REF="226"/>Africa, from whence is brought the Gold where∣of this Coyn is made.</P>
<P>But there is besides, an old sort of Goid, cal∣led <HI>Jacobus,</HI> from King James I. under whose Reign it was Coyned, at the value of 22 shil∣lings, now current at 25 shillings 6 pence. An∣other Coyn, called <HI>Broad-piece,</HI> coyned in the several Reigns of King James and King Charles I, at the value of 20 Shillings, and now current at 23 and 6 pence. But the Broad-pieces and Jacobus's, being both a pure sort of Gold, are kept close by the Curious, and therefore seldom seen abroad.</P>
<P>The Silver Coyns now current in England are a <HI>Crown, Half-crown, Shilling, Six-pence, Four∣pence, Three-pence, Two-pence,</HI> and <HI>One Peny.</HI> A∣mongst which the <HI>Half-crowns, Shillings,</HI> and <HI>Six-pences</HI> are the most common.</P>
<P>'Tis true there are still besides some <HI>Nine∣pences,</HI> and <HI>Four-pence half peny's;</HI> also, some pieces of <HI>Thirteen-pence-half-peny,</HI> and others half their value. But these are at this time ve∣ry scarce.</P>
<P>For the Conveniency of small Change, and the Benefit of the Poor, <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Half∣pence,</HI> first of Copper, and lately of Tin, have been suffered to be Coyned; but no man is bound to receive them in pay for Rent or Debt.</P>
<P>But, besides the Species, we have (as other Nations) such Collective Words as fignify a Sum, greater or lesser. As the Word <HI>Piece</HI> for 20 Shillings; <HI>Pounds,</HI> when the Sum amounts to 60 Shilling, and above; a <HI>Mark,</HI> whch is 13 Shillings 4 pence; an <HI>Angel,</HI> 10 Shillings; a <HI>Noble,</HI> 6 Shillings 8 Pence. 'Tis true there are <HI>Angels</HI> to be seen in Specie, which is a piece <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gold so called from the Impression of an An∣gel.
<PB N="51" REF="226"/>But the proper Use of it has been, in for∣mer Reigns, for such as the King touched for the Evil.</P>
<P>The Spanish, French, and Flemish Gold is almost of equal fineness with the English; and so is the French Silver almost as fine as the English.</P>
<P>The Office of the Mint, where all English Coyns are coyned, is kept in the Tower of London. And the Officers that belong to it were made a Corporation by King Edward III, by virtue of whose Charter they have been al∣ways exempted from all publick Offices, and their Estates free from all Taxes and Parish Duties.</P>

<P>The <HI>Warden,</HI> or Keeper of the Mint, receives the Gold and Silver brought in by the Mer∣chants, Goldsmiths, and others, and pays them for the same. He is the chief Officer, and o∣versees all the rest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Master and Worker</HI> receives the Bullion, (that is, the Gold and Silver to be coyned) from the Warden, causes it to be melted, deli∣vers it to the Moneyers, and when it is Minted, receives it again from them.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="227"/>
<P>The <HI>Comptroller</HI>'s Office is to see, that the Mo∣ny be all made according to just Assize, and to comptroll the Officers, if it don't prove accor∣dingly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Assay-Master</HI> weighs the Bullion, and sees that it be according to the Standard.</P>
<P>The <HI>Auditors</HI> take and make up the Ac∣counts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Surveyor of the Melting</HI> sees the Bullion cast, after the Assay-Master has made trial thereof; and that it be not altered, after it is delivered to the Melter</P>
<P>But, besides the foresaid Officers, there is the Provost of the Company of Moneyers, the King's chief Clerk, and four other Clerks for the Receipt Office, the Melters and Smiths, the Blanchers, Moulders, Labourers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Weights</HI> and <HI>Measures</HI> ought to be by Magna Charta, the same all over England, that is, according to the King's Standard kept in the Exchequer by the Clerk (or Comptroller) of the Market.</P>
<P>The <HI>Weights</HI> now used throughout all Eng∣land are of two sorts, the one called <HI>Troy-Weight,</HI> and the other <HI>Avoir du pois;</HI> the first containing 12 Ounces, and the other 16 in the Pound. But then the Ounce <HI>Avoir du pois</HI> is lighter than the <HI>Ounce Troy</HI> by almost a 12th part. For, whereas in <HI>Troy-Weight</HI> the Ounce consists of 480 Grains, the Ounce <HI>Avoir du pois</HI> contain∣eth but 438 Grains.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Troy-Weight</HI> are weighed Pearls, pre∣cious-Stones, Gold, Silver, Bread, all manner of Corn and Grain; and this Weight the Apo∣thecaries do or ought to use. By <HI>Avoir du pois</HI> are weighed all Grocery Ware, Flesh, Butter, Cheese, Iron, Hemp, Flax, Tallow, Wax, Lead,
<PB N="53" REF="227"/>Steel, and all things whereof comes Waste. In consideration whereof 112 Pound <HI>Avoir du pois</HI> goes to a Hundred-Weight, and proportio∣nably 56 pound to half a Hundred, and 28 to a Quarter, or Tod. A Stone amongst Lon∣don Butchers makes 8 pounds of this Weight, but in the Country 'tis for the most part 14.</P>
<P>In <HI>Troy-Weight</HI> 20 Grains make a Scruple, thus marked ℈, 3 Scruples a Drachm ʒ, 8 Drachms an Ounce ℥, and 12 Ounces a Pound <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> In <HI>Avoir du pois Weight,</HI> 16 Drachms make an Ounce, 16 Ounces a Pound, 28 Pound a Quar∣ter, 4 Quarters a Hundred, and 20 Hundred a Tun.</P>
<P>In <HI>Troy Weight,</HI> 24 Grains of Wheat make a Peny-Weight Sterling, 20 Peny-Weights an Ounce, and 12 Ounces a Pound. And, when Wheat is at 5 Shillings the Bushel, the Peny Wheaten Loaf is then by Statute to weigh 11 Ounces Troy, and three half Peny White Loaves to weigh as much. But the Houshold Peny-Loaf is to weigh 14 Troy Ounces, and two thirds.</P>
<P>As for the Weight called <HI>Venice-Ounce</HI> used here, as in other Countries by Silk-men, there is no Standard of it, nor is it allowed by Law. This Ounce being but 13 Peny Weight and 12 Grains, it falls out that 12 Ounces <HI>Venice</HI> is but 8 Ounces 4 peny <HI>Troy,</HI> and 9 Ounces <HI>Avoir du pois.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Measares</HI> are either Applicative, or Recep∣tive, that is, such as Things are measured by out∣wardly, or inwardly.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="228"/>
<P>Of the first Sort, there is first an <HI>Inch,</HI> or fingers Breadth, 4 whereof make a <HI>Hand-full,</HI> and 12 a <HI>Foot.</HI> Now 3 Foot makes a <HI>Yard,</HI> and one Yard and a quarter an <HI>Ell.</HI> Five Foot makes a Geometrical <HI>Pace,</HI> 6 a <HI>Fadom,</HI> 16 and a half a <HI>Perch, Pole,</HI> or <HI>Rod.</HI> Forty <HI>Perches</HI> make a <HI>Furlong,</HI> 8 Furlongs (or 320 Perches) an En∣glish <HI>Mile,</HI> and 3 English Miles a French <HI>League,</HI> whereof 3 go to a <HI>Degree.</HI> But this observe by the way, that by a Statute under the Reign of Henry VII, an English Mile ought to be 1760 Yards, or 5280 Foot, that is 280 Foot more than the Italian Mile.</P>
<P>Now an <HI>Acre</HI> of Land in England consists of 40 Perches in length, and 4 in breadth; a <HI>Yard-Land,</HI> commonly of 30 Acres; and an <HI>Hide</HI> of Land of 100 Acres.</P>
<P>The Receptive <HI>Measure</HI> is two-fold, that is, either for liquid, or dry Things. For Liquid, as a <HI>Pint,</HI> which is subdivided into lesser Parts, as <HI>half a Pint,</HI> a <HI>Quartern</HI> or quarter of a Pint. Now 2 Pints make a <HI>Quart,</HI> 2 Quarts a <HI>Pottle,</HI> 2 Pottles a <HI>Gallon,</HI> 8 Gallons a <HI>Firkin</HI> of Ale, and 9 a <HI>Firkin</HI> of Beer. Two Firkins of either sort make a <HI>Kilderkin,</HI> and 2 Kilderkins a <HI>Bar∣rel.</HI> But still the Difference in the Number of <HI>Gallons</HI> as to Beer and Ale ought to be minded and allowed. For, as a Kilderkin of Beer con∣tains 18 Gallons, and one of Ale but 16; so a Barrel of Beer being double a Kilderkin, con∣tains 36 Gallons, and one of Ale but 32.</P>
<P>Now a Barrel and a half of Beer (being 54 Gallons) make a <HI>Hogshead,</HI> 2 Hogshheads a <HI>Pipe</HI> or <HI>Butt,</HI> and 2 Pipes a <HI>Tun.</HI></P>
<P>Note, that a Barrel of Butter or Soap is the same with a Barrel of Ale.</P>
<P>As for Wine-Measures, they fall so much short of those of Ale and Beer, that Four Gal∣lons
<PB N="55" REF="228"/>of these make Five Gallous of Wine mea∣sure. Thus they hold proportion as four to five. Of these Gallons a <HI>Rundlet</HI> of Wine holds 18, <HI>half a Hogshead</HI> 31 and a half, a <HI>Tierce</HI> 42, a <HI>Hogshead</HI> 63, a <HI>Punchion</HI> 84, a <HI>Pipe</HI> or <HI>Butt</HI> 126, a <HI>Tun</HI> 252.</P>
<P>For dry Things, such as Corn or Grain, there is first the <HI>Gallon,</HI> of a fize between the Wine and the Beer Gallon. Two of these Gallons make a <HI>Peck,</HI> 4 Pecks a <HI>Bushel,</HI> 4 Bushels a <HI>Comb</HI> or <HI>Curnock,</HI> 2 Curnocks a <HI>Quarter,</HI> 10 Quarters a <HI>Last</HI> or <HI>Wey.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude now with the <HI>Great Trade of England</HI> to Foreign Parts, besides the several Companies I have took notice of in my De∣scription of London, there are other <HI>Compa∣nies</HI> or Societies of Merchants, established for the promoting or incouraging of foreign Trade. Which have Power and Immunities granted them to make Acts and Orders, for the benefit of Commerce in general, and of their Compa∣nies in particular. Such are amongst others, the <HI>Company of Merchant Adventurers,</HI> the <HI>Russia, Turky,</HI> and <HI>East-India Companies,</HI> and the <HI>Royal African Company.</HI> Besides the <HI>Spanish, French, East-Land,</HI> and <HI>Greenland Companies,</HI> and the <HI>Company trading to Hudson's Bay,</HI> the Priviledges and Trade of which last were lately confirmed by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>The first being the <HI>Company of Merchant Ad∣venturers,</HI> is the most ancient of all, having had their Original in the Reign of Edward I, and their Continuance ever since. Grounded at first upon the Exportation of Wool only, be∣ing the prime and staple Commodity of Eng∣land; since converted into Cloathing, and now including all manner of Drapery. This Com∣pany
<PB N="56" REF="229"/>is managed in England by a Governour, Deputy, and certain Assistants; beyond Sea, by a Deputy, and certain Assistants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Russia Company</HI> had their Beginning in the Reign of Edward VI, upon the Discovery made by the English of the North-East Passage to Archangel, whereby they opened a great Trade in the Dominions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zars of Moscovy, removed hither from Narva up∣on the Baltick. Their Charter was after∣wards confirmed and inlarged by Queen Eliza∣beth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turky-Merchants,</HI> otherwise called the <HI>Levant Company,</HI> from their Trade in the Levant, was Incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, and had their Charter Confirmed and Inlarged by King James I.</P>
<P>But the greatest and most eminent Compa∣ny is that which manages the <HI>East-India Trade,</HI> which begun likewise in Queen Elizabeths Time, Anno 1600. For the Managing whereof, they imploy a joint Stock, and have a great House in Leaden-Hall-Street, called the East-India House. By which Trade and Stock they have built a great Number of War-like Ships, and brought hither those Indian Commodities which be∣fore were brought to us by the Portugueze, being the first Discoverers of the East-India Passage.</P>
<P>So that by the East-India and the Levant Companies, England, and many other Countries by their second Transportation, have ever since been supplied with those Rich Merchandizes which <HI>Italy, Turky, Arabia, Persia, India,</HI> and <HI>China</HI> yield; where they have their respective Agents. On the Coast of <HI>Coromandel</HI> is the <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> belonging to the East-India Company, where they have a President of all
<PB N="57" REF="229"/>the Factories on that Coast, and of the Bay of <HI>Bengala.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Royal African Company,</HI> King Charles II was pleased by his Letters Patents, to grant them a Liberty of Trading all along the Western Coasts of Africk, from Cape Vert as far as the Cape of good Hope, with prohibition of Tra∣ding there to all his other Subjects. At <HI>Cape-Coast</HI> is the Residence of the chief Agent of the Company, where they have a strong Place or Fort.</P>
<P>I pass by the other Companies, though some of them very considerable; and the great Trade of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> generally managed by Mer∣chants not Incorporated. Only I shall add, that every Company has the Priviledge to govern themselves by setled Acts and Orders, under such Governours, Deputies, Assistants, and A∣gents as they think fit to chuse among them∣selves. And this way has been found to be so profitable and beneficial, by Exporting the na∣tive Commodities thereof, by setting the Poor on Work, by building of many brave Ships, and by Importing hither of forein Commodities both for Use and Ornament, that the Benefit accruing thereby to these Nations cannot be expressed.</P>
<P>The principal Commodities exported from hence into forein Countries are Woollen Cloths of all sorts, broad and narrow, the English be∣ing now the best Cloth-Workers in the World. To which add <HI>Sattins, Tabies, Velvets, Plushes,</HI> and infinite other <HI>Manufactures;</HI> some of which make very good Returns from the foreign Plan∣tations.</P>
<P>Abundance of <HI>Tin, Lead, Alum, Copper, Iron, Fullers Earth, Salt,</HI> and <HI>Sea-Coal,</HI> of most sorts of <HI>Grains,</HI> but <HI>Wheat</HI> especially, of <HI>Skins</HI> and
<PB N="58" REF="230"/><HI>Leather,</HI> of <HI>Trane Oyl</HI> and <HI>Tallow, Hops</HI> and <HI>Beer, Saffron</HI> and <HI>Licorish,</HI> besides great Plenty of <HI>Sea∣fish,</HI> is yearly transported over Sea to forein Conntries.</P>
<P>From whence the Merchants make good Re∣turns, and bring a great deal of Treasure and rich Commodities, to the Inriching of them∣selves, the unspeakable benefit of the Nation, and the Credit of the English in general. Who are as industrious and active, as fair Dealers, and great Undertakers as any Nation in the World.</P>
<P>For, though the Hollanders perhaps do drive a greater Trade, 'tis neither for want of Stock, nor for want of Industry, on the side of the English. The Hollanders, being squeezed as they are within the narrow Bounds of their Coun∣try, find little or no Land to purchase, with the Returns of their Trade. This puts 'em upon a kind of Necessity of improving still their Stock, and of sending back those Riches a float∣ing upon the Sea which they cannot fix on the Land. Whereas our English Merchants having the Opportunity of Injoying the Fruits of their Industry, in a spacious, delicate, fruitful Coun∣try, by purchasing Estates for themselves and Families, are apt to yield to the Temptation, and to exchange the hurry of Trade for the pleasures of a Country-life.</P>

<PB N="59" REF="230"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the English Laws, and Religion.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Laws of England are of several Sorts, and severally used according to the Subject.</P>
<P>First there is the <HI>Common Law,</HI> that is, the Common Customs of the Nation, which have by length of time obtained the force of Laws. This is the Summary of the Laws of the Sax∣ons and Danes, first reduced into one Body by King Edward the Elder, about the Year 900. Which, for some time being lost, were revived by King Edward the Confessor, and by Posterity named his Laws. To these William the Conquerour having added some of the good Customs of Normandy, he caused them all to be written in his own Norman Dialect; which, being no where vulgarly used, varies no more than the Latine. Therefore to this day all Reports, Pleadings, and Law-Exercises, Declarations upon Original Writs, and all Records are written in the old Nor∣man.</P>
<P>But where the Common Law falls short, the <HI>Statute Law</HI> makes it up. Which are the Laws made from time to time by King and Par∣liament.</P>
<P>The <HI>Civil Law,</HI> which is counted the Law of Nations, is peculiarly made use of in all Ecclesiastical Courts, in the Court of Ad∣miralty,
<PB N="60" REF="231"/>in That of the Earl Marshal, in Trea∣ties with forein Princes, and lastly in the Two Universities of the Land.</P>
<P>The <HI>Canon-Law,</HI> otherwise called the Eccle∣siastical Laws, takes place in Things that meer∣ly relate to Religion. This Law comprehends the Canons of many ancient General Councils, of many National and Provincial English Sy∣nods, divers Decrees of the Bishops of Rome, and Judgments of ancient Fathers, received by the Church of England, and incorporated into the Body of the Canon Law. By which she did ever proceed in the Exercise of her Jurisdiction, and do's still by virtue of an Act in the Reign of Henry VIII, so far as the said Canons and Constitutions are not repugnant to the Holy Scripture, to the Kings Preroga∣tive, or the Laws of this Realm. But, where∣as Temporal Laws inflict Punishment upon the Body, these properly concern the Soul of Man. And, as they differ in several Ends, so they differ in several Proceedings.</P>
<P>The <HI>Martial Law</HI> reaches none but Souldiers and Mariners, and is not to be used but in time of actual War. But the late King, who ran headlong to Arbitrary Power, made nothing of violating this, and most other Laws.</P>
<P>The <HI>Forest-Law</HI> concerns the Forests, and in flicts Punishment on those that trespass up∣on them. By virtue of this Law, the Will is reputed for the Fact; so that, if a Man be taken hunting a Deer, he may be Arrested as if he had taken it.</P>
<P>Lastly, there are <HI>Municipal Laws,</HI> common∣ly called <HI>Peculiar</HI> (or <HI>By</HI>) <HI>Laws,</HI> proper to Corporations. These are the Laws which the Magistrates of a Town or City, by virtue of the King's Charter, have a Power to make for
<PB N="61" REF="231"/>the benefit and advantage of their Corpora∣tion; Provided always, that the same be not repugnant to the Laws of the Land. These By-Laws properly bind none but the Inhabi∣tants of the Place, unless they be for publick Good, or to avoid a publick Inconvenience. In which Case they bind Strangers.</P>
<P>Thus much in general as to the Laws of Eng∣land. The chief Particulars will come in of course, when I come to treat of the Government.</P>
<P>The <HI>Religion</HI> of England, as it is establish∣ed by Law, is the best Reformed Religion, and the most agreeable to the primitive Times of Christianity. But, before I come to shew the Occasion, Time, and Methods of its Re∣formation, it will not be improper to give a brief historical Account how the Christian Faith came to be planted in this Island, to set forth its Progress, Decay, and Restauration; then its Corruption with Rome, and at last its Reformation.</P>
<P>That Christianity was planted here in the Apostles Times, long before King <HI>Lucius,</HI> is plainly demonstrated by the <HI>Antiquity of the British Churches,</HI> writ some Years since by <HI>Dr. Stillingfleet,</HI> the present Bishop of Worcester. Where he learnedly disproves the Tradition concerning <HI>Joseph of Arimathea</HI> (supposed by many to have been the first Planter of the Go∣spel here) as an Invention of the Monks of <HI>Glassenbury,</HI> to serve their Interests, by ad∣vancing the Reputation of their Monastery; and makes it highly probable, that S. Paul (rather than S. Peter, as others would have it) was the first Founder of a Church in this Island. But, by reason of Persecutions, or for want of a supply of Preachers, Christianity
<PB N="62" REF="232"/>did not flourish here till the Reign of <HI>Lucius</HI> the British King, and the first Christian King in Europe. Of whose imbracing Christianity the learned Bishop gives this Account from the Testimony of ancient Writers, that the was first inclined thereto by the Persuasion of <HI>Eluanus</HI> and <HI>Eduinus,</HI> two British Christians, who were probably imploy'd to convince him. But, being workt upon on the other side by his <HI>Druids,</HI> he would not come to any Resolu∣tion, till he had sent to Rome for his further Satisfaction, and to know how far the British Christians and those of Rome agreed. <HI>Elen∣therus</HI> was then Bishop of Rome, and the twelfth from the Apostles. To whom he sent the foresaid <HI>Eluanus</HI> and <HI>Meduinus</HI> about the Year 180, presuming (as he might reasonably then) that the Christian Doctrine was there truly taught, at so little distance from the A∣postles, and in a Place whither a Resort was made from all Parts, because of its being the Imperial City. For there was then no Ima∣gination of S. Peter's having appointed the Head of the Church there, nor a long time after in the British Churches, as appears by the Contest of the British Bishops with Augustine the Monk.</P>
<P>King <HI>Lucius,</HI> being satisfied upon the Return of his Embassadors from Rome, imbraced the Christian Faith, and received the Baptism. So that by the piety of his Example, and the diligence of the first Preachers, Christianity soon spread over his Dominions, and sometime after over all the Island. And then the <HI>Britains</HI> had Bishops of their own, without any Juri∣dical Dependency from the See of Rome, the British Church continuing a distinct and in∣dependent Church from all others.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="232"/>
<P>But, when the Heathen <HI>Saxons</HI> came to be possessed of this Part of the Island, and the Natives forced to take shelter amongst the Mountains of Wales, the Christian Faith fled with them, and this Country was again dark∣ened with Heathenism. Till about the Year 596. Austin the Monk was sent by Pope Gre∣gory the Great, to preach the Gospel here. By whose Diligence and Zeal the Work pro∣spered so well, that all the Saxons were by degrees converted to the Christian Faith, and Austin made the first Arcsh-bishop of Canter∣bury, but with a subjection to the Church of Rome. Thus, as the Errours crept on in the Roman, the British Church grew infected with them, and continued subject to the Power and Errours of Rome, till King Henry VIII laid the Ground for a Reformation, by his resum∣ing the Power of the Christian British Kings his ancient Predecessors, and removing by virtue of it the forfeited Primacy of Rome to the See of Canterbury. But 'tis Observable withall, that this Ejection of the Pope's Au∣thority was not done (as in other Nations) tumultuously, and by the Power of the People, but by the Counsel and Advice of godly and learned Divines assembled in Convocation by the King's Authority, and ratified by the Three States in Parliament.</P>
<P>Thus the ancient Dignity and Supremacy of the Kings of England being restored, and the Subjects delivered from the Spiritual Ty∣ranny of the Pope of Rome, the King and Clergy took this Occasion to inquire into and reform the great Abuses and Errours crept into the Church. Whose Method in this Work (begun in Henry's Reign, and brought
<PB N="64" REF="233"/>to perfection in his next Successor's Time) Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> sets forth in these Words. The Architects, says he, in this great Work, with∣out respect unto the Dictates of Luther or Calvin, looking only on God's Word and the Primitive Patterns, abolished such Things as were repugnant unto either, but still retained such Ceremonies in God's publick Worship as were agreeable to both, and had been coun∣tenanced by the Practice of the Primitive Times. A Point wherein they did observe a greater Measure of Christian Prudence and Moderation, than their Neighbour Churches, Which in a meer detestation of the See of Rome, allowed of nothing which had formerly been in use amongst them, because defiled with Popish Errors and Abuses; utterly avert∣ing thereby those of the Papal Party from joyning with them in the Work, or coming over to them when the Work was done. Whereas, had they continued an allowable Correspondency in these Extrinsecals of Re∣ligion with the Church of Rome, their Party in the World had been far greater, and not so much stomached as it is. And this Opini∣on of his he backs with the Sentiment of the Marquess <HI>de Rhosne</HI> in this point, after Duke of <HI>Sully,</HI> and Lord High Treasurer of <HI>France,</HI> one of the chief Men of the Reformed Party there. Who, being sent Embassador to King James from Henry IV. King of France, admired the Decency of Gods publick Service in the Church of England.</P>
<P>Three Things principally are to be consider∣ed in point of Religion, viz. The Doctrine, the Manner of publick Worship, and the Church Government.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="233"/>
<P>As for the Doctrine of the Church of Eng∣land, 'tis the same in all Points with other Reformed Churches, as it appears by her Con∣fession of Faith contained in the 39 Articles. The Manner of publick Worship differs in nothing from them, but in the Excellency of it. So many admirable Prayers the English Liturgy contains, sutable to all Occasions, di∣gested in a plain Evangelical Style, without Rhetorical Raptures, which are fitter for a de∣signing Orator than an humble Addresser to the Mercy-Seat of God. In short, there is no∣thing wanting in the Church of England, in order to Salvation. She uses the Word of God, the Ten Commandments, the Faith of the Apostles, the Creeds of the Primitive Church, the Articles of the four first General Councils, an excellent Liturgy, the Admini∣stration of the Sacraments, and all the Pre∣cepts and Counsels of the Gospel. She attri∣butes all Glory to God, worships his most holy Name, and owns all his Attributes. She a∣dores the Trinity in Unity, the Unity in Tri∣nity. She teaches Faith and Repentance, the Necessity of good Works, the strictness of a holy Life, and an humble Obedience to the Supreme Power. Charity, which is the grand Mark of the true Church, is so essential to this, that she do's not ingross Heaven to her self, so as to damn all others into Hell. For the publick Service and Worship of God she has Places, Times, Persons, and Revenues set a∣part for that purpose; and an uninterrupted Succession of Bishops, to ordain Priests and Deacons, and do all other Duties iucumbent to that Dignity.</P>

<P>Happy were it for England, if all its Sub∣jects would live in the Communion of this Church, and not separate from it; which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thing more to be wished, than hoped for. But such is the designing and ambitious Spirit of Popery, to weaken the Church of England (ever since the Reformation lookt upon as the chiefest Bulwark against Popery) that it has caused all our Distractions, in order to fish the better in troubled Waters. Yet whatever have been the Effects of it hitherto, God has wonderfully defeated their Designs. Insomuch that this Church, formerly scattered and eclip∣sed in the Reign of Charles I, restored (but afterwards undermined) by Charles II, and lately threatned with utter Ruin by his imme∣diate Successor, is now, by the special Provi∣dence of God, in a Hourishing Condition, un∣der the happy Influence of our present King William, the Restorer of our Laws, Religion, and Liberties.</P>
<P>As for the Spirit of Persecution which the Church of England has been charged with in relation to Dissenters, it cannot be justly laid to her Charge. For whatever has been done in that Case was but according to Law, and the Penal Laws were made (as all Statute-Laws) in a regular Manner by the Votes of Parliament, the Representatives of the People, as well Dissenters as others. 'Tis true, the Church-Party proved the most predominant. And yet, in point of Execution, the sober part of the Church were always very tender, and none but hot Men amongst them ready for Execution. Influenced thereto by the Court; which, far from designing the Dissen∣ters Union with the Church, used the Rigour of the Law, to create an implacable Hatred
<PB N="67" REF="234"/>betwixt the afflicting Church and the suffering Body of the Dissenters. Which had a sutable Effect. For these, imbittered what with Fines, what with Imprisonments, tho according to Law, failed not to clamour on all sides against the persecuting Spirit of the Church of Eng∣land, and against those bloudy Laws, as they used to call 'em. The Sense of their present state made them forget what they had done, when they usurped the Regal Power; and how busy they were to imprison, to banish, to sequester. With Grief I rake up these old Sores, and nothing but a just Desire of right∣ing both Parties could have extorted this from me.</P>
<P>But now the Dissenters have got Liberty of Conscience by a late Act of Parliament, with the ready Concurrence of the Church-Party in both Houses, I hope there's no Ground left for Animosities between the Church and Them. And, if the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> who are the nearest to the Church of England, and the greatest Party among Dissenters, now they have seen so much of her incomparable Learning, and in∣vincible Stedfastness to the Protestant Religion and Interest, would but shake off their ground∣less Prejudices, and prefer the happiness of a Reunion before the Danger of a Schism, what a Blessing it would prove to this Nation is al∣most unconceivable. 'Tis not long since the Church was their Sanctuary, when they expect∣ed no Mercy from a late King, who came to the Throne, full of Resentment and Indig∣nation against them. Tho afterwards, to com∣pass his own Ends, he tacked about, and kil∣led them almost with Kindness. And why they should now separate from a Church, which was so lately their Refuge, when they crowd∣ed
<PB N="68" REF="235"/>the very Church-Men out of Church, it is past my Understanding. For the Church of England is the same still. Were they but so well-minded as to make the least step towards a Reunion, I am assured the Church of Eng∣land would be very forward to meet them. Rather than they should continue their Sepa∣ration, and be Accountable to Gods Tribunal for it, I am more than confident she would readily part with such Ceremonies as give 'em most offence. But it is feared, they would not be satisfied with those small Condescen∣sions. They are for more substantial Things, which for Peace sake I shall forbear to name, and leave for the Reader to guess.</P>
<P>The main Points wherein they differ from the Church of England is the Church Govern∣ment, and the publick Worship. They hold, that the Church was governed in the begin∣ning by Presbyters or Elders, and that it should be so governed still, not by Bishops; upon which account they got the Name of Presbyterians. They except both against the latitude of the Bishops Power, and the large∣ness of their Revenues, as if neither of them could be used by the Clergy with Christian Moderation. But it is more probable, the unshaken fidelity of Bishops to Monarchy which many of the Dissenters were never very fond of, sticks most in their Stomack For publick Worship they use no Liturgy wherein they differ from the Protestan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Churches, beyond Sea. They look upon Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Forms as dead Prayers, and delight only o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Extemporal. Therefore the Lord's Prayer i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a manner exploded by the rigid Sort o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them. Yet one would think when their Mi∣nister
<PB N="69" REF="235"/>prays before the Congregation, his Prayer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a set Form to such as pray with him. The Surplice, the Sign of the Cross, the bowing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Name of Jesus, and the kneeling at the Communion, are to them so many Sins. They deal plainly with God, at least in out∣ward appearance; and are resolved, as far as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> see, to serve him without Ceremony. Great Predestinarians many of 'em are, and very strict Observers of the Sabbath. In short, their ap∣parent Soberness in Conversation, and Zeal in their Devotion, has so increased their Num∣ber, that they are lookt upon as the chief Party amongst all the Dissenters.</P>
<P>Next to whom, both in their Opinions and Number, are the <HI>Independents,</HI> or <HI>Congregationa∣lists.</HI> So called, for that they will have every particular Congregation to be ruled by their own Laws, without dependence upon any other in Church-Matters. For they prefer their own Gathered Churches in private Places to the publick Congregations in Churches, which in contempt they call by the name of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceeple-Houses. In most Things else they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mp with the Presbyterians. Except those particular Tenets some of 'em have intertain∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, which for brevities sake I forbear to enu∣merate. The riged sort of 'em (called Brownists) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efuse to Communicate with any of the Re∣formed Churches.</P>
<P>The <HI>Anabaptists</HI> are so called from Rebapti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing those who coming to their Communion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere baptized in their Infancy. For one of their chief Tenets is against Pedobaptism, or baptizing of Children. They hold besides, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Lay-people may preach. As for those blasphe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Opinions, their Fore-fathers have been
<PB N="70" REF="236"/>charged with, I hope few of the modern And baptists in England are guilty of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Millenarians,</HI> or <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-Men,</HI> are so called from their Expectation of Christ's temporal Kingdom here on Earth for a thou∣sand Years. And this they ground upon seve∣ral Places of Scripture, which from a Spiri∣tual they wrest into a Carnal Sense.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> are a sort of Enthusiasts; so called, because they use to quake and groan, when they wait for the Spirit. Whereas the Spirit of God is a Spirit of Peace and Quiet∣ness, not to be found in Fire, Earth-quakes, and Whirl-winds, but in the soft and still Voice. They reject all Ministerial Ordinances, and rail against premeditated Preaching o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Praying. The Holy Scripture is no Rule for 'em to go by, but Inspiration and the Light they pretend to is all in all with them. So that any Man or Woman in their Meetings that fancies first to be seized with the Spirit, is free to stand up for a Teacher to the Con∣gregation, and utter what comes next. They use no Sacraments, and consequently they are but half Christians. Their Principle is for E∣quality amongst Men, which of it self tends to Anarchy. Therefore they shew respect to no Man, tho they love it well enough from Men of other Principles. They Thou all Men, Kings and Coblers alike, without any distinction, and pull off their Hats to none. They affect a singular Plainness in their Speech, in their Garb, and in their Dealings. They are for plain Yea and Nay; and not a word of an Oath, tho imposed by the Magistrate. A Ribbon, a Loop, or a Lace, is a mortal Sin with them; and this Plainness I should not much condemn,
<PB N="71" REF="236"/>if Pride did not lurk under it. In their Deal∣ings, they have indeed got a good Name, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hope it is not groundless; though some un∣lucky men have endeavoured to check it, by representing them as a crafty and subtle Gene∣ration.</P>
<P>These are the principal Sects that are now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Kingdom. Besides the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> properly called <HI>Recusants,</HI> whose Number and interest is much decayed since the Fall of King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ames.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Ranters, Adamites, Familists, Antino∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians, Sweet-Singers, Muggletonians,</HI> and I know not what else, as they suddenly sprung up like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>shrooms, so they are in a manner dwindled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto nothing. And indeed their Opinions were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo blasphemous and senseless, to hold out long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongst Men of any Sense.</P>
<P>In Conclusion, 'tis observable how the Dif∣ference of Sentiments in Matters of Religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ters the very Temper of Men of the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation; so that one would think they don't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reath the same Air, nor live in the same Cli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate.

<PB N="72" REF="237"/>Lastly, if the Churchmen in their way of Dealing buy of all Men, without any distin∣ction for Conscience sake, these out of Bro∣therly kindness trade most amongst themselves. So true it is, that the very outward Profession of Religion works upon the inward Parts, either for better or for worse.</P>
<P>This Observation may be further Illustrated by the late Conduct of the French, a Nation which for many Ages has been lookt upon as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pattern of Civility and good Manners. To see how a false Notion of Religion has turned in that Kingdom Men into very Brutes, and Gen∣teelness into Barbarity, is almost past my Un∣derstanding. The Popish Massacre of the French Protestants in the Reign of Charles IX, as cruel and bloody as it was, was nothing to the late refined Persecution. In that Massacre those that suffered were presently dispatched, and rid of their Sufferings; but in this Persecution a pre∣sent Death of the Persecuted was a Penance to the Persecutor. For the Design of the Perse∣cutors was not to take away the Lives of Pro∣testants, but all the Comforts of their Lives by Want and barbarous Usage, spoiling an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plundering, dark Prisons and loathsom Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣geons, by parting the Husband and Wife, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> robbing Parents of their dearest Children.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the English Government, in ge∣neral.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ENGLAND,</HI> if we except the late di∣stracted Times before the Restauration of Charles II, has been always governed by Sovereign Princes. Before the Romans came in, the Britains being divided into several Na∣tions, each of them was governed by its own Kings and particular Princes.</P>
<P>When Britain became a Member of the Ro∣man Empire, then the Britains were under the Roman Emperours. Yet so, that many of their Tribes had their own Kings, who were suffered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o govern by their own Law, but then they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere Tributary. Such Kings were <HI>Codigunus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d <HI>Prasitagus</HI> mentioned by Tacitus, <HI>Lucius</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he first Christian King, and <HI>Coilus</HI> the Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Helena, Mother of Constantine the Great. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd 'tis observable, that the Policy of the Ro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans in suffering Kings in the Conquered Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, was to make them (as Tacitus says) <HI>Ser∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tutis Instrumenta,</HI> that is, instrumental to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oples Bondage.</P>
<PB N="74" REF="238"/>
<P>After the Romans had quitted the Stage of Britain, upon the Irruption of the Huns into Ita∣ly in the Empire of Honorius, (which hap∣ned in the Fifth Century) the Kingly Govern∣ment returned to the Britains. Who chose for their King <HI>Constantine,</HI> Brother of Aldroinus, King of Britany in France, a Prince of the British Blood. To whom succeeded <HI>Constantius</HI> his Son; then <HI>Vortiger,</HI> who usurped the Crown, and to defend his Title against his Enemies first called in the Saxons. These having got sure footing in this Kingdom, never left the Britains quiet, till they were possessed of the Whole. And, though they were overthrown in many Battels by King <HI>Vortimer,</HI> the Son and imme∣diate Successor of Vortiger, and afterwards by King <HI>Arthur,</HI> One of the Worlds Nine Wor∣thies, yet the Britains were soon after his Death so broken and weakened, that they were forced at last to yield, and to exchange this Part of Britain for the Mountains of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Britains left the Stage, and the Sax∣ons entred, but still with a Regal Power. By these the Country was divided into Seven King∣doms, the several Names and Extent whereo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you have in my First Part.

<PB N="75" REF="238"/>
<P>This Heptarchy continued thus for several Ages separate and distinct, till the prevailing Fortune of the West-Saxons united them all into one, by the Name of <HI>England.</HI> Which hapned Anno 819, in the Reign of King <HI>Egbert,</HI> the last King of the West-Saxons, and the first of England. Who, having vanquished all the rest of the Saxon Kings, and added most of their Estates to his own, caused the whole uni∣ted Body to be called <HI>Engel-lond,</HI> since turned into <HI>England,</HI> in a Parliament (or Council) held at Winchester, in the Year aforesaid. And by that Name he was then crowned in the presence of his Nobles, and the rest of his Subjects. Though the Truth is, King <HI>Alfred,</HI> a Grandchild of <HI>Egbert,</HI> was he who total∣ly united the Saxon Heptarchy into one E∣state.</P>
<P>Thus, from the Time of Egbert to this present Time, <HI>England</HI> has continued a Monarchy above 870, Year. First, under 15 Kings of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Bace; then under 3 <HI>Danish</HI> Kings; and next to them, under Edward the Confessour, and <HI>Ha∣rold</HI> II, two Kings of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Blood. Who were succeeded by four <HI>Norman</HI> Kings. And after Stephen the last of the Four, the <HI>Saxon</HI> Blood was again restored in the Person of King Henry II, Anno 1155, in whose Blood the Crown has continued ever since.</P>
<P>Now the English Monarchy is none of those Despotical Monarchies, where the Subjects (like Slaves) are at the Arbitrary Power and Will of their Sovereign. An unnatural sort of Govern∣ment, and directly contrary to the true end of Government, which is the Preservation, Welfare, and Happiness of the People. And what Happi∣ness can a People propose to themselves, when instead of being protected, they may be plun∣dered
<PB N="76" REF="239"/>and murdered at the will of their Prince? Men had as good live in a state of Anarchy, as ly at some Princes Mercy, whose unlimited Power serves only to make them furious and outragious. And where lies the Advantage, when the King proves a cruel Tyrant, to be Robbed or Murdered by a Royal, or a common Robber?</P>
<P>The Government of England, Thanks be to God, is better Constituted. 'Tis a Monarchy, but not with that Dominion which a Master has over his Slave. For then the King might lawfully sell all his Subjects, like so many Head of Cattel, and make Mony of his whole Stock when he pleases.</P>
<P>Here the Legislative Power is divided be∣twixt the King and his People, but the Execu∣tive Power is lodged solely in the King. Here the King has his Prerogative, which is the Sup∣port of the Crown; and the People their Pri∣viledges, which assert their Liberty. If the King stretches his Prerogative so far beyond its Bounds, as to overthrow the Liberty of the Subject, he unhinges the Government; and the Government being dissolved, He and the Na∣tion are to seek as in the late King's Case. If any part of the Subjects incroach upon his Preroga∣tive, they undergo the lash of the Law; which is no less tender of the Kings Prerogative, than of the Subjects Liberty.</P>
<P>But the Question is, in case of a Difference betwixt the King and his People, who is a com∣petent Judge.</P>
<P>To answer this Objection, I shall make use of the <HI>Inquiry into the Measures of Submission to the Supream Authority.</HI> 'Tis to be considered, says the Learned and Judicious Author, that some Points are justly disputable and doubtful; and
<PB N="77" REF="239"/>others so manifest, that any Objections made against them are rather forced Pretences, than so much as plausible Colours. If the Case be doubtful, the Interest of the publick Peace and Order ought to carry it. But the Case is quite different, when the Invasions that are made up∣on Liberty and Property, are plain and visible to all that consider them.</P>
<P>But, upon such an Invasion, how can the Sub∣jects of England take up Arms against their King, when the Militia is by several express Laws lodged singly in the King; and those Laws have been put in the form of an Oath, which all that have born any Imployment either in Church or State have sworn? So that, though the Subjects have a Right to their Property by many positive Laws, yet they seem now to have no Right or Means left to preserve it. And here seems to be a Contradiction in the English Government; <HI>viz.</HI> a publick Liberty challenged by the Nation, and grounded upon Law, and yet a Renouncing of all Resistance, when that Liberty is invaded, and that also grounded upon Law.</P>
<P>This is indeed the main Difficulty. But, in Answer to it, this we must take for a general Rule, when there seems to be a Contradiction between two Articles in the Constitution: That we ought to examine which of the two is the most evident, and the most important, and so fix upon it; then we must give such an accom∣modating sense to that which seems to contra∣dict it, that so we may reconcile 'em together. 'Tis plain, that our Liberty is only a Thing that we injoy at the Kings Discretion and du∣ring his Pleasure, if the other against all Resi∣stance is to be understood according to the ut∣most extent of the Words. Therefore, since the chief Design of our whole Law, and of all
<PB N="78" REF="240"/>the several Rules of our Constitution, is to se∣cure and maintain our Liberty, we ought to lay that down for a Conclusion, that it is both the most plain, and the most important of the two. And the other Article against Resistance ought to be so softened, as that it do not destroy us.</P>
<P>If the Law never designed to lodge the Le∣gislative Power in the King, as it is self-evident, 'tis plain it did not intend to secure him in it, in case he should go about to assume it. Therefore the not resisting the King can only be applied to the Executive Power, that so, up∣on no pretence of ill Administrations in the Execution of the Law, it should be lawful to resist him. Another Proof that the Law only designed to secure the King in the Executive Power, is the Words of the Oath, which makes it unlawful to bear Arms against the King, or any Commissionated by him. For, if the Com∣mission be not according to Law, 'tis no Com∣mission; and consequently those who act by virtue of it, are not Commissionated by the King in the sense of the Law.</P>
<P>Besides, all general Words, how compre∣hensive soever, are still supposed to have a tacit Exception and Reserve in them, if the matter seem to require it. Thus Children are commanded to obey their Parents in <HI>all Things;</HI> and Wives are declared by the Scripture to be subject to their Husbands in <HI>all Things, as the Church is unto Christ.</HI> For odious Things ought not to be suspected, and therefore not named upon such Occasions; but when they fall out, they carry still their own force with them. So by our Form of Marriage, the Parties swear to one another, <HI>till Death them do part;</HI> and yet few doubt but that this Bond is dissolved by Adultery, though it is not named.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="240"/>
<P>In short, when a King of England strikes at the very Foundations of the Government, as the late King did, and that his Maleversations are not only the effect of Humane Frailty, of Ignorance, Inadvertencies, or Passions, to which all Princes may be subject, as well as other Men, in such Cases that King may fall from his Pow∣er, or at least from the Exercise of it, and such his Attempts (in the very Judgement of the greatest Assertors of Monarchy,) naturally di∣vest him of his whole Authority. To this purpose we have still fresh before us the Example of the late King of Portugal, who for a few Acts of Rage fatal to very few Persons, was put under a Guardianship, and kept a Prisoner till he died, and his Brother the present King made Regent in his place. Which it seems was (at least secretly) approved by most of the Crowned Heads of Europe, and even our Court gave the first Countenance to it. Though of all others, King Charles II. had the least Reason to do it, since it justified a Younger Brother's supplanting the Elder. But the Evidence of the Thing carried it even a∣gainst Interest.</P>
<P>These are my Authors Arguments, which I thought fit to insist upon, to justify the Na∣tions taking up Arms for the Defence of their Laws, Religion, and Property, against the late King's actual and bare-faced Subverting the whole Frame of this most happy and blessed Government.</P>
<P>A Government which has made many Kings glorious beyond the Great Nimrod of France, and their People happy beyond all other Na∣tions. A Government which allows enough to a King that cares not to be a Tyrant, and e∣nough to the People to keep them from Sla∣very.
<PB N="80" REF="241"/>When the King's Prerogative do's not interfere with the Liberty of the People, or the Peoples Liberty with the Kings Preroga∣tive, that is, when both King and People keep within their own Sphere, there is no better framed Government under the Sun. Here is Monarchy without Slavery; a great King, and yet a free People. And, the Legislative-Power being lodged in the King, Lords, and Com∣mons joyntly, 'tis such a Monarchy as has the main Advantages of an Aristocracy in the Lords, and of a Democracy in the Commons, without the Disadvantages or Evils of either.</P>
<P>The Government of England being thus con∣stitued, I see no Ground there is for pas∣sive Obedience, where the Kings Commands are visibly contrary to Law, and destructive of the Constitution.</P>
<P>The Measures of Power, and consequently of Obedience, must be taken from the express Laws of the State, or from Immemorial Cu∣stoms, or from particular Oaths which the Sub∣jects swear to their Princes. And, in all Di∣sputes between Power and Liberty, Power must always be proved, for Liberty proves it self; that being founded only upon a Positive Law, this upon the Law of Nature.</P>
<P>Now 'tis plain, the Law of Nature has put no Difference (or Subordination) amongst Men, except it be that of Children to their Parents, or of Wives to their Husbands. So that, with relation to the Law of Nature, all Men are born Free; and this Liberty must be still supposed intire, unless so far as it is limit∣ed by Contracts, Provisions, and Laws.</P>
<P>And, as a private Person can bind himself to another Man by different Degrees, either as a common Servant for Wages, or as an Ap∣prentice
<PB N="81" REF="241"/>appropriate for a longer Time, or as a Slave by a total giving himself up to an∣other; so may several Bodies of Men give themselves upon different Terms and Degrees to the Conduct of others. And, as in those Cases the general Name of <HI>Master</HI> may be equally used, tho the degrees of his Power are to be judged by the nature of the Contract; so in these all may carry the same Name of <HI>King,</HI> and yet every ones Power is to be taken from the Measures of that Authority which is lodged in him, and not from any general Spe∣culations founded on some equivocal Terms, such as King, Sovereign, or Supream.</P>
<P>But this has been of late so learnedly argued, that I shall wave any further Discussion of this Matter. This only I shall add, that the King of England is, by the moderate Assertors of this Monarchy, called <HI>Pater Patriae,</HI> and <HI>Sponsus Regni.</HI> By which Metaphorical Characters the King and his Subjects come within the Relation of a Father and Children, or within that of a Husband and Wife; which is proper enough to represent the Nature and Mildness of the English Government. Others make King and Subject to be no other Relation than that of <HI>Gardian</HI> and <HI>Ward. Ad tutelam namque</HI> (says Fortescue) <HI>Legis Subditorum, ac eorum Corporum &amp; Bonorum, Rex hujusmodi erectus est;</HI> the King being ordained for the Defence or Gardianship of the Laws of his Subjects, and of their Bodies and Goods.</P>
<P>I have done, and now I proceed to a fur∣ther Description of this Monarchy. 'Tis Free and Independent, that is, not holden of any Earthly Potentate, or any ways obliged to do Homage for the same; as the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> holden of the Pope by the King of
<PB N="82" REF="242"/>Spain, and that of <HI>Scotlund</HI> which held <HI>in Ca∣pite</HI> of the Crown of England. Whereas the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> owns no Superiour upon Earth.</P>
<P>A Monarchy that justly challenges a Free∣dom from all Subjection to the Emperour, or Laws of the Empire. For, tho the Ro∣man Emperors were anciently possessed of this Country, and got by force of Arms the Posses∣sion of it; yet, upon their quitting the same, the Right (by the Law of Nations) returned to the former Owners <HI>pro Derelicto,</HI> as the Ci∣vilians speak.</P>
<P>The same is also free from all manner of Subjection to the Pope of Rome, and conse∣quently from those several Inconveniencies and Burdens which ly upon Popish Kingdoms. As Taxes paid to that Bishop, Provisions and Dispensations in several Cases to be procured from the Court of Rome, and Appeals thither in Ecclesiastical Suits.</P>
<P>'Tis an Hereditary Monarchy, and such as allow's of no <HI>Interregnum;</HI> free therefore from those Mischiefs and Inconveniencies which fre∣quently attend such Kingdoms as are Elective. Though it is granted, at least it seems appa∣rent by History, that England has been an E∣lective Kingdom, especially in the Time of the Saxons; When, upon the King's Death, those Persons of the Realm that composed the then Parliament assembled, in order to the chusing of another. And, tho one or other of the Royal Bloud was always chosen, yet the next in lineal Succession was often set aside, as is evident from the Genealogies of the Sax∣on Kings. But, however it was in those and after Times, certain it is that ever since King Henry VII. the Crown has run in a course
<PB N="83" REF="242"/>of lineal Succession by Right of Inheritance. Till the late King, having forsaken the Go∣vernment and abdicated the Kingdom, the Crown (with the general Consent of the Na∣tion) was set upon the Head of the Prince of Orange (our present King) joyntly with the Princess the next Heir to King James, and the Succession settled as will appear afterwards. And upon William and Mary, our Gracious King and Queen, may the Crown long flourish.</P>
<P>To conclude, whatever be the Bent and In∣clination of some Men amongst us for a Com∣monwealth, the Generality of the Nation is so much for Monarchy, that it is like so to continue as long as the World indures. In that Eclipse of Monarchy which hapned before the Restauration of King Charles II, how busy then the Commonwealth Party was to provide against its Return, and to settle here Democra∣cy for ever, all the World know's. No Stone was left unturned, and what came of it? As soon as ever Opportunity served, the very Presbyterians themselves joyned with the Royalists to bring in the exiled King, and re∣establish the ancient Government. So soon the Nation grew sick of the Commonwealth, and so strong was then the Current for Monar∣chy, that, without the shedding of a drop of Bloud, the first was in a manner hissed out of the Nation, and Monarchy restored with the greatest Pomp and Joy imaginable.</P>
<P>I set aside the Zeal of our English Clergy for Monarchy, and their Influence upon the Laity. The great Number alone of our Nobi∣lity and Gentry, with their proportionable As∣cendent upon the People, makes me look upon it as a moral Impossibility for Commonwealth-Government ever to prevail here. 'Tis well
<PB N="84" REF="243"/>known, the Genius of Commonwealths is for keeping down the Nobility, and extinguishing all those Beams of Royalty. Therefore as 'tis their Interest, so I suppose it will be their Care, to stick to Monarchy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the KING of</HI> ENGLAND. <HI>And first of his</HI> Dominions, Titles, Arms, <HI>his</HI> Ensigns <HI>of</HI> Royalty, <HI>and Marks of</HI> Sove∣reignty.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE King of <HI>England</HI> is otherwise cal∣led King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as being the sole Sovereign and supreme Head of this great and famous Island, containing the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland, be∣sides the Principality of Wales.</P>
<P>Which Principality was first united, by Con∣quest, to the Crown of England Anno 1282, by King Edward I. Who overcame and slew in Bat∣tel <HI>Llewellen,</HI> the last Sovereign Prince of Wales, of the Race of <HI>Cadwallader</HI> the last King of the Britains. After the Conquest thereof, he took all the provident Care imaginable to secure it to the Crown; but the Welsh seldom con∣tained themselves within the bounds of true Allegiance, till the Reign of Henry VII, who was extracted from the Welsh Bloud. In
<PB N="85" REF="243"/>whose Successor's Reign, Henry VIII, they were made by Act of Parliament one Nation with the English, subject to the same Laws, capable of the same Preferments, priviledged with the same Immunities, and inabled to send Knights and Burgesses to the English Parlia∣ment. So that the Name and Language only excepted, there is now no Difference be∣tween the English and Welsh. A very happy Union.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> was also brought into Subjection by the same King Edward; so that he received Homage of its King and Nobility, and had there his Chancery and other Courts under a Vice∣roy. But with much strugling they recovered at last their Liberty, and set up a King of their own, <HI>Robert Bruce;</HI> who had the luck to be confirmed in it by the Defeat given to Ed∣ward II, one of our unfortunate Kings. 'Tis true his Son King Edward III, a most virtu∣ous and valorous Prince, changed the face of Affairs in Scotland, and brought again the Scots to Obedience. Insomuch that he ex∣cluded David, the Son of <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> from the Crown, then forced to fly into France, and restored the House of <HI>Baliol</HI> to the King∣dom, in the person of <HI>Edward</HI> Son of King <HI>John Baliol.</HI> Who, upon his coming to the Crown, did Homage to this King Edward, as his Father had done to King Edward I. But 'twas not long before the Scots quitted again their Subjection and Vassalage to the Crown of England, the Roll of <HI>Ragman</HI> being trea∣cherously delivered into their hands by Roger Mortimer Earl of March. Which Roll con∣tained a Confession and Acknowledgement of the Estates of Scotland, subscribed by all their Hands and Seals; whereby they owned the
<PB N="86" REF="244"/>Superiority of the Kings of England, not only in regard of such Advantages as the Sword had given them, but as of their original and un∣doubted Right.</P>
<P>But, setting aside this point of Vassalage, the Kings of England are Kings of Scotland by a better Title. For King James VI of Scot∣land, and the first of England, succeeded Q. Elizabeth in the Realm of England, as the next Heir to the Crown, Anno 1602; being descended, by Mary Queen of the Scots his Mother, from Margaret, the eldest Daughter of Henry the VII. King of England, and Wife to James IV, of Scotland. And here the Wis∣dom and prudent Foresight of Henry is very remarkable. Who, having two Daughters, be∣stowed the Eldest (contrary to the Mind of his Council) on the King of Scots, and the younger on the French King; that, if his own Issue Male should fail, as it did by the Death of his Grandson King Edward VI, and that a Prince of another Nation must inherit England, then Scotland as the lesser Kingdom, should depend upon England, and not England wait on France, as upon the greater. In which Succession of the Scots to the Crown of England, the Prophecy of the fatal Stone received ac∣complishment. I mean the Stone which the Scots lookt upon as their <HI>Palladium,</HI> kept at <HI>Scone</HI> in Scotland, the usual Place for the Coronation of the Scotish Kings; upon which they received their Crown, till the Removal of it unto West∣minster by King Edward I. The Verses of old ingraven upon this Stone run thus,
<Q><L>Non fallat Fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum,</L>
<L>Invenient Lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</L></Q></P>
<PB N="87" REF="244"/>
<P>Translated in old Meeter thus.
<Q><L>The Scots shall brook that Realm as natif Ground,</L>
<L>If <HI>Weirds</HI> fail not, where ere this Stone is found.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus the Scots, so often quelled and curbed by the English, never subdued England but by this blessed Victory.</P>
<P>Ever since this happy Union, Scotland has been deprived of its Kings Residence there, who changed the worse Seat for the better. But under the King there is a chief Gover∣nour appointed by his Majesty, the <HI>Lord High Commissioner</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> who, by that Title, injoys the ordinary Power and Authority of a Viceroy. In this manner <HI>Scotland</HI> has con∣tinued to this day a separate Kingdom, governed by its own Laws. 'Tis true there have been several Attempts made to unite it into one Kingdom with England, as <HI>Wales</HI> was by Henry VIII. But hitherto they proved un∣succesfull.</P>
<P>So far we have cleared in few Words by Hi∣story the whole Isle of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to the King of England; with the numerous Islands about it, the principal of which are the Isles of <HI>Shepey, Thanet, Wight, Anglesey,</HI> and <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>The next that offers it self is the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> a great Part whereof was Con∣quered by the English about the Year 1172. in the Reign of Henry II, and the Occasion thus. Ireland being then divided amongst se∣veral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>petty Kings, the King of Leinster was by the King of Meath driven out of his Kindom.
<PB N="88" REF="245"/>He fled to England for Refuge; where, applying himself to King Henry, Henry resolved to at∣tempt his Restauration; which he did effectu∣ally, and in the doing of it, brought the best part of the Island under the English Subjection. King John, the Younger Son of Henry, was the first who was Intituled Lord of Ireland. Which Stile was granted him by Pope Urban III, and continued to his Successors (though in effect Kings thereof) till the Year 1542; when Henry VIII, was declared in an Irish Parliament King of Ireland, as a Name more sacred and re∣plete with Majesty. But the English never made a full and entire Conquest of that King∣dom till the latter end of Queen Elizabeths Reign, upon the great Defection of the Irish. Which ended in a total Overthrow of the Re∣bels, then under the Conduct of <HI>Hugh O Neal,</HI> Earl of <HI>Tiroen;</HI> and the consequence of it, ac∣cording to the Rule, That every Rebellion, when 'tis suppressed, does make the Prince stronger, and the Subjects weaker: Which I hope will be the effect of the present Rebellion in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>But, besides Great Britain and Ireland, the King of England is possessed of <HI>Jersey, Garn∣sey, Alderney,</HI> and <HI>Sark,</HI> four Islands of good note (especially the two first) on the Coast of Nor∣mandy in France. The same are holden in right of that Dukedom, which was Conquered by Henry I, of England, and continued English till the Days of King John; when Philip II, of France, surnamed Augustus, seized on all the Estates the English had in France, as Forfei∣tures, Anno 1202. And, since the French sei∣zed upon Normandy, they have often attemp∣ted <HI>Jersey,</HI> and <HI>Garnsey,</HI> but always with repulse and loss. So affectionate are the People to the
<PB N="89" REF="245"/>English Government, and jealous of the Privi∣ledges they injoy under it, which they could not hope for from the French.</P>
<P>In America the King of England is possessed of <HI>New-England, Virginia, Mary-Land, New York, Pensylvania, Carolina,</HI> and <HI>Hudsons-Bay.</HI> Besides many noted Islands, as <HI>New-found Land, Jamaica, Bermudos, Barbados;</HI> and, amongst the Lee∣ward Islands, <HI>Nevis, Antego, Montserat, Anguil∣la,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Asia he has the Isle of <HI>Bombay</HI> near Goa, which was Part of the present Queen Dowagers Portion; besides Conveniencies for Traffick in India, China, and the Levant. The same he has upon the Coast of Africk.</P>
<P>The King of England has a Claim besides to the <HI>Sovereignty of all the Seas</HI> round about Great Britain and Ireland, and all the Isles adjacent, even to the Shores of all the Neighbouring Na∣tions. Therefore all Foreiners Ships have an∣ciently demanded Leave to Fish, and to pass in these Seas; and to this day lower their Top-Sails to all the Kings Ships of War. Our Law faith, the Sea is of the Liegeance of the King, as well as the Land. And accordingly Children born upon our four Seas (as sometimes it does happen) are accounted natural born Subjects of the King of England, without being naturali∣zed.</P>
<P>The King of England has moreover a Title to the Kingdom of France. First Challenged by King Edward III, as Son and Heir of Isabel, the Daughter of King Philip the Fair, and Sister of Lewis IX, Philip V, and Charles the Fair, who reigned successively, and died without Issue Male. To prosecute which Title, he entred in∣to France with an Army, took upon him the Title of King of France, and caused the Flower
<PB N="90" REF="246"/>de luces to be quartered with the Lions of England; which has been continued ever since amongst all his Successors. The French (opposing his Title by virtue of a pretended Salique Law, disabling Women from the Succession to the Crown) he overthrew in two great Battels, with a small Force under the Conduct of the in∣comparable Edward the Black Prince his Son, Duke of Aquitain. Those were the <HI>Battels</HI> of <HI>Cressy</HI> and <HI>Poitiers,</HI> the first being fought Anno 1343, in the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> VI, surnamed <HI>de Valois,</HI> and that of Poitiers in the Reign of his Son King <HI>John,</HI> who was taken Prisoner with Philip his Son, and brought over into England. But such is the Vicissitude of Humane Affairs, that the English soon after lost all they had got in these Wars, <HI>Calais</HI> excepted. For Charles V, of France, the Son of John, proved too hard for Richard II, of England, one of our unfortu∣nate Kings, the next Successor of King Edward III, and his Grandson by Edward the Black Prince.</P>
<P>But Henry V, his next Successor but one, did so far pursue the Title of France, that he won it, after he had won the great Battle of <HI>Agin∣court,</HI> which happened Anno 1415. The Op∣portunity was great, whether we consider the Weakness and distracted Condition of Charles VI, then King of France, or the very Distraction of the Kingdom at that time occasioned by the Faction of Burgundy against that of Orleans. So that, being sought to for Peace, he granted it with these Conditions, that upon his Mar∣riage with the Lady Catharine, Daughter to King Charles, he should be made Regent of France, during Charles his Life, and after the Death of Charles, the Crown of France and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> its Rights should remain to King Henry and
<PB N="91" REF="246"/>his Heirs for ever; which was agreed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth sides. And, though Henry did not live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o possess the Kingdom, yet his Son Henry VI, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad the fortune to be Crowned King of France in Paris; which he held during the life of his Uncle John of Bedford, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Humfrey of Glo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ester. After whose Deaths he not only lost France to the French, but England and his Life to the Yorkish Faction.</P>
<P>Thus Charles VII, Son of Charles VI, after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long and bloody War, recovered from the English, then divided at Home, all their Pos∣sessions in France, except <HI>Calais.</HI> Which last remained under the English till Queen Maries Reign, and was taken from her by Henry II, of France. And ever since Things have remained much in the same Posture, the Kings of Eng∣land with the Title to France, and the French Kings with the Possession. Nay we have had two Kings of late so passionately inamoured with the present French King, that far from attempting to take the least Flower of his Crown from him, have promoted his Greatness, and encou∣raged his Rapines and unjust Usurpations. The Scope whereof at last appeared to be no less than the Inslaving this Nation, with the As∣sistance of France; and, far from raising the Glory of the English, to make them an Object of Scorn and Contempt to the World.</P>
<P>But now we are blest with a wise, just, and magnanimous King, three Vertues that have been long absent from the Throne of England, we may hope shortly to see France, if not Con∣quered again, at least so humbled and weaken∣ed, that it shall not be in her power to insult and incroach upon her Neighbours as she has in our Time, to the Ruin and Desolation of the best Part of Europe. 'Twas a notable (if
<PB N="92" REF="247"/>not Prophetick) Answer which an Englishman made to a French Officer; who, after the Eng∣lish had lost France, asked him in a scoffing manner, <HI>When they would return thither? Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Sins,</HI> says he <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re greater than ours.</HI> As ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as this Nation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been, 'tis apparent the French have far outdone us in their Pride and Lewdness, Cruelties and Usurpations. So that I hope, from the Disposition of the pre∣sent Affairs of Europe, the Time is come for France to give an Account thereof to God and Man.</P>
<P>I come now to the King of England's <HI>Titles,</HI> which run thus at present, joyntly with Queen Mary; <HI>William and Mary, by the Grace of God, King and Queen of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith.</HI> Which last Title was given by Pope Leo X, to King Hen∣ry VIII, for a Book written by him against Luther, in Defence of some Points of the Ro∣mish Religion; and afterwards confirmed by Act of Parliament, for Defence of the ancient Catholick and Apostolick Faith, as it is now professed by the Church of England. Where∣as the King of France is called <HI>Most Chri∣stian,</HI> and the King of Spain <HI>Most Catho∣lick.</HI></P>
<P>The Title of <HI>Majesty</HI> came not into use in England till the Reign of Henry VIII. Instead whereof the Title of <HI>Grace,</HI> now appropriated to the Dukes and the two Archbishops, was gi∣ven to former Kings; and that of Highness to the foresaid King <HI>Henry,</HI> till the Word <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI> prevailed.</P>
<P>When we speak to the King, the Word <HI>Sir</HI> is often used, besides <HI>Your Majesty;</HI> according
<PB N="93" REF="247"/>to the French <HI>Sire,</HI> which is likewise applied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that King.</P>
<P>For the King's <HI>Arms,</HI> or <HI>Ensigns Armorial,</HI> He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears in the first place, for the Regal Arms of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance, <HI>Azure,</HI> 3 <HI>Flower de luces Or;</HI> quarter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with the Arms of England, which are <HI>Gules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lions passant Gardant in pale Or.</HI> In the se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond place, for the Royal Arms of Scotland, <HI>a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion rampant Gules,</HI> within a double <HI>Tressure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unter flowred de luce Or.</HI> In the third place, or Ireland, <HI>Azure, an Irish Harp Or, stringed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgent.</HI> In the fourth place, as in the first.

<P>He has the Choice and Nomination of all Counsellours and Officers of State, of all the Judges, Bishops, and other high Dignities in the Church.</P>
<P>In short, the King is the Fountain of Ho∣nour, Justice, and Mercy. None but the King has the Sovereign Power in the Administration of Justice; and no Subject has here, as in France, <HI>Haute, Moyenne, &amp; basse Jurisdiction,</HI> that is, High, Mean, or Low Jurisdiction. So that the King only is Judge in his own Cause, though he deliver his Judgement by the Mouth of his Judges.</P>
<P>By Him is appointed the Metal, Weight, Purity, and Value of Coyn; and by his Pro∣clamation he may make any forein Coyn to be lawful Mony of England.</P>
<P>So tender is the Law for the Preservation of his Sacred Person, that, without any overt Act, the very Imagining or intending the Death of the King, is High Treason by Law. And, though by Law an Idiot or Lunatick, <HI>Non Com∣pos Mentis,</HI> cannot commit Felony, nor any sort of Treason; yet, if during his Idiocy or Luna∣cy, he shall Kill, or go about to Kill the King, he shall be punished as a Traytor.</P>
<P>In point of Physick, by an ancient Record, it is declared, That no Physick ought to be ad∣ministred to the King, without a Warrant signed by the Privy Council, by no other Physician but what is mentioned in the Warrant, and the Physicians to prepare it themselves with their own hands. If there be occasion for a
<PB N="96" REF="249"/>Surgeon, he must be likewise authorized by a Warrant.</P>
<P>And such is the Honour and Respect the King of England receives from his Subjects, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prince in Christendom receives more Homage Not only all Persons stand bare in his presence, but even in his absence, where he has a Chai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of State. All People at their first Address kneel to him, and he is at all times served up∣on the Knee.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the King of England is not free to act contrary to, or to dispense with the known esta∣blished Laws. Neither can he of himself re∣peal a Law, or make any new Law, without the Concurrence of both Houses of Parliament. A happy Impotency, both to King and People. For, whilst the King keeps within the Bounds of the Law, he can do no Wrong, and the People can receive no Harm.</P>
<P>Had the late King but acted accordingly, he might have been a most glorious Monarch, in∣stead of being now a general Object of Pity. Far from being necessitated to creep under the shelter of a Proud Monarch, he might have been a Curb to his Pride, and the Refuge of many Nations that suffered Fire and Sword, to advance what he called his Glory. Three Crowns at once are too great a Sacri∣fice, not to God, but to a Mercenary Crew of Priests and Jesuits. <HI>Tantum Religio potuit suadere Malorum.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Rank</HI> and <HI>Reputation</HI> of the Kings of England, when all Christendom in the Coun∣cil of <HI>Constance</HI> was divided into Nations, the English was one of the Principal, and not Sub∣altern, having its Voice of equal ballance with the Nations of France or Italy. In those Ge∣neral
<PB N="97" REF="249"/>Councils the Emperor of Germany was counted <HI>Major Filius Ecclesiae,</HI> the King of France <HI>Minor Filius,</HI> and the King of England <HI>Filius tertius &amp; adoptivus.</HI> Whereas, with sub∣mission, methinks it had been more proper, es∣pecially in such Assemblies, to look upon the King of England as <HI>Primogenitus Ecclesiae,</HI> the Eldest Son of the Church, out of respect to the British King <HI>Lucius,</HI> who (as I said before) was the first King in the World that imbraced Christianity. In those Councils, the King of France had place next the Emperour on his right hand, the King of England next on his left hand, and the King of Scotland next be∣fore Castille.</P>
<P>However the King of England acknowledges no Precedence to any Monarch, but only to the Emperour, and that upon the Score of An∣tiquity. For the Crown of England is free and independent, and therefore has been declared in Parliaments long since to be an Imperial Crown.</P>

<P>THE Kings of <HI>England</HI> are both Pro∣claimed and Crowned with so much Solemnity, that it won't be impro∣per to describe the Manner of it, it being a Solemnity not at all disagreeable to the Design of this Work.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>Proclamation,</HI> which is the first Step to the Crown. And, being we are upon the New State of <HI>England,</HI> I shall de∣scribe the Manner how the present King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> were Proclaimed at <HI>White∣hall-Gate,</HI> within <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> in <HI>Cheap-side<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and the <HI>Royal Exchange.</HI> Which happened o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the 13th of Febr.

<PB N="99" REF="250"/>
<P>About 11 of the Clock, the said Lords and Commons came down to <HI>Whitehall Gate,</HI> preced∣ed by the Speakers of their respective Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> viz. the Marquess of <HI>Hallifax</HI> Speaker <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Lords, and <HI>Henry Powle</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Speaker of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>mons, each of them attended by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Arms, in order to see Their Majesties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>Being come down to the <HI>Gate,</HI> there they found the Heralds of Arms, the Sergeants at Arms, the Trumpets, and other Officers, all in readiness, being assembled by Order from the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England. And Sr. <HI>Thomas</HI> S. <HI>George</HI> Knight Garter, Principal King of Arms, having received a Proclamation in Writing, with an Order from the Lords House to the King's Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms for Publishing or Pro∣claiming the same forthwith, the Persons con∣cerned disposed themselves in Order before the Court-Gate, for making the said Procla∣mation. The Trumpets having sounded a Call three several times, the last of which was answered by a great Shout of the vast Mul∣titudes of People there assembled, the Noise ceasing, the said Garter King of Arms read the' Proclaimation by short Sentences or Pe∣riods; Which was thereupon proclaimed aloud by <HI>Robert Devenish</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> York Herald, being the Senior Herald, in these Words.</P>

<P>In this Order they proceeded towards <HI>Temple-Bar.</HI> And, being come as far as the May-pole in the Strand, two of the Officers of Arms, with a Sergeant at Arms, and two Trumpets, went before to <HI>Temple-Bar;</HI> where the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs were by this time arrived, and had ordered the Gates to be shut.

<P>Thus the Head-Bayliff, Constables, and Beadles of Westminster being left without the Bar, the rest of the Proceeding entered Where they found the Lord Mayor, Alder∣men, Recorder, and Sheriffs, all in their For∣malities, and on Horse-back; Except the Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mayor, who was in his Coach, attended by the Sword-bearer; and other of his Officers The Proceeding being there joyfully received they made a Stand between the two Temple-Gates,

<P>From whence they marched towards <HI>Cheap∣side,</HI> a Class of the City-Trumpets, and the Lord Mayor's Livery-men leading the Way, the said Aldermen and Lord Mayor falling into the Proceeding. And near Wood-street end (the Place where Cheap-side Cross former∣ly stood) they made another stand, and Pro∣claimed Their Majesties a third time.</P>
<P>At last arriving at the <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> about two of the Clock, they Proclaimed Them a fourth time.</P>
<P>Each Proclamation was ecchoed with univer∣sal Acclamations of Joy by the Multitudes of people which crowded the Streets, Windows, and Balconies; the Streets all the way from Temple-Bar to the Royal Exchange being lined with four Regiments of the City Militia.

<PB N="107" REF="254"/>with Their Majesties Horse and Foot-Gards, all the Way and Houses on each side being Crowded with vast Number of Spectators, ex∣pressing their great Joy and Satisfaction by loud repeated Acclamations.</P>
<P>Being entred the Church, and the Nobility and others all duly placed, Their Majesties as∣cended the Theater. Who being seated in their Chairs of State, the Bishop of London, who performed this great Solemnity, began with the Recognition, which ended with a mighty Shout. Then Their Majesties Offered, and the Lords who bore the Regalia presented them at the Altar, where they were depo∣sited.</P>
<P>After that, the Litany was sung by two Bi∣shops. And after the Epistle, Gospel, and Nicene Creed, the Bishop of Salisbury began the Sermon, his Text being taken out of 2 Sam. 23. V. 3 &amp; 4.</P>
<P>The Sermon ended, Their Majesties took the Oath. And, being conducted to their Regal Chairs placed on the Theater, that they might be more conspicuous to the Members of the House of Commons who were seated in the North-Cross, They were Anointed. After the Unction they were presented with the Spurs and Sword, invested with the Palls and Orbs, and then with the Rings and Scepters. At four of the Clock the Crowns were put upon their Heads; at sight whereof all the People shouted, the Drums and Trumpets sounded, the great Guns were discharged, and the Peers and Peeresses put on their Co∣ronets.</P>
<P>Then the Bible was presented to Their Ma∣jesties; and, after the Benediction. They vouchsafed to kiss the Bishops. Being In∣throned,
<PB N="108" REF="255"/>first the Bishops, and then the Tem∣poral Lords did their Homage, and Kissed Their Majesties left Cheeks. In the mean while the Treasurer of the Houshold threw about the Coronation Medals; which were of Silver, about the bigness of a half-crown Piece, representing of one side the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen,</HI> with their Names thus, <HI>Gulielmus &amp; Maria Rex &amp; Regina.</HI> And, on the Reverse, giddy-brained <HI>Phaethon,</HI> unskilfully guiding the Cha∣riot of the Sun; with <HI>Jupiter</HI> above striking him with a Thunder-bolt; and this <HI>Motto</HI> about it, <HI>Ne Totus Absumatur,</HI> that is, Lest the whole World be Consumed with fire. A very pat Emblem to the present Juncture, as those may best judge who are well acquainted with the Story of <HI>Phaethon.</HI></P>
<P>Next, followed the Communion. And Their Majesties, having made Their second Oblation, received the holy Sacrament. Then the Bi∣shop read the final Prayers. After Prayers, Their Majesties retired into S. Edward's Cha∣pel, where they were new Arrayed in Purple Velvet. And in this Habit they returned to Westminster-Hall, with Their rich Crowns of State upon their Heads, and the Nobility their Coronets.</P>
<P>A splendid Dinner being prepared in the Hall for Their Majesties, and the whole Proceed∣ing, the first Course for Their Majesties Table was served up with the proper Ceremony, being preceded by the great Officers, and the High Constable, High Steward, and Earl Mar∣shal.

<PB N="110" REF="256"/>Strays, and Wracks, not granted away by Him or any of his Predecessors; All Treasure found, as Gold, Silver, Plate, Bullion, &amp;c. the Owner whereof is unknown; All Royal Fishes, as Whales, Dolphins, &amp;c. And Royal Fowl, as Swans not markt, and swimming at liberty on the River.</P>
<P>The King, by his Prerogative, has the Right of Pre-emption of all Sorts of Victuals near the Court; and may take Horses, Carts, Ships, and Boats, for his Carriages, at reason∣able Rates.</P>
<P>By his Letters Patent he may erect new Counties, Cities, Boroughs, Universities, Col∣ledges, Schools, Hospitals, Fairs, Markets, Forests, Chases, Free-Warrens, &amp;c. And, without his Authority, no Forest, Chase, or Park can be made, or Castle built.</P>
<P>He has Power likewise to Infranchise an A∣lien, and make him a Denison, whereby he is inabled to purchase Houses and Lands, and to bear some Offices. But none can be Natura∣lized but by King and Parliament.</P>
<P>The King only can give Letters of Mart or Reprisal. And, in case of Losses by Fire or otherwise, He only can give Patents to receive the charitable Benevolences of the People, without which no Man may ask it publickly.</P>
<P>Debts due to the King are in the first place to be satisfied, in case of Executorship and Administratorship; and, till the Kings Debts be satisfied, He may protect the Debtor from the Arrest of other Creditors.</P>
<P>He may Distrein for the whole Rent upon one Tenant, tho he do not hold the whole Land; Is not obliged to demand his Rent, as others are; and may sue in what Court he pleases, and Distrain where he list.</P>
<PB N="111" REF="256"/>
<P>No Occupancy can stand good against the King, nor any Entry before Him prejudice him. And the Sale of the Kings Goods in open Market do's not take away his Property therein.</P>
<P>All Receivers of Mony for the King, or Ac∣comptants to Him for any Branch of his Re∣venues, are chargeable for the same at all times, in their Persons, Lands, Goods, Heirs, Executors, and Administrators.</P>
<P>And, when any Debtor to the King is dis∣abled to pay him, by reason of Debts owing him which he has not been able to recover, in such a Case the Kings Debtor being Plaintiff has some Priviledges above others, by virtue of a <HI>Quo minus</HI> in the Exchequer.</P>
<P>In Doubtfull Cases, always there ought to be a particular Regard and favourable Presum∣ption for the King. And Judgments against the King's Title are always entred with a <HI>Salvo Jure Domini Regis;</HI> That if at any time the King's Council at Law can make out his Title better, that Judgment shall not prejudice Him. Which is not so for a Subject.</P>
<P>The King's Servants in Ordinary are free from Arrest; also, from all Offices that re∣quire their Attendance, as Sheriff, Constable, Church-Warden, &amp;c. And, for reasonable Causes Him thereunto moving, He may pro∣tect any Man against Suits at Law, &amp;c. with a <HI>Noli Prosequi.</HI></P>
<P>As to Church Matters, the King by Act of Parliament is the Supream Head of the Church, as He is of the State; and is lookt upon as her Gardian, and Nursing Father.</P>
<P>He is (as Constantine the Emperor said of himself) an external Bishop of the Church, and in some Sense a Priest aswell as a King. Therefore at his Coronation He is Anointed
<PB N="112" REF="257"/>with Oyl, as the Priests were at first, and after∣wards the Kings of Israel, to intimate that his Person is Sacred and Spiritual; and has the <HI>Dalmatica,</HI> and other Priestly Vests, put upon Him.</P>
<P>By virtue of his Prerogative, He has Power to call a National or Provincial Synod; and to make such Alterations in the Church-Dis∣cipline as they shall judge expedient.</P>
<P>And, as He is the Lord Paramount, or Su∣pream Landlord, of all the Lands in England; so He has all over England the Supream Right of Patronage, called Patronage Paramount. Insomuch that, if the mean Patron, or the Ordinary, or the Metropolitan, present not in due time, the Right of Presentation comes at at last to the King.</P>
<P>As for the Bishopricks, the King only has the Patronage of them. For none can be chosen Bishop, but whom he nominates in his <HI>Conge d'Estire;</HI> and a Bishop Elect cannot be Consecrated, or take possession of the Re∣venues of the Bishoprick, without the King's special Writ or Assent.</P>
<P>In short, as the King is the only Sovereign and Supream Head both in Church and State, so there lies no Appeal from Him, as from some other States and Kingdoms beyond Sea, either to the Pope of Rome, or to the Emperor.</P>
<P>But indeed the greatest and safest of the Kings Prerogatives is, as the present King wrote in a late Letter to his Council of Scot∣land, to Rule according to Law, and with Mo∣deration.</P>
<P>The Dispensing Power, so much contended for in the late Reign by the Court-Party as a Branch of the Kings Prerogative, and as vi∣gorously opposed by some true Patriots, is
<PB N="113" REF="257"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow quite out of Doors by the Act of Settle∣ment, which makes it plainly Illegal.</P>
<P>And, as to that divine Prerogative which the Kings of England claimed as a Thing <HI>de Jure divino,</HI> I mean the Curing of the <HI>King's Evil,</HI> only by the King's laying his hands on the Sick, assisted with a short Form of Divine Service, it is now laid aside, as a Traditional Errour, at least a Doctrine not fit to be trusted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o. So that the French King is at this time the only Monarch that pretends to this Mira∣culous Priviledge. Our Historians derived it here from King Edward the Confessour, who lived so holy a Life, that (as they say) he re∣ceived Power from above, Intailed to his Royal Successors for ever, to cure this stubborn Dis∣ease. But now 'cis lookt upon as a Doctrine not so fit for Protestants as bigotted Papists, to whom no Miracle is amiss.</P>
<P>I come now to the King's <HI>Power,</HI> with rela∣tion to forein Parts; Which I shall describe as near as I can, first as Defensive, secondly as Offensive.</P>
<P>In the first Sense, <HI>England,</HI> if well united, is of all the States in Europe the least subject to an Invasion, especially since the Conjunction of Scotland. The whole Island is naturally so well senced with the Ocean, and (when Occasion requires) so well garded by those moving Castles, the King's Ships of War, the strongest and best built in the whole World. The Kingdom be∣sides is so abundantly furnished with Men and Horses, with Provisions and Ammunition, and Mony the Sinews of War, that nothing but our intestine Divisions can make us a Prey to the greatest Potentates of Europe, tho uni∣ted together.</P>
<PB N="114" REF="258"/>
<P>As for the King's Power abroad, not only our Neighbours, but the most remote Places, have sufficiently felt it, and this at a time when Scotland and Ireland were usually at enmity with Him. 'Tis true, since the Reign of Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Elizabeth, what with our Distractions at home, and the Weakness or Effeminacy of some of one Kings, <HI>England</HI> has either been Idle, or taken up with Intestine Broils. Only, in Cromwel's Time, we humbled the Hollanders, scowred the Al∣gerines, kept the French and the Pope in aw, and took Jamaica from Spain. Our greatest Exploits were upon our own selves, when, be∣ing unhappily involved in Civil Wars for se∣veral Years together, we destroy'd one an∣other with a fatal Courage. Then were com∣puted about two hundred thousand Foot, and fifty thousand Horse, to be in Arms on both, sides; which, had they been imploy'd abroad, might have shaken the greatest part of Europe. And here I cannot but with an aking heart apply the Words of <HI>Lucan,</HI>
<Q><L>Heu! quantum potuit Coeli Pelagique parari</L>
<L>Hoc quem Civiles fuderunt Sanguine Dextrae!</L></Q></P>
<P>In English thus,
<Q><L>How much both Sea and Land might have been gained</L>
<L>By their dear Bloud, which Civil Wars have drained?</L></Q></P>
<P>Of so martial Spirit the English are, and their fear of Death so little, that (as Dr. <HI>Cham∣berlain</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="258"/>has well observed) no Neighbour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation scarce durst ever abide Battle with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, either by Sea or Land, upon equal Terms. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd now we are ingaged in a just War both with Ireland and France, under a Prince of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o great Conduct and Courage, incouraged by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Parliament, assisted and faithfully served by the greatest General now in Europe, I cannot but hope well from our Armies both by Seu and Land, if our provoked God do not fight against us.</P>
<P>The next Thing that offers it self to our Con∣sideration, is the King of England's <HI>Court,</HI> which for State, Greatness, and good Order, besides the constant Concourse of Nobility and Gentry resorting thither, when there is no Jealousy be∣tween the King and his People, is one of the chief Courts of Europe. It is, as an Author says, a Monarchy within a Monarchy, consist∣ing of Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Military Per∣sons, the two last under their proper Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>To support the Grandure of this Court, and the other Charges of the Crown in time of Peace, the Kings of England have always had competent <HI>Revenues.</HI> Which never were raised by any of those sordid Ways used in other Countries; but consist chiefly in Domains or Lands belonging to the Crown, in Customs, and Excise.</P>
<P>Anciently the very Domains of the Crown, and Fee-Farm Rents, were so considerable, that they were almost sufficient to discharge all the ordinary Expences of the Crown, without any Tax or Impost upon the Subject. Then there was scarce a County in England but the King
<PB N="116" REF="259"/>had in it a Royal Castle, a Forest, and a Park, to Receive and Divert Him in his Royal Pro∣gresses. A piece of Grandure, which no King else could boast of. But, upon the Restaura∣tion of King Charles, the Crown Revenues be∣ing found much Impaired, and the Crown Char∣ges increasing upon the growing Greatness of our Neighbours the French and Dutch, the Parliament settled upon the King a Yearly Re∣venue of Twelve Hundred Thousand Pounds, by several Imposts; besides the Domains and other Profits arising to the Crown in Tenths and First-Fruits, in Reliefs, Fines, Amercia∣ments, and Confiscations. And the whole Re∣venue improved to that degree, that in the late Reign it was judged to amount to near two Millions. Which is a Fair Revenue in Time of Peace.</P>
<P>In Time of War, the Parliament supplies the King, according to his Occasions, by such Taxes to be raised upon the Nation as they think most convenient.</P>

<PB N="117" REF="259"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Government of</HI> England <HI>by Regency; Also, of the Succession to the Crown.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THere are three Cases, wherein the King∣dom of England is not immediately governed by the King, but by a Sub∣stitute Regent. And those are the Kings Minori∣ty, Absence, or Incapacity.</P>
<P>The King is by Law under Age, when he is under twelve Years old. And, till he has at∣tained to that Age, the Kingdom is governed by a <HI>Regent, Protector,</HI> or <HI>Gardian,</HI> appointed ei∣ther by the King his Predecessor, or (for want of such Appointment,) by the Three States as∣sembled in the Name of the Infant King. Who, in such Case, usually make choice of such a Person among the Nobility, as is fit for that Station, whose private Interest is to preserve the Kings Life and Authority, and to whom least benefit can accrue by his Death or Dimi∣nution.</P>
<P>Thus, in the Case of Edward VI, the Duke of Somerset, his Uncle by the Mothers side, was made Lord Protector during the Kings Mi∣nority. And, when this Rule has not been ob∣served, as in the Minority of Edward V, it has proved of very ill consequence.</P>
<PB N="118" REF="260"/>
<P>But this is observable withall, that when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King comes to be 24 Years of Age, he may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Letters Patents under the Great Seal (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cording to a Statute made in the Reign of <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ry</HI> VIII,) revoke and utterly null whatsoeve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has been Enacted in Parliament during his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nority.</P>
<P>When the King was Absent upon any so reign Expedition (as several of our Kings have been with good success,) the Custom was for merly to constitute a Vicegerent, by Com¦mission under the Great Seal, with the Tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Lord Warden</HI> (or <HI>Lord Keeper</HI>) of the King¦dom, and sometimes that of <HI>Protector.</HI> And such was the Latitude of his Power, that, ex∣cept wearing of the Crown, he was as great a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King. But sometimes the Kingdom, durin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King's Absence, has been committed to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Care of several Noblemen.</P>
<P>During the Absence of Henry VIII, in France which hapned two several times, the Quee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was made <HI>Regent.</HI> And so is at this time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Gracious Queen Mary, during his Majesties so reign Expedition.</P>
<P>So, in case of the Kings Incapacity to go∣vern, either through Age, or Weakness, or by reason of some Incurable Disease, a <HI>Gardian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Regent</HI> is constituted to govern the Kingdom for Him. Such a one was John Duke of L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> caster, in the latter Days of King Edward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appointed by the King himself; who then what with Age and Weakness, what with Sick∣ness and Grief for the untimely Death of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dear Son the Black Prince, was much decay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both in Body and Mind.</P>
<P>I come now to the <HI>Succession to the Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Which is not in England as in France, Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="119" REF="260"/>and amongst Barbarians, by excluding Females from the Crown. For the Crown of England, in its natural Course, descends from Father to S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, for want of Sons to the eldest Daughter, and her Heirs; for want of Daughter, to the Brother and his Heirs; for want of Brother, to the Sister and her Heirs.</P>
<P>In short, upon the Death of the King or Queen upon the Throne, the next of Kindred (though born out of the Dominions of Eng∣land, or of Parents not Subjects of England) is immediately King or Queen, before any Pro∣clamation, or Coronation. And, contrary to the Descent of Estates among Subjects, the Half Blood inherits; as in the Case of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, who succeeded King Ed∣ward the Sixth, though they were his Sisters only by the Father's side.</P>
<P>But the Government being lately Dissolved by King James his Misgovernment as well as Abdication, the Crown was settled in this man∣ner by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons assembled at Westminster in the Month of December, Anno 1689. First upon William and Mary, then Prince and Princess of Orange, during their Lives, and the Life of the Survivor of Them; but the sole and full Exercise of the Regal Power to be only in, and executed by the said Prince of Orange, in the Names of the said Prince and Princess, during their joynt Lives. And, after their Deceases, the said Crown and Royal Dignity to be to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eirs of the Body of the said Princess. And, for default of such Issue, to the Princess Anne of Denmark, and the Heirs of her Body. And, for default of such Issue, to the Heirs of the Body of the said Prince of Orange. Upon which the said Prince and Princess (now King
<PB N="120" REF="261"/>and Queen of England, &amp;c.) did accept th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Crown and Royal Dignity of the Kingdoms o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> England, France, and Ireland, and the Domi∣nions thereunto belonging.</P>
<P>And, for preventing all Questions and Divi∣sions in this Realm, by reason of any preten∣ded Titles to the Crown, and for preserving a Certainty in the Succession thereof, the Settle∣ment of the Crown (as aforesaid) was Confirm∣ed by an Act of the Insuing Parliament, which passed the Royal Assent, Dec 16. 1689. With this excellent Proviso, That, Whereas it hath been found by Experience, that it is Incon∣sistent with the Safety and Welfare of this Pro∣testant Kingdom, to be Governed by a Popis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prince, or by any King or Queen Marrying Papist, all and every Person and Persons tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is, are, or shall be Reconciled to, or shall hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Communion with the See or Church of <HI>Rome</HI> or shall profess the Popish Religion, or shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Marry a Papist, shall be Excluded, and be so∣ever Uncapable to Inherit, Possess, or Injoy th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Crown and Government of this Realm and Ireland, and the Dominions thereunto belon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing, or any Part of the same, or to Have, Us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Exercise any Regal Power, Authority, or J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣risdiction within the same; And, in all and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very such Case or Cases, the People of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Realms shall be, and are hereby Absolved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Allegiance; and the said Crown and Go∣vernment shall from time to time Descend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and be Injoy'd by such Person or Persons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ing Protestants, as should have Inherit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or Injoyed the same, in case the said P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣son or Persons, so Reconciled, holding Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣munion, or Professing, or Marrying, as afo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣said, were naturally Dead.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Royal Family; Particularly of the Queen, and the Sons and Daughters of England.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is either a Sove∣reign, or Queen Consort, or else Queen Dowager.</P>
<P>When the Queen is Sovereign, as were Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, (the two Daugh∣ters of Henry VIII, and Sisters of Edward VI.) he is invested with all the Regal Power, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts as Sovereign. And whoever she does marry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, far from following her Husbands Condition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he is her Husbands Sovereign, as Queen Mary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as Philip's.</P>
<P>The Case indeed of our present Queen Mary is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifferent. She is a Sovereign, joyntly with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usband King William; but the Administration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Government, and the sole Executive Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lodged only in the King during their Joynt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ves. Except the Time of his Majesties Absence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his foreign Expedition; during which, Her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jesty is Vested by a late Act of Parliament
<PB N="122" REF="262"/>with the Administration, and acts as Queen Re∣gent.</P>
<P>A Queen Consort, without Sovereignty, is Reputed however the Second Person in the Kingdom, and Respected accordingly. The Law sets so high a value upon Her, as to make it High Treason to conspire her Death, or to violate her Chastity. She has her Royal Court, and Officers apart; with a large Dower to main∣tain her Greatness. And, though she be an A∣lien born, yet without Denization or Naturali∣zation, she may purchase Lands in Fee-simple, make Leases and Grants, and sue in her own Name, without the King; which is not in the power of any other <HI>Feme-covert</HI> (or married Woman) to do.</P>
<P>A Queen Dowager or Widow-Queen, is still Respected as a Queen in her Widowhood, and keeps a Court accordingly. And, though she should marry a private Gentleman (as did Queen Catharine, King Henry the Fifths Widow,) she does not lose her Dignity.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Daughters</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> I mean the King's Children. So called, because all the Subjects of England have a special Interest i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Them; though their Education, and the Dis∣posing of Them, is only in the King.</P>
<P>The Eldest Son, commonly called the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> is born Duke of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and after∣wards created Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> Upon his Birth he is by Law of full Age to sue for the Livery of the said Dukedom, as if he were full a Years of Age. But so much of the Lands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Demesns of it have been Alienated, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Revenues are chiefly out of the Tin-Mines i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cornwall. Which, with all other Profits of the Dutchy, amount yearly to the Sum of 140<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="123" REF="262"/>Pounds; and the Prince's whole Revenues, to about 20000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>When King Edward I, had compleated the Conquest of <HI>Wales,</HI> He divided it into Seven Shires, to which Henry VIII, added five more out of the March Lands. Over each of the Se∣ven Shires King Edward placed a particular English Lieutenant, and over the whole he de∣signed a Vicegerent. The <HI>Welch</HI> being disgusted at this, He sent for his Queen, then great with Child, to <HI>Caernarvan,</HI> where she was delivered of a Son. Upon the News whereof, the King assembled the Chief Men of that Nation, and offered to name them a Governour born in <HI>Wales,</HI> who could not speak one word of En∣glish, and against whose Life they could take no just exception. Such a one when they had all sworn to obey, he named his young Son Edward. Whereupon He created him Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and since that time, the Kings of England el∣dest Sons have been called Princes of <HI>Wales.</HI> Whereas, while Normandy was in the Power of the English, which lasted till the Reign of King John, they were stiled Dukes of Nor∣mandy.</P>
<P>The Investiture is performed by the Imposi∣tion of a Cap of Estate, and a Coronet on the Princes Head, as a Token of his Principality; by delivering into his hand a Verge of Gold, the Emblem of Government; by putting a Gold Ring on his Finger, in token that he must be a Husband to his Country, and a Father to her Children; and by giving him a Patent, to hold the said Principality to Him and his Heirs Kings of England. By which Words the Se∣paration of it from the Crown is prohibited, and the King keeps to himself an excellent Oc∣casion
<PB N="124" REF="263"/>of obliging unto Him his Son, when he pleases.</P>
<P>In Imitation of which Custom, John I, King of Castille and Leon, made his Son Henry Prince of the <HI>Asturias;</HI> a Country so Craggy and Mountainous, that it may not improperly be called the <HI>Wales</HI> of Spain. And all the Spanish Princes ever since have been honoured with that Title.</P>
<P>The Mantle worn in Parliament by the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> has (for Distinctions sake) one gard more than a Duke's; his Coronet, of Crosses and Flower de luces, and his Cap of State in∣dented.</P>
<P>His Arms differ from the Kings, only by ad∣dition of a Label of three points. And his pe∣culiar Device is a Coronet beautified with three Ostrich Feathers, inscribed with ICH DIEN, that is, I serve; Alluding perhaps to that in the Gospel, <HI>The Heir, while he is a Child, dif∣fers not from a Servant.</HI> Which Device was born at the Battel of <HI>Cressy</HI> by John King of Bohe∣mia, serving there under the French King, and there slain by Edward the Black Prince. Since worn by the Princes of Wales, and by the Vulgar called the Princes Arms.</P>
<P>In short, the King of England's Eldest Son has ever since been stiled Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> Duke of <HI>Aquitain</HI> and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Flint;</HI> these Earldoms being conferred up∣on him by Letters Patent. As Eldest Son to the King of Scotland, he is Duke of <HI>Rothsay,</HI> and Seneschal of <HI>Scotland</HI> from his Birth.</P>
<P>Though he is a Subject, yet the Law looks upon his Person as so Sacred, that it is high Treason to imagine his Death, or violate his Wife.</P>
<PB N="125" REF="263"/>
<P>The <HI>Younger Sons</HI> of <HI>England</HI> depend altoge∣ther upon the King's Favour, both for Titles, of Honour, and Revenues sutable to their Birch. For they are not born Dukes, or Earls; but are so created, according to the Kings Pleasure. Nei∣ther have they, as in France, certain <HI>Appana∣ges;</HI> but only what Revenue the King pleases to bestow upon them.</P>
<P>They are indeed by Birth-right, as well as the Prince of Wales, Counsellors of State, where∣by they may fit themselves to manage the weighty Affairs of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Daughters</HI> are called Princesses. And, to violate them unmarried is High Treason.</P>
<P>The Title of Royal Highness is common to all the King's Children. All Subjects ought to be uncovered in their Presence, to kneel when they are admitted to kiss their hands, and to be served on the Knee at Table, unless the King be present.</P>
<P>Lastly, all Persons of the Royal Bloud, be∣ing a Lawful Issue, have the Precedency of all others in England.</P>
<P>As for the King's Natural (or Illegitimate) Sons and Daughters, they are commonly crea∣ted Dukes and Dutchesses; and bear what Sur∣name the King pleases to give them. King Henry I. and Charles II. <HI>of blessed Memory,</HI> are noted to have had the most of any.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Nine Great Officers of the Crown.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEXT to the Royal Family, the Great Officers of the Crown come of course to be Inquired into, which are Nine in Num∣ber.</P>
<P>Viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>High Steward,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>High Chancellor,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>High Treasurer,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>President</HI> of the Kings Council.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>Privy Seal,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>Great Chamberlain,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>High Constable,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>Earl Marshal,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>High Admiral.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Lord <HI>High Steward</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is the highest Officer under the King. His Office not unlike that of the <HI>Mayre of the Pallace</HI> under the ancient Kings of France, is to rule and govern the Kingdom under the King, in Time of Peace and War, during his Reign, Which Power being thought too large and exorbitant for a Subject to have, this Great Officer has been discontinned ever since <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bullingbrock,</HI> Son to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, afterwards King of England under the Name of Henry IV. Only at a Co∣ronation, also for the Trial of a Peer or Peeress for Treason or Felony, or some other great Crime, the King makes a High Steward for
<PB N="127" REF="264"/>that Time. Who, during his Stewardship, is called <HI>His Grace;</HI> and bears a <HI>white Staff</HI> in his hand, which he openly breaks when the Business is over, and so ends his Of∣fice.</P>
<P>By virtue of his Office at a Coronation, he sits Judicially at the King's Pallace at West∣minster. Where he receives the Bills and Petiti∣ons of all such Noblemen and others, who (by reason of their Tenure, or otherwise) claim to do Services at the King's Coronation, and to receive the accustomed Fees and Allowances. In the Procession on the Coronation-Day, 'tis he that carries the King's Crown. The Right Honourable the Earl of Devonshire was ho∣noured with this great Office in the last Coro∣nation.</P>
<P>Upon the Trial of a Peer he sits under a Cloth of State, and his Commission is to pro∣ceed <HI>secundum Legem &amp; Consuetudinem Angliae.</HI> He is not Sworn, nor the Lords who are the Tryers of the Peer arraigned; and, tho he call all the Judges of the Land to assist him; yet he is the sole Judge.</P>
<P>Next to the Lord High Steward is the <HI>Lord High Chancellour,</HI> who in Civil Affairs (now there is no High Steward) is the highest Per∣son in the Kingdom next to the Royal Family, as the Arch-bishop of Canterbury is in Eccle∣siastical.</P>
<P>His Oath is to do Right to all manner of People, rich and poor, after the Laws and Customs of the Realm, truly to counsel the King, and keep secret the King's Counsel, to stand for the Rights of the Crown, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="128" REF="265"/>
<P>The Great Seal of England is in his Cu∣stody. He is the Judge of the Court of Chan∣cery, otherwise called the Court of Equity; where he is to judge, not according to the Rigour and Letter of the Law, but with Equi∣ty and Conscience. He also bestow's all Ec∣clesiastical Benefices in the King's Gift under 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year in the King's Books.</P>
<P>Since the Reign of Henry VII. this great Office has been commonly executed by Lawyers; whereas formerly Bishops, and other Clergy∣men learned in the Civil Laws, were usually intrusted with it.</P>
<P>The Lord High Chancellour holds his Place but <HI>durante Regis Beneplacito,</HI> during the King's Pleasure. And his Place is counted to be worth 8000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year.</P>
<P>Anciently he had sometimes a Vice-Chan∣cellour, commonly called Keeper of the Great Seal. But of later Times they differ only in Name. For the late Kings have always be∣flowed the Great Seal, either with the Title of Lord Keeper, or of Lord Chancellour; but still with the same Power, and Right of Pre∣cedence. Only the Lord Chancellour re∣ceives a Patent from the King for his Office, which the Lord Keeper do's not; and by the Title of Chancellour he is lookt upon as in greater favour with the King.</P>
<P>But his present Majesty, since his Accession to the Crown, thought fit to have this Office managed by Commissioners; and accordingly it has been hitherto managed by <HI>three Lords Commissioners.</HI></P>
<P>The third Great Officer of the Crown is the <HI>Lord High Treasurer,</HI> who has the Charge and
<PB N="129" REF="265"/>Government of all the King's Revenue kept in the Exchequer.</P>
<P>He has the Gift of all Customers, Comptro∣lers, and Searchers in all the Ports of Eng∣land; and the Nomination of all Escheators in every County. He has also the Check of all the Officers imploy'd in collecting all the Re∣venues of the Crown. He has power either by himself, or with others joyned in Commis∣sion with him, to let Leases of all the Crown-Lands. And it is he that gives Warrants to certain Persons of Quality, to have their Wine Custom-free.</P>
<P>Anciently he received this Office and Dig∣nity by the delivery of the golden Keys of the Treasury, which is now done by deli∣very of a white Staff to him by the King.</P>
<P>His Oath do's not differ much from that of the Lord Chancellour; and he holds his Place, as he do's, during his Majesties Pleasure. His Place is also reckoned to be worth 8000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per ann.</HI></P>
<P>But this great Office is now executed by four Persons, called the <HI>Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.</HI></P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Lord President of the King's Privy Council,</HI> an Officer as ancient as King John's Time, made by the King's Letters Patent under the Great Seal, <HI>durante Beneplacito.</HI> His Office is to manage the Debates in Council, to pro∣pose Matters from the King, and report the Transactions to his Majesty.</P>
<P>In the late Reigns this Office was often sup∣plied by the Chancellour.</P>
<P>Next to the Lord President is the <HI>Lord Privy Seal,</HI> whose Office is of great Trust and Skill. He is so called from the Privy Seal,
<PB N="130" REF="266"/>which is in his custody. All Charters and Grants of the King, and all Pardons signed by the King, pass through his hands, before they come to the Great Seal of England. And h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ought not to put this Seal to any Grant, with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out good Warrant under the King's Privy Signet; nor with Warrant, if it be agains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law or Custom, until the King be first ac∣quainted. He manages also divers other Mat∣ters of less concernment, which do not pass the Great Seal.</P>
<P>He is, by his Place, of the King's Privy Council, and takes his Oath accordingly; besides a particular Oath, as Lord Privy Seal. Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is a Court of Requests, he is the chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judge of it.</P>
<P>His Place is also during the King's Pleasure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and his Salary is 1500 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum.</HI></P>
<P>The sixth Great Officer of the Crown i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Lord Great Chamberlain of England,</HI> an Of∣ficer of State, and of great Antiquity, whose chief Business is on the Coronation-Day. For it is his Office that Day to bring the King his Shirt, Coyf, and Wearing Cloaths before his Majesty rises; and to carry at the Coronation the Coyf, Gloves, and Linnen to be used by the King upon that Occasion. In the Church where the King is Crowned he undresses and attires his Majesty with Robes Royal, and give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Him the Gold which is offered by Him at the Altar. Before and after Dinner he serves the King with Water, to wash his hands.</P>
<P>For this Service he has 40 Ells of Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣son Velver for-his own Robes, the King's Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and all the Furniture of his Bed-Chamber all the King's Night-Apparel, and the Baso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Towels used at Dinner, for his Fees.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="266"/>
<P>He has also Livery and Lodging in the King's Court, certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees from all Peers of the Realm at their Creation, and from each Arch-Bishop or Bishop when they do their Ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>age or Fealty to the King.</P>
<P>To him belongs the Care of providing all Things in the House of Lords in Parliament-Time, and therefore has an Apartment al∣lowed him near the House of Lords.</P>
<P>This Office is Hereditary, and belongs to the Earls of Lindsey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lord High Constable</HI> is another great Of∣ficer, but of too great Authority and Power to be continued, and therefore is only created for the Solemnity of the King's Coronation. The Duke of Ormond was High Constable in the last.</P>
<P>The next is the <HI>Earl Marshal of England,</HI> an Of∣ficer of great Antiquity, and anciently of great Power. His proper Office is to summon the Nobi∣lity to the King's Coronation, with such Directi∣ons for State and publick Appearance as be∣comes that Solemnity. He also takes Cogni∣zance of Matters of War and Arms out of the reach of the Common Law, and in these Matters he is commonly guided by the Civil Law. Neither can any obtain a Coat of Arms, but he must first apply himself to the Earl Marshal, to whom the Heralds Colledge is subordinate.</P>
<P>The last is the <HI>Lord High Admiral of Eng∣land;</HI> an Office held by Patent, and of so great a Trust, that it has usually been given to Princes of the Royal Bloud.</P>
<PB N="132" REF="267"/>
<P>For the Lord High Admiral is Intrusted with no less than the Management of all Mari∣time Affairs, with the Government of the King's Navy, with Power of Decision in all Causes Maritime, aswell Civil as Criminal, of all Things done upon or beyond the Sea in any Part of the World, in all Ports and Ha∣vens, upon the Sea-Coasts, and all Rivers be∣low the first Bridge next towards the Sea. In short, the Admiralty being in a manner a separate Kingdom from the rest, the Lord High Admiral may be reputed at least the Vice∣roy thereof.</P>
<P>A Multitude of Officers high and low are under him, both at Sea and Land; some of a Military, others of a Civil Capacity; some Judicial, others Ministerial. And under him is held the High Court of Admiralty, the Places and Offices whereof are in his Gift.</P>
<P>The last High Admiral of England was the late King, when Duke of York. For, since he came to the Crown, the Office was executed by Seven Lords Commissioners, as it is to this day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Their present Majesties, King</HI> WILLIAM <HI>and Queen</HI> MARY, <HI>With a brief Account of Their Accession to the Crown.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>KING <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> our present Mo∣narch, is the only Issue of the late Il∣lustrious Prince <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> Prince of Orange, and of the Deceased Prin∣cess Royal <HI>Mary,</HI> eldest Daughter to King Charles I, who was wedded to the foresaid Prince in the Year 1641.</P>
<P>His Majesty was born in Holland Nov. 4th 1650, ten days after his Fathers Death; and was Christened by the Names of <HI>William Henry, William</HI> being his Fathers Name, and <HI>Henry</HI> his Grandfathers.</P>
<P>The House of <HI>Nassaw</HI> is an Ancient and most Illustrious Family, so called from <HI>Nassaw,</HI> a Town and County in <HI>Weteravia</HI> a Province of Germany. That Branch of it from whence the King is descended had their usual Seat at <HI>Dillenburg,</HI> not far from <HI>Nassaw,</HI> before they settled in the Low-Countries; whence, for Distinctions sake, they were named the Earls of <HI>Nassaw</HI> of the House of <HI>Dillenburg.</HI></P>
<PB N="134" REF="268"/>
<P><HI>Otho</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> who died Anno 1190, was the Founder of the present Family of the Princes of <HI>Orange;</HI> out of which descended <HI>Adolph,</HI> Earl of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> who was chosen Em∣perour in the Year 1292. By the Marriage of <HI>Engelbert,</HI> the seventh Earl of this House, with Mary Daughter and Heir of Philip Lord of <HI>Breda</HI> in Brabant, that Town and Barony, with many other fair Estates in the Nether∣lands was added to the Family. And by the Marriage of <HI>Henry</HI> (the tenth Earl of <HI>Nassaw</HI>) Anno 1515. with Claude of Chalons, Sister and Heir of Philibert Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> this Principality, bordering upon Provence and Dau∣phene within the Dominions of France, ac∣crued to the Family. So much the worse for having so ill an Neighbour as the present French King, who has long since rapaciously seized upon it; but left however what he could not take away, the King's just Title to it.</P>
<P>In short, our Gracious King William is the 18th Earl of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> beginning with Otho aforesaid; and the 7th Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> of his Family, beginning with Rene of Nassaw, Son of Henry and Claude, who succeeded Philibert his Uncle in the Principality of Orange.</P>
<P>A Family as much honoured for the per∣sonal Merit of the Princes of it as any other in Europe, and to which the States of Hol∣land ow the Liberty and Greatness they injoy. All the World knows how great a Patron and Assertor of the Belgick Liberties against the Spaniard was the most noble and generous Prince <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> one of his Majestie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ancestors. And, to pass by the generous Ex∣ploits
<PB N="135" REF="268"/>of his noble Successors till the present King William, 'tis well known what his Ma∣jestly has done to rescue, not only his Native Country, but the best Part of Europe from its Oppressors.</P>
<P>It has been of late Years, both at home and abroad, the Maxim of some Princes, to outvy each other in preying upon and destroy∣ing not only their Neighbours, but their own Protestant Subjects, by all Methods of Perfidi∣ousness and Cruelty. To establish or maintain their Tyranny, they went about to introduce a general Ignorance. For where Subjects part with their Reason, 'tis easy for them to part with their Liberty; witness those miserable Inslaved Countries where Popery domineers.</P>
<P>On the contrary the House of Orange has always appeared against that ravenous and in∣humane Principle. And, as if Providence had appointed them for a Check to Tyranny, God has been pleased accordingly to bless their just Indeavours.</P>
<P>Never the Liberty of England, and the Pro∣testant Interest in general, lay more at stake than it did in the late Reign. 'Tis plain there was a general Design to extirpate Here∣ly in a Popish Sense, and to inslave all Eu∣rope. The Plot was laid in the Reign of <HI>blessed</HI> King Charles, who with a shew of Pro∣teslantism made the Way smooth for Pope∣ry. At last, when all Things were finely prepared to the hand of his next Heir, King Charles go's off the Stage; and his Brother, to play the last Act, enters, and ascends the Throne.</P>
<P>No Prince more Courteous, more Obliging, or more Promising at first than He was to his
<PB N="136" REF="269"/>new Subjects. The Church of England Trium∣phed in his Exaltation, and Addressed Him from all Parts of the Kingdom, as their Tutela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Angel. The People in general look'd upon him as an Incomparable Hero, who would quickly make it his Business to pull down the Hector of France, and <HI>to carry the Glory of Eng∣land beyond all his Predecessors.</HI> In short, so great were the Hopes of this King, that Ed∣ward III, and Henry V, the most glorious Mo∣narchs of England, were upon his Account to be hissed out of our English Chronicles.</P>
<P>No body dreamed of a <HI>Popish Catechism,</HI> to be the first step to this Glory, nor of an Army to be raised for the defence of it. Under whose shelter, besides a secret League with France, the Prerogative began presently to swell above its Banks, the Laws to be Overwhelmed the Liberty and Property of the Subject Invaded, the Church of England Crushed that had raised the King to the Throne, Popery crowing over all the Nation, and to crown all their Hopes, <HI>presto,</HI> a Prince of Wales. In short, to speak in terms of War, the Miner was fix'd, and we must ei∣ther Surrender, or be Stormed.</P>
<P>This was our Condition, when the Prince of Orange (our present King) undertook our De∣liverance, and effected it, under God, in a mi∣raculous manner. Upon whose Approach our <HI>Mass-Hero</HI> fled, left us to shift for our selves, and the Popish Party to the mercy of the Rab∣ble. This hapned Dec. 11th. 1688, a fatal Year in this and the foregoing Age to Popery i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> England.</P>
<P>In that state of Anarchy, what could the Nation do less than provide for a Settlement under the gracious Influences of the Prince. Which was accordingly done, in as regular
<PB N="137" REF="269"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Way as the present state of Affairs would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow.</P>
<P>King James having thus deserted the Go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernment, nine and twenty of the Lords Spi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al and Temporal, such as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ned to be at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t time in and about the Cities of London <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Westminster, immediately assembled at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ildhall, Where they unanimously Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved to apply themselves to His Highness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prince of Orange, and to assist Him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th their utmost Endeavours in the ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing with all speed such a free Parliament, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the security of our Laws, Liberties, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>operties, as thereby the Church of England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> particular, (with a due Liberty to Prote∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt Dissenters,) and in general the Protestant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eligion and Interest over the whole World <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight be supported and incouraged, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lory of God, the Happiness of these King∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oms, and the Advantage of all Princes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates in Christendom. Whereof they made publick Declaration, signed by every one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lords; amongst which the Earl of <HI>Pem∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke,</HI> the Lord Viscount <HI>Weymouth,</HI> the Bishop <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Ely,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Culpeper,</HI> were chosen to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tend forthwith His Highness with the said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eclaration, and at the same time acquaint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with what they had further done at that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeting.</P>
<P>Few days after this, the Lord Mayor, Alder∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, and Commons of the City of London in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmon Council Assembled, made an humble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddress to the Prince, wherein they returned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Highness their Thanks for his glorious Un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtaking to rescue these Kingdoms from Po∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry and Slavery, look'd upon him as their Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, implored his Protection, and humbly be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght Him to repair to this City, where he
<PB N="138" REF="270"/>should be received with Universal Joy and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tisfaction.</P>
<P>The Prince was then at <HI>Henley,</HI> where he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ceived the Addressers in the most obliging ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ner, with A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rances of his Protection, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Readiness to comply with their D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fires.</P>
<P>In the mean time King James was unhappi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken in a Disguise at Feversham in Kent, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was going for France. Where being soon D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> covered, he was at last prevailed upon to Re∣turn; so that his Guards and Coach being se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Him, he came back to Whitehall, Sund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Dec. 16, and reassumed the Government. Whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King James came up to London from the South the Prince made his Way thither from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> West, in hopes that his Majesty would come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an amicable and equitable Accommodation by referring all Grievances to a free Parl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ment.</P>
<P>But the King, not being able to bear the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of a Free Parliament, after so many notori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Violations of the Laws of the Realm, grew fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> uneasy at Whitehall, and his Heart beat ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for France, as his only Place of Refuge. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rochester he goes, from whence few Days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ter he privately Withdrew himself the sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> time; but with more success than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> For he got clear to France, where the Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and the supposed Prince of Wales had so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time before taken Sanctuary.</P>
<P>Mean while the Prince of Orange was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to St. James's, Dec. 19th, where his High<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> received the Compliments of all the Nobi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and other Persons of the chiefest quality Town; and at Night the Streets were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Bonfires, with Ringing of Bells, and ther publick Demonstrations of Joy.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="270"/>
<P>Then the Scene of Affairs was so very much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered, that nothing but a new Settlement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld Resettle us. In order to which a great Assembly of Lords and Commons, Members of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmer Parliaments, besides the Lord Mayor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldermen and Common Council of the City of London, was held at Westminster, to consult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat was fit to be done. Who, after some De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tes upon the present Juncture, came to this resolve, that his Highness the Prince of O∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nge should be humbly Intreated to Summon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Convention</HI> of Lords and Commons by his Cir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ular Letters <HI>(these to be chosen by the People, in a Parliamentary Way)</HI> to meet at Westminster on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he 22th. of January following; And that His sighness in the mean time would be pleased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o take upon Him the Administration of pub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick Affairs both Civil and Military, and the disposal of the publick Revenue. Which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one accordingly.</P>
<P>The Convention being met at the Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppointed, the House of Commons broke the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Voted the <HI>Abdication of the Govern∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent by King James,</HI> and the <HI>Vacancy of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rone,</HI> that is in short, a Dissolution of the whole Frame of Government. The House of Lords, being divided as to the Word <HI>Abdicate,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d several Conferences about it with the Com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, till at last their Lordships Concurred with them by Plurality of Votes. Which hap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed on the 6th of Febr, the same Day upon which King James had ascended the Throne.</P>
<P>The Government being thus declared in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate of Dissolution, and the Throne Vacant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he next Business was to Resettle the first by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling up the last. It was then in their power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bestow the Crown upon whom they pleased. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, after several Debates, the Two Houses at
<PB N="140" REF="271"/>last fully agreed upon a joynt Declaration con∣cerning the Misgovernment of King James, the Offer of the Crown to the Prince and Prince of Orange, the Abrogation of the Oaths of Al∣legiance and Supremacy, and the new Oaths t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be taken instead of them.</P>
<P>All this was done by the 12th of February upon which Day Her Royal Highness the Prin∣cess of Orange arrived at Whitehall, about tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Afternoon; the welcome News whereo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was received with universal Demonstrations o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Joy.</P>
<P>The next Day, Febr. 13th, both Houses be∣ing Assembled at Westminster, came to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Banqueting House, where they presented t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Prince and Princess of Orange the Instru∣ment in Writing agreed upon for Declarin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Their Highnesses KING and QUEEN o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with all the <HI>Domini∣ons</HI> and <HI>Territories</HI> thereunto belonging, and received Their Consent. Whereupon Their Majesties were immediately Proclaimed, in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> solemn Manner as I have already described i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Seventh Chapter.</P>
<P>And thus was accomplished the Curse of King James, J, (a Prince whose Learned Pen baffle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the Conclave,) which he solemnly pronoun∣ced on any of his Posterity that should turn Pa∣pists. I am heartily sorry that it should fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heavy upon the late King; but it is better so than that three Kingdoms should perish.</P>
<P>And yet had he kept within some reasonable Bounds, and his Religion to himself, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his open Violations of the Laws, as it were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> defiance, 'tis very likely the Nation would ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> been upon his account very indulgent to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Roman Catholick Party. They might have g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by this means some legal Toleration, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="141" REF="271"/>the space of few Years would have Incoura∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d and Strengthned their Party here conside∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly. So quick of growth are the Roman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atholicks, where they find Incourage∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent.</P>
<P>Therefore the very Court of France did o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enly declare his Errors to the World, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed this Verdict upon him, That his whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onduct had been very little Judicious. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mperour on the other side, in his Letter to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing James, from Vienna, Apr. 9. 1689, could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t forbear, amongst his tender condoling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpressions, to tell him the Cause of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in.</P>
<P>But King James would never be advised to Moderation, and no Counsellors were welcome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him but such as prompted him to Vio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce. The Issue whereof proved accordingly; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Covet, all Lose.</HI></P>
<P>I conclude with a Character of Their Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sties, a bold Thing I confess for my Pen to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dertake; but such as I can make it, it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake us the more sensible of our Happi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess.</P>
<P>The King is a Prince perhaps the best quali∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for a Throne. He is Great without Pride, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rue to his Word, Wise in his Deliberations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecret in his Counsels, Generous in his At∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpts, Undaunted in Dangers, Valiant with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t Cruelty, Unchanged under all Events. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves Justice with Moderation, Government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithout Tyranny, Religion without Persecu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on, and Devotion without Hypocrisy or Su∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rstition.</P>
<P>How often has he exposed his Life through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re and Sword for a sinking Commonwealth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll at last he rescued it from the open Violence
<PB N="142" REF="272"/>of one King, and the Undermining of another No Temptation could draw him away from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> generous Principle, nothing but true Greatne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could make him Great.</P>
<P>To Save us here, when we were at the Brit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Ruin, designed for a Prey to those two In∣separable Monsters, Popery and Slavery, He h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ventured his Life by Sea and Land.

Undaunted he went through all; and without shedding of Blood, restored of a su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣den two languishing Nations. France, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> laughed at the Attempt, was amazed at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Success; and her superfine Politicks blushed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sight of this.</P>
<P>But that which is admirable is to see a Prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a Temper so even, as neither to be dishea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ned with Hardships and Misfortunes, nor p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up with Success.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Ʋnreasonableness of the Disaf∣fected Party, under Their Ma∣jesties Gracious Government.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>UNder our happy Circumstances of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gentle and easy Government, of seeing our Laws and Property Restored, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> want nothing but Union, to compleat our Hap∣piness. But, instead of it, we have Men a∣mongst us that are already sick of it, some <HI>Churchmen,</HI> some <HI>Dissenters,</HI> besides the genera∣lity of <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI></P>
<P>These indeed have the most reason to grum∣ble; who, by losing King James, have lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their greatest Hopes. Yet, if they do serious∣ly consider what Indulgence they met with when they expected nothing but Vengeance they ought to rest satisfied, and blush at their bloody Principles. What have they suffered for all their Clamours, Threats, Insults, and Outrages, during the Reign of King James Scarce a Man hurt amongst them, and but a few Houses pulled down by the Rage of the Mobile, incouraged thereto by the Desertio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of King James, when he left us without an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> form of Government. Ever since they have injoy'd the same Protection with the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Subjects of this Kingdom, whatever has bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> maliciously suggested and published beyond Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="145" REF="273"/>to the contrary; and have been no where (at least with Authority) hindered in their Devo∣tions. So very Indulgent the King has been hitherto to his greatest Enemies.</P>
<P>But, suppose King James had prevailed, they would have had indeed Popery Triumphant, fine Processions, Monks in their proper Habits, and our Saviour walking the Streets in a Box. But what's all this to Property? A Belly full of domineering Popery makes many an empty Belly, for Slavery always attends it. The Church of Rome is an hungry Church, and the Princes of her Communion know best how to squeeze their Subjects. Whilst they work upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody, she works upon the Soul. They pull one way, she another; and so they divide the Spoil, making a Prey of the People every where. Therefore, if the English Papists understand their true Interest, as their Wise Ancestors did, they ought to stand for the English Liberty, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong as they can have any Indulgence in matter of Religion.</P>
<P>But, besides the Roman Catholicks, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>deed the most excusable in this Case, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould have imagined that <HI>Protestants</HI> should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anable of lessening themselves their own Hap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iness in this Change? And amongst them <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>senters,</HI> disgusted, but for what? Because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King has declared Himself particularly for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church of England. I bear a Love to Dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ters, as Christians, and Protestants, and So∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er People for the generality. But they cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pect to be blameless, as long as Envy and Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nge (two Passions very opposite to Conten∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness and Meekness) do so far possess some of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em, as never to be pleased, till they get the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ff in their hands. Time was when they desired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing more but the Liberty of Serving God in
<PB N="146" REF="274"/>their Way, without Molestation. This Liberty they got since this Change by Act of Parliament, with the ready Concurrence of the Church of England Members, and the King's Assent to it; but now it won't serve their turn. If nothing will please them but to see a Church run down that stood alone at the Gap in the late Reign, that so learnedly baffled all the Popish Writers, and was therefore by a Roman Decree to be stript of all, and destroyed, when the Dissen∣ters were much in favour in that Court, God forbid they should ever be pleased. The King knows who are the best Friends to the Crown, and upon whom he may safely rely. He loves all his Subjects, but perhaps not all alike.</P>
<P>The Mischief is, that some of our <HI>Churchmen</HI> are also out of Humour, or rather out of order. One lies sick of a Scruple of Conscience, another languishes in love with King James, a third is e'en distracted betwixt a King <HI>De Jure</HI> and a King <HI>De Facto.</HI> But those Diseases (I thank God) are not so Epidemical, as to indanger a Convulsion in the State. There are excellent and approved Remedies for them in the <HI>Pasto∣ral Letter</HI> of the present Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and in the <HI>Collection of Papers,</HI> but particularly in the late Book put out by that eminent Divine <HI>Dr. Sherlock,</HI> to which for brevity sake I refer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Diseased. But, if Reason cannot, Time (I hope) will wear out their Distempers. And so I bid them Farewell.</P>

<PB N="147" REF="274"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the present KING and QƲEEN's Court.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THeir Majesties Court is composed of two distinct Bodies, one of Laymen, another of Churchmen. I shall begin with the first, not out of any Disrespect to the second, but because this seems to me the most proper and natural Method.</P>
<P>The Court-Laymen are subdivided into two distinct Parts, Civil and Military.</P>
<P>But, before we descend to Particulars, 'tis to be observed,</P>
<P N="1">I. That the Court, wherever it is, has within it self a certain Latitude of Jurisdiction, called the <HI>Verge of the Court;</HI> which is every way within 12 miles of the chief Tunnel of the Court, except London, which is exempted by Charter.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the King's Court, or Pallace where is Majesty resides, is counted so sacred a Place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at not only Striking of any one there in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assion is severely forbidden, but also all Oc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asions of Striking. The first, by the ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aws of England, was punished with Death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Loss of Goods. And to this day, who∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er presumes to strike another within the Pal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce where the King's Person resides, and does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> draw blood by his Stroke, is liable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thout His Majesties Pardon, to lose his right
<PB N="148" REF="275"/>Hand, to be Fined at the King's Will, and ly in Prison till the Fine be paid. And, further to deter any one from presuming to Strike in the King's Court, the Punishment for it is executed with great Ceremony.</P>
<P N="3">III. That, as great as the Court is, yet it falls much short of what it has been formerly, whe∣ther we consider the prodigious Plenty the Court lived in, or the Greatness of the Houshold. The Diminution whereof was first occasioned by the Troubles in the Reign of Charles I, continued by Charles his Son and made greater by the late King James. Before the Troubles aforesaid, this Court went far beyond all others in Plenty and Magnificence, no less than 86 Tables being kept here, furnished in all with about 500 Dishes each Meal, with all Things sutable. A Pro∣fuseness (I confess) becoming the Times, when the English were more addicted to Feasting, than they are at present.</P>
<P>But, to come to the present State of the Court, the King's Houshold is managed in chief by these three principal Officers; whose respec∣tive Salaries I have annexed. Viz.</P>

Upon the King's Death, he breaks his Staff over the King's Herse, and thereby discharges all Court-Officers under him.</P>
<P>By his Office, without any Commission, he judges of all Treasons, Murders, Felonies, and Bloudsheds committed in the Court, or within the Verge. Which is much for the King's Honour, that where His Majesty is, no Justice should be sought but immediately from his own Officers.</P>
<P>At the beginning of Parliaments he attends the King's Person, and at the end he adjusts the Parliament Expences, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To take the Accounts for all Expences of the King's Houshold there is a Place at Court called the <HI>Compting-House.</HI></P>
<P>And in this House is kept that ancient Court of Justice called the <HI>Green Cloth,</HI> of a Green Cloth whereat the Court sits.</P>
<P>The Officers that sit in the <HI>Compting-House,</HI> and at the Board of <HI>Green Cloth,</HI> with their re∣spective Salaries, are,</P>

<P>Amongst which the <HI>Lord Steward,</HI> the <HI>Trea∣surer,</HI> and the <HI>Comptroller</HI> are usually of the King's Privy Council; and the two last are also White-Staff Officers.</P>
<P>Their Office in the <HI>Compting House</HI> is there to sit day by day, to take (as I said before) the Accompts for all Expences of the King's Houshold, to make Provisions for it, to make the Payments, and such Orders as they think fit for the Servants</P>
<P>In short, to Them is committed the Charge and Government of the King's House; with Power to correct all the Servants therein that shall any way offend, and to keep the Peace not only within it, but within the Verge of the Court. And, whereas the King's Servants are free from Arrest, the Creditors of such as are backward to pay have no other way for Payment, but to make their application to the Board of <HI>Green Cloth,</HI> which upon hearing of the Matter, take care to see Justice done to the Creditors.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Lord Steward</HI>'s Absence, the <HI>Treasurer</HI> has power, with the <HI>Comptroller,</HI> and <HI>Steward of the Marshalsea,</HI> (by virtue of their Office, and without Commission) to hear and determine
<PB N="151" REF="276"/>Treasons, Felonies, and other Crimes committed within the King's Pallace, and that by Verdict of the King's Houshold. And, if any Servant within the Check-Roll be found guilty of Felo∣ny, he is incapable of the Benefit of the Cler∣gy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Comptroller's</HI> Office is to Comptrol the Accounts of the Green Cloth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cofferer</HI> pays the Wages to the King's Servants, above and below Stairs; and for the Houshold Provisions, according to the Allow∣ance and Direction of the Green Cloth. He has also a particular Charge and Oversight of the inferiour Officers of the King's House.</P>
<P>The <HI>Master of the Houshold</HI> surveys the Ac∣counts of the House.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerks of the Green Cloth</HI> sum up all Bills of Comptrolment, Parcels, and Brievements. And the two <HI>Clerks Comptrollers</HI> do let and allow them.</P>
<P>But, besides the foresaid Officers belonging to the Compting House and Green Cloth, there are inferiour Officers and Servants, relating to the same. Viz.

<P>They wait half at a time Quarterly in the Presence Chamber, and with their gilt Pole-Axes attend the King's Person to and from his Chappel Royal. But on Christmas, Easter, and Whitsun-Days, All Saints, St. George's Feast, Coronation Days, and other extraordinary Oc∣casions, they are all obliged, under the Pe∣nalty of the <HI>Checque,</HI> to give their Atten∣dance.</P>
<P>On the Coronation-Day, and at St. George's Feast, they have the Honour to carry up the King's Dinner. And at those times the King does usually confer the Honour of Knighthood on two of them, such as the Captain presents to his Majesty.</P>
<P>In Time of War they are bound to attend the King on Horseback, with Cuirassiers Arms. And therefore each of them is obliged, even in Time of Peace, to keep two Horses and a Servant, who is likewise to be armed; but the King usually dispenses with this part of their Duty.</P>
<P>Their Standard born in Time of War, is <HI>A Cross Gules in a Field Argent.</HI></P>
<P>They are not under the Lord Chamberlain, but only under their own Officers. The chief whereof is the <HI>Captain,</HI> who is always a Noble∣man of the Realm, or a Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, whose Yearly Pay is 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>Next to whom is the <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> whose Year∣ly Pay is 500 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> The <HI>Standard-bearer,</HI> 300 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> And the <HI>Clerk of the Checque,</HI> who is the Pay-Master of the Band, 150 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>

<P>By this <HI>Clerk</HI> all the Band and Officers, except the Captain) are Sworn, for which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has a Fee of 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 Shill. And 'tis his Office besides, to take notice of those that are absent, when they should be upon their Duty.</P>
<P>To provide Lodgings for them, and to sup∣ply the Clerk in his absence, as his Deputy, there is a <HI>Gentleman Harbinger,</HI> whose Fee is 70 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Yearly.</P>
<P>In short, this Band of Pensioners is a Nur∣sery to breed up young Gentlemen, and fit them for Imployments both Civil and Military, as well abroad as at home.</P>
<P>Next to them in the King's Pallace, is ano∣ther Body to gard their Majesties. Viz. the <HI>Yeomen of the Gard,</HI> who wait in the first Room above Stairs, called the Gard-Cham∣ber.</P>
<P>They were wont to be 200, of a larger Stature than ordinary, when every one of them was to be six foot high. At present they are but 100, whereof 24 wait in the Day-time, and 12 watch by Night. And, when the King or Queen goes abroad, al∣ways a Party of them attend on Foot their Royal Persons; Some with Guns, and o∣thers with Partizans, all with large Swords by their Sides. They, and the Warders of the Tower, have a peculiar Habit; Viz. Scarlet Coats and Breeches, both garded with black Velvet, the Coats only down to the Knee, with Badges upon them before and behind. Instead of Hats, they wear black Vel∣vet Caps, round and broad-crowned, according to the Mode in the Reign of Henry VIII.
<PB REF="285"/>Their Pay now (besides their Diet at Court when upon Duty) is not above 30 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which falls much short of what it has been formerly.</P>
<P>For their Officers they have a <HI>Captain,</HI> a <HI>Lieu∣tenant,</HI> an <HI>Ensign,</HI> a <HI>Clerk of the Checque,</HI> and four <HI>Exempts</HI> or <HI>Corporals.</HI></P>
<P>The King and Queen, for their Gard a∣broad, have four Troops of Horse, three English, and one Dutch, consisting each of 200, in all 800 Men, besides Officers. A fine Body of Horse, for the most part composed of Gentlemen; well mounted, armed, and equipped, and allowed 4 Shill. a Day.</P>
<P>These four Troops are all distinguished from each other by their different Ribbons, Carbine Belts, Hooses, and Holster-caps, im∣broidered with Their Majesties Cypher and Crown.</P>
<P>Each Troop is divided into four Divisions, two of which (making up 100 Horse) mount the Gard, commanded by one principal <HI>Com∣missionated Officer,</HI> two <HI>Brigadiers,</HI> and two <HI>Sub-Brigadiers.</HI> When the King or Queen goes a∣broad, either in a Coach or Chair, a Party is sent from the Gard to attend their Persons. But, when They are upon a Journey, then a Detachment is made out of the several Troops.</P>
<P>Each Troop is commanded in chief by a <HI>Captain.</HI> Next to whom there are two Lieute∣nants, a <HI>Cornet,</HI> a <HI>Guidon,</HI> four <HI>Exempts,</HI> four <HI>Bri∣gadiers,</HI> an <HI>Adjutant,</HI> who acts as Quarter-Master, and four <HI>Sub-Brigadiers.</HI></P>

<P>Now 'tis to be observed, that the <HI>Captains</HI> of Their Majesties Troops of Gards, always command by their Commission as eldest Colonels of Horse, the <HI>Lieutenants</HI> as eldest Lieutenant Colonels of Horse, the <HI>Cornets</HI> and <HI>Gui∣dons</HI> as eldest Majors, the <HI>Exempts</HI> as Captains, and the <HI>Brigadiers,</HI> as Lieutenants.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Adjutant</HI> and <HI>Sub-Brigadiers,</HI> they command not by Commission, but by War∣rant.</P>
<P>In case of Detachments, every Office precedes according to the Date of his Commission. But, when several Troops march with their Co∣lours, the Officer of the eldest Troop com∣mands those of equal Rank with him in the others, though their Commissions be of elder Date.</P>
<P>The Pay of each <HI>Captain</HI> is 20 shill a Day, of a <HI>Lieutenant</HI> 15, of a <HI>Cornet</HI> 14, of a <HI>Guidon</HI> 12, of each <HI>Exempt</HI> 12, of a <HI>Brigadier</HI> 10, of an <HI>Adjutant</HI> and <HI>Sub-Brigadier</HI> twelve pence above the Pay of a private <HI>Trooper.</HI></P>

<P>In order to which there is a <HI>Royal Chappel,</HI> besides the Kings Closet, or private Oratory) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r God's Servico and Worship. Where Prayers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e read thrice a Day, two Sermons preached very Sunday, besides other particular Times; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Communion administred every first Sunday <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Month throughout the Year, besides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e great Festivals, and all Things performed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th great Decency and Order.</P>
<P>For the doing whereof, there is first a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an of the Royal Chappel;</HI> who is usually some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave learned Prelate, chosen by the King, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o (as <HI>Dean</HI>) owns no Superiour but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, For, as the Royal Pallace is exempt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m all inferiour Temporal Jurisdiction, so is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Chappel from all Spiritual. 'Tis a Regal
<PB N="170" REF="287"/>Peculiar, reserved to the Kings Visitation and immediate Government; who is Supreme Or∣dinary, and as it were Prime Bishop over all the Churches and Bishops of England.</P>
<P>Under the Dean there is a <HI>Sub-Dean,</HI> or <HI>Pra∣centor Capellae;</HI> and next to him 12 <HI>Priests.</HI> Whereof ones peculiar Office is to read the first Morning Prayers to the Kings Houshold, to visit the Sick, to examine and prepare Com∣municants, and to do all other Duties-proper for his Station.</P>
<P>Next to the Priests there are 20 Gentle∣men, commonly called the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> (or <HI>Clerks</HI>) <HI>of the Chappel;</HI> who, with the afore∣said Priests, perform in the Chappel the Office of Divine Service in Praying, Singing, &amp;c. And three of these are chosen to be <HI>Or∣ganists.</HI> To whom, upon Sundays and Holy-Days, is joyned a Consort of the Kings Mu∣sick.</P>
<P>Moreover, for the Service of the Chappel, there are 12 <HI>Children</HI> in Ordinary, who make up the Musical Choir. These are instructed in the Rules and Art of Musick by one of the ablest Clerks, who is allowed considerably for their Board and his Teaching.</P>
<P>Here are also attending the Chappel, four Of∣ficers, called <HI>Vergers,</HI> from the Silver. Rods which they carry in their Hands. The chief whereof is called a <HI>Sergeant,</HI> the next two <HI>Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣men,</HI> and the fourth <HI>Groom of the Chappel.</HI></P>
<P>For the Preaching part, the King has no less than 48 <HI>Chaplains</HI> in Ordinary, who are usual∣ly eminent Doctors in Divinity, and most Deans or Prebends. These are under the particular Charge and Direction of the Lord Chamber∣lain, who appoints them the Time for their Service at Court, being to wait four of them
<PB N="171" REF="287"/>together Monthly. But, besides those 48, there are always <HI>Supernumeraries;</HI> some where∣of wait by appointment in lieu of those, who, by reason of Sickness or otherwise, can't give their attendance.</P>
<P>And, as Lent is a particular Time of the Year for Devotion (tho it is not observed in England with that Strictness and Superstition as it is in the Roman States) so the Royal Chappel shews an excellent Example, at that time especially, to all other Churches and Chappels of England.</P>
<P>In order to which the Lord Chamberlain, some time before Lent, do's appoint the <HI>Lent-Preachers,</HI> and causes a List of them to be printed, with their respective Times for Preaching during Lent. Then the Sermon-Days are Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, Weekly. The first Wednesday, being Ash-Wednesday, is fixt for the <HI>Dean of the Chappel</HI> to preach before the King; and the Friday after for the <HI>Dean of S. Paul's.</HI> Each Wed∣nesday after, one of the Kings <HI>Chaplains</HI> is ap∣pointed to preach; every Friday, the <HI>Dean</HI> of some Cathedral or Collegiate Church, and on Good Friday the <HI>Dean of Westminster.</HI> Every Sunday, a Bishop; on Palm-Sunday, an Arch-Bishop; and Easter-Day, the <HI>Lord Almoner.</HI></P>
<P>Upon Christmas, Easter, and Whitsunday, the King and. Queen do usually receive the Holy Sacrament, only with some of the Royal Fa∣mily, and two or three of the principal Bishops.</P>
<P>Those are three Days of twelve in the Year, on which Their Majesties, attended with the principal Nobility adorned with their Colla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Garter, together with some of the He∣ralds in their rich Coats, make in a grave so∣demn manner their Offering of Gold at the
<PB N="172" REF="288"/>Altar, which by the Dean of the Chappel is distributed afterwards among the Poor. The same is a Sum of Gold, to this day called the <HI>Besant,</HI> or the <HI>Bizantine,</HI> from <HI>Bizantium</HI> the old Name of Constantinople, where the piece of Gold was coined which anciently was Of∣fered by the Kings of England. The Gold to be offered is delivered to the King and Queen by the Lord Steward, or some other of the principal Officers; and it is Offered to God by Their Majesties, as an Acknowledgement that by his Grace They hold their Kingdoms of him.</P>
<P>The other Days of the Year on which they make the same Offering, are All-Saints, New-Years Day, Candlemas, Annunciation, Ascen∣sion Day, S. John the Baptist, and Michaelmas Day, when only Gold is offered. To which add Twelfth Day, when Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh are Offered by the King in several Purses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lord Almoner</HI> is usually a Bishop. Whose Office is to dispose of the Moneys allowed by the King for Alms, of all Deodands, and Goods of Self Murderers, forfeited to the King, and always bestowed in Alms to the Poor. He has the Priviledge to give the King's Dish, that is, the first Dish at Dinner, which is set upon the King's Table, to whatsoever Poor-man he pleases, or Mony in lieu thereof upon his Majesties account. Wherever the Court re∣sides, 24 Poor men are nominated by the Offi∣cers of the adjacent Parish, among whom Mony, Bread, and Beer, or all Mony, is equally divi∣ded at the Court Gate by the Lord Almoner Order at 7 of the Clock every Morning. And it has been the Custom for every Poor-man, be∣fore he received the Alms, to repeat the Cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="173" REF="288"/>and the Lords Prayer, in the presence of one of the King's Chaplains deputed by the Lord Almoner. Besides, there are many poor Pen∣sioners to the King and Queen below Stairs, who have a Competency duly paid unto them by the Almoner. And, when the King is in his Progress, his Lordship, or his Sub-Almoner for him, is to scatter new-coined Two-pences in the Towns and Places where the King passes through in his Progress, to a certain Sum by the Year▪ The <HI>Lord Almoner</HI> is to see all these Things done; for the Performance whereof he has 3 Officers allowed under him, to wit a <HI>Sub-Almoner,</HI> a <HI>Yeoman,</HI> and a <HI>Groom.</HI> And for that purpose there is at Court a parti∣cular Office, from hence called the <HI>Almon∣ry.</HI></P>
<P>On Maundy Thursday, (being the Thurs∣day before Easter) so called from the French <HI>Mande</HI> a sort of Basket, is performed the Ce∣remony of Washing the Feet of as many Poor∣men as the Years the King has reigned. Which is done sometimes by the King him∣self, and in his absence by the <HI>Lord Almoner;</HI> a piece of Humility taken from the Pattern of our Saviour. When the Poor-mens Feet are washed, he wipes them with a Towel. Then he gives every one of them for Cloathing two Yards and a half of Woollen-Cloth, Linnen-Cloth for Two Shirts, a pair of Shoes, and a pair of Stockings. For Eating, six Peny-loaves of Bread, with 3 Dishes of Fish in Platters; whereof one of Salt Salmon, another of green Fish or Cod, the third of pickle or red Her∣rings, or red Sprats. For Drink, a Gallon of Beer, and a Quart bottle of Wine. And, for Pocket Mony, a red-leather Purse, with as ma∣ny single Pence as the King is Years old; and,
<PB N="174" REF="289"/>in such another Purse, as many Shillings as the King has reigned Years. The Queen does also do the like to divers poor Wo∣men.</P>
<P>Lastly, the King has a <HI>Clerk of the Closet,</HI> who is commonly a reverend, sober, and learn∣ed Divine. His Office is to attend at the King's right hand during Divine Service, to resolve all Doubts concerning Spiritual Matters, and to wait on his Majesty in his Closet or private Oratory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dean of the Chappel's</HI> Fee is 200 l. Yearly, and a Table; the <HI>Sub-Dean's,</HI> 100; the <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Clerks of the Chappel,</HI> each 70 l.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lord Almoner</HI> has no Fee. The <HI>Sub-Almoner</HI> has but 6 l. 18. sh. a Year. But the <HI>Yeoman</HI> has 30, and the <HI>Groom</HI> 20 l. a Year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the Closet</HI> receives a Fee of 20 Nobles <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>So far I have done with the King's Court, which the Queen, as His Royal Consort, has a great share unto. And yet <HI>Her Majesty</HI> has her own <HI>Court</HI> besides to Her self, consisting both of Men and Women, with a sutable Re∣venue to support it. First she has

<PB N="177" REF="290"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of their present</HI> Majesties <HI>Land and Sea Forces, and the Ma∣nagement thereof.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THeir Majesties Land-Forces are either <HI>Ordinary,</HI> as the Horse and Foot Guards, the several Garrisons, and the standing Militia of the Country. Or <HI>Ex∣traordinary,</HI> as the present victorious Army in Ireland.</P>
<P>The <HI>Horse</HI> and <HI>Foot-Guards</HI> I have already de∣scribed in the foregoing Account of the King and Queens Court, where it appears they a∣mount to 7000 Men at least.</P>
<P>The principal <HI>Garrisoned Places</HI> in England are <HI>Portsmouth, Plimouth,</HI> the <HI>Tower of London, Wind∣sor-Castle, Chester, Carlisle, Hull, Berwick, Do∣ver-Castle,</HI> and these two Forts on the Thames, <HI>Sheerness</HI> and <HI>Tilbury.</HI></P>
<P>In the Isle of Wight there are constant Gar∣risons, at <HI>Cowes, Sandham Fort, West-Yarmouth,</HI> and <HI>Carisbrook.</HI> So there is at <HI>Hurst</HI> and <HI>Calshot Castles,</HI> upon two Points of Hampshire shoot∣ing forth into the Sea over against the said Isle. To which add <HI>Upner Castle</HI> in Kent, <HI>Landguard Fort</HI> in Suffolk, <HI>Clifford Tower</HI> and <HI>Scarborough Castle</HI> in Yorkshire, <HI>Tinmouth Castle</HI> in Northumberland, and <HI>Holy Island</HI> near the Coast of that County, <HI>S. Maries Castle</HI> among
<PB N="178" REF="291"/>the Isles of Scilly, <HI>Pendennis</HI> in Cornwal, and <HI>Portland Castle</HI> in Dorsetshire. Besides the Islands of <HI>Jersey</HI> and <HI>Garnsey,</HI> on the Coast of Normandy.</P>
<P>The Number of Men in each of those Gar∣risons is uncertain; for it is greater or lesser, as Occasion serves. Most of them are unregimen∣ted Companies.</P>
<P>These, together with the Royal Guards, be∣ing the standing Land-Forces in Their Ma∣jesties Pay, there is for the Paying of them, first a general Officer, called the <HI>Pay-Master General,</HI> who has several Clerks under him.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Commissary General of the Musters,</HI> who has a <HI>Deputy Commissary</HI> in London; besides eight other <HI>Deputy-Commissaries,</HI> who have their distinct Circuits in the Country, for Mustering the Forces which lye in the several Garrisons.</P>
<P>There is also a <HI>Secretary at War,</HI> with several Clerks, and a Messenger under him.</P>
<P>Which three considerable Offices are kept at the Horse-Guard.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is a <HI>Judge Advocate,</HI> a <HI>Scout-Master General,</HI> an <HI>Adjutant General,</HI> and a <HI>Marshal of the Horse;</HI> besides a <HI>Chirurgeon Ge∣neral.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst Their Majesties Land Forces we may reckon the <HI>Militia,</HI> or <HI>Train Bands</HI> of e∣very County, as being wholly at the King's Disposal, and bound to Assist Him upon all Occasions within the Bounds of the Realm.</P>
<P>In Queen Elizabeth's Time a general Muster was made, by her Order, of all Men able to bear Arms, from the Age of 16 to 60; who
<PB N="179" REF="291"/>then amounted to three Millions of Men, whereof six hundred Thousand fit for War. But, in Time of Peace, the Matter is so regu∣lated, that there is not above one hundred thou∣sand Horse and Foot actually Inrolled for the Defence of the Realm.</P>
<P>The Management whereof is in the hands of the <HI>Lord Lieutenants</HI> of the several Counties of England, who are usually of the principal Rank amongst the Peers of the Realm, chosen for that purpose by the King, and so created by his Commission. They have Power by Act of Par∣liament to charge any Person with Horse, Horsemen, and Arms, that has 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year, or 6000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> personal Estate; and with a Foot Souldier, any Person that has 50 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> yearly Re∣venue, or 600 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> personal Estate. Those that have meaner Estates are to joyn two or three together, either to find a Horse and Horse∣man, or a Foot Souldier, according to their E∣states.</P>
<P>They have also Power to Arm, Array, and Form the Forces into Companies, Troops, and Regiments, and to make their Officers by gi∣ving them Commissions; and, upon any Re∣bellion or Invasion, to lead and imploy the Men so Armed within their respective Coun∣ties, or into any other County, as the King shall give Order.</P>
<P>They name their <HI>Deputy Lieutenants,</HI> and present them to the King, for his Confirmation. Who are to be of the principal Gentry of the Country, and have the same Power as the Lord Lieutenant in his absence.</P>
<P>To find out Ammunition and other Neces∣saries, there is a Tax of 70000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Month upon the whole Kingdom, whereof the Lord Lieu∣tenants or Deputies, or any three (or more) of
<PB N="180" REF="292"/>them, may levy a Fourth Part of each Mans Proportion in it. And, when occasion shall be to bring the Militia into actual Service, the Per∣sons so charged are to provide each Souldier re∣spectively with pay in hand for a Month, at the rate of 2 shill. a Day for a Horseman, and 12 pence for a Foot Souldier. For Repayment of which Mony, and the satisfaction of the Of∣ficers for their Pay, during the time aforesaid, Provision is to be made by the King out of the publick Revenue; and, till the same be actually performed, none can be charged with another Months Pay.</P>
<P>These Forces are always to be in readiness, with all Things necessary at the beat of Drum, or sound of Trumpet, to appear, muster, and be at certain times trained and discipli∣ned.</P>
<P>Now, to give speedy notice of an approach∣ing Invasion, there are all over England high Poles erected upon eminent Places both Inland and Maritime, with Pitch-barrels fastened on the Top, known by the name of <HI>Beacons.</HI> Which being set on fire, one by the sight of another, the whole Kingdom has thereby no∣tice in few Hours of the approaching Danger. Whereupon the Militia, to secure the Kingdom, makes haste to the Sea-Coasts.</P>
<P>As for the present <HI>Army,</HI> which God has lately blest with a glorious Victory, carrying with it the Reduction of Ireland, and (I hope) a Fate upon France, it was lately Computed to be near Fifty thousand strong, Horse, Foot, and Dragoons; consisting of English, Irish, French, Danish, and Dutch Forces.</P>
<P>I wish, for the satisfaction of the Reader, that I could give a particular and exact Account of
<PB N="181" REF="292"/>this brave and gallant Army. But, rather than do it imperfectly, I beg the Reader's leave to decline it.</P>
<P>And so I come to the <HI>Maritime Power</HI> of England. Which consists in general of about 130 <HI>Men of War;</HI> besides <HI>Fireships, Yachts, Hulks, Ketches, Sloops, Hays,</HI> and <HI>Smacks,</HI> and seve∣ral other Vessels for Tenders and Victual∣lers.</P>
<P>The Men of War are divided into six Rates, or Ranks; Built in several Places, but most at <HI>Woolwich, Chatham, Deptford, Blackwall, Har∣wich,</HI> and <HI>Portsmouth.</HI></P>
<P>The following List gives you the Names of them, according to their Rates, in the Alpha∣betick Order, with the Year when they were built; also the Number of Tuns, Men, and Guns each of them commonly carries abroad in Time of War. Those whose Names be in the Roman Letter, are the Thirty that were built by an Act of Parliament made in the Year 1676.</P>

<P>There are moreover 7 <HI>Hulks,</HI> 2 <HI>Ketches,</HI> 12 <HI>Sloops,</HI> 3 <HI>Hoys,</HI> and 5 <HI>Smacks.</HI></P>
<P>Five of the <HI>Hulks</HI> are Dutch Prizes, and the two other (viz. the <HI>America,</HI> and the <HI>Arms of Horn</HI>) were bought. Amongst which the <HI>Al∣phin</HI> carries 4 Guns, the <HI>America</HI> 20, the <HI>Arms of Horn</HI> 8, the <HI>Arms of Rotterdam</HI> 7, the <HI>Elias</HI> 2, the <HI>Slothony</HI> 7, and the <HI>Stadthouse</HI> 4.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Ketches</HI> are the <HI>Deptford,</HI> carrying 4 Guns; and the <HI>Quaker</HI> 10.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sloops</HI> carry all 4 Guns each; the <HI>Hoys</HI> and <HI>Smacks,</HI> none.</P>
<P>Now, as to our Men of War in particular, 'tis to be observed, that for <HI>Strength</HI> they are Incomparable, being built of English Timber, which is the most excellent for that purpose. For <HI>Beauty</HI> they yield to none, being so pro∣portionably and spaciously built, so curiously and richly adorned, that they seem so many Royal Pallaces amongst other Ships at Sea. And for <HI>Sailing,</HI> they are so well Contrived, that the French took their Model from us; and, for ought I know, were Complimented to it by the late King Charles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal Sovereign,</HI> amongst the rest, being a first Rate Ship, carries 1605 <HI>Tuns,</HI> 815 <HI>Men,</HI> and 100 <HI>Guns.</HI> Her <HI>Length</HI> is 131 foot, <HI>Breadth</HI> 48, <HI>Depth</HI> 49, and <HI>Draught of Water</HI> 23 and an half. She has 18 <HI>Masts</HI> and <HI>Yards,</HI> the <HI>Main Mast</HI> 130 foot long, and 38 inches diameter; the <HI>Main Yard</HI> to it 105 foot long, and 23 inches Diameter; and the <HI>Main-Top,</HI> 15 foot diameter. Her greatest Sail, called <HI>Main-Course</HI> (together with the <HI>Bonnet</HI>) contains 1640 Yards of Ipswich Canvas double.</P>
<PB N="188" REF="296"/>
<P>She has six Anchors, the biggest weighing 6000 pounds, and the least 4300. Of fourteen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ables that belong to them, the greatest being 21 inches in compass, weighs 6000 pound, and the least 8 inches in compass weighs 1300.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Guns,</HI> all of brass, are disposed of in three Tire; viz. in the upper Tire 44, in the second 34, and the lower Tire 22.</P>
<P>She carries a <HI>long Boat</HI> of 50 foot, a <HI>Pinnace</HI> of 36, and a <HI>Skiff</HI> 27 foot long.</P>
<P>The <HI>Britannia,</HI> a new Ship, is much the same; but that she was not perhaps so carefully built as the Royal Sovereign, there being found late∣ly some Defect in the Timber, which is now repairing.</P>
<P>As to the Charge of Building so great a Ves∣sel, together with Guns, Tackle, and Rigging, besides Victualling, 'tis computed at least to 60000 pound. Whereby the Reader may judge of other Ships proportionably. And, for every Month that a first Rate Ship is at Sea, it stands the King in 3500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for Victuals, Ammunition, Wages, Wear and Tear.</P>
<P>For Manning of their Majesties Fleet, Eng∣land is provided with a vast Number of able and stout <HI>Seamen,</HI> who are look'd upon as the chief∣est Bulwark of the Nation. Whom the King by his Prerogative, may press for his Service; as he may Merchants Ships, upon an urgent Occasion.</P>
<P>And, for a constant Supply of Men for thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majesties Service by Sea and Land, the Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has lately raised two <HI>Marine Regiments,</HI> ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> consisting of 1800 Men. Which is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> standing Nursery for Men to be bred up i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Maritime Affairs, in order to serve the Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and their Country either by Sea or Land, as Oc∣casion shall require.

<P>For the Command of a Man of War, there is first a <HI>Captain,</HI> and a <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> whose Pay is thus by the Day. Only 'tis to be observed, that in a sixth Rate Ship the <HI>Captain</HI> is only cal∣led <HI>Master.</HI></P>

<P>Note, that the Charges of the Clerks and In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ruments are included in their Salaries.</P>
<P>All these are under the Direction and Ma∣nagement of the <HI>Navy Office,</HI> kept in the Crouched Friars, London. Where the whole Business concerning the King's Ships is managed by four <HI>principal Officers,</HI> and four <HI>Commissioners of the Navy,</HI> besides other <HI>Commissioners for Victualling the Navy.</HI></P>
<P>The four principal Officers are the <HI>Treasurer, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mptroller, Surveyor,</HI> and <HI>Clerk of the Acts.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Treasurer</HI>'s Office is to pay the Charges of the Navy out of the Exchequer, having first a Warrant for the Mony from the Lords Com∣missioners of the Treasury, and for the Pay∣ment thereof another Warrant from the prin∣cipal Officers of the Navy. His Allowance is 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Comptroller</HI>'s Office is to attend and comptroll all Payments of Wages. He is like∣wise to know all the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rket Rates of all Stores for Shipping, to audit and examine all Treasu∣rers, Victuallers, and Store-Keepers Accounts. His Salary is 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per Annum;</HI> and his <HI>Assistants</HI> 400.</P>
<P>The <HI>Surveyor's</HI> Business is to know the state of all Stores, and see their Wants supplied; to survey the Hulls, Masts, and Yards, and have their Defects repaired at reasonable rates. What Stores the Boatswains and Carpenters receive in order to a Voyage, he is to charge them with by Indenture; and at their return, to state and audit their Accounts. His Salary is 400 l. a Year.</P>
<PB N="192" REF="298"/>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the Acts</HI> is to record all Orders, Contracts, Bills, Warrants, &amp;c. relating to the Navy; and his Salary is 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>pen Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst the four <HI>Commissioners,</HI> one's Pro∣vince is to Comptroll the Victualler's Accounts; another's, the Accounts of the Store-keepers of the Yards; and the two others have the managing of Their Majesties Navy, the one at Chatham, and the other at Portsmouth. The Salary of each is 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>Both the principal Officers and Commissioners hold their Places by Patent, under the Great Seal of England; and have Clerks allowed to each of them, with respective Salaries, for the Dispatch of Business.</P>
<P>The <HI>Commissioners for Victualling the Navy</HI> are commonly four, and their Salary is each 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Navy-Office is subordinate to the <HI>Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty,</HI> as they execute the Office of the Lord High Admiral of England; of whose Power and great Privi∣ledges I have already spoken amongst the Great Officers of the Crown.</P>
<P>For transacting of Maritime Affairs, they keep a Court, called the <HI>Court of Admiralty,</HI> of which in my Third Part. By virtue of their Place, they appoint in divers Parts of the Kingdom several <HI>Vice-Admirals,</HI> with their <HI>Judges</HI> and <HI>Marshals</HI> by Patent, under the Great Seal of the High Court of Admiralty.

<P>In Wales there's but two <HI>Vice-Admiralties,</HI> one in the North, and the other in the South Parts of Wales.</P>
<P>To reflect upon what is past relating to our Naval Force, this (I confess) was much wea∣kened by the late King <HI>Charles</HI> his strange Neg∣lect of Shipping and Seamen, to the great dis∣credit and damage of this Nation. Then, and not till then, the French grew upon us; and grew (like a Weed) so fast, that they have been ever since a great Discouragement and Obstruction to our English Trade. To see those Sea-Mushrooms, the French, dare be so bold as to crow over the English, who would not have Imployed them for <HI>Swabbers</HI> some Years since, 'twere enough to inrage a sensible Nation. But, if one may guess at future Events from the present Disposition of Things, I am apt to think this prodigious <HI>Gallicinium,</HI> or Crowing of the French King, is a Presage of his Fall. And, without Inquiring into the se∣cret Causes of the late unusual and wonderful Tameness of our Fleet, (which gave him the satisfaction to rove a while undisturbed in our Seas) now such Measures are taken as will in all probability make him lower his Top-sail. As for <HI>Tourville</HI> his Admiral's Exploit at <HI>Ting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nouth,</HI> 'tis such as deserves Derision, more than a Tri∣umph.
<PB N="194" REF="299"/><HI>Tingmouth,</HI> a small, open, and obscure Place, the Resort of a few Fishermen who had there some Thatched Houses, was wonder∣fully Stormed, and irresistibly Burnt by this Victorious Fleet. Which, flushed with this great Expedition, and its happy Come-off in the Sea∣fight, sailed few Days after with flying Colours for <HI>Brest. Brest,</HI> which expected great Spoils from the British Shore, and some Return for Millions expended to make this proud Appea∣rance at Sea, wondered to see nothing but their Fleet come short home; some Ships wanting, and others halting, with part of what Men they had left alive half starved, or sick to death, as if they had come from <HI>Terra Incognita.</HI> But the <HI>Paris Gazette</HI> made amends, which celebrated this Expedition at that rate, that one would have thought the Venetians Victory over the Turks in the Gulf of Lepanto fell short of this paultry one. And, to raise the Credit of the great Exploit at <HI>Tingmouth,</HI> there <HI>Tingmouth</HI> was represented as a flourishing Harbour, crowded with Men of War, and Merchant Ships richly laden, of which a Sacrifice was made to the new French Neptune. Thus, by a false and pompous Relation (which indeed sounded much to the glory of a Hamlet) the French Court designed to amuse the World, to raise on the one side the Spirits of the drooping French, and at the same time strike an Aw amongst the Confederates. Which shews what shifts the French are put to in this Juncture of Time, to support their Reputation.</P>
<P>What remains is to give an Account of Their Majesties <HI>Office of Ordnance,</HI> relating to their Forces both by Sea and Land, and Kept within the Tower of London. Which Office concerns
<PB N="195" REF="299"/>all the principal Preparatives and Instruments of War for the Defence and Safety of the King∣dom, and has the ordering and disposing of all the Magazines, as well for Sea as Land.</P>
<P>The principal of these Magazines is the <HI>Tower,</HI> where there are Arms for 60000 Men, and a fine Train of Artillery Kept, with all stores proportionable.</P>
<P>This, and all other Magazines in the King∣dom (as those of <HI>Portsmouth, Plimouth, Windsor-Castle,</HI> &amp;c.) are under the <HI>Master-General of the Ordnance,</HI> a Place of great Trust, and of a general Influence over all the Kingdom. Under whom there are Six principal Officers, and others sub∣ordinate, all holding their Places by Patent un∣der the great Seal.</P>
<P>The principal Officers are

<ITEM>The <HI>Treasurer,</HI> or <HI>Pay-Master.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Lieutenant of the Ordinance</HI> receives at the Board, with the rest of the principal Offi∣cers, all Orders from the Master General, and is to see them duly executed. In the Master General's Absence, he may make Orders upon Occasion, for Things that are not of that high Importance as to require the King's or the Lord High Admiral's Warrants. He is to see the Train of Artillery, and all its Equipage, fitted for Motion upon any Occasion. And from him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssue Orders for the discharging the great Guns,
<PB N="196" REF="300"/>when required, upon Coronation-Days, Festi∣vals, Triumphs, and the like.</P>
<P>The <HI>Surveyor</HI>'s Office is to survey all Their Majesties Ordnance and Stores in the Store-Keeper's Custody, and to see them placed to the best advantage. He is likewise to Keep Checque upon all Labourers and Artificers Works, to see that all Stores brought in be good and serviceable, and to allow all Bills of Debt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the Ordnance</HI> records all Patents and Grants relating to the Office, with the Names of all concerned therein. Also, all In∣structions and Orders sent from the King to the Office, or from the Office abroad; with such Letters, Instructions, Commissions, Deputations, and Contracts as are for His Majesties Service. He draws all Estimates for Provisions and Sup∣plies to be made, makes all Bills of Imprest and Debenturs for Work done, or Provisions re∣ceived, and Keeps Quarter-Books for the Sala∣ries and Allowances of all Persons belonging to the Office. He likewise Keeps Journals of the Receipts, Delivery, and Returns of the King's Stores; which serves as a Checque between the two Accompts of the Office, the one for Mony, and the other for Stores.</P>
<P>The <HI>Keeper of the Stores</HI> has in his particular Charge all the Ordnance and Stores. For the safe Keeping whereof, and giving a true Ac∣count from time to time, he must give good Security. He is to see that all the Kings Store∣houses be well Accommodated, and Kept i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good Repair, and the Stores kept in such O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣der and Lustre as becomes the Service and Ho∣nour of His Majesty. He is bound not to re∣ceive any Provisions but such as have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Surveyed by the Surveyor, and proved by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="197" REF="300"/>Proof-Masters. Nor is he to issue any part of the Ordnance, Munition, or Stores, but what is agreed upon, and signed by the Officers, accor∣ding to the appointment of the Master of the Ordnance, by the Kings Order, or six of the Privy Council; and, if it be for the Use of the Navy, by the Lord Admiral's (or the Com∣missioner's) Warrant. Neither is he to receive back any Stores formerly issued, till they have been reviewed by the Surveyor, and registred in the Book of the Remains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the Deliveries</HI> draws up all Or∣ders and Proportions for delivering any Stores or Provisions at any of Their Majesties Maga∣zines, and is to see the same duly executed. And, for the better discharging of the Store-Keeper, he is by Indenture or Receipt to charge the particular Receiver of the Stores, and to re∣gister both the Warrants for Deliveries and the Proportions delivered.</P>
<P>The <HI>Treasurer,</HI> or <HI>Pay-Master,</HI> makes the Pay∣ments of all the Salaries and Bills of Debt; but so that no Mony is to be by him allowed to any Person, without being listed, or appointed to be paid by the Master General under his hand. So that, except Salaries, all the Mony of the whole Office goes towards Building, Buying in of Stores, Fortifications, and the like; and all this Mony runs through the Pay-Master's hands.</P>
<P>Amongst the Subordinate Officers we may reckon in the first place the <HI>Master Gunner ef England.</HI> Who is to shew the best of his Skill to all that are imploy'd in Gunnery in Their Majesties Service; and, at each ones Admit∣tance, to administer unto him an Oath, which binds him not to serve any forein Prince or
<PB N="198" REF="301"/>State, without Leave, and not to teach any Man the Art of Gunnery but what has taken the said Oath. And, before any one can be actually imployed as Their Majesties Gunner, the said Master must be so well satisfied with his Skill, as to Certify to the Master of the Ordnance his Sufficiency and Ability to discharge the Duty of a Gunner.</P>
<P>Here is also a <HI>Principal Engineer,</HI> to whom are subordinate all the King's other <HI>Engineers.</HI> Most of whom have their Salaries and Allow∣ances out of this Office, from whence they re∣ceive their particular Orders and Instructions, according to the King's Pleasure signified unto them by the Master of the Ordnance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Keeper of the small Guns</HI> is another Offi∣cer relating hereunto. Who has the Charge and Custody of their Majesties small Guns, as Mus∣quets, Carabines, Pistols, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with their Furni∣tures.</P>
<P>I pass by a great Number of inferiour Men imploy'd in this Office; as the <HI>Under-Clerks,</HI> the <HI>Proof-Masters, Messenger,</HI> and great many Arti∣ficers, such as the <HI>Master Gun-smith,</HI> the <HI>Fur∣bisher,</HI> the <HI>Master Smith,</HI> the <HI>Master Carpenter, Master Wheel-Wright,</HI> and others.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Their Majesties present Reve∣nues, and the Management there∣of.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE present publick Revenues of the King and Queen, as they were lately settled by King and Parliament, differ in several Points from the Settlement made in the Reign of Charles II, and Confirmed to the late King James.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the <HI>Excise</HI> (which consists in cer∣tain Impositions upon Beer, Ale, and other Li∣quors) is Settled upon Them for their Lives, and the Life of the Survivor of Them. But out of it a Yearly Rent of 20000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> comes to Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Denmark, and her Issue, during Their Majesties Lives, and the Survivor of Them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Custom</HI> upon Commodities Imported and Exported, which was settled upon King Charles II, and afterwards his Successor, for their re∣spective Lives, is now Confined within the Term of four Years, to commence on the 24th Day of December 1690. And that great Branch of the Revenue, the <HI>Hearth-Mony,</HI> which was for ever Settled in the Crown, to the great Grievance of the People, is now lopt off by Act of Parliament, upon the King's ge∣nerous
<PB N="200" REF="302"/>Motion, for the Relief of His Sub∣jects.</P>
<P>As to Their Majesties other Revenues, I re∣fer you to the Ninth Chapter.</P>
<P>Which, with the Excise and Custom, come to above Twelve hundred thousand Pound a Year, that is about 16 Millions of French Livers. A Revenue which may serve in Time of Peace to Keep up the Honour of the Crown, not to in∣able any Ambitious (or Over-covetous) Prince to Invade the Property and Liberty of the Eng∣glish Subjects, or under a vain Pretence of his own Glory to disturb the Peace and Quiet of his Neighbours. A sad Experience whereof we have seen of late Years by the Practice of that Ambitious Monarch, the French King; whose exorbitant Incomes have helped him to Crush first his Subjects, and then most of his Neighbours.</P>
<P>But, when the Nation is concerned in a fo∣rein War, and the War grounded upon Equity and Honour, the Parliaments of England sel∣dom fail of Supplying the King with <HI>Subsidies</HI> suitable to the present Occasion, by a Land-Tax, Poll-Mony, and such other Ways as they think most convenient.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as the <HI>Custom</HI> and <HI>Excise</HI> are the two principal Branches of Their Ma∣jesties Revenues, let us see how the same are managed, how the Products thereof come into the Exchequer, and are there disposed of by such thrifty Methods, that (all Charges born) it costs the King little above 2 Shillings in the Pound.</P>
<P>For the Managing of the <HI>Custom-Revenue,</HI> there are in the first place at present <HI>Seven Com∣missioners,</HI> who have the Charge and Oversight
<PB N="201" REF="302"/>of all Their Majesties Customs in all Ports of England. Which Customs amount to about 600000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year, whereof the Port of London only pays two Thirds, that is about 400000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Yearly</P>
<P>The said Commissioners sit day by day at the Custom-House, London, They hold their Places by Patent from the King, and have each a Sa∣lary of 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Under these are a great Number of Officers imployed, both at London and in the Out-Ports, some of them of considerable quality and ability. Such as <HI>Collectors, Customers, Comptrol∣lers, Surveyors, Registers, Searchers, Waiters.</HI> &amp;c. whose due Perquisites are so considerable, that to some they are more than their respective Sa∣laries.

<P>There are other considerable Places belonging to this Office, both within Doors and without, which are injoyed and officiated by very suffi∣cient Persons. Particularly the House-Keeper's Place, worth 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per Annum.</HI> And, to col∣lect the Excise-Duty all over the Kingdom, a great Number of Men appointed for that pur∣pose, whose Salary is 20 shill. a Week.</P>
<PB N="203" REF="303"/>
<P>But 'tis Observable, that from the foresaid Commissioners there lies an Appeal to five o∣thers, called the <HI>Commissioners of Appeal,</HI> whose yearly Salary from the King is 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> each.</P>
<P>These, and all other Their Majesties Reve∣nues, are paid at Westminster into the <HI>Exche∣quer,</HI> that Ocean of Treasure, which receives all those Streams, and returns them again to refresh the Kingdom by the constant Payments out of it. Whereby is caused a great Circulation of Mony, throughout the Land.</P>
<P>And, as there are a great many Officers for Collecting the King's Revenues, so there are not a few to Receive and Disburse the same, ac∣cording to His Majesties Order.</P>
<P>The principal Officer is the <HI>Lord Treasurer,</HI> One of the Great Officers of the Crown. Whose Place is sometimes, as it is at this present, managed by Commissioners, appointed by His Majesty.</P>
<P>The next is the <HI>Chancellour of the Exchequer,</HI> an Officer of great Account and Authority; whose Power extends not only in the Exchequer Court, but also here, in the managing and dis∣posing of the King's Revenue. He is Under-Treasurer, has the Exchequer-Seal in his Custo∣dy, and a Superintendency over the Lord Trea∣surer's Roll. The Places of the Comptroller of the Pipe, of the Clerk of the Pleas, the Clerk of the Nichils, and the two Praisers of the Court, besides the Seal thereof, are all in his Gift.</P>
<P>Then there are <HI>two Chamberlains,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their Custody many ancient Records the Standards of Monies, Weights, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and <HI>Doomsday Book,</HI> otherwise called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="204" REF="304"/><HI>Book</HI> of the Exchequer. First Known by the Name of <HI>Rotulus Wintoniae,</HI> and since named <HI>Doomsday Book,</HI> as containing an exact account of all the Lands of England, with the true Value of them, and their Owners Names. So that when this Book was opened upon any Difference, the Cheat appeared, and Judgement was given according∣ly. This Tax-book has been written above 600 Years ago, viz. in the Reign of William the Conquerour, and was six Years a making. The same is Kept under three Locks and Keys, not to be lookt into under 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and for every Line transcribed is to be paid 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR></P>
<P>Under the two Chamberlains are their <HI>Depu∣ties,</HI> who sit in the Tally-Court, where they examine the Tallies; and there is also a <HI>Tally∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utter</HI> attending, this Way of Tallies being found by long experience to be absolutely the best Way to avoid all Cozenage in the Kings Revenue. Which is after this manner;</P>
<P>He that pays any Monies into the Exchequer receives for his Acquittance a Tally, that is, a stick with Words written on it on both sides, containing the Acquittance proper to express what the Mony received is for. This being cloven asunder by the Deputy-Chamberlains, the Stock is delivered to the Party that paid the Mony, the Counter-stock (or Counter-foil) re∣maining with them. Who afterwards deliver it over to other Deputies to be Kept till it be cal∣led for, and joyned with the Stock. After which they send it by an Officer of their own to the Pipe, to be applied to the Discharge of the Accomptant.</P>
<P>Next to the two Chamberlains is the <HI>Auditor of the Receipts,</HI> who files the Bills of the Tel∣lers, whereby they charge themselves with all the Monies received, and upon the Lord High
<PB N="205" REF="304"/>Treasurer's Warrant, or the Lords High Com∣missioners, draws all Orders to be signed by him or them, for Issuing forth all Monies by virtue of Privy Seals. Which Orders are recor∣ded by the Clerk of the Pells, and are entred and lodged in the said Auditor's Office. He also, by Warrant of the Lord Treasurer or Commissio∣ners, makes <HI>Debenturs</HI> to the several Persons, who have Fees, Annuities, or Pensions by Let∣ters Patents from the King out of the Exchequer, and directs them for Payment to the Tellers. He daily receives the state of each Teller's Ac∣count, and weekly certifies the Whole to the Lord High-Treasurer or Lords Commissioners, who immediately present the Ballance to the King. Twice a Year, viz. at Lady-Day and Mi∣chaelmas, he makes an Abstract of all Accounts made in the preceeding Half-Year, whereof he delivers a Copy to the Lord Treasurer, and an∣other to the Chancellour of the Exchequer. He keeps the several Registers, appointed for pay∣ing all Persons in course, upon several Branches of the Kings Revenue. Lastly, he has five <HI>Clerks,</HI> to manage under him the estate of Monies received, disbursed, and remain∣ing.</P>
<P>Next, there are <HI>four Tellers;</HI> whose Office is to receive all Monies due to the King. And, though their Salary from the King be small and inconsiderable, yet they are bound to His Ma∣jesty in 20000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Security, and Keep each of them two <HI>Clerks,</HI> who constantly attend their Offices.</P>
<P>There is moreover a <HI>Clerk of the Pells,</HI> so called from <HI>Pellis</HI> a Skin, his Office being to enter every Teller's Bill into a Parchment Skin. He has two <HI>Clerks</HI> un∣der
<PB N="206" REF="305"/>him, one for Incomes, the other for Issue.</P>
<P>Lastly, there are three <HI>Ushers of the Receipt,</HI> a <HI>Tally-cutter,</HI> and four <HI>Messengers.</HI> The <HI>Ushers</HI> Office is to see the Exchequer secured Day and Night, and to find Paper, Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the Use of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>'Tis observable, that in case of a Gift from the King, or Pension out of his Exchequer, he that receives it pays but 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per Cent.</HI> a∣mongst all the Officers. And out of publick Payments, as for the Navy, Ordnance, Wardrobe, Mint, &amp;c. there goes not amongst them so much as 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>On the other side, for Monies paid in by any of the King's Tenants, it costs them at the most but 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for every Payment under a thousand pounds; and that goes only to the Clerks for their Pains in writing and attend∣ing.</P>

<P>QUeen <HI>Catharine,</HI> the Widow of the late King Charles, and now the third Person in the Kingdom, is the only Sister of <HI>Pedro,</HI> the present King of Portugal. Where she was born, Nov. 14th, 1638; and marrried to the late King Charles, in the Year 1662.</P>
<P>The Portion she brought with her was about 300000 <HI>pounds Sterling,</HI> besides <HI>Tangier</HI> in the Streights upon the Coast of Africk, and the Isle of <HI>Bombay</HI> near Goa in the East-Indies.

<P>Her Majesties <HI>Joynture,</HI> by the Articles of Marriage is 30000 pound a Year. To which King Charles added 10000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> more, which he settled on her Majesty for her Life.</P>
<P>So that the Queen Dowager has 40000 pound a Year, wherewith she keeps a Court suitable to Her Majesty.</P>
<PB N="208" REF="306"/>
<P>The <HI>Princess</HI> Ann of <HI>Denmark,</HI> second Daugh∣ter to the late King James, and only Sister to our Gracious Queen Mary, was born in Febr. 1664. And July 28th 1683 (being <HI>S. Anns</HI> Day) she was married to the Illustrious <HI>Prince George,</HI> the only Brother to <HI>Christiern</HI> V, the present King of Denmark.</P>
<P><HI>His Royal Highness</HI> was born at Copenhagen, the chief City of Denmark, in April 1653. At 15 Years of age he began his Travels into Hol∣land, England, France, and Italy, which lasted about two Years. Being 20 Years old, in the Year 1673, he travelled into Germany, where he saw the Imperial and the French Armies near the Rhine. Anno 1675, his Royal High∣ness served in the War against the Swedes, and was at the taking of Wismar. The next Year he commanded a part of the Danish Army at the Battel of <HI>Lunden</HI> in Schonen, against the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> And in the Year 1677, he commanded again a part of the Danish Army at the famous Battle of landscroon, where he signalized his Valour. Afterwards His Royal Highness made several Voyages into Germany, and continued some Years abroad. And, after his Return into Copenhagen, the Treaty of Marriage with Him and the Lady Ann being set on foot, was happily brought to Conclusion. By which Treaty His Royal Highness is decla∣red to be received as one of the Princes of the Bloud Royal of England; all his Officers and Servants to be from time to time appointed by and with the Approbation of the King of Eng∣land; and his Revenue coming from Denmark to be 17500 pounds sterling Yearly, which is a great Revenue in that Country. The Princesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Portion is 30000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year, to be paid by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="209" REF="306"/>King. To which 20000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per Annum</HI> being lately superadded, and payable out of the Ex∣cise, the whole Yearly Revenue of the Prince and Princess amounts to 67500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling. Where∣with they Keep a Court suitable to their Royal Highnesses.</P>
<P>The Prince has four Sisters. The first mar∣ried to <HI>John George,</HI> the present Elector of Saxo∣ny. The second, to <HI>Christian Adolph,</HI> Duke of Holstein Gottorp. The third, to the late <HI>Elector Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> who died without Issue. And the fourth, to the present King of Sweden, <HI>Charles</HI> XI.</P>
<P>His Brother, the present King of Denmark, has three Sons, and two Daughters. The eldest Son is <HI>Frederick,</HI> the Heir apparent, born in the Year 1671; and the two others are <HI>Christiern,</HI> and <HI>Carolus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Duke of Glocester</HI> is the only Son and Heir of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Prin∣cess of Denmark. He was born July 24th, 1689, and on the 27th he was Christened at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> by the Lord Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and named <HI>William;</HI> the King, and the Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI> Lord Chamberlain of His Majesties Houshold, being Godfathers, and the Lady Marchioness of <HI>Halli∣fax</HI> Godmother.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Nobility of England.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE English <HI>Nobility</HI> is divided into five Degrees. Viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Duke,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Marquess,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Earl,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Viscount,</HI> and</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Baron.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And they are called the <HI>Peerage</HI> of England, because they are all <HI>Peers;</HI> the <HI>Barons</HI> as well as the rest. They have also, all of them, the Title of <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>All these Honours are given by the King, who is the sole Fountain of Honour; and what∣ever Title a Subject of England receives from any forein Prince is not only Insignificant here, but Unwarrantable by Law.</P>
<P>All <HI>Noblemen</HI> at their Creation have two En∣signs, which signify two Duties. Their Heads are adorned, in token that they are to assist their King and Country with good Counsel in time of Peace; and they are girt with a Sword, as be∣ing to support the King and defend the King∣dom with their Lives and Fortunes in time of War.</P>
<P>A <HI>Duke</HI> is created by Patent, Cincture o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sword, Mantle of State, Imposition of A Cap and Coronet of gold on his head, and a Verg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of gold put into his hand. A <HI>Marquess</HI> and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="211" REF="307"/><HI>Earl,</HI> by Cincture of Sword, a Mantle of State, with a Cap and Coronet put upon him by the King himself; and a Patent delivered into his hand. <HI>Viscounts</HI> and <HI>Barons</HI> are made by Pa∣tent, and these sometimes by Writ, where∣by they are called to sit in the House of Lords.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Peers</HI> have Coronets, but with these Distinctions. A <HI>Baron</HI> has six Pearls upon the Circle; a <HI>Viscount,</HI> the Circle of Pearls without number; an <HI>Earl</HI> has the Pearls raised upon Points, and Leaves low between; a <HI>Marquess,</HI> a Pearl and a Strawberry-leaf round, of equal height; and a <HI>Duke,</HI> Leaves without Pearls. On∣ly the <HI>Dukes</HI> of the <HI>Royal Blood</HI> bear (like the Prince of Wales) a Coronet of Crosses and Flower de Luce. Which is the same with the King's, excepting the Arches, Globe, and Cross on the top of the King's Crown.</P>
<P>But the greatest Distinction amongst the <HI>No∣bles</HI> is their Parliament Robes, in their several Gards on their Mantles, and short Cloaks about their Shoulders. For a <HI>Baron</HI> has but two Gards, a <HI>Viscount</HI> two and a half, an <HI>Earl</HI> three, a <HI>Mar∣quess</HI> three and a half, and a <HI>Duke</HI> four. Besides that the Mantle of a <HI>Duke, Marquess,</HI> and <HI>Earl</HI> is faced with Ermine; that of a <HI>Viscount</HI> and <HI>Ba∣ron</HI> with plain white Furr.</P>
<P><HI>Dukes</HI> were at first so called <HI>a ducendo,</HI> being anciently Generals and Leaders of Armies in time of War. <HI>Marquesses,</HI> from their Govern∣ment of Marches, and Frontire-Countries. <HI>Earls,</HI> in Latine <HI>Comites,</HI> because they had the Go∣vernment of Counties. <HI>Viscounts,</HI> in Latine <HI>Vice-Comites,</HI> as being Assistants or Deputies in the Government of Counties. <HI>Barons,</HI> according to Bracton, <HI>quasi Robur Belli;</HI> the safety of the King and People, in Time of War, depending
<PB N="212" REF="308"/>upon their Courage and Skill in Martial Af∣fairs.</P>
<P>Anciently a <HI>Duke</HI> was made so for Term of Life, then held by Lands and Fees; till Dukes came to be Titular and Hereditary. In those Times likewise there was no Earl but had a County or Shire for his Earldom; who, for the support of his State, had the third Peny out of the Sheriffs Court, issuing out of all Pleas of that County whereof he was Earl. Also, those <HI>Barons</HI> only were accounted Peers of the Realm, that held of the King <HI>per integram Baroniam,</HI> which consisted of 13 Knights Fees, and one third part, that is of 400 Marks, each Knights Fee being 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> And whoever had so much was wont to be summoned to Parliament. But then 100 Marks was as much as 2000 pounds at this day, as may be guessed by comparing the Prices of Things. 'Tis true King Henry III, after he had with much ado suppressed his Ba∣rons, called by Writ unto Parliament only such great Men as had continued loyal, or were like so to be. Which Example being followed by his Successors, they only were accounted Peers of the Realm that were so called by the King's special Writ. Till <HI>Barons</HI> came to be made by Pa∣tent, as well as by Writ; and at last most by Patent, which makes it hereditary.</P>
<P>But there are <HI>Barons</HI> in England, that have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> share in the Peerage, as such; viz. the <HI>Barons</HI> of the Exchequer, and the Barons of the Cinque-Ports Such as these the Earls Palatines, and the Eath of England Marches, had anciently under them and such there are yet in Cheshire. The chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Burgesses of London were also called of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Barons.</P>
<PB N="213" REF="308"/>
<P>All <HI>Dukes, Marquesses,</HI> and <HI>Earls</HI> at this day have their respective Titles from some Shire, or part of a Shire, Town or City, Castle, Park, or Village. Except two Earls, whereof one is Officiary, and the other Nominal; the first be∣ing the <HI>Earl Marshal</HI> of England, and the last the <HI>Earl Rivers,</HI> who takes his Denomination from an Illustrious Family.</P>
<P><HI>Barons</HI> are so denominated from their chief Seat, or a Castle belonging to the Family. Which is not to be divided amongst Daughters, if there be no Sons; but must descend to the eldest Daughter.</P>
<P>None of these Honours can be lost but these two Ways. Either by want of Issue male, ex∣cept where the Patent extends to Issue female, as sometimes it does. Or else by some heinous Crime; and then it cannot be restored to the Bloud, but by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>A <HI>Duke</HI> has the Title of <HI>Grace</HI> given him; and the other <HI>Peers,</HI> that of <HI>Lordship</HI> on <HI>Honour.</HI> Accordingly we commonly give to these the Epithet of <HI>Right Honourable.</HI></P>
<P>All Dukes and Marquesses Sons, are called <HI>Lords</HI> by the Courtesy of England, and the Daughters <HI>Ladies.</HI> I say by the Courtesy of Eng∣land; for the Law makes no such Distinction, but looks upon all as Commoners that have no Right to sit in the House of Peers. Of an Earl none but the eldest Son is called <HI>Lord,</HI> though all the Daughters be <HI>Ladies.</HI> And, as for the Issue of Vicounts and Barons, none of their Sons is <HI>Lord,</HI> nor of the Daughters <HI>Lady.</HI></P>
<P>A Dukes eldest Son is called <HI>Lord Marquess;</HI> and the younger Sons by their Christen-names, with the Title of <HI>Lord</HI> prefixt, as <HI>Lord William, Lord Thomas,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="214" REF="309"/>
<P>A Marquesses eldest Son is called Lord of a Place; and the younger Sons, as those of a Duke, that is by their Christen-names with the Title of <HI>Lord</HI> prefixt, as <HI>Lord William, Lord Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>An Earl's eldest Son is born as a Viscount, and called Lord of a Place.</P>
<P>In point of Precedency, this is the Rule. Af∣the Princes of the Bloud, the first amongst the Nobility are the <HI>Dukes,</HI> and these are thus fol∣lowed. Viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Dukes.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Barons younger Sons.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But 'tis to be observed, that all Dukes that are not Princes of the Bloud are preceded by these four Great Officers of the Crown, though they be but Barons; viz. the <HI>Lord Chancellour,</HI> the <HI>Lord Treasurer,</HI> the <HI>Lord President of the Privy Council,</HI> and the <HI>Lord Privy Seal.</HI> I leave out the <HI>Lord High Steward of England,</HI> because none of this Office is continued beyond the present Occasion.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Lord Great Chamberlain of England,</HI> the <HI>Lord High Constable,</HI> the <HI>Lord Marshal,</HI> the <HI>Lord High Admiral,</HI> the <HI>Lord Steward of the King's Houshold,</HI> and the <HI>Lord Chamberlain of the King's Houshold,</HI> they sit above all of their Degree only.</P>
<PB N="215" REF="309"/>
<P>The <HI>Nobility</HI> of England have at all times in∣joyed many considerable Priviledges.</P>
<P>Though neither Civil nor Common Law al∣low any Testimony to be valid but what is gi∣ven upon Oath, yet the Testimony of a Peer of England, given in upon his Honour, without any oath, is esteemed valid. And, whereas the law allows any one of the Commonalty ar∣raigned for Treason or Felony to challenge 35 of his Jury without shewing Cause, and others by shewing Cause; a Peer of the Realm cannot challenge any of his Jury, or put any of them to their Oath, the Law presuming that they be∣ing Peers of the Realm, and judging upon their Honour, cannot be guilty of Falshood, Favour, or Malice.</P>
<P>In Criminal Causes a Peer cannot be tried but by a Jury of the Peers of the Realm; who are not, as other Juries, to be put to their Oath, but their Verdict given in upon their Honour suf∣ficeth.</P>
<P>All Peers of the Realm being lookt upon as the King's constant Counsellors, their Persons are at all Times priviledged from Arrests, except in Criminal Cases. Therefore a Peer cannot be Outlawed in any Civil Action, and no Attach∣ment lies against him. The only Way for sa∣tisfaction from a Peer is by Execution taken forth upon his Lands and Goods, and not by Attachment, or Imprisonment of his Per∣son.</P>
<P>So tender is the Law of the Honour, Credit, Reputation, and Persons of Noblemen, that there is a Statute on purpose, called <HI>Scandalum Magnatum,</HI> to punish all such as by false Reports <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring any scandal upon them.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="310"/>
<P>They are exempted from all Attendance at Leets, or Sheriffs Turns, where others are ob∣liged to take the Oath of Allegiance. And, whereas, for the suppressing of Riots, the She∣riff may raise the <HI>Posse Comitatus;</HI> yet he can∣not command any Peer of the Realm to attend that Service.</P>
<P>In Civil Causes, they are not to be Impanelled upon any Jury or Inquest <HI>de facto,</HI> though in a Matter between two Peers; and, if a Peer be returned upon any such Jury, there lies a special Writ for his Discharge.</P>
<P>They are, upon no Case, to be bound to their good Behaviour, or put to swear they will not break the Peace; but only to promise it upon their Honour, which was ever counted so sacred as upon no terms to be violated.</P>
<P>Every Peer of the Realm summoned to Par∣liament may constitute, in his lawful absence, a Proxy to Vote for him; which none of the Commons may do. And any Peer in a Place of Trust is free to make a Deputy, to act in his ab∣sence, whilst he attends the Person of the King.</P>
<P>Where a Peer of the Realm is Defendant, no Day of Grace is to be granted to the Plaintiff; the Law presuming, that a Peer of the Realm must always be ready to attend the Person of the King, and the Service of the Commonwealth Therefore he ought not to be delayed any lon∣ger than the ordinary Use of the Court, but t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have expedition of Justice.</P>
<P>In any Civil Trial, where a Peer of the Real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is Plaintiff or Defendant, there must be at leas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one Knight returned of the Jury. Otherwis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Array may be quashed by Challenge.</P>
<PB N="217" REF="310"/>
<P>In all Cases wherein the Priviledge of the Clergy is allowed to other Men, and in divers Cases where that Priviledge is taken away from them, a Peer of the Realm, upon his Request, shall be for the first time adjudged as a Clerk Convict, though he cannot read. And that without burning in the Hand, loss of In∣heritance, or Corruption of Bloud.</P>
<P>In case of Amerciaments of the Peers of the Realm upon Non-Suits, or other Judgments, a Duke is to be amerced but Ten Pounds, and all others under Five. This to be done by their Peers, according to <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> though it has been often done of late by the King's Ju∣stices.</P>
<P>A Peer of the Realm, being sent for by the King to Court, Parliament, Council, or Chan∣cery, has the Priviledge, passing by the King's Park or Forest, both coming and returning, to Kill one or two Deer. An Earl has 8 Tun of Wine Custom-free, and the rest proportiona∣bly.</P>
<P>All Peers of the Realm have a Priviledge of Qualifying a certain Number of Chaplains, to hold Plurality of Benefices, with Cure of Souls. But it must be with a Dispensation first obtain∣ed from the Archbishop, and the same ratified under the Great Seal of England. Thus a Duke may qualify six Chaplains, a Marquess and Earl five, a Viscount four, and a Baron <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hree.</P>
<P>A Peer of the Realm has also the Priviledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Retaining six Aliens, whereas another may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot Retain above four.</P>
<P>These are the chief Priviledges belonging to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Nobility of England, which are great and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsiderable. And yet none of them ever had
<PB N="218" REF="311"/>the Priviledge of the Grandees of Spain, to be covered in the King's Presence, except <HI>Henry Ratcliff,</HI> Earl of Surrey. 'Tis true the Princes of the Bloud have often had the honour of be∣ing covered, but then it was by the King's gra∣cious Command, not by virtue of any constant Priviledge.</P>
<P>Neither are our Noblemen exempted, as in France, from <HI>Tailles</HI> and Contributions; but always bear a share proportionable. And, in case of a Poll-Act, they are usually thus Rated, according to their several Degrees of Honour. Viz.

<P>The Nobles to bear up their Rank, have ge∣nerally great and plentiful Estates, some of them
<PB N="219" REF="311"/>beyond those of several Princes beyond Sea. And, till the Civil Wars in the Reign of Charles I. they lived with suitable splendour and Magnisi∣cence; Keeping a plentiful Table, and a nume∣rous Attendance, with several Officers; de∣lighting in noble Exercises, and appearing a∣broad according to their Rank and Quality. Honour and Integrity, Justice and Sobriety, Courage and Wisdom, were Virtues they ex∣celled in. A Lord's House was then lookt upon as a well disciplined Court, where Servants lived not only in Plenty, but in great Order, with the Opportunity of getting good Breeding, and the Prospect of raising themselves in the World by their Lords Bountifulness and innate Gene∣rosity. How far the Case is altered, 'tis but too plain. Yet it is hoped, a virtuous and ge∣nerous Prince will bring back that Golden Age.</P>
<P>But there is an additional Honour, the most ancient <HI>Order of the Garter,</HI> wherein some of the chief of our Nobility have ever had a share, since its first Institution. The Founder of this Order was that warlike and potent Prince, King Edward III, who several times triumphed over France and Scotland. <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> gives it a slight O∣riginal; but his Grounds by his own Confession, grew from the vulgar Opinion. Which is, that Edward III, having obtained many great Victo∣ries (King John of France, and David Bruce of Scotland being both his Prisoners, King Henry of Castille the Bastard expulsed, and Don Pedro restored by Edward the Black Prince) did upon no weighty Occasion first erect this Order, An∣no 1350. Who dancing with the Queen, and other Ladies of the Court, took up a <HI>Garter</HI> that hapned to fall from one of them. Whereat
<PB N="220" REF="312"/>some of the Lords smiling, the King said, that e're it were long he would make that <HI>Garter</HI> to be of high Reputation, and shortly after institu∣ted this Order. A very unlikely Thing, that so noble an Order should be raised on so mean a Foundation.</P>
<P>Whereas, according to <HI>Cambden,</HI> and several others, the Institution of this Order by the fore∣said King Edward was upon his good success in a Skirmish, wherein the King's <HI>Garter</HI> was used for a Token. The Order first Instituted by the Name of the <HI>Order of S. George,</HI> the Patron of England, and of this Order in particular. And, because the <HI>Garter</HI> was the only part of the whole Habit of the Order, made choice of at first to be constantly worn, it came in pro∣cess of Time to be called the <HI>Order of the Gar∣ter.</HI></P>
<P>The same consists of a <HI>Sovereign</HI> (which is always the King of England) and 25 <HI>Companions,</HI> called <HI>Knights of the Garter;</HI> some of them Prin∣ces of other Countries, and the rest Noblemen of this Kingdom. And 'tis observed, that there have been of this Order, since the Institution, no less than 8 Emperours, and 27 or 28 forein Kings, besides many Sovereign Princes of a lower Rank.</P>
<P>The <HI>Garter,</HI> to be daily worn upon the left Leg by the Companions of this Order, is a blue <HI>Garter</HI> deckt with Gold, Pearl, and precious Stones, and a Buckle of gold. They are not to be seen abroad without it, upon pain of paying two Crowns to any Officer of the Or∣der who shall first claim it. Only upon a Journey a blue Ribbon may serve instead of it.</P>
<PB N="221" REF="312"/>
<P>The Meaning of the <HI>Garter</HI> is, to put the Companions of the Order in mind, that, as by this Order they were joyned in a firm League of Amity and Concord, so by their <HI>Garter,</HI> as by a fast Tie of Affection, they are obliged to love one another. Now, to prevent an ill Con∣struction of it, King Edward commanded these French Words to be fixt upon it, <HI>Honi soit qui mal y pense,</HI> that is, Shame be to him that thinks evil of it. And it was done in France, because England being then possessed of a great Part of France, the French Tongue was the u∣sual Language in the King of England's Court.</P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Garter,</HI> the honourable Compa∣nions are to wear at Installations and high Feasts, a <HI>Surcoat,</HI> a <HI>Mantle,</HI> a high black <HI>Velvet Cap,</HI> a <HI>Collar</HI> of pure gold, with other stately and mag∣nificent Apparel. The <HI>Collar</HI> composed of Roses enamelled Red, within a Garter enamelled Blue, with the usual Motto in Letters of gold, and be∣tween each of these Garters a Knot with Tassels of gold.</P>
<P>By an Order made April 1626, they are to wear on the left side of their Upper Garment (whether Cloak or Coat) an <HI>Escutcheon of the Arms of S. George,</HI> that is, the Cross of England incirled with the Garter and Motto, from whence round about are cast Beams of Silver, like the Rays of the Sun in full lustre, which is com∣monly called the <HI>Star.</HI></P>
<P>To this Order belongs a <HI>Colledge,</HI> seated in the Castle of Windsor, with <HI>S. George's Chappel</HI> there erected by King Edward, and the <HI>Chapter∣house.</HI> The <HI>Colledge,</HI> being a Corporation, has a great Seal, and several Officers belonging to it.</P>
<PB N="222" REF="313"/>
<P>The principal of these is the <HI>Prelate of the Garter,</HI> which Office is settled on the Bishop∣rick of Winchester. Next, the <HI>Chanceliour of the Garter,</HI> the Bishop of Salisbury for the time being. A <HI>Register,</HI> the Dean of Windsor. <HI>Gar∣ter,</HI> the principal King at Arms, who manages and marshals their Solemnities at their Installa∣tions and Feasts. And lastly, the <HI>Usher of the Garter,</HI> who is also the Usher of the Black-Rod.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Chappel</HI> there belongs 14 <HI>Secular Ca∣nons,</HI> and 13 Vicars, all Priests. Besides 26 <HI>poor Knights,</HI> maintained by this Colledge, for their Prayers to the Honour of God, and S. George.</P>
<P>The Solemnity of this Order is performed yearly on S. <HI>George's Day,</HI> the 23th of April. As for the Orders and Constitutions belonging to this Society, touching the Solemnities in making these Knights, their Duties after Creation, and their high Priviledges, they are too long to be inserted here.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Gentry of England.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NExt to the Nobility, which is lookt upon as the Flower of the Kingdom, let us take a View of the English <HI>Gentry,</HI> cal∣led by some the lesser (or lower) Nobility, and Keeping a middle Rank betwixt the Nobles and the Common People. Of these there are three Degrees; <HI>Knights, Esquires,</HI> and <HI>Gentle∣men.</HI></P>
<P>We have now but three sorts of Knights in England, besides the Knights of the Garter. Viz. <HI>Baronets, Knights of the Bath,</HI> and <HI>Knights Bat∣chelours.</HI></P>
<P>The Degree of <HI>Baronets</HI> is the next to Ba∣rons, and the only Degree of Knighthood that is Hereditary. An Honour first Instituted by King James I, Anno 1611, conferred by a Patent upon a Man, and his Heirs Males of his Body lawfully begotten. The Purchase of it does commonly arise, Fees and all, to 1200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the Purchaser being to pay, besides the Fees, as much Mony as will pay for 3 Years 30 Foot-Souldiers at 8 pence a Day, to serve in the Pro∣vince of Ulster in Ireland. Therefore they have the Priviledge to bear in a Canton of their Coat of Arms, or in a whole Scutcheon, the Arms of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lster,</HI> viz. in a Field <HI>Argent</HI> a Hand <HI>Gules.</HI> In the King's Armies, they have place in the
<PB N="224" REF="314"/>gross near the King's Standard. And for their Funerals they have also particular Privi∣ledges.</P>
<P>The whole Number of them, by the first In∣stitution; is not to exceed 200 at one and the same time. After which Number compleated, as any one for want of Heirs come to be ex∣tinct, the Number is not to be made up by new Creations, but be suffered to diminish, as appears by their Patent. And yet the very Founder, King James I, transgressed the first his Rule, by creating 203. Charles, his next Successor, made 455. But King Charles II, outdid them both, by creating near upon 900 during his Reign. At this time there are reckoned above 700 li∣ving.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Nicholas Bacon</HI> of Suffolk was the first <HI>Ba∣ronet</HI> created, whose Successor is therefore stiled <HI>Primus Baronettorum Angliae.</HI></P>
<P>No Honour is ever to be created between Ba∣rons and Baronets.</P>
<P>As for the other two Degrees of <HI>Knighthood,</HI> they are but Personal, and not Hereditary; so that the Honour dies with the Person Knighted, and descends not to his Son.</P>
<P><HI>Knights of the Bath</HI> are so called, from their Bathing the Night before the Creation within the Lists of the Bath. The first of this sort were made by Henry IV; but now they are usually made at the Coronation of a King or Queen, or Creation of a Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>They wear a Scarlet Ribbon Belt-wise; and take place of Knights Batchelours, but come af∣ter Baronets. There are but a few Knights of this Order.</P>
<P><HI>Knights Batchelours</HI> are the lowest sort of Knights, and the most common. Anciently this Degree was in greater esteem than it is at the
<PB N="225" REF="314"/>present, when it was only conferred upon Sword∣men for their military Service, who from the Gilt Spurs usually put upon them were called in Latine <HI>Equites Aurati.</HI> Whereas now a days this Honour is also bestowed upon Gown-men, viz. Lawyers and Physicians. And all the Ce∣remony used in their Creation is their Kneeling down before the King, and His Majesties lightly touching them on the shoulder with a naked Sword.</P>
<P>Anciently there was another Sort of Knights now disused, I mean the <HI>Knights Bannerets,</HI> who were Knighted in the Field. This Order was accounted very honourable, had the precedency of the Knights of the Bath, and bore their Arms with Supporters, which was not allowed to any under this Degree.</P>
<P>Next to Knights are the <HI>Esquires,</HI> so called from the French <HI>Escuyer,</HI> this from the Latine <HI>Scutiger;</HI> which Name was given of old to him that attended a Knight in time of War, and carried his Shield. Whereas Esquire with us is a meer Title of Dignity next to and below a Knight, and signifies a Gentleman, or one that beareth Arms as a Testimony of his Nobility and Gentry.</P>
<P>They who by right claim this Title now are all the younger Sons of Noblemen; and, by the Common Law of England, their very eldest Sons are Esquires, and no more. Next are the Esquires of the King's Body, the eldest Sons of Noblemens younger Sons, Knights eldest Sons, and their elder Sons for ever. Next, Esquires created by the King, by putting about their Necks a Collar of S's, and bestowing on them a pair of Silver Spurs.</P>
<PB N="226" REF="315"/>
<P>Those that are reputed, or lookt upon as e∣qual to Esquires, tho none of them be really so, are several Magistrates, and Officers in the King's Court; as Judges, Sergeants at Law, Sheriffs, Mayors, Justices of the Peace, Coun∣sellors at Law, and the principal Commanders of an Army. So Heads of Houses in the Uni∣versities, Doctors of Law, Physick, and Musick, usually take place next to Knights, and before ordinary Gentlemen.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Gentlemen</HI> are properly such as are de∣scended of a good Family, bearing a Coat of Arms, without any particular Title. And these we call Gentlemen born.</P>
<P>But Use has so far stretched the signification of this Word, both high and low, that every Nobleman, nay the King himself, may be cal∣led a Gentleman. And, on the other side, any one that, without a Coat of Arms, has either a liberal, or genteel Education, that looks Gentle∣man-like (whether he be so, or not) and has wherewithall to live freely and handsomely, is by the Courtesy of England usually called a Gentleman. Others, by their Offices, are lookt upon as such; particularly most of the King's Menial Servants, and the principal Officers in Noble-mens Families, &amp;c. The Military Profession, which has been always counted Noble, seems to give the very meanest Professors of it a Title to this Quality. But it is more particularly adapted to two distinct Bodies of the King's Guards; the one called <HI>Gentlemen Pensioners,</HI> who gard his Per∣son within Doors; and the other the <HI>Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of the Guard,</HI> by whom is meant his Body of Horse Guards, who gard the Kings Person on horseback without Doors.</P>
<PB N="227" REF="315"/>
<P>As in Germany all Noblemens, so in England all Gentlemens Arms descend to all the Sons a∣like. Only the eldest Son bears Arms without difference, which the younger may not.</P>
<P>Besides above 700 Knights Baronets, and the few Knights of the Bath, there are reckoned to this day above 1400 ordinary Knights, and 6000 Esquires and Gentlemen; whose younger Bro∣thers in all may make up at least 12000 all over England. And the Land in the Possession of them all has been computed to amount at least to four Millions yearly.</P>
<P>The Law of England, which is so Favourable to the Nobility, has not a proportionable Regard for the Gentry. For, whether they be Knights, Esquires, or Gentlemen, they are all reckoned by law, even Noblemens Sons, amongst the Com∣mons of England. So that the eldest Son of a Duke, though by the Courtesy of England stiled an Earl, shall be Arraigned (if charged with a Crime) by the Title of Esquire only, and tried by a Jury of Common Free-holders. In Parlia∣ment he can sit only in the House of Commons, if elected, unless he be called by the King's Writ to the House of Lords.</P>
<P><HI>Knights</HI> are distinguished in England by the Title of <HI>Sir</HI> prefixt to their Christen names. And Gentlemen have no other Title but that of <HI>Master</HI> when spoken of; and that of <HI>Sir,</HI> when spoken to. But, if one writes to an Esquire, the Direction ought to be thus, as <HI>To Thomas Whit∣field Esquire.</HI></P>
<P>The Epithet of <HI>Honourable</HI> is usually given to any Knight, Esquire, or Gentleman, distinguish∣ed by some eminent and personal Worth.</P>

<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="316"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Commonalty of England.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the Commonalty I mean Yeomen, Mer∣chants, Artificers, Tradesmen, Mariners, and all others getting their Livelyhood after a Mechanick Way.</P>
<P><HI>Yeomen</HI> are such amongst the Commonalty who having Land of their own to a good value, Keep it in their own hands, husband it them∣selves, and live with their Families upon it. They are therefore by the Law called <HI>Freeholders,</HI> be∣cause they hold Lands or Tenements Inheritable by a perpetual Right to them and their Heirs for ever. Their Number is great in England, and many of them have Estates fit for Gentlemen. Forty or Fifty pounds a Year is ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ordinary, 100 or 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a Year in some Counties is not rare, in Kent there are those who have 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and some more <HI>per Annum.</HI> Which is not easy to be found amongst Men of this Rank any where else in Europe.</P>
<P>And, whereas Husbandry is commonly lookt upon as the most innocent Life, and the freest from the Corruption and Cheats that attend o∣ther Professions, therefore the Law of England has a better Opinion of the Yeomanry that oc∣cupy Lands, than of Tradesmen or Artificers. And accordingly Yeomen are capable of bearing
<PB N="229" REF="316"/>some Offices, as of Constable, and Church-War∣den, to serve upon Juries, to be Train-Soul∣diers, to vote in the Election of Knights of the Shire to serve in Parliament, &amp;c. And, by the Statutes of England, certain Immunities are gi∣ven to Freeholders and Land-men, tho they are not Gentlemen.</P>
<P>Next to Freeholders are the <HI>Copy-holders,</HI> who are much of the same nature. I mean those <HI>Copy∣holders,</HI> that hold Copy-holds certain. Which is a kind of Inheritance, in many Places called <HI>Customary;</HI> because the Tenant dying, and the Hold being void, the next of Bloud, paying the Customary Fine (as two Shillings for an A∣cre, or such like) may not be denied his Admis∣sion. They are called <HI>Copy-holders,</HI> from the Copy of Court-Roll of the Mannor within which they hold their Land, by which Copy only they hold it. For this is all a <HI>Copy-holder</HI> has to shew for his Title, which he takes from the Steward of the Lord of the Mannor's Court.</P>
<P>But, as England is one of the most trading Countries in Europe, so the greatest Body of its Commonalty is that of <HI>Traders,</HI> or Men that live by Buying and Selling.</P>
<P>The most eminent whereof are those we call <HI>Merchants,</HI> who trade only by Whole-sale. These are the Men who, by their Stock and Industry, have found the Way, not only to Inrich them∣selves, but to make the whole Nation thrive and flourish by a perpetual Circulation of Trade, by exporting home-bred and importing forein Commodities, by incouraging thereby Naviga∣tion, and by procuring comfortable Imployment to a vast Number of Artificers, Tradesmen, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etailers.</P>
<PB N="230" REF="317"/>
<P>In short, such is the benign Influence of Trade and Commerce by their means all over the Nation, that there is scarce any part of it but feels the Benefit thereof. And for this great Advantage to the Publick, as well as their pri∣vate Wealth, they have got a proportionable esteem and respect from the rest of the Nation. Insomuch that, whereas Trading formerly ren∣dred a Gentleman ignoble, now an ignoble Person makes himself by Merchandizing as good as a Gentleman; and many Gentlemen Born (some of them Younger Sons of Noble∣men) take upon them this Profession, without any prejudice or blemish to their Birth. Nay, the Law of England, that ever had but a slight Opinion of Traders, is so far Obliterated in this Point by Custom and Interest, that, whereas by Law a Ward come to Age may bring his Action of Disparagement against his Gardian for offering any such in Marriage, now 'tis common for Gentlemens and Merchants Sons and Daugh∣ters to Intermarry.</P>
<P>The truth is, Gentility with competent Means is an excellent Compound; but with∣out it, 'tis but a wretched Condition, as the World goes now. And who would not rather be a substantial honest Trader, so as to stand upon his own Legs, and make some figure in the World, than for want of Imployment to starve with a point of Honour, or live a bor∣rowed Life; in this Age especially, where Po∣verty is so little pitied, and grown so contemp∣tible?</P>
<P>Poverty (says an Author) the general Scare∣crow of Mankind, the fear of which keeps Men in perpetual Morion, and makes them run head∣long into the greatest Dangers.</P>
<PB N="231" REF="317"/>
<Q>Per Mare Pauperiem fugiunt, per Saxa, per Ignes.</Q>
<P>Poverty, a lingering kind of Death, that, having once seized upon ones Spirits, dejects and stupifies him, takes away the edge of his Senses, weakens his Memory, discomposes his Mind, and makes him almost uncapable of any Thing. Poverty, in a Word, that turns Men into ridicule, as <HI>Juvenal</HI> has it in these Words,
<Q><L>—Nil habet Paupertas durius in se,</L>
<L>Quam quod Ridiculos homines facit—</L></Q></P>
<P>In France indeed, where if a Gentleman born betakes himself to Trade forfeits his Gentility, the Gentry stand so much upon their Honour, that it is very rare to see a French Gentleman turn to Merchandizing. But there they have greater Opportunities for preferring themselves according to their quality, especially by the Way of Arms. And so jealous is the whole Body of them of this their Gentility, that rather than have it exposed in any of their Members by naked and hungry Poverty, their Way is to help one another to the utmost of their Power, and (which is very commendable) they seldom fail to give a Gentleman, though never so needy, the Respect due to his Birth. But it is something surprizing, they should so much decline Mer∣chandizing, their King <HI>Lewis le Grand,</HI> not to mention his other Commodities, being the greatest Salt-Merchant in the Known World,</P>

<P>But, to return to our <HI>Commonalty,</HI> it may be said to comprehend three Parts in four of the Nation, the Generality of them Imployed in Husbandry, Trade, and Navigation, some in a higher, others in a lesser Degree.

<P>They are subject to no Taxes or Laws, but what they contrive themselves by their Repre∣sentatives in Parliament. And, in point of Trials, none of them can be Tried but by a Jury of his Peers, that is, by Twelve Men Com∣moners like himself. Nor can he be Condemned but by the Laws of the Land.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Clergy of England, and first of the Bishops.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Clergy of England is, like the Laity, divided into several Ranks, or Degrees. For as the Laity consists of Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty; so the Clergy is divided into Bishops, Dignitaries, and Inferious Clergy.</P>
<PB N="233" REF="318"/>
<P>The <HI>Bishops</HI> are those who take upon them the Government of the Church of England, ac∣cording to Law, every one in his Diocese. And, as England consists of 26 Dioceses, or Bishopricks, so there are accordingly 26 Bishops, or Diocesans. Besides the Bishoprick of the Isle of Man, which is a distinct Bishoprick.</P>
<P>Their Office being <HI>Pastoral,</HI> their Business is to feed their Flocks with the wholsom Doctrine of the Church, and so to oversee the Inferiour Clergy that by their Lives and Doctrine the People may Keep the Truth, and live according to the Rules of Christianity.</P>
<P>And, as each of them has a Canonical Au∣thority over all the Priests of his Diocese, so they have all in chief the <HI>Power of Ordination;</HI> Which however is never performed but by the Bishop joyntly with some other Priests.</P>
<P>They are also Impowred to grant Institutions to Benefices upon Presentations of other Patrons, to command Induction to be given, to order the collecting and preserving of the Profits of va∣cant Benefices for the Successors Use.</P>
<P>They are bound to defend the Church-Liber∣ties, and once in three Years to Visit each his Diocese. In this triennial Visitation they Inquire of the Manners, Carriages, and Offences of Mi∣nisters, Church-Wardens, and the rest of the Parishioners, principally of Offenders against Justice, Piety, and Sobriety. Wardens of Hos∣pitals, Physicians, Chirurgeons, Schoolmasters, and Midwives fall particularly under the Care of their Visitation.</P>
<P>Of the foresaid 26 Bishops, there are two called <HI>Archbishops,</HI> the one of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the other of <HI>York.</HI> These have a Superintenden∣cy over all the Church of England, and in some measure over the other Bishops.</P>
<PB N="234" REF="319"/>
<P>They have each of them his <HI>Province,</HI> or Ju∣risdiction; but that of <HI>Canterbury</HI> is much the greater of the two. For, of 26 Dioceses, it takes up 22. Whereof 18 in England, viz. <HI>Canterbury, Lon∣don, Winchester, Lincoln, Exeter, Hereford, Salisbury, Coventry</HI> and <HI>Lichfield, Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells, Oxford, Chichester, Ely, Norwich, Carlisle, Worcester, Glo∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster, Bristol, Peterborough;</HI> and four in <HI>Wales,</HI> viz. <HI>S. Asaph, Landaff, Bangor,</HI> and <HI>S. Davids.</HI> Whereas the Province of <HI>York</HI> has but four Dio∣cesses, <HI>York, Durham, Chester,</HI> and <HI>Carlisle;</HI> be∣sides that of the <HI>Isle of Man.</HI></P>
<P>Each of these Archbishops is called <HI>Primate</HI> of England, and <HI>Metropolitan</HI> of his Province. Yet the first has some kind of Supereminency over the other, and has Power to Summon him to a National Synod.</P>
<P>Next to the two Archbishops are the Bishops of <HI>London, Durham,</HI> and <HI>Winchester;</HI> the Order of the rest being by no other Rule than the Priority of their Consecration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bishop of London</HI> has the Precedency of all the other Bishops, not only as being Bishop over the Metropolis of England, but as Provincial Dean of Canterbury. And, upon the Vacancy of the Archiepiscopal See, the Bishop of London has been usually translated to that See; except∣ing the Case of Dr. <HI>William Sandcroft,</HI> the pre∣sent Archbishop of Canterbury, who from Dean of Paul's was preferred to this Dignity by King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bishop of Durham</HI> has been a Count Pa∣latine six or seven hundred Years. The common Seal of his Bishoprick has been of a long time an <HI>Armed Knight,</HI> holding in one hand a <HI>Naked Sword,</HI> and in the other a <HI>Church.</HI> He has also at this day the Earldom of <HI>Sadberg,</HI> annexed long ago to this Bishoprick.</P>
<PB N="235" REF="319"/>
<P>The Bishop of Winchester was anciently re∣puted Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and so stiled by Hen∣ry VIII, in the Statutes of the Honourable Or∣der of the Garter. But that Earldom was soon after disposed of.</P>
<P>The Manner of making a Bishop in England is so solemn, that it is not to be pretermitted. When a Bishops See becomes vacant, first the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral give notice of it to the King, as the Patron of all the Bishop∣ricks in England; and humbly request his Ma∣jesty, that He will give them Leave to chuse a∣nother. Whereupon the King grants them his <HI>Conge d'eslire,</HI> that is, Leave to elect; and withal does usually recommend unto them whom His Majesty thinks fit. Then the Dean summons a Chapter, that is, the Prebendaries of the Cathe∣dral; who either elect the Person recommended by the Kings Letters, or shew Cause to the con∣trary. The Election being over, it is certified to the Party elected. Who does modestly refuse it the first and second time; if a third time, the same is certified to the King, who recommends another. When the Election is accepted, it is cer∣tified to the King, and the Archbishop of that Province. The King thereupon gives his Royal Assent under the Great Seal of England, which is exhibited to the Archbishop of that Province, with Command to confirm and consecrate him. Then the Archbishop subscribes <HI>Fiat Confirmatio,</HI> and gives. Commission under his Episcopal Seal to his Vicar General, to perform all the Acts thereunto required.</P>
<P>Then a Citation comes forth from the said Vi∣car General in the Name of the Archbishop, summoning all the People that have any Thing to object against the Party elected to appear at a
<PB N="236" REF="320"/>certain Time and Place, to make their Objecti∣ons. Which is done first by Proclamation three several times, at Bow-Church; and then the Citation is affixt on the Church door for all people to read. At the Day and Place assigned for the Opposers Appearance, the Vicar General sit∣ting as Judge, the Proctor for the Dean and Chapter exhibits the Royal Assent, and the Com∣mission of the Archbishop. Which being read and accepted by the Vicar General, the Proctor exhibits the Proxy from the Dean and Chapter, presents the Bishop elect, returns the Citation, and desires the Opposers to be called in three times. This being done accordingly, and none appearing, they are pronounced Contumacious; and a Decree made to proceed to Sentence, in the behalf of the Bishop elect. Who thereupon takes the Oaths of Supremacy, Simony, and Ca∣nonical Obedience; and then the Judge of the Arches reads and subscribes the Sentence. After which there is usually an Entertainment made for the Officers and other there present. And the Bishop elect, being thus Confirmed, may act as Bishop, even before he is Consecrated.</P>
<P>Some time after this follows the Consecration. For the Bishops are a distinct Order of them∣selves, there being three Orders in the Church of England, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. And, as none may be admitted a Deacon (without a Dispensation) under the Age of 23 Years, nor a Priest under 24; so none can be made a Bishop, till he be full 30 Years of age. And, whereas Priests and Deacons, when they take their re∣spective Orders, are said to be Ordained; a Bi∣shop, when he takes the Episcopal Order, is said to be Consecrated.</P>
<P>The Consecration is performed by the Arch∣bishop of the Province, or some other Bishop
<PB N="237" REF="320"/>Commissioned by him, with the Assistance of two other Bishops, either in the Chappel of the Archbishop, or of any other Bishop. And it is done either upon a Sunday or Holy-day, after Morning-Service. Then the Archbishop (or his Deputy) begins the Communion-Service. And, after a certain Prayer appointed for this Occa∣sion, one of the Bishops present reads the Epistle 1 Tim. 3, another the Gospel John 21. Which is followed by the Nicene Creed, and next to that a Sermon. After Sermon, the Bishop elect, being vested with his Rochet or Linnen-Gar∣ment, is by two Bishops presented to the Arch∣bishop, or his Deputy, sitting in his Chair; who demands the King's Mandate for the Consecra∣tion, and causes it to be read. That done, the Bishop elect takes the Oath of Supremacy, and of Canonical Obedience to the Archbishop. After which, they fall to Prayers. Then the Bishop elect does Answer several Interrogatories that are put to him; and, after his Answers, the rest of the Episcopal Habit is put upon him. This done, they Kneel down to Prayers again. Which being ended, the Bishop elect being upon his Knees, the Archbishop and Bishops there present lay their Hands on his Head, and by a pious grave Form of Words they Consecrate him. After∣wards the Archbishop delivers a Bible to the Bishop elect, with another set Form of Words. Then they all proceed to the Communion; and having received the Sacrament, they depart with the Blessing.</P>
<P>Then the new Bishop treats at a spelendid Din∣ner, the chief of the Nobility, Clergy, Judges, Privy Counsellours, &amp;c. Which Dinner (with the Fees of Consecration) does usually amount to five or six hundred Pounds.</P>
<PB N="238" REF="321"/>
<P>Next to the Consecration of a Bishop follow his Installation, by virtue of a Mandate from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Arch-Bishop to the Arch-Deacon of his Pre∣vince. This is performed in the Cathedral Church upon any Day between the hours of nine and ele∣ven, in the presence of a publick Notary. Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Bishop elect, or his Proxy (which is most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sual) is introduced into the Cathedral by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Arch-Deacon, or his Proxy, There he declaies i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the first place his Assent to the King's Supremacy and swears that, unless he be otherwise Dispe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sed with, he will be Resident according to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Custom of that Cathedral, and observe the Cu∣stoms of the said Church, and cause others to ob∣serve the same. Whereupon the Arch-Deacon with the Petty-Canons, and Officers of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Church, accompany the Bishop up to the Quin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and there place him in a Seat prepared for him between the Altar and the right side of the Quine Then the Arch-Deacon pronounces these Word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Latine, <HI>Ego, Authoritate mihi commissa, Induco &amp; Inthronizo Reverendum in Christo Patrem Domin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> N.

<P>After Prayers, the Bishop is conducted in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Chapter-house, and there placed on a hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Seat.

<PB N="239" REF="321"/>
<P>Afterwards the new Bishop is introduced into be Kings Presence, to do his Homage for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emporalities or Barony. Which he does by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeling down before the King sitting in a Chair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f State, by putting his Hands between his Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sties Hands, and by taking a Solemn Oath to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e true and faithful to Him, and that he holds is Temporalities of him.</P>
<P>After this, he Compounds for the first Fruits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his Bishoprick, that is, agrees for his first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears Profits to be paid to the King, within two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears or more, if the King please.</P>
<P>When a Bishop is Translated from one Bishop∣ick to another, all the Difference there is in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranslation from the manner of making a Bi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op is, that there is no Consecration. And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen a Bishop is made Archbishop, the Diffe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce is only in the Commission, which is directed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King to four Bishops, or more to Confirm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Now there is this Difference between an Arch∣ishop and a Bishop, that, whereas a Bishops Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ical Authority reaches no further than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unds of his Diocese, the Archbishops Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tends it self over all his Province, so that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ordinary to all the Bishops thereof.

The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishop can Convocate only a Diocesan, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rehbishop may Convocate a Provincial Synod.

<P>'Tis Observable that, several Bishops of Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd having large Bishopricks, it was provided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Statute made in the Reign of Henry VIII, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at they should have a Power to Nominate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to the King to be with his Approbation,

The Sees of those Suffragan Bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were only to be, at <HI>Dover,</HI> for the Diocese o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Canterbury; at <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Hull,</HI> for tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of York. For the Diocese of London, at <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣chester;</HI> of Durham, at <HI>Berwick;</HI> of Winchester, in the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> at <HI>Southampton,</HI> and <HI>Guilford</HI> For the Diocese of Lincoln, at <HI>Bedford, Leicester Huntington,</HI> and <HI>Grantham;</HI> of Norwich, at <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ford</HI> and <HI>Ipswich;</HI> of Salisbury, at <HI>Shaftsbury, Mel∣ton,</HI> and <HI>Marlborough;</HI> of Bath and Wells, at <HI>Taun∣ton;</HI> of Hereford, at <HI>Bridgenorth;</HI> of Coventry and Lichfield, at <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> of Ely, at <HI>Cam∣bridge;</HI> of Exeter, at <HI>S. Germans;</HI> of Carlisle, at <HI>Perith.</HI> Now for any one of the foresaid Places appointed for Suffragan Bishops Sees the respec∣tive Bishop of the Diocese presented two able Men, whereof the King chose one.</P>
<P>These Suffragan Bishops had the Name, Title, and Dignity of Bishop, and (as other Bishops) were Consecrated by the Archbishop of the Pro∣vince. They executed each of them such Power, Jurisdiction, and Authority, and received such Profits as were limited in their Commissions by the Bishops (or Diocesans) whose Suffragans they were. In these Bishops absence, when they were either residing at Court to advise the King, or imployed upon Embassies abroad, the Suffragans usually supply'd their Places. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in publick Assemblies, took place next after the Temporal Peers of the Realm. But since the Diocesan Bishops grew less Courtiers, and more Residentiary, the Suffragan Bishops began to be laid aside, so that there have been none for ma∣ny Years in the Church of England.</P>
<PB N="241" REF="322"/>
<P>I come now to the Prerogatives, Priviledges, Bower, Revenues, and great Deeds of Bi∣shops.</P>
<P>All the Bishops of England are Barons and Peers of the Realm, and sit as such in the House of Lords. They are the Spiritual Lords, lookt upon as the Fathers (or Gardians) of the Church, and therefore commonly stiled <HI>Right Reverend Fathers in God.</HI> And, as 'tis usual in England for well-bred Children to ask their Pa∣rents Blessing Morning and Evening, with one Knee upon the Ground; so the true Sons of the Church, looking upon the Bishops as their Spiri∣tual Fathers, commonly begin their Addresses to them by asking their Blessing in the same respectful manner.</P>
<P>Besides the Priviledges injoy'd by Bishops, as Peers, and therefore common with those of the Temporal Lords, they have some peculiar Pre∣rogatives, and those of a high nature. 'Tis unde∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iable, that all Jurisdiction in England is insepa∣rably annexed to the Crown. And yet the Bi∣shops Courts, tho held by the King's Authority, are not counted to be properly the King's Courts. Therefore the Bishops send forth Writs in their own Names, <HI>Teste</HI> the Bishop, and not in the King's Name, as all the King's Courts properly so called do.</P>
<P>And, whereas in other Courts there are seve∣ral Judges to each, a Bishop in his Court judges, and passes Sentence alone by himself.</P>
<P>A Bishop besides has this transcendent Privi∣ledge, that he may (as the King does) depute his Authority to another, as to a Bishop Suffra∣gan, his Chancellour, or Commissary. Which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one of the King's Judges can do.</P>
<PB N="242" REF="323"/>
<P>Bishops, in whatsoever Christian State they come, their Episcopal Dignity and Degree is acknow∣ledged; and may, as Bishops, confer Orders, &amp;c. Whereas no Temporal Lord is in Law acknow∣ledged such out of the Prince's Dominions who conferred his Honour.</P>
<P>The Law of England attributes so much to the Word of a Bishop, that, not only in the Trial of Bastardy, the Bishops Certificate shall suffice, but also in Trial of Heresy, which toucheth a Mans Life.</P>
<P>If a Clergy-man Kills his Bishops or Ordinary, the Law looks upon it as a Parricide; and 'tis Petty-Treason, by Law.</P>
<P>Every Bishop may by Statute Law qualify six Chaplains, which is as many as a Duke.</P>
<P>But, if the Bishops Priviledges be so great, the <HI>Archbishops</HI> are much greater, especially his Grace of Canterbury's. Who is the first Peer of the Realm, and next to the Royal Family precedes not only all Dukes, but all the great Officers of the Crown.</P>
<P>Though he holds his Place from the King, yet in the King's Writs to him he is stiled <HI>Dei Gratia Archiepiscopo Cantuariensi;</HI> and, whereas other Bishops write <HI>Divina Permissione,</HI> he writes him∣self <HI>Divina Providentia.</HI> When he is Invested in the Archbishoprick, he is said to be Inthro∣ned.</P>
<P>It belongs properly to him to Crown the King; and he had formerly the Power of appointing the Lent Preachers, which is now in the Lord High Chamberlain.</P>
<P>The Bishop of London is accounted his <HI>Pra∣vincial Dean,</HI> the Bishop of Winchester his <HI>Chan∣cellour,</HI> and the Bishop of Rochester his <HI>Chap∣lain.</HI></P>
<PB N="243" REF="323"/>
<P>He has the <HI>Probate</HI> of all Wills in his Province, and the Power of granting <HI>Letters of Administra∣tion,</HI> where the Party at the time of his Death had 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> worth (or above) out of the Diocese wherein he died, or 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> within the Diocese of London. For all such as die <HI>Intestate</HI> within his Province he has Power to make Wills, and to administer their Goods to the Kindred, or to pi∣ous uses, according to his Discretion.</P>
<P>In all Cases heretofore sued for in the Court of Rome he has Power to grant <HI>Licences</HI> and <HI>Dispen∣sations,</HI> either by himself, or his Deputy, called the <HI>Master of Faculties;</HI> Provided the same be not repugnant to the Law of God, or the King's Pre∣rogative. As to allow a Clerk to hold a Benefice in <HI>Commendam</HI> or Trust; to allow a Son (contra∣ry to the Canons) to succeed his Father immedi∣ately in a Benefice; a Beneficed Clerk, upon some Occasions, to be Non-resident for some time; a Clerk rightly qualified to hold two Benefices with Cure of Souls; and a Lay-man to hold a Prebend, &amp;c. whilst by Study he is preparing himself for the service of the Church.</P>
<P>He may also bestow one Dignity or Prebend in any Cathedral Church within his Province, upon every Creation of a new Bishop. And the new-created Bishop is also to provide a sufficient Benefice for one of the Archbishops Chaplains, or to maintain him till it be effected.</P>
<P>He has the Prerogative, with two other Bishops, to Consecrate a new made Bishop; to appoint Coadjutors to infirm Bishops; to confirm the E∣lection of Bishops within his Province; to call Provincial Synods according to the King's Writ directed to him; to be Moderator in the Synods or Convocations, and there to give his Suffrage last of all. 'Tis both his Power and Duty to Visit
<PB N="244" REF="324"/>the whole Province; and, during the Vacancy of any Bishoprick within the same, to appoint a Guardian of the Spiritualities. So that to him be∣long all the Episcopal Rights and Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions of the Diocese, as Visitations, Insti∣tutions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To decide all Differences in Ecclesiastical Matters, he holds several <HI>Courts of Judicature,</HI> for which I refer you to my Third Part.</P>
<P>Lastly, he may retain and qualify 8 <HI>Chaplains,</HI> which is two more than any Duke is allow∣ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Archbishop of York</HI> has also the Precedence of all Dukes that are not of the Royal Bloud; and of all great Officers of State, except only the Lord Chancellour.</P>
<P>He is also stiled Primate of England, and Me∣tropolitan of his Province; and has many of those Prerogatives and Priviledges which the Archbi∣shop of Canterbury has within his own Pro∣vince.</P>
<P>Each of the Archbishops is honoured as Dukes are, with the Title of <HI>His Grace.</HI> And, whereas the Inferiour Bishops are stiled <HI>Right Reverend,</HI> the Archbishops are in a Superlative manner stiled <HI>Most Reverend.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Revenues</HI> of the English Bishops, the best Bishopricks are those of Canterbury, Dur∣ham, and Winchester, which yield a plentiful Income. Amongst the rest, some have but a Competency, and others are not much better (some worse) than many Parsonages.</P>
<P>And yet I must say this to the eternal Praise of the Episcopal Order, that they have done <HI>great Things</HI> for the Publick out of their Reve∣nues. For most of the great <HI>publick Works</HI> now
<PB N="245" REF="324"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>maining in England acknowledge their Being, eather to the sole Cost and Charge, or to the li∣beral Contributions of Bishops. I mean not only <HI>Pallaces</HI> and <HI>Castles,</HI> but <HI>Churches, Colledges, Schools, Hospitals, Alms-houses,</HI> a great Number whereof have been founded and built by Bishops. Nay, that famous and chargeable Structure of <HI>London-Bridge</HI> stands to this day obliged to the liberal Contributions of an Archbishop.</P>
<P>In former Reigns, when the Clergy were judged to be the fittest Persons to execute most of the chief Offices and Places of the Realm, such Benefits and Advantages accrued thereby to this Kingdom, that there are few Things of any great Consequence to the Welfare thereof but the Bishops and Prelates were the chief Actors therein. The excellent <HI>Laws</HI> (says an Author) made by several of the Saxon Kings, from whom we have our Common Laws, and our Priviledges mentioned in <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> were all made by the Persuasions and Advice of Bishops, named in our Histories. And 'twas a Bishop of London, at whose Request William the Conqueror granted to this City so large <HI>Privi∣ledges,</HI> that, in a grateful Remembrance there∣of, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen did, before the late dreadful Fire, upon some solemn Days of their Resort to S. Paul's Church, use to go in Procession about the Grave-stone where that Bishop lay interred. The <HI>Union</HI> of the two Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster</HI> (whereby a long and cruel Civil War was ended) was by the Ad∣vice and Counsel of Bishop Morton, then a Pri∣vy Counsellour. And the happy <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>En∣gland</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> was brought to pass by the long Foresight of the Reverend Bishop Fox, a Privy Counsellour, in advising Henry VII, to
<PB N="246" REF="325"/>match his eldest Daughter to Scotland, and his Younger to France.</P>
<P>But, above all, the Converting England to Christianity, the Reforming of it when corrup∣ted, and the Defence of the Reformation against all Romish Writers, is principally (if not sole∣ly) owing to Bishops and Prelates.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Dignify'd Clergy.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS amongst the Laity the Gentry Keeps a middle Rank betwixt the Nobility and the Commonalty, so amongst the Cler∣gy of England there is a middle Station between the Episcopal Order and the inferiour Clergy. Which Station is properly that of the <HI>Dignify'd Clergy,</HI> as <HI>Deans, Arch-Deacons,</HI> and <HI>Prebenda∣ries,</HI> the Subject of this Chapter.</P>
<P>For a Supply of able and fit Persons to make Bishops, or to assist Bishops, a certain Number of eminent Divines both for their Piety and Learning were thought fit by our Fore-fathers to be placed in a Collegiate manner at every Cathedral, or Episcopal See; out of which Se∣minaries fit Persons from time to time might be chosen to govern the Church. Who, living here in a Society together, have the Opportuni∣ty of getting Experience, of reading Men, and raising themselves by degrees above their for∣mer Familiarity with the inferiour Country
<PB N="247" REF="325"/>Clergy. Whereby they fit themselves for Go∣vernment and Authority in the Church.</P>
<P>Accordingly in every Cathedral Church in England there is a certain Number of <HI>Prebenda∣ries,</HI> or <HI>Canons,</HI> and a <HI>Dean</HI> over them; most of them with a plentiful Maintenance, but so that the Dean has commonly a double Por∣tion.</P>
<P><HI>Deans</HI> of the old Foundations, which were before the Suppression of Monasteries, are brought to their Dignities much like Bishops. The King first sends forth his <HI>Conge d'eslire</HI> to the Chapter, who thereupon proceed to the E∣lection. To their Election the King grants his Royal Assent; then the Bishop confirms the Par∣ty elected, and gives his Espiscopal Mandate to Instal him. Whereas the Deans of the new Foundations (upon Suppression of Abbeys or Priories transformed by Henry VIII, into Dean and Chapter) are Installed a much shorter way, by virtue of the King's Letters Patents, without either Election or Confirmation.</P>
<P>In the Cathedral Churches of <HI>S. David,</HI> and of <HI>Landaff,</HI> in Wales, there never has been any Dean. But the Bishop in either is Head of the Chapter; and, in the Bishops absence, the Chan∣ter at <HI>S. Davids,</HI> and at <HI>Landaff</HI> the Arch-Dea∣con.</P>
<P>'Tis observable besides, that there are some Deans in England without any Jurisdiction, but only for Honour so called; as the Dean of the Chappel Royal, the Dean of S. George's Chap∣pel at Windsor, the Deans of Rippon and Garnsey, and all the Deans created by Henry VIII.</P>
<P>Some Deans there are without any Chapter, that injoy however certain Jurisdictions; as the Deans of Croydon, Battel, and Bocking.</P>
<PB N="248" REF="326"/>
<P>A <HI>Prebendary</HI> is so called (as some will have it) <HI>a praebendo Auxilium aut Consilium Episcope vel Decano,</HI> from giving Help or Counsel to the Bishop or Dean. Or (as others) from the Word <HI>Prebend,</HI> which signifies the Portion which every Member or Canon of a Cathedral Church re∣ceives for his Maintenance out of the common Stock of the Church. Of which Prebends some are <HI>Simple,</HI> or have no more but the Revenue towards their Maintenance; and others <HI>with Dignity,</HI> such as have Jurisdiction annexed to them, according to the divers Orders of Churches.</P>
<P>Now among the Prebendaries (or Canons) of the old Foundations, some are <HI>Canonici actu,</HI> such as have Right to vote in the Chapter. O∣thers <HI>Canonici in Herba,</HI> that have a Stall in the Quire, but no Vote in the Chapter; only ha∣ving right to the next Prebend that shall be∣come void.</P>
<P>The Dean and Prebendaries ought to reside in their respective Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, to frequent publick divine Service, to preach by turns upon Sundays and all festi∣val Days, and at due time to administer the Lord's Supper. They ought to instruct the weakest sort of the Country Clergy, to direct them how and what to preach, whereby they may best profit their Auditors. In short, they ought to shew good Example to the Inferiour Clergy. And, when summoned by the Bishop, they are to assist him in some of his Episcopal Functions; as Ordinations, Deprivations <HI>ab Of∣ficio &amp; Beneficio,</HI> Condemnation of obstinate He∣reticks, &amp;c. Upon the King's Writ of <HI>Conge d'eslire,</HI> they elect the Bishop of that Diocese.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="326"/>
<P>The chief of the Prebendaries is the <HI>Sub-Dean,</HI> who supplies the Deans part in his ab∣sence.</P>
<P><HI>Arch-Deacons</HI> are so called for their Charge over the Deacons, who are in every Diocese to be guided and directed under the Bishop there∣of by the Arch Deacon, though a Presbyter himself.</P>
<P>There are of these 60 in all England, each Diocese having in it one or more Arch-Dea∣conries, for Dispatch of Ecclesiastical Business, Their Office is to Visit two Years in three, the third Year being the Bishops Visitation Year. Then the Arch-Deacon is to inquire of Repa∣rations and Movables belonging to the Churches under his Jurisdiction, to reform Abuses in Ec∣clesiastical Matters, and to bring the more weigh∣ty Affairs before the Bishop of the Diocese. Therefore he is called <HI>alter Episcopi Oculus,</HI> the other being the Dean. He is also, upon the Bishops Mandate, to Induct Clerks into their Benefices, and thereby to give them Possession of all the Profits thereunto belonging.</P>
<P>Many Arch-Deacons have, by Prescrip∣tion, their Courts and Officials, as Bishops have.</P>
<P>Lastly, there are <HI>Rural Deans,</HI> anciently cal∣led <HI>Archipresbyteri, &amp; Decani Christianitatis,</HI> perhaps because they had the Oversight of a cer∣tain Number of Priests. Now their Office is, upon the Bishops Orders, to convocate the Cler∣gy, to signify unto them (sometimes by Let∣ters) the Bishops Pleasure, and to give Induction in the Arch-Deacons place, when he lives far off.</P>
<PB N="250" REF="327"/>
<P>Every Arch-Deaconry is subdivided into few∣er or more Rural Deanries.</P>
<P>Note, that, besides Bishopricks, all Deanries are in the Kings Gift; and so are most Prebends and Canonicates, with many great, and some smaller Parsonages.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Inferiour Clengy; Also, of the Church-Wardens, Sidesmen, and Parish-Clerks.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the Inferiour Clergy I mean the <HI>Parish Priests,</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI> The first vulgarly called <HI>Parsons,</HI> are either <HI>Rectors,</HI> or <HI>Vi∣cars.</HI> The Priest of every Parish is called <HI>Rector,</HI> unless the Praedial Tythes be Impropriated; and then he has the Title of <HI>Vicar, quasi vice fungens Rectoris.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, as I said before page 236, there are three Orders in the Church of England, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. That of Deacons is the first step into the Service of the Church, and seems only ministerial to the Priestly Office. For the Charge of Deacons is to take care of the Poor, baptize, read in the Church, assist the Priest at the Lord's Supper, by giving the Cup∣only. And this is properly to fit and prepare him for the Priestly Office.</P>
<PB N="251" REF="327"/>
<P>None may be admitted a Deacon before the Age of 23 Years, without a Dispensation; nor may a Deacon be admitted into the Priestly Or∣der, without a Dispensation, till he has served as Deacon the space of one Year.</P>
<P>The Ordination of Priests and Deacons is performed four times in the Year, upon four several Sundays in the Ember Weeks. Which, by the Laws of the Church, is a Time of Prayer and Fasting for the whole Nation, that so by their joynt Prayers they may recommend to God all that are to receive Ordination. Those are the Weeks called <HI>Quatuor Tempora</HI> by the ancient Fathers, and of great Antiquity in the Church. The proper Days for this Devotion are the <HI>Wednesday, Friday,</HI> and <HI>Saturday</HI> next after Quadragesima Sunday, after Holy-Rood Day in September, and S. Lucies Day in De∣cember.</P>
<P>The Ordination is performed in a most so∣lemn, grave, and devout manner, by a Bishop, assisted with some of the Dignified Clergy, or others in Priestly Order. I begin with that of Deacons, which is thus</P>
<P>First, after Morning Prayer, there is a Ser∣mon about the Duty and Office of Deacons and Priests. The Sermon ended, those that stand for Deacons being decently habited are present∣ed to the Bishop by the Arch-Deacon, or his Deputy. Whom the Bishop asks, if he has made due Inquiry of them; and then asks the Peo∣ple, if they Know any notable Impediment or Crime in any of them. Then follow certain godly Prayers, with the Collect, and Epistle ap∣pointed for this Solemnity. After which, the Oath of Supremacy is administred to every one of them; and the Bishop puts divers godly Questions to them. Which being answered,
<PB N="252" REF="328"/>they all Kneel; and he laying his Hands up∣on them severally does Ordain them Deacons. Then he delivers to every one of them the New Testament, and gives them Authority to read the same in the Church. Whereup∣on the Bishop appoints one of them to read the Gospel. This done, they with the Bi∣shop proceed to the Communion; and so are dismissed with the Blessing pronounced by the Bishop.</P>
<P>The Ordination of Priests is much after the same manner. Only the Epistle and Gospel are different; and, after the Questions and An∣swers made, the Bishop puts up a particular Prayer for them. Which being ended, he desires the Congregation to recommend them to God secretly in their Prayers; for doing of which there is a competent time of general Si∣lence. Then follows <HI>Veni Creator Spiritus,</HI> in Meter to be sung. And, after another Prayer, they all Kneeling, the Bishop, with one or two of the grave Priests there present, lays his Hands upon the Head of every one of them severally, and so gives them Ordination in a grave set Form of Words, different both from that of Bishops, and that of Deacons. The rest is the same as in the Ordaining of Dea∣cons.</P>
<P>What the Office of a Parish-Priest is, is so well known, that I need not insist upon it. His Or∣ders he has from the Bishop, but the Benefice he holds from the Patron. Now we call those <HI>Patrons of Churches,</HI> who by first building of Churches, or first indowing them with I ands, have obtained for them and their Heirs a Right of Advowson or Patronage. Who, when the Church is void, is to propose a fit Clerk to
<PB N="253" REF="328"/>the Bishop, to be by him Canonically Institu∣ted.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Revenues</HI> of the Inferiour Clergy, they are (as in all Places) unequally divided. So that some Parsons have a very plentiful, some but a competent, and others but a small Maintenance; some two or three hundred pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> or more, others one hun∣dred or thereabouts, and some much short of that. Which, besides the Glebe-Land, is mostly raised by way of Tythes, and the Du∣ties paid for Christenings, Marriages, and Fu∣nerals.</P>
<P>The Plurality of Benefices, that is, the Pri∣viledge of holding more Livings than one, al∣lowed by the Church of England for the In∣couragement of worthy and eminent Divines, makes room for many <HI>Curates.</HI> So we call those who officiate in those Churches, where such as hold Plurality of Livings do not Keep their Residence. These <HI>Curates</HI> are such Clergy-men as they think fit to appoint in their places, with such an Allowance as is a∣greed upon amongst themselves.</P>
<P>The Condition of <HI>Vicars</HI> is much the same as that of Curates, if not worse. These pro∣perly officiate in those Livings which are cal∣led <HI>Impropriations,</HI> of which there are in Eng∣land no less than 3845. For above a third part of the best Benefices of England, being an∣ciently by the Popes Grant appropriated to Mo∣nasteries towards their Maintenance, were upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries made Lay∣fees. Which Benefices ever since have been ac∣cordingly provided, not with the best Allow∣ances, nor with the best of the Clergy.</P>
<PB N="254" REF="329"/>
<P>Amongst the <HI>Priviledges</HI> of the Clergy, this is one of the principal, that all Deans, Arch-Deacons, Prebendaries, Rectors, and Vicars may, some by themselves, others by Proxy or by Representative, sit and vote (as Commons Spiritual) in the Lower House of Convoca∣tion.</P>
<P>No Subsidies, or other Tax to the King, might formerly be laid upon them, without their own Consent first had in Convocation. And indeed the Clergy paying to the King the first Fruits, that is, the first Years Profits of all Spiritual Benefices, and yearly the Tenth of all the said Benefices, 'twas thought but reasonable they should be exempted from all other Taxes. Though, to give the Laity good Example, they have often laid upon themselves Subsidies, and other great Taxes.</P>
<P>The Glebe-Lands, and Spiritual Revenues of Clergy-men, being held <HI>in pura &amp; perpe∣tua Eleemosyna,</HI> that is (as the Law calls it) in <HI>Frankalmoine,</HI> are exempted from arraying and Mustering of Men, or Horses for the War. And, as by their Function they are prohibited to wear any Arms, therefore they cannot serve personally in War. But they serve their Coun∣try otherwise, by being our Leaders in our Spi∣ritual Warfare.</P>
<P>Neither can any Clergy-man be compelled to undergo any other Personal Functions, or Services in the Common-wealth. For, if any Man, by reason of his Land, be liable to be elected to any Servile Office, if he takes Or∣ders, he is free, and there lies a Writ purposely to free him.</P>
<PB N="255" REF="329"/>
<P>Clergy-Men are not obliged to appear at Sheriffs Turns, or Courts-Leet, there to take their Oath of Allegiance.</P>
<P>By <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> no Clergy-man ought to he Fined or Amerced according to his Spiritual Means, but according to his Temporal Estate, and to the Crime committed.</P>
<P>The Goods of Clergy-men are discharged, by the Common Law of England, from Tolls and Customs of Average, Pontage, Murage, and Panage; for which they have the King's Writ to discharge them, provided they don't trade with them.</P>
<P>All Clergy-men are free from the King's Purveyors, Carriages, Post, &amp;c. for which they may demand a Protection from the King, with the Clause <HI>Nolumus.</HI></P>
<P>As to the whole <HI>Number of the Clergy</HI> in England, besides the two Archbishops, and the twenty four Bishops, there are 26 Deans of Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, 576 Prebendaries, 9653 Rectors and Vicars; be∣sides as many more Curates and others in ho∣ly Orders.</P>
<P>In point of Learning and good exemplary Life, England (I dare say) is outdone by no Clergy in the Christian World. If, amongst the Inferiour Clergy there be some ignorant lewd Livers, the dignified Clergy, and the E∣piscopal Colledge, are generally Men noted both for their great Piety and deep Learning. And the late Scuffle they had with the Roma∣nists in so difficult a Juncture as King James his Reign, as it has sufficiently shewn the greatness of their Parts and the Depth of their Learning, so it expressed to the World their
<PB N="256" REF="330"/>strong and invincible Zeal for the Protestant Religion, and the gross Mistake of Dissenters that lookt upon them as broad-faced Pa∣pists.</P>
<P>Nothing troubles me more, than to see some of the Clergy so much infatuated as to indea∣vour to defeat (as far as in them lies) the late signal Providence, that rescued us so wonder∣fully from Popery and Slavery. I do not re∣flect upon those who remain quiet under their Scruples of Conscience, and are not so far disturbed in their Mind as to disturb the Go∣vernment. But to see some so low-spirited as to fall a hugging their old Enemies the French, and admire them as their Tutelar Angels who were but 'tother Day the greatest Object of their Scorn and Contempt, this affords matter of admiration. 'Tis pretty to see the Temper of these Men, and those they have infected, all made up of Contradictions. They hate their Friends, and love their Enemies. They deride Popery, and yet do their utmost to bring it in. None more averse than they from Slave∣ry, but leave no Stone unturned to work it into these Kingdoms. Whose Condition is like that of a Sick Person, that longs for Health, and yet is greedy to catch at any Thing that pleases his Fancy, let it prove never so fatal. The Truth is, 'tis nothing else in the bottom but a malignant Humour, that causes Inflam∣mation, and strikes up to the Brain; lately a catching, but now (thanks be to God) a va∣nishing Disease.</P>
<P>I conclude with the <HI>Parish-Church Officers,</HI> which are indeed Lay-men; but, as they have a peculiar Relation to the Church, they may be counted to be half-Clergy-men.</P>
<PB N="257" REF="330"/>
<P>The <HI>Church-Wardens,</HI> amongst these, are the principal. Whose Office is to see, that the Church be in good Repair, and want nothing for Divine Service, &amp;c. That the Church-yard be well inclosed, and an exact Terrier of the Glebe-Land be Kept. They are also to sue for any Thing Kept from the Church, that is of right belonging to it; to inquire after, ad∣monish, and present to the Bishop scandalous Livers, and to collect the Charity of the Pa∣rishioners. The Bishops Orders they are both to declare, and to execute.</P>
<P>They serve commonly two Years in that Sta∣tion, and Easter-Week is the time for their E∣lection. Usually they are elected by the Parson and the Parishioners, where it is so agreed. If not, the Parson chuses one, and the Parishio∣ners the other.</P>
<P>In some great Parishes there are joyned <HI>Sidesmen</HI> to the Church-Wardens, to assist them in the Inquiries into the Lives of inor∣dinate Livers, and in presenting Offenders at Visitations.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Clerk,</HI> whose Office is to serve at Church the Priest and Church-Wardens. He ought to be at least 20 Years old, and a Man of good Life and Conversation, that can read, write, and sing Psalms, the tuning whereof is part of his Office. He is commonly chosen by the Parson only.</P>
<P>In many Parishes there is also one <HI>Sexton,</HI> or more. So we call those that attend the Pa∣rishioners at Church, and let them into their Pews. Which in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches is commonly performed by the <HI>Ver∣gers,</HI> so called from a Silver Verge which they carry in their hands.</P>
<PB N="258" REF="331"/>
<P>To take care of the Parish-Concerns, both Civil and Ecclesiastical, a great Power is by Law committed to the <HI>Vestry-men;</HI> So called from the Vestry, a Room adjoyning to the Church for the Use of the Parson and Parish-Officers. They are a select Number of the chief Parishioners in every Parish within the City of London and Suburbs, and elsewhere; who yearly chuse Officers for the Parish, as <HI>Church-Wardens, Constables, Scavengers, Col∣lectors for the Poor,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Beadle's</HI> is a stand∣ing Office.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Women.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALL Women in England are either <HI>Noble,</HI> or <HI>Ignoble.</HI> The first are so by <HI>Descent, Creation,</HI> or <HI>Marriage.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Descent,</HI> as when a Lady holds an Estate by a noble Title. For Titles of Honour some∣times, for want of Males, do descend to Fe∣males. But only to one of them, because they are Things in their own nature intire, and not to be divided amongst many, as the Lands and Tenements are, which descend in equal Propor∣tion to all the Daughters. By <HI>Creation,</HI> some Women have been made, at the King's pleasure, Baronesses, Countesses, and Dutchesses.</P>
<PB N="259" REF="331"/>
<P>But the greatest Part of the English Noble∣women are so only by <HI>Marriage,</HI> all Women being counted Noble that are married to any Peer of the Realm. And so (as the Law says) <HI>Uxor fulget Radiis Mariti.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, if afterwards they marry to Men not No∣ble, they lose by Law their former Dignity, and follow their latter Husbands Condition; though by the Courtesy of England, they are still lookt upon and respected as Noble, and called by the Name of the former Husband. But Women, Noble by Descent or Birth-right, or by Creation, retain by Law their Nobility, tho they Marry afterwards to Husbands under their Degree.</P>
<P>'Tis observable, that any Noble-woman by Birth, being married to a Baron, takes place but as Baroness, though she be a Duke's Daughter. But, if she marry to one under the Degree of a Nobleman, as to a Knight or Gentleman, the Courtesy of England gives her place according to her Birth, and not her Husbands Condi∣tion.</P>
<P>A Noble-woman marrying to an Ignoble Man adds no Honour to him. Her Honour is all hers, and he has no share in it, though by Marriage he becomes Master of all her Goods and Chattels. But her Dignities with the Lands, descend to her next Heir.</P>
<P>Noble-women, in the Eye of the Law, are Peers of the Realm; and accordingly they in∣joy most of the Priviledges of Peers. But it is thought, they cannot maintain an Action upon the Statute <HI>De Scandalo Magnatum.</HI></P>
<P>As happy as the Condition of married Wo∣men is generally all over England, yet the Laws of this Kingdom are in the main very se∣vere
<PB N="260" REF="332"/>upon them. For, when a Woman marries, she gives her self over, and what she brings with her, to the power of her Husband. What∣ever she is possessed of, the Husband becomes the Proprietor of it; and her very necessary Appa∣rel is not hers in Propriety. If she has any Te∣nure, it is all <HI>in Capite,</HI> that is, she holds it of, and by her Husband, who is the Head of his Wife. And all the Chattels personal she had at the Marriage are so much her Husbands, that, he dying before her, they shall not return to his Wife, but go with his other Goods and Chattels to the Husband's Executor or Administrator. Except the <HI>Paraphernalia,</HI> that is, those Goods which a Wife, besides her Dower or Joyn∣ture, is after her Husbands Death allowed to have, as Furniture for her Chamber, wear∣ing Apparel, and Jewels if she be of quali∣ty; which are not to be put into her Hus∣band's Inventory, especially in the Province of York.</P>
<P>The Wife can make no Contract without her Husband's Consent; and without it she cannot set, sell, give away, or alienate any Thing.</P>
<P>So great is her Subjection to her Husband's Will, that, in the Sense of the Law, she has no Will of her own. Therefore, when a Man and his Wife commit a Felony together, the Wife can neither be Principal, nor Accessory; the Law supposing she was forced thereunto, in regard of the Subjection and Obedience she ows to her Husband.</P>
<P>In short, by the Law of England, a Wife is so much in the Power of her Husband, that she is no better than a Child, or the best of Ser∣vants. For she can call nothing her own, more
<PB N="261" REF="332"/>than a Child, whom his Father suffers to call many Things his own, yet can dispose of no∣thing. And, when she offends, 'tis in her Husband's Power to correct her, as a Servant. Therefore, if she wrong another by her Tongue, on by Trespass, her Husband must answer for her Fault, and make Satisfaction.</P>
<P>But a Woman, upon Marriage, does not on∣ly lose the Power over her Person, Will and Goods; but she must part with her very Name, and ever after use her Husband's Surname, contrary to the Custom of some other Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>One Thing more there is yet which eviden∣ces the great Subjection of a Wife to her Husband. And that is the Punishment inflict∣ed upon a Woman that has Killed her Hus∣band, which is to be Burnt alive; the Offence being counted Petty-Treason by Law, that is, as great a Crime as the Killing of his Father, or Master.</P>
<P>Yet in some things the Law is very favour∣able to the female Sex of England. As for Ex∣ample, if a Wife bring forth a Child begotten before Marriage by another Man than her pre∣sent Husband, her Husband is bound to own the Child, and that Child shall be his Heir at Law. So literally we take the Saying, <HI>Pater est quem Nuptiae demonstrant.</HI></P>
<P>If a Husband be a long time absent from his Wife, though it be for some Years, and his Wife bring forth a Child during his Absence, he must father that Child, in case he lived all the while in this Island, or (to speak the Words of the Law) <HI>inter quatuor Maria.</HI> And, if that Child be her first-born Son, and her Husband's E∣state
<PB N="262" REF="333"/>Intailed, or left without Will, that Child shall be Heir to it.</P>
<P>Another Priviledge of English-Women is, that the Wife having no Joynture settled before Marriage, may challenge, after her Husband's Death, the third part of his yearly Rents of Land during her Life; and within the City of London, a third Part of all her Husband's Mo∣veables for ever. If there be many Children, the rest comes to the eldest; if not, to the next Heir at Law. And, if she do not approve of the Division, she may claim the Right of being Indowed with the best of the Land, to a third part.</P>
<P>But, if the Law be so favourable in some Cases to married Women, Custom, or rather the good Nature of Englishmen, makes their Condition much happier. Whose Respect and Tenderness for them is generally so great, that every where they give 'em the Precedency, and put them the least of any Nation upon Drud∣gery and Hardship. Women are not here mew∣ed up as in Italy and Spain; and that mis∣chievous Passion of Jealousy has got so little footing here, that the Nation is little troubled with its troublesom Influences, or fatal Con∣sequences. In short, married Women have here more Liberty, than any where else. Their chief Care is of the House and Houshold, ac∣cording to the ancient Custom of the Greek Wives; which is indeed the proper Office of a Wife, as the Husband's is to mind his Con∣cerns abroad.</P>
<P>And such is generally their Carriage to their Husbands, and their mutual Tenderness for them, that, where the Law gives them nothing, the dying Husband often leaves all behind him to the Disposal of his Wife. Except in Lon∣don,
<PB N="263" REF="333"/>where a peculiar Order is taken by the City agreeable to the Civil Law.</P>
<P>A Knight's Wife is, by the Courtesy of England, counted and called a Lady. If her Husband die before her, and she take afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Husband of a lower estate, still she shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alled Lady with the surname of her first husband, and not of the second. Which is by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Courtesy of England, and according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adies of a higher Rank, as I have before ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erved.</P>
<P>In point of real Estate, 'tis Observable, that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Wife be an Heiress, and bring to her Husband an Estate in Land, that Land descends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o her eldest Son; and, if she has no Sons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut only Daughters, it is divided amongst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem. But, if she dies without Issue, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and goes immediately to the next Heir at Law. Only the Husband shall enjoy the Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es thereof during his Life, if so be that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d a Child alive of her Body, that had been heard once to cry. And this also is called the Courtesy of England.</P>
<P>As to what I said before touching real and personal Estates in case of Matrimony, the same is to be understood in the sense of the Common Law, where there is no private Contract. For whatever Contract or Covenants were made before the Marriage betwixt the husband and the Wife, either by themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y their Parents, or Friends, they take place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd are of force to be Kept according to the Validity thereof.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Wife in England is accounted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much one with her Husband, that she cannot
<PB N="264" REF="334"/>be produced as Witness for or against her Husband. And so strong is the Tie that joyns them together, that they may not be wholly Se∣parated by any Agreement between themselves, but only by a Judicial Sentence.</P>
<P>Now there is a twofold Separation, both cal∣led by the name of Divorce. The one in case of Adultery, <HI>a Mensa &amp; Thoro,</HI> Which is no∣thing else but a living asunder, without a li∣berty-to Remarry, whilst either Party is alive. Whereas the other is <HI>a Vinculo Matrimonii,</HI> from the Bond of Matrimony, whereby each Party is free to Remarry. And this is allowed upon a Nullity of the Marriage, or upon some essen∣tial Impediment, as Consanguinity or Affinity within the Degrees forbidden, Precontract, Impotency, or such like. Of which Divines reckon fourteen, according to these Verses,
<Q><L><HI>Error, Conditio, Votum, Cognatio, Crimen,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cultus, Disparitas, Vis, Ordo, Ligamen, Ho∣nestas,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Si sis Affinis, si forte Coire nequibis,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Si Parochi, &amp; duplicis desit praesentia Testis,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Raptave sit Mulier,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>But sometimes, in case of Adultery, this plenary Divorce has been allowed of, in private Cases, by Act of Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Children, and Servants.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FRom the Condition of Women in Eng∣land, I come now to that of <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants.</HI> As to the first, a Father in England has a more absolute Authority over his Children, than is usual in our Neighbour Countries. Here a Father may give all his Estate Unintailed from his Children, and all to one Child; the Consideration whereof is apt to keep his Children in aw, and within the bounds of filial Obedience.</P>
<P>But commonly the eldest Son inherits all Lands, and the younger Children Goods and Chattels, by which is meant the Personal E∣state. Among the Nobility and Gentry, the eldest Son's Wife's Portion does usually go for the Portions of his Sisters; and the younger Sons are put out to some Profes∣sion.</P>
<P>The Reason why the eldest Son is so well provided beyond the rest of the Children is, that he may be the better able to bear up the Honour of the Family, which in course <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls to the share of the Eldest. For, when all is done, Titular Honour without Means, is commonly lookt upon but as an empty Sha∣dow.</P>
<PB N="266" REF="335"/>
<P>But, if there be no Son, the Lands, as well as Goods, are equally divided among the Daughters.</P>
<P>A Son at the Age of 14, his Father being dead, may chuse his Gardian, and may claim his Land holden in Socage, that is, such Lands as Tenants hold by, or for certain inferi∣our Services of Husbandry to be performed to the Lord of the Fee. He is free to consent to Marriage, and may by Will dispose of Goods and Chattels.</P>
<P>At the Age of 15, he ought to be Sworn to his Allegiance to the King; at 21 he is said to be of full Age. Then he is free to make any Contracts, and to pass by Will both Goods and Lands; which in other Countries may not be done till the Age of 25, called <HI>Annus Consistentiae.</HI></P>
<P>A Daughter at the Age of 7 Years, may consent to Marriage; but at 12, she is free to retract or confirm it. If she confirms it, then the Marriage is good, and she may make a Will of Goods and Chattels.</P>
<P>At 21 she may Contract, or Alienate her Lands by Will, or otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>Servants</HI> in England are either tied to a certain Number of Years, or only by the Year; these being free to quit their Service at such a Warning as is agreed upon between the Master (or the Mistris) and the Ser∣vant.</P>
<P>By those that are tied to a certain Num∣ber of Years, I mean <HI>Apprentices,</HI> the usual Time for their Apprentiship being 7 Years. This is the most Servile Condition in England,
<PB N="267" REF="335"/>considering the Lash they ly under, together with their long and strict Confinement, under Articles. And, whereas other Servants re∣ceive Wages for their Service, these common∣ly do pay a Sum of Mony to their Masters for their Prenticeship.</P>
<P>The Condition of other <HI>Servants</HI> is much easier all over England. For, besides that few undergo the Hardship that Prentices do, they may be free at the Years end, giving 3 Months Warning; and, if a Servant do not like one Master, he may go to another, where perhaps he may find more favour or advantage. But, before a Person ventures upon such a Servant, 'tis civil first to get his former Masters Leave, and prudential to have from him a testimony of his faithfulness and dili∣gence.</P>
<P>Now there are so many Degrees of <HI>Ser∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ants</HI> in England, that if some live meanly, there are others who live genteely, and some of these so splendidly as to keep Servants of their own. In great Families where a Per∣son of quality makes a proper Figure, and has a sutable Attendance, there is a necessary Subordination of Servants; so that the Infe∣riour Servants may be at the beck of their Superiour Officers, to answer the several parts of their respective Duties. Thus a great Man lives like a Prince, and Keeps a Court of his own.</P>
<P>In general it may be said, no Country is more favourable than England to Servants; who generally live here with more ease and less Subjection, and have larger Salaries than any where else.</P>
<PB N="268" REF="336"/>
<P>The truth is, if we consider the nature of a Servant, how by going to Service he devests himself of what is dearest to Mankind, his Li∣berty, and Subjects his Will to another, who sometimes proves magget-headed, cruel, or ty∣rannical, I think it but reasonable, to have a tender Regard for good Servants. For this, amongst other Things, was that great Man of Spain, Cardinal <HI>Ximenes,</HI> so noted in his time; who proved so bountiful and so generous a Master to his Servants, that History to this day does admire him for it.</P>
<P>As for stubborn and unruly Servants, the Law of England gives Masters and Mistresses Power to correct them; and Resistance in a Servant is punished with severe Penalty. But for a Servant to Kill his Master or Mistris is so high a Crime, that it is counted Petty Trea∣son, or a Crime next to High Treason.</P>
<P>Since Christianity prevailed here, England admits of no forein <HI>Slaves.</HI> In forein Planta∣tions indeed, the English, as other Nations, buy and sell Negro's as Slaves. But a forein Slave brought over into England is, upon Land∣ing, <HI>ipso facto</HI> free from Slavery, though not from ordinary Service.</P>
<P>'Tis true there has been a sort of Tenure here, called a Tenure in <HI>Villenage,</HI> and the Te∣nant <HI>Villain,</HI> who was in effect a Bond-man to the Lord of the Land. For the Lord might take Redemption of him to marry his Daugh∣ter, and to make him free. He might put him out of his Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels, at his Will; and might beat and chastise, but not maim him. Now such <HI>Vil∣lains</HI> are out of date, though the Law con∣cerning them stands unrepealed to this day.
<PB N="229" REF="336"/><HI>Servorum &amp; Nativorum</HI> (says Spelman) <HI>apud nos sublata est Conditio, &amp; quas ideo possidebant Terras vel Praedia hodie libere tenent sub anti∣quae Servitutis Consuetudinibus.</HI> And Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Coke</HI> out of <HI>Fortescue</HI> has this Note, <HI>Im∣pius &amp; Crudelis judicandus qui Libertati non favet;</HI> for which he gives this as the Reason of it, <HI>Anglia Jura in omni Casu dant favorem Li∣bertati,</HI> the Laws of England in all Cases stand for Liberty.</P>

<HEAD>THE NEW STATE OF ENGLAND. PART III. <HI>Of the Courts of Judicature.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Parliament of England.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>High Court of Parliament</HI> being the Great Council of England, the Supreme Court of Judicature, and One of the most August Assemblies the World, is the Court that I am to speak in the first place.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="339"/>
<P>It came to be called <HI>Parliament</HI> from the French <HI>Parlement,</HI> and this from their Verb <HI>Parler</HI> to speak (or talk) together. The same is taken in a two-fold Sense. First, as it includes the Legislative Power of England, as when we say an <HI>Act of Parliament.</HI> In which Accepta∣tion it includes the King, Lords, and Commons; each of which have a Negative Voice in ma∣king Laws, so that without their joynt Consent no Law can by either abrogated, or made. Se∣condly, in a Vulgar Sense; as when we say <HI>the King and Parliament,</HI> or the <HI>King has called a Parliament,</HI> by which is meant the Two Houses, <HI>viz.</HI> the House of Lords and the House of Commons.</P>
<P>This Court is a Body Corporate, consisting (according to the first Acceptation of the Word) of the Three Estates of the Realm. And though the Name <HI>Parliament,</HI> by which it is now called, be not probably older than the Con∣quest by William Duke of Normandy; yet 'tis made plain by ancient Records and Precedents, that the former Kings of England, even in the Saxons-time, had from time to time great Na∣tional Councils, much of the same nature as our Parliaments. In the Saxons Time, says <HI>Lam∣bard,</HI> the great Council of the Nation consisted of the King, Lords, and Commons. It is most apparent, (says <HI>Prinn</HI>) by all the old Prece∣dents before the Conquest, that all our ancien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Councils were nothing else but Parliaments, cal∣led by different Names in several Ages, till at las<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that of Parliament was fixed upon them; and that our Kings, Nobles, Senators, Aldermen Wisemen, Knights, and Commons were usuall present, and voted there as Members and Judge The same is averred by many Records an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Precedents touching this Matter, in the Appen∣dix
<PB N="3" REF="339"/>to <HI>Petyt</HI>'s <HI>Miscellanea Parliamentaria.</HI> Which does not quadrate with the Opinion of those who have affirmed, that there was never any Parliament in England, according to the pre∣sent Constitution thereof, till the Reign of Hen∣ry III, that is, betwixt four and five hundred Years since; and that the grand Council consisted on∣ly of the great Men of the Nation, till that King was pleased to call the Commons to sit also in Parliament.</P>
<P>The Power of Convening (or Calling) a Par∣liament is solely in the King. But, if the King be under Age, or not <HI>Compos Mentis,</HI> or Ab∣sent out of the Realm upon some Expedition, 'tis lodged in the Protector or Regent, who then summons the Parliament, but still in the King's Name.</P>
<P>The Summons ought to be at least 40 Days before the Day appointed for the Meeting; and it is done by Writ in Law-Latin, expressing that it is with the Advice of the Privy Council. Which Writ is a kind of short Letter directed and sent by the Lord Chancellour (or Commis∣sioners of the Chancery) to every Lord Spiri∣tual and Temporal, to appear at a certain Time and Place, to treat and give their Advice in some important Affairs concerning the Church and State, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, as for the House of Com∣mons, Writs are sent to all the Sheriffs, com∣manding them to summon the People to elect two Knights for each County, two Citizens for each City, and one or two Burgesses for each Borough, according to Statute, Charter, or Custom.</P>
<P>And, whereas there are some Cities and Towns that are Counties of themselves, or that have each within it self the Priviledge of a
<PB N="4" REF="340"/>County, the Writ is directed to them as it is to Sheriffs of other Counties.</P>
<P>At every County, after the Delivery of the Parliament Writ to the Sheriffs, Proclamation is made in the full County of the Day and Place appointed for the Parliament to sit, and for all Freeholders to attend such a Time and Place for the Election of the Knights for that County. But the Sheriff ought to give a con∣venient Time for the Day of Election, and suf∣ficient Warning to those that have Voices, that they may be present. Otherwise the Election is not good, if, for want of due Notice, part of the Electors be absent.</P>
<P>Now, by an Act in the Reign of Henry VI, it was Ordained, that none should have any Suffrage in the Election of the Knights of the Shire, but such as were Freeholders, did reside in the County, and had a yearly Revenue, at least to the Value of 40 Shillings; which, be∣fore the Discovery of the Gold and Silver in A∣merica, was as much as 30 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> now. And the Sheriff has Power by the said Act to examine upon Oath every such Chuser, how much he may expend by the Year, if he doubt the value of it.</P>
<P>If any Man keep a Houshold in one County, and remain in Service with another Family in another County, yet he may be at the Chusing of Knights of the Shire where he Keeps his Family; for it shall be said in Law a Dwelling in that County.</P>
<P>The Election ought to be in full County be∣tween 8 and 9 of the Clock, according to Sta∣tute. And no Election (says the Lord <HI>Coke</HI>) can be made of any Knight of the Shire but between 8 and 11 of the Clock in the Forenoon. But, if the Election be begun within the
<PB N="5" REF="340"/>Time, and cannot be determined within those Hours, the Election may be proceeded up∣on.</P>
<P>Before Election can be made, or Voices gi∣ven, the Precept directed to the Sheriff ought to be read and published. And, if the Party or Freeholders demand the Poll, the Sheriff ought not to deny the Scrutiny, for he cannot discern who be Freeholders by the View. In short, of so many as stand for Competitors, the two that have most Voices are declared to be duly elected for the insuing Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>Plurality of Voices does likewise carry it for Citizens that stand for Cities, and Burgesses for Boroughs. Where in some Places none but Freeholders have a Right of Election, in others all Housholders have a share in it. And, though no Alien can be a Parliament Man; yet, if he be a Housholder, his Voice is good, as in the E∣lection of the Members for the City of West∣minster.</P>
<P>A Burgess elected for two several Boroughs, as it sometimes happens, must wave one Election when he comes to the House, and chuse for which Place of the two he will serve; so as a Writ may issue for a new Election, that the Number may be full.)</P>
<P>All Elections ought to be freely and indiffe∣rently made, notwithstanding any Prayer or Command to the contrary. Or else the Parlia∣ment is not, as it should be, free. 'Tis true the Elections can never be so free, as not to be lia∣ble to the Temptations of private Interest, or the Influence of Feasting, two unavoidable E∣vils. Yet it does not follow but that a Parlia∣ment may be called Free, when the Court has no hand in the Elections by such unlaw∣ful
<PB N="6" REF="341"/>Methods as were used in the late Reign, by Closetting, by fair Promises, and foul Threats.</P>
<P>The Returns concerning the Parties chosen are made in the Crown-Office, by the Sheriffs, Mayors, or Bayliffs, whom the Writs were sent to, and to whom it belongs to manage the Elections.</P>
<P>Upon a false Return, which happens but too frequently, the Sheriff who made the Return is liable to the Forfeiture of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the King, and 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> more to the Party injured, and to be Imprisoned for a Year without Bail or Mainprize And every Mayor or Magistrate of a Town so offending, is to pay 40 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the King, and as much to the Party. This Action to be within 3 Months after the Parliament commenced by the Party injured, or by any other Man who will.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Party returned remains a Member of the House, till his Election be de∣clared void by the same.</P>
<P>For denying the Poll when required, also for advising and abetting the same, the guilty Par∣ty has been adjudged by the House to stand Committed to the Sergeant during Pleasure, to pay all due Fees, to defray the Charge of Wit∣nesses, to be Assessed by four of the Committee, to acknowledge his Offence upon his Knees at the Bar, and read a Submission. This was the Case of <HI>Thomson</HI> Sheriff of York, and his A∣bettor Alderman <HI>Henlow,</HI> in the Reign of Charles I.</P>
<P>The Persons to be Elected as the fittest to an∣swer the true Interest of the Nation, ought to be Sober, Understanding, Well-principled, and Well-affected to the establish'd Government by Law. If Men of Estates, it is so much the
<PB N="7" REF="341"/>better, such Men being supposed to be less Cor∣ruptible. But this is left to the Peoples Choice.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that by Law such as stand for Knights of the Shire ought to be Knights, Esquires, or Gentlemen fit to be made Knights.</P>
<P>By the Statute none ought to be chosen a Burgess of a Town in which he do's not in∣habit. But the Usage of Parliament dispenses with that Act.</P>
<P>Neither can any be legally chosen that is not of full Age, that is, 21 Years old at least. And reason good, for, if no Man under that Age can dispose of his Estate, much less should he have any share in the supream Power of the Nation, to judge, vote, or dispose of the Estate of the Realm. Yet the Practice in the House of Commons has often been otherwise; in the House of Lords, but seldom.</P>
<P>Whoever stands to be Elected must be a Native Englishman, or at least must be Na∣turalized by Act of Parliament. No Alien Denizated ought to sit here.</P>
<P>None of the Judges can be chosen, that sit in the Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer, because they are Assistants in the Lords House, But any that have Judicial Places in other Courts Ecclesiastical or Civil, being no Lords of Parliament, are Eligible.</P>
<P>No Sheriff, nor Clergy-man can be chosen a Member of Parliament. Not the first, be∣cause his personal Attendance is required with∣in his Bayliwick, during the time of his Sheriffalty. Nor the last, because he is of another Body, viz. the Convocation; and the Clergy of the Convocation-House are no Part or Member of the Parliament.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="342"/>
<P>A Man attainted of Treason or Felony, &amp;c. is not Eligible. For he ought to be <HI>magis ido∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, discretus, &amp; sufficiens.</HI> But a Person Outlawed in a Personal Cause may be a Bur∣gess. And, tho the Common Law do's disin∣able the Party; yet the Priviledge of the House being urged prevails over the Law.</P>
<P>Anciently the Elected Members had a com∣petent Allowance from the respective County, City, or Borough, for which they served in Parliament. A Knight of the Shire was al∣lowed 4 shill. and a Citizen or Burgess 2 shill. a Day; which in those Days was a considerable Sum. But then the Sessions were but short, sometimes but eight Days, sometimes less, seldom above three or four Weeks; and yet during that short space of time several great and weighty Affairs were dispatched. Which (as some think) were prepared to their hand by the King and Council, as it is now pra∣ctised in Sweden by the 40 Counsellors of State, and in Scotland by the Lords of the Articles. And, if they did only debate upon such Things as the King did propose, a little Time might serve well enough to do it. But it do's not appear to be so by what passed Feb. 9. 1597, 39 Eliz. When the Queen gave her Royal Assent to 24 publick and 19 private Bills; but refused 48 Bills more, which had passed both Houses. Certain it is, that there was less Canvassing, and more Plainness in those Days, than there is at present.</P>
<P>The Place of Meeting for this honourable Assembly is in whatsoever City, Town, or House the King pleases. But of latter times it has been ufually at the Kings ancient Palace at
<PB N="9" REF="342"/><HI>Westminster;</HI> the Lords in a Room by them∣selves, and the Commons not far from them, in another Room, which formerly was S. Ste∣phens Chappel.</P>
<P>When the Day prefixt by the King in his Writs of Summons is come, His Majesty usual∣ly comes in person to the House of Lords, cloathed with his Royal Robes, the Crown up∣on his head, and the Sword of State before Him. At the upper end of the Room is placed a Chair of State under a Canopy, upon which His Majesty sits.</P>
<P>Then all the Temporal Peers appear in their Scarlet Robes, every one according to his De∣gree; and the Spiritual Lords, in their Epis∣copal Habit, which they do all the Sessions.</P>
<P>On the Kings right hand, next the Wall, are placed on a Form the two <HI>Arch-Bishops;</HI> next below, on another Form, the Bishops of <HI>London, Durham,</HI> and <HI>Winchester;</HI> then, upon other Forms on the same side, all the rest of the <HI>Bishops</HI> sit, according to the priority of their Consecration.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor, or Keeper (when there is one) stands behind the Cloth of State, or fits on the first Wool-sack, before the Chair of State, with his Great Seal and Mace by him.</P>
<P>On the Kings left hand are placed the Trea∣surer, President of the Council, and Lord Privy Seal, of they be Barons, above all Dukes, but those of the Royal Family; if not Barons, then they sit uppermost on the Wool-sacks. And on the same side sit the <HI>Dukes, Marquesses,</HI> or <HI>Earls,</HI> according to their Creation. Cross the House, below the Wool-sacks, the first Form is that which the <HI>Viscounts</HI> sit upon; and, up∣on the next Forms, the <HI>Barons,</HI> all in order.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="343"/>
<P>The King being thus seated in his Throne, with this noble Appearance of the Peers of the Realm, all standing uncovered, his Majesty sends for the Commons from their Room where they are assembled. Who being come (at least part of them) stand at the Bar of the Lords House. Whereupon the King makes a short Speech to both Houses, concerning such Matters as He thinks fit to lay before them for the Good of the Kingdom. Amongst which that of a Sup∣ply of Mony is most commonly one, in order to answer the extraordinary Charges of the Crown.</P>
<P>The King having ended his Speech, the Chancellor (or Lord Keeper) did formerly use by the Kings Appointment to inlarge upon it, with all the Rhetorick and Logick the Matter could bear, to dispose both Houses to a Com∣pliance with the King. But His present Ma∣jesty has declined that Method, and being a Prince of few Words gains more upon ratio∣nal Men by his concise and plain Way of De∣livery, (as the more agreeable to a true gene∣rous Nature) than perhaps he might with all the Windings and Turnings of artificial Rhe∣torick.</P>
<P>Then the Speaker of the House of Lords commands, in the Kings Name, the Commons to assemble in their House, there to chuse one of their Members for their Speaker, and to present him such a Day to His Majesty. Up∣on which the King withdraws, and the Com∣mons presently re-assemble themselves in the Lower House, in order to chuse one of their Members for Speaker.</P>
<P>Sometimes, as in the last Session, the Speaker is chosen by the Kings Command, be∣fore
<PB N="11" REF="343"/>fore His Majesty delivers his Speech to both Houses of Parliament.</P>
<P>After the Speaker is chosen, and the Choice approved by the King, His Majesty leaves both Houses to their private Debates upon the Sub∣ject of his Speech; and do's no more appear amongst them that Session in his Royal Robes, except upon the passing of any Act, or at the Close of the Session, whether it be by Adjourn∣ment, Prorogation, or Dissolution. 'Tis true, upon any extraordinary Debate in the House of Lords, 'tis customary with the Kings of England to assist at the same; not to argue upon it, or to influence the House one way or other, but only to hear the Arguments of the House upon the Matter in Debate. But then the King appears without his Crown and Robes, and every Peer sits (except when he speaks to the House) as if the King were not there.</P>
<P>The <HI>House of Lords,</HI> otherwise called the <HI>House of Peers,</HI> or the <HI>Ʋpper House,</HI> consists of 189 Members. Viz. 163 Temporal Lords, whereof 14 <HI>Dukes,</HI> 3 <HI>Marquesses,</HI> 72 <HI>Earls,</HI> 9 <HI>Viscounts,</HI> 65 <HI>Barons;</HI> and 26 Spiritual Lords, whereof 2 <HI>Arch-bishops,</HI> and 24 <HI>Bishops.</HI></P>
<P>But the King may, by virtue of his Prero∣gative, increase the Number of the Peers to sit and vote in their House, as Barons, by send∣ing his Writs for that pupose to whomsoever His Majesty thinks fit for that Service.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper (when there is one) is of course the Speaker of this House. Otherwise they may appoint any of their own Members, or else one of the Judges, for that Place; as in the Case of their late Speaker, the Right Honourable the Marquis of
<PB N="12" REF="344"/><HI>Hallifax,</HI> and that of Sir Robert <HI>Atkins,</HI> Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, the present Speaker of the House of Lords.</P>
<P>Besides the first Wool-sack, which is the usual Seat for the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, there are other Wool-sacks; Upon which the <HI>Judges,</HI> the Kings <HI>Council at Law,</HI> and the <HI>Masters of Chancery</HI> (not being Ba∣rons) sit, not to give their Suffrage, but only their Advice, when required thereto. The Use of which <HI>Wool-sacks</HI> is probably to put them in mind of the great Advantages the Eng∣lish Wool has brought to this Nation, so that it may never be neglected.</P>
<P>On the lowermost Wool sack are placed the <HI>Clerk of the Crown,</HI> and <HI>Clerk of the Parliament;</HI> The first being concerned in all Writs of and Pardons in Parliament, and the other in keep∣ing the Records of all Things passed therein. Under this there are two <HI>Clerks,</HI> who kneeling behind the Wool-sack write upon it.</P>
<P>Without the Bar of the House sits the <HI>Black Rod,</HI> so called from a black Stick he carries in his hand, who is (as it were) the Messenger of this House. For he is imploy'd, amongst other Things, to call for the House of Com∣mons to the House of Lords upon His Majesties Command; and to his Custody are Commit∣ted all such Peers as the House things fit to Commit upon any Trespass. Under him is a <HI>Yeoman Ʋsher</HI> that waits at the Door within, a <HI>Crier</HI> without, and a <HI>Sergeant at Mace</HI> always attending the Speaker.</P>
<P>The <HI>House of Commons,</HI> otherwise called the <HI>Lower house,</HI> is by much the greater Body of the two. For, as England consists of 40 Counties, in which there are 25 Cities, 8 Cinque-Ports,
<PB N="13" REF="344"/>
2 Universities, and 168 Borough-Towns, all which are Priviledged to send Members to Par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ament, if we reckon two Members from each, the Whole amounts to 486 Members. To which adding 24 from Wales, the Whole is 510.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there are three Boroughs in Eng∣land, each of which sends but one Member; viz. <HI>Abington</HI> in Oxfordshire, <HI>Higham-Ferrers</HI> in Northamptonshire, and <HI>Bewdley</HI> in Wor∣cestershire. But these three, wanting of the Number, are made up by the City of <HI>London,</HI> which sends four Members; and by the City of <HI>Bath,</HI> which sends three.</P>
<P>Of all this great Number, many are usually absent, upon Business, or Sickness, &amp;c. So that, if they be three hundred met together, 'tis counted a pretty full House. And, if they be but forty Members in all, they make a house.</P>
<P>This House, representing the whole Com∣mons of the Realm, do's generally consist of the Flower of the Gentry; some of them Noblemens Sons, Privy Counsellors, Courtiers, Men learned in the Law, Officers and Com∣manders, Merchants, &amp;c. but most of them Gentlemen of good Estates, with the advan∣tage of a liberal and genteel Education. This is an aggregate Body from all Parts of the Nation, whose Learning and Eloquence, Wit and Policy strive to outdo each other. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oble School for young Gentlemen chiefly, to be versed in Things relating to the English Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>Here they Sit promiscuously; except the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peaker, who has a Chair placed about the middle of the Room, with a Table before him,
<PB N="14" REF="345"/>the Clerk of the House sitting near him at the Table. But none wears a Robe but the Speaker, except (as I hinted before) the Members of Parliament for the City of London, who at their first Meeting appear in their Scarlet Robes. Every Member wears what he fancies most, and so do the Temporal Lords in their House, on all Days when the King comes not thither in State. To Strangers, I confess, it looks something odd, that so august an Assem∣bly, vested with a Legislative Power, and met together for the Exercise of the same, should have no proper Garb for so great a Council, but appear in their usual Dress. But Custom has so far prevailed against the Inconveniencies that attend those Formalities, (which the English Ne∣bility and Gentry are generally averse from) that they are not like to be ever ballanced by the Respect and Veneration that might be gained, as in forein Countries, by the small trouble of them.</P>
<P>The usual Time for the Meeting of each House is in the Forenoon, from eight or nine a clock till twelve or one; except Sundays, high Festivals, and Fast-Days.</P>
<P>These Things being premised, my next Bu∣siness is to speak about the Choice of the <HI>Speaker</HI> of the House of Commons; Who is the Mouth of the House, and so necessary a Part thereof, that they can do no Business with∣out him. For 'tis the Speakers Part to see the Orders of the House observed, to state the Bills that are brought in, to collect the Sub∣stance of the Debates, and the Sense of the House upon them.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="345"/>
<P>The fitst Day each Member is called by his Name, every one answering for what Place he serveth. That done, a Motion is made to chuse their Speaker; who ought to be a Per∣son of great Ability, and is usually one of the long Robe. And, to avoid all Delays, the Choice is commonly such as the King approves of.</P>
<P>This Choice is made by the Plurality of Votes. Upon which the Party chosen desires (according to ancient Custom) to be excused from so weighty an Office, and prays the House to proceed to a new Election. But he is commonly answered with a full Consent of Voices upon his Name. And then two of the principal Members go to him, and lead him from his Place to the Speakers Chair; where being set, they return to their Places.</P>
<P>Then the Speaker rises, and makes a short Speech to the House, consisting of his humble Thanks for their good Opinion of him, with Promises of his best Indeavours for their Ser∣vice.</P>
<P>At the Day appointed for his Presentation to the King (which is usually the next Day) His Majesty being come to the House of Lords in his Royal Robes, and the Lords also in their Robes, the Commons are called in. Who be∣ing come, the <HI>Speaker</HI> is brought between two of them, with low Obeysance to the Bar, and so presented at the Bar to His Majesty; where he makes likewise a modest Refusal. But the King approving the Commons Choice, and not allowing of his Excuse, the <HI>Speaker</HI> nakes an Oration to His Majesty; the Matter whereof is left to his own Thoughts, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Direction about it from the Commons. But it usually ends with these three Petitions.
<PB N="16" REF="346"/>First, that the Commons may have, during their Sitting, <HI>a free Acess to His Majesty;</HI> Se∣condly, <HI>Freedom of Speech in their House;</HI> And thirdly, <HI>Freedom from Arrests.</HI></P>
<P>Which humble and modest Way of the Peoples addressing to the King, for His Maje∣sties Assent to their ancient Priviledges, is be∣coming the Reverence due to the Majesty of the Prince. But it is no Argument (as some would have it) that either the Laws there∣upon made, or the Priviledges so allowed, are precarious, and may be refused them.</P>
<P>The Speakers Oration being answered in the Kings Name, by the Speaker of the House of Lords, and his Petitions allowed, he with the Commons departs to the Lower House. And then is the first time that the Mace is carried before him. Being come to the Chair, he makes a short Speech to the House to this effect, That, <HI>Whereas they have been pleased to chuse him for their Speaker, he hopes they will assist him in that Station, and favourably accept hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sincere Proceedings for their Service.</HI></P>
<P>That done, the Custom is to read, for that Time, only one Bill left unpast the last Sessions to give him Seisin (as it were) of his Place.</P>
<P>In the Lords House 'tis observable, that, when the King is absent, the Lords at their en∣trance do reverence to the Chair of State, as is (or should be) done by all that come into the Kings Prefence-Chamber.</P>
<P>And then the Judges, when called in upon any Point of Law, may si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> but may not be Covered, till the Speaker signify unto the them Leave of the Lords. The Kings Coun∣cil and Masters of Chancery sit also, but may
<PB N="17" REF="346"/>not to be Covered at all. And, when the King is present, the Judges stand, till the King gives them leave to sit.</P>
<P>But, we have dwelt long enough upon the Preliminaries (if I may say so) of a Session of Parliament; and 'tis time to shew their Proceedings, the manner of their Debates, and Passing of Bills and Acts, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus.</P>
<P>First, Care is taken in each House to Vote <HI>Thanks</HI> to his Majesty for his Gracious Speech. Then they appoint their standing Committees, of which more afterwards. And, to discover what Members are absent without just Cause or leave of the House, the House is called from time to time thus. Every Member whose Name is called over, uncovers his Head, and stands up at the mention of his Name. If he be ab∣sent, he is either excused and entred according∣ly; or, if none excuse him, he is entred <HI>De∣fieit.</HI> Such as are present are marked; and the Defaulters called over again the same Day, or the Day after, sometimes summoned and sometimes sent for by the Sergeant.</P>
<P>If any Intruder be discovered to sit in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse, being no Member thereof, he is pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ently committed to the Sergeants Custody for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me days; and at last, humbly begging the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardon of the House upon his Knees at the Bar, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is Released, paying his Fees.</P>
<P>As to the Matter of Debates, the House <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> free to take what Latitude they please, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithout confining themselves to the King's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peech.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="347"/>
<P>As they are best acquainted with the State of the Nation, and the publick Grievances, these often do take place. If any Laws are fit to be Abrogated, and new ones Made, this is a proper Subject for them to go upon. And, whilst they mind the Welfare of the Na∣tion, 'tis to be supposed they mind that of the King.</P>
<P>In order to which, any Member of the House may offer a <HI>Bill</HI> for the publick Good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> except it be for Imposing a Tax, which is not to be done but by Order of the House first had. And he that tenders the Bill must first open the Matter of it to the House, and offer the Reasons for admitting thereof; upon which the House will either admit, or deny it.</P>
<P>But, if any member desire, that an Act made, and in force, may be Repealed or Al∣tered, he is first to move the House in it, and have their Resolution, before any Bill to that purpose may be offered. If the House shall think it fit, upon the Reasons alledged, their usual Way is to appoint one or more of the Members to bring in a Bill for that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>A private Bill, that concerns any particular Per∣son, is not to be offered to the House, till the Leave of the House be desired, and the sub∣stance of such Bill made Known, either by Mo∣tion or Petition.</P>
<P>Petitions are usually prescribed by Members of the same County the Petitioners are of. If they be concerning private Persons, they are to be subscribed, and the Persons presenting them called in to the Bar, to avow the sub∣stance of the Petition, especially if it be a Com∣plaint against any.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="347"/>
<P>The preferring of Bills, either to be Read or Passed, ly's much in the Speaker's Power. For, though he be earnestly pressed by the House for the Reading of some one Bill; yet, if he have not had convenient time to Read the same over, and to make a Breviate thereof for his own Memory, he may claim a Priviledge to defer the Reading thereof to some other time. Formerly the Speaker had liberty to call for a trivate Bill, to be Read every Morning.</P>
<P>The Clerk of the House is usually directed by the Speaker, and sometimes by the House, what Bill to read, who with a loud and di∣stinct Voice first reads the Title of the Bill; and, after a little Pawse, the Bill it self. Which done, Kissing his hand, he delivers the same to the Speaker. Then the Speaker stands up un∣covered, whereas otherwise he sits with his Hat on; and holding the Bill in his hand says, <HI>This Bill is thus Intituled,</HI> and then reads the Title. Whereupon he opens to the House the substance of the Bill; which he does, either by trusting to his Memory, or with the help of a Breviate, filed to the Bill.</P>
<P>The effect of the Bill being thus opened, he declares to the House, <HI>that it is the first Read∣ing of the Bill,</HI> and delivers it again to the Clerk. For every Bill is to be Read three times, before it can be made an Act. Except a Bill of Indemnity coming from the King, which has but one Reading in each House, because the Subject ought to take it as the King will give it. The same it is with a Bill of Subsidies granted by the Clergy.</P>
<P>At the first Read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Bill 'tis not usual with the House to speak to it, or put it to the Question; but rather to take time till the se∣cond Reading, in order to consider of it in the
<PB N="20" REF="348"/>mean while. Nor to move for any Addition to it, which were to imply, that the Body of the Bill is good, before it comes to a regular Trial upon the Second Reading.</P>
<P>But, if any Bill originally begun in the Lower House happen, upon the first Reading to be debated to and fro, and that upon the De∣bate the House do call for the Question; the Question ought to be, not <HI>Whether the Bill shall be read the second time</HI> (which is the ordi∣nary Course,) but <HI>Whether it shall be Rejected</HI> Whereas to a Bill coming from the Lords so much favour and respect is shewn, that if, up∣on the first Reading, it be spoken against, and pressed to be put to the Question, the Speak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> does not make it for Rejection, as in the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mer Case, but for the Second Reading; and if that be denied, then for Rejection. Or ra∣ther in such a Case the Speaker does forbear t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make any Question at all thereupon, unless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be much pressed thereto; it being more pru∣dential to consider of it, before it be put to such a hazard.</P>
<P>When the Question for Rejection is made, and the greater Voice is to have the Bill Reject∣ed, the Clerk ought to set it down <HI>Rejected</HI> in the Journal, and so to Indorse it on the back of the Bill; and it shall be no more Read that Ses∣sion. But, if it be altered in any Point mare∣rial, both in the Body and the Title, it may be revived and received a second time. If the Voice be to have the Bill Retained, then it shall have his second Reading in Course.</P>
<P>'Tis unusual for one and the same Bill to be Read twice in one Day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>less there be special Reasons for it. Yet it has been done some∣times, for want of other Business, when the Bill was not of any great Consequence; but
<PB N="21" REF="348"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill upon Motion, and special Order. Also, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen special Committees, appointed for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rawing of a special Bill, have presented the same ready drawn to the House, it has often∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes happned, that the same Bill has been twice Read, and ordered to be Ingrossed the same Day. And there are Precedents of late, that a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill has been thrice Read, and Passed the same Day. By <HI>Sir Simon d'Ewes,</HI> Journ. 90. Col. 1. a Bill was Read the fourth time, before it pas∣sed the House; but this is rare, and worth the Observation.</P>
<P>Though a Bill may be secondly Read the next Day after the first Reading, yet the usual Course is to forbear for two or three Days, that Men may have more time to consider upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; except the Business requires haste.</P>
<P>After the Bill is secondly read, the Clerk, as before, in humble manner, delivers it to the Speaker; who reads again the Title and his Breviate, as he did upon the first Reading. Up∣on which he pawses a while, till some Member or other of the House do speak to it. For then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd not before, is the time when to speak. And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f after some convenient time, no Member <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eak against the Bill, either as to the Matter or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm of it, if it be a Bill originally begun in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Commons House, the Speaker may make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Question for <HI>Ingrossing</HI> thereof, that is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riting of it fair in a Parchment. The same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may do, if divers speak for the Bill, with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t excepting against the Form thereof.</P>
<P>In short, upon the second Reading, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaker having delivered the state of the Bill, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebates do commonly arise upon it. After <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich the House usually calls for the <HI>Commit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of the Bill,</HI> that is, for referring of it to a
<PB N="22" REF="349"/>Committee, in order to amend the Bill, which is done in this manner.</P>
<P>After every Speech is ended, the Speaker ought to stay a while, before he make the Que∣stion for the Committing thereof, to see whe∣ther any Man will speak thereto. And, when he perceives the Debate is at an end, he directs the House in these Words; <HI>As many as are of Opinion, that this Bill shall be Committed, say Yea.</HI> And, after the Affirmative Voice given he proceeds thus to the Negative, <HI>As many as are of the contrary Opinion, say No.</HI> The Speak∣er ought by his Ear to judge which of the Voi∣ces is the greatest; but, if the Thing be doubt∣ful, the House does Divide upon it. And, if upon Division of the House, it appear that the Numbers are equal, the Speaker has the casting Voice upon all Questions.</P>
<P>If the Affirmative Voice be the greater, he ought to put the House in mind about Naming of the <HI>Committees,</HI> which is thus. Any Mem∣ber of the House may be named to be one of the Committee; and the Clerk ought in his Journal to write under the Title of the Bill the Name of every one called for that purpose, at least of such whose Names in that Confusion he can distinctly hear. And this he ought to do without Partiality, either to those that name, or to the Party named. But he that has directly spoken against the Body of the Bill may no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be named to be of the Committee; it being supposed, that he who is against the Bill is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a proper Person to be imployed for the amend∣ing (or improving) of it.</P>
<P>A convenient Number being named, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Speaker puts the House in mind of the Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Place, when and where the Committees ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meet; which the Clerk ought likewise to ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="23" REF="349"/>into his Journal-book. And, when the House is in silence, he ought with a loud Voice to read out of his Book the Committees Names, with the Time and Place of their Meeting, that they may take notice thereof.</P>
<P>When a Bill sent from the Lords is twice Read, the Question ought to be for the Com∣mitment. If it be denied, it ought to be Read the third time; and the next Question, not for the Ingrossing, as when the Bill begun in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower House, but for the Passing of the Bill. For all Bills that come from the Lords come al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays Ingrossed. And, though the Question for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Passing of the Bill should in Course be then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade, when the Bill is denied to be Committed; yet it is not done, till the Bill be Read the third time.</P>
<P>As to the subject Matter of the Debates, the Speaker is not to argue for, or against any side; but only to hear the Arguments of the House, and (as I said before) to collect the substance of them. Neither has he any Voice, but the Casting Voice.</P>
<P>Whoever speaks to a Bill ought to stand up Uncovered, and direct his Speech to the Speaker. If two rise at the same time, and fall speaking together, the Speaker has power to determine which shall give way to the other. He that speaks is to be heard out, and not interrupted, unless by Mr. Speaker; which he may do in some Cases, as when the Discourse spins out to too great a length, or is from the Matter in hand, &amp;c.</P>
<P>None ought to speak twice to a Bill in one Day, unless sometimes by way of Explication. But, if the Bill be oftner Read than once, a Man may speak as often as the Bill is read.
<PB N="24" REF="350"/>And, if any Thing be done contrary to the Orders of the House, one may rise up and speak to it in the midst of a Debate, in case the Speaker do not. For, if the Speaker stand up, he is first to be heard; and while he stands up, the other must sit down. But whoever rises up to speak to the Orders of the House in the midst of a Debate must keep within that Line, and not fall to the Matter it self. If he do, he may be taken down by the Speaker, or any other Member, calling to the Orders of the House.</P>
<P>No Member in his Discourse is to mention the Name of any other then present, but to describe him by his Title or Addition, as <HI>that Noble Lord, that Worthy Knight.</HI> Or by his Of∣fice, as <HI>Judge, Sergeant, Gentleman of the long, or short Robe.</HI> Or by his Place, as <HI>the Gentle∣man near the Chair, near the Bar, on the other side;</HI> or <HI>that Gentleman that spake last, or last save one,</HI> or the like.</P>
<P>No reviling, or reflecting Expressions must be used. And, though freedom of Speech and Debates be an undoubted Priviledge of the House, yet whatsoever is spoken in the House is subject to the Censure of the House. But, if any speak irreverently or seditiously against the Prince or the Privy Council, he is not only Interrupted, but sometimes sent to the Tower.</P>
<P>After the Debate is ended, the Speaker ought to put the Question for Ingrossing. If the Plu∣rality of Voices be against it, the Clerk ought to make an Entry in his Journal, that the same was Dashed, and to make a Note of it upon the back of the Bill, and the Day when. If for
<PB N="25" REF="350"/>it, he must make his Entry and Note accor∣dingly.</P>
<P>A Bill that has been Committed, and is Re∣ported, ought not in an ordinary Course to be Recommitted, but either Dashed or Ingrossed. Yet, when the Matter is of Importance, it is sometimes Recommitted, and commonly to the same Committee.</P>
<P>Some few Days after the Bill has been order∣ed to be Ingrossed, the same being accordingly Ingrossed, is offered by the Speaker to be Read the third time, for the Passing thereof. And, to prevent carrying of Bills with a few Voi∣ces, it has sometimes been ordered, that no Bills should be put to the Passing until Nine of the Clock; at which time the House is com∣monly full, or shortly after.</P>
<P>But 'tis Observable, that the Speaker seldom puts any one Bill to the Passing by it self alone; for he commonly stays, till there be divers Bills ready Ingrossed for the third Reading. And, when he has a convenient Number, (as four, or five) he gives Notice to the House, that <HI>he pur∣poseth next Day to offer up some Bills for the Pas∣sing, and desireth the House to give special At∣tendance for that purpose.</HI> Accordingly the Day following, he puts 'em to the third Reading; first private Bills, till the House be pretty full, and then the publick ones Ingrossed.</P>
<P>A Bill being Read the third time by the Clerk of the House, he delivers it to the Speak∣er; who (as before) Reads the Title, explains the Nature of the Bill, and then tells the House that it has now been Read thrice, and that with their Favours he will put it to the Passing. But, before he does it, he pauseth a while, that the Members may have liberty to speak thereto. For, upon the third Reading, the Matter comes
<PB N="26" REF="351"/>to a fresh Debate, and for the most part it is more spoken unto at this time, than upon any of the former Readings. But then 'tis very rare to have it Recommitted, unless it be for some particular Clause or Proviso.</P>
<P>At last, the Debate being over, (the Speaker still holding the Bill in his hand) puts it to the Passing thus; <HI>As many as are of Opinion that this Bill should pass, say Yea.</HI> And after the Af∣firmative Voice given, he proceeds thus to the Negative, <HI>As many as are of the contrary Opi∣nion, say No.</HI> Whereupon the Speaker is to de∣clare his Opinion, whether the <HI>Yea's</HI> or the <HI>No</HI>'s have it; and his Opinion is to stand at the Judgement of the House, unless the Case be doubtful, and a Motion be made for the Divi∣ding of the House. Then the Question is put, whether the <HI>Yea</HI>'s or <HI>No</HI>'s are to go out of the House. Which commonly falls out to be the Lot of the <HI>Yea's,</HI> especially upon a new Bill; for it seems but reasonable, that those should sit still who are for the old Law, because they are in possession of it. To count the House, the Speaker does nominate two of the <HI>Yea's,</HI> and two of the <HI>No's.</HI> Who, having each a Staff in his Hand, are to count the Members that re∣main sitting in the House; and then to stand within the Door, two on each side, and count the Number of them who went forth, as they come in.</P>
<P>The House being thus told, the two Tellers that have the most Votes, standing at the Bar on the right hand of the two others (the rest being all set in their places) make their ap∣proaches together to the Table, with the usual Obeysance to the House. He that stands on the right hand declares to the Speaker the Num∣ber
<PB N="27" REF="351"/>of the <HI>Yea's</HI> and <HI>No's.</HI> That done, they all depart, with like Reverence into their Places; and Mr. Speaker makes the Report to the House.</P>
<P>If it be carried in the Affirmative, the Clerk is to enter the Vote, <HI>Resolved.</HI> If in the Ne∣gative, thus; <HI>The Question being put</HI> (then he sets down the Words of the Question) <HI>it passed in the Negative.</HI></P>
<P>While the House is divided, or dividing in order to gather the Voices, no Member is to speak, or to remove out of his Place, except such as go forth upon the Division.</P>
<P>The Bill being thus passed, the Clerk (if the Bill be originally exhibited in the House of Commons) ought to write within the Bill on the top toward the right hand, <HI>Soit baille aux Seigneurs,</HI> that is, Let it be sent up to the Lords. But, if the Bill passed be originally be∣gun in the Lords House, then ought the Clerk to write underneath the Subscription of the Lords (which always is at the foot of the Bill) <HI>Ace Bill les Communes ont assenti.</HI></P>
<P>And, when the Speaker has in his hands a convenient Number of Bills ready passed, he then puts the House in mind of sending them up to the Lords, and desires the House to ap∣point the Messengers. Amongst which a prin∣cipal Member of the House is appointed for that purpose, to whom the Bills are delivered in such Order as he is to present them to the Lords, by the Direction of the Speaker, except the House be pleased to give special Direction therein.</P>
<P>This principal Messenger, coming in the first Rank of his Company (usually consisting of 30 or 40 Members) to the Bar of the Lords House,
<PB N="28" REF="352"/>with three Congies, the Lords rise from their Places, and come down to meet them at the Bar. Then the chief Messenger tells them, that the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the House of Commons have sent unto their Lord∣ships certain Bills. Whereupon he reads the Title of every Bill, as it lies in order; and de∣livers the same in an humble manner to the Speaker of the House of Lords, who is come down of purpose to receive them.</P>
<P>But, when any Answer is to be delivered by the Speaker of this House, in the name and be∣half of the whole House, to such Knights and Burgesses as come from the Commons, the Lords are to keep their Places, and the Speaker is to deliver their Answer with his Head co∣vered, whilst the Knights and Burgesses stand uncovered toward the lower end of the House.</P>
<P>In this House the Lords give their Voices, beginning at the <HI>Puisne,</HI> or lowest Baron, and so the rest <HI>Seriatim,</HI> every one answering apart, <HI>Content,</HI> or <HI>Not Content;</HI> first for himself, and then severally for so many as he hath Letters and Proxies.</P>
<P>For any Peer of the Realm, by License of the King upon just Cause to absent, may make a Proxy, that is, may constitute another Lord to give his Voice in the Upper House, when any Difference of Opinion, and Division of the House shall happen. Otherwise, if no such Division fall out, it never comes to be que∣stioned or Known to whom such Proxies are directed.</P>
<P>By an Order of this House in the Reign of Charles I, it was Ordered, that no Peer should be capable of receiving above two Proxies,
<PB N="29" REF="352"/>or more to be numbred in any Cause vo∣ted.</P>
<P>If a Bill passed in one House, and being sent to the other, this demur upon it, then a <HI>Conference</HI> is demanded in the Painted Chamber. Where the deputed Members of each House meet, the Lords sitting cover∣ed at a Table, and the Commons standing bare with great respect. There the Business is debated; and if they cannot agree, it is nul∣led.</P>
<P>When Bills are passed by both Houses, upon three several Readings in either House, before they can have the force of Law, they must have the <HI>Royal Assent,</HI> which puts life into them. For, as there is no Act of Parliament but must have the Consent of the Lords and Commons, and the Royal Assent of the King; so whatsoever passeth in Parliament by this threefold Consent, hath the force of an Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>The Royal Assent, which used formerly to be deferred till the last Day of the Session, is given after this manner, whenever the King thinks fit. His Majesty then comes into the House of Peers, with his Crown on his Head, and cloathed with his Royal Robes. Being seat∣ed in his Chair of State, and all the Lords in their Robes, the House of Commons is sent for up (as before) by the Black Rod. Thus the King, Lords, and Commons being met, the Clerk of the Crown reads the Title of each Bill, and after the Reading of every Title, the Clerk of the Parliament pronounces the Royal Assent, according to his Instructions from the King. If it be a publick Bill, to which the
<PB N="30" REF="353"/>King assenteth, the Words are <HI>le Roy le veut,</HI> the King wills it. Whereas to a publick Bill which the King forbears to allow, the Answer is, <HI>Le Roy S'avisera,</HI> the King will consider; which is look'd upon as a civil Denial. To a Subsidy-Bill, <HI>le Roy remercie ses loyaux Sujets, accepte leur Benevolence, &amp; aussi le veut,</HI> the King thanks his loyal Subjects, accepts their Be∣nevolence, and so wills it. And to a private Bill allowed by the King, <HI>Soit fait comme il est desire,</HI> be it done as it is desired.</P>
<P>But, in case of a General Pardon, as it is the King's Gift, so the Return is from the Lords and Commons to His Majesty in these Words, <HI>los Prelats, Seigneurs, &amp; Communes en ce Parle∣ment assemblez, au nom de tous vos autres Sujets, remercient tres humblement Votre Majeste, &amp; pri∣ent Dieu qu'il vous donne bonne &amp; longue Vie en Sante,</HI> the Prelates, Lords, and Commons in this Parliament assembled in the Name of all Your other Subjects, do most humbly thank your Majesty, and pray God to give You a good and long Life in Health.</P>
<P>'Tis observable in the mean while, how we have retained about making of Laws, so many French Expressions, derived to us doubtless from the Normans.</P>
<P>The Use of <HI>Committees</HI> is so necessary for the Dispatch of Parliament Business, and their Way of managing Bills so fair and honourable, that it will be proper to add something to what has been said before concerning them.</P>
<P>They consist of such Members as each House chuses from among them, to make a strict Exa∣mination of the Bills, and therein such A∣mendments and Alterations as their Rea∣son will dictate upon a full Debate among
<PB N="31" REF="353"/>themselves, and to Report the same to the House.</P>
<P>Now there are three sorts of <HI>Committees,</HI> viz. <HI>Standing, Select,</HI> and <HI>Grand Committees.</HI></P>
<P>There are in the House of Commons five <HI>Standing Committees</HI> usually appointed in the beginning of the Parliament, and remaining du∣ring all the Session. Viz. One for <HI>Priviledges and Elections,</HI> another for <HI>Religion,</HI> a third for <HI>Grie∣vances,</HI> another for <HI>Courts of Justice,</HI> and the fifth for <HI>Trade.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst which the <HI>Committee for Privi∣ledges and Elections</HI> has always had the Prece∣dence, being commonly the first Committee ap∣pointed, either the same Day the Speaker did take his Place, or the next day after. Their Power was anciently to examine, and make Re∣port of all Cases touching Elections and Re∣turns, and all Cases for Priviledge as might fall out during the Parliament. But that Power has been since abridged, especially in Matters of Priviledge; which are heard in the House, and not in a Committee, unless in some spe∣cial Cases.</P>
<P>By a <HI>Select Committee,</HI> I mean a Committee particularly chosen to inquire into a Bill. In the Choice whereof this Rule is observed in the House, that they who have given their Voice against the Body of a Bill, cannot be of the Com∣mittee. And, though any Member of the House may be present at any select Committee, yet he is not to give any Vote there, unless he be na∣med to be of the Committee. As to their Number, they are seldom less than eight, but have been sometimes many more, and com∣monly Men well versed in Parliament Busi∣ness.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="354"/>
<P>Upon the first Meeting of a Committee in their Committee Chamber, they chuse among them a <HI>Chair-man,</HI> who is much like the Speak∣er in the House.</P>
<P>After any Bill is Committed upon the second Reading, it may be delivered indifferently to any of the Committee. Who are first to read it, and then to consider the same by Parts. If there be any Preamble, 'tis usually considered after the other Parts of the Bill. The Reason is, be∣cause upon Consideration of the body of the Bill such Alterations may therein be made, as may also occasion the Alteration of the Pream∣ble, which is best done last</P>
<P>The Committee may not raze, interline, or blot the Bill it self; but must in a Paper by it self set down the Amendments. Which ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oe done by setting down in the Paper the Number of the Folio where the Amendment is made, naming the Place particularly where the Words of the Amendment are to be Inserted, or those of the Bill Omitted. The Breviat also annexed to the Bill must be amended ac∣cordingly, and made to agree with the Bill.</P>
<P>When all the Amendments are perfected, e∣very one being Voted singly, all of them are to be read at the Committee, and put to the Question, <HI>Whether the same shall be Reported to the House.</HI> But, when the Vote is to be put, any Member of the Committee may move to add to those Amendments, or to Amend any o∣ther part of the Bill.</P>
<P>If the Vote of the Committee pass in the Af∣firmative, then commonly the Chair-man is appointed to make the Report. Which being done, that Committee is dissolved, and can act no more without a new Power.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="354"/>
<P>The usual Time for the House to receive the Reports is, after the House is full. And 'tis commonly the first Thing they go then upon; unless there be Bills Ingrossed, which are to take place, and publick Bills before pri∣vate.</P>
<P>The Reporter must first acquaint the House, That he is to make a Report from such a Com∣mittee, to whom such a Bill was Committed. Then standing in his place, he reads each of the Amendments, with the Coherence in the Bill; opens withal the Alterations, and shews the Rea∣sons of the Committee for such Amendments, until he has gone through all. When that is done, if his Seat be not next the Floor, he must come from his Place to the Bar, and so come up to the Table; where he delivers both the Bill and A∣mendments to the Clerk, to be read. Whilst he stands by the Clerk, the Clerk reads twice the Amendments only that are to be Inserted, and then he delivers the Bill with the Amend∣ments to the Speaker.</P>
<P>Whereupon any Member may speak against all, or any of the Amendments, and desire the Coherence to be read. But he is to make all his Objections at once to all the Amendments, without speaking again.</P>
<P>Note, that in the House of Lords, the Judges, and other Assistants there of the long Robe, are sometimes Joyned to the Lords Commit∣tees, though they have no Voice in the House.</P>
<P>But whereas in the House they sit covered by the Leave of the Peers, at a Committee they are always uncovered.</P>
<P>A <HI>Grand Committee,</HI> called a <HI>Committee of the whole House,</HI> is the House it self resolved into a
<PB N="34" REF="355"/>freedom of Debate from the Rules of the House to the Nature of a Committee; and therefore 'tis commonly called <HI>a Committee of the whole House.</HI> These Grand Committees are used, when any great Business is in hand that requires much Debate; as Bills to impose a Tax, or raise Mony from the People. Which Bills particularly do always begin in the House of Commons, as their Representatives.</P>
<P>In these Committees every Member is free to speak to one Question as often as he shall see Cause, (which is not permitted in the House) and to answer other Mens Reasons and Argu∣ments. So that it is a more open Way, and such as leads most to the Truth; the Pro∣ceeding more honourable and advantagious, both to King and Parliament.</P>
<P>When the House inclines to resolve it self into a Committee, it is done by a Question. Which being carried in the Affirmative, the Speaker leaves the Chair, and thereupon the Committee makes choice of a <HI>Chair-man.</HI> If a Dispute arises about the Choice, the Speaker is called back to his Chair; and after the Choice is cleared, he leaves it. The Chair∣man sits in the Clerks Place at the Table, and writes the Votes of the Committee; the ga∣thering whereof is according to the Rules of the House.</P>
<P>When the Committee has gone through the Matter in hand, the Chair-man, having read all the Votes, puts the Question, <HI>That the same be Reported to the House.</HI> If that be Re∣solved, he is to leave the Chair; and the Speaker being called again to the Chair, the Chair-man is to Report what has been resolved at the Committee, standing in his usual Place. From whence, if it be not in the Seat next
<PB N="35" REF="355"/>the Floor, he is to go down to the Bar, and so to bring up his Report to the Table.</P>
<P>In case the Committee cannot perfect the Business at that sitting, Leave is to be asked, <HI>That the Committee may Sit at another time on that Business.</HI> But, if the Matter has been throughly Debated, and is judged fit to be Resolved in the House, the Speaker is called to the Chair for that purpose.</P>
<P>In other Things the Proceedings are the same as in the House. And so much for the Committees.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the Manner of <HI>Adjourn∣ing, Proroguing,</HI> or <HI>Dissolving</HI> the Parliament, which is done at the Kings Pleasure, and that in the House of Lords, with the same Ap∣pearance and Solemnity as I have already de∣scribed.</P>
<P>An <HI>Adjournment</HI> and <HI>Prorogation</HI> are to some convenient time appointed by the King him∣self; but with this Difference, that an <HI>Ad∣journment</HI> do's not conclude the Session, which a <HI>Prorogation</HI> do's. So that by an <HI>Adjournment</HI> all Things debated in both Houses remain <HI>in statu quo,</HI> and at the next Meeting may be brought to an Issue. Whereas a <HI>Prorogation</HI> makes a Session; and then such Bills as passed either House, or both Houses, and had not the Royal Assent, must at the next Assembly begin anew, before they can be brought to perfection.</P>
<P>Upon an <HI>Adjournment,</HI> or <HI>Prorogation,</HI> the King do's usually make a Speech to both Houses of Parliament. And he ought to be there in Person, or by Representation, as on the Day of their first sitting, Now the Kings Person may be represented by Commission under the
<PB N="36" REF="356"/>Great Seal to certain Lords in Parliament, au∣thorizing them to begin, adjourn, prorogue, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But 'tis Observable, that each House has also a Power to Adjourn themselves, which when they do, 'tis at the most but for a few Days.</P>
<P>A <HI>Dissolution</HI> is that whereby the House of Commons becomes Vacant, in order to a new Election. Now a Parliament may be Dissolved by the King at any time, whether they be actu∣ally sitting, or not.</P>
<P>But, if a Parliament do sit, and be Dissolved, without any Act of Parliament passed, or Judgment given, 'tis no Session of Parliament, but a Convention.</P>
<P>The King being the Head of the Parliament, if his Death happens when there is a Parlia∣ment, 'tis <HI>ipso facto</HI> Dissolved.</P>
<P>'Twas a Custom of old, after every Session of Parliament, for the Sheriff to Proclaim, by the Kings Command, the several Acts passed in that Session, that none might pretend Ignorance. And yet, without that Proclamation, the Law supposes every one has noticeby his Represen∣tative of what is transacted in Parliament. But that Custom has been laid aside, since Printing came to be of common Use.</P>
<P>The Parliament ought to sit, by Law, at least once in three Years.</P>
<P>Thus I have laid open the Supream Court of England, which without the Kings Con∣currence can legally, do nothing that's binding to the Nation, but with it can do any thing. For whatever is done by this Consent is called firm, stable, and <HI>sanctum,</HI> and is taken for Law. Thus the King and Parliament may abrogate old Laws, and make new, settle the Succession to the Crown, Define of doubtful Rights
<PB N="37" REF="356"/>whereof no Law is made, Appoint Taxes and Subsidies, Establish Forms of Religion, Natu∣ralize Aliens, Legitimate Bastards, Adjudge an Infant (or Minor) to be of full Age, At∣taint a Man of Treason after his Death, Con∣demn or Absolve them who are put upon their Trial, Give the most free Pardons, Restore in Bloud and Name, &amp;c. And the Consent of the Parliament is taken to be the Consent of every Englishman, being there present in Per∣son, or by Procuration.</P>
<P>King John having resigned up the Crown of England to the Pope, and submitted to take it at his hand again at a yearly Tribute, the Pope (in the Reign of Edward III.) demanded his Rent, and all the Arrears. Upon which issued this Resolve of the Parliament, <HI>that neither the King, nor any other, could put the Realm, nor the People thereof, into a forein Subjection, with∣out their Assent.</HI> This was a high Resolution in Law, in one of the highest Points of Law, concerning the Kings Claim of an absolute Power, when the Pope was in his height. How∣ever this intimates, that with their joynt Con∣sent the Crown may be disposed of.</P>
<P>But, how transcendent soever be the Power and Authority of the King and Parliament, yet it do's not extend so far as to bar, re∣strain, or make void subsequent Parliaments; and, tho divers Parliaments have attempted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, yet they could never effect it. For the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter Parliament hath still a Power to abrogate, suspend, qualify, explain, or make void the former in the Whole, or any Part thereof, notwithstanding any Words of Restraint, Pro∣hibition, or Penalty in the former; it being a Maxim in the Law of Parliament, <HI>Quod Leges
<PB N="38" REF="357"/>posteriores priores contrarias abrogant.</HI> 'Twas therefore but in vain, that the late King James pretended so to settle that Liberty of Conscience which he ushered in by his Declaration, as to make it a Law unalterable, like the Laws of the Medes and Persians. It was but a Blind for Dissenters to bring them into his Snare; and, tho he had really designed it, he must have been at least Immortal to secure it.</P>
<P>One of the fundamental and principal Ends of Parliaments was to Redress Grievances, and ease the People of Oppressions. The chief Care whereof is in the House of Com∣mons, as being the Grand Inquest of the Realm, summoned from all Parts to present publick Grievances to be redressed, and pub∣lick Delinquents punished, as corrupted Coun∣sellours, Judges, and Magistrates. Therefore Parliaments are a great Check to Men in Authority, and consequently abhorred by De∣linquents. Who must expect one time or other to be called to a strict and impartial Account, and be punished according to their Demerits. Remember, said the Lord Bacon to his Friend <HI>Sr. Lionel Cranfield,</HI> when he was made Lord Treasurer, that <HI>a Parliament will come.</HI></P>
<P>In this Case the House of Commons (the Parliament sitting) Impeaches, and the House of Lords are the Judges; the Commons In∣form, Present, and Manage the Evidence, the Lords upon a full Trial give Judgment upon it. And such is the Priviledge of the House of Commons in this particular, that they may Impeach the highest Lord in the Kingdom, either Spiritual or Temporal; and he is not to have the benefit of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act (that is, he cannot come out upon Bail) till
<PB N="39" REF="357"/>his Trial be over, or the Parliament Dissolved, which last some of the late Judges have de∣clared for. But the Lords cannot proceed a∣gainst a Commoner, except upon a Complaint of the Commons.</P>
<P>In a Case of Misdemeanour both the Lords Spiritual and Temporal are Judges, and the Kings Assent to the Judgment is not necessary. But, if the Crime be Capital, the Lords Spiri∣tual (tho, as Barons, they might sit as Judges, yet they) absent themselves during the Trial; because, by the Decrees of the Church, they may not be Judges of Life and Death. For, by an Ordinance made at the Council at West∣minster in 21 Hen. 2. all Clergymen were for∣bidden <HI>agitare Judicium Sanguinis,</HI> upon pain to be deprived both of Dignities and Orders.</P>
<P>When a Peer is Impeached of High Trea∣son, a Court is usually erected for his Trial in Westminster-Hall; and the King makes a Lord Steward (which commonly is the Lord Chan∣cellour) to sit as Judge thereof. The Trial being over, the Lords Temporal resorting to their House give Judgment upon it, by Voting the Party arraigned, upon their Honours, <HI>Guilty, or not Guilty;</HI> and he is either Con∣demned, or Acquitted by the Plurality of Voices. If found Guilty, he receives Sentence accord∣ingly by the Mouth of the Lord High Ste∣ward.</P>
<P>The House of Lords is also, in Civil Causes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he highest Court of Judicature; consisting of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Lords Spiritual and Temporal as Judges, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sisted with the most eminent Lawyers both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Common and Civil Law. And from this Court there lies no Appeal, only the cause (or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome Point or other of it) may be brought
<PB N="40" REF="358"/>again before the Lords upon a new Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>In Case of Recovery of Damages, or Resti∣tution, the Parties are to have their Remedy (the Parliament being ended) in the Chance∣ry, and not in any inferiour Court at the Com∣mon Law. But the Lords in Parliament may direct how it shall be levied.</P>
<P>In short, by the ancient Laws and Constitu∣tions of this Kingdom, it belongs to the House of Peers to interpret Acts of Parliament, in Time of Parliament, in any Cause that shall be brought before Them.</P>
<P>I conclude with the <HI>Priviledges of Parlia∣ment,</HI> which are great in both Houses, and fit for so honourable a Court.</P>
<P>First, as to the Persons of the Commoners, they are Priviledged from Suits, Arrests, Im∣prisonments, except in Case of Treason and Felony; also, from Attendance on Trials in inferiour Courts, serving on Juries, and the like. Their necessary Servants that tend upon them during the Parliament, are also Priviledged from Arrest, except in the aforesaid Cases. Which Priviledge is their due, <HI>eundo, morando, redeundo,</HI> that is, not only for that time the Parliament sits, but also during 40 Days before, and 40 Days after the Parliament finished. And that, not only for the Persons of Mem∣bers, and their necessary Servants; but also, in some Cases, for their Goods and Estates du∣ring that Time.</P>
<P>Moreover this Priviledge do's likewise ex∣tend to such Officers as attend the Parliament; as the Clerks, the Sergeant at Arms, the Por∣ter of the Door, and the like.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="358"/>
<P>But, if one was Arrested before he was chosen Burgess, he is not to have the Privi∣ledge of the House.</P>
<P>Many are the Precedents, which shew the Resentments of this House against such as have offered to act contrary to these Priviledges, and their severe Proceedings against some of them, either for serving a <HI>Subpoena</HI> upon, or Ar∣resting a Member of this House, or refusing to deliver a Member arrested for Debt, the Par∣liament sitting. For common Reason will have it, that the King and his whole Realm having an Interest in the Body of every one of its Members, all private Interest should yield to the Publick, so that no Man should be with∣drawn from the Service of the House.</P>
<P>And so much has been the Priviledge of the House insisted on, that it has been a Question, Whether any Member of the House could con∣sent to be sued during the Session; because the Priviledge is not so much the Person's the House's. And therefore, when any Per∣son has been brought to the Bar for any Of∣fence of this nature, the Speaker has usually charged the Person in the name of the whole House, as a Breach of the Priviledge of this House.</P>
<P>Also, for offering to threaten, or to give abusive Language to any Member of the House, or to speak irreverently of the Court of Par∣liament, in Time of Parliament, several have been sent for by the Sergeant to answer it to the House, and Committed.</P>
<P>Dec. 1641. it was Resolved, that <HI>the setting of any Gards about this House, without the Con∣sent of the House, is a Breach of the Priviledge of this House, and that therefore such Gards ought to be dismissed.</HI></P>
<PB N="42" REF="359"/>
<P>Which Resolve was followed by three others <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> The first, that <HI>the Pri∣viledges of Parliament were broken by his Maje∣sties taking notice of the Bill for suppressing of Souldiers, being in agitation in both Houses, and not agreed on.</HI> The second, that <HI>his Majesty, in propounding a Limitation and provisional Clause to be added to the Bill, before it was presented to Him by the Consent of both Houses, was a Breach of the Priviledge of Parliament.</HI> The third, that <HI>His Majesty expressing his Displeasure against some Persons, for Matters moved in the Parliament, during the Debate and preparation of that Bill, was a Breach of the Priviledge of Par∣liament.</HI></P>
<P>And, whereas in January following the King did come to the House of Commons in a war∣like manner with armed Men, some posted at the very Door of the House, and others in other Places and Passages near it, to the Di∣sturbance of the Members then fitting, and treating in a peaceable and orderly manner of the great Affairs of the Kingdoms of England and Ireland; and His Majesty, having placed himself in the Speakers Chair, did demand the Persons of divers Members of the House to be delivered unto him; It was thereupon declared by the House, that <HI>the same is a high Breach of the Rights and Priviledges of Parlia∣ment, and inconsistent with the Liberty and Free∣dom thereof; and therefore the House doth con∣ceive, they could not with safety of their own Persons, or the Indemnities of the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, sit there any longer, without a full Vindication of so high a Breach of Priviledge, and a sufficient Gard wherein they might conside.</HI></P>
<PB N="43" REF="359"/>
<P>Lastly, both Houses of Parliament are the proper Judges of their respective Priviledges, and the inferiour Courts have nothing to do with it.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the King's Privy Council.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEXT to the Court of Parliament, which is the great Wheel that gives motion to the rest, is <HI>the Kings Privy Council.</HI> A Court of great Honour and Antiquity; In∣corporated (as it were) to the King Himself, and bearing part of his Cares in the great Bu∣finess of the Government. Insomuch that, up∣on their Wisdom, Care, and Watchfulness de∣pends the Honour and Welfare of His Maje∣sties Dominions, in all Parts of the World. For, according to their Oath, they are chiefly to Advise the King upon all Emergencies to the best of their Judgment, with all the Fide∣lity and Secrecy that becomes their Station. And, as the King has the sole Nomination of them, so 'tis his main Interest to make choice of such eminent Persons as are best able, with their Wisdom, Experience, and Integrity, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswer those great Ends they are appointed for.</P>
<P>They ought to be Persons of several Capa∣cities, that nothing be wanting for good Coun∣sel and Advice in a Court from whence in a great measure depends the Safety, Honour, and
<PB N="44" REF="360"/>Welfare of the King and Kingdom. General∣ly they are pickt out amongst the Nobility; and, for Things that relate to Church Affairs the Arch-bishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London use to be Members thereof.</P>
<P>In the late Kings Reign, not only Popish Lords were admitted contrary to Law; but, in defiance as it were of the Nation, a Tray∣tor by the Law, and the worst of Counsellours, a mercurial hot-headed <HI>Jesuit,</HI> whose perni∣cious Counsels and Influences proved accord∣ingly fatal to King James, and all the Po∣pish Party.</P>
<P>As for the Number of Privy Counsellours, 'tis at His Majesties pleasure. Anciently they used to be but twelve, or thereabouts; but, since, their Number has increased sometimes to forty.</P>
<P>The Privy Council is kept in the Kings Court, or Pallace, and the King himself do's commonly sit with them. The usual Days for their sitting is Wednesdays and Fridays, in the Morning out of Parliament or Term-time, and in the Afternoon in Parliament or Term∣time. But, upon extraordinary Occasions, the King calls them together at any time. Ac∣cordingly they wait on His Majesty in the Council-Chamber, and fit at the Council Board in their Order, bare-headed, when the King presides. To whom His Majesty declares what He thinks fit, and desires their Advice in it. At all Debates the lowest Counsellour delivers his Opinion first, that so he may be the more free; and the King last of all, by declaring his Judgment, determines the Matter.</P>
<P>'Tis with the Advice of the Privy Council, that the King puts out Proclamations, Orders, and Declarations, which being grounded upon
<PB N="45" REF="360"/>Statute, or Common Law, are binding to the subject. And, upon any sudden Emergency, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herein the publick Safety may be Indangered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or want of speedy Redress, the King and Council may take a latitude of Power sutable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Occasion.</P>
<P>Formerly the Council heard and determi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Causes between Party and Party. But of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, lest private Causes should hinder the Pub∣lick, they seldom meddle with them, but leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em to the Kings Courts of Justice.</P>
<P>There are two distinct and important Offices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>longing to this Court. The first is the <HI>Lord Presidents,</HI> who is one of the Nine Great officers of the Crown. He is called Lord Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dent of the Privy Council, because by his office he is in a manner the Director of it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Tis he that reports to the King, when His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ajesty has been absent from the Council, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate of the Businesses transacted there.</P>
<P>The other Great Office is that of <HI>Secretary,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmonly called a <HI>Secretary of State;</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmerly was single, till about the end of Henry III. his Reign. Who, considering the Im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtance of this great and weighty Office, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought fit to have it discharged by two Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns of equal Authority, and therefore both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed <HI>Principal Secretaries of State.</HI></P>
<P>In those Days, and some while after (says <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Chamberlain</HI>) they sat not at Council-board. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, having prepared their Business in a Room joyning to the Council-Chamber, they came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and stood on either hand of the King; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d nothing was debated at the Table, until <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Secretaries had gone through with their
<PB N="46" REF="361"/>Proposals. Which Method afterwards was al∣tered in Q. Elizabeths Reign; who seldom coming to Council ordered the two Secretaries to take their places as Privy Counsellours, which has continued ever since. And a Coun∣cil is seldom or never held, without the pre∣sence of one of them at the least.</P>
<P>Besides the publick Concerns of the Nation, most of which pass through their hands, they are also concerned with Grants, Pardons, Dis∣pensations, &amp;c. relating to private Persons. For in their hands are lodged most of the Sub∣jects Requests to be represented to the King; whereupon they make Dispatches, according to His Majesties Directions. In short, so great is their Trust, and their Imployment of that great latitude, that it requires their constant Attendance upon the King.</P>
<P>As for Home Concerns, whether publick o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> private, both the Secretaries do equally re∣ceive and dispatch whatever is brought to them. But, for forein Affairs, each has his distinct Province; receiving all Letters and Addresse from, and making all Dispatches to the severa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Princes and States in his Province.</P>
<P>They keep each of them his Office (called the <HI>Secretaries Office</HI>) at Whitehall: Where they have also Lodgings for their own Accom∣modation, and those that attend upon it; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a liberal Diet at the Kings Charge, or Board wages in lieu of it. Their settled Allowanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is little less than 2000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year to each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them; besides Perquisites.</P>
<P>The Secretaries and Clerks they imploy u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣der them are wholly at their own choice, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have no Dependance upon any other.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="361"/>
<P>Lastly, they have the Custody of the <HI>Signet,</HI> one of the Kings Seals. To which belongs the <HI>Signet-Office,</HI> where four Clerks wait Monthly by turns, preparing such Things as are to pass the <HI>Signet,</HI> in order to the Privy Seal, or Great Seal. He that is in waiting is always to at∣tend the Court, wheresoever it removes; and to prepare such Bills or Letters for the King to sign (not being Matter of Law) as by War∣rant from the King, or Secretaries of State, or Lords of the Council he is directed to prepare. And to this Office all Grants prepared by them∣selves, or the Kings Learned Council at Law, for the Kings hand, are returned, when signed, and there transcribed again. The Transcripti∣on is carried to one of the Principal Secreta∣ties of State, to be sealed with the Signet. This done, it is directed to the Lord Privy Seal, and is his Warrant for issuing out a Privy Seal upon it. But then it must be first trans∣cribed by the Clerks of the Seal, who are also four in Number; and, when it has the Privy Seal affixt, 'tis sufficient for the Payment of any Monies out of the Exchequer, and for se∣veral other Uses. If the Grant requires the passing the Great Seal, as several Grants do, the Privy Seal is a Warrant to the Lord Chan∣cellour (or the Lords Commissioners) to pass it, as the Signet was to the Lord Privy Seal. But here also a new Transcription must be made of the Grant. The Reason why a Grant must go through so many Hands and Seals, be∣fore it can be perfected, is, that it may be duly considered, and all Objections cleared, be∣fore it take its effect.</P>
<P>The <HI>Paper-Office,</HI> at Whitehall, is also de∣pending on the Secretaries of State. Where all the Papers and Dispatches that pass through
<PB N="48" REF="362"/>their Offices (as Matters of State and Council, Letters, Intelligences, and Negotiations of forein Ministers here, or of the Kings Ministers abroad) are from time to time transmitted, and there remain, disposed by way of Library. The Keeper whereof has a yearly Salary of 160 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> payable out of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>To conclude, the Lords of the Privy Coun∣cil have always been of such high value and esteem, that if a Man did but strike another in a Privy Counsellors House, or elsewhere in his presence, he was fined for the same. To con∣spire the Death of any of them was Felony in any of the Kings Servants, and to kill one of them was High Treason.</P>
<P>A Privy Counsellour, though but a Gentle∣man, has precedence of all Knights Baronets, and younger Sons of all Barons and Viscounts. And a Secretary of State has this special Ho∣nour, that, if he be a Baron, he takes place (as such) of all other Barons. So honourable an Imployment it is, that in the late Reign the Earl of Sunderland, was both principal Se∣cretary of State, and Lord President of the Privy Council.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the High Court of Chancery, otherwise called the Court of Equity.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I come now to the <HI>Courts of Judicature</HI> held at Westminster, viz. the <HI>Courts of Chancery, Kings Bench, Common Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as, Exchequer,</HI> and <HI>Dutchy of Lancaster;</HI> whereof the <HI>three first</HI> are held at Westminster Hall, the <HI>Common-Pleas</HI> near the Gate, the <HI>Chancery</HI> and <HI>Kings Bench</HI> at the further end of the Hall.</P>
<P>All the fore-mentioned Courts are opened four times a Year, called the four Terms; Viz. <HI>Easter, Trinity, Michaelmas,</HI> and <HI>Hilary Term.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Easter-Term</HI> begins always the 17th Day after Easter, and lasteth 27 Days. <HI>Trinity</HI> (or <HI>Mid∣summer</HI>) <HI>Term</HI> begins the fifth Day after Trini∣ty Sunday, and lasteth 20 Days. <HI>Michaelmas-Term</HI> begins the 23th of October, and lasteth 37 Days. And <HI>Hilary-Term</HI> (so called from <HI>S. Hilary</HI> a Bishop) beginneth the 23 of Janua∣ry, and lasteth 21 Days.</P>
<P>Next to the Parliament of England, and the Kings Privy Council, by whose Influences the Nation is chiefly governed under the King, the <HI>High Court of Chancery</HI> is the chief, and the most ancient Court of Judicature. Other∣wise
<PB N="50" REF="363"/>called the <HI>Court of Equity,</HI> in opposition to other inferiour Courts, the Judges whereof are tied to the Letter of the Law; Whereas this is a Court of Mercy, in which the Rigour of the Law is tempered with Equity. And there∣fore the Kings of England would have this Court Superiour to the other Tribunals, as well as for being the Original of all other Courts, and the Fountain of all our Proceedings in Law. For, as <HI>Sir Edward Coke</HI> says, this Court is <HI>Of∣ficina Justitiae,</HI> out of which all Original Writs and all Commissions which pass under the Great Seal go forth, which Great Seal is <HI>Clavis Regni,</HI> the Key of the Kingdom; and for those ends this Court is always open.</P>
<P>In the Chancery are two Courts, one Ordi∣nary, and the other Extraordinary. In the first the Proceedings are in Latine, <HI>Secundum Legem &amp; Consuetudinem Angliae,</HI> according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. In the second, by English Bill, <HI>Secundum aequum &amp; bonum,</HI> accor∣ding to Equity.</P>
<P>The Manner of Proceeding is much like that in the Courts of the Civil Law; the Actions by Bill or Plaint, the Witnesses examined in private, and the Decrees in English or Latin, not in French. No Jury of twelve Men, but all Sentences given by the Judge of the Court.</P>
<P>The Judge is the <HI>Lord Chancellour,</HI> or <HI>Lord Keeper</HI> of the Great Seal, the highest Dignity that a Lay-man is capable of in England, and held of the King <HI>durante Beneplacito.</HI> But now this Office is executed by three Lords Commis∣sioners.</P>
<P>Next to whom there are twelve Assistants called <HI>Masters of the Chancery,</HI> who are Civilians. Their Salary is each 100 Pound, paid out of
<PB N="51" REF="363"/>the Exchequer quarterly, besides Robe-mony. Three of these at a time sit in the Chancery Court in Term-time, and two out of Term, when the Chancellour sits to hear Causes at his own House Who often refers to them the further hearing of Causes, &amp;c. These Masters have a publick Office, where one or more of them do constantly attend, to take Affida∣vits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The chief of them is the <HI>Master of the Rolls,</HI> whose Place is both very honourable and bene∣ficial. The same is in the King's Gift, either Life, or during his Majesties Pleasure. And he is called <HI>Master of the Rolls,</HI> as having the Custody of all Charters, Patents, Commissions, Deeds, and Recognizances, which being made up in Rolls of Parchment, gave Occasion for that Name. From whence the ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House where the same are Kept is also called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rolls;</HI> which, being founded at first for the converted Jews, was, after their Expulsion out of Eng∣land, annext for ever to the Office of Master of the Rolls. Here are kept all the Rolls since the beginning of Richard the Third's Reign; and the former Rolls, in the Tower.</P>
<P>In this House the Master of the Rolls may <HI>Jure Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cii,</HI> and by vertue of a Commission, hear Causes, with two Masters, and without the Chancellour. He has in his Gift those considerable Offices of the Six Clerks in Chan∣cery, the Examiners Offices, three Clerks of the Petty-bag, and the six Clerks of the Rolls Chappel, where the Rolls are kept.</P>
<P>In Parliament-time, when he sits in the House of Lords, he sits upon the Second Wool∣sack, next to the Lord Chief Justice of Eng∣and.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="364"/>
<P>Next in degree to the Twelve Masters in Chancery are the <HI>Six Clerks</HI> aforesaid, who keep their several Offices at a Place called the <HI>Six Clerks Office</HI> in Chancery-Lane, and constantly Keep Commons together in Term-time. Their Business is for the English part of this Court, to inroll Commissions, Pardons, Patents, War∣rants &amp;c. that are passed the Great Seal. They are also Attorneys for Plaintiffs and Defendants, in Causes depending in this Court.</P>
<P>Under these are Sixty other Clerks, viz. ten to each; amongst which some get four, or five hundred Pounds a Year, and some more. These also have their Under-Clerks, who dis∣patch with them the Business of this Of∣fice.</P>
<P>For the Latine Part, there is the <HI>Cursitors Of∣fice,</HI> Kept near Lincolns Inn. Of these there are 24, whereof one Principal, and two Assis∣tants. Their Business is to make out Original Writs, for which purpose each of them has certain Counties and Cities allotted to him, in∣to which he makes out such Original Writs as are required. These Clerks are a Corporation of themselves, who execute their Offices by themselves or Deputies.</P>
<P>There are several Officers besides, belonging to the Chancery. As the <HI>Clerk of the Crown;</HI> Who, either by himself or Deputy, is conti∣nually to attend the Lord Chancellour, or Lord Keeper, for special Marters of State, and has a Place in the House of Lords. He makes all Commissions of Peace, of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> Goal-Delivery, and upon the Death or Removal of any Members of Parliament sitting, makes all Writs for New Elections.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="364"/>
<P>There is also a <HI>Protonotary,</HI> whose Office is chiefly to dispatch Commissions for Embassies; A <HI>Register of the Court of Chancery,</HI> and two <HI>Registers for the Rolls.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the Hamper,</HI> or <HI>Hanaper;</HI> Who receives all the Mony due to the King for the Seals of Charters, Patents, Commissions, and Writs. In Term-time, and at all times of Sealing, he attends the Chancery-Court, with all Sealed Charters, Patents, &amp;c. put up in Lea∣thern Bags. Instead of which, Hampers were probably used in our Fore-fathers time, and the Clerk called from thence Clerk of the Hamper. Those Bags are delivered by the Clerk to the <HI>Comptroller of the Hamper.</HI></P>
<P>Three <HI>Clerks of the Petty-Bag,</HI> whose Office is to make all Patents for Customers, Comp∣trollers, all <HI>Conge d'Eslires,</HI> first Summons of No∣bility, Clergy, Knights, Citizens, and Burges∣ses to Parliament, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>six Clerks of the Rolls Chappel,</HI> which to∣gethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Clerks of the Petty-bag are un∣der the Master of the Rolls. And so are the <HI>Two E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>caminers,</HI> whose Office is to examine the Witnesses on their Oaths in any Suit on both sides.</P>
<P>A <HI>Clerk of the Patents,</HI> another <HI>of the Re∣ports,</HI> and a <HI>Clerk</HI> (or <HI>Secretary</HI>) <HI>of the Pre∣sentation of Spiritual Benefices.</HI></P>
<P>There is besides a <HI>Subpoena</HI> Office, to issue out Writs or Summons for Persons to appear in Chancery. Another Office, for filing all Affidavits in the Court of Chancery. Besides the <HI>Alienation Office,</HI> to which are carried all Writs of Covenant and Entry, (whereupon Fines are levied, and Recoveries suffered) to have Fines for Alienation set and paid thereup∣on.
<PB N="54" REF="365"/>This Office is executed by 3 Commissio∣ners, who set those Fines</P>
<P>The <HI>Warden of the Fleet,</HI> or Keeper of the Fleet-Prison, is a considerable Office. His Bu∣siness is to take care of the Prisoners there, who are commonly such as are sent thither from this Court, for Contempt to the King or his Laws; though there are others, upon the Account of Debts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There is also a <HI>Sergeant at Arms,</HI> whose Of∣fice is to bear a gilt Mace before the Lord Chan∣cellour, or Keeper.</P>
<P>Lastly, whereas other Courts of Justice are never open but in Term-time, this is at all times open. For, if a Man be wrongfully Im∣prisoned in the Vacation, the Lord Chancellour may grant a <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and do him Justice according to Law, as well in Vacation as in Term-time. Which is not in the Power either of the King's Bench, or Common-Pleas, to do in the Vacation. This Court likewise may grant Prohibitions at any time, either in Term or Vacation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Court of Kings Bench.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THis Court is called the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> be∣cause in it are handled all Pleas of the Crown; as all manner of Treasons, Felonies, Misprision of Treason, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But it has Power besides to examine and cor∣rect all Errours <HI>in fait,</HI> and in Law, of all the Judges and Justices of the Realm in their Judge∣ments and Proceeding in Courts of Record; and this not only in Pleas of the Crown, but in all Pleas real, personal, and mixt, the Court of Exchequer excepted.</P>
<P>This Court has also Power to correct other Errours and Misdemeanors extrajudicial, tend∣ing to the Breach of the Peace, or Oppression of the Subject. It grants Prohibitions to Courts Temporal and Ecclesiastical, to Keep them with∣in their proper Jurisdiction; and may bail any Person for any Offence whatsoever. If a Free∣man in City, Borough, or Town Corporate, be Disfranchised unjustly, this Court may relieve the Party, although he has no Priviledge in it.</P>
<P>This Court moreover has power to hold Plea by Bill for Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Promise, and all other personal Actions, against any that is in the Marshals Custody, or any Officer, Mi∣nister, or Clerk of the Court. For, if they should be sued in any other Court, they would
<PB N="56" REF="366"/>be allowed the Priviledge of this, in respect of their necessary Attendance here; and, lest there should be a failure of Justice, they shall be Im∣pleaded here by Bill, though these Actions be common Pleas. Likewise the Officers, Mini∣sters, and Clerks of this Court, priviledged by Law, may Implead others by Bill here in the foresaid Actions.</P>
<P>In short, the Jurisdiction of this Court is ge∣neral, and extends all over England. 'Tis more uncontrolable than any other Court, because the Law presumes the King to be there in per∣son. For anciently the Kings of England sat sometimes in this Court, and that on a high Bench, his Judges at his Feet, on a low Bench. From whence some think this Court came to be called the <HI>King's Bench.</HI> However the Judica∣ture always belonged to the Judges, and in the King's presence (as now in his absence) they answered all Motions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>So Supream is also the Jurisdiction of this Court, that, if any Record be removed hither, it cannot (being as it were in its Center) be remanded back, but by an Act of Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>In this Court sit commonly four Grave Re∣verend Judges, The principal whereof is called the <HI>Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench,</HI> and is thus created by Writ. <HI>A. B. Militi Salutem. Sciatis quod Constituimus Vos Judiciarium no∣strum Capitalem, ad Placita coram nobis tenenda, durante Beneplacito nostro. Teste meipso apud</HI> Westm.</P>
<P>The rest of the Judges of the King's Bench hold their Places by Letters Patent in these Words. <HI>Rex omnibus ad quos praesentes Litera pervenerint, Salutem. Sciatis quod Constituimus dilectum &amp; fidelem B. C. Militem unum Justicia∣riorum,
<PB N="57" REF="366"/>ad Placita coram nobis tenenda, durante Beneplacito nostro. Teste,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Though in the Writ or Patent made to these Judges they are not named Sergeants, yet none can be a Judge of this Court, unless he be a Sergeant of the Degree of the Coif, that is, a Sergeant at Law; who, upon taking this De∣gree, is obliged to wear a Lawn Coif under a black Cap.</P>
<P>These Judges, or Justices, are the Sovereign Justices of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> Goal-Delivery, Conservators of the Peace, &amp;c. in the Realm. So that, when this Court comes and sits in any County, the Justices of <HI>Eire,</HI> of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Ter∣miner,</HI> and <HI>Goal-Delivery,</HI> &amp;c. are <HI>ipso facto</HI> void, without writing to them. They are likewise the Sovereign Coroners of the Land; and there∣fore where the Sheriff and Coroners may receive Appeals by Bill, much rather the Justices of this Court may do it.</P>
<P>Their Salary from the King is each 1000 l. <HI>per Annum,</HI> besides Robes and Liveries out of the great Wardrobe, and two Tun of Wine to the Lord Chief Justice.</P>
<P>In this Court all young Lawyers that have been called to the Bar are allowed to practise.</P>
<P>Here are three distinct <HI>Offices;</HI> Viz. the <HI>Crown Office,</HI> the <HI>Protonotaries,</HI> and the <HI>Custos Brevium's Office.</HI></P>
<P>To the first belong, the <HI>Clerk of the Crown,</HI> a <HI>Secondary,</HI> and several <HI>entring Clerks.</HI> The first is a Cap-Officer, who sits covered in Court. The <HI>entring Clerks</HI> have Counties assigned them, and usually are Attornies for Defendants prose∣cuted at the King's Suit.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="367"/>
<P>To the second belongs the <HI>Protonotary,</HI> a Cap-Officer, to whom belong all Clerks of the Plea∣side; his <HI>Secondary,</HI> and <HI>Deputy</HI> for signing Writs, a <HI>Clerk</HI> for filing Declarations, a <HI>Clerk</HI> of the <HI>Remembrances,</HI> a <HI>Clerk</HI> of the <HI>Bails</HI> and <HI>Posteas.</HI></P>
<P>To the <HI>Custos Brevium's Office</HI> belongs the <HI>Custos Brevium &amp; Recordorum,</HI> a Cap-Officer, who is also Clerk of the Essoins and Warrants of Attorney; two <HI>Clerks,</HI> one of the Inner, and the other of the outward Treasury, who are all Officers for Life.</P>
<P>There are besides two <HI>Book-Bearers,</HI> who car∣ry the Records into Court, a <HI>Marshal</HI> or Keeper of the King's Bench Prison, who has a <HI>Deputy,</HI> a <HI>Clerk of the Papers,</HI> a <HI>Clerk of the Rules,</HI> and his <HI>Deputy,</HI> a <HI>Clerk of the Errours,</HI> and his <HI>De∣puty,</HI> a <HI>Sealer of Writs,</HI> a <HI>Head-Crier,</HI> two <HI>Un∣der-Criers,</HI> two <HI>Ushers,</HI> and four <HI>Tip-staves.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Court of Common-Pleas.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THis Court is so called, because here are debated the usual Pleas between Subject and Subject. For in this Court all Civil Causes, real and personal, are usually tried, ac∣cording to the strictness of the Law. And real Actions are pleadable; nor Fines levied, or Re∣coveries suffered, in no other Court but this. Which may also grant Prohibitions, as the Court of the King's Bench doth.</P>
<P>Here are also commonly four Judges, the chief whereof is called the <HI>Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas,</HI> or <HI>of the Common Bench.</HI> Who holds his Place by Letters Patent, as the other Three do, <HI>derante Beneplacito.</HI> Their Fee is the same as that of the King's Bench Judges.</P>
<P>None but Sergeants at Law may plead in this Court; and so many of them as the King shall appoint, are bound by Oath to assist all that have any Cause depending here; for which the King allows them Fees, Reward, and Robes.</P>
<P>Many are the Officers belonging to this Court. The principal whereof is the <HI>Custos Brevium,</HI> who is the first Clerk of the Court, and whose Office is to receive and keep all Writs returna∣ble here, to receive of the Protonotaries all the Records of <HI>Nisi-prius,</HI> called <HI>Posteas.</HI> He holds
<PB N="60" REF="368"/>his Place by Patent from the King, has the Gift of the second Protontaries Place, and of the Clerk of the Juries.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Three Protonotaries,</HI> who enter and in∣roll all Declarations, Pleadings, Assizes, Judg∣ments, and Actions, and make out Judicial Writs. In whose Offices all the Attorneys of this Court enter their Causes.</P>
<P>Now each of them has a <HI>Secondary,</HI> who draws up the Rules of Court, &amp;c. And these Se∣condaries are commonly the ablest Clerks or Attorneys of the Court.</P>
<P>There is also a <HI>Chirographer,</HI> whose chief Bu∣siness is to ingross Fines acknowledged; and for whose Office there is a <HI>Register,</HI> and se∣veral <HI>Clerks,</HI> having their several Counties al∣lotted them, for which they Ingross the Fines levied of Lands in their respective Divi∣sions.</P>
<P>All which forementioned Officers are Sworn, and hold their Offices for Life, as a Freehold. They sit in the Court covered with black round Caps, such as were in fashion before the Inven∣tion of Hats.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are in this Court three Of∣ficers unsworn, who hold their Places <HI>durante Beneplacito.</HI> Viz. 1. A <HI>Clerk of the Treasury,</HI> whose Office is in the Gift of the Lord Chief Justice. He Keeps the Records of this Court, and makes out (amongst other Things) all Records of <HI>Nist Prius.</HI> 2. The <HI>Clerk of the Inrollments of Fines and Recoveries,</HI> who is by Statute under the three Puisne Judges of this Court, and removable at their Pleasure. 3. The <HI>Clerk of the Outlawries;</HI> who, after the Party is returned Outlawed, makes out the Writs of <HI>Capias Uelegatum,</HI> in the name of the Attorney General, to whom
<PB N="61" REF="368"/>this Office does properly belong, and who ex∣erciseth it by Deputy.</P>
<P>There is besides a <HI>Clerk of the Warrants,</HI> who enters all Warrants of Attorney for Plaintiff and Defendant, and inrolls all Deeds acknow∣ledged before any of the Judges of the Com∣mon Pleas.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the King's Silver,</HI> to whom e∣very Fine (or final Agreement upon Sale of Land) is brought, after it has been with the <HI>Custos Brevium,</HI> and to whom Mony is paid for the King's Use.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the Juries,</HI> who makes out the Writs called <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and other Writs for appearance of the Jury.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk of the Essoins,</HI> or Excuses for law∣ful Cause of Absence.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Clerk of the Supersedeas,</HI> who makes out the Writs of <HI>Supersedeas,</HI> which formerly was done by an Exigenter.</P>
<P>Here are also 15 <HI>Filazers</HI> for the several Counties of England; who (amongst many other Things) make out all Process upon Original Writs. These are in the Gift of the Lord Chief Justice, and hold for Life. As also</P>
<P>The <HI>four Exigenters;</HI> whose Office is to make all Exigents and Proclamations in all Actions where Process of Outlawry does ly. Now an Exigent is a Writ so called, because it requires the Parties Appearance to answer the Law, and lies against a Transgressor of the Law that can't be found, nor any of his Goods within the County. Whereupon he is Summoned by the Sheriff at five several County Courts; and, if he appear not, he is Outlawed, that is, exclu∣ded from the Protection of the Law. Which
<PB N="62" REF="369"/>looks upon him as unworthy of it, that acts in contempt of the Law.</P>
<P>Lastly, there are four <HI>Criers,</HI> and a <HI>Porter,</HI> belonging to this Court.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Courts of Exchequer, and Dutchy of Lancaster.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THese two I joyn together, because they both concern the King's Revenue, and take Cognizance of all Causes arising from it.</P>
<P>The Judges of this Court are called <HI>Barons of the Exchequer,</HI> ever since Barons of the Realm used to sit here as Judges; though in latter times Men learned in the Law have usually fil∣led up this Station. They are commonly four that sit in this Tribunal, as in the two former Courts; the principal whereof is stiled Lord <HI>Chief Baron.</HI> But 'tis to be observed, that the Lord Treasurer and the Chancellour of the Ex∣chequer, may sit here as Principal, though they seldom do it.</P>
<P>The Lord Chief Baron is created by Letters Patents, to hold this Dignity, <HI>Quamdiu se bene gesserit,</HI> which the Law intends for Life; so that he is better fixed than either of the Chief Justices. His Place is of great Honour and Profit. In Matter of Law, Information, and Plea, he answers the Bar, and gives Order for Judgement thereupon. He alone in the Term-time
<PB N="63" REF="369"/>doth sit upon <HI>Nisi prius,</HI> that come out of the King's Remembrancer's Office, or out of the Office of the Clerk of the Pleas, which can not be dispatched in the Mornings for want of time. He takes Recognizances for the King's Debts, for Appearances, and Observing of Or∣ders. He takes the Presentation of all Officers in Court under himself, and of the Mayor of London, and sees the King's Remembrancer to give them their Oaths. He also takes the Declaration of certain Receivers Accounts of the Lands of the late Augmentation made before him by the Auditors of the Shires, and gives two <HI>Parcel-makers</HI> Places by vertue of his Office.</P>
<P>In his absence, his Place is supplied by the o∣ther three Barons, his Assistants, according to their Seniority.</P>
<P>These Judges, and those of the two former Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas, make up the Number of Twelve; who all sit in on their Tribunals in Robes, and square Caps.</P>
<P>Next to the four Barons of this Court, is first the <HI>Cursitor,</HI> who administers the Oath to the Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Searchers, Surveyors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Custom-House.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>King's Remembrancer,</HI> in whose Of∣fice are entred the States of all Accompts what∣soever concerning the King's Revenue, except Sheriffs and Bayliffs Accounts. Here also are taken all Securities, either by Bonds or Recog∣nizances to the King, for the faithful Perfor∣mance of those Persons imployed in the Collect∣ing of his Majesties Revenue, and for the Pay∣ment of his Debts. And all Proceedings upon
<PB N="64" REF="370"/>the said Bonds or Recognizances, or any other Bonds taken in the Kings Name by Officers thereunto appointed under the Great Seal of England, besides all Proceedings upon any Sta∣tute by Information for Custom, Excises, or any other Penal Law concerning the Kings Re∣venue, are transmitted hither for the Reco∣very thereof, and properly belong to this Office. From whence accordingly issue forth Process, to cause all Accountants to come in, and ac∣count. And, as the Exchequer do's consist of two Courts, the one of Law, and the other of Equity, all Proceedings touching the same are in this Office, with many other Things relating to the Kings Revenue.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Sheriffs, and their two Courts, called the County-Court, and the Sheriffs Turn; of Justices of Peace, and their Quarter-Sessions; with an Account of the Grand Jury; of the Coroners, Clerks of the Markets, and their Courts.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR the Civil Government of Counties, Cities, Towns, and Villages, there are divers Officers, to whom belong several Courts for the due Administration of Justice.</P>
<P>First in every County (except Durham and Westmorland) there is a <HI>Sheriff,</HI> which is a yearly Office, the Power whereof extends all over the County, except such Cities and Towns as are Counties of themselves, that is, which have the Priviledge of Counties. In Middle∣sex only there are two <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> upon the ac∣count of London the Capital City of the King∣dom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sheriffs</HI> were heretofore chosen, as Knights of the Shire, by the Suffrages of the People: But now they are appointed by the King, after this manner. First the Judges no∣minate six fit Men of each County, that is, Knights or Esquires of good Estates. Out of
<PB N="68" REF="372"/>that Number three are chosen by the Privy Counsellors, and the twelve Judges assembled in the Exchequer, and there sworn in order to it. And out of this Number the King him∣self chuses whom he thinks fit.</P>
<P>Heretofore the same Sheriff served many years together, and to this day this Office is hereditary to the <HI>Cliffords</HI> in the County of Westmorland, by Charter from King John.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sheriffs</HI> Office is both Ministerial, and Judicial. As Ministerial, he is to execute the Kings Mandates, and all Writs directed to him out of the Kings Courts, to Impannel Juries, to bring Causes and Criminals to Trial, and to see the Sentences executed. In short, there is no Execution of the Law but by the Sheriff, for by him all Suits begin, and all Process served. He is likewise to collect all publick Profit, as Taxes, Fines, Distresses, and Amer∣ciaments into the Kings Exche quer, or where∣ever the King shall appoint; and to make such Payments out of it, as he shall have due Order for. At the Assizes he is to wait on, and gard the Itinerant Judges, so long as they continue within the County.</P>
<P>As to the Judicial Part of his Office, he holds, by virtue thereof, two several Courts; the one called the <HI>County-Court,</HI> and the other the <HI>Sheriffs Turn.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>County-Court</HI> is held every Month by the <HI>Sheriff</HI> himself, or his Deputy the <HI>Ʋnder Sheriff</HI> wherein he hears and determines Civil Causes of the County under 40 shillings, which an∣ciently was a considerable Sum. But this is no Court of Record.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sheriffs Turn</HI> is held twice a Year, viz. within a month after Easter, and within a mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after Michaelmas. In this Court he inquire
<PB N="69" REF="372"/>of all Criminal Offences against the Common Law, wherein he is not restrained by any Statute. For all the Bishops, Earls, Barons, and all such as have Hundreds of their own to be kept, are exempted from the Jurisdiction of this Court. In short, this is a Court of Re∣cord, in all Things that belong to it. 'Tis the Kings Leet through all the County, whereof the <HI>Sheriff</HI> is Judge, this Court being incident to his Office.</P>
<P>The <HI>Justices of Peace,</HI> anciently called <HI>War∣dens</HI> (or <HI>Gardians</HI>) <HI>of the Peace,</HI> are such a∣mongst the Gentry (and sometimes amongst the Clergy) as are appointed by the Kings Com∣mission to attend the Peace of the County where they dwell.</P>
<P>Their Original is from the first year of Ed∣ward the III, but they were not called Justices till the 36th Year of his Reign.</P>
<P>Their Office is to call before them, ex∣amine, and commit to Prison Rioters, wan∣dering Rogues, Thieves, Murderers, false Moneyers, those that hold Conspiracies, and almost all Delinquents that may occasion the Breach of Peace and Quiet to the Kings Sub∣jects, and to see them brought forth in due time to Trial.</P>
<P>If any one Swears himself to be in danger of his Life upon the Threats of another, he may bind him over to his good Behaviour, and the Justice shall commit him to Prison, unless the finds good Security for his good Behaviour during a Year and a Day.</P>
<P>Among the Justices of Peace, the Number whereof is as His Majesty thinks fit, there are some particularly called <HI>Justices of the Quorum,</HI> from these Words in the Commission, <HI>Quorum
<PB N="70" REF="373"/>A.B. unum esse volumus.</HI> As for Example, Where a Commission is directed to seven Persons, or any three of them <HI>Whereof</HI> A.B. and C.D. to be two, these are said to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> because the rest cannot proceed without them. So that a <HI>Ju∣stice of Peace and Quorum</HI> is one without whom the rest of the Justices in some Cases cannot proceed.</P>
<P>Every Quarter, or three Months, the <HI>Justices</HI> of each County meet at the chief (or Shire) Town; from whence this Court came to be called the <HI>Quarter Sessions.</HI> Where the Grand Inquest (or Jury) of the County is summoned to appear; who upon Oath are to inquire of Malefactors, Rioters, and suspected Persons.</P>
<P>The <HI>G and Jury</HI> do's commonly consist of 24 grave and substantial Gentlemen, or some of the better sort or Yeomen, chosen indiffe∣rently (or at least ought so to be) by the Sheriff out of the whole Shire, to consider of all Bills of Inditement preferred to the Court. Which Bills they do either approve by Writing upon them <HI>Billa Vera,</HI> or disallow by indorsing <HI>Ignoramus.</HI> Presently upon the Allowance of a Bill, the Party concerned is said to be Indited, and is committed to Prison. But what Bills are Disallowed are delivered to the Bench, by whom they are forthwith cancelled or torn. If the approved Bills touch Life and Death, they are further referred to another Jury to be considered of, because the Case is of such Importance; but others of lighter moment are proceeded upon by fining the De∣linquents, without any more ado. Unless the Party traverse the Inditement, or challenge it for Insufficiency, or remove the Cause to a higher Court by <HI>Certiorari;</HI> in which two former Cases it is referred to another Jury, and in the latter transmitted to a higher
<PB N="71" REF="373"/>Court. In short, the Trial is usually referred to the next Assizes, when the Judges at West∣minster go their Circuits.</P>
<P>Originally this Court seems to have been erected only for Matters touching the Peace, but now it extends much further. The She∣riff, or his Under-Sheriff, is bound to attend upon this Court, with his Constables, Bay∣liffs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are also in every County commonly four Officers, called <HI>Coroners</HI> (vulgarly pro∣nounced <HI>Crowners</HI>) because they deal princi∣pally with Pleas of the Crown, or Matters concerning the Crown. His Office is to In∣quire by a Jury of Neighbours how and by whom any Person came by a violent Death, and to enter the same upon Record. And, whereas the Sheriff in his Turn may inquire of all Felonies by the Common Law, except a Mans Death; the Coroner can inquire of no Felony but of the Death of Man, and that <HI>super visum Corporis,</HI> upon view of the Body. Which Inquisition of Death taken by him he ought to deliver at the next Goal-Delivery, or certify the same into the Kings Bench. Therefore he ought to put in writing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffect of the Evidence given to the Jury be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore him, and has power to bind over Wit∣nesses to the next Goal-Delivery in that Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>
<P>For doing his Office, he is to take nothing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon grievous Forfeiture. But by 3 <HI>H.</HI> 7. he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have upon an Inditement of Murder 13 <ABBR>s. d.</ABBR> of the Goods of the Murderer.</P>
<P>But, besides his Judicial, he has likewise a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inisterial Power as a Sheriff. As, when there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> just Exception taken to the Sheriff, Judi∣cial
<PB N="72" REF="374"/>Process shall be awarded to the Coroners for the execution of the Kings Writs, in which Cases he is <HI>locum tenens Vicecomitis,</HI> or supplies the Sheriffs place. And in some special Case the Kings Original Writ shall be immediately directed unto him.</P>
<P>There are, as I said before, commonly four of these Officers in every County of England. But <HI>Cheshire</HI> has but two, and each Shire in Wales has no more.</P>
<P>The same are chosen by the Freeholders of the County, by virtue of a Writ out of the Chancery; and continue, notwithstanding the Demise of the King, in their Office. Which was of old in so great esteem, that none could have it under the degree of a Knight. And, by the Writ <HI>De Coronatore eligendo,</HI> the Party to be chosen must have sufficient Knowledge and Ability to execute this Office; which is implied in these Words, <HI>Et talem eligi facias qui melius sciat &amp; possit Officio illi intendere.</HI> After he is elected, the Sheriff is to take his Oath, only to execute his Office. And the Court which he holdeth is a Court of Record.</P>
<P>Every County also has an Officer called <HI>Clerk of the Market.</HI> Whose Office is to keep a Standard of all Weights and Measures, ex∣actly according to the Kings Standard kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Exchequer, and to see that none other be used in the same County. He is to seal a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Weights and Measures made exactly by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Standard in his Custody, and to burn such a are otherwise. He has a Court, wherein h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may keep and hold a Plea.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Mayors and Aldermen, Bailiffs, Stewards, and their respective Courts; with an Account of the Constables.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Every City of England, says <HI>Dr. Chamber∣lain,</HI> is, by their Charters or Priviledges granted by several Kings, a little Com∣mon-wealth apart; governed, not (as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ties of France and Spain) by a Nobleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gentleman placed there by the King, but wholly by themselves. For in Cities the Ci∣tizens chuse themselves for their Governour <HI>Mayor,</HI> commonly out of 12 Aldermen. And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n some other Corporations, a <HI>Bayliff</HI> is chosen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a certain Number of Burgesses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mayor</HI> is the Kings Lieutenant, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring his Mayoralty (which is but for one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear) is in a manner a Judge to determine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atters, and to mitigate the Rigour of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w. Therefore he keeps a Court, with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethren the <HI>Aldermen.</HI> With these, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommon Council, he can make By-Laws, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e better Government of the City, provided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey be not repugnant to the known Laws of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Realm. So that the Mayor, Aldermen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Common Council assembled, are in a man∣ner,
<PB N="74" REF="375"/>an Image of the King, Lords, and Commons convened in Parliament.</P>
<P>If the Citizens be Taxed, 'tis by themselves or their Representatives; every Trade having some of their own Members always of the Council, to see that nothing be enacted to their Prejudice.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Sheriffs</HI> have also a good share in the Government of Cities; as being the proper Judges of Civil Causes within the same, and the principal Officers appointed to see all Executions done, whether Penal or Capi∣tal.</P>
<P>As every County of England is divided into Hundreds, so the King's Subjects formerly had Justice ministred to them by Officers of Hun∣dreds, called <HI>Bayliffs,</HI> who might hold Plea of Appeal and Approvers. But, in the Reign of Edward III, these Hundred Courts (certain Franchises excepted,) were dissolved into the County-Courts. Yet there are still divers con∣siderable Towns, the chief Magistrates whereof have retained the name of <HI>Bayliff,</HI> as Ipswich, Yarmouth, Colchester, &amp;c. Where the <HI>Bayliff's</HI> Authority is the same with the Mayor's in other Places, and they keep Courts accord∣ingly.</P>
<P>The Truth is, they differ in nothing but the Name. For the Mayor of London, before the Reign of Richard the First, was called the <HI>Bay∣liff</HI> of London. So King John, following the Example of Richard, made the <HI>Bayliff</HI> of Kings Lynn a Mayor, in the year 1204; and Henry V. made the <HI>Bayliff</HI> of Norwich a Mayor, Anno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 1419.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="375"/>
<P>But there are others to whom the name of <HI>Bayliff</HI> is still appropriate; as the <HI>Bayliff</HI> of Do∣ver Castle; that is, the Governour thereof. There be likewise <HI>Bayliffs</HI> of Mannors, or Hus∣bandry; such as have the Oversight of Under-Servants to private Men of great Substance, that set every Man to his Labour and Task, gather the Profits to their Lord and Master, and give him an Account thereof.</P>
<P>The vilest sort of <HI>Bayliffs</HI> to this day are those Officers that serve Writs, and Arrest Peo∣ple by virtue thereof. And these are of two Sorts, <HI>Bayliffs Errants,</HI> and <HI>Bayliffs of Franchi∣ses.</HI> The first are such as the Sheriff makes and appoints to go any where in the County to serve Writs, to summon the County, Sessions, Assizes, and such like. <HI>Bayliffs of Franchises</HI> be those that are appointed by every Lord of a Mannor, to do such Offices within his Liberty as the Bayliff Errant doth at large in the Coun∣ty.</P>
<P>By <HI>Stewards,</HI> I mean here such as are Im∣ployed by some Lords of Mannors to hold their Courts, called <HI>Court-Leet,</HI> or <HI>View of Frank∣pledge;</HI> the word <HI>Leet</HI> signifying properly a Law-Day.</P>
<P>This is a Court of Record, not incident to every Mannor; but to those only which by spe∣cial Grant, or long Prescription, hold the same. For 'tis likely Kings did not intrust any with this Power, but such as they had great Kind∣ness for and Confidence in. To this Court those that are within the Homage, and some∣times those out of it, are called to Swear Fi∣delity to the Prince. Here also Inquiry is made of Privy Conspiracies, Frays, Bloodshed, and
<PB N="76" REF="376"/>Murders. To which was added the Oversight of Measures. And what Offences are found, especially great ones, ought to be Certified to the Justices of Assize, by a Statute made in the Reign of Edward III. For in whose Mannor soever this Court be Kept, it is accounted the King's Court, because the Authority thereof originally belongs to the Crown.</P>
<P>In short, this Court (first derived from the Sheriffs Turn) is ordinarily Kept but twice a Year, and that at certain times.</P>
<P>But there is another Court incident to every Mannor, called <HI>Court-Baron,</HI> because in ancient times every Lord of a Mannor was stiled Ba∣ron.</P>
<P>To this Court are all the Tenants Summoned that belong to the Mannor; where part of the Tenants being Sworn, make a Jury, which is not called the Inquest, but the Homage. Here the Steward sits as Judge, and directs the Jury to enquire of such Things as are proper for this Court. And these principally Inquire of Copy-holders and Free-holders that be dead since the last Court, and bring in their Heirs and next Successors. They likewise Inquire of any Incroachment or Intrusion of Tenants a∣gainst the Lord, or among themselves. They also make Orders and Laws amongst them∣selves, with a Penalty annexed for Trans∣gressors payable to the Lord of the Man∣nor.</P>
<P>In short, these Courts are of great Use for Men that are willing to be ordered by their Neighbours, and who prefer their Quiet and Advantage in Husbandry to the Trouble and Charges of Law-Suits. Otherwise either Party
<PB N="77" REF="376"/>may procure a Writ out of a higher Court, to remove the Plea to Westminster.</P>
<P>Courts-Baron may be held every three Weeks, or at any longer time, according to the Lords pleasure.</P>
<P>I conclude with <HI>Constables,</HI> called in some Places <HI>Headboroughs,</HI> and in others <HI>Tithing-men,</HI> whose Office is only Ministerial. These Men, says <HI>Sir Thomas Smith,</HI> were formerly called <HI>Custodes Pacis,</HI> or Guardians of the Peace, and were in much greater esteem than they be now, whose Power and Authority he supposes to have been equal with that of the present Justices of Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Lambert</HI> looks upon this Office as a Stream of that great Dignity lodged in the Lord High Constable of England. Out of this high Ma∣gistracy, says he, were drawn those lower <HI>Con∣stables,</HI> which we call <HI>Constables of Hundreds and Franchises.</HI> First ordained by the Statute of Winchester, 13 <HI>Ed.</HI> I. which appoints for the Conservation of the Peace, and view of Ar∣mour, two Constables in every Hundred and Franchise, called in Latine <HI>Constabularii Capita∣les,</HI> in English, High Constables. And, by reason of the Increase both of People and Of∣fences, others were made in process of time, called <HI>Petty Constables,</HI> which are of like Nature, but of inferiour Authority to the o∣ther.</P>
<P>The Office of a Constable is properly to ap∣prehend such as break the Peace, and common Malefactors, and even Persons suspected of any Crime, upon a Charge given them, or a War∣rant for it from a Justice. For a Badge of his Authority, he carries a long Staff painted, with the King's Arms; and, for a Surprise, some∣times
<PB N="78" REF="377"/>he uses a short Staff, which he hides till he thinks it convenient to produce it. The Party apprehended he keeps in his Custody, till he can bring him before a Justice of Peace; who, upon a strict Examination of the Fact, and hear∣ing of the Evidence, commits the Party to Prison, if he sees cause, in order to his Trial. Upon which the Constable conducts him to Prison, and there delivers him to the Goalers Custody, with the <HI>Committimus</HI> directed by the Justice of Peace to the Jayler. And the Party mustly in Prison, till the Justices of Peace do meet either at their Quarter-Sessions, or at their Goal-Delivery, when the Prisoners are by Law either condemned, or acquit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</P>
<P>When he is upon Duty, and about to appre∣hend one, he may call his Neighbours to aid; and whoever declines to give him assistance, is liable by Law to Punishment.</P>
<P>In case of Theft, Robbery, or Murder, in a Country Town or Village, and the Malefactor be upon flight, the Constable having notice of it, is to raise the Parish in pursuit of him. And this is called <HI>Hue and Cry.</HI> If the Malefactor be not found in the Parish, the Constable and his Assistants are to go to the next, to get the <HI>Hue and Cry</HI> raised there by the Constable of it. In this manner the <HI>Hue and Cry</HI> is carried from Parish to Parish, till the Criminal be found. And that Parish which does not do its Duty, but gives way by its Negligence for the Male∣factors Escape, is not only to pay a Fine to the King, but must repay to the Party robbed his Damages.</P>
<P>When the Malefactor is taken, he is pre∣sently carried by the Constable, or any other by whom he was apprehended, to a Justice of
<PB N="79" REF="377"/>Peace. Who examines the Malefactor, writes the Examination, and (if he do confess) his Confession. Then he binds the Party robbed, or him that sueth, together with the Constable, and so many as can give Evidence against the Malefactor, to appear at the next Sessions of Goal-Delivery, there to give their Evidence for the King. He binds them in a Recognizance of 10. 20. 30. 40. or 100. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> more or less, accord∣ing to his Discretion and the quality of the Crime. Which, being certified under his hand, fails not to be levied upon Recognizance, if they fail of being there.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Constables,</HI> which formerly had much the same Authority as our modern Justices of Peace, are now subservient to them upon all Occasions, either to bring the Criminals before them, or to carry them by their Command to the common Prison. And accordingly this Of∣fice does commonly fall into the hands of Tradesmen and Artificers, and Men of small experience and ability; who hold it for a Year, there being commonly two of them to each Parish, chosen by the Vestry. But the hardest part of their Office in London, especially is their Watching a Nights, and walking the Rounds in their several Parishes. But then they have the chief Command of the Watch; and because seldom a greater Power appears a∣broad at that time, therefore a Constable came to be called the <HI>King of the Night.</HI></P>

<P>Now these Courts are called <HI>Assizes,</HI> and the Judges thereof <HI>Justices of Assize,</HI> from their Commission of <HI>Assize;</HI> by vertue whereof they are to do Right upon Writs called <HI>Assizes,</HI> and brought before them by such as are (or pretend to be) wrongfully thrust out of their Lands. The Writs so called, 1. Because they settle the Possession, and so an outward Right in him that obtaineth by them. 2. Because they were originally executed at a certain Time and Place formerly appointed. 3. For that they are tried commonly by special Courts appointed for that purpose.</P>
<P>But, besides this Commission, there are four others, by which these Itinerant Judges admi∣nister Justice in the Country. As, the <HI>Com∣mission to take Nisi-prius,</HI> directed to none
<PB N="82" REF="379"/>but the Judges themselves, and their Clerks of Assizes, by which they are called <HI>Justices of Nisi prius.</HI> Which is a common Adjournment of a Cause in the Common Pleas, to put it off to such a Day, <HI>Nisi prius Justiciarii venerint ad eas Partes ad capiendas Assisas,</HI> from which Words <HI>Nisi prius</HI> the Writ came to be called a Writ of <HI>Nisi prius,</HI> the Justices, <HI>Justices of Nisi prius,</HI> as well as <HI>Justices of Assize.</HI> Yet there is this Difference, that as <HI>Justices of Assize,</HI> they have Power to give Judgement in a Cause, whereas <HI>Justices of Nisi prius</HI> take only the Ver∣dict. Besides that those in a strict sense, med∣dle only with the possessory Writs called Assize; but these do deal in Causes both real and perso∣nal.</P>
<P>Another is a <HI>Commission of Peace,</HI> in every County of the Circuit.</P>
<P>But the largest <HI>Commission</HI> of all is That of <HI>Oyer and Terminer,</HI> directed to the Judges, and many others of the best account in their Cir∣cuits; but in this Commission, the Judges of Assize are of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> so as without them there can be no Proceedings. This Commission gives them Power to judge of Treasons, Mur∣ders, and all manner of Felonies and Misde∣meanors.</P>
<P>Lastly, they have a <HI>Commission of Goal Deli∣very,</HI> directed only to themselves, and the Clerk of the Assize associate. By which Commission they are to deal with every Pri∣soner in Goal, for what Offence soever he be there.</P>
<P>Now these Courts are usually held at the principal Town of every County, with great pomp, splendour, and feasting, two Judges being appointed for every Circuit. Then the Sheriff of the County is bound to attend in
<PB N="83" REF="379"/>person, with his Under-Officers, the Clerks, Stew∣ards of Courts, Bayliffs of Hundreds, Consta∣bles, Jaylors, Sergeants or Beadles, and a gal∣lant Train of Servants in rich Liveries, all ri∣ding on Horseback at the Reception of the Judges; whom they wait on and guard, so long as they continue in the County. If the Sheriff cannot come himself, he must depute one to fill up his Place; who is to be allowed by the Judges. The Justices of Peace are also to wait on the Judges. And, if either the Sheriff, or they fail in this part of their Duty, without lawful Impediment, the Judges may set a Fine upon him or them, at their pleasure and dis∣cretions.</P>
<P>The Dispatch of these Itinerant Judges in the Administration of Justice in their several Cir∣cuits is worthy our Observation. For with∣in each County all Controversies grown to Issue in the Courts at London, are commonly deter∣mined here in two or three Days. Which is done, not as in forein Countries, by the sole Arbitrement of the Judges, but by a <HI>Jury of Twelve Men</HI> in each County, chosen by the Sheriff thereof, and only directed in point of Law by the Judges. For every Trial by Assize (be the Action civil or criminal, publick or private, personal or real) is referred for the Fact to a Jury, as it is in most Courts of the Com∣mon Law; and, as they find it, so passeth the Judgement.</P>
<P>The Way of Trying Criminals in England being something singular and different from o∣ther Nations, it will not be improper (after that excellent and most ingenious Author, Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI>) to shew the Manner of it,
<PB N="84" REF="380"/>were it but for the satisfaction of Forei∣ners.</P>
<P>How Criminals are taken into Custody in order to their Trial, and how the same are In∣dited at the Quarter-Sessions, I have already shewed. The Inditement is no definitive Sen∣tence, but only <HI>Praejudicium,</HI> or the Opinion the Country has of the Malefactors Case. There∣fore Men are often Indited in their absence. But no Man once Indicted can be delivered without an Arraignment; for as a Jury of Twelve Men have given a Prejudice against him, so Twelve again must acquit or condemn him.</P>
<P>At the Assizes the Judges sit either in the Town-house, or in an open Place, where a Tribunal is set up for Judgement The Judges sit in the middle, the principal Justices of Peace on each side of them according to their Degree, and the rest on a lower Bench before the Judges Seat. Something lower a Table is set before them, at which the <HI>Custos Rotulorum</HI> or Keeper of Writs, the Under-Sheriff, the Es∣cheater, and the Clerks do sit. Near the Table there is a Bar for the Jury to come in, when they are called; and behind that space another Bar for the Prisoners to stand at, who are brought thither in Chains.</P>
<P>Then the Cryer crieth, and commandeth Si∣lence. One of the Judges makes a short Speech, wherein he declares (amongst other Things) the cause of their coming. His Speech is no sooner ended, but the Prisoners are called in by Name, and every one must answer to his Name. Then the Keeper of the Writs produces the In∣ditements, and the Judges name one, or two, or three of the Prisoners Indited, to proceed upon their Trial.</P>
<PB N="85" REF="380"/>
<P>The Clerk bids one of them come to the Bar, and hold up his hand. Then he charges him with his Crime, to which he bids him answer <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>If the Prisoner stands mute, and will not answer, after he has been once or twice so In∣terrogated (which happens very seldom,) he is Judged Mute, or Dumb by Con∣tumacy; the Punishment whereof is to be Pressed to Death, of which more after∣wards.</P>
<P>If the Prisoner cries <HI>Guilty,</HI> (which is but seldom too) his Trial is over, and all the Bu∣siness is to pronounce Sentence upon him, ac∣cording to Law.</P>
<P>But the common Answer is <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> though the Party be never so apparently Guilty, and his Answer be perhaps contrary to his Confes∣sion of the Fact before the Justice of Peace by whom he was examined and committed. The Reason is, because he flatters himself, that he may chance to come off for want of right Evi∣dence. For the Law of England is so ten∣der of Mens Lives, that unless the Evidences (which are upon their Oaths) be positive and clear against any Prisoner, he may come off.</P>
<P>Upon the Prisoner's pleading <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> the Clerk asketh him, whether he will be Tried by God and the Country. If he answer <HI>Yes,</HI> the Clerk tells him, he has been <HI>Indited</HI> of such a <HI>Crime,</HI> &amp;c. That he has pleaded <HI>Not Guilty</HI> to it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that being asked how he would be Tried, he has answered <HI>by God and the Country.</HI> Then he tells him of the <HI>Jury</HI> present, that represent the Country; and, if he has something to ob∣ject against any of them, he bids him take a
<PB N="86" REF="381"/>view of them, and speak, for that he stands upon Life and Death.</P>
<P>Upon this the Jury is Sworn, consisting of 12 Men at least. And, if the Prisoner be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Stranger, 'tis a Party Jury, consisting half o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Englishmen, and half of Foreiners. In case the Prisoner has no Exception to make against any of them, by that time Twelve are Sworn, these stand to give the Verdict. Whereupon the Crier says aloud, <HI>If any one can give Evi∣dence, or can say any thing against the Prisoner, let him come now, for he stands upon his Deli∣verance.</HI> If none come in, the Judge doth ask who sent him to Prison. And, if the Ju∣stice of Peace be present who did it, he de∣livers up the Examination he took of him, subscribed by those whom he has bound to give Evidence; who, for not appearing, must pay their Recognizance. In the mean time the Jury acquit the Prisoner, tho he has con∣fessed the Crime to the Justice of Peace.</P>
<P>But, if they come in that are bound to give Evidence, first the Justices Examination is read; and then the Party robbed (being pre∣sent) is sworn, next to him the Constable and such as were with him at the taking of the Prisoner, and at last as many more as are there to give Evidence. Who are all set in a con∣venient place to see the Judges and Justices, the Jury, and the Prisoner, so as to hear them, and to be heard of them all.</P>
<P>The Judge, after they be sworn, asketh first the Party robbed, if he know the Prisoner, and bids him look upon him. The Party rob∣bed says Yes, and upon that relates the Rob∣bery, with all its Circumstances. But the Prisoner standing still upon the Negative, those who were at the Taking of him, or any other
<PB N="87" REF="381"/>that can Evidence against him are heard one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter another.</P>
<P>The Prisoner on the other side is free to make what Defence he can. And, tho the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing be Party against him as one that has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oke his Peace, yet the Judges do freely hear what he can say for himself, provided he keep within bounds. But he is allowed no Council, which in Civil and Pecuniary Matters is ne∣ver denied; be it for Land, Rent, Right, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Possession, tho he plead against the King.</P>
<P>When the Judge has heard them all, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sks them if they can say any more. Upon their silence he directs the Jury, and bids them dis∣change their Consciences. If the Case be plain, they consult together without going from the Bar; and, if they do all agree, the Fore-man of the Jury, in the Name of himself and the rest, pronounces the Prisoner <HI>Guilty.</HI> If the Case requires a Debate, they withdraw into a Room, only with a Copy of the Inditement; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and there they are to remain by themselves, till they be all agreed on the Verdict, with∣out bread, drink, meat, or fire. To which purpose there is a Bayliff appointed to watch them. If but one of the Jury stands it out against the rest, he must either bring them over to him, or they must bring him over to them, before they can stir out of the Room, or have the least Refreshment in it. So that it is in the power of one to make all the rest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a manner Prisoners; and, if he be obsti∣tate, to put them to Inconveniencies for want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Necessaries, till he himself can bear with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem no longer.</P>
<P>When the Jury have agreed upon the Ver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ict, they give notice of it to the Bayliff, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay to be heard. Then the Prisoner being
<PB N="88" REF="382"/>sent for again to the Bar, each one of the Jury is called in by his Name, and he answer to it. The Clerk asketh, if they be agreed and who shall speak for them. Which being answered, the Prisoner is bidden to hold up his hand, to whom the Clerk speaks in these Words; <HI>Thou art Indited by the Name of</HI> A <HI>of such a Place,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and being Arraigned Tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleadest thereto</HI> Not Guilty; <HI>being Asked how Thou wouldst be Tried, Thou saidst</HI> By God and the Country; <HI>These honest Men were given t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thee by God and thy Prince for thy Country Hearken what they say.</HI> Then he asketh of the Jury, <HI>What say you? Is he Guilty, or No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Guilty?</HI> The Fore-man makes answer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one word, <HI>Guilty,</HI> or in two, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> The first is Death to the Prisoner, and the last Acquits him; for neither the Judges, nor the Justice can alter or reverse this Judgment.</P>
<P>Then the Clerk asketh, what Lands or Chat∣tels the Prisoner had at the time of the Fe∣lony committed. Which is commonly an∣swered by the Jury with an <HI>Ignoramus.</HI> But the Sheriff and the Escheator are diligent enough to find it out, both for the Princes and their own Advantage.</P>
<P>Upon this the Judge doth ask the Prisone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Convicted what he can say for himself, why Sentence should not pass upon him. If he ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> read never so little, he demands the <HI>Benefit of the Clergy,</HI> an ancient Liberty of the Church, which has been confirmed by divers Parlia∣ments. By vertue whereof one in Orders ar∣raigned of Felony by a Secular Judge, might pray his Clergy, which was as much as if he prayed to be delivered to his Ordinary, to purge himself of the Offence objected. But
<PB N="89" REF="382"/>the ancient Course of the Law in this point of Clergy is much altered, so that Lay-men have been made capable of this Benefit in many Cases; As in Theft of Oxen, Sheep, Mony, and other Things, not forcibly taken to the terrour of the Owner. So favourable is our Law, that for the first Fault the Felon shall be admitted to his Clergy. In order to which the Bishop sends a Clergy-man, with a Com∣mission under his Seal, to be Judge in that matter at every Goal-Delivery. If the Pri∣soner demands to be admitted to his Book, the Judge commonly gives him a Psalter, and turns to what place he pleases. The Prisoner reads as well as he can, and it happens most times but sadly. Then the Judge asketh of the Bishops Commissary, <HI>Legit ut Clericus?</HI> To which the Commissary must answer <HI>Legit,</HI> or <HI>Non legit;</HI> for these be the formal Words, and our Men of Law are the most precise in their Forms. If he say <HI>Legit,</HI> the Judge pro∣ceeds no further to Sentence of Death. But, if he say <HI>Non legit,</HI> the Sentence follows either that Day or the next, in these Words, <HI>Thou</HI> A. <HI>hast been Indited of</HI> such <HI>a Felony, and there∣fore Arraigned; Thou hast pleaded</HI> Not Guilty, <HI>and put thy self upon</HI> God and thy Country; <HI>They have found thee</HI> Guilty, <HI>and Thou hast no∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing to say for thy self; The Law is, that Thou halt return to the Place from whence thou camest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd from thence Thou shalt go to the Place of Execution, where Thou shalt Hang by the Neck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill Thou be dead.</HI> Whereupon he charges the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heriff with the Execution. But he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aimeth his Clergy in Cases where it is ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itted is in the presence of the Judges burnt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the brawn of his Hand with a hot Iron,
<PB N="90" REF="383"/>marked with the Letter <HI>T.</HI> for a Thief, or <HI>M.</HI> for Manslayer. Then he is delivered to the Bi∣shops Officer, to be kept in the Bishops Prison; from whence, after a certain time, he is deli∣vered by a Jury of Clerks. But, if he be taken and found Guilty again, and his Mark discovered, then 'tis his Lot to be hanged.</P>
<P>But he whom the Jury pronounces <HI>Not Guilty</HI> is Acquitted forthwith and Discharged, paying the Jaylor his Fees.</P>
<P>And, as to those Prisoners who stand not Indited, but were only sent to Prison upon Suspicion, the Way is to Proclaim 'em first in this manner; <HI>A. B. Prisoner stands here at the Bar; If any Man can say any thing against him, let him now speak, for the Prisoner stands at his Deliverance.</HI> If upon this no Evidence ap∣pears against him, he is set free, paying the Jaylor his Fees.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Court Martial, and Court of Admiralty.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Court Martial,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Court of Chivalry,</HI> is the Fountain of Martial Law, and is only held in Time of War, for Martial Discipline.</P>
<P>The proper <HI>Judges</HI> of this Court are the Lord <HI>High Constable,</HI> and the <HI>Earl Marshal of England;</HI> which last is also to see Execution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tone.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Admiralty</HI> is about Maritime Concerns, and the <HI>Judge</HI> thereof is commonly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dr. of the Civil Law. For, the Sea being out of the reach of the Common Law, the Pro∣ceeding of this Court, in all Civil Matters, is according to the Civil Law.</P>
<P>And, whereas the Sea by its Flux and Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ux advances and runs-back twice a Day, which makes the Bounds of the Sea and Land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovable every Day; It is agreed upon, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> far as the Low-Water Mark is observed, is within the Counties Jurisdiction, and Causes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence arising are Determinable by the Com∣mon Law. But, upon a full Tide, the Admiral has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urisdiction (as long as the Sea-flows) over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Matters done between the Low-Water Mark and the Land. So that here is, as <HI>Dr.
<PB N="92" REF="384"/>Chamberlain</HI> says, <HI>Divisum Imperium</HI> between the Common Law and the Court of Admi∣ralty.</P>
<P>Besides the Civil Law which this Court pro∣ceeds by, great Use is made here of the Mari∣time Laws of <HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Oleron;</HI> two Islands, the former whereof is in the Mediterranean not far from the Continent of Asia, the other in the Ocean near the Mouth of the Garonne in the Bay of Aquitain.</P>
<P>The Rhodian Laws were compiled by the Inhabitants of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> a People anciently very powerful at Sea; and whose Maritime Laws were esteemed so just and equitable, that the very Romans (so skilful in making of good Laws) referred all Debates and Controversies in Sea-Affairs to the Judgment of the Rhodian Laws.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Oleron,</HI> called <HI>le Rolle d' Oleron</HI> were made by Order of King Richard I, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possessed of Aquitain, and being at Oleron Which proved such excellent Laws for Sea-Matters, that they came to be almost a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much respected and made use of in these Western Parts, as the Rhodian Laws in the Levant. To which King Edward III, added very excellent Constitutions concerning Ma∣ritime Affairs, still in force. In Imitation whereof several other Sea-faring Nations have done the like, for their respective Sea-Trade.</P>
<P>As to Criminal Matters, especially about Piracy, the Proceeding in this Court of Ad∣miralty was, according to the Civil Law, till the Reign of Henry VIII. When two Statute were made for Criminal Matters to be trie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Witnesses and a Jury by the Kings spe∣cial Commission to the Lord Admiral, where

<P>The Writs and Decrees of this Court run in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Name of the Lord High Admiral, or Lords commissioners executing that Office; and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irected to all Vice-Admirals, Justices of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Constables<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arshals, and other Officers and Ministers as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell within Liberties as without.</P>

<P><HI>Of the Court of Marshalsea, the Courts of Conscience, the Court of Requests disused, the Forest-Courts, and Pie-powder Courts.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>first</HI> is the Court (or Seat) of the Knight Marshal of the Kings House, where he judges of Debts for which the Party has been Arrested within the Kings Verge, and sent to the Marshalsea. Which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Prison in Southwark, where this Court i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kept.</P>
<P>King Charles I. erected a Court by Letters Parents under the Great Seal, by the Name o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Curia Hospitij Domini Regis,</HI> &amp;c. which takes Cognizance more at large of all Causes tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Marshalsea could; of which the Knight Marshal or his Deputy are Judges.</P>
<P>The <HI>Courts of Conscience</HI> are inferiour Court<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> established and settled by Parliament in many Parts of the Realm, for the Relief of po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> People whose Debt do's not amount to forty Shillings. So that by any of these Courts the Creditor may recover his Debt, and the Debtor pay it at an easy rate.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Court of Requests,</HI> 'twas a Court of Equity, much of the same nature with the
<PB N="95" REF="385"/>Chancery, but inferiour to it. Called <HI>Court <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Requests,</HI> as being principally Instituted for the help of such Petitioners as in conscionable cases dealt by Supplication with the King. This Court followed the King, and was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt in any Place. But in process of time it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sumed so great a Power, and grew so burden∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and grievous to the Subject, that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken away (together with the Star-Chamber) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Statute made in the Reign of Charles I.</P>
<P>For the Conservation of the Kings Forests, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to prevent all Abuses therein, there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree Courts established; one called the <HI>Ju∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice of Eyres Seat,</HI> another the <HI>Swainmote,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e third the <HI>Court of Attachment.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> is (or should be, by ancient Cu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m) held every third Year by the Justices Eyre of the Forest, journeying up and down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the purpose aforesaid.</P>
<P><HI>Swainmote</HI> is another Court, as incident to a forest as a Pie-powder Court to a Fair. By <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Charter of the Forest it is held thrice a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear before the Verderors, as Judges.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and first of the Convocation.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO consult of Church-Matters, and make Ecclesiastical Laws, now and then the <HI>Convocation</HI> meets, and that in time of Parliament. Which <HI>Convocation</HI> is a Nati∣onal Synod, or general Assembly of the Clergy, convoked after this manner</P>
<P>Some time before the Parliament sits, the King, by the Advice of his Privy Council, sends his Writ to the Arch-bishop of each Province, for Summoning all Bishops, Deans, Arch-Deacons, &amp;c. assigning them the Time and Place in the said Writ. Upon which the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> directs his Letters
<PB N="97" REF="386"/>authentically sealed to the Bishop of London, as his Dean Provincial, wherein he cites him peremptorily, and willeth him to cite in like manner all the Bishops, Deans, Arch-Deacons, Gathedral and Collegiate Churches and all the Clergy of his Province, to the Place and Day prefixt in the Writ. But he directeth withal, that <HI>one Proctor</HI> be sent for every Ca∣thedral or Collegiate Church, and <HI>two</HI> for the Body of the Inferiour Clergy of each Diocese. All which the Bishop of London takes accord∣ingly care of, willing the Parties concerned person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to appear, and in the mean time to cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ify to the Arch-Bishop the Names of every one so warned in a Schedule annexed to the Letter Certificatory. Upon which the other Bishops of the Province proceed, the Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, and the inferiour Clergy of each Diocese, make choice of their Proctors. Which done, and certified to the Bishop of London, he returneth all at the Day. And the same Method is used in the Pro∣vince of York.</P>
<P>The Chappel of Henry VII. annexed to Westminster Abbey is the usual Place where the <HI>Convocation</HI> of the Clergy in the Province of Canterbury meets; Whilst the Arch-Bishop of York holds at York a <HI>Convocation</HI> of all his Province in like manner. Thus, by constant Correspondence, these two Provinces (tho so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r distant from each other) do debate and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onclude of the same Matters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Convocation</HI> is, like the Parliament, di∣sided into two Houses, the higher and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer. And all Members have by Statute the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me Priviledges for themselves and menial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervants as the Members of Parliament have.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="387"/>
<P>The higher House in the Province of Can∣terbury (which is by much the larger of the two) consists of 22 Bishops, whereof the Arch-Bishop is President. Who sits in a Chair at the upper end of a great Table, and the Bishops on each side of the same Table, all in their Scarlet Robes and Hoods; the Arch-Bishops Hoods furred with Ermin, and the Bishops with Minever.</P>
<P>The lower House consists of all the Deans, Arch-deacons, one Proctor for every Chapter, and two Proctors for all the Clergy of the Diocese. Which make in all 166 Persons, viz. 22 Deans, 24 Prebendaries, 54 Arch∣deacons, and 44 Clerks representing the Dioce∣san Clergy.</P>
<P>The first Business of each House, upon their Meeting, is to chuse each a <HI>Prolocutor,</HI> or Speaker. The <HI>Prolocutor</HI> of the lower House being chosen, he is presented to the upper House by two of the Members; whereof one makes a Speech, and the elect Person another, both in Latine. To which the Arch Bishop answers in Latine, and in the Name of all the Lords approves of the Person.</P>
<P>The Matters debated by both Houses are only such as the King by Commission do'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expresly allow, viz. Church and Religion Mat∣ters; first proposed in the Upper, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> communicated to the Lower House. And the major Vote in each House prevails. Some∣times there have been Royal Aids granted to the King by the Clergy in Convocation.</P>
<P>Anciently this Assembly might without, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now with the Royal Assent, make Canon touching Religion; binding, not only them selves, but all the Laity, without Consent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ratification of the Lords and Commons i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="99" REF="387"/>Parliament. Neither did the Parliament meddle in the making of Canons, or in Doctrinal Mat∣ters, till the Civil Wars in the Reign of Charles I. Only, when thereto required, they by their Civil Sanctions did confirm the Re∣sults and Consultations of the Clergy; where∣by the People might be the more easily in∣duced to obey the Ordinances of their Spiritual Governours.</P>
<P>To conclude, the Laws and Constitutions whereby the Church of England is governed are first general Canons made by general Councils, with the Opinion of the orthodox Fathers, and the grave Decrees of several holy Bishops of Rome, which have been admit∣ted from time to time by the Kings of Eng∣land. Then our own Constitutions made an∣ciently in several Provincial Synods, both by the Popes Legates <HI>Otho</HI> and <HI>Othobon,</HI> and by several Arch-Bishops of Canterbury; all which are of force in England, so far as they are not repugnant to the Laws and Customs of England, or the Kings Prerogative. Next to those Constitutions, this Church is also go∣verned by Canons made in Convocations of lat∣ter times, as in the first Year of the Reign of King James I, and confirmed by his Au∣thority. Also, by some Statutes of Parliament <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouching Church-Affairs, and by divers Imme∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orial Customs.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Court of Arches, the Court of Audience, the Prerogative-Court, the Court of Delegates, the Court of Peculiars, &amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM the Church Legislative, I come to the Executive Power, for which there have been several Courts provided. Amongst which is the <HI>Court of Arches,</HI> the chief and most ancient Consistory that belong∣eth to the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, for the debating of Spiritual Causes. So called from the arched Church and Tower of <HI>S. Mary le Bow</HI> in Cheapside London, where this Court is wont to be held. The Judge whereof is called <HI>Dean of the Arches,</HI> or the <HI>Official</HI> of the Court of Arches, because with this Officialty is commonly joyned a peculiar Jurisdiction of 13 Parishes in London, termed a Deanry, be∣ing exempt from the Bishop of Londons Ju∣risdiction, and belonging to the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury. All Appeals in Church-Mat∣ters within the Province of Canterbury are di∣rected to this Court. In which the Judge sits alone without Assessors, hearing and de∣termining all Causes without any Jury.</P>
<PB N="101" REF="388"/>
<P>The <HI>Advocates</HI> allowed to plead in this Court are all to be Doctors of the Civil Law. Who, upon their Petition to the Arch-Bi∣shop of Canterbury, and his <HI>Fiat</HI> obtained, are admitted by the Judge of this Court, but must not practise the first Year.</P>
<P>Both the Judge and the Advocates always wear their Scarlet Robes, with Hoods lined with Taffety if they be of Oxford, or white Minever Furr if of Cambridge, and all round black Velvet Caps.</P>
<P>Besides the Advocates, here are also ten <HI>Proctors,</HI> to manage other Mens Causes. Who wear Hoods lined with Lambs-Skin, if not Graduates; but if Graduates, Hoods proper to the Degree.</P>
<P>According to the Statutes of this Court, all Arguments made by Advocates, and Petitions by the Proctors, are to be made in Latine. All Process of this Court runs in the Name of the Judge.</P>
<P>To this Court belong two principal Officers that attend it. Viz. an <HI>Actuary,</HI> who sets down the Judges Decrees, registers the Court Acts, and sends them in Books to the Registry.</P>
<P>Then a <HI>Register,</HI> whose Office is by himself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Deputy, to receive all Libels or Bills, Al∣legations, and Exhibits of Witnesses, to file all Sentences, and keep the Records of the Court.</P>
<P>Next to which is the <HI>Beadle,</HI> an inferiour Officer, who carries a Mace before the Judge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd calls the Persons that are cited to ap∣pear.</P>
<P>All Places and Offices belonging to this Court are in the Arch-Bishops Gift.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="389"/>
<P>The <HI>Audience Court</HI> is a Court of equal Au∣thority with the Arches, tho inferiour both in Antiquity and Dignity. The Original of this Court was thus. The Arch-Bishop of Can∣terbury heard many Causes extrajudicially at home in his own Pallace; but, before he would finally determine any thing, he did usually commit them to be discussed by certain Men learned in the Civil and Canon Laws, who thereupon were called his Auditors, till at last those Causes were committed to One, thence named <HI>Causarum Negotiorumque Audi∣entiae Cantuariensis Auditor seu Officialis.</HI> And with this Office was joyned heretofore the Arch-Bishops Chancery, which properly meddles not with any point of contentious Jurisdi∣ction, or deciding of Causes between Party and Party, but only of Office; as the Grant∣ing the Custody of the Spiritualities during the Vacation of Bishopricks, Institution to Benefices, Dispensing with Banes of Matri∣mony, &amp;c. But this is now distinguished from the <HI>Audience.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Prerogative Court</HI> is the Court wherein all Wills are proved, and all Administrations taken, that belong to the Arch Bishop by his Prerogative; that is, where the Deceased had Goods of any considerable value out of the Diocese wherein he died. And that Value is usually 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> except it be otherwise by Compo∣sition between the Arch-Bishop and the Bi∣shop, as in the Diocese of London, where it is 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> If any Contention arise between Two or more touching any such Will or Admini∣stration, the Cause is properly debated and decided in this Court. The Judge whereof is
<PB N="103" REF="389"/>termed <HI>Judex Curiae Praerogativae Cantuariensis,</HI> the Judge of the Prerogative Court of Can∣terbury.</P>
<P>Who is attended in the Court by a <HI>Register,</HI> or his Deputy, whose Office is to set down the Decrees and Acts of the Court, to Keep the Re∣cords, all Original Wills and Testaments of Parties deceased that have left <HI>Bona Not abilia,</HI> &amp;c. His Office is commonly called the <HI>Prerogative Office,</HI> now Kept in the Deans Court near St. Paul's Church-yard; where, for a moderate Fee, one may have a Copy of any such Testament. And Under the Register are Six <HI>Clerks,</HI> severally appointed for such and such Counties.</P>
<P>This Court, formerly held in the Consistory of St. Pauls, is now Kept in the Common-Hall at Drs. Commons, next Day after the Ar∣ches, in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>All Places belonging to this Court are in his Grace's Gift.</P>
<P>The Archbishop of York has also the like Court, which is termed his <HI>Exchequer,</HI> but far inferiour to this in Power and Profit. He has also an Audience Court.</P>
<P>For Civil Affairs that concern the Church, the highest Court is the <HI>Court of Delegates.</HI> A Court which consists of Commissioners delega∣ted or appointed by the King's Commission, to sit upon an Appeal to Him in the Court of Chancery, and is granted in three Cases. First, when a Sentence is given in any Ecclesiastical Cause by the Archbishop, or his Official. Se∣condly, when any Sentence is given in any Ecclesiastical Cause in Places exempt. Thirdly, when Sentence is given in the Admiralty in Suits Civil and Marine, by order of the Civil Law.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="390"/>
<P>The Judges are appointed by the Lord Chan∣cellour, under the Great Seal of England, <HI>pro illa vice;</HI> and upon every Cause or Business there is a new Commission, and new Judges, according to the nature of the Cause. As some∣times Bishops, Common-Law Judges, Noble∣men, Knights, and Civilians; sometimes Bi∣shops, and Civilians; at other times Common Law Judges, and Civilians; and sometimes Ci∣vilians only.</P>
<P>This Court is Kept in the same Place as the former, the next Day after the Prerogative-Court in the Afternoon. Here the Citations and Decrees run in the King's Name, and to this Court belongs a standing <HI>Register.</HI></P>
<P>From this Court lies no Appeal in common Course. But the King may (and sometimes does) grant a Commission of Review, under the Great Seal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Peculiars</HI> is about certain Pa∣rishes that have Jurisdiction within themselves for Probate of Wills, &amp;c. being exempt from the Ordinary, and the Bishops Courts. 'Tis an ancient Priviledge of the See of Canterbury, that wheresoever any Mannors or Advowsons do belong to it, they forthwith become exempt from the Ordinary, and are reputed <HI>Peculiars.</HI> And there are reckoned in his Province no less than 57 such Peculiars. So the King's Chappel is a <HI>Royal Peculiar,</HI> exempt from all Spiritual Jurisdiction, and reserved to the Visi∣tation and immediate Government of the King himself, who is supreme Ordinary.</P>
<P>Besides these Courts serving for the whole Province, every Bishop has his Court held in the Cathedral of his Diocese. Over which
<PB N="105" REF="390"/>he hath a <HI>Chancellour,</HI> anciently termed the Church-Lawyer, who being skilled in the Ci∣vil and Canon Law, sits there as Judge. But, if his Diocese be large, he has in some more remote Place a <HI>Commissary,</HI> whose Authority is only in some certain Places of the Diocese, and certain Causes limited to him by the Bishop in his Commission. These are called <HI>Con∣sistory Courts.</HI></P>
<P>Every Arch-Deacon besides has his <HI>Court</HI> and Jurisdiction, where smaller Differences a∣rising within his Limits are pleaded. The Dean and Chapter of every Cathedral or Collegiate Church have also a <HI>Court,</HI> wherein they take Cognizance of Causes happening in Places be∣longing to the Cathedral.</P>
<P>The proper Matters belonging to Ecclesiasti∣cal Courts are Ordinations, Institution of Clerks to Benefices, Celebration of Divine Service, Tythes, Oblations, Obventions, Mortuaries, Dilapidations, Reparation of Churches. Rights of Matrimony, Divorces, general Bastardy, Probate of Wills, Administrations, Pensions, Procurations, Commutation of Penance, &amp;c. the Cognizance whereof does not belong to the Common Law. Also Apostacy from Christia∣nity, Simony, Heresy, Schisms, Blasphemy, Fornication, Incests, Adulteries.</P>
<P>The Manner of Trials here is different from those at Common Law, as thus. First goes forth a <HI>Citation,</HI> then a <HI>Bill and Answer,</HI> after that they proceed to <HI>Proofs, Witnesses,</HI> and <HI>Pre∣sumption,</HI> the Matter being argued <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> and the <HI>Canon</HI> and <HI>Civil Laws</HI> quoted. Upon which the definitive <HI>Sentence</HI> of the Judge
<PB N="106" REF="391"/>passeth without any Jury, and then <HI>Execution.</HI> follows.</P>
<P>And for Criminal Causes, they are here tried by <HI>Accusation,</HI> as when one takes upon him to prove the Crime. Or by <HI>Denunciation,</HI> when the Church-Wardens present, and are not bound to prove, because it is presumed they do it without malice, and that the Crime is noto∣rious.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Courts of London; and first of the Mayor's Court, the Court of Aldermen, the Common Council Court, the Hustings, the Court of Goal-Delivery, the Two Sheriffs, and the Chamberlain's Courts.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE City of London is, amongst other Things, so remarkable for her trans∣cendent Priviledges in Keeping her own Courts of Justice, that it will not be im∣proper to describe 'em here.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>Lord Mayor's Court,</HI> which is a Court of Record, held in the Chamber of Guildhall. The Recorder of the City is Judge of this Court; but the Lord Mayor and Alder∣men may sit as Judges with him, if they please. In this Court all manner of Actions may be entred and tried by a Jury, as in other Courts,
<PB N="107" REF="391"/>for any Debt, Trespass, or other Matter what∣soever, arising within the Liberties of London, and to any value. There are only four Attor∣neys belonging to it; and six Serjeants at Mace, one of them constantly attending at the Lord Mayor's House, and the rest at the Attorneys Offices.</P>
<P>The Charge of entring an Action in this Court is but 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> besides the King's Duty. It may be brought to a Trial for 30 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> Charge, and in 14 Days time; the Day for Trials being every Tuesday. An Action entred in this Court will remain in force for ever; although no Proceedings; be had thereupon. Whereas an Action entred at either of the Compters dies, and may be crossed after 16 Weeks.</P>
<P>The Advantages of making Attachments in this Court are considerable, as you may see in the Book called <HI>Lex Londinensis,</HI> or the City Law.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Aldermen</HI> is a Court of Record, held in the Inner Chamber of Guildhall every Tuesday and Thursday, except Holy-days, and in the Time of Sessions of Goal-Delivery. This Court does constantly appoint the Assize of Bread, determines all Matters touching Lights, Water-courses, and Party-Walls, and here must be sealed all Bonds and Leases that pass under the City-Seal.</P>
<P>Several Places are in the Gift of the Lord Mayor and this Court. Viz. The Recorder, Sword-bearer, Four City Counsel, a City Re∣membrancer, the Common Hunt. Water-Bay∣liff, Cities Sollicitor, Comptroller of the Cham∣ber, two Secondaries, Four Attorneys of the Lord Mayor's Court, Clerk of the Chamber, Hall-Keeper, Three Sergeant Carvers, Three
<PB N="108" REF="392"/>Sergeants of the Chamber, Sergeant of the Chan∣nel, Yeomen of the Chamber, Four Yeomen of the Water-side, Yeoman of the Channel, Under Water-Bayliff, Meal-Weighers, Clerk of the Cities Works, Six Young-men, Two Clerks of the Papers, Eight Attorneys in the Sheriffs Court, Eight Clerk-sitters, Two Protonotaries, Clerk of the Bridge-house, Clerk of the Court of Requests, Beadle of the Court of Requests, Thirty Six Sergeants at Mace, Thirty Six Yeo∣men, the Gager, Sealers and Searchers of Lea∣ther, Keeper of the Green-Yard, Two Keepers of the Compters, Keeper of Newgate, Keeper of Ludgate, Measurer, Steward of Southwark, Bayliff of Southwark, and Bayliff of the Hun∣dred of Ossulston.</P>
<P>There are other Places in the gift of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs; as the City-Carpenter, and other Artificers. But the Rent-Gatherer has been put in by Mr. Chamberlain.</P>
<P>If any Officer (says <HI>Lex Londinensis</HI>) shall misbehave himself in his Office, upon Com∣plaint made thereof to this Court, and Proof of the Fact, such Offender may be, and is usu∣ally suspended from the Profits of his Place, during the pleasure of this Court.</P>
<P>The Rulers of the Company of Watermen are annually elected and appointed by this Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Common Council</HI> consists of two Orders, as the Parliament of England; viz. the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, which represent the House of Lords, and the Common Council Men which represent the House of Commons, whose Number amounts to 231, belonging to their respective Wards, whereof some have more, some less. This Court is held in the
<PB N="109" REF="392"/>Chamber of Guildhall, at such Times as the Lord Mayor appoints and directs, being in his Lordships power to call and dismiss this Court at his pleasure.</P>
<P>Several Committees are annually appointed and elected by this Court for the better and more speedy Dispatch of the City-Affairs, who make Report to this Court of their Proceedings, as Occasion requires. Viz. a Committee of 6 Al∣dermen and 12 Commoners, for letting and de∣mising the Cities Lands and Tenements; who usually meet every Wednesday in the After∣noon at Guildhall for that purpose. A Com∣mittee of 4 Aldermen, and 8 Commoners, to let and dispose of the Lands and Tenements given by Sir Tho. Gresham, who usually meet at Mercer's Hall, at such Times as the Lord Mayor for the time being directs and appoints; and the Lord Mayor himself is commonly cho∣sen one of this Committee.</P>
<P>This Court does also annually elect Com∣missioners for the Sewers, and Pavements. And by this Court are annually elected a Governour, Deputy-Governour, and Assistants, for the Ma∣nagement of the Cities Lands in Ulster in Ire∣land.</P>
<P>A Stranger born may be made free of this City by Order of this Court, and not other∣wise. The Places of Common Serjeant, Town-Clerk, and Common Crier, are in the Gift of this Court. The Judges of the Sheriffs Court have sometimes been elected by this Court, and sometimes by the Court of Alder∣men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hustings</HI> is a very ancient Court of Re∣cord, always held in Guildhall, and commonly every Tuesday, before the Lord Mayor and
<PB N="110" REF="393"/>Sheriffs of London for the time being. When any Matter is to be argued or tried in this Court, Mr. Recorder sits as Judge with the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and gives Rules and Judgement therein. And, though the Original Writ be directed to the Mayor and Sheriffs joyntly, yet these by Commandment of the Lord Mayor, are Ministers to execute all Pro∣cess out of this Court.</P>
<P>In this Court Deeds may be Inrolled, Reco∣veries passed, Wills proved; and Replevins, Writs of Error, Right, Patent, Waste, Parti∣tion, and Dower may be determined for any Matters within the City of London, and the Liberties thereof.</P>
<P>The Attorneys of the Lord Mayor's Court are Attorneys also in this Court; and the se∣cond Attorney is always Clerk of the Inroll∣ments, and Inrolls all Deeds brought for that purpose. Now a Deed Inrolled in the <HI>Hustings</HI> is counted as good as a Fine at Common Law; for that it bars the Wife from claiming her Dower.</P>
<P>In this Court also the Burgesses to serve for the City in Parliament are elected by the Live∣ry-men of the respective Companies, which is done after this manner, in the presence of the Court. First, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen are put up (according to ancient Custom) for Candidates, and after them are usually nomina∣ted four Commoners. And out of them all, the four that have the plurality of Voices are declared by the Sheriffs to be duly chosen. But, if there be any Contest about the Election, it is usually decided by a Poll.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Goal Delivery</HI> is usually held 8 times a Year at the Old-Baily, both for the Ci∣ty
<PB N="111" REF="393"/>of London and County of Middlesex, for the Trial of Criminals. The Lord Mayor is the chief Judge of this Court, assisted by some of the Judges, besides the Recorder, and the two Sheriffs. He has the Power of Reprieving condemned Persons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Two Sheriffs Courts</HI> are held in Guild∣hall, the one by one Sheriff, every Wednesday and Friday, for Actions entred at the Wood∣street Compter, the other by the other Sheriff, every Thursday and Saturday, for Actions entred at the Poultry Compter.</P>
<P>To these Courts belong 8 Attorneys, whose Business here is not to keep any Record, but only to assist their Clients, and take their Fees due to them in every Cause. Two Secondaries, who allow and return all Writs brought to re∣move Causes out of these Courts. Two Clerks of the Papers, whose business is to draw the Subpoenas for Witnesses to appear, and to file and copy all Declarations upon Actions in these Courts. Two Protonotaries, who draw and ingross all such Declarations. Eight Clerk-sit∣ters, who enter Actions and Attachments, and take Bails and Verdicts.</P>
<P>In these Courts may be tried Actions of Debt, Case, Trespass, Accompt and Covenants broken, Attachments, and Sequestrations. And, if ei∣ther Party shall have a Witness that cannot stay in London till the Day of Trial, his Testimony may be taken in writing, which will be allow∣ed as good Evidence.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Chamberlain's Court,</HI> or <HI>Office,</HI> 'tis Kept in the Chamber of Guildhall. As he is intrusted with the Cities Cash, and the Orphans Mony, so when he takes this Office upon him,
<PB N="112" REF="394"/>he must give good Security to the Court of Aldermen; and he is accountable to Auditors appointed and chosen for that purpose. To him belongs the Business of Apprentices, over whom he has a great Authority. There∣fore he attends at Guildhall usually every Forenoon, to Inroll and turn over Ap∣prentices, and to make such Free as have duly served the full Term of 7 Years, and have not married nor taken Wages in that Time.</P>
<P>When any Difference happens betwixt a Ma∣ster and his Apprentice, the most prudential Way is to refer the matter before the Cham∣berlain, who will freely hear both Parties, and decide the Controversy for 3 Shill. Charge, viz. 1 Shill. to the Officer for the Summons, and 2 Shill. to the Clerk for the Order. Whereas, if they proceed at Law for Relief, it may cost both Parties five or six pounds in Charges; and the Conclusion may be less satisfactory, than if decided by such Reference as afore∣said.</P>
<P>If an Apprentice shall be unruly or disorder∣ly in his Master's House, or commit any noto∣rious Fault, Mr. Chamberlain (upon Complaint made thereof) will send one of his Officers for such Apprentice, and send him to Bridewell, or punish him otherwise, according to the nature of the Offence.</P>
<P>And, if any Master shall misuse his Ap∣prentice, by beating him unreasonably, or with unlawful Weapons, or by neglecting to instruct him, or to find him Necessaries, Mr. Chamberlain (upon Complaint thereof made) will send a Summons for the Master to appear before him; and upon hearing both Parties, will relieve the Apprentice, or leave him to
<PB N="113" REF="394"/>take his Remedy against his Master in the Lord Mayor's Court. And, if the Master shall refuse to appear before the Chamberlain being duly Summoned, My Lord Mayor, or Mr. Re∣corder (upon Complaint made thereof) will grant a Warrant to apprehend such Freeman, and compel him to appear.</P>
<P>When an Apprentice is, by Consent of his Master, to be turned over to another Master of the same Trade, it must be done first before the Company where he was bound, and then before the Chamberlain. For hereby the first Master is discharged from him, and the second obliged to keep him, as the Apprentice on his side is obliged to serve him the full Term of the Indentures. Other∣wise there is no Obligation upon the second Master to Keep such Apprentice, nor upon this to serve him, so that the Apprentice may sue out his Indenture against his first Master.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Orphans Court, the Court of Conscience</HI> or <HI>Requests, the Court for the Conservation of the River, and the Pie-powder Court.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Orphans Court</HI> is held before the Mayor and Aldermen, who are Guar∣dians to the Children of all Freemen of London, that are or shall be under the Age of 21 Years at the time of their Father's De∣cease. This Court meets at Guildhall but once a Year, viz. on the Munday morning after Mid∣lent Sunday, which is termed Call-Day. For then they meet purposely to hear the Name called over of all the Securities that stand bound for Orphans Portions; and upon that Day on of every of the Sureties ought to appear to give an Account, whether the other Securi∣ties are living, and in good Condition, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whether the Orphans are living and mar∣ried.</P>
<P>If none of the Securities appear upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Day, they forfeit their Bonds and Recogn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣zances. Then the Clerk of this Court (wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is always the youngest Attorney in the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mayor's Court) makes out Process against the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="115" REF="395"/>forces 'em to an Account, and they must pay the Charges of the Process.</P>
<P>But, that you may Know more fully how this great Concern of the Orphans is managed for their benefit, and what Care is taken of their Welfare, I shall make bold to inlarge a little upon this Subject, out of <HI>Lex Londinen∣sis.</HI></P>
<P>When a Freeman of London dies, leaving Children under Age, the Clerks of the respec∣tive Parishes within the Bill of Mortality ought to give the Name of such Freeman to the com∣mon Crier of the City. Who is thereupon to summon the Widow or Executor of such Free∣man to appear before the Court of Aldermen, there to be bound to bring in an Inventory of the Testator's Estate, within the space of two Months. And, that the Inventory may be given in due time, the Court of Aldermen have made an Order, not to allow any finding Mony (or Interest) for any Mony that shall be paid into the Chamber of London by any Executor or Ad∣ministrator belonging to any Freemans Estate, until such time as the Executor or Admini∣strator do bring in and exhibit upon Oath a true and perfect Inventory to the best of his Knowledge.</P>
<P>If the Party summoned do not appear, the Lord Mayor sends his Warrant, and forces an Appearance. And, if any Executor re∣suse to become bound to bring in an In∣ventory, the Court of Aldermen have power to send him to Newgate, there to remain till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he submit; and the Courts at Westminster will not release such Person.</P>
<P>After the Bond given, the Executor must procure 4 Freemen to appraise the Testator's Goods. In order to which he must cause them
<PB N="116" REF="396"/>to appear before a Justice of Peace in Lon∣don, and take their Oaths, that they shall make a just and true Valuation and Appraise∣ment of the Goods and Chattels of the Decea∣sed, according to the best of their Judgements and Skills.</P>
<P>When the Appraisement is to be made, the Common Crier is to have notice of it before∣hand, being appointed by the Court of Alder∣men to see the same be fairly done, and to the best advantage of the Orphan. And, un∣less the Common Crier, or his Deputy be present, and the Inventory signed by the Com∣mon Crier, the Court of Aldermen will not al∣low thereof.</P>
<P>The Appraisement being made as aforesaid, and signed by the Common Crier and the Ap∣praisers, it must be given to the Common Ser∣geant of the City, or one of his Clerks, at his Office in Guildhall-Yard; he being the only Person intrusted by the Court of Aldermen, to take all Inventories and Accounts of Freement Estates. If he approves thereof, he will cause it to be Ingrossed, and a Duplicate of it to be made for the Executor or Administrator. And, when the same is examined by him, and his hand set thereto in testimony thereof, the Exe∣cutor or Administrator must in the Court of Aldermen swear the same Inventory to be a true Inventory of the Goods and Chattels of the Party deceased, according to the best of his Knowledge.</P>
<P>When the Inventory is so exhibited, the Executor must become bound in a considerable Penalty, either to bring in the Mony that shall appear due to the Orphans by the Inventory, or within two Months to give good Security to pay the same into the Chamber of London for
<PB N="117" REF="396"/>the Use of the Orphans, when they shall come to Age, or be married.</P>
<P>If the Executor pay the Mony into the Chamber of London, the Court of Aldermen usually allow five <HI>per Cent</HI> Interest for so much Mony of the Testator's Estate as is due to the Orphans by the Custom of London, so as the same exceed not 500 <ABBR><HI>l;</HI></ABBR> and for Legacy-mony, 3 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 6 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8. <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> per Cent.</P>
<P>But, if the Executor shall not think fit to pay the Mony into the Chamber, he must become bound with 3 Sureties to the Chamberlain of London for the time being in one or more Re∣cognizances, or else by Bond to pay the Mony due to Orphans. And, in case the Security live within the Liberties of London, they must be bound by Bond.</P>
<P>Now, as to Recognizances, the Custom is ne∣ver to make any touching Orphans of greater Penalty than 400 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and not for the Payment of above 300. Therefore, if the Sum (for Example) be 900 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> the Security must become bound by 3 Recognizances, each for the Pay∣ment of 300 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>If a Freeman leaves Lands and Tenements to his Children, the Executor must become bound with Sureties to account for the Rents and Profits thereof.</P>
<P>The Securities must take particular care that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one of the Orphans marry, or be put Appren∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice with their Consents, without the Leave of the Court of Aldermen first obtained for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urpose. And as the Orphan comes to be of the Age of 21 Years, or to be married with the Consent of the Court of Aldermen, the Se∣curities must take care to bring him to Guildhall, with a person to prove his Age. Then the Or∣phan must acknowledge satisfaction for the Mo∣ny
<PB N="118" REF="397"/>due to him, or her, of the Testator's E∣state, which must be done in the Court of Al∣dermen. And, upon Motion made by Mr. Common Sergeant, the Court does order, that all Bonds entered into for the Payment of such Orphan's Portion, shall be delivered up, and cancelled. And, if the Security became bound by Recognizances, the Clerk of the Or∣phans will cross and discharge such Recogni∣zances.</P>
<P>The Chamber of London is counted the sa∣fest and best Security in or about London <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Moneys paid therein to the Use of the City, or any Orphan, being constantly repaid upon Demand, without any trouble. And when Orphans come to Age, or be married with the Consent and Approbation of the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Aldermen, they may receive their Portion (if paid into the Chamber) at an hours notice though the Sum be 10000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> or more, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chamberlain and his Clerks attending daily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that purpose.</P>
<P>The finding (or Interest) Mony is constant∣ly paid as it becomes due; and the Court ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> always taken great Care, that every Orpha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall receive his (or her) Portion out of the Chamber of London, without paying any o∣ther or greater Fees than has been paid tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of mind.</P>
<P>The Custody of Orphans is committed by the Court of Aldermen to such Person or Per∣sons as they think fit. And, if any Person whatsoever do intermarry with any Orpha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without Leave of the said Court, such Perso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be fined by that Court, according to the quality and portion of the Orphan. And, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> less such Person do pay the Fine, or give Bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to pay the same in some reasonable Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="119" REF="397"/>though he shall have ten times a better Estate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Orphan he intermarries, yet the Court may commit him to Newgate, there to remain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>til the Fine be paid. But, if he settle an Estate upon the Orphan as the Court shall di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct, and make application to the Court <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Petition to have the Fine remitted, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill in probability shew favour to such Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, as they have done in the like Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London in Common Council, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave made several good Acts and Orders to pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent Freemens Children from Marrying with∣out the Consent of their Parents and Guardians, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to keep them from vicious Courses. More <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>articularly an Act of Common Council, called <HI>Judds Law,</HI> made in the Mayoralty of Sir <HI>An∣drew Judd,</HI> Knight, in the Fifth year of King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dward VI. Which Law, though unrepealed, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen have some∣times for special Reasons thought fit to dis∣pense with, in favour of Orphans that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought Relief against the Penalties therein men∣tioned.</P>
<P>By the Custom of London, a Freemans Wi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow may require a third part of his Personal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>state after his Debts paid, and Funeral Char∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es discharged, besides her Widows Chamber <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mished; and his Children may require ano∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er third part thereof. The other third part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his Estate he may by his last Will give away, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther to his Wife, or any of his Children, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny other Person whatsoever. But, if he die <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thout Issue, his Widow may require a Moity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his personal Estate, after Debts paid, together <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith her Widows Chamber furnished. And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Freeman make his Will contrary to this
<PB N="120" REF="398"/>Custom, and give away more than a third of his Estate from his Wife and Children, they may be relieved against such Will, by exhibi∣ting their Bill in this Court against the Execu∣tor, and so much of his Will as shall be contra∣ry to the Custom, will be declared void and of none effect.</P>
<P>But, if a Freeman die without a Will, and leave a Wife and Children, this Court grants Administration of his Estate to his Widow By the Custom of London she will claim a third part of his Estate, one third must be divided amongst his Children, and the other third be∣tween the Wife and Children; but so that usual∣ly the Widow is allowed two Thirds of the Free∣mans third part, and the Children one Third thereof.</P>
<P>If a Freeman shall in the time of his last Sickness give and deliver any part of his Goods, Chattels, or Moneys to his Wife or Child, or any other Person, with Intent that such Person shall keep the same to his or her own Use; such Gift, being against the Custom of Lon∣don, shall be accounted part of the Freemans Estate at the time of his Death, and may be recovered by Bill in this Court. For a Freman cannot in the time of his Sickness whereof he shall die, give away any part of his Estate, otherwise than by his last Will.</P>
<P>If a Freeman, having given in his Life-time part of his Estate to any of his Children, in Marriage or otherwise, do afterwards make his Will, and give all his Estate away to his other Children, with a Declaration that the Child he so disposed in Marriage, had received 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> or more of his Estate, and was thereby fully advanced; such Declaration shall not bar the
<PB N="121" REF="398"/>Person so married, but he or she may recover after the Father's Decease an equal share with the other Children. But then the Mony re∣ceived of his Father in his Life-time, must come into the Account, and be reckoned part of the Estate left by him at his Death. Which is called bringing of the Mony into <HI>Hotchpot.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, if a Freeman shall settle or make over any part of his Estate to the Use of his Children, with design to defraud his Wife of her full third Part, the Widow may, after his Death, set aside such Settlement by a Bill in this Court.</P>
<P>Lastly, when an Inventory is exhibited in this Court, and the Orphans can prove any Goods omitted or undervalued, or any Debts charged to be owing from the Deceased, which were not real and just Debts; In such Case, up∣on Complaint made, the Clerk will summon a Jury, to inquire whether the Inventory so ex∣hibited be a true and perfect Inventory or not. And, if the Jury find any Omissions, Under∣valuations, or Surcharges, then the Clerk will sue the Executor upon the Bond he gave for exhibiting an Inventory, and will thereby com∣pel him to make so much as shall be found by the Jury to be omitted, undervalued, or surchar∣ged. Unless he can by Proof discharge him∣self thereof before the Court of Aldermen; who, upon Application made by any Executor, will examine into his Accounts, and do right to all Parties, without any Expence to the Exe∣cutor or the Orphans.</P>
<P>And, when it shall appear by an Inventory, that many Debts are standing out due to the Deceased, the Court of Aldermen do constant∣ly compel the Executor to give Bond, to ren∣der
<PB N="122" REF="399"/>a true Account from time to time, when he shall be thereunto required; which is usu∣ally once in a Twelve-month. And, if upon the Exhibiting thereof, it shall appear that any Mony is due to the Orphans, the Exe∣cutor must either pay it into the Chamber of London, or give good Security to pay the same. Which if he omit, or refuse, his Bond will be put in Suit against him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court of Conscience,</HI> otherwise called the <HI>Court of Requests,</HI> is a Court established and settled by an Act of Parliament in the 3d Year of the Reign of King James I. Which Im∣powers this Court to hear, examine, and de∣termine with Equity or good Conscience, all Matters brought before them, between Party and Party, Citizens of London, where the Debt do's not amount to forty shillings. An Act very beneficial, both for the Relief of such poor Debtors as cannot make present Pay∣ment of their Debts, and for such poor Per∣sons as have small Debts owing to them, and are not able to prosecute a Suit in Law for the same.</P>
<P>This Court sits in Guildhall every Wednes∣day and Saturday in the Forenoon, consisting of two Aldermen and four Commoners, month∣ly appointed by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen; but any three of them make a Court.</P>
<P>A Cause may be brought and determined in this Court for 10 pence Charge, viz. 6 pence for the Plaint and the Summons, and 4 pence for the Order. But, if the Defendant do not appear the second Court-Day after Summons, an Attachment will be awarded against him,
<PB N="123" REF="399"/>which will compel him to appear, and increase the Charge.</P>
<P>If any Citizen be Arrested for a Debt under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Shill. this Court will grant a Summons for the Plaintiff in the Action. And, if he ap∣pear not the first Court-day after the Sum∣mons left at his House, the same will grant an Attachment against him, force him to take his Debt, and to pay the Defendant his Costs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Court for the Conservation of the Thames</HI> is held before the Lord Mayor at such Times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he appoints and directs within the respe∣ctive Counties near adjacent to the Cities of London and Westminster.</P>
<P>The Water-Bayliff for the time being is My Lord Mayors Deputy, and ought to give notice to his Lordship of all Offences commit∣ted by any Persons, contrary to the Orders made for Preservation of the Brood and Fry of Fish in the said River. To which pur∣pose he is by this Court Ordered and Im∣powred, from time to time to Authorize Two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onest Fishermen or more, in such Town and Places as he shall think convenient, aswell be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow as above the Bridge, to be assistant to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Execution of his Duty, and (when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall think fit) to go out and search for any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch Offenders, take away their Nets, and give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Names to Mr. Water-Bayliff, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> severely proceeded against according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw.</P>
<P>This Power of the Lord Mayor for the Con∣servation of the River of Thames, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unishment of all Offences within it, has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ercised by the Mayor of London and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>redecessors time out of mind. By King Ed∣ward the Thirds Charter to this City, the Ci∣tizens
<PB N="124" REF="400"/>are Authorized to remove and take away all Kidels in the Water of the River of Thames and Medway, and have the Punishment to the King belonging thereof coming. And, by a Statute made in the 17th Year of the Reign of Richard II. it is Ordained, that the Mayor of London shall have the Conservacy of the Thames, and put in execution the Statutes of 13 Edward I. &amp; 13 Richard II. from the Bridge of Stanes to London, and from thence over the same Water, and in the Water of Med∣way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pie-Powder Court</HI> is a Court held du∣ring the first 3 Days of Bartholomews Fair, by Stewards assigned by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, to examine and try all Suits brought for petty Matters and Offences there committed, contrary to the Proclama∣tion made on Bartholomew Eve in the Afternoon at the great Gate going into the Cloth-Fair, for the better regulating this Fair.</P>
<P>Besides the foresaid Courts, every Alder∣man keeps a Court in his Ward, called <HI>Ward∣mote,</HI> for Things relating to his Ward; but still under the Direction of the Lord Mayor.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Punishments inflicted on Malefactors.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the 9th Chapter of this Part I have shewn at large the Manner of Trying Criminals in England; wherein is to be commended our English Humanity towards Prisoners that are upon their Trial. When other Nations, under pretence that no Man ought to be put to Death but upon his own Confession of the Crime he stands charged with, have devised such <HI>racking Tortures</HI> to extort the Confession, as make often the Innocent cry Guilty, and prefer Death to the Rack. But this I have al∣ready toucht upon in my first Part.</P>
<P>My Business is now to speak of the Punish∣ments inflicted here upon Criminals of what nature soever.</P>
<P><HI>Hanging</HI> is the usual Punishment to Death in England, either for High Treason, Petty Trea∣son, or Felony. But the Manner is different.</P>
<P>For a Traytor to the King and Govern∣ment is to be drawn upon a Hurdle or Sledge to the Gallows, and there to be hanged by the Neck. But then he is presently cut down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>live, his Entrals pulled out of his Belly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnt before his Face, his Head cut off, and his Body divided into four Parts, and both the Head and Body hung up or impaled where the King shall command.</P>
<PB N="126" REF="401"/>
<P>This Punishment indeed, considering all its Circumstances, seems cruel to such as do not narrowly consider the nature of the Crime. Whereas the Law thinks it but reasonable, that whosoever indeavours to cut off the King, or rend the Government, should be himself cut off and rent, as before said.</P>
<P>As for his Lands and Goods, they are for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eited to the King; his Wife, if married, loses her Dower; and, if he be Noble, his Children lose their Right of Nobility, aswell as Inheritance. For, by the Law, Treason taints the Bloud.</P>
<P>But it is observable, as to the Kings Person, that it is not only downright killing (or mur∣dering) the King which makes it High Treason. For the very imagining (or contriving) his Death, without any overt Act, is High Trea∣son.</P>
<P>Falsifying and Clipping of Mony is also <HI>High Treason,</HI> by Law. But the Offender's Punish∣ment is only to be Drawn, and Hanged by the Neck, till he be dead.</P>
<P>The same it is with one guilty of <HI>Petty Treason,</HI> as when a Servant kills his Master or Mistris, a Wife her Husband, or a Clergy-man his Prelate, to whom he ow's Obedience.</P>
<P>For <HI>Felony,</HI> as Murder, Theft or Robbery, and other Capital Crimes, for which anciently there were several sorts of Punishments, the Malefactor is but Hanged, since the Reign of Henry I.</P>
<P>But, when the Robbery is attended with Murder, the Criminal, after he is hanged and dead, is taken down to be hanged in Chains; and so to hang <HI>in terrorem</HI> till the Body be quite rotted off, or eaten up by the Birds of the Air.</P>
<PB N="127" REF="401"/>
<P>As to Persons of great Birth and Quality, convicted of High Treason, Petty Treason, or Felony, tho the Judgment be the same with that of common Persons, yet by the Kings Fa∣vour they are usually <HI>Beheaded.</HI> Which is performed with an Ax, upon a Block lying on the Scaffold; and not as in other Countries, by a Sword, kneeling or standing.</P>
<P>The Notion of Murder, as a Capital Crime, invites me to explain two Law-Terms relating to it, viz. <HI>Manslaughter</HI> and <HI>Chance-medley.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Manslaughter</HI> is the unlawful killing of one without prepensed Malice. As when two, that formerly meant no harm one to another, meet together; and falling out upon some sudden Occasion, the one kills the other. It differs from <HI>Murder,</HI> because it is not done with fore-going Malice; and from <HI>Chance∣medley,</HI> because it has a present Intent to kill. 'Tis Felony, but it is allowed the Benesit of the Clergy for the first time.</P>
<P><HI>Chance-medley,</HI> otherwise called Manslaughter by Misadventure, signifies the casual Killing of a Man, not altogether without the Killer's Fault, though without an evil Intent; for which the Offender shall have his Pardon of course. But here must be considered, whether the Offender, when he committed this Man∣slaughter by Chance-medley, was doing a law∣ful Thing. For, if the Act were unlawful, it is Felony. As if two are fighting together, and a third Man comes to part them, and is killed by one of the two, without any Malice fore-thought, or evil Intent in him that killed the Man, yet this is Murder in him, and not Manslaughter by Chance-medley or Misad∣venture, because they two that fought toge∣ther were doing an unlawful Act. And, if
<PB N="128" REF="402"/>they were met with prepensed Malice, the one intending to kill the other, then it is Murder in them both.</P>
<P><HI>Burning alive</HI> is sometimes used, but only for Witches, and Women convicted of High Trea∣son, or Petty Treason.</P>
<P>In the Time of Popery, especially in the Reign of Queen Mary, this was the proper Punishment for Hereticks, that is, in the Po∣pish Sense, for Protestants. When the Pa∣pists, who ever delighted in humane Sacrifices, made Bonefires of them, and reserved Hell-fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Pressing to Death,</HI> called by the Law <HI>Peine forte &amp; dure,</HI> is a Punishment for those only that being Arraigned either of Petty Treason or Felony, refuse to Answer, or to put them∣selves upon the ordinary Trial of God and the Country. Which by the Law is called <HI>to stand Mute.</HI> And for this Contumacy the Of∣fender is to be sent back to the Prison whence he came, there to be laid in some low dark Room, all naked but his privy Members, his Back upon the bare Ground, his Arms and Legs stretched with Cords fastened to the se∣veral Quarters of the Room. Then is laid up∣on his Body Iron and Stone as much as he may bear, or more. The next Day he shall have three morsels of Barley-bread without Drink; and the Day after he shall have for his Drink as much of the next Water to the Prison as he can drink three several times, except it be running Water, and that with∣out any bread. And this is to be his Diet, till he Die. Which grievous kind of Death some stout Men have chosen, to save their
<PB N="129" REF="402"/>Estates to their Children, and keep their Bloud from being stained. But, in case of High Treason, though the Criminal stand mute, yet Judgment shall be given against him as if he had been Convicted, and his Estate shall be Confiscated.</P>
<P>In many Parts beyond Sea the Criminals hanged or beheaded are denied <HI>Christian Burial,</HI> their Society being declined in the Grave who were not fit to live in the World. In England, where they are charitably lookt up∣on as reconciled to God upon their penitent Departure out of this World, their Friends are allowed to inter them decently where they think fit. He therefore that has Friends to look to his Burial go's to the Place of Execu∣tion, his Coffin in the Cart with him, a good <HI>Memento Mori.</HI> And, after he has hanged about a quarter of an hour, he is cut down, laid in his Coffin, and conveyed in a Coach to the Place from whence he is designed to be buried. But <HI>Apostates, Hereticks,</HI> and <HI>Extor∣sioners,</HI> all <HI>perjured</HI> Persons, and such as die <HI>Excommunicate,</HI> also any one that is <HI>Felo de se,</HI> or that has wittingly made himself away, all such are by Law denied <HI>Christian Burial.</HI> And so are for the most part Men that die for <HI>High Treason,</HI> and <HI>Robbers</HI> guilty of Murder.</P>
<P>For <HI>Petty Larceny,</HI> or small Theft, that is under the ancient value of 12 d. the Punish∣ment since Edward III. is by <HI>Whipping,</HI> and in the late Reigns has been often by Transporta∣tion into the West-Indies, where they live for some Years a slavish Life. But, if the Of∣sender be found by the Jury to have fled for the same, he forfeits all his Goods.</P>
<PB N="130" REF="403"/>
<P>For <HI>Misprision of High-Treason,</HI> that is, for neglecting or concealing it, the Offender's Pu∣nishment is Forfeiture of the Profits of his Lands during Life, and of all his Goods, be∣sides Imprisonment for Life.</P>
<P><HI>Perjury,</HI> whereby Mens Estates, Reputation, and Lives ly at stake, is commonly punished only with the <HI>Pillory;</HI> never with Death, though it has cost the Lives of many. 'Tis true a Per∣jurer Convict is by Law incapable of being a Witness, or Administrator, or of bearing any publick Office. And, in the strictness of the Law, he ought to be burnt in the forehead with a P, his Goods to be Confiscated, and his Trees growing upon his Ground rooted up.</P>
<P>But all this is counted too little by those Nations where wilful Perjury is punished with Death. At least it seems but equi∣table, which is the Practice of Spain, that the Perjurer should suffer the same Punish∣ment which he intended for another by his Perjury.</P>
<P><HI>Forgery, Blasphemy, Cheating, Libelling, False Weights and Measures, Forestalling the Market, Offences in Baking and Brewing,</HI> are also punish∣ed with standing in the <HI>Pillory.</HI> But sometimes the Offender is Sentenced besides to have one or both Ears nailed to the Pillory and cut off, or his Tongue there bored through with a hot Iron.</P>
<P>For <HI>Striking in the Kings Court, so as to draw Bloud,</HI> the Criminal is to have his right Hand cut off in a most solemn manner. And for <HI>Striking in Westminster-Hall,</HI> whilst the Courts of Justice are there sitting, the Offender is im∣prisoned during Life, and all his Estate for∣feited.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="403"/>
<P>For one found in a <HI>Praemunire,</HI> that is, one who incurs the same Punishment which was inflicted on those who transgressed the Statute of Rich. II. commonly called the <HI>Statute of Prae∣munire</HI> (which Statute was properly made a∣gainst such as avouched the Popes pretended Right of bestowing by Provision most of the best Livings in England, by Mandates,) the Punishment is Forfeiture of all his Estate, to be put out of the King's Protection, and Impri∣soned during the King's Pleasure.</P>
<P><HI>Vagabonds,</HI> and the like, who can give no good account of themselves, are punished by setting their Legs in the <HI>Stocks</HI> for certain hours. And <HI>Scolding Women</HI> (that are always teazing their Neighbours) by being set in a <HI>Cucking Stool</HI> placed over some deep Water and duck'd therein three several times, to cool their heat and choler.</P>
<P>Other <HI>Misdemeanours</HI> are commonly punished with <HI>Imprisonment</HI> or <HI>Fines,</HI> and sometimes with both.</P>
<P>Those are the <HI>Corporal Punishments</HI> common∣ly used in England for Criminals that happen to fail into the hands of Justice. But there are also Spiritual Punishments, such as concern the Soul especially, and are in the power of the Spiritual Courts. 'Tis true they are but seldom put into practice, but let us see however what the Law is in this point.</P>
<P>First, for refusing to appear in the Ecclesiasti∣cal Court upon Summons, or for not obeying the Orders of the Court, the Party Delinquent is admonished. If he slight the Admonition, then comes upon him <HI>Minor Excommunicatio,</HI> the Lesser Excommunication, whereby he is Excommunicated, or excluded from the Church;
<PB N="132" REF="404"/>if not from the Church, at least from the Com∣munion of the Lords Supper. And by this lesser Excommunication, he is disinabled to be Plaintiff in a Law-suit, &amp;c. Which Power of Excommunication the Bishop may dele∣gate to any grave Priest with the Chancel∣lour.</P>
<P>But for Heresy, Incest, Adultery, Perjury, and other grievous Crimes, <HI>Excommunicatio ma∣jor,</HI> or the greater Excommunication, is used, and pronounced by the Bishop himself in person. Now this is not only an Exclusion from the Com∣pany of Christians in Spiritual Duties, but also in Temporal Concerns. For a Person so ex∣communicated cannot in any Civil or Eccle∣siastical Court be Plantiff, or Witness. And, if he continue 40 Days Excommunicated, with∣out acknowledging and giving satisfaction for his Offence, the Chancery grants the King's Writ against him, <HI>De Excommunicato capiendo,</HI> to take him up and cast him into Prison, with∣out Bail; where he is to ly, till he has fully satisfied for his Offence.</P>
<P>Then comes the <HI>Anathema,</HI> but this is only inflicted upon an obstinate Heretick. Where∣by he is declared a publick Enemy of God, cursed, and delivered over to eternal Damna∣tion. And this is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one by the Bishop him∣self in Person, assisted by the Dean and Chap∣ter, or twelve other grave Priests.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Delinquent is compelled to make a publick Confession of his Fault, and to bewail it in the Church before the whole Con∣gregation. Now this is called a <HI>publick Penance,</HI> and the Manner of it is thus. The Delinquent is to stand in the Church-porch upon a Sunday, bare-headed and bare-footed, in a white Sheet, and with a white Rod in his hand. Having
<PB N="133" REF="404"/>there bewailed himself, and begged every one that passes by to pray for him, he enters the Church, falling down, and Kissing the Ground. Then he is placed in the middle of the Church in a conspicuous Place over against the Mini∣ster. Who makes a Discourse upon the foul∣ness of his Crime, and having received his humble Acknowledgement of the same, and his solemn Promise with God's help and as∣sistance to watch more carefully for the time to come against the Temptations of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, pronounces in Christ's Name the Absolution. The Penitent on his side humbly beseeches the Congregation to par∣don him, and receive him into their holy Com∣munion, and in testimony thereof to vouch∣safe out of their Christian Charity, to say with him aloud the Lord's Prayer. Which seems to be the Way used by the Primitive Churches.</P>
<P>But, when the Crime is not notorious and publick, the foresaid Pennance may, by the Ca∣nons of the Church, be commuted (at the Par∣ties Request) into a <HI>Pecuniary Mulct,</HI> for the Poor of the Parish, or some pious Uses; Pro∣vided that it may appear to be the more pro∣ble Way for the Delinquents Reformation. Such is the Temper of some Men that, far from being likely to be reclaimed by a publication of their Offence, they will rather grow obdu∣rate and impudent, when they perceive their Reputation to be lost.</P>
<P>To all the foresaid Punishments and Censures of the Church both the Laity and Clergy are subject. But there are other Punishments to which the faulty Clergy only are liable, which are four in Number; commonly called <HI>Sus∣pensio
<PB N="134" REF="405"/>ab Officio, Suspensio a Beneficio, Deprivatio a Beneficio,</HI> and <HI>Deprivatio ab Officio.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> is, when a Minister for a time is de∣clared unfit to execute his Office. The <HI>second,</HI> when he is for some time deprived of the Pro∣fits of his Benefice. Both which are wont to be for smaller Crimes.</P>
<P><HI>Deprivatio a Beneficio,</HI> is when a Minister, for a greater Crime, is wholly, and for ever deprived of his Living. And the <HI>last</HI> is, when he is wholly and for ever deprived of his Or∣ders; which is properly called in English a De∣posing, or Degradation.</P>
<P>This is commonly for some hainous, or Ca∣pital Crime. And then the Minister is solemn∣ly stript by the Bishop of his Priestly Vestments in the presence of the Civil Magistrate, to whom he is then delivered to be Punished as a Lay-man for the like Offence.</P>

<P>THis Court you have too short an Account of, in my Third Part, Page 91. I therefore beg leave here to inlarge upon it.</P>
<P>'Tis called the Martial (or Military) Court, or High Court of Chivalry, otherwise the Court of Honour, and in Latine, <HI>Curia Milita∣ris.</HI> The Place anciently appointed for holding thereof was the <HI>King's Hall,</HI> wherein the <HI>Con∣stable</HI> and <HI>Earl Marshal</HI> of England sat as Judges. Where any Plaintiff, in case of Digni∣ties, or Matters of Arms, or of any other Sute or Controversy concerning Nobility, Gentility, or Arms, might sue the Defendant. But now, that great Office of Constable of England is hid aside, the whole Power is vested in the Earl Marshal. And the Present Possessor of that honourable Office is his Grace <HI>Henry, Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of</HI> England. Who has appointed the Hall in the Colledge of Arms to be the Place for Keeping the said Court. And, upon Application made to him by any of the Nobility or Gentry of this Kingdom, being a∣bused in Matters of Honour and Arms, may there have relief from his Grace.</P>
