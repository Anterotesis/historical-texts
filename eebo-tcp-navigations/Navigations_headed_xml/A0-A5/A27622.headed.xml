<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE Sir Humfry Edwyn, LORD MAYOR Of the City of <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have observed, The supreme Providence, hath Placed you in the most Eminent <HI>Magistracys</HI> of this <HI>Great City,</HI> in Two Extraordinary Years, Engraven upon with Illustri∣ous Appearances of his own Hand; Your <HI>Sherivalry,</HI> as I have been assured in the Year 88, The Year of the so Great <HI>Revolution</HI> in these Nations; and your Lordships <HI>Mayoral∣ty</HI> Enters in this Year of the <HI>Peace,</HI> and the so <HI>Grand Vi∣ctory</HI> of the <HI>Imperial Army</HI> over the <HI>Mahometan, Turkish Sig∣niory;</HI> and both so close together, and at a Time, as I ap∣prehend, well known to <HI>Prophecy:</HI> I have therefore thought it my Duty, Humbly to present the following <HI>Review</HI> of both
<PB REF="3"/> to your Lordship, as in so High a Station, This so Great Year: And yet, If God hath Graciously led me into the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <HI>Interpretation</HI> of his <HI>Sure Word of Prophecy,</HI> This is but small in Comparison of your Authority, Extending it self into the much Greater Year 98; As I hope it will be found; In which your <HI>Sword</HI> shall be born before the <HI>Prince of Prin∣ces, the King of Kings and Lords of Lords, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth;</HI> I mean not in His <HI>Personal</HI> Appearance, as many either Ignorantly, or wilfully mistake; but in Re∣gard of the Glorious Manifestation of His Kingdom En∣tring its <HI>Succession;</HI> which will not Lessen but Aggrandize both <HI>Royal</HI> and <HI>Magistratical Honour,</HI> and Authority, <HI>that Kisses the Son,</HI> and does Homage to This Supreme; and will not in the least give Countenance to <HI>Anarchy,</HI> Confusion, or Resistance to that Ordinance of God by either <HI>Le ellism</HI> or <HI>Rebellion;</HI> but Conciliate the most Holy, Humble and Pious subjecti∣on to Authority so Enstamp'd from Heaven, as then it will be.</P>
<P>I have taken Notice by General Discourse; Your Lord∣ship in your Publick Attendance on the Worship of God, appears to Desire the Reconciliation of <HI>Protestants,</HI> whe∣ther under those undesirable, and, as too much mannaged, unkind distinctions of <HI>Episcopacy, Presbytery,</HI> or <HI>Congregati∣onal</HI> Union.</P>
<P>I hope, It is, as Falling out <HI>this Year,</HI> not without hap∣py Presages of that Blessed <HI>Philadelphian</HI> Church-State speedily about to enter; In which all such Names of differ∣ence will be lost in both the Purity and Love, that will over∣flow them in the Succession of that <HI>Kingdom;</HI> And as I have
<PB REF="3"/> some Years ago Foretold; That the <HI>Cathedral</HI> of <HI>Pauls,</HI> (as we stile it) whose Loughty Pile, which Providence seems to have allowed the Preparation of, for the <HI>National</HI> Solemn Acknowledgments of God in the <HI>Peace,</HI> wherein your <HI>Lordship</HI> will bear such a Figure, shall yet, (I am perswad∣ed) speedily with those <HI>Names of Prelation</HI> and <HI>Prefidency</HI> in it, that have their only Basis in that Antiquity, wherein the <HI>Synagogue of Sathan</HI> began to have the <HI>Ascendency,</HI> and not in pure Scripture-Antiquity, <HI>Bow Themselves</HI> at the <HI>Feet</HI> of that <HI>Philadelphian State,</HI> and <HI>Acknowledge,</HI> Christ hath Loved and Chosen it; or else both the <HI>Prelacy</HI> and the <HI>Cathe∣drals</HI> will suffer Abrogation, and become useless;</P>
<P>There is one thing more, I Congratulate to your Lord∣ship this Year of your so eminent <HI>Magistracy</HI> in; And that is, An appearance of Zeal for the Retrenchment and Ex∣tirpation of open Prophaness, Irreligion, and Lewdness of Manners: I cannot but have an Honour for any such un∣dertaking, and beseech of God his presence with it, and Blessing upon it; So far as it bears, but a desire to prepare for, (if I may so allude) a <HI>Temple</HI> for God in the <HI>Nation;</HI> and I doubt not. It will have the assistance of your Authority, and other the Religious Participants of your Government; But yet I cannot but hope▪ <HI>Our Greater Solomon</HI> will be supreme in the Administrat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and Raise it much higher then Man can do.</P>
<P>My Lord▪ As to my self, I cannot claim any particular Knowledge of, or Interest in you; but looking upon your Magistracy in 88, and 98, as Honoured with a Prophetick∣ness, I have on that Account taken the boldness to In∣scribe your Name, and I do very humbly beseech your
<PB REF="4"/> Patronage of this Review under its Great Patron, and the acceptance of this Dedication; Till it shall be able, as I hope, it will within few Months be, to Answer for it self to all that shall <HI>send to it or ask a Reason of its Hope;</HI> as owned by that Higher Patronage, publickly in the Eyes of all. In the mean time, as I most humbly beg the Prayers of all, who <HI>Love the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> So my most Fer∣vent and Earnest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upplications shall be for the <HI>Magistracy</HI> of this <HI>Great City,</HI> and their as Honourable Station in the King∣dom of Christ; and most particularly for your Lordship.</P>

<HEAD>An earnest Invitation, and Perswasion to All, that profess a Reverence of the Divine Majesty, to <HI>Regard</HI> the <HI>Works</HI> of the <HI>Lord;</HI> and to take <HI>Pleasure</HI> in <HI>Searching</HI> them out in their <HI>Greatness,</HI> particularly this Year; By way of Preface to the following Discourse.</HEAD>
<P>SEeing this Review rests upon the very Eminent Appearances of God in this present Year 1697, I think it no way Improper to prefix a serious per∣swasive, deeply to consider the <HI>Operations</HI> of the <HI>Divine Hand,</HI> and to <HI>search them out, as Hidden Treasures.</HI></P>
<P>It is the <HI>Atheism,</HI> and Irreverence of the Divine Being, and his Government of the World, that we Lavish out his Great Providences into no other Dis∣courses, but as of News; This is not the Business of a serious Christian, and of those who have the Assistance of <HI>Sacred History,</HI> directing us what observations to make upon those works; and the <HI>Sure Word of Prophecy</HI> Guiding us, what we are to expect, by due Reflexion, on what God hath done according to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> to what he will do to the End of the World: It is not enough for us with a shew of Great Wisdom and Foresight, to Dilate upon the Political Tendencies of Great Events, least we Fall into the <HI>Hipocrisy</HI> of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who were able to make Natural observations on the Face of the Heavens, but could not <HI>Discern the signs of the Times:</HI> We ought as to make Improvement of Mercies, and Judg∣ments, <HI>to search and try our ways, and to turn unto the Lord; to Praise Him for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men; So to Ʋnderstand as the Sons of Issachar</HI> the <HI>Times,</HI> that we may know what <HI>Israel ought to do;</HI> how to order our Supplicati∣ons, and Declarations of the Hand of God; For all his Servants are yet <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itnesses in Sackcloth, who have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower to smite the Antichristian Earth with Plagues, as often, as they will;</HI> And it is their Duty at all Times to will <HI>to do it;</HI> to <HI>Prophecy</HI> to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> as God Commanded <HI>Ezekiel;</HI> That is, with Resolution, and Constancy to declare the Judgments of God on the <HI>Antichristian Papacy;</HI> and to <HI>shoot with the Arrow of the Lords Deliverance,</HI> not Twice or Thrice, but Seven Times to its utter Ruine; and to <HI>Give no Rest to our God,</HI> Till He make <HI>Jerusalem a Praise in the Earth.</HI> It is the Great Sin of Protestants, they do neither at this Time, with Becoming Zeal.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>I will therefore present, as under one view, the Great Works of God this Year, that are more Largely Discoursed in the following Treatise, and with some Remarks, that have not been made therein.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Peace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n these <HI>European Nations</HI> Signed the very Day of the Ancient <HI>Attonement,</HI> and <HI>Jubilee,</HI> and the <HI>Emperors</HI> Entry into it on the Day of <HI>Luthers</HI> Publication of his Gospel▪ Positions in the First opening of the <HI>Reformation</HI> 1517; Oh! That as that was in the Beginning of <HI>Half Time,</HI> so there may be at this End of it, a far Higher <HI>Jub l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> and <HI>Reformation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Turkish</HI> so wonderful Defeat, as struck with a Divine Terror, so upon the <HI>Prophetical Hour</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> and it still continuing; Answering the Beginning of the <HI>Beasts</HI> Forty two <HI>Moons;</HI> and so, I hope▪ at this Time declaring His End.</P>
<P N="3">3 The Prince of <HI>Muscovies</HI> so Illustrious Efforts, upon whom the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God hath appeared to <HI>Come,</HI> as on some of the worthies of Old; and by his Particular Love to <HI>Protestant</HI> Princes, as if He were the <HI>First Fruits</HI> of the <HI>Greci∣an Churches,</HI> and to be an Avenger of them on the <HI>Ottoman Power.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 The Dawns of the Kingdom of Christ in any Beginnings of his <HI>Spirit pour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out;</HI> Zeal for <HI>Reformation;</HI> and Particularly in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where God hath by that Parliament Vindicated the Contempt thrown upon that Honourable Word of the <HI>New Testament; Mystery;</HI> I hope, because <HI>Finishing Mystery,</HI> as He hath <HI>Evan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glized by his Servants the Pro-phets</HI> is so near;</P>
<P>And the Accumulation of his Great Works in All these things, on the lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er part of this Year, Gives Hopes, He is making haste with his Greater Works in the End of this, and the Beginning of the Following Year.</P>
<P>The Instances against all this in the <HI>Popish</HI> continuing Grandieur, and its seem∣ing to Increase, The <HI>Elector of Saxony</HI> under whose Ancestors, The <HI>Reformati∣on</HI> found its First Protection, Giving back Himself, though not his Power as <HI>E∣lector,</HI> to the <HI>Beast;</HI> Any other Prince doing so; The suffering Witnesses in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> not comprehended in, the Protestant Interest not sufficiently secured by the Peace; I hope, These are all only an Argument, The Great <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI> is near to break all <HI>Antichristian</HI> Power <HI>without Hand;</HI> and that when, <HI>It Crys Peace, Peace,</HI> Its <HI>Plagues</HI> shall <HI>Come in one Hour.</HI></P>
<P>And that <HI>Man of sin</HI> with that <HI>Blasphemous Title; His Holiness;</HI> shall be Thrown out of the <HI>Temple of God</HI> wherein He fits as God; by the <HI>Prayers of All Saints; and the Lord whom we seek, suddenly will come into His Temple.</HI></P>
<P>Now to All these Great purposes, Let the <HI>Lord God of the Holy Prophets, the Amen, the Faithful Witness,</HI> the Blessed Spirit, as <HI>Seven Eyes</HI> of Wisdom and <HI>Horns of Power, Running through All the Earth,</HI> Appear for his Kingdom and Bless this Discourse, and Fulfil the Word of his most unworthy Servant.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Review</HI> Of what God hath been pleased to do this Year accord∣ing to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> and particulorly near the 23d of the Month we stile, <HI>August;</HI> with a most humble <HI>A∣pology</HI> and <HI>Defence</HI> concerning the falling short of Events, of what was expected according to the <HI>In∣terpretation of that sure Word of Prophecy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving made so Long, and Large Declarations of what I have drawn from the <HI>Sure Word of Prophecy,</HI> concerning this <HI>Present Year</HI> 1697. And particularly near the 23d of the Month we Call, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugust;</HI> And that nothing of so Great an Appearance hath yet been vouchsafed by our Good and Gracious God; It may be looked upon as my Duty, to make either an Humble Acknowledgment of my mistake, and the Deception, that the Just and Holy Lord hath left me to therein, or to offer some <HI>Apology</HI> and <HI>Defence</HI> for my self.</P>
<P>Now in the first Place, I would make the lowest and most self-abasing Ac∣knowledgment; That I am most unworthy of any such Gracious Communica∣tion, or Manifestation from God in his Word; And most worthy, whom He should give up to Error and Mistake: And that therefore, It would be no won∣der, nor any thing strange, If. He in just Wrath and Displeasure have so left me; All I have to say, or plead against its being so, is Infinite Riches of Grace, Mercy and Compassion in Christ to the <HI>Cheif of Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>But this being first Acknowledged, there is yet the Great Honour I owe to the Word of Truth, and to the weighty Reasons and Arguments I have de∣rived from it; and the obligations that Lye upon me, to make the most Low∣ly and Thankful Declarations for any Communications of Light to me, and of what God hath been pleased to begin to do this Year, and so hath not left wholly exposed, what I have spoken with Relation to 97. I would render there∣fore the best Accounts I could, in Points of so Great weight and concernment to the Churches of Christ, and even to the World in General, and to my self in Particular.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
<P>The General Proposal being then, to make a Review of this Year accordng to <HI>Prophecy;</HI> I would reduce the Discourse upon it to these four Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. To observe in a General way, and to Acknowledge Freely, what is most undeniably wanting in any thing, that hath yet come to pass, of the Great Ex∣pectations according to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> as yet in this 97.</P>
<P N="2">2. To press notwithstanding; That due Confession and Adoration be made of, and to Divine Providence in what hath Eminently been done this Year, and upon the very Time according to <HI>Prophecy;</HI> And to enquire diligently into its agreement with <HI>Prophecy.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To consider what is to be expected, as Imported to us in that of our Lords Oath; That the <HI>mystery</HI> of God shall be <HI>finished</HI> in the Days of the <HI>Seventh An∣gel, when</HI> Rev. 10. 7. <HI>He shall Begin to sound,</HI> by observing the several Appli∣cations of the Word <HI>Mystery</HI> to Things in the New Testament; And shew∣ing, that every one of those things shall have their Complement, and Finishing from the <HI>Seventh Angel Beginning to sound,</HI> Till the very <HI>Kingdom of Christ,</HI> and In it.</P>
<P N="4">4. To offer the best Conciliating Apprehensions, and Hopes with Relation to Time, according to Scripture, and <HI>Prophecy,</HI> between the Failure of Expe∣ctation in 97; With what is to be Expected in 97 Ending, and 98 Beginning.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the first Head, I must Humbly and Freely Acknowledge, we do not yet behold the mighty effects of the <HI>Spirit of Life</HI> from God, upon the <HI>Witnes∣ses</HI> in their sufferings under <HI>Anti-christian</HI> Powers; or the Universality of the Witnesses of Christ out of their <HI>Sackcloth-state,</HI> and <HI>Mournful Prophecy</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom of Christ</HI> in delay, and not yet being in its Illustrious Appearance: They have yet the <HI>Seale</HI> of Concealment on their <HI>Foreheads,</HI> and do not yet stand on <HI>Mount Zion</HI> with the <HI>Lamb, having his Fathers Name</HI> Conspicuously written on those very <HI>Foreheads,</HI> where the <HI>Seal</HI> was before. That is, there is not yet that <HI>Pouring out of the Spirit;</HI> They are not yet publickly justified, as the <HI>Witnesses</HI> of Christ along the 1260 Years.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the Stone cut out of the Mountains, that is not in Humane Hands;</HI> That is; That doth his Great Works immediately by himself, in breaking the <HI>Image</HI> of the <HI>Four Monarchyes</HI> in the last of them, and himself <HI>becoming a Great Mountain filling the whole Earth,</HI> hath not yet thus appear'd; must also be confessed.</P>
<P N="3">3. That therefore the <HI>Antichristian,</HI> and the <HI>Mahometan</HI> State joyn'd with it, tho as a woe upon it, are not so broken yet, as that the <HI>Kingdoms of this World</HI> should by the <HI>Ten Kings</HI> being <HI>overcome</HI> by the <HI>Lamb,</HI> be Proclaimed to be <HI>become</HI> the <HI>Kingdoms of the Lord,</HI> and of his <HI>Christ,</HI> and He himself Universally Ac∣knowledged <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and his witnesses with Him, Called, Chosen, Faithful,</HI> and known to be so. All which I had Hoped and Expected, should have come to pass in this Year 97: and in the <HI>Prophetical Hour, Viz.</HI> In the latter part of the Month <HI>August:</HI> Herein therefore and thus far, I most willingly and humbly Acknowledge my <HI>Fault</HI> and <HI>Mistake:</HI> I come therefore to the Second Head, and that is to observe, how far God hath been pleased to own his unworthyest Servant this Year, and in the very time of the Year, in the Interpretation of <HI>Prophecy.</HI></P>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<P>And there are two Things, which I would Remark upon, as very Eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isposes of Providence, wherein by <HI>Regarding the Operations of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>Searching</HI> out the more hidden Things in the Works of his Hand, as those who <HI>Take Pleasure therein;</HI> We may find a very wonderful agreement of Providence, with <HI>Prophecy</HI> in this very Year, and at that Noted time of the Year.</P>
<P N="1">1. The First is, That so Illustrious Providential Revolution, of setting Peace in so many of the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> (into which the <HI>Western Roman Empire</HI> hath stood so long divided) after so long a War.</P>
<P N="2">2. The strokes by the supreme ordination of Divine Government in the World, by the Hand of the <HI>Prince of Mascovy,</HI> as a Prince of the <HI>Christian Pro∣fession</HI> (according to those we Call) <HI>the Grecian Churches;</HI> and by the Hand of the <HI>Imperial Power,</HI> that submits its self to the <HI>Roman Church</HI> (as it is also cal∣led) and its <HI>Papacy</HI> upon the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>And on each of these I would make their Particular, and Peculiar Remarks, and First on the First.</P>
<P><HI>Rem.</HI> 1. The settling Peace in the <HI>Borders</HI> of any Nation, and of Nations together, after many Evils, and Harassings of War is a Great Mercy and Goodness of God to those Nations, wherever It is dis∣play'd. This is very easily Intelligible, and as easily Acknowledged by the Rejoycings, and Hopeful Expectations from the present Peace, and the Tri∣umphs wherewith it is Receiv'd: And War is Accounted one of the <HI>Four Great Judgments</HI> of God in the World.</P>
<P>If we then consider, what an unreformed Nation we our selves are, and how unreformed the Nations about us are; It is not according to the usual Method of Providence to Remove Judgments without much Greater Effects of Ruine, or Reformation; What then can we think, but that God bears with Patience the Great Provocations of the Nations of <HI>Europe?</HI> Because they are Kingdoms, that Peculiarly belong to the <HI>Kingdom of Christ;</HI> For the <HI>Lamb</HI> shall <HI>overcome the Ten Kings,</HI> into a Voluntary subjection to his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 17. 14, 16.</NOTE> <HI>Kingdom;</HI> Which appears in that, They shall <HI>Hate the Whore, and burn her Flesh with Fire.</HI> I cannot but hope therefore, God spares them from Ruining one another, because he reserves them for that Time. Thus, because he would make the <HI>Israelites a Type of the Kingdom of Christ;</HI> Altho even at the Time of their deliverance from <HI>Egypt, They Lifted up their Eyes to the Idols of Egypt, and God lifted up his Hand to Destroy them, yet he wrought for his Name sake, and did not Destroy them;</HI> And so I hope he does now.</P>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 2.

<PB N="5" REF="7"/> that that Prince, who hath Arrogated to Himself in the common Lan∣guage of his People; <HI>Our Monarch;</HI> as Preparatory to the Style of <HI>Ʋniversal Monarch;</HI> should so quietly Resign and Give up his pretensions; and I make no doubt, however Insensibly to himself and others, through the secret Force and Constitution of <HI>Prophecy;</HI> That the <HI>Western Roman Empire, that was under one Caesar</HI> as supreme, till It ceas'd in <HI>Augustulus;</HI> and then was to be Variegated in∣to <HI>Ten Kingdoms</HI> as <HI>Ten Toes</HI> under One <HI>Papal Head,</HI> or <HI>Supremacy</HI> in an <HI>Image,</HI> as <HI>Prophecy styles it most Prophetically,</HI> (which it also styles the <HI>Beast</HI>) might so be, till his <HI>Time, Times and Hast a Time</HI> shall be Accomplished; When those very <HI>Ten Kings,</HI> who gave their <HI>Kingdom</HI> to him, shall together as <HI>Ten,</HI> Recall it, and hate the <HI>Whore;</HI> As therefore <HI>Prophecy</HI> hath been in this Peace just to its word, They shall be <HI>Ten</HI> till then; So I doubt not, It will be true in their speedy subjection to the <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and <HI>Lord of Lords,</HI> whose Right Alone, It is, to be the truely <HI>Ʋniversal Monarch;</HI> And this shall be, when the <HI>Ten Kings</HI> shall be thus <HI>overcome;</HI> It is therefore so signally set at that Time, and on that <HI>overcoming;</HI> He is <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and <HI>Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P>And it is much the more Remarkable, That the Great Lord, who hath Times, even as the Hearts of Men and Princes, in his own Hand, should order this Peace in the Year 1697.

<P><HI>Rem.</HI> 5. It is very Greatly to be remarked, that God was pleas'd in the Last 1688. To have made an Extraordinary (Universally Acknowledged to be so) <HI>Revolution</HI> in these Protestant Nations, of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> in Bar of <HI>Popery</HI> (endeavouring to return upon them) and Universal Monarchy; That hath been owned, confederated, and allyed with by some of the Greatest Princes, that yet <HI>Give their Kingdom to the Beast;</HI> and hath been disputed by the <HI>French King,</HI> from the very Entrance of it, and in continuation, till this <HI>Peace;</HI> And with whom the <HI>Abdicated King,</HI> the Late King <HI>James</HI> hath had his Resi∣dence ever since; Now that God hath been pleased to own the <HI>Protestant Prince,</HI> this <HI>Revolution</HI> brought in; to sustain him, and these Nations in so Long and Expensive a War, in the midst of many great Losses by <HI>Sea,</HI> in a mutual satis∣faction, and confidence one in another; That he hath preserved him in so many Hazardous Passings, and Repassings the <HI>Sea,</HI> in so many Approaches of Dan∣ger, and Jeopardyes of Life (as Scripture speaks) in the <HI>High Places of the Field,</HI> where his person was so constantly Adventur'd; That he hath been so se∣cur'd from Private Conspiracys, and Assassinations; and now so Highly Ag∣niz'd, so Publickly, so Solemnly and Augustly by the very <HI>French King,</HI> who made it his Glory to disown Him; and is Returned this very Year of 97. Safe with Publick Tryumphs and Rejoycings in the Peace, equal to the Try∣umphs of a Victory, how Glorious soever; Oh, how many Grand Agreements hath all this with <HI>Prophecy!</HI> The attempts of Refunding <HI>Popery</HI> into these Na∣tions, hath been a Design, as Ancient among the <HI>Depths of Satan,</HI> the <HI>Arca∣na Imperii,</HI> or Counsels of <HI>Antichristianism,</HI> as the settlement of the <HI>Reformation</HI> here, and by all Imaginable Artifices of Policy and Power; And it seem'd the very <HI>Crisis</HI> for it in that last Reign; That the most High decided against it with so High a Hand, was very Glorious; That God hath given so Great Ad∣vantages in Appearance for the Return of King <HI>James</HI> by such a War, so Te∣dious, so Burdensome, in such an absence of the <HI>King;</HI> And that the whole should be thus resolv'd into so very an <HI>August</HI> Acknowledgment by the Grand opposer of Him; and that the Interest of the same King <HI>James</HI> should be, as it were hush'd into such a silence, and neglect, as now appears, and by his very so Great Allie, is a very Exalted Hand of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> for the Justification of the Reformation in these Nations; And that it should be reserv'd for this Year 97. Is an Honourable Character fixed upon this Year (as I hope) Immediately pre∣ceeding the entrance of the <HI>Kingdom of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rem.</HI> 6. That the War hath been Carryed on by such a Ballance of Equality, that, except we consider that Great Intention of Providence, to consine within his own Figure Allowed by <HI>Prophecy,</HI> the <HI>French King,</HI> (in which It Confederated so many Princes and States, however differing among Themselves) and the secu∣ring <HI>Protestancy</HI> to these Nations; Except I say, we consider this; All hath been <HI>Labouring in the very Fire, and wearying the Nations for very Vanity;</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/> And yet God hath, as by an Immediate Hand of his own, Determined All in∣to Peace; This is, I have Great Trust; Because the next Thing he will do, shall be, to <HI>Fill the Earth with the Knowledge of his Glory, as the Waters cover the Sea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rem.</HI> 7. I should Rejoyce to find this Peace Propagating an Universal <HI>Refor∣mation</HI> of the open prophanesses, and wickednesses of the Nations; Which the <HI>Societyes for Reformation</HI> in this City give some Hopeful Appearances of; and it is much to be desired, The Power of the Magistrate would with it's own Au∣thority and Influence, Encourage such Honourable undertakings: And if it be not so, as I doubt not It will, a Greater Magistracy will <HI>Take the matter into its own Hand:</HI> But the very Motions however unformed, or Abortive they would, or might prove of Themselves, are some Preliminary Motions to that Great <HI>Reformation, the Kingdom of Christ</HI> will bring in, when to the <HI>People shall be turned a Pure Language; And Men shall Fear the Lord, from the Rising of the Sun to the going down of the same.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rem.</HI> 8. It is Greatly to be Lamented, if the suffering <HI>Witnesses of Christ,</HI> in any parts Comprehended within this Peace, have found no place of considerati∣on in it and Relaxation by it; But if they have not, I am the more Assured; It is reserv'd for the Immediate Hand of the <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and <HI>Lord of Lords, overcoming the Ten Kings,</HI> and moving them, as by an Impulse from himself with the <HI>Hatred of the Whore;</HI> and He will shew his Servants, as a <HI>Light Arising</HI> in the darkness of their sufferings yet continuing, the <HI>Morning Star</HI> in the first Dawns of his <HI>Kingdom;</HI> Till it shall come to the <HI>Bright Morning Star</HI> of his own Glorious Appearance in that <HI>Kingdom</HI> at the Highest Elevation of it.</P>
<P><HI>Rem.</HI> 9. It is in the next Place of a most Hopeful Reflection to me, That this Peace Falls, as a Blow upon the League between the <HI>French King,</HI> and the <HI>Turkish Sultan,</HI> so as to dissolve it; For as I have heretofore argued, so I shall now more Fully, and yet very Breifly Represent it: The true Account of the <HI>Visi∣onal</HI> order of <HI>Breaking the Image, Dan.</HI> 2. Is, That the <HI>Stone smote the Image on its Feet of Iron and Clay</HI> First, and so the whole was broken: This is most Precisely and Definitively set down, <HI>v. 34. The Stone Cut out, which is not in Hands, smote the Image upon his Feet, which were of Iron and Clay, and Brake Them to Peices:</HI> And again, <HI>v. 35. Then was the Iron and the Clay</HI> First) and All the <HI>Image Broken, so, that it became as the Chaff of the Summer-Threshing Floor:</HI> This therefore from compare of one part of this <HI>Prophetick Vision</HI> with another, and with the New Testament <HI>Prophecy</HI> of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> must be the Order The First part of the <HI>Image</HI> smitten is the <HI>Iron Feet</HI> of the <HI>Ten Kings</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 17.</NOTE> <HI>overcome by the Lamb, and the Called, Faithful, Chosen Witnesses with Him;</HI> Then these <HI>Ten Kings,</HI> who had with one <HI>Consent given their Kingdom and Power to the Beast, serve the Lamb by hating the Whore, and burning her Flesh with Fire;</HI> This shaking, as an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> the <HI>Great City,</HI> and its <HI>Decemprincipality,</HI> or Tenfold Principality Arising from the <HI>Ten Kings, so giving their Power to the Beast, that Carryed Her, Falls.</HI> Thus the <HI>Clay is Broken</HI> by the First Approach of the <HI>Kingdom of Christ,</HI> weilding the <HI>Iron,</HI> or the Ten Kings to his service: But then All is <HI>Threshed and Broken,</HI> as into <HI>Chaff,</HI> by the <HI>stone Becoming a Moun∣tain
<PB N="8" REF="9"/> fuling the whole Earth;</HI> So there remains no Power but Christ's, and his Saints with him, to whom the <HI>Dominion under the whole Heaven is given.</HI></P>
<P>But now, <HI>v. 45. The Stone cut out of the Mountains without hands, brake in peices</HI> first <HI>the Iron,</HI> then nor <HI>the Clay,</HI> but <HI>the Brass.</HI> The True Order of the Final Stroke was set down before, which could not be changed; what therefore is given, <HI>v.</HI> 45. must be some previous and preparatory stroke, that Falls upon the Iron and the Brass in a Conjunction; and the Greatness, that Each▪ had by that Conjunction, comes to nothing: And by that change of the Order, this Previous Stroke is shaded under the Full and Final Breaking of the whole, and silently intimated by it. By the <HI>Iron</HI> I understand the <HI>French</HI> Power, in this Great Spread of it self against so many of the <HI>Ten Kingdoms confederated,</HI> as it hath been of late years, and its Aspirings to be the whole <HI>Iron</HI> it self; that is, to <HI>Ʋniversal Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>And this I look upon to be noted by the <HI>Iron</HI> in this place of <HI>Daniel;</HI> By the <HI>Brass</HI> I Apprehend the <HI>Grecian</HI> Power, as now in the Hand of the <HI>Turk;</HI> whose <HI>Port</HI> is the <HI>Grecian Constantinople:</HI> Now then this is a <HI>private Proph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tical</HI> Watch-word of the very Time, when the whole <HI>Image</HI> shall be Broken; It shall be, when that Unnatural Conjunction between Him, who would be the whole <HI>Iron</HI> of the <HI>Feet,</HI> and who will be called the <HI>most Christian King,</HI> and the now <HI>Belly of Brass,</HI> the <HI>Turkish Power,</HI> the Professed Enemy of Chri∣stians, shall be Broken by the <HI>Stone,</HI> cut out of the Mountains, in his Su∣preme Providence, and come to nothing: Now this Conjunction we see thus brought to nothing by this <HI>Peace;</HI> the <HI>French King</HI> not able to bear up his Former retensions by the Loss of <HI>Turkish Aids;</HI> nor the <HI>Turk</HI> against the <HI>Emperor,</HI> by the Loss of <HI>French</HI> Assistances. And in this very 97. why then should we not look for the whole <HI>Image</HI> to be soon after Broken in its own Just Order now First given? And the Strokes upon the <HI>Turk</HI> in the very Time of the Treaty are Justly to be looked upon as the Proclaiming his <HI>Coming to an End,</HI> and <HI>None to help Him:</HI> Now if this be a True Interpretati∣on of this <HI>Prophetic Vision,</HI> (and I do not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e what can be objected to it) what a Great Assurance is it, That in this 97. the Great Change that this <HI>Ʋision</HI> foretells must needs be very near to come into effect; and who can once imagine, that so Divine a <HI>Vision,</HI> so exactly in every Thing framed, could by Chance, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot without some Great Design, and Purpose, Tran∣spose the <HI>Iron</HI> from the <HI>Feet of Iron</HI> and <HI>Clay,</HI> to the <HI>Belly and Thighs of Brass,</HI> and place the <HI>Clay</HI> of the <HI>Feet</HI> between the <HI>Brass</HI> of the <HI>Belly,</HI> and the <HI>Silver</HI> of the <HI>Breast.</HI> And I cannot but demand, what Fairer Exposition, or Interpretation of Providenttal Event, could be given to such a <HI>Prophecy?</HI> Now I must be bold to say, <HI>Whoso hath Wisdom,</HI> let him consider it; <HI>The Wise shall understand,</HI> but the Prejudiced and the Careless <HI>will not understand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rem.</HI> 10. All this is much the more Remarkable in that Prince, who hath been the severe Enemy, and the open Persecutor of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and yet continues so; and therefore i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Kingdom of Christ be so near, as these Com∣pares of <HI>Prophecy</HI> give hopes; he must either be Removed suddenly by a stroke of Judgment, or by so eminent a Conversion, as Persecuting <HI>Paul</HI> was an
<PB N="9" REF="9"/> <HI>Hypotyposis,</HI> or Pattern of; For he hath Raged even to <HI>Madness</HI> against the <HI>Re∣formation,</HI> and been <HI>Breathing out Threatnings</HI> against the <HI>Witnesses of it,</HI> and so continues; And yet his <HI>Kingdom</HI> is one of the <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> whose <HI>Kings</HI> shall be <HI>o∣vercome by the Lamb, and Hate the Whore.</HI> He must then either be a Great Instance of Converting Grace, as it were from Heaven, (or of Judgment)▪ and seeing <HI>the God of All Grace</HI> is most Glorious in the Former, and the Fruit of it might be much Greater in the World; I look upon it as our Duty, to pray for it, and desire it, if I may not say, to hope for it; That God, who hath bowed his Heart so far in the Acknowledgment of a <HI>Protestant Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g,</HI> so set up by himself, may please also to Bow his Soul to the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> and to a Zeal for it answerable to his former Persecutions, and to this very day.</P>
<P>Now thus far I have Remrak'd upon the First of the Providential Events of this Year, as it is preparatory to the Kingdom of Christ, according to the <HI>Interpretation of Prophecy,</HI> That <HI>Prophecyings may not be despised,</HI> but All awak∣en'd Earnestly to Pray, and wait for that <HI>Kingdom;</HI> seeing there is so much to be observ'd in this Providential Revolution of the <HI>Peace,</HI> as to be a <HI>Door of hope,</HI> and a <HI>Day of small Things;</HI> and that in this very Year of 1697. And I dare not Assume it to be more, I humbly confess, as yet; As in the Following Observations upon the Great Strokes on the <HI>Turkish Potentacy,</HI> I shall further Acknowledge.</P>
<P>I come now to the Second Grand Providential Event of this Year 1697. The severe Strokes, The Great Governour of the World, and <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> hath caused by the Arms of the <HI>Czar of Muscovy,</HI> and of the <HI>Emperor of Ger∣many,</HI> to fall upon the <HI>Mahometan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttoman Signiory;</HI> and to adjust them by <HI>Pro∣phecy</HI> to the near Approach of the Kingdom of Christ.</P>
<P>That I may present this in the Clearest and most Compendious Table, I shall First consider <HI>Mahometanism in the General,</HI> as <HI>common</HI> to the <HI>Saracens and Turks;</HI> and then peculiarly, as it is now seated in the <HI>Ottoman Turkish Emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and each in several short Notes of Observation; and Argue from them the Great Hopes, that these Strokes upon that <HI>Mahometan Imposture and Tyranny,</HI> are Fore-Runners of the Final Dissolution of it, and of the <HI>Kingdom of Christ,</HI> succeeding.</P>
<P N="1">1. The very Essential State of this <HI>Imposture</HI> and <HI>Tyranny,</HI> is design'd by God, as a <HI>Mock-Antichrist</HI> to the Grand <HI>Roman Papal Antichrist,</HI> a <HI>Paraselene,</HI> or Counterfeit <HI>Moon</HI> to his <HI>Moon,</HI> even as <HI>Antichrist</HI> is a <HI>mock-Christ,</HI> or in Despite to our True <HI>Lord Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Mahomet</HI> acknowledges Christ a Great <HI>Prophet,</HI> even as <HI>Antichrist</HI> does; but robs Him of the Glory of his Divinity, and of being the onely Su∣preme, True <HI>Prophet,</HI> wherein He is an <HI>Antichrist.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He Abhors Idols; Herein He mocks <HI>Antichristian Idolatry,</HI> but sets up the <HI>Idol-Prophet, Mahomet;</HI> Therein He is an <HI>Antichrist.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. He pretends to an <HI>Ʋniversal Kingdom;</HI> Herein He mocks the <HI>Papal An∣tichrist;</HI> One by the Spiritual, the other by the Temporal Sword, pretends to an <HI>Ʋniversal Kingdom,</HI> but both undermine <HI>Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Kingdom,</HI> and Both are <HI>Anti∣christs</HI> therein.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<P N="4">4. He offers a Fools <HI>Paradice,</HI> and Deliverance from Future Misery, but as Counterfeit as the <HI>Popes</HI> Deliverance from Purgatory, by his <HI>Key of the Bottom∣less Pit;</HI> Herein are they both <HI>Antichrists,</HI> but <HI>Mahomet,</HI> as coming last, and upon the <HI>Papacy,</HI> is a <HI>Mock-Antichrist,</HI> an <HI>Antichrist</HI> in despite.</P>
<P N="5">5. He pretends some Reverence to some of the Sacred Writings, but hath brought in a Nonsensic <HI>Alcoran,</HI> as vain as <HI>Papal Traditions,</HI> and <HI>Oral Laws.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Time therefore of the Beginning of this <HI>Imposture</HI> and <HI>Tyranny</HI> was soon after the <HI>Papal Supremacy,</HI> the one at 606. the other at 622. The one the <HI>Antichristian,</HI> the other the <HI>Mahometan Hegire,</HI> when its <HI>Tyranny</HI> came forth; while the one lasts, the other lasts also; when the one ends, the other shall end also: If therefore <HI>Antichristian</HI> Times determine in 97. <HI>Mahometan</HI> Times shall determine with them; why them may we not hope, this Blow on <HI>Mahometanism</HI> is an Alarm-Blow upon Both <HI>Antichrists</HI> now ready to Expire?</P>
<P>I come now more particularly to consider the <HI>Ottoman Turkish Power,</HI> and to Remark on that, as more precisely before us in the Events of this Year; and so make these Remarks upon it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power Appear'd in the Greatest Extremity, and lowest Condition of the <HI>Witnesses</HI> after the Great Persecution upon Those we call the <HI>Vaudois;</HI> and the most cruel Slaughter of so many of Them: In Re∣venge of which, God sent the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power, to Remonstrate against the <HI>An∣tichristian Salvagenesses.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They were designed by God to Raise the <HI>Mahometan Imposture</HI> and <HI>Tyranny,</HI> to the Imperial Throne of <HI>Eastern Rome,</HI> or <HI>Constantinople.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">C. 11. 45.</NOTE> This is expressed by <HI>Daniel,</HI> as the <HI>planting the Tabernacle of his Pallace between the Seas, in the Glorious Holy Mountain,</HI> so Honourably styled, because it was the <HI>City of Constantinople,</HI> that First <HI>Christian Emperor,</HI> and Great Type of the <HI>Kingdom of Christ;</HI> This was in the Year 1453.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Ottoman Emperor, Selymus,</HI> in, or upon the First Year of the Refor∣mation, 1517. seized upon <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> styled by <HI>Daniel,</HI> Ch. 11. 41. the <HI>Glorious Land.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 There is an Absolute Determination of God; This <HI>Mahometan Otto∣man Prince shall come to his End,</HI> C. 11. 45.</P>
<P>Seeing this is so determined, we have Reason to look upon this very Year as the Year of his Approaching end, on these Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Mahometan Ottoman Emperor,</HI> Coming in as a Judgment upon <HI>Papal, Antichristian Cruelty,</HI> and Advanced to the Throne of the <HI>Eastern Roman Em∣pire,</HI> That he might be a <HI>Mock Antichrist</HI> to the Grand <HI>Antichrist</HI> in the <HI>West;</HI> He must in all the Reason and Sense of <HI>Prophecy,</HI> be Limited to the Times of the First <HI>Antichrist;</HI> Because, when the Sin is Removed, The Judgment shall be Re∣moved also; And when the True <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> shall <HI>Consume</HI> the Great <HI>Anti∣christ</HI> by the <HI>Breath of his Mouth,</HI> He will Consume All other <HI>Antichrists</HI> with Him: If then the Times of the <HI>Papal Antichrist,</HI> shall End in this 1697. The <HI>Mahometan</HI> shall End in it also.</P>
<PB REF="10"/>
<P N="2">2. Accordingly we find; The Time Assigned to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power standing prepared to obtain, and to hold in possession that <HI>Roman Eastern Empire,</HI> will exactly agree from the Time of His Rising with the End of <HI>Antichristian Times;</HI> For let us with the best and most of <HI>Chronologers,</HI> Date his Rising to the Year 1300. And <HI>Prophecy</HI> Assigns to him for the obtaining, and holding the <HI>Grecian Empire</HI> under his Power, an Hour, a Day, a Month, a Year; Which by Fair <HI>Prophetical</HI> Computation make up 397 Years, and so must end 1697.</P>
<P N="3">3. The seizing on <HI>Jerusalem</HI> just at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> when the last 180 Years, or <HI>Half Time of Antichristianism</HI> entered, is a very Hopeful Argument to me, That this <HI>Ottoman</HI> Term of Power is this Year to End; For there is a Con∣currence of Three Great Periods, according to that very seizure of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> by the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power in the Year 1517. Which Fall on this very Year 1697.</P>
<P>The Period of the <HI>Antichristian</HI> Times, in the last <HI>Half Time</HI> being Remar∣ked as by the <HI>Reformation,</HI> so by the Particular stroke of God on the <HI>Papal An∣tichrist,</HI> in the seizure of such a Place, to which so High a Devotion is preten∣ded by the Grand <HI>Antichrist</HI> into the Hand of the <HI>Mock Antichrist,</HI> and who Himself, to shew Himself a <HI>Mock-Antichrist,</HI> made the same pretence of Devo∣tion to, and at it; As History Reports of <HI>Selymus,</HI> that <HI>Turkish Saltan▪</HI> who seized it: And it is worthy observation, That the Enlargement of the <HI>Ottoman Empire</HI> at that Time, and in those Parts, and Particularly on the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oly City</HI> and <HI>Land,</HI> Gave the Fair and Plausible pretension to the <HI>Papal</HI> Raising Money by <HI>Indulgences</HI> to withstand and resist it; Which odious Cheat of <HI>Indulgences</HI> gave the Great Advantage to the <HI>Reformation,</HI> as is well known; And it gives much Encouragement to Hope; So Eminent a Consiguration against <HI>Antichristianism,</HI> as of the taking <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and the latter so Derived from the <HI>Former,</HI> upon the Year 1517. Gives it an undoubted Title to be the Begin∣ning of <HI>Half Time,</HI> or the Last 180 Years of <HI>Antichristianism,</HI> and so to be at an End this 1697.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Period of the <HI>Jewish Captivity,</HI> and <HI>Jerusalems</HI> being <HI>Trodden under Foot of All Nations;</HI> For seeing those Times upon <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> are Bounded by the <HI>Gentiles Times Fulfilled,</HI> and that the Time of the <HI>Antichristian Apostacy,</HI> are peculiarly by <HI>Prophecy</HI> Branded, as <HI>Gentiles Times of Treading un∣der Foot the Holy City:</HI> If the <HI>Antichristian Half Time</HI> (which is its last) Began 1517, and Ends 1697. Consequently the last 180 Years of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewish Captivity,</HI> and <HI>Conculcating,</HI> or Trampling under foot-Times must end, and Consequentially also, <HI>Mahometan</HI> Times, that hold <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Judea</HI> under that Conculcation, must end at the same time too.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Period of <HI>Mahometan</HI> Times Themselves, must be found in this very 1697. For then the Time of <HI>Turkish planting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abernacl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Palace, in the Glo∣rious Holy Mountain, Ceases;</HI> And <HI>Constantinople</HI> shall Return to its Former Glory under <HI>Constantine,</HI> and be a Grand City in the <HI>Kingdom of Christ;</HI> The taking therefore of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> drew so near to the Time of the <HI>Reformation</HI> at the last <HI>Half Time</HI> of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> to Foreshew, Both those <HI>Antichrists</HI> of <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West,</HI> shall be consumed together in 1697 Ending.</P>
<PB REF="11"/>
<P N="4">4. That Complication of Power, that seems at this Time to be Gathering a∣gainst the <HI>Ottoman Empire,</HI> looks like a Hopeful Symptom, Their End is now Approaching: For so <HI>Daniel</HI> describing his End, says, <HI>Tydings out of the</HI> East <HI>and</HI> North <HI>shall Trouble Him,</HI> and then the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 11. ult.</NOTE> Conclusion of All is, <HI>He shall come to his End, and none shall help Him.</HI> Now, how very exactly does this agree with the present Juncture, <HI>Viz.</HI> The Combination of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Forces on one side with the <HI>Imperial</HI> on the other side, in the same Design of bringing Him down: And what may come upon Him from <HI>Poland,</HI> He is not Insensible of; Now All these <HI>Trouble</HI> Him; And that unnatural Aid He had from <HI>France</HI> is deserting Him; So that Things make up the very Aspect of that <HI>Prophetic Vision</HI> of <HI>Daniel</HI> upon Him.</P>
<P N="5">5. If we consider the <HI>Muscovian Prince;</HI> He is of that Profession of Christia∣nity found among those we Call the <HI>Greek Churches,</HI> who, though they are the other <HI>Wing</HI> of the <HI>Roman Eagle,</HI> or <HI>Empire,</HI> that<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 12. c. 13.</NOTE> Carryed the <HI>Church</HI> into the <HI>Antichristian Wilderness,</HI> and the other <HI>Horn</HI> of that <HI>Lam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that <HI>spake as a Dragon,</HI> yet the <HI>Antichrist</HI> it self settled, in what is Called the <HI>Western,</HI> or <HI>Latin Rome,</HI> and the other are not under the Black Brand of that: These two parts of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> are styled in Relation to one ano∣ther, <HI>The Rest of Men;</HI> And it is said of the <HI>Antichristian Rest</HI> of Men, Notwithstanding the Judgment on the <HI>Eastern Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 9. ult. c. 11. 13.</NOTE> They <HI>Repented not;</HI> But of the <HI>Rest of Men</HI> of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Part, when they saw the Judgment on the <HI>Western Babylon,</HI> or <HI>Rome,</HI> they were <HI>Affrighted,</HI> and <HI>Gave Glory to the God of Heaven by Repentance,</HI> which speaks to me in short <HI>Prophetical</HI> Language, the Restitution of the <HI>Grecian Churches;</HI> And it imme∣diately follows; <HI>The Second,</HI> that is, <HI>The Mahometan woe is past;</HI> I Rejoyce there∣fore, That God hath made use of a Prince of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Profession, so Victo∣riously over the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> by whom they are now held in slavery.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Imperial</HI> Power, though yet given according to <HI>Prophecy</HI> to the <HI>Beast,</HI> is yet made use of in the Sense, It is said; <HI>The Earth helped the Woman in Drinking up the Mahometan Flood;</HI> The Judgment falls especially on the Civil, and Ecclesiastic <HI>Antichristian State,</HI> and therefore it doth its utmost to resist it; and particularly God hath made use of the <HI>German Emperor,</HI> as a Bullwark of the <HI>Western Roman Empire</HI> against the <HI>Mahometane</HI> and I hope The <HI>Empire</HI> shall yet become an eminent part of the <HI>Kingdom of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. That Great turn God hath pleased to make in the Spirit, and Victorious∣ness of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power, from so High a Tyde to so low an Ebb; And un∣der this very present Prince, who seemed to recollect All its former prowess and magnanimity, but it hath proved like a last effort, or as they speak, like a <HI>Lightning before Death.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The weight and severity of the stroke in so great a slaughter, and as by an immediate Hand of Gods own, as in Times of old on his Enemies; Terror upon them, Castingthem Headlong into the River, Does I hope Intimate a near approaching Final Destruction; And that All this is come to pass in this Year 1697. According to the <HI>Line of Time,</HI> and in those Remarkable
<PB REF="11"/> Months we Call <HI>August,</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> and in the very prophetic Hour of <HI>Au∣gust.</HI> I have so Remarked upon; and so upon the Time of the Scripture <HI>Ju∣bilee;</HI> In All which I cannot but hope, God hath been pleased to take off much of the Scandal of my mistake; And this is the Consummating Reason of my Hope.</P>
<P>I have now dispatched the Second Head of this <HI>Apology,</HI> and come to the Third; Or what, It is I expect, when <HI>Time shall be no more,</HI> but for the <HI>Finish∣ing of the mystery of God;</HI> Which I shall but just represent in the several uses, the Spirit of God makes of the <HI>Word Mystery</HI> in the New Testament; And shew, That the <HI>Mystery</HI> of God in every of those Things, shall be <HI>Finished in the Kingdom of Christ,</HI> Beginning and Going on to open it self into its Fullest Glory.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Gospel, the Comprehensive <HI>Mystery, the Mystery of Faith, of Godly∣ness; The Mystery of God, of the Father, of Christ;</HI> With All its Divine and Glorious Truths, <HI>The Mysterys of the Kingdom of Heaven; shall be Finished,</HI> by the Full Revelation of it in the <HI>Everlasting Gospel, Preached to every Nation un∣der Heaven;</HI> And particularly in that Branch, <HI>Christ Received up into,</HI> or rather for Glory, <HI>Viz.</HI> The Glorious manifestation of Himself, upon which the <HI>Apostacy</HI> hath so long layn as an Eclipse, and Delay.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Mystery</HI> of the Union betwixt Christ and Believers, in the Spiritual Marriage, shall be Finished in the <HI>Bride,</HI> the <HI>Lamb's Wife, making her self Ready,</HI> and the <HI>Marriage-Supper of the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Mystery of the Gentiles,</HI> Universally brought in, and illustriously uni∣ted as a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>One Body</HI> with the <HI>Israel</HI> of God.</P>
<P>And further, The <HI>Eclipse</HI> taken off, that is yet upon the <HI>Gentile Churches,</HI> and their return to a Full orb'd Light, according to the Promises made to the <HI>Churches</HI> in the Glorious <HI>Kingdom of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Mystery</HI> of <HI>Reconciliation, Reception, Salvation,</HI> and <HI>Fulness</HI> of All <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> when that Full Glory of the Gentiles is; Then shall be a Great Ap∣pearance of the <HI>Fulfilling</HI> All the Great promises, and Prophecys we find in both the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Testament</HI> to that People; when the <HI>Gentiles Times are Fulfil∣led,</HI> as was Noted; a Summary Assurance of which is the very Name of that City, The <HI>New Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Mystery</HI> of the <HI>Seven Churches,</HI> as <HI>Seven Golden Candlesticks,</HI> in the <HI>midst</HI> of which <HI>The Son of Man walks,</HI> and the <HI>Seven Stars</HI> of the <HI>Evangelick Ministry, seen in his Right Hand,</HI> in all the Glory of each; <HI>The Seven Churches,</HI> as <HI>Types</HI> of the <HI>Churches,</HI> of the New Testament successively with their <HI>Angels;</HI> And comprehending under them <HI>Those Grecian Churches of Asia,</HI> All brought into the Glory and Purity of the <HI>Philadelphian Church;</HI> and the <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> the <HI>City of our God coming down into it,</HI> shall then be fully <HI>Finished.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Mystery</HI> of the <HI>Antichristian Church, City,</HI> and the whole <HI>Hierarchy</HI> of it, with All its <HI>Abominations,</HI> shall be laid open, understood of All, and come to an utter end by the mighty <HI>Spirit of Christs Mouth,</HI> by the <HI>Brightness of his Ap∣pearance,</HI> and by the Judgments, He will execute according to <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. and <HI>C.</HI> 18. On the <HI>Womans Forehead was written Mystery; The Mystery of the Woman, and the Beast that Carryed Her,</HI> and the <HI>Judgment</HI> of the <HI>Great Whore,</HI> were made known
<PB N="14" REF="12"/> to <HI>John</HI> by the <HI>Angel,</HI> and it shall be a <HI>Mystery Finished,</HI> that is, Laid open and brought to an utter End.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>Mystery</HI> of the <HI>Divine will</HI> in <HI>Recapitulating,</HI> and <HI>Recollecting All Things in Heaven,</HI> and Earth in Christ, even in Him, as the <HI>Head;</HI> in the fullness of <HI>Times,</HI> of All <HI>Times</HI> (that is) in the Glorious <HI>Thousand Years-Kingdom of Christ,</HI> Eph. 1. 10.</P>
<P N="8">8. The <HI>Mystery</HI> of the <HI>Living Saints changed,</HI> who shall Inherit the <HI>New Earth,</HI> during the 1000 <HI>Years, and walk in the Light of the New Heavens,</HI> or <HI>Jerusalem above,</HI> in the sight of Christ, and of his Saints of the <HI>First Resurrection,</HI> and in Bodys every way Proportioned to that Blessed State, and <HI>Healed with the Leaves of the Tree of Life;</HI> This the Apostle shews, as a <HI>Great Mystery,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.</P>
<P>Now other then these eight Great uses of the word <HI>Mystery,</HI> or what is most clearly referring to Them, I do not find in Scripture; and seeing the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Prophecy</HI> hath so comprehensively used the word <HI>Mystery</HI> concerning its <HI>Finishing,</HI> and that each of these things is Styled <HI>Mystery</HI> in the Gospel, and shall have so certain a Consummation, and Complement in the <HI>Kingdom of Christ,</HI> We may very well Expound the one by the other, and be sure of their coming into their <HI>Finishing,</HI> when Time of a former sort, that is, of the <HI>Time, Times, and Half Time shall be no more;</HI> And because there are such direct assurances of the <HI>Finish∣ing</HI> of each of these in the <HI>Prophecy</HI> of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> How clear is it!</P>
<P>And now I come to the Fourth and Last Head; To give the duest and justest <HI>Apology</HI> concerning no more Appearance of the <HI>Finishing of the mystery of God,</HI> in All these Great mentions of it, already in this Year 1697; And to adjust be∣tween the Humblest Acknowledgment of my own mis-understanding in what Hath fallen so much below; and yet with equal Acknowledgment of what hath been already reflected upon to have passed, as an Earnest and Pledge; And wherein yet I have sure Grounds (as I most Humbly conceive and believe) in the <HI>sure word of Prophecy</HI> concerning 97. And hereof I will give Account in this short, but yet full Declaration of my self, and of my Sense herein.</P>
<P>The Year 1697. I must still look upon, as I have all along Remonstrated to be the very Year, in which the <HI>Time, Times,</HI> and <HI>Half Time</HI> of the <HI>Antichristi∣an Apostacy,</HI> and of the 1260 Years of the <HI>Witnesses in Sackcloth,</HI> and of the <HI>Church</HI> in the <HI>Wilderness</HI> are to Expire and End.</P>
<P>But now, whether in the Beginning of the Year 97. as I first Hoped, or towards the Middle of the Year, on the Twenty Third of the Month, we call <HI>August,</HI> Answering to the Twenty Third of the same Month, 476. on which the <HI>Roman Western Empire</HI> ceased in <HI>Augustulus,</HI> as I had Entertained Hopes, when I found no such Appearances in the Beginning of the Year; or that in, and with the very Ending of the present 1697. the aforenamed Terms Expire▪ <HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>The Desire of a Man is his Kind∣ness.</HI> I desire with all Sense of Unworthyness to speak it; <HI>The earnest desire of my Soul</HI> in Love to the <HI>Kingdom of Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Hope of it deferred, making my Heart even sick,</HI> excited my Zeal to prefer the Times, that I had any Reason to pitch upon, that were nearest: And this, as I now find, produced the mistake, which I desire with All Self-Humiliation to confess before God, his People,
<PB REF="12"/> and to own it as a Rebuke from Him; Though I trust, in Love, that I might not trust in my own understanding, or be any way Exalted in any Communica∣tions from his Word, but Lye low before Him; and that his Truth, and Wis∣dom may be seen in my Folly and Weakness; and in this regard I take pleasure in it; That his Power may Graciously yet Tabernacle over me, and <HI>His strength be perfected in my weakness, and his Grace sufficient for me;</HI> Under this Correction, I have come to consider; That this Year 97, must perfectly run out, Ere the <HI>Time, Times</HI> and <HI>Half a Time,</HI> the 1260 Days, and the 42 Months End; And that, as God appointed the Beginning of the Sacred <HI>Israelitish</HI> Year, to be in the Month <HI>Nisan,</HI> or about the <HI>Vernal Equinox;</HI> And that this was the Time of the <HI>Children of Israel,</HI> Going out of the Bondage of <HI>Literal Egypt;</HI> So that the Sla∣very under <HI>Spiritual Egypt</HI> should end with the Year, and Deliverance begin in 98. beginning.</P>
<P N="2">2. I always Accounted; The <HI>Apocalyptical Epoch,</HI> or the Beginning of Times Given in the <HI>Prophecy of the Revelation,</HI> take Their Commencement from the Day of the <HI>Lords Resurrection;</HI> which falls in, as is well known with the Be∣ginning of the aforenamed <HI>Israelitish</HI> Year; and consequently, the Begin∣ning of the 1260 Years must be at the same time of the Year; and conse∣quently also, They must there end; when therefore they are ended, In the beginning of the Following Year 98. shall the <HI>Passeover</HI> from <HI>Spiritual Egypt</HI> be Celebrated by <HI>the Spirit of Life on the Witnesses;</HI> Proportionably shall Follow the <HI>Pentecost of the Spirit poured out;</HI> Proportionably also shall follow the <HI>Fall of the Greai City</HI> in the Month call'd <HI>August,</HI> at the Cessation of the <HI>Beasts Months.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Herein shall be seen the Exactness of Divine Truth, and of the Just∣ness of <HI>Christ</HI> to his Oath, That there should be <HI>Time, Times,</HI> and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Half a Time</HI> to the utmost Hour; The <HI>Antichristian</HI> State then Ending with the End of 97. In the very Beginning of 98. <HI>The Sun of Righteousness shall come</HI> from under the <HI>Eclipse</HI> by the <HI>Moon</HI> of <HI>Anti∣christ,</HI> and shine out with <HI>Healing in his Wings;</HI> and so Things go forward to the <HI>Kingdom of Christ.</HI> And then comes in the other <HI>Oath</HI> Indented with it; <HI>Time</HI> of such sorts shall <HI>be no more, Rev.</HI> 10.</P>
<P>If any should say, How if you are mistaken in the Beginning of 98, as you was in 97. The Answer I must make, is, I <HI>should then lay my Hand up∣on my Mouth,</HI> and say with <HI>Job, I am vile; Once, yea, Twic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have I spoken; But I will do so no more:</HI> I would, through Grace, <HI>Repent,</HI> and <HI>abhor my self in Dust and Ashes before God,</HI> as having provoked Him so Justly to Deny his Presence and Powerful Attestation, to what I have declared out of his word; Because He was not pleased to Lead me to the true Interpretation of it; And yet I can no more be perswaded, the Appearance of that Kingdom of Christ, I have so much spoken of, can be far off, then I can be perswaded, The <HI>Prophecy</HI> of <HI>Daniel</HI> and the <HI>Revelation</HI> are not true; Because I find so Great Assurance, the whole Scope and Tendency, and the order of the <HI>Visions,</HI> and so many and great Events Recorded in undoubted <HI>History</HI> and <HI>Chronology,</HI> do so set it beyond all doubt, That this Kingdom must be near Approaching; But if
<PB REF="13"/> the Humble hopes, I have in the End of this, and the Beginning of the Follow∣ing Year, and Prayers for it be not Answered; I shall look upon my self oblig∣ed, to Acknowledge; The very particular Year, when it shall be, God hath hidden from the most Humble and Industrious search, and Enquiry into the <HI>Pro∣phecy</HI> of Scripture concerning it, which I have the Testimony of Conscience, I have waited upon Him in.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> If it be said, why will you then having been confessedly in an Error con∣cerning the Former parts of the Year 97. Presume on the End of it, and so of the Beginning of 98.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Because I find all the Great Reasons, I have Founded my Determinati∣on for 97 upon, stand as Good and as Firm for the End of it, and for the En∣trance of the <HI>Kingdom of Christ</HI> in the Beginning of 98; as in any other part of 97. And in this Regard more Firm, that hereby the Computation of Years from the <HI>Resurrection of our Lord,</HI> whith is the <HI>Apocalyptick Epoch</HI> is more As∣certained; It is more certainly known where to Begin and where to End: Hereby it is known, the 2300 <HI>Eves, Morns</HI> of Years, <HI>Dan.</HI> 8. Begin in the <HI>Vernal</HI> Beginning of each Year, and so End, where the following Year Begins. That the 1260 Years of the <HI>Witnesses Sackcloth-Prophecy,</HI> and of the <HI>Churches Wilder∣ness</HI>-State must Begin, and End so; And that the <HI>Fourty two Moons</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> and of the <HI>Beast,</HI> must be Correspondently Governed; and so the mi∣stake of <HI>August</HI> the 23 was only in a Circumstance; as if the <HI>Lunar</HI> Years of the <HI>Beast,</HI> might have begun there and so end there. But if the Beginning of all Account of <HI>Apolyptical Time,</HI> and so of the End, be the Beginning of each Year in the Spring; Then must the Event Answering the 23d of <HI>August,</HI> when the <HI>Roman Western</HI> Empire ceased, Fall into the Year, not of the last of the 1260, Because the Time of the <HI>Months</HI> will not be run out, while the Last is Current; but The first Year of the New <HI>Era</HI> of Time, for <HI>Finishing the My∣stery,</HI> and when the Seventh <HI>Angel</HI> shall begin to <HI>Sound,</HI> must produce that Great Event in that Month, we Call <HI>August;</HI> and follow the <HI>Rising of the Wit∣nesses</HI> in the Beginning of that Year, Answerable to our Lords <HI>Resurrection;</HI> and the <HI>Powring out of the Spirit,</HI> Answerable to the <HI>Apostolic Pentecost;</HI> and so the Fall of the <HI>Beastian-Power,</HI> and his Months quite darkened, Answerable to that 23d of <HI>August</HI> when they began.</P>
<P>But if there had been the Change of the very Year it self, and so the Loss of it. The very Frame of my <HI>Scripture Line</HI> it self must have been altered; If the Year 97 Must end it self, that that whole-Course of Time may end and a new one begin in the Spring of the following Year, and the <HI>Finish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng,</HI> our Lord in that <HI>Vision, Rev.</HI> 10. speaks of, Begin with it; All stands clear and firm in the main; And for this therefore I wait and pray.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 2. When I duly consider the <HI>Imperial</HI> Victory, not only as I have al∣ready spoken of it, but as I have kept in Reserve till now; That it is to be compar'd, as with the Time of the Cessation of the <HI>Western Empire of Rome</HI> in <HI>Augustu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> so with the Determination of <HI>Prophecy</HI> upon, and with Relation to that Cessation, and what it Intended, and Designed upon it; I
<PB REF="13"/> cannot but Acknowledge a very Extraordinary Hand of God in it; and such as owns a peculiar Regard to it, and gives a Pledge of Future Expectation upon it; so that I cannot with Just Estimation of, and Acknowledgment due to that, lay down either my Hopes, or publick Testimony concerning this Year Ending, and the Following Beginning.</P>
<P>First then, I consider the Time of this <HI>Imperial Victory,</HI> I have so far, and I hope not without Great Weight Remark'd upon▪ and I find the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army so in motion and preparation for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by the most Certain and Va∣luable Intelligences we have Receiv'd of it from our 23d of <HI>August:</HI> and the very Victory it self upon the 31st of that Month, according to our <HI>Old Style</HI> Account, within the Virge of the <HI>Prophetical Hour,</HI> that I cannot but stand in Humble Admiration at it: For every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove of the Armies to that very Day of Victory it self, is to be enfolded with, and united to it; So that herein is in undeniable Matter of Fact, an Agreement thus far in Time.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> I know the difference of <HI>New</HI> and <HI>Old Style</HI> may be objected; and that the <HI>New Style,</HI> as being the <HI>Reformation of the Calendar</HI> is most Exact: And that from this the <HI>Prophetical Hour</HI> in the <HI>Sixth Month,</HI> and so the Imperial Victory Flyes further off by the Ten Days difference; and the Peace in the <HI>Seventh Month</HI> from the Day of <HI>Attonement</HI> and <HI>Jubilee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. But in Answer to this, It is nothing strange, If God is pleased to neglect that <HI>Papal Reformation</HI> of the <HI>Calendar,</HI> as coming within that usurpati∣on of his <HI>Changing Times, Dan.</HI> 7. 25, Who would not Reform his <HI>Changing of Laws,</HI> even those Eternal ones of the Word of God; Although he must needs see a Divine Hand had gone some considerable Number of Years before Him in such a <HI>Reformation,</HI> by <HI>Luther,</HI> and other eminent Servants of his, <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>States, viz.</HI> from 1517. to 1582. But He, who by his Great Works of Provi∣dence, <HI>changes Times and Seasons</HI> with Supreme Right, Justice and Authority, or Retains them, pleases to Honour the <HI>Old Style</HI> with peculiar Respect to this Protestant Nation, that still uses it.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 2. Although some <HI>Times</HI> God in his Great Works observes Time to the <HI>self same Day;</HI> yet at other Times, He may, as he pleases▪ make some Variation; as <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Beginning to Build the Temple, is dated 2 <HI>Chron. 3. 2. On the second Day of the second Month from the Going of the Children of Israel out of Egypt,</HI> which was on the <HI>Self-same day</HI> of the <HI>Fourteenth</HI> of the <HI>First Month:</HI> This shews God sometimes is pleased to Allo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Latitude: I cannot therefore but most Humbly Adore Divine Goodness, in Approaching so near with so Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nent a Providence, as so compleat a Victory over the Power of the <HI>Eastern Antichrist,</HI> so Acknowledged an Enemy to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, upon the Time Remarked by the Unworthiest Mi∣nister of his <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But it is much more considerable, That the Gracious God hath, by Striking that <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck-Antichrist</HI> so near that very Day of the Cessation of the <HI>West<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>,</HI> in the Year 476; yielding Rist to the 42 <HI>Moons of the Beast,</HI> and the <HI>Ten Kings;</HI> given Warning, that according to the True Adjustment
<PB REF="14"/> of <HI>Lunar</HI> Time to <HI>Solar,</HI> Their Space of Reign then, strictly speaking, ended, and that was their last <HI>August</HI> of Power; and before the Coming of that Month, in the following Year, They shall be in Subjection to the <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and <HI>Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 4. It is most Remarkable, That the Effective Treaties of the <HI>Peace</HI> at <HI>Reswick,</HI> and the Victory over the <HI>Turks</HI> by the <HI>Imperial Forces</HI> were very hear together, by which our Wise and Holy God was pleased to show; That He would dissolve that Union between the <HI>French King,</HI> that would have been the whole <HI>Iron,</HI> or an <HI>Ʋniversal Monarch,</HI> as hath been said, and the <HI>Brass</HI> of the <HI>Graco-Turkish Potentacy,</HI> and Bring that Potentacy Low at the same time; and that by both He would preserve, as hath been before Argued, the <HI>Ten Kingdoms of the We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ern Empire,</HI> till They shall as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en</HI> be Overcome by the <HI>Lamb</HI> at the Expiration of their Term with the <HI>Beast</HI> now so near Expiring.</P>
<P>And it is indeed very observable That as in the disposes of our True God, the Power of the <HI>Eastern Empire</HI> was Thrown early after the settlement of the <HI>Ten Kingdoms</HI> in the <HI>West,</HI> out of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estern Empire,</HI> and the <HI>Exarchate of Ravenna</HI> made to cease for many Great Services, and Ends according to <HI>Proph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy;</HI> So al∣though in a way of Iudgment, God hath suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red <HI>Mahometan,</HI> parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ularly <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Eruptions into it, especially in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Transy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vania;</HI> Yet he hath still Reprima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the Attempts of the Greatest Princes among them, as of their <HI>Magnificent Solyman</HI> upon <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enna,</HI> was shamefully disgraced; and from the Last Bes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iging of it in the Year 80 That <HI>Empire</HI> hath been Tottering and Shaking: Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erein it hath dared to pass the Bounds set it by <HI>Pro∣ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy;</HI> Although it hath entered into the <HI>Holy Land, Egypt hath not escaped, Ethiopia hath been at its steps;</HI> Yet it never could stretch its Hands, as over other Countreys, Or overnow to <HI>Vienna,</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch less to <HI>Rome</HI> carried Alought by the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east.</HI> This Stroke therefore hath so overtaken and surrounded the <HI>Turkish Armies</HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ungary,</HI> as if God would give Testi∣mony; That at the same time He preserved the <HI>Ten Kingdoms</HI> from the Aspi∣rings of an <HI>Ʋniversal French Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chy</HI> by the <HI>Peace▪</HI> He would also Vindicate Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m from the Overspread of a <HI>Mahometan Turkish Overfl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w.</HI> In all which the wonder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul Doings of our Great, and Holy God, ought to be Triumph'd in by Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> His Servants; and most especially by the Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orthiest of his Servants in the <HI>Sure Word of Prophecy,</HI> as happy Forebodes of his Kingdom at the End of 97. and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eginning and Going on of 98</P>
