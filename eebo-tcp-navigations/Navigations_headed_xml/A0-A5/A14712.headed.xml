<HEAD>The Wandring Jew; <HI>OR,</HI> The Shoomaker of <HI>Ierusam,</HI> who lived when our Sauiour Christ was crucified, and appoynted by him to live untill his comming againe.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the tune of, <HI>The Ladies Fall.</HI></OPENER>

<LG>
<L>WHen as in faire <HI>Jerusalem</HI></L>
<L>our Saviour Christ did live,</L>
<L>And for the sins of all the world,</L>
<L>his owne deare life did give;</L>
<L>The wicked <HI>Jewes</HI> with scoffs and scornes</L>
<L>did daily him molest,</L>
<L>That never till he left his life,</L>
<L>our Saviour could have rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When they had crown'd his head with thorns,</L>
<L>and scourg'd him in disgrace,</L>
<L>In scornfull sort they led him forth</L>
<L>unto his dying place,</L>
<L>Where thousand thousands in the street</L>
<L>be held him passe along,</L>
<L>Yet not one gentle heart was there</L>
<L>that pittied thus his wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Both old and young reviled him,</L>
<L>as in the streets he went,</L>
<L>And nothing found but churlish taunts,</L>
<L>by every ones consent:</L>
<L>His owne dear Crosse he bore himselfe,</L>
<L>a burthen far too great,</L>
<L>Which made him in the streets to faint,</L>
<L>and blood and water sweat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Being weary, thus he sought to rest</L>
<L>and ease his burthen'd Soule</L>
<L>Vpon a stone, the which a wretch</L>
<L>did churlishly controule;</L>
<L>And said, away thou King of <HI>Jewes,</HI></L>
<L>thou shalt not rest thee here,</L>
<L>Passe on, thy execution place</L>
<L>thou see'st now draweth néere.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And hereupon he thrust him thence,</L>
<L>at which our Saviour said</L>
<L>I sure will rest, but thou shalt walke,</L>
<L>and have no journey staid:</L>
<L>With that this cursed Shoomaker,</L>
<L>for offering Christ this wrong.</L>
<L>Left Wife and Children house and all,</L>
<L>and went from thence along.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where after he had seene the blood</L>
<L>of Iesus Christ thus shed,</L>
<L>And to the Crosse his body nayld,</L>
<L>away with speed he fled,</L>
<L>Without returning back againe</L>
<L>unto his dwelling place,</L>
<L>But wandering up and downe the world,</L>
<L>a runnagate most base.</L>

<HEAD>The Second part; to the same tune.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NO resting could he find at all,</L>
<L>no ease of hearts content,</L>
<L>No house, no home nor byding place,</L>
<L>but wandring forth he went,</L>
<L>From Town to Town in forraign Lands</L>
<L>with grieved Conscience still,</L>
<L>Repenting sore the hainous guilt</L>
<L>of his fore-passed ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus after some few Ages past,</L>
<L>in wandring up and downe,</L>
<L>He much againe desir'd to sée</L>
<L><HI>Jerusalems</HI> renowne:</L>
<L>But finding it all quite destroy'd,</L>
<L>he wandred thence with woe,</L>
<L>Our Saviours words which he had spoke</L>
<L>to verifie and show.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ile rest (saith he) but thou shalt walke,</L>
<L>so doth this wandring <HI>Jew</HI></L>
<L>From place to place, but cannot stay,</L>
<L>for seeking Countries new:</L>
<L>Declaring still the power of him,</L>
<L>whereas he comes and goes,</L>
<L>And of all things done in the East</L>
<L>since Christ his death, he showes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The world he hath halfe compast round,</L>
<L>and séene those Nations strange,</L>
<L>That hearing of the Name of Christ,</L>
<L>their Idoll gods doe change:</L>
<L>To whom he hath told wondrous things,</L>
<L>of times fore-past and gone,</L>
<L>And to the Princes of the world</L>
<L>declares his cause of mone;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Desiring still to be dissolv'd,</L>
<L>and yeeld his mortall breath:</L>
<L>But yet the Lord hath thus decréed,</L>
<L>he shall not yet sée death;</L>
<L>For neither lookes be old or young,</L>
<L>but as he did those times</L>
<L>When Christ did suffer on the Crosse</L>
<L>for mortall sinners Crimes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He passed many a forraigne place,</L>
<L><HI>Arabia, Aegypt, Africa,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Grecia, Syria,</HI> and great <HI>Thrace,</HI></L>
<L>and through all <HI>Hungaria:</HI></L>
<L>Where <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> preached Christ,</L>
<L>those blest Apostles deare;</L>
<L>Where he hath told our Saviours words</L>
<L>in Countries farre and neere.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And lately in <HI>Bohemia.</HI></L>
<L>with many a <HI>German</HI> Towne,</L>
<L>And now in <HI>Flanders,</HI> as is thought,</L>
<L>he wandreth up and downe:</L>
<L>Where learned men with him confers,</L>
<L>of these his lingring dayes</L>
<L>And wondring much, to heare him tell</L>
<L>his journeys and his wayes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If people giveth this <HI>Jew</HI> an Almes,</L>
<L>the most that he will take</L>
<L>Is not above a Great a time,</L>
<L>which be for Iesus sake</L>
<L>Will kindly give unto the poore,</L>
<L>and thereof make no spare,</L>
<L>Affirming still, that Iesus Christ</L>
<L>of him hath dayly care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He nere was séene to laugh nor smile,</L>
<L>but wéepe and make great mone,</L>
<L>Lamenting still his miseries,</L>
<L>and dayes fore-past and gone.</L>
<L>If he heard any one blaspheme,</L>
<L>and take Gods Name in vaine,</L>
<L>He tells them that they crucifie</L>
<L>their Master Christ againe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you had séene him dye, sayes he,</L>
<L>as these mine eyes have done,</L>
<L>Ten thousand times a day would ye</L>
<L>his torments thinke upon,</L>
<L>And suffer for his sake all paine,</L>
<L>all torments, and all woes;</L>
<L>These are his words, and this his life,</L>
<L>whereas he comes and goes.</L>
