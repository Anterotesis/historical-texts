<HEAD>ARTICLES CONCLVDED AT PARIS the xxiiij. of Februarie 1605, <HI>by Commissioners of the High</HI> and Mightie Kings, IAMES by the grace <HI>of God King of</HI> GREAT BRITAINE, FRANCE and IRELAND, Defender of the <HI>Faith, &amp;c. And</HI> HENRIE <HI>the Fourth</HI> most Christian French King, and King <HI>of</HI> NAVAR, <HI>for the more commodi∣ous entercourse in Traffique be∣tweene their subiects.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>IRST, It is agreed, &amp; con∣cluded, that the Conuentions or Articles contei∣ned in this trea∣tie shall not be taken or repu∣ted any way to derogate from the former Treaties; But that the sayd Treaties shall remaine, and be in their first force and vertue, except in
<PB REF="3"/>those points only in which they are by this present Treatie altered.</P>
<P N="2">2 And for the better encreasing, and confirming of the Amitie and good Intel∣ligence betweene the sayd Princes; It is further agreed, that in all the Prouinces, Cities, Ports, and Hauens within either of their Kingdomes and Dominions, com∣mandement shall be giuen, That the sub∣iects of the one and the other Princes re∣spectiuely be kindly and louingly entrea∣ted, and be suffered freely and safely to ex∣ercise Merchandise, and to traffique the one with the other without any offence or molestation; and that they be not hereaf∣ter for any cause or occasion whatsoeuer vniustly vexed contrarie to the Lawes and Customes of the place vnto which they shall resort, or where they shall abide: and the Magistrates and Officers on either part shall be enioined to see that all the premis∣ses be duly obserued and executed, as eue∣rie one of them (where the contrary shall
<PB REF="3"/>be suffered) will answer in his owne pro∣per name, and as a priuate person, to the partie grieued, his expenses, damages and interest.</P>
<P N="3">3 It is likewise agreed and accorded, That all Customes, Taxes, and Impositi∣ons which now in either Kingdomes are raised, to the vse of the Kings, by their Customers, Farmers, and Deputies (as the conditions of affaires at this time requi∣reth) shalbe continued prouisionally vntill the same may be either abolished or mo∣derated; which both the said Princes will seriously endeuour to effect, as their estates shall permit. And to the end that in the meane time the said Taxes, Customes, and Impositions may on both parts bee better knowen, as also that it may appeare, what is to be paid of right, there shall be Tables made and set vp in publique places, aswell at ROAN, and other Cities in FRANCE, as at LONDON, and other Cities of GREAT BRITAINE where need shall
<PB REF="4"/>be, that thereunto recourse may be had, when question or doubt shall arise of any of the said Taxes, Customes, and Impositi∣ons in either of the kingdomes.</P>
<P N="4">4 As touching Impositions &amp; Taxes, which are required in some Cities to the particular vse and commodity of the said Cities, vnder pretext of Grants to them made by the Kings and Princes; It is a∣greed and accorded, that diligent inquirie shall be had thereof, and that the Maiors and Escheuins or Sheriffes of the Cities of ROAN, CANE, and BVRDEAVX, and of others to whom it may appertaine, shall forthwith deliuer vp vnto the Councell of the French King their saide Letters and Grants, by pretence whereof they raise and continue such Taxes and Impositions, to the end that the same being seene and viewed, may bee cancelled, and made void, if they haue not beene made orderlie and vpon iust causes; and that in the meane season the said Maiors and Escheuins or
<PB REF="4"/>Sheriffes shall be prohibited, to suffer to be taken either more then is due, or any thing otherwise than it ought by the said Grants; neither that they doe any way exceed the conditions conteined and pre∣scribed in them, vpon paine of death, and the paiment also of foure fold for that which shall be so exacted. The like where∣of is to be performed in the City of LON∣DON, and in other the Cities of GREAT BRITAIN, if it bee found that any such thing hath beene exacted there.</P>
<P N="5">5 It is also agreed that the Merchants of FRANCE traffiquing into ENGLAND shall not be constrained heereafter to giue other Caution or Bond than Iuratorie Caution, or an oath for the sale of their Merchandizes, or for the conuerting or employing of the moneys growing there∣upon into other wares; neither shall they be driuen for obtaining of further respite, or for their discharges to other cost or ex∣pence in that behalfe.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P N="6">6 Also it is agreed that the French Shippes may haue free accesse to the Keies of the City of LONDON and other ports and hauens of GREAT BRITAIN, and being there, may lade &amp; vnlade their Mer∣chandise, and let their ships to freight with like liberty, and freedome as the English do in FRANCE, without constraint to vnload their Ships or Vessels into others, or with∣out other let or impediment whatsoeuer: and also that in all other things like liberty, and equalitie of trade shall be kept, and ob∣serued on both parts as much as may be.</P>
<P N="7">7 And because it is impossible to set downe in writing a sufficient prouision and remedy to euery particular grieuance, or difficulty which may arise in commerce, and namely in respect of the qualities of Merchandize, which are to be transported to and from the one and other kingdome, as also in respect of the abuse which by the malice, negligence or want of skill of Tra∣ders sometimes may bee committed; It is
<PB REF="5"/>agreed that in the City of ROAN there shall be named and appointed by the Chri∣stian King two Merchants of good credit and reputation, being skilfull and of good experience, which with two English Mer∣chants of good condition and quality to be named by the Ambassadour of the Kings Maiestie of GREAT BRITAIN &amp;c. resi∣ding for the time in FRANCE, shall ioint∣ly receiue, and heare the complaints and controuersies of the Merchants of GREAT BRITAIN that may arise by the Com∣merce, and traffique either at ROAN or other Ports and Hauens of that Prouince, and the same they shall foorthwith accor∣ding to equity and right (hauing a respect to this present Treaty) speedily finish and compose: as also the Kings Maiestie of GREAT BRITAIN is to name two Eng∣lish Merchants of good reputation and ex∣perience, which likewise taking vnto them two French Merchants of like quality to be named by the Ambassadour of the French King residing in ENGLAND for the time
<PB REF="6"/>shall doe the like, and shall prouide speedy remedy to all the complaints which may happen by reason of the said traffique or cōmerce. And if these foure cannot agree, then by mutual assent between themselues they are to chuse and take vnto them a fift, the same being in ROAN a French man; in LONDON an Englishman; and so by the consent of the greater number of them the iudgement shall passe. And to the end that this office may with better ef∣fect be executed, there shall be giuen vnto them on either part Commissions with ne∣cessarie authoritie to performe the same: And in case any great difficultie do arise, so as it shall be conuenient or necessarie to certifie either of the Princes thereof, the said Merchants named and appointed in manner aforesaid shall take care to aduer∣tise the Councell of the Princes respectiue∣ly thereof, to the end that they may giue speedie remedie without losse of time and great charge of expences. The like order shall be established and obserued at BVR∣DEAVX
<PB REF="6"/>and CANE and other places of Mart, and Market, &amp; Cities in FRANCE, and the same also shall be obserued in the Cities of GREAT BRITAIN and IRE∣LAND, that so those Persons which shall be named &amp; appointed to vndergoe these Offices, in the said places may according to the aforesaid forme determine of the com∣plaints and difficulties which may happen by reason of Commerce and traffique be∣tweene them.</P>
<P N="8">8 And for the better accommodating of the said Merchants trading in the king∣doms and Dominions of either of the said Princes, and for easing the labours and charges of them which are appointed to this Office, so farre foorth as may be, it is agreed that the said Merchants as well En∣glish as French vnto whom this authoritie shall be committed, which hereafter shall be called Conseruators of Commerce and traffique, shall be named and appointed from yeare to yeare, and shall take oathe
<PB REF="7"/>in FRANCE before the Prior and Consuls as well in the Citie of ROAN as in the o∣ther Cities in which such Conseruators ought to bee appointed, and likewise in LONDON, and in other Cities of GREAT BRITAINE and IRELAND where need shall be, that is to say, that they shall well and faithfully performe this Office and au∣thoritie committed vnto them, and that during the time aforesaid so often as occa∣sion shall require they shall diligently in∣tend this businesse, &amp; that they shall therin affoord their labour freely, requiring no∣thing of the subiects for that cause, except where the partie shall desire a copie of the Acts in writing, in which case the taxation of the said writings shall bee made by the said Conseruators moderately and accor∣ding to reason.</P>
<P N="9">9 Moreouer it is agreed that all exces∣siue fees, wages, charges and smaller du∣ties and paiments, which Officers and Mi∣nisters of diuers places do now exact of the
<PB REF="7"/>said Merchants, namely Searchers &amp; Wai∣ters, Laders &amp; Vnladers, Packers, Porters, and generally all other such kind of Offi∣cers, and publique Ministers shall be orde∣red and moderated by the said Conserua∣tors, and a reasonable rate of their duties shall be set down which shall be presented to the Kings Councel in either of the king∣doms, and the same by them being seene and confirmed, shall afterward be publish∣ed and set vp in writing seuerally in Towns and places accustomed, to the end that the Merchants on either part may be certaine and assured of that which ought by them in such case to be paied.</P>
<P N="10">10 Also the said Conseruators shall informe themselues particularly of the li∣berties, and priuiledges which are preten∣ded, and challenged by some Cities to be due vnto them and their Inhabitants in the Kingdoms and Dominions of either of the Princes, and they shall likewise informe them of the commoditie and incommo∣ditie
<PB REF="8"/>thereof, which being done they are to aduertise their Princes on both parts, that by the aduice of their Councell the same may be moderated according to equitie, and reduced to the ancient vses of the said places and Cities.</P>
<P N="11">11 The said Conseruators shall also haue charge to looke vnto the waights and measures which are in the towns of either of the kingdoms, to the end that there be no fraud, or abuse suffered therein by neg∣ligence or deceipt of inferiour Ministers, and as for the Merchandises brought out of either of the said Princes Kingdomes, or from other places, they shall determine and order, which of them are subiect to vi∣sitation, and are to be accounted as law∣full or vnlawfull, and which not.</P>
<P N="12">12 And forasmuch as the principall complaint made by the Ambassador of his Maiestie of GREAT BRITAINE &amp;c. and by the Merchants of ENGLAND is
<PB REF="8"/>against an Arrest or Iudgement giuen in the Councell of the French King, bearing date the one and twentieth of Aprill, in the yeare of our Lord, one thousand six hun∣dred, containing an Order touching the Workemanship and qualitie of Woollen clothes to be brought into FRANCE by the English Merchants, especially into the Prouinces of NORMANDIE, the lesser BRITAINE, and GVVYEN; the said French King being desirous to giue contentment vnto his good brother the King of GREAT BRITAINE, at the in∣stance and motion made for the same di∣uers times by his Ambassador, and being willing also to further the cōmerce of Dra∣perie or Woollen Clothes, (so as no detri∣ment may thereby redound vnto the pub∣like) is pleased that the said Arrest and Iudgement be reuoked, and doth himselfe reuoke and abrogate the same, and from hencefoorth dischargeth the Merchants of ENGLAND from the confiscation or for∣feiture, imposed as well in the same Arrest,
<PB REF="9"/>as in all other Arrests and Ordinances made for, and concerning the said Drape∣rie or Woollen Clothes, and doth permit and grant vnto the said Merchants of ENGLAND, that if any Woollen Clo∣thes heereafter being faultie, and ill made, be brought by them or any of them, to be vented in FRANCE, that they may not∣withstanding carrie the same backe againe out of FRANCE. And forasmuch as the sayd English Merchants, vpon the diffe∣rence, which may grow for the qualitie and good or ill condition of their Clothes, be much troubled and hindered through losse of time, and the staying of their Clo∣thes to their damages; It is agreed, and ac∣corded, that the said Conseruators of commerce deputed in maner aforesaid, if at any time such complaint be brought vn∣to them, shall vpon due consideration of the making, and of their value, and of the price of the Clothes iudge and determine which of them are to be accounted lawfull and saleable, and which are to be reiected
<PB REF="9"/>and sent backe, as faulte and ill made: in which case, the said French King doth commit the whole consideration, and de∣termination thereof, to the honestie, and conscience of the Conseruators, and will ratifie and allow what they shall do there∣in, and touching those Clothes which shall be adiudged to be sent backe as faul∣tie, nothing shall be heereafter required by his Officers for transporting of them forth of the kingdome.</P>
<P N="13">13 It is further accorded, and conclu∣ded, That the libertie and freedome of commerce in transporting of whatsoeuer Merchandizes, whether they be Manu∣factures or Wares vnwrought, shall accor∣ding to this Treatie and other precedent Treaties be mainteined in both the King∣domes, and that no restraint or prohibiti∣ons shal be made on either side to the con∣trarie: and if any haue beene made of late, the same shall be reuoked, except notwith∣standing those Merchandizes which haue
<PB REF="10"/>beene in former times prohibited to be brought and transported foorth by speci∣all Lawes and Statutes in either of the Kingdomes: All which kinde of Merchan∣dizes, that they may be certainly knowne, are to be comprehended in writing, and deliuered to the said Conseruators of com∣merce on either side, and publiquely set vp in maner aforesaid.</P>
<P N="14">14 Moreouer it is agreed, That if there doe happen any Ship to go from GREAT BRITAINE into FRANCE, or from FRANCE into GREAT BRITAINE, laden with greater quantitie of Merchan∣dize, than for which the Custome and o∣ther duties hath beene iustly payd; in that case the said quantitie onely shall be sub∣iect to confiscation, and the residue of the said Merchandizes shall be freely dischar∣ged: Notwithstanding if amongst the said Merchandizes there be found any Wares which by the Statutes and Ordinances of the Kingdome from whence they are to be
<PB REF="10"/>transported, may not lawfully be carried; in that case, the Ordinances and Statutes of the said Kingdome are to be obserued.</P>
<P N="15">15 Likewise it is agreed and accorded, That the Merchants and Inhabitants of the Ilands of GERNESEY and IERSEY, may freely and safely trade and traffique in the Kingdome of FRANCE, and in the parts thereof, and that they shall haue and enioy the like priuiledges and liberties there, as the Subiects of the French King doe enioy in the said Ilands, paying not∣withstanding all duties in euery place ap∣pertaining vnto the Princes.</P>
<P N="16">16 The Subiects of his Maiestie of GREAT BRITAINE, shall receiue in all their causes and sutes, ready and expe∣dite iustice in FRANCE, and the Officers and Ministers of the Ports of NORMAN∣DIE, the lesser BRITAINE and GVY∣EN, shall be charged kindly and friendly to entertaine them. And if any matter of
<PB REF="11"/>greater moment and importance do arise, the French King inioineth his Councell to take vpon them the knowledge thereof themselues, or to delegate or appoint Iudges indifferent, and not suspected; As also the like order shall be taken by his Maiestie of GREAT BRITAINE to∣wards the Subiects of the French King, a∣biding within his Kingdome, and requi∣ring iustice there.</P>
<P N="17">17 The Subiects of the French King entring into the Ports of the Kingdome of GREAT BRITAINE, shall not heere∣eafter pay any thing more for Cockets, then the naturall Subiects of the said King∣dome are accustomed to pay.</P>
<P N="18">18 And if it shall happen that any of the Subiects of either of the said Kings, by storme or tempest, or for feare of the ene∣mie, shall be compelled to cast anckor in any Port, Road or Hauen, appertaining to the said Kings respectiuely, they shall not
<PB REF="11"/>be vrged to pay any Custome, or other du∣ties, either at their entrance or departure, for their Merchandizes, so casually brought in. Prouided alwaies, that the Master of the Shippes, or the Factor of the Merchants, doe the same day wherein any such Vessell shall so arriue, or the next day after the arriuall, certifie the Officers or Customers of the place, to whom it appertaineth, the true occasion of the said arriuall, and also that they (being required) shall exhibite their Charter parties, &amp; be enioined to put foorth, and depart from thence so soone as the winde may serue them, or the perill be remooued: And if it happen whilest they so remaine in the Port, that vpon ne∣cessitie they bee compelled to sell their Merchandizes, or any part thereof; then they shall pay to the Customer or Farmers, such duties as are to be answered for, to the quantitie onely of that which they haue solde; and it shall be lawfull vnto them freely to transport the rest.</P>
<PB REF="12"/>
<P N="19">19 And the French King being desi∣rous to make it more appeare how greatly he esteemeth of the amitie of his good Brother, the Kings Maiestie of GREAT BRITAINE, and his willingnesse, lo∣uingly and fauourablie to entreat his said Brothers Subiects, abiding and trading in FRANCE, and how much hee fauoureth this mutuall entercourse and Commerce betweene their Subiects, although the right of <HI>Aubeyne</HI> is woorthilie accoun∣ted amongst the most ancient priuiled∣ges and prerogatiues of the Kingdome; neuerthelesse, he is pleased to permit and grant to the English Merchants and their Procurators or Factors, and to all other the Subiects of the Kings Maiestie of GREAT BRITAINE, full libertie and right to make their last Willes and Testaments, accordingly; and according to their good liking, to dispose as well liuing as dying, of their Merchandize, Monies, Debts and of all other their mooueable goods, which either they haue or ought to haue, in any
<PB REF="12"/>the Dominions &amp; places of the said French King; and also that whether they die Te∣state or Intestate, their Heires may haue and enioy their goods, &amp;c. according to the Lawes of ENGLAND, so as hereaf∣ter their goods shall not be held confisca∣ble by the right of <HI>Aubeyne.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20 Likewise it is agreed, and accorded, That the Subiects of the French King may in the same maner freely make their Testa∣ments, and according to their pleasure may either at their death, or while they liue, dispose of their goods in ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND, and in other the Lands and Dominions of the Kings Maiestie of GREAT BRITAINE; And that after their deathes, whether they shall die Testate or Intestate, their Heires either named in the Testament or other∣wise succeeding by Law, shall according to the Lawes of FRANCE haue and en∣ioy the same goods. Prouided neuerthe∣lesse, that the Willes and Testaments or
<PB REF="13"/>Rights to succeed <HI>ab Intestato,</HI> aswell of the Subiects of the French King as also of the Kings Maiestie of GREAT BRITAINE, shall be lawfullie prouided in the place where the parties deceased and died, whe∣ther the same shall happen in FRANCE, or in the Kingdome of GREAT BRI∣TAINE, or elswhere within either of their Kingdomes.</P>
<P N="21">21 And vntill such time that iustice may be done in causes of Piracie and De∣predation pretended to haue beene com∣mitted on the one side or other, for which order shall be taken with as much expedi∣tion as may be; It is concluded, that all Letters of Mart and Reprisals, which by either of the Princes before this time haue beene granted, shalbe suspended; and that the same Reprisals shall not heereafter be executed, vntill such time as it shall so be determined by decree of the Councell of the one and other Prince; and that hereaf∣ter no such Letters of Mart or Reprisals
<PB REF="13"/>shall be granted by any of the sayd Prin∣ces, but that the Ambassadour resident in either places shall be first aduertised there∣of. And also after the same haue beene de∣liberatly considered on in the Councell of the Princes from whom they are to be ob∣teined, and confirmed by the Kings Great seale, and together with all other solemni∣ties obserued, which are requisit in such cases.</P>
<P N="22">22 It is agreed further, and accorded, That this Treatie shall alwayes be vnder∣stood according to the proprietie and true signification of the wordes therein con∣teined; and that it shall admit no such interpretation as may in any part let or hinder the force and effect thereof ex∣pressed in the plaine and simple words; but that all subtilitie of vnderstanding, which for the most part subuerteth the true meaning of the parties being taken away, that which in good faith is done and expressed in this Treatie shall fullie
<PB REF="14"/>and sincerely bee accomplished and per∣formed.</P>
<P N="23">23 Last of all, it is agreed and accor∣ded, That this present Treatie shall in all things be firmly and sincerely kept du∣ring the continuance of the League and Amitie betweene the said Princes and their Successors.</P>
<P N="24">24 In all and singuler which Articles before in this Treatie expressed, and be∣tweene vs the forenamed Deputies coue∣nanted and concluded by vertue of our Commissions, and by the authority there∣in to vs giuen, whatsoeuer hath been done, the same wholly shall be vnderstood to be submitted to the will and pleasure of their Maiesties. And wee the Deputies of the French King haue promised, and do pro∣mise, That his Maiestie will ratifie and ap∣proue, and by his authoritie will confirme all and singuler the sayd Articles by Letters patents signed with his hand, and sealed
<PB REF="14"/>with his Great seale; and that the same shall bee verified and approoued in the Courts of his Kingdome, where, and when need shall require: The which Letters of Confirmation and Ratification the sayd French King shall cause to be giuen and deliuered in sufficient and auailable forme, within the space of three moneths from the day of these presents, vnto the Ambas∣sadour of the Kings Maiestie of GREAT BRITAINE, residing with his Christian Maiestie in FRANCE, he hauing suffici∣ent power and authoritie to receiue the same. In like maner, we the aforesaid Am∣bassador and Deputie of the Kings Maiesty of GREAT BRITAINE haue also pro∣mised, and do promise, That whatsoeuer the sayd French King is before bound in this Article to accomplish and performe on his part, the Kings Maiesty of GREAT BRITAINE, &amp;c. will on his part like∣wise do and performe; and will also ratifie and approoue this present Treatie within that same time, and in the same forme and
