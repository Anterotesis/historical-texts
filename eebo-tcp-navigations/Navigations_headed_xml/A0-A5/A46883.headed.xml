<HEAD>A New Letter sent from <HI>Scotland,</HI> concerning the further Proceedings of the <HI>JEWS.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving received a more full account of the pro∣ceedings of the <HI>Jews,</HI> I shall here present you with such <HI>Occurrences,</HI> in this juncture of time, wherein scarce any thing else, is either talkt of, or lookt after, in comparison of them. The whole World we see is out of order, nothing to be expected but Intestine Broils, and whether the Lord will be pleased in the midst of these Combustions to call in his Antient People, and magnifie his Name in them, He onely knoweth. On the 23 of <HI>October,</HI> by the foulnesse of the weather and storms, put into <HI>Aberdeen</HI> a Ship, from whence she came, 'tis uncertain; but the Professour of that City, of the Tongues and Languages, having Notice thereof, went down unto them, and by their Dis∣course perceived they spoke broken <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and bound for <HI>Am∣sterdam,</HI> as was intimated by a Letter in <HI>High-Dutch,</HI> to have Cor∣respondence with their Brethren (the <HI>Jews</HI>) there: Which Letter further relates, That there is Sixteen hundred thousand of them together in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and that there came into <HI>Europe</HI> Six∣ty Thousand more; withall, that they have had many Encoun∣ters with the <HI>Turks,</HI> defeating several Bodies, and killing many Thousands, none being able to stand against them. They give Liberty of <HI>Conscience</HI> to all, except the <HI>Turks,</HI> endeavouring the utter Ruine and Extirpation of them. But for the ship, the Sails thereof are white branched Sattin, and all their Ropes are Silk of the same Colour; and in the Sails was this Inscription in fair Red Characters,</P>
<Q>These are of the Ten Tribes of Israel.</Q>
<P>Which was to discover them to be <HI>Jews:</HI> Their Food on board was onely Rice and Honey: Their Habit [or Cloathing] Black
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> Black and Blew. It seems they have sent to most of the chief Cities in the World to their Brethren, to give them Notice of their Proceedings, to the end they may come and joyn with them. The <HI>Great Turk</HI> having had a <HI>Dream,</HI> that a <HI>Jew</HI> had ta∣ken the Crown from his Head, resolved to put all to death within his Dominions; but his Council disswaded him from that <HI>Bloody Design.</HI> The <HI>Jewish</HI> Host are sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to increase daily, and that many of them believe in the true Messias, and that it was the Saviour of the <HI>World</HI> that was crucified at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce my last of the Proceedings of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> We have had Expresses not onely from <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> but <HI>Tunnis</HI> also; That this Year no Carrivan is to go to <HI>Mecha,</HI> by reason the City is besieged by the <HI>Israelites,</HI> who appear in great Numbers, and are said to be sent by the Ten Tribes to be the Fore-runners:</P>
<P>From <HI>Jerusalem</HI> we have received very good News, and likewise many of our Christian Merchants have received the like from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> The Particulars of which is, that the Bashaw of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> with the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> made use of a Carravan, that is, an Army of Sixty Thousand Men, and marched toward <HI>Mecha,</HI> and being within one days Iourney of the Ci∣tie, sent out a Troop to take notice how things were, which Troop having seen this People lying in Tents about the Citie, and hearing that they profest them∣selves to be <HI>Israelites,</HI> reported this to the Bashaw who for all that resolved to march on with his Forces and coming within sight of the City, discovered an innu∣merable Multitude of People coming out of their
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> Tents. Whereupon the Turks advanced up against them, gave fire, &amp; discharged several Volleys of round shot; but after a little fighting a pannick fear took them and terror seized on them, making them cry out <HI>Who is able to fight with these People, seeing our Arrows and Shot return back upon our selves.</HI> So the Turks lea∣ving off fighting, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturned Home, and the Israelites into their Tents without pursuing them. This Af∣front caused the Bashaw and King of the Moors, tho∣row-out all Egypt and Arabia, to impose on the Iews in all their Dominions a new Tax five times greater then it was before. And the Bashaw, the better to in∣form himself what this People were sent ten Iews to them who found them to be Israelites, and that they spake <HI>Hebrew,</HI> saying, they were sent before to remain at <HI>Meka</HI> till the rest of their Brethren came, for that the time was now come, that they should return unto their own Land of their Fore-Fathers, which others had usurped and taken from them. Another Letter saith, that the Commander of <HI>Meka</HI> sent <HI>4</HI> Troops to oppose them, but not one returned and that divers Ca∣ravans and great Bodies have bin wholly defeated by the said <HI>Israelites;</HI> and that twelve thousand Turks coming from a City called <HI>Metai,</HI> near <HI>Meka</HI> were also routed, and eight thousand slain upon the Place, their own Swords and Muskets turning against themselves. Of the ten Iews that were sent, six re∣mained with their Brethren, and but <HI>4</HI> returned to the Turks. As for the great Prophet in <HI>North-Skilton,</HI> Doctor <HI>Collonest</HI> hath bin at his House in a Town called <HI>Long-Ditch,</HI> where he heard these things out of his own Mouth. That in the Year <HI>1661.</HI> he medita∣ted on the Scriptures speaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter Times;</HI>
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/> of the great Multitude: yet withall heard of other <HI>Jews</HI> that several of them spake the <HI>Holy Tongue;</HI> and that who∣soever goeth to contend with this People in Battel, are presently vanquished, and slein.</P>
<P>They have already possest themselves of several Pla∣ces and Cities, putting all the Inhabitants to the Sword, the <HI>Jews</HI> onely excepted. They are a People of a middle stature, their Bodies comely, their Complexions fair: This Party saw no Woman amongst them, nor any other Arms, besides those above-mentioned; their Horses are many, their Attire blew, and their <HI>Tents</HI> black. From the aforesaid City of <HI>Sus,</HI> the whole Host of them might be plainly and distinctly viewed the whole Week, and might see their Fires and Smoak ascending; but on the Sabbath, neither of both could be discerned throughout the whole Camp, or Host.</P>
<P>Several of them being commanded up to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for a <HI>Brass-Tamber,</HI> or <HI>Trumpet;</HI> and up∣on the finding it, three times to sound it, and then all Na∣tions to be gathered into one Universal Church: their Leader is of an extraordinary discerning Spirit for no soo∣ner doth he see a Man, but he knows his Mind, and the thoughts of his Heart, treating them with very much hu∣mility and respect. And coming to a <HI>River</HI> not Foorda∣ble he consulted with his Officers and unanimously re∣solved to implore the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od by Petition and Prayer, to deliver them as he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne their Fore-Fathers, and to shew them some Mira<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to evence them of the truth of the great Messias born of a Virgin, to be the Saviour of the World: whereupon, so great and wonderful a Work was wrought, that the great Waters immediatly divided, as soon as they had ended Prayers, and the whole Army in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cked over even as it were upon dry Land.</P>
