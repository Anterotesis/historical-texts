<HEAD>A GREAT VICTORY obtained by Sir <HI>William Bruertons</HI> For∣ces, against the Westmerland Forces, at <HI>Malpesse</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> August 26. 1644.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T hath pleased God to give us a fur∣ther victorie against the Enemie, by a small handfull of Sir <HI>William Bruertons</HI> Forces; On Saterday last, being the 24. of August, 1644. there came a Trumpeter from the Enemie hither to <HI>Nantwich,</HI> Sir <HI>William Bruerton</HI> being then here in the Town: which Trumpeter coming to our Court of guard, and there it being demanded of him whither he went, and from whence he came: told the Of∣ficer that he came from Prince <HI>Ruperts</HI> Forces, and had been Trumpeter to him, and was come to submit to the Parliament; and had a businesse of consequence to declare to the Governor; and accordingly he was brought to Sir <HI>William Bruerton.</HI></P>
<P>And he declared unto Sir <HI>William Bruerton,</HI> that a party of the Westmerland forces were marched with Collonel <HI>Baynes,</HI> Collonel <HI>Conniers,</HI> Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> the Princes Troop, and others, towards Chester by Malpesse, about 1000 men in all, to joyn with Prince <HI>Puperts</HI> forces there; whereupon Sir <HI>William Bruerton</HI> sent out Scouts, and entertained this Trumpeter, and as you shall under∣stond found this Relation true.</P>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>So Sir <HI>William Brue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron</HI> called a Councell of Warre to consider upon this businesse, and it was agreed, that what horse and foot could be drawn forth, should pre∣sently be sent towards the Enemie; for the most of the horse were at that present out upon another designe: and accordingly 8 Troops of Horse, and 7 Colours of Foot Companies were drawn out on Sonday the 25 of Aug. at night, and the Horse carried each of them a Musketeir behind them, and marched towards Malpesse: and on Monday morning at break of day, when they came with in 2. miles of Malpesse or thereabout, our foot alighted, and our Horse drew themselves into a bodie, and march∣ed in batalia before the Foot.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Enemie having intelligence here∣of, sent out a forlorn-hope: but our Horse wheeling a∣bout, appeared not on that side of the Town which they expected; who discovering them, endeavoured to get be∣tween the town and them, which they did: and falling upon them, killed, and took them all, and had their arms and pillage.</P>
<P>Then our horse gave them an Alarm in the Town: whereupon the Enemie issued out, and marched against ours. Then Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Iones,</HI> and Captain <HI>Zan∣chy</HI> led on Sir <HI>William Bruertons</HI> own Troops upon the forlorn hope, who charged the Enemie gallantly, and with great courage drew on the rest. The Enemie came upon them first with 2. or 3. Charges, and indeed fought furiously; &amp; Sir <HI>Williams</HI> horse made good their ground in despight of the Enemie. In which Collonel <HI>Iones</HI> was so valiant, that he was shot in the thigh, and his horse shot under him, and had like to have been taken, but that <HI>George Parker,</HI> servant to Sir <HI>William Bruerton</HI> did valiant∣ly fetch him off; and Captain <HI>Zanchy</HI> had his horse shot under him: the Enemies losse we beleeve was great.</P>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>Then the Enemy sent out a party to ambuskado the hedges, on both sides the forlorne hope: which being discovered, Captaine <HI>Zanchy</HI> all this while making good a Lane, which hee held very advantageous, did hereupon leave the lane and made way for the rest of our Forces to march up in a full body▪</P>
<P>Then the Enemy appeared in 5 severall Brigads, who being ex∣treamly vext that they had bin so baffled with such a small party, their Command marched up against us with a great deale of fiercenesse, but few of them returned backe againe; for we kil∣led, tooke, and totally routed them, as you may see by this inclo∣sed list which I hrve sent you of the particulars thereof, we have taken Prisoners Serjeant Major <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who Commanded as Maior the Duke of <HI>Yorkes</HI> Regiment of Horse, and also Serieant Maior <HI>Maxie</HI> of Sir <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> his Regiment, we have also taken Serieant Maior <HI>Crathorne</HI> of Collonel <HI>Ferhars</HI> Regiment, and Captain <HI>Thomas Clavering</HI> brother to Coll: <HI>Clavering</HI> of the North, who is dead at <HI>Kendall,</HI> Captain <HI>Barker,</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Mountain,</HI> and other Officers besides about 20 other Prisoners, and two of the Maiors, and Lieutenant <HI>Mountain,</HI> are wounded, Collonel <HI>Baines</HI> and Coll: <HI>Conyers</HI> are both slaine, and also Ser∣jeant Maior <HI>Heskey,</HI> and one of their Lieutenant Collonels, and some 40 Gentlemen and other under Officers, and betweene 30 or 40 common Souldiers; and we heare by one that is come from <HI>Chester,</HI> that one Serieant Maior that was slaine is brought to <HI>Chester</HI> to be buried, &amp; that Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> is there wounded with a shot in the back very dangerously, and also that Captain <HI>Harris</HI> is brought thither wounded, and divers others; and we heare that there are two other Serjant Majors of theirs flame, but that I cannot affirme, we have taken many Armes that were scattered up and down by the Enemy, and gained all the pillage in the field, to God be the praise.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>VVilliam Brereton</HI> had provided us more horse if we had had need which came up that very night, but God be thanked we had no need of them, for God was pleased to give us this happy Victory before they came up to us.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> wee heare is gone over the Forrest of <HI>Deane,</HI> and so to <HI>Bristoll,</HI> where no doubt Sir <HI>Iohn Winter</HI> will doe him the best assistance he can, and we heare that 2000 <HI>Welch</HI> are following of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> but of these these things we shall heare more hereafter. In the meane time I cannot omit to declare the valour not onely of Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Iones</HI> and Captaine <HI>Zanchy</HI> as be∣fore, but also how Captaine <HI>Church,</HI> and Captain <HI>Finch,</HI> behaved themselves very gallantly in this Fight, and in∣deed generally all our Forces to God be the praise who so blessed them, that with the said 8. Troopes of Horse, and 7 Companies of Foot, did kill, take, and rout 1000 of the Enemies, and they had a good mind to have fol∣lowed them, but that it was too dangerous an attempt with so few Horse to straggle from our Foot, who in this businesse did very good service, in all this we had but one slaine, and the Enemy took not one Prsoner of our men.</P>
<P>We heare that Sir <HI>Iohn Meldrum</HI> still proves Victori∣ous in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and hath againe taken 140 horse and their riders; and that <HI>Liver-poole</HI> is now closely beseid∣ged, and the Town being summoned, the <HI>Lancoshire</HI> for∣ces before it had a very great expectation that it would be presently surrendred, but it fell out otherwise, for the Malignants of the Town, with the Governour and Officers perswaded the people to beleeve that there were 2. Ships with souldiers from <HI>Ireland</HI> comming thither, who would certainly be there in few days to strengthen the Town, and so for present they stand out, but are closely beseiged; and it is hoped will be forced in short time to yeeld. Sir <HI>William Brereton,</HI> our Generall his care in this and all o∣ther businesse is exceedingg great, and with good discreti∣on and judgement. He is to to call a Councell of Warre, and you will shortly heare further, if god be pleased to
<PB REF="4"/>blesse us, as he hath done wonderfully already, even above our expectation, to him be the praise.</P>
