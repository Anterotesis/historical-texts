<HEAD>PROPOSASLS BY THE PROPRIETORS OF East-Jersey IN AMERICA, For BUILDING of a TOWN ON <HI>Ambo-Point.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FOrasmuch as <HI>Ambo-point</HI> is a Sweet, Wholsom and delightful Place, proper for <HI>Trade,</HI> by reason of its Commodious Scituation upon a safe <HI>Har∣bour;</HI> being likewise accommodated with a <HI>Navi∣gable River,</HI> and fresh Water; and hath by many Persons of the greatest Experience and best Judgment, been ap∣proved
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> for the goodness of the <HI>Air, Soyl,</HI> and <HI>Scitua∣tion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We</HI> the <HI>Proprietors</HI> propose, by the help of <HI>Almighty God,</HI> with all convenient speed, to build a Convenient <HI>Cown</HI> for <HI>Merchandize, Trade</HI> and <HI>Fishery</HI> on <HI>Ambo-point.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>And because Persons, that hath a desire to <HI>Plant</HI> there, may not be disappointed for want of <HI>Proposals, We</HI> the <HI>Proprietors</HI> offer these following:</HEAD>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We intend to divide Fifteen Hundred Acres of <HI>Land</HI> upon <HI>Ambo-point</HI> into One hundred and fifty Lots, which Lots shall consist of Ten Acres the Lot. One hundred of the Lots we are willing to sell here, and fifty we reserve for such as are in <HI>America,</HI> and have long desired to setle there.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The price of each Lot will be Fifteen pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> to such who Purchase before the 25 of <HI>December,</HI> 1682. And to such who Purchase afterwards, before the 25 of <HI>December,</HI> 1683. Twenty pounds <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Every Lot, is to be as equally divided as the goodness of the Place doth require, and the <HI>Scituation</HI> can admit.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The most Convenient Spot of Ground for a <HI>Town,</HI> shall be divided in One hundred and fifty Equal Shares, and Set out into Streets, according to Rules of <HI>Art;</HI> and no Person shall be preferred before another in Choice, whether <HI>Purchaser</HI> or <HI>Proprietor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> We reserve Four Acres for a <HI>Market-place, Town-House,</HI> &amp;c. and three Acres for Publique <HI>Whar∣fage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Each <HI>Purchaser</HI> is obliged to Build a <HI>Dwel∣ling-House</HI> in the Place designed for the Town, and to Clear Three Acres of <HI>Vp-land</HI> in three Years, or else the <HI>Proprietors</HI> to be Re-instated in such Lots wherein default is made, repaying the Purchase Money.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> We the <HI>Proprietors</HI> do within a Year hope, by God's Assistance, to Build for each of us one <HI>House</HI> upon <HI>Ambo-point,</HI> which we intend shall stand in an Orderly manner, according to the best and most Convenient <HI>Model.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>And in pursuance of the Design of the <HI>Propo∣sitions</HI> abovesaid.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> ANd for the Encouragement of <HI>Carpenters, Joyners, Brick</HI> and <HI>Tyle-makers, Brick-layers, Masons, Sawyers,</HI> and <HI>Labourers</HI> of all sorts, who are wil∣ling to go and employ themselves and Servants in helping to Clear Ground, and Build Houses upon the General Ac∣count of and for the <HI>Proprietors.</HI></P>
<P>The said <HI>Proprietors</HI> will engage to find them Work, and Currant Pay for the same in Money or Clothes, and Provision, of which there is Plenty (as <HI>Beef, Pork, Corn,</HI> &amp;c.) according to the Market-price at <HI>New-York,</HI> during the space of one Year, at least, next after the 25 of <HI>December,</HI> 1682. in which time (through God's blessing and their Industry) they may have got wherewith to buy <HI>Cows, Horses, Hoggs,</HI> and other <HI>Goods</HI> to Stock that <HI>Land</HI> which (they) in the mean time may take up according to the Concessions. Neither shall such Persons pay Rent for their said <HI>Land,</HI> so long as they are Employed in the <HI>Proprietors</HI> Work; and their <HI>Wages</HI> shall at all times be so much as other such <HI>Artificers</HI> and <HI>Labourers</HI> in the said <HI>Province</HI> usually have; nor shall they be obliged to <HI>Work</HI> for the <HI>Proprietors</HI> longer than they find encouragement so to do.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> And for the more ready and certain Employing those <HI>Work-men</HI> and <HI>Labourers,</HI> that shall Transport them∣selves to <HI>East-Iersey,</HI> This is to let all <HI>Labourers</HI> and <HI>Persons,</HI> that shall Transport themselves, <HI>Know,</HI> They must
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> upon their Arrival upon that Place, repair to the <HI>Register</HI> of the abovesaid <HI>Province,</HI> and Enter themselves accord∣ing to their respective Qualities and Designs; and thereupon they shall be entertained into the <HI>Service</HI> and <HI>Pay</HI> of the Proprietors.</P>

<HEAD>FOR DISPOSITION OF LAND IN <HI>East-Iersey.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Governour</HI> of <HI>East-Iersey,</HI> by and with the Advice of his <HI>Council,</HI> is to direct, That all <HI>Lands</HI> to be Set and laid out for <HI>Counties, Tribes, Cities,</HI> or <HI>Parishes,</HI> according to the <HI>General Concessions</HI> of the said <HI>Province,</HI> be bounded and Set out in manner following, <HI>Viz.</HI> That all such <HI>Lands</HI> be divided into Seven equal Lots or Parts; one of which seven Parts, is to be first Set out by Lot for the use of the <HI>Proprietors;</HI> and the other Six Parts to be taken up according to the following <HI>Concessions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Planting of the said <HI>Province</HI> may be the more effectually promoted, <HI>We</HI> do hereby grant unto all Persons who shall Transport themselves, their Wives or Children, into <HI>East-Iersey,</HI> and setle there ac∣cording to the following Concessions, by the Twenty
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> fifth of <HI>December,</HI> 1684. Twenty five Acres of <HI>Land</HI> for each <HI>Head,</HI> whether Wife, Child or Servant shall be bound to serve the Term of three Years, at the least, within the said <HI>Province;</HI> and for every such Master of a Family fifty Acres. The said Persons so <HI>Imported</HI> are to be <HI>Registred</HI> in the <HI>Secretaries Book of Entries,</HI> to be kept for that Pur∣pose; and the <HI>Importer</HI> to pay to the <HI>Secretary</HI> for Fees of attending that <HI>Service</HI> and <HI>Entring</HI> them 12 <HI>d.</HI> each Head. And each Servant, Male or Female, who shall be so <HI>Imported</HI> and <HI>Registred</HI> by the Twenty fifth of <HI>December,</HI> 1684. shall at the expiration of their Time, have liberty to take up the quantity of Thirty Acres for their own uses. And all the aforesaid <HI>Importers,</HI> and Persons <HI>Imported,</HI> who are here∣by allowed to take up <HI>Land,</HI> shall have and enjoy the same under the Terms and Concessions following:</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> For as much as this <HI>Province</HI> is already consi∣derably <HI>Peopled</HI> and <HI>Improved</HI> (there being seven <HI>Towns</HI> at least already setled upon it by <HI>English <HI>People</HI></HI>) and that no Person is constrain'd by our <HI>Concessions,</HI> to take up and pay for <HI>Land</HI> which is <HI>Barren</HI> and unprofitable; nor can it be reasonably supposed, that <HI>people</HI> should in this <HI>Province</HI> be now exposed to the like <HI>hazards</HI> and <HI>difficulties</HI> that others must look to meet with in those <HI>Plantations</HI> that are less <HI>In∣habited</HI> and more remote, and for <HI>Scituation</HI> by <HI>Sea</HI> and <HI>Land,</HI> not so commodiously placed for <HI>Trade;</HI> Therefore we think it very reasonable and moderate, that all and every Person and Persons shall have his and their respective quanti∣ties of <HI>Land,</HI> set out at Two pence an Acre yearly Rent, to be paid into our <HI>Receivers Office,</HI> either in Money <HI>Ster∣ling,</HI> or in such <HI>Commodities</HI> as the Growth or Trade of the <HI>Province</HI> offords at the Merchants price there. But who∣soever is willing to buy off his yearly Rent, and become a <HI>Free-holder,</HI> may so do, paying after the rate of Twelve years Purchase, which comes to 50 <HI>s.</HI> for a Lot of Twenty five Acres; and so paying after the same rate for a greater or lesser quantity.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> And for as much as it will be most commodious for <HI>Planters</HI> to live together, whereby they may be a meet help to each other. It is Ordered that all the Purchasers and Takers up of <HI>Land,</HI> shall sit down by some <HI>Villiage</HI> or <HI>Township,</HI> already laid out or to be laid out hereafter in the said Province; and having chosen the <HI>Village</HI> or <HI>Township</HI> which shall be most convenient and profitable for their Bu∣siness, the <HI>Surveyor General</HI> shall set forth to the said Per∣sons such quantity of <HI>Lands,</HI> to them Granted, out of the aforesaid Six Parts which are not then taken up, they paying to the said <HI>Surveyor General,</HI> the usual rate of Surveying in the said <HI>Province.</HI> And if any Person going or sending over; is willing to have a greater Parcel of <HI>Land</HI> than 25 Acres, he may Purchase, but not more than 1000 Acres, he paying down, at the Sealing of his Grant, for the same after the rate of Ten pounds by the hundred Acres; and so more or less for a greater or lesser quantity.</P>
<P N="4">4. And if any Person is willing to buy <HI>Land,</HI> and yet for the present is not disposed to Plant there, he may so do, paying down here for his Grant to the <HI>Proprietors,</HI> ac∣cording to the rate aforesaid.</P>
<Q>Provided, That all those <HI>Persons,</HI> who by these <HI>Concessions,</HI> shall take up <HI>Land</HI> be enjoyn'd to Build one <HI>Dwelling-House</HI> on some part of their <HI>Land,</HI> within the space of seven. Years next after the <HI>25</HI> of <HI>December, 1682.</HI> And in case of Default, one half of their <HI>Land</HI> to return back to the <HI>Proprietors.</HI></Q>
