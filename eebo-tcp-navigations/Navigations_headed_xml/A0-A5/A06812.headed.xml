In the whiche londe it l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed hym to take flesshe &amp; blood of the virgyne Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y / and to enuyron that londe with his owne feet. And the re he wolde do many myracles / and preche &amp; teche the fayth &amp; the lawe of vs crysten men as vnto his childern. And therfore he wolde suffre many repro ues &amp; scornes for vs. And he that was kyng of he∣uen / &amp; of erthe / of ayer / of see / and of all thynges that are conteyned in them wolde all oonly be cal∣led kyng of that londe whan he sayd. Rex sū iu∣deo{rum}. I am kyng of Iewes. For that tyme was that londe of Iewes / &amp; that londe had he chosen before all other londes as for the best &amp; the moost vertu∣ous &amp; for the moost worthyest of the worlde. And as the phylosophre sayth thus. Virtus re{rum} in medio consistit. That is to saye / vertue of thynges is in

the myddes / &amp; in that londe he wolde lede his lyf and suffre passyon &amp; deth of the Iewes for vs and for to delyuer &amp; bye vs fro the paynes of helle / &amp; fro deth withouten ende / the whiche was ordeyned to vs for the synne of our fader Adam / &amp; for our owne synnes also. For as hymself he had none e∣uyll deserued / for he thought neuer euyll / ne dyde neuer euyll. And he that was kyng of glorye and Ioye myght best in that place suffre deth. For he y<SUP>•</SUP> wyll do ony thynge that he wyll be knowen open ly. He wyll do crye it openly in the myddell place of a towne / or of a cyte / so that it may be knowen to all partyes of the cyte. So he that was kyng of all the worlde wolde suffre deth for vs at Ierusa∣lem / that is in myddes of the worlde / so y<SUP>t</SUP> it myght be knowen to men of all partyes of y<SUP>e</SUP> worlde how dere he bought man that he had made to his ow∣ne lykenesse for the grete loue that he had to vs / for more worthyer catell ne myght he haue set for vs than his owne blessyd body &amp; his owne precyo{us} blood / y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche he suffred for vs. A dere god what loue he had to his subgettts.

For the whiche euery good crysten man y<SUP>t</SUP> may &amp; hath wherof sholde strength hym for to conquere our ryght herytage &amp; chace out the euyll peoples handes / for we are called cry sten men of Cryste our fader.

But now pryde / couetyse / &amp; en∣uye hath so enflāmed the hertes of lordes of y<SUP>e</SUP> worl de that they are more besy for to dysheryte theyr neyghbours than for to chalenge or conquere theyr ryght herytage before sayd. And the comon people that wolde put theyr bodyes &amp; catell for to conque re our herytage / they may not do without lordes / for assemblynge of the people without a chyef lor∣de is as a flocke of sheep that hath no sheepherde the whiche departe asondre / &amp; wote neuer wheder that they sholde go. But wolde god that the worl∣dly lordes were at good accorde / and with other of theyr comon people wolde take this holy vyage o∣uer the see.

and beholde many tymes that of Parys &amp; that of Constantynople / for they were bothe of one made of Ionkes of the see / but men haue departed them in two pyeces / the whiche one parte is at Parys / &amp; that other parte at Constantynople. And I haue one poynt therof that semeth a whyte thorne and that was gyuen to me for a grete frendshyd / for there is many of theym broken and fallen in the vessell whan they shewe the crowne to grete men or lordes that come thyder. And ye shall vnderstan de that our lorde in that nyght that he was taken he was ledde in to a gardeyne / and there he was examyned sharpely / and there the Iewes scorned hym and made hym a crowne of braunches of al∣bespyne that grewe in the same gardeyne / &amp; sette it on his heed so fast that the blood ranne downe by many places of his vysage and his necke and his sholders / and therfore hath the albespyne ma∣ny vertues / for he that bereth a braunche of it vp∣on hym / no thonder / ne no maner tempest may de re hym / ne none house that it is in may none euyll ghoost come in no place there it is. And in that sa me gardeyne saynt Peter denyed our lorde thryes. Afterwarde was our lorde ledde before the bys∣shop and the mynystres of the lawe in an other gardeyne of Anne / and there he was examyned also and scorned / and after agayne with a whyte thorne that men calle barbarens that grewe in to the same gardeyne / and that hath as many ver∣tues.

And afterwarde he was ledde in to a gardey ne of Cayphas and he was crowned agayn with Englentyre / and after he was ledde in to a cham∣bre of Pylatus and there he was examyned and crowned / and the Iewes sette hym in a chayre and cladde hym in a mantell / and than made they a crowne of Ionkes of the see / and they kneled vn∣to hym sayenge.

And the crowne of the whiche that one half is at Parys / and that other half at Constantynople the whiche Cryste had vpon his heed whan he was done on the crosse and therfore men shall worshyp that moost and holde it more worthyer than ony of the other. And that spere shaf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hath the Emperour of Almay∣ne / but the heed of yron whiche was put in his sy∣de is at Parys. And many tymes sayth the Empe rour of Constantynople y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath the spere heed. And I haue often seen it but it is gretter than y<SUP>•</SUP> of Parys. Also at Constantynople lyeth saynt Anne our ladyes moder whom saynt Eleyne made bryn ge from Ierusalem.
