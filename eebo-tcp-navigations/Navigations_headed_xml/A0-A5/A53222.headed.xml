Sabin, who records an edition of Obilby as bearing date of 1670, says: "This English translation is, like Dapper's 'an impudent plagiarism' from Montanus, plates included." In the text many changes and additions were made by Ogilby, and his maps of Maryland, Jamaica and Barbados are not found in Montanus. The general map of America in Ogilby also differs materially from that in the Dutch work.</NOTE><NOTE>Reproduction of original in Huntington Library.</NOTE></NOTESSTMT></BIBLFULL></SOURCEDESC></FILEDESC><ENCODINGDESC><PROJECTDESC><P>Header created with script mrcb2eeboutf.xsl on 2016-01-29.</P></PROJECTDESC><EDITORIALDECL N="4"><P>Manually keyed and coded text linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</P><P>Issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</P><P>Keying and markup guidelines available at TCP web site (http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/)</P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE ID="eng"><LANGUAGE>eng</LANGUAGE></LANGUSAGE><TEXTCLASS><KEYWORDS><TERM TYPE="topical term">Voyages and travels.</TERM><TERM TYPE="geographic name">America --  Discovery and exploration.</TERM><TERM TYPE="geographic name">America --  History --  To 1810.</TERM></KEYWORDS></TEXTCLASS></PROFILEDESC><REVISIONDESC><CHANGE><DATE>2010-05</DATE><RESPSTMT><RESP>TCP</RESP></RESPSTMT><ITEM>Assigned for keying and markup</ITEM></CHANGE><CHANGE><DATE>2010-06</DATE><RESPSTMT><RESP>SPi Global</RESP></RESPSTMT><ITEM>Keyed and coded from ProQuest page images</ITEM></CHANGE><CHANGE><DATE>2010-07</DATE><RESPSTMT><RESP>John Pas</RESP></RESPSTMT><ITEM>Sampled and proofread</ITEM></CHANGE><CHANGE><DATE>2010-07</DATE><RESPSTMT><RESP>John Pas</RESP></RESPSTMT><ITEM>Text and markup reviewed and edited</ITEM></CHANGE><CHANGE><DATE>2011-06</DATE><RESPSTMT><RESP>pfs</RESP></RESPSTMT><ITEM>Batch review (QC) and XML conversion</ITEM></CHANGE></REVISIONDESC></HEADER>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Ocean▪</NOTE><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Sea, that takes several Denominations from the Countreys which it washeth, and surrounding the dry Land, cuts out, and shapes so many winding Bays, Creeks, and Meandring In-lets, seems no where so much confin'd and penn'd into so narrow a Channel, as the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellan:</HI> From whence again, soon expatiating, it spreads it self into two immense, and almost boundless Oceans, that which opens to the North, gives terminaries to the four Regions of the Earth; that to the South, onely to <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> both which, indeed, are but one continu'd Sea, extending it self round the Universal Globe.</P>
<P>This watry part of the World, that almost through all Ages lay Fallow, hath in these later times been Furrow'd by several Expert and Stout Captains, who now by their Art and Industry, have given a good Account of, and made clear Discoveries from East to West, where-ever the Sun rises or sets.</P>
<P>The Northern Bounds under the <HI>Artick-Zone,</HI> have been hitherto so ob∣structed with Ice, that the undertakings of such as adventur'd either to find by the North-East or North-West a Passage to <HI>India,</HI> have been utterly frustrate. Of the Southern, no such pains hath as yet been taken in the Disco∣very, so that for the most part it is yet unknown how far the Water, either deep or shallow, overspreads the Earth, onely thus much Experience hath made out, that the <HI>Antartick</HI> needs lesser Line to Fathom, than the <HI>Artick-Ocean.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ancients had little knowledge in Navigation.</NOTE>The antient <HI>Greeks, Phenicians,</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> or whosoever that were Renown'd by Antiquity, and Listed in the number of their famous Navigators, were no less Timerous than Ignorant concerning Maritim Affairs, and are not fit to stand in the least degree of competition with our later Voyagers.</P>

<P>Of old, by an inviolable Law, made by Custom, according to <HI>Pliny, Vigetius</HI> and others, the Sea was lock'd up, from the eleventh of <HI>October,</HI> to the tenth of <HI>March,</HI> no Ships daring to venture forth, dreading short Nights, and foul Wea∣ther; neither in Summer, did they so much as once offer, unless driven by Storms, to attempt the <HI>Offin,</HI> or loose sight of Land; yet there is no question, but that several Nations in former Ages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Navigation is very an∣cient.</NOTE> made it their business, spending their whole time, and wearying themselves in the Practical Art of Navigation.</P>
<P>The Sacred Scripture testifies, That the Kings of <HI>Judea, Solomon, Jehosaphat, Ozias,</HI> and others, prepar'd several Fleets that Sail'd through remote Seas, freighting themselves with Gold from <HI>Ophir,</HI> and other Rarities, which were Imported to supply and enrich the <HI>Holy-Land.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Geograph.</HI> lib. 1.</NOTE> And <HI>Strabo</HI> also tells us, That King <HI>Solomon</HI> being contemporary with <HI>Homer,</HI> then discover'd <HI>India.</HI> And <HI>Pliny</HI> relates, That the <HI>Romans,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Augustus,</HI> passing the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and sleighting the <HI>Ne plus ultra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist.

<P>Moreover, it deserves special observation, That an antient <HI>Swedish</HI> King, as <HI>Cornelius Nepos</HI> relates, sent as a Rarity and great Present to the <HI>Roman</HI> Consul <HI>Metellus Celer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Voyage of some <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> some <HI>Indians,</HI> who loosing their course, hatter'd up and down with perpetual Storms and stress of Weather, were at last driven into the Nor∣thern Ocean, where they suffer'd Shipwrack; yet saving themselves, Landed on his Coast:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Menelaus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Aristonicus Gramaticus</HI> relates, That <HI>Menelaus</HI> Sailing from the <HI>Sack</HI> of <HI>Troy,</HI> became so great a Voyager, that leaving the <HI>Straights,</HI> he surrounded <HI>Africa,</HI> and discovering <HI>India,</HI> after eight years re-measuring the same way he went, return'd with great Riches in safety to his own Kingdom: Which is consentaneous to <HI>Homer,</HI> who saith, <HI>Odyss,</HI> l. 4.</P>

<P>That which the <HI>Grecian</HI> Geographers relate concerning <HI>Ptolomy Euergetes,</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> is not to be forgotten, That sending Pilots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable Voyage of an <HI>Indian</HI> into <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> Commission'd to take the Soundings, and settle the Land-marks in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph, they found by chance a forsaken Vessel, onely in it one Man half dead, lying among several other breathless Bodies, of whom, being refresh'd with conve∣nient Cordials, they enquir'd his Fortune, but he being unable to give them any present satisfaction, neither understanding what the other said, they sent him to the Court, where soon having got a smattering of Greek, he inform'd <HI>Euergetes,</HI> that he was a Native <HI>Indian,</HI> driven from their course into the place where they found him by stress of Weather, and that his company were famish'd, all their Provision spent in their Wandrings from their intended Voyage; Thus being kindly entertain'd, he also promis'd the King to open his Passage (if so he pleas'd) into <HI>India.</HI> The King slept not upon this Intelligence, but immediately prepar'd a Fleet Freighted with such Commodities as were advis'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Ptolomy</HI> into <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> with which setting forth by the Conduct of this their <HI>Indian</HI> Pilot, they Anchor'd in their desir'd Port, and brought the King in return from thence a rich <HI>Cargo</HI> of Silk, Spices, costly Drugs, and precious Gems. <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> about sixty years after, intending not to lose the advantages reap'd by the former discoveries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And also of <HI>Cleopatra;</HI></NOTE> equipp'd another and greater Navy; which passing through the Red-Sea, found the Stern of a Ship, on which was Presented a Horse, whereby some of the more knowing Sea-men judg'd, that it had been a <HI>Gibraltar</HI> Vessel, and Sailing about <HI>Africa,</HI> there by sad accident suffer'd a Wrack. This Stern was afterwards set up, and fix'd as a Memorial in the Market-place of <HI>Memphis.</HI></P>
<P>In these later times, the first that endeavor'd to drive an <HI>European</HI> Trade in <HI>Africk,</HI> and held Commerce with <HI>India,</HI> was the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> who Sail'd from thence through the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> into the <HI>Mediterranean-Sea:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Venetians</HI> were the first that drove a trade from <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></NOTE> So Steering for <HI>Alexandria,</HI> where unlading their Goods, from thence they carry'd them over Land, and Shipping again in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph, Sail'd directly for <HI>India.</HI> Thus by Land and Water, were exchang'd several Commodities, and the <HI>Indian</HI> Growth and rich Products of the Oriental World plentifully Transported to <HI>Venice,</HI> and from thence, all <HI>Europe</HI> had ample Accommo∣dation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they went their journeys.</NOTE> until an <HI>Egyptian Sultan</HI> suffer'd the Way to be infested by Thieves and Murdering Robbers, that so they were enforc'd to remove thence, and Dischage their several Cargoes at <HI>Aleppo;</HI> from whence, on Mules and Camels, they carry'd their Goods to <HI>Babylon,</HI> so to <HI>Balsarum,</HI> and then to <HI>Ormus,</HI> where they Re-ship'd thence, directly standing for <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they enjoy'd the benefit of so great a Trade and Commerce, until the <HI>Portuguese</HI> found a Passage by, Sea, saving the Expence and trouble of carrying Goods so far by Land to <HI>India;</HI> Of which here we will a little inlarge.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">By what means the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> came first to disco∣ver the Coasts of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>India.</HI></NOTE><HI>John,</HI> the first King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who took from the <HI>Moors,</HI> by force of Arms, <HI>Septa,</HI> an <HI>African</HI> City, having five Sons; <HI>Henry</HI> his fourth behav'd himself so gallantly in the Leaguer of <HI>Septa,</HI> that after he became Master of the place, this Prince made many bold Excursions in several Parties against the Ene∣my, bringing in daily great store of Booty; so growing rich, he Rigg'd out two new Vessels to make farther Discoveries along the Coast of <HI>Africa.</HI> Yet this his Expedition went on but slowly, being much taken off in Building there a new City, then call'd <HI>Tarzanabala,</HI> and since <HI>Villa Infantis;</HI> but being Admonish'd by a Dream, and Check'd for his laying thus aside his first De∣sign of Navigation; he soon after, <HI>Anno</HI> 1410. set forth the Ships that he inten∣ded, which he the more accelerated, being inform'd by some of his Prisoners
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>Natives, that <HI>Africa</HI> spread from the Basis of <HI>Mount-Atlas,</HI> very far towards the South:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why <HI>Africa</HI> was no fur∣ther discover'd.</NOTE> This Mountain then was the Terminary of Navigation that way, because thereabouts a long Ridge or Shelf of Sands thrust its Point under Shallow Waters so far out into the Ocean, that none durst venture to Sail in∣to the <HI>Offin,</HI> being out of sight of Land to double this conceal'd <HI>Cape.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who first ventur'd into the <HI>Offin.</HI></NOTE>The first that attempted to find Deep Water, and get round about, dis∣covering several unknown Coasts, and Uninhabited Isles belonging to that Region, were <HI>Joannes Gonsalves, Tristan Varseus,</HI> and <HI>Aegidius Annius;</HI> amongst which were the <HI>Madera's,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Madera's</HI> by whom peo∣pled.</NOTE> and <HI>St. George de Picho,</HI> which Prince <HI>Henry</HI> first Planted with <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and others since with <HI>Netherlanders.</HI> He also obtain'd a Grant from Pope <HI>Martin</HI> the Fifth, of all the discover'd Territories East-ward from the <HI>Canaries,</HI> for ever to be the undoubted Right, and belonging to the Crown of <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>Henry</HI>'s Decease, <HI>Anno</HI> 1460. the business of Navigation and Discove∣ries of new Countreys, lay neglected, because King <HI>Alphonso</HI> turmoyl'd in a Civil War, his Crown being at stake, had not leisure to think or look after uncertain improvements by Sea; yet at last having quell'd his Enemies, he ventur'd forth some Ships, who Sail'd as far as the River <HI>Zenaga,</HI> and came to Anchor before the City of <HI>Genny,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">By whom <HI>Genny</HI> was dis∣cover'd</NOTE> famous since for Trade, which gave its de∣nomination to the Countrey and Coasts of <HI>Guiny,</HI> where they dealing, Barter'd for Ivory, Gold, Slaves, and also got so much footing into the Countrey, that they suddenly rais'd up a Fort, and Man'd it with a strong Garrison, Shipping their Slaves for <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John</HI> the Second succeeding his Father <HI>Alphonso,</HI> had a great design upon <HI>Ara∣bia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> and if possible, was ambitious to open a Passage from the <HI>Atlan∣tick,</HI> to the <HI>Oriental-Seas.</HI> But the difficulty lay in Steering so often from sight of Land, venturing into the Main Ocean, obstructed by so many dangerous Shoals that lay so far out into the <HI>Offin.</HI></P>
<P>At that time flourish'd three famous Mathematician, <HI>Rhoderick, Joseph,</HI> and <HI>Mar∣tin Bohemus,</HI> Pupils bred up by <HI>Joannes Monteregius;</HI> with which the King consulting, perswaded, that they would by their Art invent some Instrument, that by Southern Constellation, the Pole being depress'd, the Navigator might know where he was, and in what height. so guessing what distance they were from this or that Countrey; they accordingly Club'd Learning, and by their great Study, found out what since hath prov'd so useful and beneficial to Sea∣men, the <HI>Astrolabe;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">For the Northern Con∣stellation the <HI>Astrolabe</HI> was in use long before.</NOTE> which help having obtain'd, the Sailers encourag'd, more frequently ventur'd into remote and unknown Seas.</P>
<P>After these, King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Portugal</HI> sent <HI>Jaques Cano</HI> with a Fleet, who Sailing, found the River <HI>Zaires,</HI> where he erected a Pillar with an Inscription, <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Portuguese,</HI> signifying by whom, and in what Kings Reign these <HI>African</HI> Coasts were discover'd: Here he also met some of the Natives, who more civiliz'd than the rest, told him, That they had a mighty King, who Raigning over them, kept his Court some few days Journey up in the Countrey, to whom <HI>Cano</HI> sending his Agents, detain'd four <HI>Africans</HI> as Pledges, which he carry'd with their free consent to <HI>Portugal,</HI> promising to bring them back in fifteen Months, who before that time having got some smatterings of their Tongue, inform'd them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable passage of <HI>Jaques Cano.</HI></NOTE> that their Native Soyl was call'd <HI>Congo,</HI> whither returning by the appointed time, they were according to their agreement, exchang'd for the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Cano</HI> address'd himself with rich Presents to their King, whom he found sitting in their manner on an Ivory Throne, being from the middle up∣ward

After this, many of that Na∣tion became Christians, and the King himself receiv'd Baptism. But in short time, by the Instigations of their Diabolical Priests, and others, Christiani∣ty loosing ground, grew out of countenance: Mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> the Second, seek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to discover <HI>India</HI> by water,</NOTE> King <HI>John</HI> the Second vigorously Prosecuted the business of Discovery, sending <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> by Land from <HI>Alexandria</HI> and other parts of <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>India,</HI> and from thence to explore the Coasts on the Eastern side of <HI>Africa,</HI> to the <HI>Great-Cape;</HI> if so a way might be found fit for Navigators, having doubled that Point, to Traffick with the Oriental parts of the World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vasque de Gama <HI>his ex∣pedition,</HI></NOTE>After this Princes Death the Work lay still a while, but in short time, King <HI>Emanuel</HI> his Successor freshly undertook the business once more, sending <HI>Vasques Gama</HI> with four Ships, who passing through many Dangers with great Difficult∣ties, Anchor'd at last before <HI>Calecut,</HI> and was the first of the <HI>Europeans</HI> that found a way to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A query, if <HI>America</HI> was known to the Ancients.</NOTE>Here it will not seem amiss, having prov'd that <HI>Africa</HI> was more than Coasted by the Ancients, to ingage and search with some scrutiny, concern∣ing this <HI>America;</HI> First, Whether at any time 'twas known by the Anci∣ents? And next, by what People, and when first Inhabited? About the former, the Learned of these later times Jangle amongst themselves, for some of them will needs ascribe so much Honor to Antiquity, declining the Worthy Praise of those that made so wonderful a Discovery, as if they of old, and many Ages before, had done the same, or at least, that this New-World to them was not unknown, maintaining this their bold Assertion from the Au∣thority of what they find, both in Ancient <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Authors: First, especially in the Learned <HI>Plato,</HI> who, as you know at large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atlantica. Plato in Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; Timaeo,</NOTE> describes a New <HI>Atlantis,</HI> lying beyond the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> whose Coast is surrounded with two vast Seas that are Sow'd thick with scatter'd Islands. By these Seas they understand the Atlantick and Southern-Sea, by the many Isles, <HI>Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, California,</HI> and others, which lie sprinkled along the Coasts of <HI>America.</HI> But it cannot be made out, that <HI>Plato</HI> describes ought but a Fancy, his own <HI>Idea,</HI> not a Countrey that ever was, is, or shall be, though he sets it forth so Ac∣curately, and with such Judgment, as if he had taken a Survey of the place, and found such a Land indeed.</P>
<P>In like manner, <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> undertakes to prove,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diod. Sic.</HI> lib. 6.</NOTE> That <HI>America</HI> Was known to the Antients; telling a Story, how the <HI>Phenicians</HI> were driven by a Storm
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>from the Coasts of <HI>Africa</HI> West-ward, falling at last upon a great and altoge∣ther unknown Island, which our late Expositors take for <HI>America;</HI> Must it therefore be so? Surely not, for it is onely a bare Story, without any Proof or the least Testimony.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. de Mirandis in Na∣tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> auditis.</NOTE> They endeavor to make <HI>Aristotle</HI> bolster up their opinion that he had a knowledge of this New-World, which with no small pains they pump from these Words: <Q>Beyond the <HI>Herculean</HI> Pillars, certain <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Merchants penetrated the Atlantick Ocean so far, that at last they found a vast, yet un-inhabited Island, producing nothing but Herbage, Plants, and Wild-Beasts, yet interlac'd with many Meandring Rivers, abounding with several sorts of Fish, lying some days Sail from the Continent; they Landing, found a Soyl so fertile, and Air so temperate, that there they setled, and were the first Planters of that Isle. But the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> having intelligence thereof, Prohibited all Persons whatsoever, upon Pain of Death, to go thither, fear∣ing the place being so much commended, all the People would be ready to flock thither, and desert their own, and so utterly unfurnish and debili∣tate their then growing Common-wealth.</Q></P>
<P>But how could the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> find <HI>America,</HI> without the use of the Com∣pass? How happen'd it, that they were so taken with the fertility of this their New-found-Land, when the Adjacent Countreys and Fields about <HI>Carthage</HI> are every where Flourishing, and most Luxurious? So that it may better be sup∣pos'd, that what <HI>Aristotle</HI> found so long since, may rather be the <HI>Canary-Isles,</HI> or <HI>Great-Brittain,</HI> than <HI>America.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> having then also made some Inspection into the <HI>Brittish-Isles.</HI> They would also make you believe, that <HI>Virgil</HI> the Prince of Latin Poets,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aeneid.</HI> lib. 6.</NOTE> had known the New-World in these Verses; <HI>Aeneid.</HI> lib. 6.</P>

Though we cannot deny that the Antient Sages and Wise Philosophers of former times might easily make out, and no question did, that the Earth and Sea made the perfect Figure of a Globe; first from the round Shadow of the Earth that Ecclipses the Moon; the diffe∣rent Risings and Settings of the Celestial Luminaries; and the still Variati∣on of the Pole; so that the Earth and Sea making one Ball, they might easily conjecture, that the South-side of the Equinoctial might be Inhabited as well as the North: But all this was more grounded upon Natural Reason and Right Judgement, than any Experience of theirs, or the least certain know∣ledge thereof, which since these later times had the first happiness to obtain; so laying these Conjectures aside, there have been none more grosly erroneous, and so utterly mistaken in this Point, than some of the Ancients, and especi∣ally the Fathers of the Church.</P>

And what then becomes of Sacred Scripture, which says positively, <HI>That all Men were deriv'd from</HI> Adam, <HI>and after the Floud, from</HI> Noah <HI>and his three Sons?</HI> Therefore the Nations of the <HI>Antipodes</HI> must be of another Abstract, there being no possi∣bility (as they suppos'd) of passing from this World to that: But since the Dis∣covery of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies,</HI> Experience, the best Mistress, hath taught, that in the South are mighty Lands and vast Territories, and that as far as they have been Penetrated, are found to be full of People, extending their Domi∣nions from East to West.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marcob. in Somnio Scipio∣nis. <HI>l. 2. c. 5.</HI> Vide Carpent. Geograph.</NOTE>With <HI>Virgil, Pliny,</HI> and the Prince of Latin Orators agree, who saith,
<Q>You see, that those that inhabit the Earth dwell in Countreys so separated one from another, that it is impossible they should have any Commerce; some of them are our <HI>Antipodes,</HI> walking with their Heads downwards, some their Feet against our sides, others, as we, with their Heads upright. You see how the same Earth seems to be Swath'd about with Rolls, of which, two separated by the other three, are at utmost distance one from the other, ly∣ing equi-distant under the Vertick Points of Heaven, always cover'd with Snow and Ice; but the middlemost and greatest is scorch'd by the violent
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>heats of the Sun: Two Tracts are Habitable, one to the South, our Antipo∣des, the other North, which we Inhabit.</Q></P>
<P>And <HI>Pliny</HI> also affirms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pliny</HI> lib. 2.</NOTE> though against the Vulgar Opinion, this truth,
<Q>That the Earth is round about inhabited, and that people walk Foot to Foot in most parts thereof; though every one be ready to ask why our <HI>Antipodes</HI> drop not into the Sky; which question, our <HI>Antipodes</HI> may also ask concerning us.</Q></P>
<P>But although the Ancients upon these and the like Demonstrations well un∣derstood, that there was a Habitable World towards the South under our <HI>Ho∣rizon,</HI> yet they could not make out or believe, that there was any possibility to pass thither; And, according as St. <HI>Austin</HI> conceiv'd, That the Earth produc'd nothing under either Pole, by reason of excessive cold, and that the <HI>Equinoxs</HI> or <HI>Middle-Zone,</HI> was not to be penetrated, because of the insufferable heat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. in Somno Scip. <HI>lib. 2.</HI></NOTE>And <HI>Macrobius</HI> saith, <Q>That the <HI>Equinoctial Circle,</HI> the <HI>Artick</HI> and <HI>Antartick Lines,</HI> bind the two Habitable <HI>Zones,</HI> and make Temperate by the excessive Neigh∣boring Heats and Colds; and these Countreys onely give Animation, and comfortable Enjoyment to all Living Creatures.</Q></P>
<P>Moreover, St. <HI>Austin</HI> in some places seems to clear his own Doubts, saying,

This puzzle putting St. <HI>Au∣stin</HI> to a stand, he had no other means to get off, but by saying, that by God's Commands or Permission, the Angels convey'd them thither; If so, why might not God please to Plant Men there in like manner, and the rather, the Earth be∣ing created for Humane use?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Austin</HI> is contradicted.</NOTE> But what needed this, when Men can in Ships Transport themselves, either of their own accord for curious Inquest, to find new Countreys, or else enforc'd by stress of Weather, to far remoter, and alto∣gether unknown Lands:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How men came to new Countreys.</NOTE> Besides, though the Earth is here and there divided by large Bays and vast Seas, yet nevertheless, in other places it is all continu'd Land, or at least parted by some narrow In-let or Sea; so that there was no difficulty for a crouded Plantation to go over, and so ease themselves in an∣other Countrey, till then not Inhabited; therefore none need to question, but that from <HI>Adam,</HI> or nearer, from <HI>Noah's</HI> three Sons, <HI>Sem, Ham,</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> those, as well as we, were extracted, that Inhabit this our other World.</P>

<P>And farther East, <HI>Asia</HI> was at the same time little better, still trembling at the daily Alarms and Incursions of the <HI>Scythians, Persians,</HI> and <HI>Saracens;</HI> and afterwards the <HI>Turks</HI> growing upon them more than any of the former, expect∣ed no other than a sad Gatastrophe, so that the known World had too much
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>work cut out for them by these Distractions and Alterations of Government, then to go in Quest of uncertainties, to find they know not where, another.</P>
<P>Here also is added by St. <HI>Jerom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieron. in c. <HI>2.</HI> Ephes.</NOTE> what an antient Writer saith, <HI>Great care hath been taken in Computing the Age of this World, and if there be another which Commenc'd not with ours,</HI> (as <HI>Clemens</HI> mentions in his Epistles) <HI>where are scituate those Seas and Lands that make that second World?

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Antients opinion of an unknown world.</NOTE>But <HI>Pliny, Cicero,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> the best in their kind of Latin Writers, concur, That there may be a habitable World under our <HI>Horizon,</HI> in the temperate Southern <HI>Zone,</HI> beyond the extream heat, and on this side of the <HI>Antartick</HI> colds.</P>
<P>But what signifies all this to the Discovery of <HI>America,</HI> which lies not onely under the scorching Heats of the <HI>Equinox,</HI> but under the Frosts and Snows of the <HI>Artick</HI> and <HI>Antartick-Poles?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Comment. super</HI> Obad. v. 19, 20, 21.

<P>If <HI>America</HI> is known in the Scripture.</P></NOTE> Yet less probable is that which <HI>Lodowick Leo,</HI> an <HI>Augustine</HI> Frier takes out of <HI>Obadiah;</HI> as if that Prophet in the three last Verses of his <HI>Prophecy</HI> should speak of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which should not onely discover and Conquer <HI>America,</HI> but also Convert the Inhabitants to the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> because those that are in <HI>Sepharad,</HI> should Inherit and Possess the Cities of the South, <HI>And Saviours shall arise from the Mountains of</HI> Zion, <HI>to judge the Mount and Wealth of</HI> Esau.</P>
<P>But certainly, <HI>Obadiah</HI> meant no other than the Restauration of the <HI>Jews</HI> from the Captivity of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who after their return, should grow more powerful than ever, and they, led by their <HI>Messias,</HI> obtain the height of all felicity, who would send his <HI>Evangelists</HI> and <HI>Apostles</HI> to declare Salvation to the utmost Bor∣ders of the Earth.

<P>And lastly, It signifies as little what <HI>Pineda</HI> and <HI>Levinus Lemnius</HI> drive at, That <HI>Solomon</HI> first finding the use of the Compass,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Solomon</HI>'s Fleet sail'd not to <HI>Peru.</HI></NOTE> Rigg'd a Navy at <HI>Ezion-Geber,</HI> which from the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> had no indirect Course to the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellan;</HI> from whence he might Lade his Vessels with the Gold of <HI>Peru.</HI> In whose De∣scription it shall be manifested, that <HI>Peru</HI> is not <HI>Ophir,</HI> as some without any shew of Reason or Truth would make us believe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Solomon</HI> did not find the Compass.</NOTE>But as concerning King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s finding out the use of the <HI>Magnet,</HI> it is soon said, but not easily prov'd; for though that Prince exceeded all Man-kind in Wisdom and Learning, and was perfect in the Operations, and knew the Occultest Secrets of Nature, understanding what e're belong'd to Plants, from the Cedar of <HI>Libanus,</HI> to Hysop, and the meanest Shrub that grows upon the Wall; yet it nothing makes out, that he knew the Mystery of the Navigable use of the <HI>Load-Stone:</HI> But suppose he did know, there is no where any mention of it; and if this excellent thing, the <HI>Compass,</HI> had been found in <HI>Solomon</HI>'s time, how came it afterwards so utterly to be lost?</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The original of the <HI>Ame∣ricans</HI> much disputed on.</NOTE>ABout the Original of the <HI>Americans,</HI> the Learned Dispute so much, that they find nothing more difficult in Story, than to clear that Point; for whether inquiry be made after the time, when the <HI>Ameri∣cans</HI> first settled themselves where they now inhabit, or after what manner they came thither, either by Shipping or by Land; on purpose, or accidental∣ly; driven by Storm, or else forc'd by a more powerful People, to remove
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>from their old Plantations, and seek for new? or if any one should be yet more curious, asking the way that directed them out of another Countrey to this New World? or else enquire for those People, from whom the <HI>Americans</HI> deriv'd themselves? He will find several Opinions, and the Learned still Jangling.</P>
<P>The first Doubt is concerning the time:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voyagel <HI>l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 8.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Purchas,</HI> where-ever he had the Hint, endeavors to prove, that <HI>America</HI> hath been but lately Planted; for which he thus argues,</P>
<Q><P>That if <HI>Asia,</HI> or <HI>Europe</HI> furnish'd <HI>America</HI> with People in <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>'s time, or at least before the Birth of our Saviour; then it must upon necessity, by the Expiration of so many Ages, have been much more Popu∣lous, then the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found when first they discover'd it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time when <HI>America</HI> was first Peopled.</NOTE> Besides the vast Territories yet unhabited (says he) are sufficient testimonies, that this New World hath been Planted but scatteringly, and not many Ages since, else the Countrey would have more abounded with Inhabitants, because the fer∣tility of the Soyl was able plentifully to maintain Millions more, then were there when first discover'd: And what Marks are better to know a new Peo∣ple by, in any Countrey, than a rude Life and unsettled Government? just like a Family removing to another House, which takes no short time to settle their Goods and Houshold-stuff in a handsome and convenient Order.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The condition of the first World after the Floud.</NOTE>When <HI>Noah</HI> went out of the Ark on Mount <HI>Ararat,</HI> and not long after, saw his Seed spread over <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Assyria,</HI> the new Generation of People con∣sisted in Shepherds and Husbandmen, that setled themselves near Lakes and Rivers. Villages, Cities (and much less) whole Kingdoms, were scarce found on the Face of the Earth, and as little of Trade or Commerce; Riches, Division of Lands, costly Garments and Furniture for Houses, were not then in use, but the works of long settlements in happy Peace. To curb growing-Wickedness, and the Pride of <HI>Libertines,</HI> who incroach'd upon their weaker Neighbors, Laws were invented, by which Bridle, the unbroke or wild World grew tamer: And first, the <HI>Assyrians</HI> were brought to endure the Bit, and answer the Reins of Government; then <HI>Egypt,</HI> next <HI>Greece,</HI> and after that the <HI>Romans,</HI> who spreading their Power by Arms and Martial Discipline, first civiliz'd the <HI>Gauls, Spain, Brittain,</HI> and lastly <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>But because a Countrey or Pastoral Life, knowing no Commerce, but mean Hovels, and to dwell in Huts, priding in poor and no Habits, despising all greatness, unlimited by Laws, and all things else, (which the People observ'd presently after the Flood) is now found among the <HI>Americans,</HI> who will take them for ought else, but new Comers to that Land, as themselves acknow∣ledge? For the <HI>Mexicans</HI> boast, that they are the eldest there, and that from them, <HI>Peru, Chili, Chika,</HI> and other Countreys towards the South, had their Colonies, and yet the oldest Chronicles of <HI>Mexico</HI> reckon not above a thou∣sand Years.</P></Q>
<P>Thus far Mr. <HI>Purchas.</HI></P>
<P>But certainly, all this Muster of appearing Reasons, is not able, to van∣quish single Truth; For, grant that <HI>America</HI> was not very Populous when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> first arrived there;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>America</HI> was Peopled ma∣ny Ages ago.</NOTE> must this needs prove, that it was never well in∣habited before? Perhaps the Civil Wars, which have been always destructive to this Nation, have much hindred the increase of People; and the more, be∣cause their Salvage Nature is such, that in several places they account Man's Flesh Broil'd a very great Dainty.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Purchas</HI> contradicted</NOTE> And suppose such Prodigal Excess of their Humane Bankets were not us'd in <HI>America,</HI> as indeed they are, Is it wonder, that such a great part of the World, not onely exceeding <HI>Europe</HI> in bigness, but <HI>Asia</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>also should here and there have a Tract of Land uninhabited? These might by reason of their Barrenness, be useless, as many such places are found in the midst of the most Populous and fertile Countreys. But above all this, it is cer∣tain, that <HI>America</HI> to this day (notwithstanding almost innumerable thousands of <HI>Indians</HI> formerly Slain arid Massacred by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) is so well in∣habited, that it may stand in Competition with either <HI>Asia</HI> or <HI>Europe.</HI> And how could such vast multitudes Plant the far-spreading Countrey of <HI>America,</HI> without the help of many Ages? Moreover, This truth is not without suffici∣ent Testimonies; when any one looks on the Islands with which <HI>America</HI> lies incompass'd, he may suppose they did not willingly go from the Main Con∣tinent to the Isles, but were driven thither by Wars among themselves, or as most times it happens, because of the vast increase of the Natives, the Coun∣trey must discharge its burden.</P>
<P>Hereto is added, the several Languages us'd in <HI>America,</HI> as in <HI>Europe</HI> or any other part of the known World; whereby we may easily guess, that <HI>America</HI> was Peopled presently after the Confusion of Tongues at <HI>Babel.</HI> Furthermore, If the <HI>Americans</HI> live a Rude Life, go meanly Habited, be without stately Houses; such Customs are even among us observ'd by several People; as the <HI>Tartars, Numidians,</HI> and others, which made their Antiquity be call'd in question. He also must needs have no knowledge of the Arts and Mechanick Sciences us'd by the <HI>Americans,</HI> who concludes, that they setled but lately in <HI>America.</HI> One Ar∣gument at present will be sufficient to contradict them all; and in the further Description, the contrary will be more manifest.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>American</HI> Gold-Smiths.</NOTE><HI>Hieronimus Benso</HI> relates, That he stood amaz'd at the Gold and Silver Smiths in the Territory of <HI>Chito,</HI> who without any Iron Tools made Images, and all manner of Vessels: Which work they performed thus, First, they made an Oval Crucible of a good Look, round about Pasted with Earth, embody'd with the Powder of Wood Coals; which Crucible being Bak'd very hard in the Sun, they fill with Pieces of Gold or Silver, and put in the Fire; about which standing with five, six, or more Pipes made of Canes, they blow the Fire so long, till the Mettal melts, which others sitting on the ground, run it into Moulds of black Stone, and so with little trouble, Cast into what shape they please. Lastly, Though <HI>Mexico</HI> can reckon but a thousand years, must it therefore fol∣low, that the Inhabitants are no older? How many famous places (even among our selves) have no longer Registers, and if they have, they are common∣ly Fabulous, few Nations boasting truly their own Original; which Argu∣ment, not onely contradicts (as we suppose) Mr. <HI>Purchas,</HI> but all others ascri∣bing the Plantation of <HI>America</HI> to our later times.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">After what manner the Inhabitants of <HI>America</HI> came thither.</NOTE>¶ IN the next place, let us enquire, how the <HI>Americans</HI> were transmitted thi∣ther, whether by Sea, or Land? Both which are feasible two several ways; if they made an Expedition thither, as Discoverers, or were driven on those Coasts by stress of Weather.</P>
<P>The first is most unlikely, and not seeming possible, for how could they Steer thorow so vast an Ocean, to Countreys they never heard of, without the Compass, and other Necessaries for such a Voyage? for when first discover'd, their want of experience in Shipping for so long a Voyage, knowing no fur∣ther than the use of small Boats or <HI>Canoos,</HI> plainly explode, that they willingly

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Steer'd from a known World, to an unknown, with no better accommodati∣on; but some probable reasons may be made out, to induce us to believe, that they were rather driven thither by Storm.</P>
<P>But some will say, How liv'd the little Boats, and how indur'd they in such a continual Tempest, and were not either swallow'd up amidst the Waves, or starv'd for want of Provision, which their hollow Troughs could not con∣tain?</P>
<P>The first doubt is the least, for there are Examples enough by which appear, that oftentimes great Ships Bulging, are over-set or sunk in the Sea by foul Wea∣ther when the Mariners escape in their Cock-Boat; and if they were but thin∣ly Victual'd for so long a Voyage, questionless, that little which they had, they spun out, and made it last, while the impetuous Storm shortned the passage, which fair Weather would have made much longer.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> tells us of <HI>Annius Plocquius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin</HI> l. 5. <HI>c.</HI> 22.</NOTE> General of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> That one of his Slaves being Enfranchiz'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange voyage of a <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Slave.</NOTE> Sailing down towards the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulf, was car∣ry'd by a violent Tempest from the North, beyond <HI>Caramania,</HI> and on the fif∣teenth day came to an Anchor in <HI>Hippuros,</HI> a Haven of <HI>Taprobane,</HI> which <HI>Ortelius</HI> judges to be <HI>Sumatra;</HI> but <HI>Mercator</HI> and <HI>Cluverius,</HI> on better grounds, <HI>Zeylon,</HI> which is no less than three thousand <HI>English</HI> Miles.</P>
<P>In like manner, <HI>Joseph de Acosta tells</HI> us, That in fifteen days time, he got with a Northerly Wind from the <HI>Canaries</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> and his Voyage had been shorter, durst he have born more Sails, which may partly clear the former doubts.</P>

<L>I went in order, Sir, to your Command,</L>

<L>Where, for a while, my Eyes no Object met,</L>
<L>But distant Skies, that in the Ocean set:</L>
<L>And low-hung Clouds that dipt themselves in Rain</L>
<L>To shake their Fleeces on the Earth again.</L>
<L>At last, as far as I could cast my Eyes</L>

<L>The Object I could first distinctly view,</L>

<P>But the resolving these Doubts, starts a harder Question, <HI>viz.</HI> Grant that the <HI>Americans</HI> were by Tempest driven thither, How then came the Beasts thither? It is certain, that those which are beneficial for humane use, as Dogs for to Hunt, great Cattel, Sheep, for Food, and other Necessaries, might easily be car∣ry'd thither, for so the <HI>Spaniards</HI> brought Cows, Horses, Swine, and other Cat∣tel;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spaniards</HI> carry Oxen, and Sheep to the <HI>American</HI> Isles.</NOTE> and also Poultery from <HI>Spain,</HI> to the new-discover'd Isles, <HI>Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Margaretta,</HI> and <HI>La Dominica,</HI> when at their arrival, formerly no four-footed Beasts were found there, whose fertile Soyl hath so multiply'd their increase, that the Doggs running Wilde, and breeding as fast, do great hurt to the Grazing Herds, which they onely shoot for their Skins, leaving their Flesh, the best of Meats, onely to Manure the Ground on which they lie.</P>
<P>The Transporting of tame and profitable Cattel might easily be allow'd of, but who would load their Ships with Lions, Tygers, Bears, Wolves, Foxes, and other Serpents and Voracious Beasts? it is certain that some may be tam'd before they were Ship'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How wild Beasts came in <HI>America,</HI> and the Isles. <HI>In vita Heliogabali.</HI></NOTE><HI>Lampridius</HI> relates, That <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, took great pleasure in Domestick Lions, and Leopards, to frighten his Guests withal; for with the third Course, they were all brought in, and sate betwixt the Invited, a Man

But notwithstanding some wilde Beasts seem to forget their Voracious Nature, yet there ought great care to be taken in the Trans∣porting of them, because they oftentimes grow wild again, which <HI>France</HI> can witness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange accident of two Leopards.</NOTE> where two Leopards, a Male and a Female being tam'd, presently after the death of King <HI>Francis,</HI> whether negligently or on purpose, let loose, ran into the Woods, and near <HI>Orleans</HI> devour'd a great number of People, and Cattel: <HI>Gesner</HI> saith, That some Womens bodies were found, who were un∣touch'd, onely their Breasts eaten by the Leopards, as if they took them for the daintiest part; which is not unlike the antient, <HI>Jeres,</HI> who according to Saint <HI>Hierom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Adv Jovin.</HI> l. 2.</NOTE> entertain'd their Guests as a most delicious Dish, with Womens Breasts, and Mens Buttocks Roasted.

And how came Serpents, Adders, and other Re∣ptiles, thither over the Ocean, that with no Art whatsoever can be made tame? Were the small Vessels just laden with such terrible Creatures, when against their wills, they were by Storm driven on a new Coast? By these im∣possibilities we may easily judge, that the <HI>Americans</HI> came thither by Land, and no other way, but how, and upon what occasion must be our next enquiry.</P>

<P>Thus the banish'd <HI>Japanners</HI> forsook their Native Countrey, and setled them∣selves in a desolate Soyl, since a flourishing Empire, shining with Riches, and Crown'd with stately Cities: So the <HI>Batavians</HI> took possession of the uninhabi∣ted Isle, lying between the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> and the <HI>Wael,</HI> being driven out of <HI>Hessen</HI> by Civil-Wars, and preserv'd the memory of the place, from whence they had their Original on the utmost Point of the Island, in the Villages of <HI>Cattenwyck;</HI> for the <HI>Hessens</HI> formerly went by the name of <HI>Catti;</HI> others that remov'd did not onely fall upon their Neighbors, but made a way by force of Arms, cho∣sing their Habitations under a temperate Climate, and in a fruitful Soyl. Af∣ter which manner the <HI>Franks</HI> enter'd <HI>Gaul,</HI> and afterwards the <HI>Normans</HI> set upon <HI>France;</HI> so that the Conquer'd Countreys, have ever since from the Conque∣rors been call'd <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Normandy:</HI> But although it cannot punctually be said, how the Inhabitants of <HI>America</HI> remov'd, yet it is without contradiction, that they first found an empty Countrey.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Flood acknowledg'd by the <HI>Americans</HI> and other <HI>Heathens</HI> but mysteriously.</NOTE> The Opinions which they have themselves concerning it, are full of idle Fancies. First, they question their Original from the Floud, which is so well rooted in the memory of all Nati∣ons, that the blindest and most ignorant know something of it, though de∣formedly alter'd and vary'd, tack'd up with additional fabulous Stories, the truth it self known onely to us, but to all others lost in Oblivion.</P>

<P>Who hath not heard of <HI>Deucalion</HI>'s Flood, how his Wife <HI>Pyrrha</HI> and he only escap'd in a little Boat, and (as 'tis Fabl'd) landing on a Mountain, from thence Peopled the World again, by throwing Stones backwards over their Heads? Something of this seems to hint the true Story of <HI>Noah,</HI> his Wife, and Children, from whom the desolated World was replenish'd.</P>
<P>The same they relate of <HI>Prometheus,</HI> concerning whom, thus <HI>Diodorus Sicu∣lus:</HI> <Q>They say that the <HI>Nyle</HI> breaking through his Dams, and over-flowing his Banks, drown'd all <HI>Egypt,</HI> especially that part where <HI>Prometheus</HI> Rul'd, where all the Inhabitants were swallow'd by the Deluge.</Q> None can ima∣gine but that <HI>Diodorus</HI> by this makes mention of a particular Flood, and not the general one in <HI>Noah</HI>'s time; for as the <HI>Greeks</HI> ascrib'd all things to their <HI>Heroes,</HI> so the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in like manner did the same to <HI>theirs:</HI> Therefore they have of the general Flood, made a particular one in <HI>Egypt,</HI> though perhaps it never was: So that what is Fabled of <HI>Prometheus,</HI> is nothing but a Part of the Universal Deluge; which the Name <HI>Prometheus</HI> proves, because it signifies,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prometheus</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> are the same.</NOTE> <HI>Sprung from Heaven,</HI> and is the same with <HI>Noah,</HI> whom they hold to be the first Father of all Mankind since the Flood, born of, or regenerated from his Wife <HI>Asia;</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> signifies <HI>Earth,</HI> or <HI>The Mother of all things;</HI> and so espousing <HI>Noah,</HI> being sprung from God, to <HI>Ararat,</HI> from whence descended the Generations of Mankind, and by degrees spread over the whole surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses, East-Indians, Japanners,</HI> and other People of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> have also some knowledge of a very ancient Flood; but hood-wink't under many idle Fancies, not unlike that which the <HI>Americans</HI> relate, from whom several Learned Persons find no obscure Confessions of the Deluge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acosta,</HI> l. 1. c. 25.</NOTE> which thus my∣stically they have wrapp'd up, That one <HI>Viracocha</HI> came out of the great Lake <HI>Titicaca,</HI> and setled his Residence upon <HI>Tiaguanaco,</HI> where yet remain the Ruines of ancient Walls, built after a wonderful manner: At length removing from <HI>Tiaguanaco</HI> to <HI>Cusco,</HI> he began to multiply the Generation of Mankind. They shew in the foremention'd Lake a small Island, under which, the <HI>Americans</HI> say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Opinion of the <HI>Americans</HI> concerning the Flood.</NOTE> the Sun sav'd himself from the Flood; wherefore in ancient Times they su∣perstitiously observ'd that place, heightning their Bloody Sacrifices with Hu∣mane Slaughter. Others relate, That six Persons leap'd through a Hole out of a Window, from whence all Men were since Extracted; and from that new Increase, the place (after the Inhabitants of the Old World were all drown'd) got the Denomination of <HI>Pacari Tampo;</HI> and therefore they hold the <HI>Tampo</HI>'s to be the most ancient Families: From hence <HI>Mangocapam</HI> deriv'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original of the <HI>American</HI> Kings, and the Custom.</NOTE> being the Pri∣mogenitor of the <HI>Ynca's</HI> or Kings; from whom sprung two Generations, <HI>Hanon Cuzco,</HI> and <HI>Urim Cuzco.</HI> They tell us also, That their <HI>Ynca's,</HI> when they make War upon any People, say that the occasion, as they pretend, was, because all Ter∣ritories are Tributary to them justly, from whom they were deriv'd and re∣stor'd, being the first Planters of the New World; and withal, That the true Religion was declar'd to them from Heaven.</P>
<P>This Relation, though mix'd with Fables, shews (but very darkly) that they have some knowledge of the Flood:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Americans</HI> Flood is ta∣ken out of the Scripture.</NOTE> For who are those six else that leap'd out of a Window to replenish the Generations of Mankind, but <HI>Shem, Ham,</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> with their Wives?</P>
<P>The <HI>Americans</HI> can give but a little better Account of their first Original; and indeed it is no wonder, because for want of Books they can relate nothing certain, but only what they have Registred in their usual <HI>Quipocamagos,</HI> which is not above four hundred years old. <HI>Acosta</HI> asking what Original they judg'd

<P>None can disown, but that the <HI>Phenicians</HI> have every where been Admirals of the Sea; so that they were formidable to the greatest Princes.

<P>But to return to our Discourse, and disprove the former Testimony, That the <HI>Phenicians</HI> found <HI>America.</HI> The formention'd <HI>Comtaeus</HI> saith thus; <Q>None

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hanno</HI>'s Return.</NOTE>Here <HI>Hanno</HI> stopp'd his Voyage, being hindred from going further for want of Provision.

<P>This the most remarkable Voyage which hapned in the time of the Anci∣ents, considering they wanted several Mathematical Instruments belonging to Navigation, and especially the use of the Compass; and also considering the length of the Voyage to <HI>Sierra Liona,</HI> whither never any durst venture before: Nay, in so many Ages after <HI>Hanno,</HI> the famousest Navigators which were set out by the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> fear'd a long time to cut their Passage through the
<PB N="21" REF="18"/><HI>Aequinoctial-Line;</HI> however in long Process of time, divers Experiments were made, which have now so much improv'd the Art of Navigation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Testimony that <HI>America</HI> was not known to the An∣cients.</NOTE><HI>Hanno</HI>'s Voyage was four hundred years before the Birth of our Savior; therefore if none have been further than <HI>Hanno,</HI> until the time the <HI>Portuguese</HI> sail'd beyond <HI>Cape de Bona Esperana,</HI> how could <HI>America</HI> be discover'd by Sea? How did they steer from the Salt-Islands, or <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> out of sight of Land, through the Main Ocean, to an unknown World? <HI>Hanno</HI> himself, who was the stoutest of all Ancient Navigators, not only crept along the <HI>African</HI> Coast, which made him spend so much time; but not daring to cross over those wide spreading Bays he found, left not his hold of the Shore, and measur'd and search'd every winding Inlet and Creek: And if he found a New World, why was it not known? The more; because his Ambition carry'd him on to get a Name and Reputation by such Naval Discoveries. And how true the Relati∣on of this Expedition is, <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us, saying, The Journal-Books were then to be seen which <HI>Hanno</HI> writ in that his <HI>African</HI> Expedition: Though many of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and also of our Moderns, following <HI>Hanno,</HI> have found several things contrary to his Observations, wherein he makes mention of several Cities built by him, which none ever since heard of, or any have seen, neither is there the least Marks of their Ruines to be found.</P>
<P>This large Relation serves for nothing else, but to shew that they seek in vain herein to give the Honor of the Discovery of <HI>America</HI> to the Ancients; And as little do those Testimonies signifie that are taken out of <HI>Diodorus Sicu∣lus, Pliny, Pomponius Mela,</HI> and <HI>Aelian.</HI> It will be worth our time to hear every one of them particularly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 7:
<P>Second Testimony, that <HI>Americans</HI> are deriv'd from the <HI>Phenicians.</HI></P></NOTE>First, <HI>Diodorus</HI> saith, <Q>Beyond <HI>Lybia,</HI> in the Ocean, lies a very great Island, several days sailing in Circumference, having a very fruitful Soil, and pleasant Meadows, distinguish'd by Hills, and moistned by Navigable Ri∣vers, unknown in Ancient Times, because it seems to be separated from the other World, and was thus found: The <HI>Phenicians</HI> sailing along the <HI>Lybian</HI> Coast, were several days and nights toss'd with perpetual Tempests, and at last driven to the foremention'd Island, where Anchoring, and observing the pleasant Scituation thereof, made it known to their Magistrates.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is contradicted.</NOTE>But how comes this nameless Island to be <HI>America?</HI> What Man would take that for an Island, which far exceeds the main Continent of <HI>Asia?</HI> And have the <HI>Phenicians</HI> ascrib'd the finding of this New World to any? Whence then proceeds such great silence amongst all the Ancient Writers of a whole World, who otherwise us'd to give Denominations to the least remote Village, or Mountain, or River?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 1. Description of <HI>Atlas.</HI></NOTE><HI>Pliny</HI> speaks after the same manner, saying, <Q>The Writers make mention, that <HI>Atlas</HI> rises out of the middle of the Sands, with a Shrubby and Bushy top towards the Sky, on the Shore of the Ocean to which he gives his Denomi∣nation; That it is full of Woods, and water'd by several Fountains on that side towards <HI>Africa,</HI> by which means it bears all manner of Fruit. In the Day-time none of the Inhabitants appear, all things being in silence, as in the middle of a Desart; the Approacher is struck with sudden amazement. And besides its excessive high Crown, reaching above the Clouds, and neigh∣boring, as they say, the Circle of the Moon appears in the Night as if it were all in a Flame, resounding far and near with Pipes, Trumpets, and Cym∣bals; and the Journey up thither, very long and dangerous.</Q></P>
<P>I cannot understand that <HI>Pliny</HI> can mean <HI>America</HI> by this, because himself, in
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>the first Division of his Fifth Book, makes his beginning with the Descripti∣on of <HI>Africa:</HI> And as to what further concerns the strange Relation and dan∣ger thereof, is a little before related in <HI>Hanno</HI>'s Voyage; and it is but a slight Argument to prove it <HI>America,</HI> because it seems to resound with those sorts of Instruments which the <HI>Americans</HI> were observ'd to use when discover'd.</P>
<P><HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> being the third,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> hath no greater Arguments than the former. <Q>We hear (says he) that utmost People towards the West,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Men.</NOTE> being the <HI>Atlanticans,</HI> are rather half Beasts than Men, cloven-footed, without Heads, their Faces upon their Breasts, and naked, with one great Foot, like Satyrs or Goblins, which range up and down, without any Artificial Shelters or Houses.</Q></P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 18.</NOTE> <HI>Aelian</HI> seems to say something, when he sets down the Discourse be∣tween <HI>Midas</HI> and <HI>Silenus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discourse between <HI>Mi∣das</HI> and <HI>Silenus</HI> concerning the Unknown World.</NOTE> out of <HI>Theopompus,</HI> where <HI>Silenus</HI> relates, <Q>That <HI>Eu∣rope, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Lybia</HI> are Islands; and that a vast Countrey lyes beyond this his tripple-divided World, mighty Populous, and abounding with all other Living Creatures, as big again as ours, and living twice as long: That they are wondrous rich; their Religions, Laws, and Customs, founded upon another Morality and Reason, quite different from ours. They boast espe∣cially of two great Cities, <HI>Machimus</HI> and <HI>Eusebes;</HI> the Inhabitants of the first maintaining themselves by driving altogether a Trade of War, mustering up, and filling their numerous Regiments with several valiant Nations. The Listed Citizens amount in their Muster-Rolls, all bred to Soldiery, to two Millions, of whom few but scorn either dying bravely by Wounds receiv'd with Flint-edg'd Laths, and Staves, in stead of Spears, pointed with Stones, not knowing the use of Iron or Steel, but so over-stock'd with Gold and Silver, that they account it a Drug of less Value than our basest Metal. Some Years since they march'd into our World, a hundred thousand strong, as far as the <HI>Hyperborean</HI> Mountains, where being inform'd, that all the Na∣tions of our World, compar'd with them, liv'd in a poor and despicable condition; as not thinking them worth their Conquest, they return'd. But the second City <HI>Eusebes,</HI> deals altogether in Peace, and its Citizens are not ra∣pacious, but exercise Justice, so much affecting Morality and Divine Wor∣ship, that they conquer Heaven by their Piety and Meekness; and the Gods themselves are pleas'd to descend, and advise with them concerning their Celestial Affairs.</Q></P>
<P>Who observes not this to be a Poetical Relation, shewing how much better the Acquirements of Peace are, than those of War; the one conquering only Men, the other, the Gods? Nor can more be taken out of <HI>Aelian</HI>'s Discourse, but that the Ancients believ'd there was another Habitable World to be our <HI>Antipodes.</HI></P>
<P>Thus far hath been disputed concerning the Original of the <HI>Americans,</HI> whose Plantations from <HI>Tyre</HI> or <HI>Carthage</HI> by Sea, are found altogether invalid: Yet we will search a little further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquiries whether the Constitutions of the <HI>Phe∣nicians</HI> agree with the <HI>A∣mericans.</HI></NOTE> to see whether the People Analogize, either in their Religion, Policy, Oeconomy, or Customs.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the ancient <HI>Phenicians</HI> liv'd in Tents, and sometimes ex∣chang'd eaten-up Pastures for fresh, which the <HI>Americans</HI> to this day observe; by which it might appear, that they are of a <HI>Phenician</HI> Extract. But why not as well deriv'd from <HI>Numidia, Tartary,</HI> or the ancient Patriarchs, who all liv'd such an unsettl'd wandering Life? Besides, the <HI>Phenicians</HI> had a long time given over Pastoral Business, for Maritime Affairs of greater consequence, not only Merchandizing through all the World, but sending great Colonies in Ships to
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>new Plantations: And moreover, the <HI>Americans</HI> could not so strangely degene∣rate from their Ancestors, but would have built great Cities like them; of which many were found in <HI>Phenicia,</HI> but none of Antiquity in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">As also both their Reli∣gions.</NOTE>As to their Religion, if it agreed with the <HI>Phenicians,</HI> it was the same that all the World profess'd at that time, and therefore may as well be extracted from any other, as them: 'Tis true, we find them inclind to Sorcery, and dealing with Evil Spirits, as the <HI>Phenicians,</HI> in which they were not only guilty, but all other Nations at that time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Known World for∣merly full of Witches.</NOTE>Nay, why not as well transported out of <HI>Asia</HI> or <HI>Europe,</HI> where were formerly many the like Tamperers, and those that dealt in such Diabolical Sciences?

Daemon. <HI>l. 3.</HI></NOTE> Magick-Arts were publickly taught, and they commenc'd Doctors, and took their Degrees according to their Learning?

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Devil-worship formerly us'd in all the World, and now by the <HI>Americans.</HI></NOTE>How famous is <HI>Zoroaster,</HI> and the whole School of the Eastern Magicians? In <HI>Moses</HI>'s time this Wickedness had already took place: Nor can it be deny'd but that the <HI>Phenicians</HI> carry'd their Idols in their Ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lev.</HI> 17.6.</NOTE> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> testifies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idols in Ships.</NOTE> saying, <Q>The Image of <HI>Vulcan</HI> much resembles the <HI>Phenicians Patacoioi,</HI> which they plac'd on the Fore-castle of their Ships.</Q></P>
<P>In like manner, the <HI>Americans</HI> when they go to Sea, carry their Idols with them; and the Ships took Name from the Image, which was either painted or carv'd on the Stern, or plac'd elsewhere upon the Deck.</P>
<P>The same Custom the <HI>Chineses</HI> observe to this present: <HI>Francis Xaverius</HI> re∣lates, <Q> That he sail'd in a <HI>Chinese</HI> Vessel from <HI>Goa</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> which bore an Idol in its Stern, before which the Master lighted Candles, perfum'd it with Aloe-wood, and offer'd Birds and other Food, inquiring of it the Event of his Voyage.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De abstinent Animal. <HI>l. 2.</HI></NOTE>Lastly, <HI>Porphyrius</HI> relates, <Q>That the <HI>Phenicians</HI> upon any great Exigency, as War, excessive Heat, or Mortal Distempers, by order selected one of the most comely and beautiful of their Children, to be offer'd up to <HI>Saturn.</HI></Q> And <HI>Eusebius</HI> saith also out of <HI>Porphyrius,</HI> <Q>That <HI>Saturn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prepar.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Men and Children used for Sacrifices by the <HI>Pheni∣cians</HI> and other People.</NOTE>And although such like cruel Oblations are us'd in <HI>America,</HI> must it therefore follow, that they are deriv'd from the <HI>Phenicians,</HI> when several other People are guilty of the same? Nay, there is scarce one Countrey, which hath not at some time or other perform'd such inhumane Acts, seeming to them Zeal in their Religion; for the most eminent of the Heathens scrupled not at it, which certainly are held to be the <HI>Persians, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> and yet they were not abhorr'd, though committing Humane Slaughters.</P>
<P>This holy Butchery and Religious Slaughter of Mankind began in <HI>Rome</HI> in
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Reign, so continuing till the time of <HI>Tertullian, Lactanti∣us,</HI> and <HI>Eusebius.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> which inhabited the utmost part of <HI>Italy,</HI> em∣ploy'd themselves daily in Sacrificing Strangers to <HI>Saturn,</HI> and sometimes one another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who forbade the sacrifi∣cing of Men.</NOTE> But at last this formal Cruelty became a ridiculous Custom; for the <HI>Romans</HI> by severe Edicts strictly forbad all such Humane Offerings: Yet that they might retain some memory of their former Sacrifices, they order'd thirty Ima∣ges to be made of Rushes, which every year on the fifteenth of <HI>April,</HI> were by the <HI>Roman</HI> Priests and Vestal Nuns, to be thrown from the <HI>Milvian</HI> Bridge into the <HI>Tyber.</HI></P>

<P>But to pass by several other People guilty of such bloody Idolatry, How did the Altars erected in the Woods in <HI>Gaul</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> for <HI>Taran, Hesus, Teu∣tates,</HI> and <HI>Woden,</HI> continually smoke with the Blood of Humane Expiations? Of which, <HI>Caesar</HI> saith thus in his <HI>Commentaries;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bell.

Con∣cerning these bloody Rites, they consulted and imploy'd the <HI>Druydes,</HI> by whose advice they all believ'd that no Victim was so acceptable to the <HI>Nu∣mens,</HI> as pour'd-out Humane Blood, but especially that of Malefactors; which Dainty if they could not procure, their Gods must be treated with the Lives of the Innocent.</Q></P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Reg.</HI> 3. <HI>v.</HI> 26, 27.</NOTE> the Holy Scripture saith thus, <HI>When the King of</HI> Moab <HI>saw that the Battel was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred Men that drew Swords, to break through even to the King of</HI> Edom; <HI>but they could not.

<P>These Testimonies are sufficient Witnestes, That the Ancient <HI>Heathens</HI> ex∣press'd the height of their Devotion, and fury of mad Zeal, in such execrable Rites, as to this day the like is practised by the <HI>Indians, Chineses, Japanners,</HI> and others: Wherefore it can no ways be a sufficient ground to prove, that the <HI>Americans</HI> are deriv'd from the <HI>Phenicians,</HI> because of their Humane Sacrifices, for that they were usual Customs in all Places.</P>

<P>The Mourning for the Dead hath been an old Custom, and is not observ'd by many People, but the time of a Moneth was not setled amongst them, but was observ'd after a more unusual manner, seventy days, as in the Fields of <HI>Moab</HI> for <HI>Moses,</HI> and elsewhere for the Patriarch <HI>Jacob.</HI> Lastly, all people know, that the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> girt themselves about with long Clothes.

The <HI>Mexicans</HI> relate, that their Prede∣cessors onely follow'd Hunting; that they divided and reckon'd the Time, not by Days, but by Nights, and wash'd their Children as soon as they were born in cold Water.</P>
<P>They are so much inclin'd to Gaming, that they venture their Liberty at it. Every one is satisfi'd with one Wife, except some of the Nobility, which of∣tentimes have more. They throw up high Banks in several places to damm out the Sea; believe the Immortality of the Soul; every one eats at a peculiar Table; most of them go naked, onely caver their <HI>Pudenda</HI> with a Cloth; some Sacrifice and eat Mans-flesh: all which, according to <HI>Tacitus, Pliny, Lucan,</HI> and other <HI>Roman</HI> Writers, was observ'd by the antient <HI>Germans;</HI> from whom those that inhabit between the <HI>Norwegian</HI> Mountains were extracted.</P>
<P>These Allegations, to make the <HI>Norwegians</HI> to be the Parents of the Nor∣thern <HI>Americans, John de Laet</HI> thus contradicts : <Q>It no ways follows that one People take original from the other, because here and there are several words found, that have the same signification and sound in divers Countreys; much less when they must either add, change, or diminish several Letters. Moreover, there is no small mistake in the compar'd words: for <HI>Pagod</HI> is not us'd all over <HI>America;</HI> the <HI>East-Indians</HI> about the River <HI>Indus,</HI> call their Idol-Temples <HI>Pagod,</HI> or <HI>Pagode;</HI> the word <HI>Guaira</HI> is no where us'd in <HI>America,</HI> but by the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> and with them not signifying a <HI>Fan,</HI> but a little <HI>Oven;</HI> neither is <HI>Ilama a Lamb,</HI> (for before the coming of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> thither, nei∣ther Sheep nor Lambs were ever seen in <HI>Peru</HI>) but a Wool-bearing Beast, thus describ'd by <HI>Joseph de Acosta:</HI></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of the strange Beast <HI>Ilama</HI> in <HI>Peru.</HI></NOTE><Q><HI>Ilama</HI> (says he) a four-footed Creature, furnishes its Master with Meat and Clothing, and supplies the office of a Beast for Burthens, and at no charge for Hay nor Provender, well satisfi'd with what he finds in the Ways or Mountains. But the <HI>Ilama's</HI> are of two sorts, either woolly, or short-hair'd:
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>the first go by the Name <HI>Pacos,</HI> the other <HI>Moromoro,</HI> being not much less than a Calf, with a long Neck like a Camel, but of several colours; for some are white, some black, and others speckled, having an odd Look, espe∣cially when they are ty'd, and stand still without any motion, staring with goggle-eyes on their Owners: Sometimes in a moody humor, upon a sud∣den taking a freak, they run up to the top of almost inaccessible Mountains, where both the frantick Beast and his Burthen are loft. The <HI>Pacos</HI> sometimes likewise takes sudden Pets, and fustian Fits, often doing the forward <HI>Supersalt,</HI> tumbling over and over with their Goods, and will not be rais'd, their moo∣diness continuing, with beating, nay though they cut them to pieces: but the best way is to sit down by them, and wait some hours till their humor be∣ing spent they rise again of their own accords. These Beasts are much in∣clin'd to a Disease call'd <HI>Carashe</HI> or the <HI>Mange,</HI> of which they generally die: and because the Disease is very catching, they straight bury the infect∣ed alive, so the better to preserve the rest.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Grotius</HI> also mistakes, when he compares the <HI>Mexican Peke</HI> with the <HI>Dutck Beke;</HI> for though many <HI>Mexican</HI> Places, Mountains, and Rivers, terminate in <HI>Peke,</HI> yet it signifies not a <HI>Brook</HI> or <HI>Rivulet,</HI> for that they call <HI>Atlauhtli.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John de Laet</HI> tells also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Orig. Gentium Ame∣ric.</NOTE> That with great diligence he found a <HI>Mexican</HI> Dictio∣nary, Printed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Mexico,</HI> to find if there were any words in it which agreed with any of those <HI>European</HI> Languages that he understood, but found not one.</P>
<P>It is the same case with the Customs and Constitutions between the <HI>Norwe∣gians</HI> and Northern. <HI>Americans:</HI> for what concerns Hunting, how many People have formerly liv'd by it? The antient <HI>Germans,</HI> and to this day the <HI>Tartars</HI> make it their whole business, excelling, in that Art all other Nations. Besides, that the more serious sort of the <HI>Mexicans</HI> many Ages since scorn'd to derive themselves from a Hunting Ancestry, but affirm that they found the <HI>Chichimecen</HI> in those Countreys, who were great <HI>Venators.</HI></P>
<P>The accounting of Time by the Nights, extracted from the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> is ob∣serv'd by divers Eastern People: and although the <HI>Germans</HI> dipt and wash'd their Children in cold Rivers, or Brooks, so soon as they were born, yet the <HI>Mexicans</HI> never did it, but the Mother lays the Child on the fourth day after its Birth, in an open place of the House; in the middle whereof stands a Pot full of Water cover'd with Broom, in which they wash the Infant. Neither are the <HI>Americans</HI> so much addicted to the Vice of Gaming as other Nations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs of the <HI>Ameri∣cans.</HI></NOTE> so that <HI>Grotius</HI> taxeth them too severely as to that point: as on the contrary, he too much clears them of Polygamy, whereas the <HI>Mexicans</HI> Marry as many Wives as they please, or are able to maintain. Father <HI>Martyn Perez</HI> relates the same of the <HI>Cinaloans,</HI> and other <HI>Americans;</HI> as also <HI>Quarterius</HI> of the Natives in <HI>Nova Fran∣cia,</HI> which lie nearest to <HI>Norway.</HI> And what need the <HI>Americans</HI> have the <HI>Germans</HI> their Teachers, to make Dams and Banks against Floods, since Nature and Necessity it self instructs it? and where are any People so ignorant, as to ascribe the same event to Men and Beasts after death? 'Tis true, their man∣ner of eating in <HI>America</HI> is several, because the People do not much converse together: but they did not go naked;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Clothing.</NOTE> for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found them not onely neatly Habited, but had a proper. Name for every thing they wore. The <HI>Virginians</HI> us'd long Shirts; the <HI>Floridans</HI> Skins of wild Beasts; and towards the North they cover'd themselves from Head to Foot in hairy and undress'd Hydes. The sacrificing of Men was in former Ages spreading far and near
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>over the World, and how far it was practis'd here, hath been already declar'd at large. Lastly, all the <HI>Americans</HI> are not guilty of eating of Man's-flesh, but that salvageness is confin'd to the Southern <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much we have said, to prove that the <HI>Norwegians</HI> had no hand in planting the Northern <HI>America,</HI> we shall now proceed to enquire who planted the Southern Parts, from the <HI>Straights</HI> between <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> to the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Peruvians,</HI> possessing a large Tract of Land along the Coast of the <HI>South-Sea, Grotius</HI> would thus derive from <HI>China:</HI></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Peruvians,</HI> being of a subtile Wit, and quick of Apprehension, argue suf∣ficiently that they are not extracted from the more Northern <HI>Americans,</HI> but ra∣ther from the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which the several Wrecks of <HI>Chinese</HI> Ships found on these Coasts sufficiently evidence: and no wonder, if curiosity or accident brought the <HI>Chineses</HI> expert Navigators to this Countrey, separated onely by one Sea from them. To this we may add their Rites of Religion; for both worship the Sun, and call their King the Son of the Sun; they write no Let∣ters, but make Characters downwards.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Relation of <HI>Mancocapa∣cus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mancocapacus</HI> was a <HI>Chinese</HI> of strange Policy; who being inform'd that his Countrey-men inhabited fruitful Coun∣treys on the other side of the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> but without Laws or Government, Sail'd over thither, and gather'd the scatter'd Multitudes in a Body, and establish'd an hereditary Kingdom after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner, to him and his Successors.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Americans</HI> are not extracted from <HI>China.</HI></NOTE>To which <HI>John de Laet</HI> answers thus:</P>
<Q><P>Though the <HI>Peruvians</HI> exceed the other <HI>Americans</HI> in Policy, and at the arrival of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> liv'd in a handsom Order of Government, yet they can no ways be compar'd to the sharp-witted, and noble-spirited <HI>Chineses;</HI> nay, there are in no Place of <HI>Peru</HI> found such Artificers as those of <HI>China,</HI> that bear the praise of all the World; no where such manner of Buildings or Cities, nor the least likeness of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Curiosities. As concerning the Wrecks found in <HI>Peru,</HI> I find no cre∣dible Author that gives an account thereof: for certainly the <HI>Chineses</HI> could much easier, and a nearer way have come through the <HI>Atlantick Sea</HI> to the Coasts of <HI>America,</HI> lying to the East of <HI>Peru,</HI> than steer along the vast, and much greater <HI>South Sea,</HI> and endure the horrible Storms and vast Waves, which the <HI>European</HI> Ships are scarce able to endure, much less the <HI>Chinese</HI> Ves∣sels, which are not so good. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> which Sail yearly from <HI>Acupul∣co</HI> to the <HI>Philippines</HI> sensible of the great danger which they endure, chiefly by the great gusts of Wind near <HI>California.</HI> Besides, the <HI>Peruvians</HI> before the the arrival of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> were utterly ignorant of great Ships, and the use of Sails. How could they at once have forgotten that Art, which they brought with them thither, Moreover, it is easier to Sail from <HI>Peru</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> than from <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Peru;</HI> because the Winds under the Equinoctial Line commonly blow Easterly. And it is the greater wonder, that the <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> Jonks accidentally by Storm should be driven to <HI>Peru,</HI> because they were never stor'd with Provisions but for a short Voyage, whereas this ask'd nine Moneths. But if any one will suppose, that they purposely directed their Course thither, how came the <HI>Chineses</HI> to Sail just to <HI>Peru,</HI> and not to <HI>New Spain,</HI> which is much closer to <HI>China?</HI> why were there no Merchan∣dises of the <HI>Chineses</HI> found in <HI>Peru,</HI> since they went thither for Trade? how came they to neglect that Navigation they had once found? Nor is their Sun-worship (which was formerly practis'd in most Parts of the World) of
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>any validity to derive them from <HI>China?</HI> But the contrary is most apparent, for the <HI>Peruvians</HI> worship for their chief God, <HI>Viracocha,</HI> that is, <HI>God Almighty,</HI> or <HI>The Creator of all things.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> it <HI>Consutius</HI> an eye-witness may be credited, are divided into three Sects of Religion: The first follow the Learn'd <HI>Trigantius,</HI> and acknow∣ledge a King of the Heavens, which must onely be serv'd as the <HI>Chineses</HI> sole Governor; to which purpose, two Temples are built in the Royal Cities <HI>Nankin</HI> and <HI>Pekin,</HI> one Consecrate to Heaven, and the other to the Earth. The second Sect hath the name of <HI>Sciequia,</HI> and serve the Idol <HI>Omyto.</HI> The third nam'd <HI>Lanzu,</HI> imploy themselves in Magick and Exorcisms, Conju∣ring up, and laying Evi-Spirits, whose horrid representations, when they have stuck upon the Walls, they make an artificial and dreadful noise, as if Hell were broke loose, and the House full of Devils; sometimes also force the Evil-Spirits to enter into Images, from whence they receive no imper∣tinent answers to their questions: Therefore, who will compare this Su∣perstition of the <HI>Peruvians</HI> worshipping of the Sun, to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Religion, which do no such things?</P>
<P>The <HI>Peruvians</HI> call'd their King, <HI>A Lord of the Realm,</HI> and not <HI>The Son of the Sun,</HI> as in <HI>China:</HI> Though the <HI>Mexicans</HI> otherwise worship the Sun, and in their manner of adulation, styl'd <HI>Hernando Cortez,</HI> their Conqueror, <HI>Son of the Sun:</HI> As to what concerns the manner of writing, it is very well known, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> words are all Monosyllables, so that they have as many Letters as Words, which they joyn so together, that they reckon eighty thousand, but with ten thousand they are able to express themselves in most matters. These Characters are contain'd in their <HI>Halpien</HI> or Dictionary.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Embassy to the <HI>Cham,</HI> l. 2. c. 2.</NOTE> The antient <HI>Chineses</HI> us'd seventeen several sorts of Characters in their writing, some con∣sisting of Serpents, that by several Wreathes and contortious Windings, sig∣nify'd several things; others, of all sorts of agrestick Tools belonging to Husbandry; some Characters of the Feathers of the Bird <HI>Fum-hoar;</HI> others of Oysters and Worms, or of Roots, of Herbs, or Birds Claws, or of Turtles, or of Herbs and Birds Feathers mingled, or of Planets, and such like; but what manner of Writing or Hieroglyphick of theirs resembles those, who by their own testimony know neither Pen, Paper, Ink, nor any manner of Writing, but reckon the antiquity of time by strung Beads, which was observ'd many ages since among several Nations.</P></Q>

<P>Another Allegation for the Planting of <HI>America</HI> by Land, both whose sides are wash'd on the East and West, by the South and Atlantick Ocean, may be thus probably made out: The Atlantick rowls over with almost Fathomless Waters, three thousand Leagues of Ground; the South-Sea not much less, which well may be, being indeed but one continu'd Sea, encompassing, till meeting there, the Universal Ball; whence springs a more likelyhood, that <HI>America</HI> might be Planted from the Southern parts, from the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magel∣lan,</HI> and <HI>Le-Mayr.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Relatie de Terra Australe.</NOTE><HI>Peter Fernandes de Quir</HI> relates, That he and a Commander, <HI>Lodowick Paes le Torres</HI> saw a part of the South Countrey, and in it innumerable Inhabitants, <HI>Whites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Description of the unknown South.</NOTE> <HI>Blacks, Sallows,</HI> with long, black, curl'd, Woolly, and yellow Hair.

<P>This great <HI>Tartary,</HI> which is a thousand Leagues long, and six hundred broad, reckons five chief Provinces, <HI>viz.</HI> the wild <HI>Tartary,</HI> inhabited by Herdsmen; <HI>Sa∣gatai,</HI> of which the Metropolis is <HI>Samarcand,</HI> famous for the mighty <HI>Tamerlane;</HI> next <HI>Turkestan;</HI> then <HI>Kitai,</HI> which the great <HI>Cham</HI> Commands; and lastly, <HI>Old Tartary,</HI> according to <HI>Andreas Caesariensis,</HI> the habitation of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog.</HI></P>
<P>Now we must enquire from what <HI>Tartars</HI> the <HI>Americans</HI> are Extracted:</P>
<P><HI>Mornaeus, Postellus, Genebrardus, Poterus,</HI> and others are of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thrian</HI> l. 67.</NOTE> That the <HI>Tartars,</HI> which about the year 1228. under the Command of <HI>Zingis Cham</HI> overspread the Earth like a deluge, were the Successors of the ten Tribes of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> which were carry'd into captivity to <HI>Assyria</HI> by <HI>Salmanazar.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">If the <HI>Israelites</HI> were <HI>Tar∣tars.</HI></NOTE> The name <HI>Tar∣tary,</HI> or rather <HI>Tattaria,</HI> seems to be some testimony thereof, because it signifies in the <HI>Syrian</HI> or <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue, <HI>Remnants</HI> or <HI>Remainders,</HI> as seemingly, because these <HI>Tartarians</HI> were remainders of the foremention'd Tribes; nay, the Northern <HI>Tartary</HI> Herdsmen preserve to this day the Names <HI>Dan, Zabulon,</HI> and <HI>Naphthali:</HI> Wherefore we need not to admire, why so many <HI>Jews</HI> are found in <HI>Russia, Sar∣matia,</HI> and <HI>Liefland;</HI> nay, the nearer to <HI>Tartary,</HI> the mote <HI>Jews</HI> there are.</P>
<P>Circumcision hath a long time been observ'd among them, before <HI>Mahomet</HI> brought in his new Law; it seems, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> order'd the Circumcision and other Laws, according to <HI>Moses,</HI> to be observ'd by the Northern people, be∣cause that in his time, they began to Rebel, that so they might the better be kept in awe by their new Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Joannes Leonclavius</HI> relates, That in <HI>Liefland</HI> near <HI>Riga,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pand. Hist. Turtica.</NOTE> he heard the wilde Natives call'd <HI>Letti,</HI> not without great admiration, go crying along the High-Ways and Fields, with a doleful voice, <HI>Jeru, Jeru, Masco lou:</HI> It is believ'd that they mourn for <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Damascus;</HI> but by their long continuance in the vast Wildernesses, they have forgot their Religion and Laws, and what else might enable to tell us who they were. Several learned Authors question this removal of the <HI>Israelites</HI> out of <HI>Assyria</HI> to <HI>Tartary,</HI> though to our Judgement their Arguments are too weak, to take from them of the footing they have gotten there; yet nevertheless, the <HI>Israelites</HI> are not to be taken for the Planters of <HI>America,</HI> for why else is not <HI>Judaisme</HI> as well found in <HI>America</HI> as in <HI>Tartary.</HI> But it is already shewn, that <HI>America</HI> was inhabited long before the dispersion of the <HI>Israelites.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Americans</HI> are not deriv'd from <HI>Africa</HI> nor <HI>Europe.</HI></NOTE>Now to shut up all, it is evident, that the first Planters of <HI>America</HI> were not <HI>Europeans</HI> from the dissimilitude of the People, both in their Complexions, Lan∣guage,

<P>It deserves here to be related, what happen'd to <HI>Henry Cornelison Schaep,</HI> and <HI>William Byleveld,</HI> Sailing from <HI>Batavia</HI> to discover the <HI>Tartarick</HI> River <HI>Polysange,</HI> but were taken and carry'd Prisoners to the <HI>Japan</HI> Court at <HI>Jedo;</HI> being Com∣manded there by Order of the Councel to give an account of a <HI>Japan</HI> Map or Card, which was laid before them, and contain'd the Provinces of <HI>Japan, Am∣boina,</HI> the <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands, <HI>Manilha,</HI> the <HI>South-Sea, Borneo, Celebes, Malacca, Tartary, Formosa, Corea,</HI> and the vast and Mountainous Countrey or Desart of <HI>Jesso,</HI> sepa∣rated from <HI>Japan</HI> by the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Sungar;</HI> though toward the North, it joyns to <HI>Japan</HI> in the Province of <HI>Ochio;</HI> and beginning in forty seven degrees, run North-East towards <HI>America,</HI> but they could not possible find the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Anian;</HI> but on the contrary, the Promontory of <HI>Tartary, viz.</HI> the Province <HI>Ka∣taya</HI> or <HI>Katui</HI> lay in the same parallel with the Northern <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Hereto may be added, that <HI>Asia</HI> hath no Territory any where, which may more easily with numerous Colonies supply <HI>America</HI> than this part of <HI>Tartary,</HI> as well for the vastness of the Countrey, to which no other can compare, as for the increasing of the Inhabitants: Who doth not admire, that according to <HI>Michalon Lithouwer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ennead</HI> 9. l. 6. Testimonies that the <HI>Ame∣ricans</HI> are <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE> there is scarce a City in <HI>Tartary</HI> that boasted less than a thou∣sand Temples? and to see <HI>Canguista</HI> first King of <HI>Tartary,</HI> about the Year 1200. in Arms; and his Successor <HI>Hoccata</HI> following his Fathers bloody Footsteps, whilst he prepar'd his Sons with three vast Armies?

Hoccata</HI> himself March'd victoriously into the North <HI>America,</HI> subdu'd great part of the <HI>Persian</HI> Kingdom, and beat the <HI>Turks,</HI> led by the General <HI>Goniata</HI> with a great Army, <HI>Anno</HI> 1241. as <HI>Jacob Planensis</HI> and <HI>Bene∣dictus Sarmata,</HI> two <HI>Monks,</HI> sent by Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> to <HI>Hoccata,</HI> witness: The great number of the <HI>Tartars</HI> or <HI>Scythians,</HI> may appear by the several people, spread far and near over <HI>Tartary; Pliny</HI> reckons some of them, <HI>viz. Auchetes, Neuri, Ge∣loni, Thussagetes, Budini, Basilides, Agathyrsi, Nomades, Anthropophagi, Hyperborei, Arimphei, Cimmerij, Cicianthi, Georgi, Sacores,</HI> and others: What number would the Inhabitants make up that live in <HI>America,</HI> in <HI>Teneneuf, Virginia, Florida, New Spain, Guadalaiara, Guatemala, Terra firma, New Granada, Peru, Chili, Rio de la Plata, Brasil, Guaiana, New Andaluzai?</HI></P>
<P>It will be worth our time, to compare the likeness between the <HI>Scythians</HI> and Northern <HI>Americans;</HI> both of them are differenc'd with special Marks of a more than ordinary and natural distance between the Eyes, which much alters the whole Air of the Face, and the plumpness and swelling of their Cheeks sum∣mits
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>above the Cheek-bone; most of these are of a middle stature, having downy Hair upon their Chin, like the Callow Feathers of an unfledg'd Bird. Lastly, as the <HI>Tartars,</HI> they differ amongst themselves in their Customs, yet in several things they agree one with another, according as they are govern'd by others, and yet other Princes, some powerful, and some weaker, according as every ones power be more or less. The Inhabitants of <HI>Lucaja</HI> bear so great a respect, and stand so much in awe of their Governor, that if commanded to leap, from a Rock, and break their Necks, they instantly obey.</P>
<P>The same is observ'd by the <HI>Tartars;</HI> the first King <HI>Canguista</HI> Commanded the seven Princes of his Realm to Murder their Sons with their own Hands, which they all readily performed.</P>
<P>In <HI>Popaina</HI> they live to this day like some <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Costitutions of the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> and <HI>Americans</HI> agree.</NOTE> without Laws or Law∣givers, who change their places by turns, from the great increase or the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI> the <HI>Americans</HI> no ways differ.</P>
<P><HI>Bartholomeus de las Casas</HI> writ to <HI>Charles the Fifth,</HI> That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in few years, onely on the Islands <HI>Cuba, Hispaniola, Naco, Hondures,</HI> in <HI>Venezuela</HI> and <HI>New Spain,</HI> destroy'd above 2600000. Men, besides the slaughter that was made in <HI>Peru, Brafil, Rio de la Plata</HI> and other places, which far exceed the foremen∣tion'd numbers.</P>
<P>Polygamy is still in use, both among the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Americans;</HI> both ad∣knowledge the Immortality of the Soul, both like <HI>Cannibals,</HI> Eating and Sacri∣ficing Mans flesh. How famous amongst the Antients was the Altar of <HI>Diana</HI> in <HI>Taurica Chersonesus,</HI> where several Men were daily Sacrificed? How deli∣cate, according to <HI>Sabellicus,</HI> did the <HI>Tartars</HI> account their Dishes, Sauc'd and serv'd with humane Gore?</P>
<P><HI>Strabo</HI> relates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Grogr.</HI> l. 11. q. 7.</NOTE> That the antient People account it an honourable Death to be chop'd in pieces, and their flesh serv'd up in Commons. Those that die by Age, a natural death, are despis'd like Malefactors, and as a punishment ac∣cording to their Demerits, left in the open Fields, a prey to Birds and Beasts; some delight in that loathsome gorging themselves with Mens flesh, others on the contrary, not onely detest humane, but all manner of flesh: And just so the <HI>Americans</HI> are distinguish'd, for although the <HI>Caribes, Brasilians,</HI> the Inhabi∣tants of <HI>New Spain, New Granada, St. Martha,</HI> and others, Sacrifice and eat Men, yet as many abhor and detest that odious Diet and abominable Custom.</P>
<P><HI>Giles Flesher</HI> Queen <HI>Elisabeths</HI> Agent in <HI>Muscow</HI> relates, That <HI>Anno</HI> 1588. <HI>Kinach Morsey,</HI> Grandson to the Governor of the <HI>Chrim Tartars,</HI> made his entrance there with a Retinue of three hundred Noblemen, and two Ladies, of which one was the Widow of his deceased Brother. The great Prince inform'd of their com∣ing, sent him two slaughter'd Horses, whose sides and Hanches they feasted on, as we on Fallow Deer.</P>
<P>Most of the <HI>Tartars</HI> use no manner of Letters or Characters; in the Voyage made into <HI>Persia,</HI> they first learn'd to make Letters; just so it is in <HI>America;</HI> their bemoaning of the dead ends in one Moneth, both by the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Ame∣ricans;</HI> with a Person of Quality, the <HI>Tartars</HI> bury a live Servant; the same Custom is observ'd by some of the <HI>Americans;</HI> and so much do they agree in a salvage and rude life, that Merchandizing and Mechanicks are little regarded, <HI>Ayson</HI> the <HI>American</HI> acknowledges the <HI>Tartars</HI> for a rude People in their Religion, Habits, and Dwellings, and yet in all these the <HI>Americans</HI> differ but very little. Lastly, How common is it amongst them to worship the Devil?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Devil-worship in <HI>Amer∣rica.</HI></NOTE> Along the River <HI>Sagadahoc,</HI> the Inhabitants are every new Moon miserably tormented by
<PB N="42" REF="29"/>an Evil Spirit call'd <HI>Tanto.</HI> In the Temples in <HI>Virginia</HI> remain yet the horrible Images of the Devils <HI>Oka</HI> and <HI>Menetto.</HI> Not a House in <HI>Mexico,</HI> but hath a pe∣culiar Chappel, set apart for this their suppos'd holy, but damnable Adoration of the Devil. Others in <HI>Virginia</HI> believe, That there is a great and supreme De∣ity, which is Everlasting, and for ever. The <HI>Tartars</HI> also are of the like per∣swasion.</P>
<P>But this Opinion <HI>Grotius</HI> hath laid a strong and dangerous Battery against, that <HI>America</HI> could not be Peopled by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> because the <HI>Americans</HI> before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> coming thither, had never seen any Horses; whereas the <HI>Tartars</HI> use no Beast more, either in Peace or War, nor can less want: For the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Forces do not only consist in Horse;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tartarian</HI> Horses.</NOTE> but the Wealth of this Countrey is reckon'd up in the numerous Breeds of Horses, and several Studs of Mares. Some of the Nobless keep a thousand Horse; none, though never so poor, but keep two or three; and Beggars there mounted crave Alms and Charity of the People. When they remove their Habitations, their Horses carry their Provisions and Tents: If Provisions grow short, they eat Mares Milk, high gusted with Garlick, which satisfies Hunger and Thirst; and the red Liquor which they tap warm from their Veins, serves them to help Digestion, and heighten their Humor, instead of the Blood of the Grape, our sweet Wine. The swiftest Rivers, though raging and precipitated with Land-floods, they dare adventure swimming their Horses over, hanging naked by their Manes, and guiding them by a slipp'd Rein whither they please: To their Tails they tie their Saddles, and other Necessaries, bound up in Rushes. When a Per∣son of Quality prepares to cross any River, they tie two Horses Tail to Tail, and athwart both their Backs fasten a Mat pleited of Rushes, to sit on. When they are stopp'd at any broad River, or standing Lake, they kill and flea their worst Horses; then turning the Skins inside out, and well Liquoring, they stretch them open with the Ribs, which stand like the Bayles of a Tilted Wher∣ry, and thus furnish'd, serves them for a Boat to carry eight Persons. When they take the Field, going to War, not any but musters three Horses; which makes their Armies, when drawn out in Campain, shew much bigger than indeed they are: And though many of them are kill'd in the Wars, or slain for Food, yet the <HI>European Tartars</HI> pay yearly forty thousand Horses to the <HI>Rus∣sians</HI> from whence <HI>Grotius</HI> thus argues, <Q>If <HI>America</HI> joyns to <HI>Tartary,</HI> then the Horses which run wild at Grass might easily have found <HI>America</HI> them∣selves, seeking to improve their Pasture, and have gone from one Countrey into the other, as it appears, that since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> transported Horses to <HI>America,</HI> they are dispers'd over the highest Mountains, out of one Province into the other: Or if the <HI>Straights of Anian</HI> run between both, the <HI>Tartars</HI> never were Navigators; and suppose they had been, they would not have cross'd without Horses, without which they knew not how to subsist.</Q> To which we only say thus, That although <HI>Tartary</HI> now, and in former times, abounded in Horse, yet must we grant, that it hath been always so? or that the ancient <HI>Scythians,</HI> who we avouch first planted <HI>America,</HI> had such frequent use of them as the <HI>Tartars</HI> now. This may be controverted, for that these <HI>Scythians</HI> planting there in the Non-age of Time, presently after the Flood, the use of Horses was unknown, which the Ancient Poets testifie by their Fi∣ction of <HI>Centaurs,</HI> who when first seen, the Horse and Rider were taken for one Creature. The like mistake the <HI>Mexicans</HI> had, when they saw the mount∣ed <HI>Spaniards,</HI> a thousand running away from one Cavalier.</P>

<P><HI>Christopher Colonus,</HI> generally (though by mistake) call'd <HI>Columbus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pet Bizari Res Genoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. lib. 6.</NOTE> was born in <HI>Arbizolo,</HI> a Village in the Dominion of <HI>Genoa,</HI> near <HI>Sovona;</HI> his Father liv'd by Fishing in the Midland-Sea: So that <HI>Sebastian Schroter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>11.</HI> Hist. Georg.</NOTE> and others besides him, are mistaken, saying, <HI>Colonus</HI> was born in the City <HI>Cucu∣reum,</HI> and descended of the Noble Family <HI>Pilistrelli:</HI> For <HI>Peter Bezarus, Colunus</HI> his Countrey-man, gives unquestionable Proofs of his mean Extract;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christoph. Colonus<HI>'s Birth.</HI></NOTE> and amongst other things, That the Common-wealth of <HI>Genoa</HI> refus'd to receive the great Legacy which <HI>Colonus</HI> left them in his Will, because they fondly thought it a derogation to their Honor, being so great a Republick, to take any thing of Bequest from a Fishers Son: Yet his Majesty of <HI>Castile</HI> thought otherwise, not onely enriching him with Wealth, and a fair Revenue for his Discovery of the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> but also, though of a low derivation, rais'd him to great Honor, Ennobling him the first of his Family with Dignities, Titles, and Escutcheon, which rank'd him in place among his Prime Nobility.</P>
<P><HI>Colonus,</HI> whom we shall henceforth call <HI>Columbus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Life.</NOTE> spent his Youth neat the Sea, where he was busie exploring the Winds, considering their Natures, and the Quarters whence the rose, especially with the setting of the Current from the <HI>Atlantick</HI> to the <HI>Mediterrane.</HI> The Wescern Winds, which often, as well as the <HI>Levant,</HI> blow several days together from the great Ocean, much amusing him, hinted at last some Notions, that there might be another World, and hew Pla∣ces to be discover'd, beyond the setting of the Sun; and that the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> should not be, if he could help, it, the commanding Terminary of the Earth that way. He also spent much time, being of a solid Judgment, in the Emen∣dations of Charts and Maps, then very much improvable: And the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who at that time had got the start in Navigation from all other People, being the busie to find a way by the South of <HI>Africa</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> not contented to go by hear-say, he went himself in Person a Voyage with them. Soon af∣ter <HI>Columbus</HI> settled himself in the Island <HI>Madera,</HI> where an Accident hapned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Accident. <HI>Hst. Peru.</HI></NOTE> which <HI>Francis Lopez de Gomesa</HI> relates thus: <Q>The Master of a Ship, whose Name and Countrey lies buried in Oblivion (though some would have him to be of <HI>Spain,</HI> some an <HI>Andalusian</HI> or <HI>Biscayner,</HI> and other a <HI>Portuguese</HI>) Tra∣ding to the <HI>Canaries</HI> and <HI>Flemmish-Isles,</HI> was surpris'd by a hideous Tempest
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>from the East, which hurried him <HI>nolens volens</HI> through dreadful Waves, where at last he found himself ingag'd upon a Western Coast, altogether un∣known. The Storm ceasing, without making further Discoveries, he pick'd his way homeward, at last Landing in the Haven of <HI>Madera:</HI> All his Crew but three and himself, with hardship, want, and the long Voyage having pe∣rish'd, himself dangerously sick, was carried into <HI>Columbus</HI> his House; where lying on his Death-Bed, he bequeath'd to <HI>Columbus</HI> his Maps, Journals, and other Observations of this his unfortunate Voyage.</Q> <HI>Columbus</HI> being by these Papers more confirm'd than ever in his Opinion of a New World in the West, declar'd what he verily believ'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes his Address at <HI>Genoa</HI></NOTE> to the States of <HI>Genoa;</HI> but they look'd upon him as a vain and idle Fellow; yet <HI>Columbus</HI> full of his great Project, thus slighted and scornfully rejected, sate not so down, but address'd himself to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></NOTE> where they wearied him, spending long time with dila∣tory Answers, to ho effect; the Opinion of a whole Court of expert Naviga∣tors having cast his Declaration out, as a <HI>Chimera</HI> or meer Fancy. Soon after <HI>Columbus</HI> sending his Brother into <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">English.</NOTE> to move the Business to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, he being taken Prisoner by the way, and lying long er'e his Re∣lease, came too late to the <HI>English</HI> Court, prevented by the News of <HI>Christophe</HI>'s return with Success from his intended Voyage: For mean while <HI>Ferdinando</HI> and <HI>Isabella</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And <HI>Castilian</HI> King, con∣cerning a New World.</NOTE> having finish'd his Wars with the <HI>Moors,</HI> had fur∣nish'd him out for the Expedition; which he effected by the favor of <HI>Alfonso Mendotio</HI> and <HI>Alfonso Quintavilia,</HI> both great Ministers of State under <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabel,</HI> and obtain'd so much at last, that he was sent with a hundred and twenty Souldiers, besides Sea-men, in two Ships, and one Pinnace. Thus sup∣plied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sails from <HI>Cadiae</HI> to dis∣cover New Countreys.</NOTE> he set Sail from <HI>Cadiz</HI> upon the Kings account the fourth of <HI>August, Anno</HI> 1492, and first reach'd the <HI>Canary-Islands,</HI> and from thence steering South-West, the Wind in thirty three days scarce varying one Point: But though the Weather blew so constant, yet the Sea-men chang'd their Minds, and Storm'd quite contrary, crying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His People rebel.</NOTE> That <HI>Columbus</HI> was guilty of all their Deaths: <HI>For</HI> (said they, after they had lost sight of the <HI>Canaries</HI> so many days, nothing appearing but Sea and Sky) <HI>Who can hope for any Success or happy conclusion of so desperate a Voyage, so rashly undertaken, and found now so full of eminent danger?</HI> Yet <HI>Columbus</HI> bore bravely up, and weather'd all their Exclamations, although, they threatned no less than his Murder: At last Articling, they came to this Agreement, <HI>That if after sailing forwards three days more, no Land were discover'd, they should return:</HI> But about two a Clock the next Night, <HI>Columbus</HI> saw a glim∣mering like Fire in the Sky, and in the Morning found himself close aboard a most pleasant Coast, where Landing with twelve Men, he erected a Cross cut out of a Tree. Thence he sail'd over to <HI>Cuba,</HI> where the Sea was so rough, that he was forc'd to stand off, fearing Rocks and Shallow Water. Soon after he got to the Northward of the Island <HI>Haytin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovers <HI>Hispaniola.</HI></NOTE> which he call'd <HI>Hispaniola:</HI> Here his best Ship was bulged upon a Rock, on which they had all perish'd, had it not been flat on the top, so that the Soldiers and the whole Crew of Sea-men were sav'd by the two Vessels. The Inhabitants stark naked, seeing these Strangers, fled to the Woods; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> overtaking a Woman, they en∣tertain'd her with Sweet-meats and <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, and putting her on a white Shirt, sent her again to the rest of the Natives, where return'd, she told what good Entertainment she had had to her Companions; whereupon divers of the Islanders came aboard of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trades with the Natives.</NOTE> in Boats made of one piece of Wood, where they barter'd Gold for Beads, pieces of Glass, Knives, Shells,
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>and other Trifles. The King of <HI>Guaccanarillo</HI> gave testimony of peculiar incli∣nation to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> helping them to Fish up the remaining Goods of the Wreck, and inform'd them, That some Rivers flowing, from the tops of high Mountains, wash'd down the Gold amongst the Sand: notwithstanding a strange Prophecy had been told to these Islanders, namely, <HI>That Bearded Men out of remote Countries should destroy their Goods, take their Land, and massacre their Chil∣dren.</HI> He also told them what made them fly, and betake them to their Heels at the arrival of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> because they were oftentimes surpris'd by the <HI>Cannibals,</HI> who snatch'd up all they could lay hold on: Their Boys and Strip∣lings they gelded, cooping and cramming them up, as we our Capons, for Feasts: The young and well-grown Men they chopp'd to pieces, salted, and Barrel'd up: Young Women they preserv'd for breed, and old ones they made Slaves. These <HI>Cannibals</HI> were so terrible to the Inhabitants of <HI>Haytin,</HI> that a thousand of them durst not venture to engage against ten, but would run eve∣ry way, dispers'd like Flocks of Sheep before the Wolf.</P>
<P>Lastly, Their King permitted the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to build a Lodge or Hovel, wherein thirty or forty of them might shelter; but indeed so taking possession in right of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Mean while <HI>Columbus</HI> return'd in safety to <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> and was receiv'd with great joy, King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> making him Admiral of the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is highly honor'd.</NOTE> and sending his Brother <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Governor to <HI>Haytin,</HI> now call'd <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> The Gold, Parrots, Mastick, Aloes, the strange Bread <HI>Jucca,</HI> whose extracted Juyce is rank Poyson, but the Body makes good Meal, which kneaded and bak'd, yields a fine Man∣chet and wholesom Food, they look'd upon with great delight and admirati∣on; but two of the Natives being naked, with Gold Rings through their No∣ses and Ears, Ornaments with them of high esteem, and signifying their no mean Quality, the People old and young came in Throngs to wonder at, ne∣ver, weary of gazing upon them. But the King, encourag'd by this Success, took no dilatory Course, but suddenly, and before any could expect, built fourteen stout Carvels, and three Frigats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes with seventeen Sail a second time to <HI>Hispaniola</HI></NOTE> and as soon mann'd them with twelve hundred Soldiers, besides a great number of Artificers of all forts, with their Wives and Children, freighting them with Horses, Swine, Goats, Cattel for Breed, all sorts of <HI>European</HI> Corn to sow, Fruit-Trees and Vines to plant, and some Priests to instruct and convert the Natives to their Religion.</P>
<P>The second of <HI>September, Anno</HI> 1493. they set sail from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and Anchor'd before <HI>Ferreo,</HI> the last and furthest of the <HI>Canary-Islands,</HI> where they could get no Water, but what dropp'd from the Dew hanging on Trees into Troughs. After that, <HI>Columbus</HI> came on the one and twentieth day amongst the <HI>Caribby-Islands,</HI> where he dropp'd Anchor before one, which he Call'd <HI>Dominico;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Barbadoes, St. Chri∣stophers, &amp;c.</NOTE> but finding it desolate, set sail further, and discover'd several other Coasts, where he likewise found nothing but very great Porcupines or Hedg-hogs, arid sweet∣smelling Trees. Steering forward, he found the Coasts of the <HI>Cannibals,</HI> which inhabited along the Shore in little Huts or Hovels, built round of Wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Huts of the <HI>Cannibals.</HI></NOTE> and stak'd about on the out-side with long Poles, like <HI>Palisado's:</HI> They have also Posts within, which are shorter, pleited and fastned together with Cot∣ton, or long Roots of Trees, plyant like our Osiars, over which they hang Cloths painted with horrible Figures and strange Representations: The Roofs rise like our Canopy'd Tents, highest in the middle, cover'd with Palm-Tree, Leaves to keep off the Rain: At the Entrances hang two Hairy Images on Poles, not for Religion sake, but Ornament: Their Bed-steads being high
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>from the Ground, are fill'd with a kind of Straw; and in long Hovels fitted for that purpose they store their Sugar.</P>
<P><HI>Columbus</HI> landing here, found all the <HI>Cannibals</HI> fled; but their Houses full of Stone Vessels, Cruises, Pans, and Pots, boyling with Mens Flesh, Parrots, and Wild-foul; the Hanches and Sides of young Men, on Spits roasting at the Fire, with the Splinters of whose broken Bones they headed their Arrows. This Island by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Carucueria, Columbus</HI> chang'd to <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> because the Mountains rise up with their tops not unlike <HI>Estremadura</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Island <HI>Guadalupe.</HI></NOTE> famous there for the wonderful Representation of our Lady, as that of the Lady of <HI>Loretto</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> Thirty Women which he had taken from the neigh∣boring Isles, he sent with Presents to the fled <HI>Canibals,</HI> which the next day re∣turning made a great appearance hear the Shore; but when they had gaz'd a while upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> looking stedfastly on one another, they suddenly ran back again, sheltring themselves in the Covert of the Woods. <HI>Columbus</HI> think∣ing it not worth his while to expect their return, seeing their barbarous Life, burnt and destroy'd all their Boats, and spoiling whatever ht could, sail'd to <HI>Matanino.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Women in <HI>Ma∣tanino.</HI></NOTE>The releas'd Women in <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> that came back again, inform'd the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> That <HI>Matanino</HI> was an Isle onely inhabited by Women, which at accustom'd times row'd over to these <HI>Cannibals,</HI> where a while they drove a Trade and Commerce of Love, the Product of which, if Girls, they kept; but the Boys they sent over to their Fathers. They live in Caves, the Mouths and Entrances of which they maintain and stoutly make good with their Bowe, shooting Arrows as thick as Hail at the approach of Men, after their impregnating by the <HI>Cannibals.</HI></P>
<P>From hence the Fleet pass'd by several other fruitful Islands, <HI>Columbus</HI> giving them the Names of <HI>Montseratto, Rodondo, St. Martin, Santa Cruz,</HI> formerly by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Ayaya.</HI> On this last Island he landed thirty Men, who took four Women, which held out their Hands before them, as if Petitioners that begg'd Quarter, or praying, and then conceal'd themselves in Ambuscade, the better to surprize more; when by chance they spied an <HI>Indian Canoo</HI> at Sea, with eight Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable Passage of <HI>Columbus.</HI></NOTE> and as many Women; whereupon those in Ambuscade made a Signal to the next Ship, which immediately sent off some Boats well Mann'd; but before they drew near them, or expected an On-set, one of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was kill'd, and another wounded with their Arrows; amongst whom a Woman, to whom all the rest shew'd greatest Respect and Reverence, aim'd very exactly. Their barbed Shafts were poyson'd; whereupon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> enrag'd, stemm'd the <HI>Canoo,</HI> and oversetting, row'd quite over; which little or nothing avail'd; for they all swam, and though separated, shot their Arrows at them, as if the Boat had been a But. At last the <HI>Indians</HI> got upon a blind Rock, cover'd with Shole Water, which gave them fresh Courage; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having more aid sent them from the Fleet, took them all Prisoners; but the Queens Son being wounded in the Scuffle, and dying soon after, was thrown overboard.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salvageness of the <HI>Indi∣ans.</HI></NOTE> The Prisoners being brought before <HI>Columbus,</HI> foam'd at the Mouth for raging madness; and being afterwards carried to <HI>Castile,</HI> so re∣tain'd their fierce and salvage Nature, that they scar'd away and frighted the safe Beholders.</P>
<P>Mean while the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet proceeded on their Voyage, between several Islands, to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> of which some appear desolate and barren, others green and Woody; the small Vessels sailing close under the Shore, and the great ones
<PB N="47" REF="32"/>standing further off at Sea, which was very turbulent, and beat exceedingly against the Shole Rocks. The Island <HI>Burichema, Columbus</HI> call'd St. <HI>Johns,</HI> to which belong'd some of the Women sent forth in <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> who inform'd them, That <HI>Burichema</HI> was well inhabited by a kind and hospitable People, who when the <HI>Cannibals</HI> landed there fought them, and if Conquerors, were so much exasperated with their inhumane Barbarisms, that they seiz'd on them like Mastiffs open-mouth'd, and tore them piece-meal with their Teeth; yet themselves abhorring the Custom of eating Mens Flesh. Here the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found onely a large House, surrounded with twelve lesser ones, all deserted; for the Inhabitants with their King <HI>Chiasichio</HI> were then retir'd into the cool and more sheltring Woods, from the mid-day Heat. All this the <HI>Indians</HI> told him, which he brought back with him from <HI>Spain.</HI> Coming to an Anchor at <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> he sent one of the <HI>Indians</HI> ashore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Columbus</HI> come to <HI>Hi∣spaniola.</HI></NOTE> that he might tell what brave things he had seen in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Court; but the remaining three took the ad∣vantage of the following Night, and leaping over-board, swam to Shore. But this Accident he not much regarded, trusting to have a sufficient Account from his eight and thirty <HI>Spaniards</HI> which he had left in the Fort upon the Island; and the more, because King <HI>Guaccanarillo</HI>'s brother, in sign of Friendship, had presented him with two Golden Images: But all these Conjectures fail'd him, so that hearing nothing, he landed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Finds the <HI>Spaniards</HI> slain.</NOTE> where he found the <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrison utterly destroy'd, and the Royal Fort burnt down to the Ground, and lying in a heap of Ashes. Then they fired several Guns, to give notice, that if any of them had conceal'd themselves, and lay sculking in the Woods, or otherwise, they should discover themselves, and come to the succour of their Friends: But all in vain, for none came; for as they were afterwards inform'd, the Inhabitants had slain them, because of their insupportable behavior, insolently commit∣ting Robberies, Rapes, and Murders: Hereupon he sent Messengers to the King <HI>Guaccanarillo,</HI> to inquire why they had fired his Fort, and what they had done with his Men, who brought him this Return, That over that mighty Island were many Princes, of which two being provok'd by the reports of the Strangers that were entertain'd in the Island, came marching upon them, each with their Armies; but that he endeavor'd what he could, and came with a Power to assist the Strangers; yet all he got for his Kindness, was a Wound in his Leg, which had been so sore and troublesom, that forc'd him to keep his Bed, and no less than seven Concubines to attend him, and dress the Wound: But he told his Tale so ill, and feign'd his Lameness worse, that <HI>Sibilius,</HI> one of the Messengers sent by <HI>Columbus,</HI> lifting up the Coverlet, saw that he ail'd nothing, which soon confirm'd his doubt, that he was confederated with the rest, and alike guilty of the Slaughter. At last <HI>Guaccanarillo</HI> being desir'd, came in Person to <HI>Columbus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Discourse with the King <HI>Guaccanarillo.</HI></NOTE> in whose presence he held a long Discourse with an <HI>In∣dian</HI> Woman, which they had brought from the Island of <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> there Christned by the Name of <HI>Catharine:</HI> At length <HI>Guaccanarillo</HI> was dismiss'd, and the Night following this <HI>Catharine,</HI> with seven more of the <HI>Indian</HI> Women, leap'd over-board, and swom almost a League to Shore, so going thence di∣rectly to their King <HI>Guaccanarillo.</HI> This Accident gave more suspicion to <HI>Co∣lumbus,</HI> who thereupon sent three hundred Men, commanded by <HI>Melchior, Hoi∣eda,</HI> and <HI>Gorvalano,</HI> to march through the Island three several ways, and with special Commission to secure as their Prisoner <HI>Guaccanarillo. Melchior</HI> discover'd a wide River, full of Reaches and winding Bays, gliding between high Hills cover'd with Woods, resounding with the ecchoing noises of harmonious
<PB N="48" REF="33"/>Birds, and disemboguing his Waters, enlarg'd by two other Rivers, into the Sea, so making a convenient Harbor for Ships. Here a hundred of the Island∣ers, well Arm'd after their manner, met them, crying aloud, <HI>We are no</HI> Canni∣bals, <HI>but</HI> Taynos, that is, <HI>a People more civil than they are cruel.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> ma∣king Signs of Peace, the <HI>Taynos</HI> approach'd, and joyn'd their Forces in a friend∣ly manner. Near the place of this Meeting appear'd a House built in an Oval fashion, being thirty two Paces in the Circumference, the Roof curiously pleited of divers colour'd Rushes, round about which stood thirty lesser Dwel∣lings. Mean while, in his March <HI>Hoieda</HI> discover'd a River that descended from a high Mountain, where the Inhabitants gather'd much old after this manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange gathering of Gold.</NOTE> They dig a Hole about two Foot deep; then taking up their left Hand full, of Sand, with their right Hand they cull out the precious Ingots, which little accounting of, as they gather'd they dealt away to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Most of the Pieces were as big as Pease, yet some so large, that they weigh'd nine Ounces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dreas. <HI>1.</HI> De Orbe Novo.</NOTE> <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> Councellor to the Emperor <HI>Charles,</HI> tells us, That he hath seen of them in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Court, that were brought over thither by <HI>Columbus.</HI> Moreover, <HI>Hoieda</HI> was inform'd here, That this Gold-River took its Original in the Province belonging to <HI>Cacicus Caunaboa,</HI> signifying, <HI>The King of the Golden Palace.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Columbus</HI> builds a City.</NOTE>Mean time <HI>Columbus</HI> selected a piece of Ground on a rising Hill, on the North part of the Isle, where he intended to build a City, because close by the Hill on one side rises a Mountain, pregnant with Stone and Chalk; on the other, a Plain, so exceeding fruitful and pleasant, that the Sun scarce shines upon a more delightful and fertile Soil, which they found afterwards by ex∣perience. Here Melons are set and ripe in thirty six days; Corn, in two Months;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange fruitfulness there.</NOTE> twice a Year the Trees and Plants bring forth their several Pro∣ducts; the Vines come to maturity, and are loaden with Clusters of Grapes, in two Years, and Sugar-Canes grow as thick as a Mans Arm in fifteen days. On this pleasant Soil, accommodated with a convenient Haven, <HI>Columbus</HI> after∣wards built the City <HI>Isabella,</HI> fortified with Walls and Trenches against all In∣vasions, over which he made his Brother <HI>Bartholomew Columbus</HI> first Governor.</P>
<P>Mean while the Admiral <HI>Columbus</HI> himself march'd up into the Countrey with three hundred Men, in quest of the Gold Mines. Seventy two Leagues the Valley <HI>Cibava</HI> lies distant from <HI>Isabella,</HI> to which <HI>Columbus</HI> pass'd over swift Currents and high Mountains, where he built a Fort, which he call'd <HI>St. Tho∣mas;</HI> and exchang'd with the Inhabitants Toys and Trifles, for Pieces and In∣gots of Gold, which the Inhabitants, as before-mention'd, found in the Sand of their Rivers: And besides, they inform'd him, That about half a days Journey further, greater Quantities of Gold were to be found, in a browner colour'd Soil: Whereupon <HI>Luxanus,</HI> one of his Officers, was sent with a suf∣ficient Party thither, who march'd through a delightful way, cool with shady Boughs, and pleasant with the prospect of spacious Meadows, where they mow'd Grass for their Horses, which in four days time grew up again higher than our tallest Wheat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to Sea to discover new Countreys.</NOTE>Mean time <HI>Columbus</HI> being return'd with great Riches to his new City <HI>Isabel∣la,</HI> went soon after by Sea, with three Vessels, to discover new Countreys more remote; which his Design fell out also successfully; for he fell first up∣on <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where he found more stout Opposition than elsewhere, by the Na∣tives, at his Landing; but finding themselves over-power'd, they came to Agreement, and accepting an amicable Composure, presently struck up a
<PB N="49" REF="33"/>Peace. From thence putting to Sea, he next discover'd <HI>Cuba,</HI> which sailing round about, he found also to be an Island; where Landing in a convenient Harbor, on each fenc'd with a high and jutting Rock, he espied two little Ho∣vels, wherein was abundance of Fish, besides two great Snakes or Serpents, each having eight Feet, spitted, and ready to be laid to the Fire to be roasted; but neither Man, Woman, nor Child to be seen, they being gone with part of the Fish they had dress'd, into the adjacent Woods; whither the <HI>Spaniards</HI> following, saw hanging by small Strings, on the Branches of Trees, abundance of Snakes, some of which had their Mouths tied together, others their Tongue and Teeth pull'd out. Hence marching on, a little beyond they saw a Com∣pany of the Natives, which they judg'd to be about seventy Men, covering the top or summit of a Hill, to whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made Signs, and to entice them near, shew'd several of their gawdy Trifles; but in vain, till at last one adventur'd, descending from the Hill, to whom one of the Natives (who in the first Voyage that the Admiral made, was. taken from the Island <HI>Guanahaini</HI> near <HI>Cuba,</HI> carried to <HI>Spain,</HI> and there Christned) call'd aloud, telling him they need not fear, they should have no harm done them; which said, they came down all together, and inform'd them, That they were sent by their King to catch Fish for another King, which was with him at Dinner; and if they had not eaten the Serpents, they gave them many thanks; for they were provided for the second Course, and very scarce to be got, being a greater Dainty than any Fish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovers not without great Accidents; several New Countreys.</NOTE><HI>Columbus</HI> From hence proceeding on further Westward, discover'd a fruit∣ful Coast, verging the Mouth of a River, whose Water runs boyling hot into the Sea. Somewhat further he saw very strange Fishes, especially the <HI>Guaican,</HI> not unlike an Eel, but with an extraordinary great Head, over which hangs a Skin like a Bag. This Fish is the Natives Fisher; for having a Line or hand∣som Cord fastned about him, so soon as a Turtel, or any other of his Prey, comes above Water, they give him Line; whereupon the <HI>Guaican,</HI> like an Ar∣row
<PB N="50" REF="34"/>out of a Bowe, shoots towards the other Fish, and then gathering the Mouth of the Bag on his Head like a Purse-net holds them so fast, that he lets not loose till hal'd up out of the Water.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having Din'd on delicate Fish, went on still Westward, and came to an uninhabited Isle, but well stor'd with Geese, Pelicans, and ugly Dogs that could not bark. Here they came amongst so many Shoals, that the Keels of their Ships raked upon the Ground almost forty Leagues together, the Water thick and white like Milk. Lastly, they came again into deep Water, and Landed at the Foot of a high Mountain, on the Island <HI>Cuba;</HI> where they found two Springs of very sweet Water. A Musqueteer going into the Woods whilst the rest fill'd their Vessels with Water and cut Wood, he spied a tall Man in a Coat like a white Fryer's Frock; behind whom came two more, and soon after thirty more follow'd, all alike Habited: the Musqueteer running away, they beckned him to stay, but he march'd off; arid informing <HI>Columbus</HI> of his Adventure, he sent a Party well Arm'd to see farther into the Countrey; but they neither saw nor heard any Men, onely found on the other side of the Wood a great Plain, but so overgrown with deep Grass, that it was impossible to get through: The next day he sent out twenty five more, which found no∣thing else than the Prints of the Steps of great Beasts and Lyons, and also abundance of large Grapes, which hung on the Branches of Vines, clasping about the Bodies of the great Trees.</P>
<P>Hence <HI>Columbus</HI> again putting to Sea, and Sailing Westerly, found a Shore overflow'd with Water, and abounding with Pearl-Mussles, and after that the whole Countrey full of Mountains, whose tops smoaked. By this time the Fleet was much damnified by the Shole-water; where, as we mention'd before, they often struck, and their Keels rak'd upon the Ground; so that having sprung several Leaks, and their Provisions growing mouldy with the Damp, they were forc'd to return; and Tacking about they ran against Turtles, which lay as thick in the Sea as if they had been sow'n.</P>
<P><HI>Columbus</HI> now on his return home, and Landing once more on <HI>Cuba,</HI> found an antient Man stark naked, who speaking to him (<HI>Didacus</HI> interpreted, the Language in some part agreeing with that of <HI>Hispaniola</HI>) to this effect:</P>

<PB N="51" REF="34"/>by want of Provisions (not considering themselves) to starve out the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but the mischief fell upon the Contrivers: for so great a Famine hapned, that spreading over the whole Countrey, in a few Moneths fifty thousand were starv'd to death; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made a saving, though hard shift with their own store, then, though too late, the Islanders repented of their folly, for they saw the <HI>Spaniards</HI> making an advantage of their misery, not onely built more Houses in their City <HI>Isabella,</HI> but prepar'd their Weather-beaten Vessels, with which Sailing to, the Gold Mountains of <HI>Cipangi</HI> on the Hill, whence sprung several Fountains, they rais'd the Castle of the <HI>Conception.</HI> Great benefit they reap'd by this Fort, to which they carry'd daily abundance of Amber, Brim∣stone, mix'd Ore of Silver and Gold, and <HI>Brazile</HI>-wood, besides great store of Gold: and they might have gotten ten times more, had they not been so much inclin'd to slothfulness, and minding other vain pleasures: yet notwithstand∣ing all, the Fleet carry'd that year above one thousand two hundred pound weight of Gold to <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spaniards</HI> tyrannise there.</NOTE>In the mean while the Natives complain'd to <HI>Columbus</HI> of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldi∣ers, which under pretence to seek for Gold, committed many insufferable Out∣rages; therefore they desir'd that they might be retain'd in their Forts, and not straggle so much abroad, and they would willingly bring them every three Moneths a certain weight of Cotton; Amber, <HI>Brazile</HI>-wood, and Gold, more than equivalent to what they snatch'd; but Columbus (whose Soldiers, not∣withstanding his severity, and using Martial Law upon some of them for their Crimes, and proud with their success) yet prevail'd at last, that they consented thereto; but the Inhabitants never perform'd their promise, who being almost famish'd, had much to do to preserve themselves alive, spending their time in picking Sallads.</P>
<P>Whilst the Business remain'd in this ill posture, or rather confusion, <HI>Cibanus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Conquest.</NOTE> Brother to the imprison'd <HI>Caunaboa,</HI> rais'd an Army of five thousand Men: the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> divided into five Companies, march'd to meet him; and their Enemies being naked, and having no other Arms than Bowes, Arrows, and Clubs, after some little resistance, were soon dissipated and put to flight, but overtaken by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse, many of them were taken Prisoners, and others forc'd to skulk and hide themselves on the tops of Mountains.</P>
<P>Shortly after this Battel hapned a Huricane, mix'd with Thunder-claps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horible Tempest.</NOTE> renting great pieces from the Rocks, and the Wind blowing out of the East, threw down Houses and Trees, some of which were carry'd a vast heighth in∣to the Air; three Ships that rode in the Harbor, broke their new Cables, and split against the Rocks. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> expected nought else, but that with this excessive Tempest the Day of Judgment was at hand. And on the other side, the Islanders ascribed this raging of Heavens to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> wickedness. This Storm past, and the Air setled, <HI>Columbus</HI> gave order for the building of two new Ships there, with which in <HI>March, Anno</HI> 1495. he return'd to <HI>Spain;</HI> where in <HI>Medina del Campo</HI> he gave an account at the Court about the discover'd Coun∣treys; where also Sentence was pass'd on several <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and chiefly con∣cerning the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monk <HI>Boilus,</HI> who out of meer malice pass'd by him at Mass with the Host, while he gave it to others, without any distinction.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Columbus</HI> Sails the third time to <HI>Hispaniola.</HI></NOTE>Whilst all things were thus in disorder at <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> the Admiral <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> set Sail a third time with eight Ships from the Haven <HI>Barrameda,</HI> in the Year 1498. To shun the <HI>French</HI> Pyrates, which watched for the <HI>Indian</HI> Treasures, he directed his Course to <HI>Madera,</HI> a fruitful Island of Corn, Wine, Sugar, Wax, and Cattel, desolate till <HI>Anno</HI> 1420.

The Ground is oftentimes terribly shaken by Earthquakes, and between several sulphurous Places, both Flames and Smoak ascend up to the Sky. Near the City <HI>Angra</HI> is a Fountain which turns Wood into Stone. The Winds in this Place blow so fierce and strong, that they not onely beat down Houses, but wear out Iron, and all manner of Stone-work. In <HI>Angra</HI> the chief Commander of all the <HI>Flemish</HI> Isles hath his Residence. The City, surround∣ed by steep Rocks, lies towards the Sea like a Crescent, or Half-Moon; for at both ends thereof the Mountains extend with deep Points into the Ocean. The uppermost part towards the West stands likewise fortifi'd by a high Rock, as also by another on the East: on both are continual Watches kept; whereof those on the first can discover Ships fifteen Leagues off at Sea, coming either from the <HI>East</HI> or <HI>West-Indies;</HI> and on the other, all those that come from <HI>Europe:</HI> When they see above fifteen Sail, they put out the Kings great Flag upon the top of all the Rock.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Angra</HI> is divided into several Streets: the Governor and Arch∣bishop live each in a stately Palace; five handsom Churches are no small orna∣ment to it; the Sea before it abounds with Fish, but are not to be taken in <HI>December,</HI> by reason of the turbulent Waves.</P>
<P><HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> having refresh'd at <HI>Angra,</HI> Sail'd along the <HI>African</HI> Coast between the <HI>Hesperides:</HI> under the Equinoctial he was so miserably tormented by the Heat, that his Vessels seem'd to burn, the Hoops sprung from the Casks, so that the Water run about the Hold; and they could expect nothing but death from the insufferable Heat, and want of Water: eight days they had endur'd this hardship, when they met with a fresh Gale out of the South-East, so that they made great Way towards the West. On the last of <HI>July</HI> he dis∣cover'd three high Mountains; and approaching near the Shore, he smelt as in a Posie, all the sweet breathings of fragrant Flowers commix'd, and at last saw a convenient Haven; where going ashore he found cultivated Grounds, and steps of Beasts, but not a Man appear'd: the next day they spy'd a Boat with twenty young Men come rowing from the Shore into the Ocean. The Admi∣ral hal'd them in vain to come aboard, for they made the greater hast ashore,
<PB N="54" REF="38"/>still looking about continually with great admiration on the Ships: whereup∣on he commanded them to beat their Drums, and sound their Trumpets, that they might by that means entice them aboard; but they rather taking it as a sign of War, made themselves ready for resistance: mean while the <HI>Spaniards</HI> overtook the <HI>Indian</HI> Boat, into which they threw a Hat, and other trifles; the Islanders amaz'd thereat, made signs to them to row ashore; but soon after they fled.</P>
<P><HI>Columbus</HI> proceeding on his Journey came to <HI>Paria,</HI> where he found a Fish∣ers Pink loaden with Oysters; which opening and taking out the Meat, were found full of Pearls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abundance of Pearl.</NOTE> which because of their abundance were not regarded there; for a broken Dish and a rusty Knife, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had four long Strings of Pearl,</P>
<P>From thence anchoring in the River of <HI>Cumana,</HI> several naked Men came aboard, adorn'd with Golden Armlets, and Strings of Pearl, These inform'd him, that they gather'd their Gold from the Mountains and Rivers, and caught their Pearl-oysters in the adjacent Seas. Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were nobly entertain'd by the King and his Son, who leading them into their Palace, pla∣ced them on Benches of Ebony-wood, curiously wrought, and on a sudden se∣veral Servants came in with variety of Dainties, and well-tasted Wine. But because Provisions grew scarce amongst the Sea-men, and their Meat tainted, <HI>Columbus</HI> thought it convenient to leave the Pearl-trade till some better opportu∣nity. Then setting forward, the farther he went, the shallower he found the Sea, insomuch that his Ship scarce had Water enough to swim. This inconveni∣ence was followed by a second; for the Sea being full of Weeds and Grass, scarce suffer'd any Passage. A River thirty Yards deep, and twenty Leagues broad, came rushing out betwixt two Shores into this Sea with such force, that the Waves went high like Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Columbus</HI> is in great danger.</NOTE> which made <HI>Columbus</HI> judge himself in the greatest danger imaginable, and withall Tack about; so that he came on the eight and twentieth of <HI>August Anno</HI> 1498. to an Anchor before <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where all things were still in a sad confusion, as we before related.</P>

<P>After this <HI>Pinzon</HI> discover'd a wide, but shallow River; where Landing, on a Hill he met a great company of <HI>Americans:</HI> He, to invite them to Trade, threw them a Shell; in return for which they cast him a lump of Gold; which when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> went to take up they all fell upon him;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pinzon</HI>'s strange Fight.</NOTE> and indeed he could not have defended himself long, had not some of his Company quickly

<P>This Captain having Sail'd six hundred Leagues along the <HI>Parian</HI> Coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Storm.</NOTE> in a great Tempest two of his Carvils in his view were overset, their Keels turn'd upward; the third driven from her Anchor, and the fourth so shaken, and full of Leaks, that ready to sink they ran her ashore to save their lives; and though he escaped himself the danger of drowning, then being ashore, yet he was no ways freed from far greater inconveniences; for he saw nothing but death either for want of Provisions, or barbarousness of the Inhabitants: whereupon they resolv'd to free themselves of their miseries by self-slaughter, killing one another; but some better advised to spend their Lives like <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> upon the unbelieving Salvages: Whilst they were in this desperate condi∣tion, the Storm ceased, and Providence presented their safety, the Ship driving in before the Wind; at which every one taking fresh courage, they mended the two shatter'd Ships as well as they could; wherein venturing to Sea, and setting Sail, they came on the last of <HI>September, Anno</HI> 1500. into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Haven <HI>Palos.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>The Expedition of</HI> Americus Vesputius.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AMericus Vesputius</HI> a <HI>Florentine,</HI> Commanded four Ships, fitted out at King <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s Charge, set Sail the twentieth of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 1497. and refresh∣ing at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> from thence he steer'd to <HI>Paria;</HI> where he so much gain'd upon the Inhabitants, that for Pins, Bells, Looking-glasses, and other Trifles, they daily brought aboard in Barter great store of Gold, the best of Mer∣chandise.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the Inha∣bitants in <HI>Paria.</HI></NOTE>These People, both Men and Women go stark naked, not so much as co∣vering their <HI>Pudenda;</HI> their Complexion swarthy; they shave off all their Hair, onely some Women leave a Tuft on their Heads. From their Faces, being broad and flat, one may judge them to be deriv'd from <HI>Tartary;</HI> they much ex∣ceed the <HI>Europeans</HI> in Running and Swimming, insomuch that the Women of∣tentimes without any Boats, or floating pieces of Timber, venture two or three Leagues into the Sea; they have so great skill in Shooting, that they exceed almost all other Nations, having Arrows headed with sharp Fish∣bones; they also use Lances and Clubs. The Women follow the Men in the Wars, and serve in stead of Horses to carry Ammunition and other Necessa∣ries; to which Labor they are so us'd, that they will bear on their Shoulders forty, nay fifty Leagues together, such Luggage, as three <HI>Spaniards</HI> are scarce able to lift from the Ground.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their strange Customs.</NOTE> They acknowledge no Commander or Supe∣rior either in Wars or Government; they keep up old Feuds, fighting with an inveterate hatred against their Neighbors, upon antient scores and revenges, still kept in memory of their Relations slain in former Battels; and also still creating fresh animosities upon their Losses in later Engagements. Their Language is smooth and pleasing, being spoken with a kind of lisping, and absolutely different from the neighboring Nations. When they eat they sit upon the Ground, and sleeping lie in Hammocks, each end whereof being fast∣ned to a Post; underneath they kindle a Fire; over them they hang Fish-nets and Hooks, Fish-baskets and <HI>Calabashes.</HI> When they have occasion to ease Na∣ture by evacuation, they retire into some private Place; but the Women think it no immodesty to make Water, even in the presence of strange Men. They observe riot single Matrimony; for every Man takes as many Women as he pleases, under bonds of Wedlock such and so sleight, that he turns them off at his pleasure: and Women take the same liberty in casheering their Husbands when not pleasing them. They bring forth Children with little or no pain, and wash them in a River so soon as born; which done they return to their usual work and business. When they are incens'd against their Husbands, they revenge themselves by poysoning their Children. Their Houses are built in the fashion of a House-clock, with a Roof rais'd from the Wall upon four Pil∣lars like the Bell, and cover'd with Palm-Leaves; some of which are so big, that they afford room for six hundred Men: every seventh or eighth year they remove, because (as they say) the Air is oftentimes infected by Mens Breaths, by their long continuance in one place. Their Riches consist in Feathers of divers colours, Strings of Fish-bones intermingled with green and white Beads, with which they adorn their Heads, Arms, Legs, Ears, and Cheeks: Gold and Pearls they make little account of; and as to Trade and Commerce

Their Dead they bury in moist Grounds, and put with them both Meat and Drink into the Graves: When any Person grows very weak by lingring Sickness, they carry the Diseased into a neighboring Wood, where they lay him in a Silk Hammock, tied between two Trees; then dancing the whole day about him, at night they set Bread and Water enough by him to last four days, and then de∣parting look no more after him, who thus neglected seldom escape: but if so it happen that one recover, all his Relations for the future honour him as a god. When any one falls into a Fever, his Friends immediately bathe him in cold Water, and afterwards set him before a great Fire, then drive him before them till he falls down almost breathless, and at last put him to Bed. They neither Let blood in the Arms nor Feet, but in their Sides and Calves of their Legs. Sometime they fast four days together, which they suppose a great means to preserve their Health. Their Bread consists of a sort of Fruit call'd <HI>Jucha, Chambi,</HI> or <HI>Igname.</HI> Laftly, no Lyon devours his Prey with more voraci∣ous eagerness, than they their taken Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Vesputius</HI> being fully inform'd concerning the Situation of <HI>Paria,</HI> weighed Anchor, and on the sixth day after entred a convenient Harbor, where going ashore, he found twenty Houses built in the middle of a Lake on great Posts:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A very strange Village built on Poles.</NOTE> every House had a Draw-bridge, over which they pass'd from one to the other. So soon as the Inhabitants set eye on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they immediately drew up their Bridges: yet some of them in twelve little <HI>Canoos</HI> came towards the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Ships, but amaz'd to see their Looms so big, durst not, though hal'd with signs, to come aboard, but hasted away to a high Mountain; yet seem'd to sig∣nifie that they would return, as indeed they did, bringing sixteen Maids along with them, of which they put four into a <HI>Spanish</HI> Boat, themselves in the inte∣rim rowing between the Ships from one to another, shewing all tokens of friendship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Fight.</NOTE> when on a sudden a Company of old Women came running to the Shore, and tearing the Hair from their Heads, made a terrible noise and excla∣mation, expressing the greatest sorrow they could possible: whereupon the four <HI>Indian</HI> Maids suddenly leap'd over-board, and the Men shot abundance of Arrows out of their Boats at the Ships; nay, some of them swimming under Water, endeavor'd to sink the Cock-boats which were made fast behind their Ships. Upon this sudden Onset the <HI>Spaniards</HI> making use of their Guns, quick∣ly lessen'd the number of the Assailants, insomuch that they fled to the Shore; yet five of them being overtaken, were carry'd Prisoners aboard.</P>
<P><HI>Vesputius</HI> observing these their misdemeaning Carriages, judg'd it no way convenient to stay any longer among such barbarous and deceitful Salvages: but having weighed Anchor, and Sail'd eighty Leagues along the Coast, he ran into another convenient Haven, whose Shore swarm'd with People, which on a sudden running away, hid themselves in a neighboring Wood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpents strangely pre∣par'd for Food.</NOTE>Here the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Landing were amazed, when in their Huts they saw Snakes and Serpents roasting before a Fire, whereof one had Wings, and ano∣ther whose Mouth was tied together with a Rope, stared with open eyes in a frightful manner.</P>
<P>Here they left several Trifles to entice the fled Natives to correspond with them. And this their Design prov'd successful; for the next day the <HI>Americans</HI> came aboard without the least fear, and offer'd to shew their hospitable kind∣ness to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if they pleas'd to travel three days Journey with them up
<PB N="62" REF="43"/>into the Countrey, telling them, they had onely rais'd those few Huts by the Sea-side for a small time whilst they Fish'd in those Parts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The remarkable recepti∣on of twenty three <HI>Spani∣ards.</HI></NOTE>About twenty of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> well Arm'd resolv'd to undertake the Jour∣ney; and travelling over Hills, Dales, and Rivers, they came at last into a Village consisting of nine of the foremention'd Houses, but mightily peopled▪ where they were in a wonderful manner received by their glad welcomes, by Dancing, Singing, Hunting, and other joyful Acclamations, presenting their Wives and Daughters, as the chiefest part of their hospitality, to caress the Strangers at their pleasure. The news was no sooner spread, but the adjacent Villages came in throngs to gaze upon, and salute the Strangers, inviting them also to their Towns. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> taking it in good part, spent nine days among them, highly treated with all manner of jollities, but especially at their choice with the varieties of <HI>Venus:</HI> from thence then returning to their Fleet, accompanied with thousands of the Natives, every one carrying Presents to the Admiral <HI>Vesputius</HI> of whom as many as they could at once receive, they enter∣taining aboard, then dismiss'd them, and admitted others; but the Guns going off, they suddenly leap'd from the Decks, and div'd like Ducks under Water: But afterwards being inform'd, that such thunder-claps were sent them from Heaven to destroy their Enemies, they were somewhat better satisfi'd, and call'd the <HI>Spaniards, Charabi,</HI> that is, <HI>Wise Men.</HI></P>
<P>This Island lying in the <HI>Mexican</HI> Bay, in twenty Degrees of Northern Lati∣tude, <HI>Vesputius</HI> left on his Starboard, and Sail'd along a Meandring Coast (which he always kept in sight) eight hundred and sixty Leagues, and at last entred a Haven, the like whereof he had not seen before. Here he spent a Moneth in repairing his Ships, to which the Inhabitants freely gave their assi∣stance; and among other things complain'd, that a salvage People came yearly thither from an Island about a hundred Leagues distant, who fell upon them with horrible rage, and whomsoever they took they eat, but first inflicted all manner of tortures upon them, sparing none, but together murthering aged People and sucking Infants; wherefore they crav'd assistance to be reveng'd, which if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would grant, they would follow the Fleet with their Boats. <HI>Vesputius</HI> promis'd his aid to destroy such a blood-thirsty People; and to assure them that he would perform his Word, he order'd seven of them to go in <HI>Canoos</HI> before and shew them the Way. On the seventh day they came to an Anchor before the Island <HI>Hy,</HI> where the Shore was guarded with naked Men, whose Bodies being strong and brawny, were painted, and their Arms, Legs, and Head, adorn'd with divers colour'd Plumes, having not onely offen∣sive Weapons, as Bowes, Arrows, and Launces, but also defensive, huge Tar∣gets, and square Shields. So soon as they judg'd the approaching <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be within reach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A cruel Fight with the Cannibals.</NOTE> they shot a great flight of Arrows at them; but <HI>Vesputius</HI> lying close along the Shore with his Ships, fir'd upon them with Chain-shot, which did great execution: yet notwithstanding about forty <HI>Spaniards</HI> leaping ashore out of their Boats, found themselves in no small danger; for the Cannibals upon the sound of Horns flocking together, so press'd upon them that they were forc'd to lay aside their Gans, and fall to Blows, and had not timely as∣sistance come to them, they had undoubtedly been all slain: two hours the Victory was doubtful on whose side it would fall; yet at last the Cannibals quitting the Field, left the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Victors; who the next day pursu'd their gotten Victory with such success, that they drove their Enemies before them, burnt their Villages and Boats, and carry'd two hundred and two and twenty
<PB N="63" REF="43"/>of them Prisoners to <HI>Spain,</HI> where they safely arriv'd the 15. of <HI>November, Anno</HI> 1498.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vesputius</HI> second Expedi∣tion.</NOTE>This good success so encourag'd <HI>Vesputius,</HI> that having stay'd scarce seven Moneths ashore, he obtaining the Command over six Ships, with which he set Sail from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and touching upon the <HI>Canaries,</HI> Steer'd from thence Southerly; and having Sail'd five hundred Leagues, he discover'd a Countrey overflow'd and made Marishy by great Rivers, and abounding with Trees, but saw no sign of any Inhabitants; yet not long after, coming before an Island, he took a Boat with two Prisoners, newly guelt, and sent as a Present to feast the <HI>Cannibals,</HI> which refus'd to Treat on any other account whatsoever; where∣fore he Sail'd eighty Leagues forward along the Shore of an unknown Island, where he Barter'd for some Gold, and got five hundred Pearls for one single Shell; these Pearls, the Inhabitants said were not found there, but taken from their Neighboring Enemies, which liv'd Westward, and had abundance of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange constitution of, a salvage people.</NOTE>Nothing worthy of remark happen'd in this Voyage, onely the strange con∣stitutions of a wild People, living on a barren Isle, deserve to be mention'd.</P>
<P>About their Necks hung two hollow Vessels, the one full of white stamp'd Worts, and Herbs; and the other, full of Grass, which they greedily cram'd into their Mouths, feeding like Cattel; then a Stick wetted with Spittle, they put into the bruis'd Herbs, taking upon the end of it, as upon the point of a Knife, some of the bruis'd to their Mouths, which (as if chawing the Cud) turn∣ing therein, then taking out again, and strowing more of the same Herbs out of the Vessel upon it, swallow'd it down. No fresh Water was to be had amongst them, but what they gather'd from the Dew in great Leaves: Neither had they any Houses, but dwelt under great Trees, and fed on dry'd Fish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange adventure of nine <HI>Spaniards,</HI> meeting with great Giants.</NOTE>The next remark in this Voyage, was the discovery of an Island not far from the former, where he found the Footsteps of a Gigantick People, upon which nine <HI>Spaniards</HI> went a League to search the Countrey, where they saw five great Huts, standing in a spacious Valley, and in them two old, and three young Women, each of them being twice as tall as an ordinary Man: The old ones invited the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to eat, who when they were fat down, consult∣ing how they might take and carry one of these Giantesses to <HI>Spain,</HI> there to shew her for Money, thirty six Giants came in to them, (never did the Sun shine on a more terrible People) which so amaz'd the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that their Hair seem'd to stand an end at the fear thereof: Every Giant was arm'd with a Bow and Arrows, and a Club: They wondering at the nine strangers, stood talking very earnestly one to another, which gave the <HI>Spaniards</HI> time to think of making their escape; some judg'd it convenient to discharge their Guns up∣on them, and in the Smoke to run away; others thought, that it would be bet∣ter to take a milder course, which they all agreed on; and taking their leave, went out of the Hut, but were follow'd by the Giants, who kept a Stones cast behind them, and went faster or slower, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> slacken'd or mended their pace; who at last getting to the Shore, and from thence into their Boats, they suddenly put off; but the Giants then pursu'd them with eager speed, all of them leaping into the Water, and Swimming, shot abundance of Arrows after them; but frighted by the Thunder of two great Guns that were dis∣charged from the Ships, return'd ashore, and fled into the neighboring Hills.</P>

<P><HI>Vesputius</HI> at last began to consider of returning home, his Provisions begin∣ning to grow scarce, and his Sea-men faint, having continu'd in the Equino∣ctial heats a whole year; wherefore he directed his course towards <HI>Spain,</HI> in his Voyage, driving along the Coast an advantagious Trade, by bartering Shells and Glass for Pearls.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Pearl-Oysters.</NOTE> The Inhabitants presented him with Oysters, of which some inclos'd one hundred and thirty Pearls; when they attain to their full growth, they fall out of the Shells themselves, but those that stick, decay. So upon the tenth of <HI>November,</HI> the Fleet came safe to an Anchor before <HI>Cadiz.</HI> After which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vesputius</HI> third Expedi∣tion.</NOTE> <HI>Vesputius</HI> retired to <HI>Sevil,</HI> with intent to settle himself there, but he had not long repos'd, when <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> sent for him to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and gave him the Command of three Ships, to discover new Countreys; be∣tween the <HI>Canaries</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> they pass'd thorow so many Fishes (not unlike a Bream) that in an hours time they loaded their Boats with them; this Fish hath a round, thin Scale, sharp Teeth, Stones in their Brains or Foreheads, a sharp pointed Heart, a Bladder full of Wind, red Tail and Fins, feeds on Sea Weeds, Gurnets and Oysters, and is of a delicious Taste.</P>
<P>From thence, five degrees Southward of the Equinox, he found a naked People on the top of a high Rock, that beckon'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to come towards them; upon which, two of them resolv'd to venture thither, having order not to stay at the most above five days:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruel deed of some <HI>Indi∣an</HI> Women.</NOTE> The first incounter they had was of some Women, who offer'd their bodies to prostitution; but a Youth, as if affrighted with some sudden danger, came running amongst them, whom, whilst they stood gazing upon, and wondering at, an old Woman with a great Club, run∣ning down the Hill overtook, and knock'd him down dead upon the ground; which done, the Women that were making Court to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> took him by the Heels, and dragg'd up the Hill, where soon after they saw him chop'd in pieces, Broyl'd, and eaten: They also made signs to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they would devour them also in the same manner. The Shore was crouded with Men, which showr'd upon them several flights of Arrows; wherefore they thought it best to Weigh Anchor, so taking Aboard their two Men, and having Sail'd 150.

<PB N="67" REF="45"/>able to handle their Arms, the Salvages slew them at their pleasure, by this means in a short time, of seven hundred eighty five, remain'd scarce ninety; yet did not all this misery work any thing upon the ambitious humor of <HI>Vas∣ques Nunnez,</HI> who rebelling against <HI>Ancisus,</HI> split that small remainder of Men, and with the help of those he had drawn over to his Party, made himself Go∣vernor of <HI>Uraba,</HI> not possible to be long enjoy'd without speedy supply, which soon after they receiv'd; for <HI>Colmenares</HI> Sailing from <HI>Hispaniola</HI> with Provisions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colmenares</HI> Expedition.</NOTE> arriv'd there the 15. of <HI>October, Anno</HI> 1510. having been toss'd twenty three days at Sea; then making into the River <HI>Gaira,</HI> to furnish himself with fresh Wa∣ter, he lost forty seven Men; for whilst they were filling their Casks, seven hundred of the Salvages came down upon them, and with their Poyson'd Arrows wounded and kill'd most of them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His strange reception.</NOTE> <HI>Colmenares</HI> came in a good time to the remainder under <HI>Ancisus</HI> Command, being in danger of death for want of Provisions, and finding the factions that were among them about Superiority, he thought it fit, consulting with some of the chiefest of them, to find out <HI>Ni∣cuesa,</HI> who was indeed the Governor that had the Grant from the King: This agreed, <HI>Colmenares</HI> went to search, and at last lighted upon him, building a For∣tress against the assaults of the Enemies on the Promontory. <HI>Mormor,</HI> he was glad to find him, but griev'd to see the misery and hardship they endur'd, most of his Men being kill'd, partly by the excessive Heats, partly by Famine, and partly by the cruelty of the Natives, so that he had onely sixty remaining, and those many of them also sick and weak.</P>
<P><HI>Colmenares</HI> having deliver'd his Message, <HI>Nicuesa</HI> broke up his Quarters, and sleighting the Fort, went with him, but both himself and his Men were op∣pos'd from Landing by <HI>Nunnez;</HI> wherefore <HI>Nicuesa</HI> was necessitated to Steer for <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> whom, or what became of him was never known.</P>
<P><HI>Nunnez</HI> having thus quitted himself of <HI>Nicuesa,</HI> and now, more than ever, wanting Provision, he resolv'd to take out his own Commission at large, and setting up for himself, make no discrimination of Persons, <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or Na∣tives, but to make out his Fortune.</P>
<P>And first, he fell upon <HI>Careta</HI> King of <HI>Coita,</HI> whom he took Prisoner, Plunder∣ing him of all his Treasure and Provisions; yet this sufficed not long, for soon after, King <HI>Poncha</HI> invading <HI>Careta, Nunnez</HI> took hold of that opportunity, and pretending to assist <HI>Careta,</HI> being well recruited with his Forces, set upon <HI>Pon∣cha,</HI> who immediately fled, and left all to the spoil of his Enemies.</P>
<P>This News so amaz'd <HI>Comogrus,</HI> another King, that he proffer'd Peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable Pallace of King <HI>Comogrus.</HI></NOTE> where∣upon <HI>Nunnez</HI> going thither, was nobly entertain'd in his Palace, being one hun∣dred and fifty Paces long, and eighty broad, the Floors Pav'd with Stone, and the Roofs Vaulted, his Cellars were stor'd with Wine, made of the Root <HI>Jucca, Ages,</HI> and <HI>Mais;</HI> the Privy-Chamber was hung round with dead bodies, Mummy'd artificially with Lent Fires, and were the Corpses of <HI>Comogrus</HI> Ance∣stors, and others of the Royal Blood, and nearest Relations, of whom some dy'd at least four hundred years before; each of these fasten'd by Cordage made of Reeds, were Habited in Cotton, richly adorn'd with Pearls and Gold. Mean while, a Hurricane happening, terrible with Thunder and Lightning, and hideous Gusts, swell'd and so enrag'd the Sea, that breaking its bounds, over-running, drown'd the whole Champain; thus the hopes of a fruitful Har∣vest being utterly lost, they suffer'd under a great Famine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> which Encamp'd near the River <HI>Daria,</HI> on <HI>Uraba,</HI> perceiving this, and knowing they had no manner of supply from <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and having

Here were many Flitter Mice, or Bats, bigger than Turtle Doves, whose biting was mortal, unless immediately wash'd with Salt Wa∣ter, according to the information of the Prisoners.</P>
<P>Now as <HI>Nunnez Uraba</HI> Pillag'd towards the South, so did <HI>Colmenares,</HI> setting up also for himself, make prize of all, to the East with sixty Men, Rowing against the Stream up the River <HI>Daria,</HI> above twelve Leagues, where he found in several Villages and Hamlets, and at King <HI>Turvi</HI>'s Palace, abundance, both of Provision and Gold; from thence he March'd to the mighty Province <HI>Abe∣namchei,</HI> which though making some resistance, at last they subdu'd.</P>

<P><HI>Nunnez,</HI> amongst his other Slavesses, had one exceeding beautiful, on which he was much Enamour'd, and she likewise seem'd to bear as great an affection towards him, which she manifested, by declaring the secret to <HI>Nunnez</HI> which her Brother had imparted to her, being an intended gene∣ral Massacre the night following, that so she might the better make her es∣cape the day before; yet so much she prefer'd the safety of her Lover, before the liberty of her Native Countrey, that she discover'd the Plot. <HI>Nunnez</HI> not sleeping on this advice, on a sudden set so fiercely upon the Conspirators, that he utterly broke their design; yet the Feuds and Contests for Superiority still continu'd amongst them, which look'd with so had a Face to the ruine of all, that news thereof arriving in <HI>Spain,</HI> it was judg'd fit to send for <HI>Colmenares,</HI> and <HI>John Quicedo</HI> to the Court, there to render an account of all their Transactions, Both going Aboard a small Vessel, were by Storm driven on the Coast of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where they were inform'd from a Prisoner, that <HI>Valdivia</HI> and <HI>Zamudio,</HI> driven ashore by Shipwrack, and not able to defend themselves, were surpriz'd by

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Peter Arias <HI>his Expedition, and remarkable Passages of</HI> Vascus Nunnez.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PEter Arias</HI> Knight, accompany'd with his Wife, <HI>Elizabeth Boadilla,</HI> set Sail <HI>Anno</HI> 1514. but surpriz'd by a violent Storm, lost two Ships, and return'd to <HI>Spain,</HI> yet not long after began his Voyage afresh, notwithstanding he had lately had such bad success, and heard of the great hardship which <HI>Nicuesa</HI> suf∣fer'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nicuesa</HI> suffers hunger.</NOTE> having not onely kept himself alive a considerable time by feeding on flesh of Dogs, and other such like Creatures; a great Frog being sold in <HI>Vera∣gua</HI> for a lump of Gold.</P>
<P>But <HI>Vaschus Nunnez</HI> inform'd of <HI>Arias</HI> arrival, the chief Governor of <HI>Uraba,</HI> afterwards call'd <HI>New Andaluzia,</HI> minding to inrich himself before he should de∣pose him, and hearing that several Gold Mines lay Southward from <HI>Uraba,</HI> march'd thither with a hundred and ninety Men, thorow great Rivers, Thick∣ets, and Woods full of Wild Beasts, deep Vallies, and broad Rivers, not with∣out many hazards and difficulties. In the Mountainous Territory <HI>Quarequan,</HI> the Inhabitants ingag'd him valiantly, with Bows, Arrows, Clubs, Woodden Swords, Pikes and Launces, but frighted with the meer report of their Mus∣quets, like flocks of wild Fowl, dissipated and fled, but not so fast, but that six hundred of them fell by the hands of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or were worry'd by their Dogs, train'd up on purpose for the <HI>American</HI> Wars. Soon after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dogs us'd in the Wars.</NOTE> coming into the Palace, there sate his Brother dress'd up in Womens Apparel, whom the King kept to abuse, as if a Concubine; whereof <HI>Nunnez</HI> being inform'd, in detesta∣tion of Sodomy, set the Dogs upon him, who suddenly tore him in pieces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sodomy horribly punish'd.</NOTE> Amongst the slain were found several <HI>Negroes,</HI> which suffering Shipwrack had been cast on the <HI>American</HI> Shore, and maintain'd a continual War with the <HI>Qua∣raquanen,</HI> so that it seem'd the <HI>Blacks</HI> which were found dead amongst them were their Slaves: Yet <HI>Nunnez</HI> was forc'd to leave a considerable number of his Men here, who being half starv'd, and quite tired out, were not able to follow him; but with the remaining party he march'd on,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nunnez</HI> first discovers the South-Sea.</NOTE> and at last came to the high Mountains, from whence he saw the great South-Sea, and going thi∣ther,

After the Battel, the Conqueror proffer'd Peace, which was agreed on, upon the delivery of several great Presents of Gold. Af∣ter that, <HI>Chiapes</HI> the King, accompany'd with <HI>Nunnez</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Commander, and March'd with him over a broad River to <HI>Coquera,</HI> where at first some For∣ces made resistance, but were routed; whereupon, they also suddenly struck up a Peace, upon conditions, that the Prince, nam'd also <HI>Coquera,</HI> should return him a great quantity of Gold.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is in great danger on the South-Sea.</NOTE> Here he found a handsome Bay running up in crooked Reaches, above sixty Leagues, which <HI>Nunnez</HI> call'd St. <HI>Michael,</HI> being sprinkled with Islands, and treacherous with hidden Rocks. There <HI>Nunnez,</HI> (though disswaded by <HI>Chiapes,</HI> because he knew the South-Sea at that time be∣ing the three last Moneths of the Year, was exceeding turbulent, that no Vessel could hardly live in it, yet) ventur'd with nine <HI>Indian</HI> Boats, and eighty Men from the Shore into the <HI>Offin;</HI> where, notwithstanding the high rolling of the Waves, he got to an uninhabited Island, on which, being necessitated to stay a night, the Tide flow'd so much, according to the property of the South-Sea, that the highest Ground thereon, lay almost cover'd with Water, every one of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having enough to do to save themselves from being wash'd away. Day approaching, discover'd a second inconveniency, for the <HI>Indian Canoos</HI> ei∣ther were extremely Leaky, or else so shatter'd, that they were unfit for service; yet notwithstanding all this, they ventur'd to return, rather choosing to be de∣vour'd in the Waves, than die of that hunger, whose misery they had suffici∣ently tasted, during the small time they had been out. Not long after, <HI>Nunnez</HI> Conquer'd the King <HI>Tamaccus</HI> in a Field Battel, who thereupon purchas'd his Peace with great Presents of Gold and Pearl. He also shew'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> an
<PB N="71" REF="47"/>Island, whose spiring tops were seen from the Main Land, which so abounded in Pearls, that in no place were either more or fairer to be found: But the King who liv'd on it was exceeding powerful.</P>
<P><HI>Nunnez</HI> immediately resolv'd to Sail thither, notwithstanding it was the middle of <HI>October,</HI> when the South-East Winds make such a turbulent and hol∣low Sea, as many times wash'd away Trees and pieces of Rocks: Besides, the Weather was more terrible, by continual Lightning and great Thunder-Claps; the Nights very cold; the Days exceeding hot; yet all these difficulties could not prevail, for <HI>Nunnez</HI> would not stay to expect fairer Weather, but went on, and coming thither, he saw how the <HI>Indians</HI> Fish for Pearls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Fishing for Pearls.</NOTE> which was Diving for Oysters; but the Weather being rough and foul, they durst not venture for the best which lay far from the Shore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nunnez</HI> returns.</NOTE>But <HI>Nunnez</HI> leaving his sick and weary'd Men with <HI>Chiapes,</HI> March'd quite another way back than he came; and crossing a great River, was receiv'd by Prince <HI>Teaocha,</HI> who furnish'd him with Gold, Pearls, Provisions, and Guides, which carry'd his Luggage and Goods.</P>
<P><HI>Pacra,</HI> a great Oppressor of all his Neighbors, hearing of the approach of <HI>Nunnez,</HI> fled, but terrifi'd with threats, return'd with three other Princes, which were all so Deform'd, that more horrible Monsters were never seen, scarce any part about them resembling those of a Man:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pacra</HI> a tyrannous King, his horrible death.</NOTE> The Guides which <HI>Teaocha</HI> had provided for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> desir'd that he might be put to Death, for the Cruelties which he had long committed; whose Request being granted, he with the other three Princes, were given as a Breakfast to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Doggs. Mean while, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were in danger to have perish'd for want of Water; yet at last, in a Thicket of Brambles, they found a small Brook, but none of the <HI>Indians</HI> durst venture to go to it, for fear of Tygers, and other Wild Beasts; relating, That the Tygers took many people in the nights out of their Huts, if they were not careful in making fast their Doors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange relation of Ty∣ger.</NOTE><HI>John Ledesma</HI> had himself eaten part of a Tyger, which for six Moneths toge∣ther, had every night feasted on Mans flesh, or Beasts, which they caught in this manner: In the Path along which he pass'd, coming out of his Den to seek for Prey, a deep Pit was digg'd, and cover'd very sleightly on the top, into which the Tyger fell; yet though taken, so fiercely withstood the Pikes, Darts, and Stones thrown at him, that every one was amaz'd to see the fury of the Beast. After that they sought for the Female, but found onely two young ones with∣out a Dam, which taking along with them, they put Iron Collars about their Necks, intending to carry them to <HI>Spain;</HI> but seeing no likelyhood of breed∣ing them up, they brought them back again, purposing to fetch them away when grown somewhat older, and accordingly coming afterwards to look for them, they found the Den empty, so that it was supposed they had been de∣vour'd by their Dam.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nunnez</HI> further Journey into the Countrey, very re∣markable.</NOTE>In the Province of <HI>Bononiama,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> inrich'd themselves with Chains, and Breast-Plates of Gold, which in great plenty hung on the Walls in every House: At the River <HI>Comogrus,</HI> they discharg'd <HI>Teaocha</HI>'s Guides, and made use of <HI>Cotog</HI> and <HI>Ciuriza,</HI> two Governors of a barren Tract of Land, full of Hills and Mountains, which they left on their right Hand, and wandred three days over a <HI>Morasse,</HI> in which they often sunk to their Knees.</P>
<P>In all these Travels, Victual was so scarce that they were much weaken'd by their wants; and though they took fresh courage when they got footing on King <HI>Buchebua</HI>'s Jurisdiction, yet they found nothing but empty Huts; and the

But although they could not fur∣nish <HI>Nunnez</HI> with Provisions, they presented him with weighty Ingots of Gold: but this rich Metal not able to purchase the least morsel of Bread, drove them into a great strait; and indeed they had without doubt been all famished, had not <HI>Pocchorosa,</HI> mother King, fed them forty days together with stamp'd Roots. Thus refresh'd, and instigated by <HI>Pocchorosa,</HI> they broke by night in <HI>Tubunama</HI>'s Palace, and took him Prisoner with eighty Concubines, who fearing to be put to death, gave an incredible Treasure of Gold to purchase his Ransom.</P>
<P><HI>Nunnez</HI> thus enriched came at last to his People which he had left on the River <HI>Daria,</HI> where two Ships sent from <HI>Hispaniola</HI> rode at an Anchor.</P>

Afterwards anchoring in the Haven <HI>St. Martha,</HI> he receiv'd a great repulse from the Natives, who no ways daunted at the bigness of the Ships, waded up to their Breasts in the Sea, and shot many great flights of poisonous Arrows at the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> of whom two being wound∣ed immediately died. <HI>Arias</HI> sending some of his Men ashore, they found ma∣ny Boats lying full of Nets, made of tough Weeds, and Ropes pleited of Rushes.</P>
<P>In the Haven <HI>St. Martha,</HI> being three Leagues wide, are abundance of Fish, which may be seen under Water twenty Fathom deep.</P>
<P>But now the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were ashore breaking into the Houses, and taking Women and Children Prisoners, the <HI>Americans</HI> prepar'd for another Fight, which at the beginning was very fierce; but at last they were forc'd to quit the Field.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Houses and Houshold-stuff.</NOTE>Their Houses and Furniture in them are worthy of observation: their Cie∣lings being cover'd with Shells strung on small Thred, which make a pleasing noise, when mov'd by the least breath of Wind. The Walls are hung with fine Stuffs, woven full of Imagery, as Cranes, Lyons, Tygers, and some Figures of Men; the Floors are cover'd with parti-colour'd Mats, made of Sea-Reeds, and several tough Roots; and their Carpets beset with Pearl add also a great beauty to their Rooms.</P>
<P>In the Valleys the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found several precious Jems, as Saphires, Jas∣per, Emeralds, and great pieces of Amber, and in some Huts, Baskets, and Chests full of dry'd Locusts, and Crabs.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange way to catch Parrots.</NOTE>The <HI>Indian</HI> where the Parrots are most frequent climbs into a Tree, and chattering like them, with his Voice imitating their Notes, allures his fellow-prater to draw near, and suffer him to take them in his Hands. But more belongs to the taking of wild Fowl, as Geese, Ducks, Swans, and the like: From the bottom of their standing Pools and Lakes in that Countrey grow Weeds, which spreading upon the Water ripen, and rotting breed Water-Flies, Spiders, and Frogs, upon which the Fowls feed. Near these Pools in the Gardens grow Cabbages as high as Trees, which often dropping into the Water serve the Birds both for Nests and Food: but the skilful Fowler finds it his best way to take one of these Cabbages, and making it hollow in the middle, claps it on his Head like a Helmet, then going into the Water up to his Chin, and passing softly along in such manner, that nothing is seen but the floating Cabbage, and coming near the Birds, he takes them one after another by the Legs, and puts them into a Bag ty'd about his middle for that purpose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Bird <HI>Toucan.</HI></NOTE>But what is more worthy observation is the <HI>American</HI> Bird <HI>Toucan Xochitena∣chate,</HI> having a fleshy Bill, like a Mouth full of Teeth, which continually opens and shuts to draw Breath, having no Nostrils; the Back, Neck, and Wings, are black, the Breast yellow like Gold, the Belly and end of the Tail of a Vermillion colour.</P>

<P>This <HI>Magaglianus,</HI> or <HI>Magellanus,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Portugal,</HI> having perform'd things of great importance for his King, in <HI>Africa,</HI> although with no less trou∣ble than Charge, desir'd an addition of half a Ducket a Moneth added to his Annual Pension; an inconsiderable Sum to make a Request for, yet though so little, was as niggardly deny'd: Whereupon, highly incensed, he study'd no little revenge; to which effect, soon after an opportunity was presented, by means of <HI>Franciscus Serranus,</HI> who writ from <HI>Ternata</HI> to him, that he should speedily come thither, which he soon after did upon this account:</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the Sixth, having fixt Terminaries between the Kings of <HI>Ca∣stile</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> both busie at that time in discovering new Countreys, Or∣der'd, That <HI>Castile</HI> should possess all the Coasts lying to the West of the chief <HI>Meridian,</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> to the East: By vertue of this partition, the rich Spicy <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands fell absolutely to the <HI>Portuguese:</HI> Now <HI>Magellanus</HI> perswaded <HI>Charles the Fifth,</HI> that they might be Sail'd to with a Westerly Course, and there∣fore belong'd to <HI>Castile;</HI> Which advice, <HI>Charles the Fifth</HI> considering, and ap∣proving, Rigg'd out five Ships, with which <HI>Magellanus</HI> set Sail from <HI>Sevil,</HI> the tenth of <HI>August, Anno</HI> 1519. five Moneths he ply'd up and down the Coast in∣habited by the <HI>Patagones,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Giant.</NOTE> where he found none but one single Person, or ra∣ther a Monster, a Giant ten Foot high, who coming Aboard his Ship, devour'd a great Hamper full of Biskets, and at one Draught drunk up nine Pottels of Water.

<P>Here <HI>Cortez</HI> was amaz'd to behold their stately Temples, the Floors whereof were cover'd with Embroyder'd Tapestry, beset with Precious Stones, to which great multitudes flock'd, being very zealous to perform their Devoti∣ons.</P>

The <HI>Zempoalensers</HI> accompanied him in great Troops, hoping by that means to shake off the yoke of the mighty King <HI>Montezuma,</HI> against whom they were then design'd. <HI>Cortez</HI> coming into the Territory of <HI>Sincuchimalar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cortez</HI> his Exploits.</NOTE> was in the Name of <HI>Montezuma,</HI> by one of his Princes, courteously entertain'd in a great Village, scituate on a steep Mountain, without any Path or Way leading to it, but by two high Ladders. <HI>Sincuchimalar</HI> lies surrounded with Hills, whose tops seem to touch the Clouds. Coming down from the Village, they tra∣vell'd through a barren and cold Valley, where they suffer'd such great Incon∣veniences by want of Provisions and Water, and exceeding coldness of the Weather, that many of them perish'd. After that, they ascended a pleasant Hill, on whose summit stood a Chappel, with a handsom Steeple, and hedg'd about with great heaps of Wood, brought thither by the Inhabitants for the use of their Sacrifices. At the foot of this Mountain was a fruitful Valley water'd by a pleasant River, on whose Banks a certain Prince nam'd <HI>Cacatami∣nus</HI> had a Palace, built of Stone, and containing many Rooms, and convenient Lodgings. Somewhat higher to the Land, appear'd more of the like Stru∣ctures, which were all under <HI>Montezuma</HI>'s Jurisdiction; but the neighboring Countrey <HI>Tlaxcalla,</HI> whose Inhabitants were famous for their Valor, would never receive any Laws from <HI>Montezuma.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable War in <HI>Tlaxcalla.</HI></NOTE><HI>Cortez</HI> no sooner set footing in this Countrey, but he was set upon by a thou∣sand of the Inhabitants, who at the first Assault kill'd two of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse, yet after this bold Charge, the Assailants fled, and on the next day desir'd Peace; whereupon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> march'd quietly into the Countrey, when a confus'd Company, or Forlorn-Hope, making a horrible Noise, set upon them; but after a slight Skirmish, they fled to their Main Body, which immediately drawing up, being at least a hundred thousand, hemm'd in the handful of <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> and so were ready to swallow them, leaving them no Angle to escape at. Thus invironed, they were assailed on every side, fighting till Sun-set, and had undoubtedly been utterly destroy'd, had not <HI>Cortez</HI> ply'd his six Pieces of Cannon, discharging continually Volley after Volley upon them; and though the Execution was very much, yet the Sound and report of their Ordinance was more terrible to them that were out of the reach of the Bullet, and made more to the gaining so great a Victory, Fear conquering more than Slaughter; so that by the Evening, despairing either of their Safety or better Fortune, the whole Army disbanding fled: But the pursuing Conquerors firing five of their Villages, remain'd Masters of the Field; yet they, though thus totally routed, taking fresh Courage (a wonderful thing!) reinforc'd them, and set upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Camp, with no less than 150000 Fighting Men: Yet not∣withstanding so vast an Army, <HI>Cortez</HI> so well order'd his small parcel of Men, and so valiantly led on upon all Advantages, that he in like manner defeated this, as they thought, Invincible Preparation. Thus flesh'd with so much Blood of the Natives, he raged every where, giving no Quarter where-ever he went.</P>
<P>Mean while <HI>Quesitangal,</HI> a neighboring Prince, having also raised an Army with which he design'd, being assisted by darkness, craftily to fall into the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Quarters by Night, subtilly dissembling, sent Embassadors the day be∣fore,
<PB N="84" REF="55"/>with several Presents, and Overtures of Peace, which indeed were onely Spies, to take notice where they might best break in upon them; which <HI>Cor∣tez</HI> mistrusting, and soon being inform'd of the whole Design, he cut off the Spies Hands, so sending them back to <HI>Quesitangal</HI> with Defiance: Hereupon the <HI>Indians</HI> immediately setting forward, took advantage of the ensuing Night, and with great fury fell upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who preacquainted with the De∣sign, were in so good a posture to receive them, that not able to endure such hot Service, they quickly retreated, and utterly gave over the Enterprize: But <HI>Cortez</HI> as much encourag'd by these Victories, pursu'd them, and the same Night Storm'd <HI>Tlaxcalla,</HI> a City containing above twenty thousand Houses, which in few Hours he carried. This City was curiously built, of bak'd Stones, and a place of great Trade; insomuch that the Market-places swarm'd with Buyers and Sellers, bartering one with another all manner of Provisi∣ons, as Fish, Flesh, and Bread, also Plumes of Feathers, Pearls, imbroyder'd Tapestry, Chalk, Stones, Timber, and Herbs.</P>
<P>Twenty days <HI>Cortez</HI> staid here to refresh his Army, and then march'd to the neighboring City <HI>Chiurutical,</HI> with the Auxiliary Forces of the <HI>Tlaxcallans,</HI> to the number of above a hundred thousand; they told him, That the People of <HI>Chiurutical</HI> had barricado'd up their Streets, laid upon the tops of their Houses great heaps of Stones, that their upper Rooms were cramm'd with Archers, and all things made ready both for Offence and Defence; which Advertisement he not much hearkned to, because he was conducted into the City with all their State-Formalities of Singing and Tabering upon their <HI>Tamboes,</HI> and every where courteously entertain'd.</P>

<P>This News of his discover'd Intention, so startled <HI>Montezuma,</HI> that he sup∣pos'd it better to desist, and procure the Favor of <HI>Cortez</HI> by Presents; where∣fore he sent him 15000 Cotton Habits, trim'd up very richly, ten great Char∣gers of Gold, and some Vessels of Wine, desiring him for a while to forbear his Intentions of marching to <HI>Tenustitan</HI> his Chief City,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Now Menico.</HI></NOTE> and that he would in the mean while treat with him for an Accommodation.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they make Salt.</NOTE><HI>Colvacana</HI> is supplied by the Salt Lake, to its no small benefit and inriching; for the Water being by Pipes convey'd into the City, in all the Places and Ci∣sterns for its reception makes a Scum, which being coagulated by the Sun, and after boyl'd, becomes Salt, with which they drive a great Trade; for no Salt being to be had in any place but here, all Foreign Merchants come thither for Supply.</P>
<P><HI>Cortez,</HI> being in his March within a League and a half of <HI>Tenustitan, Montezu∣ma,</HI> preceded with a thousand of his Nobless, came to meet and salute him, all of them rather like Pilgrims, bare-footed, and congying, kissing their right Hands, with which they first kiss'd the Ground: After them appear'd <HI>Monte∣zuma</HI> himself, who put a Chain of Gold, imboss'd with Pearls, about <HI>Cortez</HI> his Neck, and immediately conducted him to the City, where having entred, and being come into the Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable Passage of King <HI>Montezuma.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Montezuma</HI> plac'd <HI>Cortez</HI> on a Golden Throne, and surrendred up his Right to his Catholick Majesty of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the presence of all his Peers, to their no small amazement.</P>
<P>But whilst all things had a good face, and went on thus fairly beyond their expectations, <HI>Cortez</HI> was inform'd, That King <HI>Coalcopoca</HI> had a Design on the new City <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> and had treacherously murder'd two of the Garrison, and wounded two more: Whereupon <HI>Cortez</HI> having such fair beginnings, who had swallow'd already in his Hopes the whole Empire and Wealth belonging to <HI>Montezuma,</HI> laid hold of this Occasion, pretending Treason, and breach of Contract; wherefore he put <HI>Montezuma</HI> under Custody, notwithstanding he had clear'd himself of the Conspiracy, by bringing <HI>Coalcopoca,</HI> with his Sons, and fifteen of his Peers, Prisoners to <HI>Tenustitan,</HI> who by the command of <HI>Cor∣tez</HI> suffer'd a lingering death, being all burnt with Green Wood.

The Fresh Water is convey'd through the Salt in a Wall'd Channel, out of which none may take up Water, except they pay Excise to the Kings Farmers. This City boasts above sixty thousand Houses, all divided into Islands, but joyn'd with great Wooden Bridges: The Market-place surrounded with Gal∣leries, drives a quick and constant Trade, being always full of Buyers and Sel∣lers. In every Street they have a publick Inn, in each of which they keep Or∣dinaries, wherein the Tables are stor'd with well-dress'd Flesh and Fish, not wanting plenty of Wine. Their Trades are divided into several Companies, and they have their peculiar Places to dwell in.

On the Walls, being of an exceeding height, stand several Turrets, so high, that they seem to hide their Spires in the Clouds; and have Apartments, wherein the Priests Diet, Lodge, and Study, which are ascended by Marble Steps. These Religious Persons are generally of Noble Extract, which at se∣ven years old are carried thither, where leading a very strict Life, they never come forth to see the World, till they enter the State of Matrimony. The fa∣mous <HI>Colossus,</HI> that stood over the <HI>Rhodian</HI> Haven, between whose Legs all Ships did Sail, that came in or went out of the Harbor, cannot stand in competition with the stupendious Idol <HI>Vuichilabuchichi,</HI> whose Head touches the Arch'd Cei∣ling of the high Temple.

<P>Whilst <HI>Cortez</HI> and <HI>Montezuma</HI> were viewing the Temple, two <HI>Spaniards</HI> rush'd suddenly into one of the Cells, where they found abundance of Lamps and Torches burning, and the Walls bedaub'd two Inches thick with Humane Gore: Over-head hung vast numbers of their Sacrificing Knives; and the stench of the place was intollerable.</P>
<P>But <HI>Cortez</HI> going on, <HI>Montezuma</HI> and his Attendants resented it very hainous∣ly, that he pull'd down some of their Idols, and durst presume to look in the Kings Face; for those People bear so great Reverence to their Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grandeur of the Kings in <HI>Tenustitan.</HI></NOTE> that none dares so much as once look up in their presence: His Council stand bare∣footed, stooping with their Faces bow'd almost to the Ground before him: Four times a day they change their Apparel; and a Suit which they have once worn, is put to no other use, but presented to such Soldiers as have done some eminent Service.

<P>But whilst <HI>Cortez</HI> having staid waiting eight Months in <HI>Tenustitan,</HI> for the return of the Messengers sent to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Court, receiv'd Tidings, That <HI>Pam∣philo Narvaecy,</HI> by order of <HI>Velasques,</HI> was come with eighteen Sail, Mann'd with eight hundred Foot, and eighty Horse, from <HI>Cuba,</HI> and now riding before the <HI>Mexican</HI> Coast; from whence soon after he receiv'd unexpected Command, to come presently aboard unarm'd, and resign up his Authority: But he in stead of submission, compell'd <HI>Narvaecy</HI> in a short time to relinquish his Title, and own him for Superior. Mean while the <HI>Spaniards</HI> which remain'd in possessi∣on of <HI>Tenustitan,</HI> ran the hazard of a general Massacre; for the Citizens much stomacking the Oppressions of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who grew very insolent, inslaving their King, bringing their inveterate Enemies the <HI>Tlaxcallans</HI> and <HI>Guazuzingans</HI> into their City, exacting them to pay Tributes, pulling down their Gods, and demolishing their ancient Idols, they brake out from all Parts in a tumultuous manner, ran to Arms, and besieg'd them Day and Night in their Fort, al∣though <HI>Montezuma</HI> endeavor'd to perswade the contrary. <HI>Cortez</HI> hearing of it, came to their relief with the New Forces Landed from <HI>Cuba;</HI> but he fighting his way ere he could get in, was so roughly entertain'd by the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> that they kill'd him forty Men, wounding as many more; and notwithstanding fifteen Field-pieces with continual Shot made foul Breaches, lessening the number of the Assailants, yet they suddenly fill'd up their Vacancies again with fresh Men, which clamber'd over the Heaps of those that lay slain. Three Days the Battel had continu'd very fierce, when <HI>Montezuma</HI> being with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Castle, went to a low Window, to see if he could com∣mand his Subjects to retreat; but a continual Cry so deafned their Ears, and showres of Arrows and Stones so took away their sight, that he did nothing:

<P>After this mighty Conquest, <HI>Cortez</HI> resolv'd to discover those Territories that lay Southward; and whilst he was making all things ready for the Voy∣age, he sent two Ships with an invaluable Treasure to <HI>Spain,</HI> who fearing to be taken by the <HI>French</HI> Pyrats, ran in at <HI>Tercera,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sad accident occasion'd by a Tyger.</NOTE> where a miserable Accident hapned to the Seamen of the biggest Ship, wherein were carried two Tygers, which though taken young, and bred up amongst men, yet had not so quite forgotten their natural ferocity, but that one breaking loose in the Night, tore seven of them in pieces, hurting a far greater number, of which some had the Brawns of their Arms, the Calves of their Legs, and fleshy parts of their Thighs bit out.</P>
<P>Several Places in <HI>America</HI> breed Tygers, that far exceed Lyons in fierceness;
<PB N="90" REF="60"/>so that where any considerable number of them frequents, though the Soil be never so fruitful, yet it is left desolate and forsaken. But the Baboons that frequent the Woods are more pleasant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Battel with Ba∣boons.</NOTE> and less dangerous. <HI>Peter Arias</HI> relates, That his whole Army incountred with these Beasts, which climb'd from one Tree to the other, shrieking, and making very strange Gesticulations to those that were gone before, and gathering their Mouths and Hands full of Stones, which they threw as exact and strongly as a Man. When one of these Baboons, shot by a Musquet, fell to the Ground, the rest gave such a horrible shriek, that the Woods resounding with the noise, strook a terror into the <HI>Spa∣niards.</HI> Amongst several things that hapned in this Counter-scuffle, take this one: A <HI>Spaniard</HI> taking aim with his Musquet at an old Baboon, which sate pearch'd up in a Tree, and being now just ready to give Fire, the Baboon Sol∣dier, at the very instant, to break the Shot, taking a Stone out of his Mouth, threw it exactly into the Mans Mouth, with such force as beat out some of his Teeth; with which sudden blow surpris'd, he lost his Mark; and the proud Foe, shewing signs of Triumph, went his way.</P>
<P>But whilst <HI>Cortez</HI> staid in the Countrey of <HI>Tenustitan</HI> (now call'd <HI>Mexico</HI>) <HI>Franciscus Garajus</HI> sail'd out of the Haven of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> with eleven Ships, to the River <HI>Panucus,</HI> there, according to the Command of the Emperor <HI>Charles,</HI> to plant a Colony: Whereupon he went ashore, ordering his Fleet to sail along in sight of Land: So wading through the River <HI>Montaltus,</HI> which glides be∣tween high Mountains, he came to a Morassy Ground, in which he and they often sunk almost up to the Middle, and lost his way in a Thicket of young Trees; yet at last being come to the River <HI>Panucus,</HI> he found several high Walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great destruction.</NOTE> being the Ruines of Fortresses, Temples, and Towers, destroy'd by <HI>Cortez;</HI> so that the City lay quite desolate.

But <HI>Garajus,</HI> whose Son was married to <HI>Cortez</HI> his Daughter, liv'd not long after the Wedding, which occasion'd a murmur as if <HI>Cortez</HI> had poyson'd him, to rid himself of a Partner in his Government;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cortez</HI> his Ambition.</NOTE> for it had been generally observ'd, that his Ambition suf∣fer'd no Equal. The <HI>Americans</HI> fell all down before him; all were Servants alike: The Court which he kept swarm'd with Attendance, on which he spent
<PB N="91" REF="60"/>vast Sums of Money; yet his Incomes were able to bear such excessive Dis∣bursements. He kept in constant Pay five thousand Soldiers, and several Ships ready rigg'd and prepar'd on all occasions, to hold in awe the enslav'd People, or else for the Discovery of New Countreys: Yet after all these extraordina∣ry Charges defray'd, to shew his Wealth and Greatness, he caus'd a Piece of Cannon to be cast all of massie Gold: for the Kings which formerly acknow∣ledg'd <HI>Montezuma</HI> for their Sovereign, gave him a yearly Revenue, most of which were valu'd to be worth twenty three Tun of Gold; for so much the King of <HI>Tescuscus,</HI> a stately City, paid, whose Houses Plaister'd with White-Lime, seem'd afar off to be rather a Chalky Hill or Mountain, cover'd with Snow: Full as much did the King pay which reigned in <HI>Otumba,</HI> notwith∣standing he had receiv'd with his <HI>Christianity</HI> the Name of <HI>Ferdinand Cortez;</HI> yet others gave less: The King <HI>Guacinalgo,</HI> with his Mother, and some Slaves, bringing Gold, came to present it to <HI>Cortez;</HI> and entring the Palace, through a Guard of five hundred Horse and four Hundred Foot, which were always ready Arm'd for fear of Insurrections, he fell down prostrate on the Ground. Thus all things even out-went whatever he could desire, hope for, or imagine: And <HI>Alvaredo,</HI> one of his Commanders, being sent Eastwardly, brought great Treasures back with him, which the conquer'd Kings were forc'd to raise.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Misfortunes.</NOTE>But Fortune, who seldom continues her Favors long, at last began to frown; for <HI>Cortez</HI> having sent an unvaluable Treasure of Gold and Pearls to the Em∣peror <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, <HI>Floryn</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Pyrate met with and took it, which went so much to his Heart, that for a considerable time he sent no Advice to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Court, which made them grow jealous of him, doubting that he intended to make himself King over <HI>New-Spain;</HI> and this Suspicion was not a little augmented by his Enemies.</P>
<P>In the Neck of these, follow'd another Misfortune; for <HI>Christopher Olitus,</HI> sent out by <HI>Cortez</HI> to discover new Countreys, rebelling, took up Arms against him, being then in the Haven <HI>Figueras,</HI> five hundred Leagues beyond. Not∣withstanding the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> although amongst a new-conquer'd People, which without doubt long'd for Revenge, were not to take notice of their danger, but to go on with undaunted Resolution; whereupon <HI>Cortez</HI> drawing out a strong Party, march'd a long and troublesom way to meet <HI>Olitus,</HI> making great Slaughters where-ever he came. <HI>Francisco de las Casas</HI> was commanded to go upon the same Account by Sea, and arriving first, found him setling his new Colony, which he nam'd <HI>Triumph de Sancta Crux;</HI> and notwithstanding the Water with a Northerly Wind was very rough and boysterous in the Haven <HI>Figueras</HI> (which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call'd so, because they found Trees there, which growing at the Foot of the Mountains, bore a Fruit not unlike a Fig) yet they came to a present Engagement, wherein <HI>Casas</HI> worsting <HI>Olitus,</HI> having sunk one of his Ships, stood out again to Sea; but surpriz'd by a violent Storm, and driven on the Shore, fell into <HI>Olitus</HI>'s Hands, who had a little before also taken <HI>Egidius</HI> or <HI>Giles Gonsales.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Plot of two <HI>Spanish</HI> Officers.</NOTE> These two Prisoners consulted together how they might poyson or murder <HI>Olitus,</HI> which fell out according to their desires, be∣cause the Servants of the House where they lodg'd sided with them; so taking hold of the first opportunity, as they were at Supper together, they stabb'd him with their Knives in several places; yet the Wounds were not so great or mortal, but that he retain'd strength to escape in the dark to a neighboring Hut; but the Assassinates immediately sent out Messengers, publishing, That he who did not, knowing where <HI>Olitus</HI> was, immediately bring him to them, should

<P>During the time that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Officers had these Civil Broyls one against another, <HI>Lodowick Pontaeus,</HI> a Man well experienc'd in the Law, came from <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> there in the Emperors Name to settle all things in good order; ha∣ving also particular Instructions, to shew great kindness to <HI>Cortez,</HI> and to make him a Knight of the Order of <HI>St. James,</HI> that by that means the Emperor might be the more esteem'd for his Noble Subjects and Servants, amongst the <HI>Mexi∣cans,</HI> who are themselves of a proud and ambitious spirit, and chiefly the No∣bility, which doth manifestly appear by their Apparel, more gorgeous than the meaner sort of <HI>Americans;</HI> and though the Slaves go stark naked (having onely a Cloth tied about their Privities) and with a Bowe and Arrows walk before their Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mexicans</HI> Apparel.</NOTE> yet the Better Sort go very costly Habited; for about their Necks they wear Strings of Pearl; on their Heads, a Cap, from whence hang down two Scarfs, one longer than the other; then a party-colour'd Cotton Coat covers their whole Bodies to their Knees, under which they wear a Vest girt about their Middle.</P>

<PB N="93" REF="61"/>too much upon his Authority; for the Countrey being full of Woods and Mountains, might hide many of his Enemies: But he not regarding the Advice, went a Journey from <HI>New Granada,</HI> and having march'd fifty Leagues Easterly, he cross'd into the River <HI>Suere,</HI> with sixty <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and was present∣ed by the Princes of the Countrey with as much Gold as amounted to seven thousand Duckets. Here he spent some Weeks, effecting little; but now all things growing scarce, though he was very earnest with the Natives for Provi∣sions, yet he could get little; which kind of Life the Soldiers disliking, and growing weary of, went away in the Night to <HI>Nicaragua.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is forsaken of all.</NOTE> <HI>Gottierez</HI> thus left alone, got into a Boat, with intent to follow them; and being just put off from the Shore, was met by Captain <HI>Barjanto,</HI> who brought new Forces and fresh Provisions with him: This wrought upon him to stay there. Not long after <HI>Alphonso de Pisa</HI> went with twenty seven Men from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to the same River <HI>Suere;</HI> but it being then very rough at the Entrance, he was neces∣sitated to pass on to a small uninhabited Isle, where whilst he lay at an Anchor, the Weather began to grow worse and worse; the Gusts of Wind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Tempest.</NOTE> mix'd with Showres of Rain, Thunder, and Lightning, seem'd to threaten a general De∣struction; for in the Ship two <HI>Spaniards</HI> and one <HI>Moor</HI> were kill'd by the Lightning: In seventy two Days, the Sun did not shine four Hours: At last weighing Anchor, he sail'd over to the Main Land, where he saw nothing but vast Mountains and Wildernesses. Here for a time they liv'd upon Cockles found on the Shore, and wild Fruits in the Woods: At length coming to <HI>Got∣tierez,</HI> he sent him with his People in five Boats to fetch new Forces from <HI>Nom∣bre de Dios.</HI> In his way thither he saw a House built of Canes, cover'd with Palm-leaves, forty five Paces long, and built after an Oval fashion: Round about it stood several lesser Hovels, all which making up a Village, the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> nam'd <HI>Francisco,</HI> because they came thither on <HI>St. Francis</HI> Day.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Village <HI>Francisco</HI></NOTE> About half way they met with the Lords of <HI>Suere</HI> and <HI>Chiuppa,</HI> going to attend <HI>Gottierez,</HI> to whom being admitted, and sitting with him at Table, he gave them, as a Dainty, rosted Chickens and fresh Pork; but they gave it to their Servants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange manner of eating.</NOTE> not delighting in the taste of such Victuals. <HI>Gottierez,</HI> by means of an Interpre∣ter, told them concerning the <HI>Christian-Religion,</HI> at which they bow'd their Heads, without making any Answer: But how little mind they had to em∣brace it, quickly appear'd; for not long after, they set their Villages on fire, and all the Provisions which they could not carry with them, they spoil'd, and so retiring, hid themselves upon inaccessible Mountains. Another Incentive leading them to this Fight, was, because the Governor <HI>Camachiren,</HI> and his De∣puty (notwithstanding he had given <HI>Gottierez</HI> as much Gold, when he came first into the Countrey, as amounted to seven thousand Duckets, as we menti∣on'd before) yet was put in Prison by his Order, contrary to all Promises: Nay, <HI>Gottierez</HI> threatned to burn him (not regarding, that he had besides re∣ceiv'd of him several Pieces of Gold, resembling all manner of Beasts, as Ty∣gers, and others; and also Fishes and Fowls curiously wrought, which were valu'd at two Tun of Gold; yet this Present seemed too little for him, whereupon bringing the Prisoner to a Chest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unsatisfied Covetousness of <HI>Gottierez.</HI></NOTE> he swore that he would rost him by degrees, if in four days time he did not furnish him with four times as much more Gold as that Chest would hold: Whereupon <HI>Chamachiren</HI>'s Servants went away to get the requir'd Gold; but he, through carelesness of the Watch, made his escape in the Night, so that <HI>Gottierez</HI> lost his Booty. But the other Prisoners, though threatned to be torn asunder with Dogs, remain'd firm,
<PB N="94" REF="62"/>disowning that they had any Gold; and among the rest, one speaking boldly to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Officer said, <HI>That he stood amaz'd at his treacherous dealings, why did he keep him Chain'd against Law and Promse, and often threaten'd him with death, but yet would not kill him, for he, said he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, had rather choose to die, than live so miserable a life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gottierez</HI>'s Conscience troubling him, he would willingly have releas'd the <HI>Indian,</HI> and the rather, because he promis'd to procure a great ransome of Gold; but the inferior Commanders would not consent to it. After this they march'd six days through great Wildernesses, and over high Mountains, find∣ing no Footsteps of any People. Lastly, They came down a very dangerous and steep Mountain, where had not the Shrubs and jutting Stones serv'd them to hold by, they had all broken their Necks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dangerous Mountains,</NOTE>Fifteen Leagues, the hanging of this Mountain spread it self along a sweet River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Huts.</NOTE> on whose opposite Shore stood strange Huts full of dead Tygers, Deers Heads, and Legs; here they staid two days to rest themselves, where the Trees <HI>Mamei</HI> and the <HI>Cazabi</HI> Plants yielded them good Food.</P>
<P>Travelling forward, <HI>Gottierez</HI> ask'd an <HI>Indian</HI> which was the nearest way to a Village, but he pretending not to know any near hand, had his Head imme∣diately cut off. In like manner, and for the same reason the <HI>Indian</HI> Prince should also have been Executed, had not <HI>Gottierez</HI> given order to the contrary; seeing his resolution, that with no less Patience than undaunted Courage, stretch'd forth his Neck to the Executioners. Mean while, their Provisions de∣creasing, they suffer'd extreme hunger; insomuch, that some fainted quite away. The Souldiers also rebelling against <HI>Gottierez</HI> for Food, he commanded them to kill their Dogs, and stamp the Barks of Trees; two days they tra∣velled much discontented in this manner, and at last came to the entrance of a Wood, where they espy'd an <HI>Indian</HI> standing behind a Tree, which on a sud∣den ran away with incredible swiftness: early the next morning, above four thousand <HI>Indians</HI> came Marching against the faint <HI>Spaniards,</HI> making a terrible noise with Horns and Drums; they were all except their Princes Painted black and red; some wore Plumes of Feathers on their Heads, and Collars of the same about their Necks; the fight began very fiercely, by casting abundance of Stones, and shooting of Arrows, wherein, though <HI>Gottierez</HI> was at first Wounded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Valiant fight.</NOTE> yet after half an hour the Assailants fled, but recruited with fresh Forces renew'd the fight, breaking into their Ranks, and making so great slaughter amongst them with Woodden Swords, and Palm-Tree Clubs, knocking down, and dealing such deadly Wounds, that of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> three onely escap'd, saving themselves by flight, who two hours after, much amaz'd and terrify'd, came to their reserve, consisting onely of twenty four Men, which <HI>Alphonso de Risa</HI> Commanded; the insulting Enemy at their Heels, waving over their Heads the Swords, Shields, and Cross-Bows which they had gotten from the slain <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and some withal crying in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue, <HI>Come Christians, come, and take Gold.</HI> But <HI>de Risa,</HI> for all their pride, set them going with some Volleys of Shot; after this, escaping innumerable other dangers, he came to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> without having effected any thing of Note.</P>

<P>The former difficulties with this Edict easily wrought upon <HI>Pizarro</HI>'s men, all but twelve, to leave him, for the rest went over with the Ship fitted out by <HI>Rios</HI> with succors to the Island <HI>Gallo,</HI> where <HI>Pizarro</HI> resided, having also fail'd in his second Expedition. But although he had made two bad Voyages, yet having an inclination to a third attempt, he went to <HI>Spain,</HI> desiring of the Em∣peror to be Governor of <HI>Peru,</HI> which he had discover'd; for besides his Plea of Merits he had taken possession of the Country twice by Landing there, in∣tended for the use of his Imperial Majesty; one of his Sea-men to that purpose flourishing his two-handed Sword over his Head, the glistering of which Sword so frighted the Natives, that none of them durst come near him.</P>
<P>His request being consulted upon, was at last granted, the Government of <HI>Peru</HI> being conferred upon him; but <HI>Almagro</HI> took it very ill, that <HI>Pizarro</HI> went to the Emperor on such a design for himself; yet by the mediation of his Friends the difference was reconciled, then <HI>Pizarro</HI> setting Sail with one hun∣dred and fifty Foot besides Horse, and Landing at the Island <HI>Puna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pizarro</HI>'s fight on <HI>Puna.</HI></NOTE> at first was courteously entertain'd, but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by extravagant hunting and search∣ing every where their Houses for Gold, and committing several other outrages, incensing, chang'd the humor of the Inhabitants so much, that they fell upon them.

<P>From this Isle, lying three degrees Southward of the <HI>Equinoctial, Pizarro</HI> pas∣sed over to the <HI>Main Continent,</HI> where they were all in a great confusion, upon the report of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> cruelties committed in <HI>Puna;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Comes to <HI>Peru.</HI></NOTE> yet all the prepara∣tions of the <HI>Indians</HI> to withstand, stop'd not <HI>Pizarro</HI> from his intended course; for first, having the success to master <HI>Tampez,</HI> thence he made nothing to march his Forces over the River <HI>Ambato,</HI> there burning a Temple Dedicated to the Sun.

<P><HI>Attabaliba</HI> hearing that <HI>Pizarro</HI> resolv'd to come forward, sent him a pair of Painted Shooes and Armlets, that he might put them on when he appear'd be∣fore his Throne: Captain <HI>Ferdinand Sotto</HI> march'd before with twenty Horse, pas∣sing close on the Flank of <HI>Attabaliba</HI>'s Army: The <HI>Indians</HI> amaz'd at the praun∣cing of their Horses, retreated into their Fortifications, but were for their cowardize immediately slain by the King's Order.</P>

The before-mention'd Bishop carry'd in one Hand a Cross, in the other a Book, discoursing with the King to this effect; <HI>That God is the Trinity,</HI> Adam <HI>the first Man; Christ Born of a Virgin, dy'd on the Cross; the</HI> Pope <HI>God's Vice-Gerent, who according to the Power he had from Heaven, had given</HI> Peru <HI>to the Em∣peror</HI> Charles, <HI>as also all other Countreys in</HI> America; <HI>and if he should prove obstinate, and resist, he must expect nothing less than utter ruine.

Moreover, he would not desert that Religion which he and his Ancestors had maintain'd so many Ages, and the rather, because there are no apparent or sufficient Testi∣mony of the truth of Christianity.</HI> The latter clause was thus answer'd, saying, <HI>This Book, O King, which I hold in my hand, proves and declares all that you question.

<P>But <HI>Pizarro</HI> gaining time while the King and Bishop thus discours'd, had drawn his Men in Battel-Array, his sixty Horse he divided into three Wings, Commanded by his three Brothers, <HI>Ferdinand, John,</HI> and <HI>Gonzalvo Pizarro,</HI> left the Captains <HI>Sotto</HI> and <HI>Bavalcazar</HI> in an Ambuscade; <HI>Peter de Canada</HI> march'd in the Van, and he himself in the main Body, leaving <HI>Sotto</HI> in the Rear.</P>

Whilst they stay'd here, a Fiery Meteor appear'd in the Sky, with such fervor, that some Rivers boyl'd with the heat of it, and the Fish parboyl'd, died; nay more, it scorch'd all the Plants far and near: The Natives ascrib'd this Plague to the <HI>French</HI> Cannons, by which means they stood in great fear of the <HI>French,</HI> who might have done great things had not they differ'd amongst themselves;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable difference in the <HI>French</HI> Fleet.</NOTE> For a Sea-man nam'd <HI>Rubel Patracon,</HI> pretending to have skill in <HI>Necromancy,</HI> would undertake to shew the Places where the Gold and Silver Mines were, which the rest of the Sea-men believing, rebell'd against <HI>Laudonier,</HI> and though sick, imprison'd him, forcing him to sign a Wri∣ting to this effect, That the two Ships, of which the Rebels made <HI>Vassar</HI> and <HI>Trincant</HI> Commanders, should with his leave and permittance sail to <HI>New Spain</HI> for Provisions.

<P>In this interim <HI>Laudonier</HI> receiving no Supply from <HI>France,</HI> was brought to great extremity; for the Rebels had carried great part of his Store with them.

In this desperate conditi∣on, <HI>John Haukins,</HI> a great Sea-Captain, came thither with four <HI>English</HI> Ships, who pitying their misery, furnish'd them with Necessaries, and having onely four Vessels, lent them one, because <HI>Laudonier</HI> was at that time too weak to endure the Sea; but not long after recovering strength, and all things ready to set Sail, <HI>Ribald</HI> came to an Anchor before <HI>Charles-Fort,</HI> with seven Ships from <HI>Diep:</HI> Within few days after, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admiral <HI>Peter Melandez</HI> arriv'd with eight Frigats, whereof the <HI>French</HI> having Intelligence, cut their Cables, and stood out to Sea, whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> chac'd, but could not reach; whereupon lea∣ving them, they landed in the Mouth of the River <HI>Dolphin,</HI> where by help of the <HI>Moorish</HI> Slaves they began to intrench themselves; of which <HI>Ribald</HI> having notice, immediately sail'd thither, at least to disturb, if not absolutely drive them from their Work; but surpriz'd in the way by a great Storm, lost most of his Fleet, ingag'd among the Rocks; yet the Men were most of
<PB N="107" REF="69"/>them sav'd. In this Storm the <HI>Spaniards</HI> also suffer'd great damage, yet made an Advantage of the <HI>Frenchmens</HI> Misfortune, marching with all speed to <HI>Charles-Fort,</HI> in which were onely two hundred weak Men, <HI>Ribald</HI> having taken the primest Soldiers along with him. In the Morning before Sun-rise the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made a fierce Assault, and in a short time became Masters of the Place, which <HI>Laudonier</HI> seeing, fled in a Boat; others leaping from the Walls into the Moat, sav'd themselves by swimming: Whoever fell into the Victors Hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great cruelty of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> against the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> was without mercy slain; nay, such was the <HI>Spaniards</HI> inveterate malice to the <HI>French,</HI> that wanting living Bodies, they exercis'd their Cruelty upon the dead, pulling out their Eyes, and cutting off their Members, carrying them in Tri∣umph on the Points of their Swords.

<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> by this time had not onely strengthned <HI>Charles-Fort,</HI> but also rais'd two others on each side of the River <HI>Mayo,</HI> in which three Holds lay Garrison'd above four hundred choice Soldiers. Those in the new Forts made little resistance; but quitting the same, and flying into a neighboring Wood, fell into an Ambuscade of <HI>Indians,</HI> who slew thirty of them, and preserv'd ninety for a Publick Execution. Thus they march'd on victoriously to <HI>Charles-Fort,</HI> where by the way sixty <HI>Spaniards</HI> sallying out, were every one cut off, which much facilitated the <HI>Frenchmens</HI> Work. The Governor <HI>Melandez,</HI> seeing a certain mine attend him, fled into the Woods; but met there by the <HI>Flori∣dans,</HI> return'd to the <HI>French,</HI> of whom he begg'd Life for himself, and some of his People: Yet <HI>Gurgie</HI> deaf to all intreacies, would hear nothing, but pres∣sing on, took them all Prisoners, and as a just Reward of their Cruelty to his Countrey-men; hang'd them on the next Trees: After which Execution, it can scarce be express'd how kindly the Natives entertain'd the <HI>French,</HI> because they had freed the Countrey from the <HI>Spanish</HI> Oppressions.

The fourth of <HI>July</HI> he made <HI>Friezland,</HI> where he met with a great Storm of Hail, mix'd with Snow: Before the Shore lay a great Ridge of Ice, which hindred for a while their Landing: Here he saw several Wild People, but could not come to speak with them; for upon the least approach they fled; yet when they saw any advantage, made resistance: At last, three of them came unarm'd to the Shore, beckoning <HI>Forbisher</HI> to come to them; which he had done, had not great numbers of the Natives appear'd too soon from an Ambuscade in a Wood, and behind a Hill, who seeing them∣selves discover'd, march'd up into the Countrey, three onely staying on the Shore, of whom the middlemost feigning to be lame, at last fell down, whom his Companions took up, and carried a little way, but then forsook, by which the <HI>English</HI> observing their Design, shot that the Sand flew all about him; whereupon forgetting his Lameness, he ran as swift as a Deer up a Hill.</P>
<P><HI>Forbisher</HI>'s Men had by this time fill'd two Barrels with a Mineral not unlike Gold, but was afterwards found to be of little value. Nothing else of Re∣mark did he find here, except great long-hair'd Men, who being exceeding salvage, subtilly plot nothing else but to murder, lurking for Men, like Wild Beasts for their Prey, whom, when caught, they tear in pieces. Close fitted to their Bodies, they wore the Skins of several Wild Beasts, priding in the Tails which hung down betwixt their Legs. Their Tents are of conjoyn'd Whalebones, cover'd over with the like Skins, the Entrance always facing the South. They use Bowes, Arrows, Slings, and two sorts of Boats: In the big∣gest they can carry seventeen Men, which are made of several Wooden Planks clinch'd together, and cased on both sides with Leather: The smallest ones are cover'd just in the same manner, much resembling a Weavers Shuttle, ha∣ving in the middle a Hole, wherein a Man sits, who drawing the Cover of the Boat about his Waste by Strings, with one Oar makes swift Passage.</P>
<P>The Countrey it self is barren, yet feeds abundance of Deer, Hares, Wolves, Bears, and Dogs like Wolves, whose Flesh serves the Inhabitants for Food.</P>
<P>This Countrey seems to be exceedingly troubled with great Earthquakes, because several pieces of Rocks, and whole Mountains rent asunder, may be seen in divers places.</P>
<P>The fourth of <HI>August, Forbisher</HI> having elevated the Pole to sixty eight De∣grees, beyond what <HI>Sebastian Gabot,</HI> the first Discoverer of those Parts, and set out by <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, had done (for <HI>America</HI> Northward never before had

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir. <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s Ex∣pedition.</NOTE>At the same time when <HI>Forbisher</HI> sail'd Northerly, Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> also, fitted out by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> steer'd another Course, sailing by <HI>Cape Blanko</HI> and <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> along the <HI>African</HI> Coast, to <HI>Brasile,</HI> where he caught several Sea-Wolves, and Anchoring in the River <HI>La Plata,</HI> furnish'd himself with Fresh Water: Then proceeding on his Voyage through the crooked <HI>Straights of Magellan,</HI> he came to an Anchor before <HI>Moucha,</HI> wash'd by the <HI>South Sea.</HI> The Islanders receiv'd him very courteously, because they were inform'd that the <HI>English</HI> were at great Wars with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to avoid whose Cruelties, they had deserted the main Continent, and setled on <HI>Moucha.</HI> One of these <HI>Mouchaners</HI> going aboard, serv'd them for a Pilot to the Haven <HI>Valparizo,</HI> where <HI>Drake</HI> burnt the St. <HI>Jago,</HI> a small Village, and plundring all the Countrey about it, got together a great Trea∣sure of Gold and Silver. Before <HI>Arica</HI> he took three <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships, richly la∣den; and before <HI>Lima,</HI> four more, having an unvaluable Treasure of Pearls and Gold aboard them. Thus inrich'd, he steer'd his Course Northerly to forty two Degrees; but the Cold forcing him to fall four Degrees to the South∣ward, he discover'd a very pleasant and inhabited Coast, the People whereof shew'd him great kindness: The King himself coming aboard with a great Train, set a Crown of Gold upon <HI>Drakes</HI> Head, and gave him a Golden Scep∣ter, and an Ivory Chain. After this he inspected the Islands <HI>Tidor, Ternata, Java, Zeilon,</HI> and <HI>Cape de Bona Esperanza,</HI> from whence, after a three Years Voy∣age, having encompass'd the World, he came safe to <HI>London,</HI> where he rested not long; for sailing <HI>Anno</HI> 1585. to <HI>America,</HI> he took great Prizes from the Ci∣ties <HI>St. Jago, St. Domingo, St. Augustin,</HI> and <HI>Carthagena,</HI> setting them all on Fire. Thus again returning home victoriously, and after the famous defeat of the

<P>But much worse success had Captain <HI>John Smith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smith</HI>'s Voyage.</NOTE> who weigh'd Anchor <HI>Anno</HI> 1614. with two Ships, fitted out by several Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> for <HI>New Eng∣land,</HI> and on the Island <HI>Monachigga</HI> to load Copper, Gold, and other Minerals that were to be had there, and also to fish for Whales: But there were no such Minerals to be found there, nor any Whales to be taken on the Coast, because the time of the Year was past; so that he return'd home without Success. However, not long after, they undertook the same Expedition a second time, but with worse Fortune; for being gotten in sight of <HI>Virginia,</HI> he was treache∣rously set upon, and taken by the <HI>French,</HI> who accus'd him, that he had de∣stroy'd the Plantations in <HI>Nova Francia,</HI> and unless he would make satisfaction for the Damage, they threatned him with death.

<P>From hence fleering to the Desolate Island <HI>Brava,</HI> they saw nothing but five ruin'd Houses, the Door of one stopp'd up with great Stones, which being taken away, was found full of <HI>Turkish</HI> Wheat, which prov'd a great kindness to the Sea-men.</P>
<P>Mean while the Admiral <HI>Mahu</HI> died,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahu</HI> dies.</NOTE> and his Body put into a Chest fill'd up with Stones, was thrown over-board;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cordes</HI> his Voyage.</NOTE> so that <HI>Simon des Cordes</HI> carrying the Flag, steer'd his Course to <HI>Guinee,</HI> there to refresh himself; for most of his Men were so weakned by the Scurvey, that they were scarce able to hand the Sails.</P>
<P>Arriving at their intended Port, the Sick were carried ashore; and the Vice-Admiral <HI>Beuningen,</HI> being conducted by a <HI>French</HI> Guide, went to the Vice-Roy of that Countrey, who sat on a low Bench,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange King in <HI>Guinee.</HI></NOTE> with a Sheeps-skin under his Feet, in a Violet-colour'd Cloth Suit, without any Linnen, Shirt, Shoes, or Stockins; on his Head a Cap made of yellow, red, and blue Eastern Cloth; his Face whitened with Ashes, shew'd in several places its natural blackness, ap∣pearing through the Colours; about his Neck a Collar or Chain of Glass Beads: Behind him sat his Nobles, with Cocks Feathers on their Heads, and their Skins painted Red.</P>
<P><HI>Beuningen</HI> plac'd by the King on a Mat, complain'd to him, That the <HI>Guine∣ans</HI> fled from him where-ever he came, though in Friendship, to barter <HI>Europe∣an</HI> Commodities with them, against Fruits, Poultrey, Sheep, and other Provi∣sions: Whereupon the King promis'd to furnish him therewith, and invited <HI>Beuningen</HI> to Dinner. After some stay, the Kings Wives entred the Palace, a very mean and ill-favour'd Building, more like a great Barn than a Kings House, and plac'd a kind of nasty Trough on the Ground, in which lay no∣thing but some wild Herbs, and a piece of a smoak'd Sea-Calf; and though he was a Person of the largest size, and corpulent, yet he eat sparingly. <HI>Beu∣ningen,</HI> though exceeding hungry, found little rellish in such kind of Meats; wherefore spreading a Napkin, his Attendants brought him some Bisket and
<PB N="112" REF="72"/><HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, whereof after the King had tasted, he lik'd so well the rellish, that it rock'd him asleep, whilst <HI>Beuningen</HI> walk'd to the Sea-side to refresh him∣self; but the <HI>Guineans</HI> coming about him, he was forc'd to return to the King, who waking at the noise, appear'd highly incens'd at his People, and took <HI>Beuningen</HI> into his House: However the Subjects, notwithstanding the Kings Commands, when <HI>Beuningen</HI> was sent into a neighboring Hut, kept Watch about it all Night: The next Morning early an old Woman entred, muttering to her self, and went out and in to <HI>Beuningen</HI> three times one after another, knocking on a Box not unlike a Pair of Bellows, out of which flew abundance of Dust about <HI>Beuningen,</HI> which caus'd a great Laughter amongst the <HI>Guineans.</HI> The King also coming to him, presented him with two Goats, and four Hens, and so conducted him back to the Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Beuningen</HI> seeing that there was no good to be done, set sail from thence, and coming before the River <HI>La Plata</HI> in <HI>America,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bloody Sea, very strange</NOTE> it appear'd Blood-red. Out of the Water which was taken up in Buckets, started a sort of Insects like Fleas, which caus'd a strange and sad Distemper amongst the Sea-men, that when any Meat was offer'd to them, so soon as ever they put it to their Mouths, they would fall down backwards in a swoon, foaming and frothing at the Mouth, and turning up the White of their Eyes, die distracted. Suffering under this Disaster, they hasted from thence with all speed, and sailing into the <HI>Straights of Magellan</HI> they kill'd above fourteen hundred <HI>Penguyins,</HI> which is a Bird that preys on Fish, and lives in Holes under Ground; they somewhat re∣semble a Goose, onely they stand more upright, and are double-crested, with two plumy Combs. Coming to an Anchor in the <HI>Green-Bay,</HI> there arose a great Storm, which continued several days, so that they were forc'd to moor their Vessels with four Anchors, extremely afflicted both with Hunger and Cold, preserving themselves alive by eating young Grout, at that time not above a span high from the Ground; but this course Food bred an incurable Dropsie, that posted them on to a sudden death. Afterwards, when the Weather grew more pleasant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salvages in the <HI>Straights of Magellan.</HI></NOTE> the Inhabitants being Gyants, most of them eleven Foot high, grew more troublesom, oftentimes assailing them, and throwing Darts point∣ed like Harping-Irons, at which they were very expert. Their Salvage Natures may appear by their Dealings with the dead <HI>Hollanders,</HI> cutting off their Heads, and bruising them to pieces, sticking Darts through their Hearts, and cutting off their Privities.</P>
<P>At last the Fleet getting into the <HI>South Sea,</HI> were by stress of Weather sepa∣rated one from another: Two Ships, being the <HI>Faith,</HI> and the <HI>Good Tydings,</HI> were driven back into the <HI>Straights of Magellan,</HI> where they suffer'd the utter∣most extremity of Hunger:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A wild Woman.</NOTE> Here they took a wild Woman, and two Chil∣dren, who being of a sallow Complexion, had a great hanging Belly, a wide Mouth, crooked Legs, long Heels, and Breasts like Cows Udders; about her Neck a String of Snail-shells, and upon her Back a Beasts Skin, fastned about her Neck with the Sinews of it; her Food nought else but live Fowls: The same Diet the Children fed upon: The youngest being but six Months old, had his Mouth full of Teeth, and ran without any help: The eldest they car∣ried to <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> but having kept the Woman aboard two Nights, they gave her several Trifles, and set her ashore. Here they found old Ice in the middle of Summer, four Foot thick.</P>
<P><HI>Beuningen</HI> lingred in the <HI>Straights of Magellan,</HI> and being tired out with Hunger, Cold, and Storms, return'd home; and had they not by accident

<P>TWo Months after <HI>Mahu, Oliver van Noord</HI> set sail with four Ships, and two hundred forty eight Men, from the <HI>Maes.</HI> Having reach'd the <HI>Princes Island,</HI> he lost seven of his Men by the Treachery of the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> and An∣choring before the City <HI>Javeiro,</HI> he was no better entertain'd by the same Nati∣on: Here having a Rencounter, and both Sides receiving considerable Loss, he steer'd for St. <HI>Sebastian,</HI> a fruitful Island, producing an Herb very wholesom against the <HI>Scurvey:</HI> Here the Sea-men found great store of Sea-Mews, and Parrots, besides several sorts of delicious Fish. The approaching Winter advis'd them from entring the <HI>Straights of Magellan</HI> so late; wherefore they judg'd it best to seek a convenient Harbor, to put their Sick ashore to re∣fresh themselves. The Island <HI>St. Hellen,</HI> for its fruitfulness, seem'd to be the most convenient for this purpose; but a great Storm preventing them, they came to <HI>St. Clara,</HI> where taking in Fresh Water, they cast Anchor in <HI>Porto De∣sire.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Porto Desire.</NOTE> In this Haven they saw a kind of Sea-Dogs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea-Dogs.</NOTE> whose fore-parts being over∣grown with long Hair, seem'd like a Lyon, and the Feet like Mens Hands; over their Eyes and Upper-lips grew black and white Hair, which in Stormy Weather stands staring upright, but in Calm, lies flat and smooth; they Urine backwards, sleep very soundly, and cast their Young every Month: Their Flesh well-boyl'd prov'd a savory Dish.</P>
<P><HI>Van Noord</HI> going ashore here, saw not a Man;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Tombs.</NOTE> but only Burying-places on high Rocks, built of red Stones, and adorn'd both within and without with Bowes, Arrows, and other strange things: Under the Heads of the Dead lay four-square Shells, and other things artificially carv'd. Curiosity made them desirous to make a further search into the Countrey; wherefore he rowed du∣ring a whole Tide up a River; and when their Boat ran aground at the time of Ebb, he walk'd several Leagues up into the Countrey, where he saw nothing but Deer, Buffles, and Ostriches: and because he saw no People, he judg'd the Coast to be uninhabited; but returning again, he found it other∣wise; for the Sea-men, though commanded to stay in the Boat, which lay in the middle of the River, went ashore, where they were so fiercely set upon by thirty of the Natives, that three of them were kill'd, and another wounded in the Leg. These People are very strong and Salvage, with painted Faces, and long Hair; but after this Encounter, they saw no more of them.</P>
<P>But <HI>van Noord</HI> having spent fourteen Months in search, and lost a hundred Men, set sail again with three Ships; for one of them, being the <HI>Unity,</HI> he burnt at the Island <HI>Clara,</HI> where he Winter'd, because of a great Leak which could not be stopp'd. Here they brought five thousand Fowls aboard, which much increased their Stock of Provisions.</P>
<P>From hence passing the Wide Ocean, into the <HI>Straights of Magellan,</HI> four times the Fleet attempted to go into the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and was as often driven back by cross Weather into the <HI>Straights;</HI> but the fifth time prov'd more successful; for having got through, and left the <HI>Straights</HI> a handsom way astern, they

<P>Against the City <HI>Peyta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Peyta</HI> burnt.</NOTE> he play'd his Cannon with such fury, that the Towns∣men deserted the place, which he observing, set it on fire, and Sail'd to <HI>Aquapul∣que,</HI> where from the Fort at first the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fired some Guns at them; but soon after changing humor, they came to an Accommodation, furnishing the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with convenient Provisions.

<P>SOme Merchants that were call'd the <HI>Austrian</HI> Company, fitted out one Ship with sixty five, and a Ketch with two and twenty Sea-men, giving the Command thereof to the Captains <HI>Schouten</HI> and <HI>Le Maire: Anno</HI> 1615 they Weigh'd Anchor from the <HI>Texel;</HI> the first took a view of one of the three Islands, call'd <HI>Mabrabomma,</HI> lying before <HI>Cape Sierra Leona.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mabrabomma,</HI> what man∣ner of Isle.</NOTE> This Island appear∣ing a great height out of the Sea, was not inhabited, they seeing onely three Wild Buffles, many Wild Cats, Birds which bark'd like Dogs, Wild Palm-Trees, Lemon-Trees, Turtles, Crocodiles, Partridges, and Storks: From hence, passing by the dangerous Shelf <HI>Abrolbos,</HI> they ran into <HI>Porto Desire,</HI> where on the Rocks they found abundance of Eggs, and Spierings, or Smelts, and Spire∣grass sixten Inches long, wherefore they call'd that Inlet <HI>Spierings-Bay.</HI> Their Sloop also brought two Sea-Lions, and one hundred and fifty <HI>Penguins</HI> from the <HI>Penguin</HI> Isles, having Sail'd two Leagues up the River; in the interim, the ground being meer Stone, and their Anchors coming home,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Schouten</HI> in great danger.</NOTE> the great Ship drove against a Rock, and at Ebbing Water, broke off the outermost Planks and Iron-Work, and the Ketch also striking on a high Shelf, was at low Ebb two Fathom with her Keel above the Water, and had without peradventure been overset, and bilg'd, but a fresh North-West Wind kept her upright, yet at last, the Weather growing calm, she lean'd, but the Tide coming in very fast, set her afloat, so that she was miraculously sav'd; then setting Sail again to <HI>King's-Island,</HI> they found so many Eggs of black <HI>Mews,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Incredible many Eggs.</NOTE> that one without stir∣ing from his place, might reach above fifty Nests, and in each of them at least three Eggs, which they carry'd aboard by thousands.

On the Hills lay Stones heap'd one upon ano∣ther, which removing, they found Dead Bodies of eleven Foot long; here<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Corps.</NOTE> here they spent their time in cleansing their Ships, and new Sheathing the Ketch, but as they were Tallowing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kotch</HI> burnt.</NOTE> the Flame accidentally got between the Crevisses which immediately taking Fire, in a short time consum'd it to Ashes: The great Ship had gotten a Horn in her Bow, seven Foot under Water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Horn.</NOTE> this Horn being firm without any hollowness, and not unlike a great Elephants Tooth, struck thorow two Ashen and one Oaken Plank, sticking in a Rib of the like Wood, and yet above half a Foot remain'd out to be seen.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Schouten</HI> Weighing Anchor from <HI>Porto Desire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Mews.</NOTE> and Sailing to four and fifty Degrees Southern Latitude, met whole Shoals of Whales, insomuch, that he was fain to Tacque to and again to shun them. Sea-Pies, bigger than Swans, came flying in great numbers aboard, suffering themselves to be taken
<PB N="118" REF="75"/>with the hand. On the North-side they spy'd a high and scraggy Coast spread∣ing it self to the East South-East, which they call'd, <HI>The States Countrey,</HI> that which lay to the Westward of it, <HI>Mourice</HI> of <HI>Nassau,</HI> the Islands in fifty seven Degrees <HI>Barnevield</HI>'s-Isles, and the sharp Point in which lay the Snowy Moun∣tains, Southward of the <HI>Magellan Straights</HI> end the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Hoorn.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Schouten</HI> had now gotten the height of fifty nine Degrees, when he enter'd the South-Sea, through the new passage between <HI>Mauritius</HI> and the <HI>States-Coun∣trey,</HI> which was call'd from his Partner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Straights Le Maire.</NOTE> <HI>The Straights of Le Maire.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isles in the South-Sea.</NOTE>Near the two Isles <HI>Juan Fernando,</HI> they found great store of Fish, after that they view'd these Islands, that lay scatter'd up and down the South-Sea, each of them they nam'd according to their several occasions, calling the first, <HI>The Isle of Dogs;</HI> because they have abundance of Dogs there that could not bark: Another, <HI>The Bottomless Island,</HI> because the Sea was so deep about it, that they could not come to an Anchor. The Inhabitants who go naked, with their Skins pounced full of strange shapes, of blue Snakes, Dragons, and such like Creatures, Salli'd out of the Woods upon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with great Clubs, to which was fasten'd the Sword or Snout of a Sword-Fish, and also with Slings.</P>
<P>Somewhat further they came to <HI>Water-Land,</HI> and <HI>Flyes-Island,</HI> the first so nam'd, because the Shore round about was planted with Trees, but in the middle all lay cover'd with Salt-Water; the other from the <HI>Flyes,</HI> which with incredible numbers troubled the Sea-men four days together.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange entertainment at the Horn Islands.</NOTE>Moreover, the Reception or Entertainment which <HI>Schouten</HI> was welcom'd withal, at the <HI>Hoorn-Islands,</HI> being very remarkable, we will in brief relate:</P>
<P>Anchoring in nine Fathom Water, Shelly ground, before a fresh Rivulet, three <HI>Hollanders</HI> sent to the King were by him courteously entertain'd, who with strange humility, not bow'd, but kissing their Feet fell flat on the ground, and put the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Feet upon his Neck; and after this manner of Salutati∣on, waited upon them aboard: Yet although this King fawn'd so much, and seem'd so humble, yet he was very severe over his Subjects, for finding one that had filch'd a Sword, he not onely brought and restor'd it, but immediate∣ly Executed the Thief before their Faces.</P>
<P><HI>Le Maire</HI> and <HI>Arias Claeszoon</HI> were much honor'd here, for the old and young King put their Crowns on their Heads, curiously Wrought of fine White Fea∣thers, and the end adorn'd with small Red and Green Feathers; they gave also to each of them a Pigeon, White to their Wings, the hinder part Black, and under their Bellies Red.</P>
<P>In the interim, the King of <HI>Water-Island</HI> visited the other, by whom <HI>Le Maire</HI> was treated: When they met, they made strange shews of Honor to each other, but at last shew'd their Salvageness by eating raw Fish, and rudely Dancing before the <HI>Hollanders. Le Maire</HI> going into the Countrey, and climbing up a high Mountain, saw nothing but Morass Wilds, and Vallies, lying under Water: The King and his Retinue here kept him company, during his stay there, when weary with walking, they sate down together under Coco-Nut-Trees; the young King tying a String about his Leg, climb'd with exceeding dexterity up a high Tree, bringing several Coco-Nuts down with him, which he open'd very expeditiously.</P>
<P><HI>Arias Claeszoon,</HI> Rowing ashore one night, found the King sitting under a Roof, resting on four Pillars, where several Naked Women Danc'd before him according to their Musick, which was Taboring upon a hollow Piece of
<PB N="119" REF="75" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Wood, which yielded a murmuring sound without any distinct Tune.</P>
<P>But the two Kings meeting again, the next day Complemented one ano∣ther with more antick and ridiculous Postures, sitting side by side under the Roof, imploring their God, with their Hands folded, and their Heads bow'd to the ground: At this interview, four <HI>Holland</HI> Trumpeters and Drummers stood playing before the King, to the great admiration and amazement of the Islanders, which were near ten thousand gather'd together upon the News of the strangers to attend the two Kings. Soon after a great company of Rusticks came running thither, which had a green Herb call'd <HI>Cava,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cava</HI> a strange Liquor.</NOTE> ty'd about their middle; on a sudden they began all to chaw this <HI>Cava,</HI> throwing that which they had chaw'd into a large Woodden Trough, then putting Water to it, they Kneaded it together; which done, brought the Liquor on their Heads to the two Kings, before whom they kneel'd when they gave them any: Yet not∣withstanding they receiv'd such honor from their Subjects, they shew'd servile respects to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for every King presented them with a Pig, which they first laid on their Heads, then kneeling, put it down at <HI>Le Maires</HI> Feet, and bowing their Heads to the ground, rose again. They wear their Hair long, which Brayded, hung on the left side of their Heads down to their Hips, ty'd at the end with two Knots; but the Nobility had two such Locks: All of them went naked, their Privities onely cover'd. The smallest of the Men exceeded the biggest of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in tallness.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impudent Women.</NOTE> The Women had long Breasts hanging like Satchels down to their Bellies, and so unshamefac'd, that they pro∣stituted themselves to any, in sight of all Men; and still at low Water, their business was to catch Fish, which they greedily eat raw.</P>
<P>After all this Entertainment, Weighing from hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d men.</NOTE> <HI>Schouten</HI> Sail'd along the Coast of <HI>New-Guiny,</HI> where three Boats full of <HI>Negro</HI>'s came Rowing to∣wards them, Slinging very fiercely Stones at them, and hovering about, attended their motion all night. Next morning, seven Boats more coming to their assistance, they set upon the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> but soon fled from their Bullets;
<PB N="116" REF="76"/>yet two of the <HI>Negro</HI>'s were taken, that in each Nostril wore a Ring. Sailing further, several Boats came aboard of them, whereof those that Row'd, break∣ing their <HI>Assagays</HI> or Launces over their Heads, enter'd the Ship; the Hair of their Heads and Beards bedawb'd with Lime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deform'd people.</NOTE> flew about, whilst they Danc'd on the Decks, after they had eaten a good Meal: But they endeavor'd to re∣ward this their kind Entertainment with Treachery, for going ashore, they soon after return'd in greater numbers, and sat upon the Anchors which lay over the Bows of the Ship, and there being a great calm, endeavor'd to Towe the Ship towards the Shore, whilst others threw Stones and Arrows. But so soon as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> firing their Guns Wounded several of them, they all fled, except some which they took Prisoners, whereof one whom they after∣wards call'd <HI>Moses,</HI> did them great service.</P>
<P>But <HI>Le Maire</HI> was amaz'd at nothing more, than when on the next Coast he saw several little Houses built about nine Foot high, out of which many Peo∣ple Issu'd, which were all deform'd, either having Wry Noses, Bow Legs, Squint Eyes, or crooked Backs, and all in one part or another mis-shapen.</P>
<P>At last, Anchoring before <HI>Jacatra,</HI> the Ship was stopt there by order of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, and the Men divided and put aboard those Ships that Sail'd from <HI>India</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> and arriv'd in safety at <HI>Flushing,</HI> after they had Sail'd about the World, in two years and eighteen days.</P>

<P><HI>Jaques L' Hermite</HI> had ten Ships under his Command, Mann'd with sixteen hundred thirty seven Men, and two hundred ninety four Brass and Iron Guns, with which he set Sail from <HI>Goree, Anno</HI> 1623. and coming before <HI>Cape Vincent,</HI> he discover'd eleven <HI>Turkish</HI> Pirates, whom fighting, he beat, and re-took the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships they had made Prize of.</P>
<P>At <HI>Roxents Head, L' Hermite</HI> gave chase to fifteen <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships, and coming up with them, sunk eleven, and took four laden with Sugar. Afterwards An∣choring at <HI>Safia,</HI> he sent the Ship <HI>Over-yssel,</HI> and a Frigat call'd the <HI>Gray-Hound,</HI> to Convoy home the Prizes; afterward being inform'd, that thirty <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships were making to them, Sailing into the Haven <HI>St. Vincent,</HI> the Spring Wa∣ter that he supply'd his empty Cask with being brakkish, caus'd an excoriation of the Guts, which brought the Bloody-Flux, whereby he lost many of his Sea-men; being well entertain'd by the Salvages of <HI>Antonio,</HI> they went on to <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> a Mountainous Point full of Lime-Trees, here they found the Names of <HI>Sr. Francis Drake,</HI> and other <HI>English</HI> cut in a Rock.</P>
<P>After that he put in at the fruitful Island <HI>Annabon,</HI> where he caus'd his Chi∣rurgeon to be Beheaded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vegar</HI> a wicked man.</NOTE>This wicked Man being brought to the Torture, would confess nothing concerning the Crimes objected against him, but being strip'd for Execution, they found a small Bag hanging on his Breast, in which lay a Serpents Skin

<P>The first of <HI>February,</HI> the Fleet came to <HI>Cape de Pemias,</HI> which they know at a great distance, by its high Mountains cover'd with Snow.</P>
<P>In short time after, Sailing by the Mouth of the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>La Maire,</HI> they met with very tempestuous Weather, and seventeen of their Men going ashore, were devour'd by the <HI>Cannibals</HI> of <HI>Terra del Fuogo.</HI> These People being all <HI>Whites,</HI> and of a large Stature, Paint themselves Red, and go stark naked, except some of highest quality who tie a Deer Skin about their Necks; and the Women co∣ver their Nakedness with a piece of Leather: They live in Bowers made of the Branches of Trees, Stak'd three Foot deep, in a round, at bottom, and above like our Tents, Canopy'd, the top of which open, to carry out the Smoke like a Chimney; and have no other Houshold-stuff than some Baskets, in which they lay their few Fishing Implements. They go continually Arm'd with Clubs, Arrows, Slings, and Stone-Knives: Their Boats being only the Trunk of a Tree made hollow, rise up before and behind like a Half-Moon, and are four∣teen, and some sixteen Foot long, and two broad, and Row swifter than a Pinnace with many Oars. Lastly, they are so Salvage, that they seem rather to be Beasts than Men, knowing no Religion, ill Natur'd, cruel and Trea∣cherous.</P>
<P>From hence, passing on, <HI>L' Hermite</HI> refresh'd at the desolate Isle <HI>Fernando,</HI> and so Steer'd his Course to <HI>Calla de Lima,</HI> on whose Coast, taking a <HI>Spanish</HI> Vessel, the Prisoners told him, that their Plate-Fleet had Weigh'd Anchor, and were gone to <HI>Panama;</HI> only the Admiral which carry'd forty Brass Guns, with fifty Merchant-Men, lay close under the Shore, Guarded by three Stone Bulwarks, Fortifi'd with fifty Guns.</P>
<P><HI>L' Hermite</HI> having a design upon these, took three <HI>Spanish</HI> Vessels that were going thither, and at midnight, sent Captain <HI>Adrian Tol, Peter Slobbe,</HI> and <HI>Mein∣dert Egbertszon,</HI> with twelve well Mann'd Boats, furnish'd with Brass Drakes, and Hand-Granado's, to Attaque the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet that lay hard by; and whilst some gave a false Alarm on the North of <HI>Callao,</HI> the Boats Rowing from Ship to Ship, in short time fir'd forty of them; although the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the Shore endeavor'd by their Shot to drive back the Enemy, neither the Fort or Admiral sparing Powder nor Ball.</P>
<P>In this valiant Exploit the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had onely seven Men kill'd, and fifteen Wounded: About break of day, seven of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships floated, burning to∣wards the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, which were as terrible as now Fire-ships, which forc'd them to Weigh Anchor to shun them.</P>
<P>After that, <HI>L' Hermite</HI> took two Ships laden with Wine, a third full of Wood, and a fourth with Wheat: One of these Prizes he fitted and prepar'd for a Fire-ship, and sending her to Board the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admiral, it ran aground with∣in shot of him; whereupon being batter'd by the Admirals Guns, and those from the Bulwarks, and at last taking Fire gave but a small blow, because most part of the Powder had taken Wet.</P>
<P>In this interim, while thus their design went prosperously on, their Admiral <HI>L' Heremite</HI> dy'd, whom they Bury'd on the Island <HI>Lima,</HI> and <HI>Schapenham,</HI> in de∣fiance of the Vice-Roy in <HI>Callao,</HI> caus'd one and twenty <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be hang'd at the Yard-Arm, because he had sent him a scornful Answer on the Proposals concerning the delivery of the Prisoners.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bounds and Division of <HI>Northern America.</HI></NOTE><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving in the first Part of this Volume discours'd at large concerning the Original of the <HI>Americans,</HI> and whether that part of the World call'd <HI>India Occidentalis,</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> were known to the Ancients, or own its Discovery wholly to the Moderns, as also of all the Discoveries that have been made of the several parts thereof, and by whom, we shall now pass on to the Topographical part, describing every particular Province or Region, by giving an Account of their Situation, Temperature, Productions, Nature of the Soil, and Quality of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P><HI>America,</HI> lying Westward of the <HI>Azores,</HI> and the Worlds Meridian, is by some suppos'd to consist of one vast Island, and several lesser ones scatter'd about it: Nor can this Supposition be thought improbable, if, as many think, it be environ'd with Sea on the North side, as towards the East, South, and West it is known to be; East, by the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean; South, by the <HI>Magellanick</HI> Straight; and West, by <HI>Mare del Zur.</HI> But because the North-West Passage, though attempted by many, as <HI>Nelson, Davis, Forbisher, Button, Smith, Hudson,</HI> and others, hath not yet been fully discover'd by any, so that it is not certainly known whether <HI>America</HI> be joyn'd to <HI>Groenland</HI> and the <HI>Arctick</HI> Region, by a continu'd Tract of Land, or sever'd by the Ocean, we shall follow the method of those Geographers, who reputed sufficiently authentick, have divided this <HI>New World</HI> into Islands, and two grand <HI>Peninsula's,</HI> joyn'd together by an <HI>Isthmus,</HI> or Neck of Land, call'd <HI>The Straight of Darien,</HI> by some <HI>The Straight of Panama,</HI> lying almost under the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI> and extending in length from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> Southward, above a hundred <HI>English</HI> Miles, and from East to West seventeen Miles over in the narrowest place. Of these two grand <HI>Peninsula's</HI> the Northern is generally call'd <HI>America Mexicana,</HI> from <HI>Mexico,</HI> the chief City of the Province, properly call'd <HI>Mexicana;</HI> which without doubt was hereto∣fore
<PB N="126" REF="79"/>the most potent, rich, and flourishing of all the Kingdoms of the <HI>Indians,</HI> at least on the North side of the <HI>Isthmus.</HI> In the Division of the several Provinces of <HI>America,</HI> as well those of the Northern as of the Southern Continent, we find so various an Account among the several Geographers that have written of them, (not any two of them agreeing in one and the same order) that to reconcile the dif∣fering methods of so many disagreeing Authors, would be an endless Work; wherefore we shall pitch upon the surest course, and not omitting the mention of any of the Provinces taken notice of by the said Authors, hereby endeavor to take in whatsoever material hath been observ'd by all of them, and by the way take oc∣casion to shew how one differs from another in the distribution of them. Those therefore of the <HI>Northern America</HI> (that as near as can be we may bring many into one) seem most fitly describ'd in this following order: 1. <HI>Estotiland.</HI> 2. <HI>Terra Laboratoris,</HI> or <HI>Nova Britannia.</HI> 3. <HI>Canada,</HI> or <HI>Nova Francia.</HI> 4. <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI> 5. <HI>Norumbegua.</HI> 6. <HI>New England.</HI> 7. <HI>New Netherland,</HI> now call'd <HI>New York,</HI> as being in the possession of the <HI>English.</HI> 8. <HI>Mary-Land.</HI> 9. <HI>Apalchen,</HI> now call'd <HI>Virginia.</HI> 10. <HI>Carolina.</HI> 11. <HI>Florida.</HI> 12. <HI>Jucatan.</HI> 13. <HI>Guatimala,</HI> containing <HI>Chiapa, Vera Paz, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa∣rica, Veragua, Guatimala,</HI> properly so call'd. 14. The Kingdom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or <HI>New Spain,</HI> containing the Arch-bishoprick of <HI>Mexico, Mechoacan, Tlascalla, Guaxata, Panu∣co, Tabasco.</HI> 15. <HI>New Gallicia,</HI> containing <HI>Guadalajara, Xalisco, Chiametla, Couliacan, Cinoloa, Zacatecas.</HI> 16. <HI>New Biscay.</HI> 17. <HI>New Mexico.</HI> 18. <HI>Cibola,</HI> wherein are menti∣on'd <HI>Tontonteac</HI> and <HI>Nova Granada.</HI> 19. <HI>Quivira;</HI> to which by most Authors is added <HI>California,</HI> which being an Island, we thought fit to reserve to be spoken of among the Islands, as also <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> or <HI>New-found Land;</HI> which last lies utmost East, as the other West of <HI>Northern America.</HI> Some there are also (and particularly Monsieur <HI>De Martini</HI>) who among the above-mention'd Provinces have inserted <HI>Groenland,</HI> though doubtless with little reason, since should it be granted that it is not divi∣ded by any Sea, yet it is evident, if any credit may be given to all modern Maps and Globes, that the greatest part of <HI>Groenland</HI> lies in the Hemisphere of the known World, and therefore we have judg'd it most convenient to refer the particular mention thereof to the Description of the <HI>Arctick Region.</HI></P>
<P>The Islands of <HI>Northern America</HI> are 1. <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> or <HI>New-found Land.</HI> 2. The Island of <HI>Assumption.</HI> 3. The <HI>Bermudas,</HI> or <HI>Summer-Islands.</HI> 4. <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> 5. <HI>St. John Porto Rico.</HI> 6. <HI>Cuba.</HI> 7. <HI>Jamaica.</HI> 8. The <HI>Lucayes.</HI> 9.

<P>THat the <HI>English</HI> have been very great Undertakers of Voyages and Discove∣ries towards the North-West, appears by the Denomination of divers Pla∣ces, both from the Persons which have Sail'd thitherward, and also from such of our own Countrey Names as were thought fit to be there fix'd, as beyond the <HI>Arctick Circle,</HI> are Sir <HI>James Lancaster</HI>'s <HI>Sound,</HI> Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs</HI>'s <HI>Cape,</HI> Queen <HI>Annes

The farthest part of Land Northward, between <HI>Hudson</HI>'s <HI>Gulph</HI> and <HI>Hudson</HI>'s <HI>Straight,</HI> betwixt fifty seven and sixty Degrees of Northern Latitude, goes generally by the Name of <HI>Estotiland,</HI> I mean that properly so call'd (for <HI>Estotiland</HI> is by some as largely taken as <HI>Canada,</HI> by <HI>Cluverius, Golnitzius, Peter du Val,</HI> and others, namely for all that Tract of Land extending from that supposed <HI>Straight</HI> of <HI>Ansan,</HI> which di∣vides <HI>America</HI> from <HI>Asiatick Tartary,</HI> as far as the utmost point of Land that shoots toward the <HI>Atlantick Ocean</HI>) which Southerly towards <HI>Terra Laboratoris</HI> is bounded with a River vulgarly call'd <HI>Rio Nevado,</HI> or <HI>The Snowy River. Estotiland</HI> seems to have deriv'd its Name from its lying more Easterly than the rest of the Provinces, and, according as <HI>Nova Britannia</HI> is plac'd in some Charts, might very well be taken for the same, though it hath not been so term'd by any Author, but rather <HI>Terra Laboratoris, Cortereatis,</HI> and <HI>Nova Britannia</HI> are generally receiv'd to be all one.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First discove∣ry of <HI>Estoti∣land.</HI></NOTE>This Province is affirm'd by <HI>Matthias Quadus,</HI> and <HI>J. Antonius Maginus,</HI> to have been the first discover'd Countrey of the new World, and that by <HI>Antonius Zeno,</HI> a Patrician of <HI>Venice,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1390. which was long before the Ex∣pedition of <HI>Columbus,</HI> through the encouragement of <HI>Zichmus,</HI> King of the Isle of <HI>Friezland;</HI> but by whomsoever found out, or at whatsoever time, it is commonly affirm'd to be not ill furnish'd with Provisions of all sorts, as Beasts, Birds, Fish, Fowl, and Fruits, having a Soil indifferent fertile, in respect of the coldness of the Climate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the People.</NOTE> The People in general (for some there are that live wild and salvage up and down the Woods, and go naked, whereas the Clothing of the Countrey is the Skins of Beasts and of Sea-Calves, call'd <HI>Morses</HI>) are reported not onely tolerably civil, but also ingenious and expert both in mechanick Arts, and other necessary Faculties, insomuch that the first Voyagers to this place are said to have observ'd of them upon this first Discovery, That they sow'd Corn, brew'd Beer and Ale, and Traded by Sea to <HI>Greenland, Friezland,</HI> and other places, to the distance of fifteen hundred Miles; and that they were not altogether void of the use of Letters, but that their Character was onely proper to themselves and not intelligible by any other Nation: Moreover, there is a certain Tradition, that there was here and there some little knowledge of the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue amongst them, and that there were found divers <HI>Latine</HI> Books in a Library of one of their Kings; the reason of which, if true, is conjectur'd to be from certain <HI>Europeans</HI> who understood that Language, having in Ages past suffer'd shipwrack upon those Coasts, where chancing to abide either through constraint or choice, they might haply at their Decease leave behind them some Books and other Monuments of the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue. They were ob∣serv'd to use such a kind of Javelin or short Dart, as was known to be us'd by the People of <HI>Java,</HI> and some other Islands of the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> whereupon it seems not wholly improbable, that they might for a long time have entertain'd Traffick and Correspondence with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Morses</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Morses,</HI> or Sea-Calves before mention'd, are about the bigness of a young Heifer, the Hunting of which by the Natives, who take them in great numbers, is to them in the stead of Whale-fishing, which is not there so good, for they draw a great quantity of Train-Oyl out of them. On each side of the Jaw of this amphi∣bious
<PB N="128" REF="80"/>Creature (for it is said to live very much on the Land, as well as in the Water) there sticks out a crooked Tusk, winding downward like an Elephants <HI>Proboscis,</HI> above a Cubit in length, and as white and hard as Ivory: It is esteem'd of great venue, at least it passes for such among those who take it for other than what it is, for it is frequently vended for Unicorns-horn; of which imposture Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> takes notice, and gives a Caution against in his <HI>Vulgar Errors.</HI></P>
<P>This Countrey is suppos'd, and that probably enough, to have store of Brass and Iron Mines; but for the Mines of Gold and Silver, which some have imagin'd there, the Northerly Situation of the Countrey, and by consequence the coldness of the Climate, give sufficient cause to question the truth of any such assertion. What chief Towns, Cities, Rivers and Mountains there are in this Province, is not yet deliver'd by any, onely <HI>Maginus</HI> and <HI>Quadus</HI> make mention of four principal Rivers, which disperse themselves through the Countrey, and take their source out of a great Mountain in the midst thereof.</P>

The deno∣mination of <HI>Terra de Laborador,</HI> or <HI>Laboratoris,</HI> seems probably enough conjectur'd to be from the cultivability (if one may so term it) of the Soil, or its aptness for Cultivation or Tillage; that is, because by the painful Hand of the Labourer or Husband-man it may be rendred so fertile, as to yield all sorts of Grain and Fruits; haply in allusion to that fruitful Countrey of <HI>Campania</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> vulgarly known by the Name of <HI>Terradi Lavoro.</HI> As for the Appellation of <HI>Terra Corterealis,</HI> it need not be question'd, but that it derives it self from <HI>Gaspar Corterealis,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Gentle∣man, who about the Year of our Lord 1500. is thought by some to have made the first discovery of these Parts; though Sir <HI>Sebastian Cabot</HI> a <HI>Venetian,</HI> is more generally believ'd to have been the Man that (under the favour and countenance of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, King of <HI>England</HI>) first discover'd them, at least the adjoyning Island <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> or <HI>New-found Land;</HI> but just onely discover'd, being hinder'd the far∣ther prosecution of that Design, by the important Affairs in which the said King was about that time involv'd; neither did <HI>Corterealis,</HI> whether he was the first, or came after, do any more, for returning within a year after his first setting out, he was never heard of; nor, as <HI>Osorius</HI> a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Historian writes, any of his Com∣pany, being all suppos'd to have been drown'd by Shipwrack; and in like man∣ner <HI>Michael Corterealis,</HI> who the year following set forth with two Ships in quest of his Brother <HI>Gaspar.</HI> Upon which series of Misfortunes the <HI>Portuguese</HI> being wholly discourag'd, and giving over this Design, the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Armorica</HI> or <HI>Bretany</HI> succeed them in it with somewhat better success about the Year 1504. whereupon it came to
<PB N="129" REF="80"/>be term'd <HI>Nova Britannia,</HI> or <HI>New Britain.</HI> The ancient Inhabitants of this place were formerly of a Nature, like the generality of the <HI>American</HI> People, somewhat bruitish and salvage, but by long conversation with the <HI>French,</HI> are said to have cast off their original wildness, and become more civilly manner'd: they are very jealous of their Wives, by report much addicted to Soothsaying, though otherwise having little of Religion, or of any other kind of Learning; they dwell for the most part in Caves under Ground, feed chiefly upon Fish, and are accounted most ex∣pert Archers.

This River is extraordinary full of Fish, among which there is one sort more remarkable than the rest, call'd by the Inha∣bitants <HI>Cadhothuis,</HI> having Heads resembling the Heads of Hares, and Bodies as white as Snow; they are taken for the most part before the Isle <HI>de Lievres.</HI> The Countrey on both sides of the River is pleasant and indifferently fertile, especially towards the South-West, where upwards from the River the Ground rises into many little Hills, invested most of them with Vines, with which and several other sorts of Trees this Countrey abounds, being well water'd with a great many lesser Streams, all of them falling into the River <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>That this Countrey is term'd <HI>New France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">First disco∣very.</NOTE> from having been discover'd by the <HI>French,</HI> at least more fully than before, there needs no question to be made; but whether <HI>Joannes Verrazanus,</HI> under <HI>Francis</HI> the First of <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Sebastian Cabot</HI> before spoken of, were the first in this Discovery, may admit of some dispute: the <HI>Cabots</HI> indeed, (for <HI>John</HI> the Father is by some mention'd to have accompanied his Son) who by all are own'd the first Discoverers of <HI>New-found-Land</HI> and <HI>Terra de Baccalaos,</HI> are also commonly reputed to have first found out the Province of <HI>New France,</HI> together with some parts adjacent, though perhaps it might be upon this Ground that <HI>Terra de Nova,</HI> or <HI>New-found-Land,</HI> not being known at first to be an Island <HI>New France</HI> and that might be taken for one continu'd Province; and it ap∣pears so much the more probable, because <HI>Canada,</HI> or <HI>Nova Francia,</HI> is by some call'd <HI>Terra Nova;</HI> however it be, or whoever were the first Adventurers, <HI>Quarteri</HI> and
<PB N="130" REF="81"/><HI>Champlain</HI> are the two <HI>French</HI>-men that have gain'd so much fame by making a more ample and particular search into these parts, that this Province may seem from thence to have sufficient claim to the Title of <HI>New France,</HI> whereof that part more especially so call'd, lies on the North-side of the River <HI>Canada,</HI> and Southward to <HI>Terra Corterealis.</HI> The Winter is here very long, and so much the more severe by reason of a cold North-West Wind which blows most part of the Winter Season, and brings with it so thick a Snow, that it continues upon the Ground most com∣monly till after <HI>May.</HI> The Countrey is for the most part wooddy, but in the Champain parts thereof very fruitful of Corn, and all sorts of Grain, especially Pulse: It hath also Fish, Fowl, wild Deer, Bears, Marterns, and Foxes in abun∣dance, and of Hares such plenty, that one of the little Islands belonging to this Pro∣vince, is by the <HI>French</HI> nam'd <HI>L' Isle des Lievres,</HI> or <HI>The Island of Hares:</HI> But the most peculiar Commodity belonging to this Countrey is the <HI>Esurgnuy,</HI> a kind of Shell-Fish, extraordinary white, and approv'd of singular vertue for the stanching of Blood; to which purpose they make Bracelets of them, not onely for their own use, but also to vend them to others; but <HI>John de Laet</HI> and others have observ'd no other than a superstitious use of them amongst the Salvages, in their Funeral Rites for the Dead: the manner of their taking it is very remarkable; for when any one is condemn'd to die, or taken Prisoner, they cut off all his fleshy parts in long slices, and then throw him into the River, where they let him lie twelve hours, and at last pulling him out again find his Wounds full of <HI>Esurgnui.

<P><Q>This City (saith he) said to be the Seat and Residence of a King of this Country whom the Natives, at least some of them, acknowledge and reverence, carrying him sometimes in great pomp upon their Shoulders sitting upon a Carpet of Beasts Skins, is situate far within Land, at a distance of six or seven Leagues from the River <HI>Canada,</HI> and is a kind of fortifi'd place, encompass'd about with a three∣fold Range of Timber Ramparts one within another, of about two Rods high from the Ground, with cross Planks, or pieces of Timber jutting out, on purpose to hinder an Enemy's Scaling or getting up; towards the top there is as it were a Scaffold or Gallery fram'd, from whence they may throw down Stones (of which there is always good store ready, or what else to annoy the Assailants: It hath one onely Gate for Entrance, and that likewise well fortifi'd after their manner: There are guess'd to be in it fifty or sixty great Houses, built (as the maner of the <HI>Americans</HI> that live in Houses usually is) in a square Figure, each side being about fifty Foot long, or more, and sixteen or twenty broad, but not many Stories high; and in the midst of the Court or void space; a place to make their Fire, and do other necessary work about it. Moreover the Territory round about this Town is both rich in Soil, and pleasant in Prospect.</Q></P>
<P>Besides these three above-mention'd Towns there are several others, which are not untaken notice of in the most modern Descriptions and Maps, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Stadac,</HI> or <HI>Stadacone,</HI> somewhat Westward of a small Isle call'd <HI>The Isle d' Orleance;</HI> 2. <HI>Que∣beque,</HI> which being made a Colony of the <HI>French,</HI> and the Natives expell'd, came to be Entituled <HI>St. Croix;</HI> 3. <HI>Tadoussac,</HI> which lies in that part of the Countrey denomi∣nated from the River <HI>Saguenay,</HI> and by some call'd at this day <HI>Nouvelle Biscaye,</HI> a de∣lightful place, and full of stately Trees, and hath likewise a good and safe Haven,
<PB N="131" REF="81"/>capable of receiving twenty Ships; 4. <HI>Trois Rivieris,</HI> or three Rivers; 5. <HI>Mon∣real;</HI> 6. <HI>Sillery;</HI> 7. <HI>Richelieu;</HI> besides two strong Castles or Forts, <HI>Franceroy</HI> and St. <HI>Lewis;</HI> the First built by <HI>Monsieur Robeval</HI> at his Landing here, about the Year 1540. the other design'd for a Colony, in the Year 1611. by <HI>Monsieur Champlany,</HI> but hinder'd by the Invasion of the <HI>Iroquois.</HI> The smaller Rivers that run out of the Gulph of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and the grand River <HI>Canada</HI> towards the North, on which side chiefly lies this Province, are, 1. <HI>Chichesedec,</HI> 2. St. <HI>Margarite,</HI> 3. <HI>Lesquemin,</HI> 4. <HI>Saquenay,</HI> before-mention'd, 5. <HI>Montonne;</HI> and on the South side, the River <HI>Mary.</HI> The principal Tribes of the ancient Natives of this Countrey were; on the North side of <HI>Canada</HI> the <HI>Canadans,</HI> the <HI>Betisiamites,</HI> the <HI>Hurons,</HI> the <HI>Algoniquins,</HI> the <HI>Quenongebins,</HI> the <HI>Algoingequins,</HI> the <HI>Attagopantans,</HI> the <HI>Atticameques,</HI> the <HI>Nipisiriniens;</HI> and on the South side, the <HI>Etechemins,</HI> and the chief Heads or Princes of these Tribes were call'd <HI>Sagamores.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jaques Quartier</HI> Complementing their King <HI>Agouthanna,</HI> took up his Quarters a whole Winter at St. <HI>Croix,</HI> a Sandy Promontory, overflow'd by the River <HI>Canada,</HI> into which falls the Lake <HI>de Champlain,</HI> grown round about with Chestnut Trees; in it breeds the strange Fish call'd <HI>Chaousarou,</HI> generally ten Foot long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Fish nam'd <HI>Chaou∣saron.</HI></NOTE> with Heads like Sharks, and two rows of Teeth-in their Mouths, their Skins full of strong Scales, which are sufficient Shields against Swords and Lances, are great devourers of other Fish and Fowls, which they take after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> they swim a∣mongst Reeds or Canes, and lie still with their Mouths open; whereat the Birds sitting down upon them, are immediately swallow'd.</P>
<P>The Natives of <HI>Nova Francia</HI> anoint their bodies with Oil; in the Summer they go naked, and in the Winter mantle themselves in Furs. Their Warlike Accoutre∣ments are Darts and Clubs, but chiefly great Shields. They are revengeful, cruel, and fraudulent; their Women common to all Men, from fifteen to twenty, after which, Marrying, they become very Chaste. Their Diet is <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, fresh and salt Fish, Venison, <HI>Buffalo's</HI> and Beavers flesh; wiping their Fingers (when greasie) on their Heads, or their Dogs backs, which wait for the Scraps.</P>
<P>At that season when the Corn covers the ground, to any heighth, they eat Cockles, Dogs, dead Caryon, and the Skins wherewith they Clothe themselves. When they have eaten their fill, they tabering on their Bellies, cry, <HI>Tapoue Mikispoun,</HI> that is, <HI>Ve∣rily I am satisfi'd.</HI> They give their Sick a speedy Cure, either immediately killing them, or inhumanely exposing them to the Woods, to be devour'd by ravenous Beasts, but if they die suddenly, they in howling tone pronounce <HI>Ove, Ove,</HI> thereby to chase the Souls of the Deceas'd out of their Huts; they stick the bodies on Wood∣den Prongs, cover them with Bark, and lay their Clothes and Arms by them; all what remains of the Funeral Feasts is burnt, whereas at other times, what e're is brought on their Table they eat, though ready to burst. They make the first Proofs of their Valour by undergoing a most prodigious Torment, in this man∣ner;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange proof of Va∣lor.</NOTE> Two by consent tie their naked Arms together, on which they suffer burning Sulphur to be pour'd, till the flesh starts from the bone; if either of them shrink, or pull back his Arm, he is accounted by them ever after as an ignominious and base Coward. They call God <HI>Atahocan,</HI> and believe that one <HI>Messou</HI> first drowning the world by a general Deluge, restor'd it again after a wonderful manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wonderful opinion of God.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Messou</HI> hunting with Wolves, they scented a Deer which being closely pursu'd, leap'd into a neighboring Pool, the Wolves following it, were drown'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flood.</NOTE> <HI>Messou</HI> coming thither, stood amaz'd at a Bird, which inform'd him, that the Wolves were pluck'd down, and held fast in the bottom by horrible Monsters, where∣upon he diving, the Pool immediately began to swell, and at last the whole sur∣face
<PB N="132" REF="82"/>of the Earth to be overflow'd. <HI>Messou</HI> afterwards let a Raven flie to fetch a Clod of Earth, but in vain, for all the Land lay drown'd in Water; at last a Rat diving to the bottom, brought a lump of Earth, out of which <HI>Messou</HI> restor'd the World; shot Arrows into Trees, which became fruitful Branches. Here also re∣side an innumerable many <HI>Sorcerers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sorcerers.</NOTE> call'd <HI>Pillotoa</HI>'s, which sometimes being pos∣sess'd with a Frenzy, scourge themselves in a terrible manner, insomuch that the Blood runs down by their sides: These People are held in great esteem, for they boast themselves to have their Original from Heaven upon this occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They boast their Extract from Heaven. Their strange Relation con∣cerning it.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Ataensic,</HI> a certain great Queen or Goddess, residing above the Stars, had a sick Hus∣band, who Dreamt that he should be restor'd to his former health so soon as he could but taste of the Fruits which grew on a Tree, whereby the Family of Hea∣ven were kept alive, but that the Tree must needs be cut down, which <HI>Ataensic</HI> obeying, gave onely two blows, when the Tree, to her great amazement, fell out of Heaven down to the Earth; there being by this means nothing more left to eat in Heaven: <HI>Ataensic</HI> follow'd the fallen Tree, and being big with Child, bare a Daughter, which growing up to years, was Deliver'd of two Daughters, <HI>viz. Taoviscaron</HI> and <HI>Jouskeha,</HI> the eldest of which slew the youngest: By these Fables we may discern their obscure knowledge of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood, <HI>Eve</HI>'s Fall, and <HI>Cain</HI>'s Mur∣der. No less ridiculous is that which they believe concerning the Creation, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Waters were inclos'd within a Frog, which <HI>Jouskeha</HI> causing to be cut open, all Streams and Rivers issuing out, had their Original from thence: This done, <HI>Jouskeh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> open'd a Pit, out of which came all sorts of Beasts; they ascribe a Bodily shape to the Soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As also of the Creation, and Souls of the Deceased.</NOTE> as also Immortality, but that they live together in a great Village towards the West; from which removing sometimes, they knock at the Doors of their former Friends in the Night, and sow deserted Grounds: That the Journey towards the Village in which the Souls reside is very strange; the High∣way thither beginning at a Rock nam'd <HI>Ecaregniendi,</HI> where they first Paint their Faces, which done, they go to a Hut inhabited by an old Man, nam'd <HI>Osotrach,</HI> who takes the Brains out of the Souls Head; after which they walk to a broad Ri∣ver, which they cross on a narrow Plank or Bridge, on which a Dog encountring, forces them to leap into the Water, which carries them down to the foremention'd Village. They acknowledge one <HI>Oki</HI> for the Governor of the Sea, and seasons of the Year:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Rock.</NOTE> They also Religiously Worship the Rock <HI>Tsankchi Arasta,</HI> which they believe some ages ago was once a Man, but afterward Transform'd into a Rock, in which a <HI>Daemon</HI> resides, who can make their Journies either successful or dan∣gerous, wherefore they offer him Tobacco.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thunder.</NOTE> Their opinion of Thunder is like∣wise very ridiculous, for they say that the Devil endeavoring to vomit a horrible Serpent, by straining to evacuate the same, rents the Clouds, and occasions Thun∣der. Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thakabech</HI> Idol.</NOTE> They relate of a Dwarf call'd <HI>Thakabech,</HI> who climb'd on the top of a Tree, which by his blowing thereon grew so high, that it touch'd the Clouds, and <HI>Thakabech</HI> easily stept into them, where he found all sorts of delight and plea∣sure; but having a Sister on Earth, descended again along the Tree, and fetching his Sister, conducted her above the Stars; mean while, <HI>Thakabech</HI> going in the Night to see if he had taken any thing in his Net which he had pitch'd, found it full of Fire, and observing the same very narrowly, saw that he had taken the Sun, but durst not approach the same, by reason of its great heat; but making a Mouse, sent her to gnaw the Net in pieces, and set the Sun at liberty.

<HEAD>SECT. V. Accadia, or Nova Scotia.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NOva Scotia,</HI> or <HI>New Scotland,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Accadia,</HI> is commonly accounted a part of <HI>New France,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> that part which lying on the South side of the River <HI>Canada,</HI> and shooting South-Easterly into a bosom of the Sea, forms it self into a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> between the Gulph of St. <HI>Lawrence;</HI> and the Bay <HI>Francoise</HI>) nevertheless, because of the different concernments of this part of the Countrey, in regard the right of claim to several places in this district; most especially of all <HI>No∣va Francia</HI> besides, hath been long in dispute between <HI>Us</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> it will be most convenient to Treat of it apart; and because the Series of Affairs, from its first discovery, till of late years, appears faithfully represented on the <HI>English</HI> part, in a Remonstrance Address'd to the King and Council by Sir <HI>Lewis Kirk,</HI> and his Brother <HI>John Kirk</HI> Esquire; it will not be amiss (onely adding some few things up∣on occasion) to follow exactly the Narration of Affairs, deliver'd in the said Re∣monstrance to this effect.</P>
<Q><P>1. THe whole Tract or Space of Land in <HI>America,</HI> lying on either side of the River <HI>Canada,</HI> which a long time since were known by the Names of <HI>Nova Francia,</HI> and <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> were at first discover'd and found out by the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, King of <HI>England;</HI> which Expedition was first undertaken at the Command and Charges of that King; afterwards further'd and carry'd on by the favorable Aspect of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> so that in process of time, for many years together, the said Tract of Ground, with abso∣lute Priviledge of free Commerce, fell under the Jurisdiction and Power of the Crown of <HI>England:</HI> Neither was it unto any other <HI>Christian</HI> Princes, or their Sub∣jects more clearly known or discover'd, untill about the year 1600. some of the <HI>French</HI> understanding the benefit arising by Traffique in the River of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> having formerly seiz'd upon that Tract of Land, situate on the North side of the said Floud or River <HI>Canada,</HI> did afterwards, in <HI>Anno</HI> 1604. (<HI>under the Con∣duct of</HI> Peter de Gua, <HI>Lord of</HI> Monts, <HI>who in the year</HI> 1606. <HI>was follow'd by</HI> Monsieur de Pourtrincourt) Possess themselves of <HI>L' Accadie,</HI> lying on the South side of the said River, naming the whole <HI>Nova Francia,</HI> challenging to themselves for many years, at least <HI>de facto,</HI> the Possession thereof, with sole liberty of Com∣merce there.</P>
<P>2. In <HI>Anno</HI> 1621. King <HI>James</HI> of <HI>England</HI> looking upon the Possession gotten there by the <HI>French,</HI> as upon an Invasion, did by his Letters Patents Grant un∣to Sir <HI>William Alexander</HI> a <HI>Scotchman</HI> (<HI>Created afterwards Earl of</HI> Sterling, <HI>by King</HI> Charles <HI>the First</HI>) <HI>L' Accadie,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Nova Scotia;</HI> who in the year 1622, and 1623. <HI>after Sir</HI> Samuel Argal <HI>had driven out</HI> Biard <HI>and</HI> Masse, <HI>and demolishing their Fort, carry'd them Prisoners to</HI> Virginia; having obtain'd the Possession thereof, they Planted a Colony therein, and kept Possession for about two years after, until such time, as upon the Marriage of his Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, with the Lady <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> the said <HI>L' Accadie,</HI> or <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> was by Order of the King of <HI>England</HI> return'd into the Possession of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>3. Afterwards a War arising between his Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, and
<PB N="134" REF="83"/><HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII. <HI>Anno</HI> 1627, and 1628. Sir <HI>David Kirk</HI> and his Brethren and Rela∣tions of <HI>England,</HI> did by vertue of his Majestie's Commission, send to Sea (at their great charge) first three, afterwards nine Ships, with Warlike Preparations for recovering of the Possession of the said Lands, lying on either side of the said River <HI>Canada,</HI> and to expel and eject all the <HI>French</HI> Trading in those Parts, wherein they had good Success; and in <HI>Anno</HI> 1627. did there seize upon about eighteen of the <HI>French</HI> Ships, wherein were found a hundred thirty five Pieces of Ord∣nance, design'd for relief of the <HI>Royal Fort</HI> in <HI>L' Accadie,</HI> and <HI>Quebeck</HI> in <HI>Nova Francia,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Monsieur de Rocmand,</HI> and <HI>Monsieur de la Tour,</HI> Fa∣ther of <HI>de la Tour,</HI> Governor of the said <HI>Royal Fort,</HI> whom, together with the said Ships and Guns, they brought into <HI>England;</HI> and in the year 1628. they Possess'd themselves of the whole Region of <HI>Canada</HI> or <HI>Nova Francia,</HI> situate on the North side of the River, together with the Fort or Castle of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> Sir <HI>Lewis Kirk</HI> be∣ing then constituted Governor of the place, the <HI>French</HI> being then either expell'd or convey'd into <HI>England,</HI> and the Arms of the King of <HI>England</HI> being publickly there erected, and every where plac'd; and before the year 1628. it was brought to pass by the said Sir <HI>William Alexander,</HI> (assisted both by the advice and charge of the said <HI>Kirk</HI>) that in the parts of <HI>L' Accadie,</HI> or <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> on the South side of the River <HI>Canada,</HI> the whole place, with the Forts thereon built, being by him subdu'd, presently came under the Power of the King of <HI>England;</HI> that Region on the South side falling into the Possession of the said Sir <HI>William Alexander,</HI> and that on the North side, into the Possession of the <HI>Kirks.</HI></P>
<P>4. On <HI>March</HI> 29. 1632. a Peace being concluded between King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, and <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII. it was amongst other things on the part of the King of <HI>England</HI> agreed, That all the Forts, as well in <HI>L' Accadie</HI> as in <HI>Nova Francia,</HI> should be restor'd into the Possession of the Subjects of the <HI>French</HI> King, which was ex∣actly perform'd on the part of the <HI>English,</HI> though to the great damage of the <HI>Kirks;</HI> but on the part of the <HI>French,</HI> although it was agreed, as in the fourth and fifth Articles of Peace is set down, (to which reference is had) yet nothing was ever perform'd of their parts; so that the <HI>Kirks</HI> did thereupon suffer loss, to the value of five thousand Pounds <HI>Sterl.</HI> which were to be paid them by <HI>Monsieur de Cane</HI> a <HI>French-man,</HI> but remain unpaid to this day.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Anno</HI> 1633. the King of <HI>England</HI> taking notice, that although the Forts and Castles, according to the League, were deliver'd up into the Possession of the <HI>French,</HI> (especially such as had been erected during their Possession thereof) yet that his <HI>English</HI> Subjects were not to be excluded from Trade or free Commerce, in those Regions that were first Discover'd and Possess'd by his Subjects, did, with the advice of his Council, by his Letters Patents, Dated <HI>May</HI> 11. 1633. upon consideration had of the Expences, which the said <HI>Kirks</HI> had laid out upon the re∣ducing of that Countrey with the Fort of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> to the value of 50000<SUP>lb</SUP>.; and also of their ready obeisance in resigning up the same on his Royal Command, Grant unto Sir <HI>Lewis Kirk,</HI> and his Brother <HI>John Kirk</HI> and his Associates, for the term of thirty one years (not yet expir'd) full Priviledge, not only of Trade and Commerce in the River <HI>Canada,</HI> and places on either side adjacent, but also to Plant Colonies, and build Forts and Bulwarks where they should think fit.</P>
<P>6. By vertue of which Commission, Sir <HI>Lewis Kirk</HI> and his Brother <HI>John Kirk,</HI> and his Associates, in the Moneth of <HI>February</HI> next following, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1633. set forth a Ship call'd <HI>The Merry Fortune,</HI> Laden with Goods of a considerable va∣lue, consign'd to those parts, where during her Trading there, without any just offence given; and in time of Peace, she was by the <HI>French</HI> forceably seiz'd on,
<PB N="135" REF="83"/>and carry'd into <HI>France,</HI> and her Lading, as if she had been lawful Prize, Confi∣scated; whereupon the <HI>Kirks</HI> suffer'd loss, to the value of twelve thousand Pounds. And although the Lord <HI>Scudamore,</HI> Ambassador in <HI>France,</HI> by the King of <HI>Englands</HI> special Command, and the said <HI>John Kirk</HI> being there in Person, by the King's Command, did often earnestly urge, that the Moneys due to the said <HI>Kirks,</HI> and the said Ship, with her Lading, might be restor'd, which for no other cause had been seiz'd upon and sold, but only for that by the King's Commission she was found Trading at <HI>Canada;</HI> yet he could obtain nothing, but after some years fruitless endeavors return'd into <HI>England</HI> without accomplishing his desires.</P>
<P>7. In the year 1654. <HI>Cromwel,</HI> although an unjust Usurper of the Government, yet upon consideration of the Premises, taking a just occasion for requiring the Possession of <HI>L' Accadie,</HI> sends forth several Ships under the Command of one <HI>Sedgwick,</HI> who by vertue of the Authority granted him by <HI>Cromwel,</HI> assaulted and subdu'd the aforesaid Forts in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and restor'd them into the Possession of the <HI>English:</HI> And although in the year 1655. a League of firm Peace and Amity being concluded between <HI>Cromwel</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador did often urge the Restitution to the Possession of the <HI>French;</HI> yet for the same cau∣ses aforesaid, which had mov'd <HI>Cromwel</HI> to seize upon them, it was thought fit still to retain the Possession of them; and although according to the purport of the twenty fifth Article of the Peace, Commissioners on both sides were to be ap∣pointed for the deciding and determining that Controversie; yet nothing was done therein, neither did the Commissioners ever meet within three Moneths, as in the twenty fourth Article of the Treaty was provided and agreed: So that now the case is very clear, that the Possession to the <HI>English</HI> remains firm and just, and that the Forts and Bulwarks before specifi'd, are without all peradventure under the Power and Jurisdiction of the King of <HI>England.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Since the Restauration of his present Majesty, the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador represent∣ing unto the King the Pretensions of the <HI>French</HI> unto the several Forts and other places in <HI>Accadie,</HI> and urging the non-performance of the Articles of Agreement between <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, mov'd the King of <HI>England, As a pro∣fess'd Enemy to all Violence,</HI> for a Restitution of all the Forts and other places which were then in the possession of the <HI>English:</HI> Not long after which, whether upon the Ambassadors request, or upon other important Affairs intervening, or upon what other ground soever it were, the <HI>French</HI> were suffer'd to re-enter on the foresaid places, and do yet keep Possession of them, till such time as the <HI>English</HI> claim under the just Title of the <HI>Kirks,</HI> shall meet with some fit occasion of being reviv'd.</P>
<P>That which we suppose gives the <HI>French</HI> so much the more confidence in their claim of this Country, is their presumption upon the Expedition of <HI>James Quartier,</HI> whom they will have to be the first Discoverer, if not Possessor, not onely of the Isle of <HI>Assumption,</HI> but also of this Coast of <HI>Nova Francia,</HI> not taking notice it seems of <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh.</P>
<P>The chief places of Note in this Countrey, are, 1. <HI>Port Royal,</HI> a Colony of <HI>French,</HI> said to have been Planted there by <HI>Monsieur de Montz</HI> in 1604. by report, capable of receiving a thousand Ships; and in 1613. (the <HI>French</HI> being driven out by Sir <HI>Sa∣muel Argal,</HI> Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> who took Prisoners <HI>Biard</HI> and <HI>Masse,</HI> and demo∣lish'd the Fort at <HI>Port Royal</HI>) given by Patent, as aforemention'd, to Sir <HI>William Alex∣ander;</HI> afterwards by him sold again to the <HI>French;</HI> then in the time of <HI>Oliver Crom∣wel</HI> re-taken by Major <HI>Sedgwick;</HI> lastly, re-possess'd by the <HI>French.</HI> 2.

<P>The most noted People of the ancient Inhabitants of <HI>Accadie</HI> were the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> ly∣ing most South-Westerly upon the Sea Coast, who us'd to drive a great Trade in Beavers and other Commodities.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable manner of li∣ving.</NOTE>The Inhabitants thereof differ very much from other Salvages, for they shave all the Hair from the Crown of their Head, wear long Locks behind, pleited to∣gether, and stuck full of Feathers, Paint their Faces black and red, go arm'd with Clubs, Bows, Pikes, and Arrows pointed with Fish-bones: They Till their Ground very handsomly, and divide their Fields with Hedges; they Plant To∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cco, Vines, Cabbages, <HI>Maiz,</HI> and divers Colour'd Beans; the stalks of the <HI>Maiz</HI> serve in stead of Poles for their Beans to run up upon.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarka∣ble Transacti∣ons of some <HI>Jesuits.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Jesuits</HI> being also inform'd thereof, obtain'd leave of the Queen to send <HI>Peter Biard</HI> and <HI>Euemond Masse</HI> thither, on pretence, that <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth had him∣self promis'd them the same Priviledge in his Life time. But the Merchants at <HI>Diep,</HI> which were concern'd in the new Plantations with <HI>Poutrincourt,</HI> opposing the go∣ing over of the foremention'd <HI>Jesuits,</HI> express'd themselves very violent against them, and laid to their charge the Blood of the late King, which they said was yet reaking in <HI>Paris: What assurance</HI> (alleadg'd they) <HI>had their Goods which were in the Custody of Men inclin'd to the</HI> Spaniards? <HI>Must the</HI> Christian Religion <HI>be promulgated?

<P>At this time all things going favorably with the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> they made themselves Masters of <HI>Port Royal,</HI> and began to raise a Fort on the River <HI>Pemtagovet;</HI> but there their happy Proceedings were stop'd, for Captain <HI>Argal</HI> before-mention'd, Sailing thither in vindication of the <HI>English,</HI> was encounter'd by <HI>du Thet,</HI> (who firing the first Gun on <HI>Argal,</HI> was by him taken off with Chain-shot) and taking <HI>Biard</HI> and <HI>Masse,</HI> carry'd them Prisoners to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and dismantled the Fort built at <HI>Port Roy∣al,</HI> after which it was by King <HI>James</HI> given by Patent to Sir <HI>William Alexander,</HI> as hath been already related, together with what of most remarkable hath happen'd since.</P>

<P><HI>NOrumbegua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence de∣nominated.</NOTE> lying between <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> Northward, and <HI>New England</HI> South∣ward, is so utterly not taken notice of by many as a distinct Province, that it might seem to be swallow'd up and lost in the two Countreys be∣tween which it lies, or at least to be thought a part of <HI>Virginia</HI> or <HI>New England</HI> (for <HI>Virginia</HI> largely taken is said to contain <HI>New England, Novum Belgium,</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> especially so call'd) and that so much the rather, because the <HI>Bessabees,</HI> accounted by <HI>Sanson d' Abbeville</HI> an ancient People of <HI>New England,</HI> are written to have liv'd near the River <HI>Penobscot,</HI> which is reckon'd to be the same with <HI>Pemtegovet,</HI> or (as some will have it) <HI>Norumbegua,</HI> from which, or from a certain great City of that Name, the Country for fancy's sake must needs be denominated; but since most com∣monly we find it nam'd and treated of apart, it will not be improper to follow that method, carrying the Bounds of <HI>New England</HI> no farther Northward than the River <HI>Quinnebequi</HI> or <HI>Sagadahoc,</HI> and so determining the main part of this Countrey to that space between the aforesaid River and <HI>Pemtegovet,</HI> excepting a small Sou∣therly portion upon the Banks of the River <HI>Chovacovet;</HI> so that it appears chiefly situate under the forty third Degree of Northern Latitude.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns and Cities not certainly known.</NOTE>As for the Towns or Cities of this Province, there is but a very uncertain ac∣count to be given, forasmuch as the pretended great City <HI>Norumbegua,</HI> from whence the Province should take its Appellation, is not acknowledg'd by any of the most authentick modern Writers, nor in any late Voyage or Discovery any mention made either of that or any other considerable Town or City. Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> suppo∣seth it to be no other than <HI>Agguncia,</HI> a poor little Village, that seems compos'd of a company of Hutts or Sheaves, cover'd with the Skins of Beasts, or the Barks of Trees. But the most favourable conjecture is, that it might haply be the Ruines of an ancient Town, which the Natives call'd <HI>Arambeck,</HI> and had probably deserted it long before the arrival of the <HI>Europeans</HI> in those parts; however, it is not very probable that the Name of the Countrey should be deriv'd from this City, if ever there were any such, or from the River, which appears to have been term'd <HI>No∣rumbegua</HI> on purpose to make way for this derivation, whereas <HI>Pomtegovet</HI> is the an∣cient Appellation that properly belongs to it; nor hath any modern one been ap∣ply'd to it but that of <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> by <HI>Buno</HI> in his <HI>Comment</HI> upon <HI>Philip Cluverius,</HI> upon what ground is hard to tell, since it is observ'd by <HI>Heylin</HI> and others, to be neither large, nor otherwise much to be commended, being Navigable not above twenty or thirty Miles, in respect of its many great Cataracts and Falls of Water, an In∣convenience with which many other Rivers of <HI>America</HI> are prejudic'd, and rendred impassable.</P>
<P>Before and about the Mouth of this River, which is judg'd to be about eight or nine Miles broad, lie many small Islands, or rather Hills, inviron'd with Water, the chiefest of which is by the <HI>French</HI> call'd <HI>La Haute Isle,</HI> from the high and Moun∣tainous appearance of it to those that see it from afar off at Sea.</P>
<P>The aforemention'd <HI>Buno,</HI> though he names, as belonging to <HI>Norumbega,</HI> these several places, <HI>viz. Porto del Refugio, Porto Reale, Paradiso, Flora,</HI> and <HI>Angolema,</HI> from some obscure <HI>French</HI> testimonies, without particularising any Author, yet he after∣wards confesses, that the Names given by the <HI>French,</HI> and those apply'd by the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> are so various and disagreeing, and breed such a confusion, that no Charts or Descriptions had concluded upon either.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="85"/>
<P>As for those who will have <HI>Norumbega</HI> deriv'd from <HI>Norwegia</HI> in respect of a Co∣lony brought thither from <HI>Norwey,</HI> if the Etymologie be not a little too much forc'd, the Invention may pass well enough till a better be found out.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The tempe∣rature and nature of its Soil.</NOTE>In this Countrey the temperature of the Air is not bad, nor the Soil unfruitful, if it were well cultivated, chiefly towards the Rivers, and where it is not either overgrown with Woods, or craggy with Hills and mountainous Rocks: neither are the Woods unprofitable, for they afford good Timber, and all kind of necessary and useful Wood, especially Beeches, Fir-trees, Wallnut-trees, and other Nuts: The Plains are very pleasant, and yield good Pasturage, onely the Maritime Coasts are so shallow and full of Sands, that the Sailing near them is accounted some∣what dangerous; and this may be imagin'd to be the reason that no Authors have yet met with any Ports or Havens belonging to this Countrey, which they have thought worthy their notice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. New England.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>Canada</HI> is by some accounted a general Province, containing <HI>New France, L' Accadie, Norumbega,</HI> and other places, so under <HI>Virginia</HI> largely taken, are comprehended <HI>New England, New Netherlands,</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> properly so call'd; however, since that part which vulgarly goes under the Name of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New England</HI> were possess'd, if not discover'd, at several times, and their Plan∣tations promoted and propagated upon several occasions, and by distinct Interests, and since <HI>New England</HI> hath been look'd upon as a place considerable enough for Persons of very eminent quality to concern themselves in it, we rather are induc'd to consider this Countrey as a principal part, than as any way depending on, or being any Branch or Portion of <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of <HI>New Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE>It lies between <HI>Norumbega,</HI> which it hath Northward, and <HI>New Netherlands</HI> South∣ward, from forty one to forty five Degrees of Northern Latitude, in the midst of the temperate Zone, and paralell to <HI>France</HI> and some part of <HI>Italy</HI> in the Western Hemisphere, so that one would think it should enjoy the same temperature of Air; but the contrary is found, for that part which borders upon the Sea is colder, partly by reason that the Sea-waves break the reflexion of the Sun-beams, partly by reason of the abundance of Vapors, which mounting upward, abate the ardor of them; but the more Inland parts of the Countrey are indifferently warm: Moreover it hath been found by certain experience, that those Countreys which look to wards the East, or Sun-rising, are colder than those which lie towards the West, or Sun-setting, and those that have the Evening Winds on them, warmer than those which have the Morning Winds; which being so, it should follow, that the temperature of the Air in those Regions is peculiar to the Bodies of those of our Nation, who being accustom'd to a Climate somewhat temperate, are nei∣ther able to endure extremity of Cold, nor immoderate Heat: Yet there are who affirm, that <HI>New England,</HI> though situate in the midst of the temperate Zone, never∣theless feels both extremities of the two opposite Zones, in the Summer the heat of the Torrid, and in the Winter the cold of the Frigid.</P>
<P>As for the first discovery of this Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First disco∣very.</NOTE> it is not to be expected otherwise
<PB N="140" REF="86"/>than that of the discovery of those other Countreys hitherto discours'd of, that is to say very uncertain; but because the <HI>French</HI> boast of <HI>Joannes Verrazanus</HI> (who though an <HI>Italian,</HI> was employ'd by the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Francis</HI> the First) as the first Discoverer, not onely of <HI>Nova Francia,</HI> as hath been already intimated, but also of this Coun∣trey and the adjoyning Coast and Regions, we shall not think it impertinent to give from their own Relations, a brief view of his Voyage, and afterwards a parti∣cular Description of the <HI>English</HI> Plantations there, and of their Transactions, both one with another, and between them and the Nations. The Narration of <HI>Verra∣zanus</HI>'s Voyage is as followeth:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable Voyage of <HI>Verrazanus.</HI></NOTE><Q>ON command of the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Francis</HI> the First, <HI>John Verrazanus, Anno</HI> 1524. setting Sail Westward from the <HI>Canary</HI> Isles, discover'd a low <HI>American</HI> Coast, in thirty four Degrees North Latitude, inhabited by naked People, which be∣hind the sandy Hills facing the Sea, Manur'd many fruitful Plains. Then Sail∣ing a hundred Leagues along the Shore Northerly, he view'd a Countrey full of Vines, which grew up amongst the Boughs of high Trees; and Sailing up a pleasant River, Landed on the Island <HI>Clandia,</HI> full of woody Mountains: thence he stood for the main Continent; where after having visited a King, Clad in wrought Deer-skin, he Sail'd by a Bay, at whose Mouth appear'd a Rock in an Inlet, twenty Leagues; where appear'd five small Isles, all of them exceeding fruitful. After this (being got a hundred and fifty Leagues to the Northward) he found very salvage People, whose Heads appear'd through Bear-skins and Sea-Calves. By this time having <HI>Terreneuf</HI> on his Starboard, he return'd back to <HI>Diepe.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus far <HI>Verrazanus</HI> made some discovery of the Coast, which hath since not onely been▪ farther inspected by the <HI>English,</HI> but also by them Planted and call'd <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The setling of Plantations.</NOTE>This Countrey, whether first discover'd by the said <HI>Verrazanus,</HI> or together with the rest of largely-taken <HI>Virginia,</HI> by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> or, as some say, by Captain <HI>Gosnald,</HI> in the Year 1602. was so well known to the <HI>English</HI> in the be∣ginning of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign here, that the setling and carrying on of Plantations id this part of <HI>America,</HI> was vigorously promoted by many of the most eminent Per∣sons in <HI>England:</HI> whereupon it was about the Year 1606. being the fourth Year of the said King, granted by Patent to several Lords, Knights, Gentlemen and Mer∣chants, under the denomination of <HI>The Plymouth Company,</HI> both in favour of those generous Spirits, who studied and endeavor'd the good of the Publick by foreign Plantations, and indulgence to those, who not well satisfi'd with the Government of Church and State, and willingly transporting themselves and Families thither, as to their <HI>Asylum,</HI> could more conveniently be spar'd than the better affected part of the People: And although the Colonies at first sent over succeeded not accord∣ing to expectation, yet in a short time there Plantations were brought to very great perfection. Captain <HI>Weimouth,</HI> who had been employ'd there by the Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> of <HI>Warder,</HI> for the discovery of the North-West Passage, falling short of his Course, hapned into a River on the Coast of <HI>America,</HI> call'd <HI>Pemmaquid;</HI> from whence he brought five of the Natives for <HI>England,</HI> three of whose Names were <HI>Mannida▪ Skettwarroes,</HI> and <HI>Tasquantum,</HI> and Landing at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> presented them to Sir <HI>Ferdi∣nando Gorges,</HI> whom he made use of as Instruments for the farther advancement of these Plantations: they were all of one Nation, but of several parts, and several Families; he kept them with him three years, and observing in them an inclination to vertuous Designs, and Spirits above the Vulgar, he gain'd information from
<PB N="141" REF="86"/>them what great Rivers ran up into the Land, what Men of note were seated on them, what Power they were of, how Ally'd, what Enemies they had, and the like; and taking some light from thence, sent away a Ship, furnish'd with Men, and all kind of Necessaries convenient for the Service intended, under the Com∣mand of Captain <HI>Henry Chaloung,</HI> a Gentleman of a good Family, and very capable for Undertakings of this nature; and giving him sufficient Instructions what to do, sent along with him two of the said Natives for his better Conduct and Di∣rection, ordering him by all means to keep the Northerly Gage as high as <HI>Cape Briton,</HI> till they had discover'd the Main, and then to beat it up to the Southward as the Coast tended, till they found by the Natives they were near the place to which they were assign'd. By that time they were about a hundred Leagues off the Island of <HI>Canara,</HI> the Captain fell sick of a Feaver, and the Winds being Westerly, his Company shap'd their Course for the <HI>Indies,</HI> and coming to <HI>St. John de Porto Rico,</HI> the Captain went ashore for the recovery of his Health, whilst the Company took in Water, and such other Provisions as they had present need of, and spent some time in Hunting, and other Recreations; after which steering their intended Course, they were met with by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet that came from the <HI>Havana,</HI> taken Prisoners and carried into <HI>Spain,</HI> the Ship and Goods being confiscated, the Voyage overthrown, and the Natives lost.</P>
<P>Not long after the setting out of <HI>Chaloung, Thomas Haman</HI> was sent by Sir <HI>John Popham,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England,</HI> towards the River of <HI>Sagadehoc,</HI> to the suc∣cour of <HI>Chaloung,</HI> if need were; but not finding him, after he had scowr'd the Coast all about, he return'd back into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Prinne</HI> was likewise sent from <HI>Bristol,</HI> who arriving happily in those Parts, brought back with him at his return the most exact Discovery of that Coast that ever had been gain'd till then.</P>
<P>A while after, at the Charge of the said Sir <HI>John Popham,</HI> a hundred Men were sent to settle a Colony at <HI>Sagadehoc,</HI> under the Command of <HI>George Popham, Raleigh Gilbert,</HI> Master of the Ship, who seated themselves in a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> at the Mouth of this River; which attempting to discover, they met with a Wood near to an Island, distant from the Line about forty five Degrees, and some odd Seconds, where they easily went on Shore. In the Year 1608. the Commander of the Colony deceasing, and not long after him the Lord Chief Justice, who had been the chief that had furnish'd them with fresh Supplies, they return'd for <HI>England</HI> in those Ships that had been sent them with Succours: At which unexpected return, the Patrons of the Design were so offended, that for a certain time they desisted from their Enterprizes. In the mean while the <HI>French</HI> making use of this occasion, Planted Colo∣nies in divers places, when Sir <HI>Samuel Argal</HI> from <HI>Virginia</HI> disturb'd their Designs, and brought away Prisoners all he could lay hold on.</P>
<P>Suddenly after Captain <HI>Hobson</HI> and divers others were set out with very great Preparations, and with them two of the Natives which had been detain'd for some time in <HI>England,</HI> whom they thought to have made use of, the better to draw the rest of the Natives to their Commerce; but because a little before twenty four of them had been treacherously dealt with by one <HI>Hunt,</HI> they contracted from thence so great an animosity towards the <HI>English,</HI> that Captain <HI>Hobson</HI> was con∣strain'd to return without effecting any thing.</P>
<P>In the Year 1614. Captain <HI>John Smith</HI> being sent to Fish for Whales, and seek af∣ter Mines of Gold and Silver, Landed upon the Island of <HI>Monahiggan,</HI> where he found some store of Whales, but not such as those by whose Oyl they use to make so much profit.</P>
<PB N="142" REF="87"/>
<P>About the same time (two of the Natives being recover'd, <HI>Erpenow</HI> of <HI>Capawick,</HI> that had escap'd from Captain <HI>Hobson,</HI> and <HI>Assacumet</HI> of <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> one of those that had been taken Prisoners with <HI>Chaloung</HI>) Captain <HI>Harly,</HI> with Necessaries con∣venient for such a Voyage, was dispatch'd away by Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> favouring the Design, and furnishing him with some Land-Soldiers under the Command of Captain <HI>Hobson;</HI> who not discourag'd with his former ill Success, resolv'd upon a second Adventure.</P>
<P>In the Year 1615. Sir <HI>Richard Hakings</HI> undertook a Voyage into those Parts by authority of the Council of the second Colony, but by reason of the great Wars among the Natives, his Observations could not be such as might give any farther light than what had been already receiv'd.</P>
<P>Soon after which Captain <HI>Dormer</HI> coming for <HI>England</HI> from <HI>New-found-Land,</HI> and Landing at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> apply'd himself to the Governor, by whom he was dispatch'd away, with Direction to meet Captain <HI>Rocroft,</HI> sent away a little before; but <HI>Ro∣croft</HI> being dead by that time <HI>Dormer</HI> could come after him to <HI>Virginia,</HI> where he heard he was, he returning to <HI>Capawick,</HI> was there set upon by <HI>Erpenow,</HI> the fore∣mention'd Salvage, and other <HI>Indians</HI> that were Conspirators with him; and within a short while after at <HI>Virginia,</HI> whither he went to be cur'd of the Wounds he re∣ceiv'd in that Assassination, he fell sick and died.</P>
<P>About the Year 1623. Captain <HI>Robert Gorges,</HI> newly come out of the <HI>Venetian</HI> War, was employ'd by the Council of <HI>New Englands</HI> Affairs as the Lieutenant-General, to regulate the Abuses of divers Fisher-men and other Interlopers, who without License frequented those Coasts: for which Service he had assign'd to him all that part of the main Land situate upon the North-East side of the Bay of the <HI>Messachasets.</HI></P>
<P>By these several Colonies sent so thick one after another, both a full Discovery of the Countrey came to be made, and a large gap open'd to the free possession thereof; yet in regard of the many disappointments and misfortunes the several Companies sent over met with, and counting the vast Charges their setting forth cost the Undertakers, which would have been still increas'd by the need of conti∣nu'd Supplies, in all probability <HI>New England</HI> would have been but thinly peopled to this day, had not a great Tide of People, possess'd with an aversion to the Church-Government of <HI>England,</HI> and fled into <HI>Holland</HI> for <HI>Liberty of Conscience,</HI> ea∣gerly taken hold of this opportunity to make themselves Masters of their own Opinions, and of a Place where they might erect a Government suitable there∣unto: and though at first there were some Exceptions taken, as if this Countrey was to be made a Receptacle of Sectaries, and such as condemn'd the Ecclesiastical Government of the Nation, insomuch that Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges,</HI> to whom they ap∣ply'd themselves, desiring him to mediate for them to the Council of <HI>New Englands</HI> Affairs, when they perceiv'd the Authority they had from the <HI>Virginia</HI> Company, could not warrant their abode there, had enough to do (notwithstanding his Apology, <HI>That these things hapned contrary to his expectation</HI>) to wipe away the jea∣lousie which was entertain'd of him, it being Order'd, that no more should be suf∣fer'd to pass into <HI>New England,</HI> but such as should take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy: yet at last there was little notice taken who went, perhaps upon con∣sideration, that the vast resort of People thither would be of greater advantage to the Plantations, than their different Opinions, at so remote a distance, could be pre∣judicial, so long as they acknowledg'd Obedience to the King and Civil Power: However, Sir <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> to clear himself the better, mov'd those Lords that were the chief Actors in the Business, to resign their Grand Patent to the King, and pass
<PB N="143" REF="87"/>particular Patents to themselves of such part of the Countrey along the Sea-Coast, as might be sufficient for them: To this Motion there being a general Assent given by the Lords, and a Day appointed for the conclusion thereof, an Act was made for the Resignation of the Patent, alloting to each Man their several Bounds. From the uttermost parts began the Limits of the Lord <HI>Mougrave,</HI> and ended at <HI>Hudson</HI>'s <HI>River.</HI> To the Eastward of which River, for the space of sixty Miles in length, was plac'd the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s Assignment: Next to him was setled the Earl of <HI>Carlile:</HI> Next him the Lord <HI>Edward Gorges:</HI> Next the Marquess of <HI>Hamilton:</HI> Then Captain <HI>John Mason:</HI> And lastly his own, which extended to the great River <HI>Sagadehoc,</HI> being sixty Miles, and so up into the Main Land a hundred and twenty Miles, which he was pleas'd to call by the Name of <HI>The Province of Main.</HI></P>
<P>The Landing of the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Plymouth</HI> Plantation was very much facilitated by the great Mortality that hapned amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> about that time, amongst the <HI>Pecods, Narragansets, Nianticks, Tarantines, Wippanaps,</HI> and those of <HI>Abargini, Agissawang,</HI> and <HI>Pockanekie,</HI> their <HI>Powwows,</HI> or Doctors, seeing with amazement their <HI>Wigwams,</HI> or Streets, lie full of dead Bodies, and in vain expecting help from <HI>Squantam</HI> their good, or <HI>Abbamoch</HI> their bad God. Not long before, that blazing Comet, so much talk'd of in <HI>Europe,</HI> apppear'd after Sun-setting in their Horizon South-West for the space of thirty Sleeps, (for so they reckon their Days). They Landed at first with little or no resistance, a handful of Men onely being sent before to keep possession for their Companions, who arriv'd eight days after; when the Natives appearing with their Bowes and Arrows, let flie their long Shafts amongst them; whereupon one Captain <HI>Miles Standish</HI> with his Fowling-piece shot the stoutest <HI>Sachem</HI> amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> as he was reaching an Arrow from his Quiver; which the rest seeing, fled into the Woods and Thickets.</P>
<P>The same Year the <HI>Merchant-Advenurers</HI> in <HI>England</HI> sent forth store of Servants to provide against the Wants of that place; amongst whom came over a mix'd Mul∣titude, who setled themselves in the Bosom of the Cape now call'd <HI>Gloucester.</HI></P>
<P>About the Year 1651. there fled to the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Water-town</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> that dwelt thereabouts, for protection against the <HI>Tarratines,</HI> a sort of cruel and salvage Canni∣bals, by whom near the Town of <HI>Saugust,</HI> in the very dead time of the Night, one Lieutenant <HI>Walker</HI> being on a sudden alarm'd, was shot through his Coat and Buff Jacket with two Indian Arrows. That Night the <HI>English</HI> stood upon their Guard, and the next Morning sent word to other parts; who gather'd together, and taking counsel how to quit themselves of these <HI>Indians,</HI> agreed to discharge their great Guns; whose redoubled noise, ratling in the Rocks, struck terror into the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> and caus'd them to betake themselves to flight. The Autumn following, others of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who till then had held a good correspondence with the Planters, be∣gan to quarrel about the Bounds of their Land; but a great Mortality, by the ra∣ging of the Small-Pox, breaking out amongst them, put an end to that Contro∣versie: There died amongst the rest one of the chief of the <HI>Sagamores</HI> of the <HI>Matta∣chusets,</HI> call'd <HI>Sagamore John,</HI> who before his Death had been instructed in the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Faith, and took care that his two Sons should be nurtur'd therein.</P>
<P>In the Year 1635. there arrived several Ships with great plenty of Provisions, and many Persons of good Quality, and amongst the rest Sir <HI>Henry Vane.</HI></P>
<P>The same Year the People of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>New-town,</HI> hearing of a fertile place upon the River <HI>Canectico,</HI> remov'd thither, and erected anew Corporati∣on by the Name of <HI>Banectico,</HI> being encourag'd thereunto by the Lord <HI>Say</HI> and the Lord <HI>Brooks,</HI> and planting a Forrest at the mouth of the River, call'd it <HI>Saybrook Forrest.</HI></P>
<P>About the Year 1638. the <HI>Pequods,</HI> a stout and Warlike Nation, lying to the
<PB N="144" REF="88"/>South-West of the <HI>Mattachusets,</HI> were discover'd upon their March within some few Miles of <HI>Hartford:</HI> Their coming very much terrifi'd all that inhabited therea∣bouts; but they took onely three Women and return'd; one of whom making a violent resistance, had her Brains beaten out; the other two they carried away with them, without abusing their Persons, as it was suppos'd they would, for they esteem'd their own <HI>Shaws,</HI> being black, beyond our Women. Their chief Design was to learn to make Gunpowder; which seeing they could not effect, they look'd upon their Prize as nothing so precious as they imagin'd.</P>
<P>A little after another <HI>Indian</HI> War threatning the <HI>English,</HI> they resolv'd together to send an Ambassador to <HI>Cannonicus,</HI> chief <HI>Sachem</HI> of the <HI>Naragansits,</HI> endeavoring to prevent him from confederating with the <HI>Pequods,</HI> who (as they had Intelligence) were about sending to him to joyn with them: <HI>Cannonicus</HI> being grown old, had re∣sign'd the Government to his Nephew <HI>Mantinemo,</HI> a stern Man, and of a cruel Na∣ture. The Ambassadors arriving at his Court, which was about eighty Miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Prince assembled his chief Councellors, and having Entertain'd the Ambassadors Magnificently, and Feasted them Royally, gave them Audience in his State-house; where the <HI>Sachem,</HI> to manifest his greater State, lay along upon the Ground, with all his Nobility sitting about him, with their Legs doubled up, and their Knees touching their Chin: The <HI>English</HI> Interpreter having made his Speech in the Name of the rest, both <HI>Cannonicus</HI> and the young King gave discreet Answers, signifying their Resolutions to keep a fair Correspondence with the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> and yet not to fall out with the <HI>Pequods:</HI> Who a little after making also their Addresses to the same King, he disswaded them by many Reasons from making War with the <HI>English,</HI> and to deliver into their hands those Persons that had murther'd any of them. The <HI>Pequods</HI> nevertheless, though they seem'd inclinable to his Coun∣sel, yet they acted as Enemies; for when the <HI>English</HI> sent a Company of Soldiers into their Countrey to treat with them about delivering up the Murtherers, they made shew of willingness, but spying their advantage, betook themselves to their Heels; and whomsoever they took stragling by surprise, they revil'd and in∣sulted over in a most cruel manner, vilifying the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and uttering all the Blasphemies they could invent. Whereupon they rais'd fresh Souldiers for the War, to the number of four score, out of the several Towns in the <HI>Mattachusets,</HI> and with some <HI>Indian</HI> Guides came to their Fort, within which they had pitch'd their <HI>Wigwams,</HI> the Entrance being on two sides, with intricate Meanders to enter; at which were plac'd <HI>Indian</HI> Bowe-men, who shot the foremost of the <HI>English;</HI> yet they had little to boast of in the end, for the <HI>English</HI> rushing in through the winding Ways, and placing themselves round the <HI>Wigwams,</HI> made a very prosperous Shot, by directing the Muzzles of their Musquets against the <HI>Indians</HI> which lay sleeping on the Ground: In the midst of which rouzing terror and confusion they were defeated with little ado, most of them being either wounded, kill'd, or taken. The <HI>English</HI> thus animated with the first Victory, send their Prisoners to the Pinna∣ces, and prosecute the War in Hand, marching against the next Body of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which lay Encamp'd on a Hill about two Miles distant, where they gave them a second Overthrow, slaying many more than in the first Engagement; the rest flying to a very thick inaccessible Swamp or Bog, were there besieg'd by the <HI>English;</HI> and skulking up and down, as they saw their opportunity they would Shoot at them with their Arrows, and then suddenly fall flat along in the Water; at last the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> finding out a Passage into the Swamp, utterly defeated them, and put an end to the War with the loss of few Mens Lives, and not many wounded.</P>
<P>In the Year 1640. there came over a fresh Supply of People into <HI>New England,</HI> and
<PB N="145" REF="88"/>finding no place to settle in within any of the former erected Colonies, they re∣pair'd to a place call'd <HI>Long Island,</HI> sever'd from the Continent of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> about sixty Miles off the Sea.</P>
<P>The Year following the four Colonies, namely the <HI>Massachusets, Plymouth, Ca∣nectico,</HI> and <HI>New-Haven,</HI> taking into consideration the many Nations that were on all sides of them, as the <HI>French, Dutch, Jews,</HI> and native <HI>Indians;</HI> as also how the three first went to lay claim to Lands they never had any right to, and the last to be con∣tinually quarrelling and contending, where they saw any hopes of prevailing, by Commissioners chosen from the respective Colonies, concluded a firm Confede∣ration to assist each other in all just and lawful Wars; upon which there came in certain <HI>Indian Sachems,</HI> as <HI>Pomham, Miantonemo, Soccanocoh,</HI> and <HI>Uncas,</HI> who not onely submitted to the <HI>English</HI> Government, but also, if occasion were, in matters of Controversie submitted to their Arbitration: But the Contest between <HI>Mianto∣nemo</HI> and <HI>Uncas</HI> was too hot to be appeas'd, (though the <HI>English</HI> were not wanting to interpose) unless by the Blood of one of them, as will appear by the Consequence: <HI>Uncas</HI> was a Prince of <HI>For,</HI> whose Life <HI>Miantonemo,</HI> though a much more potent Prince, sought to take away by treachery, hiring a young Man of the <HI>Pequod</HI> Na∣tion to murther him, as the following Story renders suspected; for one dark Evening this <HI>Sachem</HI> passing from one <HI>Wigwam</HI> to another, was Shot through the Arm with an Arrow; but recovering the Palace, had the Arrow pull'd out, and his Arm cur'd: the young Man that was suspected being examin'd, how he came by that great store of <HI>Wampompeage</HI> which was found about him, and being able to give no good account, it increas'd the suspicion, and induc'd <HI>Uncas</HI> to complain to the <HI>English</HI> at a General Court held at <HI>Boston:</HI> Whereupon the young Man was Examin'd in the presence of <HI>Miantonemo,</HI> who came thither with his Attendants; but the young Man tutor'd, as suppos'd, by <HI>Miantonemo,</HI> pretended that <HI>Uncas</HI> had enjoyn'd him to feign that he was hir'd by <HI>Miantonemo</HI> to kill him: To which Tale of his little belief being given, it was concluded upon farther Examination of him in private that he had done the Fact: nevertheless they let him depart with <HI>Mianto∣nemo,</HI> advising him to send him home to <HI>Uncas;</HI> but he in stead of returning him cut off his Head, and forthwith gather'd an Army of a thousand Men to fight with <HI>Uncas;</HI> who met him with half the Men: the Battel being joyn'd, the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> though the far greater multitude, were beaten by the <HI>Wawhiggins,</HI> through the Va∣lour of <HI>Uncas</HI> their Prince; who perfected his Victory by possessing himself of the Person of <HI>Miantonemo,</HI> whom, having put his Life-guard to flight, he carried away with him in triumph to the Town of <HI>Hartford,</HI> desiring to have the advice of the United Colonies what to do with his Prisoner: Whereupon the Commissioners having had sufficient proof of <HI>Miantonemo</HI>'s treachery towards this Prince, advis'd <HI>Uncas</HI> to put him to death, but not to exercise that barbarous kind of cruelty which is usual amongst them in these Cases. The <HI>Sachem,</HI> upon this advice, not long after pretended to remove him to a safer place, but by the Way caus'd him to be Execu∣ted: His Subjects and Kindred were troubled at his Death, but the little Princes his Neighbors, over whom he had tyranniz'd, rather rejoyc'd.</P>
<P>In the Year 1645. the Sons of old <HI>Canonnicus,</HI> their Father being dead, began to fall into hot Contentions with their Neighbors, and being forbidden by the United Colonies, they did not stick to threaten Wars to the <HI>English</HI> also. Whereupon the Commissioners rais'd an Army of Horse and Foot, and made Major General <HI>Edward Gibbons</HI> Commander in Chief over them. But the <HI>Indians</HI> hearing of this Preparation, sent some of their chief Nobility to the Commissioners of the United Colonies, who were assembled at <HI>Boston,</HI> to Treat about Peace; to which the
<PB N="146" REF="89"/>Commissioners agreed, upon condition they should pay a part of the Charges of the War; and that they should send four of their Sons for Hostages till the Sum was paid; and the Hostages being sent back before the <HI>Wapom</HI> was all paid, the two Princes, <HI>Pesicus</HI> and <HI>Mexanimo,</HI> upon the sending a Company of Armed Men to de∣mand it, sent the remainder of the Money.</P>
<P>In the Year 1647. divers Persons of Quality ventur'd their Estates upon an Iron Mill, which they began at <HI>Braintree,</HI> but it profited the Owners little, rather wasting their Stock, the price of Labor in matters of that nature, being double or treble to what it is in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>These are the most material Transactions we find deliver'd by any one which hapned from the first discovery till the Year before mention'd: what hath hapned from that time to this, chiefly relates to the several Revolutions that have been in <HI>England,</HI> and shall be therefore taken notice of when we come to speak of the Go∣vernment of these Plantations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣modities of this Coun∣trey, together with the Trees and o∣ther sorts of Plants.</NOTE>Though there are, who having remain'd some time, and been concern'd in those Parts, affirm the Soil of <HI>New England</HI> to be nothing so fruitful as it is believ'd and commonly deliver'd to be, yet we think it not improper to give a brief account of the Trees and other Plants; also the Beasts, Birds, Fishes, and other Commodities which most Writers will have to be the production of this Countrey, especially since we find them compactly summ'd up by an unknown Writer in the Language of the <HI>Muses.</HI> The recital of the Plants and Trees, which (excepting the Cedar, <HI>Sassafras,</HI> and Dyers <HI>Sumach</HI>) are all of the same kind with those that grow in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> onely differing in nature, according as the Epithets of many of them declare, is as follows:</P>
<Q><L>Trees both in Hills and Plains in plenty be;</L>
<L>The long-liv'd Oak, and mournful Cypress Tree;</L>
<L>Skie-towring Pines, and Chesnuts coated rough;</L>
<L>The lasting Cedar, with the Walnut tough;</L>
<L>The Rozen-dropping Fir, for Mast in use;</L>
<L>The Boat-men seek for Oars light, neat grown Sprewse;</L>
<L>The brittle Ash, the ever-trembling Asps;</L>
<L>The broad-spread Elm, whose Concave harbors Wasps;</L>
<L>The Water-spungy Alder good for nought;</L>
<L>Small Eldern by the <HI>Indian</HI> Fletchers sought;</L>
<L>The knotty Maple, pallid Birch, Hawthorns;</L>
<L>The Horn-bound Tree, that to be cloven scorns;</L>
<L>Which from the tender Vine oft takes his Spouse,</L>
<L>Who twines embracing Arms about his Boughs.</L>
<L>Within this <HI>Indian</HI> Orchard Fruits be some;</L>
<L>The ruddy Cherry, and the jetty Plumb;</L>
<L>Snake-murthering Hazle, with sweet Saxafrage,</L>
<L>Whose Leaves in Beer allay hot Feavers rage;</L>
<L>The Dyers Shumach, with more Trees there be,</L>
<L>That are both good to use, and rare to see.</L></Q>
<P>The Beasts peculiar to this Countrey are the <HI>Moose,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> the <HI>Rackoon,</HI> and the <HI>Mus∣quash;</HI> the two first Land-Animals, the last Amphibious, which with others, com∣mon to them with us, are thus versifi'd by the abovesaid Author:</P>
<Q><L>The Kingly Lyon, and the strong-arm'd Bear;</L>
<L>The large limb'd Mooses, with the tripping Deer;</L>
<L>Quill-darting Porcupines, that Rackoons be</L>
<L>Castled ith' hollow of an aged Tree;</L>
<L>The skipping Squirrel, Rabbet, purblind Hare,</L>
<L>Immured in the self-same Castle are,</L>
<L>Lest red-ey'd Ferrets, wily Foxes should;</L>
<L>Them undermine, if Ramper'd but with Mold;</L>
<L>The grim-fac'd Ounce, and rav'nous howling Wolf,</L>
<L>Whose meagre Paunch sucks like a swallowing Gulph;</L>
<L>Black glittering Otters, and rich Coated Beaver;</L>
<L>The Civet-scented Musquash smelling ever.</L></Q>
<P>Of such of these as are altogether unknown to us, take these brief Descriptions.</P>
<P>The Beast call'd a <HI>Moose,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Moose.</HI></NOTE> is not much unlike red Deer, and is as big as an Ox, slow of Foot, Headed like a Buck, with a broad Beam, some being two Yards
<PB N="147" REF="89"/>wide in the Head, their flesh is as good as Beef, their Hides good for Clothing; if these were kept tame, and accustom'd to the Yoke, they would be a great Com∣modity: First, because they are so fruitful, bringing forth three at a time, being likewise very uberous: Secondly, because they will live in Winter without any Fodder. There are not many of these in the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bay, but forty Miles to the North-East there are great store of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rackoone</HI> is a deep Furr'd Beast, not much unlike a Badger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Rackoon.</HI></NOTE> having a Tail like a Fox, as good Meat as a Lamb: These Beasts in the day time sleep in hollow Trees, in a Moon-shine night they go to feed on Clams at a low Tide, by the Sea side, where the <HI>English</HI> hunt them with their Dogs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Musquash</HI> is much like a Beaver for shape, but nothing near so big;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mas∣quash.</HI></NOTE> the Male hath two Stones, which smell as sweet as Musk, and being kill'd in Winter, never lose their sweet smell: These Skins are no bigger than a Coney-skin, yet are sold for five Shillings apiece, being sent for Tokens into <HI>England;</HI> one good Skin will perfume a whole house full of Clothes, if it be right and good.</P>
<P>The Birds both common and peculiar are thus recited.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE></P>
<Q><L>The Princely Eagle, and the soaring Hawk,</L>
<L>Whom in their unknown ways there's none can chawk:</L>
<L>The Humbird for some Queens rich Cage more fit,</L>
<L>Than in the vacant Wilderness to sit.</L>
<L>The swift-wing'd Swallow sweeping to and fro,</L>
<L>As swift as Arrow from <HI>Tartarian</HI> Bowe.</L>
<L>When as <HI>Aurora's</HI> Infant day new springs,</L>
<L>There th'morning mounting Lark her sweet lays sings:</L>
<L>The harmonious Thrush, swift Pigeon, Turtle-dove,</L>
<L>Who to her Mate doth ever constant prove:</L>
<L>The <HI>Turky</HI>-Pheasant, Heath-cock, Partridge rare,</L>
<L>The Carrion-tearing Crow, and hurtful Stare,</L>
<L>The long-liv'd Raven, th'ominous Screech-Owl,</L>
<L>Who tells, as old Wives say, disasters foul.</L>
<L>The drowsie Madge that leaves her day-lov'd Nest,</L>
<L>And loves to rove, when Day-birds be at rest:</L>
<L>Th'Eel-murthering Hearn, and greedy Cormorant,</L>
<L>That near the Creeks in morish Marshes haunt.</L>
<L>The bellowing Bittern, with the long-leg'd Crane,</L>
<L>Presaging Winters hard, and dearth of Grain.</L>
<L>The Silver Swan that tunes her mournful breath,</L>
<L>To sing the Dirge of her approaching death.</L>
<L>The tattering Oldwives, and the cackling Geese,</L>
<L>The fearful Gull that shuns the murthering Peece.</L>
<L>The strong-wing'd Mallard, with the nimble Teal,</L>
<L>And ill-shape't Loon, who his harsh Notes doth squeal.</L>
<L>There Widgins, Sheldrakes and Humilitees,</L>
<L>Snites, Doppers, Sea-Larks, in whole million flees.</L></Q>
<P>Of these the <HI>Humbird, Loon,</HI> and <HI>Humility</HI> are not to be pass'd by without parti∣cular observation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Humbird</HI> is one of the wonders of the Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hum∣bird.</HI></NOTE> being no bigger than a Hornet, yet hath all the Dimensions of a Bird, as Bill, and Wings with Quills, Spi∣der-like Legs, small Claws: for Colour, she is as glorious as the Rain-bow; as she flies, she makes a little humming noise like a Humble-bee, wherefore she is call'd the <HI>Humbird.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Loon</HI> is an ill-shap'd thing like a Cormorant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Loon. <HI>The</HI> Hunti∣lity, <HI>or</HI> Sim∣plicity.</NOTE> but that he can neither go nor flie; he maketh a noise sometimes like Sowgelders Horn. The <HI>Humilities</HI> or <HI>Sim∣plicities</HI> (as we may rather call them) are of two sorts, the biggest being as large as a green Plover; the other as big as Birds we call <HI>Knots</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> Such is the sim∣plicity of the smaller sorts of these Birds, that one may drive them on a heap like so many Sheep, and seeing a fit time shoot them; the living seeing the dead, settle themselves on the same place again, amongst which the Fowler discharges again: These Birds are to be had upon Sandy Brakes, at the latter end of Summer before the Geese come in.</P>
<P>No less Poetical a Bill of Fare is brought of the Fish on the Sea-Coasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishes.</NOTE> and in the Rivers of <HI>New England</HI> in these subsequent Verses.</P>

<L>To dive for Cocles, and to dig for Clams,</L>
<L>Whereby her lazie Husbands guts she crams.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>To speak of the most unusual of these sorts of Fish;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Seal.</HI></NOTE> First the <HI>Seal,</HI> which is call'd the <HI>Sea-Calf,</HI> his Skin is good for divers uses, his Body being between Flesh and Fish, it is not very delectable to the Palate, or congruent with the Stomack; his Oil is very good to burn in Lamps, of which he affords a great deal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Shark</HI> is a kind of Fish as big as a Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Shark.</HI></NOTE> some as big as a Horse, with three rows of Teeth within his Mouth, with which he snaps asunder the Fishermans Lines, if he be not very circumspect: This Fish will leap at a Mans hand if it be over board, and with his Teeth snap off a Mans Leg or Hand if he be Swimming; these are often taken, being good for nothing but Manuring of Land.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollibut</HI> is not much unlike a Pleace or Turbut,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hollibut.</HI></NOTE> some being two yards long, and one wide, a Foot thick; the plenty of better Fish makes these of little esteem, except the Head and Finns, which Stew'd or Bak'd is very good; these <HI>Hollibuts</HI> be little set by while <HI>Basse</HI> is in season.</P>
<P>The <HI>Basse</HI> is one of the best Fishes in the Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Basse.</NOTE> and though Men are soon weary'd with other Fish, yet are they never with <HI>Basse;</HI> it is a delicate, fine, fat, fast Fish, having a Bone in his Head which contains a Sawcerful of Marrow, sweet and good, pleasant to the Palate, and wholsom to the Stomack: When there be great store of them, we only eat the Heads, and Salt up the Bodies for Winter, which exceeds Ling or Haberdine: Of these Fishes some are three, and some four Foot long, some bigger, some lesser; at some Tides a Man may catch a dozen or twenty of these in three hours; the way to catch them is with Hook and Line: The Fisherman taking a great Cod-line, to which he fasteneth a piece of Lobster, throws it into the Sea, the Fish biting at it, he pulls her to him, and knocks her on the head with a Stick.</P>
<P><HI>Alewives</HI> are a kind of Fish which is much like a Herring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alewives.</NOTE> which in the later end of <HI>April</HI> come up to the fresh Rivers to Spawn, in such multitudes as is almost in∣credible, pressing up in such shallow Waters as will scarce permit them to Swim, having likewise such longing desire after the fresh Water Ponds, that no beatings with Poles, or forcive agitations by other devices, will cause them to return to the Sea, till they have cast their Spawn.</P>
<P><HI>Clamms</HI> or <HI>Clamps,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Clamms <HI>or</HI> Clamps.</NOTE> are a Shell-fish not much unlike a Cockle, they lie under the Sand, and have every one of them a round hole to take Air, and receive Wa∣ter at. When the Tide ebbs and flows, a Man running over these <HI>Clamm</HI> banks will presently be made all wet, by their spouting of Water out of those small holes: These Fishes are in great plenty in most places of the Countrey, which is a great Commodity for the feeding of Swine, both in Winter and Summer; for being
<PB N="149" REF="90"/>once us'd to those places, they will repair to them as duly every Ebb, as if they were driven to them by Keepers: In some places of the Countrey there be <HI>Clamms</HI> as big as a Peny white Loaf, which are great Dainties amongst the Natives, and would be in great esteem amongst the <HI>English,</HI> were it not for better Fish.</P>
<P>Other Commodities which this Countrey is said to yield, are, in down-right Prose, Furrs, Flax, Linnen, Iron, Pitch, Masts, Cables, and some quantity of Am∣ber; so that if what many Authors have consented to assert concerning <HI>New Eng∣land</HI> be not a meer Fiction, what e're hath been affirm'd of the unfruitfulness of the Country will demonstrably be found invalid.</P>
<P>There are also to be found here some hurtful Creatures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Noxious Creatures.</NOTE> of which, that which is most injurious to the Person and Life of a Man is the <HI>Rattle-Snake,</HI> which is generally a yard and a half long, as thick in the middle as the small of a Mans Leg; she hath a yellow Belly, her Back being spotted with black, russet, yellow, and green colours, plac'd like Scales; at her Tail is a Rattle, with which she makes a noise when she is molested, or when she seeth any approach near her; her Neck seems to be no thicker than a Mans Thumb, yet she can swallow a Squirril, having a great wide Mouth, with Teeth as sharp as Needles, wherewith she biteth such as tread upon her, her Poyson lyeth in her Teeth, for she hath no Sting. When any Man is bitten by any of these Creatures, the Poyson spreads so suddenly through the Veins, and so runs to the Heart, that in one hour it causeth Death, unless he hath the Antidote to expel the Poyson, which is a Root call'd <HI>Snake-weed,</HI> which must be champ'd, the Spittle swallow'd, and the Root apply'd to the Sore; this is present Cure against that which would be present death with∣out it: This Weed is rank Poyson, if it be taken by any man that is not bitten; whosoever is bitten by these Snakes, his flesh becomes as spotted as a Leopard, un∣til he be perfectly cur'd. It is reported, that if the Party live that is bitten, the Snake will die, and if the Party die, the Snake will live. This is a most Poysonous and dangerous Animal, yet nothing so bad as the report goes of it in <HI>England;</HI> for whereas it is said to kill a Man with its breath, and that it can flie, there is no such matter, for it is naturally the most sleepy and unnimble Creature that lives, never offering to leap or bite any Man, if it be not trodden on first; and it is their desire in hot weather to lie in Paths, where the Sun may shine on them, where they will sleep so soundly, that I have known four Men stride over one of them, and never awake it; five or six Men have been bitten by them, which by using of <HI>Snake-weed</HI> were all cur'd, never any yet losing his life by them. Cows have been bitten, but being cut in divers places, and this Weed thrust into their flesh, were cur'd; A small Switch will easily kill one of these Snakes. In many places of the Country there be none of them, as at <HI>Plymouth, New-town, Igowamme, Nahant, &amp;c.</HI> In some places they will live on one side of the River, and swimming but over the Water, as soon as they are come into the Woods, they turn up their yellow Bellies and die. Up into the Countrey, Westward from the Plantations, is a high Hill, which is call'd <HI>Rattle-Snake-Hill,</HI> where there are great store of these Poysonous Creatures.</P>
<P>There are likewise troublesome Flies.</P>
<P>First there is a wild Bee or Wasp, which commonly guards the Grape, building by Cobweb habitation amongst the Leaves: Secondly a great green Flie, not much unlike our Horse-Flies in <HI>England;</HI> they will nipp so sore, that they will fetch Blood either of Man or Beast, and are most troublesome where most Cattel are, which brings them from out of the Woods to the Houses; this Flie continues but for the Moneth of <HI>June.</HI> The third is <HI>Gurnipper,</HI> which is a small black Flie, no bigger than a Flea; her biting causeth an itching upon the Hands or Face, which
<PB N="150" REF="91"/>provoketh scratching, which is troublesome to some; this Flie is busie but in close Mornings or Evenings, and continues not above three Weeks; the least Wind or heat expels them. The fourth is a <HI>Musketor,</HI> which is not unlike to our Gnats in <HI>England;</HI> in places where there is no thick Woods or <HI>Swamps,</HI> there are none or ve∣ry few. In the new Plantations they are troublesome for the first year, but the Wood decaying they vanish: These Flies cannot endure Wind; heat or cold, so that these are only troublesome in close thick Weather, and against Rain, many that are bitten will fall a scratching, whereupon their Faces and Hands swell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the ancient Inhabitants.</NOTE>As touching the Nature of the ancient Inhabitants, they are to be consider'd ac∣cording to their several Shires or Divisions; those that inhabit to the East and North-East bore the name of <HI>Churchers</HI> and <HI>Tarrenteens;</HI> these in the Southern parts were call'd <HI>Pequods,</HI> and <HI>Narragansets;</HI> those Westward, <HI>Connectacuts</HI> and <HI>Mowhacks;</HI> to the North-West, of whom were the <HI>Aberginians.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the <HI>Mow∣hacks.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Mowhacks</HI> were ever accounted a cruel bloudy People, which were wont to come down upon their poor Neighbors, with more than bruitish Savageness, spoil∣ing their Corn, burning their Houses, slaying Men, ravishing Women, yea very <HI>Canibals</HI> they were, sometimes eating on a Man one part after another before his Face, and while yet living; insomuch, that the very Name of a <HI>Mowhack</HI> would strike the Heart of a poor <HI>Aberginian</HI> dead, till they had the <HI>English</HI> on their sides to succor them; for these inhumane Homicides confess that they dare not meddle with a white Fac'd Man, accompany'd with his hot-mouth'd Weapon.</P>
<P>These <HI>Indians</HI> are a People of tall Stature, long grim Visages, slender Wasted, and having exceeding great Arms and Thighs, wherein they say their strength lieth; which is such, that one of them hath been known to kill a Dog with a fil∣lip of his Finger, and afterwards to have flead and sod him, and eat him to his Din∣ner. They are so hardy, that they can eat such things as would make other <HI>Indians</HI> sick to look upon; being destitute of Fish and Flesh, they suffice Hunger and main∣tain Nature with the use of Vegetatives; but that which they most hunt after, is the flesh of Man: Their custom is, if they get a stranger near their Habitations, not to Butcher him immediately, but keep him in as good plight as they can, feeding him with the best Victuals they have.</P>
<P>These <HI>Indians</HI> are more desperate in Wars than the other <HI>Indians,</HI> which proceeds not only from the fierceness of their Natures, but also in that they know themselves to be better Arm'd and Weapon'd; all of them wearing Sea Horse Skins and Barks of Trees, made by their Art as impenetrable, it is thought, as Steel, wearing Head-Pieces of the same, under which they March securely and undantedly, running, and fiercely crying out, <HI>Hadree Hadree succomee succomee, We come we come to suck your Blood,</HI> not fearing the feather'd shafts of the strong-arm'd Bow-men, but like unruly headstrong Stallions, beat them down with their right-hand <HI>Tamahawks,</HI> and left-hand Javelins, being all the Weapons which they use, counting Bowes a cowardly fight. <HI>Tamahawks</HI> are Staves of two Foot and a half long, with knobs at one end as round and big as a Foot-ball; a Javelin is a short Spear, headed with sharp Sea-Horse Teeth; one blow or thrust with these sharp Weapons, will not need a second to hasten death from a <HI>Mowhacks</HI> arm.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the <HI>Pequods</HI> and <HI>Narra∣gansets.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Pequants</HI> are a stately Warlike People, just and equal in their dealings; not treacherous either to their Country-men, or <HI>English,</HI> to whom (except in time of War) they were not any ways uncivil. Their next Neighbors the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> are the most numerous People in those Parts, the most rich also, and the most industri∣ous; being the Store-house of all such kind of wild Merchandize as is amongst them. These Men are the most curious Minters of their <HI>Wampompeage</HI> and <HI>Mow∣hakes,</HI> which they form out of the inmost Wreaths of Periwinkle-shells. The Nor∣thern, Eastern, and Western <HI>Indians</HI> fetch all their Coyn from these Southern Mint-Masters. From hence they have most of their curious Pendants and Bracelets, from hence they have their great Stone Pipes, which will hold a quarter of an Ounce of Tobacco, which they make with Steel Drills and other Instruments; such is their Ingenuity and dexterity, that they can imitate the <HI>English</HI> Mold so accurately, that were it not for matter and colour, it were hard to distinguish them; they make them of green, and sometimes of black Stone; they are much desir'd of our <HI>English</HI> Tobacconists, for their rarity, strength, handsomness, and coolness. Hence likewise our <HI>Indians</HI> had their Pots, wherein they us'd to seeth their Victuals before they knew the use of Brass. Since the <HI>English</HI> came, they have employ'd most of their time in catching of Beavers, Otters, and <HI>Musquashes,</HI> which they bring down into the Bay, returning back loaden with <HI>English</HI> Commodities, of which they make double profit, by selling them to more remote <HI>Indians,</HI> who are ignorant at what cheap rates they obtain them, in comparison of what they make them pay, so making their Neighbors ignorance their enrichment: They were never known to be desirous to take in hand any Martial Enterprize, or expose themselves to the uncertain events of War; wherefore the <HI>Pequants</HI> call them <HI>Women-like Men,</HI> resting secure under the conceit of their popularity, and seeking rather to grow rich by in∣dustry, than famous by deeds of Chivalry.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature and complexi∣on of the <HI>A∣berginians.</HI></NOTE>Most of these Northward <HI>Indians</HI> are between five and six Foot high, straight Bo∣dy'd, strongly compos'd, smooth Skin'd, merry Countenanc'd, of Complexion more swarthy than the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> black Hair'd, high Foreheaded, black Ey'd, out-Nos'd, broad Shoulder'd, brawny Arm'd, long and slender Handed, out Breasted, small Wasted, lank Belly'd, well Thigh'd, flat Kneed, with handsome grown Legs, and small Feet: In a word, take them when the Blood skips in their Veins, when the Flesh is on their Backs, and Marrow in their Bones, when they frolick in their an∣tique Deportments and <HI>Indian</HI> Postures, they are more amiable to behold (though onely in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Livery) than many a trim Gallant in the newest Mode; and though their Houses are but mean, their Lodging as homely, Commons scant, their Drink Water, and Nature their best Clothing, yet they still are healthful and lusty. Their smooth Skins proceed from the often anointing of their Bodies with the Oyl of Fishes, and the fat of Eagles, with the grease of <HI>Rackoons,</HI> which they hold in Summer the best Antidote to keep their Skin from blistering with the scorching Sun; it is their best Armor against the <HI>Musketoes,</HI> and the surest abrasour of the hairy Excrement, and stops the Pores of their Bodies against the nipping Winters cold. Their black Hair is natural, yet is brought to a more Jetty colour by Oyl∣ing, Dying, and daily dressing; sometimes they wear it very long, hanging down in a loose dishevel'd Womanish manner, otherwise ty'd up hard and short like a Horse Tail, bound close with a Fillet, which they say makes it grow the faster; they are not a little Phantastical in this particular; their Boys being not permit∣ted to wear their Hair long till sixteen years of Age, and then they must come to it by degrees; some being cut with a long foretop, a long lock on the Crown, one of each side of his Head, the rest of his Hair being cut even with the Scalp; the
<PB N="152" REF="92"/>young Men and Soldiers wear their Hair long on the one side, the other being cut short like a Screw; other cuts they have as their Fancy leads them, which would torture the Wits of the most exact Barber to imitate. But though they are thus proud of the Hair of their Head, you cannot wooe them to wear it on their Chins, where it no sooner grows, but it is stubb'd up by the roots, for they count it as an unuseful, cumbersome, and opprobrious excrement, insomuch as they call him an <HI>English</HI> Mans Bastard that hath but the appearance of a Beard.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Appa∣rel, Oma∣ments, Paint∣ings, and other artificial Deckings of the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE>The Cloathing of the <HI>Indians</HI> is only a pair of <HI>Indian</HI> Breeches to cover their se∣cret Parts, which is but a piece of Cloth a yard and a half long, but between their Groins, ty'd with a Snakes Skin about their middles, one end hanging down with a flap before, the other like a tail behind. In the Winter time, the more Aged of them wear Leather Drawers, in form like <HI>Irish</HI> Trouses, fasten'd under their Girdle with Buttons: They wear Shooes likewise of their own making, cut out of a <HI>Mooses</HI> Hide; many of them wear Skins about them, in form of an <HI>Irish</HI> Mantle, and of these some are Bears Skins, <HI>Mooses</HI> Skins, and Beaver Skins sew'd together, others Ot∣ter Skins, and <HI>Rackoon</HI> Skins; most of them in the Winter having his deep Furr'd Cat Skin, like a large Muff, which he shifts to that Arm which lieth most expos'd to the Wind. Although they are poor, yet is there in them the sparks of natural Pride, which appears in their longing desire after many kind of Ornaments, wear∣ing Pendants in their Ears, in form of Birds, Beasts, and Fishes, Carv'd out of Bone, Shells, and Stone, with long Bracelets of their curious wrought <HI>Wampompeage</HI> and <HI>Mowhackees,</HI> which they put about their Necks and Loins; these they count a rare kind of Decking; many of the better sort bearing upon their Cheeks certain Pourtraitures of Beasts, as Bears, Deers, <HI>Mooses,</HI> Wolves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> some of Fowls, as of Eagles, Hawks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is not a superficial Painting, but a certain Incision, or else a raising of their Skin by a small sharp Instrument, under which they convey a certain kind of black unchangeable Ink, which makes the desir'd form apparent and permanent.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Diet, Cookery, Meal-times, and Hospi∣tality at their Kettles.</NOTE>In Winter time they have all manner of Fowls and Beasts of the Land and Wa∣ter, Pond-fish, with <HI>Cathaires</HI> and other Roots, <HI>Indian</HI> Beans and <HI>Clamms;</HI> in the Sum∣mer they have all manner of Sea-fish, with all sorts of Berries. For the ordering of their Victuals, they Boil or Roast them, having large Kettles which they Traded for with the <HI>French</HI> long since, and do still buy of the <HI>English</HI> as their need requires, before they had substantial Earthen Pots of their own making. Their Spits are no other than cloven Sticks, sharpen'd at one end to thrust into the ground; into these cloven Sticks they thrust the Flesh or Fish they would have Roasted, behem∣ming a round fire with a dozen of Spits at a time, turning them as they see occasi∣on. They seldom or never make Bread of their <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, but seethe it whole like Beans, eating three or four Corns with a mouthful of Fish or Flesh, some∣times eating Meat first, and Corns after, filling the Chinks with their Broth. In Sum∣mer, when their Corn is spent, <HI>Sqoutersquashes</HI> is their best Bread, a Fruit like a young Pumpion: But as all are fellows at Foot-ball, so they all meet Friends at the Ket∣tle,
<PB N="153" REF="92"/>saving their Wives, that Dance a Spaniel-like attendance at their Backs for their Fragments. If their occasions cause them to Travel, the best of their Victuals for their Journey is <HI>Nocake,</HI> (as they call it) which is nothing but <HI>Indian</HI> Corn parch'd in the hot Ashes; the Ashes being sifted from it, it is afterwards beaten to Powder, and put into a long Leathern Bag, truss'd at their Back like a Knapsack, out of which they take thrice three Spoonfuls a day, dividing it into three Meals. If it be Winter, and Snow be on the ground, they can eat when they please, making use of Snow for their Drink; in Summer, they must stay till they meet with a Spring or Brook; with this strange <HI>viaticum</HI> they will travel four or five days to∣gether. They keep no Set-Meals, their Store being spent, they champ on the Bit, till they meet with fresh Supplies, either from their own endeavors, or their Wives industry, who trudge to the <HI>Clam-banks</HI> when all other means fail. Though they are sometimes scanted, yet are they as free as Emperors, both to their Countrey∣men and <HI>English,</HI> be he stranger, or near acquaintance; counting it a great discour∣tesie, not to eat of their high-conceited Delicates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their hardiness.</NOTE>Their hardiness is much to be admir'd, no ordinary pains making them so much as alter their countenance; beat them, whip them, punch them, if they put on a resolution, they will not winch for it; whether it be their benumm'd insensible∣ness of smart, or their hardy resolutions, is hard to resolve; It might be a <HI>Perillus</HI> his Bull, or the Rack might force an out-cry from them, but a <HI>Turkish</HI> drubbing would not move them, the unexpected approach of a mortal Wound by a Bul∣let, Arrow, or Sword, striking no more terror, nor causing no more exclamation in them, than if it had been a shot into the body of a Tree; such Wounds as would be sudden death to an <HI>English</HI> Man, would be nothing to them; whether it be, that by their rare skill in the use of Vegetatives, or by Diabolical Charms, they cure them; nevertheless, the very name and thoughts of death is so hideous to them, or any thing that presents it so terrible, that a hundred of them will run from two or three arm'd with Guns. In the Night they need not to be feared, for they will not budge from their own Dwellings, for fear of their <HI>Abamacho</HI> (the Devil) whom they much fear, specially in evil enterprizes, they will rather lie by an <HI>English</HI> fire than go a quarter of a Mile in the dark to their own Dwellings; but they are well freed from this Scare-crow since the coming of the <HI>English,</HI> and less care for his de∣lusions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Kings, Go∣vernment, and Subjects obedience.</NOTE>Now for the matter of Government amongst them; it is the custom of their Kings to inherit, the Son always taking the Kingdom after his Fathers death. If there be no Son, then the Queen rules; if no Queen, the next to the Blood-Royal; who comes in otherwise, is but counted an usurping Intruder, if his fair carriage bear him not out the better, they will soon Unscepter him. Some say the chief <HI>Powahe</HI> is next in Dignity and Authority to the King, and when he dies, Marries the <HI>Squasachem,</HI> or Queen.</P>
<P>The Kings have no Laws to Command by, nor have they any annual Revenues; yet commonly are they so either fear'd or belov'd, that half their Subjects estate is at their Service, and their Persons at his Command, by which Command he is better known than by any thing else; for though he hath no Kingly Robes to make him glorious in the view of his Subjects, nor daily Guards to succor his Person, nor Court-like attendance, nor sumptuous Palaces; yet do they yield all submissive subjection to him, accounting him their Soveraign; going at his Command, and coming at his Beck, not so much as expostulating the cause, though it be in mat∣ters thwarting their wills; he being accounted a disloyal Subject that will not ef∣fect what his Prince Commands. Whosoever is known to Plot Treason, or to lay
<PB N="154" REF="93"/>violent hands on his lawful King, is presently Executed. Once a Year he takes his Progress, accompanied with a dozen of his best Subjects, to view his Countrey, to recreate himself, and establish good Orders. When he enters into any of their Houses, without any more Complement, he is desir'd to sit down on the Ground, (for they use neither Stools nor Cushions) and after a little respite all that are pre∣sent come in, and sit down by him, one of his Seniors pronouncing an Oration gratulatory to his Majesty for love, and the many good things they enjoy under his peaceful Government. A King of large Dominions hath his Vice-Roys, or in∣ferior Kings under him, to agitate his State Affairs, and keep his Subjects in good Decorum. Other Officers there are, but how to distinguish them by Name is some∣thing difficult. For their Laws, as their Vices come short of many other Nations, so they have not so many Laws, though they are not without some, which they in∣flict upon notorious Malefactors, as Traitors to their Prince, inhumane Murthe∣rers, and, some say, Adulterers: for Theft, as they have nothing to steal worth the Life of a Man, therefore they have no Law to Execute for Trivials, a Subject being more precious in the Eye of his Prince, than, where Men are so scarce, to be cast away upon so sleight a matter. A Malefactor having deserv'd Death, and being apprehended, is brought before the King, and some other of the wisest Men, where they enquire out the original of the thing, after proceeding by aggravation of Cir∣cumstances he is found Guilty, and Cast by the Jury of their strict Inquisition, he is Condemn'd and Executed in the following manner: The Executioner comes in, who blind-folds the Party, sets him in the publick view, and Brains him with a <HI>Tamahauke,</HI> or Club; which done, his Friends bury him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Mar∣riages.</NOTE>Now to speak something of their Marriages, the Kings and the <HI>Powwows,</HI> or great Doctors, may have two or three Wives, but seldom use it, Men of ordinary Rank having but one; which dilproves the report, that they had eight or ten Wives apiece. When a Man hath a desire to Marry, he first gets the good will of the Maid or Widow, after, the consent of her Friends for her part; and for himself, if he be at his own disposing, and if the King will, the Match is made, her Dowry of <HI>Wampompeage</HI> paid, the <HI>Sagamore</HI> or King (who for every Marriage hath a Fathom of <HI>Wampompeage,</HI> which is about the value of seven or eight shillings) joyns their Hands, never to part till Death, unless she prove a Whore, for which they may put away their Wives.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Worship, In∣vocations, and Conjurati∣ons.</NOTE>As it is natural to all Mortals to worship something, so do these People, but ex∣actly to describe to whom their Worship is chiefly bent, is very difficult: They acknowledge especially two, <HI>Ketan,</HI> some say <HI>Tantum,</HI> their good God, and <HI>Hoba∣mocco,</HI> some say <HI>Squantum,</HI> their evil God; to <HI>Ketan</HI> they Sacrifice (as the ancient <HI>Heathens</HI> did to <HI>Ceres</HI>) after their Garners be full with a good Crop. They like∣wise Invocate this God for fair Weather, for Rain in time of Drought, and for the recovery of their Sick; but if they do not hear them, then they verrifie the old Verse, <HI>Flectere si nequeo Superos Acheronta movebo,</HI> their <HI>Powwows</HI> betaking themselves to their Exorcismes and Necromantick Charms, by which they bring to pass strange things, if we may believe the <HI>Indians,</HI> who report of one <HI>Pissacannaw,</HI> that he could make the Water burn, the Rocks move, the Trees dance, and metamorphose himself into a flaming Man. In Winter, when there is no green Leaves to be got, he would out of the Ashes of an old Leaf, calcin'd and put into the Water, pro∣duce a new green Leaf: And of a dead Snakes Skin, a living Snake, both to be seen, felt and heard. The manner of their action in their Conjuration is thus: The Parties that are sick or lame being brought before them, the <HI>Powwow</HI> sitting down, the rest of the <HI>Indians</HI> giving attentive audience to his Imprecations and In∣vocations,
<PB N="155" REF="93"/>and after the violent expression of many a hideous bellowing and groan∣ing he makes a stop, and then all the Auditors with one voice utter a short <HI>Canto;</HI> which done, the <HI>Powwow</HI> still proceeds in his Invocations, sometimes roaring like a Bear, other times groaning like a dying Horse, foaming at the Mouth like a cha∣sed Boar, smiting on his naked Brest and Thighs with such violence, as if he were mad: Thus will he continue sometimes half a day, spending his Lungs, sweating out his Fat, and tormenting his Body in this diabolical Worship. Sometimes the Devil, for requital of their Worship, recovers the Party, to nuzzle them up in their devillish Religion. But since the <HI>English</HI> (upon whom, and in whose presence it is said the <HI>Powwows</HI> could never work their Witchcrafts) frequented those Parts, they daily fall from his Colours, relinquishing their former Fopperies, and ac∣knowledge the Power of the <HI>English</HI>-man's God, as they call him. And it is reported of them, that at the very first they were so tractable to the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, that they would say King <HI>James</HI> was good, and his God good, but their <HI>Tanto</HI> nought, though of their two Gods he was accounted the good one.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Wars.</NOTE>They use no other Weapons in War than Bowes and Arrows, saving that their Captains have long Spears, on which, if they return Conquerors, they carry the Heads of their chief Enemies that they slay in the Wars, it being the Custom to cut off their Heads, Hands and Feet, to bear home to their Wives and Children, as true tokens of their renowned Victory. When they go to their Wars, it is their Custom to paint their Faces with diversity of Colours, some being all black as Jet, some red, some half red and half black, some black and white, others spotted with divers kinds of Colours, being all disguis'd to their Enemies, to make them more terrible to their Foes, putting on likewise their rich Jewels, Pendents, and <HI>Wampom∣peage,</HI> to put them in mind that they Fight not onely for their Children, Wives and Lives, but likewise for their Goods, Lands and Liberties. Being thus Arm'd with this Warlike Paint, the antique Warriors make towards their Enemies in a disor∣der'd manner, without any Soldier-like Marching, or Warlike Postures, being deaf to any word of Command, ignorant of falling off or on, of doubling Ranks or Files, but let flie their winged Shaftsmen without either fear or wit: Their Artil∣lery being spent, he that hath no Arms to Fight, finds Legs to run away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Games and Sports of activity.</NOTE>They have two sorts of Games, one call'd <HI>Puim,</HI> the other <HI>Hubbub,</HI> not much un∣like Cards and Dice, being no other than Lottery. <HI>Puim</HI> is fifty or sixty small Bents of a Foot long, which they divide to the number of their Gamesters, shuffling them first between the Palms of their Hands; be that hath more than his Fellow, is so much the forwarder in his Game: Many other Whimsies be in this Game, which would be too long to commit to Paper. He that is a noted Gamester hath a Hole in his Ear, wherein he carries his <HI>Puims</HI> in defiance of his Antagonists. <HI>Hubbub</HI> is five small Bones in a small smooth Tray; the Bones be like a Die, but something flatter, black on the one side and white on the other, which they place on the Ground, against which violently thumping the Platter, the Bones mount, changing colours with the windy whisking of their Hands to and fro; which action in that sport they much use, smiting themselves on the Beast and Thighs, crying out <HI>Hub, Hub, Hub;</HI> they may be heard play at this Game a quarter of a Mile off: The Bones being all black or white make a double Game; if three of one colour, and two of another, then they afford but a single Game; four, of a colour, and one differing, is nothing; so long as the Man wins he keeps the Tray, but if he loose the next Man takes it. They are so bewitch'd with these two Games, that they will lose sometimes all they have; Beaver, <HI>Moose</HI>-skins, Kettles, <HI>Wampompeage, Mo∣whacks,</HI> Hatchets, Knives, all is confiscate by these two Games. For their Sports of
<PB N="156" REF="94"/>action they have commonly but three or four, as Football, Shooting, Running, and Swimming; when they play Countrey against Countrey, there are rich Goals, all behung with <HI>Wampompeage, Mowhacks,</HI> Beaver Skins, and black Otter Skins: Their Goals are a Mile long plac'd on the Sands, which are as even as a Board; their Ball is no bigger than a Hand-ball, which sometimes they mount in the Air with their naked Feet, sometimes it is sway'd by the multitude, sometime also it is two days before they get a Goal, then they mark the Ground they win, and begin there the next day. Before they come to this Sport they paint themselves, even as when they go to War, in policy to prevent future mischief, because no man should know him that mov'd his patience, or accidentally hurt his Person, taking away the oc∣casion of studying revenge. Before they begin, their Arms are put off, and hung upon some neighboring Tree, after which they make a long scrowl on the Sand, over which they shake Hands, and with loving Hearts scuffle for Victory. While the Men Play, the Boys Pipe, and the Women Dance and Sing Trophies of their Husbands Conquests; all being done, a Feast summons their departure.</P>
<P>Such is their dexterity in Shooting, that they can hit a running Hind, or flying Pigeon, without a standing pause or left-ey'd blinking; they draw their Arrows between their Fingers and the Thumb; their Bowes are quick, but not very strong, not killing at above six or seven score distance: Shooting at one another, they have a trick with swift conveyance to shun the Arrow; this they do to make them expert against time of War. They are train'd up to their Bowes even from their Childhood; for little Boys with Bowes made of little Sticks, and Arrows made of great Bents, will hit down a piece of Tobacco-pipe every time a good way off. As these <HI>Indians</HI> are good Marks-men, so are they well experienc'd where the very Life of every Creature lieth, and know where to smite him to make him die presently. Their Swimming is not after our <HI>English</HI> fashion, of spread Arms and Legs, which they hold too tiresom, but like Dogs, their Arms before them, cut∣ting through the Liquids with their right Shoulder: In this manner they will Swim very swift and far, either in rough or smooth Waters, sometimes for their ease lying as still as a Log; sometimes they will play the Dive-doppers, and come up in unexpected places.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Huntings.</NOTE>For their Hunting, it is to be noted, that they have no swift-footed Greyhounds to let slip at the sight of the Deer, no deep-mouth'd Hounds, or scenting Beagles, to find out their desired Prey; themselves are all this, who in that time of the year when the Deer comes down, having certain Hunting-houses in such places where they know the Deer doth usually frequent, in which they keep their Rendezvouz, their Snares, and all their Accoutrements for that Employment: when they get sight of a Deer, <HI>Moose,</HI> or Bear, they study how to get the Wind of him, and ap∣proaching within shot, stab their Mark quite through, if the Bones hinder not. The chief thing they Hunt after is Deer, <HI>Mooses</HI> and Bears: It grieves them more to see an <HI>English</HI>-man take one Deer, than a thousand Acres of Land. They Hunt likewise after Wolves, wild Cats, <HI>Rackoons,</HI> Otters, Beavers, and <HI>Musquashes,</HI> Trading both their Skins and Flesh to the <HI>English.</HI> Beside this Artillery they have other devices to kill their Game, as sometimes Hedges, a Mile or two Miles long, being a Mile wide at one end, and made narrower and narrower by degrees, lea∣ving onely a Gap of six Foot long; over against which in the day-time they lie lurking, to shoot the Deer which come through that narrow passage; so many as come within the circumference of that Hedge, seldom return back to leap over, unless they be forc'd by the chasing of some ravenous Wolf, or sight of some acci∣dental Passenger: In the Night, at the Gap of this Hedge, they set Deer-traps,
<PB N="157" REF="94"/>which are Springes made of young Trees, and smooth wrought Cords, so strong, that it will toss a Horse if he be caught in it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Fishings.</NOTE>In the Trade of Fishing they are very expert, being experienc'd in the know∣ledge of all Baits for several Fishes, and divers Seasons; being not ignorant like∣wise of the removal of Fishes, knowing when to Fish in Rivers, and when at Rocks, when in Bays, and when at Seas: Since the <HI>English</HI> came they are furnish'd with <HI>English</HI> Hooks and Lines, for before they made them of Hemp, being more curi∣ously wrought, of stronger Materials than ours, and hook'd with Bone-Hooks; but laziness drives them to buy, more than profit or commendations wins them to make of their own. They make likewise very strong Sturgeon-nets, with which they catch Sturgeons of twelve, fourteen, and sixteen, and some eighteen Foot long in the day-time, and in the night-time they betake themselves to their Birchen <HI>Canoos,</HI> in which they carry a forty-fathom Line, with a sharp-bearded Dart fastned at the end thereof; then lighting a Torch made of Birchen Rinds, they wave it to and again by their <HI>Canoo</HI> side, which the Sturgeon much delighted with, comes to them tumbling and playing, turning up his white Belly, into which they thrust their Lance, his Back being impenetrable; which done, they hale to the Shore their strugling Prize. They have often recourse into the Rocks whereupon the Sea beats, in warm Weather, to look out for sleepy Seals, whose Oyl they much esteem, using it for divers things. In Summer they Fish any where, but in Winter in the fresh Water onely, and Ponds; in frosty Weather they cut round Holes in the Ice, about which they will sit like so many Apes with their naked Breeches upon the cold Ice, catching of Pikes, Pearches, Breams, and other sorts of fresh-Water Fish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Arts and Mantifa∣ctures.</NOTE>Their Arts and Manufactures are divers, as first their dressing of all manner of Skins, which they do by scraping and rubbing, afterwards painting them with antique Embroiderings in unchangeable Colours; sometimes they take off the Hair, especially if it be not kill'd in season. Their Bowes they make of a handsom shape, strung commonly with the Sinews of <HI>Mooses;</HI> their Arrows of young Elder, feather'd with Feathers of Eagles Wings and Tails, headed with Brass in shape of a Heart or Triangle, fastned in a slender piece of Wood six or eight Inches long, which is fram'd to put loose in the pithy Elder, aftewards bound fast for riving: Their Arrows are made in this manner, because it might shake from his Head, and be left behind for their finding, and the Pile onely re∣main to gaul the wounded Beast. Their Cordage is so even, soft, and smooth, that it looks more like Silk than Hemp. Their Sturgeon Nets are not deep, nor above thirty or forty Foot long; which in ebbing low Waters they stake fast to the Ground where they are sure the Sturgeon will come, never looking more at it till the next low Water. Their <HI>Canoos</HI> are made either of Pine-trees, which before they were acquainted with <HI>English</HI> Tools, they burn'd hollow, scraping them smooth with Clam-shells and Oyster-shells, cutting their out-sides With Stone Hatchets. These Boats are not above a Foot and a half, or two Foot wide, and twenty Foot long. Their other <HI>Canoos</HI> be made of thin Birch Rinds, close Ribb'd, and on the in-side with broad thin Hoops, like the Hoops of a Tub; these are made very light, a Man may carry one of them a Mile, being made purposely to carry from River to River, and from Bay to Bay, to shorten Land-passages. In these cockling Fly-boats, wherein an <HI>English</HI>-man can scarce sit without a fearful tottering, they will venture to Sea, when an <HI>English</HI> Shallop dare not bear a Knot of Sail, scudding over the over-grown Waves as fast as a wind-driven Ship, being driven by their Paddles, being much like Battle-doors; if a cross Wave (which is seldom) turn her Keel up-side down, they by swimming free her, and scramble into her again.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Lan∣guage.</NOTE>Their Language, is onely peculiar to themselves, not inclining to any of the more refined Tongues. Some have thought they might be of the dispersed <HI>Jews,</HI> because some of their words are near unto the <HI>Hebrew;</HI> but by the same rule they may conclude them to be some of the gleanings of all Nations, because they have words which sound after the <HI>Greek, Latine, French,</HI> and other Tongues. Their Lan∣guage is hard to learn, few of the <HI>English</HI> being able to speak any of it, or capable of the right pronunciation, which is the chief grace of their Tongue: They pro∣nounce much after the Diphthongs, excluding <HI>L</HI> and <HI>R,</HI> which in our <HI>English</HI> Tongue they pronounce with as much difficulty, as most of the <HI>Dutch</HI> do <HI>T</HI> and <HI>H,</HI> calling a Lobster a <HI>Nobstann.</HI> Every Countrey doth something differ in their Speech, even as our Northern People do from the Southern, and Western from them; espe∣cially the <HI>Tarrentine,</HI> whose Tongue runs so much upon <HI>R,</HI> that they wharle much in pronunciation. When any Ships come near the Shore, they demand whether they are King <HI>Charles</HI>'s <HI>Torries,</HI> with such a rumbling sound, as if one were beating on an unbrac'd Drum. In serious Discourse our Southern <HI>Indians</HI> use seldom any short Colloquies, but speak their minds at large, without any interjected Discourses from any, the rest giving diligent audience to his utterance; which done, some or other returns him as long an Answer: They love not to speak <HI>multa, sed multum;</HI> seldom are their words and their deeds strangers. According to the matter of their discourse, so are their acting Gestures in their Expressions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Deaths, Bu∣rials and Mourning.</NOTE>The <HI>Indians</HI> are of lusty and healthful Bodies, not experimentally knowing those Diseases which are incident to other Countreys, as Feavers, Pleurisies, Calentures, Agues, Consumptions, Convulsions, Apoplexies, Dropsies, Gouts, Pox, Measles, or the like, but spin out the thred of their Days to a fair length, numbering sixty, eighty, some a hundred years: But when any one lies a dying, the doleful cries, and throbbing sighs of the Friends and Relations, express unspeakable sorrow; and when the Party is dead and laid in the Ground, they not onely weep and howl for a good space over the Grave, but also keep Annual Solemnities of Mourning, rubbing their Faces with black Lead all about the Eye-brows, and part of their Cheeks; yet do they hold the Immortality of the Soul, in which their <HI>Indian</HI> Faith jumps much with the <HI>Turkish Alchoran,</HI> dreaming of a certain Paradise, or South-West <HI>Elysium,</HI> wherein they shall everlastingly abide, solacing themselves in odori∣ferous Gardens, fruitful Corn-fields, green Meadows, bathing their tawny Hides in the cool Streams of pleasant Rivers, and sheltering themselves from Heat and Cold in the sumptuous Palaces fram'd by Nature, concluding, that neither care nor pain shall molest them, but that Natures bounty will administer all things with a vo∣luntary contribution from the Store-house of their <HI>Elysium;</HI> at the Portal whereof, they say, lies a great Dog, whose churlish snarlings deny admission to unworthy Intruders: wherefore it is their custom to bury with them their Bowes and Arrows, and good store of their <HI>Wampompeage</HI> and <HI>Mowhacks,</HI> the one to affright that affront∣ing <HI>Cerberus,</HI> the other to purchase more immense Prerogatives in their Paradise. For their Enemies and loose Livers, whom they account unworthy of this imagi∣nary Happiness, they say that they pass to the infernal Dwellings of <HI>Abamocho,</HI> to be tortur'd according to the Fictions of the ancient <HI>Heathen.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispositions, Employ∣ments, Usage by their Hus∣bands, Appa∣rel, and Mo∣desty of the Women.</NOTE>The drudgery of all laborious sorts of Work, and the management of all dome∣stick Affairs, lies wholly upon the <HI>Indian</HI> Women, who are made meer Slaves by their Husbands; they build the Houses, sowe and reap the Corn, provide Lobsters for their Husbands to bait their Hooks when they go a Fishing for <HI>Basse</HI> or Cod; and for these Lobsters they are many times forc'd to dive in the extreamest Wea∣ther, then lug home a great weight of them upon their Backs, as also all the Fish
<PB N="159" REF="95"/>which their Husbands catch for pleasure, from the places where they were caught: They dress all the Meat, serve it up to their Husbands, and waiting till they have fill'd their Bellies, are glad of their leavings. In Summer they gather Flags, of which they make Mats for Houses, and Hemp and Rushes, with Dying Stuff, of which they make curious Baskets, with intermixed Colours and Pourtraictures of antique Imagery. These Baskets are of all sizes from a Quart to a Quarter, in which they carry their Luggage. In Winter they are their Husbands Caterers, trudging to the Clam-banks for their Belly-timber, and their Porters to lug it home. They likewise sew their Husbands Shoes, and weave Coats of <HI>Turky</HI> Fea∣thers, besides all their ordinary Houshold drudgery which daily lies upon them, insomuch that a great Belly hinders no business, nor doth a Child-birth take much time, but the young Infant being greas'd and sooted, wrapp'd in a Beavers Skin, bound with his Feet up to his Bum, upon a Board two Foot long and one Foot broad, and his Face expos'd to all nipping Weather, this little <HI>Pappouse</HI> travels about with his bare-footed Mother to paddle in the Icy Clam-banks, after three or four days of Age have confirm'd her recovery. For their Carriage, it is very civil, Smiles being the greatest grace of their Mirth. Their Musick is Lullabies in Rocking their Chil∣dren, who generally are as quiet as if they had neither Spleen or Lungs. Their Voices are generally both sweet and well order'd, so far as pure Nature teacheth them. Their Modesty drives them to wear more Clothes than the Men, having al∣ways a Coat of Cloth or Skins, wrapp'd like a Blanket about their Loyns, reaching down to their Hams, which they never put off in Company.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns buile by the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>New Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE>There are to be reckon'd up forty five chief Towns, besides what others there may be of less note, built or made habitable by the <HI>English</HI> since their first arrival in <HI>New England,</HI> till about the Year 1650.</P>
<P>First, <HI>St. Georges Fort,</HI> where the first Plantation was setled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Georges Fort.</NOTE> at the Mouth of the River <HI>Sagadebock,</HI> in a kind of <HI>Peninsula,</HI> or half Island.</P>

This Town is almost square, consisting many years ago of above a hundred Dwelling-houses, ha∣ving also an Iron Mill in constant use: The Church being on a level Land, unde∣fended from the North-West Wind, is made with Steps descending into the Earth.</P>
<P>The ninth is call'd <HI>Water-town,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Water-town.</NOTE> anciently <HI>Pigsgusset,</HI> situated upon one of the Branches of <HI>Charles</HI>-River, water'd with many pleasant Springs and small Rivulets, running like Veins throughout her Body.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The present state of the Natives.</NOTE>The <HI>Indian</HI> Natives are now become so weak in number, and in some measure reduc'd to a dread of the growth of the <HI>English,</HI> that of late years they have not practis'd any thing against them, or at least, not justifi'd them by numbers in open Hostility, willing rather to purchase their Peace and buy off Injuries com∣mitted by them at the Price of their Lands and Possessions.</P>
<P>And although care and expence hath been many years apply'd to the Conversi∣on of <HI>Indians</HI> to the Faith, however inclinable they seem'd at first to the imbracing thereof, not then so well discerning the insincerity of its Professors; yet there are so few of late who do imbrace it or persevere in it (wanting a good Foundation for instruction in Moral Honesty, and perhaps the example of it in those that undertake to instruct them in Religion;) that <HI>Christianity</HI> to them seems a <HI>Chimera,</HI> Religion a design to draw them from the libidinous Pleasures of a lazy Life; however, some there are who make Profession of <HI>Christianity,</HI> and some who are educated in the Schools of <HI>New Cambridge,</HI> to entitle them to Preach the Gospel in their own Lan∣guage.</P>

New Assistants are, of late, put in nomination, by an Order of general Court, before∣hand to be consider'd of: If a Freeman give in a Blank, that rejects the Man nam'd; if the Freeman makes any mark with a Pen upon the Paper which he brings, that elects the Man nam'd: Then the Blanks and mark'd Papers are num∣ber'd, and according to the major part of either, the Man in Nomination stands elected or rejected; and so for all the Assistants. And after every new Election, which is, by their Patent, to be upon the last Wednesday in <HI>Easter</HI> Term, the new Governor and Officers are all new Sworn. The Governor and Assistants chuse the Secretary.

<P>Every Free-man when he is admitted, takes a strict Oath, to be true to the So∣ciety or Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>There are two general Courts, one every half year, wherein they make Laws or Ordinances: The Ministers advise in making of Laws, especially Ecclesiastical, and are present in Courts, and advise in some special Causes Criminal, and in framing of Fundamental Laws.</P>
<P>There are besides four Quarter-Courts for the whole Jurisdiction, besides other petty Courts, one every quarter at <HI>Boston, Salem,</HI> and <HI>Ipswich,</HI> with their several Ju∣risdictions; besides every Town, almost, hath a petty Court for small Debts and Trespasses, under twenty Shillings.</P>

<P>Though among the several Colonies which were founded here by the conflu∣ence of dissenting Zealots, this Government is exercis'd, differing from that of the Church and State of <HI>England:</HI> yet in those Provinces which are granted by parti∣cular Persons, the Government is much more conformable to that of <HI>England;</HI> but as the <HI>Mattachusets</HI> or <HI>Bostoners</HI> were from the beginning the most Potent and Predo∣minant of all the rest of the Colonies, (insomuch, that <HI>Boston</HI> may well be accoun∣ted the Metropolis of all <HI>New England,</HI>) so of late years they have still usurp'd more and more Power and Authority over the rest; and especially have not stuck to give Laws to the foresaid Provinces allotted to particular Persons, and have gone about wholly to subjugate those places to themselves, intrenching upon the rights of the true Proprietors; and that, even contrary to the Kings express Commands by his Officers, there, and as it were in open defiance of his Majesty and Government, as is evident from this following Narration, of their behavior upon a business of this nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of the <HI>Matta∣chusets</HI> against his Majesties Commissio∣ners.</NOTE>IN the Year of our Lord 1665. his Majesties Commissioners for the Affairs of <HI>New England,</HI> being in the Province of <HI>Mayne,</HI> the People being much unsetled in Point of Government, by reason the <HI>Mattachusets</HI> Colony, or <HI>Boston</HI> Govern∣ment, did usurp compulsively a Power over them contrary to their wills; and the right of Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> Heir, who had his Commission then in the place, did unanimously Petition to his Majesties Commissioners to settle the Government; upon which the said Commissioners examin'd the Bounds and Right of Mr. <HI>Gorges</HI> Patent, with all the Allegations and Pretensions on both sides, and so according
<PB N="165" REF="98"/>to their Instruction from his Majesty, did settle a temporary Government under his Majesty's immediate Authority, until such time as his Majesty should give his final determination thereof; and for that end did Institute Justices of the Peace to Go∣vern the Province according to the true Laws of <HI>England.</HI> Also his Majesty was pleas'd by his <HI>Mandamus</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1666, to the Governors of <HI>Boston,</HI> to signifie that it was his will and pleasure, That the Province of <HI>Main</HI> should stand good as his Commissioners had setled it, until he had more leisure to determine it; yet not∣withstanding, after three years quiet possession, and exercising of Government by the Kings Justices, according to their Commission granted by his Majesty's Com∣missioners, the <HI>Bostoners,</HI> without any Conference with the said Justices, did in a hostile manner oppose the King's Power, <HI>July</HI> 1668. which was as followeth:</P>
<P>The General Court of <HI>Boston</HI> sent their Warrants to keep Court at <HI>York</HI> under their Authority, and for that purpose Commissionated Magistrates by their own Authority, namely Major General <HI>John Leveret,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Ting,</HI> Captain <HI>Richard Walden,</HI> and Captain <HI>Robert Pike:</HI> Whereupon the King's Justices did oppose their Warrants, and sent Post to <HI>New York,</HI> with an Address to General <HI>Nicholas,</HI> for Ad∣vice what to do therein; who forthwith dispatch'd away to the Governors of <HI>Boston,</HI> informing them of the danger of their Proceeding, it being an open breach of Duty, to subvert the Government establish'd by his Majesty's Power; also sent the King's <HI>Mandamus, April</HI> 1666. that will'd to the contrary. Notwithstanding the <HI>Boston</HI> Magistrates in <HI>July</HI> 1668. in order to their <HI>Boston</HI> Commission, came to <HI>York</HI> Town in the said Province, with several Armed Men, Horse and Foot, to keep Court under their Authority; Opposition was made by the King's Justices, and his Majesty's Power was urg'd, but little regard thereunto shewn; his Majesties <HI>Mandamus</HI> was likewise much insisted upon, and produced by the Justices, who ask'd the <HI>Bostoners</HI> what they thought of it? and how they durst act so contrary to the King's Will and Pleasure? Major General <HI>Leveret</HI> told them, That he believ'd it might be the King's Hand, but he had a Commission from the general Court at <HI>Boston,</HI> which he would follow and observe by the help of God. The same day in the Afternoon the said Major General <HI>Leveret,</HI> with the rest of the <HI>Boston</HI> Magi∣strates, seiz'd and imprison'd the Province Marshal in doing his Office, and then forthwith went in warlike posture to the Court-house, where the King's Justices sat in Judicature, and putting them from their Seats, sat down themselves in their Places, and Executed their <HI>Boston</HI> Commission. The King's Justices drew a <HI>Protest</HI> against their Proceedings, and so left the Decision to God's Providence, and his Majesty's good Pleasure. Then they turn'd out all Officers, both Military and Ci∣vil, and Swore others in their Places under their Authority; they forc'd the whole Record of the Province out of the Recorders House contrary to his Will, by vertue of a Special Warrant from that Court. They imprison'd the Mayor of the said Province about three weeks, forcing him to give in five hundred Pound Bonds, not to act according to his Commission; which with some Reservations he was forc'd to deny for the security of his Estate.</P>
<P>These riotous Proceedings thus acted with such a precipitate fury, so incens'd his Majesty, that speedy care had been taken to reduce them to reason, had they not upon mature consideration bethought themselves afterwards to yield Obedience to his Majesties Orders.</P>
<P>Having treated at large of all that concerns <HI>New England</HI> in general, both in re∣ference to the Natives and the <HI>English</HI> Planters, we shall conclude with a brief view of the Provinces of <HI>Laconia</HI> and <HI>Main,</HI> as they are truly Describ'd (among other in∣genuous Collections and Observations of the Affairs of <HI>America,</HI> and especially
<PB N="166" REF="99"/>these Parts) by <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Heir to the above-mention'd Sir <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> and thereby sole Lord of the said Provinces, onely contracting what hath been by him deliver'd more at large.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A brief De∣scription of <HI>Laconia,</HI> a Province in <HI>New Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE>Among divers Plantations of the <HI>English</HI> happily Founded in <HI>New England,</HI> is a Province to the Landward, nam'd <HI>Laconia,</HI> so call'd by reason of the great Lakes therein, but by the ancient Inhabitants thereof it is call'd <HI>The Countrey of the Troquois:</HI> It lies between the Latitude of forty four and forty five Degrees, having the Ri∣vers of <HI>Sagadehock</HI> and <HI>Merrimeck</HI> on the Sea-Coast of <HI>New England,</HI> Southerly from it; into each of which Rivers there is a short Passage, frequented by the Salvages inhabiting near the Lakes. Also it hath the great Lakes which tend towards <HI>Cali∣fornia</HI> in the South Sea on the West thereof: On the North thereof is the great River of <HI>Canada,</HI> into which the said River disgorgeth it self by a fair large River, well replenish'd with many fruitful Islands: The Air thereof is pure and wholesom, the Countrey pleasant, having some high Hills, full of goodly Forrests, and fair Valleys and Plains, fruitful in Corn, Vines, Chesnuts, Wallnuts, and infinite sorts of other Fruits, large Rivers well stor'd with Fish, and inviron'd with goodly Mea∣dows full of Timber-trees.</P>
<P>One of the great Lakes is call'd <HI>The Lake of Troquois,</HI> which together with a Ri∣ver of the same Name, running into the River of <HI>Canada,</HI> is sixty or seventy Leagues in length.</P>
<P>In the Lake are four fair Islands, which are low and full of goodly Woods and Meadows, having store of Game for Hunting, as Stags, Fallow-Deer, Elks, Roe-Bucks, Beavers, and other sorts of Beasts which come from the Main Land to the said Islands.</P>
<P>The Rivers which fall into the Lakes have in them good store of Beavers; of which Beasts, as also of the Elks, the Salvages make their chiefest Traffick.</P>
<P>The said Islands have been inhabited heretofore by the Salvages, but are now abandon'd by reason of their late Wars one with another: They contain twelve or fifteen Leagues in length, and are seated commodiously for Habitation in the midst of the Lake, which abounds with divers kinds of wholesom Fish.</P>
<P>From this Lake run two Rivers Southward, which fall into the Eastern and Southern Sea-Coast of <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>Into this Lake there went many years since certain <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> who sided with the <HI>Algovinquins,</HI> with the help of their <HI>Canoos,</HI> which they carried the space of five Miles over the <HI>Impossible Falls,</HI> to Fight a Battel in revenge of some former In∣juries done by the <HI>Troquois</HI> to the <HI>Algovinquins,</HI> who had the Victory; for which cause the <HI>French</HI> have been so hated ever since by the Nation of the <HI>Troquois,</HI> that none of them durst ever appear in any part of that Lake. But their Trade, said to be sixteen thousand Beavers yearly, is partly sold to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who Trade with the West∣end of the said Lake over Land by Horses, from their Plantation upon <HI>Hudson</HI>'s <HI>River:</HI> and another part is conceiv'd to be purchas'd by the <HI>Hiroons,</HI> who being Newters, are Friends both to the one and the other; and these <HI>Hiroons</HI> bring down the greatest part of all by the River of <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>The Way over Land to this great Lake, from the Plantation of <HI>Pascataway,</HI> hath been attempted by Captain <HI>Walter Neale,</HI> once Governor, at the Charges of Sir <HI>Fer∣dinando Gorges,</HI> Captain <HI>Mason,</HI> and some Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> and the Discovery wanted but one days Journey of finishing, because their Victuals was spent, which, for want of Horses, they were enforc'd to carry with their Arms, and their Clothes, upon their Backs: They intended to have made a settlement for Trade by Pinnaces upon the said Lake, which they reckon to be about ninety or a hundred Miles from the Plantation over Land.</P>
<PB N="167" REF="99"/>
<P>The People of the Countrey are given to Hunting of wild Beasts, which is their chiefest Food.</P>
<P>Their Arms are Bowes and Arrows. Their Armor is made partly of Wood, and partly of a kind of twisted Stuff like Cotton-Wool.</P>
<P>Their Meat is Flour of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, of that Countreys growth, sodden to Pap, which they preserve for times of Necessity when they cannot Hunt.</P>
<P>This Province of <HI>Laconia,</HI> however known by a distinct Name, is included within the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> which offers it self next to our consideration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pro∣vince of <HI>Main.</HI></NOTE>All that part of the Continent of <HI>New England,</HI> which was allotted by Patent to Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> and to his Heirs, he thought fit to call by the Name of <HI>The Pro∣vince of Main.</HI> It takes it beginning at the entrance of <HI>Pascatoway</HI> Harbor, and so passeth up the same into the River of <HI>Newichwavoch;</HI> and through the same unto the farthest Head thereof; and from thence North-Westwards for the space of a hun∣dred and twenty Miles; and from the Mouth of <HI>Pascatoway</HI> Harbor aforesaid, North-Eastward along the Sea-Coast, to <HI>Sagadehock;</HI> and up the River thereof to <HI>Kinibequy</HI> River, even as far as the Head thereof; and into the Land North-West∣wards, for the space of a hundred and twenty Miles.</P>
<P>To these Territories are also adjoyn'd the North half of the Isles of <HI>Sholes,</HI> toge∣ther with the Isles of <HI>Capawick</HI> and <HI>Nautican,</HI> as also all the little Islands lying within five Leagues of the <HI>Main,</HI> all along the Sea-Coast, between the aforesaid Rivers of <HI>Pascatoway</HI> and <HI>Sagadehock.</HI></P>
<P>He no sooner had this Province setled upon him, but he gave publick notice, That if any one would undertake by himself and his Associates, to Transport a competent number of Inhabitants, to Plant in any part of his Limits, he would assign unto him or them such a proportion of Land, as should in reason satisfie them, reserving onely to himself some small High-Rent, as 2 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> or 2 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> for a hundred Acres <HI>per Annum:</HI> and if they went about to build any Town or City, he would Endow them with such Liberties and Immunities, as should make them capable to Govern themselves within their own Limits, according to the Liberties granted to any Town or Corporation within this Realm of <HI>England.</HI> And as for others of the meaner sort who went as Tenants, that they should have such quantities of Land assign'd them as they were able to manage, at the Rate of 4 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> or 6 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> an Acre, ac∣cording to the nature or situation of the Place they settle in.</P>
<P>And for the Division of the Province, and the Form of Government which he intended to Establish, he first divided the Province into several Parts; and those again he subdivided into distinct Regiments, as East, West, North, and South; those again into several Hundreds, Parishes and Tythings, and these to have their several Officers to Govern, according to such Laws as should be agreed upon by publick Assent of the Free-holders, with the approbation of himself or Deputy, and the principal Officers of the publick State.</P>
<P>The setled Government for the general State, to whom all Appeals were to be made, and from whom all Instructions for the welfare of the Publick were to issue, were to consist of himself or his Deputy, who was to be chosen every three year by himself, with the advice of his Council: Next a Chancellor for the determina∣tion of all Causes; A Treasurer, to whom the care of the publick Revenue was to be committed; A Marshal, whose Office was to oversee the Regiments, and to provide Men for publick Service; An Admiral, to take care of all Maritime Af∣fairs, to whom a Judge of the Admiralty was to be joyn'd to determine all Mari∣time Causes; A Master of the Ordnance, to look to the publick Arms and Am∣munition; A Secretary, to receive Intelligence, and to acquaint himself or Deputy
<PB N="168" REF="100"/>therewith. To these belong all their several Officers and Ministers for the Execu∣tion of all Matters proper to their several Places.</P>
<P>The chief Town of this Province is call'd <HI>Gorgiana,</HI> which is Govern'd by a Mayor, the rest are onely inconsiderable Villages or scatter'd Houses; but through Encouragement given to Adventurers and Planters, it may prove in time a very flourishing Place, and be replenish'd with many fair Towns and Cities, it being a Province both fruitful and pleasant.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. New Netherland, now call'd New York.</HEAD>
<P>THat Tract of Land formerly call'd <HI>The New Netherland,</HI> doth contain all that Land which lieth in the North parts of <HI>America,</HI> betwixt <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>Mary-Land;</HI> the length of which Northward into the Countrey, as it hath not been fully discover'd, so it is not certainly known: The breadth of it is about two hundred Miles. The principal Rivers within this Tract, are <HI>Hudson</HI>'s-River, <HI>Raritan</HI>-River, <HI>Delaware-Bay</HI>-River. The chief Islands are the <HI>Manhatans</HI>-Island, <HI>Long</HI>-Island, and <HI>Staten</HI>-Island.</P>
<P>The first which discover'd this Countrey was <HI>Henry Hudson,</HI> who being hir'd by the <HI>East-India</HI> Company to seek a Passage in the <HI>Northern America</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> set Sail <HI>Anno</HI> 1609. in the <HI>Half-Moon</HI> Frigat; coming before <HI>Terre-neuff,</HI> he stood about to∣wards the South-West, where Sailing up a great River, he found two Men Clad in in <HI>Ruffelo's</HI> Skins; and from thence arriv'd safe at <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P><HI>New Netherland</HI> thus discover'd, invited many Merchants to settle a firm Plan∣tation there; to which purpose they obtain'd Letters Patents in 1614. granted them by the <HI>States</HI> in the <HI>Hague,</HI> That they might onely Traffick to <HI>New Nether∣land;</HI> whereupon they earnestly prosecuting the Design, sent out <HI>Adrian Block</HI> and <HI>Godyn,</HI> who discover'd several Coasts, Isles, Havens, and Rivers.</P>
<P>The Countrey, as they said, being then void, was therefore free for any body that would take possession of it: Notwithstanding which pretence, they were scarce warm in their Quarters, when Sir <HI>Samuel Argal,</HI> Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> having first spoil'd the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Accadie,</HI> as we said, disputed the Possession with these also. And although they pleaded <HI>Hudson</HI>'s Right (who by Commission from King <HI>James,</HI> and upon an <HI>English</HI> Account, had lately discover'd those Parts) and pretended they had not onely bought all his Cards and Maps of the Countrey, but all his Interest and Right also, and had fully contented him for all his Pains and Charges in the Discovery; yet the said <HI>Hudson</HI> being an <HI>English</HI>-man, and acting all that he did by Commission from the King of <HI>England,</HI> upon Debate it was concluded, That the Land could not be alienated after Discovery without the King of <HI>England</HI>'s consent, especially it being but a part of the Province of <HI>Virginia,</HI> already possess'd by the Subjects of <HI>England:</HI> So that they were forc'd to wave that Title, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Go∣vernor submitted his Plantation to His Majesty of <HI>England,</HI> and to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> for and under him: Upon which Terms for a good while they held it. Afterwards, upon confidence, it seems, of a new Governor sent from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> they not onely fail'd to pay the promis'd Contribution and Tribute, but fell to fortifie themselves, and to entitle the Merchants of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to an absolute Propriety and Dominion of the Country, independent of any other; building Towns, as <HI>New Am∣sterdam;</HI> raising Forts, as <HI>Orange Fort,</HI> near the Branch of the <HI>Nordt River,</HI> which they call <HI>Hell-Gate.</HI> Complaint whereof being made to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and by his Am∣bassador

But taking advantage of the troubles in <HI>England,</HI> which then began to appear, and soon after follow'd, they not only go back from their first Propositions, and make higher Demands, but also most mischievously (as some report) furnish the Natives with Arms, and teach them the use of them, as it may be thought, ex∣pecting to use their help upon occasion, against the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>After His Majesties Restauration, His Majesty being truly inform'd of his just Pretences to all that Usurp'd Territory call'd <HI>New Netherland,</HI> (the same having been formerly part of <HI>New England</HI>) and of how great prejudice to the Act of Na∣vigation, and how dangerous Intruders the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> are generally▪ upon other Princes Dominions, what mischief might ensue to all our <HI>English</HI> Plantations in time of War, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> were permitted to strengthen themselves in the very heart of His Majesties Dominions, being Masters of one of the most commodious Ports and Rivers in <HI>America:</HI> His Majesty resolv'd to seize upon the same, as his undoubted Right, and in <HI>May</HI> 1664. having design'd four Commissioners to the perfecting of Affairs in <HI>New England,</HI> Collonel <HI>Richard Nichols,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Carr, George Cartwnight,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Mawrick</HI> Esquires, with three Ships of War to convey them to <HI>Boston:</HI> The matter was so order'd, that the same Ships serv'd for the re∣ducing of the Town and Fort of <HI>New Amsterdam,</HI> upon conditions, advantageous to His Majesty, and easie to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Now begins <HI>New Netherland</HI> to lose the Name, for His Majesty having conferr'd by Patent upon his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Albany,</HI> all the Acquisiti∣ons made upon Foraigners, together with <HI>Long-Island,</HI> the West end whereof was wholly setled and Peopled by <HI>Dutch-men;</HI> his Royal Highness impower'd, by Commission as his Deputy-Governor, Colonel <HI>Nichols,</HI> Groom of his Bed-cham∣ber, to take the Charge and Direction of Reducing and Governing all those Terri∣tories; it was by him thought fit, to change some principal denominations of Places, <HI>viz.

<P>It is plac'd upon the neck of the Island <HI>Manhatans,</HI> looking towards the Sea; en∣compass'd with <HI>Hudson's</HI> River, which is six Miles broad; the Town is compact and oval, with very fair Streets and several good Houses; the rest are built much after the manner of <HI>Holland,</HI> to the number of about four hundred Houses, which in those parts are held considerable: Upon one side of the Town is <HI>James-Fort,</HI> capable to lodge three hundred Souldiers and Officers; it hath four Bastions, forty Pieces of Cannon mounted; the Walls of Stone, lin'd with a thick Rampart of Earth; well accommodated with a Spring of fresh Water, always furnish'd with Arms and Ammunition, against Accidents: Distant from the Sea seven Leagues, it affords a safe Entrance, even to unskilful Pilots; under the Town side, Ships of

<P>About ten Miles from <HI>New York</HI> is a Place call'd <HI>Hell-Gate,</HI> which being a nar∣row Passage, there runneth a violent Stream both upon Flood and Ebb; and in the middle lie some Rocky Islands, which the Current sets so violently upon, that it threatens present Shipwrack; and upon the Flood is a large Whirlwind, which continually sends forth a hideous roaring, enough to affright any Stranger from passing farther, and to wait for some <HI>Charon</HI> to conduct him through; yet to those that are well acquainted, little or no danger: It is a place of great Defence against any Enemy coming in that way, which a small Forticfiation would absolutely prevent, and necessitate them to come in at the West end of <HI>Long-Island</HI> by <HI>Sandy Hook,</HI> where <HI>Nutten Island</HI> forces them within the Command of the Fort at <HI>New York,</HI> which is one of the best Pieces of Defence in the North parts of <HI>America.</HI> It is built most of Brick and Stone, and cover'd with red and black Tyle, and the Land being high, it gives at a distance a pleasing prospect to the Spectators.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wholesom Waters.</NOTE>This Countrey hath many removable Water-falls, descending from steep Rocks, large Creeks and Harbors, fresh Lakes and Rivulets, pleasant Fountains and Springs, some of which boyl in the Winter, and are cold and delightful to drink in Summer. The Inhabitants never receive any damage by Deluges; neither from the Sea, because the Water rises not above a Foot; nor by the swelling Rivers, which sometimes, for a few days covering the Plains, at their deserting them, leave them fat and fruitful. The Sea-Coast is Hilly, and of a sandy and clayie Soil, which produces abundance of Herbs and Trees.</P>
<P>The Oak grows there generally sixty or seventy Foot high,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees.</NOTE> and for the most part free from Knots, which makes it the better fit for Shipping.</P>
<P>The Nut-trees afford good Fuel, and a strange Prospect when the Wood is set on fire, either to hunt out a Deer, or to clear the Ground fit to be Till'd.</P>
<P>Some Plants brought hither, grow better than in <HI>Holland</HI> it self, as Apples, Pears, Cherries, Peaches, Apricocks, Strawberries, and the like.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Water Lem∣mmons.</NOTE>All manner of Plants known in <HI>Europe</HI> grow in their Gardens: The Water-Lemmons, no less pleasing to the Palate than healthful when grown ripe; they are about the bigness of an indifferent Cabbage: the <HI>English</HI> press a Juice out of them, which if it did not turn sowre in a short time, might well be compar'd with <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Wine.</P>

<P>When Captain <HI>William Clieff, Anno</HI> 1645. us'd the <HI>Indian</HI> Interpreter <HI>Agheroense</HI> (to decide the Differences which arose between the <HI>West-India Company</HI> and the wild People call'd <HI>Makwaes,</HI>) he observ'd him to paint his Face with a yellow glittering colour, which he judg'd to be of some rich Mineral: whereupon buying some of the said <HI>Agheroense,</HI> he put it into a Crusible, and gain'd two small pieces of Gold out of the same, valu'd at six Shillings; but keeping it private, and purchasing a
<PB N="172" REF="104"/>great quantity of the said Mineral from <HI>Agheroense</HI> (who had show'd him the Moun∣tain which produced the same) extracted good store of Gold out of it; which pos∣sessing <HI>Clieff</HI> with a belief of having found out a business of great consequence, he sent <HI>Arent Corsen</HI> of <HI>New-haven</HI> with the fore-mention'd Mineral to <HI>Holland;</HI> but the Ship being never heard, of afterwards, and the Princess Pink, in which Captain <HI>Clieff</HI> was himself, with store of the new-found Mineral, being cast away, the Bu∣siness came to nothing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Paint after a strange man∣ner.</NOTE>The Inhabitants, though divided into several Nations, yet agree in many things, as in painting their Bodies, Shields, Clubs, and other Utensils in their Houses. The! Colours wherewith they paint themselves they press out of Plants, or make them of certain Stones grownd into very fine Powder. The chiefest Plant is not unlike the Myrtle, onely it hath more Boughs, and bears red Berries; the Juice of which being dry'd in the Sun, is afterwards preserv'd in little Bags. The Na∣tives temper their Colours with Water, and paint their Bodies with the same: It is as good a Purple as can be found. They also draw Ships, Trees, and Beasts after a very rough manner: In stead of Feathers they wear pleited Hair, which being colour'd red, hath an excellent gloss, which never fades though it Rain on the same.</P>
<P>The Horses bred in this Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horses.</NOTE>being either brought thither from <HI>Eng∣land</HI> or <HI>Utrecht,</HI> far exceed those of <HI>English</HI> breed; but are both of them subject to a strange Disease, of which many die in few hours. The same Distemper also seizes on Cattel if they go into Forrest Pasture: But the onely thing to cure the same, is Hay from salt Marshy Grounds.</P>
<P>The Oaken Woods have store of Hogs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hogs.</NOTE> which if taken and fatned with <HI>Turkish</HI> Wheat, are most delicious Meat.</P>
<P>The Sheep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheep.</NOTE> though they breed well there, yet are very scarce, because the Plan∣ters not being able to spare Men to watch them, they are often devour'd by Wolves.</P>
<P>There are also abundance of Deer, all sorts of Fowls, Turkies, Geese, Ducks, Pigeons, and the like.</P>
<P>The Lyons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lyons.</NOTE> whosc Skins the <HI>Indians</HI> bring to Market, are taken on a high Moun∣tain fifteen days Journey South-West from thence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Black Bears.</NOTE>There are likewise many black Bears, fearful of humane kind, but if Hunted, they run direct on those that pursue them: they sleep all the Winter, lying six Weeks Oh one side, and six on the other, and sucking their Feet all the time: They generally lurk among Brambles, or in the Concavities of some hollow Mountain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Beasts.</NOTE>On the Borders of <HI>Canada</HI> there is seen sometimes a kind of Beast which hath some resemblance with a Horse, having cloven Feet, shaggy Mayn, one Horn just on their Forehead, a Tail like that of a wild Hog, black Eyes, and a Deers Neck: it feeds in the nearest Wildernesses: the Males never come amongst the Females except at the time when they Couple, after which they grow so ravenous, that they not onely devour other Beasts, but also one another.</P>
<P>Towards the South of <HI>New York</HI> are many Buffles, Beasts which (according to <HI>Erasmus Stella</HI>) are betwixt a Horse and a Stag: though they are of a strong Consti∣tution, yet they die of the smallest Wound, and are subject to the Falling-sick∣ness: they have broad branchy Horns like a Stag, short Tail, rough Neck, Hair colour'd according to the several Seasons of the Year, broad and long Ears, hang∣ing Lips, little Teeth, and Skin so thick, as not easie to be pierced: The Females differ from the Males, for they have no Horns; both may easily be made tame: when Hunted, they vorm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> a sort of scalding Liquor on the Dogs: they have

<P>But no Beasts are more plentiful here than Harts and Stags,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harts.</NOTE> which feed up and down in great Herds: when they are Hunted by Wolves or Men, they immedi∣ately take the next River, where they are caught several together, by being cross'd in their Swimming, and affrighted by the Eccho which comes from the Mountains, made by the Hunters hollowing on the other Shore, which makes them fearful of Landing: whilst the Huntsmen joyning several pieces of Wood together get up∣on them, and Rowing towards these Deer, intercept them, being tir'd and out of breath.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Musk-Cats.</NOTE>Moreover, this Countrey breeds many Musk Cats, especially in Marshy Grounds. These Beasts are beautiful to the Eye, having black speckled Skins, their Mouths, full of sharp Teeth, and their Tails being long trail after them.</P>
<P>Many of the Learned maintain a Dispute concerning Civet, Whether it be the Seed of the Civet-Cat? the Affirmative, which <HI>Cardanus</HI> maintain'd, is contradicted by <HI>Julius Scaliger. Matthiolus,</HI> an Author of no little credit, supposes that Civet is the Sweat of the Cat, because it is most chiefly taken when these Beasts are exceed∣ingly vex'd and wearied: But since the Sweat runs from all parts of the Body, which nevertheless do not all produce Civet, it is impossible that Sweat should be Civet. Others account Civet to be the Dung of the Cats; which last seems to come nearest to truth: for certainly it is nothing else but an Excrement in the fleshy parts about their Pizzle, or near the Fundament. The Cats being in pain to be discharg'd of this Civet, free themselves from it by rubbing a Tree; and also fawn on those which take it from them with a Spoon.</P>
<P>Besides all other wild Creatures, the Countrey according to <HI>Adrian Vander Donk,</HI> produces yearly eighty thousand Beavers.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin.</HI> lib. 32. cap. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Pliny</HI> relates, that these Beasts bite off their Pizzles and throw them to the Hunter, which are an exceeding good Me∣dicine to help Abortion, stop the Monethly Flowers, Giddiness in the Head,
<PB N="174" REF="105"/>Gout, Lameness, Belly and Toot-ach, Rhumes, Poyson, and the Evil. But <HI>Pliny</HI> makes a great mistake herein, for the Beavers have a small Pissel fasten'd to their Back bone, in such a manner, that they cannot loose them but with hazard of their lives: They live in the Water, and on the Shore, in great companies together, in Nests built of Wood, which deserve no small admiration, being made after this manner: The Beavers first gather all the loose Wood, which they find along the Banks of the Rivers, of which, if there be not enough, they bite the Bark off from the Trees in the neighboring Woods, then with their Tusks, of which two grow above, and two below in their Mouths, they gnaw the main body of the Tree so long, till it drops asunder: Their Nests very artificial, are six Stories high, cover'd on the top with Clay to keep out Rain; in the middle is a passage which goes to the River, into which they run so soon as they perceive a Man; to which purpose one of them stands Sentinel, and in the Winter keeps open the Water from freez∣ing, by continual moving of his Tail, which is flat without Hair, and the most delicious Meat that can be had. The Beavers go big sixteen Weeks, and once a year bring forth four young, which suck and cry like young Children, for the Dam of them rises on her hinder Feet, and gives her Teats, which grow between the fore-legs to two of her young, each of them one; the foremost legs of a Beaver resemble those of a Dog, the hindermost those of a Goose; on each side of the vent are two swellings within two thin Skins; out of their vent runs generally an Oily moysture, with which they anoint all the parts of their body which they can reach, to keep them from being wet; within they are like a cut-up Hog; they live on the Leaves and Barks of Trees; they love their young ones exceedingly; the long Hairs, which shining, stick out on the back, fall off in Summer, and grow again against Harvest; they have short Necks, strong Sinews and Legs, and move very swiftly in the Water, and on the Land; if incompass'd by Men or Dogs, they bite most severely; the right <HI>Castoreum,</HI> so highly esteem'd by Physicians, is a long <HI>Vesica,</HI> not unlike a Pear, within the body of the female Beaver, the <HI>Indians</HI> mince the Cods of the Male Beavers amongst their Tobacco, because they produce no <HI>Castoreum.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowls in <HI>New York.</HI></NOTE>This Country abounds also with Fowls; for besides Hawks, Kites, and other Birds of Prey, there are abundance of Cranes, of several sorts, some grey, some brown, others quite white; all of them have firm Bodies, and Bones without Mar∣row, Claws of a finger long, strong and crooked Bills, their Brains dry, their Eyes little and hollow, hard Features, the left Foot lesser than the right, both deform'd, their Blood thick, and the Excrements of a horrid smell; they breed most in old Woods, whose ground is without Brambles, and also near the Water, for they feed on Fish, and devour all sorts of Fowls, nay, snatch up Hares, Rabbets, Tor∣tels, and several other sorts of Animals, which they carry away with them in the Air; nay, when hungry, they seize on one anorher; some of them fly abroad for their prey about noon, others at Sun-rising; they fall like Lightning on what e're they pursue; they drink little, except the Blood of those Creatures which they de∣vour; they are very libidinous, coupling above thirty times a day, not only with their like, but also with the Hens of Hawks, and other Birds; they lay their big∣gest Eggs in thirty days, and the lesser in twenty days; they generally bring forth three young; those of them that cannot endure to look full against the Sun, are thrown out of their Nests; the young ones when they begin to be fledg'd, are by the old carry'd into the Air, and let flie, but supported by them; their sight is wonderful quick; for though they flie as high as ever they are able to be discern'd, yet they can see the lead Fish that is in the Water, and a Hare lying in the Bushes: their Breath stinks horribly, wherefore their Carcases suddenly rot; though they
<PB N="175" REF="105"/>are libidinous, yet they live long; most of them die of hunger, because their Bills when they grow old, grow so crooked, that they cannot open the same, where∣fore they flie up into the Air against the Sun, and falling into the coldest Rivers, loose their Feathers and die.</P>
<P>Besides the foremention'd Birds of prey, there are abundance of Storks, Ravens, Crows, Owls, Swallows, Gold-finches, Ice-birds, Kites, Quails, Pheasants, and Winter-<HI>Kings,</HI> and which are most remarkable for their rich Feathers, the <HI>Spechtes,</HI> they pick great holes in Trees, and make a noise as if a Man were cutting down a Tree. The Pigeons flie in such flocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pigeons.</NOTE> that the <HI>Indians</HI> remove with them to the place where they make their Nests, where the young ones being taken by hundreds, serve them for a Moneths Provision.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>New York</HI> breeds a strange Bird about a Thumb long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pretty Birds.</NOTE> full of gli∣stering Feathers; it lives by sucking of Flowers like a Bee, and is so tender, that it immediately dies if water be spirted upon it; the Carcase being dry'd, is kept for a Rarity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Turkies.</NOTE>But this Countrey abounds chiefly in Turkies, whose plenty deserves no less admiration than their bulk, and the delicious taste of their Flesh, for they go feeding forty or fifty in a flock, and weigh sometime forty or fifty pound apiece; the Na∣tives either shoot them, or take them with a Bait stuck on an Angle: In <HI>March</HI> and Harvest the Waters swarm with Geese, Teal, Snites, Ducks, and Pelicans, besides many strange sorts of Fowls not known in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Rivers and Lakes produce Sturgeon, Salmon, Carps, Pearch, Barbils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fish.</NOTE> all sorts of Eels, and many other Fish which are taken near Water-falls: The Sea af∣fords Crabs with and without Shells, Sea-cocks, and Horses, Cod, Whiting, Ling, Herrings, Mackrel, Flounders, Tar-buts, Tortels, and Oysters, of which some are a Foot long, and have Pearl, but are a little brownish.</P>
<P>Amongst the Poysonous Creatures which infest <HI>New York,</HI> the chiefest and most dangerous, is the <HI>Rattle-Snake,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rattle-Snake.</NOTE> whose description we have already had at large in <HI>New England.</HI></P>

No sooner had <HI>Hudson</HI> enter'd the House, but he was receiv'd on two Mats spread on the ground; and two Men immediately were sent out to shoot Venison or Fowls; and instantly returning, brought two Pigeons; a fat Dog, whom they nimbly flea'd with shells, was also laid down to the fire:

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Ne∣therlands. <HI>Apparel.</HI></NOTE>The Habits of the Natives, especially of the Men, are few; the Women go more neat than the Men; and though the Winter pinches them with excessive, cold, yet they go naked tiil their thirteenth year: Both Men and Women wear a Girdle of Whale-fins and <HI>Sea-shells;</HI> the Men put a piece of Cloth, half an Ell long, and three quarters broad, between their Legs, so that a square piece hangs behind be∣low his Back, and another before over his Belly. The Women wear a Coat which comes half way down their Legs, so curiously wrought with <HI>Sea-shells,</HI> that one Coat sometimes costs thirty Pounds. Moreover, their Bodies are cover'd with Deer∣skins, the lappets or ends of which hang full of Points; a large Skin button'd on the right Shoulder, and ty'd about the middle, serves for an upper Garment, and in the Night for a Blanket: Both Men and Women go for the most part bare∣headed; the Women tie their Hair behind in a tuft, over which they wear a square Cap wrought with <HI>Sea-shells,</HI> with which they adorn their Foreheads, and also wear the same about their Neck and Hands, and some also about their middle. Before the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were Planted here, they wore Shoes and Stockings of <HI>Buffelo's</HI>-skins; some likewise made Shoes of Wheaten-straw, but of late they come nearer to our Fashions: The Men Paint their Faces with several Colours; the Women only put here and there a black Spot; both of them are very reserv'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their houses.</NOTE>Their Houses are most of them built of one fashion, onely differing in length; all of them agree in breadth of twenty Foot: They build after this manner, they set Peel'd Boughs of Nut-Trees in the ground, according to the bigness of the place which they intend to build, then joyning the tops of the Boughs together, they cover the Walls and top with the Bark of Cypress, Ashen, and Chest-nut-Trees, which are laid one upon another, the smallest side being turn'd inwards: according to the bigness of the Houses, several Families, to the number of fifteen
<PB N="177" REF="106"/>dwell together, every one having his Apartment. Their Fortifications are most of them built on steep Hills, near Rivers; the access to them is onely at one place, they are built after this manner: They set great Poles in the Ground, with Oaken <HI>Pallisadoes</HI> on each side, cross-ways one amongst another; between the crosses they set other Trees, to strengthen the Work: Within this inclos'd they generally build twenty or thirty Houses, of which some are a hundred and eighty Foot long, and some less, all of them full of People: In the Summer they pitch Tents along by the River side to Fish; against Winter they remove into the Woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Romove.</NOTE> to be near their Game of Hunting, and also Fuel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Wives.</NOTE>To take many Women is not customary here, only amongst Military Officers, who Marry three or four Wives, which so well agree, that there is never any dif∣ference betwixt them; those that are not of Age, never Marry but with the consent and advice of their Parents: Widows and unmarry'd Men follow their own opini∣on and choice; only they take Cognizance of their Estates and Extraction: The Bridegroom always presents the Bride; for the least offence, the Man after having soundly beaten his Wife, turns her out of Doors, and Marries another, insomuch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriages.</NOTE> that some of them have every year a new Wife: On breach of Marriage, the Chil∣dren follow the Mother, from whom they account their Generation: They ac∣count Adultery, if committed under the bare Canopy of Heaven, a great Sin: Whoring is Licenc'd to single Women, if they receive Money for it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whoring per∣mitted.</NOTE> and no Man scruples to Marry them; nay, those that are Marry'd, boast how many they have enjoy'd before their Marriage: She that is inclin'd to Marry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Mar∣rying.</NOTE> covers her whole body, and sets her self wrapt up in the middle of the way, where a Batchelor passing by sees her, and makes up the Match blindfold: When impregnated, they take great care that their Fruit receives no hindrance nor prejudice:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Child-bear∣ing Womens strange acti∣ons.</NOTE> When the time of their Delivery approaches, (which they know exactly) they go to a Melan∣cholly place in the Woods, though in the coldest Weather, where they raise up a Hut of Mats, and bring the Child into the World without any help or Company, wash the Child in cold Water, and wrap it up in Mats; then a few days after go∣ing home, they bring up the Infant with great care, none putting them out to Nurse: So long as a Woman gives suck, or is quick with Child, she will not ad∣mit of Copulation; one who hath the Flowers, never comes abroad: In time of sickness they faithfully assist one another: When any die,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funerals.</NOTE> the nearest Relations shut their Eyes; and after having watch'd them some days, they are Interr'd after this manner: The Corps is plac'd sitting with a Stone under its Head, near it they set a Pot, Kettle, Dish, Spoons, Money, and Provisions to use in the other World; then they pile Wood round about it, and cover it over with Planks, on which throwing Earth and Stones, they set <HI>Pallisadoes,</HI> and make the Grave like a House, to which they shew Veneration, wherefore they account it a great piece of villany to deface any thing of it: The Men make no shew of sorrow over the Dead, but the Women mourn exceedingly, and carry themselves very strangely, beating their Breasts, scratching their Faces, and calling night and day on the name of the De∣ceas'd: The Mothers make great Lamentation at the Death of their Children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mourning over the dead remarkable.</NOTE> es∣pecially Sons, for they shave off the Hair of their Heads, which at the Funeral is burnt in the presence of all their Relations; which is also perform'd by the Wo∣men when their Husbands die; besides, they black all their Faces, and putting on a Hart-skin Shirt, mourn a whole year, notwithstanding they liv'd very conten∣tiously together.</P>
<P>On some occasions they go a Worshipping of the Devil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conjurers.</NOTE> to a certain place where the Sorcerers shew strange Feats of Activity, tumbling over and over, beating
<PB N="178" REF="107"/>themselves, and hot without great noise leaping in and about a great Fire: at last they make a great Cry all together; upon which (as they say) the Devil appears to them in the shape either of a tame or wild Beast: the first signifies bad, and the other good fortune; both inform them of future Events, though darkly; and if the bu∣siness fall out contrary, they affirm that they have not rightly understood the De∣vil's meaning. Moreover they bewitch some in such a manner, that they foam at the Mouth, throw themselves into the Fire, and beat themselves severely; and so soon as they whisper in the Ear of those whom they have bewitch'd, they immedi∣ately recover their former health.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Language of the <HI>New Ne∣therlanders.</HI></NOTE>The Language of this Countrey is very various, yet it is divided into onely four principal Tongues, as the <HI>Manhattans, Wappanoo, Siavanoo,</HI> and <HI>Minqua's,</HI> which are very difficult for Strangers to learn, because they are spoken without any Grounds or Rules.</P>
<P>Their Money is made of the innermost Shells of a certain Shell-fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Money.</NOTE> cast up twice a year by the Sea: These Shells they grind smooth, and make a Hole in the middle, cutting them of an exact bigness, and so put them on Strings, which then serve in stead of Gold, Silver, and Copper Coin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vices and Vertues.</NOTE>Now to say something of the Vices and Vertues of the Inhabitants. They are in the first place very slovenly and nasty, stubborn, covetous, revengeful, and much addicted to filching and stealing. Some appear reserv'd, using few words, which they utter after serious consideration, and remember a long time. Their Under∣standings being improv'd by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> they are quick of apprehension, to di∣stinguish good from bad: they will not endure any Oppression, but are very patient of Heat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Stoves.</NOTE> Cold, Hunger and Thirst. They have a strange way of using Stoves, which are set in the Ground and cover'd with Earth, into which they go through a little Door. A sick Person coming into the same, sets himself down, and places hot Stones round about him; which done, and having sweat a considerable time, he leaps into cold Water, by which he finds ease of all his Distempers.</P>
<P>Though these People know no great distinction between Man and Man, as other Nations, yet they have noble and ignoble Families amongst them; superior and inferior Offices, which they enjoy by Inheritance; but sometimes the Martial Offices are bestowed according to the Valour of the Persons: Their Generals sel∣dom give their Enemies a Field-Battel, by drawing or dividing their Men into Re∣giments or Companies, but make it their whole Design to defeat their Enemies by sudden Sallies from Ambuscado's; for they never stand out a close Fight, unless compell'd to it, but if encompass'd round, they fight to the last Man. When any danger threatens, the Women and Children are convey'd to a secure place. Their Arms formerly were Bowes and Arrows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> and Battel-axes, but now they use Mus∣quets, which they have learn'd to-handle with great dexterity. Their square Shields cover all their Bodies and Shoulders. About their Heads they tie a Snakes Skin, in the middle of which sticks either a Fox's or Bear's Tail. They cannot be known by their Faces, they are all over so besmear'd with Paint of divers colours. They seldom give Quarter to their Enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable actions some Prison∣ers.</NOTE> except Women and Children, which the Conquerors use as their own, that by that means they may increase and strengthen themselves: and if any Prisoner is not kill'd presently after the Battel, but falls into the Hands of one whose Relations have formerly been slain by his Party, he is Roasted three days by degrees before he gives up the Ghost. It de∣sences no small admiration, that the Sufferer during the whole time of his Torture, Sings till he breathes his last. They have few or no Punishments for any Offence, committing few Crimes which are by them accounted Capital.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws.</NOTE> If any one steal,
<PB N="179" REF="107"/>and the Goods be found in his custody, the Governor of the place where he resides commands him onely to restore the same to the Owner. If any one murther or kill the other, the Relations of the slain, if they can take the Malefactor in twenty four hours, may without Examination or delay put him to death also; but that time being once expir'd, the Revenger is liable to be kill'd in the same time by his Rela∣tions whom he slew. All Obligations have their power and vertue from certain Presents deliver'd upon the making of a Contract, which is done thus: They dry as many Sticks as they have Articles, which if they agree upon, every Man on the concluding of the Discourse lays a Present before the others Feet. Sometimes they hang up the Presents, because they are often three days in Consultation before they resolve; after which if the Presents be taken down, it is a certain sign of their Agreement; but if not, they proceed no farther, unless the Articles and Presents are alter'd. On Businesses of consequence the Commonalty repair to their Gover∣nor's House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council-As∣sembly.</NOTE> there to hear and enquire what the Nobility there assembled have concluded or resolv'd on; at which the best Orator standing up, tells them their Intentions. It happens sometimes that a turbulent Person making a Mutiny, and refusing to hearken to reason, is immediately beheaded by one of the Nobility; in contradiction of which none dare presume to speak the least word.</P>
<P>There are scarce any steps of Religion found amongst these People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> onely they suppose the Moon to have great influence on Plants. The Sun, which over-looks all things, is call'd to witness whene're they Swear. They bear great respect, and stand much in fear of <HI>Satan,</HI> because they are often plagued by him when they go a Hunting or Fishing: wherefore the first of what they take is burnt in honor of him, that he to whom they ascribe all wickedness might not hurt them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diabolical Worship.</NOTE> When they feel pain in any part of their Body, they say that the Devil sits in the same. They acknowledge that there resides a God above the Stars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ridicu∣lous Opinion of God.</NOTE> but troubles not him∣self with what the Devil doth on Earth, because he continually recreates himself with a most beautiful Goddess, whose original is unknown: She on a certain time (say they) descended from Heaven into the Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As also of the Creation.</NOTE> (for before the Creation all things were Water) into which she had instantly sunk, had not the Earth arose un∣der her Feet, which grew immediately to such a bigness, that there appear'd a World of Earth, which produc'd all sorts of Herbs and Trees; whilst the Goddess taking to her self a Hart, Bear, and Wolf, and Conceiving by them, she was not long after delver'd of several Beasts at one time: and from thence proceeded not onely the diversity of Beasts, but also Men, of which some are black, white, or sallow; in nature fearful like a Hart, or cruel and valiant like a Bear, or deceitful like Wolves: after this the Mother of all things ascended up to Heaven again, and sported there with the Supream Lord, whom they say they know not, because they never saw him: wherefore they shall have less to answer for than <HI>Christians,</HI> which pretend to know him to be the Punisher of things both good and bad, which are daily committed by them: and for this ridiculous Opinion they can hardly be brought to embrace the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Im∣mortality of The Soul.</NOTE>Concerning the Souls of the Deceased, they believe, that those which have been good in their life-time, live Southward in a temperate Countrey, where they enjoy all manner of pleasure and delight; when as the Wicked wander up and down in a miserable Condition.

For other Dances they onely shew what antick Tricks their ignorance will lead them to, wringing of their Bodies and Faces after a strange manner, sometimes jumping into the Fire, sometimes catching up a Firebrand, and biting off a live Coal, with many such tricks, that will affright rather than please an <HI>English</HI>-man to look upon them, resembling rather a company of infernal Furies than Men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their sitting in Council.</NOTE>When their King or <HI>Sachem</HI> sits in Council, he hath a Company of Arm'd Men to guard his Person, great respect being shewn him by the People, which is princi∣pally manifested by their silence. After he hath declared the cause of their Con∣vention, he demands their Opinion, ordering who shall begin: The Person or∣der'd to speak, after he hath declar'd his mind, tells them he hath done: no Man ever interrupting any Person in his Speech, nor offering to speak, though he make never so many long stops, till he says he hath no more to say. The Council having all declar'd their Opinions, the King after some pause gives the definitive Sentence, which is commonly seconded with a shout from the People, every one seeming to applaud and manifest their Assent to what is determin'd.</P>
<P>If any Person be condemn'd to die, which is seldom, unless for Murther or In cest, the King himself goes out in Person (for you must understand they have no Prisons, and the guilty Person flies into the Woods) where they go in quest of him, and-having found him, the King shoots first, though at never such a distance, and then happy is the Man that can shoot him down; for he that hath the for∣tune to be Executioner, is for his pains made some Captain, or other Military Officer.</P>

<P>Within two Leagues of <HI>New York</HI> lieth <HI>Staten-Island,</HI> it bears from <HI>New York</HI> West something Southerly: It is about twenty Miles long, and four or five broad, mosr of it very good Land, full of Timber, and producing all such Commodities as <HI>Long-Island</HI> doth, besides Tin and store of Iron Oar; and the <HI>Calamine</HI> Stone is said likewise to be found there: There is but one Town upon it, consisting of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> but it is capable of entertaining more Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Betwixt this and <HI>Long-Island</HI> is a large Bay, which is the coming in for all Ships and Vessels out of the Sea.</P>
<P>On the North-side of this Island <HI>After-skull</HI> River puts into the Main Land, on the West-side whereof there are two or three Towns, but on the East-side but one. There are very great Marshes or Meadows on both sides of it, excellent good Land, and good convenience for the setling of several Towns. There grows black Wal∣nut and Locust, as there doth in <HI>Virginia,</HI> with mighty, tall, streight Timber, as good as any in the North of <HI>America:</HI> It produceth any Commodity which <HI>Long-Island</HI> doth.</P>
<P><HI>Hudson</HI>'s River runs by <HI>New York</HI> Northward into the Countrey, towards the Head of which is seated <HI>New Albany,</HI> a Place of great Trade with the <HI>Indians,</HI> be∣twixt which and <HI>New York,</HI> being above a hundred Miles, is as good Corn-Land as the World affords, enough to entertain hundreds of Families, which in the time of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Government of these Parts could not be setled by reason of the <HI>Indians,</HI> ex∣cepting

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Raritan-Ri∣ver.</NOTE>Westward of <HI>After-skull</HI> River before mention'd, about eighteen or twenty Miles, runs in <HI>Raritan</HI> River Northward into the Countrey some scores of Miles; both sides of which River are adorn'd with spacious Meadows, enough to feed thousands of Cattel: The Wood-Land is very good for Corn, and stor'd with wild Beasts, as Deer, Elks, and an innumerable multitude of Fowl, as in other parts of the Countrey. This River is thought very capable for the erecting of several Towns and Villages on each side of it, no place in the North of <HI>America</HI> having better con∣venience for the maintaining of all sorts of Cattel for Winter and Summer Food.</P>
<P>Upon this River is no Town setled, onely one at the Mouth of it; but next to it, Westward, is a Place call'd <HI>Newasons;</HI> where are two or three Towns and Villages setled upon the Sea-side, but none betwixt that and <HI>Delaware-Bay,</HI> which is about sixty Miles, all which is a rich Champain Countrey, free from Stones, and indiffe∣rent level, having store of excellent good Timber, and very well water'd, having Brooks or Rivers ordinarily, one or more in every Miles travel. This Countrey is peopled onely with wild Beasts, as Deer, Elks, Bears, and other Creatures, so that in a whole days Journey you shall meet with no Inhabitants except a few <HI>Indians,</HI> It is also full of stately Oaks, whose broad-branch'd tops serve for no other use, but to keep off the Suns heat from the wild Beasts of the Wilderness, where is Grass as high as a Man's Middle, which serves for no other end, except to main∣tain the Elks and Deer, who never devour a hundredth part of it, than to be burnt every Spring to make way for new. How many poor People in the World would think themselves happy, had they an Acre or two of Land, whilst here is hundreds, nay thousands of Acres that would invite Inhabitants.</P>

<P>The best Commodities for any to carry with them to this Countrey is Clothing, the Countrey being full of all sorts of Cattel, which they may furnish themselves withal at an easie Rate, for any sort of <HI>English</HI> Goods, as likewise Instruments for Husbandry and Building, with Nails, Hinges, Glass, and the like. They get a Live∣lihood principally by Corn and Cattel, which will there fetch them any Commodi∣ties: Likewise they Sowe store of Flax, which they make every one Cloth of for their own wearing; as also Woollen Cloth, and Linsey-woolsey; and had they more Tradesmen amongst them, they would in a little time live without the help of any other Countrey for their Clothing; for Tradesmen there are none but live happily there, as Carpenters, Blacksmiths, Masons, Taylors, Weavers, Shoemakers, Tanners, Brickmakers, and so any other Trade: Them that have no Trade be∣take themselves to Husbandry, get Land of their own, and live exceeding well.</P>
<P>We shall conclude our Discourse of this Countrey with a notable Character gi∣ven thereof by a late Writer, as to the great advantage of happy living in all re∣spects, for whosoever shall be pleas'd to betake himself thither to live.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chara∣cter of a hap∣py Countrey.</NOTE><Q>IF there be any terrestrial happiness (saith he) to be had by any People, especi∣ally of an inferior rank, it must certainly be here. Here any one may furnish himself with Land, and live Rent-free, yea, with such a quantity of Land, that he may weary himself with walking over his Fields of Corn, and all sorts of Grain, and let his Stock amount to some hundreds; he needs not fear there want of Pasture in the Summer, or Fodder in the Winter, the Woods affording suffici∣ent supply, where you have Grass as high as a Man's Knees, nay, as high as his Waste, interlac'd with Pea-Vines, and other Weeds that Cattel much delight in, as much as a Man can pass through: And these Woods also every Mile or half-Mile are furnish'd with fresh Ponds, Brooks, or Rivers, where all sorts of Cattel, during the heat of the day, do quench their thirst, and cool themselves. These Brooks and Rivers being inviron'd of each side with several sorts of Trees and Grape-Vines, Arbor-like interchanging places, and croding these Rivers, do shade and shelter them from the scorching beams of the Sun. Such as by their utmost Labors can scarcely get a Living, may here procure Inheritances of Lands and Possessions, stock themselves with all sorts of Cattel, enjoy the benefit of them whilst they live, and leave them to their Children when they die. Here you need not trouble the Shambles for Meat, nor Bakers and Brewers for Beer and Bread, nor run to a Linnen-Draper for a supply, every one making their own Linnen, and a great part of their woollen Cloth for their ordinary wearing. And how prodigal (if I may so say) hath Nature been to furnish this Countrey with all sorts of wild Beasts and Fowl, which every one hath an interest in, and may Hunt at his pleasure; where, besides the pleasure in Hunting, he may furnish his House with excellent fat Venison, Turkies, Geese, Heath-hens, Cranes, Swans, Ducks, Pigeons, and the like; and wearied with that, he may go a Fishing, where the Rivers are so furnish'd, that he may supply himself with Fish before he can leave off the Recreation. Here one may travel by Land upon the same Continent hundreds of Miles, and pass through Towns and Villages, and never hear the least complaint for want, nor hear any ask him for a Farthing. Here one may lodge in the Fields and Woods, travel from one end of the Countrey to another, with as much security as if he were lock'd within his own Chamber: And if one chance to meet with an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, they shall give him the best Entertain∣ment they have, and upon his desire direct him on his Way. But that which adds happiness to all the rest, is the healthfulness of the Place, where many Peo∣ple in twenty years time never know what Sickness is; where they look upon it as a great Mortality, if two or three die out of a Town in a years time. Besides the sweetness of the Air, the Countrey it self sends forth such a fragrant smell, that it may be perceiv'd at Sea before they can make the Land: No evil Fog or Vapor doth any sooner appear, but a North-West or Westerly Wind immediately dissolves it, and drives it away. Moreover, you shall scarce see a House, but the South-side is begirt with Hives of Bees, which increase after an incredible man∣ner: So that if there be any terrestrial <HI>Canaan,</HI> 'tis surely here, where the Land floweth with Milk and Honey.</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Efore We proceed to the Description of this Countrey, it will be first requisite to relate the true occasion and means, whereby this part of <HI>America</HI> came to be erected into a Pro∣vince, and call'd <HI>Mary-land.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year of our Lord 1631. <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> ob∣tain'd of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, of <HI>Great Brittain, &amp;c.</HI> a Grant of that part of <HI>America,</HI> (first discover'd by the <HI>English</HI>) which lies between the Degrees of thirty seven and fifty Minutes, or thereabouts, and forty of Northerly Latitude, which is bounded on the South by <HI>Virginia;</HI> on the North, by <HI>New England,</HI> and <HI>New Jersey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The situation.</NOTE> part of <HI>New York,</HI> lying on the East side of <HI>Delaware Bay;</HI> on the East, by the Ocean; and on the West, by that part of the Continent which lies in the Longitude of the first Fountains of the River call'd <HI>Patomeck.</HI></P>
<P>In pursuance of this Grant to his said Lordship, a Bill was prepar'd, and brought to His Majesty to Sign, who first ask'd his Lordship, what he should call it, there being a Blank in the Bill designedly left for the Name, which his Lordship inten∣ded should have been <HI>Crescentia;</HI> but his Lordship leaving it to His Majesty to give it a Name, the King propos'd to have it call'd <HI>Terra-Mariae,</HI> in <HI>English, Mary-land,</HI> in honor of his Queen, whose Name was <HI>Mary;</HI> which was concluded on, and inser∣ted into the Bill, which the King then Sign'd; and thereby the said Tract of Land was erected into a Province by that Name.</P>
<P>His Lordship somewhat delaying the speedy passing of it under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> dy'd in the <HI>interim,</HI> before the said Patent was perfected; whereupon a
<PB N="184" REF="113"/>Patent of the said Province was shortly afterwards pass'd to his Son and Heir, (who was Christen'd by the Name of <HI>Coecil,</HI> but afterwards confirm'd by the Name of <HI>Coecilius,</HI>) the now Lord <HI>Baltemore,</HI> under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> bearing Date <HI>June</HI> 20. 1632. in the eighth Year of His said Majesties Reign, with all Royal Ju∣risdictions and Prerogatives, both Military and Civil in the said Province, as Pow∣er to Enact Laws, Power of pardoning all manner of Offences, Power to confer Honors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be held of His said Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, Kings of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> in common Soccage, as of His Majesties Honor of <HI>Windsor</HI> in the County of <HI>Berks</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> yielding and paying yearly for the same to His Majesty and to His Heirs and Successors for ever, two <HI>Indian</HI> Arrows of those parts, at the Castle of <HI>Windsor</HI> aforesaid, on Tuesday in <HI>Easter</HI> Week, and the fifth part of all Gold and Sil∣ver Oar, which shall happen to be found in the said Province.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bounds.</NOTE><Q> By the said Patent is Granted to his Lorship, his Heirs and Assigns, all that part of a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> lying in the parts of <HI>America,</HI> between the Ocean on the East, and the Bay of <HI>Chesapeack</HI> on the West; and divided from the other part thereof by a right Line drawn from the Promontory, or <HI>Cape</HI> of Land call'd <HI>Watkin's-Point,</HI> situate in the aforesaid Bay, near the River of <HI>Wigcho</HI> on the West, unto the main Ocean on the East, and between that bound on the South, unto that part of <HI>Delaware Bay</HI> on the North, which lies under the fortieth Degree of Northerly Latitude from the Equinoctial, where <HI>New England</HI> ends; and all that Tract of Land between the bounds aforesaid, that is to say, passing from the aforesaid Bay call'd <HI>Delaware Bay,</HI> in a right Line by the Degree aforesaid, unto the true <HI>Meridian</HI> of the first Fountains of the River of <HI>Patomeck;</HI> and from thence stretch∣ing towards the South, unto the furthest Bank of the said River, and following the West and South side thereof, unto a certain place call'd <HI>Cinquack,</HI> near the Mouth of the said River, where it falls into the Bay of <HI>Chesapeack,</HI> and from thence by a streight Line unto the aforesaid Promontory, or place call'd <HI>Watkins-Point,</HI> which lies in thirty seven Degrees and fifty Minutes, or thereabouts, of Northern Latitude.</Q></P>
<P>By this Patent his Lordship and his Heirs and Assigns are Created the true and absolute Lords and Proprietaries of the said Province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Title.</NOTE> saving the Allegiance and Soveraign Dominion due to His Majesty, His Heirs, and Successors; so that he hath thereby a Soveraignty Granted to him and his Heirs, dependant upon the Sover∣eignty of the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Seating.</NOTE>His Lordship, in the Year 1633. sent his second Brother Mr. <HI>Leonard Calvert,</HI> and his third Brother Mr. <HI>George Calvert,</HI> with divers other Gentlemen of Quality, and Servants to the number of two hundred Persons at least, to settle a Plantation there; who set Sail from the <HI>Cowes</HI> in the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> on <HI>Novemb.</HI> 22. in the same Year; having made some stay by the way, at the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>St. Chri∣stophers</HI> in. <HI>America,</HI> they arriv'd at <HI>Point Comfort</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> on <HI>February</HI> 24. following; from whence shortly after they Sail'd up the Bay of <HI>Chesapeack,</HI> and <HI>Patomeck</HI> Ri∣ver: And having review'd the Country, and given Names to several places, they pitch'd upon a Town of the <HI>Indians</HI> for their first Seat, call'd <HI>Yoacomaco,</HI> (now Saint <HI>Maries</HI>) which the then Governor Mr. <HI>Leonard Calvert,</HI> freely Purchas'd of the Na∣tives there, for the Lord Proprietaries use, with Commodities brought from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>That which facilitated the Treaty and Purchase of the said place from the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> was a resolution which those <HI>Indians</HI> had then before taken, to remove higher into the Countrey where it was more Populous, for fear of the <HI>Sansquehanocks,</HI> (another, and more Warlike People of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were their too near Neigh∣bors,
<PB N="185" REF="113"/>and inhabit between the Bays of <HI>Chesapeack</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI>) there being then actual Wars between them, insomuch, that many of them were gone thither before the <HI>English</HI> arriv'd: And it hath been the general practice of his Lordship, and those who were employ'd by him in the Planting of the said Province, rather to purchase the Natives Interest, (who will agree for the same at easie rates) than to take from them by force, that which they seem to call their Right and Inheritance, to the end all Disputes might be remov'd touching the forcible Incroachment upon others, against the Laws of Nature or Nations.</P>
<P>Thus this Province at the vast Charges, and by the unweary'd Industry and en∣deavor of the present Lord <HI>Baltemore,</HI> the now absolute Lord and Proprietary of the same was at first Planted , and hath since been supply'd with People and other Necessaries, so effectually,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> that in this present Year 1671. the number of <HI>English</HI> there amounts to fifteen or twenty thousand Inhabitants, for whose Encourage∣ment there is a Fundamental Law establish'd there by his Lordship, whereby <HI>Li∣berty of Conscience</HI> is allow'd to all that Profess to believe in <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> so that no Man who is a <HI>Christian</HI> is in danger of being disturb'd for his Religion; and all Persons being satisfi'd touching his Lordships Right, as Granted by his Superior So∣veraign, the King of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> and possess'd by the consent and agreement of the first <HI>Indian</HI> Owners, every Person who repaireth thither, intending to become an Inhabitant, finds himself secure, as well in the quiet enjoyment of his Property, as of his Conscience.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Charles Calvert,</HI> his Lordships onely Son and Heir, was in the Year 1661. sent thither by his Lordship to Govern this Province and People, who hath hi∣therto continu'd that Charge of his Lordships Lieutenant there, to the general sa∣tisfaction and encouragement of all Persons under his Government, or otherwise concern'd in the Province.</P>
<P>The precedent Discourse having given you a short Description of this Province from its Infancy to this day, together with an account of his Lordships Patent and Right, by which he holds the same; we will here speak something of the Nature of the Countrey in general, and of the Commodities that are either naturally afforded there, or may be procur'd by Industry.</P>
<P>The Climate is very healthful, and agreeable with <HI>English</HI> Constitutions; but New-comers have most of them heretofore had the first year of their Planting there in <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> a Sickness, which is call'd there <HI>A Seasoning,</HI> but is indeed no other than an Ague, with cold and hot Fits, whereof many heretofore us'd to die for want of good Medicines, and accommodations of Diet and Lodging, and by drinking too much Wine and Strong-waters; though many, even in those times, who were more temperate, and that were better accommodated, never had any <HI>Seasonings</HI> at all; but of late years, since the Countrey hath been more open'd by the cutting down of the Woods, and that there is more plenty of <HI>English</HI> Diet, there are very few die of those Agues, and many have no <HI>Seasonings</HI> at all, especially those that live in the higher parts of the Country, and not near to the Marshes and Salt-water.</P>
<P>In Summer, the heats are equal to those of <HI>Spain,</HI> but qualifi'd daily about Noon, at that time of the Year, either with some gentle Breezes, or small Showres of Rain: In Winter there is Frost and Snow, and sometimes it is extremely cold, insomuch, that the Rivers and the Northerly part of the Bay of <HI>Chesapeack</HI> are Fro∣zen, but it seldom lasts long; and some Winters are so warm, that People have gone in half Shirts and Drawers only at <HI>Christmas:</HI> But in the Spring and Autumn, (<HI>viz.</HI>) in <HI>March, April,</HI> and <HI>May, September, October,</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> there is generally
<PB N="186" REF="114"/>most pleasant temperate Weather: The Winds there are variable, from the South comes Heat, Gusts, and Thunder; from the North or North-West, cold Weather; and in Winter, Frost and Snow; from the East and South-East, Rain.</P>
<P>The Soyl is very fertile, and furnish'd with many pleasant and commodious Rivers, Creeks, and Harbors.</P>
<P>The Country is generally plain and even, and yet distinguish'd with some pret∣ty small Hills and Risings, with variety of Springs and Rivulets: The Woods are for the most part free from Underwood, so that a Man may Travel or Hunt for his Recreation.</P>
<P>The ordinary entrance by Sea into this Country is between two <HI>Capes,</HI> distant each from the other about seven or eight Leagues; the South <HI>Cape</HI> is call'd <HI>Cape Henry;</HI> the North, <HI>Cape Charles;</HI> within the <HI>Capes</HI> you enter into a fair <HI>Bay,</HI> Navi∣gable for at least two hundred Miles, and is call'd <HI>Chesapeack Bay;</HI> stretching it self Northerly through the heart of the Countrey, which adds much to its Fame and Value: Into this Bay fall many stately Rivers, the chief whereof is <HI>Patomeck,</HI> which is Navigable for at least a hundred and forty Miles: The next Northward, is <HI>Pa∣tuxent,</HI> at its entrance distant from the other about twenty Miles, a River yielding great Profit as well as Pleasure to the Inhabitants; and by reason of the Islands and other places of advantage that may Command it, both fit for Habitation and De∣fence: Passing hence to the Head of the Bay, you meet with several pleasant and commodious Rivers, which for brevity we here omit to give any particular ac∣count of: On the Eastern Shore are several commodious Rivers, Harbors, Creeks, and Islands; to the Northward whereof you enter into another fair Bay, call'd <HI>Delaware Bay;</HI> wide at its entrance about eight Leagues, and into which falls a very fair Navigable River.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The natural Commodities of the Coun∣trey.</NOTE>This Countrey yields the Inhabitants many excellent things for Physick and Chyrurgery; they have several Herbs and Roots which are great Preservatives against Poyson, as <HI>Snake-Root,</HI> which presently cures the bitings of the <HI>Rattle-Snake,</HI> which are very Venomous, and are bred in the Countrey; others that cure all manner of Wounds; they have <HI>Saxafras , Sarsaparilla,</HI> Gums and Balsoms, which Experience (the Mother of Art) hath taught them the perfect use of.</P>
<P>An <HI>Indian</HI> seeing one of the <HI>English</HI> much troubled with the Tooth-ach, setch'd a Root out of a Tree, which apply'd to the Tooth, gave ease immediately to the Par∣ty; other Roots they have fit for Dyers, wherewith the <HI>Indians</HI> Paint themselves as <HI>Pacoone</HI> (a deep red,) <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Timber of these parts is good and useful for Building of Houses and Ships, the white Oak for Pipe-staves, the red for Wainscot; there is likewise black Wall-Nut, Cedar, Pine, and Cypress, Chest-nut, Elme, Ash, and Popelar, all which are for Building and Husbandry: Fruit-trees, as Mulberries, <HI>Persimons,</HI> with several kind of Plumbs, and Vines in great abundance.</P>
<P>Of Strawberries there is plenty, which are ripe in <HI>April,</HI> Mulberries in <HI>May,</HI> Ras∣berries in <HI>June,</HI> and the <HI>Maracok,</HI> which is something like a Lemon, is ripe in <HI>August.</HI> In Spring time there are several sorts of Herbs, as Corn-sallet, Violets, Sorrel, Pur∣slane, and others which are of great use to the <HI>English</HI> there.</P>
<P>In the upper parts of the Countrey are <HI>Buffeloes, Elks, Tygers, Bears, Wolves,</HI> and great store of Deer; as also Beavers, Foxes, Otters, Flying-Squirils, <HI>Racoons,</HI> and many other sorts of Beasts.</P>
<P>Of Birds, there is the Eagle, Goshawk, Falcon, <HI>Lanner,</HI> Sparrow-hawk, and <HI>Mar∣lin;</HI> also wild Turkies in great abundance, whereof many weigh fifty Pounds in weight and upwards, and of Partridge great plenty: There are likewise sundry
<PB N="187" REF="114"/>sorts of singing Birds, whereof one is call'd a <HI>Mock Bird,</HI> because it imitates all other Birds; some are red, which sing like Nightingales, but much louder; others black and yellow, which last sort excels more in Beauty than tune, and is by the <HI>English</HI> there call'd the <HI>Baltemore-Bird,</HI> because the Colours of his Lordships Coat of Arms are black and yellow: Others there are that resemble most of the Birds in <HI>England,</HI> but not of the same kind, for which we have no names: In Winter there are great plenty of Swans, Cranes, Geese, Herons, Duck, Teal, Widgeons, Brants, and Pidgeons, with other sorts, whereof there are none in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea, the Bays of <HI>Chesapeack</HI> and <HI>Delaware,</HI> and generally all the Rivers, do abound with Fish of several sorts; as Whales, Sturgeon, Thorn-back, Grampuses, Porpuses, Mullets, Trouts, Soules, Plaice, Mackrel, Perch, Eels, Roach, Shadd, Herrings, Crabs, Oysters, Cockles, Mussels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but above all these, the Fish where∣of there are none in <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Drums, Sheeps-head, Cat-fish, &amp;c.</HI> are best, except Stur∣geon, which are there found in great abundance, not inferior to any in <HI>Europe</HI> for largeness and goodness.</P>
<P>The Minerals may in time prove of very great consequence, though no rich Mines are yet discover'd there; but there is Oar of several sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> of Tin, Iron, and Copper, whereof several trials have been made by curious Persons there with good success.</P>
<P>The Soyl is generally very rich, the Mould in many places black and rank, in∣somuch, that it is necessary to Plant it first with <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, Tobacco, or Hemp, before it is fit for <HI>English</HI> Grain; under that is found good <HI>Loam,</HI> whereof has been made as good Brick as any in <HI>Europe:</HI> There are store of Marsh-grounds for Mea∣dows; great plenty of Marle, both blue and white; excellent Clay for Pots and Tiles: To conclude, there is nothing that can be reasonably expected, in a place lying in the same Latitude with this, but what is either there found naturally, or may be procur'd by Industry, as Oranges, Lemons, and Olives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodities which are, or may be pro∣cur'd by in∣dustry.</NOTE>We need not here mention <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, (call'd <HI>Mayz</HI>) Pease and Beans of several sorts, being the peculiar products Planted by the <HI>Indians</HI> of that part of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>All sorts of <HI>English</HI> Grain are now common there, and yield a great encrease; as Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats, Pease, Beans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> good Beer of Wheat or Barley Malt, after the <HI>English</HI> Mode, is made, even in the meanest Families there; Some drink Beer of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, others of the Stalks thereof, or of the Chipps of the <HI>Pockykerry</HI>-Tree, all which make a fort of fresh and pleasant Drink; but the general Diet of the Country is now <HI>English,</HI> as most agreeable to their Constitutions.</P>
<P>There are few able Planters there at present, but what are plentifully supply'd with all sorts of Summer and Winter Fruits. as also of Roots and Herbs, of all sorts out of their Gardens and Orchards, which they have Planted for their Profit as well as Pleasure: They have Pears, Apples, Plumbs, Peaches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in great abun∣dance, and as good as those of <HI>Italy;</HI> so are their Mellons, Pumpions, Apricocks, Cherries, Figgs, Pomegranates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In fine, there is scarce any Fruit or Root that grows in <HI>England, France, Spain,</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> but hath been try'd there, and prospers well.</P>
<P>You may have there also Hemp, Flax, Pitch, and Tar, with little labor; the Soyl is apt for Hops, Rape-seed, Annice-seed, Woad, Madder, Saffron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there may be had Silk-worms, the Country being stor'd with Mulberry-trees, and the su∣perfluity of the Wood will produce Pot-ashes.</P>
<P>There is a great quantity of Syder made there at present, and as good as in any other Countrey; good Perry and Quince-drink is there likewise made in great plenty: The Ground doth naturally bring forth Vines in great quantities, the quali∣ty
<PB N="188" REF="115"/>whereof being something corrected by Industry, (as there have been several trials thereof already made there) may no doubt produce good Wine, to the great en∣couragement and advantage of the Undertakers.</P>
<P>Brave Ships may be built there with little charge, Clab-board, Wainscot, Pipe∣staves, and Masts for Ships, the Woods will afford plentifully; some small Ves∣sels have been already built there: In fine, Beef, Furrs, Hides, Butter, Cheese, Pork, and Bacon, to Transport to other Countreys, are no small Commodities, which by Industry, are, and may be had there in great plenty, the <HI>English</HI> being al∣ready plentifully stock'd with all sorts of Cattel and Horses; and were there no other Staple-Commodities to be hop'd for, but Silk and Linnen (the materials of which apparently will grow there) it were sufficient to enrich the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>But the general Trade of <HI>Mary-land</HI> at present depends chiefly upon Tobacco, it being the Planters greatest concern and study to store himself betimes with that Commodity, wherewith he buys and sells, and after which Standard all other Commodities receive their Price there; they have of late vented such quantities of that and other Commodities, that a hundred Sail of Ships from <HI>England, Barbadoes,</HI> and other <HI>English</HI> Plantations, have been usually known to Trade thither in one Year; insomuch, that by Custom and Excize paid in <HI>England</HI> for Tobacco and other Commodities Imported from thence, <HI>Mary-land</HI> alone at this present, hath by his Lordships vast Expence, Industry, and Hazard for many years, without any charge to the Crown, improv'd His Majesties, the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Revenues, to the value of Forty thousand Pounds <HI>Sterl. per annum</HI> at least.</P>
<P>The general way of Traffick and Commerce there is chiefly by Barter, or Ex∣change of one Commodity for another; yet there wants not, besides <HI>English</HI> and other foraign Coyns, some of his Lordships own Coyn, as Groats, Sixpences, and Shillings, which his Lordship at his own Charge caus'd to be Coyn'd and dispers'd throughout that Province; 'tis equal in fineness of Silver to <HI>English Sterling,</HI> being of the same Standard, but of somewhat less weight, and hath on the one side his Lordships Coat of Arms stamp'd, with this Motto circumscrib'd, <HI>Crescite &amp; Mal∣tiplicamini,</HI> and on the other side his Lordships Effigies, circumscrib'd thus, <HI>Caecilius Dominus Terrae-Mariae,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>His Lordship, or his Lieutenant there for the time being, upon due occasion, Convenes, Prorogues, and Dissolves this Assembly; but whatsoever is by his Lordships Lieutenant there, with the consent of both the said Estates Enacted, is there of the same Force and Nature as an Act of Parliament is in <HI>England,</HI> until his Lordship declares his dis-assent; but such Laws as his Lordship doth assent unto, are not afterwards to be Alter'd or Repeal'd but by his Lordship, with the consent of both the said Estates.</P>
<P>Their chief Court of Judicature is held at St. <HI>Maries</HI> Quarterly every Year, to which all Persons concern'd resort for Justice, and is call'd <HI>The Provincial Court,</HI> whereof the Governor and Councilare Judges: To the Court there doth belong se∣veral sworn Attorneys, who constantly are present there, and act both as Barristers and Attorneys; there are likewise chief Clerks, Bayliffs, and other Officers, which duly attend the Court in their respective places.</P>
<P>The Province is divided at present, so far as it is inhabited by <HI>English,</HI> into Counties, whereof there be ten, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>Maries, Charles, Calvert, Anne Arandel,</HI> and <HI>Baltemore</HI> Counties, which first five lie on the West side of the Bay of <HI>Chesapeack;</HI> on the Eastern side whereof, commonly call'd <HI>The Eastern-Shore,</HI> lies <HI>Sommerset, Dorche∣ster, Talbot, Caecil,</HI> and <HI>Kent Counties,</HI> which last is an Island lying near the Eastern∣shore of the said Bay.</P>
<P>Besides the Provincial Court aforenam'd, there are other inferior Courts, ap∣pointed to be held in every one of the Counties six times in the year, for the dis∣patch of all Causes, not relating to Life or Member, and not exceeding the value of three thousand weight of Tobacco; the decision of all other Causes being re∣serv'd to the Provincial or higher Court before-mention'd, and there lies Appeals from the County-Courts, to the Provincial Court.</P>
<P>There are Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers appointed by the Lord and Proprietary, or his Lordships Lieutenant for the time being, in the said respective Counties; and without four Justices, of which one to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> none of the said respective County-Courts can be held; any of his Lordships Privy Council may sit as Judge, in any of the said County-Courts, by vertue of his place.</P>
<P>These Courts are appointed to be held at convenient Houses in the said Coun∣ties, which commonly are not far distant from some Inn, or other House of Enter∣tainment, for accommodation of Strangers; one of the said six County Courts in each County is held for settling of Widows and Orphans Estates.</P>
<P>There are Foundations laid of Towns, more or less in each County, according to his Lordships Proclamation, to that effect Issu'd forth in the year 1668.

<PB N="190" REF="116"/>the situation is proper, for that it commands the breadth of the said River of Saint <HI>Georges;</HI> so that when it is finish'd, all Shipping may safely Ride before the Town, without the least fear of any sudden Assault, or Attempt of Pirats or other Enemy whatsoever. This City has formerly been the usual place of abode for his Lord∣ships Lieutenants, and their Retinue; but of late years the present Governor, Mr. <HI>Charles Calvert,</HI> hath built himself a fair House of Brick and Timber, with all Out-houses, and other Offices thereto belonging, at a place call'd <HI>Mattapany,</HI> near the River of <HI>Patuxent</HI> before-mention'd, where he and his Family reside, being a pleasant, healthful, and commodious Seat, about eight Miles by Land distant from St. <HI>Maries.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> in <HI>Mary∣land.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Mary-land</HI> ate a People generally of streight, able, and well pro∣portion'd Bodies, something exceeding the ordinary pitch of the <HI>English,</HI> their Com∣plexion Swarthy, their Hair naturally long and black, without Curle, which ge∣nerally they cut after some strange Fantastical Mode; nay, sometimes they Dye it with red and other preposterous Colours: They Liquor their Skins with Bears Grease, and other Oyls, which renders them more tawny, and less apt to receive injury from the Weather: They are subtile from their Infancy, and prone to learn any thing their Fancy inclines them to, in other things slothful.</P>
<P>There are as many distinct Nations among them as there are <HI>Indian</HI> Towns, (which are like Countrey-Villages in <HI>England,</HI> but not so good Houses) dispers'd throughout the Province: Each Town hath its King (by them term'd <HI>Werowance</HI>) and every forty or fifty Miles distance differs much from its Neighbors in Speech and Disposition: The <HI>Sasquahanocks,</HI> though but few in number, yet much exceed the rest in Valor , and Fidelity to the <HI>English;</HI> the rest being generally of a more Treacherous Spirit, and not so stout, and the number of the <HI>English</HI> do already ex∣ceed all the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Province.</P>
<P>The <HI>Werowance</HI> is assisted by Councellors, call'd <HI>Wisoes,</HI> who are commonly of the same Family, and are chosen at the pleasure of the <HI>Werowance:</HI> They have Cap∣tains in time of War which they term <HI>Cockorooses.</HI></P>
<P>Most of their Governments are Monarchical, (except the <HI>Sasquabanocks,</HI> which is a Re-publick) but for succession they have a peculiar Custom, that the Issue of the Males never succeed, but the Issue-Male of the Female succeed in Government, as the surer side: They all submit to, and are protected by the Lord Proprietaries Government; and in case of any Assault or Murder, committed on any <HI>English,</HI> the Party offending is try'd by the Laws of the Province; and in case of any new Ele∣ction of King or Emperor among them, they present the Person so Elected to the Governor for the time being, who as he sees cause, either alters or confirms their Choice.</P>
<P>In the Year 1663. at the <HI>Indians</HI> Request, the present Governor Mr. <HI>Charles Calvert,</HI> and some others of his Lordships Privy-Council there, went to <HI>Pascatoway,</HI> in this Province, to be present at the Election of a new Emperor for that Nation: They presented a Youth nam'd <HI>Nattawasso,</HI> and humbly Requested to have him confirm'd Emperor of <HI>Pascatoway,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Wahocasso;</HI> which after some charge given them in general, to be good and faithful Subjects to him, the Governor according∣ly did, and receiv'd him into his Protection.</P>
<P>They pay great Respect and Obedience to their Kings and Superiors, whose Commands they immediately Execute, though with an apparent hazard of their Lives.</P>
<P>The Mens chief employment is Hunting, and the Wars, in both which they commonly use Bowes and Arrows; some of late have Guns and other Weapons, by a private Trade with some <HI>English</HI> Neighboring Plantations: They are excel∣lent
<PB N="191" REF="116"/>Marks-men, it being the onely thing they breed their Youth to: The Women Plant and look after the Corn, make their Bread, and dress what Provisions their Husbands bring home. Their way of Marriage is by agreement with the Womens Parents or Friends, who for a certain Sum of their Money, or other Goods, deliver her to the Man at a day appointed, which is commonly spent in jollity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Money.</NOTE>There are two sorts of <HI>Indian</HI> Money, <HI>Wampompeage</HI> and <HI>Roanoack,</HI> these serve among them as Gold and Silver do in <HI>Europe,</HI> both are made of Fish-shells, which they string like Beads; <HI>Wampompeage</HI> is the largest Bead, sixty whereof countervails an Arms length of <HI>Roanoack,</HI> which is valued at six Pence <HI>Sterling;</HI> with this they purchase Commodities of the <HI>English,</HI> as Trading-Cloth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which they make themselves Mantles, which is something shaggy, and is call'd <HI>Dutch Duffels;</HI> this is their Winter Habit; in Summer they onely wear a narrow slip of the same to cover those parts, which natural modesty teaches them to conceal; the better sort have Stockings made thereof, and pieces of Deer-Skin, stitch'd together about their Feet in stead of Shooes: The Womens Apparel is the same, but those of the best Quality among them bedeck themselves with <HI>Wampompeage</HI> or <HI>Roanoack,</HI> or some other toy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of habitation.</NOTE>Their Houses are rais'd about the height of a large Arbor, and cover'd with Barks of Trees very tite, in the middle whereof is the Fire-place, they lie generally upon Mats of their own making, plac'd round the Fire, a Woodden-bowl or two, an Earthen Pot, and a Mortar and Pestle, is their chiefest Houshold-stuff; he that hath his Bowe and Arrows, or Gun, a Hatchet, and a <HI>Canoo,</HI> (a term they use for Boats) is in their minds rarely well provided for; each House contains a distinct Family, each Family hath its peculiar Field about the Town, where they Plant their Corn, and other sorts of Grain afore-mention'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civility to the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE>They are courteous to the <HI>English,</HI> if they chance to see any of them coming to∣wards their Houses, they immediately meet him half-way, conduct him in, and bid him welcome with the best Cates they have: The <HI>English</HI> giving them in like manner civil Entertainment, according to their Quality.</P>
<P>The <HI>Werowance</HI> of <HI>Patuxent</HI> having been Treated for some days at St. <HI>Maries,</HI> by the then Governor, Mr. <HI>Leonard Calvert,</HI> his Lordships Brother, at his first coming thither to settle that Colony, took his leave of him with this Expression, <HI>I love the</HI> English <HI>so well, that if they should go about to kill me, if I had so much breath as to speak, I would Command my People not to revenge my death; for I know they would not do such a thing, except it were through my own default.</HI></P>
<P>In Affairs of concern, they are very considerate, and use few words in declaring their intentions; for at Mr. <HI>Leonard Calverts</HI> first arrival there, the <HI>Werowance</HI> of <HI>Pas∣catoway</HI> being ask'd by him, <HI>Whether he would be content, that the</HI> English <HI>should fit down in his Countrey?</HI> return'd this answer, <HI>That he would not bid him go, neither would he bid him stay, but that he might use his own discretion.</HI> These were their expressions to the Governor at his first entrance into <HI>Mary-land,</HI> whom then they were jealous of, whether he might prove a Friend or a Neighbor, but by his discreet Demeanor to∣wards them at first, and friendly usage of them afterwards, they are now become, not only civil, but serviceable to the <HI>English</HI> there upon all occasions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of the Eastern shore are most numerous, and were formerly very re∣fractory, whom Mr. <HI>Leonard Calvert</HI> some few years after his first settling the Colo∣ny, was forc'd to reduce, and of late the Emperor of <HI>Nanticoke,</HI> and his Men were deservedly defeated by the present Governor, Mr. <HI>Charles Calvert,</HI> who reduc'd him about the year 1668. which has since tam'd the ruder sort of the neighboring <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> who now by experience, find it better to submit and be protected by the Lord
<PB N="192" REF="117"/>Proprietaries Government, than to make any vain attempt against his Power.</P>
<P>These People live under no Law, but that of Nature and Reason, which not∣withstanding leads them to the acknowledgement of a Deity, whom they own to be the Giver of all good things, wherewith their Life is maintain'd, and to him they Sacrifice the first Fruits of the Earth, and of that which they acquire by Hunt∣ing and Fishing: The Sacrifice is perform'd by their Priests, who are commonly ancient Men, and profess themselves Conjurers; they first make a Speech to their God, then burn part, and eat and distribute the rest among them that are present; until this Ceremony be ended, they will not touch one bit thereof; they hold the Immortality of the Soul, and that there is a place of Joy, and another of Torment after Death, prepar'd for every one according to their Merits.</P>
<P>They bury their Dead with strange expressions of Sorrow (the better sort upon a Scaffold, erected for that end) whom they leave cover'd with Mats, and return when his flesh is consum'd to Interr his Bones; the common sort are committed to the Earth without that Ceremony; but they never omit to bury some part of their Wealth, Arms, and Houshold-stuff with the Corps.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> and his Associates, in the year 1586. sent a Ship to relieve that Colony, which had deserted the Countrey some while before, and were all re∣turn'd for <HI>England</HI> as is before-mention'd.</P>
<P>Some few days after they were gone, Sir <HI>Rirchard Greenvil,</HI> with three Ships, ar∣riv'd at the Plantation at <HI>Roanoack,</HI> which he found deserted, and leaving fifty Men there to keep Possession of that Countrey, return'd for <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>In the Year 1605. the Right Honorable <HI>Thomas Arundel</HI> the first, Baron of <HI>Warder,</HI> and Count of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, set out Captain <HI>George Waymouth,</HI> with twenty nine Sea-men, and necessary Provisions, to make what Discoveries he could; who by contrary Winds, fell Northward about one and forty Degrees and twenty Mi∣nutes of Northerly Latitude, where they found plenty of good Fish; and Sailing further, discover'd an Island, where they nam'd a Harbor, <HI>Pentecost-Harbor;</HI> and on <HI>July</HI> 18. following, came back for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1606. by the sollicitation of Captain <HI>Gosnol,</HI> and several Gentlemen, a Commission was granted by King <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Great Brittain, &amp;c.</HI> for establishing a Council, to direct those new Discoveries; Captain <HI>Newport</HI> (a well practic'd Mar∣riner) was intrusted with the Transportation of the Adventurers in two Ships,
<PB N="194" REF="120"/>and a Pinace, who on <HI>Decemb.</HI> 19. 1606. set Sail from <HI>Black-wall,</HI> and were by Storm, contrary to expectation, cast upon the first Land, which they call'd <HI>Cape Henry,</HI> at the Mouth of the Bay of <HI>Chesapeack,</HI> lying in thirty seven Degrees, or thereabouts, of Northerly Latitude: Here their Orders were open'd and read, and eight declar'd of the Council, and impower'd to chose a President for a year, who with the Council should Govern that Colony: Till <HI>May</HI> 13. they sought a place to Plant in, Mr. <HI>Winkfield</HI> was chose the first President, who caus'd a Fort to be rais'd at <HI>Powhatan,</HI> now call'd <HI>James-Town:</HI> In <HI>June</HI> following, Captain <HI>Newport</HI> re∣turn'd for <HI>England,</HI> leaving a hundred Men behind him; since which time they have been sufficiently supply'd from <HI>England,</HI> and by the indefatigable Industry and Cou∣rage of Captain <HI>John Smith,</HI> (one of the Council at that time, and afterward Presi∣dent of the Colony) they made several Discoveries on the Eastern shore, and up to the Head of the Bay of <HI>Chesapeack,</HI> and of the principal Rivers which fall into the said Bay.</P>
<P><HI>Virginia</HI> being thus Discover'd and Planted, King <HI>James</HI> by his Letters Patent bearing Date <HI>April</HI> 10. in the fourth year of his Reign, 1607. Granted Licence to Sir <HI>Thomas Gates,</HI> Sir <HI>George Summers,</HI> and others, to divide themselves into two se∣veral Colonies, for the more speedy Planting of that Countrey, then call'd <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI> between the Degrees of thirty four and forty five of North Latitude, that is to say, taken in that large extent, mention'd in the beginning: The first Colony to be undertaken by certain Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants, in, and about the City of <HI>London:</HI> The second to be undertaken, and advanc'd by certain Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants, and their Associates, in, or about the City of <HI>Bristol, Exon, Plymouth,</HI> and other parts.</P>
<P>At the first Colonies Request, in the seventh year of the same King, a second Patent was Granted to several Noblemen and Gentlemen, (including Sir <HI>Thomas Gates,</HI> and some of his former Fellow-Patentees) bearing Date <HI>May</HI> 23. 1610. where∣by they were made a Corporation, and Body Politique, and stil'd, <HI>The Treasurer, and Company of Adventurers and Planters of the City of</HI> London, <HI>for the first Colony of</HI> Vir∣ginia: And by this Patent, there was Granted to them, their Successors and As∣signs, two hundred Miles to the Southward, from a <HI>Cape</HI> of Land in <HI>Virginia,</HI> call'd <HI>Point Comfort;</HI> and two hundred Miles to the Northward of the said <HI>Cape,</HI> along the Sea-shore, and into the Land from Sea to Sea.</P>
<P>And on <HI>March</HI> 12. 1612. the said King, in the ninth year of his Reign, Grants them a third Patent, of all Islands lying in the Sea, within two hundred Miles of the Shore of that Tract of Land on the Continent, granted to them by the said for∣mer Patent, <HI>Jac.</HI> 7.</P>
<P>In the Year 1615. Captain <HI>Smith</HI> procur'd by his Interest at Court, and the King's Favor, a Recommendation from His Majesty, and divers of the Nobility, to all Cities and Corporations, to Adventure in a standing Lottery, which was erected for the benefit of this Plantation, which was contriv'd in such a manner, that of 100000. Pounds which was to be put in, 50000. onely, or one half was to return to the Adventurers, according as the Prizes fell out; and the other half to be dispos'd of for the Promotion of the Affairs of <HI>Virginia,</HI> in which, though it were three years before it was fully accomplish'd, he had in the end no bad Success.</P>
<P>In the eighteenth Year of the said King's Reign, at the Request of the second Colony, a Patent was Granted to several Noblemen and Gentlemen, of all that Tract of Land lying in the parts of <HI>America,</HI> between the Degrees of forty and for∣ty eight of Northerly Latitude, and into the Land from Sea to Sea, which was call'd by the Patent <HI>New England in America:</HI> For the better Government whereof,

<P>This Countrey affordeth generally all such Roots, Herbs, Gums, and Balsoms, as are express'd before in the Relation of <HI>Mary-land.</HI></P>
<P>All sorts of Trees for Building and Husbandry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees.</NOTE> Fruit-Trees; Vines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are found in both Countreys, equal in goodness and quantity, onely in such things as require more Sun, and that may be produc'd by Industry) there may be some little difference, because <HI>Virginia</HI> is somewhat more to the Southward of <HI>Mary-land,</HI> as in Vines, Oranges, Lemmons, Olives, Silk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Plant grows naturally in this Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Silk-Grass.</NOTE> and in <HI>Mary-land,</HI> call'd <HI>Silk-Grass,</HI> which will make a fine Stuff with a silky Gloss, and better Cordage than Hemp or Flax, both for strength and durance.</P>
<P>The wild Beasts, Birds, and Fish, are much the same also in this Countrey as are before describ'd in the precedent Description of <HI>Mary-land:</HI> Nevertheless we shall think it proper not to omit some Fruits, Plants, Beasts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mention'd by the most authentick Describers of <HI>New England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits pecu∣liar to <HI>Vir∣ginia.</HI></NOTE> as peculiar to that Countrey.

<P>They have been much oblig'd by that worthy Gentleman Mr. <HI>Edward Digges,</HI> Son of Sir <HI>Dudley Digges,</HI> who was Master of the Rolls, and a Privy Councellor to King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, of <HI>Great Brittain, &amp;c.</HI> For the said Mr. <HI>Digges</HI> at his great Charge and Industry, hath very much advanc'd the making of Silk in this Coun∣trey, for which purpose he hath sent for several Persons out of <HI>Armenia</HI> to teach them that Art, and how to wind it off the Cods of the Silk-Worms; and hath made at his own Plantation in this Colony for some years last past, considerable quantities of Silk, which is found to be as good Silk as any is in the World, which hath encourag'd divers others to prosecute that Work.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣modities of <HI>Virginia.</HI></NOTE>Though this Countrey be capable of producing many other good Commodities, yet the Planters have hitherto imploy'd themselves for the most part in Planting of Tobacco, as they do in <HI>Mary-land;</HI> whereof there are two sorts, one which is call'd <HI>Sweet-scented,</HI> and the other call'd <HI>Oranoack,</HI> or <HI>Bright and Large,</HI> which is much more in quantity, but of lesser Price than the former; and the Plantations upon <HI>York River</HI> are esteem'd to produce the best of that sort of <HI>Sweet-scented:</HI> There is so much of this Commodity Planted in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and Imported from thence into <HI>England,</HI> that the Custom and Excize paid in <HI>England</HI> for it, yields the King about fifty or threescore thousand Pounds <HI>Sterling, per annum:</HI> With this Commodity the Planter buys of the Ships that come thither for it (which are above a hundred Sail yearly from <HI>England,</HI> and other <HI>English</HI> Plantations) all Necessaries of Clothing, and other Utensils of Houshold-stuff, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they want, though they make some Shoes, and Linnen and Woollen Cloth in some parts of <HI>Virginia,</HI> of the growth and Manufacture of the Countrey; and if they would Plant less Tobacco (as it is probable they will e're long find it convenient for them to do, it being now grown a Drug of very low value, by reason of the vast quantities Planted of it) they might in a little time provide themselves of all Necessaries of Livelyhood, and pro∣duce much richer and more Staple-Commodities for their advantage.</P>
<P>Their usual way of Traffique in buying and selling is by exchange of one Com∣modity for another; and Tobacco is the general Standard, by which all other Commodities receive their value; but they have some <HI>English</HI> and foreign Coyns, which serve them upon many occasions.</P>
<P>The Government is by a Governor and Council, Appointed and Authoriz'd from time to time by immediate Commission from the King of <HI>Great Brittain:</HI> And
<PB N="198" REF="122"/>Laws are made by the Governor, with the consent of a General Assembly, which consists of two Houses, an Upper and a Lower; the first consists of the Council, and the latter of the Burgesses chosen by the Freemen of the Countrey; and Laws so made are in Force there till His Majesty thinks fit to alter them.</P>
<P>The Chief Court of Judicature is call'd <HI>The Quarter-Court,</HI> because it is held eve∣ry quarter of a Year, where all Causes Criminal and Civil are heard and deter∣min'd, and the Judges of this Court are the Governor and Council: The present Governor in this Year 1671. is Sir <HI>William Berkley,</HI> who was made Governor by King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> &amp;c. in the Year 1640.

<P>That part of the Countrey where the <HI>English</HI> are Planted, is divided into nine∣teen Counties, <HI>viz.

<P>In every one of these Counties there are inferior County-Courts kept every Moneth; these take no Cognizance of Causes relating to Life or Member, or ex∣ceeding a certain limited Value, such being refer'd to the Quarter-Courts only, to which likewise there lie Appeals from their Inferior Courts.</P>
<P>There are Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers in every respective County, appointed by the Governor, for the Administration of Justice, who sit there according to his Order, and whereof these County-Courts are chiefly compos'd.</P>
<P>There are few Towns as yet erected in this Colony; the Principal Seat of the <HI>English</HI> there, is at a place call'd <HI>James-City,</HI> in Honor of King <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Great Brit∣tain,</HI> &amp;c. This is situated in a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> on the North side of <HI>James-River,</HI> and has in it many fair Brick and other good Houses: In this place are held the Quarter-Courts, General Assemblies, the Secretary's Office, and all other Affairs and greatest Concerns of the Colony are here dispatch'd. On the same side, nearer the Mouth of this River, stands <HI>Elizabeth-City,</HI> containing also several good Houses of Brick and Timber.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Berkley,</HI> the present Governor resides at a place somewhat distant from <HI>James-City,</HI> call'd <HI>Green-Spring,</HI> a fair Brick House, which he himself caus'd to be built.</P>

<P>After the Company left upon <HI>Virginia</HI> by Sir <HI>Richard Greenwill,</HI> (for he himself was return'd) tir'd out with hunger, hardship, and the many extremities they were at last reduc'd to, had deserted the Place, and obtain'd Passage for <HI>England,</HI> through the civility of Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> pitying their distress, fifty Men more were Landed upon <HI>Roanoack-Isle</HI> by the same Person, who how they were surpris'd and destroy'd by the Natives, was discover'd at large to the Supply that was sent over in the Year 1587. by Mr. <HI>White.</HI></P>

<P>A Party of those that went over with Captain <HI>Bartholomew Gosnol,</HI> Captain <HI>John Smith,</HI> &amp;c. were by the <HI>Indians</HI> set upon as they were raising a Fort near <HI>Cape Henry,</HI> where they Landed, seventeen Men hurt, one slain, and all in danger to have been utterly destroy'd, had not a Shot happily made from the Ships by chance frighted away the Salvages. Another small Party under Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> going down the River to <HI>Keconghean,</HI> were very fiercely assaulted by sixty or seventy <HI>Indians,</HI> but their Musquet-shot did such Execution amongst them, that they fled into the Woods and left behind them the Image of their God, which had been carried before them as their Standard, and not long after sent one of their <HI>Queiongcasocks</HI> to offer Peace, and to redeem their <HI>Okee;</HI> which <HI>Smith</HI> granting, on condition six onely of them would come unarm'd and load his Boat with Provisions; and promising moreover to become their Friend, and furnish them with Beads, Copper, and Hatchets: They accepted the Condition, and brought him Venison, Turkies, wild Fowl, Bread, and what else they had, Singing and Dancing in sign of Friendship till they de∣parted. In his Return he discover'd the Town and Countrey of <HI>Warraskayock,</HI> and the People of <HI>Chickahamania.</HI></P>
<P>In his next Voyage for the discovery of the Head of <HI>Chickamahania</HI> River, he was, through neglect of his Sea-men who were sent to watch the Booty, taken Prisoner; in which condition he was kept a whole Moneth: then being released, he got Pro∣visions for the People in <HI>James-Town;</HI> which had they not timely receiv'd, they had all abandon'd the Place, and return'd to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>While Affairs stood thus in a mean condition, Captain <HI>Newport</HI> arriving there with a Ship and sixty Men to strengthen the Plantations, he went to <HI>Weromocomoco,</HI> where King <HI>Powhatan</HI> kept his Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Powha∣tan.</HI></NOTE> and found him sitting on a Bed of Mats, and an Embroider'd Leather Cushion, Cloth'd in Deer-skins; at his Feet fat a young Maiden, and on each side of the House twenty Concubines; his Head and Shoul∣ders were painted red, and a Chain of white Beads hung about his Neck. <HI>Newport,</HI> to oblige him, gave him an <HI>English</HI> Youth; in requital whereof he receiv'd <HI>Powha∣tan</HI>'s bosom Friend, <HI>Mamontak;</HI> with whom returning, he found a sad Accident,
<PB N="201" REF="123"/>for the Fire had not onely burnt the Houses of the new Planters, but also the Pal∣lisado's about <HI>James-Town,</HI> made for a Defence against the Enemies Assaults,<NOTE PLACE="marg">James-Town <HI>burnt.</HI></NOTE> and most of their Store; which was so much the worse, because it hapned in the Winter, and indeed had prov'd very fatal, had not a Ship, which was suppos'd to be lost, happily arriv'd there with a considerable quantity of Provisions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Smith's <HI>Voy∣age.</HI></NOTE>Whilst the Town was rebuilding, <HI>Smith</HI> set Sail in an open Barque with fourteen Men, and discover'd two Isles before <HI>Point Charles,</HI> to which he gave his Name; then ran into the Inlet <HI>Chesapeack,</HI> in the midst of which lay several Islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His remark∣able Ex∣ploits.</NOTE> by the Sea-men call'd <HI>Russels.</HI> Before the River <HI>Wighcomoco</HI> they found a disturbed Sea, and more Northerly a Bay with fresh and hot Water, and at last he met with two <HI>Virgi∣nians,</HI> which conducted the <HI>English</HI> along a Creek to <HI>Onawmoment,</HI> where some hun∣dreds of them lay in Ambuscade, according to <HI>Powhatan</HI>'s appointment, to cut off <HI>Smith;</HI> who leaping forth on a Hidden appear'd like Devils, all painted but the Bullets flying about made them all run away. <HI>Smith,</HI> whose Design was onely to dis∣cover the Countrey, and the Silver Mine of <HI>Patawomeck,</HI> ten Leagues up into the Countrey, found the Metal to be of little value, so that he return'd with little Suc∣cess, being newly cur'd of a poysonous Wound in the Arm, which was given him by a Fish not unlike a Shark, whilst he lay aground near <HI>Toppahanock.</HI></P>
<P>A while after being inform'd of <HI>Powhatan</HI>'s Design to destroy the <HI>English,</HI> (though he had been lately Presented by <HI>Newport</HI> with a Silver Basin, a rich Chair, Bed, and Furniture belonging to it, with other things of value) he, to prevent him, chose forty eight out of two hundred Men which were Garrison'd in <HI>James-Town,</HI> then going to <HI>Werowocomoco,</HI> Landed with much trouble, the River being frozen above half a Mile from the Shore.</P>
<P>A <HI>German</HI> Soldier amongst <HI>Smith</HI>'s Company giving private notice to <HI>Powhatan</HI> of the Design of the <HI>English,</HI> made his Escape by flight: But <HI>Smith</HI> going on to <HI>Pamaunke,</HI> found King <HI>Opechancangough</HI> with seven hundred Men in Arms, threat∣ning a fierce Battel; but <HI>Smith</HI> making directly up to him, set his Pistol on his Breast, and forc'd him to lay down his Arms. <HI>Powhatan</HI> by this time provided with Swords and Musquets by two <HI>Dutch</HI>-men, also began to bestir himself afresh; but his Intentions being too soon known, he was again quieted, and forc'd a second time to send <HI>Smith</HI> a String of Pearl; after which a Peace was concluded between all the Natives and the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Many other Quarrels and Encounters there were in the Infancy of the Planta∣tion between the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>English,</HI> wherein it would be endless to recount all the Treacheries and Ambuscades of the Salvages, some of which had prov'd very pernicious to the Planters, had they not been betray'd to Captain <HI>Smith</HI> by <HI>Poca∣honta,</HI> King <HI>Powhatan</HI>'s Daughter, who upon all occasions shew'd her self a great Friend to the <HI>English,</HI> having sav'd the Captain's Life, when, being her Father's Pri∣soner, he was just brought to Execution.</P>
<P>This Lady was afterwards brought into <HI>England,</HI> Christned by the Name of <HI>Rebekah,</HI> and Married to one Mr. <HI>Rolf,</HI> and died at <HI>Gravesend</HI> in an intended Voy∣age back to her own Countrey.</P>
<P>Nor did their Cruelties and Treacheries end when the Plantation came to be more setled, for on the two and twentieth of <HI>March</HI> about the Year 1621. in the time of Sir <HI>Francis Wyat</HI>'s Government, they generally combin'd to destroy all the <HI>English</HI> there; and carried on this devilish Design with such dissimulation and dex∣terity, that in one day they cut off seven hundred Men, Women, and Children, there being at that time not above fifteen hundred in the Countrey.</P>
<P>Since which time, in the Year of our Lord 1643. there hapned another bloody
<PB N="202" REF="124"/>Massacre, wherein near five hundred <HI>English</HI> were in one Night miserably butcher'd by those barbarous and perfidious Salvages: whose Blood the present Governor, Sir <HI>William Berkley,</HI> nobly and justly reveng'd the Year following, utterly destroying most of them, and taking Prisoner their chief Emperor, <HI>Opichancono,</HI> who died not long after in Prison.</P>
<P>Having given but a small hint, in its proper place, of the Story of Captain <HI>Smith</HI>'s Imprisonment by <HI>Powhatan,</HI> and his deliverance from Death by <HI>Pocahonta;</HI> we have thought not improper to reserve the Story of it, being very remarkable for a particular Relation, before we conclude our Description of <HI>Virginia,</HI> since otherwise we should have interrupted the Series of our former Discourse.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>The Relation of Captain <HI>Smith</HI>'s being taken Prisoner by <HI>Powhatan,</HI> and of his being deliver'd from Death by his Daughter <HI>Pocahonta.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Salvages having drawn from one <HI>George Cassen,</HI> whither Captain <HI>Smith</HI> was gone, prosecuting that opportunity, they follow'd him with three hundred Bowe-Men, conducted by the King of <HI>Pamaunkee,</HI> who in divisions, searching the turnings of the River, found two of his Men by the fire side, whom they shot full of Arrows, and slew. Then finding the Captain, who, as is said, us'd the Salvage that was his Guide as his Shield, (three of them being slain, and others sore gall'd) the rest would not come near him: Thinking thus to have return'd to his Boat, regarding them as he march'd, more than his way, he slipp'd up to the middle in an Osier-Creek, and his Salvage-with him, yet durst they not come to him, till being near dead with cold, he threw away his Arms: Then according to their composition, they drew him forth, and led him to the Fire, where his Men were slain; diligent∣ly they chaf'd his benumm'd Limbs, he demanding for their Captain, they shew'd him <HI>Opechankanough,</HI> King of <HI>Pamaunkee,</HI> to whom he gave a round Ivory double compass Dyal. Much they marvel'd at the playing of the Fly and Needle, which they could see so plainly, and yet not touch it, because of the Glass that cover'd them; but when he demonstrated by that Globe-like Jewel, the roundness of the Earth, and Skies; the Sphere of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and how the Sun did chase the Night round about the World continually; the greatness of the Land and Sea; the diversity of Nations, variety of Complexions, and how we were to them <HI>Antipodes,</HI> and many other such like matters, they all stood as amaz'd with admiration: Notwithstanding, within an hour after they ty'd him to a Tree, and as many as could stand about him prepar'd to shoot him; but the King holding up the Compass in his Hand, they all laid down their Bowes and Arrows, and in a triumphant manner led him to <HI>Orapaks,</HI> where he was after their manner kindly Feasted, and well us'd.</P>
<P>Their order in conducting him was thus; Drawing themselves all in Fyle, the King in the midst had all their Bowes and Swords borne before him. Captain <HI>Smith</HI> was led after him by three great Salvages, holding him fast by each Arm; and on each side six went in Fyle with their Arrows nocked. But arriving at the Town (which was but onely thirty or forty Hunting Houses made of Mats, which they remove as they please, as we our Tents) all the Women and Children staring and gazing at him, the Souldiers first all in Fyle wheel'd off to the Rear in good Order; on each Flank were Officers, like Serjeants to see them keep their Postures: A good time they continu'd this Exercise, and then cast themselves in a Ring, Dancing in such several Postures, and singing and yelling out such hellish Notes
<PB N="203" REF="124"/>and Screeches; being strangely Painted, every one his Quiver of Arrows, and at his Back a Club; on his Arm a Fox or an Otters-skin, or some such matter for his vambrace; their Heads and Shoulders Painted red, with Oyl and <HI>Pocones</HI> mingled together, which Scarlet-like colour, made an exceeding handsome show; his Bowe in his Hand, and the Skin of a Bird with her Wings abroad dry'd, ty'd on his Head, a piece of Copper, a white Shell, a long Feather, with a small Rattle growing at the Tails of their Snaks ty'd to it, or some such like Toy. All this while <HI>Smith</HI> and the King stood in the midst, guarded, as before is said, and after three Dances they all departed. <HI>Smith</HI> they conducted to a long House, where thirty or forty tall Fel∣lows did guard him, and e're long, more Bread and Venison was brought him than would have serv'd twenty Men, I think his Stomack at that time was not ve∣ry good; what he left, they put in Baskets and ty'd over his Head. About mid∣night they set the Meat again before him; all this time none of them would eat a bit with him, till the next Morning they brought him as much more, and then did they eat all the old, and reserv'd the new as they had done the other, which made him think they would feed him for slaughter: Yet in this desperate estate to fend him from the cold, one <HI>Maocassater</HI> brought him his Gown, in requital of some Beads and Toys <HI>Smith</HI> had given him at his first arrival in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>Two days after a man would have slain him (but that the Guard prevented it) for the death of his Son, to whom they conducted him to recover the poor man then breathing his last. <HI>Smith</HI> told them, that at <HI>James-Town</HI> he had a Water would do it, if they would let him fetch it, but they would not permit that; but made all the preparations they could to assault <HI>James-Town,</HI> craving his advice, and for re∣compence he should have Life, Liberty, Land, and Women. In part of a Table∣book he writ his mind to them▪ at the Fort, what was intended, how they should follow that direction to affright the messengers, and without fail send him such things as he writ for, and an Inventory with them. The difficulty and danger, he told the Salvages, of the Mines, great Guns, and other Engines, exceedingly af∣frighted them, yet according to his Request they went to <HI>James-Town,</HI> in as bitter weather as could be of Frost and Snow, and within three days return'd with an An∣swer.</P>
<P>But when they came to <HI>James-Town,</HI> seeing Men sally out as he had told them they would, they fled; yet in the night they came again to the same place where he had told them they should receive answer, and such things as he had promis'd them, which they found accordingly, and with which they return'd with no small expedition, to the wonder of them all, supposing that he could either Divine, or the Paper could speak: then they led him to the <HI>Youthtanunds,</HI> the <HI>Mattapanients,</HI> the <HI>Payankatanks,</HI> the <HI>Nantaughtacunds,</HI> and <HI>Onawmanients</HI> upon the Rivers of <HI>Rapahanock,</HI> and <HI>Patawomek,</HI> through intricate ways, and back again by divers other several Na∣tions, to the Kings Habitation at <HI>Pamaunkee,</HI> where they entertain'd him with most strange and fearful Conjurations. Not long after, early in the Morning, a great fire was made in a long House, and a Mat spread on each side thereof; on the one they caus'd him to sit, and all the Guard went out of the House, and presently there came skipping in a great grim Fellow, all Painted over with Coal, mingled with Oyl; and many Snakes and Wesels skins stuff'd with Moss, and all their Tails ty'd together, so as they met on the Crown of his Head in a Tassel; and round about the Tassel was a Coronet of Feathers, the Skins hanging round about his Head, Back, and Shoulders, and in a manner cover'd his Face; with a hellish voice, and a Rattle in his Hand. With most strange gestures and passions he began his Invocation, and environ'd the fire with a Circle of Meal; which
<PB N="204" REF="125"/>done, three more such like Devils came rushing in with the like antique Tricks, Painted half black, half red; but all their Eyes were Painted white, and some red strokes like <HI>Mutchato's,</HI> along their Cheeks: round about him those Fiends Danc'd a pretty while, and then came in three more as ugly as the rest, with red Eyes, and white strokes over their black Faces; at last they all sate down right against him, three of them on the one hand of the chief Priest, and three on the other; then all with their Rattles began a Song, which ended, the chief Priest laid down five Wheat Corns, then stretching his Arms and Hands with such violence, that he sweat, and his Veins swell'd, he began a short Oration: at the conclusion, they all gave a short groan, and then laid down three Grains more; after that, began their Song again, and then another Oration, ever laying down so many Corns as before, till they had twice incircled the Fire; that done, they took a bunch of lit∣tle Sticks, prepared for that purpose, continuing still their Devotion, and at the end of every Song and Oration, they laid down a Stick between the Divisions of Corn: rill night, neither he nor they did either eat or drink, and then they fea∣sted merrily, with the best Provisions they could make: Three days they us'd this Ceremony, the meaning whereof they told him, was to know if he intended them well, or no. The Circle of Meal signifi'd their Countrey, the Circles of Corn the bounds of the Sea, and the Sticks his Countrey. They imagin'd the World to be flat and round, like a Trencher, and they in the midst. After this they brought him a Bag of Gun-powder, which they carefully preserv'd till the next Spring, to Plant as they did their Corn, because they would be acquainted with the nature of that Seed; <HI>Opitchapam,</HI> the King's Brother, invited him to his House, where, with as ma∣ny Platters of Bread, Fowl, and wild Beasts, as did environ him, he bid him well∣come, but not any of them would eat a bit with him, but put up all the remainder in Baskets. At his return to <HI>Opechancanoughs,</HI> all the Kings Women, and their Chil∣dren, flock'd about him for their Parts, as a due by Custom, to be merry with such Fragments.</P>
<P>At last, they brought him to <HI>Meronocomoco,</HI> where was <HI>Powhatan</HI> their Emperor. Here more than two hundred of those grim Courtiers stood wondering at him, as he had been a Monster; till <HI>Powhatan</HI> and his Train had put themselves in their greatest Braveries. Before a Fire, upon a seat like a Bedsted, he sat cover'd with a great Robe, made of <HI>Rarowcun</HI>-Skins, and all the Tails hanging by. On either hand did sit a young Maid, of sixteen ox eighteen years of Age, and along on each side the House, two rows of Men, and behind them as many Women, with all their Heads and Shoulders Painted red; many of their Heads bedeck'd with the white Doun of Birds, but every one with something, and a great Chain of white Beads about their Necks. At his entrance before the Emperor, all the People gave a great shout. The Queen of <HI>Appamatuck</HI> was appointed to bring him Water to wash his Hands, and another brought him a bunch of Feathers, in stead of a Towel to dry them: Having Feasted him after their barbarous manner as well as they could, a long consultation was held, but in conclusion, two great Stones being brought before <HI>Powhatan,</HI> as many as could, laid Hands on him, dragg'd him to them, and thereon laid his Head, when being ready with their Clubs, to beat out his Brains, <HI>Pocahontas,</HI> the Emperors dearest Daughter, seeing no intreaty could prevail, got his Head in her Arms, and laid her own upon his to save him from death; whereat, the Emperor was contented he should live to make him Hatchets, and her Bells, Beads, and Copper; for they thought him a Man of all Occupations like them∣selves; for the King himself will make his own Robes, Shoes, Bowes, Arrows, Pots, Plant, Hunt, or do any thing as well as the rest.</P>
<PB N="205" REF="125"/>
<P>Two days after, <HI>Powhatan</HI> having disguis'd himself in the most fearful minner he could, caus'd Captain <HI>Smith</HI> to be brought forth to a great House in the Woods, and there upon a Mat by the Fire to be left alone. Not long after, from behind a Mat that divided the House, was made the most doleful noise he ever heard; then <HI>Powhatan,</HI> more like a Devil than a Man, with about two hundred more as black as himself, came unto him, and told him, That now they were Friends, and presently he should go to <HI>James-Town,</HI> to send him two great Guns and a Grindstone, for which he would give him the Countrey of <HI>Capahowosick;</HI> and for ever esteem him as his Son <HI>Nantaquoud.</HI> So to <HI>James-Town</HI> with twelve Guides <HI>Powhatan</HI> sent him. That Night they Quarter'd in the Woods, he still expecting (as he had done all this long time of his Imprisonment) every hour to be put to one Death or other, for all their Feasting: but Almighty God (by his Divine Providence) had molli∣fi'd the Hearts of those stern <HI>Barbarians</HI> with compassion. The next Morning be∣times they came to the Fort, where <HI>Smith</HI> having us'd the Salvages with what kind∣ness he could, he shew'd <HI>Rawhunt, Powhatan</HI>'s trusty Servant, two Demi-Culverins and a Milstone, to carry to <HI>Powhatan:</HI> they found them somewhat too heavy; but when they saw him Discharge them, they being loaded with Stones, amongst the Boughs of a great Tree loaded with Isickles, the Ice and Branches came so tumbling down, that the poor Salvages ran away half dead with Fear. But at last we re∣gain'd some Conference with them, and gave them some Toys, and sent to <HI>Powha∣tan</HI>'s Women and Children such Presents, as gave them in general, full content.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Description of <HI>Carolina.</HI></NOTE><HI>CArolina</HI> is that part of <HI>Florida</HI> which lies between twenty nine and thirty six Degrees and thirty Minutes of Northern Latitude: It is wash'd on the East and South, with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean; on the West with <HI>Mare Pacifi∣cum,</HI> or the South Sea; and on the North, bounds on <HI>Virginia.</HI> A Countrey wherein Nature shews how bountiful she can be without the assistance of Art, the Inhabi∣tants (excepting a little <HI>Maiz</HI> which their old Men and Women Plant) depending meerly on the natural and spontaneous Growth of the Soil for their Provisions, the Woods furnishing them with store of Fruit and Venison, and the Rivers with plenty of several sorts of wholsom and savory Fish.</P>
<P>This Maintenance, which without forecast or toil they receive from the natural fruitfulness of the Countrey, will, if we consider either the largeness of their Growth, or the duration of their Lives, be thought neither scanty nor unhealthy, their Stature being of a larger size than that of <HI>English</HI>-men, their Make strong and well proportion'd, a crooked or mis-shapen Person being not to be found in the whole Countrey; and (where the chance of War, which they are almost continu∣ally engag'd in one against another in their little Governments, spares any of them) they live to an incredible old age; so that when the <HI>English</HI> came there, they found some of their Kings, who saw descend from them the sixth Generation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Production of the Soil.</NOTE>The Soil is very rich and fertile, producing naturally Walnuts, Grapes (of which the <HI>English</HI> who are there Planted have made very good Wine) Apricocks, Bullys, with a multitude of others; besides the Woods also are full of very good Peaches, and all the Season of the Year strew'd all over with Strawberries. Mul∣berry-Trees are the common growth of the Woods; and to assure you they are the natural Offspring of the Place, and grow to an incredible bigness, one whereof the
<PB N="206" REF="126"/><HI>English</HI> (who are new Planted at <HI>Albemarle Point</HI> on <HI>Ashley</HI> River) made use to fasten the Gate of their Pallisado to, was so large, that all who came from thence say, they never saw any Oak in <HI>England</HI> bigger, which is but the ordinary size of the Mul∣berry-Trees of this Countrey, which is so sure an Argument of the richness of the Soil, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Virginia</HI> enquiring of the Seamen who came from thence, concerning the Quality and Product of the Countrey, when they were in∣form'd of the large Mulberry-Trees it produc'd, were so well satisfi'd with it, that they made no farther Enquiry. There are also other Trees, as Ash, Poplar, and Bay, with several sorts unknown to us of <HI>Europe;</HI> but those which make it almost all one general Forrest of large Timber-Trees, are Oak, both red and white, and Cedar. There are also here and there large Groves of Pine-Trees, some a hundred Foot high, which afford a better sort of Mast than are to be had either in <HI>Mary-Land</HI> or <HI>Norway.</HI> These larger Trees weaving their luxuriant Branches into a close Shade, suffer no Under-wood to grow between them, either by their Droppings, or else the Heads of Deer which loosening all the tender Shoots, quite destroy it; so that a great part of the Countrey is as it were a vast Forrest of fine Walks, free from the heat of the Sun, or the incumbrance of Shrubs and Bushes, and so clear and open, that a Man may easily ride a Hunting amongst the Trees, yielding a Prospect very pleasant and surpassing. On the Skirts of these Woods grow lesser Trees and Shrubs of several sorts; amongst them are sundry Dying Materials, which how well the Inhabitants know how to make use of, appears in the Deer-Skins that the chief of them wear, which are Painted, or rather Dy'd, with several lively Colours. But amongst their Shrubs, one of most note and use is that whose Leaves make their <HI>Casini,</HI> a Drink they frequently use, and affirm to be very advantageous for the pre∣servation of Health; which, by the description our <HI>English</HI> give of the size, colour, and shape of the Leaf, the sort of Tree it grows on, and the taste, colour, and effects of the Drink, which is nothing but the Decoction of the Leaf, seems to be the very same with the <HI>East-India TEE,</HI> and by those who have seen and tasted both, af∣firm'd to be no other, and may very probably be a spontaneous and native Plant of this Place, since those who give us an account of it, tell us, that this so much valu'd Leaf grows most plentifully in <HI>Nanking,</HI> a Province in <HI>China</HI> under the very same Latitude, and very much agreeing in Soil and Situation with this of <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>What Herbs else the Countrey produces, the <HI>English</HI> Enquirers (who by minding their Plantations and Settlement there, have been taken off from such unprofitable Actions) give us but little account, onely they say, that those Plats of Ground which have been formerly clear'd off by the <HI>Indians</HI> for the Planting their Corn, they found thick cover'd with three-leav'd Grass and Dazies, which the fertility of the Soil thrusts forth, whenever the Natives remove their Tillage to some other place, and leave the Earth to its own production; and in other parts they found plenty of Garden Herbs growing wild. The low and Moorish Grounds are for the most part overgrown with Sedge and Reeds, and such other Trash, which usu∣ally incumbers rich and uncultivated Lands; those they call <HI>Swamsas,</HI> which with a little Husbandry would prove very good Meadows. There are also some large and pleasant <HI>Savanas,</HI> or grassy Plains.</P>
<P>These are a part of the Trees and Plants best known to us, that Nature of her self produces, in a Soil which contrives and nourishes any thing. The <HI>English</HI> who are now Planted in the most Northern parts of it, at <HI>Albemarle,</HI> bordering on <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI> have Apples, Pears, Cherries, Apricocks, Plumbs, and Water-Melons, equal∣ling, and if you will believe the Inhabitants, both in largeness of size and goodness of taste, exceeding any in <HI>Europe.</HI> And they who are Setled farther South on <HI>Ashley</HI>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣nes of the Countrey.</NOTE>Besides those things which do serve to satisfie Hunger, or provoke it, the Land doth with great return produce Indigo, Ginger, Tobacco, Cotton, and other Com∣modities fit to send abroad and furnish foreign Markets; and when a little time shall have brought those kind of Plants to maturity, and given the Inhabitants leisure to furnish themselves with Conveniences for ordering those things aright, the Trials that they have already made of the Soil and its fitness for such Plan∣tations, assure you, that besides Silk, enough to store <HI>Europe,</HI> and a great many other considerable Commodities, they shall have as great plenty of good Wine and Oyl, as any part of the World.</P>
<P>The Mould is generally black, mellow, and upon handling feels soft, and (to use their Expression who have been there) soapy, and is generally all over the Countrey just like the fine Mould of our well order'd Gardens. Under this black Earth, which is of a good thickness in most places that they have try'd, there lies a Bed of Marle, and in some parts Clay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fish and Water-Fowl.</NOTE>The Rivers are stor'd with plenty of excellent Fish of several sorts, which are ta∣ken with great ease in abundance, and are one great part of the Natives Provision, who are never like to want this Recruit, in a Countrey so abounding in large Ri∣vers, there being in that one small Tract between <HI>Port Rasal</HI> and <HI>Cape Carteret,</HI> which are not one Degree distant, five or six great Navigable Rivers, that empty themselves into the Sea. These Rivers are also cover'd with Flocks of Ducks and Mallard, whereof millions are seen together, besides Cranes, Herons, Geese, Cur∣lews, and other Water-Fowl, who are so easie to be kill'd, that onely rising at the discharge and noise of a Gun, they instantly light again in the same place, and pre∣sently offer a fresh Mark to the Fowler. At the Mouths of the Rivers, and along the Sea-Coast, are Beds of Oysters, which are of a longer Make than those in <HI>Europe,</HI> but very well tasted, wherein are often found good large Pearls, which though the unskilful <HI>Indians</HI> by washing the Oysters do commonly discolour, and spoil their lustre, yet 'tis not to be doubted, but if rightly order'd, there will be found many of value, and the Fishing for them turn to some account.</P>
<P>Besides the easie Provisions which the Rivers and Sea afford, their Woods are well stock'd with Deer, Rabbets, Hares, Turtle-Doves, Phesants, Partridges, and an infinite number of Wood-Pigeons and wild Turkies, which are the ordinary Dishes of the <HI>Indians,</HI> whose House-keeping depends on their Fishing and Hunting, and who have found it no ill way of Living in so fertile a Countrey, to trust them∣selves without any labor or forecast, to the Supplies which are there provided to their hands, without the continual trouble of Tillage and Husbandry. Besides, these Woods are fill'd with innumerable variety of smaller Birds, as different in their Notes as Kinds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperatine of the Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mate.</NOTE>The Temperature of this Province is agreeable to a Countrey, whose Position is on the warmer side of the temperate <HI>Zone,</HI> but yet the Heat is not so sultry nor offensive, as in Places under the same Latitude in the <HI>Old World;</HI> to which modera∣tion of Heat, as well as the healthiness of it, the vast <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, lying to the East and South of it, may perhaps not a little contribute, an instance whereof some think <HI>China</HI> to be; to which deservedly admir'd Countrey <HI>Carolina</HI> exactly an∣swers in its Position and Latitude, the trending from North-East to South-West of its Coast, and the lowness of its Shore, and wants nothing but Inhabitants, to
<PB N="208" REF="127"/>make it equal, if not excell, in all conveniences of Life, as it doth in richness of Soil, that flourishing Empire. The healthiness of the Air is such, that it is not onely benign and favorable to the home-bred <HI>Indians,</HI> and Constitutions accustom'd to it, but the <HI>English</HI>-men who first Planted on <HI>Ashley</HI> River, though for some other Conveniences they Planted on the side, or almost middle of a Morass, and were en∣compass'd with a salt Marsh, where the Air, pent up with Woods that surrounded them, had not that freedom it hath in open and cultivated Countreys, yet lost not in a whole years time, of a considerable number, any one Person, of any Disease to be imputed to the Countrey, those few that dy'd in that time sinking under lin∣gring Distempers which they brought with them, and had almost worn them out before they came thither. The <HI>Bermudians</HI> (who being accustom'd to the pure Air of their own Island, cannot without hazard of their Lives put themselves into any other Place) assur'd of the healthiness of this Place, which is the next Land to them, and under the same Latitude, venture hither. And generally all the <HI>English</HI> Planting in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> are so taken with the Conveniences of this Countrey, which, as some of the most considerable of the <HI>English</HI> in those Parts say of it, pro∣mises all that the Heart of Man can wish, that they send the overplus of their Peo∣ple hither; to which the Inhabitants of <HI>Barbados,</HI> a skilful and wary sort of Plan∣ters, well knowing in all the parts of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> have been found to remove the Hands they could spare. As the Summer is not intolerably nor offensively hot, so the Winter is not troublesom nor pinching, but enough to correct the Humors of Mens Bodies, the better to strengthen them, and preserve their Healths; and so far to check the growth of Plants, that by this stop they may put out more regularly, and the Corn and other Fruits the better ripen together, and be ready seasonably at the Harvest, the want whereof in some Countreys hinders the beneficial Growth of several valuable Commodities, the continual Spring all the year long making that their Crops are never ready, their Trees being laden with green and ripe Fruit at the same time, which is to be seen in the Vines growing between the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> where, though they bear excellent Grapes, yet they cannot make any Wine, whilest the mixture of ripe and sowre Grapes upon the same Branch, renders them unfit for the Press, which from Grapes so blended, though of a good kind, would squeeze out a very crude and useless Liquor. This also is the reason why many Parts where our Wheat will grow very well, do yet lose the benefit of it, whilest the se∣veral Ears ripening unequally, never make the Crop fit for the Sickle. But this Countrey hath Winter enough to remove that Inconvenience, and to put such a stop to the Rise of the Sap, and the Budding of Plants, as to make the several kinds of Fruits Bud and Blossom in their distinct Seasons, and keep even pace till they are fit to be gather'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature, Con∣stitutions, and Manners of the Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE>To this happy Climate the native Inhabitants are very well suited, a strong, lusty, and well shap'd People, who to their well knit and active Bodies, want not stout and vigorous Minds; they are a People of a good Understanding, well Hu∣mor'd, and generally so just and Honest, that they may seem to have no notice of, as their Language hath no word for, Dishonesty and Cheating; and the worst Name they have for ill Men is, that they are not good. They are a stout and va∣liant People, which appears in the constant Wars they are engag'd in, not out of covetousness, and a desire of usurping others Possessions, or to enrich themselves by the Spoils of their Neighbors, but upon a pitch of Honor, and for the glory of Vi∣ctory, which is their greatest joy, there being no parts of their Lives wherein they enjoy so much satisfaction, and give themselves so wholly to Jollity, as in their Triumphs after Victory. Valor therefore is the Vertue they most esteem and
<PB N="209" REF="127"/>reward, and he which hath behav'd himself well in the Wars, is suffer'd to wear the Badges of Honor, and is advanc'd beyond others with some Marks of his Courage; which amongst some is blacking the Skin below his Eyes, with black Lead, in fashion something of an Half-Moon; which Mark of Courage is, not suf∣fer'd to be worn by any, but those who by some brave Action, as killing the Ene∣my's Leader, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hath signaliz'd himself in their Encounters. They are faithful to their Promises, fair and candid in their Dealings, and so far from Dishonesty, that they want even the Seeds of it, <HI>viz.</HI> Forecast and Covetousness; and he will be very little apt to deceive you to Day, who troubles not himself much about to Morrow, and trusts for the Provisions of the Day to the Day it self; which pro∣ceeds not in them for want of Wit, but desire of Content and Quiet, or by the help of their natural Reason they enjoy that Happiness which the Philosophers could not by their Study and Reading attain to, whilest these Men cut off those Desires which Learning could never help the other to Govern, and which if once permit∣ted to run out beyond the present, are capable of no rest nor Bounds. In their Conversation they are courteous and civil, and in their Visits make Presents to one another; when they meet, their way of Salutation is stroaking on the Shoulders, and sucking in their Breath; and if he be a great Man whom they Salute, they stroak his Thighs too; as civil an Address, as those Patterns of good Breeding, the Hero's, us'd to their Princes, who in their greatest Courtships, we are told, em∣brac'd their Knees: After their Salutation they sit down; and it is usual with them to sit still almost a quarter of an hour before they speak, which is not an effect of stupidity or sullenness, but the accustom'd Gravity of their Countrey; for they are in their Tempers a merry, frollick, gay People, and so given to Jollity, that they will Dance whole Nights together, the Women sitting by and Singing, whilest the Men Dance to their Ayrs, which though not like ours, are not harsh or unplea∣sing, but are something like the Tunes of the <HI>Irish:</HI> So that if we will not let our selves too fondly admire onely the Customs we have been bred up in, nor think Men are to be valu'd for making Legs after our Mode, or the Clothes they wear, which, the finer and gayer they are, always the more to be suspected of Luxury and Effeminateness; if we will allow but these Men to follow the Garbs of their own Countrey, and think them fine enough in a shape onely to hide their Nakedness before, or a Deer-skin hanging loosely on their Shoulders, and their Women not ill Dress'd in Garments of Moss, and Necklaces of Beads, whilest the Fashion of their Courts require no other Ornaments; if, I say, a long and pleasant Life, without Distemper or Care, be to be valu'd, without the incumbrance of unne∣cessary Trinkets; if Men are to be esteem'd for Valor, Honesty, Friendship, Hu∣manity and good Nature, though Strangers to the ceremonious Troubles we are accustom'd to, the Natives of <HI>Carolina</HI> will as little, or perhaps less, deserve the Name of <HI>Miserable,</HI> or <HI>Salvage,</HI> as those that give it them. 'Tis true, the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> who have Planted amongst them, or with little Armies travell'd their Countrey, have been ill handled by them; but yet the <HI>Indians</HI> never did them any harm, or treated them otherwise than Friends, till those <HI>Europeans</HI> by their breach of Faith and several Outrages, had provok'd their just Revenge; and they did nothing but what most vertuous and generous sort of Men are apt to do, to revenge those Affronts, which did not agree with their Tempers tamely to endure. That this did not proceed from treachery and inconstancy in their Natures, is apparent in the contrary Correspondence they have had with the <HI>English</HI> Setled amongst them, to whom they have been all along very kind, as they were at first very cove∣tous of their Company; for after that some of their King's Relation had been at
<PB N="210" REF="128"/><HI>Barbados,</HI> and had seen and admir'd the Temper, Fashions, and Strength of the <HI>English</HI> there, and had been very civilly Treated in that Island, they were so well satisfi'd with them, that at the coming of the <HI>English</HI> to Settle there, the several little Kingdoms strove with all the Arts and Arguments they could use, each of them to draw the <HI>English</HI> to Plant in their Dominions, by commending the richness of their Soil, conveniency of their Rivers, the healthiness of their Countrey, the disparage∣ment of their Neighbors, and whatever else they judg'd might allure the <HI>English</HI> to their Neighborhood. Nor was this onely the first heat of Men fond of Novelties, and as soon weary of them again, but ever since the <HI>English</HI> first Planted at <HI>Albemarle Point,</HI> on <HI>Ashley</HI> River, they have continu'd to do them all manner of friendly Of∣fices, ready on all occasions to supply them with any thing they have observ'd them to want, not making use of our Mens Necessities, as an opportunity to en∣hance the Price of their Commodities, a sort of fair Dealing we could scarce have promis'd them amongst civiliz'd, well bred, and religious Inhabitants of any part of <HI>Europe;</HI> and though they are much frighted with our Guns, both small and great, yet like innocent and well-meaning People, they do not at all distrust our Power, but freely, without suspicion, trust themselves, both Men and Women, even their Kings themselves, in our Town, Lodging and Dancing there frequently whole Nights together, upon no other Pledges but the bare confidence of our mutual Friendship; nor do our Men use any greater caution in Conversing with them, stragling up and down, and travelling singly and unarm'd through their Woods for many Miles about, and are so far from receiving any injury or ill treatment from them, that on the contrary they are kindly us'd and Entertain'd, and guided by them in their Way whenever they desire it; and when any of our Men meet them in their Walks, the <HI>Indians</HI> all stand still till they are gone by, civilly Salu∣ting them as they pass. Nor doth this Assurance of theirs bound it self within their own Homes, they of their own accords venturing themselves aboard our Ships, have gone voluntarily with our Men to <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Barbados.</HI> Nor have the <HI>English</HI> been wanting on their parts in any thing that may preserve this Amity, being ve∣ry cautious of doing them any injury, bartering with them for those things they receive of them, and buying of them even the waste Land they make no use of.</P>
<P>Besides the simplicity of the <HI>Indians</HI> Diet, it is very remarkable, that they have a general aversion to those two things which are most acceptable to our Palates, and without which few of us either eat or drink with any delight; for in their Meats they cannot endure the least mixture or rellish of Salt; and for their Drink, they utterly abominate all manner of strong Liquor; to the latter whereof, their large Growth and constant Health, is perhaps not a little owing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Govern∣ment.</NOTE>Every little Town is a distinct Principality, Govern'd by an Hereditary King, who in some places is not Son, but Sisters Son to the precedent King, the Succes∣sion of the Blood-Royal being continu'd by the safer side. The great Business of those Princes is to lead their Men out against their Enemies in War, or against the Beasts in Hunting; for unless it be to appoint them where to Hunt, or else to Consult about making some Attempt upon their Enemy, he hath but small trouble in the Government of his Subjects, who either through their own Honesty, or the few occasions they have for Controversies in their <HI>extempore</HI> way of Living, need few Laws, and little Severity to keep them in order; but yet they Govern their People without Contract, and fail not of a ready Obedience to their Commands; so that when some of them have bought things of such of the <HI>English,</HI> who by the Orders made amongst our selves were not to Traffick with the <HI>Indians,</HI> they have, upon Complaint made to their <HI>Casiques,</HI> been restor'd again, though in strict Rules
<PB N="211" REF="128"/>of Law they were neither bound by, nor oblig'd to take notice of the Rules which were made onely to Govern our own People, and had at just Prices bought what they carry'd away; such is the Honesty of Men, whose Principles not being cor∣rupted with Learning and Distinction, are contented to follow the Dictates of right Reason, which Nature has sufficiently taught all Men for the well ordering of their Actions, and enjoyment and preservation of humane Society, who do not give themselves up to be amus'd and deceiv'd by insignificant Terms, and minding what is just and right, seek not Evasions in the Niceties and Fallacies of Words.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carolina</HI> granted by Patent to several No∣ble Persons by His Ma∣jesty.</NOTE>The same is to be said of the first discovery of this Countrey, as hath been for∣merly said of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Florida,</HI> of both which it partakes; but as to the present Interest and Propriety, the <HI>English,</HI> besides all <HI>Virginia</HI> intirely, have also so much of <HI>Florida</HI> as makes up this considerable Province of <HI>Carolina,</HI> which soon after, the happy Restauration of His present Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> II. from whom it receives Denomination, was granted by Patent to <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> L.

<P>The Lords-Proprietors of this Countrey, for the better Settlement of it accord∣ing to their Patent granted unto them by His Majesty, and for the enlargement of the King's Dominions in those parts of <HI>America,</HI> have been at great Charge to secure this so rich and advantageous a Countrey to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> to whom of an∣cient Right, by the Discovery of Sir <HI>Sebastian Cabott</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, it doth belong, and for its Situation, Fertility, Neighborhood to our other Plantati∣ons and several other Conveniences, of too valuable consideration to be negligently lost: By the Care therefore and Endeavors of those Great Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their care for Setling and Impro∣ving of this Plantation.</NOTE> it hath now two considerable Colonies Planted in it, the one of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> on the North side, border∣ing on <HI>Virginia,</HI> where are some hundreds of <HI>English</HI> Families remov'd thither from <HI>New England,</HI> and some of our other Plantations in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> and ano∣ther towards the middle of the Countrey, at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> or <HI>Ashley-River,</HI> a Settle∣ment so hopeful, for the healthiness of the Land, and convenience of access by a large deep Navigable River, and so promising in its very Infancy, that many of the rich Inhabitants of <HI>Barbados</HI> and <HI>Bermudas,</HI> who are now crowded up in those flourishing Islands, and many in our other <HI>American</HI> Plantations, are turning their Eyes and Thoughts this way, and have already remov'd part of their Stock and Servants thither. Nor is it to be doubted, but that many, following the Example of those who went to <HI>Albemarle,</HI> will be drawn to this better Plantation at <HI>Ashley-River,</HI> from <HI>New-England,</HI> where the heat of their Zeal, and the coldness of the Air, doth not agree with every Man's Constitution; and therefore it is to be thought, that many well temper'd Men, who are not much at ease under such Extreams, will be forward to remove hither.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fair Terms propos'd to whomsoever shall remove thither.</NOTE>The Lords-Proprietors, for the comfortable subsistence, and future enrichment of all those who shall this Year 1671. Transport themselves and Servants thither, allow every Man a hundred Acres <HI>per</HI> Head, for himself, his Wife, Children and Servants, he carries thither, to him and his Heirs for ever, paying onely one Peny an Acre, as a Chief-Rent; which Peny an Acre is not to be paid these nineteen years; and those Servants who go along thither with their Masters, shall each also have a hundred Acres upon the same Terms, when he is out of his Time. But though these Conditions are very advantageous, and the Countrey promises to the Planter Health, Plenty and Riches at a cheap Rate, yet there is one thing that makes this Plantation more valuable than all these, and that is the secure possession of all these
<PB N="212" REF="129"/>things with as great certainty as the state of humane Affairs, and the transient things of this Life are capable of, in a well continu'd Form of Government, wherein it is made every Man's Interest to pre∣serve the Rights of his Neighbor with his own; and those who have the greatest Power, have it limi∣ted to the Service of the Countrey, the Good and Welfare whereof whilest they preserve and pro∣mote, they cannot miss of their own, the Lords. Proprietors having no other aim, than to be the greatest Men in a Countrey where every one may be happy if it be not his own fault, it being almost as uncomfortable, and much more unsafe, to be Lord over, than Companion of a miserable, un∣happy, and discontented Society of Men.</P>
<P>With this Design the Lords-Proprietors, who are at great Charge for carrying on this Plantation, have put the framing of a Government into the Hands of one, whose Parts and Experience in Affairs of State are universally agreed on, and who is by all Men allow'd to know what is convenient for the right ordering Men in Society, and setling a Government upon such Foundations, as may be equal, safe, and lasting; and to this hath a Soul large enough to wish well to Mankind, and to desire, that all the People where he hath to do might be happy. My Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> therefore, by the consent of his Bre∣thren, the rest of the Lords Proprietors, hath drawn up, to their general satisfaction, some funda∣mental Constitutions, which are since, by their joynt approbation, confirm'd to be the Model and Form of Government in the Province of <HI>Carolina;</HI> the main Design and Ballance thereof (accord∣ing to the best of my memory, having had a Copy thereof) in short is as followeth:</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Model drawn up by the Lord <HI>Ash∣ley</HI> for the Government of <HI>Carolina.</HI></NOTE>1. EVery County is to consist of forty square Plots, each containing twelve thousand Acres. Of these square Plots each of the Proprietors is to have one, which is to be call'd a <HI>Signiory.</HI> Eight more of these square Plots are to be divided amongst the three Noble-men of that County, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Landgrave,</HI> who is to have four of them; and two <HI>Casiques,</HI> who are to have each of them two apiece; and these square Plots belonging to the Nobility, are to be call'd <HI>Baronies.</HI> The other twenty four square Plots, call'd <HI>Colonies,</HI> are to be the Possession of the People: And this Method is to be ob∣serv'd in the Planting and Setting out of the whole Countrey; so that one Fifth of the Land is to be in the Proprietors, one Fifth in the Nobility, and three Fifths in the People,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Signories</HI> and <HI>Baronies,</HI> that is, the hereditary Lands belonging to the Proprietors and Nobi∣lity, are all entirely to descend to their Heirs, with the Dignity, without power of alienation, more than for three Lives, or one and twenty years, or two Thirds of their <HI>Signiories</HI> and <HI>Baronies,</HI> and the rest to be <HI>Demesne.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. There will be also some Mannors in the Colonies, but none less than three thousand Acres in a Piece, which, like the rest of the Colony Lands, will be alienable, onely with this difference, that it cannot be parcell'd out, but if fold, it must be altogether.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is to be a Biennial Parliament, consisting of the eight Proprietors, the <HI>Landgraves</HI> and <HI>Casiques,</HI> and one out of every Precinct, that is the six neighboring Colonies, for the People, chosen by the Freeholders; these are to sit and Vote altogether for the making of Laws, which shall be in force no longer than sixty years after their Enacting, the great mischief of most Governments, by which not onely the People are mightily entangled by multiplicity of Rules and Penalties, and thereby laid open to the Malice and Designs of troublesom Men and cunning Projectors; but, which is far worse, the whole frame of the Government in tract of time comes to be remov'd from its origi∣nal Foundation, and thereby becomes more weak and tottering.</P>
<P N="5">5. There are eight supream Courts for the dispatch of all publick Affairs; the first consists of the <HI>Palatine,</HI> who is the eldest of the Proprietors, and hath power to call Parliaments, and dispose of publick Offices. The other seven supream Courts are, 1. The chief Justices for the determining of Controversies of <HI>Meunt</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> and judging of Criminals. 2. The Chancellors, for passing of Char∣ters, and managing the State Matters of the Province. 3. The High-Constables, for Military Affairs. 4. The Admirals, for Maritime Affairs. 5. The High-Stewards, for Trade. 6. The Treasurers, for the publick Stock; and 7. The Chamberlains, for Ceremonies, Fashions, Marriages, Burials, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These are the seven supream Courts, to whom lies the ultimate Appeal in all Causes belonging to them. Each of these Courts consists of one Proprietor, and six other Councellors, whereof two are chosen by the Nobility, and two by the People. All the number of these eight Courts joyn'd together make the Grand Council, which are in the nature of a Council of State, and are entrusted with the ma∣nagement of Affairs of greatest concernment. There is also in every County a Court, and in every Precinct another; from the Precinct Court there lies an Appeal to the County Court, and from the County Court to the Proprietors Court, to which the Matter in question belongs, and there is the last decision and determination thereof, without any farther Appeal. And to keep the People from the Charges and vexation of long Suits, to the enriching of Men cunning in Words, care is taken, that no Cause shall be Try'd more than once in any one Court, and that profess'd Pleaders for Money shall not be allow'd.</P>
<P><HI>Liberty of Conscience</HI> is here also allow'd in the greatest latitude, but yet so, that neither Atheists, or Men of no Religion, are permitted; Atheism, Irreligion, and vicious Lives being condemn'd, as disagreeable to humane Nature, inconsistent with Government and Societies, and destructive to all that is useful to, or becoming of Mankind; as on the other hand, rigorous Imposing of, and hot Contentions about the Ceremonies and Circumstances of Religion, is an occasion of perpetual Strife, Faction and Division, keeps Men from sedate and temperate Enquiries after Truth, eats out the great Cement of humane Conversation, <HI>Charity,</HI> and cannot be found in any one, who hath but modesty enough to think himself less than a <HI>Pope,</HI> and short of <HI>Infallibility.</HI></P>
<P>There is also to be a Register of all Grants and Conveyances of Land, to prevent even the occasi∣ons of Controversies and Law-Suits.</P>
<P>There are several other less considerable Particulars in this Government, all contriv'd and de∣sign'd for the good and welfare of the People; all which are so well put together, and in such equal proportion ballance each other, that some judicious Men who have seen it, say, it is the best and fairest Frame, for the well-being of those who shall live under it, of any they have seen or read of.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Bounds.</NOTE>SOuth-West of <HI>Virginia</HI> lieth the spacious Countrey of <HI>Florida,</HI> remarkable hi∣therto rather by the great pains which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have taken, and the ill Successes they have met with in the discovery and search of this Province, than by any thing else they have discover'd in it answerable to their desires. On the East it hath the <HI>Atlantick Ocean,</HI> or <HI>Mare del Nordt;</HI> on the South, and South-West, the Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Mare Virginium;</HI> and full West, part of <HI>New Gallicia,</HI> and some other Countreys, not yet perfectly known.</P>
<P>This Countrey is also one of those, said to have been first of all discover'd by Sir <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> at the Charges of the King of <HI>England,</HI> about the Year 1497. but afterwards more throughly search'd into by <HI>John some de Leon,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ponce</HI>'s Expe∣dition.</NOTE> who in the Year 1511. set Sail with three Ships out of the Haven <HI>St. German</HI> in <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> North-West to the Isles <HI>Del Veio, Caycos, Yaguna, Amaguyao, Manegua,</HI> and <HI>Guanahani,</HI> first discover'd by <HI>Christopher Colonus,</HI> and call'd <HI>St. Salvador:</HI> After that Steer'd North-West by a Coast, which (because of its pleasant prospect) was call'd <HI>Florida,</HI> or (ac∣cording to the more common Opinion) because it was on <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call <HI>Pascha de Flores,</HI> or <HI>Pascha Florida</HI>) that he Landed here: And to find out a Haven he kept sight of the Shore, which appear'd South-West from him. Here the Ships met with so strong a Tide, that notwithstanding they had a fresh Gale of Wind, yet could they not stem it; one of the Ships was driven to Sea out of sight; the other two casting Anchor, which raking, drove toward the Shore; whither, being beckned by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they immediately went; when no sooner he Landed, but they ran in great Companies to make themselves Masters of the Vessels, kill'd one <HI>Spaniard,</HI> wounded two more: the Night approaching put an end to the Fight. From hence Sailing to the River <HI>La Cruix</HI> for Wood and Water, they were resisted by sixty Natives, which they put to flight with their Guns, and took one Prisoner; after which they erected a Stone Cross.

Out of the Tombs of their Princes the <HI>Spanish</HI> Officers, with the leave of the fore-mention'd Maid their Governess, got an incredible Treasure in Pearls.

Thence going to <HI>Chicora</HI> they were stopt by the Natives before a deep River with high Banks, which at last crossing, not without great trouble and blood-shedding, they Winter'd in the Village <HI>Chicora,</HI> where the Inhabitants let them rest very quietly for two Moneths; at the end of which, joyning together in the Night, they shot Fire into the Straw Roofs, and maintain'd a Fight of two hours long, in which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> lost forty Men, fifty Horses, and all their Hogs, which were burnt in the Houses. From thence going to <HI>Chicacolla</HI> they were resisted in most places, and in the Fort <HI>Alibamo</HI> Engag'd by four thousand <HI>Floridans,</HI> who waited for their coming; but those were so shrewdly hand∣led, that half of them were slain, and <HI>Sottus</HI> became Master of the Fort, as also of <HI>Chisca,</HI> which he Storm'd and took unawares. With no less trouble and danger did he get over the River <HI>El Grande,</HI> where he discover'd a Village that contain'd above four hundred Houses, and many delightful Fruit-Trees.

But this being the fourteenth year, in which the River us'd generally to overflow and drown all the adjacent Countreys, on a sudden, to their great amazement, the Wood which they had gather'd for the build∣ing of Barques to carry them home, was wash'd away, their Provisions spoil'd,

<P>We find mention'd also two other Provinces of note, <HI>viz.

In this Province is the <HI>Rio de lo Spirito Santo.</HI> The Soyl, though it produces <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat twice a year, yet it is never Dung'd, but when the Corn (which is planted in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>June</HI>) is in, they burn the Weeds; the Ashes of which serves them in stead of Soil. The King divides the Corn accor∣ding to every Mans Family. In the Winter they dwell four Moneths in the Woods, where they build small Huts of Palm-boughs, feed on Venison, smoak'd Fish, and Crocodiles, which have pure white Flesh, and are caught after this man∣ner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of taking Crocodiles.</NOTE> On the Shore of the Rivers they build little Houses full of round Holes, in which they place a Watch, who is to give notice to ten or twelve Associates, co∣ver'd all over with Boughs full of little sharp Prickles, which they thrust into the Crocodiles Throat, who with open Mouth comes running at them, and so throw∣ing him on his Back, stick his Belly full of Arrows, and kill him with Clubs. But with more subtilty and art they take their Deer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As also their Deer.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> They hide themselves unde

<P><HI>Rene Laudoniere</HI> Landing not far from the City <HI>Augustine,</HI> situate on the Banks of the River <HI>May,</HI> met with the <HI>Floridan</HI> Governor <HI>Saturiona,</HI> who conducted him to the <HI>French</HI> King's Court of Arms, erected two years before, which <HI>Saturiona,</HI> as a testi∣mony of his zeal to the <HI>French,</HI> had Crown'd with Laurel and Flowers. <HI>Saturiona</HI> had with him also his Son <HI>Atoreus,</HI> who had begotten divers Children on his Mo∣ther; whom his Father after that time no more acknowledging, resign'd her up wholly to him: At which time also his great Grandfather being then living, was above a hundred and fifty years old, and saw his Childrens Children to the fifth Generation.</P>
<P>The Religion in <HI>Florida</HI> is abominable, wicked, and cruel:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their horrid Religion.</NOTE> When they return Conquerors from a Battel, the old Women take off the dry'd Hair from the fore-mention'd Poles, hold it aloft, and thank the Sun for their Victory. But the Offerings of their first-born Sons are terrible, for they knock out their Brains with a Club in the presence of the King. Their annual worshipping of the Sun is also very ridiculous; for filling the Skin of a Stag full of sweet-smelling Herbs, they hang the Horns and Neck with Garlands, and carry it with the noise of their kind of Vocal and Instrumental Musick, to a high Trunk or hollow Body of a Tree, on which they place the stuff'd Stag, with his Head towards the Sun; which done, they falling down, desire that he would please to afford them plenty of all such Fruit as they Offer to him; after which taking their leave, they let the fore-mention'd Skin remain there till the following Year.</P>

<P>This Countrey is bounded Northward with the <HI>Peninsula</HI> of <HI>Jucatan</HI> abovesaid, and part of the Gulph or Bay of <HI>Honduras;</HI> on the South, with <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> on the East and South-East, it hath <HI>Castella Aurea;</HI> and on the West, <HI>New Spain.</HI> The length of it lieth upon the Coast of <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> and is said to be little less than three hundred Leagues; but the breadth not half so much, and in some places very narrow. It is generally a fertile and good Countrey in all respects, but especially abounding in Cattel and good Pastures; it is subdivided into seven inferior Pro∣vinces or Countreys, which are 1. <HI>Chiapa.</HI> 2. <HI>Verapaz</HI> 3. <HI>Honduras.</HI> 4. <HI>Nicaragua.</HI> 5. <HI>Veragua.</HI> 6. <HI>Costa Rica;</HI> and 7. <HI>Guatimala,</HI> specially so call'd: all differing in Language and Customs one from another.</P>
<P>The Bishoprick (as it is now call'd) of <HI>Chiapa</HI> is border'd on the West with <HI>New Spain;</HI> on the East with <HI>Vera Paz;</HI> and on the South with <HI>Mare del Zur.</HI> It is a Countrey much shaded with Woods, and those replenish'd with many fair and goodly Trees, of divers sorts, and of the largest size, as Oaks, Pines, Cedar, Myrtle, and Cypress-Trees, besides others which yield them a good kind of Rozen, precious Gums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> also several sorts of Balsom, as white, red, green, and black, not onely pleasant to the Scent, but an excellent Remedy for all manner of green Wounds: the best of it drops out of the cut Bodies of the Trees; and the worst is press'd out of the Wood and Leaves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees and Plants.</NOTE>There are also proper to this Countrey several other kinds of Trees and Plants, as that whose Fruit tastes like Pepper and Cloves, being of a great heighth; a Tree whose Leaves cure all ulcerated Sores, or the bitings of any poysonous Beast.</P>
<P>There is a sort of Cabbage call'd <HI>Ilantas,</HI> which grows to the heighth of a Tree, so that Birds make their Nests in them; they are eaten likewise like other com∣mon Cabbages.</P>
<P>There is also an Herb with narrow Leaves, which is no sooner touch'd, but it shrinks up to nothing; but at the going away of those which touch it, it obtains its former vigour.</P>
<P>Here are likewise Quails,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE> Ducks, Geese, Pheasants, Parrots, Turtle-Doves, Pi∣geons, and the like, in great abundance.</P>
<P>Amongst the several sorts of Falcons which breed in this Countrey, there is one sort which hath one Foot proper to its kind, the other like that of a Goose; it feeds on Fish along the Rivers.</P>
<P>The Bird <HI>Toto-Queztall,</HI> which is somewhat smaller than a Pigeon, with green Feathers and a long Tail, is taken onely for its Tail, which when the <HI>Indians</HI> have pull'd out, they let the Bird fly again, there being a Law amongst them, that who∣soever kills one of them, is to suffer death.</P>
<P>The Cranes here are of a dark Gray; the biggest of them have a tuft of Fea∣thers like a Crown upon their Heads.</P>

<P>The Birds <HI>Guacamayes,</HI> which are red and blue, are like a <HI>Peruan</HI> Goose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover, the Countrey yields brave Horses, Goats, Sheep, Rabbets, and Foxes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts▪</NOTE> also wild Dogs, Leopards, Lyons, and Tygers.</P>
<P>The wild Hogs which breed here have their Navels on their Backs, and have no Tails, they smell exceeding strong, and feed together in great Companies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Taquatrin,</HI> a certain Beast proper to those Parts, hath a Bag under its Belly, in which it generally carries seven or more young ones, and hath also a bald Tail; it creeps into Houses in the Night to steal Hens.</P>
<P>Here is also a certain Beast (whose Name we find not) about the bigness of a Rabbet, and like a Rat, and carries its young ones on its back whensoe're it comes abroad.</P>
<P>The Serpents, which are very numerous here, trouble the Inhabitants excee∣dingly, especially near the Village <HI>Ecatepeque,</HI> where there are such an abundance on two little Hills, that none dares approach them; some of them are very poy∣sonous, for if touch'd with a Stick, the Poyson runs up the same: and whoever are anointed with the Blood of a dead Serpent, die a lingring Death. <HI>John de Laet</HI> re∣lates, that the <HI>Indians</HI> took one which carried thirty young ones, which being a Finger long, crep up and down immediately; and the old one, being above twenty Foot long, serv'd the Natives for Venison.</P>
<P>Amongst other Beasts is also the <HI>Teuthlacokauhqui,</HI> or <HI>Fortress of the Serpents;</HI> it hath a Head like an Adder, thick Belly, glittering Scales, a black Back, sprinkled with white Crosses; at its Tail there grows yearly a Bone, with which it makes a noise when it stirs; its poysonous Teeth destroy those which are bit therewith in twenty four Hours, unless the part which is wounded be held in the Earth so long till the pain be over. Notwithstanding the noise, terrible aspect, and gestures of this Animal, the <HI>Indian</HI> Hunters make nothing to take the same by the Tail, and wrap it up in Linnen, and carrying it home make it tame. It is able to live a whole Year without either Meat or Drink; its Head when cut off grows to the bigness of a Man's Thigh in ten days time.</P>

<P>No less resolute are the <HI>Indians</HI> in taking the <HI>Ibitobaca,</HI> which is an Ell long, of a crimson Colour, full of black and white Specks, the Bones whereof they wear about their Necks in stead of Chains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Serpent <HI>Iquanna.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Iquanna</HI> is a Serpent which doth no manner of hurt, though terrible to look upon to those which know it not, having a Bag under its Chin, a glittering Comb on its Head, and on its Back sharp Bones, which stand like a Saw, and a long Tail: It lays fifty Eggs at a time as big as Acorns, of a very good taste, and fit to eat when boyl'd: It also lives both in the Water and on the Land.</P>
<P>Here are also many Baboons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baboons.</NOTE> which are big and heavy, with ugly Heads, short Legs like a Man, and Tails standing upwards; they eat all sorts of Fruit, but chiefly covet after Wine and Bread; and are so lascivious, that they often set upon Women: The Females generally bring forth two, one Male, and the other Female. There is also another sort, whose Skins, being red, are full of little Spots.</P>
<P>The ancient Inhabitants of <HI>Chiapa</HI> (divided into the <HI>Chiapaneca's,</HI> the <HI>Zeques,</HI> the <HI>Zeltates,</HI> and the <HI>Quelenes</HI>) are very Civil and Witty, also skilful in Painting, Singing, Breaking of Horses, and many other Trades.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns and Villages of Note.</NOTE>The Places of more principal note in this Countrey, inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are 1. <HI>Ciudad Real,</HI> pleasantly seated in the midst of a round Vale or Plain, and al∣most encompass'd with Hills representing the form of an Amphitheatre; also at the Foot of one which stands in the midst of the rest, the City is built. It is a City specially Priviledg'd by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> having a Court of Justice, Cathedral, and <HI>Dominican</HI> Cloyster; of a pure and temperate Air, and the Countrey round about plentifully abounding both in Corn and Fruit, onely somewhat too cold to produce Lemmons and Oranges; but for Pears, Apples, Peaches, Quinces, Cher∣ries, and the like, they grow here in great abundance.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Chiapa,</HI> which giveth Name to the Valley aforesaid; It is a Bishop's See, and famous, if but for one of its Prelates, <HI>viz. Bartholomeo de las Casas,</HI> of the Order of <HI>Predicants,</HI> who was Bishop of this City, and his Memory justly precious amongst the poor <HI>Americans</HI> at this day, for his Charity towards them, and for the stout and zealous opposition which he made against the <HI>Spaniards</HI> cruel and inhumane deal∣ings with the Natives at the beginning of their Conquests: by which at last, not∣withstanding much difficulty and resistance made by interested Persons of the other Side, he procur'd them liberty, and an Edict from the Emperor in favor of them; whereby they were declar'd to be a Free People, and not Slaves, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> forbidden to use them any longer as such, or to force them to any kind of Labour against their wills, or otherwise than by agreement with them, which Liberty they enjoy to this day; and though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are said to give them very small Wages in some places, and for their Work in their Sugar-Mills (which is no small Labor) not above five <HI>Reyals,</HI> or Two shillings six pence a Week, for the Maintenance of themselves, their Wives and Children, yet by reason it is with Consent, and in a Countrey where all things are plentiful and cheap, their Condition is much better than it was, and the favor which that good Bishop did them, never to be forgotten.

In this part of the Country are Beasts not unlike Apes, with long Tails, which they wind about the Legs of those whom they find swim∣ming and so pull them under Water; wherefore they that go to Swim take Axes along with them, to cut off their Tails.</P>
<P>The Water of the River <HI>Blanco</HI> is clear and wholsom, running for the most part through Rocky Grounds, which nevertheless are overspread with Trees.</P>
<P>In the highest Ground of <HI>Chiapa,</HI> a League and a half from the City <HI>Reall,</HI> spring clear Fountains, whose Water ebbs and flows every six hours.</P>
<P>Near the Village call'd <HI>Afixa</HI> is one which runs three years together, though in the driest Season, and is dry three years, though it Rain never so much.</P>
<P>Not far from the Village <HI>Cinacatan</HI> is another Spring, whose Water cures seve∣ral Sicknesses, but kills all Birds and Beasts which drink of the same.</P>
<P>Here are likewise divers Baths.</P>
<P>The Rivers which run out of the Valley <HI>Chiapa,</HI> fall into two great Pits.</P>
<P>Near the Village <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> in the Province <HI>Quelenes,</HI> is a strange Cavern, out of which by the throwing of a stone into the same, are heard mighty noises like claps of Thunder.</P>
<P>Not far from the Village <HI>Chicomucolo,</HI> appears a Cavern, in which is a great Plain on one side, and a standing Lake, whose Water is like Sand, on the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if they wanted not Slaves, might dig good store of Gold, Silver, Copper, Lead, Tin, and Quicksilver, out of the Mynes on the Mountain <HI>Ecatepeck,</HI> which is in nine Leagues compass: The Wind blows so strong after Sun-rising, that no Man is able to travel for it, but in the Night.</P>

Moreover, there happen oftentimes terrible Earthquakes and Storms, with Thunder and Lightning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣ties of the Countrey.</NOTE>The chief Commodities of this Countrey, are a kind of Amber, which some call <HI>Liquid Amber,</HI> which drops from divers of their Trees, and is said to be a Commo∣dity very precious, and of much use; <HI>Mastick, Sanguis Draconis, Gum Anime, Sarsapa∣rilla, China-Wood,</HI> and divers other Medicinal Drugs, which it affordeth in great plenty. The Woods afford a sweet smell, and the Trees in the same grow a won∣derful heighth.</P>
<P>The Canes which grow here, being a hundred Foot long, and proportionably thick, serve for Timber.</P>
<PB N="228" REF="144"/>
<P>There is also a hard Wood call'd <HI>Iron-Wood,</HI> either from its hardness or colour, or both, which never rots.</P>
<P>The abundance of Flowers which grow here afford nutriment to innumerable swarms of Bees, which are about the bigness of small Flies. Their Honey, which is somewhat tart, they hide in the Roots of Trees, or in the Earth. Another sort, which is made by the Wasps, bereaves those that taste of their Senses.</P>
<P>The noted'st Beast in this Countrey is the <HI>Danta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> which resembles a Mule, hath no Horns, but Ash▪ colour'd long Hair, short Neck, hanging Ears, thin Legs, with three Claws before and two behind, long Head, narrow Forehead, little Eyes, a Nose hanging over its Mouth, little Tail, sharp Teeth, and a Skin which is six Fingers thick, and scarce penetrable by any Weapon. This Beast is taken in Traps, Holes, or else with Dogs, which he often kills when hunted towards the Water. They say that this Beast taught Men first to Let-blood; for if it be too full of Blood, it pricks it self against a sharp Cane, and stops up the Orifice again very carefully. The Flesh thereof is good Meat, as also that of the <HI>Ross</HI>-Lyons, which in the day-time sleep on a high Tree, where they are shot by the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The Tygers are much more dangerous to be taken; yet the <HI>Indians</HI> Hunting them, eat them in stead of Beef; and also through all <HI>New Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The Bears, which make the Ways very dangerous to travel, have black frizled Hair, broad Tails, Feet like Mens Hands: but since the <HI>Indians</HI> have made use of Guns, which they learn'd from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they have much lessen'd the number both of Bears and Tygers.</P>
<P>There are likewise many Leopards, Apes, and wild Goats (whose Skins serve the Natives for Drums) Hogs, and <HI>Armadillo's.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst their Fowls, are Eagles and Parrots.</P>
<P>The Countrey is so well stor'd with Water, that in three Leagues space are above thirty Rivulets, and as many Fountains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Medicinal Plants.</NOTE>On the Mountains grow great quantities of <HI>Sarsaparilla, Mechoacan,</HI> and the <HI>China-Root,</HI> which being yellowish hath several Saffron-colour'd Knobs on the top. The <HI>Sarsaparilla</HI> grows with many Stalks, creeping along over the Ground; the Body thereof is tough and full of Prickles, the Leaves broad and sharp at the ends, and are of a bluish colour on one side, and green on the other, and bear Clusters of Flowers, which close like Buds, and are first green, next vermilion-red, and lastly blackish: within are two hard Stones, which inclose a white Kernel, by the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> call'd <HI>Juapecanga.</HI></P>
<P>The Bay <HI>Golfo Dulce,</HI> which pours its muddy Water into the Sea, feeds the great Fish <HI>Monati,</HI> and a great number of Crocodiles.</P>
<P>Several Rivers abounding with Fish fall also into the same, having their Banks set all along with Trees, in whose Boughs, joyn'd together on the top, those sort of Birds make their Nests which prey on Fish.</P>
<P>The Women in this place are much shorter Liv'd than the Men, so that there are often thirty Widowers to one Widow. Women with Child are Deliver'd by themselves in the High-way; and from thence they go to the next River to wash themselves and the Child.</P>

In this one Province onely they massacred above twenty hundred thousand Men, and amongst others, Persons of Quality, which had ci∣villy Entertain'd them: nay, they tortur'd the poor innocent Natives all the ways they could possibly invent, onely to know of them where their Gold lay; particularly <HI>Diego de Valasco</HI> spar'd none that ever fell into his hands; insomuch that in a Moneths time above ten thousand were slain by him: He hang'd thir∣teen Noble-men, to twelve of whom he gave the Denomination of <HI>The twelve Apostles;</HI> and the chiefest of them he call'd in a derision, <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Some they suffer'd to starve to death, with their Heads compress'd between the cloven Barks of wild Vines; some also they buried alive, and leaving onely their Heads to appear above Ground, bowl'd Iron Bullets at them, and forc'd them to eat one another; besides infinite other hellish Cruelties, too horrid and dreadful to be recounted.</Q></P>

<P>It will not be amiss before we conclude with this Province, to give you a Rela∣tion of the Discourse which hapned <HI>Anno</HI> 1527. between the <HI>Spanish</HI> Commander <HI>Francisco de Monteio</HI> and the <HI>Nicaraguan</HI> Casique <HI>Alquinotex,</HI> who being a hundred and ten years old, told him, <Q>That before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> arrival there, great numbers of his Soldiers perish'd after a strange manner; for after having vomited abun∣dance of Worms, they fell down dead on a sudden: those that escap'd the Con∣tagion differing amongst themselves, made two Parties, which twice Engaging with one another, each of them lost above a hundred and fifty thousand Men. Yet both these Plagues were no ways to be compar'd to the Slaughter which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had made amongst them.</Q></P>
<P>About the same time an <HI>Italian,</HI> call'd <HI>Hieronymo Bonzo,</HI> Lodging with a <HI>Nicara∣guan</HI> Noble-man that understood the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue, was thus set upon by him: <HI>What do not</HI> (<HI>Oh</HI> Christ) <HI>the</HI> Christians <HI>do! they no sooner get their Foot into an</HI> Indian<HI>'s Hut, but they commandingly call for Maiz, Honey, Winter-Clothes, Gold, Silver, and a Woman to cool their lustful desires: Certainly there is nothing more vicious on Earth.</HI> To which <HI>Bonzo</HI> gave him this Answer: <HI>The wicked</HI> Spaniards <HI>commit oftentimes unseemly things.</HI> The <HI>Indian</HI> again suddenly retorted, saying, <HI>Where are any such Men to be found as good</HI> Spaniards? <HI>I have never known any but wicked Villains.</HI> To which <HI>Bonzo</HI> said, <HI>Why have you made place for them on</HI> Nicaragua?

To which purpose they made ready Bowes, Arrows, Lances, Stones, Clubs, and other Weapons of War: But when it came to the trial, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse, of which they had never seen the like, struck such a terror into the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they fled, and sent two Agents to <HI>Monteio</HI> to desire Peace; but their Design was onely to gain time, that they might gather new Forces, to venture a second Encounter; which prov'd as fatal to them as the first. Then desiring Peace once more, they gather'd all that were able to bear Arms, and swore one to another not to stir a Foot; and withal made a Law, That whosoever did shrink should be kill'd immediately: But the Women being inform'd hereof, begg'd that they might rather suffer under the <HI>Spanish</HI> Yoke, than be torn in pieces by their Dogs, or kill'd by their Bullets and Swords, alledging, that they were not able to resist the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and entreated them, that if they were resolv'd to go on with their first Design, they would first send their Wives and Chil∣dren to the other World, that so they might not fall into the hands of the merci∣less and bloody <HI>Christians:</HI> Whereupon most Voices judg'd it convenient to make use of the Opportunity, and to submit to <HI>Monteio.</HI> But his cruel deal∣ings made some to contradict that Determination, for which they paid dearly; for not onely they, but their little Infants, were put to the most cruel

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns of note.</NOTE>The Towns of chief note are 1. <HI>Guatimala,</HI> now call'd <HI>St. Jago de Guatimala</HI> since the re-building thereof; for about the Year 1586. it was almost buried in Ashes, which one of the neighboring Mountains, for the space of six Moneths together, conti∣nually belch'd out in such fearful quantities, that many People were slain, the old City deserted, and a new one built in another place. The day before this sad Accident hapned, the neighboring Mountains were observ'd to shiver, and a great noise was heard from under Ground; which amazing the <HI>Indians,</HI> the news thereof was carried to the Bishop, <HI>Franciscus Moroquin,</HI> who narrowly enquiring into the Causes of these Accidents, and what they might portend, found that a sad Event would suddenly follow, as accordingly it did; for about mid∣night on the eighth of <HI>August, Anno</HI> 1541. such a mighty store of Rain fell, as if the Clouds had been all dissolv'd into Water, which came rowling from the Rocky Mountains with such violence, that it wash'd down great Stones, which carried on by the strength of the Water against the Houses, beat them down; and none could have seen how they were ruin'd, had not the mighty flashes of Light∣ning, follow'd by terrible claps of Thunder, lighted the Night. Some instantly deserting this miserable place, fled up into the Countrey, and there built a new <HI>Guatimala</HI> (as above-mention'd) sur-nam'd <HI>St. Jago,</HI> three Leagues farther towards the East, in a Valley through which flow two Rivers, between two <HI>Vulcans,</HI> or smoaking Mountains, which sometimes vomit forth terrible Flames, mix'd with dreadful Thunder-claps, Ashes, and great Stones, insomuch that the Ground all about it, which is exceeding fruitful, seems to move. There are many of these <HI>Vulcans</HI> in several parts of <HI>America,</HI> as namely at <HI>Arequipa</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> at <HI>Puebla de los Angelos,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Tlascalla</HI> abovesaid, a Mountain of so great heighth, that they are fain to go little less than thirty Leagues turning and wind-before they can reach the top of it, and others in several other places. They are ge∣nerally Mountains of great heighth, and running sharp upwards, but at the top containing some quantity of plain and level Ground; in the midst whereof is a Pit or Hole, out of which abundance of Smoak and fiery Sparkles are vomited almost continually, and so deep, that they are suppos'd for the most part to reach to the very bottom of the Mountain. Some of these <HI>Vulcans</HI> cast forth neither Fire not Smoak, yet are clearly seen to burn at the bottom with a quick Fire, and which is so extreamly hot, that it instantly melteth Iron, or any other Metal that is cast into it, as by experience hath been found: for some conceiving that the Matter which maintains these Fires within the Bowels of the Earth so long together, can be no∣thing else but melted Gold, have endeavor'd several times to extract and draw it forth in certain Vessels of Iron and Brass, which they have caus'd to be let down into the bottom of the <HI>Vulcan</HI> or Pit, by long Iron Chains made on purpose: but, as we said, the extream heat and force of the Fire below always melted them before they could be drawn up again, and by that means hath rendred all such Attempts frustrate. In this Town, now call'd <HI>St. Jago,</HI> reside above six hundred <HI>Spanish</HI> Com∣manders,
<PB N="237" REF="150"/>and more than twenty five thousand <HI>Indians</HI> which pay Tribute. They have also a brave Church and two Cloysters, one belonging to the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> and another to the Order <HI>La Merced,</HI> and likewise a noble Hospital. Not far from thence is a place call'd <HI>Yzaleos,</HI> where there are Orchards of <HI>Cacoa</HI> two Leagues in square, each of them producing yearly as much as fifty thousand Men are able to carry. They reckon the <HI>Cacao</HI> by <HI>Contels,</HI> which is the number of four hundred; by <HI>Xequipiles,</HI> of eight thousand; and by <HI>Carga's,</HI> of twenty four thousand. In this County is a Mountain, whose top smoaking continually consumes by degrees, and oftentimes covers the neighboring Countrey with Ashes. The Water which flows from the same differs very much, for some of it is wholsom and fit to drink; some foul and stinking, and some turns Wood, if laid in the same▪ to Stone. Here is also the Beast whose Head is highly esteem'd for the <HI>Bezoar</HI>-Stone, which it car∣ries in the same. Here is likewise a little Bear, which in stead of a Mouth, hath a long Nose with a round Hole in it, and a hollow Tongue, with which it sucks Honey, and disturbs the Nests of Pismires. The Women in this Place make curi∣ous Earthen Ware, colour'd either red or black with the Mud of two several Brooks. The <HI>Indians</HI> call'd the boyling Fountains in this County <HI>Hell,</HI> because they bubble up a Bowes-shot high, and make the River <HI>Caliente,</HI> which, notwithstand∣ing it hath pass'd half a League through a wide Channel, retains its exceeding heat. Not far from it lies a Stone, which having a Crack in the middle, sends forth a thick Damp, and against bad Weather a thundering noise. On the Moun∣tains grow exceeding large Trees especially Oak.

<P>Round about the Village <HI>Guaymoco</HI> grow great Balsom-Trees, which afford Timber of fifty five Foot long. From this Village leads a Way to the City <HI>Salva∣dor,</HI> near which the fore-mention'd River <HI>Guachapa</HI> runs with so many windings, that the Traveller is forc'd to cross the same several times before he can come to the Foot of a Mountain which formerly cast out terrible Flames; but now the combustible Matter being consum'd, there appears onely a great Hole on the top, with Ashes in a large compass round about it. At the Foot of the same are two Pits, one of which smoaks continually in such a manner, that it stifles all those that ap∣proach it; yet the Mountain is well overspread with Cedars and Pine-Trees.</P>
<P>Three Leagues farther lies the Village <HI>Nixapa;</HI> and not far from thence the
<PB N="238" REF="151"/>Hill <HI>Elmal Pais,</HI> which consists of great Stones and Ashes, wonderfully mixt toge∣ther: No less wonderful is a Brook which flows in the Night till Morning, and then sinks into the Ground: And in the Countrey <HI>Choluteca</HI> is another, which hides it self at Noon, and appears again towards Night. The Cavern which formerly produc'd Fire and Smoke, now affords good Water to the Village <HI>Curcatan,</HI> and City <HI>Salvador:</HI> Near the Village <HI>Yztepegve</HI> are five Springs, which cast up Allom and Sulphur. The Natives <HI>Chontales</HI> which speak several Languages, flock to the Village <HI>Mimilla,</HI> to make Offerings; not far from hence are two Pits, one of which is full of boyling Water, and the other as cold as Ice: Moreover, <HI>Cocori</HI> lies near a high Mountain, on the top of which is a very turbulent Lake.</P>

<P>The good conveniency of the Haven <HI>Fonseca,</HI> induc'd some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to make a new Passage from the side of the Southern Ocean, to the Northern, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> designing it to reach from the said Haven <HI>Fonseca,</HI> unto <HI>Puerto de Carellos,</HI> which are distant one from the other forty five Leagues; most of it good way, except some over-grown Mountains, which might be made passable with little trouble; to which purpose they built the Town <HI>Buena Esperan∣ca,</HI> yet nevertheless the Work remain'd unprosecuted.</P>
<P>There are moreover reckon'd as appertaining to <HI>Guatimala,</HI> the small Provinces <HI>Soconusco, Suchitepec,</HI> and <HI>Chilulteca,</HI> the chief of them being <HI>Soconusco,</HI> to which be∣longs the Town of <HI>Gevetlan,</HI> where the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governor hath his Residence; the rest seem to be onely small Territories about Towns of the same Name, in like manner as St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> and St. <HI>Miguel</HI> before-mention'd.</P>

About five hundred years ago, or more, according to the account of the <HI>Mexican Annals,</HI> divers Hoards, as they are call'd, of these <HI>Chichi∣mecae,</HI> weary, it seems, of their Woods and subterraneous dwellings, issu'd out into the more open Air, and fell down in huge multitudes into these Southerly parts of <HI>America,</HI> which are now call'd <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>New-Spain;</HI> not all at once, but at se∣veral times, and under several names, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Suchimilci, Chalcae, Tepanecae, Tlascal∣tecae,</HI> and others, who subduing or driving out the People they found in those parts, Seated themselves in their room: And though at first every Nation or Company of them, as they came, seiz'd upon some Province apart by themselves, and held it, as it were, in Soveraignty to themselves, without acknowledgement of any de∣pendance or subjection to their Neighbors, or those that were there before them; yet in Tract of time, and by fortune of the Wars, which they made one upon an∣other, they fell under the Government of one King, <HI>viz.</HI> the King of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which was the chief City of the Province.</P>

This being a business of their Satanical Religion, and <HI>Motezuma</HI> a Prince extremely Superstitious and Devoted to the Service of his gods, it is said, that he Sacrific'd commonly, one year with another, twenty thousand Men, and some years, upon extraordinary occasions, not less than fifty thousand: So great and grievous a Tyranny, by the just Judgement and Permission of Almighty God, for their great and unnatural sins, did the Enemy of Mankind exercise upon them.

The Worm it self being white, after the Skin is carefully pull'd off, put in cold Water or Ashes, and so dry'd, becomes <HI>Cochinele.</HI> The best sort of it is to be had in <HI>Tlascala,</HI> and that in so great a quantity, that no less than five or six hundred <HI>Arrobes</HI> of <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Measure (each <HI>Arrobe</HI> is as much as five <HI>English</HI> Bushels) is yearly Transported thence. The other sort, which grows on the Mountains, and that which is not so carefully gather'd, call'd <HI>Chichimecas,</HI> Dyes not so well as the right <HI>Cochinele.</HI> The <HI>Tunas</HI> also bears a Fruit long and whitish, with a smooth Shell, and full of lit∣tle Seeds like Figs: The red, which are inferior in taste to the white, colours the Urine red.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pine-Apples.</NOTE>The Pine-Apples which grow here differ from the <HI>Spanish,</HI> for the Pulp is not inclos'd in a Shell: They have a pleasant smell, and a Pulp, which if eaten much of, causes an Appetite, it being of a tartish taste; they keep good a long time when Salted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit Cacao.</NOTE>But much more beneficial is the <HI>Cacao,</HI> with which Fruit <HI>New Spain</HI> drives a great Trade; nay, serves for Coin'd Money. When they deliver a Parcel of <HI>Cacao,</HI> they tell them by five, thirty, and a hundred. Their Charity to the Poor never exceeds above one <HI>Cacao</HI>-Nut.

When the <HI>English</HI> Commander <HI>Thomas Candish</HI> coming into the Haven <HI>Guatulco,</HI> burnt two hundred thousand Tun of <HI>Cacao,</HI> it prov'd no small loss to all <HI>New Spain,</HI> the Provinces <HI>Guatimala</HI> and <HI>Nicaragua</HI> not producing so much in a whole year.

Amongst the four sorts the chiefest is <HI>Quathuitl,</HI> of an indiffent heighth, and full of sharp-pointed Leaves, which are fast to the Boughs without Stalks, and bears a great Flower of a yellowish colour, which fal∣ling off, leaves long, tough, and hairy Threds behind them, out of which grows the <HI>Cacavently,</HI> a Fruit which is oval, heavy like a Melon, of a Saffron-colour, of a fat and thick Juice, a bitterish, yet pleasant taste, and very cooling; being dry'd in the Sun it is thereby made fit to keep; it is likewise highly esteem'd, because the <HI>Cho∣colate</HI> is made of the same. Before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made themselves Masters of <HI>Mexico,</HI> no other Drink was esteem'd but that of the <HI>Cacao;</HI> none caring for Wine, not∣withstanding the Soil produces Vines every where in great abundance of it self.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the People.</NOTE>The Natives of the Countrey are very ingenious in divers mechanical Arts, especially in making of Feather-Pictures, a piece of Curiosity wherein they are held to be incomparably, or rather inimitably excellent; and so industrious at it, that al∣though the <HI>Americans</HI> generally are not a People over-much addicted to any kind of Labor or Study, yet at this they will sit a whole day together, without either Meat or Drink, onely out of a natural affection they have to the Work, and a desire to be excellent in it; The Countrey indeed affords them great variety of Birds and other Fowl, of most rare and exquisite Colours, which is a great advantage to their Skill, and helps much to the accomplishment of their Work. They Paint likewise very curiously upon their Cottons; and are held to be generally the best Goldsmiths in the World; of most perfect skill in the purging and refining of all sorts of Metals, but especially of Gold and Silver: And yet in other things so strangely stupid and ignorant, that when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> first appeared amongst them, not a few of them (as 'tis reported) took the Horse and Man both for one Crea∣ture; and when the Horse Neighed, they would enquire very seriously what he said.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Countrey.</NOTE>This Countrey is both large and rich, containing not much less than one hun∣dred and thirty Leagues, both in length and breadth; and if it yields any thing to <HI>Peru</HI> in the plenty of Gold and Silver, 'tis certain it much excels it in many other Commodities; as namely, in all sorts of Fruits, abundance of Cattel, plenty of Corn and Grain; in all which, the advantage this Countrey hath, not only of <HI>Pe∣ru,</HI> but of all the other Provinces of <HI>America</HI> beside, is well known: Not to speak any thing of the great plenty and variety of good Fish, which both the Rivers and Lakes of this Countrey afford, which is very great; insomuch, that the very Tri∣bute of the one Lake of <HI>Mexico</HI> is said to yield an Income of above twenty thousand Crowns yearly, one with another.</P>
<P>The People of the Countrey are generally Industrious and Active, especially since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came among them; rich Merchants, if they apply themselves to it; and they say likewise good Soldiers, when they are train'd and imploy'd that way.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chief Towns of <HI>Mexicana.</HI></NOTE>The chief Towns and places of the Province are, 1. <HI>Mexico,</HI> both anciently and at present, the Metropolis and Capital City; being the Seat of an Archbishop, and the ordinary Residence of the Vice-Roy, and chief Governors of <HI>New-Spain.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the City <HI>Mexico.</HI></NOTE>This City, by the <HI>Indians</HI> was formerly call'd <HI>Tenustatan,</HI> lies in nineteen Degrees and a half to the Northward of the <HI>Equinoctial-Line,</HI> rais'd out of a brackish Lake, full of muddy Water; whose circumference along the Mountains is seventy Leagues: This Lake swarms continually with Boats, which carry the People to and again from one inhabited Island to another; four Stone-bridges, no less cost∣ly than artificial, with Arches and Gates in several places, lead from the City to the Main Continent.</P>
<P>The fresh Water which they have in the City <HI>Mexico,</HI> is led into the same through Pipes that lie in the bottom of the Lake; but none are to enjoy the benefit thereof, before they have paid a certain Sum of Money to the King's Collectors.</P>
<P>Moreover, the City divided into Islands, contains above sixty thousand Houses, which being built on several Isles, have large Bridges, which reach from one to ano∣ther; some that lie in the middle of the Lake, they approach in little Boats; round about the Lake, especially where the way leads from the Continent into the City, lie several Suburbs, all inclos'd with Walls; between which stand strong Towers, cover'd on the top: To keep off the force of the Water, the <HI>Tenustatans</HI> have with great labor and charge, made a Bank through the Lake, half way along the City: But the Lake <HI>Laguna,</HI> from whose bottom <HI>Mexico</HI> is rais'd, is divided in two parts, the <HI>Sweet Lake,</HI> which is higher than the <HI>Salt,</HI> falls in to the same through Sluces, with Bridges built on the Bank that leads from the City to the main Land: The <HI>Salt-Lake,</HI> which hath brackish and bitter Water, ebbs and flows according as the Wind blows; no Fish is able to live in the same, because the Water which in the sight of <HI>Mexico</HI> falls into the same out of the Mountains, hath a sulphury Ground: All along the shore, much Salt is made, with which the Citizens drive a great Trade: There are continually above a hundred thousand Boats (by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Acales,</HI> and by the <HI>Spaniards, Canoos</HI>) going off and on from one shore to another: The fresh Water Lake, which is bigger than the salt, and feeds small Fishes, hath above fif∣ty
<PB N="244" REF="158"/>Suburbs about the same, of which, some boast five thousand, and others ten thousand Houses: Nay, the Suburb <HI>Tescuco,</HI> in former times was no way inferior to <HI>Mexico</HI> in bigness; since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have been Masters of this City, they stopt up many Moats, to inlarge their narrow Streets.</P>
<P>Besides three publick Markets, every open place affords all sorts of Provisions daily; the <HI>Indians</HI> call the Markets <HI>Tianguystly,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards, Tianguez;</HI> the first and chiefest stands in <HI>Tatelulco,</HI> adorn'd with Galleries on three sides; in the mid∣dle of this Square, which is accounted the biggest in the World, stands next to the place of Execution, a stately Fountain; the Tents which are every Week pitch'd up here for Trade, amount to above thirty thousand. The second Market call'd St. <HI>John's,</HI> is in <HI>Mexico,</HI> and swarms continually with People. The third is call'd <HI>Hipolito,</HI> from the <HI>Guardian-Saint</HI> of the City, whither every Wednesday and Thurs∣day comes such a multitude of People, that this spacious Market is too little for them; for the sale of every Commodity, a peculiar corner is allotted; but great Packs are left to be dispos'd of in Boats, which lie near the shore.</P>
<P>At the four corners of the City, at present call'd St. <HI>John, St. Maria la Rotonda, St. Pablo,</HI> and <HI>St. Sebastian,</HI> are above four thousand <HI>Spanish</HI> Families, and thirty thousand <HI>Indians,</HI> besides what inhabit <HI>Tatelulco,</HI> now <HI>St. Jago.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tempe∣rature of the Air.</NOTE>The Air in this place is very strange; in the day time, the Sky is generally Se∣rene; the North Wind against the Evening brings Rain, of which the Mountain <HI>Tepeaquilla</HI> lying a little League beyond the City, gives certain Testimonies; for when a black Cloud appears on the top thereof, it is certain to be blown from thence over <HI>Mexico</HI> with Rain: After a moist Evening follows a Star-light Night, and a pleasant Morning: From <HI>September</HI> till <HI>May,</HI> it is generally dry Weather here, but if it chances to Rain▪ the Rain is attended with a Storm, which occasions a sulphurous Fogg, very unwholsom, and so dark, that one Man cannot di∣scern another, and causes a pain through all the Limbs, nay sometimes Death it self; wherefore, when soe're it approaches, every one keeps close in his House, or goes into the Countrey.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is worthy of observation, how strangely this City is alter'd since its being Conquer'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and especially when <HI>Anno</HI> 1629. it was over∣flow'd by a mighty Deluge; which alteration by <HI>Barnabe Cabo,</HI> in a Letter to the <HI>Jesuite Hernande Leon,</HI> is thus set forth:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Baruabe Cabo</HI> his Descri∣ption of <HI>Mexico.</HI></NOTE><HI>Mexico,</HI> says he, lying in a Valley between high Mountains, hath seventy Leagues in circumference: The Valley being Oval, is for the most part inter∣spers'd with Lakes, which the <HI>Indians,</HI> and after them the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have digg'd, only the Lake which washes <HI>Mexico</HI> is natural; and to stop the Water-falls, there are Banks and Sluces every where: The Flood before <HI>Mexicalcingo</HI> flows a Fathom and a half higher than before <HI>Mexico.</HI> The four other Lakes to the Northward have much more Water than the <HI>Mexicalcingo,</HI> of which, some have scarce four, others but three Leagues in circumference; when as <HI>Mexicalcingo's</HI> Lake reckons fifteen, and <HI>Mexico's</HI> sixteen. On the breaking of the Banks, <HI>Mexico</HI> hath often suffer'd great damage, wherefore the Vice-Roy <HI>de Valesco</HI> took special care to make a vent for the Water through the lowest Mountains; whereupon the Countrey being Sur∣vey'd, the Northern Coast near the Village <HI>Gueguenoca,</HI> was found to be the most convenient. But about the manner of letting the Water out, the Surveyors could no ways agree; most of them were of opinion to dig Channels, into which the Lakes might discharge their Waters; others, thought best to make a Gutter under Ground, which last <HI>Velasca</HI> put in hand with unhappy success, because the Labo∣rers who under-min'd the Ground, were choak'd with the falling in of the Sand,
<PB N="245" REF="158"/>or stifled with the sulphurous Vapors rising out of the Earth: Nevertheless, they gave not over the Work, though they began it quite another way, for a <HI>French</HI>-Man, call'd <HI>Henry Martin,</HI> advis'd to deepen the River <HI>Quaiotitlan,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Laguna,</HI> and by that means make it a Bay, into which the <HI>Laguna</HI> might pour her over-charg'd Waters: Which design, though contradicted by the Jesuit <HI>John Sanchez,</HI> was put in practice; by which means the Water fell in a short time so much, that they could walk dry to the Cliff <HI>El Ponnel,</HI> lying a League from the City; where∣fore they continually labour'd on this Work, till such time as <HI>Conde de Getues</HI> came over for Vice-Roy, who judg'd the Charge to be unnecessary, nay Commanded the Ditches to be broken down, which stopt the Water along the Silver Mines of <HI>Pachuca,</HI> that he might see exactly how much it would over-flow <HI>Mexico:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mexico</HI> over∣flow'd.</NOTE> After which the Flood rose yearly higher and higher; till at last, <HI>Anno</HI> 1629. a mighty Rain falling, swole the <HI>Laguna</HI> in such a manner, that it over-whelm'd all <HI>Mexico,</HI> wash'd down the Houses, all Merchandizes which could not endure the Water, were spoil'd, and had not they had innumerable Boats to help them, thousands of People might have perish'd in this Deluge: But at last, <HI>Henry Martin</HI> restor'd again the fore-mention'd Channel to its former Perfection, and brought the Flood which fell down out of the Mountains within the Banks of the River.</P>
<P><HI>Quantitlan</HI> digg'd also a Channel of eight thousand Fathom long, and made an Arch'd Sewer under Ground of the same length, which Sewer hath at every two hundred Fathoms distance, Vent-holes, and a hole of sixty Fathom deep, and by this means, diverting abundance of Water, they dry'd <HI>Mexico</HI> in a short time: When the Banks and Streets began no sooner to appear, but they fell to work to raise the Ground, and to lay Bridges, and also to build more Boats. The Citizens like∣wise found it convenient to make another deep Sewer for the carrying away of more Water, notwithstanding it requir'd twenty years labor. The River, which in a manner runs through the middle of the City, is curb'd by a Wall; a crooked Bridge, with many Arches, and of a long extent, leads to the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stately Pala∣ces.</NOTE> in which stand many brave Palaces, with pleasant Walks of Trees about them; the Cloysters of several Orders of Fryers, appear with high Spires and Turrets, above all other Buildings.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And Mona∣steries.</NOTE>The <HI>Franciscans</HI> have here four very sumptuous Buildings: The first, Consecrated to St. <HI>Francis,</HI> stands in the uppermost part of <HI>Mexico,</HI> within a large square Court, and on each a pleasant Walk of Trees: The Cloyster it self is very high, and treb∣ble Wall'd, with Towers and Galleries about it: In the middle of the City stands another Tower'd-Cloyster, call'd St. <HI>Jago.</HI> The third lies a little distance from it, which being built long, hath a stately Turret, and is call'd <HI>Maria de Rodon∣da.</HI> The fourth, not far from the first, but much smaller, is nam'd <HI>San Diego;</HI> these belong to the <HI>Franciscans.</HI> The <HI>Augustin</HI> Monks are also no way inferior to the <HI>Fran∣ciscans,</HI> for magnificent Structures, with spacious Halls, high Towers, and rich Balconies: The first is denominated from St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> just behind which appears <HI>San Pabla,</HI> less stately than the rest. St. <HI>Sebastian,</HI> near the <HI>Laguna,</HI> is built in manner like a Church, whose Tower ends like a Pyramid. The Cloyster <HI>San Cruz,</HI> belong∣ing also to the <HI>Augustines,</HI> built square, stands near the Market, in the middle of which stands a stately Fountain: The Court within inviron'd with thick Walls, amazes the beholders by the pleasantness of its situation.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Dominicans</HI> inhabit two brave Cloysters; the chiefest Dedicated to St. <HI>Dominic,</HI> is eight square; to which is adjoyning a pretty large Church, with a Steeple: The second, which stands on one side of <HI>St. Jago,</HI> and consists of three se∣veral Structures, is call'd <HI>Collegio de Porta Coeli,</HI> Opposite to <HI>St. Jago,</HI> near the great

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vice-Roy's Palace and Arch-bishop's Seat.</NOTE>The Residence of the Vice-Roy which lies near the <HI>Dominican</HI> Cloyster, <HI>Porto Coe∣li,</HI> is so sumptuous a Structure, that it may stand in competition with any of those Edifices which were so much cry'd up by the Ancients; nevertheless, it is not to be compar'd to the Arch-bishop's Seat, built round like a Theatre, whose Luster ex∣presses the Quality of him that inhabits the same, he being Governor of the Bi∣shopricks of <HI>Fascala, Guaxaca, Mechaocan, New Galicia, Chiapa, Yucatan, Guatimala, Ve∣rapaz,</HI> and the <HI>Philippinas.</HI> This marvellous Structure was begun by <HI>Ferdinand Corte∣sius,</HI> but was finish'd by <HI>Sebastian Ramires de Fuenleal;</HI> and not much inferior there∣unto is the <HI>Casa de Cabildo Alameda.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The gallantry of <HI>Mexico</HI> at this day.</NOTE>At present, <HI>Mexico</HI> is thought to be one of the richest Cities of the World, abounding (if reports be true) in all kind of voluptuous gallantry and bravery, even to excess: It is suppos'd to contain about six or seven Miles in compass, and to consist of above an hundred thousand Houses or Families, whereof not the tenth part <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but those that are, all Gentlemen, at least as to their garb and manner of living; for they live most splendidly in all respects, both for Diet and Apparel.</P>
<P>For the first, we have spoken so much already of the general plenty of all things in the Kingdom of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> that pertain to this part of pleasure, that it is not to be doubted: And for the second this may be some instance, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is no ex∣traordinary matter to see an Hat-band or Role all of Diamonds, in some ordinary Gentlemans Hat; and of Pearl among the common Citizens and Tradesmen. The Coaches (which most Gentlemen keep) almost cover'd with Gold and Silver, richly beset with Precious Stones, and within ordinarily lin'd with Cloth of Gold, or the best <HI>China</HI> Silk that can be gotten; of which Coaches, in time of year, at the <HI>Alameda,</HI> as they call it, which is, as it were, <HI>The Hide-Park of Mexico,</HI> and a place made of purpose for recreation and delight, a Man shall observe not seldom, above a thousand or two thousand Coaches, full of Ladies and Gallants coming thither onely to take the Air, and their Pleasure, both the one and the other attended with a numerous Train of Servants and <HI>Mulattoes</HI> of both Sexes. In <HI>la Plateria,</HI> which is
<PB N="247" REF="159"/>but onely one Street in <HI>Mexico,</HI> nigh to the Vice-Roy's Palace, in less than half an hours space: with the turn of an Eye, you may see Millions of Wealth in Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones, in the Goldsmiths and Jewellers Shops thereabouts. In a word, there is nothing hinders <HI>Mexico</HI> from being the most absolute City in the World for delight and bravery, but onely two Inconveniences to which it is subject: The one is the danger of the Lake, with the Infalls whereof it may seem to be almost continually threatned, and in the Year 1629. did actually suffer a very great calamity, the Waters breaking through the Banks, and drowning a great part of the City, with the destruction of much People, and the loss of all their Goods intirely, through the avarice (as is suppos'd) of the Vice-Roy that then was, and some other of the King's Officers, who diverted the Money that should have been employ'd for the fortifying and repairing of the Banks, to their own proper uses: The other is from the nature of the Soil and Ground it self on which it standeth; which is found to have a tincture of <HI>Sal</HI> Nitre in it, somewhat strong; and the Winds partly from the Lake it self, and partly from the Hills about it, rai∣sing the Dust of this Earth constantly every Evening, for many Moneths of the Year together, so violently, that the Air is even darkned therewith for some time: The Inhabitants are much annoy'd by it, and made subject to divers Hypocondria∣cal Pains and Infirmities, and sometimes kill'd with it, especially such as either cannot, or care not much to avoid it.</P>
<P>The City lieth about sixty Leagues, or a hundred and fifty Miles distant from the <HI>Atlantick</HI> or North Sea, from whence by the Port of <HI>St. John d' Ullua,</HI> or <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> (which are the usual Landing-places) there is a fair and easie March to <HI>Mexico,</HI> by the Cities of <HI>Xalabar, Perotta, Puebla de los Angelos,</HI> and <HI>Tlascalla,</HI> all of them open and unfortifi'd Places, (as likewise <HI>Mexico</HI> it self) arid the Countrey round about very rich and well accommodated with all things.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Chulula.</HI></NOTE>The next City of note in ancient times was <HI>Chulula,</HI> which being built in a fruit∣ful Plain, had above twenty thousand Dwelling-houses, and as many more Ban∣quetting-houses. The number of the Temples and Turrets were equal with that of the days in the Year: The Government thereof belong'd to a Mayor and six Aldermen, and one chief Priest; for they never went upon the least Design before they had been at their Devotion; in which the Priest's Office was onely to perfume the Idols four times in twenty four hours, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Morning, at Noon, after Sun-set, and at Midnight; at which times none durst be absent, but they us'd also a cruel Exercise on themselves, and one much more cruel on others, for on usual Feast-days they abstain'd from Meat, Drink, and Sleep, scourg'd their Bodies with knotted Cords after a miserable manner, evacuated their Seed, that so they might curb all fleshly Desires, and met every Night in a spacious place, where sit∣ting down they wounded themselves with Lances in their Legs and Arms, so long till the Blood gush'd out of the same; which gathering in a Cup, they anointed their Temples therewith, and dipt the Lances in the same, and then hung them up before the Temple in Bundles of Straw. Of these were a great number, and the more, because they never us'd their Lances but once. But on these Days, which were Consecrated to the Idol <HI>Tezcatlipuca,</HI> every one besides the Priests wore a new Rope made of the Hemp <HI>Mangey,</HI> of a Fathom long, and a thick Knot at the end, with which they beat themselves so miserably on their Backs, as if they intended to have broken them: After which the Priests stay'd five days in the Temple, in which they us'd the like cruelty, eating scarce once in twenty four hours.</P>
<P>Their Prisoners they us'd after a most horrid manner, <HI>viz.</HI> in their Temples stood a round Stage of Stone; to the top of which they ascended by a Square Scaf∣fold,
<PB N="248" REF="160"/>supported by twenty eight Pillars; behind which appear'd thousands of Mens Heads, and amongst them the Prisoners that were to be Offer'd sat stark naked, and guarded by several Armed Men; three Foot from the Steps which led up to the top of the Scaffold, stood a pyramidical Stone, (by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Quauxi∣calli</HI>) and behind it two round Chappels, cover'd on the top like Mitres, each had four Holes in a large Gate, in which sat a horrid Representation, worshipp'd by six Priests call'd <HI>Chackalmua,</HI> whereof one call'd <HI>Papas,</HI> or <HI>Topilzin,</HI> whose Office was to pluck out the Hearts of the Prisoners, being in greatest esteem, wore a red Man∣tle about his Body, not unlike a long Coat, with broad Fringe, which trail'd af∣ter him upon the Ground, and also a Crown of green and yellow Plumes on his Head; his Ears and under Lip were likewise adorn'd with Precious Stones: The other five appear'd in like manner with their Hands and Faces painted red, but ha∣ving Leathern <HI>Fascia's</HI> about their Heads, and white Coats stitch'd with Black on their Bodies, they might easily be distinguish'd from the <HI>Topilzin;</HI> who on a sudden ran down the Stairs to the Prisoners, and shew'd each of them an Image, (saying, <HI>This is your God</HI>) made of <HI>Bledo</HI> Paste, <HI>Maiz</HI> and Honey, green Beads for Eyes, and Grains of <HI>Maiz</HI> for Teeth: whereupon the Prisoners were led up, and laid with their Backs on the sharp Stone <HI>Quauxicalli;</HI> then the five Priests took hold of their Leggs, Arms and Head, put woodden Collars about the Sufferer's Necks, whilst the <HI>Topilzin</HI> shew'd Reverence to the Idol; which done, with a sharp Stone he cut open the Breasts of the Prisoners, who in a deplorable condition lay on the pyra∣midical Stone, and pulling their Hearts out of their Bodies, shew'd the same reek∣ing to the Sun, and at last threw them toward the Idol, and the dead Bodies down the Stairs, where some appointed for that purpose carried the same away; but eve∣ry one taking his own Prisoner, and roasting and boyling him, serv'd him up to his Friends as a great Dainty.</P>
<P>This kind of Murdering was not onely us'd amongst the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> but also by all the other neighboring <HI>Indians,</HI> and especially in the City <HI>Chulula,</HI> which (as we have said before) signifies <HI>The Sanctity of all the Gods:</HI> for in this Town six thousand Children were yearly Offer'd.</P>
<P>The Citizens hereof us'd to drive a great Trade, especially in <HI>Cochinele.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Foundation of the City of <HI>Mexico.</HI></NOTE>Concerning the erecting of this City, the <HI>Indians</HI> relate thus: That the seventh Family of the <HI>Navatlaca's,</HI> Extracted out of the Countrey <HI>Aztlan,</HI> rang'd up and down not without thousands of Inconveniences, from one Countrey to another, according to the Information which their Sages had given their Spirit <HI>Viztliputli,</HI> till at last some of the Priests straying from the Army, or rather Multitude, got into a Wilderness, full of Brambles and Thorns, and came at length to a Place where was a Spring of clear Water, in which the Fishes glitter'd like Silver; where ta∣king up their repose that Night, their Spirit inform'd the oldest of them in a Dream, that they should find thereabouts a <HI>Tunal</HI> Tree (whose Leaves grow out of one another) under which, on a Stone, lay the Heart of the famous Sorcerer <HI>Copil:</HI> This <HI>Tunal</HI> Tree should be discover'd by a Crane on the top of it, which in one Foot should hold a Bird, and in the other a Bough of the Tree, near which they were to build a City: The old Priest waking, and relating his Dream, every one endeavor'd to find out the fore-mention'd Tree; at last they found it, by discover∣ing on the top a Crane, with spread-out Wings looking up towards the Sun, and holding in his Claws a small Bird, invested with curious Feathers: Whereupon they with all speed built a Chappel of Turf and Clods of Earth, and cover'd the same with Canes, to keep their Idol from the Weather, resolving, so soon as they could, to build him a better Temple.</P>
<P>The Lake on whose Isles they setled, abounded with Fish and Fowls, which they exchang'd with the neighboring People for Stone and Mortar for the building of a Temple for <HI>Viztliputzli,</HI> and a new City; to which they made a Cawsey in the Lake <HI>Laguna,</HI> and divided it into four great Wards or Divisions, and subdivided them again into lesser; over which they plac'd peculiar Idols, and order'd a Crane like that which they had seen on the <HI>Tunal</HI> Tree to be their City Arms. The dividing of the Wards occasion'd great dislike amongst the Grandees, judging those to whose lot they fell, not to be worthy of them; wherefore deserting the same, and tra∣velling along the Lake <HI>Laguna,</HI> they setled themselves at last in a sandy Soil, which they call'd <HI>Tlattellulco,</HI> and entertain'd a bitter hatred against their Countrey-men who kept the four Wards of the new <HI>Tenustitan,</HI> doing them all the mischief they could; wherefore the Assaulted were necessitated to chuse a King, that they might be the better able to oppose their Enemies: But that they might not raise a Dis∣content amongst themselves about electing a Governor, they judg'd it fittest to take a Foreigner; amongst whom they found none so capable of so great an Office as

<P>The new King was no sooner Crown'd, but he settled all things in order with great Prudence, insomuch, that <HI>Mexico</HI> grew daily to be more famous and fear'd: But this sudden growth rais'd a jealousie amongst the Neighbors, who dreaded their growing Power and Valor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings between the <HI>Tapuneca's</HI> and <HI>Mexi∣cans.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Tapunecans</HI> who were also a valiant People, being the nearest to them, and having <HI>Azcapuzalco</HI> for their chief City, made it their main design, utterly to root out the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> before they grew to be more Populous and Potent; notwith∣standing they had hitherto receiv'd Tribute from them, for delivering the Lake <HI>Laguna</HI> to them, which was a quantity of Timber and Plants; yet they demanded not only more Tribute than formerly, but also in such a manner, as was thought impossible to have been perform'd, which was, that those Plants which were for∣merly brought to them, as growing on the Land, should be set in the Water, so as to come floating to them, as they grew, to <HI>Ascapuzalco,</HI> which if they did not pay, they should expect to be all put to the Sword. The <HI>Mexicans</HI> much amaz'd hereat, and not knowing how to produce the demanded Plants, <HI>Viztliputzli</HI> inform'd the oldest Priest, that the demands might be satisfi'd, and commanded him to throw Earth on the Water, and to Sow Seed on the same, which at the usual time produc'd <HI>Maiz, Azi, Chias, Tomates,</HI> and the like, with which the <HI>Tapunecans</HI> being satisfi'd, de∣mand next a Goose, and a Hen which laid Eggs, out of which the young ones should appear, when on the floating Clods of Earth, the Nests came opposite to <HI>Azcapuzalco,</HI> which by the advice of <HI>Viztliputzli,</HI> they perform'd fifty years one after another. Mean while, <HI>Acamapixtli</HI> (who had inlarg'd <HI>Mexico</HI> with Streets, Palaces, Temples, and Markets) dying, would not name any one to succeed him, but left the choice of the Election to the Commonalty, who Crown'd his Son <HI>Vitzilovitli,</HI> and Marry'd him to the King of <HI>Tapunecans</HI> Daughter, that by that means they might gain his friendship, and be eas'd of their strange Annual Tribute: Where∣upon <HI>Ayauchigual,</HI> the King of <HI>Tapunecans</HI> Daughter being Marry'd to <HI>Vitzilovitli,</HI> was within twelve Moneths deliver'd of a Son, which the Grand-father call'd <HI>Chi∣malpopoca,</HI> which signifies <HI>A Gun which gives Smoke,</HI> and afterwards was satisfi'd with two Geese, and some Fish yearly from the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> onely as an Acknowledgment that they inhabited his Countrey. <HI>Chimalpopoca</HI> loosing his Parents, in his tenth year was Crown'd King, with a Bowe and Arrows in his left Hand, and a Wood∣den Sword in the right: Soon after he oblig'd his Mothers Father to be kind to the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> for they being in great want for fresh Water, he had leave by Channels to bring the same out of the Mountain <HI>Chapultepec,</HI> a League distant from <HI>Mexico;</HI> to which purpose they made a Pipe of Planks, and hollow Trees joyn'd toge∣ther with Clay, quite through the Lake; but this Pipe not being teight and dura∣ble, and the fresh Water by that means mixing with the Salt, they sent Agents to <HI>Az∣capuzalco,</HI> to request Stones, Mortar, and Work-men to make a substantial Sewer: This message was ill resented by the Council of <HI>Azcapuzalco; What,</HI> (said they) <HI>do the</HI> Mexicans <HI>think, shall a rambling company of People, which on Charity live in anothers Countrey, Command those that Govern them to be their Servants?</HI> This grudge went so far, that at last they took a Resolution without the King's knowledge, (for he was sus∣pected, because of his Grand-chil'd <HI>Chimalpopoca</HI>) to forbid all manner of Trade with the <HI>Mexicans;</HI> nay, to endeavor utterly to root them out; yet some judg'd, that they ought to spare <HI>Chimalpopoca,</HI> while others on the contrary said, <HI>That he ought to be destroy'd, because his Father being a</HI> Mexican, <HI>he would to the utmost of his Power defend his People;</HI> which last being approv'd of, so troubled the King of the <HI>Tapune∣cans,</HI>

And whereas till this time the Kings had been serv'd in their Palaces by ordinary Citizens, he took Knights, and the chiefest of the Nobility, intending thereby to make a distinction between the Nobility and the common People, and add more Majesty to the Royal Dignity.

<P>Mean while <HI>Muteczuma</HI> consulted with his Sorcerers to destroy <HI>Cortesius</HI> by Charms, who then was marching through <HI>Chalco,</HI> whereupon a considerable number of Sorce∣rers went thither to the top of a high Mountain, where, as they were beginning their Incantations and Charms, their Idol <HI>Tezcalipuca</HI> appear'd to them: and in an angry manner told them, That <HI>Monteczuma</HI> should lose his Crown and Life; and to con∣firm his words, he shew'd them a dreadful spectacle; for looking about, they saw the City in a light flame. This being told to <HI>Muteczuma,</HI> he resolv'd to make him∣self as secure as he could, and went to meet <HI>Cortesius</HI> with costly Presents, delivering him the Crown in the presence of all his Council; to which purpose he took one <HI>Marina,</HI> experienc'd in the <HI>Castilian</HI> Tongue, with him for his Interpreter; all things then seeming to end in Friendship.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cortesius</HI> marches a∣gainst <HI>Velas∣quez</HI>'s Party.</NOTE>About this time there were certain Ships come to <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> which was a new Port-Town of this Countrey, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had built since their coming thi∣ther, and had Landed near upon a thousand Men; which was an Accident that had like to have spoil'd the Design of <HI>Cortesius</HI> and all his Company at <HI>Mexico,</HI> these Men being sent by <HI>James Velasquez,</HI> Governor of <HI>Cuba,</HI> expressly against <HI>Cortesius</HI> and his Men, upon pretence that they had acted not conformably to the Commission which they had receiv'd from him, and gave him no account of their proceedings; which in a great measure was true: for it must be confess'd, that <HI>Cortesius</HI> and his Men finding themselves to have fall'n upon an Adventure that was certainly rich and good, and having got such footing and interest in the Countrey already, by their Success and Victories, and chiefly by their Confederacy with so many of the Natives and People of the Countrey, revolted to them, did almost at first, by a ge∣neral consent, renounce their Commission, and dependency upon <HI>Velasquez,</HI> and
<PB N="259" REF="166"/>profess'd to act immediately from and for the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> What pretences they had for such a Resolution, seemingly at least irregular, is not so well known. What∣ever they were, they proceed in it, and the whole Company (excepting onely some few, who yet went along with the rest) chuse <HI>Cortesius</HI> anew for their Commander in chief, and appoint likewise by common consent, all other Officers of Justice, both Civil and Military, among themselves: and to give the better colour at Court to their Proceedings, they send <HI>Portocorrero</HI> and <HI>Monteio,</HI> two of their Principals, in∣to <HI>Spain,</HI> with a rich and noble Present to the Emperor, both to make report of the State of the Countrey, and to procure immediate Commission from his Majesty, to proceed; after which they advance towards <HI>Mexico,</HI> as hath been said. <HI>Velasquez,</HI> being at <HI>Cuba,</HI> and understanding their Proceedings, labor'd to intercept both their Messengers and Present, but could not; and therefore sent <HI>Pamphilius Narvaez</HI> with eleven Ships, and about nine hundred or a thousand Men to apprehend <HI>Cortesius,</HI> and oppose his Proceedings. This hapned about the time that the Differences were but newly calm'd betwixt the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the People of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and though it ob∣lig'd <HI>Cortesius</HI> to leave the City in a wavering and unsetled condition, yet he took such order, that <HI>Muteczuma</HI> still remain'd under the Guard of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as before, assisted with thousands of their Friends of <HI>Tlascalla,</HI> and he himself taking the rest, and some few <HI>Spaniards</HI> along with him, with undaunted courage and resolution marches against <HI>Narvaez:</HI> and such was his good fortune, that not onely <HI>Narvaez</HI> be∣came his Prisoner without much blood-shed, but likewise all his Men joyn'd with him in his Design, through the favour of the Chancery or supream Court of <HI>St. Do∣mingo,</HI> and by the procurement of the Licentiat <HI>Vasquez de Ayllon,</HI> a Judge of it, who was sent with <HI>Narvaez</HI> to accommodate the Differences. With this Recruit <HI>Corte∣sius</HI> marches back again to <HI>Mexico;</HI> but at his coming finds things in a very bad con∣dition; for the Citizens, gather'd together under the Command of one <HI>Quicuxte∣moc,</HI> had recourse to Arms, and for three days and three Nights vex'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with continual Stormings, notwithstanding what-ever Commands they had to the contrary from their imprison'd King, who at last, looking out of a Window, endeavoring to appease them, was hurt with a Stone, of which he soon after died, as they say, who would not have the <HI>Spaniards</HI> thought to have murder'd him, as the <HI>Mexicans</HI> say they did, with divers other Noble-men, and some of his Children, the very Night they fled. However it were, not long after his Death, out of extream necessity, and chiefly for want of Victuals, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were forc'd to leave the Ci∣ty in the night-time, and with the loss of four hundred and fifty of their Men, who were either slain or taken Prisoners at the passing of a Draw-bridge, the rest ma∣king a heavy Retreat to their Friends at <HI>Tlascalla.</HI> There is standing at this day in <HI>Mexico,</HI> upon the place where so many of them were kill'd, a certain Hermitage, which they call <HI>Los Martyres,</HI> or <HI>The Hermitage of the Martyrs,</HI> though but improperly, if upon that occasion, as one of their own Writers confesses, though he alledges no other reason.</P>
<P>This Retreat of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> out of <HI>Mexico</HI> hapned to be upon the tenth of <HI>July</HI> after mid-night, in the Year 1520. which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Mexico</HI> call <HI>The Doleful Night.</HI> Nevertheless the undaunted <HI>Cortesius</HI> being got, though with much diffi∣culty and trouble, by reason of the pursuit of the <HI>Mexicans</HI> for a good part of the Way, to his sure Friends of <HI>Tlascalla,</HI> neither lost his Courage, nor gave over his Re∣solution of yet gaining <HI>Mexico,</HI> especially the way being now laid open, and suf∣ficient occasion given by the Death of <HI>Muteczuma,</HI> and the provocations of the <HI>Mexicans</HI> themselves, to make himself absolute and sole Lord of the Place: where∣fore having sent for, and procur'd a competent Supply of fresh Soldiers from

By which means, and by his Army on Land, in a short time he cut off all Provision from the City, and after a Siege of full three Months or more, and a most stout and obstinate resistance made by the People within, in which they are said to have lost above a hundred thousand Men, beside those which perish'd by Famine, Sickness, or otherwise,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mexico</HI> taken by the <HI>Spani∣ards.</HI></NOTE> he took it by Storm upon <HI>Tuesday</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>August</HI> 1521.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds and Description of <HI>Mechoacan</HI></NOTE>THe next Province of <HI>New Spain</HI> is the Bishoprick of <HI>Mechoacan,</HI> which hath on the North-East, <HI>Panuco;</HI> on the East, <HI>Mexicana,</HI> properly so call'd; on the South part, <HI>Tlascalla;</HI> on the West, the Main Ocean, or <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> and last of all, more directly Northward, <HI>Xalisco,</HI> which is a Province of <HI>New Gal∣licia:</HI> The Name signifieth in the <HI>American</HI> Language, as much as <HI>A Fish Countrey;</HI> and so it is, having many fair Lakes and Rivers in it, abundantly well stor'd with Fish. The Countrey so exceedingly pleasant and healthful, that 'tis usual for sick Persons of other Provinces to come hither to recover their health, only by the be∣nefit of a good Air. The Soil so abundantly fertile of all sorts of Grain, that of four measures of Seed, it hath been often observ'd, they have reap'd the next Har∣vest, more than so many hundred measures of the same Grain. Very well Wooded; and by reason of its many Rivers and fresh Springs, equally rich in good Pasture:
<PB N="262" REF="170"/>and besides great plenty of Medicinal Herbs and Plants, it affordeth good store of Amber nigh the Sea Coasts, Mulberry-trees, and consequently Silks; much Ho∣ney, Wax, and divers other Commodities, both for necessity and pleasure. The People of the Countrey are generally tall, of a strong active Body, and a good Wit, especially in comparison of other Natives; not unskilful in divers curious Manufactures, the most excellent Feather-Pictures, afore-mention'd, being said to be found in this Province. They seem more generally inclin'd to the Humors and Customs of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> than any other <HI>Americans;</HI> and receiv'd the Preaching of <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> when time was, with much willingness; so that the Countrey is now entirely <HI>Christian,</HI> and divided into several Parishes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Languages belonging to the <HI>Mechoa∣cans.</HI></NOTE>The Languages which are spoken in <HI>Mechoacan</HI> are several, as the <HI>Otomian, Chihci∣mian,</HI> and the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> which is common through all <HI>New Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Tarascan,</HI> a neat and brief Language, which properly belongs to this Countrey.</P>
<P>The Lions and Wilde Dogs of this Countrey devour great numbers of Cattel yearly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tygers.</NOTE> yet the greatest mischiefs happen from the Tygers, which often fetch Peo∣ple out of their Houses, notwithstanding the Doors are lock'd, for they break in thorow the Walls and Roofs, with much eagerness and strength: Of the great∣ness whereof, <HI>Jacob Bontius</HI> tells us this story, That the Governor <HI>Peter Carpentier</HI> set a Trap without the Walls of <HI>Batavia,</HI> of great Timber, Pleited with Iron, Baiting it with a Goat; which taking effect, the Tyger that was caught therein, impatient of such close Imprisonment, rent the Timber, and getting out, left the Goat un∣touch'd.</P>
<P><HI>Hugo Linschot</HI> relates, That the Tygers in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> hurt no <HI>Spaniards,</HI> exer∣cising their cruelty onely on <HI>Indians;</HI> and that finding a <HI>Black</HI> and a <HI>White</HI> Man sleep∣ing together, they devour the <HI>Black</HI> and not the <HI>White:</HI> How far these assertions deserve to be credited, may appear by an evident contradiction of the first, for it is well known, many <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> have been eaten by the Tygers.</P>
<P>General <HI>Fedreman</HI> marching in this Countrey at the Head of his Army, was as∣saulted by a Tyger, which in despight of them all killing a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and three <HI>In∣dians,</HI> escap'd from them; no Trees serve for a refuge against their fury, for they climb up to the top thereof, and fetch down their Prey; their Claws are so exceeding Venomous, that whoever is scratch'd with the same, is never to be cur'd; there is no Beast but they will venture upon, wherefore they lie in the Bushes, from whence they rush out upon them; but this disadvantage they have, that most other Beasts are too nimble. Footed for them, for they are a very heavy Creature, whatever hath been deliver'd by the Ancients concerning the Tygers swiftness.</P>
<P>As to the difference which they make in Humane Flesh, it is thus far true: That they find more sweetness in Womens Breasts than other parts, and chose a <HI>Black</HI> Man before a <HI>White:</HI> Concerning the first, <HI>France</HI> gives a sufficient testimony, when two Tygers, in the time of King <HI>Lewis</HI> the Twelfth, breaking loose, left a great number of Women lying Breastless in the Road. The second is con∣firm'd by <HI>John Johnston</HI>'s Relation of a strange accident that happen'd in <HI>Bengale, viz.</HI> A <HI>Moor</HI> dreaming that a Tyger fetch'd him out of the Ship, hid himself the next Night between Decks, of which the Master asking the reason, was in∣form'd concerning his Dream, which prov'd prophetick, for about Mid-night a Tyger leapt into the Ship, and devouring the <HI>Moor,</HI> went away without touch∣ing any one of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> of which there were thirty: But a Sea-man walking on the shore escap'd more wonderfully, for a Tyger setting upon him behind, and a Crocrodile before, he leaping from betwixt them, discover'd to the Tyger the Crocodile, to whom the Tyger directly running, and ingaging with the Crocodile,
<PB N="263" REF="170"/>spar'd the Sea-mans life: Notwithstanding the cruelty and mischief of these Ty∣gers, the <HI>Indians</HI> are led by their sottish Superstition to worship them; because, as they say, the Devil often appears to them in that shape.</P>
<P>Besides the Tygers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Squerrils.</NOTE> the Inhabitants of <HI>Mechaocan</HI> are exceedingly molested with Squerrils, which not only carry much Fruit into their Holes, but also under-mine the Houses, so that they often sink or fall on one side, the mischief being the worse, because they increase daily. Most of them bear four young at a time, which on the third day run about for Prey, and can scarce be taken, because of their exceeding swiftness, leaping a great distance from one Tree to another; their Tails serve them on divers occasions; for leaping they use it like a Wing, and at their crossing over a River, for a Sail; in tempestuous Weather, they stop their holes therewith, to keep out the Wind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several kinds of them.</NOTE>There are six several sorts of these Squerrils; the first call'd <HI>Tlilic,</HI> cover them∣selves with their Tails; the second <HI>Quapatchli,</HI> is as big again, and can never be made tame; the third <HI>Techallotl,</HI> with a bald Tail and great Eyes; the fourth <HI>Tal∣mototly,</HI> hath a thick Head, and a Tail full of black and white streaks; the fifth <HI>Qui∣mitchpatlan,</HI> hath a little Head and long Legs, and leaping from one Tree to an∣other, seems to flie; the last sort call'd <HI>Yztactechalotl,</HI> is whitish.</P>
<P>The Foxes do also great mischief here, their Urine smells so horribly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foxes.</NOTE> that forty days after, none are able to abide near the place where they have urin'd, and on whatsoever Stuff or Cloth a drop thereof chanceth to light, the stink can never be wash'd away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bird <HI>Auras.</HI></NOTE>Here breeds also a sort of Birds, call'd <HI>Auras,</HI> which are not unlike Moore-Hens; they flie exceeding high in the Air, feed on nought but stinking Carrion, which they scent at a great distance; they have a hairy Head and Neck, and ugly Face: Some of the Fowls of this Countrey stay here all the year long, others go away, and return at certain times.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingenuity of the Natives.</NOTE>The Natives, since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> coming thither, have gotten their Habits and Language, learn'd all sorts of Trades; their Tables, Chests, and Cupboards made of <HI>Brasile</HI>-Wood, are no way inferior to the best that are made in <HI>Europe.</HI> Painting is also in great esteem amongst them: They make handsom Clothes, Shooes, and strange Copper Locks. They have a peculiar Art in Tilling their Ground: They teach the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dogs several tricks, but not feeding them well, they cause them to run from them, and turn wilde, whence they are call'd <HI>Cimarrones,</HI> because they do much hurt to the Cattel.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants, when a Feaver or Ague is upon them at the highest, leap into cold Water: against other Sicknesses they use Herbs, whose soveraign Power Expe∣rience hath long since taught them.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made <HI>Mechoacan</HI> a Bishoprick, they have built ninety four Schools, fifty Churches, several Hospitals and Cloysters, inhabited by <HI>Franciscan</HI> and <HI>Augustin</HI> Monks.</P>
<P>There are said to be in this Bishoprick a hundred and fifty Towns or Burroughs (besides many scatter'd Villages) most of which have Free-Schools erected in them, for the Training up of Youth in the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, good Literature and Arts; and few of them without an Hospital for the Sick: of which Towns the principal are as followeth:</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Principal Towns.</NOTE> 1. <HI>Zinzoutza,</HI> the Seat of the ancient Kings of <HI>Mechoacan.</HI> 2. <HI>Pascuar,</HI> a City forty seven Leagues distant from <HI>Mexico,</HI> once a Bishop's See. 3. <HI>Valladolid,</HI> the Me∣tropolis or chief City of the Province, since the Episcopal Chair was remov'd from <HI>Pascuar</HI> thither. It lieth upon a great Lake, equal amost for bigness to that of
<PB N="264" REF="171"/><HI>Mexico,</HI> and is about seven Leagues distant from <HI>Pascuar,</HI> towards the East. 4. <HI>St. Mi∣chaels,</HI> a good Town, forty Leagues Westward of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and in the Way to the <HI>Zacatecas,</HI> but lying in a Road that is somewhat dangerous, being not a little in∣fested with Salvages on both sides of it. 5. <HI>St. Philips.</HI> 6. <HI>La Conception de Salaya,</HI> seventeen Leagues distant from <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and a convenient Stage for Travellers, being indeed, with the two last mention'd, built chiefly for the defence and secu∣ring of the Countrey against the Salvages. 7. <HI>Guaxanata,</HI> a Town on the Bor∣ders of <HI>Panuco,</HI> where there are very rich Mynes of Silver. 8. <HI>Leon,</HI> another Town likewise of very rich Mynes, twenty four Leagues distant from <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and three∣score from <HI>Mexico.</HI> 9. <HI>Zamorra.</HI> 10. <HI>Villa de los Lagos,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Towards the Sea there is 1. <HI>Acatlan,</HI> but two Miles distant from the Sea-Coast, and a small Town, yet by reason of a safe and very good Harbor which it hath for Shipping, a Place of no little Trading. 2. <HI>Natividad,</HI> another well known and convenient Haven upon <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> pertaining to this Province, and from whence they usually set Sail for the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands. 3. <HI>St. Jago de buena Speranza,</HI> so call'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> perhaps from the abundance of good Pearls they found upon this Coast. 4. <HI>Colyma.</HI> 5. <HI>Zacatula,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P>This Province, as we said, was at first a distinct Kingdom of it self, yet subordi∣nate and Tributary to that of <HI>Mexico;</HI> the King whereof nam'd <HI>Tamgaiva,</HI> or <HI>Bimbicha,</HI> (as <HI>Laet</HI> reporteth) at the first coming of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> thither, after the Conquest of <HI>Mexico,</HI> voluntarily submitted himself to them, and was Baptiz'd. Nevertheless af∣terwards, upon a pretence of I know not what Treason intended by him against them, and which the <HI>Spanish</HI> Writers themselves professedly think to have been feigned, by command of <HI>Nunnez de Gusman,</HI> President of the <HI>Chancery</HI> of <HI>Mexico,</HI> he was most inhumanely burnt alive, and his Kingdom seiz'd upon by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Tlascalla.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Descriptian of <HI>Tlascalla.</HI></NOTE>THe Bishoprick of <HI>Tlascalla,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Tlascalteca, Tlaxcala,</HI> and <HI>Tlasca∣lan,</HI> is a Province of <HI>New Spain,</HI> which extendeth it self entirely from one Sea to another, from the <HI>Atlantick</HI> to <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> with which it is bounded on the East and West Parts, lying otherwise, and for the most part be∣twixt the Provinces of <HI>Mexicana,</HI> last spoken of, and that of <HI>Guaxata,</HI> which follow∣eth, containing in length from one Sea to the other, not much less than an hun∣dred Leagues, and in some places fourscore in breadth; but towards the South Sea growing much narrower. It is a Countrey exceedingly plentiful both in Corn and Cattel, full of rich Pasturage, and so plentifully stor'd with <HI>Maiz,</HI> Wheat, and other Grain, that it is accounted as it were the Granary of <HI>America;</HI> besides Deer, all manner of Venison, and great store of Fowl. There is likewise Copperess, Al∣lom, Silver-Mynes, <HI>Manna, Anime,</HI> and Liquid Amber, with a sweet smelling Gum which drops out of a Tree. The Rivers feed no Fish, because they fall with ex∣ceeding force from the Mountains; onely near <HI>Topoyanco,</HI> is a deep Lake of fresh Water, inhabited round about by <HI>Indians,</HI> enjoying the pleasure and profit of the many <HI>Cumbeba</HI>-Trees, which yield <HI>Cochinele,</HI> producing yearly above two hundred thousand Dupkets worth of that Commodity. In this Lake swim black Hedge∣hogs, whose Flesh is good and wholsom to eat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient State of the <HI>Tlascallans.</HI></NOTE>The People of this Countrey, when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came first amongst them, liv'd in the form of a Common-wealth, or Free-State, refusing to be subject to the King of
<PB N="265" REF="171"/><HI>Mexico,</HI> with whom they had almost continual War; and upon that account, as hath been said, assisted <HI>Cortesius</HI> in the Conquest of the Kingdom, without whose help 'tis most certain he had never been able to do any thing. They enjoy therefore ma∣ny special Priviledges and Immunities more than other <HI>Americans</HI> do. They pay no Tribute, but onely a handful of Wheat yearly for every Person, by way of ac∣knowledgment, otherwise living, under the Protection of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> wholly in the Form of their ancient Government. In former times they were great Man∣eaters, and not onely eat the Flesh of their Enemies, but also of one anotther, inso∣much that Man's-flesh hung in publick to be sold.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">River <HI>Zahuatl.</HI></NOTE>The River <HI>Zahuatl,</HI> which rushes out of the Mountain <HI>Xicoleucalt,</HI> oftentimes overflows all the Countrey near it, and washes away divers Houses. <HI>Zahuatl</HI> signi∣fies <HI>Scabby Water,</HI> because all those, especially Children, that wash in the same, are sure to be Scabby. On its Banks the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have built many Houses, the fashion whereof is now also imitated by the <HI>Indians</HI> of this Province, who formerly built quite after another manner; for they made low Houses of Earth, Wood and Stone, with large and strange Chambers; some a Stones-cast one from another, others close together, had narrow crooked Streets that ran betwixt them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tlascallans</HI> Language.</NOTE>In this Province are two sorts of Languages spoken, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Mexican,</HI> and that of the <HI>Ottomons,</HI> who formerly deserting <HI>Mexico,</HI> chose the <HI>Tlascallans</HI> for their Protectors: They are a toilsom and painful People.</P>
<P>To the Northward of <HI>Tlascalla</HI> are Mountains, which all the year long, except three Moneths, are cover'd with Mist; and the Woods on the tops of them are a great shelter to Lyons, Tygers, Wolves, and wild Dogs, call'd <HI>Adives,</HI> and other wild Beasts, which do much hurt to the small Cattel. Here are also many Serpents and Adders.</P>
<P>The whole Province is said to contain two hundred good Towns and Bur∣roughs, and more than one thousand Villages, all of them exceedingly populous, and suppos'd to contain in the whole above a Million and half of Natives, besides <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have some few Colonies in the Countrey for securing of it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns and Villages.</NOTE>The chief Towns of the Province are 1. <HI>Tlascalla</HI> it self, which denominates the whole Countrey as the Metropolis, and where the Bishop's See was at first, till in the Year 1550. it was remov'd to <HI>Puebla de los Angelos.</HI> It is a fair Town, and com∣modiously seated in the midst of a large and fertile Champain of threescore Miles in compass. It consisteth of four large and beautiful Streets or Quarters, and in the midst of them where they all meet, hath a <HI>Piazza,</HI> or Market-place, equal to that of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and able to receive twenty or thirty thousand Persons conveniently, to Buy and Sell in it; and whose Shambles seldom shew less than fifteen thousand Sheep, four thousand Oxen, and two thousand Hogs.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Puebla de los Angelos,</HI> or <HI>The City of Angels,</HI> a Town built by <HI>Sebastian Ramirez,</HI> a Church-man, and he that was the first President, or chief Governor of <HI>Mexico,</HI> un∣der the Crown of <HI>Castile.</HI> It was built in the Year 1531. almost in the Road-way from <HI>Vera Crux</HI> to <HI>Mexico,</HI> and seated in a very delicate and fertile Countrey, and of a good Air. It is a Bishop's See, and valu'd at twenty thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> of yearly Rent, the City it self suppos'd to contain about fifteen hundred Families; where there is abundance of excellent Cloth made, and for fineness not yielding to the best of <HI>Spain.</HI> Its chief Edifices are, the Cathedral and four stately Cloysters, be∣longing to the <HI>Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustines,</HI> and <HI>Capuchins;</HI> as also a Free-School for five hundred <HI>Indian</HI> Children, endow'd by <HI>Ramirez</HI> with a yearly Revenue.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Zempoallan,</HI> seated upon a River of the same Name.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Napalaca,</HI> in the Valley <HI>Ocumba,</HI> ows its original to an <HI>Indian</HI> call'd <HI>Juan,</HI> who
<PB N="266" REF="172"/>at first had onely one House, and a Herd of Hogs there, till upon his invitation, all the neighboring People came from the tops of the Hills; insomuch, that in a short time, the place was Peopled by thousands of Families.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Guaxacingo,</HI> all hitherto great and ancient Towns of the Natives.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Segura de la Frontera,</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Town, built by <HI>Cortez</HI> presently upon the Con∣quest of <HI>Mexico,</HI> for the securing of the Confines, as the Name importeth.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> a Town built by <HI>Cortez</HI> and his Companions, at their first Land∣ing, and where afterwards, by a Stratagem, and out of a resolution either to Con∣quer or Die in the Countrey, he caus'd all his Ships to be burnt, that his Soldi∣ers might not so much as think of returning back from whence they came. The Town was at first built five or six Leagues up within Land; but the place being found not to be so healthful, the Inhabitants in a short time deserted it, and seated themselves upon a Bay of the Sea, right over against <HI>St. John D' Ullua.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Medellin,</HI> another <HI>Spanish</HI> Town, built likewise by <HI>Cortez,</HI> in memory of his own Birth-place, which was <HI>Medellin,</HI> a small Town of <HI>Estramadura,</HI> a Province of <HI>Spain,</HI> but was afterwards destroy'd by some <HI>Spanish</HI> Commanders, out of malice to <HI>Cortez.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>St. John D' Ullua,</HI> a noted, and the most usual Port to all this Province, and likewise to the City of <HI>Mexico</HI> it self, from the North Sea: but of difficult en∣trance, especially to such as are not well acquainted with the Passage, or want Guides, by reason of certain Rocks and Quicksands, wherewith the Mouth of the Haven is said to be bar'd; but within, the station is more safe. It hath likewise two strong Bulwarks or Forts rais'd, on either side of the Entrance one, to defend the Passage; besides a strong Castle, built since Captain <HI>John Hawkins</HI> surpris'd twelve Ships richly Laden within the Haven, and thirteen others that arriv'd with a new Vice-Roy from <HI>Spain,</HI> valu'd at near sixty Tun of Gold, of which he might easily have made Prize, had he not trusted to the Vice-Roys Promise, to give him all sa∣tisfaction he should require, by which being deceiv'd, he lost all his Fleet but two Ships.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Tlascala</HI> and <HI>Los Angelos</HI> are the Fountains, out of which the River hath its Original, which gliding by <HI>Machaocan</HI> and <HI>Zacatula,</HI> falls into the South Sea: This River is so exceeding full of Crocodiles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great in∣crease of Grocodiles.</NOTE> that they have made several places which formerly were Inhabited on its Banks, utterly desolate; for the Females lay∣ing generally Eggs as big as those of a Goose, increase prodigiously; and were it not that the <HI>Indian</HI> Mice, call'd <HI>Ichneumones,</HI> destroy'd them, they would grow still to greater numbers: But this Animal creeping in at the Crocodiles Mouth, eats his way out of the Belly again; Water-Serpents, Hawks, <HI>Buffeloes,</HI> and especially Tygers, are also their mortal Enemies, for they throwing the Crocodiles on their Backs, rend open their Bellies: They are more desirous of Mans flesh here than in any other place, because the River of <HI>Tlascala</HI> hath but small store of Fish; in the day time they lie cover'd in the Mud, from whence they rush forth, and set upon those that happen to pass by them; they pursue the <HI>Canoos</HI> in the Water, and strike down the Rowers with their Tails.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning Mountain <HI>Po∣patepeck.</HI></NOTE>Eight Leagues beyond <HI>Tlascala,</HI> appears the Mountain <HI>Popatepeck,</HI> which for ten years ceas'd smoaking, till <HI>Anno</HI> 1540. it broke forth in such a manner, that the Countrey all about was terrifi'd therewith; for it vomited not onely a black Smoak, but also horrible Flames, which sometimes being blow'd downward, burnt the Corn in the Fields, and the Ashes thereof flying as far as <HI>Guaxocingo</HI> and <HI>Chulula,</HI> burnt a great deal of the Town to the Ground; every one endeavor'd by flight to secure themselves, with intention never to return thither again; but the
<PB N="267" REF="172"/>Flame and Smoak abating, Captain <HI>Diego de Ordas</HI> went up to view the place; whence the Fire was cast forth; which curiosity and presumption of his, had like to have cost him his Life, for the sulphury Smoak breaking forth on a sudden, had almost stifled him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers of <HI>Mexicana.</HI></NOTE>Moreover, the Bishoprick of <HI>Tlascala,</HI> is on the North Coast wash'd by the River <HI>Papoloava,</HI> since call'd <HI>Alvarado,</HI> from a <HI>Spanish</HI> Commander, who first Steer'd his Course thither: The next Stream nam'd <HI>Banderas,</HI> is so call'd, because the Natives held white Clothes on Poles, to invite the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ashore. The third is <HI>Almeria,</HI> on which, <HI>Cortesius,</HI> a year after the taking of <HI>Mexico,</HI> built the Town <HI>Medellin,</HI> as afore∣mention'd.</P>
<P>Along the <HI>Tlascallan</HI> shore, wash'd by the Northern Ocean, lie the Isles <HI>Blanca, Verde,</HI> and <HI>Sacrificios:</HI> The first receiv'd its denomination from <HI>White Land,</HI> the other from <HI>Green Trees;</HI> and the third, because <HI>Joan de Greyalve,</HI> who first Discover'd <HI>New Spain,</HI> Landing on this Island, found a Bloody Altar there, with Sacrific'd People with open'd Brests, chopt off Arms and Legs.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Almeria</HI> falling into the Ocean opposite to the <HI>Sacrificios,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships came often to an Anchor there; but in these latter times, they have forsaken the same, because the Northern Winds us'd to blow very hard against the shore, and spoil'd many Vessels: But <HI>Henry Hawks</HI> gives this reason, That a dreadful ap∣parition of Spirits frighted the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from thence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Province <HI>Tepeaca.</HI></NOTE>In the Bishoprick <HI>Tlascala,</HI> is also compriz'd the Province <HI>Tepeaca,</HI> whose Metro∣polis was built by <HI>Cortez,</HI> when with great Loss he was sent from <HI>Almeria.</HI> The Soil thereabouts is barren and stony; the Water which they have in the City, is brought in Pipes from a River which flows out of the Mountains into the Market place. The plain Countrey hath many good Pastures. The Inhabitants thereof speak four sorts of Languages; of which, the commonest is the <HI>Mexican;</HI> others use the <HI>Popolucan</HI> or <HI>Otoman</HI> Tongues.</P>
<P>The Village <HI>Alyoxucan</HI> appears afar off on a high Mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alyonan.</NOTE> on whose top is a Lake of a hundred and fifty Fathom in circumference; the Water whereof is very cold, and of a bluish Colour, and neither Ebbs nor Flows, to which the Villagers climb along a narrow Path.</P>
<P>Not far from thence, in the Plain, are two other very deep Lakes: The first call'd <HI>Tlacae,</HI> is a League in circumference, and breeds delicate white Fish, not above a Fingers length: The second nam'd <HI>Alchichican,</HI> about the same bigness, which in stormy Weather is very turbulent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange sort of Bird.</NOTE>Amongst the Fowls of this Countrey, the most noted is a little Summer Bird, with a long crooked Tail, speckled Feathers; feeds on nothing but Flowers and the Dew; about Harvest time, when the Rain ceases, it hangs fast with its Bill on a Tree, and as soon as the first Rain falls, it revives again.</P>
<P>In this Countrey <HI>Tepeaca</HI> are five Villages, in each of which is a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Cloy∣ster and convenient Hospital.</P>
<P>In this Countrey they gather the Water in the time of the Rainy Moneths, in a digg'd Pool, which every Morning produces little Toads with long Tails, which in few days fall off; but these little ones growing to be great, make a most dreadful noise in the Night: From <HI>October</HI> till <HI>March,</HI> not one drop of Rain falls in this Countrey; during which time, the Northern Winds make a dry and wholsome Air, yet oftentimes a tempestuous Sea, to the loss of many Ships.</P>
<P>Farther up into the Countrey, between <HI>Vera Crux</HI> and <HI>Los Angelos,</HI> lies the Vil∣lage <HI>Rinconanda;</HI> and also <HI>Xalapa</HI> and <HI>Perota</HI> built of Straw Houses in the middle of a Wood of Cedar and Pirte-Trees, inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for the accommoda∣ting
<PB N="268" REF="173"/>of Travellers: To which purpose there are likewise Inns built near the Spring <HI>Fuente de Otzumba,</HI> which gushes out of a high Rock.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is the Populous Village <HI>Chetula,</HI> where a small number of <HI>Spaniards</HI> dwell amongst thousands of <HI>Indians,</HI> who chiefly make use of Mules to car∣ry their Loads.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mexican</HI> Re∣ligion ab∣horr'd by the neighboring People,</NOTE>The particular Religion of the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> compos'd of cruel slaughters and butcheries of Men, reign'd a long time against the minds of the other <HI>Indians</HI> that were under their Dominion, every one beginning more to abhor the cruel flaying of living People, and tearing out the Hearts of Men for Offerings; and the rather, because they were forc'd to fetch them out of their Enemies Countrey with the ha∣zard of their own Lives, insomuch that they were ready long before to have em∣braced another Doctrine, if any other Teacher had but appear'd amongst them; which was the chief reason why they so easily receiv'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion: for when <HI>Cortesius</HI> had conquer'd the City <HI>Mexico,</HI> the <HI>Mechoacan</HI> Agents entreated him to send them Teachers to prescribe them Laws, according to which they might live, because their Idolatry, which had long oppress'd them, was not to be suffer'd any longer, because of the Cruelties which were requir'd of them in the perfor∣mance thereof.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pro∣cessions.</NOTE>Their Processions were stately, and after this manner: The chiefest Nuns rai∣sing a Paste of <HI>Bledoi</HI>-Seed and parched <HI>Maiz,</HI> kneaded it with Honey, of which they made an Idol resembling their Deity <HI>Viztipuztli,</HI> across whose Nose and Forehead they drew a blue Stroke; his Head they adorn'd with a Plume of Feathers, and in the left Hand plac'd a round Box, in the right a crooked Staff like a Serpent, and Wings behind on his Shoulders; at the appointed Feast-day the Nuns meet before Sun-rising, in new white Apparel, with Garlands of <HI>Maiz</HI> about their Heads and Necks, which hung down below the left Shoulder, their Faces painted with several colours, about their Arms hung Parrots Feathers from their Elbows down to their Hands: Thus adorn'd, they carried the kneaded Idol to a Court, where the Youths that inhabited a Cloyster in the same Temple, fetching the Idols blue Throne, with great Reverence set it down at the lower Step of the Temple, at which the People threw Dust on their Heads; which was no sooner done, but the Boys ran with all speed to the Mountain <HI>Chapultepec,</HI> a League from <HI>Mexico,</HI> whither the Multitude flowing them in manner of Procession, made all short Prayers and Offerings there; from thence hastening into the Champain Fields <HI>Atla∣cuavaya,</HI> they perform'd the like Service as before; which done, they went to the Village <HI>Cuyoacan,</HI> a League farther; from whence they came back in all haste with their Idol into <HI>Mexico:</HI> Wherefore this Processioning for its expedition was call'd <HI>Ipaina Viztliputli.</HI> The Idol being brought into the Temple, was by four Cords made fast to his Throne, hoised up to the Cieling with the noise of Drums and Trumpets, whilst the fore-mention'd Youths strow'd the Temple both within and without full of Roses; after which the Nuns gave the Boys the resemblances of Bones made of the same Dough with the Idol, with which they were to cover the Floor of the Chappel; then appear'd the Temple-Priests, with Scarfs about their Bodies, Garlands on their Heads, and Strings with Flowers about their Necks, each going in order according to his quality to the place where the Bones lay; which being Consecrated with Songs and Dances, were religiously worshipp'd for Bones of the Idol; after which six of the Priests went down to the Stone <HI>Quauxi∣calli,</HI> on which the Prisoners lying upon their Backs, had their Hearts pull'd out; which being finish'd, the Maids and Boys before-mention'd went to meet one ano∣ther, Dancing to the sound of Pipes, Drums and Songs; which their nearest Rela∣tions answering, Danc'd round about them, whither the whole City and Coun∣trey People all about came flocking in great numbers.</P>
<P>During this high Feast none, upon great Penalties, durst eat any other Food but the Cakes made of the same Dough of which the Idol was made; neither were they permitted, though Children, to drink till the Afternoon.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Priest climb'd up to a Chappel strow'd with Roses, in which the Idol sitting, they disrob'd him, broke his holy Arms and Legs into little pieces, which they distributed amongst the common People, who receiv'd them with great Reverence, and with tears in their Eyes, imagining they eat the Body of their God; for which honour every one paid a tenth part of the Charge which had been spent in this high Feast. Then a Priest admonish'd them how they should lead their Lives, since they were united with their God; which ended, they all went to their several Habitations in a wonderful good order from the Temple.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancient At∣tire of the <HI>Mexicans.</HI></NOTE>Concerning the <HI>Mexicans</HI> Apparel, it is a sufficient testimony, that they are no way of the same original with the several barbarous Nations, that run up and down naked in <HI>New Spain:</HI> for the Inhabitants of <HI>Mexico</HI> went antiently Cloth'd in Cotton: On their Heads they wore a high Plume of red Feathers; about their Necks, over their Shoulders, Breast and Back, a kind of large <HI>Thorax</HI> of Feathers

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> curiously pleited; each Arm adorn'd with Armlets, and their Middles girt with broad white Girdles full of red Streaks; in stead of Garters they wore Laces of Feathers, as also a little above their Ancles. Their Priests besmear'd all their Bodies, especially the Head, with an Ointment, whose special vertue was to make their Hair grow exceeding long, which they braided with broad Cotton Strings; they also smutch'd themselves with a kind of blacking Stuff; when they went to make Offerings to their Idol in Caves, Woods, or on high Mountains, they be∣dawb'd themselves with an Ointment made of Spiders, Salamanders, Adders, Scorpions and Toads, which the Temple-Boys caught for them in great abun∣dance. This Ointment they made with many Circumstances; for having roasted the fore-mention'd Vermine on the Hearth of the perpetual Fire before <HI>Viztlipuztli</HI>'s Altar, and stamp'd the same in a Mortar with Tobacco, living Scorpions, the Seed <HI>Ololuchqui,</HI> (to which they ascrib'd a power of representing Visions) hairy Worms, and Soot, they kneaded all together, put the Ointment in Pots, and plac'd it before the Idol, thenceforth reputing it a sanctifi'd Medicine, that would prove good against all manner of Diseases; wherefore the Priests being always sent for to the Sick in stead of Doctors, perfum'd the Patient, shav'd his Hair, hung Snakes Bones about his Neck, and order'd him at a certain Hour to bathe himself, and in the Night to watch before a Fire-hearth, and to eat no Bread but what had been Offer'd to their Idol. Moreover, the said Ointment is thought to have another power, <HI>viz.</HI> to make those that anointed themselves with the same, valiant and strong; which the common People believ'd, because the Priests would go through Woods and Wildernesses that abounded with ravenous Beasts.</P>
<P>These <HI>Heathens</HI> also seem'd to have something of Circumcision and Baptism; for they not onely cut off a piece of the Infant's Ears and privy Members, which they Offer'd to their Idols, but also wash'd them as soon as they came into the World, putting into their Hands such Tools as were of use in their Fathers Profession.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Nup∣tial Solemni∣ties.</NOTE></P>
<P>Their Marriages also were celebrated with great solemnity: The Priest having ask'd the Bride and Bridegroom, If they would joyn together in Matrimony? if
<PB N="278" REF="178"/>they both consented, he ty'd the Brides Scarf, and Bridegrooms Coat together, and so accompanying them home, led them nine times about the Fire-hearth: If the Bride had no Impediments, then the Bridegroom made Presents to her Father and Mother, Offerings to the Gods, and a brave Dinner to the nearest Relations; after which an Inventory was drawn of what each of them had brought, that upon their being Divorc'd, (which was very common amongst the <HI>Mexicans</HI>) each might have his share; and if they had Children, the Man was to keep the Sons, and the Woman the Daughters; nor were they permitted, on pain of death, being once part∣ed, to joyn together again.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Feast <HI>Texcoals.</HI></NOTE>On the ninteenth of <HI>May</HI> they kept the Feast <HI>Texcoalt,</HI> Consecrated to the Idol <HI>Tezcatlipuca,</HI> before whom they Offer'd a Slave, which was done after this manner: Towards the Evening the Multitude coming into the Temple, the Priests pulling off the Idols old, put on new Apparel, hung him full of Precious Stones and Arm∣lets, set Plumes of Feathers on his Head; which done, the Curtains behind which he stood, were drawn, and a Priest Cloth'd exactly like the Idol coming forth, turn'd himself round, blow'd a kind of Trumpet towards the four Winds, and ate Earth, which all the People imitated: whereof those which had committed any hainous Offence, Offer'd Incense to the Idol, and weeping, begg'd forgiveness of their Sins. Those that were Soldiers besought him to grant them store of Prisoners, and strength to conquer their Enemies; for which they would return him thanks with Offer'd Prisoners.</P>
<P>This Feast of <HI>Texcoalt</HI> lasting ten days, ended on the twenty ninth of <HI>May</HI> with peculiar Ceremonies; for in the Morning a company of Priests, black all over, carried on their Shoulders a large Chair of State richly adorn'd; in which sat their Idol <HI>Tezcatlipuca,</HI> and Priests with long pleited Hair, and Clad in the same Appa∣rel with the Idol, which they set down at the Foot of a pair of Stairs which led up to a Chappel; whither the attendant Youths and Virgins came and spread Car∣pets before it, and green Boughs of <HI>Manghey;</HI> after which two Priests carried the Idol into a spacious Court in the Temple, several others walking before, each with a perfuming Vessel; when they threw their Perfumes on the Consecrated Hearth, they held their Hands towards the Idol, desiring him that he would send their Prayers to Heaven: Next follow'd the Multitude, who scourg'd themselves till the Blood ran down from their Backs. So soon as the Procession was ended, the represented <HI>Tezcatlipuca</HI> was hoised up to the Cieling, and abundance of Flowers strow'd before the Altar; which done, every one went home to Dinner, whilst the Youths and Virgins adorn'd the Idol, and plac'd Meat before him: Lastly, the Votaresses came two and two with Baskets of Bread, and Dishes of Meat: their Governess in a white Sur-Coat over a red Vest, with Wings on her Shoul∣ders, and broad Girts, at which hung <HI>Calabashes</HI> fill'd with holy Reliques and Flowers: Moreover, she conducted the Votaresses to the Steps of the Altar on which the Idol sat; where having eaten Bread they came back, and the Temple-Servants went in their places, and carried the Meat which stood on the Altar to the Priests Cells, who by that time were to have Fasted five days: this done, the Peo∣ple came all to the Temple again, to be present at the end of the Feast: then a Slave, who had represented the Idol a whole year, appear'd, to whom every one having shew'd Reverence, the chief Priest cutting open his Breast, tore the Slave's Heart reaking out of his Body, and shew'd it to the Sun; then the Consecrated Youths and Maids made a great noise with Drumming, Singing and Dancing about the Body till Sun-set; after which the Virgins going up to the upper Chappel, plac'd Bread and Fruit, made up like dead Mens Bones and Heads, before the Idol,
<PB N="279" REF="178"/>where, after it had stood a little while, the Servants went up and fetch'd it down, whilst the Youths and Maids went to their several Cloysters.</P>
<P>Much after the same manner, and with such like brutish Ceremonies, not worth mentioning, was also celebrated the Feast of <HI>Quetzatcoalt.</HI></P>
<P>In the inner part of the Temple stood a Stage, on which upon Festival Days the People Acted Drolls; in which they sometimes feign'd themselves deaf, blind, lame, and the like, and begg'd to be cur'd of their Idols; sometimes were dress'd like Serpents, Adders, Crocodiles, or other ravenous Beasts, in which postures they fought one with another.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Computati∣on of Time a∣mongst the <HI>Mexicans.</HI></NOTE>Those Feasts were all kept on certain times, according to the <HI>Mexican</HI> Alma∣nack, in which the Year was divided into eight Moneths, and each Moneth into forty five Days, which together made three hundred and sixty: The five remaining Days, to compleat the Year, they kept apart, on which all Affairs whatsoever were laid aside, as Selling, Buying, Offerings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nothing else being thought on but Feasting one another for the passing away of the time. The first Day of their Year was on the twenty sixth of <HI>February.</HI> Each Moneth had a peculiar Name and Sign. Moreover, they divided the Year into four parts by as many Representations, <HI>viz.</HI> a House, a Rabbet, a Cane, and a Flint to strike Fire with; and Figur'd it out by a Wheel with four Spikes jutting out round about it, colour'd green, red, blue, and yellow, and in the middle thereof a Sun; each Spike signifi'd thirteen years, wherefore it had thirteen Divisions, distinguish'd by the four fore-mention'd Re∣presentations: At each Division of the Wheel they set down what remarkable things should happen that year by certain Characters; as, a Man in red Apparel typifi'd that Year when <HI>Ferdinand Cortesius,</HI> clad in Red, conquer'd <HI>Mexico.</HI> When the Wheel was fill'd with fifty two years Prognostication, then on the last Night they broke all their Pots and Vessels in pieces, and blew out their Candles, because they believ'd, that at the end of the said fifty two years the World would be at an end, and therefore they had no need of Housholdstuff, or ought else: But so soon as the Day appear'd again, they play'd on Pipes, Trumpets, and Drums, rejoycing that God had deferr'd the destruction of the World fifty two years longer; then they bought new Utensils and Candles, and made solemn Processions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Art of Wri∣ting.</NOTE>Concerning the Art of Writing amongst the Inhabitants of <HI>New Spain, Joseph Acosta</HI> tells us, That some old Books, containing ancient Passages, the Course of the Heavens, nature of Beasts and Plants, were found in <HI>Jucatan,</HI> according to the Re∣lation of a Learned <HI>Indian,</HI> but were all burnt by Command of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Bishop, be∣cause he suppos'd them to be full of Matter touching the Black Art. Their Histo∣ries they describ'd with the Representations of the Things. Rhetorick and Poetry the Children were taught by Rote in the Schools, so that they never forgot what they had once learnt; But at present they use <HI>Spanish</HI> Letters or Characters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancient Go∣vernment.</NOTE>Moreover, the Government of <HI>Mexico</HI> hath ever been kept in a good Order, the King's Power being exactly limited, that nothing might be lost of the common Priviledges. The fourth King <HI>Icoath</HI> made Earls, who next to the Lords of <HI>Tezcuco</HI> and <HI>Tacuba,</HI> had right to the Crown; which was like a Mitre turn'd up behind, and rising before with a Point. According as they increas'd in Power, so they advanc'd in Royal Dignity; in which <HI>Muteczuma</HI> the Second exceeded all others: And to manifest his splendor, his House for all sorts of Creatures, and many other things, might serve for a sufficient testimony: for in it he kept Sea-Fish in salt Water, River-Fish in fresh Water, and all manner of Beasts in peculiar places: The Birds were kept in great Aviaries, surrounded with golden Rails. Next to the Kings fol∣low'd four Earls call'd <HI>Atlacohecalcatl,</HI> which signifies <HI>Princes of the Throne Launces,</HI> a
<PB N="280" REF="179"/>Weapon much us'd amongst the <HI>Mexicans.</HI> The next in Degree were the <HI>Tlacate∣catl,</HI> or <HI>Man-cleavers; Esauahuacatl,</HI> or <HI>Blood-shedders; Tsallancalqui,</HI> or <HI>Lords of Black∣ness,</HI> without all which the King durst not take any Business in hand. High and lesser Courts of Judicatory, where Matters of Life and Death were try'd, were in most Cities; and other Courts also for petty Quarrels, Controversies, and the like. The Collectors brought their Revenues to the Court every Moneth. The chief thing which preferr'd both Rich and Poor to Places of Honor, consisted in Valour and heroick Exploits. Their Arms were chiefly sharp pieces of Flint made fast to a Stick, with which they could at one Blow chop off a Horses Head. They also us'd Pikes, Clubs, and Lances, and sometimes Slings: For defensive Armour, they had Helmets and Shields, made of Tygers, Leopards, and Lyons Skins. They always fell upon their Enemies unawares, their Design being generally to take Prisoners rather than to kill them; for they reserv'd them for Offerings to their Idols. <HI>Muteczuma</HI> made several Commanders over his Armies, giving them a Power one above the other, which were to be distinguish'd by several Marks; for the chiefest ty'd the Hair on the top of their Heads with a red String, betwixt which stuck a brave Plume of Feathers; at the end whereof hung as many Tassels as they had done noble Exploits. To this Order belong'd also the King, who wore one of the same Marks, with which King <HI>Muteczuma</HI> and his Son stand Carv'd on a Rock. The <HI>Ayulas,</HI> or <HI>The Order of the Eagle,</HI> consisted of valiant Men. The <HI>Grey Knights</HI> were of less Quality, and wore Collars which reach'd up to their Ears, the lower part of their Body being naked. Persons of greater Dignity, when going to the War, were Arm'd from Head to Foot: Which Order was also permitted to wear Cotton-Clothes, and Shoes richly embroider'd with Gold and Silver; they us'd painted Vessels, and had Lodgings provided for them at Court.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Edu∣cation of Youth.</NOTE>Moreover, it is worthy of obesrvation, what great care the <HI>Mexicans</HI> took in the bringing up of their Children; to which purpose they had Schools near to their Temples, in which Youth was taught to Sing, Dance, Morality, Obedience, and also Martial Discipline. Children of noble Extract had Learned Men for their Tutors. Their Punishments for Transgressions were very severe, the Masters for∣cing their Scholars to Fast and Watch, carry great Burthens of Provisions to the Army, and be in the midst of Engagements. Others, whose Fancy led them to a holy Life, willingly embrac'd the Services of the Temple.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Dan∣cing.</NOTE>Their manner of Dancing in <HI>New Spain</HI> was very strange and differing; they us'd pretty Instruments, and Songs which contain'd antique Passages, according to the Times; they in their Motions imitated Shepherds, Fisher-men, Plowmen, Hun∣ters, and the like: Sometimes they Danc'd in <HI>Mascarades,</HI> with a Man on their Shoulders, making the same Motion with his Hands in the Air, as the other with his Feet on the Ground. They had also Tumblers and Dancers on the Ropes, which shew'd strange Tricks on an erected Pole. But above all Dances, the <HI>Mitotes</HI> was the chief, which was generally Danc'd in the King's Palace, or inner Court of the Temple; in the middle of which they plac'd a great Drum and a hollow Tub on a large Image; round about which the most eminent Persons made a Ring, Sang sweetly, and Danc'd leisurely, when on a sudden two that are more nimble, with divers Motions came into the midst of them, and Danc'd exactly after the sound of the Drum and hollow Tub, which was seconded with the noise of Flutes and Pipes.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. New Gallicia.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds and Extent of <HI>New Gallicia.</HI></NOTE><HI>NEw Gallicia,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Guadalajara,</HI> from the chief City. This whole Province is the most Northern Countrey of all <HI>America,</HI> that is inhabited to any purpose by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Here, 'tis true, they are scatter'd up and down in all the parts of it, but it is at a huge distance, and for the most part onely where the Mines are. It is bounded on the East and to the South, with the King∣dom of <HI>Mexico</HI> or <HI>New Spain;</HI> on the West, with the Gulf or Bay of <HI>California;</HI> Northward, for so much as is yet discover'd, with <HI>Quivira</HI> and <HI>Cibola,</HI> lying between eighteen and twenty eight Degrees of Northern Latitude, that is, from <HI>La Nativi∣dad,</HI> a Port so nam'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the Confines of <HI>New Spain,</HI> to the most Northerly Borders of <HI>Cinoloa,</HI> a part of this Province, containing, as is suppos'd, not much less than three hundred Leagues in length, and in breadth much more; and whereof not a tenth part is either us'd or frequented by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperature and Nature of the Coun∣trey.</NOTE>The Air is generally here very temperate, inclining rather to Heat than Cold, and subject now and then to sudden Storms of Rain, and great Claps of Thunder, which yet do not hinder, but that the Countrey is held to be reasonably healthful, and the People observ'd to live generally to a good old Age. The Soil, by reason of the Climate, would be a little inclining to Drought, but that, besides the frequent Rains which it hath, it is constantly moistned with fresh Morning Dews, which make it for the most part wonderfully fruitful, almost beyond belief, yield∣ing for every Pushel of Wheat that is sown, threescore; and of <HI>Maiz,</HI> two hundred for one; besides great plenty of Sugar-Canes and <HI>Cochinele;</HI> both which neverthe∣less the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are said to neglect in some sort, employing themselves wholly about richer Commodities: for the Countrey affords them good store of Mines of Silver and Brass, but of Gold or Iron, not many as yet have been found. The Ri∣vers abound plentifully with Fish, and the Woods with Wenison, and some other wild Beasts. The Countrey is generally more mountainous than plain, frequently shaded with Woods, and whole Forrests of the stateliest Pine-Trees and Oaks that are to be seen; amongst which breed abundance of Wolves, which do great mis∣chief to the People, as also Scorpions and <HI>Mustiecho's.</HI> The Hurts receiv'd from Scorpions, are heal'd with the Juice of the Fruit call'd <HI>Queon;</HI> those from the <HI>Mu∣stiecho's,</HI> by Vinegar and the Juice of Lemmon. Here is likewise a green Stone, accounted a soveraign Medicine against the Gravel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several sorts of <HI>Tunas</HI>-Trees.</NOTE>The Trees peculiar to this Countrey, are, the <HI>tunas,</HI> already spoken of in <HI>Guati∣mala,</HI> and thought to be the same we vulgarly call <HI>Indian Fig-Trees,</HI> and are distin∣guish'd into six sorts.</P>
<P>The first, by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Cardon,</HI> hath sharp Prickles, thick Leaves, full of slimy Juice, an odoriferous Flower, oval Fruit, cover'd with an Orange-colour'd Rind, and small Roots: The Fruit within consists of a white juicy, and well tasted Pulp, full of black Seed.</P>
<P>The second hath a round Body full of Boughs, with Star-like Prickles hang∣ing downwards, the Flower white, and the Fruit very like that of the <HI>Cardon,</HI> onely smaller.</P>
<PB N="282" REF="180"/>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The third is the <HI>Caxabra,</HI> which shoots up to a great Tree full of prickly Cods; at the utmost end grows a large white Flower; the Fruit, which is as big again as an Egg, is pleasant and cooling.</P>
<P>The fourth sort hath a straight Body full of Prickles, runs lesser and lesser to the top; at the end of the small Boughs, each thick Leaf produces another; the Wood, if kindled, burns like a Candle.</P>
<P>The fifth, nam'd <HI>Cumbeba,</HI> grows out of small Roots, with three or four corner'd thick Leaves, full of Prickles, the Flower somewhat less than the former, the Fruit oval, hard and red, having a white and juicy Pulp: The Prickles of this <HI>Cumbeba</HI>-Tree are so sharp, and stick in so deep, that they can scarce be pull'd out. This is that sort of <HI>Tunas</HI> that produces <HI>Cochinele,</HI> which is a Worm that grows under the Leaves, and is cover'd with a Skin, which being neatly taken off and dry'd in the Sun, as formerly mention'd, becomes a rich Commodity. <HI>Joseph de Acosta</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet, <HI>Anno</HI> 1578. carried so much <HI>Cochinele</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> as amounted to two hundred eighty three thousand seven hundred and fifty Ryals.</P>
<P>But the last sort of the <HI>Tunas</HI> is the <HI>Unirumbeba,</HI> which hath a straight Body full of Prickles, on the top whereof grow divers prickly Leaves, not unlike those of the Palm-Tree: It is onely found in barren places, remote from the Sea.</P>
<P>Moreover, all kind of Fruits transplanted hither from <HI>Spain</HI> thrive very well, as Apples, Pears, Granats, Figs, Peaches, Apricocks, Muskmelons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Root <HI>Castanuela.</HI></NOTE>The Root <HI>Castanuela</HI> affords a much better Feeding for Swine than Acorns. But a∣mongst many other Roots which are found here, as the <HI>Xiquimas, Yaca, Cochuco, Cari, Totora</HI> and <HI>Mani,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Batata.</HI></NOTE> the chief is the <HI>Batata,</HI> which is fat, sweet, and windy; it runs over the Ground with a tough green Sprig, the new Fibres taking Root dispersedly up and down, being yellow without, and within full of milky Juice; the Leaf resem∣bling a Heart, is of a pale yellow colour on the top, and donuy underneath; roasted in Ashes, it eats better than a Turnip: It is divided into three sorts.</P>
<P>The first, call'd <HI>Omenapo-yeima,</HI> when boyl'd, shews like red <HI>Betel,</HI> but Dyes of a Skye-colour; the innermost Skin, which is of a dark Red, yields an Ink-like Juice.</P>
<PB N="283" REF="180"/>
<P>The second sort, call'd <HI>Parro,</HI> differs little from the first, onely the Body, Root, and Veins of the Leaves, are of a Purple colour.</P>
<P>The third sort <HI>Jetiope,</HI> being white, hath a very good rellish, and cures the Ague.</P>
<P>The Pepper, which is here call'd <HI>Axi,</HI> grows in the warmest Valleys, and the more by being often water'd: there are of it divers kinds, differing in colour, smell, and taste one from the other; for one sort is green, yellow, or red; another sort yields a strong musky scent; and one sort is sharper, another milder: the Veins and Kernels thereof are eaten with Salt.</P>
<P>The Herb <HI>Cevadilla</HI> cures all manner of Sores.</P>
<P>This Countrey also breeds an innumerable company of Deer, Hogs, Goats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> Sheep, Oxen, and Horses; and of hurtful Creatures, Pismires, which do great mischief to the Plants, and Locusts, which fall in huge swarms on the Corn, and cannot be frighted from the same by any means whatsoever. The want of Water is also no small prejudice to the Fields.</P>
<P>The biggest River, call'd <HI>Guadalajara,</HI> with many windings runs North-westward into the Southern Ocean; and four Leagues from the City of the same, falling down from a steep Rock, it makes such a horrible noise, that it deafens those which approach the same.</P>
<P>The Lake <HI>Mechoacan</HI> opens here also with a wide Mouth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sorts of Hedge-hogs.</NOTE>The River before mention'd, produces all manner of Fish in great abundance; and also a sort of Hedge-hogs, call'd <HI>Iguana,</HI> which live both in the Water, and on the Land, and are of two sorts: The first, call'd <HI>Senembi,</HI> is four Foot long, of a deep green colour, with black and white Spots, hath a scaly Skin, white Spots on each side of the Head, a row of sharp Prickles from the Head to the Tail, wide Nostrils, great black Eyes, and little Teeth. The second sort, call'd <HI>Tejaguacu,</HI> dif∣fers from the first, in having white Spots on a brown Skin, a longer Tail, and a red Tongue, which is slit. Both sorts are reported to fast eight Moneths together; and though often terribly wounded, and dead to all imagination, yet live a great while after; and though they swim up and down in Rivers, yet they Lay their Eggs in the Sand: their Flesh boyl'd is both wholsom, and of a good relish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> living.</NOTE>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> which inhabit <HI>New Gallicia,</HI> drive a considerable Trade in Merchan∣dizing, Husbandry, breeding of Cattel, and working in the Mines: They use Wayns and Carrs, drawn by Oxen, Mules, and Horses, to carry their Loads, as al∣so <HI>Spanish</HI> Weights and Measures. They are little troubled with any other Mischiefs but what may happen from the treacherous Natives, who take all opportunities to run into the Woods, that there they may exercise their <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion in freedom; in which having spent some time, they gather a considerable number together, and oftentimes fall unawares on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who use Leather Shields and Helmets, and furr'd Cotton Clothes, to secure them from the Arrows which the <HI>Indians,</HI> ly∣ing in Ambuscades, shoot at them out of the Bushes.</P>

Here, within the Houses, (which are built after a strange manner) lay thousands of Ser∣pents mingled together, with their Heads sticking out on the top and at the sides, and hissing with open Mouth at those which approached them. The Inhabitants shew'd great Revence to these Serpents, because (as they said) the Devil often ap∣pear'd to them in that form. And this seems to be a Custome amongst them from the Tradition of <HI>Eves</HI> being tempted by the Devil in the shape of a Serpent:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpents worshipp'd by the Na∣tives.</NOTE> Nor was this Superstition peculiar onely to these <HI>Indians,</HI> forasmuch as divers Nations of the ancient <HI>Heathens</HI> of other parts of the World, worshipp'd the Likeness of a Serpent. And even amongst the <HI>Greeks,</HI> according to <HI>Plutarch, Hesychius, Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI> and others, it was no unusual thing in their religious Worship to call on <HI>Eva,</HI> and at the same time to shew a Serpent. <HI>Plutarchus</HI> and <HI>Aelianus</HI> say, That the <HI>Egyptians</HI> honour'd a Serpent for their God.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. New Mexico.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds of <HI>New Mexico.</HI></NOTE><HI>NEw Mexico</HI> (as 'tis call'd for distinction's sake) is bounded on the South-West, with <HI>New Biscay;</HI> more directly Westward, with some parts of <HI>Quivira;</HI> the Countreys Northward of it not yet discover'd; Eastward it extends it self as far as <HI>Florida.</HI></P>
<P>This Province doubtless for largeness may compare with <HI>New Gallicia,</HI> having been search'd and discover'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> above a hundred, some say two hun∣dred Leagues directly Eastward, and to the North-East: and they report Wonders of it, if we may believe them, at least in respect of what was generally found in these Northern parts of <HI>America</HI> at their first Discovery; as namely, That they have Towns fairly and well built of Lime and Stone, Houses of four Stories high, and most of them provided with Stoves for the Winter Season, as well as any in <HI>Europe;</HI> the Streets fair and broad, and the People as curious and expert in divers Arts and Manufactures as any of theirs. More particularly they tell us of a Town call'd <HI>Chia,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Cuames,</HI> so big, that it is said to contain eight several Mar∣ket-places. Another call'd <HI>Acoma,</HI> a great Town, but seated on the top of an high Rock, without any ordinary way of access to it, but by a pair of Stairs hewn out of the hard Stone, or else by certain Ladders, which the Inhabitants let down and take up as they please. And likewise of a third, which they call <HI>Conibas,</HI> containing, as they say, no less than seven Leagues in length, and about half so much in breadth,
<PB N="292" REF="185"/>seated upon a Lake, but scatteringly built, and much of the space taken up with Mountains and many fair Gardens, in the midst of which the Town standeth; of all which more hereafter. This certain, that the Countrey to which they give the Name of <HI>New Mexico,</HI> is of a vast extent, reaching from the Mines of <HI>St. Barbara</HI> in <HI>New Biscay</HI> Eastward, and to the North-East, above two hundred Leagues al∣ready discorver'd, but doubtless taking up no small part of those Countreys which are sometimes assign'd to <HI>Florida,</HI> if not of the Confines of <HI>Virginia</HI> also.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Travels of <HI>Ruyz Espejus</HI> and others.</NOTE>This Countrey was first, <HI>Anno</HI> 1581. discover'd by a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Monk, nam'd <HI>Augustine Ruyz,</HI> who with two other Monks of his Order, got eight Soldiers of <HI>Conde de Coruna,</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>New Spain,</HI> for his Companions; with whom he tra∣vell'd from the Valley <HI>Sant Bartholomew,</HI> to the Province <HI>De los Tiguas,</HI> where one of the two Monks was kill'd by the Natives, which occasion'd such a fear amongst the Souldiers, who judg'd themselves too weak to make any resistance, that they resolv'd to return, notwithstanding all the arguments which <HI>Ruyz</HI> us'd to disswade them from it; yet nevertheless he and his Brother <HI>Franciscus Lopez,</HI> and four <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> went onward of their Journey; which news the Souldiers carried back to the <HI>Franciscans</HI> in <HI>Sant Bartholomew;</HI> who fearing their Brethren would be destroy'd, sent several Souldiers and a Monk, call'd <HI>Bernardyn Beltran,</HI> after them, who were also accompanied by <HI>Antony Espejus,</HI> who spent a great part of his Estate in raising of Men, providing Arms and Provisions, loading therewith a hundred and fifty Horses and Mules; with which he travell'd direct North from the fore-mention'd Valley, and after two days Journey found a People call'd <HI>Conchi,</HI> who went naked, and liv'd in Huts built together like a Village: They were Govern'd by <HI>Casiques,</HI> fed on Hares, Deer, Rabbets, <HI>Maiz, Calabashes,</HI> and Melons. Several adjacent Ri∣vers afford them plenty of Fish. They were amaz'd at the Crosses which the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> there erected, till they were inform'd of a Crucifi'd Saviour. <HI>Espejus</HI> being every where kindly Entertain'd amongst them, and conducted twenty two Leagues father, came amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Passaguates,</HI> of the like Constitution with the <HI>Conchi's;</HI> who had skill in Minerals, and judg'd that there were many Silver Mines in that Countrey. From whence the <HI>Passaguates</HI> travell'd with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the Borders of the <HI>Los Tobosos,</HI> who no sooner saw them, but they fled, because a few years before they had been miserably dealt with by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but being inform'd by the Interpreters, that they needed not be afraid of any thing, they all appear'd, and conducted <HI>Espejus</HI> to the Borders of the <HI>Patarabueyes;</HI> which People possess a large Countrey, Stone Houses and Villages built in good order. Great Rivers with come out of the North, and others that disembogu'd into the North Sea, af∣forded them all sorts of Fish; as also the Woods plenty of Venison, Fowls, and wholsom Plants. In some Pools also the salt Water afforded Salt.</P>
<P>The Valour of the Inhabitants may sufficiently appear by the rough Entertain∣ment which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> met withall the first Night; for the <HI>Patarabueyes</HI> fell so fiercely upon them, that had not the Watch given notice thereof in time, none had escap'd with Life; nevertheless five Horses were kill'd, and a considerable num∣ber of Men wounded: after which retreating, they went upon a neighboring Hill, whither <HI>Espejus</HI> sent his Interpreter, and an <HI>Indian</HI> the same Countrey, to inform them, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came not to molest them, and if they pleas'd to come to them, they should meet with none but Friends; which was the more easily credi∣ted, because the <HI>Casiques</HI> receiv'd some Presents; after which being reconcild, they conducted the <HI>Spaniards</HI> twelve days Journey up a long River, whose Banks were inhabited in several places. from thence they reach'd to a Place, inhabited by a People richly Cloth'd, who also seem'd to have some knowledge of God; for in
<PB N="293" REF="185"/>their Discourse they pointed up to Heaven, call'd the Creator and Preserver of all things <HI>Apalito,</HI> and signifi'd that they had receiv'd that Knowledge formerly from those that were left of <HI>Pamphilius Narvaez</HI>'s Army, who having rang'd through <HI>Florida</HI> were driven hither.</P>
<P>These People also Presented <HI>Espejus</HI> many tann'd Skins, with which he went to a great Village, the Inhabitants whereof were very courteous, and barter'd them for brave Plumes of Feathers and Cotton Cloaks, streak'd with blue and white: but <HI>Espejus</HI> having no Interpreters whom they could understand, could not learn by what Name they were known; yet by signs they express'd what time of the year they had Precious Stones brought to them; and also what their Countrey produ∣ced; and also that abundance of those Riches was to be found in a Province about five days Journey Westward from thence, whither they freely offer'd to conduct the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which accordingly they did, bearing them company one and twenty Leagues to the next Province, inhabited by a People whose Name also they could not be inform'd of, yet staying three days amongst them, they were Entertain'd with Presents and Dances both Night and Day. The Countrey afforded them also store of Venison and Fruits: Those that understood Minerals, judg'd that there were likewise several Gold Mines.</P>
<P>Leaving this Province, they entred into a great Wilderness of Pine-Trees, in which they travell'd twelve Leagues in fifteen days, without seeing either Man or House; but at the end of the Wood they spy'd a Village of Straw Huts, where there were great quantities of white Salt, and Deer Skins neatly dress'd. The Peo∣ple of the Place courteously Entertain'd the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and conducted them along the River <HI>Del Norte,</HI> to <HI>New Mexico:</HI> The Banks of the River on each side was plan∣ted with Nut-Trees and Vines, which spread themselves out above three Leagues; through which they had scarce pass'd three days together, when they saw ten Po∣pulous Villages pleasantly seated on the the said River, from whence came many thou∣sands of the Natives to meet <HI>Espejus,</HI> who was not so much amaz'd at the great number of People, as at their extraordinary Civility and decent Habits; for they Entertain'd him with well dress'd Meat, roasted Poultrey, and pleasant Fruits: Their Garments were Cotton Cloaks, Deer-skin Breeches, Shoes and Boots of good Leather. The Women wore their Hair neatly Comb'd and Pleited. Their Houses were almost four Stories high, handsomely built, and divided into fair Chambers, had Stoves or Cells under Ground against the Cold in the Winter. Every Village was Govern'd by a <HI>Casique,</HI> whose Commands were publish'd by the <HI>Alguaziles.</HI> Each House had a peculiar place in which their Idol stood, before whom they set Meat twice a day. Near the High-ways stood Temples very curiously painted, wherein their Deity, as they say, diverted himself in his Progress from one Village to ano∣ther. At certain Distances near their Plough'd Lands, stood <HI>Portico's,</HI> supported on four Columns, under which the Husband-man us'd to eat, and take his Noon-sleep. Besides their Swords, which were strong enough to cut a Man through the Middle, they us'd Bowes and Arrows: Their Shields were made of Deer Skins.</P>
<P><HI>Espejus</HI> having stay'd here four days, went to the Province <HI>De las Tiguas,</HI> which had sixteen Villages; in the chiefest whereof, call'd <HI>Poala, Augustine Ruyz</HI> and his Brother Monk <HI>Franciscus de Lopez</HI> had been slain, besides four others; wherefore the People being conscious of this Crime, and fearing that Revenge would follow, fled to the Mountains, from whence they could not be enticed, whilst the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found their Houses full of Provisions and some Minerals.</P>
<P>Now those being dead whom they sought for, some though it convenient to re∣turn; but <HI>Espejus</HI> and <HI>Beltran</HI> perswaded the contrary, alledging, That farther up,
<PB N="294" REF="186"/>according to the <HI>Indians</HI> information, lay several Provinces which were worth the discovery, and advis'd that the chiefest part of their Forces might stay there, whilst they and some few resolute Men went farther upon the Discovery, which accor∣dingly was perform'd. <HI>Espejus</HI> having travell'd two days, came into a fruitful Province, jutting against <HI>Cibola,</HI> in which he found eleven Villages, inhabited by above fourteen thousand People, who were clad in Skins and Cotton, worshipp'd many Idols, and receiv'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with great Civility.</P>
<P>The like Entertainment they met withall in the Countrey <HI>Los Quires,</HI> wash'd by the River <HI>Del Norte;</HI> near which stood five Villages, inhabited by about fifteen thousand People.</P>
<P>Thirteen Leagues farther they found <HI>De los Cunames,</HI> having also five Villages, the chiefest of which being <HI>Cia,</HI> boasted (as above mention'd) eight Market-places: The Houses, made of Lime, were neatly Painted, and compris'd in all above twenty thousand Persons, and civil People, who presented <HI>Espejus</HI> and his Company with handsom Cloaks, set good boyl'd Meat before them, and shew'd them rich Minerals, and the Mountains out of which they got the same.</P>
<P>Of the like Constitution were the Inhabitants <HI>De los Amires,</HI> which being thirty thousand in number, resided in seven well built Villages, lying North-West from <HI>Cunames.</HI></P>
<P>After this they march'd Westward, and found the eminent Village <HI>Acoma,</HI> men∣tion'd before, built on an exceeding high Rock, to which led onely a narrow Path up a pair of Stairs cut in the Rock; as also many Wells to receive Rain, besides what they have out of a River, led by moats round about their Plough'd Lands. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> staying here three days, were Entertain'd with all sorts of good Meat, Dances and Drolls.</P>
<P>From hence travelling twenty four Leagues more Westerly, they entred the Pro∣vince of <HI>Zuny;</HI> where the erected Crosses which had remain'd there till that time, were sufficient testimonies of <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s having been there, after he was deserted by <HI>Andreas de Cuyocan. Casper de Mexico,</HI> and <HI>Antonius de Guadalajara,</HI> being setled on <HI>Zuny,</HI> (otherwise call'd <HI>Cibola</HI>) and speaking the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue better than their Native Language, inform'd <HI>Espejus,</HI> that sixty days Journey farther lay a great Lake, whose Shores were crown'd with many brave Villages, inhabited by a People which wore Golden Armlets and Ear-rings; whither <HI>Franciscus Vasquez</HI> had gone a second time, had not Death prevented him. This Information so encourag'd <HI>Espejus,</HI> that notwithstanding it was so great a Journey, yet he resolv'd to venture thither, though the Monk <HI>Beltran</HI> and most of his Company perswaded him to the contrary; whereupon <HI>Beltran</HI> return'd: After which <HI>Espejus</HI> went on to the said Lake; wither he was accompanied with a hundred and fifty <HI>Indians.</HI> Having gone twenty six Leagues, he found a populous Province, whose Borders he no sooner approach'd, but he was told, <HI>That if he was willing to lose his Life, he and his Party might enter into a forbidden Dominion;</HI> yet notwithstanding this threatnign Message, he wrought so much upon the <HI>Casique</HI> by the Presents which he sent him, that he was permitted to come in freely; nay, the Inhabitants of <HI>Zaguato</HI> strow'd Meal on the Earth for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to go over, and presented <HI>Espejus</HI> at his departure with forty thousand Cotton Cloaks, and a considerable quantity of Plate, which he sent with five of his Soldiers, and all the <HI>Cibolan Indians,</HI> back to <HI>Cibola,</HI> keeping onely four Companions and one Guide, with whom he travell'd forty one Leagues Westward; where he found a Mountain, to the top whereof led a broad Path; which ascend∣ing, he took up Silver Oar with his own Hand. The several sorts of People that inhabited here were all civil and courteous, living in good fashion, in pretty large
<PB N="295" REF="186"/>Houses, built on the Banks of a pleasant River, shaded with Vines and Nut-Trees, and thick planted with Flax: They inform'd <HI>Espejus,</HI> that near a River which runs eight Miles towards the North Sea, were such stately Places, as could not be beheld without great admiration. But <HI>Espejus</HI> going back a plain Road to <HI>Cibola,</HI> found not onely those whom he had sent from <HI>Zaguato,</HI> but also <HI>Beltran,</HI> with the other Soldiers, who having been detained where by the Civilities and kind Entertain∣ments of the <HI>Indians,</HI> were now upon returning home; so that <HI>Espejus</HI> was left alone with eight Soldiers, who resolv'd to venture their Lives and Fortunes with him. They travell'd along the River <HI>Del Norte,</HI> through the Provinces <HI>De los Guires</HI> and <HI>Habutas,</HI> whose Mountains, over-spread with Pine-Trees and Cedars, have many rich Mines. The Natives wore painted Cotton Cloaks, and dwelt in stately Houses five Stories high. At the Borders of the Realm <HI>Los Tamos</HI> they were stopt, and not permitted to come on farther; wherefore being but few in number, and several of them sick, they judg'd it convenient to cross the River <HI>De las Vaccas</HI> (so call'd from the abundance of Cows that were thereabouts) to the River <HI>Conchos</HI> and the Village <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> where <HI>Espejus</HI> was inform'd, that <HI>Beltran</HI> was long before his arrival gone to <HI>Guadiana.</HI></P>
<P>And now that we may have the better Account of <HI>New Mexico</HI> (which <HI>Ruyz Espejus,</HI> and <HI>Beltran</HI> endeavor'd to discover) it will be necessary to begin with the first original thereof, according as several ancient. Histories make mention.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First original of the <HI>New Mexicans.</HI></NOTE>The most ancient Possessors of that part of <HI>Northern America</HI> call'd <HI>New Spain,</HI> were for their fierce and salvage Nature call'd <HI>Chichimecae,</HI> who dwelling in Caves, fed on Moles, Rabbets, Hedghogs, Serpents, Roots and Herbs. Whilst the Women accompanied their Husbands in their Travels, the Children were put into Baskets, and hang'd in a Tree. No manner of Government was to be found amongst them. They never Till'd their Ground till the <HI>Navatlacans</HI> came from <HI>New Mexico</HI> (which was anciently divided into two Countreys, <HI>Aztlan</HI> and <HI>Teuculhuacan</HI>) to <HI>New Spain;</HI> after which they Sow'd their Lands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Navatlacans</HI> (who us'd to dwell in Houses, worship Images, plough their Lands, and obey their Governors) were divided into six Tribes, each Tribe posses∣sing their limited Bounds: and there goes a Tradition, That out of six Pits that are to be seen in <HI>New Mexico,</HI> the <HI>Navatlacans</HI> had their original. The time when they deserted <HI>New Mexico,</HI> as their most authentick Histories or Records declare, was (according to our computation) <HI>Anno</HI> 940. and they farther affirm, that they spent forty years in a Journey, which might have been travell'd in a Moneth: The reason of which tediousness was, because they rested in all places where they found a fruitful Countrey; but as they had advice from their diabolical Spirits, which (as they say) appear'd visibly to them, they still went on farther and farther, yet left behind those that were aged, sick, and decrepid, building convenient Houses for them, and appointing Overseers to look after them. The Ruins of the Houses are yet to be seen on the Way along which they pass'd.</P>
<P>The six Tribes divided themselves after this manner: Four of them setled round about the great Lake of <HI>Mexico.</HI> The <HI>Sichumilans</HI> taking the South part, built, besides two other Towns, a Metropolis of their own Name, as the <HI>Chalcans</HI> on the North. The <HI>Tapunecans</HI> built <HI>Azcapuzalco</HI> in the West, which signifies <HI>A Pismires Hole,</HI> because of the abundance of Inhabitants. The Eastern part was taken up by the <HI>Chalhuans.</HI> And all these Names have a peculiar signification; the first signifies <HI>People of Flowry Fields;</HI> the second, <HI>People of Mouthes;</HI> the third, <HI>People of Bridges;</HI> and the fourth, <HI>Crooked People.</HI> Not long after, the <HI>Tatluicans,</HI> a strong People, went over the Mountains on the other side of the <HI>Mexican</HI> Lake, where they built several Towns
<PB N="296" REF="187"/>on a hot, yet fruitful Soil, the chiefest whereof they call'd <HI>Quahunachua,</HI> that is, <HI>A Place where an Eagles Voice is heard.</HI> The <HI>Tlascaltecans</HI> went near the Snowy Moun∣tains, one, of which, being between <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>De los Angelos,</HI> vomits horrid Flames and Smoke up into the Skie. Here scattering up and down, they built several Vil∣lages, besides the City <HI>Tlascalla;</HI> the Inhabitants whereof assisted the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as hath been related in the taking of <HI>Mexico,</HI> for which good Service they live free, without paying any Tribute.</P>
<P>When these six Tribes came first from <HI>Mexico</HI> thither, the <HI>Chichimecans</HI> made little or no resistance against them, but hid themselves amongst the Rocks: yet some of them not long after taking courage, flew to Arms, and had without doubt destroy'd the <HI>Tlascallans,</HI> had not a subtile Plot sav'd them: for under a shew of Friendship they falling on the unarm'd <HI>Chichimecans,</HI> kill'd every Man of them.</P>
<P><HI>Joseph de Acosta</HI> tells us, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1586. he saw a Grave in <HI>Mexico,</HI> wherein a <HI>Chi∣chimecan</HI> of a Gygantick size lay buried.</P>
<P>After this Conquest gotten by the <HI>Tlascallans,</HI> the fore-mention'd six Tribes liv'd in Peace and Quiet, and strengthned themselves the more by Marrying into one anothers Families.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chichimecae</HI> keeping on the Mountains left the new People in quiet posses∣sion of their Lands, nay, learnt some of their Customs, insomuch that they be∣gan to build Huts, chuse Governors, and live according to their Laws.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first March of the <HI>Mexicans</HI> in∣to <HI>New Spain</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Tlascallans</HI> having possess'd <HI>New Spain</HI> three hundred and two years, a seventh Tribe (a valiant and civiliz'd People) came thither, upon their Daemon <HI>Viztli∣puztli</HI>'s promise of having the supream Government: wherefore he was carried in an Ark by four chief Priests, whom he inform'd whither and when they should travel or rest, for where ever they stopt, they built a Tent in the middle of their Army for their Idol, whom they set on an Altar; which done, they Sow'd the Ground about them: yet if their <HI>Daemon</HI> commanded them to march before Harvest, then they left the Product to the ancient and sick People. But at last <HI>Mexi,</HI> from whence the Name of <HI>Mexico</HI> is deriv'd, conducted the Army into <HI>Mechaocan,</HI> where the pleasant Soil among the Lakes entic'd many to take up their Habitation. But <HI>Mexi</HI> proceeded on his Journey, yet not without great Crosses, in regard <HI>Viztli∣puztli</HI>'s Sister (some Inchantress probably so call'd) did much hurt to the whole Army by her Sorceries, because they would not honor her as a Goddess, till <HI>Viztli∣puztli</HI> inform'd one of them that carried the Ark, that the Army should march on, and banish the Witch from them: whereupon she accordingly being driven away, built the Village <HI>Malinalco,</HI> as a Habitation for Conjurers. Mean while, the Army grew weaker and weaker by their leaving so many People behind them in most places; therefore they judg'd it convenient to rest a while in <HI>Tula,</HI> where a great River water'd the Countrey; which, according to <HI>Viztlipuztli</HI>'s Commands, being dry'd up, made a large Lake about the Mountain <HI>Coatepeck,</HI> whose Banks being planted with Willow and Poplar-Trees, were exceeding pleasant, and the more, because of the variety of Birds that made their Nests in the same; which so delighted ma∣ny of the People, that being tir'd with travelling, they resolv'd to settle there; which Resolution was so ill resented by <HI>Viztlipuztli,</HI> that he commanded the Bank to be broken, that the Water might have liberty to flow its former Course, and threat∣ned them with heavy punishments: after which in the Night a terrible Cry of Murder was heard in one part of the Army; which being inquir'd after the next Morning, they found divers People lying on the Ground with their Breasts cut open, and their Hearts pull'd out: whereupon those that remain'd went on to <HI>Chapultepec,</HI> where they fortifi'd themselves in the Mountains against the adjacent

But not satisfi'd with this cruelty, they sent for her Father to visit his Daughter in her Dignity; who ac∣cordingly coming with great Attendance, was led into a dark Chappel, where by the burning Tapers he knew the Goddess to be no other than his Daughters Skin stuff'd full of Cotton; whereat burning with rage, he afterwards fell upon these Murderers with all his Forces, and drove them to the Place where they afterwards built <HI>Mexico,</HI></P>
<P>We have often made mention heretofore of the Governor of this Journey, <HI>Viztlipuztli,</HI> it will therefore be necessary to give an exacter Description of him, as followeth:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Image <HI>Viztlipuztli.</HI></NOTE>He was a woodden Image like a Man, sitting on a blue Seat in a triumphant Chair; at each end of which was plac'd a Staff with a Serpents Head upon it, from whose Forehead, which was Painted blue, ran a Streak of the same colour, cross his Nose to both his Ears; upon his Head stood a Plume of Feathers, the ends whereof were tipp'd with a golden Varnish; his left Hand held a white Shield, on which stuck five Feathers, and on the top a Laurel Bough; next the Shield lay four Arrows, pretended to be sent from Heaven; in his right Hand a Truncheon, full of blue crooked Streaks like Serpents; behind on his Shoulders appear'd Wings, not unlike those of a Bat, his Eyes large and round, and his Mouth reaching from Ear to Ear, made him terrible to behold, also gaping, and full of Teeth, which stuck out of his Belly; in his Breast also were two fiery Eyes, and under them a shrivell'd Nose; his Feet ended in Claws, hung round about with Precious Jems, golden Boxes and Shields set out with divers colour'd Feathers. The Curtain be∣hind which this Idol sat, was not drawn open except on a Feast-Day.</P>
<P>Next <HI>Viztlipuztli</HI> stood generally a lesser Image, call'd <HI>Tlaboc,</HI> and also the God∣dess <HI>Tocci,</HI> Daughter to the Prince of <HI>Culhuacan,</HI> who (as before mention'd) was flay'd by their <HI>Daemon</HI>'s Command. Since which time they suppos'd, that they were never more acceptable to their Gods, than when they appear'd Cloth'd in an∣other Man's Skin; and accounted no Offering better, than a Heart taken out of their Enemies Breast, since their Spirit destroy'd so many after that manner in the Army at <HI>Tula.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Tocci,</HI> they say, had also a Son much inclin'd to Hunting,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Yocci</HI>'s Festi∣val.</NOTE> whose Image they carry, attended by a thousand People, with the sound of Horns and Trumpets, to an Arbor on a high Mountain; which being made of green Leaves pleited, had in the middle an Altar, on which they set the Idol, whilst the Multitude surrounded

The whole extent of the Province gene∣rally so term'd, hath been reputed to comprehend the suppos'd <HI>Peninsula</HI> it self, <HI>Ci∣bola, Quivira,</HI> and <HI>Nova Albion;</HI> but since, according to the best Maps and Discove∣ries, there seems little doubt to be made, that <HI>California,</HI> strictly taken, is a perfect Island: and since upon that Consideration we have reserved it to be describ'd amongst the Islands of <HI>Northern America,</HI> we also consequently judge it most requi∣site to consider those Countreys apart that were included in the extended <HI>California.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation, Tempera∣ture, and Productions of <HI>Cibola.</HI></NOTE><HI>Cibola</HI> lieth Southward of <HI>Quivira,</HI> betwixt it and <HI>New Gallicia,</HI> to the North and East: on the West it hath <HI>Mar Vermiglio,</HI> or the Bay of <HI>California.</HI> The Air of the Province is indifferently temperate, especially if compar'd to the sharp Frosts and Colds of <HI>Quivira.</HI> The Countrey is for the most part level and plain, as <HI>Quivira</HI> is, having but few Trees in it, except here and there some Woods of Cedars, which yet do abundantly supply the Natives both with Timber and Fewel. The Ground affords plenty of <HI>Maiz,</HI> and some small white Pease, of both which they usually make Bread. There is great store of Venison, and a kind of Sheep (as they say, and as it should seem by their Fleece) as big as some little Horses or Oxen, some of their Horns weighing forty or fifty Pound: But perhaps by some mistake of Authors, this Beast may be no other than <HI>Taurus Mexicans,</HI> elsewhere describ'd, whose Hair is extreamly thick and shaggy, and of which they make Cloth as of Wool, as hath been said. There are also Lyons, Bears, and Tygers in this Province, in such numbers, that the People of the Countrey are not a little troubled with them, and would gladly destroy them if they knew how. The People are generally well Limb'd, tall of Stature, and seem to be a little more Ingenious than their Neigh∣bors of <HI>Quivira;</HI> yet they go naked many of them, onely cover'd with Mantles made of Skins, which are many times painted, and that with such Curiosity and Art, as do sufficiently argue, that neither themselves nor their Neighbors of <HI>Quivira,</HI> from whom they have them in Traffick, do make them, but that they are the Merchan∣dise and Commodity of some other Nations, perhaps of <HI>Cathay</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> who, by the North-West Seas, do Trade with the Maritime Parts, and People of <HI>Quivira.</HI></P>
<P>This part of the Countrey hath been reasonably well search'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but as yet nothing discover'd so considerable, as to perswade them to stay in it.</P>
<P>That which seems most observable, is the great Lake <HI>Tonteac,</HI> situate almost in the midst of the Province; upon which, or near unto it, they found seven or eight old Towns of the Natives, some whereof contain'd four or five hundred of their Cottages or little Houses, and were fortifi'd also with Ramparts, and other Works of Defence, so as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not become Masters of them, but by Force and Storming: In the attempt whereof <HI>Vasquez Coronado,</HI> their Commander in chief, was twice beaten down with Stones by the Natives; yet at last carrying the Place, he found in it good plenty of <HI>Maiz</HI> indeed, which was some refreshment to his Army, but nothing else: whereupon having nam'd the Place <HI>Granada,</HI> in memory of the Vice-Roy of <HI>New Spain,</HI> who sent him upon that Expedition, he departed. In his return homeward he fell upon a certain Countrey, which he nam'd <HI>Tu∣cayan,</HI> of which his Companions report great matters; as first, of a certain River call'd <HI>Huex,</HI> on the Banks whereof, in the space of twenty Leagues, or thereabouts, there stand no less than fifteen good Burroughs, well built, and furnish'd likewise with Stoves or Hot-houses, against the Cold, as in other Countreys of <HI>Europe;</HI> as also of a very fruitful and pleasant Valley, which they therefore call'd <HI>Aroba de Cora∣zones;</HI> of another great Town and Territory, call'd <HI>Chichilticala;</HI> and lastly, of the Valley of <HI>Nuestra Sennora,</HI> or <HI>Our Ladies Dale,</HI> in the South parts of the said Terri∣tory, all of them describ'd for such rich and delicious Places, that some take them for the <HI>Campi Elisii</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> especially seeing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were never known to visit them a second time, the Discoveries that have been made since being onely of the North-West Parts of the Countrey, along the Coasts of <HI>Mar Vermiglio,</HI> and this no farther than onely to give Name to certain Capes or Promontories which they met with, as namely 1. <HI>Porto de St. Clara,</HI> near to the Mouth of the River which they call <HI>Rio del Nordt.</HI> 2. <HI>Las Playas.</HI> 3. <HI>St. Michael.</HI> 4. <HI>Lago del Oro,</HI> which bordereth on <HI>Quivira;</HI> and lastly, <HI>El Rey Coronado,</HI> Eastward of that.</P>

<P><HI>TOntonteac</HI> is mention'd by so few,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tontonteac</NOTE> and by those few so obscurely, that it can∣not well be determin'd to be any other than that Countrey which lies about the great Lake <HI>Tonteac,</HI> above spoken of in <HI>Cibola,</HI> and which being made Habitable by six or seven Towns not inconsiderable for Habitations of native <HI>Indians,</HI> might haply pass for a distinct Province. And perhaps the reason why this Province hath been so obscure, and little taken notice of, might be from the ruine of these Towns by War, or some other Accident: and to this purpose are the words of a late Wri∣ter, <HI>The Province of</HI> Tontonteac (saith he) <HI>hath five Houses onely left, which stand on the Shore of a salt Lake.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Nova Granada</HI> (saith he) consists of seven Villages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Descrip∣tion.</NOTE> built in the circumference of four Leagues, the chiefest whereof boasts two hundred Houses, which for the most part are four or five Stories high, and built of Stone; the Cellars thereto belong∣ing, being neatly Pav'd, serve for Stoves against the Cold: they ascend to their upper Rooms by Ladders. The Inhabitants go naked, onely some Covering about their Middle, and over their Shoulders Cotton Cloaks, painted with divers Co∣lours. They live on <HI>Maiz,</HI> white Pease, Hares, Rabbets, and Venison: their Salt wherewith they season the same, they fetch from a neighboring Lake. The Tur∣kies, which they have in great numbers, are kill'd onely for their Feathers, not∣withstanding their Flesh is exceeding good Meat. The Soil is for the most part plain, yet hath some high Mountains; and the Pastures flourish with Grass. The Woods abound with Bears, Tygers, Lyons, wild Hogs, Rhinocerots, and the like ravenous Beasts, which make the Ways dangerous for Travellers. Besides large Deer, there are also Sheep, which in bigness may compare with Horses, having ex∣ceeding great Horns, and little Tails.</P>
<P>Concerning the abundance of <HI>Turkoises,</HI> of which <HI>Niza</HI> makes mention, <HI>Cornato</HI> could give no certain account, because a little before his Arrival the <HI>Granadians</HI> had convey'd their Children, which were under fifteen, and the aged People, who were above sixty years of age, with their chiefest Goods, into remote places. However, it is not unknown, that this Countrey affords <HI>Turkoises;</HI> for <HI>Cornato</HI> in his Journey to <HI>Quivira,</HI> Besieg'd a City in these Parts near a great River; the Inhabitants whereof, when they were not able to defend themselves any longer, throwing their Cloaks, <HI>Turkoises,</HI> and other Riches into the Fire, Sallied out upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and died not altogether unreveng'd, as shall be specifi'd more at large in the Description of <HI>Tignes,</HI> which being nam'd among the Towns of <HI>Quivira,</HI> will upon the compa∣ring of Circumstances, be apparently found to be the same with this.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Quivira.</HEAD>
<P><HI>QUivira</HI> is the next Region accounted of <HI>California,</HI> largely taken; yet appear∣ing by some Charts to lie so vastly remote, that all <HI>New Mexico, Gallicia,</HI> and other Provinces already mention'd, lie between that and the Island. And whereas <HI>New Granada</HI> is by several made a part of <HI>New Mexico;</HI> yet most cer∣tain it it is, that by some it is confounded with this Countrey, or at least accounted a part thereof, as hereafter shall more plainly appear, according to the Account of those that have most fully and particularly describ'd it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of <HI>Quivira,</HI> and Description of the Inha∣bitants.</NOTE><HI>Quivira</HI> takes up the most Northern and unknown part of <HI>America</HI> towards the West, reaching as far as the supposed <HI>Straight</HI> of <HI>Anian</HI> aforesaid (if there be any such) or else joyning to the Continent of <HI>Tartary.</HI> It is likewise the least fruitful part of all the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> especially for Corn. Cattel it hath good store, and Pa∣sturage indifferent good, the Countrey being for the most plain and level, and no∣thing else but Pasturage. The Natives are few and salvage, living in Hoards or great Companies together, after the manner of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> to whom they are Neighbors, and (as it is not improbably thought) of their Race. The Men Clothe themselves most commonly in that kind of Oxes Hide, elsewhere spoken of under the Name of <HI>Taurus Mexicanus.</HI> The Women wear little else but their Hair, notwithstanding the Countrey, especially for one half of the year, is excessive cold. Their Cattel, though they are much less than the ordinary Kine of <HI>Europe,</HI> are the chief Sustenance and Employment of the Natives; by Pasturing huge Herds whereof from place to place, the People live, and maintain a Traffick with other Parts. Yet some of them inhabit Towns, the chief whereof, as yet discover'd, seem to be these which follow:</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns of chief note.</NOTE>1. <HI>Acus,</HI> or <HI>Acuco,</HI> a small Town, but seated in a strong defensible place, and being a great Staple for Cotton, the Territory about it hath been taken for a di∣stinct Province, and by some call'd <HI>The Kingdom of Acuco.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Tignes,</HI> a Town seated upon the Banks of a River bearing the same Name, and inhabited, it seems, by a stout and resolute People, and whom the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> coming amongst them in the Year 1540. had much ado to master: for they endur'd a Siege for the space of six Weeks; and at last finding themselves so strongly begirt by their Enemies, that there was no means to escape but by Death, or yielding up themselves, rather than they would fall alive into their hands, they first buried and spoil'd all such Treasure as they had (which were chiefly Saphires, and a few other Gems, that the Countrey afforded) and after that setting on fire their Houshold-stuff, they took their Wives and Children with them, and made a desperate Sally out upon the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> wherein although they were most of them slain, and trod under the Horses Feet, or drown'd in passing the River, yet was it not without some loss to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves: nor would those few that were left behind deliver up the Town, till it was fir'd about their Ears, and that they could no longer abide in it. This Town, by all Circumstances, must needs be the same with that before mention'd in <HI>Nova Granada,</HI> which makes good what we have said above, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>New Granada</HI> is by some confounded with, or at least taken for a part of this Region.</P>
<PB N="302" REF="192"/>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Cicuic,</HI> another small Town, four days Journey from <HI>Tignes.</HI> The Countrey about this place, although generally it be all good Pasturage, and maintains abun∣dance of Cattel, yet is it so open and plain, that for almost a hundred Miles toge∣ther, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in their March hither from <HI>New Spain,</HI> found neither Stone nor Tree, nor any thing else that could serve them for a Land-mark; so that they were forc'd, as they march'd along, to raise up Heaps of Cow-dung, to serve them for direction in their coming back, which was not long after: for not finding the Com∣modities they sought for, and fearing to be surpris'd by Winter in those cold Coun∣treys, where they had no kind, of accommodation, they made somewhat a hasty Retreat, leaving behind them onely some few Religious Men, of the Order of <HI>St. Francis,</HI> whose Endeavours to do the People good by Converting them to the true Knowledge and Worship of Almighty God, procur'd them not long after, the Crown of Martyrdom, being murder'd all of them, except one, by the Natives, and he not without much difficulty escaping their Hands.</P>
<P><HI>NOva Albion</HI> was so denominated by Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nova Albion.</NOTE> when he was there Enter∣tain'd by the King of that Countrey; but whether it were in <HI>Quivira</HI> that he was thus Entertain'd, and left that Denomination, or in the Island of <HI>California,</HI> ap∣pears not either from the Relation, or from the common Consent of Cosmogra∣phers, since some there are, who will have <HI>Quivira</HI> and <HI>Nova Albion</HI> to be one and the same Province; others reckon it to be the utmost North-West part of <HI>California;</HI> others make it distinct from <HI>Quivira,</HI> yet determine it not to the Island <HI>California,</HI> seeming rather to make it an adjoyning Countrey to <HI>Quivira:</HI> wherefore finding little else that concerns the Description of the Place, except the said Voyage of <HI>Drake,</HI> we shall here set it down, and leave the farther Disquisition concerning the Situation of the Place, till we come to describe the Island of <HI>California</HI> it self.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s Ar∣rival there.</NOTE>Captain <HI>Francis Drake</HI> set Sail from <HI>Plymouth Anno</HI> 1577. and after much hardship getting through the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> arriv'd in the Haven <HI>Guatulco,</HI> having be∣fore his coming thither taken as many rich <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships in the Southern Ocean as he could possibly have wish'd for, so that his onely care now needed to have been how to get safe home; yet he put on a Resolution, not to come short of <HI>Ferdinandus Magellanus,</HI> who Saild about the World. Which brave Resolution of <HI>Drake</HI>'s was approv'd of by all his Sea-men; whereupon he set Sail along the North of <HI>Califor∣nia</HI> the fifth of <HI>June;</HI> being gotten into forty two Degrees, which was the farthest that <HI>Cabrillo</HI> went, he came on a sudden out of a warm Air into so frigid a Climate, that the Sea-men were almost kill'd with Cold, and the farther they went, the colder it grew; wherefore falling down three Degrees more Southerly, they got into a convenient Haven, where the Natives who liv'd along the Shore brought them Presents; which <HI>Drake</HI> left not unrequited, by returning them others, that were to them more novel, and not unuseful.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature and Habit of the People.</NOTE>These People are exceeding hardy; for, notwithstanding the extraordinary cold∣ness of the Climate, the Men go naked; but the Women wear Garments of pleited Flags or Rushes, which being put about their Middle, hang down to their Ancles; on their Stomachs hang the ends of a hairy Skin ty'd together, which hanging also over their Shoulders, cover their hinder Parts. They shew great Respect and Obedience to their Husbands. Each House is surrounded with an Earthen Wall, and all the Corners thereof being close stopp'd, and Fires made in the midst of them, they are very warm. Rushes and Flags strow'd thick on the Ground near the Walls, serve them in stead of Beds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> coming a second time to Visit the <HI>English,</HI> brought them Plumes of
<PB N="303" REF="192"/><FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Feathers, Neckbands of Net-work, and store of Tobacco: <HI>Drake</HI> pleas'd with this their kindness, built Tents on the Brow of a Hill, on the top of which the <HI>Indians</HI> stood that brought the Presents, whil'st one of them with a loud voice maintain'd a long Discourse; which he had no sooner ended, but everyone laid down his Bowe and Arrows, and walk'd unarm'd down to the Tents to proffer their Gifts: their Wives staying behind on the top, pinch'd their Cheeks, and made sad lamentation; which <HI>Drake</HI> suppos'd was because they made Offerings there: whereupon he also caus'd all his Men to kneel down and say their Prayers, which made the <HI>Indians</HI> to look very earnestly upon them, and to return him the Presents which the day before they had receiv'd of him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Drake</HI>'s En∣tertainment by the King of the Coun∣trey.</NOTE>The rumour of these Strangers arrival spreading all over the Countrey, made the Inhabitants far and near desirous to see them; the King himself sending Am∣bassadors to <HI>Drake,</HI> to inform him that he was on the Way coming to see him; all which the Agents related at large, and desir'd some Presents, as a testimony that their King should be welcome; which he being assur'd of, came with a Retinue of above twelve thousand Men, before whom walk'd one of a Gygantick size, carry∣ing a costly Scepter, on which, by three long Chains made of Bones, hung a great and a small Crown made of Feathers; next follow'd the King himself in a Sute of Cony-Skins; then came a great confus'd company of People, each of them carrying a Present: whereupon <HI>Drake</HI> putting his Men into good order, march'd to meet the King; at which the Mace-bearer made a long Preamble, and when he had done, Danc'd to the Tune of a Song, which he Sung himself; then the King and his whole Retinue also fell a Singing and Dancing so long, till being weary the King went to <HI>Drake,</HI> and humbly desir'd of him, that he would accept of the Realm, assuring him, that all the People should be under his Obedience; which said, he put the fore-mention'd Crown on his Head, and hanging three double Chains about his Neck, call'd him <HI>Hioh:</HI> whereupon <HI>Drake</HI> took possession of the Countrey in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Name.

<PB N="306" REF="196"/>it lies the most South of any in the Land, and most conveniently to receive our Shipping, passing to and from <HI>Virginia</HI> and the <HI>Bermuda</HI> Islands; and also any other Shipping that shall pass to and from the River of <HI>Canada,</HI> and the Coast there∣of, because they usually pass, and so return in the sight of the Land of <HI>Trespassey,</HI> and also for some other purposes, as shall be partly declar'd in the following Discourse.</P>
<P>The Soil of this Countrey in the Valleys and sides of the Mountains is so fruit∣ful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruitful Soil.</NOTE> as that in divers places the Summer naturally produceth without Tillage, great plenty of green Pease, and Fitches, fair, round, full, and as wholsom as ours in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Berries and Fruits.</NOTE>Of Berries and Fruits, there grows Strawberries, red and white, and as fair Raspice-berries and Goose-berries as there be in <HI>England;</HI> as also Bilberries, which are call'd by some <HI>Whortes,</HI> and many other delicate Berries peculiar to the Coun∣trey, in great abundance. Likewise small Pears, Cherries, Filberds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbs and Flowers.</NOTE>There are also Herbs for Sallets and Broth, as Parsly, Alexander, Sorrel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and also Flowers, as the red and white Damask Rose, with other kinds, which are most beautiful and delightful, both to the sight and smell. And questionless, the Coun∣trey is stor'd with many Physical Herbs, though their Vertues are not known.</P>
<P>When Corn was first Sow'n here, it was observ'd to grow very fair, the increase was great, and the Grain very good; and several sorts of Kitchin Plants that have been Set here, have prov'd very well.</P>
<P>In divers parts of the Countrey there is great store of Deer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> and some Hares, ma∣ny Foxes, Squerrils, Beavers, Martins and Otters, yielding excellent Furrs, Wolves and Bears, with other sorts of Beasts, serving as well for Necessity, as for Profit and Delight.</P>
<P>Variety both of Land and Water-Fowl is in this Countrey infinite:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE> The chief Land-Fowl, besides a great number of small Birds, that live by scraping their Food from the Earth in the hardest Winter, are Hawks, great and small Partridges, Thrush, and Thrussels abundance, very fat; as also Filladies, Nightingales, and such like, which sing most pleasantly. There are also Birds that live by prey, as Ravens, Gripes, Crows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For Water-Fowl, there is certainly so good, and as much variety, as in any part of the World, as Geese, Ducks, Pigeons, Gulls, Penguins, and many other sorts. These Penguins are as big as Geese, but do not flye, for they have but a little short Wing; and they multiply so infinitely upon a certain flat Island, that men drive them from thence upon a Board into their Boats by hundreds at a time, as if God had made the innocency of so poor a Creature to be∣come such an admirable Instrument for the sustentation of Man: And also God∣wits, Curlews, and such like; which Fowl do not onely serve those that Trade thither for Food, but also they are a great furthering to divers Ships Voyages, be∣cause the abundance of them is such, that the Fisher-men do bait their Hooks with the quarters of Sea-Fowl on them; and therewith some Ships do yearly take a great part of their Fishing Voyages with such Bait, before they can get others.</P>
<P>The fresh Waters and Springs of that Countrey are many in number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Springs.</NOTE> and with∣all so very pleasant, delightful and wholsom, that no Countrey in the World hath better: And Fewel for Fireing, no where more plentiful.</P>
<P>In like manner there is great abundance of Trees fit to be employ'd in other ser∣viceable uses:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees.</NOTE> There are Fir and Spruce-Trees, sound, good, and fit to Mast Ships with, and as commodious for Boards and Buildings as those of <HI>Norway;</HI> and out of these come abundance of Turpentine. Moreover the Pine and Birch-Trees here are scarce to be compar'd for heighth and greatness.</P>
<PB N="307" REF="196"/>
<P>The Rivers also and Harbours are generally stor'd with delicate Fish, as Salmons, Peals, Eels, Herrings, Mackrel, Flounders, Launce, Capelin, Cod, and Trouts, the fairest, fattest and sweetest, that ever were seen in these Parts. The like for Lobsters, Cra-fish, Mussles, and other variety of Shell-fish.</P>
<P>The Seas likewise all along the Coast, do plentifully abound in other sorts of Fish, as Whales, <HI>Spanish</HI> Mackrel, Dorrel, Pales, Herrings, Hogs, Porposes, Seals, and such like Royal Fish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But the chief Commodity of <HI>New found Land</HI> yet known, and which is grown to be a setled Trade, and that it may be much better'd by an ordinary Plantation there, (if the Traders thither will take some better course than formerly they have done, as shall be declared) is the Cod-fishing upon that Coast, by which our Nation and many other Countreys are enrich'd.</P>
<P>Almost incredible is the benefit of the Fish, which the <HI>French, Biscainers,</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> fetch yearly from this Coast of <HI>New-found Land,</HI> and the <HI>Bank,</HI> which lieth within twenty five Leagues from the South Cape of that Countrey, where the <HI>French</HI> use to Fish Winter and Summer, usually making two Voyages every year thither. To which Places, and to the Coast of <HI>Canada,</HI> which lieth near unto it, are yearly sent from those Countreys, more than four hundred Sail of Ships.</P>
<P>This Island of <HI>Terra Nova</HI> belongs properly and justly to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> having been under the sole Jurisdiction of the <HI>English</HI> from the first Discovery there∣of, which was by Sir <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> Employ'd by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, to find out some other part of <HI>America,</HI> than what had been discover'd by <HI>Columbus,</HI> as hath been above declar'd in several places.</P>
<P>Afterwards King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth continu'd the <HI>English</HI> Interest there, and Employ'd one <HI>Rutt</HI> into that Island, in order to the Plantation thereof.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> no less careful to preserve that Plantation, sent Sir <HI>Humphrey Gilbert,</HI> a <HI>Devonshire</HI> Knight, to plant a Colony there, the better to secure the same, and to increase Trading there; and accordingly the said Sir <HI>Humphrey</HI> with two good Ships and a Pinnace in her Name, took possession of that Countrey, in the Harbour of <HI>St. Johns.</HI> He Sail'd from thence towards <HI>Virginia,</HI> and by reason of some unhappy direction in his Course, the greatest Ship he had struck upon Shelves on the Coast of <HI>Canada,</HI> and was there lost, with most part of the Company in her; and he himself, being then in a small Pinnace of twenty Tun, in the company of his Vice-Admiral (Captain <HI>Hays</HI>) returning towards <HI>England,</HI> in a great Storm, was overwhelm'd in the Sea, and so perish'd.</P>
<P>In the Year 1608. it was undertaken anew by <HI>John Guy,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and with so good success, that the Colony in a short time were well furnish'd with Wheat, Rye, Barley, and other Grain of their own Sowing, with Turnips, Cole∣worts, and abundance of other necessary things, not without some probable hopes of Metals, a certain and plentiful Trade of Sables, Musk, and other rich Com∣modities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Province of <HI>Avalon</HI> in <HI>New-found Lands.</HI></NOTE>In the Year 1620. Sir <HI>George Calvert</HI> Knight, then principal Secretary of State, and a Privy Councellor to King <HI>James</HI> the First of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. purchas'd a part of <HI>New-found Land,</HI> which was afterwards in the Year 1623. granted to him and his Heirs by Patent from the said King, under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> bearing Date the seventh of <HI>April,</HI> in the One and twentieth Year of his Reign: by which means the said Tract of Land was erected into a Province, and at the Instance of the said Sir <HI>George Calvert,</HI> call'd <HI>Avalon,</HI> from <HI>Avalon</HI> in <HI>Sommerset-shire,</HI> where <HI>Christianity</HI> was first Planted in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This Province lies in the forty seventh Degree of Northern Latitude, and is thus
<PB N="308" REF="197"/>bounded: It begins Southerly from the middle part of a certain Neck of Land or Promontory, situate between the two Harbours, <HI>Fermose</HI> and <HI>Aquafort;</HI> and from thence following the Shore towards the North unto the middle part, or half way over a little Harbour, call'd in that regard <HI>Petit Port,</HI> or <HI>Petit Harbour,</HI> which boun∣deth upon the South part of the Plantation of <HI>St. Johns,</HI> including the one half of a certain fresh River, that falleth into the said Port of <HI>Petit Harbour;</HI> and so tending along the South Border of the said Colony of <HI>St. Johns,</HI> extendeth it self to a certain little Bay, commonly call'd <HI>Salmon Cove,</HI> lying on the South side of the Bay of <HI>Conception,</HI> including the one half of the River that falleth into the said <HI>Cove,</HI> as also one half of the <HI>Cove</HI> it self; from whence passing along the Shore of the said Bay towards the South, and reaching unto the bottom thereof, where it meets with the Lands of the fore-mention'd <HI>John Guy,</HI> nam'd <HI>Sea Forrest,</HI> is bounded with a cer∣tain River or Brook, which there falleth into the Sea, and from the Mouth of the said Brook ascendeth unto the farthest Spring or Head thereof; from thence pas∣sing towards the South for six Miles together along the Borders of the said <HI>John Guy</HI>'s Plantation, and there crossing over Westward in a right Line, reacheth unto the Bay of <HI>Placentia,</HI> and the space of one League within the said Bay from the Shore thereof; whence turning again towards the South, passeth along the Harbour of <HI>Placentia,</HI> with the like distance from the Shore, and descending unto <HI>New Falkland</HI> towards the North and West part thereof, stretcheth it self in a right Line East∣ward, continuing the whole Southerly length upon the Bounds of the said <HI>New Falkland,</HI> unto the middle part or Point of the Promontory, or Neck of Land be∣fore mention'd, between the Ports <HI>Fermose</HI> and <HI>Aquafort;</HI> at which place is describ'd and finish'd the Perambulation of the whole Precinct, whose Extent may be thus computed, commencing from the Promontory between the Ports <HI>Fermose</HI> and <HI>Aqua∣fort,</HI> which is fifty or sixty Miles from South to North distant from <HI>Petit Harbour;</HI> from whence crossing Westward to the Bay of <HI>Placentia,</HI> is judg'd to be sixty Miles more or upwards, from East to West.</P>
<P>And thereby was also granted to the said Sir <HI>George Calvert</HI> and his Heirs, all Islands and Islets, within ten Leagues of the Eastern Shore of the said Region to∣wards the East, together with the Fishing of all sorts of Fish, saving unto the <HI>English</HI> free liberty of Fishing, as well in the Seas as in the Ports and Creeks of the Province aforesaid, and the Priviledges of salting and drying their Fish upon the Shores of the said Province, as heretofore they reasonably us'd and enjoy'd the same, so as they do no injury or notable loss or detriment unto the Lord Proprietary, his Heirs and Assigns, or to the Inhabitants of the said Province, in the Ports, Creeks, and Shores aforesaid, and especially in the Woods growing within the said Province.</P>
<P>And by the said Patent all Royal Jurisdictions and Prerogatives, both Military and Civil, within the said Province and Islands thereunto belonging, were farther granted to the said Sir <HI>George Calvert</HI> and his Heirs, and he and they thereby created the true and absolute Lords and Proprietaries of the said Province, saving the Al∣legiance due to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, to be held of them in <HI>Capite,</HI> yielding and paying unto them therefore a white Horse, when, and as often as any of them shall come into the said Province, and the fifth part of all Gold and Silver Oar which should be found there.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George Calvert,</HI> before the obtaining of this Patent, had caus'd a fair House and Fort to be built in the said Province, at a place call'd <HI>Ferryland,</HI> and in the Year 1624. having obtain'd a Dismission from his Employment of Secretary of State, and being then created Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI> of <HI>Baltemore</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he did in the Year 1627. Transport himself to <HI>Avalon,</HI> to inspect his Concerns there in Person; from
<PB N="309" REF="197"/>whence returning the same year, he Embarqu'd himself again, together with his Lady and all his Family, except his eldest Son, for <HI>Avalon</HI> the year following; at which time (there being then War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI>) he redeem'd above twenty Sail of <HI>English</HI> Ships, which had been taken there that year by <HI>French</HI> Men of War, whereof one Monsieur <HI>De la Rade</HI> had the chief Command, and shortly after took six <HI>French</HI> Fishing Ships upon that Coast, and sent them the same year, with a great many <HI>French</HI>-men Prisoners, into <HI>England.</HI> Coming thence, he left a Deputy there, and continu'd the Plantation till his Death, which was in <HI>April</HI> 1632. After whose Decease it descended of right to his Son and Heir <HI>Cecil,</HI> now Lord <HI>Baltemore;</HI> who thereupon sent one Captain <HI>William Hill</HI> as his Deputy thither, to take possession thereof, and to manage his Interest there for him. Captain <HI>Hill,</HI> according to his Commission, shortly after repair'd thither, and liv'd some years at the Lord <HI>Bal∣temore</HI>'s House at <HI>Ferryland</HI> above mention'd.</P>
<P>In the thirteenth Year of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. about the Year of our Lord 1638. Marquess <HI>Hamilton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> Sir <HI>David Kirk,</HI> and others, under pretence that the Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI> had deserted that Plantation, obtain'd a Patent of all <HI>New-found Land,</HI> wherein <HI>Avalon</HI> was included, and shortly after dis∣possess'd the Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI> of his Mansion House in <HI>Ferryland,</HI> and other Rights there, and during the late Rebellion in <HI>England</HI> kept possession; but His now Ma∣jesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, immediately after his most happy Restauration in the Year 1660, upon the now Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI>'s Petition, thought fit to refer the whole Matter to be Examin'd by Sir <HI>Orlando Bridgeman,</HI> then Lord-Chief Justice, now Lord-Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> and others, to report the true state thereof to His Majesty, together with their Opinions thereupon: The Referrees accordingly, upon full hearing of Council on both sides, certifi'd; That they con∣ceiv'd the said Patent to Sir <HI>George Calvert,</HI> to be a good Patent, in force, and not avoided by the later to Sir <HI>David Kirk</HI> and others; and that the Title and Interest to the said Province did therefore belong to the Lord <HI>Baltemore.</HI> Whereupon His Majesty, on the twentieth of <HI>March</HI> in the same Year, Order'd the Possession thereof to be re-deliver'd to his Lordship, which was accordingly executed: Since which time his Lordship has peaceably enjoy'd the possession thereof, and continues the Plantation to this day, by deputing Lieutenants there from time to time, for the better Government of that Province, the rest of <HI>New found Land</HI> remaining still to the aforesaid Proprietors, claiming by the Patent of 13 <HI>Car.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>The Commodities that are either by Art or Nature produc'd there, are the same with those of the remainder of <HI>New-found Land.</HI> The Winter there is extream cold, the Summer very hot, but withal pleasant; and during that Season there is great plenty of Pasture for Cattel.</P>
<P>The Coast of this Province is very safe, and as well furnish'd with variety of bold and pleasant Harbors, as any other part of <HI>New-found Land;</HI> where the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> likewise Fish for Cod, the lesser sort whereof is call'd <HI>Poor-John,</HI> which is there caught in great abundance, especially at <HI>Ferryland,</HI> and in the <HI>Bay of Bulls.</HI> Besides these two there are divers other excellent Harbors on the Eastern Shore of <HI>Avalon,</HI> as <HI>Capling Bay, Cape Broyle, Brittus, Isle of Spears, Barrom Cove, Whitburns Bay,</HI> and <HI>Petit Harbour</HI> above mention'd. On the West are the Bay of <HI>Placentia,</HI> and several other good Harbors.</P>
<P>There are no <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Avalon,</HI> and but few <HI>English,</HI> by reason of the excessive Cold in Winter, though Sir <HI>David Kirk</HI> and his Lady, and also his Family, liv'd in the Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI>'s House at <HI>Ferryland</HI> for the space of ten years and upwards.</P>
<P>The Soil seems to promise great store of Mines, which probably may in time be
<PB N="310" REF="198"/>disover'd. The late Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI> took accidentally a piece of Oar up that lay there upon the surface of the Earth, and brought it with him into <HI>England,</HI> which was found upon trial to yield a greater proportion of Silver, than the Oar of <HI>Potosi</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> but hitherto no Mine of it hath been discover'd there.</P>
<P>The Trade of Fishing being of so great concernment to the Nation of <HI>England,</HI> the same (if it be well manag'd in this Island of <HI>Terra Nova</HI>) will employ every year above two hundred Sail of <HI>English</HI> Ships, and ten thousand Mariners, besides the great benefit which may accrue unto the Nation by Imposition upon Strangers there, which would amount to several thousands of Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI> with which those Coasts may be Guarded, and Ships Trading thither secur'd: besides the great Customs by the Ships call'd <HI>The Sacks</HI> (being commonly in great numbers every year) who carry Fish from <HI>New-found Land</HI> into the <HI>Straights, France, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and who bring their Returns into <HI>England,</HI> as Bullion, and all other native Commodities of those Countreys.</P>
<P>If the Island were well fortifi'd, we might Command all those of other Nations that come to Fish in <HI>New-found Land,</HI> to pay Contribution in Fish or otherwise, for their Priviledge to Fish there, the said Island being first Planted by <HI>English,</HI> and per∣taining to the Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> or if occasion should require, they might be utterly debarr'd of Fishing there.</P>
<P>The Trade of Fishing is of so great concernment to <HI>France, Spain, Portugal,</HI> the <HI>Straights,</HI> and other Parts, that they cannot well be without that yearly Supply in Fish which comes from that Island: Neither can the <HI>Hollanders, Spaniards,</HI> or <HI>Portuguese,</HI> well set any Ships to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> without <HI>New-found Land</HI> Fish, there being none that will endure to pass the Line sound and untainted, but the Fish of that Countrey, salted and dry'd there. And so long as the Act continues still in force, That no Fish be Transported from the said Island, but in <HI>English</HI> Bottoms, it will contribute very much to our encrease of Shipping there, and by consequence, of the employment of Mariners; and the Fishing of that part of the Island will be solely appropriated to the <HI>English</HI> Nation, to whom of right it belongs, which will prove the greatest Ballance of Trade in that part of the World; and that whereas above two hundred Sail do Trade thither yearly to Fish, if a thousand Sail come, if there be but Fisher-men enow, they may all have Fraughtage there.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> if once the Island be fortifi'd, will be depriv'd of their Nursery of Mariners, this being the onely place, besides <HI>Canada,</HI> and one or two adjacent Coasts, where they come for supply of Fish, with which that Nation cannot be furnish'd so well from other Parts.</P>
<P>By well Planting and Fortifying <HI>New-found Land,</HI> the Trading to <HI>Virginia, New England,</HI> and those Parts, would be much encourag'd, <HI>New England</HI> having had of late great Traffick with <HI>New-found Land,</HI> where they vend the Growth of their Plantation. Besides, <HI>New-found Land</HI> is a Key to the Gulf of <HI>Canada,</HI> which if the <HI>English</HI> had again in their possession, as they had in the Years 1628. and 1632. they might give a Law to all foreign Kings and People interested in any of the parts of <HI>America,</HI> and a Protection to all the <HI>English</HI> Plantations upon that Continent, where∣by great security, comfort and profit would arise to the Nation and People of it: whereas on the contrary, if the <HI>French, Spanish,</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> should possess themselves of the said Plantation, they would not onely deprive this Nation of all the Ad∣vantages aforesaid, but would also derive to themselves so great a Power to preju∣dice all the Plantations of the Coasts of <HI>America</HI> belonging to this Nation, that the Inconveniences thereof are scarce to be imagin'd or express'd.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The wonder∣ful Bank of <HI>Terra Nova.</HI></NOTE>Before this Island, right over against <HI>Cape Ray,</HI> at the distance of twenty four Leagues or more, there lieth an huge Bank or Ridge of Land, extending it self in length out of the Sea, above a hundred Leagues, but in breadth not above four or five and twenty, when it is broadest, and in other parts much less, sharpning to∣wards each end into a <HI>Conus,</HI> or narrow Point. It is accounted one of the Wonders of the Sea, which round about, at some distance, is very deep, and hardly to be sounded, especially betwixt the <HI>Bank</HI> (for so they commonly call it) and <HI>Cape Ray,</HI> but drawing nearer, it grows by degrees more and more shallow, insomuch that nigh the Land there is not much more Water than is necessary for the Ships to Ride in. It runneth out in length, as was said, from North to South, from forty one Degrees of Latitude to fifty two; and round about it there lie scatter'd a multitude of lesser Islands, which Sir <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> when he first discover'd the Place, call'd by one common Name <HI>Los Baccaloos,</HI> or <HI>The Islands of Cod-fish,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Baccaloos</HI></NOTE> from the great quan∣tity of that sort of Fish he there found; which was such, that they hindred the pas∣sage of his Ships, and lay in such multitudes upon the Coasts, that the very Bears would come and catch them in their Claws, and draw them to Land.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of <HI>Assumption.</HI></NOTE>IN the Gulf of <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> towards the Mouth of the River <HI>Canada,</HI> is another less considerable Island, said to have been first discover'd by <HI>Quartier,</HI> and by him call'd <HI>The Island of Assumption;</HI> by <HI>John Alphonso, The Island of Ascension;</HI> by the Natives, <HI>Natistcotec:</HI> It extends it self from the forty eighth to the fiftieth Degree, between the South-East and North-West.</P>

In which nevertheless the <HI>English</HI> were not so easily discourag'd; for first Captain <HI>Gosnol</HI> and <HI>Smith</HI> set forth, at the Charges of Mr. <HI>Edward Wingfield;</HI> next, Captain <HI>Nelson;</HI> then successively <HI>West, Gates, Argal,</HI> and <HI>Wyat,</HI> but all with little or no success, till at length in the Year 1612. a Company was establish'd in <HI>London</HI> by the King's Letters Patents, who sent one Mr. <HI>Richard Moor</HI> with sixty Men to the <HI>Bermudas,</HI> where he spent three years in fortifying those Islands: but that which put a little stop to this good beginning, was a kind of Misfortune that hapned; for the Rats which were gotten ashore from a Shipwrack increas'd so exceedingly, that they devour'd all the Plants in the Field, and the Provision in the Houses, insomuch that a great Famine proceeded from thence, all means to destroy the Vermine being in vain; till at last Providence sent a Disease amongst them, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ill'd them all in a very short time. Mean while <HI>Moor</HI> went on in the fortification of the Island, and was ere long supply'd with fresh People. Mr. <HI>Barlet</HI> was sent over with sixty Men, and carried from thence▪ with him eighty Pound of Ambergreece. And soon after three Ships more, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Blessing,</HI> the <HI>Star,</HI> and the <HI>Margaret,</HI> convey'd thither four hundred and ten, Men and Women. As soon as <HI>Moor</HI> was call'd away, <HI>Daniel Tuckard</HI> coming from <HI>Virginia</HI> to succeed him, bestirr'd himself very much, Planting all places full of Trees fetch'd from the <HI>West-Indian</HI> Islands; as also Tobacco, with which he fraighted a Ship to <HI>London.</HI> Moreover, the Countrey was divided into Acres, that every Planter might have an equal share, and know his own Lands. <HI>Anno</HI> 1619. <HI>Tuckard</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Nathaniel Butler,</HI> who in four Ships brought thither five hundred Men and Wo∣men, to supply the first Plantation, which was much decay'd since the Rats had devour'd their Provisions, so that it was little look'd after by the Company in <HI>Lon∣don:</HI> But now they built a Church and erected a Court of Judicature, and all things were order'd conveniently for the publick good. After which many Noble Persons set Sail thither in the <HI>Magazine</HI> Frigat; and the Planters being now fifteen hundred in number, inhabited twenty Leagues of Land in length.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Forts built upon the <HI>Ber∣mudas.</HI></NOTE>On the longest Island, call'd <HI>St. George,</HI> (for the <HI>Bermudas</HI> consists of several Islands, great and small) they built <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Dover</HI> Forts, with other Fortifica∣tions and Towers, which had their Denominations from those Noble-men and Gentlemen that were Undertakers in this Plantation, as <HI>Cavendish, Paget, Herbert,</HI> &amp;c. from the Earl of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> the Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and others.</P>

<P>All these Islands lying together resemble a Half-Moon, and are surrounded with Rocks, which appear at Low-water, and at High lie but shallow; for it seldom
<PB N="313" REF="201"/>Ebbs or Flows above five Foot. The Shore, for the most part Rocky, and hardned by the Sun and Wind, receives no damage by the Waves which continually beat against the same.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Soil.</NOTE>The Ground it self differs; for in some places it is sandy or clayie, and in others partly black, and partly white, or Ash-colour'd Earth; which last is ac∣counted the worst, and the black the best. Three Foot deep under the Ash-colour'd Earth lie great Slates, and under the black, a white spungie Stone, like the Pu∣mice, in whose moist Crevises Trees take root.</P>
<P>The Pits or Wells, though they Ebb and Flow with the Sea, yet produce a wholsom and sweet Water.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tempera∣ture of the Air.</NOTE>The Skie is generally serene, but when over-cast with Clouds, is subject to Light∣ning and Thunder; yet the Air is of a good temper, being neither exceeding cold, nor excessive hot: for which reason the <HI>European</HI> Fruits grow better there than in their natural Soil.</P>
<P>Their Harvest is twice a year; for that which they Sowe in <HI>March,</HI> is ripe and gather'd in <HI>June;</HI> then what they Sowe again in <HI>August,</HI> they gather in <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Productions of the Coun∣trey.</NOTE>These Islands breed no hurtful Creatures; nay, the yellow Spider which spins silken Cobwebs, is free from Poyson.</P>
<P>The Plant <HI>Nuchtly,</HI> which bears speckled Pears, grows betwixt the Rocks which are drench'd with Sea-water.</P>
<P>The Hogs which above a hundred and fifty years since swam ashore out of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Wrack, are exceedingly increas'd there, but because of their poorness are scarce eatable, they feeding onely on the sweet Berries which fall from the <HI>Palmito</HI>-Trees.</P>
<P>About the white and red Mulberries, which grow plentifully there, breed thousands of Silk-worms, which spin Silk according to the colour of the Mul∣berries.</P>
<P>The Sea produces some quantity of Pearls and Ambergreece.</P>
<P>From the beginning of the year till <HI>May,</HI> the Whales are seen to swim not far from the Shore.</P>
<P>A strange sort of Sea-Fowl breed in Holes like Rabbets; and amongst other Birds, here are also store of Cranes.</P>
<P>The Tobacco which the <HI>English</HI> have planted here grows very well.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tortoises Laying of Eggs.</NOTE>Here are likewise great Tortoises, which Lay their Eggs in the Sand on the Shore, where they are Hatch'd by the Beams of the Sun, and are taken after this manner: In the Night some are set to watch where they Land, and whilest they are digging a deep Hole in the Ground, are thrown on their Backs, and not being able to get upon their Legs again, they lie and groan very pitifully: some of them having above two Basons full of Eggs in their Bellies; which being about the big∣ness of a Tennis-Ball, have a thin Shell, which incloseth a Yolk and White. If these Eggs lie buried six years, then the young Tortoises breaking the Shell, come out of the Sand, and instantly creep into the Sea. Their Flesh is not onely wholsom but toothsom. The Oyl made of them is not inferior to Butter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cedars of an excellent kind.</NOTE>Moreover, the <HI>Bermudas</HI> produce Cedars, the like of which are not to be found in the whole World: The Leaves are douny and prickly at the ends, almost like those of the Juniper Tree: The Wood hath a sweet smell, and the Berries, which are like the Myrtle, of a pale Red, inclose four white Kernels; the outermost Skin where∣of is sweet; the innermost, which covers the Kernel, sharp, and the Pulp tartish: The Trees are always flourishing, being at the same time full of Blossoms, green, and ripe Fruit: The Berries, when grown ripe, begin to gape, and fall off in rainy
<PB N="314" REF="202"/>Weather, leaving a round Stalk on the Boughs, which loses not its Rind till two years after; half which time the Berry requires, before it attains to its perfect ripe∣ness, which generally happens in the Winter: The Boughs shoot straight upwards, and become in time so heavy, that they cause the Body of the Tree to bend. This most excellent Wood grows in divers places of the <HI>Bermudas.</HI></P>
<P>We shall conclude with the resolute Exploit of five Sea-men, <HI>Anno</HI> 1616. who, to the great admiration of all People, set Sail from thence in an open Vessel of three Tun through the main Ocean, and after having suffer'd terrible Tempests, arriv'd in the space of seven Weeks safe in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>These Islands are remarkable for divers sorts of Plants, unknown in other Parts, as the <HI>Prickle Pear, Poyson Weed, Red Weed, Purging Bean, Costive Tree, Red Pepper,</HI> and the <HI>Sea Feather.</HI> Also several strange Birds, as the <HI>Egg Bird, Cahow, Tropick Bird,</HI> and the <HI>Pemlico,</HI> which presageth Storms.</P>

St. Nicholas</HI> to the North, and <HI>Cabo de Donna Maria</HI> towards the South. It is not thought to be less than a hundred and fifty Leagues in length, and in breadth from threescore to thirty, and to contain in the compass of the whole, four hundred Leagues at least, lying be∣twixt eighteen and twenty Degrees of Northern Latitude, having an Air somewhat infested with the Morning Heats, but well cool'd again in the Afternoon, by a con∣stant Wind from the Sea, which they call there <HI>Virason.</HI> It is, for the fertility of the Soil, one of the richest and most flourishing Countreys in the World; the Trees and all things else there continually clad, as it were, in their Summer Livery, the Meadows and Pastures always green, and of such an excellent Herbage, that Cattel both breed and thrive there beyond belief; both great Cattel and small, as Kine, Sheep, Hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> brought thither out of <HI>Spain,</HI> having multiply'd to such numbers, that they live wild now in Herds in several places, and are both hunted and kill'd, like Stags or other Venison, onely for their Hides, which they send yearly into <HI>Spain</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> as a great Merchandize and Commodity of huge profit to them.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fish <HI>Ma∣nate.</HI></NOTE>No less wonderful is the Fish <HI>Manate,</HI> whose shape hath been describ'd else∣where: It breeds for the most part in the Sea, yet sometimes swimming up the Rivers, comes ashore and eats Grass.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the City of <HI>St. Domingo.</HI></NOTE>This City, the Metropolis of all the Isles round about, was built by <HI>Bartholomeus Columbus,</HI> and was peopled <HI>Anno</HI> 1494. after which it flourish'd eight years, when, a terrible Storm blowing the same down to the Ground, <HI>Nicholas Olanda</HI> remov'd it to the Western Shore of <HI>Ozama,</HI> that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had for the most part set∣led towards the West, might not be necessitated to Ferry over: but the first place stood much more conveniently, being not onely provided of a Fountain of sweet Water, but also freed of those unwholsom Vapours which daily rise with the Sun at this new-built City. To prevent the inconvenience of crossing to the fore∣mention'd Fountain, of which the Inhabitants found themselves oftentimes in great want, <HI>Olanda</HI> went about to lead the neighboring River <HI>Hayna</HI> into the <HI>Ozama,</HI> but the Design not being prosecuted, bereav'd <HI>Domingo</HI> of the onely thing which would have made it able to stand in competition with any City in the World; for it lies on a Plain, the South side whereof is wash'd by the Sea; the East side, by the River; on the North and West are many delightful Fields.</P>
<P>The City, which in a manner is built square, is divided into long straight Streets, full of fair Houses after the <HI>Spanish</HI> manner: in the middle thereof is a square Market-place, with a handsom Church, the Yard whereof is encompass'd with a high Wall, which upon occasion would serve for a place of great Defence.</P>
<P>The Collectors of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Revenue dwell in stately Palaces; and the <HI>Dominicans, Franciscans,</HI> and Monks <HI>De la Merced,</HI> have brave Cloysters, besides two more for the Nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>

<P>The City is surrounded with a Stone Wall, and fortifi'd with a Castle, which with two Bulwarks reaches to the River <HI>Ozama,</HI> and within them two Half-Moons.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island dispeopled by the cruelty of the <HI>Spani∣ards.</HI></NOTE>All those Cities are much decay'd, and thinly inhabited, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being most of them drawn by the temptation of new discover'd Gold and Silver Mines in other places, and the first Inhabitants having been miserably destroy'd. The Bi∣shop <HI>De las Casas,</HI> an Eye-witness, relates, That the King <HI>Gauccanarillo</HI> secur'd the Goods of a stranded Ship, of which Columbus was Commander, and receiv'd the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> very courteously; but not being able to continue supplying them with that quantity of Gold they requir'd, wanting Men to gather so much out of the Streams and Mines, and seeing no way to rid himself from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Oppressions, fled to the Province of <HI>Ciguayos,</HI> the <HI>Casique</HI> of which was his Deputy; whereat the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> were so enrag'd, that they burnt all that they could meet with, neither spa∣ring young nor old; and at length taking <HI>Guaccanarillo,</HI> put him in Irons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their barba∣rous usage of <HI>Guaccanarillo</HI> and others.</NOTE> and thought to have carried him to <HI>Madrid;</HI> but the Ship in which he went suffering Shipwrack, he with many others was cast away, being before almost dead with grief for his Consort, who had been Ravish'd by a <HI>Spanish</HI> Commander. Likewise <HI>Anacoana,</HI> Sister to the <HI>Casique,</HI> or Governor of the Province <HI>Xarana,</HI> and Partner with him in the Government, seeing three hundred of her Councellors burning in a great House, set on fire by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and her Subjects torn by Dogs, or cut in pieces, hung her self out of despair. The same Death died <HI>Higuanama,</HI> Queen of <HI>Huguey.</HI> Others say that <HI>Anacoana</HI> was put to death together with her Brother in a most barbarous and cruel manner, by <HI>Nicholas de Olanda,</HI> who succeeded <HI>Diego de Arana</HI> in the Government of this Island. Many Women and Children were kept alive onely to Manure the Ground. The Men dying of their hard Labour in the Gold-Mines, and those which endur'd stoutly the cruel Labour under Ground, were never suffer'd to go to their Wives; from whence proceeded a great decrease of People, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> seeming purposely to design the destruction of the Na∣tives of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> though they receiv'd great benefit by their Service; for Gold in former times was found between the Cracks and split Stones of the Mountains, whose Veins the Mine-workers digg'd for not without great and dangerous La∣bour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First original of the Peo∣ple of <HI>Hispa∣niola.</HI></NOTE>The first Planters of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> are, according to the common opinion, deriv'd from <HI>Matinio,</HI> a high and Mountainous Isle, from whence the most eminent Inhabi∣tants were driven by certain Rebels, as formerly the <HI>Syrians</HI> under the Government of <HI>Dido,</HI> were driven from <HI>Tyre</HI> to <HI>Lybia,</HI> and the <HI>Batavians</HI> from <HI>Hessen</HI> to the Coun∣trey between <HI>Rhyne</HI> and <HI>Wall,</HI> at present inhabited by the <HI>Gelders</HI> and <HI>Hollanders.</HI> These <HI>Matininoensians</HI> thus expell'd from their native Countrey, setled themselves on <HI>Cahonao,</HI> near the River <HI>Bahaboni:</HI> The first House they call'd <HI>Camoteia,</HI> and after∣wards turn'd it into a Temple, to which they shew'd Reverence, and made great Presents: In like manner the <HI>Tyema,</HI> which stood on a high Rock belonging to one
<PB N="320" REF="207"/>of the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands, was by the antient Inhabitants of the Place had in great vene∣ration, insomuch that many leap'd down from the same, being perswaded by the Priests, That the Souls of those which threw themselves off this sacred Break-neck, should immediately be translated into a place of everlasting happiness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The antient Name of this Island.</NOTE>This Island was, as we said before, first call'd <HI>Haity,</HI> which signifies <HI>Wild,</HI> be∣cause in many places it swells with wondrous high Mountains, and in other places is over-grown with great Woods: it was afterwards by the antient Inhabitants nam'd <HI>Xusqueia,</HI> that is, <HI>Unmeasurably great,</HI> because they suppos'd it to be the whole World, and that the Sun shin'd in no other place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Indian</HI> Songs or Ballads call'd <HI>Areitos.</HI></NOTE>The Natives of this Island, though wholly rude of acquir'd Knowledge or Lite∣rature, like the generality of the <HI>Americans,</HI> yet they took care to instruct their Chil∣dren in the Original and Antiquities of their Countrey, and the Wars and Exploits of their Predecessors, both which they contain'd in Songs call'd <HI>Areitos,</HI> which they us'd to Sing to the sound of Drums and Trumpets; but especially their Persons of chiefest Quality study'd most these <HI>Areitos,</HI> and exercis'd themselves in Dancing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Pre∣diction of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Arrival.</NOTE>The most remarkable of these antient <HI>Areitos,</HI> were such as pretended to pro∣phesie of things to come, which if of sad consequence, were Sung very mournfully and with many Sighs; nor were they always, however inspir'd, without effect, as appear'd at last by woful event: for long before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Landed on <HI>Hispani∣ola,</HI> it was foretold by one of them, that <HI>Maguacochios,</HI> signifying <HI>Clothed People,</HI> should Land on <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> who with sharp Weapons should cut off Heads and Arms, and under whose insupportable Yoke their Successors must spend their days without hope of ever being releas'd.</P>
<P>It might be disputed whether these Predictions were dictated by good or evil Spirits; but it is generally believ'd, that all their Oracles, whether hapning true or false, were suggested by diabolical Spirits to the Priests, who commonly convers'd with them; and that these Spirits knew the Design of several People to discover new Countreys.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Images of their <HI>Zemes.</HI></NOTE>Their Images <HI>Zemes,</HI> stuff'd full of Cotton, were fashion'd into very frightful Shapes, and might pass for those things which we call <HI>Terricula,</HI> or <HI>Bugbears;</HI> of which some were made very small, and those they ty'd on their Foreheads when they went to the Wars. Every Governor had a peculiar <HI>Zemes,</HI> to whom he shew'd Reverence, in return whereof he expected Rain, fair Weather, and to conquer his Enemies, supposing him to be a Messenger of a perpetual and endless Being, by them call'd <HI>Jocauna Guamaonocon;</HI> whom nevertheless they suppos'd to have a Mo∣ther, to whom they gave five Names, <HI>viz. Attbeir, Mamona, Guacarapita, Liella,</HI> and <HI>Guimazoa.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Islanders Opinion of the Creation.</NOTE>Their opinion of Man's Creation was thus: They say, that out from a Moun∣tain in the Province <HI>Cuanana,</HI> out of certain small and great Caverns therein, came little and great People: The biggest Hole, call'd <HI>Cazibaragua,</HI> and the little one, nam'd <HI>Amaiauna,</HI> were said to be lock'd up every Night, that none might pass the Sentinel <HI>Machchael,</HI> who out of curiosity leaving the Mountain <HI>Cuata,</HI> and going up into the Countrey, was discover'd by the Sun, whose Beams he not being able to endure, was turn'd into a Rock. The like Mischance hapned to many others, who in the dark Night going to Fish, in the Morning at their Return were chang'd in∣to Oaken Trees, onely one of the Fishermen Was sent away by the chief Comman∣der <HI>Vaguoniana,</HI> who moved at the Complaint of a Nightingale's Singing, suffer'd all the Men to go into the Hole, and the Women and Children he Transported to <HI>Matinino,</HI> But to make short of these non-sensical Stories, in conclusion, the Men being let out of their Caves, saw many strange Beasts amongst the Woods, which
<PB N="321" REF="207"/>being turn'd into Women, Were entertain'd by them, and brought forth a nume∣rous Progeny, which spread over all <HI>Hispaniola.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their foolish Opinion of the Original of the Sea.</NOTE>No less ridiculous an Account do the Priests give concerning the Original of the Sea, <HI>Viz.</HI> That <HI>Jaia,</HI> a mighty Man, buried the Body of his deceased Son in a Pumpion, which some Moneths after, out of meer affection to the Deceased, he cut∣ting open, abundance of Whales sprung out of it. This Wonder being every where known, amongst others, entic'd four Brothers born at one Birth (whose Mother died in Childbed) to get the Pumpion into their possession; which their Design prov'd successful: but afterwards struck with a pannick fear of <HI>Jaia</HI>'s coming thi∣thither (who oftentimes came to mourn over the Bones of his dead Son) they fled, and threw away the Pumpion, which breaking with the fall, the Sea gush'd out of all places thereof, and cover'd the Plains in such a manner, that nothing of them was seen, onely the tops of the highest Mountains appear'd; at which the four Brothers terribly afrighted, rang'd through barren Desarts, in which they had died of Hunger, had they not come to a Baker's House, which one of them entring, ask'd for <HI>Cazabi;</HI> but the Baker denying them Bread, spit on them, which caus'd a mortal Dropsie, which the Brothers upon consultation found no way to cure, but by cutting a hole in the Skin with a sharp Stone, and to let out the Water; but out of each running Wound sprung a Woman, who bare them four Sons and four Daughters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cave <HI>Jovana∣beina.</HI></NOTE>There is a certain Cave call'd <HI>Jovana-beina,</HI> which is adorn'd with a thousand Pictures, in great esteem amongst them; at the Entrance on each side whereof stands a <HI>Zemes;</HI> that on the right side is call'd <HI>Binthaitelles,</HI> the other <HI>Marobur,</HI> to which they come from all places to pay their Devotions, because (they say) the Sun and Moon came out of the said Cave to lighten the World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their absurd Opinion of the Deceased</NOTE>Much after the same absurd rate is their Opinion of the Deceased; for they sup∣pose that they range through Woods and Forrests in the Night, eat of a Fruit call'd <HI>Guannaba,</HI> and steal to the Embraces of Women in Moon-shiny Nights. A Tra∣veller, say they, if he be frighted at the appearance of a deceased Person, great in∣conveniences will certainly attend him, but if he goes stoutly towards it, then the Goblin vanishes.</P>
<P>These Delusions are made great Mysteries amongst them, and contain'd in Songs, which their Priests <HI>Boiti</HI> Sing to a kind of Tabor made of a piece of hollow Wood, pretending that they have familiar Conversation with the <HI>Zemes</HI> concern∣ing future things.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cere∣monies about their Sick.</NOTE>Their Ceremonies about their sick, especially if Persons of Quality, are like∣wise very remarkably odd and conceited: First they chew a strong kind of Herb, call'd <HI>Cohobba,</HI> with which having sufficiently intoxicated their Brains, they foam at the Mouth, and run with a Stone and a piece of Flesh in their Mouths to the sick Person, whose Family they drive all out of Doors, except one or two, whose pre∣sence the Patient requires; then the <HI>Boiti</HI> walks four times about the sick Person's Bed, making strange Gestures, pinching his Lips and Nose, blowing upon his Forehead, Throat and Temples, and sucking several parts of his Body, alledging, that thereby he draws the Distemper out of the Veins; after that he chafes and rubs his Shoulders, Thighs and Legs, and ties his Hands and Feet together, then running to the Door, proclaims, That the Sick in a short time shall be restor'd to his former Health; which said, he returns with his Arms stretch'd out towards the sick Person, takes the piece of Flesh out of his Mouth, which he gives him backwards, saying, <HI>You shall rise and go forth in Health, for I have taken away your Sickness:</HI> But if he judges the Distemper not curable, he makes the Sick believe, that <HI>Zemes</HI> is
<PB N="322" REF="208"/>displeas'd with him, because he did not build a House for him, or consecrate a Garden to him, or in some respect or other did not worship him as he ought to have done. When the Soul departs out of the Body, they conjure the Body with many Adjurations, to reveal whether it died according to God's decree, or through neglect of the <HI>Boiti,</HI> as not having sanctifi'd himself enough by Fasting when he went first to the Sick, or not prescrib'd sufficient Medicines: wherefore if (as they say) the Devil answers them from the Mouth of the Deceased, that the <HI>Boiti</HI> did not perform his due Office, then the nearest Friends revenge themselves on the <HI>Boiti,</HI> but if otherwise, then they are highly esteem'd amongst them. The Women ta∣king the Stones which the <HI>Boiti</HI> kept in his Mouth, wrap them up in a fine Cloth as a holy Relique, supposing that they will much facilitate their Child-birth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Con∣sulting with their <HI>Zemes.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Casiques</HI> desirous to know future Events of War, or whether the approach∣ing Years will be fruitful, go into a Chappel consecrated to the <HI>Zemes,</HI> and snuff the intoxicating Herb <HI>Cohobba</HI> up their Nostrils; whereupon they break out into loud Exclamations, and some kind of strange extravagant Actions, till the power of the <HI>Cohobba</HI> begins to decay, and the Frenzie cease; then coming again to their Sen∣ses, they bow their Heads, and lay their Elbows on their Knees, in which posture they sit for a considerable time, then lifting up their Eyes they yawn as if they they came from sleep; then they mutter to themselves whilest their Retinue which stand about them (for no common Person is suffer'd to be there) thank them with a loud Voice, for the pains they have been at in discoursing with the <HI>Zemes;</HI> then the <HI>Casiques</HI> begin to declare what hath been reveal'd to them, <HI>viz.</HI> whether they shall be fortunate in the Wars or not; whether it will be a fruitful or unfruitful, healthy or sickly Year.</P>
<P>Moreover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gossipping.</NOTE> at the Birth of the <HI>Casique</HI>'s Children, the neighboring Governors visit the Women in Child-bed, and every one gives the Child a peculiar Name, from whence it happens that one Man hath oftentimes forty Names, and is highly in∣cens'd if any one of them chances to be forgot in any Writing directed to him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Succession.</NOTE>Their manner of Succession in Government is not unremarkable; for not the eldest Heir-male of the Family, but first the King or <HI>Casique</HI>'s Brother, if he have any, and after his Decease the eldest of the Sisters Inherits the Realm or <HI>Seigniorie:</HI> if the Sisters have no Male-issue, then the Brothers Sons Inherit; and in case they have no Male-heir, then the next of Blood, whether Male or Female: but if the Prince or <HI>Casique</HI> dies without Children, Nephews, or other near Relations, the next in Power in the Countrey Inherits, and Marries as many Wives as he pleases; of which she that he loves best is burn'd alive in her best Apparel with her Husband when he dies, and near the Corps stands a Cup of Water and some of the Bread <HI>Cazabi.</HI></P>

In the Year of our Lord 1580. about the end of <HI>February</HI> setting Sail from <HI>St. Christophers</HI> for <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> by the Way they met with a small Frigat bound for <HI>San Domingo,</HI> and the Men of her being Examin'd, one assur'd them that the Haven of it was a barr'd Haven, and the Shore well fortifi'd, so that there was no convenient Landing within ten <HI>English</HI> Miles of the City, whither this Man undertook to conduct them. <HI>January</HI> the first they Landed ten Miles from the City, and marching thither under the Command of the Lieute∣nant General, arriv'd about one a Clock in the Afternoon; when they came near, about a hundred and fifty Gentlemen well Mounted, presented themselves against them; but the small Shot playing upon them, they departed, and the <HI>English</HI> pro∣ceeded towards the two Gates of the City that lay towards the Sea, both which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had Mann'd, and planted their Ordnance without the Gates, and some small Shot in an Ambush by the Way-side: The <HI>English</HI> being about twelve hun∣dred Men, divided themselves; the Lieutenant-General leading the one half to one Gate, and Captain <HI>Powel</HI> the other half to the other Gate, vowing that with God's assistance they would not rest till they met in the Market-place: No sooner had the <HI>Spaniards</HI> discharg'd their Ordnance, doing some little Execution, but the Lieute∣nant-General hasted, or rather ran upon them, to prevent their Charging again, and notwithstanding their Ambush, entred Pell Mell with them into the Gate, not staying till he came into the Market-place, unto whom shortly after came Captain <HI>Powel</HI> with his Companies. This Place they strengthned with Barricado's, the City being too large to be guarded by so small and weary an Army. And after Mid-night they in the Castle, hearing some of the <HI>English</HI> busie about the Gate, quitted it, some being taken Prisoners, and others escaping by Boats. The next day the English enlarg'd their Quarters, and fortifi'd themselves, and held the Town for a Moneths space. During this time the General sent a <HI>Negro</HI> Boy with a Flag of Truce to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who by the Way was met by some Officers of the Galley which the <HI>English</HI> had taken, together with the City, who furiously thrust the poor Boy through the Body; who returning to the General, and having declar'd how barbarously they had us'd him, fell down and died in his Presence. The General being much mov'd herewith, commanded the Provost-Martial to take two Fryers, and to carry them to the same place with a sufficient Guard, and there to hang them; and withal he sent one of the Prisoners to inform the <HI>Spaniards</HI> why he did it, and to tell them, that till the Party who had thus murder'd his Messenger were deliver'd to him, there should no day pass wherein he would not hang two Priso∣ners, till all were consum'd. Hereupon the day following the Murtherer was brought, and an Offer made to deliver him to the General, who yet thought it more honorable to make them perform the Execution themselves in the sight of the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> which was done accordingly.</P>

<P>During their abode here, Commissioners oft pass'd between the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and them about the Ransom of the City, but not agreeing, the <HI>English</HI> spent every Morning till the heat of the Day in firing and destroying the Houses in the out∣ward part of the City, two hundred Mariners being employ'd therein for divers days; yet were the Houses built so magnificently and strongly of Stone, that they could not consume one third part of the Town all that time; whereupon the Ge∣neral was contented to accept of twenty five thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> of 5 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> apiece to spare the rest.</P>
<P>Here his Soldiers met with good Pillage, especially of rich Apparel, but Trea∣sure they found none; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by their Cruelties had so destroy'd the Na∣tives, who us'd to work in the Mines of Gold and Silver, that they were wholly given over; and in that Island they were forc'd to use Copper Money: yet they found store of Wine, Oyl, Vinegar, Wheat, Woollen and Linnen Cloth, some Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which much reliev'd them: there was but little Plate found, but good store of <HI>Porcelane,</HI> or <HI>China</HI> Dishes; yet some they found, and very costly Hous∣hold-stuff.</P>

This Army being sent to <HI>Portsmouth</HI> for Embarquation, and there making such Preparations as was convenient, which a Moneths time or thereabouts was thought would ac∣complish, a Messenger came from <HI>Desborough</HI> (who was there to set them going) to the General, that he should prepare to Embarque on <HI>Christmas</HI>-day; which at the first the General receiv'd with great impatience, alledging, That it was not possi∣ble so to do, and that he would not set Sail without his Arms and other Necessaries, which were not yet come from <HI>London:</HI> however, at his going to <HI>Desborough</HI> he was
<PB N="325" REF="209"/>prevail'd upon to set Sail, with a promise that the Ships with the Arms should immediately follow him to the <HI>Barbado's,</HI> where he was to stay till their arrival; so on <HI>Christmas</HI>-day they set Sail, and about the fourteenth of <HI>February</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Bar∣bado's</HI> with three thousand Men, and a Company of Reformado's, which there were doubled, and then, and not till then, it was told them, That the reason of their so sudden going away, was because there was a Plot forming in <HI>England</HI> for resto∣ring the King, and that they were not thought fit to be left there at the Head of their Regiments, to be tempted with the advantage of joyning with any such Party. At <HI>Barbado's</HI> they staid till they had almost undone that Place by eating up their Pro∣visions, the Planters there seldom preparing more than they have occasion to spend in their Houses, and for their Servants (having better and more profitable Employ∣ments upon their Hands) and the Soldiers not being content with such Provisions as their Servants would be well pleas'd with, so that they were in danger of star∣ving the Island and themselves too: Thereupon a Council of War was call'd, and the necessity of leaving that Island declar'd, and Orders issu'd out to set Sail for <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where they might make such Attempt as their Condition would allow, wanting Arms and other Necessaries; when they came within five or six Leagues of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> the Fleet lay by, and a Council of War was call'd by the Commissio∣ners (for such they had who were never Soldiers) with some few Officers of the Army, where it was resolv'd to attempt San Domingo, and an Order made, That in case it be taken, no Soldier should offer to Plunder, but that satisfaction in lieu thereof should be given by the Commissioners; the Officers of the Army in vain opposing and protesting against it, which occasion'd the Soldiers to say, That the Commissioners should take the Town themselves, for they would not; Lots were there drawn by the several Colonels who should first Land, which fell upon the Black Regiment, who had no Arms but Half-pikes of eight Foot long, made of Cabbage-Tree in the <HI>Barbado's;</HI> And Orders were then given out to the several Colonels to Land at the River <HI>Hind,</HI> within two Leagues of <HI>San Domingo;</HI> so they steer'd their Course thither, as was thought, by Night, but the next Morning found themselves twenty Leagues at least from the place of Rendezvouz, though one Re∣giment Landed there, who durst not attempt the Town for want of Orders, though doubtless they might have taken it, had they not staid in expectation of the General and the rest of the Fleet; but when they were thus cast Leeward of the Town, they must Land their Men, who no sooner went on Shore, but the Order against Plundering was read, and the Soldiers in a Mutiny to whom it was read, which made the rest forbear to read it, judging it no time now to disoblige them, who had in their Officers opinion too just a cause of discontent: However this was made known to the rest, and discours'd as they march'd, That they had not thought to be under a Committee here, but they would make them weary of their Em∣ployment ere they had done: And this indeed was enough, besides the faintness and unusual Heat of the Countrey, to disanimate Men of good Resolutions, espe∣cially the ordinary Soldiers, whose hopes of Plunder is the chiefest prop to their Courage, and exected Gain the spurr to their Valour. After they had Landed their Men, next Morning early they march'd towards <HI>San Domingo;</HI> but before Noon the Heat and Drought which they felt made them sensible of their first Errour and Inadvertency, in coming from <HI>England</HI> without their Necessaries; for through want of Bottles, which were left behind, and came not till three Moneths afterwards, the Men fell down dead in the High-ways, every one fainting and languishing, and crying out for Water: shortly after they met with a Field of Oranges, which was no unwelcome sight, with which they stor'd themselves; but ere they had march'd
<PB N="326" REF="210"/>four or five Miles thought they had quench'd their present Thirst, and their Drought began to increase however, they march'd on, leaving some of their Men dead on the place, others fainting, were set upon the Troopers Horses till they came that Night to some Water, which gave them new life, and the Morrow early march'd again till they came within some Miles of the appointed Rendez∣vouz, where they heard of the other Regiment that Landed at the right place: And now having refresh'd themselves with Rest, Water, and Provision, they march'd to the taking of the Town; the General himself, with a small Party and a Guide, went towards the Town to find out some Water, which he knew the Soldiers would want, (not having Bottles to carry any) but as they were on their March, which was very leisurely by reason of the Heat, they heard a firing of Musquets, then making more speed in their March, supposing an Engagement, in the High∣way, about a Mile from the Town, was found one of the General's, Secretaries, with others, dead; and not long after some came back to the General, and told him, That looking for Water with the Guide, an Ambuscade issu'd out, and had kill'd the Guide that should have shew'd them the place of Water, and some others; and although some which Commanded the foremost Regiments were very forward and willing to assault the Town, yet it was not thought fit so to do till the Army came up, by which time it was Night; and though they were then within half a Mile of the Town, yet the Soldiers were so impatient for Water, that they could not stay till the next Morning to assault the Town, but were forc'd to march back to the River <HI>Hind</HI> about eight Miles; (and this Relater did at that time drink his own Water) there they staid till they had again refresh'd themselves, and then prepar'd for their Return to attaque the Town; and notwithstanding the March it self in a hot Countrey was irksom enough, yet they were forc'd to make the Soldiers to draw the Ordnance and other Carriages for want of Harness and other Necessaries, which were left behind; however, they willingly underwent it by Turns: And now a Forlorn was drawn out, and other Orders given for a March, especially it being taken notice of, that the Enemies manner of Fight was and would be by Am∣buscades, a File in every Company were order'd to stand till the other came up, and to face to the Right and Left to the Woods, which were all along as they went, for fear of a Surprize; and the Forlorn marching near an old Fort, call'd <HI>Jeronymo,</HI> which we had been possess'd of before, but thought not worth the keeping, and fearing they might meet with some small opposition there, began to fortifie them∣selves, and took a Dram of the Bottle, which as they were drinking, and others eating a bit, suddenly rush'd forth an Ambush of about a hundred and twenty <HI>Blacks,</HI> with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Commander in the Head of them, which so amaz'd and <HI>sur∣priz'd</HI> them, that some few onely Discharging, the rest immediately fled; the <HI>Blacks</HI> quickly falling in with their Lances, and doing such Execution as the time would allow them; for presently the Alarm being taken, and Supplies marching out for their relief, the Enemy, who had done more than they could possibly expect to have done, retreated into their Fort, which they had better fortifi'd than before, and had planted some small Drakes there upon it; the Execution was so short, that they had not time either to strip or pick a Pocket, lest they had paid too dear for it. After this Defeat a Council of War was call'd, and there it was agreed the next Morning early to fall on upon that little Fort, and so proceed to the taking of the Town; but very early, as they were in that expectation, Orders came from the General to the Army to march back to the River <HI>Hind,</HI> for what reason this Relator (though a considerable Person) never yet knew; where after they had staid some time, that Miscarriage was question'd at a Council of War, and one of the chief

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies of the old Natives.</NOTE>Many were the Idolatrous Ceremonies of the old Natives of this Place, which would be too tedious to relate; but amongst the rest, they annually kept a great Feast, at which the <HI>Casiques</HI> summon'd all their Subjects to a Temple appointed for that purpose, where the Priests had prepar'd an Idol ready set forth in all its Pa∣geantry; near which the <HI>Casique</HI> plac'd himself, when upon the beating of a Drum all the Commonalty came also into the Temple; the Men painted with divers Co∣lours, having on their Heads Plumes of Feathers, about their Necks, Legs, and Arms, Strings of Sea-shells. The Married Women had a light Covering about
<PB N="331" REF="214"/>their Middle, but the Maids went stark naked, all of them Dancing and Singing Songs in praise of the Idol; after which having saluted the <HI>Casique,</HI> they thrust little Sticks down their Throats, so to bring up all they had upon their Stomachs; which done, and sitting down with their Legs under them, they began to Sing anew, often bowing and shewing Reverence to the <HI>Casique;</HI> whilest some Women carried Baskets of Bread amongst those that Sang, and utter'd certain Prayers, which were answer'd by some of the Men; the Bread being bless'd by the Priests, they gave every one a piece, with which they return'd home very merry and jocund.</P>
<P>But the God of this Island, whoever he was, hath been a long time left without Worshippers; for those that were left by the Invading Cannibals, were cruelly massacred by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> insomuch that they have been thereby necessi∣tated to furnish themselves with <HI>Negro's</HI> to work in their Mines and Sugar-Mills; and these also not able to endure such hard Entertainment, ran most of them away; for when a <HI>Negro</HI> did not bring Gold enough home at Night, his Master tying him naked to a Stake or Post, and beat him with Rods or Switches so long, till the Blood ran down his Back, then pour'd boyling Oyl into the Wounds, and then threw Pepper and Salt into them, and so let him lie, or else put him into a Pit, out of which his Head appear'd onely.

<P>There are a sort of four-footed Serpents, by the Natives call'd <HI>Yguanas,</HI> of which they us'd to eat.</P>
<P>The Flesh of Tortoises or Turtles, was accounted a great Dainty amongst them, especially those of the biggest size, of which some have been known to weigh a hun∣dred and thirty Pound: The Feet of them are said to cure the Leprosie and Scabs.</P>

<PB N="334" REF="218"/>Promontory and a square Fort, that two Ships cannot Sail in together: the shal∣lowest part thereof hath six Fathom Water.

<P>Betwixt these two Forts is a Tower cover'd, on the top whereof is a round Lan∣tern, wherein stands continually a Watch-man, who puts forth as many Flags as he discovers Ships at Sea, to give notice thereof to the City, which is a Mile from thence.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Havana</HI> stands a third Castle, well stor'd with Guns, as likewise the rest are, in all to the number of two hundred and forty, and strongly Garrison'd; of which great care was taken by the General <HI>Jean de Texeda,</HI> and <HI>Baptista Antonelli,</HI> an Architect, sent thither by <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to secure the Place from all foreign Assaults, because the Plate-Fleet, and other Ships that come out of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> have their place of Rendezvouz here, and from hence set Sail altoge∣ther for <HI>Spain.</HI> The City stands along the Haven, and hath two Churches with spiry Steeples.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Havana</HI> se∣veral times Assaulted and taken.</NOTE>But <HI>Havana</HI> was not so strongly fortifi'd in former times, for <HI>Anno</HI> 1536. it could not resist a mean <HI>French</HI> Pyrate, who losing the rest of his Fleet was driven hither by Storm, and conquering <HI>Havana,</HI> had burnt the same, consisting at that time of woodden Houses cover'd with Thatch, had not the <HI>Spaniards</HI> redeem'd them from the Fire for seven hundred <HI>Ducats;</HI> with which Money the <HI>French</HI> set Sail, when the day following three Ships arriv'd from <HI>New Spain</HI> before <HI>Havana,</HI> and having unladed their Goods, and preparing themselves for Battel, pursu'd the Pyrate; whom getting sight of, the Admiral, who Sail'd before, durst not venture to Engage him alone, but staid for the other two Ships: from which cowardly Action the <HI>French</HI> Pyrate taking Courage, fell on the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admiral, who without firing a Gun ran his Ship ashore, and deserted the same: the next Ship thereby discou∣rag'd, Tacking about, made away from the Enemy; on which the third also fol∣low'd, insomuch that at last they were all three taken by the <HI>French;</HI> who encou∣rag'd with this unexpected Victory, steer'd their Course a second time to <HI>Havana,</HI> where they got as much more Money from the Inhabitants as before. After this the <HI>Spaniards</HI> built all their Houses of Stone, and a Fort at the Mouth of the Harbor, yet nevertheless the City lay open on the Land side; of which the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, Cruising about in those Seas, being inform'd, Landed not far from <HI>Havana,</HI> and en∣ter'd the City before Day-break: the <HI>Spaniards</HI> thus suddenly surpriz'd, fled into the Woods, whilest the <HI>English</HI> plunder'd and ransack'd the City without any resistance. But this was not the last Blow which <HI>Havana</HI> receiv'd, for during the Wars between the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, a Ship set Sail with ninety Soldiers from <HI>Diep</HI> to <HI>Cuba,</HI> where they made themselves Masters of <HI>St. Jago,</HI> and carried great Treasure away with them: Thus enrich'd, they set in the Night on <HI>Havana,</HI> but found their Expectations frustrated, for all the Houses were empty, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (being so often Plunder'd) having remov'd all their Goods to their Countrey Houses, which lay scattering about the Island. Whilest the <HI>French</HI> were searching the Houses, two <HI>Spaniards</HI> came under pretence of agree∣ing with them, but their Design was chiefly to take an Account of their Enemies Forces. The <HI>French</HI> demanded six thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> of them: to which the two <HI>Spaniards</HI> reply'd, That all their Goods would not raise so much: then going to their Party, inform'd them of the number of the Enemies, and their Demands; whereupon Consulting, some judg'd it best to comply with a forc'd Necessity, and
<PB N="335" REF="218"/>if they could not get any thing abated, to pay the demanded Sum: but most of them were of another opinion, alledging, That the number of the <HI>French</HI> was not equivalent to their Demands, and that it would not be for their Credit, to yield up their Estates so tamely, without trying their Title by the Sword: This being judg'd fittest, they march'd to Engage them with a hundred and fifty Men, which about Midnight fell on the <HI>French,</HI> and at the first Onset slew four of them; but up∣on the firing of the Gun they were all alarm'd, and after a small Skirmish, put the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to flight. The Conquerors enrag'd at this treacherous Plot of the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> set fire on <HI>Havana,</HI> in which at that time was a good quantity of Pitch and Tarr; with which the Gates, Windows, Roofs, and Pent-houses being all bedaub'd over, were in few hours all in a light Flame; after which the Churches in order for their firing, were also going to be over-laid with the same combustible Matter; at which a <HI>Spaniard</HI> boldly desir'd, that the Temples erected for Gods Service might be spar'd: to which he was answer'd, That People who keep not their Promise, nor had any Faith, had no need of Churches to profess their Faith in.

<P>This large Island <HI>Cuba</HI> (as we have before observ'd) formerly divided into so many populous Territories, is now in a manner desolate; for according to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Relation to the Admiral <HI>Henry Jacobson Lucifer,</HI> when he was before <HI>Ha∣vana, Cuba</HI> had upon it not above sixty thousand Persons in all, in <HI>Anno</HI> 1627.

<P>Before we conclude the Description of <HI>Cuba,</HI> it will be material to add some Passages of a Letter from Major <HI>Smith,</HI> Governor of the Isle of <HI>Providence,</HI> who was taken there in the Year 1665. which will give light to the knowledge of the pre∣sent State, not onely of <HI>Cuba,</HI> but of some other parts of <HI>America,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> which is as followeth:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Maj. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Letter con∣cerning <HI>Cuba</HI> and other Parts.</NOTE><HI>CUba</HI> is a very good Island, and in it is generally the best Land, for so large a Countrey, as I have seen in <HI>America,</HI> although I have travell'd the main Conti∣nent in several places, and have cross'd from the North Sea to the South Sea, as also the North side of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and most parts of <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>This great Island is easie to be conquer'd, and would make the best Plantation, besides the prejudice it would be to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the great advantage to our Nation; for instance, Had we the Port and City of <HI>Havana,</HI> which might in all probability be reduc'd with two Regiments of good Soldiers from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> carry∣ing with them two or three Sloops or Shallops for Landing Men, fitted with good Arms and other Necessaries for an Assault, presently after their Armado hath pass'd out of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which is once in two years, towards the latter part of the Summer. There is good Landing on the West side of the City, where it lies open; and you need fear no Ambuscado's: but not on the East side on the Harbor, for there you will be gawl'd by the strong Castle of the <HI>Moare,</HI> until the City be secur'd; but when that is once taken, you may easily reduce that Castle also, there being no danger of their re-taking it, until the next Armado arrives there, which will be al∣most two years, against which time you will have Planters enough from other of our Islands, to Manure the Land, and assist the Soldiers in defence thereof: This once effected, would utterly ruine the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for these Reasons: Our Ships lying both here and at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> would be at all times ready to gather up their stragling Fleet, which it is difficult to keep imbodied without the help of that Port of <HI>Ha∣vana,</HI> it being impossible for their great unruly Ships to turn up to Windward from the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or <HI>Puerto Bello,</HI> without separation; and on the other side, to pass the Gulf of <HI>Florida,</HI> is for them as impossible, where they always Rendezvouz, Victual, Water, and provide all things necessary for their Return into <HI>Spain;</HI> after all which they diligently wait for a convenient Season of Winds and Weather (be∣ing much observ'd from the Changes of the Moon) when to pass that dangerous <HI>Straight:</HI> for to say truly, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are neither very fit for Sea nor Land-Service, excepting some Officers and Soldiers bred in <HI>Flanders</HI> for Land-Service, and a few <HI>Biscainers</HI> for Sea-Affairs. They are so sensible of their Weakness, and jealous of their Riches in those Parts, that it is very difficult for any ingenious Man to get his Liberty, being once taken, fearing he might give such Intelligence, as to be thereby the cause of their ruine, witness their blind-folding of all Strangers, when they pass their Cities and Castles; for they much dread an old Prophecy amongst them, <HI>viz. That within a short time the</HI> English <HI>will as freely walk the Streets of</HI> Havana, <HI>as the</HI> Spa∣niards <HI>now do;</HI> which indeed had been easily perform'd with a third part of the <HI>English</HI> Army sent to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and a far geater advantage to the Nation: for I esteem that Port and Harbor of <HI>Havana</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> equivalent (against that Nation) to <HI>Tangier</HI> in the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> and if we were at once Masters of both, it would without doubt so straiten the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as absolutely to admit us a free Trade into their Ports of <HI>America,</HI> where they impart our Commodities, and sell them for ten times more than they first cost in <HI>Spain,</HI> by reason of the great plenty of Silver: which Trade would not onely be of infinite advantage to us, but also prevent them of their future enslaving of our Nation in Chains as now they do;

<P>I have seen other parts of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> might be fleec'd of considerable quantities of Riches, as at <HI>Panama,</HI> where their Silver Bars lie pyl'd up in Heaps in the open Streets Day and Night without Guard for five or six Moneths together, waiting the arrival of the Armado; which when arriv'd in <HI>Puerto Bello,</HI> they Transport it thither with so slender a Guard, for so great a Treasure, as would be an easie Prey to a thousand resolv'd Men (although of extraordinary value for so small a Charge;) but here is no resting, nor long remaining, they being so numerous (as in all other places of the main Land) though of great Wealth, and easily gotten with a Catch and away: But to my purpose,</P>
<P>This Island of <HI>Cuba</HI> hath adjacent to it great Conveniences of Salt and Fishing; and in it are very great plenty of Horses, Neat, Sheep, and Hogs, both wild and tame, of a far larger and better breed than any other parts of <HI>America:</HI> It hath also many very rich Mines of Copper already open, and is the onely Place that sup∣plies all the <HI>West-Indies</HI> with Metal for the infinite number of Ordnance they have in all their Ports and Castles, both in the North and South Seas; but whether it hath any Mines of Silver or Gold, I know not; but if there were any such, they would not adventure their opening and discovery, fearing the Invasion of that Island, whereunto is so easie access by Sea, and of so great import to their whole Interest in <HI>America:</HI> for which reason also they refuse to work any Mines in <HI>Flo∣rida,</HI> that are nigh the North Sea, (although they have there very many) but do ra∣ther employ themselves about others farther up in the Countrey, although with greater Labor and Cost, for conveyance of the Product by Land to <HI>Mexico.</HI> And lastly, (for its full praise) this Island hath many very good Ports and Harbors of great advantage to Ships, for safe passing the Gulf; and should the <HI>Spaniards</HI> keep three or four Frigats always plying between the Western end of <HI>Cuba</HI> and that of <HI>Havana,</HI> off and on, it were impossible for any Ships of ours that came from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to escape them; the Scales turn'd would be their Case to all <HI>America.</HI> Neither wants it great Sugar-works, which have Water-mills and Horse-mills, and very many large <HI>Cocoa</HI> Walks, the most and best Tobacco: and in short, it produceth all other Commodities, that any of our <HI>American</HI> Islands have knowledge of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Jamaica.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Extent of <HI>Jamaica.</HI></NOTE>THe Island of <HI>Jamaica</HI> lieth North from the Southern Continent of <HI>America,</HI> in the Sea call'd <HI>Mare del Nort;</HI> and South from the Isle of <HI>Cuba</HI> about twelve Leagues; and West from <HI>Hispaniola</HI> twenty, in eighteen Degrees of Northern Latitude; and beareth from <HI>Rio de Hacha</HI> North-West, a hundred and fifty Leagues; from <HI>Santa Martha</HI> North North-West, a hundred and thirty five; from <HI>Rio Grande</HI> North-West, a hundred and thirty; from <HI>Carthagena</HI> North, four∣teen; from <HI>Porto Bello</HI> North-East and by North, a hundred and ninety; from the Bay of <HI>Darien,</HI> North and by East, a hundred and seventy; from the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> a hundred and fifty. It is of Form something nearly resembling oval, being in length from East to West, about fifty four Leagues, or a hundred and seventy Miles;
<PB N="338" REF="222"/>from North to South in the broadest and middlemost part, about three and twenty Leagues, or seventy Miles over, and so groweth narrower and narrower towards each Extream; in circumference about one hundred and fifty Leagues, or four hundred and fifty <HI>English</HI> Miles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Countrey.</NOTE>This Island is well water'd with Springs and Rivers, and is all over, especially in the Western parts, full of high Hills and Mountains: It is also well Wooded; for the North and South parts chiefly abound with tall and large Woods: Nor are there wanting every where <HI>Savanas,</HI> or Pastures, which are thought to have been Fields of <HI>Indian Maiz,</HI> till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> arriving here, brought in Horses, Cows, Hogs, and <HI>Asinego's</HI> to feed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperature of the Air.</NOTE>The Air in this Place is more temperate, and the Heat more tolerable, than in any of the rest of the <HI>Barloventi,</HI> by reason of the cool Breezes which constantly blow from the East, and the frequency of Showers of Rain, and refreshing Dews which fall in the Night.</P>
<P>This is also the onely Island of the <HI>Barloventi,</HI> which is not subject to violent Storms and Hurricanes; and the Diseases which are predominant here, are onely bred by Intemperance, as Surfets, Feavers, and Agues, or occasion'd by ill Diet or Slothfulness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodities of the Island.</NOTE>The Commodities of this Island are very many; and first for Vegetables, the Sugars are so good, that they now out-sell those of <HI>Barbado's</HI> 5 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cocoa,</HI> of which there are many large Walks; and greater plenty by improve∣ment may easily be produc'd.</P>
<P>Tobacco, so good, that the Merchants give Six pence a Pound for it, and buy it faster than the Planters can make it.</P>
<P>Indigo is producible in great abundance, if there were Hands sufficient em∣ploy'd about it.</P>
<P>The Cotton of this Place is accounted very firm and substantial, and preferr'd before any that grows in the neighboring Islands.</P>
<P>Of Tortoise-shell there is also good store, by reason that much of that sort of Tortoise is taken on this Coast.</P>
<P>Here are also great variety of Dye-woods, as <HI>Brasiletto, Fustwick,</HI> Red-wood, a kind of Log-wood, and several others, besides divers of those that are accounted the most curious and rich sorts of Woods, as Cedar, <HI>Mohogeney, Lignum-vitae,</HI> Ebony, <HI>Granadilla,</HI> and others, which are frequently Exported.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are very probable testimonies, that there are Mines of Copper here, since both there have been those who affirm to have seen the Oar wrought out of one of them, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> report the Bells that hang in the great Church, to have been Cast out of this Island Copper. As for Silver, the <HI>English</HI> are said to have been shew'd a Silver-Mine behind the Mountains, West of <HI>Cagway.</HI></P>
<P>Ambergreece the <HI>Spaniards</HI> report to have been often found on this Coast.</P>
<P>Salt might be made here in great abundance, there being three good Salt-pans; and Salt-petre hath been found in many Parts.</P>
<P>Ginger is reported to grow better here than in most of the <HI>Caribbee</HI> Islands; and Cod-pepper very plentifully; and also a certain kind of Spice call'd <HI>Piemete,</HI> being in the form of <HI>East-India</HI> Pepper, of a very aromatical and curious taste, partaking as it were of divers species together: it grows wild in the Mountains, and is very highly valu'd amongst the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Of Drugs and medicinal Plants there is here a very great abundance, as <HI>Guaia∣cum, China</HI>-Root, <HI>Cassia-Fistula, Veuillard, Achiotes, Tamarinds, Contrayerva, Ciperas, Adi∣antum Nigrum, Aloes, Cucumis Agrestis, Sumach, Acacia, Misselto,</HI> with several others, both Drugs, Balsoms and Gums.</P>
<PB N="339" REF="222"/>
<P><HI>Cochinele</HI> is produc'd by a Plant that grows in this Countrey, but it is not made without much care and curiosity, and the <HI>English</HI> are not yet well experienc'd in the Husbanding thereof, besides that the Growth of the Plant is much obstructed by Easterly Winds.</P>
<P>There is here greater store of Cattel than in any of the rest of the <HI>English</HI> Plan∣tations in <HI>America,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> as Horses, which by reason of the great number of them, are bought very cheap.</P>
<P>Cow's, of a large size, and of which vast numbers are yearly kill'd.</P>
<P><HI>Asinego's</HI> and Mules, both wild and tame, being a very serviceable sort of Cattel in those Countreys.</P>
<P>Sheep, large and tall, and whose Flesh is counted exceeding good, but the Fleece worth little.</P>
<P>Goats in great abundance, being a sort of Cattel very peculiar to that Countrey.</P>
<P>But of all other Cattel, Hogs are here in the greatest plenty, both wild in the Mountains, and tame in the Plantations; and they are more in request for Food than any of the rest, their Flesh being counted both of a better rellish, and more ea∣sily digestible than the Hogs-flesh of our Parts.</P>
<P>The Fish that is very plentifully caught in these Coasts is of infinite variety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fish.</NOTE> and quite of another kind from what we have in this part of the World, the principal whereof is the Tortoise, which is taken in great abundance both on these Coasts, and in the Islands <HI>Camavas.</HI></P>
<P>The tame Fowl in this Place, are chiefly Hens, Turkies, and Ducks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE> but of wild Fowl infinite store, as of <HI>Guinee</HI> Hens, <HI>Flamingo's,</HI> Teal, Ducks, Wigeon, Geese, Pigeons, Snipes, Plovers, Parrots, Turtles, Parachites, Machaw's, with divers others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit-Trees and other Plants.</NOTE>Choice and excellent sorts of Fruits are here in great abundance, as <HI>Cocao</HI>-Nuts, <HI>Mannes, Maumees, Supatas, Suppotillias, Avocatas, Cashuds,</HI> Prickle-Apples, Prickle-Pears, Sower-Sops, <HI>Custud</HI>-Apples, and many others.</P>
<P>For Timber-Trees, <HI>Platanes</HI> and Pines.</P>
<P>And for Garden-Herbs, Radish, Lettice, Parsley, Cucumbers, Melons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The antient Inhabitants us'd two sorts of Bread, the one made of stamp'd Roots, and the other of Corn, which is Reap'd thrice every year, and grows with such success, that one Pint sow'n yields two hundred.</P>
<P>They had a strange way to make their <HI>Cazari</HI> Cakes of the Root <HI>Juca,</HI> which keep good a year: They first press'd out the Juice with great Weights, which if drunk raw, occasions sudden Death; but boyl'd, is pallatable and good.</P>
<P>Potato's are here in great abundance, and grow like Artichokes in a moist Soil, and shoot forth Leaves of a dark-green Colour, like Spinage; they spread upon the Earth by Stalks, and bear a Flower like a Bell, at the end of which grows the Seed: the Roots are generally White, but sometimes Red, Marble-colour'd, Yel∣low, and Violet; they are not onely pleasing to the Pallat, but accounted very wholsom when stew'd in a close cover'd Pot, with a little Water.</P>
<P>But much daintier are the <HI>Ananas,</HI> which grow on a Stalk of a Foot long, sur∣rounded with sixteen large sharp Leaves, between which grows a Fruit like a Pine-Apple, but much bigger, with an uneven Rind, of a pale Green, and inclining to a Carnation on a yellow Ground; on the top shoots out a red Bunch of Leaves and Flowers; the innermost Pulp melts on the Tongue, and is of so delicious a taste, that it exceeds all other Dainties; the Seed produces Fruit once.</P>
<P>Of this Fruit there are several sorts, the chief whereof is accounted a special Re∣medy against a bad Stomach, Gravel, Poyson, and Melancholy.</P>
<PB N="340" REF="223"/>
<P>The Drink made of <HI>Ananas</HI> is no way inferior to <HI>Malvasia</HI> Wine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A sort of sensitive Plant.</NOTE>Here you may observe a remarkable Secret of Nature in a certain ever-green Plant, which grows either on the Bodies of old Trees, on the Rocks, or in the Woods; the Stalk whereof surrounded with Leaves, full of dark red Spots, bears a sweet-smelling Violet-colour'd Flower, the Leaves whereof as soon as touch'd, close up together and die, and according as they are held in the Hand a shorter or longer time, this strange alteration continues.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> planted Ginger on <HI>Jamaica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ginger.</NOTE> it hath grown there in great abun∣dance; the Male Plant (for it is divided into Male and Female) hath generally bigger Leaves than the Female; the Stalks, which are without Knots, have more Leaves upwards than downwards, and spreads along the Earth, still take Root anew; when the Leaves wither, then the Ginger is commonly ripe, but it hath not that poinancy whilest green as when dry'd.</P>
<P>The Cotton of this Island (of which the Clothes and Hammocks that are made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cotton.</NOTE> are vended in most parts of the Western World) grows on a Tree of equal heighth with a Peach-Tree, with a straight Stem or Body, out of which shoot Boughs of an equal length, and at equal distance; between the Leaves, which are narrow and long, grow red Flowers, and from them, oval Gods, which when ripe, inclose the Cotton, and a Seed like Pepper.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Alli∣gator.</HI></NOTE>Of hurtful Creatures here, besides the <HI>Manchonele,</HI> and a sort of Snakes call'd <HI>Guaana's,</HI> wherein 'tis thought there is little or nothing of a poysonous quality; the most observable is the <HI>Alligator,</HI> with which many Rivers and Ponds abound; it is a very voracious Creature, but is seldom known to prey upon a Man; it moves swiftly and strongly forward, but turns slow; the biggest of them are about twenty Foot long, their Backs scaly and impenetrable, so that they are hardly kill'd but in the Belly or Eye; they have four Feet or Fins, with which they go or swim indif∣ferently; are observ'd to make no kind of noise; their usual course for getting their Prey, is to lie on their Backs as dead, then with a sudden onset to surprize what-ever Fowl or Beast comes fearlesly near them; the best caution other Crea∣tures have of them is from the strong smell that flows from their Bodies: to re∣quite the harm done by them, they have something of vertue, for the Fat or Oyl of their Bodies hath been experienc'd to be an admirable Ointment for all kinds of Pains and Aches; they Lay Eggs no bigger than a Turkies by the Water side, still covering them with Sand, which heated by the Sun-beams, hatcheth the young ones, who naturally creep into the Water.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Muschilli <HI>and</HI> Merrywings.</NOTE>In some parts of the Countrey there are also a sort of stinging Flies, call'd <HI>Mus∣chilli</HI> and <HI>Merrywings,</HI> but the <HI>English</HI> Quarters are little infested by them.</P>
<P><HI>Hugh Linschot</HI> writes, That the antient Natives of this Place were a subtile and sharp-witted People, skilful in Handicrafts, and expert in warlike Affairs, above all the <HI>Americans</HI> besides.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First Disco∣very of the Island.</NOTE>The Island was discover'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Columbus,</HI> who first built there the Town of <HI>Mellilla;</HI> which disliking, he remov'd again to <HI>Oristana;</HI> and finding that an incommodious and unhealthy Situation, he remov'd again to another Plantation, where he built a very fair Town, first call'd <HI>Sevilla,</HI> afterwards <HI>St. Jago de la Vega,</HI> consisting of about seventeen hundred Houses, two Churches, two Chappels, and an Abbey, being the chief, if not the onely Seat of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be∣fore the arrival of the <HI>English,</HI> for their <HI>Estanchas,</HI> or small Plantations, were com∣mitted wholly to the custody of their Slaves.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempts of the <HI>English</HI> upon this Island.</NOTE>The first and onely Attempters upon this Island since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made them∣selves Masters thereof, have been the <HI>English,</HI> who in the Year 1592. under the Con∣duct of Sir <HI>Anthony Shirley</HI> Landed upon it, &amp; got clear possession thereof, none of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were then upon the Place daring to make the least resistance; but not thinking it worth the keeping, they soon deserted it, and made Sail back again for <HI>England:</HI> after which they remain'd unmolested for a long time, till in the Year 1654. a Fleet of <HI>English</HI> was set out for <HI>Hispaniola</HI> by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> under the Command of Colonel <HI>Venables,</HI> with a Design for the taking of <HI>St. Domingo;</HI> but meeting with ill success in the Enterprize, and being forc'd to quit that Island with loss of Men, and frustration of their hopes, they steer'd their Course for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and on the tenth of <HI>May</HI> in the Year abovesaid, with little opposition possess'd themselves of it. Upon their approach to <HI>St. Jago</HI> the Inhabitants thereof deserted it, and betook them to the Mountains, gaining time by a pretence of Treaty, to secure their Wo∣men and Goods; and oftentimes making Incursions upon the stragling Parties of the <HI>English,</HI> slew and took many Prisoners by surprize: but being weary of this wild and irregular kind of living, they betake themselves at last to the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where many of them, the Grandees especially, were permitted by favour to con∣tinue, the rest being by the Vice-Roy commanded back, with promise of speedy and considerable Supplies; by that time this remnant of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was near tir'd out with hardship and necessity, some being very much discourag'd and driven to utter despondence of Mind, others destroy'd out-right, part of the long promis'd and expected Supply arrives, the greatest part being to follow soon after; but

There are besides a number of small Isles scatter'd up and down, which are generally comprehended in the number of the <HI>Lucaies;</HI> one is <HI>Little Island,</HI> encom∣pass'd with a company of Shelves call'd the <HI>Bimini,</HI> so that it is hardly accessible: there goes a Tradition, that it hath been inhabited by very beautiful Women, the fame of whom drew many to attempt to Land there and take up their Habitation; in which Attempt many were cast away: There is said to be a Fountain in the midst of it, of such a Vertue, that whosoever drank of the Waters of it, had their Youth renew'd. Also three Islands, or rather Rocks, call'd <HI>Los Martyres,</HI> lying to the South-East of <HI>Cape Florida,</HI> and cover'd for the most part with a whitish Sand and a few Bushes growing on them: they seem at a distance to bear a resemblance of Men, impal'd, or bound to Stakes, as the Martyrs in the primitive Times usu∣ally were, which occasion'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> so to Name them; 'tis very dangerous to come too near them, but to have sight of them is of great use to Men at Sea; for by passing these Rocks, and leaving them on the South-East, they certainly know, that they are now entred the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Bahama,</HI> that is, that they have left the Ocean, and are fall'n in amongst those many Islands, which do, as it were, Barracado and Block up the Eastern Coasts of <HI>America,</HI> towards <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> as they call it, through which the Continent is sometimes dangerous, by reason of con∣trary Winds; and always such, that it requires the skill and care of an experienc'd Pilot to conduct the Ships well thither. The rest are <HI>Abacoa,</HI> twelve Leagues long; <HI>Yuma,</HI> twenty Leagues in length, and eight in breadth, between twenty four and
<PB N="345" REF="225"/>twenty five Degrees; <HI>Yumeata,</HI> fifteen Leagues in length, between twenty three and twenty four Degrees; <HI>Jamana,</HI> seven Leagues every way; <HI>Yabague,</HI> ten Leagues like∣wise, and lying between twenty two and twenty three Degrees; <HI>Magaguana,</HI> twenty Leagues long, and ten broad; <HI>Quagua,</HI> ten Leagues every way, and lying between twenty and one and twenty Degrees; <HI>Caycos,</HI> five Leagues in length, and in the one and twentieth Degree; <HI>Mackre,</HI> in the twentieth Degree, encompass'd with Shelves; <HI>Abreo,</HI> environ'd also with Shelves, and fifteen Leagues long; also <HI>Gua∣tao, Cigateo, Guanima, Jabaka, Triangulo,</HI> and several others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Lucales</HI> left desolate by the <HI>Spa∣niards.</HI></NOTE>On these Islands are no Inhabitants; those that did live there were a harmless simple People, and therefore the easier taken and carried away by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that have made them so desolate: Many of them seem of a good Mold, and the Lati∣tude promiseth much fertility. The Air is certainly good and wholsom, and not so extream hot as other Parts of that heighth. There is scarce any Beast on them, save a Coney that hath a Tail like a Rat, but Pigeons and other Birds in great numbers.</P>
<P>There is the Gum <HI>Benjoin,</HI> of the best and worst sort; <HI>Guaiacum, Sasaparilla,</HI> and <HI>Sassafras;</HI> and on some of them Red-wood and Ambergreece.</P>
<P>Our <HI>English</HI> Sea-men are little acquainted with these Islands, though they Sail round them yearly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>English</HI> Lan∣ding upon them.</NOTE>In the time of the Rebellion one Captain <HI>Sail</HI> and others, obtain'd a Patent, ma∣king thither on the Coast of an Island, which was call'd <HI>Illutheria;</HI> his Ship was wrackt, but the People recover'd the Shore with a few Necessaries.</P>
<P>The Coasts of most of them are dangerous, and bad to make, and that Ship that shall be near or amongst them, must keep the Lead always going; but with a wary Pilot, and care in giving the Islands a fair Birth, they are easily recover'd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. The Caribby Islands.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Names of the <HI>Caribbee</HI> Islands.</NOTE>THe <HI>Caribbee Islands,</HI> as they are generally call'd, are a Row or Ridge, as it were, of lesser Islands, which extend themselves almost in fashion of a Bowe, from the Coast of <HI>Paria</HI> as far as <HI>St. John de Porto Rico;</HI> they are otherwise call'd <HI>The Caraibes,</HI> sometimes <HI>The Camercanes,</HI> and by some <HI>The Islands of Cannibals,</HI> or <HI>Man-eaters,</HI> (though this Appellation cannot in reality be more appro∣priated to these Islands, than to many other, either Islands, or Parts of the Conti∣nent of <HI>America;</HI>) lastly, whereas all the Islands between <HI>Florida</HI> and <HI>New Spain,</HI> and <HI>Southern America,</HI> are by some comprehended all under the Name of <HI>The Antilles;</HI> yet the <HI>Caribbees</HI> and the <HI>Antilles</HI> are most generally, and, we conceive, most pro∣perly accounted the same; and they are so call'd, either as lying like a Bar before the greater Islands, or <HI>Quasi Ant-Isles,</HI> i. e. <HI>Opposites Isles;</HI> they lie all under the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> between the eleventh and nineteenth Degrees of Northern Latitude, and are twenty eight in number: but before we come to treat of each of them in particu∣lar, we shall take notice of the most observable of those things which are common to them all in general.</P>
<PB N="346" REF="226"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperature of the Air.</NOTE>The Air of all these Islands is of a good temperature and healthy, and the Heat not so excessive in them at any time of the year, as might be conjectur'd from their Situation under the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> by reason of a gentle East Wind, which rising in the Morning, continues most commonly till towards the Evening, allaying the scorch∣ing heat of the Sun, and refreshing the Air; but the Nights are commonly very cold; and it is observable, that by how much the hotter any Day hath been, so much the colder the Night following happens to be; whereof this reason is given; That the Vapors rais'd in the Day-time by the Sun, and falling down condens'd at Night, do very much cool the Air; but it is never so cold as to Freeze.</P>
<P>For half a year together Day and Night are equal in these Parts, and the rest of the Year the Day fourteen hours long, and the Night ten.</P>
<P>From <HI>April</HI> to <HI>December</HI> there commonly fall here great Rains, and all that Season is accounted Winter, and the Drought and Heat of the other Moneths is taken for Summer; but the Woods of these Parts looking ever green, make as it were con∣tinual Summer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Soil.</NOTE>The Soil is generally as fertile as in most places of <HI>Europe,</HI> and each Island fur∣nish'd with fair Rivers, Brooks, Lakes, Springs, Wells, and other Sources of fresh Water, besides in many places Mineral Waters, which are us'd with good success in the cure of several Diseases; also out of some Mountains store of Brimstone is digg'd, and it is conjectur'd that there are not wanting Mines of Gold and Silver, if they were well look'd after; and there hath been often found Crystal upon the Sands by Rivers sides.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vines grow∣ing naturally in the <HI>Carib∣bees.</HI></NOTE>The Vine, though wild, and naturally growing in the Woods, yet yields a very large fair Grape; and those which are cultivated in their Gardens or Vineyards, bear excellent Grapes twice a year, but very little Wine is made of them, in regard they find it will keep but very few days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wheat not apt to grow there.</NOTE>Wheat in the <HI>Caribbees</HI> grows up no farther than the Blade, and the reason is judg'd to be, because through the rankness of the Soil, and for want of Winter, this Grain springs up fast, and hath not substance enough left in the Root to supply it up to maturity; but no doubt but Barley, Rye, and those other Grains, to the ripe∣ning of which more Heat is requir'd, would thrive there very well.</P>
<P>Besides Lemmon-Trees, Orange-Trees, Citrons, and Pomegranates, and other Fruit-Trees growing in <HI>Europe,</HI> there are very many sorts of Trees, Herbs, Pulse, and other Plants, of a different kind from those amongst us, and peculiar for the most part to these Islands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit-Trees.</NOTE>Of Fruit-Trees, the most observable are the <HI>Goyavier,</HI> somewhat resembling the Laurel, onely having a softer Leaf, and of a brighter Green; its Fruit about the bigness of a Pearmain, but full of little Kernels like a Pomegranate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Papayer,</HI> which is of two kinds, one generally growing in all the Islands, the other proper to <HI>Santa Crux;</HI> the first hath a Leaf not much unlike that of the Fig-Tree, and the other bears a Fruit about the bigness of a Melon, which by the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> is call'd <HI>Mamao,</HI> from its resemblance of a Womans Breast: the Tree is hol∣low and spungy within, and grows up sometimes to the heighth of twenty Foot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Monick,</HI> call'd by the Islanders <HI>Corsot,</HI> from the Name of an Island from whence the Seeds were first brought by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and bearing a Fruit like a small Cucumber not perfectly ripe.</P>
<P>The <HI>Junipa,</HI> or <HI>Jenipa,</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Jenipapo;</HI> and by the <HI>Brasilians, Jeni∣paba;</HI> having Leaves like those of the Walnut-Tree, Flowers like the <HI>Narcissus,</HI> and a Fruit like a bak'd Apple, which when it falls from the Tree makes a noise like the Report of a Gun discharg'd, which is said to proceed from the bursting
<PB N="347" REF="226"/>forth of the Seed out of the thin Skin enclosing it, and breaking with a violence; the Juice, of it Dyes of a Violet-colour, and the Swine and Birds that feed upon it, are said to have their Flesh and Fat of the same colour.</P>
<P>A sort of Vine commonly call'd <HI>The Raisin-Tree,</HI> and by the <HI>Caribbeeans, Ouliem;</HI> whose Fruit being like a large Violet-colour'd Grape, hath in stead of the several small Grain-stones which are inclos'd in the Husks of common Grapes, one hard Stone, like that of a Plumb.</P>
<P>The <HI>Acajou,</HI> bearing for Fruit a kind of Chesnut, in form of a Hares Kidney, which serves for a Crest to a very fair Apple that by degrees grows under it, of which the Islanders make a Drink, very much in esteem amongst them, being of an excellent taste.</P>
<P>The <HI>Icaco,</HI> a kind of small Plumb-Tree, so much coveted, and held for a Deli∣cacy by some People that live near the Gulf of <HI>Hondures,</HI> that they are from thence call'd <HI>Icacos.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Monbain,</HI> which Fruit being a kind of yellowish Plumb, is chiefly made use of to mix in the Drinks of <HI>Ouicon</HI> and <HI>Maby,</HI> to make them taste the better.</P>
<P>The <HI>Courbury</HI> is by some reckon'd to be but a species of the <HI>Monbain,</HI> onely more full of Leaves, and growing higher and bigger; but the Fruit of the <HI>Courbury</HI> is suf∣ficiently different from that of the <HI>Monbain.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Fig-Tree, differing in Leaf from the common Fig-Tree, but whose Fruit both in figure and taste is not much unlike the Fig growing in these Parts: This Tree is commonly of such a vast Bulk, that the Branches of some of them have been seen to afford shelter to two hundred Men.</P>
<P>A kind of Service-Tree, differing from ours, by its exceeding heighth, fair Leaves, and pleasant Fruit.</P>
<P>The Prickly or Thorny Palm, so call'd from its being arm'd all over with Prickles, both Trunk and Leaves; by incision into its Branches a sort of Wine is made, and it is conjectur'd to be the same Tree which the <HI>Brasilians</HI> call <HI>Ayry.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Franc</HI>-Palm, an exceeding high and streight Tree, bearing on the top of its Trunk a whitish marrowy substance, by the <HI>French</HI> call'd <HI>Choude Palmiste,</HI> or <HI>Palm-Cabbage;</HI> for being boyl'd with the thin Leaves that incircle it, and well sea∣son'd, it is reckon'd amongst the Delicacies of the <HI>Caribbees.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Latanier,</HI> another kind of <HI>Palm;</HI> and <HI>Cocoa,</HI> which is also reckon'd amongst the se∣veral sorts of Palms; this last is a Fruit-Tree famous all over <HI>America,</HI> and hath been at large describ'd elsewhere.</P>
<P>There are also many other Trees fit for Dying, Joyners Work, and Building, (besides the <HI>Acajou</HI> before mention'd, of the single Trunks whereof are made those long Shallops call'd <HI>Pyrages,</HI> which are able to carry fifty Men) as</P>
<P>The <HI>Acomas,</HI> of the same bulk and heighth with the <HI>Acajon,</HI> and equally esteem'd by Joyners and Carpenters, and of the Fruit whereof the Woodquists grow fat at a certain time of the year.</P>
<P>The Rose-wood, to be rank'd amongst the chiefest of those Trees that are made use of by Work-men.</P>
<P><HI>Indian</HI> Wood, a very precious and useful Tree for several sorts of Materials, and of a very fine scent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iron-Wood,</HI> so call'd from its hardness, weight and solidity, above all that have hitherto been spoken of, and beyond either Cypress or Cedar for incorrupti∣bility.</P>
<P><HI>Brasile-Wood,</HI> so call'd as growing most plentifully in <HI>Brasile.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yellow-Wood,</HI> denominated from its Colour, and much esteem'd for its usefulness
<PB N="348" REF="227"/>in Dying green Ebony, easily taking the lustre of the true Ebony, and being very useful for the making of Cabinets and other curious Pieces of Work; It also Dyes of a very fair Grass-green.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roncon,</HI> by the <HI>Brasilians</HI> call'd <HI>Urnex,</HI> in the Husks, succeeding the Flowers whereof, which grow in little Bushes at the end of the Branches, is enclos'd a most rich Vermilion Dye, of a very soft and viscous Matter.</P>
<P>Here are also many other Trees, either useful in Medicine, or other ways ad∣vantageous, as the <HI>Cassia</HI>-Tree, of the bigness and figure of a Peach-Tree; the long Pipes or Cods whereof, containing the Medicinal Fruit, are well known amongst us by the Name of <HI>Cassia-Fistula,</HI> and to be had at every Apothecaries.</P>
<P>Medicinal Nuts, each Nut containing three or four Stones in so many Cells, every one of which is inclos'd within a thin white Pellicle, pleasant enough to the taste, and out of which is extracted an Oyl, us'd by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in several both Culina∣rie and Physical occasions.</P>
<P>The Cinamon-Tree, so noted for its aromatick Bark; also <HI>Sandal-Wood, Guaia∣cum,</HI> and <HI>Sassafras.</HI></P>
<P>Cotton-Tree and Soap-Tree, whose Uses the very Names imply, and which Trees have been touch'd upon elsewhere.</P>
<P>The arch'd <HI>Indian</HI> Fig-Tree, the Bodies of which Trees have been antiently the sculking Holes and Retreats of the Inhabitants from their Enemies; the Bark is useful for Tanners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gourd</HI>-Tree, of the bigness and heighth of a great Apple-Tree, and of which are made most of the Houshold Vessels and Utensils, which are in common use at present amongst the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahot</HI>-Tree, of the Bark of which are made Laces and Points.</P>
<P>The <HI>Manyoc,</HI> or <HI>Mandioque,</HI> of whose Root the <HI>Cassava</HI> Bread is made, and which growing in several places of <HI>America,</HI> hath been already taken notice of; as likewise the <HI>Banana</HI>-Tree, and that call'd <HI>The Apple-Tree of Paradice,</HI> otherwise <HI>Adam's Fig-Tree,</HI> the Fruit being reported to be of a very delicious taste.</P>
<P>Other Trees not known in <HI>Europe,</HI> are the <HI>Maposu,</HI> divers kinds of Thorny Wood, the Milky Tree, being of a venomous quality, the <HI>Mancenilier,</HI> and that whose Root beaten to Powder, and thrown into Rivers, intoxicates the Fish, with several others of less note.</P>
<P>Innumerable sorts of Shrubs might here in like manner be reckon'd up, but the chiefest are, That remarkable Plant, anciently known by the Name of <HI>Ricinus,</HI> and commended for its Vertues by <HI>Galen</HI> and <HI>Dioscorides.</HI></P>
<P>Coral-Wood, so call'd from its little Seeds, which being as red as any Coral, are us'd for Bracelets.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jasmin,</HI> bearing a Flower of an admirable sweet scent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Candle-Wood,</HI> so call'd from its combustibleness, by reason of an aromatick Gum which is within.</P>
<P>The Herbs, Flowers, Roots, and Pulse which grow here, are some of them com∣mon in all parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> as Cabbages, Onions, Chibols, Melons, all sorts of Millets, Cucumbers, Citruls, Parsnips, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Others, if not peculiar to this Island, yet growing chiefly there, and in some few parts of <HI>America</HI> besides, as the <HI>Raquettes,</HI> so call'd from the resemblance its Leaves have with a Racket, a thorny-spreading Bush, whose Fruit being of a Ver∣milion colour, makes the Urine of those that eat of it as red as Blood. Some liken this Plant to the <HI>Tunas,</HI> already describ'd, which yields that rich Scarlet Dye call'd <HI>Cochinele.</HI></P>
<PB N="349" REF="227"/>
<P>The <HI>Torch,</HI> so call'd by the <HI>European</HI> Inhabitants; by the Native Islanders, <HI>Akou∣lerou;</HI> a great Thistle, or thorny Bush, putting forth from the middle of it long streight Stalks like Torches, and bearing Fruit like a great Fig, not unpleasing to the taste.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lienes,</HI> creeping upon the Earth, and spreading up and down like Ropes, and bearing brown Husks of a Foot long, wherein are enclos'd a Fruit call'd <HI>Sea-Chestnuts,</HI> of which are made Boxes to keep Snush, Tobacco, or the like.</P>
<P>A sort of <HI>Sempervivum,</HI> which runs twisting upon Rocks, Trunks of old Trees, like Misseltoe, and sometimes on the Ground.</P>
<P>A sort of sensitive Plant, call'd by the Inhabitants <HI>Haestiel,</HI> or <HI>The Living Herb;</HI> of which kind of Plant something hath been already touch'd upon, and which be∣ing transplanted, is kept in several Gardens of the <HI>Curiosi</HI> as a Rarity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sweet-Rush,</HI> whose small Root dry'd, and reduc'd to Powder, helps Women in Travail.</P>
<P>The <HI>Balisier,</HI> whose Leaf apply'd, mollifies and cools inflammations of Wounds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dart-Herb,</HI> whose Root bruis'd and apply'd, draws away the Venom of empoyson'd Darts; besides <HI>Scolopendria,</HI> a sort of Aloes, several kinds of Maiden∣hair, and other medicinal Herbs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Granadilla,</HI> or <HI>Passion-Flower,</HI> growing in several other parts of <HI>America,</HI> and describ'd elsewhere.</P>
<P>There is also a sort of Pease in some of these Islands, differing from ours, and call'd <HI>The Pease of Angola,</HI> as first brought from thence. Likewise a sort of Beans call'd <HI>The Seven-years Beans,</HI> by reason the same Stalk bears seven years one after another.</P>
<P>The Herb call'd <HI>The Musk-Herb,</HI> from the dusky colour of its Flower, and the sweet scent of the Seed, grows also in these Parts very frequent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pyman,</HI> or <HI>American</HI> Pepper, is the same with that before describ'd under the Name of <HI>Axi.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Potatoe</HI> is a Root not unlike the <HI>Topinambous,</HI> or <HI>Jerusalem-Artichokes,</HI> other∣wise call'd <HI>Saligots,</HI> growing plentifully in our Gardens, but more wholsome, and of a better taste.</P>
<P>The <HI>Anana's,</HI> or <HI>Pine-Apple,</HI> accounted a most delicious Fruit, of an admirable sweet scent, and very pleasant to behold, grow not onely plentifully in these Islands, but in most places of <HI>America;</HI> besides the Sugar-Canes here, and in many other places, but not so generally.</P>
<P>The Plant from which is got the Dying Material call'd <HI>Indico,</HI> is very different from that which grows in <HI>Madagascar,</HI> which bears small odoriferous Flowers, of a white and purple Colour mix'd together.</P>
<P>Of these Trees, Herbs, and other Plants, which are produc'd in these <HI>Caribbee Islands,</HI> some are more peculiarly of the Growth of one Island, some of another; so that we shall have occasion to speak more largely of some of them, when we come to speak of each Island in particular.</P>
<P>The four-footed Beasts found in these Islands, are chiefly the <HI>Opassum,</HI> the <HI>Javaris,</HI> the <HI>Tatan,</HI> the <HI>Agouty,</HI> and the <HI>Musk-Rat,</HI> which being all of them no less known in other Parts of the <HI>New World,</HI> have been already taken notice of, and of which we may have also occasion to treat more at large in the particular Islands, we shall therefore onely name the other Animals, whether Birds, Reptiles, Insects, or Fishes, as partly having been heretofore treated of, and partly to be describ'd hereafter.</P>
<P>The Birds are, the <HI>Fregates, Fauves, Craw-fowl,</HI> or <HI>Grandgawsiers, Flammans, Swallows of America, Arras, Canides, Parrots, Parroquito's, Tremblo's, Sparrows of America, Eagles
<PB N="350" REF="228"/>of Orinoca, Manstenys, Colibrys,</HI> besides what are common amongst us, as <HI>Herons, Coots,</HI> or <HI>Moor-bens, Black-birds, Feldivars, Thrushes, Turtles, Woodquists, Pintado's,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Reptiles are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reptiles.</NOTE> <HI>Anotis, Zoquets,</HI> and <HI>Maboujats</HI> (of which farther mention will occur in the Isle of St. <HI>Christopher</HI>) <HI>Globe-mouches,</HI> nam'd by the <HI>Caribbeeans,</HI> Oulleouma, <HI>Scorpions,</HI> and several sorts of <HI>Lizards,</HI> call'd by the <HI>Caribbeeans,</HI> Ouamayaca; by the <HI>Brasilians,</HI> Senembi; and by other <HI>Indians,</HI> Jaquanas.</P>
<P>The Insects are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insects</NOTE> besides these common with us, as <HI>Glow-worms, Palmer-worms, Spi∣ders, Bees,</HI> &amp;c. the <HI>Cucuyos,</HI> mention'd in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and the <HI>Flying Tyger.</HI></P>
<P>The Fishes are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishes.</NOTE> <HI>Sea-Parrots,</HI> the <HI>Dorada,</HI> by some call'd <HI>The Sea-Bream,</HI> by others, <HI>The Amber-fish;</HI> the <HI>Bonite,</HI> the <HI>Needle-fish,</HI> the <HI>Epadon,</HI> or <HI>Sword-fish,</HI> the <HI>Marsovin,</HI> the <HI>Requiem,</HI> the <HI>Remora,</HI> the <HI>Lamantin,</HI> the <HI>Becune,</HI> the <HI>Sea-Urchin,</HI> the <HI>Sea-Woodcock,</HI> be∣sides <HI>Whales,</HI> and a certan Fish call'd, for its hideous shape, <HI>The Sea-Devil,</HI> and lastly, the <HI>Sea-Unicorn,</HI> with a particular Description of which we shall conclude, as ha∣ving it from Monsieur <HI>du Montel,</HI> who was an Eye-witness thereof.</P>
<Q><P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Sea-Unicorn.</NOTE>This <HI>Unicorn</HI> (saith he) was pursuing a <HI>Carangue,</HI> or some other lesser Fish, with such earnestness and impetuosity, that not considering that it needed a greater depth of Water than the other, it stuck with half the Body dry on a Sand-bank, whence it could not recover the deeper Waters ere it was destroy'd by the Inha∣bitants: It was about eighteen Foot in length, being at the largest part of its Body about the bigness of a Barrel: It had six great Fins like the ends of Galley-Oars, whereof two were plac'd near the Gills, and the other four on the sides of the Belly at equal distances; they were of a Vermilion red colour: All the up∣per part of the Body was cover'd with great Scales, about the bigness of a Crown-Piece, which were of a blue colour, intermix'd with several Spangles of Silver; near the Neck the Scales were closer, and of a dark colour, seeming as it were a Collar; the Scales under the Belly were yellow, the Tail forked, the Head somewhat bigger than that of a Horse, and near the same figure: It was cover'd with a hard and dark-colour'd Skin; and as the Land-<HI>Unicorn</HI> hath one Horn in his Fore-head, so this Sea-<HI>Unicorn</HI> had a very fair one issuing out of the fore-part of his Head, about nine Foot and a half in length; it was as streight as could be, and from the place whence it came out it grew smaller and smaller to the very Point, which was so sharp, that being thrust hard, it would enter in∣to Wood or Stone, or some more solid Substance; it was at the place where it came out of the Head, about sixteen Inches about, and from thence to two thirds of the length it was like a Screw, or, to say better, made waving like a wreath'd Pillar, save that the Channels grew smaller and smaller, till they gently ended in a Point, which was two Inches beyond the fourth Foot: All the lower part had over it an Ash-colour'd Skin, which was all over cover'd with a small soft Hair, short as Plush, and of the colour of a wither'd Leaf, but under that it was as white as Ivory: As to the other part, which seem'd naked, it was naturally po∣lish'd, of a shining Black, mark'd with certain small white and yellow Strokes, and of such solidity, that a sharp File could hardly get a little small Powder from it: It had no Ears standing up, but two spacious Gills, as the other Fishes; the Eyes were about the bigness of a Hens Egg; the Ball, which was of a Skye-colour Enamell'd with Yellow, was encompass'd with a certain Vermilion, which had beyond it another as clear as Crystal: The Mouth was wide enough, and fur∣nish'd with several Teeth, whereof those before were extreamly sharp, and those towards the Throat in both Jaws were broad, and a little knobbed: The Tongue was of a length and thickness proportionable, and cover'd with a rough Skin of a Vermilion colour. What was further remarkable, is, that this Fish
<PB N="351" REF="228"/>had upon the Head a kind of Crown, rising above the Skin about two Inches, and made oval-wise, the Extremities whereof ended in a Point. Above three hundred Persons of that Island did eat of the Meat of it, and that plentifully, and thought it extreamly delicate; It was interlarded with Fat, and being boyl'd it came up in flakes like fresh God, but it had a much more excellent taste.</P>
<P>Those who had seen this rare Fish alive, and had with great Levers broken the Back of it, affirm'd, That he had made prodigious Attempts to thrust them with his Horn, which he turn'd with an inexpressible dexterity and nimbleness, and that if he had had as much Water under him as would have born him up, he would have been too hard for them all. When the Entrails were taken out, it was found that he liv'd by Prey; for there were within him the Scales of several kinds of Fish.</P>

Not long after, coming over in the same Ship with the Gentleman, who had that precious Rarity put up in a long Chest, our Ship was cast away near the Island of <HI>Payala,</HI> one of the <HI>Assores,</HI> and all the Goods were lost, but nothing so much regretted as the loss of that Chest.</P></Q>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Natives how call'd.</NOTE>The Natives call themselves <HI>Cubao-bonon,</HI> that is, <HI>Inhabitants of the Islands,</HI> and <HI>Ca∣ribbeeans;</HI> which last Denomination was not onely receiv'd amongst the <HI>American</HI> Isles, but also on the Main Continent of the <HI>Northern</HI> and <HI>Southern America,</HI> long before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> coming thither.</P>
<P>Concerning the original of these People, there are several Opinions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Origi∣nal.</NOTE> for those who make them to be Extracted, from the <HI>Jews,</HI> have no other testimony, but that they abstain from Swines-flesh: Those that take them for a People fled from the great Islands, <HI>Hispaniola, Jamaica, Cuba,</HI> and <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> to save themselves from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Cruelty, dispute against a known Truth; for who knows not, that the <HI>In∣dians</HI> who escap'd the <HI>Spanish</HI> Slaughter, have not the least resemblance either in Language or Customs with the Cannibals? nay more, they are mortal Enemies to them; besides that, the Cannibals at that time when <HI>Columbus</HI> first arriv'd, possess'd those Places which they now inhabit. The Cannibals seem ignorant themselves in this Point: for they affirm their Extraction to be from <HI>Guyana,</HI> where the <HI>Cali∣bites</HI> speak the same Language, and also observe the same Customs and Religion: The occasion of their removal they ascribe to the King of the <HI>Arovages,</HI> who made all the adjacent People about his Court, Slaves to him; which to prevent, they first went to <HI>Tabago,</HI> where being strengthned by new Comers, they resolv'd to take revenge on him; and Engaging with him in a Field-Battel, utterly defeated him, and spat'd none of his Party alive, except the Women; whence it proceeds, that the <HI>Arovage</HI> Women have the same Customs and Language with the <HI>Caribbeans.</HI> But <HI>Bristock,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Knight, by long Conversation experienc'd in the severall <HI>Ameri∣can</HI> Tongues, saith, That the <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> have their Original from the <HI>Apalachites</HI> in <HI>Florida,</HI> who being a valiant People, destroy'd many of the Natives that inhabited <HI>Mexico,</HI> that so they might Settle themselves there; to which purpose they built a City like that of <HI>Apalache.</HI> The <HI>Cofachites</HI> inhabiting Northerly, and spred over a barren and Rocky Countrey, made use of this opportunity to conquer their deserted Habitation: for on a set-time they set fire to all the Villages, and spoyl'd all things which they could not carry away with them, that not the least hopes of return∣ing might be left them; therefore they must either Conquer or Die: which re∣solv'd
<PB N="352" REF="229"/>upon, they fell unawares on the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> whose King had nevertheless so much time, that he Guarded the usual Paths which directed to the inhabited Vil∣lages: But the <HI>Apalachites</HI> leaving the common Roads, climb'd over almost inac∣cessible Mountains, and so got into the heart of the Countrey, which exceedingly amaz'd <HI>Paracousis</HI> (for so that King was call'd) who lay Encamp'd at the Foot of a Mountain, whether the Van of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> were marching: whereupon he send∣ing his Army to meet them, they began a most fierce Combat; when at last both Parties wanting Arrows, they fell upon one another with Clubs till the Night parted them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cofachi∣tes</HI> come to Terms of A∣greement with the <HI>Apa∣lachites.</HI></NOTE> and neither could boast of the Victory.

<P>The <HI>Phenicians</HI> call'd the Sun <HI>Beel-samen, Lord of the Heavens;</HI> and the Citizens of <HI>Accaron,</HI> Baal-zebahim, <HI>Lord of the Offerings;</HI> but God chang'd the Name to <HI>Baal∣zebub,</HI> or <HI>The God of Flyes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moloch,</HI> or <HI>Milcom</HI> also signifi'd the Sun amongst the <HI>Ammonites;</HI> in honor of which Children were carried by their Parents, and set between two great Fires, or else by the Priests, upon pretence of cleansing them; and sometimes parch'd to death in an Image of <HI>Moloch,</HI> which had seven Cavities heated like Ovens.</P>
<P><HI>Macrobius</HI> tells us, That the <HI>Assyrians</HI> ascrib'd the supream Command to the Sun, under the Name of <HI>Adad,</HI> and to the Goddess <HI>Adargatis,</HI> representing the Image of <HI>Adad</HI> with Beams darting downwards, and <HI>Adargatis</HI> with those that shot upwards: by the first they express'd, that the celestial Power consisted in Sun-beams, which shooting downwards warm the Earth; and by the second, that all things by those Beams were cherish'd and enliven'd.</P>
<P>The most magnificent Temple which Syria <HI>Apamena</HI> boasted, was Consecrated to the Sun.</P>

<P>Near the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> lay the City <HI>Baisamsa,</HI> which signifies <HI>The House of the Sun,</HI> fa∣mous for the many Feasts which were kept there in honor of this Planet.</P>
<PB N="353" REF="229"/>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> accounted this Luminary for the greatest God, and Consecrated to him three several Feasts, looking upon him as the Author of Wisdom, Goodness, and Power, and is express'd by three several Operations, <HI>viz.</HI> Warmth, Light, and Distinction of Time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> honor'd the Name of <HI>Ofiris,</HI> whom some will have to be the same with <HI>Misraim,</HI> or <HI>Chamszoon,</HI> the first Founder of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monarchy.</P>
<P>In <HI>Egypt</HI> also was famous amongst many other Cities that of <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> which signifi'd <HI>The City of the Sun;</HI> where the Ox <HI>Mnevis</HI> or <HI>Menapis</HI> being Consecrated to the Sun, was religiously worshipp'd. This Image is describ'd by <HI>Macrobius.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> made likewise great Offerings to their <HI>Assabin,</HI> for so they call'd the Sun; and allow'd their Priests onely the priviledge to gather Cinamon, and that with this <HI>Proviso,</HI> That they should first Offer forty four Oxen, besides Goats and Rams, to <HI>Assabin,</HI> nor should fetch the least Stick of Cinamon either immediately before or after Sun-set: The Cinamon brought altogether, was to be divided by the Chief Priest, and the rest having each their Portion assign'd, that which re∣main'd was sold to the Merchants, to Trade with into Foreign Parts; but if the Sun chanc'd to set the Cinamon on fire, then they concluded they had not dealt justly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks,</HI> according to <HI>Proclus,</HI> hung a long Pole full of Laurel and Flowers on every seventh day of the Moneth; on the top thereof was a great Copper Ball, from which hung others still lesser and lesser; about the middle of the Pole hung three hundred and sixty five Garlands; and the bottom thereof was cover'd with a Womans Garment of a yellow colour; The uppermost Ball represented the Sun, the lesser the Stars, and the Garlands the Days of the Year; in which manner they worshipp'd the Sun.</P>
<P>The same Luminary the <HI>Massagetes</HI> and old <HI>Germans</HI> ador'd in antient times; and to this day the People in the utmost North, <HI>Japanners, Chineses, Tartars,</HI> and the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indians,</HI> pay their chief Devotions to the Sun;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why Divine Worship so generally gi∣ven to the Sun.</NOTE> the reason of which may easily be made out: for it is the common Opinion of all Men, as <HI>Aristotle, Simplicius, The∣mistius,</HI> and other Heathens witness, to place the Omnipotent Godhead in the up∣permost Orb, which surrounds the Earth; wherefore those that Pray, lift up their Hands to Heaven: but because the rest of the Heavens appear not so resplendent as the Sun, therefore they take the Sun for the onely chief God, whether for its ex∣ceeding lustre and glory, or for its being a hundred and sixty times bigger than the Earth; or for its swift Course, in running ten hundred thousand Leagues in so short a time, or for its-nourishing and genial Warmth, which gives Life to all things, or for its necessary Light, by which all worldly Affairs are manag'd, or for its measuring the Days by its moving from East to West, and the Seasons of the Year, by a Course from the South to the North; for all these excellent qualities being well consider'd by the most Learned <HI>Heathens,</HI> or observ'd by those of lesser Judgment, have made them shew that Honor to a visible Creature, which is onely due to the invisible Creator.</P>

<P>But because the memory of antique Passages hath no firm foundation in Books, having been onely taken by Tradition from time to time amongst the <HI>Caribbeeans,</HI> therefore we cannot give you an exact Account of their Removal from <HI>Florida;</HI> yet it remains without contradiction, that it hapned above five Ages before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Arrival, which time at least was requir'd to the peopling of so many great Islands and Kingdoms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Original of the Apala∣chites.</NOTE>Concerning the Original of the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> they themselves affirm, that they cannot certainly determine the time when they first Setled here: however, they report that they have peopled the Provinces <HI>Bemarin, Amana,</HI> and <HI>Matika,</HI> many Ages ago. That they are Extracted from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> appears not obscurely, by their Customs, Idolatry, and Language. Amongst other things, they have learn'd from the <HI>Tartars</HI> religiously to remember those Kings which perform'd any grand Ex∣ploits in the Service of their Countrey. Amongst others, the <HI>Apalachites</HI> make men∣tion in their <HI>Areitos,</HI> or Songs, of a King call'd <HI>Maydo,</HI> eminent for his noble At∣chievements, and prudent Governing of his People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Opi∣nions in Re∣ligion.</NOTE>They believe that the Sun many Ages since was Darken'd or Ecclips'd twenty four Hours together, during which time the Waters over-flow'd the highest Moun∣tains, except that of <HI>Olaimi,</HI> where there stood a stately Temple, built in honor of the Sun; in which all those that fled thither were preserv'd, and dispers'd after∣wards into several parts to re-people the World as soon as the Waters were abated, and the Sun appear'd in his full lustre again: whereupon they imagine, that to this day their Bird <HI>Tonatzuli,</HI> at the Rising of the Sun congratulates his appearance with great joy, and at his Setting, requests his speedy return from under the Horizon.</P>

Amongst them were several Learned Men, which so effe∣ctually perswaded the <HI>Heathens</HI> to embrace the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith, that in twenty eight years time the King and most of his Nobles were Converted and Baptiz'd by them in the chief City <HI>Melilot.</HI></P>
<P>But since our Design is onely to give you an exact Account of those People which inhabit the Islands lying before <HI>America,</HI> it is sufficient that we have shew'd you how they are Extracted from the <HI>Cofachites</HI> and the <HI>Apalachites.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Customs of the <HI>Caribbeeans,</HI> since they are very much alter'd by their long Conversation with the <HI>Europeans,</HI> we cannot better inform our selves of their
<PB N="356" REF="231"/>antient Gustoms, than from those which to this day are observ'd on <HI>St. Vincent,</HI> and some parts of the Main Continent, where the <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> have learn d nothing from any Strangers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Carib∣beeans.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> are a well proportioned People with broad Shoulders and Hips, round Faces, without Beards, wide Mouthes, white Teeth, little Eyes like the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI> Feet so hard, that they are almost Dart-proof, flat Noses, so made by squeezing them down in their Infancy, and long black Hair. There are few or no deformed People amongst them; all of them go stark naked, and paint their Bodies Red witlr a Plant call'd <HI>Rocou,</HI> and Oyl; about their Eyes they draw a black Circle with the Juice of the Apple <HI>Junipa.</HI> This their Painting serves them both as an Ornament, and to make them strong. Others anoint their Bodies all over with a glewy Stuff, on which they stick all sorts of Feathers. Others use Gum and Flowers. Moreover, they adorn their Head with Plumes, their Ears with Fish-bones, or Scales of the <HI>Caret,</HI> or pieces of Crystal, which they also hang in their Lips and Noses. The Men wear Armlets near their Shoulders, and the Women about their Wrists; about their Legs they tie for Garters Strings of Seeds: others take a pride in wearing the Bones of their slain Enemies, and the Teeth of the <HI>Agouty,</HI> Tygers, wild Cats, or Cockle shells. When they appear in greatest lustre, then they wear Armlets under their Arm-pits, and also Scarfs of Feathers, which either hang over their Shoulders, or are girt about their Middle, so that one end thereof tou∣ches their Thighs. They set an exceeding value on certain pieces of Copper call'd <HI>Caracolis,</HI> the least of which they hang in their Ears, and the biggest before their Breasts: and because they are fetch'd out of the Province of the <HI>Arovages</HI> their Ene∣mies, they are esteem'd as Marks of true Valor, and he is highly esteem'd that wears them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> which Converse with the <HI>Europeans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Lan∣guage.</NOTE> speak two sorts of Langua∣ges, the oldest of which is smooth, acceptable, fluent, and for the most part spoke between the Lips. According to the several pronunciations one word hath divers significations: but the Mystery of their oldest Language they will discover to none. It is very observable, that the <HI>Caribbeean</HI> Men speak several words, which though the Women understand, yet are never spoken by them: and also the antient People use several Sayings which the younger never mention, and the Youths such likewise as are never spoken by the Antient, which being spoken apart by each in the time of War, are understood by none but their Soldiers, that so their Designs may the better be kept secret. But their mix'd Language hath many of the <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> words, especially of the <HI>Spanish,</HI> which they speak whensoe're they converse with the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Moreover, though the <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> on the least occasion laugh aloud, yet they are of a dull Spirit, stubborn, and nothing to be got out of them but by fair means.</P>
<P>Their Employment is Hunting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Man∣ners.</NOTE> Fishing, Tilling, Building of Houses, and the like. Theft is not known amongst them, so that no Man is suspicious of his Neigh∣bor; wherefore they leave their Huts open both Night and Day. They are also seldom at Variance one with another, but generally Love sways amongst them; yet if a Quarrel doth happen, then the injur'd Person revenges himself to the heighth. Persons that profess Chastity are much honor'd amongst them; and here Youth bears great respect to Age.</P>
<P>They are also very ignorant in natural Knowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Igno∣rance.</NOTE> insomuch that when the Moon is Eclips'd, they suppose that it is devour'd by <HI>Maboya;</HI> and wheresoe're they smell any ill scent, they believe the Devil to be not far from thence. Gun∣powder they suppose to be a Grain, and are very fearful of Fire-Arms: Though
<PB N="357" REF="231"/>they have many brave Salt-pits, yet they use no Salt, nor eat any Swines-flesh, though all those Islands abound in that sort of Animal, fearing that if they should eat the same, it would cause them to have little Eyes, which they account very homely, though it is a property generally incident to them; neither will they eat any Tortoise, because they would not be so gross as that Creature. Lastly, they know now no greater Number than they reckon on their Fingers and Toes, for what exceeds twenty is to them innumerable: They hold that good Spirits, whom they call <HI>Akamoue,</HI> residing in Heaven, never trouble themselves with Earthly Affairs.</P>
<P>Their Offerings consist in <HI>Cassave</HI> and the first of their Fruits, which are set at the end of their Huts in Vessels on small Tables, cover'd with Leaves or Rushes, without uttering any Prayers; for they never Pray but in publick in company of the <HI>Boyez</HI> or Priests, and that either for revenge against Injuries, or for recovery from Sickness, or that they may know the Events of War, or for Protection against the <HI>Maboya.</HI></P>
<P>Each <HI>Boye</HI> hath his peculiar God which, Singing with a conjuring Verse, he calls to him in the Night whilst he Smoaks a Pipe of Tobacco.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fear of the <HI>Maboya.</HI></NOTE>Some have been of Opinion, that this Conceit of the <HI>Maboya</HI> proceeds from the phlegmatick Nature of the <HI>Caribbeeans,</HI> who in their melancholy Dreams imagine themselves to be grievously beaten by the said <HI>Maboya.</HI> But there are sufficient testi∣monies to prove, that these <HI>Heathens</HI> have often really suffer'd much by this <HI>Maboya,</HI> often appearing to them in such horrid shapes, that the poor <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> would sweat and quake at the sight thereof, and inflicting such sad Pinches and bloody Stripes all over their Bodies, that they liv'd in perpetual fear of this evil Spirit: and yet notwithstanding these cruel Sufferings, they shew'd no manner of Worship to <HI>Ma∣boya,</HI> onely they believ'd that they had some ease, when they wore little Pictures about their Necks, made resembling the Shapes in which <HI>Maboya</HI> appear'd to them; but their best Remedy was to flye to the <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Con∣sultations a∣bout the Death of any Relation.</NOTE>They believe their <HI>Boyez</HI> able to resolve any Question they ask of them; parti∣cularly, when any one dies, the nearest ally'd to him asks the <HI>Boye</HI> this Question, <HI>Who is the occasion of his Death?</HI> to which if the <HI>Boye</HI> names any one, they never rest till they have dispatch'd him to the other World. Concerning their original brutish way of living, they give much credit to an antient Fable, which is to this effect:</P>
<P>The most antient <HI>Caribbeeans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabulous Tradition.</NOTE> living under no other Roof than the Canopy of Heaven, fed on nothing but what the Fields naturally produc'd, which salvage Life an old Man much beamoan'd; when a certain Deity clad in white Apparel descending down on the Earth, said, <HI>That he would have come sooner to have shew'n them the way of a civil Life, had they requested it before.</HI> Moreover, the Angel shew'd them a place along the Shore where there lay sharp-cutting Stones, with which he told them they might cut down Trees, and with the Timber build themselves Houses, and cover them with the Leaves of the Palm-Tree to keep out the Rain; which said, he broke his Staff into three pieces, which being Planted, soon after produc'd the Root <HI>Manioe,</HI> which stamp'd and dry'd, made good Bread.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Opini∣on concern∣ing the Soul.</NOTE>The <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> have also a strange Opinion concerning the Soul, that is to say, That every one hath as many Souls as he hath Pulses, but the chiefest is the Heart it self, which after Death removes with <HI>Jeheizi,</HI> (that is every ones peculiar God or Genius) to the Company of the other Deities, where they live after the same man∣ner as here on Earth; wherefore those that are Persons of Quality give Charge at their Deaths, that their Servants may be kill'd and buried with them, that so they may serve them in the other World; That the other Souls, which are the Pulses,
<PB N="358" REF="232"/>are of two sorts, whereof the first call'd <HI>Maboya's,</HI> range through Woods and Wil∣dernesses; and the other call'd <HI>The Oumekous,</HI> reside along the Sea, and over-turn the Ships that Sail by; That the Souls of Heroes remove to pleasant and delightful Islands, where they are serv'd by the <HI>Arovages;</HI> That Cowards at their Death go behind a high Mountain, where they become perpetual Slaves to the <HI>Arovages.</HI></P>
<P>So soon as they hear a clap of Thunder they run into their Huts, and place themselves on little Stools round the Fire, cover their Faces, and laying their Heads on their Knees, make a doleful noise, as supposing that <HI>Maboya</HI> is exceedingly enrag'd against them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Dwel∣ling.</NOTE>Their Huts, for the most part built near Rivers and Streams, are of an oval fashion, their Roofs made of Palm-Tree Leaves or Sugar-Canes, the Walls nothing but Boughs set in the Ground and pleited together, and the Floor of sifted Earth or Sand, ramm'd in and kept very even and smooth; besides a Room wherein they Sleep and Entertain their Friends, they have also a Kitchin to dress their Meat, and a place to lay their Bowes, Arrows, Clubs, and the like, in; they use Mats in stead of Walls, to separate one Apartment from the other. Their Hous∣hold-stuff is little; the richest of them have Hammocks in stead of Beds; the meaner sort use Sticks laid cross one another, and cover'd thick with the Leaves of the <HI>Banana</HI>-Tree, made fast at the four corners with Cords. Hollow <HI>Calabashes;</HI> and Earthen Ware call'd <HI>Canaris,</HI> serve them for their Kitchin Utensils. In the little <HI>Canaris</HI> they prepare their <HI>Tumalis,</HI> or <HI>Pepper-pottage,</HI> and in the biggest their Liquor <HI>Ovicou.</HI></P>
<P>Their Cleanliness may appear by this, that when they go to ease Nature, they make a Hole in the Ground with a Stick, and after they have done, stop it up again, burying their Excrement that it may not be seen.</P>
<P>Round about their Huts feed many Hens and Turkies, which they breed not so much for their own use, as to exchange for Iron.</P>
<P>They remove their Habitations very often, either out of fear of being haunted by the Ghost of some deceased Person, or to avoid some Smell which they find noisom and offensive, or because their Hut hath been set on fire by Lightning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Hous∣hold Affairs and Diet.</NOTE>The Women are always employ'd to keep their Families in good order, to pre∣pare Venison and Fish for the Mens Tables, to spin Cotton, Comb their Hus∣bands, and paint them Red. The Men spend their time in the Wars, Hunting or Fishing. They have also learn'd of the <HI>Europeans</HI> to burn Train-Oyl in Lamps in the Night, when as before they burnt Twigs of a gummy Shrub before mention'd, which for that reason the <HI>Hollanders</HI> call'd <HI>Candle-Wood.</HI> Each hath a little Stool, and a Table call'd <HI>Mantoutou,</HI> on which he eats his Meat when he pleases, having no set-Meals. The broad <HI>Banana</HI>-Leaves serve them for Napkins and Table-clothes. Their chiefest Dainty is Crabs roasted in the Shell with the Juice of Lemmon and <HI>Pyman.</HI> At great Feasts they dress their Meat with the Fat of their Enemies, being the <HI>Arovages.</HI> Their usual Drink is <HI>Mabby,</HI> made of <HI>Potato's,</HI> which refreshes, and is good against the Phlegm; also another Liquor call'd <HI>Oko,</HI> made of steep'd <HI>Cassa∣dar,</HI> and is like Beer in taste, strength, and colour. They also by making an incision into the Palm-Trees, tap a Liquor from the same in <HI>Calabashes,</HI> like White-wine. They use little of the Drink <HI>Couscou,</HI> because it swells the Body, notwithstanding it is pleasing to the Palate; But the Liquor which is most esteem'd amongst them, is the Wine made of the Sugar-Canes, which are squeez'd in Mills made for that purpose, and then boyl'd in great Kettles. During the dressing of their Meat (which being done leisurely, is sometimes half a day before it is ready), they Sing, and Dance to the Time, which one keeps with a <HI>Calabash</HI> fill'd full of little Stones, in
<PB N="359" REF="232"/>which they believe the greatest happiness they shall enjoy in the other World con∣sists: But the <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> never Dance more antique than when they meet in the <HI>Carbet,</HI> which is a publick House of Entertainment; whether the Women carry a Drink made of <HI>Cassave,</HI> which makes Drunk as soon as Wine: The Men bring Fish and Hedge-hogs; all of them painted with <HI>Roucou,</HI> and adorn'd with Plumes of Feathers, commit all manner of Debaucheries. At other times they also keep Feast-days, which is either when they are preferr'd to some Office, or Place of Ho∣nor, or when they have defeated their Enemies, or when they mourn for the Death of one of their nearest Relations.</P>
<P>Their Boats, which they call <HI>Periaquo's,</HI> are made of single hollow Trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Beast.</NOTE> full of Benches, and painted with several strange Shapes, and are able each to carry fifty or sixty Men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Musi∣cal Instru∣ments.</NOTE>Their Musical Instruments in which they take most delight; are Drums, Strings of Silk-grass stretcht upon <HI>Calabashes,</HI> and Flutes made of the Bones of their Enemies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their watch∣fulness a∣gainst Ene∣mies.</NOTE>They keep Watches on high Hills, to descry the Ships off at Sea, and no sooner have they espy'd one, but they immediately give notice to one another; whereupon those that are most valiant put off to Sea in their <HI>Canoos,</HI> and know by the Lan∣guages to distinguish between a <HI>Spaniard, French</HI>-man, <HI>English</HI>-man, and <HI>Hollander.</HI> If they find that 'tis an Enemy who Lands on their Coasts, they guard all their Avenues, lie in Ambuscades, and gather together in by-ways, and where they see any advantage they shoot thousands of Arrows; which done, they fall in amongst them with great Clubs: but if they chance to be defeated, then they lurk behind Bramble-bushes, or climb up inaccessible Mountains, or else, if near the Sea, they save themselves by Diving and Swimming under Water above two hundred Paces before they appear again; and if a Party of them chance to meet together after∣wards, they venture a second Engagement:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Enter∣tainment of Friend.</NOTE> But if those that come on their Coasts are Friends, they Swim, or go in their Boats to meet them, climb up their Ships, and carry the Sea-men on their Shoulders ashore, where the <HI>Casique</HI> in the Name of the whole Island bids them welcome, and conducts them to the <HI>Carbet,</HI> where an antient Man salutes the old Men, and a Youth the young Men; after which asking their Names, the <HI>Couban</HI> calls himself by that Name ever after, and desires the Strangers to accept of his Name; during which their changing of Names they use many Ceremonies of Friendship: this done, they proffer them Cotton Ham∣mocks to rest themselves in, and pleasant Fruit to eat, till they have prepar'd other Meat; which is no sooner Ready, but a little Table is set before every one of them, and a Dish of Meat consisting of boyl'd Hedge-hogs, boyl'd Crabs, and Pot∣herbs; which if the Guests do not eat heartily, or drink up all the Liquor which they give them, they take it as a great Affront; but if they eat and drink heartily, they take it kindly, and shew great sorrow at their departure.</P>
<P>Their Offices of Government have been usually three; the meanest belong'd to the <HI>Tiouboulihauthe,</HI> whose Place was to Govern over the <HI>Carbet,</HI> a House where Stran∣gers were Entertain'd, Matters of War disputed of, and publick Feasts kept. <HI>Tioubou∣tonti</HI> Commanded the <HI>Canoos</HI> in the time of War, that is, under the <HI>Nahalene,</HI> who Commanded the whole Fleet: But the chiefest Officer of all was the <HI>Ouboutou;</HI> to which degree of Honor none attain'd, unless he had kill'd several <HI>Arovages,</HI> or at least a Governor.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> drew all their Forces out of the Islands to a Battel, then they chose one out of the <HI>Ouboutou,</HI> who during their March Commanded the Army as General, which his Office ended with the War, and extended no farther than his own Island.</P>
<PB N="360" REF="233"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their war∣like Consul∣tations</NOTE>Their warlike Consultations were no less observable, for the <HI>Ouboutou</HI> ap∣pointed a Day, on which the Islanders met at a Feast in the <HI>Carbet,</HI> whither they accordingly came all at the time appointed, and having Eat and Drunk, and Danc'd a considerable time, an antient Woman with tears in her Eyes, and mourn∣ful Countenance, enter'd the <HI>Carbet,</HI> and desir'd Audience; which being granted her, and every one silent, she began to relate the Damages which from antient times the <HI>Arovages</HI> did to the <HI>Caribbeeans;</HI> and that in the last Engagement so many va∣liant Men were slain, and afterwards devour'd by them; therefore it would be a shame not to take Revenge; which being seconded by the <HI>Ouboutu,</HI> put Valor into the Hearts of all that were present: Whereupon the following day Messengers were sent to the other Islands to acquaint them with their Intentions, that they might prepare their Clubs, make sharp and poyson their Arrows, String their Bowes, prepare Provisions, and fit out their <HI>Canoos:</HI> They poyson'd their Arrows with the Juice of <HI>Manchenillo's,</HI> which made the least Wound mortal. Their Pro∣visions and Arms they laid up in their <HI>Canoos,</HI> so to preserve their <HI>Periaguo's</HI> (which are Boats that can carry fifty Men), if they should chance to over-set, which often happen'd, though they were soon turn'd up again. They went from one Island to another, where they not onely stor'd themselves with fresh Provisions, but increas'd their Fleet with new Assistants; with which approaching the Main, they hal'd their Boats ashore in the Evening, and driving four Stakes into the Ground under the Trees, made fast their Hammocks to the same, in which they slept till Mid-night, and then fell on their Enemies, but if discover'd by them, they retrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to their Boats and return'd home; but if they were not discover'd, they fell upon the Huts of the <HI>Arovages;</HI> who resisting, they shot Arrows with burning Cotton into them, and so setting them on fire, forc'd the <HI>Arovages</HI> to venture a Battel in the open Field; where having spent all their Arrows, they Engag'd one another with great Clubs, with which at one Blow they broke either Arms or Legs, or knock'd out their Brains. If the <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> chanc'd to be defeated, then those that remain'd of their Party made a lamentable noise, howling for those that were kill'd, and mix'd their Tears with the Blood of their slain Friends, whom not without the greatest danger they fetch'd from amongst their Enemies, and carried them aboard of their Boats: But returning Victors, they were wont to insult over their Prisoners with all the bitter Taunts imaginable, and then taking advantage of those sharp Upbraidings which their cruel usage extorted from them, to put them to death with most inhu∣mane Tortures, and then to Feast themselves upon their mangled Bodies, all claiming a Right to their several Prisoners, as to so many Beasts appointed to the Slaughter; But of late Ages they have contented themselves to dispatch them spee∣dily with their Clubs, and so assign them to their Shambles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their En∣mity to the <HI>Spaniard.</HI></NOTE>As the <HI>Arovages</HI> had been formerly, so the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at length became the Object of the <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> irreconcilable Hatred, insomuch that oft-times being Invaded by them, they gave them such rough Entertainment, that they were glad to save them∣selves by flight; for the <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> not regarding their Guns, press'd upon them, and many times took Vessels richly laden from them, till of late years that a Peace hath been concluded between them; wherein nevertheless those of the <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> re∣fuse to be concern'd, that inhabit <HI>St. Dominico</HI> and <HI>St. Vincent,</HI> who cannot to this day forget the cruel Outrages committed by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>To come to their Marriages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mar∣riages.</NOTE> they were allow'd as many Wives as they pleas'd to have, insomuch that their Governors were in esteem according to the number of their Wives; nor were degrees of Consanguinity so regarded, but that an Uncle might take his Neece; whom he no sooner had carried to his House, but the Mar∣riage
<PB N="361" REF="233"/>was finish'd. They seldom Divorc'd their Wives after they had bore them Children, but otherwise the Man would break the Bond of Matrimony when he pleas'd. A young Man that had no Relation might court a Stranger, and if her Parents allow'd of it, the Match was made. One that had behav'd himself vali∣antly against the <HI>Arovages</HI> was sure of several good Matches, for he was refus'd by none whom he Courted; and the abundance of Wives was the greatest testimony of their Valor. Each Wife had a peculiar Dwelling, so to prevent all Dissentions: So soon as one of them was with Child, her Husband Lay not with her till after Delivery. If any Woman committed Adultery, her Husband was permitted to knock out her Brains, or rip open her Belly; which done, he acquainted her Fa∣ther with the Deed, who return'd him thanks for the same. Murderers were ei∣ther burnt or cut in pieces. Children were born here with little trouble, for the Women were no sooner Deliver'd, but they carried the Infant to wash at the next Brook; which done they return'd home to their Houshold Labor, whilest the Man on the contrary kept his Bed, and ate nothing but a piece of <HI>Cassava</HI> Bread, which he hollow'd out in the middle, and left the edges till the Feast, which was kept at the Naming of the Child: Moreover, he fed on all manner of Dainties for a whole year after. But this Custom was observ'd onely at the Birth of the first Son, at which time they scratch'd the Father's Shoulder with a sharp Curry-combe, at which if he flinch'd not, it was accounted a good Omen of the Childs future Valor. At fifteen days old they made Holes in the Childs Ears, Lips, and Nostrils, through which they put a String for the tying on of what-ever Ornamentals. With the like Ceremonies the Child receiv'd a Name, taken from his Predecessors, Trees, Fishes, or some remarkable Passages during the Mothers bearing of the Infant in her Womb, or of the Father's Lying-in: But this Name was chang'd so soon as they went to War, or kill'd a Commander of the <HI>Arovages,</HI> whose Name they exchang'd for their own: After which the Mothers took special care in bringing them up, and at six Moneths the Children were able to run alone: When they attain'd to the age of two years, they cut off their Hair, at a great Feast made for that purpose; from which time forward they exercis'd them in Shooting with Bowes and Ar∣rows; to which purpose they hung up pieces of Meat for them to shoot at, which they must either hit down, or Fast.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Initiation of Soldiers.</NOTE>Their Ceremonies to make Soldiers were very strange, <HI>viz.</HI> The Father con∣ducted his Son to the <HI>Carbet,</HI> where he told him the Duties of a Soldier, beat him with a Bird of prey, call'd <HI>Mans-fenis,</HI> till he had bruis'd the Head of the Bird, and scratch'd his whole Body all over with a Curry-combe till the Blood came, and then put Lemmon Juice into the Wounds, afterwards put him in a Hammock, and hung him up for several days without giving him any Meat; all which Torments and Trials if he endur'd with patience, then he was accounted a good and appro∣ved Soldier.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Priests.</NOTE>Few bred up their Children to be <HI>Boyez,</HI> or Priests; yet those that were brought up to it, abstain'd from certain Food from their Infancy, and before they could be receiv'd into the Order of Priesthood, they were forc'd to draw Blood from every part of their Bodies.</P>

<P>Besides Ducks, Pluvers, Moor-hens; Geese, and the like Fowls (that suffer themselves to be catch'd by the Hands of Men, which are very strange
<PB N="374" REF="243"/>to them) there are here also many rare sorts of Birds, as the white Birds call'd <HI>Aigrettos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aigrettos.</NOTE> which are somewhat bigger than Crows, with red Bills and Feet, and curious Plumes on their Heads; they often flye a great way off at Sea.</P>
<P>The large Bird call'd <HI>The Craw-fowl,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Craw-fowl.</NOTE> which feeds on Fish, hath a thick Head, a long flat Bill, hollow Eyes, and a short Neck, under which hangs the Maw, big enough to contain a Pail full of Water: On the Trees along the Sea-side they watch for Fish which swim near the top of the Water, and by their attentiveness on their Prey, are easily shot themselves.</P>
<P>Here is likewise the Bird <HI>Arras,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arras.</NOTE> of the bigness of a Pheasant, but more resem∣bling a Parraquito: their long Tail consists of divers colour'd Feathers, some have shining skye-colour'd Heads, Backs, and Necks, their Bellies and Wings of a pale Yellow; they are so stout, or rather so simple, that if they are not hit with the first Shot, they will stay for a second: They also learn to talk, but not so di∣stinctly as the <HI>Canides,</HI> which are no way inferior in beauty to the <HI>Arras,</HI> nay exceed them very much: Monsieur <HI>du Montell</HI> above mention'd, seeing one at <HI>Corassao,</HI> de∣scribes it after this manner:</P>
<Q><P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Cani∣des.</HI></NOTE>It deserves to be numbred (saith he) amongst the most beautiful Birds in the World: I took so particular notice of it, having had of them in my Hands ma∣ny times, that I have the Idea's of it still fresh in my Memory. Under the Belly, Wings, and Neck, it was of a waving <HI>Aurora</HI>-colour, the Back, and one half of the Wings, of a very bright Skye-colour, the Tail and greater Feathers of the Wings were mix'd with a sparkling Carnation, diversifi'd with a Skye-colour, as upon the Back a Grass-green and shining Black, which very much added to the Gold and Azure of the other Plumage: But the most beautiful part was the Head, cover'd with a Murrey Doun, checquer'd with Green, Yellow, and a pale Blue, which reach'd down wavingly to the Back: The Eye-lids were white, and the Apple of the Eye yellow and red as a Ruby Set in Gold: It had upon the Head a certain Tuft or Cap of Feathers of a Vermilion Red, sparkling like a lighted Coal, which was encompass'd by several other lesser Feathers of a Pearl∣colour.</P>
<P>If it were recommendable for all these extraordinary Ornaments, it was much more for its Familiarity and Innocency; for though it had a crooked Beak, and that the Claws with which it held its Meat and brought it to its Beak, were so sharp as to take away whatsoever it fastned upon, yet was it so tame as to play with little Children and never hurt them; and when one took him into his Hand, he so contracted his Claws, that the sharpness of them could not be felt: He had this Quality of a Dog, That he would Lick with his short and thick Tongue those who made much of him and gave him something he lik'd, put his Head to their Cheeks to Kiss and Caress them, and expressing his Acknowledgments by a thousand pretty Insinuations, he would suffer himself to be put into what po∣sture one would, and took a certain pleasure in diverting those he thought his Friends: But as he was mild and traceable to those who were kind to him, so was he mischievous and irreconcileable to such as had injur'd him, and he could distinguish them from others, and make them feel the sharpness of his Beak and Claws.</P>
<P>He pratled in the <HI>Dutch, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Languages, and in the last he sung Airs as a natural <HI>Indian:</HI> He also imitated the Cries of all sorts of Poultrey and other Creatures about the House; he call'd all his Friends by their Names and Sir∣names, flew to them as soon as he saw them, especially when he was hungry; if they had been absent, and that he had not seen them a long time, he express'd
<PB N="375" REF="243"/>his joy at their return by certain merry Notes; when he had sported himself till they were weary of him, he went away, and perch'd himself on the top of the House, and there he talk'd, sung, and play'd a thousand tricks, laying his Fea∣thers in order, and dressing and cleaning himself with his Beak. He was easily kept; for not onely the Bread commonly us'd in that Island, but all the Fruits and Roots growing there, were his ordinary Food; and when he had more gi∣ven him than he needed, he carefully laid up the remainder under the Leaves wherewith the House was cover'd, and took it when he had need. In a word, I never saw a more loving or more amiable Bird; 'twas a Present for any Prince, if he could have been brought over the Sea. This Bird had been brought from the <HI>Caribbee</HI> Islands to Monsieur <HI>Rodenborck,</HI> then Governor of the Fort and <HI>Dutch</HI> Colony, which is in the Island of <HI>Corassao.</HI></P></Q>

<P>This Description of Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>'s, in it self very false, is also much to the Dishonor of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, which makes me presume to trouble you with my own Observations, wherein ha∣ving onely aim'd at the Truth, you shall not have cause to doubt of being misguided.</P>
<P>This Island of <HI>Barbados</HI> is seated in thirteen Degrees and twenty Minutes, in longth twenty two Miles, and in breadth fourteen and an half; It is na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urally fortifi'd with Rocks and Shoals on the North and East side of it, where no Ship may safely Anchor, onely in two or three places
<PB N="379" REF="247"/>small Boats may go out and in to Fish. On the South-East and Westerly part, it is all along a Road where Ships may Ride at Anchor, but more especially in four chief Places, Roads and Bays thereof.</P>
<P>The principal Road or Bay is call'd <HI>Carlisle Bay,</HI> and lieth on the South-West part of the Island near its Center, and is a good Road, where five hundred Ships of any Burthen may Ride safely from all but South and Westerly Winds, which seldom in these Parts happen, they ge∣nerally blowing Easterly, whence it is that we call the East parts <HI>Windward,</HI> and the West parts <HI>Leeward.</HI> Here lies also the chief Town for Trade, call'd formerly the <HI>Bridge-Town,</HI> but now <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> and having two Forts, answering each other, and a Platform between, which Commands the Road, and Defends the Town; the first and chiefest Fort is call'd <HI>Charles Fort,</HI> standing on <HI>Nedhams Point,</HI> lying out in the Sea to Windward of the Bay and Town, so that an Enemy keeping out of Command of this Fort, cannot (probably) come to do the Ships or the Town injury, for that they must come full in or against the Wind. This Fort is built strong with Stone and Lime; the Platform joyns to the Windward part of the Town; also the other Fort joyns to the Leeward part of the Town, all which are well fortifi'd and stor'd with great Guns. The Town consists of several Streets and Lanes, being about thirty Chain in length, and fif∣teen in breadth, and hath many fair and large Buildings, whereof the most are of Stone and Lime.</P>
<P>The second Road and Town is lately call'd <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> situate on <HI>Oysters-Bay,</HI> and lies about two Leagues to Windward of <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> having also two Forts and one Platform; the two Forts stand the one to Windward, and the other to Leeward of the Town and Road, and the Platform in the middle, all well furnish'd with great Guns. And although this Town be not a Place of much Resort for Shipping, yet here are many considerable Store-houses for Trade, wherein Monethly are kept the Court of <HI>Common-Pleas</HI> for that Precinct, and Weekly Markets.</P>
<P>The third Road and Town is lately call'd <HI>St. James's,</HI> formerly the <HI>Hall,</HI> and is about two Leagues to the Leeward of <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> hath one very large Platform, and is otherwise well for∣tifi'd with Breast-works; and although few Ships come to Ride here, yet in this Town is main∣tain'd a great Trade with the Inhabitants adjacent; here also is kept Monethly the Court of <HI>Com∣mon-Pleas</HI> for this Precinct.</P>
<P>The fourth Road and Town is lately call'd <HI>Little Bristol,</HI> but formerly <HI>Sprights-Bay,</HI> which lieth about four Leagues to Leeward of <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> and hath two Forts well built, and strongly fortifi'd. To this Place come many Ships, especially from the City of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the which here Ride, unload and re-load, it being the next greatest Place of Repute to <HI>St. Michaels</HI> in the whose Island.</P>
<P>This Island is divided into eleven Parishes, and hath in it fourteen Churches and Chappels, and being subdivided into divers Plantations, small and great, hath Sugar-works accordingly, with fair and large Buildings made of Stone and Brick, the which generally are pleasant Habi∣tations, and delightfully situated, most having pleasant Prospects to the Sea and Land.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Island are <HI>English, Scotch,</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> and some, but very few of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Nation, who formerly liv'd here a time of Servitude, and now dwell as Free-men, some by their Trades, and others on Plantations; also some few <HI>Jews</HI> live here and Trade as Merchants, they having obtain'd Licence from Hit Majesty so to do; besides <HI>Mulat∣to's</HI> and <HI>Negro's</HI> which are here kept, and accounted for Slaves, the number of which some years since, upon search, were found to be sixty thousand Persons, <HI>viz.</HI> forty thousand <HI>Whites,</HI> and twenty thousand <HI>Blacks.</HI></P>
<P>The standing <HI>Militia</HI> of this Island that are in readiness to meet together on all occasions, and which at other times are often and well Disciplin'd, consist of two Regiments of Horse, and five Regiments of Foot, wherein several Companies have near two hundred in a Company, and in some Troops more than a hundred Horse in a Troop; by all which you may easily apprehend how little of truth there is in that Saying, <HI>That we hold this Island at the Courtesie of the Spani∣ards,</HI> when those few <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Jamaica</HI> give the <HI>Spaniards</HI> such work to defend themselves.</P>
<PB N="380" REF="248"/>
<P>The Growth and Manufacture of this Island and parts adjacent, is Sugars of all sorts, <HI>viz. Muscovado,</HI> Clay'd, and Refin'd; (I suppose I have seen here as good Sugar made as any is in the World) Gingers, Indico, and Cotton-wool; also Tobacco, Logwood, <HI>Fustick,</HI> green and yellow, and <HI>Lignum-vitae:</HI> Of these four last heretofore much, but now no quantities to be had in this Island, onely to the Leeward great store. The first four mention'd Commodities receive prejudice to their Product by abundance of Rains or Droughts not happening in their proper Seasons: also violent Winds lodge the Sugar-Canes, thereby the quantity and goodness is lessned. The chief time for Expectation is from <HI>January</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> when comes in the wet Season, that makes the Roads not Cartable, and usually puts an end to Making and Transportation of them. We have two Crops of Corn in a year, Planted usually when the Rains first come in, in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> which is gather'd in about <HI>October,</HI> and in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April</HI> following. Wines of all sorts are here Imported, but of <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>French</HI> the greatest quantities, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Madera,</HI> upwards of fifteen hundred Tun yearly; of <HI>Spanish,</HI> upward of two hundred Tun; of <HI>French-Wines,</HI> upward of seven hundred Tun; besides Brandy and <HI>English</HI> Spirits; but of these latter now no great quantities Imported or spent, by reason of the general use of the Spirit of Sugar-Cane, call'd <HI>Rum,</HI> which the meaner sort, as Servants and Slaves, do not onely drink in great abundance, but much also is hence Transported into <HI>Virginia, Bermudas,</HI> and <HI>New-England.</HI> Here is also Imported great store of Provisions of all sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> Beef, Pork, Fish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Ireland, New-England, Virginia, Bermudas, New-found Land,</HI> &amp;c. also Pease, Flour, Butter, Cheese, and Bisquet; likewise Timber, Boards, Pipe and Hogshead, Staves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> also <HI>Negro</HI>-Slaves from <HI>Guinee,</HI> and live Cattel, as Bulls, Cows, <HI>Asinego's,</HI> and Horses, from the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Island, <HI>New-England;</HI> and from <HI>England,</HI> Servants, and all other Commodities for Plantations, and for Apparel; of all which great quantities are hither brought and sold.</P>
<P>The Shipping that comes to Trade to this Island belongs generally to <HI>England;</HI> some few Vessels are here built, and pass to and fro to the Leeward Islands; and some belong to <HI>New-England, Bermudas,</HI> &amp;c. The number of Vessels which come hither to Trade in one year is found upon search to be about two hundred of all sorts, (some years more, some less) as Ketches, Sloops, Barques, &amp;c. containing in Burthen fifteen thousand five hundred and five Tun, accord∣ing as they were here Entred, which is at the least a third part less than their true Burthen, by reason every Ship pays one pound of Powder <HI>per</HI> Tun, the means ordain'd by this Country for storing the Magazine; the greatest part of which Ships re-load with Sugars for <HI>England,</HI> and many go for <HI>New-England, Bermudas, Virginia, Tangier,</HI> &amp;c. not always full loaden with this Countreys Growth. The usual Rate for Tunnage from hence to <HI>London,</HI> is from <HI>4 l.</HI> to <HI>5 l. per</HI> Tun; sometime when Ships are very plentiful, it is at <HI>3 l.</HI> and less, and at other times when scarce, from <HI>6 l.</HI> to <HI>7 l.</HI> in the late War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it was at <HI>10. 11.</HI> and <HI>12 l. per</HI> Tun.</P>
<P>The Government is Constituted by the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and Laws not repugnant to them, onely some particular Laws are here made, proper for this Place, by the Governor (or Deputy) and his Council, (which usually are from seven to twelve in number) and an Assembly that consists of twenty two Persons, chosen by the Free-holders, two out of every Parish.</P>

<P>Captain <HI>Vitgeest</HI> coming to an Anchor here, found a convenient Inlet on the East, and fresh Water to fill his Casks. Half a League from the Shore rise five Rocks, through which he Sail'd with his Ships. Within the Cliff opens a Bay, in∣to which runs a River well stor'd with Fish. More Westerly lies a larger Inlet, which receives two delightful Streams. From the Western Promontory runs also a Cliff Northward into the Sea.</P>
<P>This Island is easily known by high Coasts which rife on the East side, and so grows lower by degrees. It is likewise made pleasant by many Walks of Trees.</P>
<P>The Sea produces abundance of those sorts of Fish which are common amongst us, besides Tortoises, that lay their Eggs in the Sand.</P>
<P>The Cra-fish thereabouts are not much unlike Lobsters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cra-fish.</NOTE> have white and well tasted Flesh, but hard to digest; they catch them in the Night on sandy Shelves with lighted Torches.</P>
<P>The Crabs get their Food very wonderfully here;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crabs.</NOTE> for when they observe the Mussles or Oysters to Gape for fresh Air, they put Stones between their Shells, so that they not being able to shut them, they pull out the Fish with their Claws.</P>

<P>The Soil light and sandy, refuses not the production of divers sorts of Fruits common amongst us.</P>

<P>A Silver Mine hath been long since discover'd on this Island, in which the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> claim equal Interest, but neither Party make any benefit of it for want of Miners.</P>
<P>The high Mountains, the Springs of boyling sulphurous Water, and brambly Woods, hinder all passage through the middle of the Island: The Ground runs more and more sloaping to the Sea-side, and is divided into several High-ways, along which stand convenient Houses, cover'd with red or glaz'd Slate, shaded with Trees, and environ'd with pleasant Gardens, to which there is a delightful Prospect from the Fields, of the green Tobacco-Leaves, the yellow Sugar-Canes, Ginger, and Potato's.</P>

<P>Westward appear several Mountains, whose high Heads are invested with ever-flourishing Trees; and between the Palace and those Mountains a very large and stately Garden, full of all manner of Flowers and other delightful Plants, as well those commonly known amongst us, as those peculiar to that part of the World; in the middle thereof stands a Fountain, deriving its Source from the Foot of a neighboring Hill.</P>

<P>The Governor keeps nine hundred Slaves, and a hundred <HI>French</HI>-men, to work in his three Sugar-Mills, to till his Ground, and for his Houshold-Service.</P>
<P>Several <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen have also built many fair Houses here; amongst which the chiefest are those on which <HI>Poucy, Treval, Benevent, Girand, Auber, de la Roziere, de St. Andant, de l' Esperance,</HI> and <HI>de la Loche</HI> spent great sums of Money.</P>

<PB N="387" REF="251"/>want of Provisions; Having during this time been on the Islands <HI>St. Martin, Mont∣serrat,</HI> and <HI>Antego,</HI> thinking to have possess'd himself of some or other of them in stead of <HI>St. Christophers,</HI> but not finding such a fruitful Soil, and convenient Situa∣tion, as what he had been forc'd to forsake, he was not forward to fix there, but ra∣ther judg'd it convenient to enquire concerning the Condition of <HI>St. Christophers,</HI> and at last being inform'd by a Ketch, that the Enemy was gone to <HI>Havana,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> were busie in Tilling their Lands, he return'd to his old Station; where ne∣vertheless their Endeavors to repair what was ruin'd, had been in vain, by reason of the scarcity of Provisions, and want of other Necessaries, had not in their greatest extremity some <HI>Netherland</HI> Vessels arriving there, furnish'd them with Provisions, Clothes, and other Necessaries, on bare promises of payment: But not long after growing rich with Tobacco, Sugars, Ginger, and Indigo, they made Satisfaction to all their Creditors, and at last attain'd to the Condition before mention'd.</P>

Nor hath this Island of late Years been much frequented, only in the Year 1601. Captain <HI>Parker</HI> with a Fleet of <HI>English</HI> put on Shore here, and took as many Prisoners as he had five hundred pounds of Pearl for the Ransom of, and at his coming away took a Ship he met from off the Coast of <HI>Angola,</HI> with three hundred and seventy <HI>Negro's</HI> aboard her, who were going to be sold for Slaves.</P>
<P>The Soil is not unfruitful, bringing forth several sorts of Fruit, and store of
<PB N="388" REF="252"/><HI>Maiz,</HI> and probably if improv'd, would as well bear Wheat, and other usual kinds of Grain; but there is great want of Water, which the Inhabitants are troubled to fetch from the neighboring Continent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns and Places of chief note.</NOTE>The Places of chief note, are 1. <HI>Monpater,</HI> a Fort built by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in a Nook of the Island, lying Eastward to secure the Pearl-fishing Trade, and to defend the Town where the Governor resides, as also the Treasurer of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Cu∣stoms of Pearl, which have been formerly valu'd at 50000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly.</P>

This is also a very great Place for Pearl-fishing, the benefit whereof hath been so considerable, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Fifths are said to have amounted some years to fifteen thousand <HI>Ducats;</HI> but otherwise of a poor and barren Soil, not onely de∣stitute of Water, but of Fruit, Grain, Herbage, and all manner of Cattel and eata∣ble Beasts, except a few lean Coneys; nevertheless, in respect of the Pearl-fishing Trade, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have Planted here a Colony, which they call'd <HI>New Cadiz,</HI> ha∣ving plenty of Provisions brought them from the adjoining Coasts, and soon after their first Planting grew in a short time so powerful, that they became Masters of one of the best Ports of those Seas, call'd <HI>Maracapana Venezuela;</HI> but upon an Alarm of the Salvages of <HI>Cumana,</HI> for a while deserted the Island, and betook themselves to <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> from whence nevertheless being remanded back with fresh Supplies, under the Command of <HI>James de Castellon,</HI> they soon re-instated themselves in their former Plantation, and made it more strong and flourishing than before; in which state they remain'd as long as the Pearl-fishing Trade continu'd, but that decaying, the splendor also of this Colony declin'd: so that at present the onely thing which makes the Place remarkable, is a Fountain on the East part of the Island, not far from the Sea, yielding a liquid bituminous Water, of singular use in Medicine, and sometimes found floating on the Sea at two or three Leagues distance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island <HI>Coche.</HI></NOTE>About four Leagues distant from <HI>Cubagua</HI> there is an Island call'd <HI>Coche,</HI> about three Miles in compass; It was discover'd in the Year 1529. and was formerly lit∣tle less considerable for Pearl-fishing than the other two.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of <HI>Trinidado.</HI></NOTE>THe Island of <HI>Trinidado</HI> was first discover'd by <HI>Columbus, Anno</HI> 1447. in his third Voyage, and by him so call'd, as some guess, from its three Points or Promontories; but that seems not so probable, in regard it is otherwise call'd <HI>La Trinidad,</HI> or <HI>Insula Sanctae Trinitatis,</HI> and therefore is likely to have been de∣nominated upon a religious Account: It lieth nine Degrees or thereabouts distant from the <HI>Line,</HI> at the Mouth of the River <HI>Orenoque,</HI> and is separated from the Coast
<PB N="389" REF="252"/>of <HI>Paria,</HI> over against which it lies by a <HI>Straight</HI> that is three Miles over, and which for the dangerousness of passing it, <HI>Columbus,</HI> the first Discoverer of it, call'd <HI>Bocca del Draco;</HI> the length thereof from the most Southern Angle call'd <HI>Punta del Andrada,</HI> to the North-East, call'd <HI>Punta del Galera,</HI> is reckon'd twenty five Leagues, (those that reckon fifty, may be suppos'd to mistake Leagues for Miles) and the breadth about eighteen.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chief Com∣modities of the Island.</NOTE>The Air of this Place is so impure, that it is accounted the unwholsomest Island of all the <HI>Indies;</HI> nevertheless the Soil is not unfertile, as bringing forth Sugar-Canes, Cotton, <HI>Maize,</HI> Tobacco of the best kind, with other Commodities of the general growth of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> besides store of good Fruit and Cattel; and one part of the Island call'd <HI>Terra de Bea,</HI> produceth great plenty of Pitch, but not of the best kind; and there have been discover'd several Veins of Gold and other Metals.</P>
<P>The Natives, some say, were antiently call'd <HI>Cairi,</HI> or <HI>Carai,</HI> and were distinguish'd into several <HI>Clans</HI> or Tribes, each under the Government of a <HI>Casique,</HI> or petty Prince; but most of them dreading the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Cruelty, deserted the Island, and Setled themselves in <HI>Guiana;</HI> and at present both this Place, <HI>Guiana,</HI> and <HI>El Dorado,</HI> have of Custom one and the same Governor, whose Place of Residence here is <HI>St. Josephs,</HI> the chief, if not onely Town of the Island; it stands Southward upon the <HI>Carone.</HI> Here most of that Tobacco is made, which is sold amongst us for <HI>Spanish.</HI> In the Year 1595. Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> possess'd himself of it, being then but a petty Village of about forty Houses, and took Prisoner the then Governor <HI>Antonio Berreo,</HI> who, in all probability, to ingratiate himself with him, gave him some light towards the discovery of <HI>Guiana.</HI></P>
<P>On the North-East of <HI>Trinidado,</HI> and not above eight Miles distant from it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tabago.</NOTE> lies the Island of <HI>Tabago,</HI> which hath been already treated of, as one of the <HI>Caribbees,</HI> though some will have it one of the <HI>Sotavento;</HI> it is otherwise call'd <HI>New Walcheren,</HI> from a Town of that Name in <HI>Zealand,</HI> from whence a Colony of <HI>Netherlanders</HI> was sent to Plant it.</P>
<P>Amongst others of the small obscure Islands hereabouts, is <HI>Virgin Gorda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Virgin Gorda.</NOTE> which is sometimes reckon'd amongst the <HI>Caribbee</HI> Islands; but since there is nothing consi∣derable to be spoken of it, it is sufficient that it hath been mention'd, though not punctually in its proper place.</P>

As for the Island it self, it is at present little, if at all inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> whether it be that they want Men to furnish new Plantations, or that they find no matter of invitation and encou∣ragement from the Countrey, or perhaps that the access thither be not so easie: for 'tis reported to be wonderfully well peopled by the Natives, and that there were found onely upon the Coasts and along the Shore of <HI>Mar Vermiglio,</HI> twenty or twenty three Nations, all of different Languages; though from the particular Narrations that have been made of the Voyages of several eminent Persons into these Parts, it appears that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have taken great pains in the discovery thereof, and also from the several <HI>Spanish</HI> Names of Places, that they have had Plantations here for∣merly, however neglected at present.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Customs and Manners of the Na∣tives.</NOTE>The Countrey is abundantly well stor'd with Fish and Fowl, as appears partly by the Natives, who take a huge pride in making themselves gay with the Bones of the one, with which they load their Ears, and sometimes their Noses also; and with the Feathers of the other, which ordinary People wear onely sticking about their Wastes; but Great Persons, and such as will be fine indeed, beset their Heads strangely with them, and have commonly one Bunch of them bigger than ordi∣nary hanging down behind them like a Tail.</P>
<P>Having no knowledge of the true God, they worship what the Devil will have them, that is, the Sun, attributing to it onely the increase of their Plants, healthful Seasons, and most of the other good things they enjoy, or are sensible of.</P>

<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Ri∣vers thereof.</NOTE>1. <HI>Orellana,</HI> so call'd from the first Discovery thereof by <HI>Franciscus de Orellana,</HI> otherwise the River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> from a Generation of warlike Women, who (as the Tradition goes) inhabited certain Countreys lying upon the Banks thereof. This

<P N="2">2. <HI>Orenoque,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Raliana,</HI> from Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> who endeavor'd to discover it, a River of the Province of <HI>Guiana,</HI> whose Head or Spring is not yet dis∣cover'd: It is said to be Navigable a thousand Miles together by the tallest Ships, and no less than two thousand by Pinnaces and smaller Vessels, and dischargeth it self likewise into the North Sea by sixteen several Channels or Mouths, making thereby several Islands; some whereof are said to be of good bigness, and to lie at a distance of a hundred Miles or more one from the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Maragnon,</HI> a River of a yet larger Course than any of the former, being, as 'tis said, no less than six thousand Miles from its Head, which is out of the <HI>Andes</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> to its Fall, which is likewise into the North Sea about <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> by a Chan∣nel of seventy Leagues in breadth.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Paraguay,</HI> a River of two thousand Miles Course, and falling as the rest into the North Sea, by a Channel of threescore Miles over, and about thirty Degrees Southward of the <HI>Line,</HI> towards the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellane.</HI></P>

<P>Some divide <HI>Southern America</HI> into <HI>Peruviana</HI> and <HI>Brasiliana: Peruviana</HI> they sub∣divide into <HI>Terra Firma</HI> and <HI>Peru; Brasiliana</HI> into <HI>Brasile</HI> and <HI>Paraguay:</HI> But the most receiv'd and commodious Division is into these particular Provinces following, all of them wealthy and large, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Castella Aurea,</HI> or <HI>Golden Castile.</HI> 2. <HI>Nova Granada,</HI> or <HI>The New Kingdom,</HI> as they call it. 3. <HI>Peru,</HI> specially so call'd. 4. <HI>Chile.</HI> 5. <HI>Para∣guay.</HI> 6. <HI>Brasile.</HI> 7. <HI>Guiana.</HI> 8.

It lieth almost under the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI> but a few Degrees Northward of it, and therefore somewhat hot, and by the neighborhood of both Seas subject to a foggy and gross Air, in comparison of some other parts; so that it is not counted generally so healthful a Countrey, especially for Strangers, and in Summer-time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The antient Division of <HI>Panama.</HI></NOTE>The antient Division of <HI>Panama,</HI> according to the Lordships of the <HI>Casiques</HI> that then Govern'd, were these following: <HI>Careta, Aila, Comagre, Chiam, Coyba, Chame, Chiru, Nata, Tobre, Trota, Haylia, Burica,</HI> and <HI>Escotia,</HI> where the South Sea with the Spring-Tides flowing over the Plains, at its return being hardned by the Sea, is turn'd into Salt; but as it hath always hapned in all other Countreys of the World, that with the alteration of Government, the Division, of the Countrey, and the Names of Places have totally chang'd, so also here the antient Division of Regions and Territories must give place to the Modern.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature and Customs of the antient Inhabitants.</NOTE>The antient Inhabitants of these Parts were a very warlike People, the Women always accompanying their Husbands in the Wars. They us'd to hang on the tops of their Standards the Bones of their greatest Heroes, thereby to animate their Sol∣diers. Their Arms consisted of poysonous Arrows, Stone Swords, and Pikes made of the Palm-Trees. They also carried with them the Idol <HI>Chiapa,</HI> to whom they Offer'd living Children at the beginning of their Wars, and afterwards making Merry with the Flesh, anointed the Image with the Blood: Moreover, if they re∣turn'd home Conquerors, they spent several days in all manner of Debaucheries, as Drinking, Singing, Dancing, Cutting their Prisoners Throats, with their Blood also anointing their Image. But if they were conquer'd, then they invented new Offerings to reconcile themselves with their Idol.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns and Places of chief note.</NOTE>The chief Towns and Places which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> inhabit here, are 1. <HI>Panama,</HI>
<PB N="396" REF="256"/>the chief City of the Province, being also a Bishop's See, which is Suffragan to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Lima,</HI> and the ordinary Residence of the Governor and Courts of Justice for these Parts: It is seated likewise upon the South Sea, and so near, that at High-water the Ships are said to Ride even under the Walls. Through this Town the Wealth both of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> passeth once every Year; from <HI>Spain</HI> by <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> from whence whatsoever Merchandise or other Commodi∣ties come from <HI>Spain,</HI> are Transported to <HI>Panama</HI> by Land, and from thence by Sea to all the Parts of <HI>Peru;</HI> and by <HI>Panama</HI> whatsoever comes from <HI>Peru,</HI> is sent into <HI>Spain:</HI> It hath commonly a strong Garrison of Soldiers in it, and is doubtless a Place otherwise well fortifi'd, being of so great importance. From the Haven <HI>Pericos</HI> three Ways lead to <HI>Panama,</HI> the first along a Bridge over a River, whose Banks are great Fortifications to the City, the rather because the River is deep, and next it a Pool over-grown with Weeds. The Way from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> plain and without Woods, is wash'd by the Brook <HI>Levendero.</HI> The third runs along over a Stone Bridge and Champain Grounds, that extend from the Haven <HI>Pericos</HI> to the City. Eastward from <HI>Panama</HI> appear seven Royal Houses on a Rock, wherein the Courts of Judicature are kept. Five hundred Rods into the Sea lies an Island re∣sembling a Half-Moon, and the Haven wherein the Ships when they unlade cast Anchor, there being else not Water enough for laden Barques, and all lie dry the Tide being out: At the Mouth thereof stands a woodden Sconce. The Places <HI>Venta de Cruze, Chagre, Quebrada,</HI> and <HI>Ballano,</HI> are also fortifi'd against any Invasion, where else an Enemy might easily Land: But the strictest Watch is kept at the River <HI>Chagre,</HI> which Westward below <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> falling into the Northern Ocean, brings the Ships up to <HI>Venta de Cruze,</HI> from whence a Way scarce five Leagues long leads to <HI>Panama.</HI> The <HI>Spanish</HI> Commodities consisting most in Meal, Oyl, Biskets, Cloth and Silk, are all brought from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> along the same Way; or else in Winter when they cannot stem the Current of the River <HI>Chagre,</HI> then they bring their Goods by Land, not without great danger of being taken by the run-away <HI>Negro's,</HI> who set upon them out of the Woods with poyson'd Darts and Arrows; and as many <HI>Spaniards</HI> as they take, so many several ways they put them to death, because they formerly in the time of their Servitude were us'd with all imaginable Cruelties. The Provisions sold here at a reasonable Rate are <HI>Maiz, Peruan</HI>-Meal, Poultrey, Honey, Cattel, Swine, Oranges, Lemmons, Cabbage, and all manner of Garden Herbs or Plants. Round about the fore-mention'd Royal Houses lie Bul∣warks, with a strong Castle on one side. A fair Cathedral denotes the Place to be a Bishop's See: And the <HI>Franciscans, Dominicans,</HI> and Monks of the Order <HI>De la Merced,</HI> inhabit several fair Cloysters here. Two Leagues Westward is the Haven <HI>Pericos,</HI> which being secur'd from all Winds by three high Isles that lie before it, is the chief Harbor in which the <HI>Peruan</HI> Plate-Fleet (consisting most in small Barques) comes to an Anchor before they touch at <HI>Panama.</HI> The Countrey is for the most part Mountainous, and in many places sends forth stinking Damps out of muddy Pools; yet in some places are <HI>Savanna</HI> Grounds for Cattel to Graze in. The Air would also be more unhealthful, if it were not clear'd by the Winds which blow from the Sea. From <HI>July</HI> to <HI>October</HI> there fall continual Rains, mix'd with terrible claps of Thunder. The Inhabitants often recreate themselves in Hunting wild Hogs, with Nets made of the Brambles call'd <HI>Nequen</HI> or <HI>Henachen,</HI> and that after a strange manner: for they set on fire the Bushes all about the place where they sup∣pose the Game to lie, which to shun the Fire runs into their Nets; so that the same Bushes are both their shelter and destruction, as affording Material to make the Nets wherein they are taken. Besides other Birds the Woods also abound with
<PB N="397" REF="256"/>Pheasants and Turtle-Doves; and amongst Beasts, those that carry their Young about them in a Bag, as also wild Cats. The Sea abounds with Fish, and produces Crocodiles of a large size, by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call'd <HI>Lagartos.</HI> The Trees are seldom without Leaves, but bear little or no Fruit.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> which hath broad Streets, high woodden Houses, and a fair Church: It extends from East to West along the Northern Ocean, in the middle of a great Wood on Moorish Ground, having a great Fen on the West; being situ∣ate under an unwholsom Climate, it hath occasion'd the death of many People. The Merchants which dwelt here had also Habitations in <HI>Panama,</HI> (the rest of the Houses being most of them Inns for Strangers) from whence as soon as they had gotten an Estate they went to <HI>Spain.</HI> The Countrey round about lies under Water in many places. The Oranges, <HI>Cassada</HI>-Roots, and the like, which grow here, oc∣casion many Distempers to those that eat of them. In the Harbor, which hath on each side a Ridge of Rocks, on which lies decay'd Forts, the Sea is often-times so turbulent, that the Ships are forc'd to Ride at six Anchors apiece. Eastward from the City a fresh-Water River falls into the Haven, on whose Banks stand seve∣ral Garden-Houses and Orchards. <HI>Anno</HI> 1595. Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> arriving here, found a Mill beyond the City; not far from which on a Hill stood a Watch-house, of which having made himself Master, he set fire on the Town <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> as also on all the Vessels that were in the Harbor. The original of the Name <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> was on this occasion, <HI>viz. Diego Niquesa</HI> setting Sail with three Ships out of the Haven <HI>Carthagena</HI> to the Golden Countrey <HI>Veragua,</HI> was surpris'd by a violent Storm, in which two Ketches, Commanded by <HI>Lupus de Olano</HI> and <HI>Peter Umbria</HI> were driven out of sight, whilest he suffer'd shipwrack, and getting ashore, rang'd up and down in a desolate Countrey, where he found no other Food but Roots, till at last he met with <HI>Olano;</HI> when the Famine began to increase amongst them in such a nature, that being scarce able to carry their Arms, many of them were kill'd by the Inhabitants with poyson'd Arrows, insomuch that of seven hundred there remain'd scarce ninety: <HI>Niquesa</HI> shipp'd as many of them in a new Vessel which they had made as it could possibly carry, and promis'd to fetch the rest off from <HI>Veragua</HI> as soon as he had discover'd a Place fit to be inhabited: The first Place he Landed at was <HI>Puerto Bello;</HI> from whence being necessitated by the <HI>Indians</HI> who gather'd toge∣ther to Retreat Aboard, not without the loss of several Men, he set Sail to the Pro∣montory <HI>Mormor,</HI> beyond which he Anchor'd in a secure Haven; where, as he was going ashore he call'd to his Men, saying, <HI>Saltiamo in tierra al Nombre de Dios,</HI> that is, <HI>Let us Land in the Name of God,</HI> and casting up a Fort against the Assaults of the Na∣tives, call'd it <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>St. Philip,</HI> or <HI>Puerto Bello,</HI> so denominated by <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> from its Haven lying along the North Sea, wonderful convenient and secure, by reason of the good Ground for Anchoring, and a Creek in the same, defended from all sorts of Winds; and which being surrounded with Woods, hath much over-flow'd Land about it, as also abundance of good Gravel for Ballast; for which and several other Reasons, the famous Architect <HI>Baptista Antonelli</HI> advis'd the <HI>Spanish</HI> King, to build this City for a Staple of Trade (in stead of <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> which was found unhealthy) having pitch'd upon an excellent Situation for it, <HI>viz.</HI> on a Plain at the Foot of a Hill, where there are three fresh Rivulets, meeting with a fruitful and hot Countrey: wherefore his Advice being taken, they first built a Fort at the Mouth of the Haven, put five Guns into the same to defend the new City, and on the Shore a strong Tower with eight Drakes: Moreover, the Rocks along the Shore, and close Woods about the Haven prevent the Landing of an Enemy: But at
<PB N="398" REF="257"/>the very time that this City was just begun to be built, Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> having burnt <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> ran into the Haven <HI>Puerto Bello,</HI> where he found ten Houses, besides the Governors Palace, and a Castle whose Breast-works which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had lately rais'd of Timber, Stone, and Earth, were all demolish'd by the <HI>English:</HI> But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have since re-built the same, and fortifi'd the Haven, with two strong Castles, notwithstanding in the Year 1661. it was surpriz'd and taken by the <HI>English</HI> under the Command of Captain <HI>Parker,</HI> and the Governor <HI>Petro Melendez</HI> taken Prisoner.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Nata,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>St. Jago de Nata,</HI> situated on the West side of this Pro∣vince, upon <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> or <HI>The South Sea,</HI> about thirty Leagues distant from <HI>Panama,</HI> towards the Borders of <HI>Veragua.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Acla,</HI> a Town upon the same Coast, but lying South-East of <HI>Nombre de Dios:</HI> It was at first onely a Fort built by <HI>Peter de Arias,</HI> but afterwards grew up into a small City, of which at present there is nothing remaining but the remembrance of the famous <HI>Vasquez Nunnez,</HI> Beheaded by his Father-in-law <HI>Arias.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly, <HI>La Crux Real,</HI> a few Leagues distant from <HI>Panama,</HI> for the most part inhabited by a sort of <HI>Negro's</HI> call'd <HI>Simmerones.</HI></P>
<P>Along the North Coast of <HI>Panama</HI> are two small woody Islands call'd <HI>Cattiva</HI> and <HI>Comagre,</HI> lying low in the Water; also the Isle <HI>De Pines,</HI> which rises high out of the Sea near the Main Land.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Isles of Pearls.</NOTE>On the Southern Coast are <HI>Isole de las Perlas,</HI> or <HI>The Isles of Pearls,</HI> about twenty five in number, but indeed rather Rocks than Islands, excepting two, <HI>viz. Taroreque</HI> and <HI>Del Rios</HI> where in former times the <HI>Indians</HI> took great store of Pearls, by diving for them to the bottom of the Sea; and they were esteem'd of greater value and ex∣cellence than those of <HI>Cubagua,</HI> and great profit was made of them by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> till by their Cruelties exercis'd upon the Natives through excessive greediness, they depopulated the Islands, and lost that altogether of which before they were so in∣satiable: they are now onely inhabited by a few <HI>Moors</HI> and other Slaves, who keep Cattel there for their Masters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain <HI>Ox∣enham</HI>'s Ex∣pedition.</NOTE>It will not seem amiss to conclude our Description of <HI>Panama</HI> with a short Ac∣count of the <HI>English</HI> Captain <HI>John Oxenham</HI>'s Exploits in these Parts: He being in∣cited by the Treasure which Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> fetch'd from hence, resolv'd to Steer for the Northern Coast of <HI>Panama,</HI> where he hal'd his Ship of a hundred and twenty Tun on Shore, and cover'd the same with Trees, buried his Guns, and march'd with two Field-Pieces and seven Men up into the Countrey, and was by the <HI>Indians</HI> conducted to a River which falls into the South Sea, where he built a Pinnace of forty five Foot long, and Sailing into the South Sea, Landed on <HI>Tararequi,</HI> one of the Islands of <HI>Pearls;</HI> where he soon after took a <HI>Peruan</HI> Barque with sixty thousand pieces of Gold, store of Wine and Bread, and the day following another which came from <HI>Lima,</HI> loaden with a hundred thousand Pound in Silver Bars, and some Pearls; with which being enrich'd he return'd to the Main: The Governor of <HI>Panama</HI> being inform'd of it, put a hundred Soldiers into four Barques, besides a considerable number of <HI>Negro</HI> Slaves; over which <HI>Juan de Ortego</HI> having the chief Command, was inform'd at <HI>Tararequi</HI> what Course the <HI>English</HI> had steer'd; where∣upon he pursu'd them to the River whither they were gone, which falling with three Arms into the Sea, they could not have known which way the <HI>English</HI> went, unless they had seen some Feathers of Fowls driving in the Mouth of the least Branch, by which they judg'd that they were not far off; therefore Rowing up they found after four days Journey the Pinnace hal'd on Shore, and watch'd by six Men, who were order'd to stand Sentinel, whereof one being shot by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
<PB N="399" REF="257"/>the other five fled; whom <HI>Ortega</HI> pursuing, found half a League from the Shore a Hut made of Boughs, wherein the Booty lay, which he speedily carried to his Barques; but Captain <HI>Oxenham</HI> inform'd hereof, fell with two hundred <HI>Indians</HI> up-the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who having a Wood on their Backs made such advantage thereof, that eleven <HI>English</HI> were slain, and seven taken, and had not the rest fled, they had all been either kill'd or taken Prisoners: Those that were taken inform'd <HI>Ortega</HI> that they had been at difference amongst themselves about dividing the Booty, which was the reason of their staying so long: moreover, they discover'd where and how their Ship lay; all which the Governor of <HI>Panama</HI> writ to <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI> from whence four Sail were immediately sent to find out the Ship and the buried Guns, as also to take all such <HI>English</HI> as they should find preparing of Boats or Barques, and bring them to <HI>Panama;</HI> whereupon very many were taken, who were all mise∣rably slain, except a few Youths.</P>

It is for the most part a Mountain∣ous Countrey, and full of Woods, which they say yield abundance of Rozen, Gums, and some very good Balsams; also a sort of Long-pepper, much sharper than that of <HI>East-India.</HI> But the Plains, by reason of much Rain, to which the Countrey is subject, especially for some times of the year, of but a spewy and cold Soil. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> at their first coming found it a rich Countrey, not so much from the Na∣ture and Profits of the Soil (though it be said to have some Mines in it, and those of Gold) but by reason of a certain Opinion and Respect, which the <HI>Americans</HI> of these Parts are generally said to have born towards this Countrey, insomuch that they would be brought and buried there from other Places very remote; and accord∣ding to the Custom of the Countrey, not without good store of Gold and other Jewels, according to the Quality and Condition of the Person that was buried; of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> soon gain'd Intelligence, and in ransacking the Graves and Monuments of the Dead, are suppos'd to have found an infinite Mass of Treasure: but those Mines are long since exhausted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature and Customs of the antient Inhabitians.</NOTE>The Inhabitants of old suffer'd great prejudice by Tygers and Serpents; yet nevertheless this Countrey was very populous before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> arrival here; the Natives wore Cotton Aprons before, and Golden Rings about their Arms and Legs, as also Strings of Pearl, and the like. The Women here, as in the rest of these Parts, went with their Husbands into the Wars, and behav'd themselves valiantly, shooting poyson'd Arrows, insomuch that <HI>Martin Ambesus</HI> took a Maid, <HI>Anno</HI> 1509. who had kill'd twenty eight <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coun∣trey <HI>Ʋrraba.</HI></NOTE>To the Province <HI>Carthagena</HI> belongs also the Countrey <HI>Urraba,</HI> which is so fruit∣ful, that all kind of <HI>Spanish</HI> Trees and Seeds grow better here than in <HI>Spain:</HI> Besides which it hath its own Fruit, as also abundance of Pine and Palm-Trees, whose Leaves serve for Brooms. The <HI>Guaiana</HI>-Tree bears a sharp kind of Fruit like a Lemmon, the <HI>Guaravana</HI> a kind of Cittrons, the <HI>Mameisa</HI> a Fruit not unlike an Orange, but tasting like a Melon, and the <HI>Hovos</HI> a great Plum.</P>
<P>Their Gardens abound with the Root <HI>Batata,</HI> whose Leaves send forth several Strings, which over-spreading the Ground fasten in the Earth, and take new Roots; it is yellow without, and whitish within, and bears pale green Flowers, which at last turn to a Cod full of Seed.

<P>The Trees likewise swarm with Birds; and especially near Lakes or Pools breed Pheasants and Parrots, of which some are bigger than Capons, others no bigger than Chickens.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moun∣tain <HI>Abibe.</HI></NOTE>Against <HI>Urraba</HI> juts the Mountain <HI>Abibe,</HI> whose length Westward remains un∣known; the breadth thereof in some places is about twenty Leagues; it hath many Ways which cannot be travell'd with Horses. The top of this Mountain is uninhabited; but along the Valleys, which are many and large, dwelt formerly a People that possess'd great Riches in Gold, which they gather'd out of Rivulets that fell Westward from the tops of the Mountains. It Rains here almost all the year long, which makes the Ways very bad for Travellers to pass.</P>
<P>At the Foot of this Mountain, towards the South, lie two small antient Casique∣doms, if we may so call them, formerly inhabited by a valiant People, call'd <HI>Tarabe de Zenu,</HI> whether chiefly the dead Bodies were brought from all the adjacent Countreys, to be buried in great State, as hath been before intimated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns and Places of principal note.</NOTE>The principal Towns and Places of note are 1. <HI>Charthagena,</HI> (so call'd either from the resemblance of its Situation with the City <HI>Carthagena</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Murcia</HI> belonging to <HI>Old Spain,</HI> or because the first Inhabitants were Citizens of the said City) which was begun to be built <HI>Anno</HI> 1532. by <HI>Peter de Heredia,</HI> but fully fini∣shed by <HI>Georgio Robledo,</HI> eight years after the first Foundation thereof was laid. This Episcopal Metropolis is on the North wash'd by the North Sea over a plain shallow Ground; on the Land side the Sea flows through a narrow Bay by the City towards the Lake <HI>Canupote,</HI> which ebbs and flows equal with the Ocean, and receives and discharges its Water through two Pipes which lie under along Bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption of <HI>Car∣thagena.</HI></NOTE> joyning <HI>Carthagena</HI> to the Main Coast. This City boasted long since above five hundred Stone Houses, being divided into twenty six large Streets, whereof four are six hundred and twenty Paces long: behind each House is a Garden; and the Church appears above all the other Buildings: The <HI>Dominicans</HI> Cloyster is also fairly built; neither is the <HI>Franciscans</HI> inferior to it, who also possess a second Edi∣fice on the Main Continent over the Bridge. The Custom-house and Court where the Courts for the whole Province of <HI>Carthagena</HI> art kept, are also stately Structures. The Haven hath two Entrances, the chiefest whereof lies half a League Eastward from the City, and the Western, call'd <HI>La Boca,</HI> is as far again; both very dange∣rous, because of the many blind Rocks that lie before them. <HI>Anno</HI> 1585. when Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> took <HI>Carthagena</HI> by Storm, the whole was fortifi'd with Sconces, be∣sides two Forts for the better security thereof, whereof one lock'd up the narrow Mouth of the Haven with a strong Chain; not far from which stood an Abbey, Dedicated to the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> and Wall'd round about; since which they have se∣veral Out-works, Forts and Towers, to prevent all foreign Invasions. The City grows wealthy daily by the <HI>Peruan</HI> Plate-Fleet putting in there before they go to <HI>Spain,</HI> and especially by the Trade from <HI>New Granada</HI> along the River <HI>Magdalena.</HI> The Island before the Haven, antiently call'd <HI>Codega,</HI> now <HI>Carex,</HI> inhabited by Fisher-men when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Landed there, is now desolate, the remainder of those that were destroy'd by them being fled to wild places from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Cru∣elties; notwithstanding the People hereabouts were valiant enough to Engage with them. But since the Devastation made by Sir <HI>Francis Drake, Carthagena</HI> hath
<PB N="402" REF="261"/>receiv'd a more fatal Blow; for it was scarce fully repair'd, when five <HI>French</HI> Pri∣vateers burnt the City to Ashes: which Mischief was occasion'd by a <HI>Spanish</HI> Sea∣man, who being whipt by Command of the Governor, resolving for Revenge, went from <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and conducted the fore-mention'd Ships to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> where he reveng'd himself on the Governor; for finding him asleep, he first wak'd him, and after having told him of his causing him to be Whipt, he kill'd him. The Booty which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> carried from thence at that time amounted to above a hundred and fifty thousand <HI>Ducats.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Balsam of <HI>Tolu</HI> very famous.</NOTE>2. <HI>Tolu,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> now call'd <HI>St. Jago,</HI> twelve Leagues distant from <HI>Car∣thagena,</HI> a Place memorable for the excellent Balsam which is brought from thence, and commonly call'd <HI>The Balsam of Tolu;</HI> it is gather'd in a Spoonful of black Wax, stuck under the Hole cut in the Bark of a low Pine-Tree, out of which in hot Weather runs a Golden colour'd Gum, very soveraign, and of an excellent smell.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>St. Crux de Mopox,</HI> a neat Town, seated a little above the confluence of the two Rivers, <HI>St. Martha</HI> and <HI>Magdalena,</HI> which waters this Province.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers of <HI>Carthagena.</HI></NOTE>The Province of <HI>Carthagena</HI> is stor'd with many Brooks and great Rivers, amongst which the Stream <HI>Cauca</HI> falls into the River <HI>Magdalena,</HI> beyond <HI>Popayan</HI> near <HI>Mopox.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Zenu,</HI> which gives Denomination to the above-mention'd Ter∣ritory, makes a very convenient Harbor with its Mouth, where much Salt is to be had.</P>
<P>The <HI>Daria,</HI> which runs between <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Carthagena</HI> into the Inlet <HI>Urraba,</HI> gives its Denomination to the foregoing Province, through which it also runs, as hath been already mention'd.</P>
<P>The River which for its greatness is call'd <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> or <HI>Magdalena,</HI> (because it was discover'd on the Day Consecrated to that Saint) falls with such force into the Northern Ocean, about twenty three Leagues Eastward from <HI>Carthagena,</HI> that run∣ning two Leagues broad and ten long into the Sea, it retains its freshness of Water; in which there lying many Rocks, makes the same very dangerous for Ships. In the Mouth of the Haven lies an Island, which is divided by the River, the widest and most frequented Channel of which respects <HI>St. Martha,</HI> where those that carry the Merchandise up this Stream to <HI>New Granada,</HI> spend two Moneths in Toeing, when∣as they come from thence in three Weeks.</P>
<P>Thunder and Lightning rages here many times after a terrible manner from Midnight till Morning. In <HI>January</HI> there falls also abundance of Rain, which gli∣ding from the Mountains swells the River exceedingly.</P>

<P>This Countrey was Discover'd, and part of it Planted, <HI>Anna</HI> 1524. by <HI>Roderic de Bastredas,</HI> who afterwards was murder'd in his Sleep by his own People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the Cli∣mate, and Commodi∣ties of the Countrey.</NOTE>The Sun shines so exceeding hot near the Sea-coast, that there is no enduring of the same; but up in the Countrey the snowy Mountains occasion great Cold, and in Harvest and <HI>October</HI> it Rains exceedingly, whereas at other times it is very dry Wea∣ther, and the Winds blow generally out of the East or North-East, yet the Land-Breezes coming out of the West bring sometimes Rains with them. From the Mountains, which are stony and barren, fall many Brooks and Rivers, which wa∣ter divers Plains, the Grass and other Plants of which are often blasted by violent Storms; nevertheless Oranges, Lemmons, Granates, and all sorts of <HI>Spanish</HI> Garden Fruits grow here in great plenty. The Woods afford likewise Pigeons, Partridges, Venison, and the like; the Rivers all manner of Fish, which are seen to swim in great numbers twenty Yards under the Water, especially in the Haven <HI>St. Martha,</HI> near which formerly liv'd many Fisher men, who with Nets made of tough Twigs pleited together, caught such plenty of Fish, that they furnish'd all their Neighbors. The High-ways are made dangerous by Lyons, Tygers, and Bears.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great plenty of Precious Stones in these Parts.</NOTE>The Countrey <HI>Buritaca</HI> affords the Inhabitants Gold; <HI>Tairona,</HI> excellent Stones against Bleeding and the Gravel, Jasper, Porphyr, and Gold; the Valley <HI>Tunia,</HI> many rich Emeraulds, which Stones us'd to be in great esteem before <HI>America</HI> pro∣duc'd such great numbers of them. <HI>Acosta</HI> relates, That a <HI>Spaniard</HI> desiring to know the Price of an Emerauld, shew'd two to an <HI>Italian</HI> Jeweller, who valu'd the one at a hundred, the other at three hundred <HI>Ducats;</HI> but soon after seeing a Chest full of them, said they were scare worth a <HI>Ducat</HI> apiece; and that the Sute which the <HI>Roman</HI> Lady wore, being beset with Emeraulds, and valu'd at four hundred thousand <HI>Du∣cats,</HI> would not sell now for half so much. This Stone or Jewel exceedingly fortifies the Sight, wherefore the Emperor <HI>Nero</HI> represented the bloody Encounters of Fen∣cers in an Emerauld. It is also judg'd to be good against the Falling-sickness, wherefore the <HI>Indians</HI> hang them in their Noses to this day, and adorn their Idols with them; they grow in stony Rocks along Veins, not unlike Crystal, and in time obtain a glittering Greenness; the biggest of them that are found in this Age are most esteem'd of in <HI>Genua.</HI> The Emerauld Pillar, which as a wonderful Orna∣ment stood in <HI>Hercules</HI>'s Temple in the City of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> being very famous amongst the Antients, was without doubt no more than a green Stone; and perhaps of the same Material, was the Pillar erected by the <HI>Arabian</HI> King <HI>Miramamolines,</HI> in the Ca∣thedral at <HI>Corduba.</HI> But the great fame of these Emeraulds incited <HI>Gonzalvez Zimenes,</HI>

Here ordering his Brigan∣tines which were come up the River to cast their Anchors, he judg'd it convenient to stay all the Winter, because the swoln Rivers had drown'd the adjacent Coun∣trey. <HI>Ximenes</HI> observing that the <HI>Indians</HI> fetch'd Salt from the Sea-side, judg'd that the Countrey was inhabited, and therefore in fair Weather march'd up to the Mountain <HI>Opou,</HI> behind which he found a Countrey full of Salt-pools, which pro∣duc'd Cakes of Salt. And somewhat farther the Province Govern'd by the Casique <HI>Bogata,</HI> who at first resisting the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> was soon put to flight, when he heard the noise of the Guns.

The Men were of a good proportion; the Women also handsomer, and of a fairer Complexion than their Neighbors: Their Habit also consisted of black, white, and divers colour'd Cotton Cloaks, and some also had Bonnets of the same. The temperateness of the Climate makes little difference between Winter and Summer. Their Houses were of Planks, and cover'd with long Rushes. Their chiefest Food was <HI>Maiz</HI> and <HI>Cassave,</HI> which first grows on Stalks as large as Canes, containing very large and weighty Spikes or Ears, each Ear generally yielding seven hundred Grains, which are Planted in hot and moist Ground; one Bushel Sow'n, generally produces three hundred. But the <HI>Maiz</HI> is distinguish'd into a courser or finer sort, which last is call'd <HI>Moroche,</HI> the Leaves and Canes whereof afford a wholsom Provender for Horses, and the Corn, Bread for the Inhabitants, who make it several ways; for sometimes they boyl it in Water, and at other times parch it in Ashes, or grind it to Meal, which kneading in∣to Dough, they make into Cakes, Biskets, and the like: Moreover, <HI>Maiz</HI> steep'd in Water, and after being boyl'd and set a working, makes a very strong Liquor. They also use <HI>Cassada,</HI> which they make of the Root <HI>Yuca,</HI> which being large and thick, is cut in pieces, grated, and all its Juice, which is deadly poyson, being press'd out, is Bak'd in thin Cakes.

The <HI>Hill-Countrey</HI> is for a great space naked and open; the <HI>Plains</HI> in many places sandy and dry, and would be much more scorch'd with Heat than they are, but for the neighborhood of the Sea, which affords them many cooling Gales from the South and South-West Winds, whose property, al∣though it be natural in other parts to be tempestuous, to bring Rain and foul Wea∣ther, yet here there is nothing but Serenity and fair Sun-shine days all the year long, although these Winds blow almost without ceasing upon the Countrey, and no other at any time, whereas the <HI>Sierra,</HI> or <HI>Hill-Countreys</HI> have Wind from every Coast, and such as bringeth all sorts of Weather with it, Rain, Hail, Frost, Snow, great claps of Thunder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣ties of the Countrey.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Countrey affordeth not so much Cattel of the breed of <HI>Europe</HI> as some other Provinces of <HI>America;</HI> but in stead of Kine and Sheep, the Woods and Pastures are replenish'd with multitudes of the <HI>Vicugnes</HI> and <HI>Pacos,</HI> which are of no less Profit and Service. The <HI>Pacos</HI> here are said to be as big as some young Hei∣fers of two years old, bearing a Fleece like Sheep, and their Flesh no less pleasant than the Mutton of <HI>Europe.</HI> But the great Wealth of this Countrey lies out of sight in the bowels of the Earth, <HI>viz.</HI> in those rich and (as they may seem) inexhaustible Mines both of Gold and Silver, which, as 'tis well known, the Countrey of <HI>Peru</HI> affordeth more than any other Province of <HI>America</HI> besides. The <HI>Sierra</HI> opens into large Valleys, amongst the chiefest whereof are <HI>Xauxa, Andaguailas,</HI> and <HI>Yucay,</HI> all of them well inhabited and fruitful. Below <HI>Cusco</HI> the Mountains <HI>Andes</HI> and those of <HI>Sierra</HI> run a greater distance than elsewhere one from the other, leaving the great Plain <HI>Callao</HI> in the middle.

<P><HI>Iuca Garcilasso,</HI> Extracted from the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Kings, tells us concerning Plants, That
<PB N="414" REF="271"/><FIGURE>
</FIGURE> he saw a Raddish which a Man with both Arms could scarce embrace, and that under the shade of their Leaves, Horses might stand. But of all the <HI>Peruan</HI> Fruit the <HI>Cocoa</HI> is the crown, which grows on Trees of a Fathom long in hot and moist Grounds of the Valleys between <HI>Andes</HI> and <HI>Sierra;</HI> from whence it is carried to the Sea-Coast in long Baskets by Companies of three or four thousand at a time on the Backs of the Sheep <HI>Pacos.</HI> Before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> coming hither none might chew <HI>Cocoa</HI> without the Governor's leave: A handful thereof chew'd and suck'd in the Mouth, enables a Man to travel two days without any other Sustenance, and mix'd with burnt Bones or Chalk, it is accounted an excellent Dish; there is such extraordi∣nary plenty of them, that the Inhabitants spend yearly 90000 Baskets of the Leaves in Pottage. The <HI>Peruans</HI> also esteem <HI>Mamayes,</HI> a Fruit which grows round, not un∣like a Peach, with two Stones, hard Rinds, and a well-rellish'd Pulp within, which dipt in Sugar is a great Dainty; they grow for the most part in the Islands. The <HI>Guaiyavas</HI> bears a wholsom and delicious Fruit like a large Plumb. The <HI>Palto,</HI> a Tree with many Boughs, bears a Fruit resembling a Pear, having a hard Rind, and within the Pulp a great Stone. The Fruit which grows on the <HI>Annona</HI> hath out∣wardly the same shape, but white within, and hath many black Kernels, which taste very deliciously. The Fruit <HI>Andas,</HI> so call'd from the desolate <HI>Peruan</HI> Moun∣tains on which they grow, resemble the fore-mention'd <HI>Cocoa,</HI> but differ from the <HI>East-Indian,</HI> because they are full of hard shell'd Almonds, the like whereof grows on the Tree <HI>Cachapoyas,</HI> which are not inferior to any <HI>European</HI> Fruits that grow on Trees; in that part of <HI>Peru</HI> which hath its Name from that Fruit is the best sort, being ex∣ceedingly devour'd by Monkies, who plucking the <HI>Cachapoya</HI> Almonds from their Stalks, throw them on the Ground to break their prickly Shells, that so they may eat the Kernels without hurt. The <HI>Mille</HI>-Tree, being a sort of Grapes, furnishes with Wine. But the greatest benefit the Inhabitants receive is by their Sheep <HI>Pacos</HI> and <HI>Moromoros,</HI> which carry great Loads, and feed on what they find by the Way; their Flesh is good and wholsom, and being either Smoak'd or Salted, keeps good a considerable time; their Wool dress'd affords <HI>Cumbi,</HI> of which they make fine
<PB N="415" REF="271"/>Table-clothes and Tapestry, which on both sides is alike. The chiefest Weavers liv'd formerly at <HI>Copachica,</HI> near the great Lake <HI>Titicacu:</HI> They Dye their Wool with the Juice of boyl'd Herbs. It seems also strange to consider what Loads the fore∣mention'd Sheep carried, for besides all sorts of Merchandise, they convey'd the Silver from <HI>Potosi</HI> to <HI>Arica,</HI> a Way of sixty three Leagues; but in former times they brought it as far again to <HI>Arequipa;</HI> and though they carried two thousand Bars at a time, amounting to above thirty thousand <HI>Ducats,</HI> yet they had no other Guard but a few Herdsmen, who driving them slept with them in the Nights under the bare Skie, yet lost none of their Riches, but when the bald Sheep call'd <HI>Moromoros,</HI> being wearied with their Loads, standing still, stretch'd put their Necks, and looking on their Drivers; on a sudden ran up into the Mountains, by which means the Silver was oft-times lost, if they were not suddenly shot. The woolly Sheep <HI>Pacos</HI> have also strange Tricks, for they often fall down under their Loads, and cannot be got up again, but must be let alone till they rise of themselves. So soon as one of the Sheep hath gotten the Mange (which the <HI>Peruvians</HI> call <HI>Tecarache,</HI>) they bury them alive to prevent farther Infection.</P>

<P>Some Authors begin this <HI>Dynastie</HI> of the Kings of <HI>Peru</HI> in a very different manner, making <HI>Mango Capa</HI> to be the first thereof, and to have been Succeeded by his Son <HI>Chincaroca,</HI> which cannot but be the same with this <HI>Ingaroca</HI> here mention'd. <HI>Yaguar∣guoqu</HI> (that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Yaguarguoqu</HI> the second <HI>Inga.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Crier of Blood,</HI> because on a time being Commander, and taken Pri∣soner, out of vexation and exceeding grief he cried <HI>Blood</HI>) Succeeding him after his Death, rais'd the Family <HI>Aocaillipanaca,</HI> and was Succeeded by his eldest Son, the wealthy <HI>Viracocha Inga,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Viracocha In∣ga</HI> his great Riches.</NOTE> of whom, when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> conquer'd <HI>Peru,</HI> went a Re∣port, that great Riches lay buried in the Earth with him; wherefore <HI>Gonzalus Pi∣zarrus</HI> tortu'd the Natives after an inhumane manner, to know of them where the Grave of the said <HI>Inga</HI> was; at last obtaining his Desire, he digg'd for the Body, which he found so well Embalm'd, that it seem'd to live, but no Gold with it; wherefore <HI>Pizarrus</HI> deceiv'd in his expectation, burnt the Corps; the Ashes where∣of the <HI>Indians</HI> gathering in Urns, worshipp'd, though when he liv'd the Vulgar were much incens'd at him, for taking upon him the Name of <HI>Viracocha,</HI> who was their supream God and Creator of all things; but he pacifi'd them, saying, That <HI>Viracocha</HI> appearing to him in a Dream, had commanded him to take that Name up∣on him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Yupangui's</HI> Policy to gain an Opinion amongst the People.</NOTE>The fourth <HI>Inga,</HI> call'd <HI>Pachacuto Yupangui</HI> succeeded in the Throne after the Death of his eldest Brother, who was slain in a Field-Battel against the <HI>Changas,</HI> inhabiting the Valley <HI>Andaguailas,</HI> where the <HI>Peruan</HI> Army was utterly defeated, few of them onely escaping by flight; among whom was <HI>Yupangui,</HI> who perswaded the rest to a subtile Design, by alledging, That the Almighty Creator, angry at their Destru∣ction, had reveal'd many Secrets to him, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Creator in Heaven was call'd <HI>Viracocha Pachayachachie;</HI> That he resented it very ill; That whereas he for∣merly made Heaven, Sun, Moon, Stars, and Men, none worshipp'd him for it, but in stead of him they reverenc'd the Sun, Thunder, and the Earth, who had their Beings from him; That he would shew his Power against the victorious <HI>Changas</HI> by an unexpected Assistance of an invisible Army. This being believ'd of every one, stirr'd up the <HI>Peruans</HI> far and near, insomuch that in a short time a vast Army being rais'd, presented themselves to <HI>Yupangui,</HI> who made good use thereof; and also told them that <HI>Viracocha</HI> had decreed in Heaven, that he <HI>Yupangui</HI> should be his Vicegerent on Earth; which the Army believing, set the <HI>Peruan</HI> Crown which they had taken from his Father, on his Head: Thus promoted, he march'd against
<PB N="417" REF="272"/>the <HI>Changas,</HI> whom in a bloody Battel he conquer'd, and brought them all under his Obedience: Moreover, he made his Soldiers believe, that they were not the Con∣querors, but invisible Men, whom <HI>Viracocha</HI> had sent, and who could be seen by none but himself; and that after the Battel they were turn'd into Stones, which they must seek for. Whereupon they gathering a great number of Stones on the Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gross Super∣stition.</NOTE> <HI>Yupangui</HI> call'd them <HI>Pururancas,</HI> and order'd that they should be worshipp'd, and carried with them into the Field whensoe're they fought another Battel, hoping thereby to stir up his Soldiers to be couragious, who firmly believ'd, that with the visible Stones walk'd invisible Heroes that would certainly assist them. This Ima∣gination wrought so much, that <HI>Yupangui</HI>'s Army assur'd of Victory with the help of the Stones, went on undauntedly on all Designs, insomuch that being fear'd by all the adjacent People, he forc'd them all to submission. This <HI>Yupangui</HI> rais'd the Family <HI>Yuaupococa,</HI> and plac'd a great Golden Image call'd <HI>Indyllapa</HI> on a Golden Chariot, which since was religiously worshipp'd, and afterwards carried to <HI>Caxa∣malca,</HI> for a Ransom of the <HI>Peruvian</HI> King <HI>Attabaliba,</HI> whom the <HI>Spanish</HI> General <HI>Pizar∣rus</HI> kept Prisoner, and at last Strangled. The Councellor <HI>Polus</HI> opening <HI>Yupangui</HI>'s Grave, found the Body Embalm'd, and no way defaced, but the Eyes cover'd with thin Golden Plates, and on his Head appear'd the Scar of a Stone which had been thrown at him; and though the Body had lain eighty years in the Grave, yet it seem'd rather living than dead, being onely a little grey.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Riches of the <HI>Ingas.</HI></NOTE>No Prince ever possess'd so much Riches and Splendor as an <HI>Inga</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> each Countrey presenting him with what was most esteem'd amongst them; the <HI>Chiches</HI> bringing Sweet-woods; the <HI>Lucanas,</HI> strong Sedan-Carriers; the <HI>Chumbibilcas,</HI> brave Dancers; and so accordingly every Countrey provided him with what they best esteem'd, besides the usual Tributes which they paid.</P>
<P>Those which digg'd the Gold and Silver out of the Mines, had Meat, Drink,
<PB N="420" REF="274"/>and Clothing from the <HI>Inga,</HI> though at other times he enjoy'd the Labors of his Subjects for nothing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their several sorts of Tri∣bute from conquer'd Countreys.</NOTE>When at any time he conquer'd a Countrey by force of Arms, he made them pay three several sorts of Tribute; the first was bestow'd in religious Offices. Each <HI>Guaca</HI> or Chappel receiv'd also a Revenue from the late conquer'd Countreys, the Fruit of which serv'd for Offerings to their chief God <HI>Pachayachachu,</HI> the Sun, their Thunderer <HI>Chuquilla,</HI> and to the Souls of the Deceased, and for Food for the Priests. The Religion through the whole Realm agreed with that which was ob∣serv'd in <HI>Cusco.</HI> But the second Tribute fell to the <HI>Inga</HI>'s Family, or Relation and Soldiers. Those who Till'd the <HI>Inga</HI>'s Ground, Sung before him in Festival Clothes. That which could not be spent in the Court was laid up in Store-houses for ten years together, against a scarcity should happen. Aged People, Widows, and such as were decrepid, paid no Tribute. The third part was for the Poor, which had eve∣ry Year a piece of Ground allow'd them to make use of as they pleas'd. In unfruit∣ful Years they receiv'd an Allowance out of the Store-houses before mention'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Provi∣sion for the Poor.</NOTE>So likewise the Pasture, Meadows, and Arable Land was order'd for three se∣veral Uses, one third for religious Uses, a second for the <HI>Inga's,</HI> and the last for the Poor. The Sheep being shorn on a certain Day, yielded the Poor a certain quan∣tity of Wooll to make them Clothes. As soon as any Beast grew Mangy (which the <HI>Peruvians</HI> call'd <HI>Carache</HI>) they burnt them alive, so to prevent the spreading of it farther. Those that belong'd to the <HI>Inga</HI>'s Family, wore all Clothes made of the finest Wooll, and the coursest, call'd <HI>Tabasca,</HI> was distributed among the Vulgar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Indu∣stry.</NOTE>Besides this good Order of Government, it is wonderful to observe the <HI>Peruvians</HI> manner of Living, each learning from their Infancy not onely a Trade, but all things which they accounted necessary in House-keeping, as Weaving, Tilling of Land, building of Houses, and making of Tools requisite for both; so that they never made use of one another on any Account. Moreover, Master Artists, who work'd more for Pleasure than Gain, dwelt apart, being Silver-smiths, Painters, Musicians, and Dancers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Habits.</NOTE>Their Habits were heretofore of one fashion through the whole Realm, onely the Covering of their Head were several, by which the People of one Countrey were distinguish'd from the other, according to an inviolable Law made many Ages since; some therefore wore thin Caps, others broad Pleits, others little Hats, others round Bonnets, others woven Caps, and the like.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Post-Stages.</NOTE>Their Post-Stages, call'd <HI>Chasquis,</HI> were little Houses, each standing a League and a half from one another, wherein dwelt certain Officers, who with extraordinary speed convey'd the <HI>Inga</HI>'s Letters from one <HI>Chasquis</HI> to the other; after which man∣ner in two days time they convey'd a Letter a hundred Leagues. But since the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> conquer'd this Countrey, that Convenience was lost, till the tenth <HI>Peruvian</HI> Vice-Roy <HI>Martin Enriques</HI> re-establish'd the same; for he allow'd a Sallary to those Posts, that they might with speed convey all Letters and Packets from one to the other, being distant, according to his Establishment, four Leagues.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their severe Laws against Malefactors.</NOTE>Lastly, the <HI>Ingas</HI> maintain'd strict Laws in criminal Affairs; for as they did not neglect to encourage noble Atchievements (for whoe're had done a valiant Act in the Wars, was made Governor of a Countrey, or had a certain quantity of Land given him, or Married one of the <HI>Inga</HI>'s Family;) so likewise they severely punish'd all Malefactors: for Murderers, Thieves, and Adulterers suffer'd Death without Mercy; yet they allow'd store of Concubines, and it was free for any one to Lie with his Neighbor's Concubine, but Death to have to do with any Man's lawful Wife, who were serv'd by the Concubines.</P>
<PB N="421" REF="274"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Marri∣ages.</NOTE>When a Bridegroom Betrothed himself to his Bride, he gave her (and put them on himself) a pair of Shoes call'd <HI>Ajota,</HI> not unlike those of a grey Fryer, which were lin'd with Cotton if she were a Maid, but with Leaves if a Widow, who ne∣vertheless being generally younger than the Man, was to Mourn a whole year in Black for her deceased Husband; till the expiration of which time she was not to Marry another. Governors of Provinces and other Officers of State, receiv'd their Wives from the <HI>Ingas,</HI> who enquiring out the beautifullest and most accomplish'd Virgins they could hear of, put the <HI>Ajota</HI> on their Feet, and gave them to such Per∣sons as they most fancied; after which if they committed Adultery they were cer∣tainly put to death. The Marrying of Brothers and Sisters was also forbid, till the Inga <HI>Topa Yupangui,</HI> Father to <HI>Guaynacava</HI> broke that Law, by Marrying his own Sister <HI>Mamoello,</HI> and made ah Order that the <HI>Ingas</HI> onely should have that liberty; nay, when he lay on his Death-bed, he strictly charg'd his Son <HI>Guaynacava</HI> to take his own Sister <HI>Goya Cuissilmay</HI> to Wife; and this incestuous Marriage produc'd <HI>Huascar</HI> and <HI>Attabaliba,</HI> (though some say <HI>Attabaliba</HI> was begotten on a Concubine) in whose time the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Kingdom went to ruine. <HI>Guaynacava</HI> also permitted the common People to Marry their Sisters of the Fathers side, but not of the Mothers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of living.</NOTE>The <HI>Peruvian</HI> Houses were antiently for the most part light and small; and for their Table they made but little preparation, satisfying themselves with a little Beer made of Rice, Bread bak'd of <HI>Maiz,</HI> dry'd Flesh, Fish, and Roots.</P>
<P>In their Wars they us'd Slings, Darts, Arrows, Lances, Pikes, Halberds, Pole-Axes, and Shields.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fune∣rals.</NOTE>Their Funerals were also solemnly kept, especially those of Persons of Quality, the Corps was carried out on a brave Chair, from which he was put into the Ground, with two of his Concubines whom he best affected, and also three Ser∣vants, Gold and Silver Vessels, <HI>Maiz,</HI> and the Liquor <HI>Chica,</HI> which the nearest Re∣lation spurted into his Mouth through a Cane; all which they did that the Decea∣sed might make use thereof in the other World. But before the Funeral the Relati∣ons Mourn'd over the Corps several days, and after the Body was Interr'd, they plac'd the Picture of the Deceased upon the Grave: but the meaner sort of Peo∣ple had the Tools belonging to their Trade; and Soldiers their Arms plac'd on the same.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Reli∣gion.</NOTE>In their Religion they had various Fancies; their prime God <HI>Viracocha</HI> bore se∣veral Denominations, and amongst others he was call'd <HI>Pacachame,</HI> or <HI>Pachayacha∣chick,</HI> by which he was signifi'd to be the Creator of Heaven and Earth; as al∣so <HI>Usapu,</HI> that is, <HI>Wonderful.</HI> In honor to this <HI>Pacachama</HI> stood formerly a magnifi∣cent Temple about four Leagues from <HI>Lima,</HI> where the Ruines still manifest its for∣mer glory, it being the Place where the Devil answer'd the Priests, who stood with their Backs towards the Image of <HI>Pacochame,</HI> bowing their Heads to the Ground, and showing many antick Tricks. The second Temple stood near <HI>Cusco,</HI> in which the <HI>Inga's</HI> had plac'd the Images of all the Gods and Goddesses that were worshipp'd in <HI>Peru;</HI> and before each Image stood an Altar: the chiefest of them, call'd <HI>Puachao,</HI> consisting of massie Gold, was Dedicated to the Sun, on whose Forehead the Sun was Engraven on a Plate, which afterwards fell into the Hands of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Cap∣tain <HI>Mancius Sierra de Lequizamo;</HI> but because he lost the same one Night at Gaming, this Proverb was rais'd upon it, <HI>Lequizamo lost the Sun before it rose,</HI> because he got the Plate on which the Sun was Engraven in the Afternoon, and lost the same in the Night: The Temple it self, built of great Stones, curiously joyn'd together in <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work, and within link'd with Golden Plates of a Finger thick, stood full of Golden Chappels and Altars; round about it were several Galleries, into which

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The various Idolatry of the <HI>Peruvi∣ans.</HI></NOTE>This kind of Idolatry was common to the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> with several other Nations of the antient <HI>Heathens,</HI> as hath been before observ'd, which made them mock at the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they told them of a Crucifi'd <HI>Saviour,</HI> saying they had a splendid God, who appear'd to them in glory every Morning. In the third Temple near the River <HI>Taciquaque</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> which exceeded the other two, they worshipp'd Thunder by the Name of <HI>Chuquilla, Catuilla,</HI> and <HI>Intillapa,</HI> which the <HI>Peruvians</HI> believ'd to be a Man that Commanded the Air, and who being Arm'd with a Club and Sling, throws down Rain, Hail, and Snow from the Clouds, and shooting Bullets through the lower Region, causes Thunder and Lightning: They worshipp'd him after the same manner as they did <HI>Viracocha</HI> and the Sun, with holding up of a thing like a Glove, and sometimes Offering, especially in <HI>Cusco,</HI> living Children: Also they ador'd the Earth of which they made the Goddess <HI>Bathamama;</HI> also <HI>Mamacocha,</HI> the God of the Sea. The Rainbowe, which the <HI>Ingas</HI> carried between two Ser∣pents for their Arms, was also religiously worshipp'd. Amongst the Stars they imagin'd <HI>Colca,</HI> by us call'd <HI>Aries,</HI> or the <HI>Ram,</HI> as chief; yet held several others of peculiar Denomination, in veneration, of which they crav'd such things as they wanted. The Shepherds ador'd the Star <HI>Nereuchilla,</HI> or <HI>Capricorn,</HI> whom they judge to Rule over the Beasts. Others worshipp'd <HI>Machacuay,</HI> which the <HI>European</HI> Astrono∣mers call the <HI>Serpent,</HI> as commanding Serpents and Dragons, that they might re∣ceive no hurt from them. Tygers, Lyons, and Bears, were Rul'd by the Star <HI>Chu∣quichinchag;</HI> wherefore those who would walk free from those ravenous Beasts, lifted up folded Hands to the Constellations representing the same. They believ'd that there was no Creature living on Earth, whose Likeness the Heavens could not afford; and that those which were on Earth were under the influence of those in Heaven: from hence proceeded the Names of the Stars <HI>Chacana, Topatatca, Ma∣mana, Mirma,</HI> and others. They likewise attributed a kind of Divinity to Fountains, Rivers, Rocks, Mountains, some kinds of Herbs, Roots, and especially the <HI>Papas,</HI>
<PB N="423" REF="275"/>of a strange shape, and had a veneration for all manner of Creatures that were of an unusual form. When they travell'd they strew'd Shoes, Plumes of Feathers, and <HI>Cocoa</HI> in all cross Ways and tops of Hills, by them call'd <HI>Apachitas;</HI> and if they want the fore-mention'd things, then they throw a Stone for an Offering, from whence it proceeds, that in all cross Ways, and on the tops of Hills, lie heaps of Stones, which are accounted holy.</P>
<P>The like fond veneration of Stones the <HI>Saracens</HI> are said antiently to have had, upon a Tradition, That <HI>Abraham</HI> had enjoy'd <HI>Agar</HI> upon a Stone, and that accord∣ing to <HI>Euthymius</HI> and <HI>Libanius,</HI> he ty'd his Cammel to a Stone when he went to Offer his Son <HI>Isaac.</HI></P>
<P>The Images of their deceased <HI>Ingas,</HI> which they call'd <HI>Guaoiqui,</HI> were had in great honor, and carried with them to the Wars, and up and down in Processionings, and call'd upon for fruitful Seasons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Peruvi∣ans</HI> believ'd the Immor∣tality of the Soul.</NOTE>The Immortality of the Soul, the giving of Punishments to the Wicked, and of Rewards to those that do well, was generally believ'd amongst the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> but not the Resurrection of the Dead. Many suffer'd themselves to be buried with their Friends, that they might accompany them to the other World. When the Inga <HI>Guaynacava</HI> was buried, above a thousand of his Courtiers Sung several Songs, kept a great Feast, and went with great joy to be buried with him, that so they might serve their King on the other side of the Mountains. They Offer'd likewise a great number of Children, and with their Blood cross'd their Faces from one Ear to ano∣ther: But this barbarous Offering was never us'd but at the Death of prime Per∣sons of Quality; for the meaner sort of People set onely Meat on the Graves, and gave the Dead two Sutes of Apparel, put Money in their Mouthes and Hands; for they believ'd that the Souls ranging up and down from place to place, suffer'd many inconveniences.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ora∣cle.</NOTE>The <HI>Peruvian</HI> Images consisted generally of Gold, Silver, Stone, or Wood, all of them strangely deform'd: Some of them were said to give Responces like the Oracle at <HI>Delphos</HI> and <HI>Dodona,</HI> chiefly in the Temple <HI>Pacachama,</HI> whose greatness is suf∣ficiently manifest by the Ruines of its Walls beyond <HI>Lima,</HI> where <HI>Franciscus Pizarrus</HI> got an invaluable Treasure. Each <HI>Peruvian</HI> Province had a Temple, besides which, in the Cities, Villages, and Hamlets, were Chappels of Ease, into which the Priests went at Night with their Backs towards the Idol, bended Heads and Bodies; in which posture they requested to know future Events, and were many times answer'd (if we may believe their Reports) in a terrible Voice. The great Temple at <HI>Cusco,</HI> wherein the <HI>Ingas</HI> had plac'd all the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Idols, is now turn'd into a <HI>Dominican</HI> Cloyster. In each Province of <HI>Peru</HI> was also a Nunnery (if we may so term it) or Ha∣bitation of devoted Virgins, call'd <HI>Allaguau,</HI> ie. <HI>A House of the Choicest,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Nun∣neries.</NOTE> over which was plac'd a Governor nam'd <HI>Appopanaca,</HI> to whom none durst deny their Daughters; some of which were styl'd <HI>Wives of the Sun,</HI> and others Servant-Maids to the same: The Wives Cloth'd in Embroyder'd Coats, adorn'd the Temple, whilest the Maids kept clean the Walls and Floor. When they attain'd to fourteen Years of Age, some were chosen out from the rest, and oblig'd to perpetual Virginity and soli∣tude of Life in their Chappels; which sacred Obligation if they broke by suffering any to Lie with them, they were buried alive after the manner of the Vestal Virgins, the Ceremony whereof is related by <HI>Plutarch:</HI> Others were oblig'd to make daily Offerings; others to make peculiar Sacrifices for the <HI>Inga</HI>'s Health, and happy Events in War; many also were employ'd in the Court-Service to wait upon the <HI>Inga's</HI> Wife or Concubines; and those being absolv'd from their Vow, were oft∣times Married to Courtiers. These Nunneries were Endow'd with great Revenues
<PB N="424" REF="276"/>from the <HI>Chacaras,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Offer∣ings.</NOTE> or Church-Lands. Their Offerings were (for sometimes they Offer'd to their Idols the highly esteem'd Herb <HI>Cocoa, Maiz,</HI> several colour'd Plumes, Sea-Monsters, Gold and Silver Images of Beasts, fine Clothes call'd <HI>Cumbi,</HI> Sweet∣wood, and Tallow to burn) either to have success in their Journeys, Trades, or for the preservation of Health, or to obtain a plentiful Harvest. But their usual Offer∣ings were <HI>Cuces,</HI> a sort of Toads, which were eaten by the <HI>Peruvians.</HI> When they were to do any Business of consequence, then Persons of Quality kill'd their Sheep <HI>Pacos,</HI> not without strange observation of the colour and number of them, as also of the time; all which things well consider'd, they took the Sheep and laid it cross their right Arm, turn'd the Face thereof towards the Sun, and mutter'd several words to themselves according to the colour; for if it was spotted grey, they spoke to <HI>Chuquilla,</HI> or Thunder; if white and short Fleec'd, to the Sun; if well Fleec'd, to <HI>Viracocha.</HI> In <HI>Cusco</HI> they Offer'd daily a short-fleec'd Sheep to the Sun in this manner: Making a great Fire call'd <HI>Vibbacaronca,</HI> the Priests threw the Sheep and four Baskets of <HI>Cocoa</HI> into it. Their Sacrifices <HI>Cozocovicca</HI> and <HI>Sapovicca,</HI> to ob∣tain Conquests, were also very strange: for they gather'd out of <HI>Puna</HI> (which is a desolate place) several sorts of Brambles and Bushes nam'd <HI>Ganilli,</HI> which being all set on fire, they went about the Fire with round Stones in their Hands, on which were painted Serpents, Lyons, Toads, and Tygers, crying, <HI>Usachum, grant us Conquest,</HI> together with this Prayer, <HI>Destroy, O Creator, the power of our Enemies Gods;</HI> which said, several starv'd Sheep were brought out, which for that reason they call'd <HI>Urca;</HI> whose Hearts having torn out they began their Prayers afresh, saying, <HI>Mighty</HI> Viracocha, <HI>thus do thou pull out the Hearts of our Enemies.</HI> For the prosperity of the <HI>Ingas</HI> they kill'd in an open Field black Dogs, by them call'd <HI>Appurucos,</HI> whose Flesh was eaten with many Ceremonies by People appointed for that purpose. They made Offerings also to the Fountains, Rivers, Brooks, and Sea-shells, under pretence that those Shells were Daughters of the Ocean, and the Ocean the Father of Streams and Springs; when they had Sow'n their Fields, their Priests, chose to that Office, went from House to House to gather such Offerings as every one was pleas'd to give; which they laid at the Banks of several Sluces, at the time when the Water began to rise there, thinking by that Oblation to keep them from over-flowing their Lands, and washing away their Seed. In all places where two Rivers joyn'd together they wash'd themselves, having first bedaub'd themselves all over with stamp'd <HI>Maiz;</HI> and afterwards look'd upon themselves as well purg'd from Sin; which power they ascrib'd to their Baths. To strangle Children between four and ten years of Age was never us'd, unless upon the <HI>Inga</HI>'s being sick, or when he receiv'd the Royal Tassel, that from the death of the Children he might receive Health, or Reign prosperously. The fore-mention'd Nuns that were chose to at∣tend on the King's, were also strangled when the <HI>Inga</HI> was sick; nay, sometimes a Father would Offer his Son to <HI>Viracocha,</HI> on the Sun-Priest's suggestion, That by his Son's death he would recover from his Sickness, Praying to the foremention'd Dei∣ty, that they would be pleas'd to save the sick Father, because the Son had with his Death paid for his Fathers.</P>
<P>This kind of Cruelty the Devil seem'd to prompt the <HI>Heathens</HI> to, by making use of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Example, who prepar'd his Son <HI>Isaac</HI> for a Sacrifice on Mount <HI>Moria;</HI> and that it was a Practice amongst the antient <HI>Ammonites</HI> and <HI>Moabites,</HI> and other <HI>Heathens</HI> (by which even the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were apt to be seduc'd) appears from the Scripture it self: the Ceremonies of which bruitish Customs, with the seven Brazen Chambers of <HI>Moloch,</HI> may be seen describ'd by <HI>Rabbi Solomon.</HI></P>

<PB N="425" REF="276"/><FIGURE>
</FIGURE> agreeing with our <HI>December,</HI> deserves serious observation: for as long as the Feast lasted, no Stranger was suffer'd to Lodge in <HI>Cusco,</HI> whither they all flock'd again after the Feast was over, to receive Cakes made by the <HI>Mamaconas</HI> (an Order of Nuns) of <HI>Maiz</HI> and the warm Blood of a white Ram, and were distributed by cer∣tain Priests (Extracted from the Royal Family <HI>Iluqui Yupangui</HI>) who carrying them up and down in Golden Dishes, gave every one of a Company one, saying at the delivery of it, <HI>If you do not Reverence the Sun and</HI> Inga, <HI>this Food will witness against you to your Ruine; but if you worship them, then their Bodies will by this Pledge be united to yours:</HI> after which those that had eaten of the Cakes promis'd Obedience, and thank'd the Sun and <HI>Inga</HI> for their Food.</P>
<P>At the fore-mention'd <HI>Chasquis</HI> a course was taken to carry all that desir'd, to eve∣ry Temple through the whole Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> where the Inhabitants receiv'd them with great Reverence, having before confess'd all their sins to their <HI>Yahuries,</HI> or Father-Confessors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Confessi∣ons.</NOTE> who being chosen to that Office with a great deal of Ceremo∣ny, impos'd greater or lesser Penances, according to the sins of the Penitent: those that were suspected to have conceal'd any of their sins, were put to cast Lots, or had the Entrails of the Beasts which they had kill'd to that purpose consulted about them, and thereby were discover'd if they had conceal'd any of their sins; which when∣ever it hapned, the Priests falling upon the false Penitents, thump'd them with a Stone on their Backs so long, till they had confess'd all their Faults, which the Priest was not to reveal on pain of Death, but to make Expiatory Offerings. The sins about which they were Examin'd, were chiefly Theft, Murder, Adultery, prepa∣ring of Poyson, or sleighting their <HI>Inga</HI> or Gods; for each of which Transgressions they had several kinds of Punishments. When the <HI>Inga</HI> fell sick, all People in ge∣neral were forc'd to come and make Confession of their sins; also every one went to his Confessor when he was in trouble, or expected some Misfortune to befall him: The <HI>Inga</HI> himself Confess'd his sins to none but the Sun, which he desir'd to re∣late to <HI>Viracocha,</HI> and to beg pardon of him for the same, which done, he bath'd him∣self in a running Stream, and cry'd, <HI>I have made my sins known to thee, O Sun; do thou,

If their Sorcerers at any time fore∣told a Fathers Death, then he immediately Sacrifis'd his Son, that with his Death he might buy his own Life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Esteem of their Soothsayers.</NOTE> No People were more respected than their Sooth∣sayers, as Men that could discover private Thefts, Accidents that hapned in re∣mote Countreys, and also future Events, and so far their Credit amongst the Vulgar carried them, that they undertook to tell the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when their Countrey-men should be Conquerors, and when defeated in the War they maintain'd against the <HI>Netherlanders.</HI> There were also cunning Women, who making themselves dead Drunk with <HI>Chica,</HI> with which they mix'd the Herb <HI>Viloa,</HI> and afterwards coming to themselves again, answer'd all the Questions that were proposed to them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their month∣ly Feasts.</NOTE>The <HI>Peruvians</HI> kept two sorts of Feasts, the first at certain times, the others on special occasions; the set-Feasts were kept Monethly; on the first Moneth <HI>Rayme,</HI> agreeing with our last Moneth <HI>December,</HI> as aforesaid, they kept the great Feast <HI>Ca∣pacrayme,</HI> on which they brought Multitudes of Sheep and Lambs for Burnt-offer∣ings, besides Silver and Gold. Not far from the Fire stood three Carv'd Images of the Sun, and three others representing Thunder; and this was generally the Day of the Installation of the young <HI>Inga's,</HI> which was after this manner: The chief Priest boring a Hole through his Ear, cover'd the upper part of his Body with the holy Cloth <HI>Guaras,</HI> whilest the inferior Priests whipt him with knotted Cords, and painted his Face with the Blood. During these Ceremonies no Stranger was suf∣fer'd to remain in <HI>Cusco,</HI> but after the Feast was ended they all return'd, and as be∣fore, receiv'd Cakes bak'd of <HI>Maiz</HI> and Blood, as a testimony that they lov'd and honor'd the <HI>Inga.</HI></P>
<P>The three Images of the Sun before-mention'd they call'd <HI>Apointi, Churiunti,</HI> and <HI>Intiquaoqui,</HI> that is, <HI>Father-Sun, Son-Sun,</HI> and <HI>Brother-Sun.</HI> In like manner they nam'd the three Images of Thunder, <HI>Chuquilla, Catuilla,</HI> and <HI>Intillapa;</HI> from which <HI>Acosta</HI> judges that the Devil had obscurely taught the <HI>Peruvians</HI> the Mysteries of the holy <HI>Sacrament</HI> and <HI>Trinity,</HI> (that their glory might be eclips'd by Idolatrous Errors) espe∣cially the last, which seems plainly to be signifi'd by the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Deity <HI>Tangatanga,</HI> whom they affirm'd to be One in Three, and Three in One. And that other Nations also had a glimpse of the same may be collected from <HI>Philip Cluverius,</HI> who endea∣vors to demonstrate, that the antient <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Gauls</HI> obscurely ador'd the <HI>Trinity</HI> in the midst of their <HI>Heathenism,</HI> under the notion of <HI>Sun, Moon,</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> the Sun signifying the <HI>Father,</HI> the Moon the <HI>Son,</HI> and the Fire the <HI>Holy-Ghost;</HI> to confirm which he makes use of <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Testimony, <HI>viz.

But it may be thought strange, that the <HI>Peruvians, Germans,</HI> or <HI>Egyptians,</HI> lost in a Wood of gross Idolatry, could have any apprehension, though never so obscure, of the holy <HI>Trinity,</HI> when as the most nice and curious <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Wits have made such gross mistakes concerning God. But to return again to the <HI>Peruvians:</HI> They kept their second Feast in the second Moneth <HI>Camay,</HI> on which they threw the Ashes of their Offerings into the River, and fol∣low'd them on the Shore for the space of five Leagues, praying the River to carry the Ashes to the Sea, where <HI>Viracocha</HI> would receive them. In the third and fourth Moneths they kill'd a hundred and ten black spotted and grey Sheep.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Har∣vest Ceremo∣nies.</NOTE> In the be∣ginning of <HI>May</HI> (by the <HI>Peruvians</HI> call'd <HI>Hatuncuzqui</HI>) they gather'd in their <HI>Maiz,</HI> and kept the Feast <HI>Aymorai;</HI> after which they return'd home Singing from their Fields, call'd <HI>Chacra,</HI> and carried a great heap of <HI>Maiz</HI> with them, nam'd <HI>Perua,</HI> wrapping it up in rich Garments; three Nights they continu'd their Ceremonies, implo∣ring the <HI>Perua</HI> to preserve their Harvest of <HI>Maiz</HI> from any damage that might chance to come to it, and also to let that grow prosperously which they should Plant next. Lastly, their Sorcerers consulted whether the <HI>Perua</HI> could last till the next year? to which if they were answer'd <HI>No,</HI> they carried it into the Fields, and burn∣ing it, made a new <HI>Perua,</HI> which when they knew to be sufficient to last good a year, they carried it to the Granary in great triumph. In the seventh Moneth <HI>Ancaya∣cuzqui,</HI> they kept the Feast call'd <HI>Intraymi,</HI> with a hundred Sheep, in honor of the Sun. They also made several Images of the Wood <HI>Quimia,</HI> which they put in rich

Persons of Quality put Golden Plates about their Knees, as the common People painted them with divers Colours. In the eighth Moneth <HI>Chahua</HI> they kept the high Feast <HI>Huarqui,</HI> on which they Offer'd a hundred grey Sheep; the like number, but of a Chesnut colour, they Offer'd the following Moneth <HI>Yupaquis,</HI> besides a thousand <HI>Cuies,</HI> that the Air, Water, or Sun, might not spoil their Plants. Their Feast <HI>Situa</HI> they kept on the tenth Moneth <HI>Coyaraymi</HI> after this manner: They gather'd all together on the first day before the Moon rose, which no sooner appear'd, but they made a terrible noise, beat one another with lighted Torches, then wash'd the Dirt from their Bodies, and made themselves Drunk for four Days together. The eleventh Moneth <HI>Armaraimi,</HI> was nam'd <HI>Pun∣chaiquis,</HI> from the Feast they kept therein, on which (besides the usual Offerings of eight hundred Sheep) they ty'd a black Sheep to a Post without Meat, till such time as there fell store of Dew. Their Feast call'd <HI>Raymicantara Raiquis,</HI> was kept in the last Moneth <HI>Ayamara,</HI> on which their Youth were bor'd through the Ears.

In their Dances, which were to the sound of Drums, Pipes, and Horns, they imitated all manner of Trades by strange motions of their Bodies, besides divers other Frolicks and May-games which they us'd at such times of Mirth and Festivity: But since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> conquer'd <HI>Peru,</HI> all these <HI>Heathenish</HI> Customs have been laid aside.</P>

But <HI>Attabaliba</HI> inform'd by <HI>Pizar∣ro</HI> of <HI>Huascar</HI>'s Imprisonment, seem'd to be exceeding sorry, and said, <HI>I am much troubled at the News of my Captain's laying violent Hands on my Brother</HI> Huascar, <HI>whom I ac∣knowledge my eldest Brother, and both of the same Father and Mother; but I suppose he has no design to kill him, but onely keeps him Prisoner, to bring him to grant me peaceably to enjoy the Kingdom of</HI> Quito, <HI>of late brought under subjection of the</HI> Peruvian <HI>Crown. Pizarro</HI> not observing <HI>Attabaliba</HI>'s subtilty (who design'd nothing but <HI>Huascar</HI>'s Death, out of fear that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon his liberal promises to them, might promote him to the Throne) comforted him as well as he could: whereupon <HI>Attabaliba</HI> supposing that <HI>Pizarro</HI> would be little concern'd at the killing of his Brother <HI>Huascar,</HI> gave speedy Order that he should be burnt alive,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Huascar</HI> burnt by Or∣der of his Brother <HI>At∣tabaliba.</HI></NOTE> which accordingly was put into exe∣cution; but before he was brought to the Fire, he foretold his Brother <HI>Attabaliba</HI>'s cruel Death.

Our Shoulders are grown sore under our Arms, our Bodies made useless with Wounds, and our Limbs lame'd with Bruises.

It was towards Evening when the two Parties had sight of one another: <HI>Pizarro</HI> having not onely more Men, but also better Exercis'd in Arms than the Vice-Roy,
<PB N="436" REF="283"/>who being sensible thereof, went silently about Midnight from his Station along a narrow by Path, so to fall behind upon the Rere of the Enemy, who mistrusted nothing, by reason the Vice-Roy's Dogs kept a continual Barking in his old Sta∣tion, and the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sentinels were heard calling to one another, and making great Fires all the Night long; but because the Way was over-grown, and farther about than it was suppos'd, the Vice-Roy finding the Night too far spent, went back to <HI>Quito,</HI> out of which he Sallied as soon as he had sight of <HI>Pizarro</HI>'s Forces; against whom, being clad in a white Riding Coat, through the Slits of which ap∣pear'd a Cloth of Tissue Doublet, he came Riding on a Bay Gelding in the Head of his Party; with which breaking in amongst the Enemies Ranks, he made a consider∣able slaughter amongst them, till <HI>Hernand Tores</HI> coming near him, gave him a Blow on the Had with a Battel-Ax,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vice-Roy slain by <HI>Carvayales.</HI></NOTE> that fell'd him to the Ground, which the Lawyer <HI>Carvayales</HI> seeing, ran immediately, out of desire to revenge his Brother's Death, whom the Vice-Roy had murder'd, and chopp'd off his Head.

This Undertaking seem'd to be threatned by many Dangers, he not having a sufficient Spirit to Com∣mand, or at least Experience to officiate the Place of a Captain.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vela Nunnez</HI> and <HI>La Torre</HI> Plotting a∣gainst <HI>Pizar∣ro,</HI> are taken and Executed</NOTE> In the mean time <HI>Vela Nunnez,</HI> Brother to the slain Vice-Roy, taken in the Battel at <HI>Quito,</HI> had so much priviledge allow'd him from <HI>Pizarro,</HI> that he went a Hunting, and other such Exercises, distant from the Camp, who meeting with <HI>La Torre,</HI> took him in his arms, and embrac'd him with great joy, which so wrought upon <HI>La Torre,</HI> that he discover'd the Secret of his discover'd Treasure, took an Oath of him that he would be faithful to him, and take Revenge of <HI>Pizarro</HI> for all the Injuries receiv'd from him; but before, according to their Agreement, they could set Sail from thence, their Plot being discover'd, both <HI>Nunnez</HI> and <HI>Torre</HI> were Executed, and their Riches fell into the Hands of <HI>Pizarro.</HI></P>

<P>The Winter begins here in <HI>October,</HI> and continues till <HI>March,</HI> in which fall mighty Showers, and on the Mountains abundance of Snow, but all the Summer long the Sun is seldom darkned with a Cloud.

This Tree grows in most places, especially in low Grounds, the more be∣cause the Kernels which the Birds picking out let fall on the Ground, spring up in new Trees.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Fruits, as Peaches, Cittrons, Figs, Pomegranates, Pears, Quinces, and Oranges, grow also here in great abundance, but when ripe are subject to rot.</P>

Canela, Pacomores,</HI> and <HI>St. Juan de Salinas. Canela</HI> is so call'd, because it hath many great Woods, which produce the Fruit <HI>Canela</HI> in great abundance, the Owners whereof were most inhumanely dealt with by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> for <HI>Gonsalvo Pizarro</HI> supposing to get store of Gold there, found nothing but Trees, bearing a Fruit like Olives, by the Na∣tives call'd <HI>Canela,</HI> with which they us'd to drive a great Trade, being otherwise poor and simple People, living in Huts, which <HI>Pizarro</HI> pulling down, caus'd the Inhabitants to be torn in pieces by his Dogs, because they could not furnish him with Gold, nor direct him where it was to be had.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Grana∣dilla</HI>-Apple.</NOTE>Besides the <HI>Canela</HI>-Tree, this Countrey also produceth in great plenty the Tree which beareth the Apples <HI>Granadilla,</HI> exceeding good against burning Feavers; the Leaves are like Ivy, the Blossom resembling the Sun, and the long Leaves speckled with Red and White, open three hours after Sun-rising, and close again before the Evening, just as if Nature took care to preserve the beauty of the Flower.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns and Places of chief note.</NOTE>In this part of the Province the chief are, 1. <HI>Baeza,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Quixos,</HI> built in the Year 1559. by <HI>Ramires de Avila,</HI> eighteen Leagues from <HI>Cusco.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Archidona,</HI> twenty Leagues to the South-East of <HI>Baeza.</HI> 3. <HI>Avila.</HI> 4. <HI>Sevilla del Oro,</HI> all of them <HI>Spanish</HI> Colonies.</P>
<P>The Territories <HI>Pacomores</HI> and <HI>Yguansongo,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>The Countrey of Juan de Salinas,</HI> are said both to extend above a hundred Leagues in length, and little less in breadth. The Fields afford store of Pasture for Cattel, the Plough'd Lands produce Wheat and all sorts of wholsom Herbs; and in some places are also rich Gold-Mines.</P>
<P>The Governor <HI>Layola</HI> built four Towns here, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Valladolid;</HI> 2. <HI>Loyola;</HI> 3. <HI>San Jago de los Montanas;</HI> and 4. <HI>Caruma.</HI></P>
<P>The Jesuit <HI>Acosta</HI> relates, That not far from <HI>Caruma</HI> he found great Stones, some of which were full of Golden Veins, but were hard to be cut from the Rock. Most of the Gold is found in the Sand of several Rivers, the chiefest whereof flow through <HI>Quito, New Granada, Valdivita</HI> in <HI>Chili,</HI> and <HI>Caravaya</HI> in <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>On the Point of <HI>Quito,</HI> the River <HI>San Jago</HI> falls into the Southern Ocean; the Ground in the Mouth of the River being very uneven, for oftentimes the Ships are
<PB N="447" REF="288"/>fast aground at the Stern, and on Head they have above eighty Fathom Water; yet nevertheless the Shoals are no ways dangerous.</P>
<P>South-West from <HI>St. Jago</HI> lies the spacious Inlet <HI>Mattheo,</HI> and the Promontory <HI>Francisco,</HI> known by its Banks and high Grounds, which shew red and white at a great distance.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, exactly under the <HI>Equinox,</HI> appears <HI>Cape Passao,</HI> flat and low; between which and <HI>Mattheo,</HI> the great Rivers <HI>Los Quiximes</HI> fall into the Sea.</P>
<P>Behind <HI>Passao</HI> rises the high Mountain <HI>Quaque;</HI> and more Westerly the Bay <HI>Cara∣ques</HI> affords a secure Harbor for all manner of Vessels.</P>
<P>Next you come to the Town <HI>Puerto Viejo</HI> before mention'd, lying behind the Island <HI>Laurenso.</HI></P>
<P>Five Leagues off at Sea, before <HI>Laurenoz,</HI> lies the Island <HI>Plata,</HI> formerly famous for a <HI>Peruvian</HI> Temple, in which the Natives Sacrifis'd Sheep, and sometimes Chil∣dren, and painted the Figures of divers Persons with the Blood; to which they also Offer'd Jewels, Gold, Silver, Wooll, Cotton Shirts, and Cloaks. <HI>Francisco Pizarro</HI> arriving here, got an invaluable Mass of Treasure; but at present it ly∣ing desolate, affords nothing but Brambles and wild Trees.</P>
<P>The next which come in view are the Havens <HI>Callo</HI> and <HI>Zalango,</HI> where there are safe Harbors, good Wood and Water.</P>
<P>The Cape of <HI>St. Helena</HI> makes also a secure Road on the North, and on its Shore hath a Spring, on the top of whose Waters swims a certain Gum, by the Natives call'd <HI>Copey,</HI> exceeding good to make Ships tight.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Tumbez</HI> falls into a large Bay, which on its North-East Point near the Main Land, hath the Island <HI>Puna,</HI> ten Leagues in circumference: The Soyl where∣of produces abundance of <HI>Maiz, Juca,</HI> and other good Roots, besides great Woods full of fruitful Trees, and <HI>Sarsaparilla.</HI> The Inhabitants of a brown Complexion, and middle Stature, wear Cotton Cloaks, and Chains of <HI>Chaquira</HI> and Precious Stones: They drive a great Trade, and formerly maintain'd Wars with the Peo∣ple inhabiting upon the River <HI>Tumbez;</HI> their great want is fresh Water in the Summer. <HI>Thomas Candish</HI> Landing here <HI>Anno</HI> 1587. found a Ship hal'd ashore, and three Villages, in one of which stood a Palace belonging to a <HI>Casique,</HI> surrounded with Stone Galleries; and near it a large Store-house full of Tar-pots and Hemp to make Cables of: The Village consisted of two hundred Houses, and a fair Church with a Steeple, in which hung several Bells. The <HI>Casique</HI> Married to a <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Woman being fled with the Villagers, <HI>Candish</HI> took many Oxen, fat Sheep, Pi∣geons and Ducks, the Bells, and what else was not convey'd aboard, with him, and afterwards burnt the whole Town; but whilest he was busie in making havock, a thousand <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and a considerable number of <HI>Peruvians</HI> fell upon the <HI>English</HI> on such a sudden, that they kill'd some, and took others Prisoners.</P>
<P>Somewhat farther off at Sea appears the Isle <HI>Clara,</HI> where those of <HI>Puna</HI> formerly buried their Dead.</P>
<P>The Inlet into which falls the River <HI>Tumbez,</HI> whose Shores are well inhabited, ends Westward at the Promontory <HI>Blanco;</HI> Southward from which lies the Isle <HI>Lo∣bos,</HI> where there are several Springs full of the same Gum, or <HI>Bitumen,</HI> a little above mention'd.</P>
<P>Beyond the Point <HI>Agua</HI> lie the two Isles <HI>Lobos Marinos,</HI> opposite to a low Coast; they are desolate, and barren of Grass, Trees, and all kind of Herbs, and destitute of fresh Water; but many Pelicans, Penguins, and other strange Birds.</P>
<P>The discovering of these Coasts belonging to the Jurisdiction of <HI>Quito,</HI> deserves a short Relation:</P>

From thence marching to the County <HI>Zumaque,</HI> he got plenty of Provision and Cinamon, which grows on great Trees in the Woods; the Leaves thereof resemble the Laurel; the Fruit grows in little Ber∣ries; the Root and Bark have a strong odoriferous smell. Thence travelling to the Town <HI>Coca,</HI> he found a mighty Cataract of Water, falling from a Rock above fifteen hundred Ells high; insomuch that the noise in calm Weather was heard six Leagues off. <HI>Pizarro</HI> leaving his sick People in <HI>Zumaque,</HI> went onely with a few Eastward from <HI>Coca</HI> to the Plain Countrey <HI>Guema,</HI> full of Moorish Grounds, the Inhabitants whereof went naked: at last he came to the great River <HI>Maranon,</HI> which falls from the Mountains near <HI>Quito,</HI> and extends with several windings above eight hundred Leagues in length, and at the Mouth thereof is fifteen Leagues broad, which at that time overflowing all the Countrey, he judg'd it convenient to build a Brigantine, making the Shoes of the dead Horses serve for Iron-work, his Mens Shirts for Sails, and a Gum, which was to be had there, for Tar, and having Lanch'd their Vessel, and put all their Baggage and sick People into the same, they Sail'd close along the Shore, on which <HI>Pizarro</HI> made his Way through Brambles and Canes, or went over in the Brigantine whensoe're he espy'd a better Path on the other side; in which manner they were gone two hundred Leagues down the River, with no other Food
<PB N="449" REF="289"/>but wild Fruit and Roots; when Captain <HI>Franciscus Orellana,</HI> was order'd to Sail away before with five Men, and seek out for Provisions, and at every Stream which fell cross-ways out of the Countrey into the great River,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Orellana</HI> corss'd in his Designs, dies for grief.</NOTE> he was to leave a Mann'd Boat: but <HI>Orellana</HI> in few days drove down so far with the swift River, that he saw no likelihood or getting up again in a whole year, neither could he find any Provisions, but fought daily with the <HI>Indians,</HI> who came stoutly to Board him in little Boats: amongst whom he was inform'd also, that thereabouts liv'd the <HI>Amazon</HI> Women, that Warr'd continually against their Neighbors; and at last he came into the Northern Ocean. But <HI>Orellana</HI> Sailing to <HI>Spain,</HI> obtain'd a Com∣mission to be Governor of the <HI>Amazons</HI> Countrey, whither he steer'd his Course with five hundred Men in three Ships; but Landing at the <HI>Canaries</HI> they all ran a∣way from him, which so incens'd <HI>Orelland,</HI> that he soon after dy'd with Grief. Mean while <HI>Pizarro</HI> inform'd by a <HI>Spaniard</HI> whom <HI>Orellana</HI> had put ashore, that the Brigantine was by the strong Current carried into the Ocean, knew not what to do, his People since their departure from <HI>Quito</HI> having travell'd above four hun∣dred Leagues, had eaten most of their Horses: Many dy'd by feeding on unwhol∣som Herbs; others fell down dead for Hunger, or tir'd out with toilsom Travel; their Clothes, rotted by the Rain, hung upon them like Rags, their Shoes were worn out, their Feet full of Blisters, their Bodies sadly mangled with Brambles and Thorns, for no place afforded them a Boat. <HI>Pizarro</HI> leaving the River <HI>Maranon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The misera∣ble Condi∣tion of <HI>Pizar∣ro</HI>'s Men.</NOTE> went another Way, no less troublesom for steep Rocks and inaccessible Mountains. The Valleys through which they went, began now to be strew'd with dead and sick Bodies, who were not able to follow the Army, which march'd very fast, every one judging to be so much nearer his preservation the farther he could get: Those that fainted call'd continually on their Friends for help, but the Horses were grown too weak to carry them: Every one saw nothing but Death before his Eyes; wherefore, though call'd by their dearest and most intimate Friends that lay a dying, they never look'd back, their compassion towards others being turn'd into fear and care of themselves. The Forsaken implor'd their Saints, .and besought <HI>Pi∣zarro</HI> for aid, but finding their Complaints to be in vain, and raging through de∣spair, they wish'd all the rest the same success, and the like Friends, whenever they should be in the like Condition. <HI>Pizarro</HI> extreamly griev'd and troubled, that he had brought the People into this Misery, sent a few Horsemen before to <HI>Quito,</HI> to carry the sad News of his deplorable Condition, that they might immediately send Provisions to him; which he receiving when he was within fifty Leagues from the said City <HI>Quito,</HI> distributed amongst those that were left alive, who being also al∣most starv'd, eat so greedily, that several of them were chok'd; the remainder were kept a considerable time in Garrison under the Command of <HI>Pizarro</HI> in <HI>Quito.</HI> Which City, built in a pleasant place, grew very populous in the Year 1544. there being several Gold-Mines found about the same in that time.

<P>Round about <HI>Puerto Viejo</HI> the Natives dwelt in Trees, whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had much ado to bring under their subjection; for their Countrey being barren and mountainous, was not onely wanting in Provisions to feed an Army, but the <HI>Peru∣vians</HI>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The several Valleys of this Province</NOTE>In this Province are several very pleasant Valleys, the first whereof is <HI>Motupe,</HI> to which a sandy Way leads from <HI>St. Miguel de Valverde,</HI> between barren Wilds, from whence several Streams falling are immediately drunk up by the Sand; wherefore all Travellers that go that way carry Water and Wine with them in <HI>Calabashes</HI> for twenty Leagues together, which they Walk or Ride by Night, because of the ex∣cessive heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>In the Valley <HI>Motupe</HI> grow abundance of Trees, which receive nourishment from a River that springs up near the same. Here is also much Cotton.</P>
<P>Not far from hence are the Valleys <HI>Xayanca,</HI> formerly very populous and full of Palaces: The River which flows through the middle is led in Trenches amongst the neighboring Fields.</P>
<P>The Valley <HI>Tuqueme</HI> is also very pleasant, and the decay'd Palaces, sufficiently testifie its former splendor.</P>
<P>The next being <HI>Cinto,</HI> is no way inferior to <HI>Tuqueme;</HI> and between both lie sandy Hills and barren Rocks, on which grow neither Trees nor Herbs, nor is any living Creature to be found upon them: the Way through which being a whole days Journey, cannot be travell'd without sure Guides.</P>
<P>The Valley <HI>Collique,</HI> water'd by a River of the same Denomination, and very thick set with Trees, was formerly very populous, but since the <HI>Spanish</HI> Wars it is become quite desolate; for not onely a considerable number of them were slain by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but also many destroy'd themselves, Wives and Children; of which <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> Councellor to the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, sets down several terrible Examples, of which two were remarkable above the rest; the first was after this manner:</P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain <HI>Olandus</HI> Lying with the Daughter of an <HI>Indian Casique,</HI> que∣stion'd when she grew big with Child, Whether she was with Child by him? and that he might know the real truth by Torture, he caus'd her to be ty'd naked to a woodden Spit, and laid to roast against a Fire made of green Wood, so that she died in a most miserable manner; upon which her Father ran in a rage with thirty of his Companions to <HI>Olandus</HI>'s House, where he kill'd his whole Family, and locking all the Doors about the House, set fire on the same, into which when it was at its greatest heighth, he and his Associates leap'd into the middle thereof.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two tragical Passages.</NOTE>The second Accident is also very terrible, <HI>viz.</HI> An <HI>Indian</HI> Maid being Got with Child by a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ass driver, acquainted her Father and Mother with it, withal
<PB N="451" REF="290"/>telling them that she was ready to suffer Death for her Offence; and notwithstand∣ing they freely pardoning, and perswading her to the contrary, she eat raw <HI>Juca,</HI> which when boyl'd is a wholsom Food, but if eaten raw, certain though languishing Death; which she perceiving, ran to the next River, where after having wash'd her self, she broke off from a large Tree a Bough of five Foot long, and making the end thereof very sharp, fell upon the same, and so kill'd her self. Several other Ra∣vish'd Maids taking example hereby, hang'd themselves upon the Boughs of the same Tree.</P>
<P>But to proceed in our Description, next to <HI>Collique</HI> lies the Valley <HI>Zana,</HI> of the like bigness, and famous for the City <HI>Miraflores.</HI></P>
<P>The next is <HI>Pascayamo,</HI> which exceeds all the former in fruitfulness, and popu∣lousness of Inhabitants, who before they were destroy'd by the <HI>Ingas</HI> were much fear'd by their Neighbors. This Valley also was adorn'd with several fair Tem∣ples, which are now turn'd into Cloysters. Cattel, Hogs, and Goats breed here in very great numbers. The chief Trade of this Place consists in Cotton and Linnen.</P>
<P>The Valley <HI>Chacama,</HI> in which the <HI>Dominican</HI> Monks inhabit a brave Cloyster, produces abundance of Sugar.</P>
<P>Four Leagues farther lies the spacious Valley <HI>Chimo,</HI> so call'd from an old <HI>Peru∣vian</HI> Heroe, which affords a pleasant Prospect, by reason of the many Banquetting-houses built there by the <HI>Ingas.</HI> No place in <HI>Peru</HI> is able to stand in competition with this for plenty of Provisions, the Ocean and Rivers producing store of Fish, the Countrey affording Cattel and all manner of Fruit. The Cotton which grows here is Shipp'd to the South Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Chanca</HI> is a Valley chiefly considerable for the Town <HI>Arnedo,</HI> which is situate therein, of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>But the Valley <HI>Guanape,</HI> not far from <HI>Chanca,</HI> yields the best <HI>Peruvian</HI> Liquor <HI>Chica,</HI> and hath a convenient Harbor for Ships.</P>

In the aforesaid Village stood a Church with a spiry Steeple; behind which rose high Mountains, and at the Foot thereof a great Wood, into which the Inhabitants fled with all their Goods, so that <HI>Spilbergen</HI> found nothing but a little Meal, a few Hens, Hogs, and Oranges in their Houses, which whilest he was sending Aboard, a small Body of Horse appear'd, but immediately fled into the Woods.

<P>Not far from hence lie the Valleys <HI>Gaura</HI> and <HI>Lima;</HI> which last exceeds all others in bigness, and was formerly exceeding populous; but since the Marquess <HI>Pizarro</HI> built the City <HI>Los Reyos</HI> here, the Citizens have taken the Lands from the <HI>Peruvians.</HI> The Mines hereabouts produce Gold and Silver. Amongst other things time Inha∣bitants highly esteem an Herb bearing yellow Flowers, which in a short time cures a putrifi'd Wound, whereas if laid on sound Flesh it eats the same to the Bone. The Natives heretofore us'd to spend their time in Hunting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange man∣ner of Hunt∣ing.</NOTE> and caught their Game after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> three or four thousand of them would meet together, and by taking Hands make a Ring of three or four Miles in circumference, and at a certain Note or Tune Sung, or loudly Exclaim'd, they drew nearer and nearer, till at last they were within Shot of the inclosed Game, whatsoever it were.</P>
<P>The Countrey of <HI>Collao</HI> hath a low Point, from which a long Cliff runs into the Sea, towards the small Island call'd <HI>Isla de Collao:</HI> On each side of the Point the Coast runs sloaping in, the one side extending North-West from <HI>Collao,</HI> to the Cliffs <HI>Piscadores;</HI> the other South-East to the second Promontory; behind which is a large Bay, where the Valley <HI>Pachacama</HI> appears, famous for its exceeding fruitful∣ness, and a stately Temple built by the <HI>Ingas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A vast Trea∣sure found by <HI>Ferdinando Pizarro.</HI></NOTE> where <HI>Ferdinando Pizarro</HI> found above nine hundred thousand <HI>Ducats,</HI> besides what the Soldiers and Commanders took, and what the Priests had hid, which none, though miserably tortur'd, would confess.</P>
<P>Opposite to <HI>Pachacama</HI> lies the Valley <HI>Chilca,</HI> where it never Rains, nor any Brook or Spring moistens the dry Soil, which nevertheless produces <HI>Maiz</HI> and Fruit-Trees. The Natives us'd to dig large and deep Pits, in which they Sow'd and
<PB N="453" REF="291"/>Planted, and at every Root laid the Head of a Fish call'd a <HI>Sardin,</HI> which they caught in Nets on the Sea-shore; wherein nevertheless nothing would have grown, but for the Morning Dews which fell. The <HI>Ingas</HI> also had curious Banquetting-houses here. In these Parts there grows a sort Tree call'd <HI>Mala,</HI> of which <HI>Acosta</HI> relates a strange Wonder of Nature, very remarkable, <HI>viz.</HI> That it flourishes and bears Fruit on that side which beholds the South, in that Season when it is Summer on the Mountains; the other which views the Sea; Blossoming and bearing Fruit when it is Summer on the Plains.</P>
<P>The Valley <HI>Guarco,</HI> spacious and full of Trees, produces especially the pleasant Fruit <HI>Guayaves</HI> and <HI>Guavas,</HI> as also the best Wheat in <HI>Peru;</HI> wherefore it is vended all over the Countrey. Here are also the Ruines of another stately Castle, built by the <HI>Ingas,</HI> the former lustre whereof is testifi'd by its remaining Walls, which consist of exceeding great Stones, so neatly joyn'd together without Mortar, that it appears like one entire Stone; and by the decay'd Structures of several Halls, much of the curious Painting whereof is yet to be soch, from the Castle a large pair of Stairs led down to the Sea-shore. Two Leagues farther the River <HI>Lunagun</HI> runs through the fertile Valley of the same Denomination. The fatness of this Soil is chiefly ascrib'd to the Dung of a Fowl call'd <HI>Guana,</HI> which the Natives fetch in great abundance from the Isles near the Main.</P>
<P>Next follows the Valley <HI>Chinca,</HI> one of the biggest in all <HI>Peru,</HI> and before the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> Arrival very populous. In the time of the <HI>Ingas</HI> it also shew'd a magnificent Temple Dedicated to the Sun, built by <HI>Tepaja Jupangue;</HI> yet the Inhabitants still re∣main'd constant in the worshipping of their old Idol <HI>Cinciapema.</HI> Hither the <HI>Ingas</HI> sent their conquer'd Princes, who on a certain time were to appear in <HI>Cusco.</HI> The <HI>Dominicans</HI> at present possess here a neat Cloyster, from whence leads a plain Road to the Dale <HI>Ica,</HI> water'd by the River <HI>Pisco,</HI> which is dry in Summer; wherefore the Natives brought a Ditch from the Mountains, which since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> destroying the Inhabitants, is choak'd up with Sand.</P>
<P>Next the Valley <HI>Nasca</HI> comes in view, famous for the Castle <HI>Caxamalca,</HI> where the <HI>Ingas</HI> kept all manner of Ammunition for War, besides several Tombs, out of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took great Riches. This Valley is divided into several others, which for the most part produce Sugar-Canes; and through them all runs the Royal High-way, which is Wall'd in on both sides.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Nasca</HI> lie one behind another the Valleys <HI>Hacari, Oconna, Camana,</HI> and <HI>Quilca,</HI> all of them affording good Pasture for Cattel, and Fruit, yet are most of them desolate.</P>
<P>The County <HI>Los Motilonos,</HI> thinly inhabited for want of Provisions, and divided by two Rivers, separates <HI>Moyobamba</HI> from the Countrey <HI>Charasmal.</HI></P>
<P>Southward beyond <HI>Caxamalca</HI> appear the Countreys <HI>Guamachuco,</HI> and a little far∣ther <HI>Conchucos</HI> and <HI>Piscobamba,</HI> all fruitful and pleasant, and adorn'd with several Structures built by the <HI>Ingas.</HI></P>
<P>On the side of <HI>Piscobamba</HI> the County <HI>Guaraz</HI> extends it self over barren Moun∣tains, through which the <HI>Ingas</HI> cut a Royal High-way, and built a strong Castle at the Entrance into the Countrey; the Inhabitants whereof being very laborious, work very diligently in the Gold-Mines.</P>
<P>The Territory <HI>Pincos,</HI> water'd by a River, and famous for one of the stateliest of the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Structures, is surrounded by the Countreys <HI>Guayalcas, Turama, Bomba,</HI> and <HI>Conchucos.</HI> The Mountains, though dangerous to Travellers by Lyons, great Bears, and other ravenous Beasts, afford abundance of Silver; and the fruitful Soil produces Wheat, <HI>Maiz,</HI> Grapes, Figs, Oranges, Quinces, Cittrons, Cedars; and likewise feeds Goats, Horses, and other Cattel.</P>
<PB N="454" REF="292"/>
<P>The Countrey <HI>Viticos,</HI> being within the Jurisdiction of <HI>Guanuco,</HI> lies amongst the Mountains <HI>Andes,</HI> whether <HI>Inga Mango</HI> fled, when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made themselves Masters of <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chief Towns and Places of note.</NOTE>Towns and Places most observable and important in it belonging to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are 1. <HI>Miraflores,</HI> as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it, a well seated and wealthy Town in the Valley of <HI>Zanu,</HI> as above mention'd, five Leagues distant from the Sea, where it hath likewise a good Haven or Port.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Truxillo,</HI> two or three Leagues distant from the Sea; the Haven whereof is said to be large, but not safe. The Town it self is seated in the Valley <HI>Chinco,</HI> upon the Banks of a pleasant River, whose Water doth not onely run through several Chan∣nels to moisten the Fields, but also to accommodate every House in the City: It hath broad Streets, a great Market-place, four Cloysters, two for the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> one for the <HI>Augustines,</HI> and the other for the <HI>Franciscans;</HI> one great Church, five hundred Houses, and a Palace, inhabited by the King's Collectors, and many Ban∣quetting-houses about it. The good situation and fruitfulness of the Soil, mov'd the Marquess <HI>Francisco Pizarro</HI> to build this City here <HI>Anno</HI> 1533. but the Haven be∣longing to the same lies open to all manner of Winds, so that the Ships Ride here in great danger.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>La Parilla,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Santa,</HI> fourteen Leagues beyond <HI>Truxillo</HI> South∣ward, wash'd by the Southern Ocean, and one side by a fresh-water Stream, which being inclos'd between stony Cliffs, makes a secure Harbor.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Arnedo,</HI> seated ten Leagues Northward from <HI>Lima,</HI> amongst the Vineyards of the Valley <HI>Chancas;</HI> otherwise having no great matter in it remarkable, but a fair <HI>Dominican</HI> Cloyster.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Lima,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> commonly call'd <HI>La Cividad de los Reyes,</HI> or <HI>The City of Kings,</HI> so nam'd because <HI>Pizarro,</HI> who built it, laid the first Stone on <HI>Twelfth-day, Anno</HI> 1553. which they call <HI>The Feast of the Kings:</HI> It is seated in the Valley of <HI>Lima,</HI> (from whence the City is also so denominated) one of the fruitfullest Parts of all <HI>Peru,</HI> and so neatly built, that all the chief Streets of the City open upon a fair Market-place, or <HI>Piazza,</HI> of such a large Square, that upon the sides thereof are built, in a stately and convenient manner, the Cathedral, the Palace of the Arch∣bishop, the Vice-Roy's Palace and Courts of Justice, with the Exchequer or Pub∣lick Treasury, the Town-house or place where the City Magistrates meet and hold their Courts, the Publick Armory or Magazine, and a Free-School, wherein are taught by the <HI>Jesuits</HI> all Arts and Sciences, and also the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, and divers other fair Buildings of the Nobility and better sort of Citizens. No Countrey un∣der the Heavens affords a more fruitful or pleasanter Place than this; the tempe∣rate Climate neither troubling the Inhabitants with excessive Heats or great Colds, nor terrifying them with Thunder or Lightning, but having almost perpetual Sun-shine and fair Weather; onely the three Winter Moneths, wherein there falls a sweet-smelling Dew, which cures the Head-ache; and there die but very few of pestilential Distempers. The Countrey about the City is pleasant without ex∣ception. The Pigeons which are kept here in curious Houses built on purpose, flie a thousand in a Flight. The Fields abound also with Cattel. The Orchards and Gardens flourish with all sorts of Trees and Plants, whereof those that are brought hither from <HI>Spain</HI> grow better than in their natural Countrey. The West side of the City is wash'd by a pure &amp; clear Stream, which stores the Market with great plenty of good Fish, it being distant but a Musquet shot, especially when the Water rises. This River is of great consequence, for it not onely waters the whole Valley of <HI>Lima</HI> with its several Branches, but also runs under every House in the City, being
<PB N="455" REF="292"/>built on Stone Arches; they are onely one Story high, because there is no Wood to be had in the Valley of <HI>Lima</HI> but what in three years becomes all Woorm-eaten; ne∣vertheless the Houses are very beautiful both within and without; the Walls being very thick and strong, have curious Arbors of green Boughs on the top, in which the Owners shade themselves from the Sun. Most of the Houses built in the high Streets have pleasant Turrets, which face the Market-place, where all sorts of Provisions are brought to Sale, as Oxen, Sheep, Venison, Sugar, Oranges, Cittrons, Grapes, and Wheat, which is ground in Water-Mills built near the River. This City is inhabited by many able Merchants, which often load Ships to <HI>Panama,</HI> that are valu'd at above two hundred thousand <HI>Ducats.</HI> To the Arch-bishop's See of this Place belongs the Bishopricks of <HI>Chili, Charcas, Quito, Cusco, Truxillo, Guanuco, Po∣paian, San Francisco, Panama, Nicaragua,</HI> and <HI>Rio de la Plata.</HI> The City is also adorn'd with two fair Churches, besides the Cathedral, and also other lesser Churches, four stately Cloysters, two Nunneries, and the <HI>Jesuits</HI> Palace, which is very magnificent. The Haven two Leagues distant from it, and call'd <HI>Callao de Lima,</HI> is large and se∣cure for Ships. <HI>Anno</HI> 1579. Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> took twelve Ships from hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prizes taken here by Sir <HI>Fran. Drake.</HI></NOTE> one whereof was laden with Linnen and Silk, besides a great Chest full of Silver: Which Inconvenience to prevent for the future, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have built two strong Forts, and fortifi'd them with Brass Guns. Thirty years after Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s Exploit, <HI>Joris Spilbergen</HI> coming to Anchor here, found the Place all inhabited,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spilbergen</HI> at∣tempts the Place in vain.</NOTE> a Fort well stor'd with Guns, and a strong Castle before the Mouth of the Harbor, from whence they shot Bullets of thirty six Pound weight at the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and so shatter'd their Frigat, call'd <HI>The Hunter,</HI> that she could scarce-keep above Water: Fourteen <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchant-men lying near the Shore, receiv'd little damage, <HI>Spil∣bergen</HI> not being able for Shelves to get to them, neither did he judge it convenient to Land, the Vice-Roy having at that time above four thousand Men in Arms, be∣sides several Troops of Horse; wherefore after having fir'd several Guns on the Fort, and against the Church, he set Sail to <HI>Guarmey.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Cannete,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Guarco,</HI> from the Valley wherein it is situate: It was built by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> out of the Treasure which they found in the Castle afore spo∣ken of in the same Valley.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Valverde,</HI> situate in a Valley of the same Name, where excellent Fruit may be had for a small Price; it is a well Traded and rich Town, about sixteen Leagues distant from the Sea.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Pachacama,</HI> situate in a Territory of the same Name, four Leagues South∣ward of <HI>Lima,</HI> memorable chiefly for <HI>Pizarro</HI>'s good fortune here, who is reported to have found in one onely old Temple of the Natives, the quantity of nine hundred thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> of Gold and Silver, besides what his Soldiers are suppos'd to have seiz'd on, and convey'd away before he came.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Castro Verreina,</HI> threescore Leagues distant from <HI>Lima</HI> to the South-East: It lieth in the Valley of <HI>Chocolocha,</HI> and is a rich Place, by reason of the good Mines of Silver which are about it, and abundance of the best sort of Tobacco.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Miguel de la Ribera,</HI> in the Valley of <HI>Camana.</HI> The Inhabitants whereof drive a great Trade in Wine, Figs, and Raisins.</P>
<P N="11">11. The City <HI>Arequipa,</HI> which extends up towards the Mountains, is built in the Dale <HI>Quilca,</HI> which runs eleven Leagues from the Sea, under a healthful Climate; but in the Year 1582. it was wholly ruin'd by an Earthquake; the reason whereof is ascrib'd to the wet sulphurous Mountains, which burns continually, and some∣times vomits out Flames and Ashes. The Marquess <HI>Pizarro</HI> built this City forty six years before the fore-mention'd Earthquake, since which being re-built again,
<PB N="456" REF="293"/>soon attain'd to three hundred Houses, besides a Church and Cloyster; and though it be but a small Town, yet it is of a great resort, because the Gold and Silver is brought hither from the Mines <HI>Chancos, Porco,</HI> and <HI>Potosi,</HI> and from thence sent down the River <HI>Quilca,</HI> which washing the City Walls runs into the South Sea to <HI>Los Reyos,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Panama, Nombre de Dios,</HI> and <HI>New Spain.</HI> The Jurisdiction of this City <HI>Arequipa</HI> extends it self a vast way, <HI>viz.</HI> over the spacious Valleys be∣tween <HI>Hacari</HI> and <HI>Tampaca,</HI> and up in the Countrey beyond the County <HI>Condesuyo,</HI> full of Hamlets and Villages; the Inhabitants whereof heretofore worshipp'd the Sun. By the Way from <HI>Arequipa</HI> to <HI>Collao</HI> lie two great Lakes, but of one of which the River <HI>Aparima</HI> takes its original.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Caxamalca,</HI> rather a Fort than a Town, in a Territory of the same Denomi∣nation, built at the Foot of a Mountain wash'd with two Rivulets, over which lead several Bridges; near which also were formerly a stately Temple Consecrated to the Sun, wonderful Palaces and Baths for the <HI>Ingas,</HI> besides other magnificent Structures of Noble-men, which were the more famous for <HI>Attabaliba</HI>'s Imprison∣ment and Death. The Soil round about may compare with any part of the World for fertility. The Inhabitants are a peaceable ingenious People, and make curious woollen Hangings.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>St. Juan de la Frontera,</HI> built by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> North-East and by East from <HI>Caxamalca</HI> in the County <HI>Chiachinpoyas,</HI> full of Gold-Mines and Cattel; to which be∣longs not onely <HI>Chiachinpoyas,</HI> but also the Countreys <HI>Guiancas</HI> and <HI>Cascainga,</HI> out of which above twenty thousand <HI>Peruvians</HI> pay Tribute to the <HI>Spanish</HI> King. These People especially the Women, are very comely and beautiful; for which reason the <HI>Ingas</HI> fetch'd their Wives and Concubines from thence. Eastward from <HI>Frontera</HI> rise the high Mountains <HI>Andes,</HI> behind which flows the great River <HI>Mayobamba</HI> by several poor Villages inhabited by a sottish kind of People.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>San Jago de las Valles,</HI> built in an ill place amongst the Shrubs and over∣flowing Rivers. In this Countrey grows a Tree which bears a juicy Fruit, not un∣like an Almond in prickly Rinds, but resembling those which cover a Chesnut, concerning which Physicians have deliver'd their Opinions, That there is not a wholsomer Fruit in the whole World.</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>Leon de Guanuco,</HI> which receiv'd that Denomination from its Builder <HI>Vacca de Castro,</HI> who call'd it <HI>Leon,</HI> because he was born in the <HI>Spanish</HI> City <HI>Leon,</HI> and <HI>Guanuco</HI> from the stately Palace of the <HI>Ingas</HI> which was built here: The Houses are built of Free-stone, and cover'd with Thatch. The Citizens of <HI>Los Reyos</HI> were much against the building of this Town, because several Lands belonging to them were taken away and given to <HI>Guanuco,</HI> where the temperate Air grants long Life and Health to the Inhabitants. The High-way, in which stand several Store-houses, formerly full of Ammunition, runs through the middle of this Countrey, where in the time of the <HI>Ingas</HI> dwelt Astronomers, who by looking on the Stars pretended to tell future Events. Here the Women also us'd to be burnt alive with their Hus∣bands.</P>

The Woods are especially stor'd with the <HI>Coca,</HI> whose Leaf is accounted restorative, and with much excellent Venison.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The several Valleys, and other Terri∣tories be∣longing to <HI>Collao.</HI></NOTE>In this Province also there are some lesser Divisions of Countreys necessary to be describ'd, <HI>viz.</HI> the cold and barren Countrey <HI>Bambon,</HI> jutting against <HI>Guanuco,</HI> inhabited antiently by a valiant People, especially near the Lake <HI>Chincacocha,</HI> which is ten Leagues in circumference; in the middle of it are several Cliffs and little Isles: And out of this Lake also the famous River <HI>De la Plata</HI> hath its original, and runs through the Valley <HI>Xauxa,</HI> receiving by the way the Streams <HI>Parcos, Bilcas, Abancay, Apurima, Yucay,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>The next Countreys in order towards the South are <HI>Tarana,</HI> abounding with Wheat, and the eminent Valley <HI>Xauxa,</HI> surrounded with snowy Mountains. The Inhabitants by a general Name call'd <HI>Guancas,</HI> were antiently divided into three sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Maracabilca, Laxapalanga,</HI> and <HI>Xauxa.</HI> Here were also several stately Houses built by the <HI>Ingas.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Valley borders the Village <HI>Acos</HI> near a Moorish place full of Canes; but before you approach the Village you come near a high Plain, where the Ruines of an antient Structure appear; and somewhat farther the Palace <HI>Pico:</HI> from whence the High-way directs to the Bridge <HI>Angoyaca,</HI> which leads cross the River <HI>Xauxa;</HI> near which the <HI>Ingas</HI> had several magnificent Structures, and Baths of warm Springs. Not far from hence is the Village <HI>Picoy;</HI> between which and <HI>An∣goyaca</HI> the Arm of the River <HI>Xauxa</HI> is cut with a Bridge, because in the Winter it glides so swift that they cannot Ferry over it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Picoy</HI> you go to the Wild, in whole Center stands the antient Castle <HI>Pucara,</HI> (which in the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Tongue signifies <HI>Invincible Fort</HI>) where the <HI>Ingas</HI> receiv'd their Tribute from the neighboring People that live amongst the snowy Mountains.</P>
<P>The Banks of the great River <HI>Vinaque</HI> are crown'd with the Ruines of antient Structures, which (as the Natives relate) were built by foreign People; which As∣sertion of theirs seems to be confirm'd by the form and manner of Building, differ∣ing from the <HI>Ingas</HI> Structures, which us'd to be long and narrow. Moreover, seve∣ral sweet Streams, abounding with Fish, especially Crabs, glide through the Plain-Countrey out of the Mountains <HI>Andes.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from hence appears the Plain <HI>Chapas,</HI> and the Palaces <HI>Pilcas,</HI> of which now nothing remains but a heap of Rubbish, which lies in the Center of <HI>Peru.</HI> A fresh-water River, which gives the fore-mention'd Palaces their Denomination, glides out of <HI>Soras,</HI> and washes the High-way and stately Temple of the Sun.</P>
<P>The Countrey <HI>Soras,</HI> exceeding fertile, and stock'd with Gold and Silver Mines, is inhabited by a People which go Cloth'd in woollen Cloth, and for their Valor formerly much esteem'd by the <HI>Ingas.</HI></P>
<P>Those that inhabit the Countrey <HI>Uramar</HI> are call'd <HI>Chancas,</HI> whose Neighbors possess a long Tract of Land abounding with Cattel and Fruit, but of late are most of them destroy'd by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Abanca,</HI> which takes its original in the Mountainous County <HI>Parina∣cocha,</HI> washes several Royal Buildings, and at last discharges its Waters into the Ri∣ver <HI>Xauxa.</HI></P>
<P>On each side of the great River <HI>Apurima</HI> are erected two wonderful Stone Pillars,

<P>Eastward from <HI>Cusco,</HI> behind the <HI>Andes,</HI> are many large Countreys, which to dis∣cover the <HI>Spaniards</HI> spar'd neither trouble, danger, nor charge: between both they found vast Wildernesses, inaccessible Mountains, and overgrown Countreys; yet at last they opened four ways thither: the first whereof runs through the Valley <HI>Paquil</HI> to <HI>Tono,</HI> a Village in the middle of the Mountains; from thence to the River <HI>Opotazi,</HI> along which it is very troublesom travelling, because of the thick Woods and steep Rocks: lastly to the hot and fruitful Valley <HI>Abisca,</HI> and so to vast Wilder∣nesses, overgrown with Brambles and Bushes, which prevented any farther Disco∣very. The second Way runs thirty Leagues farther to the Southward, through the Countreys <HI>Sandia, Camata</HI> and <HI>Caravaya,</HI> to <HI>Zama.</HI> Through this Way, <HI>Anno</HI> 1538. <HI>Peter Anzurez</HI> travell'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Peter Anzu∣rez</HI> his Jour∣ney.</NOTE> setting out from <HI>Zama,</HI> he found many desolate Mountains, barren Wilds, and close Woods, through which he entred into the County <HI>Tacana,</HI> and from thence to the River <HI>Omapalchas,</HI> inhabited on both sides by the <HI>Cheriabones</HI> and <HI>Marquires,</HI> who oppos'd him in his crossing over the River; but meeting with no∣thing but barren Commons, he travell'd up along the River, and view'd the Coun∣treys <HI>Moios, Cochabamba,</HI> and <HI>Chuguiabo,</HI> from whence he return'd to <HI>Collao,</HI> having lost most of his People by Hunger and Hardship.

<P>This Town was long since inhabited by two thousand <HI>Spaniards</HI> at least, and twice as many Natives.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Cusco,</HI> which is the Metropolis of the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> built on a hard Ground, surrounded with Mountains, under a cold, yet wholsom Climate, and wash'd by two Rivers, which on the East side of <HI>Cusco</HI> parting, one runs direct West, and the other Southward.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The original of the City <HI>Cusco,</HI></NOTE> One part of the City antiently bore the Denomi∣nation of <HI>Haran-Cusco,</HI> and the second, <HI>Oren-Cusco,</HI> where the chief Nobility and most antient Families dwelt. Concerning the original of this Place, the <HI>Peruvians</HI> say, That several Ages past there appear'd three Men, call'd <HI>Ayrache, Aranca,</HI> and <HI>Ajarmango,</HI> and with them three Women, nam'd <HI>Mamacola, Mamacona,</HI> and <HI>Mamara∣gua,</HI> all of them very richly Cloth'd; that <HI>Ayrache</HI> had a Precious Stone at the end of a Truncheon, which by holding up he rais'd the Mountains to the Skies, and when he let it fall, levell'd them with the lowest Valleys: <HI>Aranca</HI> and <HI>Ajarmango</HI> concluded to build a stately City, and sent for People from remote Countries to inhabit it; with which Design the Natives thereabouts seem'd to be well pleas'd: but before they went to work they judg'd it convenient to destroy <HI>Ayrache,</HI> whose great Power they envy'd: This being resolv'd upon, they invited him to a deep narrow-mouth'd Cave, that there they might worship the Sun his Father (for so Descended he took upon him to be), he was no sooner entred but the rest shut the Mouth of the Cave with great Stones, hoping so to starve him to death; which <HI>Ayrache</HI> observing, stood amaz'd a while, till at last he threw off all the Stones, and flew with great and divers colour'd Wings up into the Air, crying aloud, <HI>Fear not,</HI> Aranca <HI>and</HI> Ajarmango, <HI>though you have design'nd to take away my Life, but build a City in this place, and call it</HI> Cusco; <HI>for in it shall stand the Seat of the</HI> Ingas, <HI>under whose Jurisdicti∣on on extending far and near, many great Nations shall bow. The Temple which the Gods have there design'd shall not onely exceed all other Structures in the World, in Art and Costliness, but be famous for strange Offerings to the Sun. If the Citizens build Altars for me, burn Myrrh, and make Offer∣ings to me, they may certainly expect to vanquish all their Enemies, and increase their Power. According to my Example bore Holes through your Ears, as a sign of Obedience.</HI> All which <HI>Aranca, Ajarmango,</HI> and the fore-mention'd Women promis'd to perform. Where∣upon <HI>Ayrache</HI> gave them a rich Diadem with a Tassel, which was to be the Head-Ornament of the succeeding <HI>Ingas;</HI> which they had no sooner receiv'd, but <HI>Ayrache</HI> and <HI>Aranca</HI> were turn'd into Stones, yet retaining their former shape; which <HI>Ajar∣mango</HI> observing, fell straight, together with the three Women, upon building the City <HI>Cusco.</HI> After the Deluge breaking out of the Hole <HI>Tambo,</HI> he chang'd his Name of <HI>Ajarmango</HI> for <HI>Mangocapa,</HI> that is, <HI>Mighty Lord,</HI> and made himself, as they say, the first <HI>Peruvian</HI> King. The City <HI>Cusco</HI> was divided into four Wards, the East call'd <HI>Andosayo,</HI> the South <HI>Callasayo</HI> the North, <HI>Chinchasuyo,</HI> and the West <HI>Condesayo,</HI> every one one so call'd from the Countreys, to which the Gates of the four Wards are oppos'd.</P>

<PB N="460" REF="297"/>daily, he was permitted to dwell no where but in that Ward which fronted his na∣tive Countrey. The four high Streets, which through, these Wards one way fall in∣to the Market-place, being in the middle of the City, are the other way answera∣ble to the four principal High-ways, <HI>viz.</HI> that which leads to <HI>Quito</HI> and <HI>Pasto,</HI> through <HI>Chinchasuyo;</HI> to <HI>Arehuipa,</HI> through <HI>Condesuyo;</HI> to the Mountains <HI>Andes,</HI> through <HI>Andesuyo;</HI> and to <HI>Chili,</HI> through <HI>Collasuyo.</HI> The two Rivers before mention'd, which part at the East end of the City, are pass'd over with divers Bridges. The narrow Streets are full of Stone Houses, built in good Order. In several places are Vaulted Cellars under Ground, in some of which are buried great Treasures: they had been formerly the Habitations for Necromancers and Soothsayers; for this sort of People were once in great esteem amongst the Inhabitants, who co∣ming from <HI>Chili, Pasto, Bocamores, Topona, Bombon, Charcas, Collao, Chiachiapoias, Con∣chucos,</HI> and other <HI>Peruvian</HI> Countreys, receive great benefit from the fresh Water, and from the Corn-Mills built on the Streets through the City.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient Places and other stately Structures in <HI>Cusco▪</HI></NOTE>The stately Palaces which the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Nobility have at several times built in <HI>Oren-Cusco,</HI> being one part of the City, are very wonderful, the Owners whereof were forc'd by the <HI>Ingas</HI> to appear at Court at Set-times, that so he might prevent all In∣surrections: Also he caus'd the Children of the prime Lords to be brought up in <HI>Cusco,</HI> under pretence that they might learn the <HI>Cuscoan</HI> Tongue perfectly, in which the <HI>Ingas</HI> would always be spoken to; whenas their Design was to keep them as Hostages in their own Jurisdictions, that their Fathers might not rebel; by which means it hapned, that in most places of <HI>Peru,</HI> which amongst the several Tribes and Principalities had several Languages, the <HI>Cuscoan</HI> Tongue was understood and spo∣ken. But the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who are the present Possessors thereof, have alter'd and re∣pair'd most of the ordinary Houses, which are now neatly built of Stone. Above all the old Structures, the Palace of the <HI>Ingas,</HI> and the Temple of the Sun, are the most magnificent; the Palace lies inclos'd within a square quadruple Wall, each corner whereof is adorn'd and strengthned with a Tower: The Palace it self is built round, and with Arches; but that which chiefly amazes the Beholder, is to see how the Stones, which are so big that forty Horses are notable to stir one of them out of its place, were brought thither by the Labor of the Builders from the neighboring Mountains; for the <HI>Peruvians</HI> never made use of any laboring Beast, except their Sheep <HI>Pacos,</HI> not knowing the use of Horses, Camels, Oxen, Ele∣phants, or the like, before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> coming thither. The Halls within the Pa∣lace were Wainscoted with Golden Plates: yet the <HI>Inga</HI>'s Apparel was not answer∣able to the rest of his Pomp; for in stead of a Crown they bound their Heads about with a red woollen Sash, with which they almost cover'd their Eyes; at the end of the Sash hung certain Ribbands, which they gave the Governor as occasi∣on offer'd, that by this Sign, as by a Commission, they might exercise their Offices; the sight of which String caus'd such Obedience, that if the <HI>Inga</HI> had commanded the Inhabitants of a Town or Countrey to murder themselves, none durst deny. The <HI>Inga</HI> was generally carried by a hundred of his Noble-men, of whom if any one had accidentally chanc'd to stumble, he was immediately put to death.

As to what concerns the famous Mountain <HI>Potosi</HI> in the Countrey of <HI>Charcas,</HI> it is of an Ash colour, and rises above the adjacent Mountains in the form of a Sugar-Loaf; on the top of it stands a Chappel, to which leads a craggy Path, which with a little care may be rid up with a Horse; the heighth thereof is a thou∣sand six hundred and twenty four Rods, or a quarter of a League: at the Foot thereof appears the Mine call'd <HI>Guaina Potosi,</HI> that is, <HI>The young Potosi;</HI> near which the City <HI>Potosi</HI> stands, being two Leagues in circumference, and is adorn'd with a Church and Cloyster for the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> and exceedingly resorted to by Traders.</P>
<P>In the time when the <HI>Ingas</HI> Govern'd <HI>Peru,</HI> the Silver-Mines at <HI>Porco</HI> were very famous; but it was not till after the arrival of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that Silver was found in <HI>Guaina Potosi,</HI> and by degrees the Silver Veins which lay hid in the great <HI>Potosi;</HI> the manner of which Discovery was as followeth:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The occasion of the first Discovery of the Mines in <HI>Potosi.</HI></NOTE>A <HI>Peruvian</HI> call'd <HI>Gualpa,</HI> who work'd in the Mines at <HI>Porco,</HI> going a Hunting, it chanc'd that the Game ran up the steep Mountain of <HI>Potosi,</HI> which prevented his pursuing of it any farther; but the Mountain being overgrown with Trees, he got hold from one Bough to another to help himself up, and at last taking hold of the Bramble call'd <HI>Quinua,</HI> he pull'd the same out of the Ground, and finding it heavy, look'd upon it, and espy'd a great lump of Silver hanging at the Root of it; whereupon viewing the Hole, he discover'd a rich Silver Vein; of which taking some pieces home, and melting them, he found that it was the best Sil∣ver that ever he had known; wherefore he privately got a greater quantity, and by degrees grew extraordinary rich: but though he carried his Design never so close, yet he was at last suspected, and especially by his Neighbor <HI>Guanca,</HI> born in the Valley <HI>Xauxa,</HI> who was the more jealous of him, because he sold greater Bars of Silver than any were cast at <HI>Porco;</HI> whereupon he resolv'd to speak to him, and
<PB N="464" REF="302"/>getting out the Secret, it came to this Agreement between them, That they should both be Partners and share the Booty; <HI>Gualpa</HI> was to keep the Vein, since call'd <HI>The Rich Vein,</HI> and <HI>Guanca</HI> was to have another, at present nam'd <HI>Diego Centeno:</HI> but they agreed not long; for <HI>Guanca</HI> finding much labor upon his Vein, by reason of the hardness, and that he could get no share in what <HI>Gualpa</HI> got, acquainted his <HI>Spanish</HI> Master <HI>Vilaroel</HI> with it, who rested not till he had found out the truth there∣of; for which <HI>Vilaroel</HI> obtain'd (according to the Custom of <HI>Porco</HI>) several Rods to work for himself, onely paying the King one fifth part of what he got, and so re∣main'd Owner of the Mine <HI>Centeno.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mine <HI>Potesi,</HI> when discover'd.</NOTE>This Discovery of the rich Mine <HI>Potosi</HI> is said to have hapned on the twenty fourth of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 1545. Soon after which they found the Silver Vein <HI>Del Estanno,</HI> which though it was very rich, was difficult to be digg'd, because of its hardness. The first Vein which <HI>Gualpa</HI> search'd after stood upright from the bottom of the Mine, and contain'd above three hundred Foot in length, and thirteen in breadth, and continuing good for two hundred Foot in depth, after which the Silver begins to lessen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peruvians</HI> relate, That the <HI>Ingas</HI> first began to dig in <HI>Potosi,</HI> but gave it over because the Workmen heard a terrible Voice, saying, <HI>Leave off doing what you are about; the Treasures which lie hid here, are reserv'd for a People out of foreign Countreys.</HI></P>
<P>These Mines produce yearly for the King's fifth part, forty thousand Pieces of Silver, each valu'd at thirteen <HI>Ryals,</HI> each <HI>Ryal</HI> being four Shillings, besides what he is defrauded of, which is perhaps half as much more.</P>
<P>The Mines of <HI>Potosi</HI> exceed all other, because the Diggers never meet with any Water, notwithstanding they work above two hundred Fathom under Ground, whereas the other Silver Mines suffer great damage by the Water; which was also the reason why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> left off digging of Silver in <HI>Porco,</HI> because they were not onely forc'd to cut through hard Rocks, but ran greater danger, or at least be∣stow'd extraordinary labor to get out the Water which broke in upon them.</P>

Each Vein is divided into several parts, possess'd by several Owners; the least part is open'd four Rods, and the biggest eighty; for none are permitted by the Law to open a bigger Hole.

It is a wonderful thing to consider, how the <HI>Peruvians</HI> are able to scramble up and down continually a hundred and fifty Fathom: But besides many other Inconveniences, the Mines often fall in, or at least great pieces, which bury all the Diggers. The Mines also, being excessive cold, occasion to those that are not us'd to them, a <HI>Vertigo</HI> in the Head, and Vomiting. The Silver runs for the most part between two Rocks, as it were, in a long Channel, of which one side is as hard as Flint, and the other much softer. This Silver is of different value; the belt, call'd <HI>Cacilla</HI> or <HI>Tacana,</HI> resembles Amber in colour; the worser sort is blackish, and sometimes of an Ash-colour. The pieces of Oar are carry'd on the Backs of the Sheep <HI>Pacos</HI> to the Mill, where being ground to Powder, they are put into Furnaces to melt; of which there were once above six thousand on the top of <HI>Potosi;</HI> but since the Quick∣silver was found to cleanse the same, not a third part remains pure.</P>
<P>In former times the Mines at <HI>Porco,</HI> two Leagues from the little Lake <HI>Aulagas,</HI> produc'd those vast Treasures gather'd by the <HI>Ingas,</HI> which afterwards for the most part fell into the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Port-Towns, Rivers, and Havens of <HI>Los Charcas.</HI></NOTE>As concerning the Sea-Coast of <HI>Los Charcas,</HI> it lies as followeth: Southerly from the River <HI>Tambopalla</HI> puts forth a three-pointed Rock into the Ocean, and makes the Haven <HI>De Ylo,</HI> into which falls a fresh River. Next follow the round Hill <HI>Morro de los Diabolos,</HI> and the Inlet before the Town <HI>Arica,</HI> secur'd from all ex∣cept a Westerly Wind, where the Silver that comes from <HI>Potosi</HI> is Shipp'd for <HI>Lima.</HI> Since the <HI>English</HI> Admiral Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> took three Barks out of this Inlet it is fortifi'd with a Castle, which is stor'd with Brass Guns.</P>
<P>Nine Leagues Southward the <HI>Pissaqua</HI> falls into the Ocean; and next you come to the little Village <HI>Hicahic,</HI> situate on a high and barren Tract of Land; as also the Haven <HI>Terrapaca,</HI> which by an Inland is made very secure.</P>
<P>Not far from hence appears the Foot of <HI>Piqua,</HI> where the Coast begins to rise very high; the Head of <HI>Tacama,</HI> the Stream <HI>Lottoya,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>De Loa,</HI> whose Banks are inhabited by poor People; the River <HI>Montelo,</HI> the Promontory <HI>Morro Moreno,</HI> beyond whose utmost Point opens a Bay, secur'd from all Winds by an Island. The Inhabitants here feed on raw Fish.</P>
<P>Next the River <HI>Claru</HI> comes in view, which is taken for a Boundary between <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili.</HI></P>
<P>Eastward up into the Countrey you come to <HI>Santa Cruiz,</HI> built at the Foot of a Mountain in a Plain near a Brook, which rushing forth from a Rock glides through the City to a Lake full of delicious Fish. The Houses of Stone, are covered with Palm-Tree Leaves. and besides the Church there is also a Cloyster, inhabited by the Monks <HI>De la Merced,</HI> In former times the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Houses were built of Clay, and were often destroy'd by their Neighbors the <HI>Cheriguanacs</HI> and <HI>Titanes,</HI> who made Feasts with as many as they took of them. The People about this Place are meek and poor spirited, and speak besides four Languages, the <HI>Diagnitan</HI> Tongue, com∣mon amongst all of them. Before the Arrival of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> they went Cloth'd in Ostritch'es Feathers, but since taught to weave Cotton, they now make their Apparel of the same, and upon the account of Barter, drive a great Trade in it:
<PB N="466" REF="303"/>They Dye their Cotton with the boyl'd Roots and Leaves of a little Tree.</P>
<P>Eastward beyond <HI>Santa Cruiz</HI> lies the Countrey <HI>Paicanos,</HI> eminent for the great <HI>Calabashes</HI> which grow there, exceeding good to keep both wet and dry Meats in.</P>
<P>The Countrey receives a vicissitude of excessive Cold and intolerable Heat; the hard Winters taking beginning in <HI>May,</HI> and continuing till the beginning of <HI>August.</HI> In the middle of our Summer a South-wind blows seven Weeks together here, to the great prejudice of all Plants, which are during that time often wash'd away by continual Rains. About <HI>Christmas</HI> they Sowe, and gather in their Harvest in <HI>March.</HI> During the rainy Season the Ways cannot be travell'd, being all overflow'd by the Rivers; neither doth the <HI>Palm-Wood,</HI> which is four days Journey in length, permit any access to the said City <HI>Santa Cruiz,</HI> because the conflux of Waters makes it a Moor all over; besides which, the Tygers Bears, and Serpents, make the Ways dangerous, especially at that time.</P>
<P>Through this Countrey the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain <HI>Nusco de Chavas</HI> travell'd, when he discover'd the <HI>Taguamacis,</HI> a numerous People, which dwell along the great River <HI>De la Plata.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey about <HI>Santa Cruiz</HI> produces all manner of Fruit, but few Trees, because of the want of Rain; but Corn, <HI>Maiz,</HI> Wine, <HI>Granadillas, Luiumas,</HI> and <HI>Tu∣cumay,</HI> as also the Plant <HI>Hachalindi,</HI> in the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Mirabile Peruanum,</HI> grow here in great abundance; which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shoots up to the bigness of a pretty large Body, full of Juice, and of a yellowish colour, out of which shoot knotty Boughs, and about each Knot two Leaves resembling the Herb <HI>Nightshade;</HI> the Flowers which hang at the ends of the Boughs are long, and pleasant to the Eye, by reason of their mixture of Purple, White, and Yellow, and also of a sweet smell. It is a strange Secret in Nature, that this Flower opens at Midnight, if any Light come near the same: The Root also is accounted an effectual Medicine against the Dropsie.</P>

The Countrey is generally plain, commo∣diously water'd in all Parts with fresh Rivers, and consequently affording rich Pa∣sturage and good Herds of Cattel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chief Towns and Places of note.</NOTE>The Chief Towns and Places of note are, 1. <HI>Chuquinga,</HI> a great Town, and held to be naturally almost impregnable, as being environ'd round about either with deep unfordable Waters, or with Mountains unpassable, and having one onely Cawsey leading to it, reported to be for two or three Leagues together no broader than to permit one single Person to march conveniently upon it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The City <HI>Pucara,</HI> which was formerly well inhabited, but at present nothing remains of it, except the ruin'd Walls of great Houses, and large Images of Stone.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Ayavire,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call'd <HI>Las Sepulturas,</HI> being a Place especially enobled by the stately Monuments of the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Nobility which were found there.</P>

<P>The River <HI>Caravaya,</HI> which glides from the <HI>Andes</HI> Eastward to the City <HI>Juan del Oro,</HI> produces much fine Gold, but not without the loss of many People, which are kill'd by the unwholsom Air and Damps that arise here.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lake <HI>Ti∣ticaca.</HI></NOTE>The Lake <HI>Titicaca,</HI> which washes the Countrey <HI>Collao</HI> on the North, the Province of <HI>Omasuy</HI> on the East, <HI>Chaquito</HI> on the West, and <HI>Chuquiabo</HI> on the South, is one of the greatest Lakes of <HI>America,</HI> being eighty Leagues in circumference, and in seve∣ral places as many Fathom deep; wherefore it is exceeding rough in windy Wea∣ther. Into this Lake ten great Rivers discharge their Waters, which run away again through a narrow, but very deep Channel, in which the Stream runs so strong, that no Boats are able to abide in it.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Chinquita,</HI> a Colony of <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon the Banks of <HI>Titiaca,</HI> having many small Islands in it of a good and fruitful Soil, abounding in Fish and variety of Sea-Fowl; it is suppos'd to be fourscore Leagues distant likewise from the South Sea, haying onely one <HI>Estuary</HI> or Mouth, which is something strait, but of such a deep Water and violent Stream, that (as <HI>Acosta</HI> testifieth of it) it is not possible to build a Bridge of Stone or Timber over it; but the Natives in stead thereof have laid a Bridge of Straw upon it, which serves as well, <HI>viz.</HI> so many great Bundles of Straw, Sedge, or such like matter, well and surely made up and fastned together, as will reach from one side or Bank of the <HI>Estuary</HI> to another ; at which likewise ha∣ving made them sure, they cast some good quantity of more Straw and Sedge up∣on them, and have a Bridge very convenient, upon which they both securely pass themselves, and also drive Cattel, and do other necessary Business. The Water is neither bitter nor brackish, yet is not drinkable because of its muddiness. Several Islands that lie in the Lake serv'd formerly for Store-houses of the chiefest Goods, which the People thereabouts living near the High-way would not trust in their Villages.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plant <HI>Totara.</HI></NOTE>Here grows a certain Broom-Plant call'd <HI>Totara,</HI> good for many uses, and is also wholsom Food both for Man and Beast; moreover, they cover their Houses with the same, burn it on their Hearths, and make Boats. The <HI>Uros,</HI> a salvage People, made Floats of <HI>Totara,</HI> which they ty'd together, and built Villages on the same, which drove to and again, according as the Wind blew.</P>
<P>The Lake also breeds abundance of Fish, and especially two sorts, <HI>viz. Suches,</HI> which are very pleasing to the Palate, but unwholsom; and the <HI>Bogas,</HI> which though less, and full of Bones, are a much better Food. There likewise breed plenty of Fowls about the same, especially wild Geese and Ducks.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Peruvians</HI> intend to Entertain any Person, they go to catching of Fowls (by them call'd <HI>Chaco</HI>) after this manner: They make a Circle with the Floats nam'd <HI>Balsas,</HI> and Rowing close to one another, take up the inclos'd Fowl with their Hands.</P>
<P>Moreover, the fore-mention'd Channel, through which the Lake <HI>Titicaca</HI> dis∣charges its Water, ends in a little Lake call'd <HI>Aulagas,</HI> likewise full of desolate Isles, but hath no visible place into which to empty its Water, therefore it must needs, according to the course of Nature, fall under Ground, where it commixes with a Stream whose original is unknown, though it be seen to fall into the South Sea.</P>
<P>The Town is a Place of extraordinary Wealth and Trading, and so consider∣able, that the Governor thereof is always nam'd by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> himself, and his Place estimated at fifty thousand Ducats <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Tiaguanaco,</HI> at the <HI>Estuary,</HI> or Mouth of the Lake, memorable onely for the Ruines of certain great and stupendious Buildings which antiently have stood there, some of the Stones whereof are said to have been of thirty Foot length
<PB N="468" REF="306"/>apiece, fifteen Foot broad, and six or seven Foot thick. There were likewise found the Statues of certain Men excellently Carv'd and Wrought, of a Gigantick stature or bigness, and likewise vested in foreign and strange Habits, not at all us'd, nor ever known to have been us'd by the <HI>Peruvians</HI> themselves, or by any other of the Natives of <HI>America.</HI></P>

The Inhabitants being very poor People, us'd to go naked in the Sum∣mer Season.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Copavana,</HI> two and twenty Leagues beyond <HI>Lopoz:</HI> It is onely inhabited by <HI>Peruvians;</HI> amongst whom an Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> long since erected there, hath been ever in great veneration, especially by reason of a Tradition of a great Miracle there perform'd: for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> affirm, That <HI>Johannes Anachoreta</HI> going a Journey of several Weeks from home, plac'd a lighted Candle before the Image, which during the time of his absence did not at all diminish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Earthquake at <HI>Angoanga.</HI></NOTE>An Accident which fell out in this Countrey is very remarkable, <HI>viz.</HI> The Ground of an old Village call'd <HI>Angoanga,</HI> then inhabited by eminent Necroman∣cers, began on a sudden to swell, and the Earth to run like a broken Wave two Leagues, overwhelming the Houses in Sand, and filling up a neighboring Lake.</P>

Some relate, that <HI>Guainacava,</HI> when he return'd Victor from the conquer'd Countrey <HI>Quito,</HI> suffer'd great Inconveniences on the pathless Mountains, and thereupon commanded his Subjects to make the fore-mention'd Way. But it is more probable, that this Master-piece was not the work of one <HI>Inga,</HI> especially since besides the Way from <HI>Chili</HI> to <HI>Quito</HI> there leads another through the Mountains over the Plains from <HI>Cusco</HI> to <HI>Quito,</HI> forty Foot broad, and five hundred Leagues long, inclos'd within two Walls.</P>

Afterwards travelling to <HI>Moyabamba,</HI> he got a great esteem amongst those Idolaters, and (as it goes for currant amongst them) wrought many Miracles, amongst which this is reported for one: He being inform'd by an old <HI>Peruvian,</HI> that his Daughter nam'd <HI>Curi</HI> had hid several Idols; enquiring after it, he tax'd her with what her Father had told him; which she denying, and being rebuk'd by <HI>Ramirez,</HI> is said to have become immediately dumb, to have foam'd at the Mouth, at last falling down dead like a second <HI>Saphira</HI> in the presence of many, which caus'd many to forsake their Idolatry. But the Necromancers endeavor'd by all means possible to raise a disesteem on <HI>Ramirez,</HI> and with the assistance of their Master the Devil, so wrought their Inchantments, that the Tygers came in great Herds out of the Wildernesses to <HI>Moyabamba,</HI> and devour'd not onely Men, Women and Children in the High∣ways, but also tore them out of their Houses, yet did not the least hurt to any <HI>Spa∣niard;</HI> whereupon <HI>Ramirez</HI> valiantly went with a Company of his Proselytes to a Herd of Tygers, which when he approached held the Cross to them, which it seems so affrighted the Devil-Tygers, that they climb'd up the Trees. They farther relate (if you will believe them) to make the Miracle the greater, That <HI>Ramirez</HI> call'd to the Multitude, saying, <HI>Go and revenge the Deaths of your devour'd Pa∣rents, Children and Relations;</HI> whereupon he throwing a Stone, and all the rest fol∣lowing his Example, the Tygers leap'd out of the Trees, stood still, and suffer'd themselves to be kill'd like Lambs. Six years after the fore-mention'd twelve <HI>Au∣gustine</HI> Monks follow'd eleven others, who set Sail out of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Haven <HI>St. Lucar,</HI> and arriving at <HI>Peru</HI> went to the Village <HI>Tauca,</HI> where they broke the Image of the Goddess <HI>Huarella,</HI> being as it were the <HI>Peruvian Venus,</HI> or Patroness of amorous De∣lights, reported to have given Responses from the Wood in which she was wor∣shipp'd. They also destroy'd the Idol <HI>Chanca</HI> in the Countrey <HI>Conchucos,</HI> which be∣ing worshipp'd by the <HI>Indians</HI> in the shape of a Man, had yearly a fair Maid, aged fourteen years, given to him in Marriage, a solemn Wedding being kept, and seve∣ral Sheep kill'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Miracle of an <HI>Augu∣stine</HI> Monk.</NOTE>The <HI>Augustine</HI> Monks are believ'd to have wrought also another Miracle in the Province <HI>Conchucos,</HI> upon this occasion: A Conjurer call'd <HI>Chaumango,</HI> boasted him∣self to be <HI>God,</HI> deny'd our <HI>Saviour,</HI> in testimony whereof he gave out that he would kick a Mountain to pieces, with his Foot; which Report spreading all over the Countrey, all the adjacent People flock'd to see this strange Wonder on an appointed Day, on which <HI>Charimango</HI> being, it seems, as good as his word, and kicking the Mountain, caus'd it to rent from the top to the bottom, and the pieces to flie all about the People, who were exceedingly amaz'd; but the Sorcerer upon the <HI>Augu∣stine</HI> Monk's rebuking him was (as they affirm) immediately eaten up with Worms.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Description of <HI>Chile.</HI></NOTE>FOllowing the Coast of <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> or the South Sea, the next great Province pertaining formerly to the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> is that of <HI>Chile.</HI> This is the most Southerly Province of the whole Countrey of <HI>America,</HI> reaching up as far as the <HI>Magellane</HI> Straights, with which to the Southward it is bounded; North∣ward it hath a Desart, and an undiscover'd Countrey lying betwixt it and the Con∣fines of <HI>Peru,</HI> call'd <HI>Atacama;</HI> on the West it hath <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> and on the East, up to <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> or North Sea, with some Countreys undiscover'd, which interpose betwixt it and <HI>Paraguay</HI> to the North-East: It lieth all of it be∣yond the <HI>Tropick</HI> of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> in a temperate <HI>Zone,</HI> and extendeth it self in length from the Borders of <HI>Peru,</HI> to the Mouth of the <HI>Straights</HI> five hundred Leagues or more; but the breadth of it neither equal nor certain: They say 'tis call'd <HI>Chile</HI> from the word <HI>Chil,</HI> which signifies <HI>Cold</HI> it seems in their Language as well as ours, it being generally a cold and bleak Countrey, the Air in many parts of it so ex∣treamly sharp and piercing, that both Horse and Rider sometimes in travelling are frozen to death, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found by experience in their first Search and Disco∣very of the Countrey, under the Conduct of <HI>Diego Almagro,</HI> who is said to have left the greatest part of his Men dead behind him: But this is chiefly towards the <HI>Andes,</HI> and on the Sea-Coast, the more Inland parts of it, though mountainous also in some parts, yet are more temperate, and being also well water'd with Rivers, are much more fruitfull than the other, affording both Wheat and <HI>Maiz,</HI> and likewise other Grain, excellent Pasturage in many places, and great store of Cattel, Wine, Honey, and not without many and rich Mines both of Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>The Natives of this Countrey were found to be the most stout and warlike of all the <HI>Americans</HI> that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had hitherto met withal, fighting with them, and oftentimes defeating them in the open Field, surprizing and sacking their Towns, and last of all taking their Captain and Commander in Chief Prisoner: This was <HI>Pedro Baldivia,</HI> one of those good Men that consented to the death of <HI>Atta∣baliba,</HI> the last King of <HI>Peru,</HI> after a greater Ransom accepted and paid, then per∣haps the King of <HI>Spain</HI> could well raise on a sudden, if he had occasion to use it for himself.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pedro Baldi∣via</HI> taken Prisoner and put to death by the <HI>Aru∣cans.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Arucans</HI> (for so are the People call'd that had him Prisoner) are said to have Entertain'd him for a while with great Jollity and Feasting, but for his last Draught gave him a Cup of melted Gold, which the poor Man was forc'd to take down, and so died a cruel, though costly Death.</P>

<P>VVE have seen in <HI>Magellanica</HI> the farthest, that is, the most Southerly part of the <HI>New World,</HI> and before it in order all the Western Coasts of <HI>America</HI> that lie either upon or towards <HI>Mare del Zur, viz.</HI> from <HI>Pa∣nama,</HI> the first Province of this Southern part down as far as the <HI>Straights.</HI> We are now to return and take a view of the Eastern Coasts, and those Countreys which lie upon the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, steering our Course henceforth Northward, not di∣rectly, but as the Coast leads us for a while Eastward and by North, forasmuch as the Land of <HI>America,</HI> from the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellan</HI> up as far as <HI>Brasile,</HI> and almost to the <HI>AEquator,</HI> runneth out with a long Point, little less than three thousand Leagues together.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Description of <HI>Paraguay,</HI> or <HI>Rio de la Plata.</HI></NOTE>The first Province we meet with on this side next to <HI>Magellanica,</HI> is the Countrey of <HI>Paraguay,</HI> oftentimes call'd <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> from the Name of an huge River, which runneth for the most part through the midst of it: It is border'd, as we said, to the South and towards the <HI>Straights</HI> with <HI>Magellanica;</HI> on the East, with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean; more Northward, or to the North-East, it hath <HI>Brasile;</HI> and on the West those undiscover'd Countreys of the Province of <HI>Chile,</HI> of which we have spoken.</P>
<P>The Countrey on both sides the River is reported to be a very lusty and fruitful Soil, bearing besides those which are proper and native, all sorts of <HI>European</HI> Fruits and Grain in great abundance, with Sugar-Canes, both large and good, as any other Province of the <HI>New World.</HI> Nor is it excell'd by any other for good Pasturage and great Herds of Cattel, Sheep, and Swine; in particular, Horses are said to have multiply'd so here, that of thirty Mares, and about six or seven Stal∣lions, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> left there, in forty years the whole Countrey thereabouts was fill'd with the Breed of them, running wild in great Companies together, through all the Woods and Forrests of the Countrey, and being of excellent Met∣tle and Service if they could be tam'd. It affordeth likewise great store of wild Deer and Stags, some Lyons, Tygers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor is it without good Mines, some both of Gold and Silver; but chiefly, as to what is yet discover'd, of Brass, and Iron; and the People altogether salvage.</P>

<P>The <HI>United Netherlands</HI> also sent Colonies thither with good success, for they took several vast Countreys from the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> by force of Arms, and built new Forts and Towns in several places. But we will first give you a general Description of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperature of Cli∣mate.</NOTE> that so we may the better render a Relation in particular of every Province thereof, it being a considerable part of the <HI>New World,</HI> and both pleasant and fruit∣ful, and the Sea-Coasts refresh'd by Easterly Winds, which begin before Day∣break, when the North Sea ebbs or flows, for then the Wind rises with the Sun, and continues till Mid-night: Towards the West, where the Mountains divide <HI>Brasile</HI> from <HI>Peru,</HI> it is made temperate by Westerly Winds, which though judg'd unwhol∣som, because they seem to arise out of the Moorish Grounds, yet they hurt not the Inhabitants along that Coast, because they either break against the high Moun∣tains, or are driven by the strong Wind which blows from the Sea.</P>
<P>The difference between Summer and Winter, shorter and longer Days, in the main part of <HI>Brasile,</HI> is scarce discernable, warm Weather lasting all the year round; and for the length of the Day and Night, the Sun being hid under the Horizon twelve hours, shines for the most part just as long, the greatest difference never being above an hour. Three hours before Day-break the Dew makes it exceeding cold till Sun-rising; wherefore the <HI>Brasilians</HI> make Fires in the Night near their Hammocks, not onely to keep wild Beasts from them, but also against the Cold. After the coldest Nights follow the fairest Days, and the contrary after sultry Nights; nevertheless (except in the rainy Season, which begins with <HI>March</HI> and ends about <HI>August</HI>) the Skye is generally clear, yet it Lightens much towards the Evening. Rainbowes often appear in the Skye, and bout the Mooon <HI>Halos.</HI> The Rain generally falls in great Drops, and with a mighty noise; before which it is generally very sultry hot, or else soon after. The Dew, which is fruit∣fuller than in <HI>Europe,</HI> is saltish, which makes it oft to rot things that lie in the open Air. During the rainy Moneths, a South-East Winds blows from a cloudy Skye, much stronger than the Northern in Summer, The South-East Wind drives the Stream to the North, as the North Wind drives it to the South: And more than this, there is little to be discern'd of the Seas ebbing and flowing hereabouts: At the highest Tides the <HI>Brasilians</HI> go several Leagues from the Shore to Fish, upon Planks made of the spungy Wood call'd <HI>Jangada</HI> fastned together. The Sea, which seems to burn in the Night, is so clear in the Day, that the Fish may be seen to swim above twenty Fathom deep. A calm Ocean when the Days and Nights are of an exact length, and especially when dark Clouds appear, is a certain sign of a dreadful Storm. At Full or New-Moon the Sea rises twelve Foot, and con∣tinues either a longer or shorter time, according as it is more or less turbulent, and the Rivers fall stronger or more gently into the same.</P>
<P>Before most part of the Coast of <HI>Brasile</HI> lies a Stone Cliff of above twenty or thirty Paces broad, which is never cover'd with Water, though in the time of Spring-floods. In this Cliff Nature in several places hath made a Gap, through which the Ships sail near the Shore, and ride safe at an Anchor.</P>
<P>The whole Countrey of <HI>Brasile</HI> is divided into thirteen <HI>Praefectures,</HI> or Lord∣ships, and hath about as many Rivers, which more or less empty themselves into every one of these Countreys. The Eastern part hath several Brooks and Foun∣tains, which afford good Water both for Man and Beast. In some parts the Water is so strong, that the wild Beasts making themselves Drunk therewith, are easily taken. During the Winter Season the Rivers glide with great force, and swell on a
<PB N="480" REF="320"/>sudden, overflowing all the neighboring Countrey, onely the River <HI>San Francisco</HI> runs strongest and rises highest in the Summer Season, whenas in the Winter it flows low, and poures but little Water into the Ocean. The original of this Ri∣ver is as yet unknown, yet is by most believ'd to come out of a great Lake lying near the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Mountains: The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who sail'd forty Leagues up the same, found it every where broad and deep, and scatter'd full of Isles and Rocks. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> sailing ten Leagues farther, discover'd the great Rocks <HI>Cocoeras,</HI> from which the said River falls down with great violence, and extends it self North-West. In the other <HI>Brasilian</HI> Streams, though wide at the Mouthes, which generally are not above two or three hours walking from their Fountains or Springs, no Barque is able to Row up, they being exceeding shallow, although much Rain falls into them; the reason whereof is because the barren Mountains lying be∣tween <HI>Brasile</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> discharge abundance of Water through the Rivers of <HI>Ama∣zones, Maranon, Francisco, La Plata,</HI> and the <HI>Juaeiro,</HI> with such force into the Ocean, that they keep their sweetness for thirty Leagues. Near the Sea side are seve∣ral Lakes and Pits which are drinkable, and others up in the Countrey that are brackish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the Soil.</NOTE>The Countrey differs exceedingly, for where it extends in Plains the Soil is fat and clayie, and produces all sorts of Fruit, but especially Sugar-Canes. During the rainy Seasons the Trees flourish most; after which the heat of the Sun, and fer∣tility of the Soil speedily ripen the Fruit: wherefore they Dung not their Land, but on the contrary endeavor to make it lean with Sand, that the Plants might not have too many Leaves, and wither before the Fruit can be ripened. They Sowe in the beginning of the rainy Moneths, and especially take care that the Seed lie not too deep in the Ground, because then the Sun-beams being not able to come at it, suffer it to perish in the cold Ground.</P>
<P>The high <HI>Cocoa</HI> and <HI>Palmito</HI>-Trees, are transplanted all the year round, the Roots being onely cover'd with a little Earth, because they can endure no cold.</P>
<P>Several Trees here bear a cooling Fruit, as if kind Nature took care to provide against excessive heat.</P>
<P>All manner of Plants and Herbs brought hither from <HI>Angola, Portugal,</HI> the <HI>Nether∣lands,</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> grow here very plentifully. But the Countrey generally would be much better, if some way could be found out to destroy the innumera∣ble company of Pismires, which though three times bigger than the <HI>European,</HI> re∣semble them very much, and cover the Paths in Woods and Fields for three or four Miles together; and raising Hillocks, make them hollow, and fill them with Corn: in the Full of the Moon they gather an incredible quantity of Grain, which they bite at each end, because it should not sprout: against the rainy Moneths they stop up their Holes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Ta∣manda.</HI></NOTE> that the Water may not damnifie their Store. But these Animals have a mortal Enemy of the <HI>Tamanda,</HI> of which there are two sorts, the bigger call'd <HI>Guaca,</HI> the lesser <HI>Miri;</HI> the <HI>Guaca,</HI> notwithstanding it is no bigger than an or∣dinary Dog, yet it destroys Tygers, and other wild Beasts, with such a raging fury, that it never lets go what once it hath got hold of, but holds it fast so long till some∣times it dies of Hunger. The <HI>Guaca</HI> differing from the <HI>Miri</HI> onely in bigness, hath a broad Tail full of grey and black Bristles, which sticks up when he is vex'd, but when he goes to sleep, covers himself with the same. The <HI>Miri</HI> winds his long smooth Tail about the Boughs, by which hanging he searches the Holes in the Trees with his Tongue, which being thin and round, hath a Gutter in the middle, in which when it feels any Pismires, it suddenly swallows them down: If he per∣ceives them to have their Nests under Ground, then he scratches up the Earth, and
<PB N="481" REF="320"/>puts his Tongue in at the Holes. Both the <HI>Guacu</HI> and <HI>Miri</HI> have a thick Skin, and a broad black Streak from their Breasts on each side up half way their Bodies, and through the black runs also a white Streak. No Beast in the World is hardier than this, for though it fasts twelve days, and is afterwards flay'd alive, yet it will live several hours after.</P>
<P>The Lakes in <HI>Brasile</HI> are for the most part overgrown with Weeds just like a Field, yet are exceeding full of Fish and Fowl. Where the Sea runs into the Lakes, great multitudes of Crabs are seen crawling along the Ground, and the Oysters hang in Clusters on the Boughs of a Plant call'd <HI>Manyle</HI> or <HI>Mangues,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plant <HI>Manyle.</HI></NOTE> which grow with their Roots either near or in the Water, in such a manner, that new Bodies still shoot from the old Roots, which prevents easie access to the chief Plant, on whose uppermost Leaves after Sun-rising sticks very white Salt, which in the Night, or in a cloudy Day turns to a brackish Dew. Moreover, those places where <HI>Brasile</HI> rises with Hills and Mountains, are likewise very fruitful, except the barren tops of some, which seem to kiss the Skyes; and though the fruitful Mountains flourish in the time of the rainy Months, yet many of the Trees which grow on them die in Summer, and their Ashes being burnt by the Inhabitants, are us'd in stead of Dung. Some Woods extend themselves three hundred Leagues in length, and are full of Trees, so tall, that an Arrow shot upwards falls short of the top of them, and a Boat may be made out of the Body, which can carry a hundred and fifty Men. On the great Boughs of these mighty Trees grow other excrescent Shrubs after the manner of Misseltoe, which proceed from the Kernels swallow'd and muted upon them by the Birds that light there. In some places also grow also Sweet-wood Trees, which afford either excellent Gums or Wood to Dye with; amongst which the chief is the <HI>Ibiripitanga,</HI> which yields the <HI>Brasile</HI> Wood, that gives Denomination of <HI>Brasile</HI> to this vast Tract of Land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Tree <HI>Ibripitanga.</HI></NOTE> The Tree <HI>Ibripitanga</HI> is tall and spreading, hath sad colour'd Bark full of short Thorns; the Leaves are green, and differ in form but little from the Box-Tree Leaf; the Boughs shoot forth other lesser, full of yellow and sweet-smelling Flowers, which falling off are succeeded by a flat long Cod, of a dark grey colour, full of little red Pulse; the upper part of the Tree is not good to Dye with, but onely the lower part of the Body, which because the Tree grows far up in the Countrey, is not transport∣able without much trouble. But the <HI>Tatai-iba</HI> grows in the Woods along the Shore;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tree <HI>Tatai-iba.</HI></NOTE> the Bark being of an Ash-colour, invests a yellow Wood; the Leaves are sharp and notch'd, the Fruit not unlike Mulberries, pale, juicy, and full of white Seed; the Wood boyl'd Dyes a pure Yellow. It is observable not onely of this Tree, but generally of the Trees of this Countrey, that they neither flourish, nor shed their Leaves all over at once, nor do several Trees of the same kind, and growing here germinate or fade together; for whilest one is fullest of Blossoms, the other is without Leaves; and whilest the same Tree sheds its Leaves on one side, the other side is newly Budded.</P>
<P>The <HI>European</HI> Plants and Herbs with soft Roots, being once Planted in <HI>Brasile,</HI> come to be hard and lignifi'd. There is also great difference, according to the Ground in which they are Planted; for such Plants and Trees as in the Plains are but small and tender, grow ten times higher if Planted in the Woods.</P>
<P>All sorts of <HI>Indian</HI> Pulse grow higher than the tallest Trees, like high Arbors, under which both Men and Beasts may shelter themselves from the Sun or Rain.</P>
<P>We find not upon Record or Tradition, that <HI>Brasile</HI> was ever troubled with an Earthquake, which is the reason that it hath neither Silver nor Gold-Mines, because sulphurous Fires are found under Ground, which are a cause of the production of
<PB N="482" REF="321"/>

</FIGURE> Gold and Silver, so likewise they occasion Earthquakes: yet in that part of <HI>Brasile</HI> call'd <HI>Ceara,</HI> there are some Mines of Silver, out of which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would have got greater Riches, had not they been employ'd in the Wars against the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>Far up into the Countrey amongst the Mountains, inhabit <HI>Canibals,</HI> or Man-eaters. The <HI>Europeans</HI> that first travell'd that way, found the Countrey very fertile and full of People, especially in the Valleys, but somewhat incommoded by the want of Water, and the excessiveness of the Heat in the Day, and of the Cold in the Night. In some places the Countrey is so over-grown with Brambles, that they are forc'd to cut their way through the same. But there are a sort of Thistles, which having concave Leaves, receive the Dew and Rain for the accommodation of the Natives.</P>
<P>Besides Serpents and Dragons, the Tygers are most of all to be fear'd when hungry, but once satisfi'd are easily taken.</P>
<P>Dogs, Oxen, Sheep, and Horses thrive also exceedingly in most parts of <HI>Brasile.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the <HI>Brasili∣ans.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Brasilians</HI> live to be very old without being Bald or Grey: There are sel∣dom or never to be seen squint-ey'd, lame, decrepid, or any deformed People, not∣withstanding the Children are never Swath'd but thrown into cold Water as soon as born. The Men generally have a very near resemblance one with another, as also the Women, so that there is not such a difference betwixt Man and Man there, as amongst other People. There is scarce any Sickness heard of in these Parts; for besides a long Life, they enjoy the benefit of Health so long as they live. They trouble not themselves with much Business; and in one Hut, whose Covering con∣sists of Palm-Leaves, dwell several Families together.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Living.</NOTE>The general Bread of the <HI>Brasilians</HI> is the stamp'd Root <HI>Mandihoka;</HI> besides which they also eat all manner of Fruit and Plants, and many times Flesh, which they either eat boyl'd, broyl'd, or stew'd; their Boyling is after this manner: First they kindle their Fire with two Sticks, the one of hard, and the other of soft Wood; the hard they make sharp at the end, and fix the same into the soft, which setting on fire they immediately lay Cotton thereupon, or else dry Leaves, and so boyl the Flesh in round Earthen Pots call'd <HI>Camu:</HI> but they account that better which is
<PB N="483" REF="321"/>stew'd in a Pot, the bottom whereof is cover'd with Leaves, on which they lay the Flesh, then stopping the same close on the top with Earth and Leaves, they make Fire over it so long till they think the Flesh to be sufficiently stew'd. Their Broyl∣ing they perform by fixing forked Stick into the Ground, over which they lay seve∣ral others like a Gridiron, and upon them the raw Flesh, cut in long Slices, and Pepper'd and Salted, then make a Fire under the same till it is enough; and their Meat so dress'd keeps good fourteen days. Their Fish either boyl'd or broyl'd is eaten with the Sawce <HI>Juquitinga.</HI> The little Fish <HI>Piaba</HI> and <HI>Piquitinga</HI> they make up in Rolls, and lay them under hot Ashes. Both with their Flesh and Fish they eat for Bread, as hath been said, the Meal of the Root <HI>Mandihoka,</HI> which they taking up with three Fingers throw into their Mouthes so dexterously, that not the least scrap falls besides. They never observe any set hours to eat, for they make several Meals in the Day and sometimes in the middle of the Night, if their Appetite serves, and neither drink nor speak whilest they are at their Meat. They sleep in spread Hammocks made fast between two Poles, near which burns a constant Fire with which in the Day-time they dress their Meat, and at Night keep themselves warm, the Nights being there somewhat cold, because of their equal length with the Days. Their usual Liquor is cold Water, taken out of the Fountains, Rivers, or Brooks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their several sorts of Drinks.</NOTE> but to Carouse they make the Drink <HI>Caoi,</HI> of the Fruit of the <HI>Ocaiiba</HI>-Tree, which being stamp'd in a woodden Mortar, is strain'd, and at first looks like Milk, but after a few days standing turns to a darker colour, and is strong enough to make Astronomers of those that drink largely of it, but if long kept, it turns to be excel∣lent Vinegar.</P>
<P>They have another Drink call'd <HI>Aipu,</HI> which is made two several ways; the first is thus: An old Toothless Woman chews the little cut Root <HI>Aipimacaxera</HI> to a a Pap call'd <HI>Caracu,</HI> which spitting in a Pot they pour Water on the same, and after∣wards boyling it leisurely, stirring it all the time it stands over the Fire. The other way of making this <HI>Aipu,</HI> which is much the more cleanly, is to boyl the said Root so long, till it comes to be like Butter-milk, and then letting it stand till it hath done working, it will be no unpleasant Drink.</P>
<P>Another sort of Drink amongst them is their <HI>Pacobi,</HI> made of the Fruit of the Tree <HI>Pacobebe</HI> and <HI>Pacobucu;</HI> besides others made of the Tree <HI>Abatu,</HI> of <HI>Indian</HI> Bar∣ley and <HI>Maiz.</HI> Also their Liquor call'd <HI>Jetici</HI> is press'd out of <HI>Potato</HI>-Roots.</P>
<P>In like manner the Plant <HI>Nana,</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Ananas,</HI> makes the Drink <HI>Nanai,</HI> which is exceeding strong and heady, but good against Faintness, Vomit∣ing, Gravel, and stoppage of Urine, as also against Poyson.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Debo∣ches.</NOTE>The <HI>Tapuiyans,</HI> sur-named <HI>Cariri,</HI> meet at a certain time to make the Liquor <HI>Aipu,</HI> whereof each takes as much to his Hut as falls to his share, and when it hath done working, they begin in the Morning very early at the first House in the Vil∣lage, and drink out every drop which they find there, and so from House to House till they have drunk one another drie; and he is look'd upon to be the best Man that hath drunk and evacuated most.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Taking Tobacco.</NOTE>The <HI>Brasilians</HI> take generally very strong Tobacco, which they first drie in the Sun, and afterwards before the Fire, the better to rub it in pieces: Their Tobacco-pipe is a Cane and a hollow Nut cut off at the top, and a round Hole bor'd in the middle, into which they put the Cane. They forbear not to take Tobacco even in the midst of their religious Ceremonies, which are perform'd with Singing and Dancing in this manner:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their religi∣ous Ceremo∣nies.</NOTE>The <HI>Tapuaiyans</HI> making a round Ring at an equal distance one from another, all of them being stark naked, tie divers colour'd Plumes of Feathers on their back-sides

</FIGURE> with a String made fast on their left Shoulders and about their Wastes; about their Legs they have Cotton Garters; each in his turn bowing to the Left, stretches down his left Hand to the Ground, and puts his right Hand in between the Strings which tie the Plume of Feathers, and stamps continually with his right Foot, whilest all the rest begin to Sing a doleful Song, which by degrees they change into a merry one, not without some appearance of understanding the Art of Musick. Their Songs contain first a mournful Relation of a general Deluge, which drowned their Predecessors, all but some few, who escap'd by climbing up high Trees and Mountains; next the Acts of those old Heroes from whom they boast themselves Extracted, who lost their Lives, or valiantly fought for the publick good, and were rewarded with the enjoyment of all pleasures and Delights, of Sing∣ing, Playing, Dancing, and the like, in a remote Countrey, whither after their Deaths they hope to be translated: Whilest they thus Sing over all their Songs, three Priests stand in the middle of the Ring, each holding the Idol <HI>Maraka</HI> (in their left Hand) resembling an old Ostritch's Egg stuck full of Feathers on the top: about their Wastes they wear a Girdle of rich Plumes, on their Heads also a Crown of Feathers; the middle Priest looks with a stern Countenance, and holds up his left Leg from the Ground, whilest the other two standing on each side of him, hold in their right Hands a Pipe, out of which blowing Tobacco-smoak in one anothers Faces, they utter these words, <HI>Receive the Spirit of heroick Strength:</HI> The Dance ended, they Entertain their Priests with Meat and Drink eight days together, and also put Meat before their Idol <HI>Maraka,</HI> who is the chief Deity they adore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms.</NOTE>Their Arms consist of Bowes made of hard Wood, Strung with twisted Cotton Thred; their Arrows they make of the Cane <HI>Tacaara,</HI> made very sharp at the end, or headed with some Beasts sharp Tooth, or pointed with the Bones of the Fish <HI>Iperu.</HI> Some of the <HI>Tapuiyans</HI> use great Darts, and long Clubs of black Wood, broad before, and full of sharp Spikes; the Handles being wound about with Cotton Strings call'd <HI>Jatirana,</HI> under which hangs a Tuft of the Bird <HI>Arara's</HI> Feathers, as also about the middle. Their Trumpets, call'd <HI>Canguenca,</HI> are the Shin-bones of Men, though
<PB N="485" REF="322"/>they have others also made of great Shells and Canes. They us'd to be continually at War one with another, which they wag'd neither for Lands nor Riches, but either to make themselves eminent, and to be accounted valiant Soldiers, or most especi∣ally for the sake of Man's-flesh to feed upon, which they love beyond all things in the World, wherefore they fatten all their Prisoners for the slaughter. Their Battels are always cruel, for they fight very desperately. <HI>Emanuel de Moraes</HI> relates, That he saw a <HI>Brasilian</HI> fight with three Armed <HI>Portugueses,</HI> who slew him not till after he had wounded them all three.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Langua∣ges of the <HI>Brasilians.</HI></NOTE>The Languages of the <HI>Brasilians</HI> are several, each Countrey speaking a peculiar Tongue, but so different that they cannot understand one another. The <HI>Tabuyans</HI> are divided into above eighty.

These Women accompany their Hus∣bands when they go into the Wars, and carry their Provisions, especially store of Tobacco. In the Lips both of the Men and Women hang little Stones. The Men take as many Wives as they please; and amongst the generality of the fore-men∣tion'd Nations, there is scarce any sign of Religion to be discern'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tobaras</HI> and <HI>Potigi-iguaras.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Tobaras</HI> arc accounted the best Horsemen; but in Singing and Discourse, the <HI>Potigi-iguaras</HI> exceed all the other <HI>Brasilians:</HI> They place twenty or thirty Singers in a Row, which observing Time, Sing the Transactions of their Prede∣cessors with good Voices.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Waimoo∣res.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Waimoores</HI> are a strong People that inhabit the large Tract of Land between <HI>Bahia</HI> and <HI>Isleos,</HI> and having well timber'd Bodies, can keep pace with a Horse run∣ning full speed. Five or six of them often set upon a Sugar-Mill, though a hun∣dred Men be at work in the same: They are all over bedaub'd with Dirt, because they lie like Beasts on the Ground: They wear long Hair, and have no certain Abodes.</P>
<PB N="488" REF="324"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tomoni∣menos.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Tomonimenos,</HI> living about <HI>Spirito Santo,</HI> are more civilis'd; they make Walls of Stone about their Huts; and these Walls are full of Holes, through which they shoot Arrows at those that Invade them; their Bodies are Painted red and black, and cover'd with Feathers. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> taking sixteen thousand of them Priso∣ners at once, kill'd most of them, and destroy'd the Countrey all along the River <HI>Paraiva.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Waita∣quazes.</HI></NOTE>At the South and North Point of <HI>Cape Frio</HI> dwell the <HI>Waitaquazes,</HI> bigger and stronger than the <HI>Waimoores;</HI> and they also sleep like Hogs on the Ground about a Fire, hold all People for their Enemies, and their Flesh for the greatest Dainty. The Women Arm'd with Bowes and Arrows stand by their Husbands in Battel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Wainas∣ses.</HI></NOTE>On <HI>Isla Grande</HI> reside the <HI>Wainasses,</HI> a little People, which have very long Bellies, go stark naked, shave the Crown of their Heads, and let the other part of their Hair hang down long on their Shoulders. The Women, which are of gross Bo∣dies, colour themselves Red with <HI>Vruca,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption of the Plant <HI>Vruca.</HI></NOTE> which is a wild Plant, but much us'd a∣mongst them: the Kernels are inclos'd in Husks full of red Fibres. These Kernels are not onely mix'd with the other Ingredients of the <HI>Chocaletta</HI> Drink, but also us'd to Dye of a red Colour: The Wood of this Plant is very white, and the Bark grey, like the Hazle; the Leaves being of a deep Green, resemble a Heart; at the end of the Boughs grow several Blossoms, each as big as a Rose, consisting of five Leaves, parly red and partly white, in the middle whereof are yellowish Threds with pur∣ple Points, which give little or no smell: after the Flower follows the Fruit, two Fingers long; when it begins to be ripe it grows still redder and redder, each Cod containing thirty or forty round Kernels, which being touch'd leave a red tincture upon the Fingers; the Cod when ripe opens of it self, and shews the Kernels speckled white, which dry'd, pounded, and mix'd with Piss, Dye so strong a Red, that Linnen dipt into the same will never receive any other Colour. This Root also boyl'd in Broth, makes it not onely red, but gives it a pleasant taste.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Topina∣ques.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Topinaques,</HI> which dwell about <HI>St. Vincent,</HI> are a strong and gross People, go stark naked both Men and Women: when they kill any of their Enemies they Paint themselves with the Fruit <HI>Janipano,</HI> put a great Plume of Feathers on their Head, and two Sticks in their Mouths, Dancing with strange motions of the Body, inclining sometimes towards the right, and sometimes towards the left side, for three day together; during which time they drink a filthy kind of Liquor. The Women, who have well proportion'd Bodies, onely covering their Heads with a Cap, about which they tie a bread of Hair, to which a square Basket being fastned, hangs below their Backs when they travel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Pories.</HI></NOTE>The Mountains along the Ocean, which inclose much Gold, are inhabited by the <HI>Pories,</HI> a peaceable People, molesting none of their Neighbors; they sleep in Nets of Flags, and have no other Houses than three Poles plac'd triangular, and cover'd with Palm-Leaves; they feed on Pine-Nuts and <HI>Eyrires,</HI> Apples that have Shells like a Walnut, and have also the precious Balsam-Oyl in great abundance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Molopa∣ques.</HI></NOTE>Along the River <HI>Paradiva</HI> inhabit the <HI>Molopaques;</HI> the Men strong and well timber'd, have Beards long enough to cover their Privities. The Women also fair, modest, prudent, and never laughing, tie their Hair, painted with several colours, round about their Middle with a Cord, so that it serves in stead of an Apron. They observe a set-hour for Dinner and Supper, which is not us'd by any other <HI>Brasili∣ans.</HI> The Mountains in these Parts consisting of a black Mold, have plenty of Gold, but it is of no esteem or regard amongst them, onely that which is wash'd down by the Rain they gather up, but put to no other use than to make Hooks to hang their Nets on.</P>

<P>Not far from whose Dominions appear the Mountains <HI>Pinos</HI> up in the Coun∣trey, which abounding with Gold and Precious Stones, are inhabited by the <HI>Bihe∣ros,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Lopos,</HI> which live under the Trees like Beasts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Waiana∣wasons.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Waianawasons</HI> have little Villages, built along a nameless River; they are a Gigantick People, but very ignorant. Thirteen <HI>Portuguese</HI> undertaking some years ago to travel through this Countrey to the South Sea, found on some Mountains abundance of Gold and Precious Stones; and amongst many strange things they saw a Crystal Mountain ten days before they came near it, over which they could not travel because of its steepness; at the foot thereof sprung a broad Stream, ma∣king a great noise. From thence travelling forward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tamoyes.</HI></NOTE> they came to the <HI>Tamoyes</HI> Countrey, the Men whereof, being well proportion'd, wore great Bunches of Fea∣thers on their Heads: The Women, exceeding fair, had carv'd Breasts. The said <HI>Portuguese</HI> being taken here, were put into Prison, and all slain and eaten, excepting one, who escap'd after this manner: Thirty thousand <HI>Tamoyes</HI> falling into the Countrey of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> by the <HI>Americans</HI> call'd <HI>Mandiocuysyams,</HI> made a great Feast with three hundred of them, whilest the rest fled to the River <HI>La Plata,</HI> where they got help from the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who kill'd ten thousand of the <HI>Tamoyes,</HI> made the rest Slaves, and releas'd their imprison'd Countreyman.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Tocomans Caryogs, <HI>and</HI> Maraquites.</NOTE>The <HI>Tocomans,</HI> a little People, dwell between <HI>La Plata</HI> and <HI>St. Vincent.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Caryogs</HI> possess much Gold and Precious Stones.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maraquites,</HI> by the Western <HI>Indians</HI> sur-named <HI>Tapuiyers,</HI> that is, <HI>Wild People</HI> are divided into seventy six sorts, all differing in their Languages; amongst which the chiefest are the <HI>Arodera, Cajau, Maquaru,</HI> and <HI>Poyme,</HI> which all live without Law, Religion, setled Abodes, or Friendship with any Neighbors; and the Women Fight as well as the Men. <HI>Jacob Rabbi,</HI> who dwelt a considerable time, and con∣vers'd amongst these People, describes their Customs thus:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cu∣stoms de∣scrib'd.</NOTE><Q>Their King <HI>Jandui,</HI> sir-named <HI>Otshicayayna,</HI> from the River which flows through
<PB N="490" REF="325"/>the Countrey of the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> causes (if he thinks fit) to be publish'd through the the whole Camp of the Enemy, whither he will go the next Morning, and what he will do ill the Day following, having first consulted with his Council of Sorcerers. Before they march they wash their Bodies in the River; rub them∣selves all over with Sand, and afterwards wash it off again, then stretch them∣selves till all their Joynts crack, run to the Fire, and when throughly warm, scratch their Bodies with certain Fish-Teeth, insomuch that the Blood gushes out of several places, all which they judge to be good against wearisomness. About a Stones-cast from the King's Tent lie two thick Logs, a large Stride one from the other, against which the whole Multitude stand divided into two Par∣ties, each of whom chuse the strongest Man accounted amongst them to carry the Log for a Wager, and when these two are tir'd, they are releas'd by others, and he that comes last to the appointed place with the Log, is laugh'd at by the Party to which he belong'd that was there first, where they all stay for the Youths that bring their Arms, which when they have deliver'd, they all fall to work, cutting down Trees, breaking off the Boughs, sticking them in the Ground, and tying them together on the top for Tents, which are built in rows one against another, leaving a broad Path between. Mean while the Women and Children coming with their Baggage, the Men run to Fish and Hunt, or to seek Honey. The old Women dig up Roots, which stamp'd serve them for Bread, whilest the young Women help one another to prepare the Meat in the Huts. Moreover the Men spend their time in several Exercises, as Wrestling and Running, of which two Women, appointed for that purpose, are the Judges. When the Evening draws on upon them, then the Youths dividing themselves into Companies, go Singing from one Tent to another, and are follow'd by the Maids Dancing and Leaping, every one standing behind him whom she loves best; and this is look'd upon as a singular sign of affection. When a young Man is inclin'd to Marry, he carries Honey and Venison to his Mistresses Father, who if he hath more than one Daughter acquaints the Soothsayers with it, who inform the King concern∣ing it; he then causes all the young Men and Maids to be call'd together out of the Camp, sends them into the Woods to Hunt out a wild Beast, which they no sooner see, but they return and acquaint the Multitude therewith, who immedi∣ately surrounding the Place, soon catch the Beast, whose Entrails they pull out and throw to the Dogs; and give the Flesh to the Women to roast, which when ready they make merry with, Singing and Dancing after they have eaten; then if the Youth hath behav'd himself well in pursuing of the wild Beast, the King grants him the Maid which he desires for his Wife: Four days before the Wedding they bore a Hole through each of the Bridegrooms Cheeks with a sharp piece of Wood, which done they solemnize the Marriage; at which the King himself distributes the Meat to every Guest as he thinks fit; after Din∣ner they extol the Mothers Care, in preserving her Daughters Virginity for the Bridegroom in strange Songs. If a Maid be Marriageable, and no Suitor comes to her, then the Mother draws red Strokes under her Eyes, and conducts her to the King, who sets the Maid down by him on a Mat, warms his Hands against the Fire, then stroaks himself and the Maid, and also blows Tobacco-Smoak on her and himself, which done, he performs the part of a Husband with her. But their making Holes through their Ears and Lips is done whilest they are Chil∣dren, after this manner: The Boys who undergo this Ceremony, come to the Place appointed, where the whole Multitude Dance and Sing, and the Conju∣rers (who are the onely Priests they have) sit in two rows opposite to one ano∣ther;
<PB N="491" REF="325"/>one of them starting up, takes a Boy by the Head, ties him Hand and Foot that he cannot stir at all; which done, a second Sorcerer comes to his assistance, and with a sharp-pointed Stick bores Holes through his Ears and Lips, whilest the Mother of the Boy makes a sad Lamentation. Women refuse to have any familiarity with their Husbands as soon as they perceive themselves to be with Child; and as soon as any Woman is Deliver'd, she runs into a neighboring Wood, where with a Shell she cuts off the Childs Navel, which boyling she eats with the After-birth; then washes her self and the Child every Morning and Evening in cold Water; as long as she gives Suck her Husband lies not with her, unless it be a Man that hath but one Wife. If a Woman commit Adultery, her Husband beats her out of his House, but if he takes her in the Act, it is law∣ful for him to kill both. In the middle of the King's Tent stands a great <HI>Calabash</HI> full of Stones call'd <HI>Kehnturah,</HI> cover'd with the corner of a Mat, which none dares approach without the King's leave, unless it be to smoak the same with Tobacco, or to lay Venison or Honey before it.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strangeman∣ner of curing the Sick a∣mongst the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI></NOTE>It is also remarkable how the Sorcerers deal with their Sick; the aforesaid <HI>Jacob Rabbi,</HI> an Eye-witness relates, That the King <HI>Drarugh</HI> being extreamly troubled with pains in his Sides and Legs, and finding no help amongst his Sorcerers, who pretended to be Physicians, went to the neighboring King of the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> where three undertook to cure him, which they did after this manner: One of them blew To∣bacco-smoak on his Body, suck'd his Knees, roar'd like a Lyon, and after much ado vomited a little Eel into his Hand, which he pretended had put the King to so much pain; whilest the second suck'd his Belly, and also roar'd exceedingly, and vomited forth at last a Stone, on which appear'd a Rose; the third suck'd his left Side, till he vomited something like a Root; after which the King is said imme∣diately to have recover'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Feast∣ing in honor of the Stars.</NOTE>There is but little Ceremony of Religion to be found amongst the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> onely they shew Reverence to the Seven-stars when the Fruits of the Field are ripe, after this manner: First they spend three days in Dancing and Singing, then the Youths prepare themselves to Fight with Lances and Clubs, tie tough Twigs about their Legs, pour Honey on their Heads, tie their Hair behind in Knots after it is pow∣der'd with red Powder, Paint their Faces and Bodies with several Colours, stick a long Feather in their Necks betwixt their Hair, and on their Heads set Garlands of red Feathers pleited, down their Backs hang Bundles of Branches like Tails, and have their Arms adorn'd with the Wings of the Bird <HI>Kosetug;</HI> thus dress'd they fight three days, at the end whereof the Conquerors shew great joy.</P>
<P>It deserves special observation what the Learned <HI>Gerard Vossius</HI> relates of them from the Mouth of <HI>Christopher Arcisseusky,</HI> a <HI>Polish</HI> Nobleman, famous for his hetoick Exploits for the <HI>United Netherlands</HI> in <HI>Brasile.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arcisseusky</HI>'s Relation of the Manners of the new Married.</NOTE><Q>The <HI>Tapuyans</HI> (saith he) are a People that range up and down, never staying long in one place, between <HI>Siara</HI> and <HI>Meranthon,</HI> a vast Tract of Land, and go al∣most naked, having onely a slight Covering about their Middle. When the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> gave them Clothes, they admir'd the strange Fashion thereof, and after two days return'd them again: In their Lips, Nostrils, Ears and Cheeks they hung Ornamentals of Wood, Bones, Feathers, or Stones; a great Club, and a strong Bowe made of hard Wood serve them for Arms; Gold and Silver they esteem'd not, wherefore they barter'd whole Chests full (buried there by the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> and discover'd by them) with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for Greyhounds: They judge themselves to be better than other Man-eaters, because they eat not the Flesh of their Enemies, but of their own Relations, and those neither kill'd in the Wars,

<P>The same Author relates also, That he saw a <HI>Tapuyan</HI> yield up the Ghost not far from the Castle <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> after which his nearest Relations taking the Body, wash'd the same, together with the Entrails, and cutting the Corps into several pieces, roasted the same on a Spit, preserving the Fat that dropt from it in Pans, and eat the Flesh with a greedy Appetite. None were admitted to this Feast but his chief Relations; and that which they could not eat, as the Hair, Teeth, Nails, and Bones, they burnt to Ashes, which gathering up they mix'd with their Liquor till it was all drunk up.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Religion of the <HI>Tapu∣yans.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Tapuyans</HI> acknowledge two Deities, the one good and the other bad; to the good they shew no Reverence, because, say they, he is bountiful of himself, and doth them no hurt; whereas on the contrary they zealously call upon their Devil-Deity, because they think he destroys all those who worship him not.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fore∣telling of things to come.</NOTE>They never Travel nor go to War before they have consulted with their angry God, and that not without great Ceremonies; whereupon they ascribe to them∣selves the knowledge of future things; and indeed they often foretel future things which are beyond humane apprehension; as a testimony whereof that may serve which <HI>Sapo Amama,</HI> a <HI>Friezland</HI> Gentleman, found by experience: for he keeping Guard before <HI>Conjahu</HI> with a Troop of Horse against the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> had several <HI>Ta∣puyans</HI> in his Service, who foretold, That the following day the Lieutenant <HI>Amama</HI> and a Trooper should be kill'd by a Shot from a great Gun; which, though slighted, was confirm'd by the exact fulfilling of the Prediction. The like Passages hapned daily, and amongst many <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> relates one very remarkable Accident, <HI>viz.</HI> He remov'd a considerable number of Men out of the Garrison <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> to sur∣prize the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fort <HI>Barra-Canium,</HI> and nothing could more promote the Design than secrecy; but fifty <HI>Tapuyans</HI> having joyn'd with the <HI>Hollanders, Arcisseusky</HI> fear'd
<PB N="493" REF="326"/>they might discover his Plot, wherefore he charg'd them that they should not stir a foot from his Company, which they accordingly promis'd, and having march'd three days through By-ways, they daily perform'd their Devotion in open view, and <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> desir'd that they would call him when their Devil appear'd, which they granted, on promise that he should not do him any hurt: On the third day the Army being sufficiently refresh'd, he being call'd, found the <HI>Tapuyans</HI> sitting in a Semi-Circle, with their Feet spread asunder; opposite to them sat their Priest on the Ground, whom they ask'd concerning all manner of Affairs, and he questi∣on'd them again, on which they gave their several Answers, but could not be un∣derstood for want of Interpreters; for those whom the <HI>Hollanders</HI> us'd spake only two Languages, one of which is us'd commonly by the <HI>Brasilians</HI> along the Sea-Coast, and the other by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> in which they Interpreted to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> as much as possibly they could understand of what the <HI>Tapuyans</HI> said, whose Language dif∣fers very much from the vulgar <HI>Brasile</HI> Tongue, because they live up in the Inland, and are divided into divers Tribes, so that the Interpreters could not understand the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> but judg'd their meaning more by nodding of the Head, and the like signs: after the Assembly had done speaking, the Priest rose up and went out of their sights into the Wood, where with a loud voice he call'd three times upon the Devil; but he not answering, the Priest return'd to his Company, who began their Questions and Answers afresh, which could not be understood by the Inter∣preters; and soon after the Priest (seeming to be commanded by the rest) went again to the Wood, but calling still in vain, return'd; then going a third time, and calling as before, was by a small, but shrill Voice, answer'd from the middle of the Wood, from which the <HI>Tapuyans</HI> concluded that their Business would come to perfection, and that the Devil would soon appear to them: The Priest hereupon going backwards and forwards three times one after another to his Company, they began to talk as before; at last going into the Wood again, they all spoke louder, and with more vehemency than before, whilest the fore-mention'd shrill Voice approached nearer and nearer, and at last the supposed <HI>Daemon</HI> came forth with the Priest, who commanded him to sit opposite to the Congregation, which had a great deal of Discourse, and sometimes the Priest speaking was answer'd by the Devil in his shrill Voice; but some of the People calling aloud, catch'd up their Arms, and threatned to beat the Devil, as they often us'd to do upon the like occasions. At the departure of the <HI>Daemon,</HI> the Multitude conducted by the Priest into the Wood, cry'd out in so terrible a manner, that they affrighted the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI> who judg'd it rather to be Lyons and Tygers that roar'd than Men. During these Transactions, a <HI>German</HI> Soldier in the Rere quitted his Arms and fled, but being miss'd was pursu'd, found in a Hedge, and laid Hold on as a Person suspected to carry Advice to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and being brought before <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> and Exami∣ned, gave such ridiculous Answers as increas'd the suspicion, insomuch that he was led to a Tree to be tortur'd; where as he stood ty'd he solemnly declar'd, That the reason of his running away, was because he had not Pray'd in ten years, so that he was exceedingly afraid, lest when he saw the Devil amongst the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> he would have known him, and carry'd him away to the Place prepar'd for all such Wretches.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Impo∣sture.</NOTE>The Learned <HI>Gerard Vossius</HI> made a particular Enquiry after this Story, whether the Spirit's appearance were a Reality, or an Imposture; and the truth is it was no better than a subtile Cheat, and so it was apprehended by <HI>Arcisseusky,</HI> who not long after, on a convenient time, ask'd the <HI>Tapuyans</HI> why they feign'd him to be a Devil that was a Man, whom he had often seen before? which they denying, affirm'd
<PB N="494" REF="327"/>that it was a real Devil; but <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> knew their pretended Friend, who spake so shrill by reason of a Grass-blade which he held in his Mouth. However, though the main of the Fable was acted by Man, yet the Devil without doubt play'd his part with them, as appear'd by those Predictions, which no Man could possibly know, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Fort should with the loss but of three Men fall in∣to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> hands; for so accordingly it hapned. But because the Devil can∣not foresee all things, therefore they often erre: for they said that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should cross the Moat on Boards nail'd together in stead of a Bridge, and that the Enemy should not perceive it; and indeed <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> had resolv'd so to do, but was discover'd by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who defended themselves with great Guns, which so affrighted the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> not us'd to such a noise, that they ran away and never returned, so that by Morning the Fort was conquer'd, and all things quieted.</P>
<P>After this <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> burnt several <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships in the River <HI>Monguoape,</HI> and kept one, carrying ten Demi-Cuiverins, laden with Sugar and <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine; which to carry to a safe Harbor a short Way, he requir'd the <HI>Tapuyans</HI> assistance; but they refus'd to enter, pretending the Ship would perish by some or other unfortu∣nate Accident, which accordingly hapned as they had said; for the Ship was split against a Rock in the Mouth of a narrow Haven, insomuch that nothing of it was sav'd; all which the <HI>Tapuyans</HI> knew beforehand by the Devil's information, for they never go upon any Business of consequence before they have consulted with him, and done him worship. Yet, it seems, they cannot secure this Devil of theirs from the Stripes of a Mortal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant Story be∣tween <HI>Arcis∣seusky</HI> and a <HI>Tapuyan</HI> Priest.</NOTE> as appears by this pleasant Story: A <HI>Tapuyan</HI> Priest was promis'd a Shirt from <HI>Arcisseusky,</HI> upon condition the Devil should pull the same out of his Hand and carry it up in the Air: The <HI>Tapuyan</HI> liking the Proposal, promis'd immediately to call the Devil; but when <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> desir'd leave to Drub him with a Stick which he had in his Hand, he could by no means perswade the Priest to call for his <HI>Daemon;</HI> at which every one began to laugh: and to carry on the Mirth farther, <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> Joking with the Priest, said, <HI>I will shew you that I am a greater Artist than you, for to Morrow I will bring it about by my Art, that great Horns shall grow on your Head, so big, that you shall not be able to pass these Doors;</HI> which so af∣frighted the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> that all of them fled, onely the Priest return'd the next day with an Interpreter to <HI>Arcisseusky,</HI> desiring him that he would use him mercifully, and not cause any Horns to grow on his Head.</P>
<P>At the time when <HI>Jacob Rabbi</HI> convers'd amongst the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> they were Go∣vern'd by <HI>Janduy,</HI> a Man of above a hundred years old, whose chief Seat was on each side of the River <HI>Otschunogh,</HI> and round about the Lake <HI>Igtug,</HI> in which none durst Swim, because of the many biting Fishes in the same.</P>
<P>The King <HI>Pritigaba</HI> having entred into a strict League with <HI>Janduy,</HI> Warr'd con∣tinually against the Kings <HI>Arygpoygh, Wanasewasug, Tshering,</HI> and <HI>Dremenige;</HI> and had not the <HI>Portuguese</HI> taken the four last into their Service to aid them against the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> they could never have held out long against the Forces sent by <HI>Janduy,</HI> who destroy'd Man, Beast, and Houses, sparing nothing they met with; for they murther and destroy all things where e're they come.</P>

When they Engage one with an∣other they shoot their Arrows exceeding thick, Hooting, Hollowing, and Leaping from one side to the other to shun the Arrows with a wonderful dexterity: The Conquerors spare none, but kill all, and Feast on the slain Bodies; but some they hale away Prisoners with a Rope about their Necks, to each of whom they allot a young Maid, who cherishes and fattens them up for five Moneths, at the end of which they make a great Feast, and drink to a pitch beyond Sense or Reason, having first fill'd their Bellies with the Flesh of the slain Prisoners roasted. If the Woman be got with Child by the Slain, they imagine that they can take no greater revenge of their Enemy, than to devour the Child as soon as it comes into the World; but it often happens, that the Woman really loving her Husband the Prisoner, runs away with him, and so bereaves her Friends of a Banquet.</P>

The Town, built on the top of a white Rock, gives its Denomination to the whole Countrey, and harbor'd long since two hundred and twenty Families, and hath five Sugar-Mills. The Land on the North side of the Rock rises high, but South wardly a smooth Coast runs along the Ocean, from which two Leagues off at Sea lie several Cliffs, against which the Waves break with a great force.</P>
<P>The Towns <HI>Santa Cruiz</HI> and <HI>Amaro</HI> are left desolate, because the <HI>Portuguese</HI> were continually Invaded by the salvage <HI>Aymures,</HI> whom they were not able by any means to repress.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tapiirete.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Tapiirete</HI> also resembles a Hog, especially in its Head and Feet, but is as big as a Heifer of six Moneths old, hath a Snout hanging over its under Lip, a Mouth full of Teeth, and on its Skin short and dark colour'd Hair. This Beast is very libidi∣nous, and in the Nights spoils the Fruit-Trees, especially the Sugar-Canes, but in the Day-time it sleeps in Thickets. The Flesh of a young <HI>Tapiierete</HI> tastes like Beef.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Inhabitants of <HI>Porto Seguro</HI> are plentifully supply'd with Rabbets, and the more, because there being divers sorts of them, (some say five) they are ta∣ken in great abundance, either in Traps, Snairs, or Gins, or by discovering their Holes; for the Hunters stopping the entrance of them, dig a Hole directly over the place where the Coneys lodge, and so kill them with long Pike-staves in the Ground.</P>

<P>The second sort is the <HI>Tupesi,</HI> which being like a Hare amongst us, may as well be accounted of that kind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aguti</HI> resembles our Rabbets, onely it hath harsh brown Hair, round Ears, bald Feet, gruntles like a Hog, hath two Toes more on their hind-Legs than on the foremost.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cavia Cobaya,</HI> though less than the <HI>European</HI> Rabbets, excell them in soft and divers-colour'd Hair, distinguish'd by white, red, and black Spots; their Head and Teeth resemble those of a Rat, but it hath no Tail: No Rabbets can be made tamer than these, and if carry'd to any remote Countrey, breed as well there as in <HI>Brasile.</HI></P>
<P>The last of all is the <HI>Aparea,</HI> which differs little in running from a Hare, as also in respect of the Head and Beard, harbors more in rent Cliffs than in sandy Ground.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of Planting Sugar-Canes</NOTE>The Sugar-Canes, by the <HI>Brasilians</HI> call'd <HI>Viba</HI> or <HI>Tacomaree,</HI> grow better in a clayie and fat Soil, over which the Rivers flowing leave their Mud, than on High-lands, Hills, or Mountains; they are Planted after this manner: They first plough their Fields, weed them, and make Holes at an exact distance one from the other, into which they plant their Canes in such a manner, that the tops touch one another. The Holes before mention'd require more Earth to fill them in Summer than in Winter, that the violent Heat of the Sun may not dry up the Root, and that the Rain may the freelier come at them to moisten them, for the more moisture they have, the better they grow; they attain to their full ripeness in ten, or at most in twelve Moneths; <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March</HI> being the two last Winter Moneths, are ac∣counted the best to Plant in, because the Earth softned by Rains, suffers the Root to shoot forth the better. The ripe Canes being cut off, are left in the Field till the following Year; during which time new Canes growing, are often ground in the Mill with the old ones; but if they stand two years, then the sweet Liquor dries up, and the Cane withers. The young Plants carefully planted in good Ground may last forty, nay fifty years; but in a barren Soil they set new every five years. Sometimes in great Droughts and extraordinary hot Seasons, the Canes are scorcht to nothing, which being burnt in the Winter, the Ashes serve to Dung the Ground; and so in like manner when the Water, overflowing the Fields, drowns the young Plants.

The Water-Mills are turn'd by the force of the Wa∣ter, which in great Gutters led from high Mountains falls with exceeding force in∣to Pools made for that purpose; after which manner, though they wind the Canes much faster, yet they get not so much Sugar as when they grind them in the Mills turn'd by Cattel: The places through which the Juice runs must be cleans'd twice in twenty four hours; the Canes put in behind between the first Bar, are turn'd into the second, and thence into the third, which successively squeezes out all the remaining Juice: The Canes thus press'd, serve for Fewel to burn; but they con∣stantly keep such a great Fire both Night and Day, that besides those press'd Canes, they burn forty Fathom of Wood in twenty four hours, insomuch that whole Woods are consum'd in a short time: The Liquor, nam'd <HI>Caldo,</HI> runs along wood∣den Gutters into great Kettles, in which it is boyl'd, but if it happen to be over∣boyl'd they put Water amongst it, whereby it becomes excellent Food for Horses; then they put the Liquor into a second Kettle, where it is boyl'd afresh, and also scumm'd; and for the better cleansing of it, Lime-Juyce and other things are put amongst it; then they strein it through Clothes, and give the Dross which remains in the same to the Slaves, which work for half a year together Night and Day like Horses.

This Plant they pluck up by the Roots wild as soon as it hath put forth three Leaves; which Leaves being rowl'd up hard together like a Twig, are again Set, and then sprout up each with ten green Leaves, which when mov'd by the Wind, rattle like Parchment, and tear very easily: the Stalk is an Inch thick, from which spread several lesser Branches; under the Leaves hang yel∣lowish Flowers of a pleasant smell, at whose Stalks are lesser Leaves resembling little Scoups, full of Juice, in taste like Honey, and in colour like the White of an Egg: after the Flower follows the Fruit, very like a Cucumber, onely they are three square, and have a hardish Shell, which incloses a well tasted and wholsom Pulp, which commonly grows in Clusters. This Plant, when the Fruit is ripe, is pluck'd up, from whence another springs up immediately, which bears the like Fruit the next year; so that this Plant lives as it were by propagation conti∣nually.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bannanas</HI> bear Leaves of a Fathom long and two Foot broad; the Fruit is very like that of the <HI>Pacoeira.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mangaa</HI> is very like the Apricock both in taste and form.</P>
<P>The Tree <HI>Jaracaha</HI> hath a spread Crown, leaves like those of a Fig-Tree, yellow Flowers, and Pears with Shells, and full of Kernels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ouaieroua</HI> is an exceeding sweet-smelling Tree, bears a Fruit much bigger than the greatest Melons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Junipap,</HI> which is much taller, hath Apples, which whilest they are green are best, yielding a Juice which Dyes Coal-black, and therefore is us'd by the Natives to paint their Bodies with: The Apples when ripe are yellow within and without, very well tasted, and melting in the Mouth.</P>
<P>Besides these fore-mention'd Fruit-Trees there are several others that grow on this Island, amongst which is the <HI>Vua-pirup,</HI> eminent for its Blossom, which is yel∣low, blue, and red, and bears delicate Apples, which ripen best in the rainy Season.</P>
<P>Lastly, the <HI>Pekey,</HI> which three Men cannot Fathom, bears a Fruit of two hand∣fuls bigness, having a hard thick Shell, and within four Kidney-like Kernels, each concealing a prickly Stone, which hurts the Mouths of unwary Eaters.</P>
<P>The Plant <HI>Carouata</HI> hath Leaves an Ell long, and two Inches broad; they are
<PB N="513" REF="342"/>very thick and thistly from the middle, and about two Foot from the Ground grows an exceeding pleasant Fruit, yellow without and within, three square, a Finger long, and hanging oftentimes sixty in a Cluster.</P>
<P><HI>Vua,</HI> a sort of Melons, green without, and within full of white Pulp and black Kernels, and hath a pleasant Juice, dissolves to Water, if cut in the middle, sweeter than Sugar, and very refreshing.</P>
<P><HI>Manioch,</HI> a thick Root of the Plant <HI>Manicup,</HI> Leav'd like a Fig-Tree; being ground to Meal, it serves in stead of Bread.</P>
<P>Besides these already mention'd, there are several other Plants, the most usual are the great flat Beans call'd <HI>Commanda-ouassou,</HI> and the long Pease <HI>Commanda-miry.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Birds</NOTE>Here are variety of Birds of several sorts, especially of Parrots, which flye in great Companies, most beautiful to the Eye, and very docible to speak, and also good for Food.</P>
<P>The Partridges <HI>Nanbououassou,</HI> in bigness no way inferior to a Capon, have blue Feathers, and also Lay blue Eggs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ourou,</HI> resembling a Partridge, hath a Combe like a Cock, but mix'd with three Colours, <HI>viz.</HI> red, black, and white.</P>
<P>The Bats, nam'd <HI>Andheura,</HI> have a mournful Note in the Night, often biting those they find asleep, and suck their Blood so hard that it can hardly be stopt.</P>
<P>The Ostriches here call'd <HI>Yandou,</HI> being as tall as a middle-siz'd Man, cannot flye, but run as swift as a Greyhound.</P>
<P>Their Fowl call'd <HI>Falian,</HI> with long Bills and Cranes Legs, flies very low, but runs so swift that a Horse can scarce overtake them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange sorts of Fish.</NOTE>The Ocean about <HI>Maragnan</HI> produces abundance of all sorts of Fish, and amongst others the <HI>Pyraon,</HI> six Foot long, thicker than a Barrel, and cover'd with black Scales of a hand-breadth.</P>
<P>The Fish <HI>Camouroupouy</HI> differs not much from the <HI>Pyraon,</HI> onely in having fewer Scales.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ougry,</HI> four Foot long, hath a broad Head, and two sharp Fins on the Back, which wound terribly. This Fish also swimming in the River, smells of Musk whilest it stays therein.</P>
<P>The like length hath also the <HI>Camboury Ouassou,</HI> whose Hog-like Head, and yel∣low scal'd Tail, makes it seem like a Monster.</P>
<P>The <HI>Yauebouyre</HI> is a Foot in thickness, in length two Fathom, and a Fathom in breadth, and hath a Tail of half a Fathom long, out of the middle of which sticks a sharp and great Bone, which makes such dangerous Wounds, that if any part of a Man's Body be touch'd therewith, it must be cut off.</P>
<P>The <HI>Narinnary,</HI> which is much lesser, wounds with its Sting very dangerously.</P>
<P>The flat Fish <HI>Acaraiou</HI> hath the length of a Foot, a green Head, thick Scales, a yellow Back, and white Belly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Araououa</HI> hath a hard Skin, is eight times bigger than the <HI>Acaraiou,</HI> and hath a three-pointed Sword, with which it kills other Fish.</P>
<P>Another sort of Sword-fish is the <HI>Panapans,</HI> whose Sword is a Foot less than that of the <HI>Araououa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Picamo</HI> and <HI>Caramourou</HI> resemble the Pilchard, and are taken in great abun∣dance near the Rocks.</P>
<P>The Rivers and Brooks on <HI>Maragnan</HI> are also very full of Fish, amongst which the <HI>Pourake,</HI> four Foot long, full of green, blue, red and white Specks and Streaks, the Skin so hard that no Sword can penetrate it; wherefore it regards not a blow, but if it moves, it causes such a pain on the Arm of him that strikes, that he falls down on the Ground.</P>
<PB N="514" REF="343"/>
<P>The <HI>Caurimata,</HI> which is very like a Carp, is the most delicious Fish that ever was tasted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pyrain,</HI> without Scales, colour'd red and yellow, hath sharp Teeth, which cut sloapingly; as also the <HI>Opean, Tarehure, Paraty,</HI> and <HI>Jerou.</HI></P>
<P>The red Crabs <HI>Oussa,</HI> with hairy Legs, breed about the Roots of the fore-men∣tion'd Trees that grow in the Water.</P>
<P>The white Crabs <HI>Aouara-oussa</HI> carry the Amber-greece, cast on the Shores to their Holes.</P>
<P>They have also good Mussles, and well rellish'd Oysters sticking on the Boughs of the said Trees.</P>
<P>During the rainy Season there are generally standing Pools, in which yearly breed many Fishes, which are taken up by the Inhabitants when the Pools begin to dry.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers kinds of strange Beasts.</NOTE>Moreover, this Island feeds abundance of four-footed Beasts, amongst which their wild Deer, Rabbets and Hares, differ little from the <HI>European.</HI> They have al∣so wild Swine call'd <HI>Taiassou,</HI> who seem to have Navels on their Backs, which cast a sweet Musky smell; besides another sort of Swine, not inferior to the former, but of a stranger shape, being Mouth'd like a Hare, with two long Tusks in their up∣per Jaws, and two beneath; their Ears like a Mans; the foremost Feet white, and hoof'd like an Ass; the hindermost part of their Body like a Bear, and full of Bri∣stles, half white and half black, three handfuls long: when they creep in their Holes their staring Bristles fall; they keep much amongst Brambles, feed on Apples and Roots; In the Winter Season they Stye themselves up in their Holes.</P>
<P>Here are also Pismire-eaters, call'd <HI>Tamandua,</HI> with a Boars Head, Dogs Ears, sharp Snout, Horses Hair, and Ox Feet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tapiyre-ete</HI> differ little from wild Cows, onely they have shorter Legs and Tails, and wanting Horns, are Arm'd in stead thereof with Teeth; in their Heads are often found a Stone like the <HI>Bezoar</HI> Stone.</P>
<P>Several sorts of <HI>Armadillo's</HI> here differ much in form each from the other.</P>
<P>The wild Cats <HI>Margaia</HI> are caught for their curious Skin.</P>
<P>The Foxes <HI>Janovare,</HI> and Leopards <HI>Sovassovaran,</HI> both curiously mark'd, are very ravenous.</P>
<P>Here is also a deform'd slow creeping Beast call'd <HI>Ai,</HI> whose Head is like a Mans, and cover'd with rough and grey Hair, on each Foot three Claws close together, and at least a Finger long, sharp Teeth, a smooth high black Nose, little drowsie Eyes, no Ears, a Tail small above and broad at the bottom, long Ash-colour'd Hair over all the Body; and being about the bigness of a Fox, it climbs slowly up the Trees, and comes not down before it hath eaten off all the Leaves; it feeds also on Earth, and sometimes sits on a high Bough without Meat twenty days to∣gether; it goes so softly, that it will hardly clear fifty Paces in twenty four hours.</P>
<P>On this Island are likewise all sorts of Apes and Monkies, amongst which is one most remarkable, call'd <HI>The Zimme Cayon,</HI> hairy all over, with a long white Beard, an old Mans Face, bald Ears, black Eyes and long Tail, which they wind about a Bough, and so hanging, swing themselves from one Tree to another; they are very fierce as well as subtile, for being wounded with an Arrow, they set upon their Enemy without the least fear; when they climb up the Trees, they carry their Mouths and Hands full of Stones to throw at Travellers; and if any one of them chance to be wounded, all the rest that are near come to help him, and stop the Wound with Leaves, and the like; the young ones hang upon the Backs of their Dams, who run very swift with them, and leap from one Tree to another.</P>

<P><HI>Juan Ardenois</HI> relates, That the <HI>Coyons</HI> play at certain Games with the Natives for Money, and spend what they win in publick Houses.</P>
<P><HI>Joseph de Acosta</HI> tells us, That one of these kind of Creatures being sent to a Tavern for Wine, would not part with his Money before his Pot was fill'd, which he defen∣ded from the Boys that offer'd to take it from him, by throwing Stones at them; and though it lov'd Wine very well, yet brought it always home without tasting.</P>
<P>It is no less wonderful what <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> relates of one of these Creatures, <HI>viz.</HI> That observing one ready to fire a Gun at him, before he could discharge, it leap'd from the Tree and snatch'd up a Child, which he held as a Buckler before him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sagovin.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Sagovin</HI> resembles a Lyon in the fore-part of the Body, with shaggy Hair; they are exceeding dainty and tender, yet so stubborn and sullen, that they take pet at the least affront, and often pine themselves away and die with hunger.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Boyete,</HI> and other sorts of Ser∣pents.</NOTE>The Serpent <HI>Boy-ete,</HI> two Fathoms long, without Legs, having a bright speckled Skin and four sharp Teeth, wounds also mortally with its Tail; but is the less dan∣gerous, because at the end of the Tail grows a Bladder, which moving rattles as if there were Pease in it, which gives notice to the Traveller, though unwary, by which means he makes his escape.</P>
<P>The other Serpents call'd <HI>Jouboy, Tara-gouyboy,</HI> and <HI>Tarehuboy,</HI> serve the Natives for a great Delicacy; as also the great Toads or Frogs, call'd <HI>Tourourou.</HI></P>
<P>They have also a sort of Flies call'd <HI>Ton,</HI> which exceedingly molest them, against which their chiefest Medicine is Palm-tree Oyl, and the <HI>Roucou,</HI> with which they colour their Skins.</P>
<P>The Natives of this Island of <HI>Maragnan,</HI> driven out of the pleasant Countrey <HI>Cayete</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> are a sort of the <HI>Toupinambas,</HI> who Setled here about a hun∣dred and fifty years ago. The time of their first coming hither us'd formerly to be solemniz'd with the great Feast call'd <HI>Caoven;</HI> but because a Woman boldly set up∣on a Commander in his Cups, there arose a great Tumult amongst them, and ever since the Island hath been divided, one Party calling the other <HI>Tobaiares,</HI> that is,
<PB N="516" REF="344"/><HI>We are Enemies:</HI> They are so inveterate against one another, that who e're they take Prisoners they unmercifully devour: Both are of a middle Stature, have flat No∣ses, which the Midwive make at the Birth of the Child; they are generally a strong People, and many of them living a hundred years, without being grey, bald, or sick; they live temperate, and under a wholsom Climate: Some of their Women bear Children (as they say) till they are eighty years of age, which being born white, turn to be of a Tawny colour, by being anointed with Suet call'd <HI>Roucou,</HI> and Oyl; otherwise they are well proportion'd. The Men pluck out all the Hair of their Foreheads, but suffer it to hang pretty long over their Ears, and behind. The Women let their Hair hang down to their Middle, and wear woodden Ear-rings; but the Men hang green Beads in their Lips, and thrust, little Bones through their Noses. They go all stark naked; their Legs are colour'd black with the Juice of the Herb <HI>Junipap,</HI> and upon the other parts of their Body appear Fi∣gures of several Representations. Those that will manifest their Valor, and be ac∣counted hardy, gash their Bodies all over with Wounds, which they heal in such a manner, that the Scars may more plainly appear. They never come to their usual Feasts, but dress'd up in various colour'd Feathers; upon the Crown of their Heads they wear Caps stuck with Plumes, which they call <HI>Acangoap,</HI> or Coronets, call'd <HI>Acangerar;</HI> about their Necks, the Necklaces <HI>Aiouacava;</HI> over their Shoulders, the Man∣tles <HI>Assoyave;</HI> their Garters they call <HI>Tabacoura,</HI> at which they hang hollow Nut∣shells full of little Stones, which gingle and rattle as they go, and about their Arms Armlets call'd <HI>Mapouyh-couaychovare;</HI> all which are curiously checker'd with various colour'd Feathers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maragnans</HI> live not much up in the Countrey, but rather on the Sea-Coast, because of their Fishing, removing every sixth year, calling the Village where they Settle, by the former Name.</P>
<P>They take every Man as many Wives as he pleaseth; but the Women must stick each to one Man, unless she be Divorc'd from him, which often happens upon small occasions.</P>
<P>Their Cotton Hammocks call'd <HI>Yu,</HI> on which they sleep, hang between two Stakes, in which they lie.</P>
<P>Singular Friends and Relations Feast one another daily; but they are cruel and revengeful against their neighboring Enemies, whom, when they take any of them, they fatten, kill, and eat. The least affront done them, or injurious word spoken to them, or against their Predecessorss, makes them take up Arms, which consist of Bowes and Arrows, which they call <HI>Ouyrapar</HI> and <HI>Oune.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Relation of the Proceedings of the <HI>Netherland West-India</HI> Company in <HI>Brasile</HI> to the Year <HI>1658.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe chief Disturbers of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in the possession of the Countrey of <HI>Brasile,</HI> were the <HI>United Netherlanders;</HI> for they having had good success with their first Fleet, under the Command of <HI>John Molenaer, John Dignums∣zoon, John Schelinger, Simon Mau,</HI> and the Merchants <HI>Cornelis Woddman, Gerard Beveningen,</HI> and <HI>Heinier van Heb,</HI> Anno 1595. in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where they got such footing, that they took whole Kingdoms, to the great enriching of the Eastern World, where they spread their Trade over the whole Country, were thereupon emboldned to venture also to the West, that thereby they might cut off the Sinews of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Wars, he being continually supply'd with Treasures from <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>The grand Promoters of this Design were the Company of Merchants, who hi∣therto had Traded to <HI>Guinee;</HI> and the rather, because <HI>Guinee</HI> brought them but little Profit. But to set upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Power, was a Business of no small Consequence; nevertheless they undertaking it, obtain'd Letters Patents from the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Netherlands,</HI> Anno 1621. for erecting of a <HI>West-India</HI> Company, in which it was declar'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>West-India</HI> Company erected by the <HI>Ʋnited States.</HI></NOTE> That none without the said Companies leave should drive any Trade to <HI>Africa</HI> from the Northern <HI>Tropick,</HI> to the Cape <HI>Bonne Esperance;</HI> nor to <HI>America</HI> from <HI>Terre-Neuf</HI> to the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> or <HI>Le Maire;</HI> nor in the South Sea to <HI>Anian;</HI> which if any attempted, they should forfeit Ship and Goods; besides several other Priviledges and Immunities granted towards the promoting and establishing of the said Company.

<PB N="519" REF="351"/>This flight of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> encouraging <HI>Peter Hein,</HI> he went with fourteen Boats, each Mann'd with two hun dred Arm'd Men upon the very Mouths of the Can∣nons to the fore-mention'd Battlement and took the same, notwithstanding the Stone Wall rose eight Foot out of the Water, and above a hundred <HI>Portuguese</HI> de∣fended it, whilest the Admiral <HI>Willekens</HI> sent twelve hundred Soldiers, and two hun∣dred and forty Seamen ashore with Field-Pieces. The Forlorn-Hope consisted of sixty Musquetteers, led by Captain <HI>Helmond,</HI> who was seconded by Lieutenant <HI>La Main,</HI> all the Seamen following with Spades and Pick-axes; the Reserve was brought up by Captain <HI>Kyf, Ysenach,</HI> and <HI>William Schouten;</HI> thus drawn out, they were led towards the City by the Guides <HI>Dirk Colver</HI> and <HI>Dirk de Ruiter,</HI> along a nar∣row Way, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> might have guarded with a few Men, had they not been all struck with a pannick fear, and making use of the dark Night, fled into the Woods. The <HI>Dutch</HI> found in the City an incredible Booty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St. Salvador</HI> taken by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></NOTE> because the Gover∣nor <HI>Diego Mendoza de Furtado</HI> had forbid the carrying away of any Goods, that so the Citizens might be the easier perswaded to defend the City; which they might well have done, had they not been surpris'd with the suddenness of the Action; for when <HI>Willekens</HI> Anchor'd here, there were above sixteen hundred Soldiers, besides a considerable number of Arm'd Citizens in <HI>St. Salvador;</HI> besides, in the Forts about the City on the Walls lay twenty three Brass, and twenty six Iron Guns.</P>
<P>This Victory was scarce obtain'd, when Colonel <HI>Dorth,</HI> who had lost the Fleet at <HI>Point Vincent,</HI> arriv'd here after all was done, and caus'd Edicts to be publish'd, in which the fled Citizens were promis'd greater Priviledges under the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Protection, than ever they had under the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> Whereupon a few <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> return'd to the City; but the greatest part of them, and those the most consi∣derable, were partly kept back by Command of the Bishop <HI>Teixera,</HI> who laid the fault concerning the loss of the City on the Governor <HI>Furtado,</HI> and partly because they judg'd the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> unable to defend them against the <HI>Spanish</HI> Power.</P>
<P>About the same time several rich laden Vessels arriv'd there from <HI>Lisbon, Janeiro, Spirito Santo, Angola</HI> and other Places, all ignorant of the Conquest of <HI>St. Salvador.</HI></P>
<P>Whilest <HI>Dorth</HI> and <HI>Willekens</HI> were ordering all things within the City, the out∣staying <HI>Portuguese</HI> at last taking courage, Storm'd the City from Midnight till the next day in the Afternoon, but fearing they should be set upon behind unawares, Retreated; after which <HI>Dorth</HI> thinking he had been free from all fear of Enemies, and with a small Guard riding out of the City to take a view of the adjacent Coun∣trey, was scarce got a Bowe-shot from the Walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. <HI>Dorth</HI> kill'd by an Ambuscade.</NOTE> when a great Body of <HI>Brasilians</HI> rush'd forth unexpectedly from an Ambuscade, and wounded him so mortally, that he fell dead from his Horse, and had his Head suddenly chopt off, and his Body mangled very terribly.</P>
<P><HI>Allart Schouten</HI> being chosen Governor in <HI>Dorth's</HI> stead, took no care to fortifie the City; and after his Decease his Brother <HI>William Schouten</HI> succeeding him, regarded it less, so that all things went to ruine, every one striving onely to enrich themselves. Amongst other Booties, they took the rich laden Vessel which <HI>Francisco de Sarmiento,</HI> Governor of <HI>Chili,</HI> brought to <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> with fifty eight thousand <HI>Guilders,</HI> and a much greater sum of Gold and Pearls, all which was imbezled away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>St. Salva∣dor.</HI></NOTE>This City <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> built by <HI>Thomas de Sosa</HI> along the Sea-side, runs up broad at the Suburb <HI>Carmo,</HI> hath four Market-places, into the biggest whereof, being of a long square, run nine Streets, the chief of which being very broad, hath many stately Houses. The second Market-place is of like form, onely it winds a little to∣wards the Right, and at the Entrance stands a strong Prison. The Cloyster <HI>St. Francis,</HI> inhabited by <HI>Jesuits,</HI> stands in a Park near the Wall by which the Moat runs. To∣wards
<PB N="520" REF="352"/>the Sea-side they have a second Structure, much statelier than the <HI>Franciscan</HI> Cloyster. Near the Prison stands the Armory, and somewhat farther the great Church, which <HI>Anno</HI> 1624. was not quite finish'd. The Church dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> appears with a high Spire near the Gate <HI>Bento,</HI> without which the great Cloyster <HI>Bento</HI> is built; but the chief Church is <HI>St. Salvador.</HI> On the utmost Point towards the South-West of the City lies the Fort <HI>Antonio,</HI> between which and the City stands a very neat Pleasure-house, belonging to the Bishop. Besides <HI>Antonio</HI> there are four other considerable Forts, <HI>viz. Diego, St. Maria, De Gracia,</HI> and <HI>Vittoria,</HI> About half way between <HI>Vittoria</HI> and the Cloyster <HI>Bento,</HI> stands the Castle with four Bulwarks; but on the North-side the City is guarded by the Forts <HI>St. Peter, Philippo,</HI> and <HI>Tapecipe.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Fleet set out by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for the reco∣very the reco∣very of <HI>St. Salvador.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Spanish</HI> King seeming exceedingly concern'd at the loss of so eminent a Place, fitted out a great Fleet for the recovery of what had been taken from him; but the <HI>Netherland West-India</HI> Company having notice of it, put themselves into a posture of Defence, and in a short time made ready eighteen Men of War and seven Ketches, Mann'd with a thousand six hundred and ninety Seamen, and a thousand three hun∣dred and fifty Land-Soldiers, <HI>John Dirkszoon Lam</HI> being Admiral: But news coming day after day of the extraordinary Preparations in <HI>Spain,</HI> it was judg'd convenient to strengthen the Fleet with fourteen Ships and two Ketches more, carrying a thou∣sand four hundred and thirty Seamen, and five hundred eighty Soldiers, under the Command of General <HI>Boudewyn Henrickszoon,</HI> and Admiral <HI>Andries Veron.</HI> Moreover, the <HI>West-India</HI> Company fitted out a third Fleet, consisting of four Frigats and three Ketches, Commanded by <HI>Henry Kat,</HI> with Orders to Cruise along the <HI>Spanish</HI> Coast.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Year 1625. <HI>Frederick de Toledo</HI> weighed Anchor from <HI>Cales</HI> with one and thirty Gallions, four Pinnaces, three Tartans, and a Carvel, all carrying seventy five hundred Men. The Soldiers were divided into three Regiments, Commanded by the Colonels <HI>Pedro Osorio, Juan Orellana,</HI> and the Mar∣quess <HI>De Torreclusa.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>St. Jago</HI> at the <HI>African</HI> Cape <HI>Verde, Toledo</HI> joyn'd with the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Fleet, consisting of twenty one Gallions and fourteen Carvels and Barques, Mann'd with four thousand Seamen, two Regiments of Soldiers, Commanded by <HI>Antonio Nunnez Barreio,</HI> and <HI>Francisco de Almeida;</HI> but the chief Commander of this Fleet was <HI>Emanuel Meneses.</HI> Which great Fleet being arriv'd at <HI>St. Salvador, Toledo</HI> himself Landed at the Fort <HI>Antonio,</HI> leaving the Command of the Fleet to <HI>Juan Fajardo:</HI> The first thing he did, was to set upon the Cloyster <HI>Bento;</HI> which having gain'd, he left Serjeant <HI>Troppani</HI> with two Regiments in the same, whilest he went and Storm'd the <HI>Carme∣lites</HI> Minster, and at last took it; but in the mean time four hundred <HI>Hollanders</HI> Sal∣lying out, made a furious Onset upon the two Regiments, who had possession of the Cloyster <HI>Bento,</HI> where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sustain'd considerable damage; for besides the wounding of three Captains, and the loss of a great number of Soldiers, there were slain the Commanders <HI>Emanuel Aquitara, Alonso de Gana, Pedro San Stevan, Diego Espi∣nosa,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Pedro Osorio.</HI> But <HI>Toledo</HI> no whit dismay'd hereat, but taking fresh courage, brought twenty nine Demi-Culverins ashore, which fir'd so vehemently out of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> and <HI>Bento's</HI> Cloysters, on the seventeen <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships that lay near the Shore, that several of them were sunk, and others shatter'd beyond hopes of ever being repair'd. After this the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army was divided into three several Parties, which continually fir'd on the City from three new rais'd Works; the chiefest Party, which was in the <HI>Carmelites</HI> Minster, had twenty three Brass Guns; the secon'd, plac'd on the great Wall of the Cloyster <HI>Bento,</HI> fir'd Night and Day with eight Demy-Cannons on the City, in which all things were in a confusion,
<PB N="521" REF="352"/>whilest the Governor <HI>William Schouten</HI> went unconcern'd from one Tavern to ano∣ther railing at the Soldiers, who thereupon mutinying and deposing him, chose Serjeant <HI>Hans Ernst Kyf</HI> in his room, who, as he was calling a Council of War, re∣ceiv'd a Summons from <HI>Toledo</HI> to deliver up the City; at which <HI>Kyf</HI> being much surpris'd, sent a Drummer with a Letter to <HI>Toledo,</HI> desiring him to grant the Be∣sieged three Weeks time to repair and make fit their batter'd Vessels to carry them back for <HI>Holland;</HI> and also that they might, according to Martial Custom, march out with lighted Matches, flying Colours, Bullets in their Mouths, and with Bag and Baggage. To which <HI>Toledo</HI> return'd Answer, That he was now in his own Countrey, and had gotten possession of four Fortifications about <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> on which he had planted thirty seven Cannons, and therefore saw no such necessity to grant the Besieged (who could not possibly expect any fresh Supplies) such advan∣tageous and bold Demands; and onely promis'd them their Lives should be at his discretion. Yet at last <HI>William Stoop, Hugh Antoniszoon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St. Salvador</HI> re-taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the <HI>Hol∣landers.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Francis du Chesne</HI> being sent to the <HI>Carmelites</HI> Cloyster, agreed with <HI>Toledo</HI> on these Conditions: <HI>That the</HI> Hollanders <HI>should surrender</HI> St. Salvador <HI>in the Condition it was then in, march out unarm'd, but with Baggage, and have a free Pussage with Provisions and all things necessary allow'd them for their Trasportation for</HI> Holland. Whereupon on the first of <HI>May</HI> the City was de∣liver'd up to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in such disorder, that some of them had taken possession of the Gate <HI>Bento,</HI> before those on the other side of the City knew of any Agree∣ment that was made between <HI>Toledo</HI> and Colonel <HI>Kyf.</HI> And thus the Place which had a whole year been under the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> fell again under the possession of the Spanish Crown, onely through the indiscreet management of the Commanders; for otherwise it was sufficiently strong, and well stor'd with Am∣munition and Men, being able to make out two thousand. Moreover, the Ketch <HI>De Haes,</HI> was set out before from the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, and brought news of the Forces that were sent from the <HI>Netherland</HI> Havens to their assistance: But the Ships under Admiral <HI>Lam,</HI> as also those under <HI>Boudewyn Henriczoon,</HI> were stay'd a considerable time in their Harbors by contrary Winds, and at last reaching the <HI>Line</HI> were be∣calm'd, and through the excessive heat of the Climate many Men lost by raging and mortal Distempers, insomuch that they reach'd not the Bay <HI>Todos los Sanctos</HI> before the twenty sixth of <HI>May,</HI> on which they saw the <HI>Spanish</HI> Flag streaming from the Walls of <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> and fifty great Ships riding at an Anchor near the Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Netherland</HI> Fleet, divided into four Squadrons, consisted of thirty four Sail, amongst which <HI>Lam</HI> carry'd the Flag on the Main-top, the Vice-Admiral <HI>Adrian Cheszoon</HI> on the Fore-top, the Rere-Admiral <HI>Adries Veron</HI> on the Main-mast, and the Commander of the fourth Squadron on the Mizne-top: All of them seeing the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> absolute Masters, judg'd it most convenient to put to Sea; but standing a pretty while to the South, they found that the strong Current drove them to the Shelves on the West-side of the Inlet; wherefore Tacking about, they made towards the Enemy, who at first seem'd to meet them with twenty eight great Ships, but re∣turning towards the City, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> also stood to Sea again, Steering Southerly, though without making much advantage in their Way, the Sea going very hollow, and the strong Current setting them towards the Shore, by which means they were in no small danger before the River <HI>Francisco,</HI> where many of the Men dy'd for want of fresh Provisions, and the number of the Sick increas'd daily, insomuch that some of the Ships were like to perish for want of Men to guide them: It was also judg'd dangerous to lie longer with such a great Fleet near a Lea-Shore, herefore they put into the Inlet <HI>Trayciaon,</HI> which lies a League to the Northward of he River <HI>Monguapigape,</HI> from whence a ridge of Rocks extends to <HI>Tayciaon,</HI> and being
<PB N="522" REF="353"/>overflow'd at High-water, hath three Openings or Entrances, two for great Ships, and one, the most Northern, for small Vessels to pass through: The Sea also break∣ing against this Cliff never molests the Ships whatever Winds blow. The Coun∣trey is overgrown with Brambles, and hath a Lake two Leagues long, and a quar∣ter broad, on the opposite Shore of which stood a Village, inhabited by <HI>Portugueses</HI> and <HI>Brasilians;</HI> but the <HI>Portugueses</HI> flying from thence left the <HI>Brasilians</HI> in absolute possession: The <HI>Hollanders</HI> going thither found thirty Chests of Sugar in one Hut; after which the Admiral <HI>Lam</HI> caus'd his sick Men to be brought ashore, whilest the Captains <HI>Boshuisen, Swart, Dyke, Stapels,</HI> and <HI>Uzeel,</HI> march'd up into the Countrey, where they got plenty of Oranges and Cattel. In the mean time the Ketch <HI>Vosken,</HI> Mann'd with thirty six Seamen, Cruising along the Sea-Coast of <HI>Brasile,</HI> took three Ships, one out of the Inlet <HI>Todos los Sanctos,</HI> laden with Sugar and Tobacco, ano∣ther with the same Merchandise from <HI>Pernambuco,</HI> and the third laden with Wines from <HI>Madera.</HI> On the first of <HI>August</HI> the Fleet set Sail again, to the great sorrow of the <HI>Brasilians,</HI> who out of hopes of being protected by them against the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> had joyn'd their Forces with theirs; but now being forsaken, they expected no∣thing but utter Ruine; which to escape, many of them desir'd to be admitted to go along with the Fleet, which had been granted them, had not the <HI>Hollanders</HI> wanted Provisions for themselves. The Fleet getting off at Sea, the Admiral <HI>Veron</HI> ran with twelve Sail to the Coast of <HI>Africa;</HI> and <HI>Boudewyn Henrickszoon</HI> kept eighteen Ships under his Command, the rest returning home with Admiral <HI>Lam:</HI> and thus the Fleet left the unfortunate Haven <HI>Trayciaon,</HI> where above seven hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> Seamen were bury'd. <HI>Boudewyn Henrickszoon</HI> refreshing at <HI>Cape St. Vincent,</HI> steer'd Westerly, when a Storm (which in twenty four hours blew from all Points of the Compass) surprising him, broke his Main-mast, separated the whole Fleet, and sunk the <HI>Flushing</HI> Frigat; at last getting beyond the Isle <HI>Virgin Gorda,</HI> the Fleet meet∣ing again, got to <HI>Juan de Porto Rico</HI> about the latter end of <HI>September;</HI> into whose Haven <HI>Henrickszoon</HI> Sail'd with great courage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Porto Rico</HI> surpriz'd by <HI>Henrickszoon</HI></NOTE> notwithstanding the narrow Mouth thereof was guarded by a strong Fort full of Brass Guns, which fir'd very fiercely upon him, who on the other side was not idle in discharging his Guns on the Fort; and had not the shallow Water before the City prevented his Landing that day, he had gotten a far greater Booty than afterwards he met with; for the Inhabitants had, during the Low-water, remov'd all their best Goods: but the next Morning before Sun-rising, the Admiral Landed with eight hundred Men, march'd into the City without any resistance, pitch'd the <HI>States</HI> Flag on the Governor's House, guar∣ded all Avenues, unhoop'd all the Wine-Casks which he found there, for fear his Men should make themselves Drunk therewith, and so neglect their Duty, fir'd from the Land-side towards the Castle with three Brass Guns, gain''d the Re∣doubt, built for the security of the Bridge, which unites the small Isle on which <HI>Porto Rico</HI> is built with the great, rais'd a Platform, from whence he fir'd Day and Night with six Cannons, guarded by Captain <HI>Thyene,</HI> whilest the Commander <HI>Uzeel</HI> kept Watch near the Fort; but his Men being most of them sick, he could not do any great Exploits, especially since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Sallying out, as they did daily, kill'd many of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt <HI>Ʋzeel</HI> slain.</NOTE> and amongst them Captain <HI>Uzeel,</HI> after he had shot down two Turrets from the Castle; which damage the Enemy repair'd by taking several of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Boats; by which means they could not prevent fresh Sup∣plies from going to the Castle; the Besiegers in the mean time beginning daily to be in greater want for Ammunition and Provisions: whereupon <HI>Henrickszoon</HI> judg'd it convenient to sound a Retreat, after he had set the Ships belonging to the City <HI>Porto Rico</HI> on fire in four places. In which Retreat he receiv'd so many
<PB N="523" REF="353"/>farewel Shots from the Fort, that they were forc'd to go to the Leeward to stop their Leaks, and leave one of their Ships to the Enemy, in lieu whereof the <HI>West-Capel</HI> Frigat took a Barque with four Brass Guns, in the little Haven <HI>Sierra Gorda;</HI> from whence the Fleet ran into the Western Bay of the Island <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> where whilest they repair'd and took in fresh Provisions, <HI>Henrickszoon</HI> sent the Ships <HI>Hester</HI> and <HI>Jonas</HI> richly laden for <HI>Holland;</HI> the remaining part of the Fleet meeting with strong contrary Tydes at <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> were necessitated to put into the Inlet <HI>Francisco,</HI> where they made several Marches up into the Countrey, to the loss of many of their Men, which were kill'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> lying in Ambuscade amongst the Bram∣bles that grew along by the Ways.</P>

After this he taking in fresh Provisions at <HI>St. Fe,</HI> discover'd <HI>Aves,</HI> a low Isle full of high Trees, took above two hundred Sheep, and abundance of red Wood on <HI>Bonaire,</HI> and before the Coast a <HI>Spanish</HI> Frigat richly laden, made Inspe∣ctions into the Havens of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> and <HI>Jamaica;</HI> from whence he fell back on the Coast of <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> about the Island <HI>Mona,</HI> where discovering four <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships, he took three of them, and burnt the fourth; he also got abundance of Tortoises and Crocodiles on the great <HI>Caiman,</HI> and took a new Ship between the little sandy Isles <HI>Caios,</HI> as also before <HI>Cuba</HI> a Barque, which inform'd him, That the Fleet from the <HI>Honduras,</HI> as also that from <HI>New Spain,</HI> was daily expected at <HI>Havana:</HI> Thence Sail∣ing into the Haven <HI>Cabannas,</HI> he took a new Vessel of a hundred Tun, and abundance of Timber and Carpenters Tools one the Shore; he Landed also with seven hun∣dred Men on the East-side of the Haven, from whence he march'd along a narrow Path a League up into the Countrey, where he found a running Stream, Pastures full of Cattel, and a Village, the Inhabitants whereof being warn'd by the Barking of their Dogs, fled, and left all manner of fresh Provisions to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> viz. above two thousand Oranges, abundance of Lemmons, <HI>Bananas,</HI> Hogs, Calves, and Bacon; all which having sent aboard, they burnt the Village: After this they took a <HI>Spanish</HI> Barque before <HI>Havana,</HI> as also a Ship laden with Timber, another Barque with Poultry, <HI>Cochenile,</HI> Money, and Haberdashery Ware, one Vessel with live Tor∣toises, and another full of Salt, dry'd Fish, and some Merchandise.

<P>In our foregoing Relation we have given you an Account of the Fleet which came to assist the City of <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> divided into two Squadrons; eighteen Sail <HI>Boudewyn Henrickszoon</HI> kept under his Command, and twelve Sail remain'd in the Admiral <HI>Veron</HI>'s Squadron, who Sail'd to the Inlet <HI>Serre Leona,</HI> where he found the Admiral <HI>John Dirkszoon Lam</HI> with three Ships, which had lay'n there above two Moneths, by reason of the Sickness amongst the Seamen.</P>
<P><HI>Frambore,</HI> King of this Place, granted <HI>Lam</HI> and <HI>Veron</HI> free liberty to Hunt, and to gather as many Oranges and Lemmons as they pleas'd, with which the Seamen were so refresh'd, that they set Sail again, and amongst many other things carry'd a Baboon with them from <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange kind of Ba∣boon.</NOTE> which so exactly resembled a Man, that it was wonderful to behold, having a Body, Hands, Eyes, Ears, Feet, and Actions like a Man, smoak'd Tobacco amongst the Seamen, made a noise like a Child when beaten. The Inhabitants of <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> where these Monsters run in great Com∣panies through the Woods, believe that the Souls of the Deceased reside in them.</P>
<P><HI>John de Laet,</HI> in his annual Journal of the Transactions of the <HI>West-India</HI> Com∣pany, affirms, That he saw a Female of these monstrous Creatures, which usually had her monethly Flowers.</P>
<P>The Fleet, as is before mention'd, Sailing from <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> came to an Anchor at <HI>Commany,</HI> and Landed twelve hundred Men at <HI>Poquena,</HI> besides a hundred and fifty <HI>Negro's;</HI> which Regiment <HI>Andries Veron</HI> and <HI>Arend Jacobszoon</HI> carry'd to the Castle <HI>Del Mine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI> ill success before the Castle <HI>Del Mine.</HI></NOTE> whither they before sent a Company, Commanded by <HI>Hans Gryf,</HI> to prevent the Sallies of the Enemy. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> tir'd and thirsty, Encamp'd themselves near the Fort, and whilest some of the Men were seeking for Water, others smoaking Tobacco, and lying without their Arms and in disorder on the Ground, and the Commanders were taking a view of the Fort from a neighboring Hill, two hundred <HI>Negro's</HI> fell upon the scatter'd Army with great rage and fury, and so much the greater, in regard the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had promis'd them great sums of Money for every <HI>Hollander</HI> they kill'd: never any Army was in such a distraction, they being dispers'd and kill'd like so many Sheep, the Admiral <HI>Veron</HI> and all the Officers slain, and in a short time four hundred and forty Men cut off; and had not Captain <HI>Arend Jacobszoon</HI> been in League with the Inhabitants of <HI>Commany,</HI> whi∣ther the routed Regiments fled, not one Man had escap'd that bloody Slaughter: Nor was it to much purpose to Besiege the Castle <HI>Del Mine,</HI> because the Bullets hit∣ting against the Walls of the Castle, built all of Rock-stones, did no Execution. But the four Ships inform'd of this miserable destruction, fell down to <HI>Commany,</HI> to fetch those that were left alive, and return'd home with the other eleven.</P>
<P>During the unfortunate Expedition of this Fleet, the <HI>West-India Company</HI> fitted out nine great Ships and five Ketches in the beginning of the Year 1626. under the Command of <HI>Peter Peterszoon Hein,</HI> to Cruise for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships that were expe∣cted from <HI>New Spain</HI> and <HI>Honduras.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Fox</HI> Frigat being sent before to inform <HI>Henrickszoon</HI> of <HI>Heyn</HI>'s coming, reach'd about the latter end of <HI>May</HI> beyond the Isles <HI>Dominico, Guadalupa, Mevis, St. Christo∣phers,</HI> and by <HI>Santa Crux;</HI> there not finding a Harbor on the South-side, because of the Rocks, she Sail'd from <HI>Mona</HI> over to the Main Coast, where seven Leagues West∣ward of <HI>Carakess,</HI> he discover'd a high broken Land, whose Mountains seem'd to reach to the Clouds; from thence she steer'd to the Promontory <HI>Caldera,</HI> the Isles
<PB N="525" REF="354"/><HI>Margareta</HI> and <HI>Coche,</HI> on which last he took abundance of Goats, not without the loss of forty six Men, kill'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Mean while the Admiral <HI>Peter Heyn,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> Sail'd to the Southward of <HI>Barbados,</HI> Island pretty mountainous, as hath been formerly men∣tion'd, and full of Woods, and by <HI>Martinino,</HI> whose Hills are very high and over∣grown with Trees. Here <HI>Peter Heyn</HI> could get nothing else but sweet Water, and a Fruit resembling a green Grape, which grew on a round Leav'd Tree, whose Juice cur'd the Scurvey. Sailing from hence, and Landing on <HI>Guadalupa,</HI> he found a <HI>Canoo</HI> seven Fathom long and one broad, and cut out of one Tree. The Inhabi∣tants, a well timber'd People, went stark naked, and desir'd to be excus'd, that they could not furnish the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with more Provisions, because the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> Inhabitants of <HI>St. Christophers,</HI> had pillag'd them.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Mona</HI> the <HI>Fox</HI> Frigat joyn'd with the Fleet, with information, that he could hear no tydings of <HI>Henrickszoon;</HI> wherefore <HI>Peter Heyn</HI> judg'd it convenient to Sail along the South-Coast of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> with a separated Fleet, which was to joyn again near the great <HI>Caiman.</HI> Near <HI>Cape de Corientes</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> took a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship laden with <HI>Sarsaparilla;</HI> after that another with Salt and Fish, and on the Shelves before <HI>Coche</HI> before the Promontory <HI>Antonio,</HI> a Fly-boat with Tallow and Hides, and at the same places two Vessels more with Ballast, the Men whereof inform'd him, that the Fleet from <HI>New Spain</HI> had about a Moneth before weigh'd Anchor from the Haven <HI>Juan de Ulva,</HI> and set Sail to <HI>Havana,</HI> so that without doubt they were arri∣ved there; wherefore <HI>Peter Heyn</HI> steer'd towards <HI>Tortugos,</HI> in hopes, if he could, to overtake some of the heavy Sailers. Before the Promontory <HI>De Florida</HI> he disco∣ver'd seven Sail, and coming up nearer, above thirty, which, had <HI>Henrickszoon</HI> been united with <HI>Peter Heyn,</HI> had without doubt fallen into the hands of the <HI>Netherlanders;</HI> but it being judg'd a madness to set upon so great a Fleet with so small a number of Ships, they Sail'd away undisturb'd. <HI>Peter Heyn</HI> steer'd his Course along <HI>Florida,</HI> where he met three <HI>Canoos</HI> with strange Men in them, who came aboard of him, their Bodies being naked, were painted with several colours, onely Mats of Rushes about their Middle, and on their Backs long Tassels hanging down: their Mer∣chandise consisted of a sort of Gum of little value. The <HI>Netherlanders</HI> in this Place took also a Vessel with <HI>Sina</HI> Leaves, and some pounds of Ambergreece: but the Scurvey increasing daily amongst them, they Tack'd about, and ran to an Anchor at <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> where they stay'd till the latter end of <HI>January</HI> 1627. and then set Sail to <HI>Brasile,</HI> and overtook a Vessel from <HI>Madera</HI> laden with a hundred and fifty Pipes of Wine, and other rich Goods, and ran into the Inlet <HI>Todos los Sanctos</HI> with undaun∣ted courage, not regarding the Guns that were fir'd from the Fort and Battlements of the City <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> near which lay thirty Sail of Ships, to which he making up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Success of the <HI>Dutch</HI> against the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> Fleet.</NOTE> steer'd between the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Admiral and Rere-Admiral, whom sinking, he forc'd the Admiral to surrender, whilest the <HI>Hollandia</HI> and <HI>Geldria</HI> Frigats fell upon the rest, which were forsaken by the Seamen, who leap'd over-board; then several Mann'd Boats of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> (notwithstanding the Enemy's continual firing) went and fetch'd off twenty two Sail of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vessels; all which they did in three hours time, onely with the loss of fifty Men, besides some that were wounded, amongst whom was the Admiral, being shot with a Bullet through the Arm, and wounded in the Legs with a Splinter; his Ship also was, with the <HI>Gelria</HI> Frigat, driven with the Spring-Tide on a Bank, whence, after the <HI>Gelria</HI> had receiv'd above sixty Shot from the Enemy, they both got off at last; but the Admiral's, Frigat be∣ing shot in a manner to a Wreck, was set on fire; which Misfortune ended not there, for the <HI>Orange-tree</HI> Frigat blew up, with sixty Men, fourteen whereof, though mise∣rably
<PB N="526" REF="355"/>scorch'd, had their Lives sav'd. Soon after which the Admiral sent into <HI>Holland</HI> the Ship <HI>St. Peter,</HI> the <HI>Hoop, Nostra Sennora de la Vittoria,</HI> and the <HI>Black-Lyon,</HI> which besides their Lading of Hides, Silver, Gold, and Precious Stones, were most of them full of Sugar; which safely arriving, did not a little encourage the <HI>West-India</HI> Company. After this <HI>Heyn</HI> took two Ships with Slaves from <HI>Angola,</HI> which because the Governor of <HI>St. Salvador</HI> would not redeem, were put ashore on <HI>Taperica.</HI> On the last of <HI>March</HI> he set Sail from the Inlet <HI>Todos los Sanctos,</HI> pass'd by <HI>Mono Pablo,</HI> and on <HI>Easter</HI> Eve with a strong Gale by the <HI>Abrolhos:</HI> before the High∣land between <HI>Cape Frio</HI> and the River <HI>De Jenero,</HI> he discover'd two Sail, one whereof being laden with Sugar was taken, but the other escap'd in the Night; then Sail∣ing on to the meandring Stream <HI>Spirito Sancto,</HI> he digg'd Pits on some of the River-Isles to get fresh Water, because it was not safe to Land on the Continent on each side, because the Inhabitants shot frequent showers of Arrows from the Thickets, in which they lay ambuscaded. Moreover the Town <HI>Spirito Sancto</HI> sent off several Fire-ships at the time of Flood, but they being easily quench'd did no harm. Here also a Vessel laden at <HI>Lisbon</HI> with Wines and Piece-Goods, was taken by <HI>Heyn,</HI> who setting Sail again divided the Fleet into three Squadrons, the Vice-Admiral <HI>Cor∣nelis Oole</HI> keeping three Ships to Cruise withal before the River <HI>La Plata, Henrick Best</HI> had one Frigat, a Ketch, and a Carvel, to guard the Mouth of the Stream <HI>Jenero,</HI> whilest the Admiral himself Sail'd with four Frigats, three Ketches, and a Barque, towards the Inlet <HI>Todos los Sanctos,</HI> where two Ships riding near the Shore by the Fort <HI>Tapecipe,</HI> were by him set on fire. Also taking a Barque he was inform'd, that six laden Vessels lay in the River <HI>Tapecipe,</HI> whither he sending some Boats to explore the truth, they found a great Ship without Men in the Mouth of the Stream, and half a League farther six <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vessels lying near the Shore; bringing back news thereof to the Admiral, he went aboard of the <HI>Fox</HI> Ketch the next Morning, and taking two Ketches and several Boats with him, Sail'd up the River, and per∣ceiv'd that the fore-mention'd six Ships were gotten up higher, and were Mann'd with a hundred and fifty Soldiers, Commanded by Captain <HI>Padilha;</HI> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Admiral lying in Ambuscade, no sooner perceiv'd the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Boats, but he let flie a whole Volley of small Shot at them, insomuch that it made them Retreat, and their whole Design had been fruitless, had not <HI>Heyn</HI> animated his Men to board the Vice-Admiral; which encouragement prov'd so successful that they master'd the same, killing all those that fell into their hands; which so amaz'd the two Vessels that lay by, that all the Men swam ashore, and left their rich Lading to the disposal of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> besides which the vanquish'd Party lost above a hundred and fifty Men, and the Conquerors but fifteen. Somewhat farther up lay three Ships more, but the River being dry there at Low-water, and so narrow that the Trees on each Shore could touch one another, <HI>Heyn</HI> judg'd it convenient to prosecute the Design no farther, but to return with the three for-mention'd Prizes, which he did not without great difficulty; for the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had rais'd Battlements on each side of the Mouth of the River <HI>Tapecipe,</HI> and stopt the same with a sunk Vessel, which <HI>Heyn</HI> himself set on fire at Low-water, and return'd untouch'd through thick Volleys of Shot, which flew about his Ears to the Fleet, leaving the three Ships to be fetcht off afterwards; to which end he commanded that they should hang some of the taken Hides about the <HI>Fox</HI> Ketch's Pinnace, the Carvel and Boats, that so the Men which were in them might stand secure from the small Shot, and the rather, be∣cause the Ships could not be got out of the shallow and narrow River but by Toe∣ing. Mean while the Governor of <HI>St. Salvador</HI> lay with a considerable number of Citizens and Soldiers behind the fore-mention'd Battlements, not doubting but to
<PB N="527" REF="355"/>take revenge for the Losses sustain'd by <HI>Heyn;</HI> who nevertheless coming down thi∣ther Toed out the three Prize-ships with Boats hung about with Hides, firing into the Enemies Battlements with his great Guns, which he had put aboard of the <HI>Fox</HI> Ketch. About the middle of <HI>June</HI> he took in the Prize-goods in view of the City <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> where seven <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships from several places lay at an Anchor. Setting Sail from hence on the fourteenth of <HI>July,</HI> and reaching <HI>Noronho,</HI> known by a Mountain which appears like a Steeple, he met with <HI>Cornelis Oole</HI>'s Fleet, (who had been Cruising before <HI>La Plata</HI>) with whom he arriv'd safe in the <HI>Texel,</HI> having in their Way thither from <HI>Noronho</HI> taken a Prize, laden with Sugar, Tobacco, and <HI>Brasile</HI> Wood.</P>

<PB N="533" REF="358"/>a strange manner; he had ninety Musquetteers for his Guard, whose Matches were all put out, and their Arms all wet by a great shower of Rain, which they perceiving from their Ambuscades, immediately got cross the River, and kill'd thirty of the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> the rest running away, left <HI>Ita</HI> to defend himself, which he did for some time with his Sword, but had absolutely been slain, had he not re∣ceiv'd Aid from <HI>Olinda.</HI></P>
<P>Because the <HI>Portuguese</HI> made several Attempts upon the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> not with∣out damage on both sides, the <HI>West-India</HI> Company often sent Ships to their assi∣stance; and likewise many <HI>Brasilians</HI> deserting the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> joyn'd with the <HI>Ne∣therlanders,</HI> who built a five-corner'd Fort with Bulwarks about the Cloyster on <HI>An∣tonio Vaes;</HI> which to prevent, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> ventur'd many a Sally, though not with∣out considerable loss on their part. They also reported, that <HI>Frederick de Toledo</HI> was making thither with a great Fleet, to drive the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> out of <HI>Brasile;</HI> at which they taking the Alarm, put themselves all into a posture of Defence, rais'd new Works about the Castle on <HI>Reciffa,</HI> whilest the Ships which Cruis'd on that Coast brought in several Prizes.</P>
<P><HI>John Walbeek</HI> being chosen General by the <HI>West-India</HI> Company over <HI>Brasile,</HI> had a Design on the Promontory <HI>St. Augustine;</HI> but it came to no effect, because the Sea beat so vehemently against the Shore.</P>

<P><HI>Joost Bankart</HI> was also sent out in <HI>March</HI> with eight Ships to <HI>St. Helena,</HI> to Cruise there for the rich <HI>Carraks</HI> which us'd to Water there; but though he stay'd till <HI>Au∣gust</HI> before this fruitful Island, yet saw not one Ship at Sea, nor a Man on the Island, but great numbers of Sea-pies, which are so tame, that they suffer themselves to be taken up with the Hand, or knock'd on the Head with Sticks.</P>
<P>Near this Isle <HI>Ita</HI> took a Ketch Prize, and rallying his whole Fleet together, Steer'd for the <HI>Caimans;</HI> the most Eastern Isle whereof being about three Leagues long, is full of Rocks, with a high Point on the East; the other part thereof is plain.

<P><HI>Joachim Guysen</HI> being made Commander of the <HI>Dolphin</HI> Frigat, and sent to joyn with Admiral <HI>Pater</HI>'s Squadron, was driven below <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and at last strook against the great <HI>Caiman,</HI> where his Vessel was all shatter'd to pieces; but all his Men and Goods being sav'd, he spent sixteen Weeks in making a Ketch of the pieces of the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> and brought a hundred and twenty Men, four Brass, and two Iron Guns to the Fleet, having buried the rest on <HI>Caiman.</HI></P>
<P>Five Leagues beyond <HI>Havana,</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship laden with <HI>Campeche</HI> Wood and <HI>Sar∣saparilla,</HI> being chased against the Shore, was set on fire by her own Men, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> attempted twice in vain to put out.</P>

Before <HI>Havana</HI> he also chased several Ves∣sels, but lost sight of them in the Night. Mean while their Provisions growing short, the Seamen were desirous to return; which <HI>Boon eter</HI> would no way yield to, because the time began to approach in which the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships came from all places to <HI>Havana;</HI> but the Men mutinying forc'd him to Steer to the <HI>Texel,</HI> where they ar∣riv'd without doing any considerable Exploit advantageous to the <HI>West-India</HI> Company.</P>
<P>But at the same time fourteen Ships, three Sloops, and seven great Pinnaces, weighed Anchor from <HI>Reciffa</HI> with a thousand two hundred and sixty Men, divided into twelve Companies, under the Command of <HI>Hartman Godefrid</HI> and <HI>Stein Callen∣fels;</HI> who Landing on the Island <HI>Tamarica,</HI> march'd along a bad and narrow Path,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort of <HI>Tamarica</HI> as∣saulted by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in vain.</NOTE> partly craggy and partly sandy, to a Fort built on a high Ascent overgrown with Brambles in such a manner, that it was impossible for them to break through, whilest they in the Fort fir'd continually upon <HI>Stein Callenfels,</HI> who judg'd it conve∣nient to draw off, and Storm the Castle on another side.</P>
<P>The Admiral <HI>Pater</HI> newly come from the <HI>Texel</HI> to <HI>Olinda,</HI> sent three Ketches, a Sloop, and two Pinnaces, beyond the Town <HI>Tamarica,</HI> to prevent the Enemies cros∣sing over to the Main, and keep off their Fire-ships.

The Captains <HI>Le Grand</HI> and <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> found two other Ways that led to the Fort, but al∣together unfit to march along with their Men and Guns. <HI>Pater</HI> also Row'd round the Island with Sloops, and fathom'd the Water, whilest <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> Sailing up the River to <HI>Garasi,</HI> suppos'd that he had found a much better place to make an Onset on the Castle in, than had been found out yet; but the Council of <HI>Olinda</HI> and <HI>Stein Callenfels</HI> look'd upon it as too great a hazard to Storm a Fort, to which the Ways lay so much to the Enemy's advantage, a small number in the same being able to beat off a considerable Party; therefore it was judg'd best, and concluded upon, to build a Fort on a little Isle near <HI>Tamarica,</HI> at the Mouth of the River; to which purpose the Engineer <HI>Buuren</HI> contriv'd a square Castle with a long Horn-work, which was call'd <HI>Orange;</HI> in which the Captains <HI>Arcisseusky, Mellingen,</HI> and <HI>Beyer,</HI> were left in Garrison with their Companies, whilest the rest of the Regiment re∣turn'd to <HI>Reciffa.</HI></P>
<P>Mean while <HI>Antonio de Oquendo</HI> brought a great Fleet to <HI>St. Salvador;</HI> and <HI>Callenfels</HI> drew four Companies of Musquetteers, and a great company of Seamen with Pick∣axes and Spades out of the Fort <HI>Frederick Henrick</HI> into the Field, and marching South∣ward along private Ways, he found the River strongly fortifi'd near the Forts <HI>Affo∣gados,</HI> having above and below a row of strong Pallisado's; yet the <HI>Portuguese</HI> that guarded these Works after a small resistance fled, and left all: But because a gene∣ral Alarm drew many People in Arms out of <HI>Real,</HI> and several other places, <HI>Callenfels</HI> drew off in good order, and was inform'd by a Prisoner call'd <HI>Peter Alves,</HI> that the Fort <HI>Affogados</HI> receiv'd that Denomination from the River on which it was built;

Colonel <HI>Schuppe</HI> im∣mediately upon his arrival had a Command given him of five hundred Men, and <HI>John Lichthart</HI> of three Sail of Ships, a Pinnace and five Sloops; with which they set Sail to the River <HI>Formosa. Schuppe</HI> Landing his Men there, march'd up to the Fort <HI>Formosa,</HI> fortifi'd with Moats, steep high Walls, and four Guns, Storm'd and took the same, killing all those that were in the Garrison, except the Governor <HI>Peter Al∣buquerque:</HI> In which Victory nevertheless the <HI>Hollanders</HI> lost the valiant Captain <HI>Philbert du Basson,</HI> who being shot in at the Throat with a Bullet, which came out behind the Ear, dy'd of the same, the Wound immediately festering, to which all Wounds are very subject in <HI>Brasile.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> also burnt four laden Barques, a Store-house full of Sugar, and pull'd down the Fort they had taken.</P>
<P>Setting Sail again, they Landed to the Northward of the River <HI>Antonio Grande,</HI> where they gain'd a Platform with five Guns, destroy'd six Ships, and took two more in the Haven <HI>Camarigibi;</HI> from whence they return'd to <HI>Reciffa,</HI> after having spoil'd and taken thirteen of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships, several Sugar-Mills, Store-houses, and a Castle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swol</HI> Frigat came also in a shatter'd condition to <HI>Reciffa,</HI> having been En∣gag'd with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Gallion carrying twenty eight great Guns, and full of Men, which nevertheless she would have master'd, had not an unfortunate Shot spoil'd all her Rigging.</P>
<P>About the same time the Captains <HI>Byma, Everwyn,</HI> and <HI>Rinking,</HI> set; Sail with their Companies in three Ships to <HI>Porto Francisco,</HI> where Landing, they burnt three Sugar-Mills, besides several other brave Buildings, and brought away a rich Carvel, whilest <HI>Laurence van Rembach</HI> was made Colonel in <HI>Waerdenberg</HI>'s place, and <HI>Sigismond Schuppe</HI> Lieutenant-Colonel.</P>
<P>The Proffers which the <HI>Tapuyan</HI> Agent made to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had been very ad∣vantageous, had not the Summer Season been too far spent: for he had promis'd, That if they would Land a considerable Party of Men two Leagues Southward from the River <HI>Grande,</HI> all the <HI>Tapuyans</HI> should joyn with them, and assist them in driving the <HI>Portuguese</HI> out of <HI>Brasile.</HI></P>
<P>After this <HI>Schuppe</HI> and <HI>Lichthart</HI> went with thirteen Companies of Soldiers, and
<PB N="544" REF="364"/>two hundred Seamen, to fall upon the Enemy's Camp at the <HI>Afogados,</HI> where <HI>Albu∣querque</HI> had rais'd several Works, partly for the securing of <HI>Verga,</HI> the best Spot of Land in all <HI>Pernambuco,</HI> where there are likewise more Sugar-Mills than in the whole Countrey, and partly to keep an open Way between <HI>Arryal</HI> and the Promon∣tory <HI>St. Augustine:</HI> To which purpose they march'd by the Fort <HI>Aemilia</HI> along the plain Countrey, to the Stream <HI>Capivaribi,</HI> which they had cross'd before the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> knew any thing of their approach, who being but a hundred and thirty, for∣sook their Works and ran into the Woods; but assisted with four Companies of <HI>Italians,</HI> they Sally'd out of <HI>Real,</HI> and fell with great eagerness on the Seamen, who being guarded by forty Musquetteers were raising of Works in the Road which leads to <HI>Real,</HI> and put them to flight; but being rally'd, and seconded by Colonel <HI>Redburgh,</HI> they drove the Enemy into a By-way, guarded by <HI>Byma</HI> and <HI>Bongarson;</HI> where being stopt, and Captain <HI>Cloppenburgh</HI> from another side falling in amongst them with his Musquetteers, they became encompass'd, and had been all slain, had not <HI>Le Grande,</HI> by making way for <HI>Cloppenburgh,</HI> given them an opportunity of get∣ting away between them.</P>
<P>The Council at <HI>Reciffa,</HI> to secure the footing which they had got on the other side of the River <HI>Capavaribi,</HI> took order about the building of a Fort, which requir'd the greater Labor, because the Earth was very stonie: not far from whence Cap∣tain <HI>John Smith</HI> walking, was shot by a Party of <HI>Portuguese</HI> lying behind some Chests of Sugar; the Blow whereof giving notice to his Ensign, he speedily march'd thi∣ther, and surprising the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> kill'd most part of them. The like success had <HI>Le Grande, Cloppenburgh,</HI> and <HI>Bongarson,</HI> who marching out upon a Design, surpris'd unawares in <HI>John de Mendoza</HI>'s Sugar-Mill, two Companies of <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who ha∣ving watch'd there the whole Night, and composing themselves in the Morning to sleep, were set upon, and most of them kill'd, and the old Commander <HI>Antonio Or∣tizo de Mendoza</HI> taken, who not long before came thither with a Regiment of <HI>Por∣tugueses;</HI> the Sugar-Mill was also set on fire.</P>
<P>These successful Expeditions still adding to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> fresh Courage, they follow'd the career of their Successes, and placing three Companies in the Works of the <HI>Afogados,</HI> drew their Army into three Divisions; Colonel <HI>Rembach</HI> was to Com∣mand the Forlorn; <HI>Schuppe,</HI> the main Body; and <HI>Byma,</HI> the Reserve; in which Or∣der they waded through the River <HI>Capivaribi,</HI> placing some Musquetteers in a House built near the High-way, to secure their Return that way, and came without any resistance to the <HI>Arryal;</HI> where they found a long Street, with Shops on each side full of all sorts of Goods, which they pillag'd, notwithstanding the Enemy fir'd furiously from the Castle upon them, and wounded Colonel <HI>Rembach</HI> and Captain <HI>Redburgh.</HI> To the Northward before the Castle lay a Redoubt with two Guns, which <HI>Schuppe</HI> mastering, kill'd all that were in the same; but being too weak to carry away the Guns, he nail'd up the Touch-holes, and march'd off with his Men, but in such disorder, that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Sallying out of their Garrison, fell in amongst them in that manner, that they were not able to bring away their woun∣ded Men, amongst whom was Captain <HI>Redburgh;</HI> and it had been worse, had not <HI>Remback</HI> (who though he was shot in at the Shoulder, under the Blade-bone whereof lay the Bullet) kept them off till such time as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were got over the River <HI>Capivaribi,</HI> near the fore-mention'd House, guarded by a Company of Musquetteers, who kill'd above fifty of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> besides fifty that had been slain in the for∣mer Skirmishes; the <HI>Hollanders</HI> themselves also had lost a hundred and thirty Men: yet notwithstanding they ceased not, but march'd in Parties through all parts of <HI>Verga,</HI> where they met with no opposition, but found the Sugar-Mills full of Sugar,
<PB N="545" REF="364"/>left to be kept by a few <HI>Negro's. Rembach</HI> also sent a Drummer to <HI>Real,</HI> to demand the Wounded, especially Colonel <HI>Redburgh,</HI> with a Letter from the Prisoner <HI>Anto∣nio Mendoza,</HI> requesting the Governor <HI>Albuquerque</HI> and Duke of <HI>Bagnola,</HI> that they would be pleas'd to release the <HI>Hollanders</HI> on Exchange, or else upon Ransom. The Drummer being civilly Entertain'd by <HI>Albuquerque,</HI> brought back with him a strange Oyl call'd <HI>Aury,</HI> for the wounded <HI>Mendoza;</HI> with which a Wound made by a Bullet being anointed about three Fingers breadth, it draws out the same. <HI>Bagnola</HI> afterwards sent it to <HI>Rembach,</HI> in requital for his kindness in sending <HI>Mendoza</HI> in a Hammock to <HI>Real.</HI> Mean while the <HI>Hollanders</HI> still fortifi'd their Works at the <HI>Afo∣gados</HI> with Pallisado's and Platforms, on which they put five Guns. They likewise work'd daily on the fore-mention'd Castle, whilest <HI>Schuppe</HI> march'd with four hun∣dred Men in the Night over the River <HI>Jangada</HI> to <HI>Moribeca;</HI> which approaching, he perceiv'd the Way stopt up with fell'd Trees; wherefore he march'd about to the Village, which he found forsaken by the Inhabitants, and all the Houses left empty, onely five hundred Chests of Sugar that had been brought thither from <HI>Verga,</HI> which <HI>Schuppe</HI> Commanded to be set on fire with the Village, leaving onely the Church, and at his Return burnt also a Sugar-Mill.</P>

<P><HI>Schuppe</HI> being chosen Chief over the <HI>Militia</HI> in <HI>Rembach</HI>'s Place (who dy'd of his Wound,) lay not long still, but setting Sail with eleven Ships to the Isle <HI>Tamarica,</HI> Landed seven Companies before the Castle <HI>Nostra Sennora de Conception;</HI> which, though well provided and fortifi'd, the Governor <HI>Pignioro</HI> surrendred, on Condition that he might depart with all his Men and the Church Ornaments.</P>
<P><HI>Matthias van Ceulen</HI> and <HI>Schuppe</HI> Rowing up the Stream <HI>Goiana</HI> with Sloops and Boats, put to flight <HI>Laurence Cavalcanti,</HI> burnt divers Sugar-Mills, and took abun∣dance of rich Merchandize: Ten days they made havock in the middle of their Enemies Countreys without any resistance; for all of them fled to the <HI>Aldas,</HI> (so they call the <HI>Brasilian</HI> Villages): At last they return'd home with great Booty, especially of Sugar and <HI>Brasile</HI> Wood; whilest those at <HI>Reciffa</HI> were not idle, doing the <HI>Portuguese</HI> great mischief by their continual Sallies, <HI>Tourlong</HI> burning a Fishers Village, and <HI>Bongarson</HI> a stately Banquetting-house belonging to <HI>Cavalcant</HI> near <HI>Arryal;</HI> as also <HI>Pedro Acunha de Andada</HI>'s Sugar-Mill, from whence he took great Booty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> begin to fall off to the <HI>Hollan∣ders.</HI></NOTE>About the same time the <HI>Portuguese</HI> of several Parts, terrifi'd by continual Alarms and Losses, began to incline to the <HI>West-India</HI> Company, believing that they should utterly be ruin'd, if they continu'd to joyn with <HI>Albuquerque</HI>'s Party (who claim'd <HI>Pernambuco</HI> wholly to himself) and therefore car'd not whether he or the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were Masters, so they might live peaceably.

<P>That Summer having been so dry, that no man ever remembred the like, had dry'd up all the Morasses, so that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> marching over them and high Moun∣tains, got a back Way into the Countrey.

<P><HI>Arcisseusky</HI> fortifi'd himself along the crooked River <HI>Paripuera,</HI> full of Crocodiles, which hurt none, unless provok'd. This River runs five Leagues to the North∣ward of <HI>Punta de Jaragoa,</HI> where the <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces Landed.</P>

About Day-break both Armies stood an hour looking upon one another; the place where they stood being surrounded with Woods and deep Valleys. <HI>Borgia</HI> drew out his Men on a Hill, overgrown with Bushes. <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> had drawn out his Men on somewhat a lower Ground. <HI>Borgia</HI> at last sent some of his Musquetteers down the Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Borgia</HI>'s Ar∣my defeated by <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> and himselt slain.</NOTE> who fir'd with a full Volley upon the <HI>Dutch,</HI> whilest <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> onely discharg'd a Field-piece at a Tree, under which <HI>Borgia</HI> stood to take a view of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Forces; upon the firing of which Gun <HI>Borgia</HI> began to come down the Hill with all his Army, against whom <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> drew out his first and second Division, whilest Captain <HI>Vanden Brande</HI> led his Companies within two Pikes length from the Enemy, before he dis∣charg'd, which was no sooner done, but contrary to Order they broke into the left Wing of <HI>Borgia</HI>'s Army, and put his Musquetteers to flight, who were soon fol∣low'd by the whole <HI>Spanish</HI> Army, some running into the Woods, others into the Morasses, but most of them along the narrow Way which leads to <HI>Porto Calvo.</HI> Among the Slain was Borgia himself, who was Descended from the greatest Families of the Dukes of <HI>Lerma</HI> and <HI>Borgia;</HI> he was about forty eight years of Age, and had serv'd the <HI>Spanish</HI> King a considerable time in the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> This Victory cost the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> about forty Men, besides as many more wounded. Amongst the <HI>Spanish</HI> Pri∣soners was a <HI>Neopolitan</HI> Gentleman, call'd <HI>Hector de la Calce,</HI> who upon Examination inform'd the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> That with the last <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet there Landed two thousand four hundred Men in <HI>Alagoa,</HI> with twenty Brass Field-pieces, abundance of Wheel∣barrows, Spades and Pick-axes, which cost in <HI>Portugal</HI> eight hundred thousand <HI>Cru∣sado's;</HI> with which great warlike Preparations <HI>Borgia</HI> made no doubt to have got fast footing in the Countrey, and to have cut off all manner of Assistance from the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> That the <HI>Spanish</HI> King rais'd a great many Men both in <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> that with the first opportunity he might fit out a Fleet, which was to be conducted by four thousand two hundred Seamen, to whom the <HI>Castilians</HI> were to add eight thousand five hundred Soldiers and two hundred Seamen, and the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> the like number, to serve ashore, and to drive all Strangers out of <HI>Brasile;</HI> That this Design had long since been put in Execution, had not the <HI>Albuquerquers</HI> continually deceiv'd the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> under pretence that <HI>Brasile</HI> was in no danger; That <HI>Albuquerque</HI> would be forc'd to resign up the Interest which he had in <HI>Brasile,</HI> for which the King would give him a Dukedom in <HI>Portugal</HI> in exchange.</P>
<P><HI>Schuppe</HI> and <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> judging it no way convenient to fall upon the Enemy in <HI>Porto Calvo,</HI> Garrison'd <HI>Paripuera</HI> with four hundred Men, under the Command of the Captains <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Philip Andrews,</HI> whom they furnish'd with Provisions for five Moneths, and left Order to defend the Countrey against the Incursions of the Ene∣my; which done, they went aboard with eleven hundred Men, and took in two Companies of <HI>Brasilians</HI> at <HI>Barra Grande;</HI> with whom Landing behind the Isle <HI>Alexio,</HI> they came to <HI>Serinhain</HI> before Day-light, and found all the Inhabitants fled into the Woods, fearing they would take Revenge on them for murdering of their Sick which they had left there. They were no sooner Encamp'd here, but they receiv'd. Information from <HI>John Talibon,</HI> that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army intended to Besiege the Re∣doubt in <HI>Barra Grande,</HI> which therefore, as lying on an ill place, and not able to re∣sist long, they slighted: After which being furnish'd with Provisions out of some Ketches Commanded by the Admiral <HI>Lichthart,</HI> they return'd, with Intentions to take up their Quarters in <HI>Serinhain</HI> during the Winter Season, whilest the Enemy lay in <HI>Cockau,</HI> on one side of <HI>Una</HI> and <HI>Serinhain,</HI> and kept private Correspondence with some of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> that had taken the.

<P>Soon after twenty eight Ships arriving at <HI>Reciffa,</HI> brought fresh Supplies of Men thither from the <HI>Maes</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> with Ammunition and Provisions, which was much wanted; also two Councellors, <HI>Henrich Schild</HI> and <HI>Paulus Serooskerken.</HI></P>
<P>This Fleet was scarce got in, when in the Evening news was brought, that eight hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> were broke in through <HI>Poyuca,</HI> and had taken <HI>John Paez Baretto</HI>'s Sugar-Mill, and destroy'd all they came at; but that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> defend∣ing the Church with great Valor, obtain'd Quarter upon the surrendring of it.</P>
<P>This raging Army, led by Colonel <HI>Rebellino</HI> and <HI>Madurera,</HI> march'd to <HI>Laurenzo</HI> and <HI>Massiapi,</HI> whither there resorted daily more Men to them, which put the Coun∣cil at <HI>Reciffa</HI> to a great Dilemma, foreseeing, that if they should send for <HI>Schuppe</HI> from <HI>Serinhain,</HI> the Enemy from <HI>Una</HI> and <HI>Porto Calvo</HI> would hem him in, neither had they sufficient Forces to withstand <HI>Rebellino;</HI> therefore it was judg'd convenient to send to <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> to joyn with <HI>Schuppe</HI>'s Army, that they might both unawares fall upon the Enemy. In the interim a hundred and twenty <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> sent by <HI>Janduy,</HI> came to <HI>Reciffa,</HI> with information that <HI>Janduy</HI> was coming himself, with seve∣ral other neighboring Kings, to their Assistance. <HI>Schuppe,</HI> according to the Councels Order, march'd in the Night through the Sugar-Mills of <HI>Rio Formoso,</HI> rested the next day in the Valley <HI>Orekinda,</HI> and guarded all the Avenues: Whilest he went about to Storm the Village <HI>Una, Mansveld</HI> was to Engage with a hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> on one side of <HI>Iletta</HI>'s Sugar-Mills, and <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> was to fall upon the Village; whither marching early in the Morning, they saw onely a few of the Inhabitants, the Enemy being gone with his Forces over to <HI>Manbucava,</HI> nor could they pass any farther, finding the River too deep to wade through: But it, had like to have gone worse with <HI>Stackhower</HI> and <HI>Litchthart,</HI> who with <HI>Maulpas</HI> making twelve hundred Men, were surpris'd by <HI>Rebellino,</HI> rushing forth of an Ambuscade near <HI>Laurenzo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> under <HI>Rebellino</HI> routed by <HI>Stackhower</HI> and <HI>Lichthart</HI></NOTE> where <HI>Maulpas</HI> receiving a Wound dy'd of the same. This rough En∣tertainment at first much daunted the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> but regaining their Courage, they press'd upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army in such a manner, that <HI>Rebellino</HI> being wounded in his Shoulder, fled in great disorder through the Sugar-Fields to <HI>Porto Calvo,</HI> and of fifteen hundred Men sav'd not above four hundred, the rest being either kill'd, or scatter'd up and down the Countrey; twelve taken <HI>Hollanders</HI> were also released by this means.

<P>The fruitfulness of this Tract of Land was not inferior to any Countrey in the whole World, Cattel grazing up and down in Herds of five, six, and seven thou∣sand.

The <HI>Brasilians</HI> obtain'd liberty also to inhabit their Villages and till their Land, that they might make Provision for themselves, and not oppress the Planters that liv'd near them.

<PB N="567" REF="380"/>and the Rocky <HI>Organes,</HI> Steer'd thither, resolving to venture once more; but when he came there, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were gone; whereupon he sent some of his Ships to <HI>Brasile,</HI> others to Cruise before <HI>Cuba,</HI> whilest he himself went for the <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>Whilest this Expedition fell out so unfortunately, <HI>Cameron,</HI> General of the <HI>Brasi∣lians,</HI> sent three Agents to <HI>Grave Maurice,</HI> desiring to enter into League with the <HI>West-India</HI> Company, upon some Differences that were risen between him and the Duke of <HI>Bagnola. Grave Maurice</HI> seeming much inclin'd to his Offer, treated the Agents very nobly; who not long after, oblig'd by his Civility, inform'd him, that <HI>Came∣ron,</HI> an inconstant Man, had made Peace again with <HI>Bagnola.</HI> But that which chiefly obstructed <HI>Grave Maurice</HI>'s Designs, was the want of Provisions, Ammunition and Men, notwithstanding his continual Complaints to the Company.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the Year 1639. the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet, consisting of twenty eight Sail, most of them Gallions, appear'd in sight of <HI>Reciffa,</HI> but Steer'd South∣wardly; <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> hereupon sent out the best Sailers to follow them, and see whither they were bound, or if they intended to Land, whilest himself march'd along to <HI>Porto Calvo;</HI> but inform'd that they were gone into the Inlet <HI>Todos los San∣ctos,</HI> he return'd to <HI>Reciffa,</HI> after he had stor'd the Forts <HI>Porto Calvo, Una, Serinhain,</HI> and that at the Promontory <HI>St. Augustine,</HI> with all Necessaries.</P>
<P>About the same time <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> arriving from <HI>Holland</HI> with a Commission to be General over the Forces there,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arcisseueky</HI> Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aches <HI>Grave Mau∣rice</HI> and his Council.</NOTE> imparted to some Friends the Copy of a Letter that he intended to send to the <HI>Amsterdam</HI> Burgomaster <HI>Albert Coenraedszoon vander Burgh,</HI> containing many Accusations against <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> and his Council; of which he being inform'd, call'd a general Assembly, to whom he makes a large Speech, wherein he declar'd how faithful a Servant he had been to the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Netherlands</HI> for the space of twenty years, complain'd of the malice of <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> in wrongfully aspersing him, both in the aforesaid Letter and otherwise, answer'd particularly to every thing which was laid to his Charge, (as he did afterwards in a Letter also from himself to <HI>Vander Burgh</HI>) and lastly made it his peremptory Request, that he might return home, and leave <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> in Power, or that <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> might be sent home, and he remain undisturb'd in his Government; and so withdrew, leaving them to their own Consultations. It exceedingly perplex'd them, and took up a long Debate what Judgment to give in this Matter, which before they concluded on, they propos'd several Expedients of Reconciliation between them; but seeing it was all in vain, they unanimously judg'd it convenient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is sent back into <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Arcisseusky</HI> should return; who not long after accordingly weigh'd Anchor from <HI>Parayba</HI> for <HI>Holland.</HI></P>

<P>It being fear'd that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet in the Harbor of <HI>Todos los Sanctos</HI> might

<P>A <HI>Negro</HI> that serv'd a <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain, call'd <HI>Henrick Dias,</HI> being taken, inform'd the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> That the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet was much weakned by a poysonous Air on the Coast of <HI>Africa;</HI> and that they had left a considerable number of their Men in the Hospital at <HI>St. Salvador;</HI> that the Admiral was resolv'd with divided Forces to burn all Places he came at, and to receive the <HI>Negro's, Mamolucks, Mulatto's,</HI> and <HI>Bra∣silians,</HI> under his Jurisdiction.

The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Loss was the less, because the <HI>Spanish</HI> great Gallions fir'd over <HI>Huigens</HI>'s Ships, which fir'd in the midst of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Vessels. <HI>Huigens</HI> not being tir'd with two days Engagements, fell upon them a third time before <HI>Parayba,</HI> and firing at the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> Admirals, pursu'd their Fleet to the Northermost Coast of <HI>Brasile,</HI> where by a strong Current they were driven Westerly; and the <HI>Swan,</HI> Commanded by <HI>Jacob Alderick,</HI> losing her Main-mast, was cut off from the Fleet by twelve Gallions; and three hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> were already Masters of the Deck, when <HI>Alderick</HI> breaking from the Enemy, drove towards the Shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alderick</HI>'s va∣liant Exploit</NOTE> and either kill'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were in his Ship, or forc'd them to leap overboard, whilest <HI>Anto∣nio Cunha de Andrada,</HI> not knowing that <HI>Alderick</HI> was aground, making up to him, ran also aground, which occasion'd a new Fight, and at last <HI>Andrada</HI> was made to surrender his Gallion, and with it three thousand Pound of coin'd and uncoin'd Silver, besides other rich Goods, and two hundred and thirty Men, who were all sent Prisoners to <HI>Pecissa.</HI></P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the seventeenth <HI>Huigens</HI> ventur'd a fourth Engagement between <HI>Rio Grande</HI> and <HI>Conyaou,</HI> where approaching the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet, a sudden Calm prevented him from coming within shot of them, till against the Evening the Wind began to rise, but the Night approaching, it was not judg'd worth while to Engage for so few hours, therefore they referr'd the bloody work till the next day; when about Day∣break <HI>Huigens</HI> ran through the midst of the Enemy's Fleet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet again put to flight by <HI>Huigens.</HI></NOTE> and fir'd so fiercely on <HI>Mascarenhas,</HI> that he Tacking about, stood away right before the Wind, and not be∣ing able to get beyond the Shelves <HI>Baxios de Roachas,</HI> nor to get Water on the Coast, because the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Ketches guarded the same, he Sail'd into the Offin towards the <HI>Line</HI> with a South-East Wind.

<P>Several Disadvantages occurr'd towards the overthrow of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet; for first it was much weakned by the Disease which rag'd in the same on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> insomuch that it lay still a whole year in <HI>Todos los Sanctos</HI> to gather fresh For∣ces, whilest <HI>Maurice</HI> put himself in a posture of Defence: Secondly, they lay be∣calm'd, and met with contrary Winds for several Moneths, when as the Voyage be∣tween <HI>St. Salvador</HI> and <HI>Pemambuco</HI> is commonly not above twelve days; which tedi∣ous Passage occasion'd also a Distemper and faint-heartedness amongst the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whilest divers Ships arriv'd at <HI>Reciffa</HI> from the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> without which it had been impossible to have Engag'd with the Enemy, in regard till then all manner of Ammunition and Provisions were wanting. <HI>Huigens</HI> also had continually the advantage or benefit of the Wind, and lost in the Engagement but two Ships, a hundred and twenty four Men, besides twelve wounded: Moreover, but twelve
<PB N="570" REF="382"/>Ships onely of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Engag'd with this great <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet, the rest never coming within shot; wherefore the two Commanders, <HI>John Coopman Ryk,</HI> and <HI>Peter Jacob,</HI> were condemn'd to be Beheaded; <HI>Cornelis Johnszoon</HI> and <HI>Peter Dirkszoon</HI> had their Swords broke over their Heads by the common Hangman; <HI>Cornelis Lucifer, Dirk Eger,</HI> and <HI>Jacob Clavor,</HI> were banish'd; and others came off by paying great Fines: but the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet lost in the four Engagements twenty Ships, and some thousands of Men, the <HI>Joseph</HI> alone having four hundred slain in her. Lastly, anchoring near the Island <HI>Margareta,</HI> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Admiral <HI>Cosmo de Couto,</HI> and the Captain-General <HI>Francisco Pimentello,</HI> falling out, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Steer'd to <HI>Tercera,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Cales,</HI> where there Landed but few Men, most of them dying of Hunger and Thirst in their Return home: Four Gallions, with two Pinks, got into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Harbors, the rest being either stranded before <HI>New Spain,</HI> sunk, or return'd to the Inlet <HI>Todos los Sanctos.</HI></P>
<P>Before the foremention'd Fleet weigh'd Anchor from <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> two thousand <HI>Portugueses,</HI> besides <HI>Tapuyans</HI> and other <HI>Brasilians,</HI> march'd under the Command of <HI>Cameron, Vidal,</HI> and <HI>Barbalio,</HI> with divided Forces into the Countrey, partly to get Provision, and partly to do what mischief they could to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> far and near: their Orders were to joyn in the Village <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> seven Leagues be∣yond <HI>Paomarello,</HI> that there they might make way for the Seamen to Land, if the <HI>Netherland</HI> Forces should chance to guard the Sea-Coast thereabouts, and to joyn with them as soon as they were Landed. But <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> encourag'd by his late Victory at Sea, immediately sent the Field-Marshal <HI>Coin</HI> against <HI>Cameron,</HI> who diviidng his Army into small Companies, had distributed them through the Woods;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cameron</HI>'s Forces and <HI>Barbalio</HI>'s put to flight by <HI>Coin.</HI></NOTE> in which <HI>Coin</HI> follow'd his Example, and with divided Forces pursu'd <HI>Cameron</HI>'s Army, and overtook his Captain <HI>Tak</HI> and two hundred Men at <HI>Poyuca;</HI> (whereof <HI>Lopes Barbalio</HI> was Governor) who fled, notwithstanding he Commanded six hundred Men.) Soon after which the Muster-master <HI>Mansveld</HI> met him near the Village <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> Engag'd him, and putting him to flight, found several Papers of Concern that he had left behind,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Portugueses</HI> Plot against the <HI>Nether∣landers</HI> disco∣ver'd.</NOTE> and amongst others a Letter, in which <HI>Barbalio</HI> was commanded to spare neither <HI>Brasilians</HI> nor <HI>Netherlanders</HI> alive, but to kill all, without regard either to their Age or Quality, except the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> Moreover, <HI>Andries Vidal</HI> urg'd the Owners of the Sugar-Mills in the <HI>Netherlanders Brasile,</HI> im∣mediately to take up Arms, to regain their ancient Freedom, as soon as <HI>Mascarenhas</HI> appear'd with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet on the Coast of <HI>Brasile:</HI> Thus <HI>Vidal,</HI> by Letters and private Conferences, prevail'd so much, that most of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> were ready against their Oaths to root out the <HI>Netherlanders:</HI> The sign when they should be ready, was the burning of some Sugar-Mills, <HI>Vidal</HI> imagining thereby to have drawn the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> from the Sea-side, and so made the Sea-Coast free for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to Land securely in. But the Garrison under <HI>Coin</HI> along the Sea-shore near <HI>Alexis,</HI> not ignorant of the Enemy's Plot, kept their Stations, and suf∣fer'd the Mills to burn.

<P>Two Moneths before the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet set Sail from <HI>Todos los Sanctos,</HI> three thou∣sand <HI>Tapuyans</HI> came to <HI>Rio Grande</HI> with their Wives and Children, from an unknown Countrey remote from the Sea. <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> requested their King <HI>John de Wy,</HI> that he would please to keep Watch along the Sea-Coast, and prevent the Landing of
<PB N="571" REF="382"/>the <HI>Spanish</HI> Seamen: Whereupon <HI>De Wy</HI> sent his Son to the Castle <HI>Ceulen,</HI> making solemn Protestations, that he was ready to lose his Life and Fortune for the <HI>Nether∣landers,</HI> in helping them to drive the <HI>Portuguese</HI> out of <HI>Brasile.

<P>About the beginning of the Year 1640. <HI>Houte-been</HI> and <HI>Lichthart</HI> brought a considerable Fleet from the <HI>Netherlands</HI> to an Anchor at <HI>Reciffa,</HI> where a Consu∣tation was held, whither these Ships might be sent to do most Service: every one had an Eye on St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> not long since Storm'd in vain; but <HI>Maurice</HI> judg'd that they had not Forces enough to undertake so grand a Design, but thought it would be better to Land some fresh Forces near St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> that there they might burn the Sugar-Mills, and destroy all things they could find, in revenge of what the Enemy had done at <HI>Parayba.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Tourlon</HI> and <HI>Lichthart</HI> set Sail with twenty Ships, Mann'd with two thousand five hundred Men, to the Inlet <HI>Todos los Sanctos,</HI> where they burnt all the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Sugar-Mills, Houses and Villages; nei∣ther did their Swords spare any alive but Women and Infants: The Cattel which they found they carry'd aboard of their Ships, and burnt all other Provisions.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Houte-been</HI> and <HI>Coin</HI> fell upon <HI>Porto Franco,</HI> where they ruin'd all things, to no other end, but that the Enemy might call home his Forces out of the <HI>Netherlanders Brasile,</HI> to defend the Province <HI>Todos los Sanctos.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt. <HI>Brand</HI> taken Priso∣ner.</NOTE> But Captain <HI>Brand</HI> going up too far into the Countrey with his Army, was suddenly set upon, had a hundred of his Men slain on the Spot, and was himself taken Prisoner, together with many more. Also the Storming of the Town <HI>Spirito Sancto</HI> by <HI>Coin</HI> prov'd un∣successful,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coin</HI> unsuc∣cessfully Storms <HI>Spi∣rito Sancto.</HI></NOTE> because he led an undisciplin'd Company, and wanted little Vessels to Land in on a sudden; for the Enemy having had timely notice, immediately rais'd a Sconce about the Town, and with five Brass Guns fir'd stoutly on him, who en∣deavor'd to climb up the Hill, but was forc'd to sound a Retreat, his Men failing in their Courage; yet at last breaking into the Town, he set some of the Houses on fire, which being built of Stone, resisted the Flame; so burning onely four hun∣dred and fifty Chests of Sugar, he left sixty Men kill'd, and brought back eighty wounded. <HI>Lichthart</HI> in the mean time made great havock about St. <HI>Salvador.</HI></P>
<P>In this Conjuncture the <HI>West-India</HI> Company suffer'd much by Robberies and Spoils committed up and down the Countrey, by the setting their Woods of <HI>Bra∣sile</HI> on fire by a company of <HI>Negro's,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Woods of <HI>Brasile</HI> set on fire by <HI>Peter Vist.</HI></NOTE> the chief Ring-leader of whom was one call'd <HI>Peter Vist,</HI> who from Caves and almost inaccessible Ways came forth in the Night, and set fire on whatsoever places he came to, notwithstanding a hundred <HI>Negro's</HI> of his crew were soon after caught, which he at several times had by force taken out of their Masters Sugars-Mills; which <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> prevented as much as pos∣sible, by keeping Soldiers up and down in Arms. He also us'd the <HI>Portuguese</HI> very civilly, who though they promis'd Obedience, because they liv'd under the Ju∣risdiction of the <HI>West-India</HI> Company, yet were ready on all occasions to shew the contrary; wherefore <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> sending for the chief of them to <HI>Reciffa</HI> from <HI>Pernambuco, Itamaraca,</HI> and <HI>Parayba,</HI> told them before the Privy Council, that they might easily see how vainly they expected that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Crown should take <HI>Brasile</HI> from the <HI>Netherlanders;</HI> that formerly they depended on the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet Commanded by <HI>Mascarenhas,</HI> but that being destroy'd by a small Force, that hope Was lost; therefore if henceforward they would Trade on their own Accounts, they might be assur'd they should not suffer in the least, either in their Goods, Religion, or Persons.</P>

<P>To this Request of the <HI>States</HI> was added that of the <HI>West-India</HI> Company, who also sent earnest Letters to the same purpose; which made <HI>Maurice</HI> defer his Re∣turn, and prepare himself for some grand Undertaking: And first he joyn'd the Province of <HI>Seregippe Del Rey</HI> to the <HI>Netherland Brasile,</HI> built a Fort and Armory in the same, and built a Wall about the Town; which Work was the more follow'd, because <HI>Seregippe,</HI> which border'd upon the Province of <HI>Todos los Sanctos,</HI> fed abun∣dance of Cattel, and gave great hopes of Silver-Mines.</P>
<P><HI>Grave Maurice</HI> likewise observing what great Profit proceeded from the <HI>Angolan Negro's,</HI> and that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Sugar-Mills could not work without them, undertook to ingross that Trade wholly into the <HI>West-India</HI> Companies hands; to which pur∣pose <HI>Loando St. Paulo</HI> being judg'd a fit Place for a Factory, <HI>Houte-been</HI> was sent thi∣ther wich twenty Ships, Mann'd with nine hundred Seamen, two thousand Land-Soldiers, and two hundred <HI>Brasilians:</HI> the Land-Men were Commanded by <HI>Hinder∣son,</HI> who arriving with the Fleet on the twenty fourth of <HI>August</HI> 1640. before <HI>Loando St. Paulo,</HI> ran in between the Enemy's Castles, St. <HI>Crux, Bento, Sibylla, Vincent, Velho,</HI> and against five Batteries along the Water side, all full of Guns, and fir'd so vehe∣mently upon the Enemy, that being forc'd to leave his Works, he made room

<P>Soon after this the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Fleet falling out amongst themselves, <HI>Bonavides</HI> Steer'd back for <HI>Lisbon</HI> with a few Ships, the rest coming to an Anchor again near <HI>Reciffa;</HI> where the Seamen whom <HI>Lichthart</HI> had taken inform'd him, that their Fleet came the first time to <HI>Reciffa</HI> for no other end, but to stir up the <HI>Portuguese</HI> by

<P>By this time at <HI>Reciffa</HI> all things were in a confusion, the Pits digg'd about <HI>Maurice-stadt</HI> afforded nothing but brackish Water, which occasion'd Sickness.</P>

Fewel also grew very scarce, which made many eat their Meat raw, or half dress'd. In the interim every one that was able, was forc'd to work at the Forts of <HI>Reciffa,</HI> which were beaten down by the Rains; and the Soldiers continually alarm'd by the Enemy, were forc'd to be Night and Day up in Arms.

A Pink, which came in two Moneths from <HI>Reciffa,</HI> brought also sad tydings to the Fleet, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Town was in such a Condition, that without doubt the Fleet would come too late to their assistance: whereupon they making the more haste, endea∣vor'd, not without great trouble, to weigh Anchor again, whilest the Wind rose higher and higher, and the Waves going very hollow, drove the Ships down towards <HI>Portland</HI> Coast, full of Rocks, to which they were so near, that they saw a <HI>Scotch∣man</HI> split in pieces against them; and had not the Wind come about, and abated of its fury, the Fleet had undoubtedly perish'd. No sooner was this Danger past, but another succeeded; for the Soldiers in the Admirals Ship complaining of the small allowance they had of Cheese, Brandy, and Tobacco, had made themselves Masters of the Store-room, and threatned to kill the Lords <HI>Goch</HI> and <HI>Beaumond;</HI> but they, assisted with Men from the other Ships, who came in at the Cabbin Windows, so order'd the Mutineers, that they ask'd forgiveness, which for many Reasons was granted, onely they were distributed by seven in a Ship throughout the whole Fleet. After a great Contest between <HI>Goch</HI> and <HI>Beaumond</HI> about carrying the Flag, which could not be decided, <HI>Goch</HI> was left by the rest of the Fleet, who Steer'd an∣other Course, and getting near the <HI>Line,</HI> lay becalm'd six days; in which time he lost very many of his Men by a strange kind of <HI>Scorbute</HI> which rag'd amongst them; at last Sailing along the Promontory of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> he came to an Anchor before <HI>Reciffa,</HI> which he found in the greatest Exigency imaginable, insomuch that it was resolv'd upon, the next day to surrender the Place up to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> on promise of Quarter onely: which Resolution none oppos'd more than the <HI>Jews;</HI> for the <HI>Portuguese</HI> swore that they would burn them alive, if ever they became Masters of <HI>Reciffa,</HI> which made them resolve to die with the Sword in their Hands, and sell their Lives at a dear rate.

<PB N="586" REF="391"/>at <HI>Reciffa.</HI> As soon as he had taken the Fort, he caus'd it to be pull'd down to the Ground, because it stood in an inconvenient place, and immediately rais'd another, which was much better to be defended, by reason of the rising Ground; but he could neither bring that Work, nor any other Design to any perfection, be∣cause of the treachery of his Soldiers, who being most of them <HI>Roman-Catholicks,</HI> were so inclin'd to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Interest, that they daily more and more deserted the Companies Service, and gave Intelligence to the Enemy of their Transactions. Amongst others, an <HI>Antwerper</HI> was apprehended for an Intelligencer, and being Hang'd on a Gibbet, fell three times one after another on his Feet, the Halter break∣ing like a burnt Thred, which gave him so many times of respit and opportunity of supplicating for Life; but his Crime was too hainous to admit of Pardon.

<P>This Defeat spoil'd <HI>Schuppe</HI>'s Design, who by his marching to <HI>Rio Francisco</HI> thought to draw the Enemy from <HI>Reciffa;</HI> but now being forc'd to think of some other way, he thought it convenient to invade St. <HI>Salvador</HI> by Sea, as the Enemy had done <HI>Reciffa</HI> by Land.

Amongst the Prisoners that were taken and sent to <HI>Reciffa,</HI> were two Monks, who were design'd the same Entertainment as the Minister <HI>Astette</HI> should receive in St. <HI>Salvador;</HI> whereupon they immediately wrote to their Fraternity, to take care that <HI>Astette</HI> should not be burnt alive, as the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had threatned, because they were to expect the same usage: whereupon <HI>Astette</HI> was set at liberty, and had leave to walk up and down the Streets of St. <HI>Sal∣vador.

<P><HI>Reciffa</HI> being at that time reduc'd to very great straits, earnestly implor'd Aid from the <HI>States,</HI> but to little purpose, by reason of the Differences amongst them∣selves, which hapned upon this occasion: The <HI>Spanish</HI> King by his Agent in the <HI>Hague</HI> made Overtures of Peace, and proffer'd to fall upon the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in <HI>Brasile:</HI> to which Proposition, when as the rest of the <HI>States</HI> seem'd inclinable, those of <HI>Zea∣land</HI> would no ways hearken, being resolv'd to have nothing to do with <HI>Spain.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Council of <HI>Reciffa</HI> sent over Messengers to represent the sad condi∣tion of the Place.</NOTE> The news of this Dissention exceedingly perplex'd the Council at <HI>Reciffa,</HI> especially when to that news was added, that <HI>Bankert,</HI> the onely terror to the Enemy at Sea, was Commanded home by the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Zealand,</HI> which yet the <HI>General States</HI> strictly forbad. Whereupon they thought fit to send one of their Assembly to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to make the <HI>States</HI> acquainted with the miserable Condition of <HI>Brasile,</HI> and to Expo∣stulate with them for their insensibility of their Condition, and to let them under∣stand, that ten thousand Men would not restore <HI>Brasile</HI> to its former Condition: Every one strove to be the Messenger of these sad tydings, but especially their Pre∣sident <HI>Schonenbergh</HI> wish'd it might be his lot to leave the unhappy Countrey of <HI>Brasile;</HI> but because his departure would not have been without great murmuring of the People, <HI>Haeks</HI> was sent in his stead.

<PB N="590" REF="393"/>Chest, bury'd it under the Ballast. Mean while the Fleet approaching the <HI>Flemmish</HI> Isles, was surpris'd by a terrible Storm, in which the Vice-Admiral's old Ship split asunder, but most of the People were sav'd.

<P>In the interim the <HI>United Netherlands</HI> had fitted out another Fleet to assist <HI>Reciffa,</HI> the <HI>West-India</HI> Company having first demanded of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> two hundred and eighty Tuns of Gold, to the value of which they affirm'd themselves to have been damag'd by the Insurrection of the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> On the other side, the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> was in a quandary about the Business of <HI>Brasile;</HI> for first, he had no other thoughts but that <HI>Brasile</HI> would have fall'n into his hands within the space of three Moneths, because the Plot there was so subtilly laid; neither did he think the <HI>States</HI> would have concern'd themselves with the <HI>West-India</HI> Companies Business, which now it was manifest they did. Besides this, there was a third Inconvenience, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Crown endeavor'd to conclude a Peace with the <HI>United Netherlands;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Overtures of Peace from the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> resus'd by the <HI>Ne∣therlands.</HI></NOTE> wherefore that he might put a stop to the sending of the Fleet to <HI>Brasile,</HI> he dealt with the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador to make very advantageous Proffers in his behalf, <HI>viz.</HI> That he would surrender all the conquer'd Places, and make good all the Damages that had been sustain'd thereby. The Fleet appointed to go to <HI>Brasile</HI> was hereupon stopt, till the <HI>States</HI> had Consulted about an Answer on the fore-mention'd Propositions; but when <HI>Haeks</HI> brought news of the falshood of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> the Scale was im∣mediately turn'd, insomuch that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ambassador went in danger of his Life, till the Mutineers were put into Custody. Moreover the Fleet was order'd to Sail with all speed possible to <HI>Reciffa,</HI> with promise that another Fleet should soon follow with six thousand Men; but the many disconsolate tydings that had been brought of late, of the hardships and sufferings of those that went before, through the unwholsomness of the Climate, the want of Provisions, the Strength and Cruelty of the Enemy, made the Seamen and Soldiers very unwilling to go so fatal a Voyage, insomuch that as many as could, made their escape: yet at last, on the last day of <HI>December,</HI> Anno 1647. the Fleet set Sail under the Command of <HI>Corneliszoon de Wit;</HI> some Weeks before which <HI>Schuppe</HI> was forc'd to desert the Island <HI>Taperica,</HI> to go and aid <HI>Reciffa,</HI> which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> from a rais'd Battery on the other side of the River <HI>Biberibi</HI> shot at so incessantly, that none were safe either in their Houses or in the Streets.</P>

<P>The rest of the Provinces, especially <HI>Friesland,</HI> being less inclin'd to the <HI>West-India</HI> Company, were somewhat colder in the pursuit of this Business; nevertheless, up∣on a fresh Letter of Complaint from <HI>Walter Schonenbergh,</HI> President of the <HI>Brasilian</HI> Council, they held a Consultation together, how to raise Moneys for the fitting out of twenty Ships and five Ketches for the Relief of <HI>Brasile.</HI></P>

<P><HI>ROdulphus Baron,</HI> to make a Discovery of the Countrey, upon the Encourage∣ment of <HI>Grave Maurice,</HI> who allow'd him to that purpose a yearly Reve∣nue, undertook a remarkable Journey, accompany'd with three <HI>Tapuyans;</HI> who goings out of the Village <HI>Caneri</HI> without any store of Provisions, left the Moun∣tains <HI>Cupaeva</HI> on the right-hand, and went seventy Leagues into the Countrey, without meeting with any People, onely he found one Mountain of <HI>Fossile</HI> Glass; from whence he went Southward to the Villages of the <HI>Waripebares</HI> and <HI>Caripati,</HI> who having courteously Entertain'd him, appointed certain Persons to accompany him from one Village to another, with Orders to Complement <HI>Grave Maurice,</HI> who sent them home with several Gifts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Waripebares</HI> and <HI>Caripati</HI> inhabit fourteen Villages on the Mountains which Bound <HI>Brasile</HI> Westward, live by Hunting and Fishing, eat wild Honey and all manner of Fruit, and maintain continual Wars against a mighty People which in∣habit the Western Plains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Customs and Manners of the <HI>Tapu∣yans.</HI></NOTE>As for the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> they range up and down between the Rivers <HI>Grande, Quoau∣guho, Ocioro, Upameoma,</HI> and <HI>Voiroguo,</HI> without having any setled Abodes; they are a strong People, stern of Countenance, and black Hair'd: In stead of Circumcising their Children, they cut them, which is done after this manner: The Priests stand on a row, Dancing and Singing, whilest one of them swings the Child round about his Head before all the Multitude, and then runs away with it; at last returning, sets it in his Lap, whilest another Priest cutting a Hole in the Ears and Lips thereof, puts little Bones into the same, and the Mother cries and howls after a terrible manner. At these Ceremonies, which end with Dancing and Singing, their King is always present.</P>
<P>The Virgins are kept by their Parents till the Mothers perceive them to have their. Monethly Courses, which they immediately reveal to the Priests, who ac∣quaint the King therewith, before whom the Maid, being Painted red, is brought; whom having smoak'd with Tobacco, he throws an Arrow at a Garland, which
<PB N="596" REF="396"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> she wears on her Head, and if he chances to hit it, he gives her his Benediction, by licking certain parts of her Body, from which she hopes to receire long Life.</P>
<P>So soon as a Woman is gotten with Child by her Husband, she lies no more with him, but he is permitted to enjoy his other Wives, whose number is either more or less, according to every ones pleasure. The Women after Delivery eat their After-birth.</P>
<P>Adultery is free for Men, but if Women be taken in the Act, they are immedi∣ately put to Death.</P>
<P>After they have done Soweing and Planting, the King calls all his People and Subjects together, and appears to them hung round with Garlands; and all of them have their Bodies Painted and stuck full of divers colour'd Feathers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange kind of Progno∣stication.</NOTE>The Priests when they go about to foretel future Events, either Sing or Pipe, and at the same time hold up their Heads towards the Skie, and stand gazing, as if they saw some strange Vision in the Air; on some of their Backs hangs a Bundle of Ostriches Feathers; some throw Feathers in the Air, to see which way the Wind blows. When the Waters overflowing <HI>Brasile</HI> did much harm, <HI>Anno</HI> 1641. the Priests being Consulted, brought forth the King's <HI>Calabash,</HI> in which lay their sa∣cred Stones call'd <HI>Cohuterak</HI> and <HI>Titscheyouh,</HI> and began to Dance and Sing; next six Priests were plac'd in a row, which were to Prognosticate: whereupon the first taking up a Stone, said, <HI>The</HI> Netherlanders <HI>have given Battel to those in</HI> St. Salva∣dor, <HI>but are now about an Agreement:</HI> The second held up a Blossom of <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat, and foretold that there would be plenty of that Grain: The third holding a white Pebble-stone, promis'd store of Milk: The fourth grasp'd a Stone like Bread, telling them that the Countrey should produce much Bread: The fifth holding up a Bowe and Arrow hung full of Feathers, cry'd aloud, <HI>This is a Gift of the Angels, Birds shall flie thicker than these Feathers hang together:</HI> The sixth, having a lump of Wax, foretold that there would be plenty of Honey made by the Bees that year.</P>
<P>They worship the Constellation <HI>Ursa Minor.</HI></P>
<PB N="597" REF="396"/>
<P>They observe a very strange way of Purging; for with a Stick they thrust sharp Leaves down their Throats into their Stomach, which they turn so long till they vomit Blood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Wrest∣ling.</NOTE>In the Summer they have a general Meeting for Wrestling, and other Exercises, which lasts three days. The Wrestlers are strangely attir'd; for they are all over their Bodies beset with divers sorts of Feathers, and in stead of Boots or Buskins, wear the Barks of Trees about their Legs; their Hair besmear'd with Honey, and ty'd in a Tuft, hangs down behind; on their Crowns they wear a Plume of Fea∣thers, about their Necks a Band or Gorget of Feathers; at their Arms they tie the Wings of the Birds <HI>Kohitub,</HI> and on their Backs a green Bough; their whole Bo∣dies Painted with divers Colours, and their Hair all Red: Thus accoutred, they Engage one with another, and if there be an old Grudge between them, then they Fight in earnest, and often kill one another: The Victor with strange Actions upbraids, the Vanquish'd with Cowardise, and ever after enjoys his Wife and Children.</P>
<P>They eat the Serpent <HI>Manuab,</HI> being four Yards long, and on the Tail having a Horn, which with a push it thrusts into Man or Beast, as it lights, then winds it self about the Body, and sucks till it hath suck'd the last drop of Blood.</P>
<P>Here are also Serpents which are so poysonous, that the least Wound receiv'd by them is mortal, unless the part bitten be either immediately cut out, or off.</P>
<P>The Priests cut the deceased Bodies into pieces, which are roasted by old Wo∣men; the Bones are taken out, and at the next publick Feast are stamp'd, mix'd with Water, and Drank: But the Bodies of Noblemen are to be eaten by none but Persons of that Rank.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner Crow∣ning their Kings.</NOTE>They also Crown their Kings after a strange manner, <HI>viz.</HI> The Priests, who are best with Feathers, anoint him with sweet-smelling Oyl, or Balsam, and put a Crown of divers colour'd Feathers on his Head, after which they all fall a Singing and Dancing; but if any one happen to speak a word of the deceased King, they all begin to howl and cry. The Kings Authority consists more in Advising than Commanding.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Opi∣nions concer∣ning the Soul.</NOTE>They believe that the Souls of those who die a natural Death are immor∣tal; but those that are kill'd by their Enemies, devour'd by ravenous Beasts, or poyson'd, are totally extinguish'd both Soul and Body for ever. They say like∣wise that Hell is Westward near a dark Pool, where the Devil Examines every Soul how they liv'd on Earth, and what Death they dy'd; the Good are Ferry'd over to a delightful Valley, where there is plenty of Fish, Honey, and Flesh; but the Wicked are miserably tormented.</P>
<P>The Natives live peaceably amongst themselves, their Law being for those that have not, to ask, and for those that have, to give.</P>
<P>They never Travel in the Night for fear of Serpents and other ravenous Beasts, neither do they go any whither till the Sun has dry'd up the Dew.</P>

<P>Their Army they order by blowing on the Horn <HI>Inubia;</HI> others play on Mens Bones kill'd a little before: for going by Water they use Boats made of the Barks of Trees, each whereof being able to carry fifty Men, go exceeding swift: The strongest Men always march before, and as many as they take, whether Men, Wo∣men, or Children, they are all kill'd and roasted in their <HI>Boucans.</HI></P>

All their Prisoners they fatten, and eat them at a Merry-meeting; at which when they have Danc'd seven hours together, three Men lead the Prisoner, ty'd with a Rope made of the Bark of a Tree call'd <HI>Juira,</HI> through their Village, whilest the Prisoner looking to and again, saith in a scornful manner thus unto them, <HI>You, do ye hear?

<P>Strangers in <HI>Brasile</HI> are also much troubled with a Giddiness, occasion'd by the extream Cold in the Night; as also with with sore Eyes, which they get by going abroad before Sun-rising, or after Sun-setting.</P>
<P>The Palsie is also very common there, taking People so suddenly, that falling down stiff on the Ground, they are often in danger of losing their Breath.</P>
<P>Besides these there are several other Distempers that very much infest <HI>Brasile,</HI> as the Bloody-flux, Dropsie, Rising of the Gall, Worms, Meazles, and St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Fire.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. XIV.</HI> The Councellor <HI>Dussen</HI>'s Relation of so much of <HI>Brasile</HI> as concerns the <HI>West-India</HI> Company.</HEAD>
<P>THat part of <HI>Brasile</HI> which the <HI>West-India</HI> Company have subdu'd by force of Arms on the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> is divided into six Counties, <HI>viz. Sere∣gippa, Pernambuco, Itamarica, Parayba, Rio Grande,</HI> and <HI>Siara.</HI></P>
<P>The Expedition undertaken by <HI>Gysseling</HI> and <HI>Schuppe</HI> made <HI>Seregippa</HI> desolate, the Inhabitants wheof remov'd to the Coast <HI>Todos los Sanctos.</HI></P>
<P>Also <HI>Siara,</HI> which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> formerly possess'd, was thinly inhabited, and had a mean Fortress there, whither some few <HI>Brasilians</HI> came now and then to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> assistance.</P>
<P><HI>Pernambuco,</HI> lying between the Rivers <HI>Francisco</HI> and <HI>Tamarica,</HI> excells the other Countrey in fruitfulness and pleasantness. The <HI>Brasilians</HI> compare it to a hollow Rock, under which fresh Water flows.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Havens of <HI>Pern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbuco.</HI></NOTE>Moreover, <HI>Pernambuco</HI> hath several Havens, <HI>viz.</HI> the outermost Road before <HI>Re∣ciffa,</HI> which being in the open Sea, is somewhat dangerous, but the innermost is secure against all Storms; also at the Promontory St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> where the Mouth of the Haven is narrow and dangerous, by reason of the Rocks and shallow Grounds; the Island <HI>Alexio</HI> is very fit to Crain Ships in; <HI>Barra Grande</HI> hath a large and safe Inlet, convenient for all manner of Vessels, yet it is inferior to <HI>Cororipa;</HI> lastly, the Havens <HI>Jaragoa</HI> and <HI>Franco</HI> are very eminent.</P>
<P>Amongst the Rivers, the chief are <HI>Jangades, Serinhain, Formosa, Porto Calvo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> <HI>Cama∣rigibi, Antonio, Michael,</HI> and <HI>Francisco.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pernambuco</HI> also is divided into six Jurisdictions; the first and most ancient is <HI>Igarazu;</HI> the second and biggest, <HI>Olinda;</HI> the third, <HI>Serinbain;</HI> the fourth, <HI>Porto Calvo;</HI> the fifth, the <HI>Alagoas;</HI> and the sixth, <HI>Rio Francisco,</HI> which is the Boundary of <HI>Pernambuco</HI> on the South.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns of <HI>Pernambuco:</HI></NOTE><HI>Pernambuco</HI> also boasts five Towns, <HI>viz. Garasu, Olinda, Maurice-stadt,</HI> to which also belongs <HI>Reciffa, Bella Pojuca,</HI> and <HI>Formosa.</HI> The Villages <HI>Moribeca, St. Laurence, Antonio, Amaro,</HI> and others are also not inferior to little Towns.</P>
<P>The Countrey is for the most part Hilly, but is exceeding fruitful in the Val∣leys, and near the Rivers, especially in Sugar-Canes.</P>
<P>Here are also a hundred and twenty Sugar-Mills, of which a great number stand still for want of <HI>Negro's.</HI></P>
<P>Next <HI>Pernambuco</HI> lies <HI>Tamarica,</HI> which hath onely one Haven, one City, and twenty three Sugar-Mills, of which thirty are onely employ'd. This Island pro∣duces excellent Grapes and Melons, yet is for the most part barren, by reason of the Pismires.</P>
<P>The Countrey <HI>Parayba</HI> hath its Denomination from the River which washeth it, being deep, and without any Rocks or Sands; on the Banks thereof stand twenty Sugar-Mills, two of which are still standing.</P>
<P>In the Lordship of <HI>Rio Grande</HI> stands the Town <HI>Puntael,</HI> whose Buildings were ruin'd in the Wars; after which the Inhabitants had leave to build them another City on a fruitful Soil.</P>
<P>The Countrey hereabouts us'd formerly to be very full of Cattel, but was not onely bereav'd thereof by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Portuguese,</HI> but also for the most part made desolate.</P>
<PB N="602" REF="399"/>
<P>The River which washes the Castle <HI>Ceulen,</HI> affords a convenient and safe Harbor for all sorts of Vessels.</P>
<P>This Lordship of <HI>Rio Grande</HI> boasts onely two Sugar-Mills, of which one is de∣cay'd; so that in all those Parts in <HI>Brasile</HI> which belong to the <HI>West-India</HI> Company, are a hundred and sixty Sugar-Mills constantly employ'd, besides forty six which are about repairing. It is scarce to be reckon'd how much Sugar they make yearly, in regard, through the alterations of the annual Seasons, as also the more or less fruitful Fields, they produce one year, and in one place, more than in another.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are of two sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> free People, and Slaves; the Slaves are <HI>African Negro's,</HI> and the others, <HI>Netherlanders, Portugueses,</HI> or <HI>Brasilians;</HI> which last came in of their own accords, or else were absolv'd from their Oaths, and ac∣quitted from their Martial Offices; yet are ready to venture their Lives and Estates, and to Serve either on Foot or Horseback for their Freedom against their Enemies. Those that went from the <HI>Netherlands</HI> to <HI>Brasile</HI> on their own Accounts, drive a Trade, or Serve the Traders, or else keep Inns, and follow Handicraft Faculties; some of which, when grown rich, buy Parts in Sugar-Mills; others live on Tilling: by all which several sorts of People <HI>Reciffa</HI> is very well inhabited, and full of Hou∣ses, which yield great Rents, and are held at high Prices: wherefore <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> thought good to mark out pieces of Ground on the Isle <HI>Antonio Vaes,</HI> which were sold for a considerable Sum of Money, insomuch that in a short time a new Ci∣ty call'd <HI>Maurice-stadt</HI> was built on the same, and inclos'd within strong Bulwarks; yea, notwithstanding the Rumor of a great <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet in some measure abated the Courage of the Builders, yet the City was extended down to the Fort <HI>Frederick Henrich,</HI> and a brave Bridge laid over the Stream <HI>Biberibi,</HI> cross which they go from <HI>Reciffa</HI> to <HI>Antonio Vaes,</HI> where no People were in greater esteem than Handicrafts∣men, who could get their ten or twelve Shillings a day. The Labor which is re∣quir'd in the Sugar-Mills, no Men are able to undergo but the <HI>Negro's.</HI> Of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> some have liv'd here a considerable time; others lately came hither, being most of them <HI>Jews,</HI> of whom there live a great many at <HI>Reciffa,</HI> and are very dili∣gent in promoting of Trade: They possess several Sugar-Mills, and are kept very much under; their whole study and contrivance is for Gain; they conceal their Hatred against the <HI>Christians,</HI> as also their Covetousness, yet are mortal Enemies to the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> The <HI>Brasilians,</HI> who are the ancient Inhabitants, live apart from other People in their Villages, consisting of long Straw Huts, forty or fifty of them under one Roof sleeping on woven Hammocks; they esteem no Houshold-stuff but Nets and <HI>Calabashes,</HI> using the first to fish with, and the other to drink out of; about their Huts they plant <HI>Mandihoka</HI> and <HI>Brasile</HI> Trees; when they are not employ'd in the Wars, they spend most of their time in Hunting, but many in Idleness; they esteem wild Fruits better than those which are Planted; they Drink night and day, making their Liquor of the chew'd Root <HI>Mandihoka,</HI> or the Apples <HI>Tajovis;</HI> they esteem nothing so much as strong Drink, and to wear Linnen next their Skins; they would not value Money, could they but get Brandy and <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine with∣out it; if they are not promis'd a Reward, they will not work. Each Village, nay House, hath its peculiar Governor; but besides him there is a <HI>Hollander,</HI> who stirs up the Idle to work, and takes care that the Owners of the Sugar-Mills do them no injury: They never suffer themselves to be Hir'd for above twenty days, at the end whereof they demand their Wages; they are commonly employ'd to chop Wood to boyl the Sugar with; but by reason of the scarcity of <HI>Negros,</HI> they are often made use of for other Business, which to avoid they hide themselves; as also when they are to go to Fight; they are hard to be kept in Ranks, for they will
<PB N="603" REF="399"/>run out of their own Fyle into another on the least occasion; but if they put their Enemy to flight, they pursue him, and spare none alive. They little regard the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, yet some of them have learn'd the <HI>Lord's-Prayer</HI> and the <HI>Creed</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Priests. The Minister <HI>Davil</HI> having learn'd the <HI>Brasilian</HI> Tongue, Con∣verted very many of them, and Baptiz'd them in their Villages.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brasilian</HI> Women and Children usually go to Wars with their Husbands and Fathers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brasilian</HI> Slaves were some years since bought of the <HI>Tapuyans,</HI> or made Slaves, because they assisted <HI>Boudewyn Henrickszoon,</HI> when he Landed in the Inlet <HI>Tra∣luson;</HI> but they have since obtain'd their Freedom of the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> The <HI>Angolan</HI> Slaves can undergo greater Labor than any other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brasile</HI> Wood grows generally ten or twelve Leagues up in the Countrey from the Sea, not in particular Woods, but amongst other Trees.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negro's,</HI> when the Sugar-Mills work not, are employ'd in pulling off the white Bark, three Fingers thick, from the Tree, which bears dark-green Leaves, small and prickly at the ends, and hanging on thin Stalks, but bearing neither Blos∣soms nor Fruit.</P>
<P><HI>Osnabrig</HI> Linnen is highly esteem'd amongst the <HI>Brasilians,</HI> as also colour'd Wax, Copper, Tin, Wine, Beer, Butter, Cheese, Meal, Stock-fish, Pork, Hung-beef, and Gammons of Bacon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Papists</HI> Teach and observe their Religion in publick, their Spiritual Men being divided into Priests and Monks; the Monks consist of <HI>Franciscans, Carmelites,</HI> and <HI>Benedictines;</HI> the <HI>Franciscans</HI> being the most eminent, possess six fair Cloysters, besides which they have neither Land nor other Revenues, but live on what is gi∣ven them daily; their Cloysters stand in <HI>Frederick-stadt, Iguaraca, Olinda, Pojuca, Serin∣hain,</HI> and <HI>Antonio Vaes.</HI> But the <HI>Carmelites</HI> have three Structures at <HI>Parayba,</HI> and as many more in <HI>Frederick-stadt</HI> and <HI>Olinda,</HI> where they live plentifully on what they reap from Tillage, Rents of Houses, and Legacies of deceased Persons. The <HI>Bene∣dictins,</HI> though they possess onely two Cloysters, one in <HI>Frederick-stadt,</HI> and the other at <HI>Olinda,</HI> yet they have the greatest Income from the Sugar-Mills of <HI>Muserapa,</HI> and the Countrey about <HI>Parayba,</HI> as also Cattel and Cane-Fields.</P>
<P><HI>Reciffa,</HI> the Seat of War, hath two Horn-works towards <HI>Olinda;</HI> the first rais'd with Stone, defends the Haven with seven Brass Demi-Culverins; the other lies opposite to the River <HI>Biberi,</HI> and hath five Brass and two Iron Guns. <HI>Reciffa</HI> also hath a strong Rail about it, and many Guns plac'd in good order. Near the Pow∣der-house stand two Batteries with Guns.</P>
<P>On the Shore towards <HI>Olinda,</HI> lies the Stone Castle <HI>St. Joris,</HI> on a Hill opposite to the Haven, fortifi'd with a Bulwark and thirteen Iron Guns.</P>
<P>The Water-Castle, built round, rises out of the Sea, and stands at the end of the Stone Cliff, which makes an Inlet, through which the Ships Sail that come to, and go from <HI>Reciffa.</HI></P>
<P>The Fort <HI>Bruine</HI> hath four Points, seven Brass Guns, and Pallisados round about.</P>
<P>Somewhat farther is the Redoubt call'd <HI>The Lady Bruine,</HI> which hath two Brass Guns.</P>
<P>The Castle <HI>Waerdenbergh,</HI> built before the Mouth of the River <HI>Capivaribi,</HI> in the Bay made by the River <HI>Biberibi,</HI> hath three Points, each rais'd square, because the fourth Bulwark towards <HI>Antonio Vaes,</HI> cannot be finish'd, by reason the Earth is sunk away.</P>

<PB N="604" REF="400"/>Vaez.</HI> That part of the City which respects the Fort, lies open, with five Points and a double Horn-work; it is the more secure from any Invasion, because the Countrey round about is overflow'd at High-water. On the Horn-work stand eight Brass Guns; but the four Redoubts along the River <HI>Capivaribi</HI> are decay'd.</P>
<P>The square Fort <HI>Prince William,</HI> standing in a low Ground not far from the River <HI>Afogados,</HI> hath four Bulwarks, and is inclos'd with a high Wall and strong Pallisa∣do's: the Church appearing above all other Houses in the Castle, may be seen at <HI>Olinda.</HI></P>

On the other side of this Palace stood a Banquetting-house, near a row of Pome-granate-Trees, and another of Fig and Cittron-Trees. Behind the Palace was a Fish-pond with two Iles, for the Swans. A Dove-house also appear'd near the Fort <HI>Ernestus,</HI> where the <HI>Negro's</HI> watch'd the Horses, and led them to Water in a Fishpond in a large Wood.

<P>Moreover, <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> extended his new City to the Fort <HI>Frederick Henrick,</HI> di∣vided the Morassie Grounds by several Moats, and laid a Bridge cross the River <HI>Biberibi,</HI> between <HI>Reciffa</HI> and the City <HI>Maurice,</HI> and another cross the Stream <HI>Capiva∣ribi,</HI> between the said City <HI>Maurice</HI> and the Main Land.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Description of <HI>Guiana.</HI></NOTE>NOrthward of <HI>Brasile,</HI> over against <HI>Maragnan,</HI> lieth the Countrey of <HI>Guiana,</HI> not improbably suppos'd to be so call'd from the River <HI>Wia,</HI> one of the principal Rivers of the Province, which yet is said to have more and fairer than any other part of <HI>America</HI> besides: It is by some call'd <HI>The Wild Coast,</HI> for what reason is uncertain, it being found to be a very fruitful and pleasant Countrey: It is Bounded on the East, with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, or <HI>Mare del Nordt;</HI> on the West, with some undiscover'd mountainous Countreys, which lie on that side of the <HI>Andes;</HI> on the North it hath the great River <HI>Orenoque;</HI> and on the South, that of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> or <HI>Orellana;</HI> which last Name, as we have said before, it de∣rives from <HI>Francisco Orellana,</HI> who is said to have first discover'd it in the Year 1543. It was anciently call'd <HI>Tobo, Topoi,</HI> and <HI>Tapera.</HI></P>
<P>This Countrey lieth on both sides of the <HI>Aequator,</HI> extended from the fourth Degree of Southern Latitude, to the eighth Degree of Northern, yet enjoyeth a temperate and good Air, not oppressed with any excessive Heat; which is chiefly attributed to the Breezes, or Easterly Winds, almost perpetually about Noon blowing upon it. Towards the Sea-side it is for the most part a flat and level Countrey, in the more Inland parts mountainous and swell'd with Hills, but in all it is generally of such a rich and fertile Soil, that for Fruits, or any outward Com∣modities of the Earth, it yields not to any other Province of the <HI>New World,</HI> but ra∣ther far excelleth the most, having as it were a continual Summer, without Win∣ter or Autumn, the Trees never uncloth'd or made bare, Fruits always ripe, or growing to maturity, the Meadows and Pastures always verdant and green, and, as we said, so excellently well water'd with Rivers, that no Countrey in the World seems comparable to it in this respect. But since the several Occurrences of <HI>Orella∣na</HI>'s Expedition will give much light to the more particular knowledge of these Parts, we thought good to insert this following Relation thereof.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> A Relation of the Journey of <HI>Francisco Orellana.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Francisco Orellana</HI> travelling with <HI>Gonsalvo Pizarro</HI> from <HI>Quito,</HI> to find out the Countrey <HI>Cundirumarca</HI> (where the Natives, according to the information of a strange <HI>American,</HI> went Arm'd with Golden Plates) he came after a great deal of hardship to the River <HI>Maranon,</HI> where <HI>Pizarro</HI> building a Brigantine, put all his sick and maimed Men into the same, as also all his Baggage under the Com∣mand of <HI>Orellana,</HI> whom he commanded to forage for some Provisions, of which the Army, that was to follow along the Shore, had great want; but <HI>Orellana</HI> was in few days driven down so far, that he saw no hopes of getting up again in a years time, and Engag'd daily with the <HI>Indians,</HI> which came aboard of him in little Boats; at last he went ashore and conquer'd a Village, in which he found Provisions, some Gold, and Gems of great value: not long after which he was in great danger, by reason of a River, which with great force fell into the Channel in which he Sail'd,
<PB N="608" REF="408"/>and for the space of two hundred Leagues saw neither Man nor House: Next Land∣ing at a Village, he was by the Governor thereof Presented with Turtles, Par∣tridpes, Fish, and other Provisions, and also forewarn'd of the valiant Women, the <HI>Amazones,</HI> which they call'd <HI>Camapuyara.</HI> Going from hence, he met for eighty Leagues together, nothing but steep and craggy Mountains on each side of the Shore, insomuch that he could not Land any where for Provisions. Next coming to the inhabited Province <HI>Machiparo,</HI> he was fiercely assaulted for two days and two nights, by the Casique <HI>Aomagua,</HI> who pursu'd him with several Boats: Not long after having conquer'd a Village, out of which ran several trodden Paths into the Countrey, he came to a River, in the Mouth whereof there lying three Isles, he gave it the Denomination of <HI>La Trinidad,</HI> which washeth a fruitful Coast, along which Sail'd divers small Vessels. Somewhat farther in the River <HI>Trinidad</HI> stood a Village and Banquetting-house, where <HI>Orellana</HI> took abundance of Provisions, Sil∣ver, Gold, and Earthen Ware curiously Glaz'd and Painted, but judg'd it very ha∣zardous to travel far into the Countrey by the common High-ways, in regard of the multitudes of People that frequented them, to whose Civility he durst not trust; therefore Sailing from hence a hundred Leagues farther, he came to the Countrey belonging to the Lord of <HI>Paguana,</HI> who civilly Entertain'd him, and Presented him with Sheep, not unlike the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> and all manner of good Fruit, which the Countrey affords in great abundance. After this on his Lar-board side he disco∣ver'd a River, whose being black like Ink, and disemboguing into another, disco∣lour'd the Water thereof for the space of twenty Leagues; he also saw several Vil∣lages, and at last found the Stream to be so broad, that he could not see from one Shore to the other: he took one of the Villages without any resistance, there being none but Women in the Huts, whither the Men came towards the Evening. Near another Village he espy'd seven Heads sticking upon Poles, from whence the Pro∣vince receiv'd the Denomination <HI>De las Picotas,</HI> from whence ran several pav'd Ways, on each side planted with Trees, into the Countrey; where Landing, he furnish'd himself with <HI>Maiz,</HI> Turtles, Geese, and Parrots, and at <HI>Can</HI> Island took an <HI>American</HI> Prisoner, who inform'd him, that he was in the <HI>Amazones</HI> Jurisdiction, and that up in the Countrey liv'd a People not unlike the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> amongst whom were two white Women, brought thither up the River by a Lord. Going farther he saw divers Villages on each side of him, and at last Landing in a little Town, he found plenty of Oats, Liquor made of Oats, Cotton, Linnen, a Temple hung round about with Arms, and two Episcopal Miters of divers colours. Near a Pro∣montory jutting out into the River, the Tide went so strong, that he was not able to Land; upon the Point stood several fair Buildings, where were also white Women, of a big stature, with long Hair, who animated the Men to fight. This Countrey, which extends it self a hundred and fifty Leagues along the Shore, with Hills, Pasture-Grounds, and Champain, and well inhabited, being discover'd on <HI>St. John</HI>'s Day, was call'd <HI>The Province De San Juan;</HI> which leaving, he came to seve∣ral Isles, the biggest whereof extended fifty Leagues in length, all of them stand∣ing on high Ground, pleasant, and full of People, who in Boats, by them call'd <HI>Periagues,</HI> valiantly Engag'd with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but one of them not long after be∣ing taken Prisoner, inform'd them, that the <HI>Amazones</HI> dwelt in Stone Houses, Wall'd Towns, had plenty of Silver and Gold, and four stately Temples enrich'd with Plates, Dedicated to the Sun. But <HI>Orellana</HI> Sailing a hundred Leagues farther, along a Coast belonging to the Lord of <HI>Caripuna,</HI> according to the Prisoners Relation, the Inhabitants hereabouts shot abundance of poyson'd Arrows at the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but they made a shift to escape them, and Sailing within sight of Land into the Bay

<P>North-West from <HI>Wiapoco</HI> rises the Mountain <HI>Gomeribo,</HI> which produces <HI>Maiz,</HI> Tobacco, Cotton-Trees, and Vines.</P>
<P>In the same place the Creek <HI>Wainary</HI> runs Westwardly with fresh Water a days Journey into the Countrey; and from the said Creek a high Mountain, fit for the production of Sugar and Tobacco, extends it self to the River <HI>Apurwaca,</HI> where the <HI>Wiopocaries</HI> inhabit a great Tract of Land.</P>

<P>Since this last Expedition of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> we find not that there hath been any great Resort or Trade unto this Countrey, except by a few <HI>Netherland</HI> Mer∣chants, who have yearly sent eight or nine Ships to the River <HI>Orinoque</HI> for To∣bacco.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The tempe∣rature of the Air.</NOTE>As for the Air or Climate of <HI>Guiana,</HI> it is very differing, for about the <HI>Amazone</HI> River, dry Weather begins about <HI>August,</HI> and the windy and rainy Season about <HI>February;</HI> but Westward towards <HI>Orinoque,</HI> the Summer takes beginning in <HI>October,</HI> and the Winter in <HI>April;</HI> the Days and Nights are almost of an equal length, and the difference of Heat and Cold is but little.</P>
<P>Burning-Feavers, Dropsie, and the <HI>Jawnes,</HI> destroy many People here; which last is not unlike the <HI>POX,</HI> and proceeds from carnal Copulation with the <HI>Guianian</HI> Women, who are naturally subject to this Disease.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the Inha∣bitants.</NOTE>The Inhabitants are divided into several sorts, the chiefest whereof being the <HI>Caribbees</HI> go naked, covering onely their Privities with a Lappet. The Women, though yellow, are very comely; and both Men and Women paint their Bodies with <HI>Netto,</HI> which grows on little Trees in Cods: They make Holes through their Noses, Lips and Ears, and hang Glass, Bells, pieces of Copper, or any other Trifles that they get from the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> in them: About their Necks, Arms and Legs, they wear Strings of Beads, or Cockle-shells.</P>
<P>Their Houses with low Roofs, serve them onely to sleep in the Night upon Cotton Hammocks, for in the day-time they sit under high Arch'd open places, that the Wind may blow full upon them. Their Houshold-stuff consists of Earthen Pots and Dishes neatly painted. They live in Tribes or Families together in a Town, which is Govern'd by the eldest of them; and their <HI>Militia</HI> is Commanded by one that is able to endure most Stripes with Switches without any shew of pain. The chiefest of their Families have commonly three or four Wives, whereas others are contented with one. The Men seldom do any toilsom Work, but make their Wives do all, insomuch that as soon as a Woman is Deliver'd of a Child, she must immediately go about her usual Employment, whilest her Husband lies lozelling out his Moneth on a Hammock.</P>
<P>Their Language sounds not unpleasantly, but is hard to learn, because many words differ but little in the pronunciation, and yet have quite another signi∣fication.</P>
<P>When they march into the Field against their Enemies, then the General sends a Stick to all the Villages under his Jurisdiction, on which are cut so many Notches as there are Days appointed before he intends to set forth, which they cut out again as the Days expire, and on the last they repair to the appointed place.</P>
<P>A not much unlike Custom they observe in all Promises and Bargains; for they give one another as many Sticks as they desire Days to perform the same in, and so throw away every day one, till they have onely one remaining, and then they begin to think of performing their Promise or Bargain.</P>
<P>They know no word whereby to express any greater number than Ten; Twenty they express by laying their ten Fingers on their Toes, and all that ex∣ceeds Twenty, they compare to the Hairs of their Head, crying <HI>Ounsa awara.</HI></P>

<P>There is but little of Religion that can be ascrib'd to these People, onely that some shew Reverence to the Sun and Moon, which they believe are both living Creatures; but they make no Offerings to them.</P>
<P>Their Funeral-Feasts for great Persons are strangely kept, <HI>viz.</HI> all the Men ma∣king themselves Drunk with the Liquor <HI>Parranoro,</HI> Dance three or four days one after another, and he that drinks most, and is worst Drunk, gains the greatest Ho∣nor, whilest the Women lament and mourn for the Deceased.</P>
<P>Their Priests, call'd <HI>Peeaios,</HI> are in great esteem amongst them, because they pre∣tend that they Converse with the Spirits <HI>Wattipa</HI> and <HI>Yarakin,</HI> which the <HI>Guianians</HI> ex∣ceedingly fear, apprehending themselves often beaten black and blue by them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peeaios</HI> also profess themselves to be Chirurgeons and Doctors, but if they cure not their Patients, they go in danger of their Lives, unless they speedily get away.</P>
<P>They burn their dead Bodies, together with those things the Deceased affected most in his Life-time. A Prince or Governor also hath his Slaves put to to death at the time when he is burn'd, that they may serve him in the other World.</P>

<P>The Tygers here are either black, spotted, or red; but the black exceed the other in cruelty, yet are seldom seen near inhabited places; the spotted and red devour abundance of Cattel, but will seldom set upon a Man, especially in the day-time.</P>
<P>The Woods are also full of Land-Turtles, which the Inhabitants take, and keep till they have occasion to make use of their Flesh.</P>

<P>The Eagles that are here with their Claws, Engage with those that go about to take them.</P>
<P>The Catamountains make such an exceeding noise at a certain hour, both in the Night and in the Day, that it is heard two Leagues off.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marmozets,</HI> a little Beast, biting the Catamountains and Apes in the Ears, forces them to leap from one Tree to another.</P>
<P>The black Beast <HI>Quotto</HI> hath a Face like an old Woman, and hanging by the Tail, swings from one Tree to another.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cuscary</HI> is a brown four-footed Creature, about the bigness of a little Dog, but hath the shape of a Lyon.</P>
<P>Moreover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE><HI>Guiana</HI> produces Teal, Geese, Crains, Phesants, Partridges, Pigeons, Marlins, Snipes, Falcons, Plovers, and Parrots of all sorts, besides many other strange Fowls; amongst which the chiefest are a sort whose Feathers glitter like Scarlet, and walk along in Rank and Fyle like Soldiers.</P>
<P>The Sea produces abundance of Turbots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fise.</NOTE> Soals, Thornback, yellow Salmon, Sturgeon, Black-fish, Gurnets, Crabs, and Oysters.</P>
<P>Amongst other Fishes, the <HI>Cassoorwa,</HI> which is somewhat bigger than an Eel, is very strange, having two Sights in each Eye, of which it always holds one above, and the other underneath the Water when it swims.</P>
<P>Here are also the great Fishes call'd <HI>Manati</HI> and <HI>Num-eel,</HI> by which if any part of a Man be touch'd, it immediately becomes stiff.</P>
<P>There are likewise divers Vermine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vermin.</NOTE> which trouble the Countrey <HI>Guiana,</HI> among which are Serpents of thirty Foot long, that come out of the Water and feed on the Land; they do little hurt, as not being poysonous: but there are many of a lesser size, whose biting is so venomous, that it causes the Flesh of a Man to rot in twenty four hours time: others there are which have forked Tails, and Tusks in the Roof of their Mouthes.</P>
<P>The Crocodiles here also devour abundance of Cattel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange kind of Scorpions.</NOTE>The Scorpions, which are black, and resemble a Lobster, breed under dry Wood or Corn; their Stings are hid in their Tails, with which if any one be touch'd, he is sure to endure an intolerable pain, but without danger of losing his Life for the present, yet nothing can perfectly cure the same, except the Scorpion kill'd and laid on the Wound.</P>
<P>The Bats here are as big as Pigeons, and they suck the Blood of Men and Beasts so gently, that they seldom perceive the same.</P>
<P>The Pismires also do great mischief, especially in sandy Grounds; and likewise the <HI>Musketo's,</HI> whose Stings cause painful Swellings; but these most of all trouble them that inhabit near the Sea side on low Lands, insomuch that the Fisher-men bury themselves in the Night in Sand, leaving onely Holes to breathe at.</P>
<P>Frogs and Toads also make a terrible noise here, and especially after Rain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣ties of the Countrey.</NOTE>The Soil is inferior to none in the World, for the production of Sugar; but the general Commodities of the Countrey are Flax, Cotton, Hemp, the Berry <HI>Annoto,</HI> which Dyes an excellent Orange colour, another Berry which Dyes a deep Blue, a Tree whose Leaves Dye a Red, and the Wood of another Tree whose Juice Dyes a Purple and Crimson.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Guiana</HI> produces the Gums <HI>Lemnia, Barattu,</HI> and <HI>Carriman,</HI> which be∣ing black and prickly, smells very pleasantly, and cures the Head-ache, Bruises, Pains in the Limbs, Gouts, and green Wounds. The same operation hath the Gum <HI>Baratta.</HI></P>
<P>Here are also good <HI>Sena, Bolus Armenius, Cassia-Fistula, Terra-Lemnia,</HI> the Berry
<PB N="619" REF="415"/><HI>Kelette,</HI> very effectual against the Bloody-flux, the Juice of the Leaf <HI>Upee,</HI> which cures the Wounds of poyson'd Arrows, and a sort of somniferous Apples, whereof the least bite occasions a deadly Sleep.</P>
<P>There is also a Tree, generally growing about the Houses of the Natives, the Boughs whereof bruis'd between two Stones, and thrown into the Creeks of deep Water full of Fish, cause them to swim above Water upon their Backs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Letter</HI>-Wood, call'd <HI>Pira timinere,</HI> turns also to a good account, much more the excellent Stones, Jasper and Porphyr.</P>
<P>Nor are there wanting Gold and Silver-Mines, which doubtless would yield great profit, were they open'd.</P>
<P>The Grain of the Countrey grows on Stalks seven Foot long, on the tops whereof hang two Ears full of Kernels as big as Pease, which ripens in four Moneths.</P>
<P>The Sugar-Canes, being of the bigness of a Man's Arm, and about six Foot long, are at the years end cut off, broken and press'd in a Mill; after which the Juice boyl'd in Copper Kettles to a certain Substance, is put into woodden Tun∣nels, square at the top, and narrow at bottom, with a small Hole, which is open'd as soon as the Sugar is sufficiently hardned, to let out the Syrrup; after which it is put into Hogsheads, and so Transported.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negro's</HI> which are brought from <HI>Angola</HI> and <HI>Guinee,</HI> are so cruelly us'd, that they oftentimes through despair destroy themselves.</P>
<P>The whole Countrey of <HI>Guiana</HI> is by several modern Writers methodically divi∣ded into these inferior or lesser Provinces, 1. <HI>Rio de las Amazones.</HI> 2. <HI>Wiapoco,</HI> or <HI>Guiana,</HI> properly so call'd. 3. <HI>Orenoque;</HI> and 4. The Islands of <HI>Guiana.</HI></P>

The Countrey was first discover'd by the fore-mention'd <HI>Francisco Orellana,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard</HI> from <HI>Quito,</HI> but it was onely by the River <HI>Orellana;</HI> and though he be credibly reported to have Sail'd no less than eighteen hundred Leagues down the Stream, and to have discover'd a rich and fair Countrey on both sides the River, well peopled with Natives, and giving in divers places no small Arguments of greater Wealth and Riches more within Land; yet such was the bad success of his second Endeavors, and likewise of those that follow'd him, as is evi∣dent from what hath been before related, that, as yet, there seems no farther Re∣port to be given, at least not of any thing special, concerning that part of the Countrey.</P>

The Countrey on both sides of the River is very rich and fertile, and so naturally apt, both for Sugar-Canes, Cotton-Wooll, and Tobacco, that they are said to grow here (all of them very good) without Planting, or any art of Husbandry. In this Countrey likewise should be the fa∣mous <HI>Dorada,</HI> as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it, or <HI>City of Gold</HI> (if it could be found) with the reports and hopes whereof some of our own Nation seem to have been not a little possess'd as well as the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> nor can we much blame them; for if the Stories of it had prov'd true, it must have been one of the goodliest and fairest Cities in the World (not to speak of the Wealth.) <HI>Diego de Ordas,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard</HI> of whom we have
<PB N="620" REF="416"/>lately had occasion to make frequent mention of, being reported by some to have travell'd one whole day, and half another in it, before he could arrive at the King's Palace; which yet must be suppos'd to have stood but in the midst of the City. Places of less Magnificence, but more Certainty, are 1. <HI>Caripo,</HI> which was once a Colony of <HI>English,</HI> setled there by Captain <HI>Robert Harcourt,</HI> Anno 1608. upon the Banks of <HI>Wiapoco,</HI> and not far from the Mouth of it; being a place, by the advan∣tage of a Rock, which it hath on the one side of it, of great strength and very dif∣ficult access; the Air about it sound, and said to be very agreeable to <HI>English</HI> Bodies. 2. <HI>Gomaribo,</HI> Colony formerly of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> on the North-West side of the Bay of <HI>Wiapoco,</HI> but since deserted by them. 3. <HI>Woyemon.</HI> 4. <HI>Crewinay,</HI> both of them Towns of the Natives, not far distant from the other.</P>

The Places in it already known are onely 1. <HI>Coniolaba,</HI> as they call it, which seems to be some Town of the Natives, lying a few Leagues di∣stant from the <HI>Orinoque,</HI> towards the South. 2. <HI>Morequito,</HI> a known Port or Haven-Town upon a Branch of the <HI>Orinoque,</HI> much frequented, and of great use to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> when they discover'd these Coasts. 3. <HI>Wenicapora:</HI> and 4. <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> the onely Town which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> hold upon this part of the Continent, situate upon the principal Channel of the <HI>Orinoque,</HI> and consisting of two hundred Families, or thereabouts: It is now a fortifi'd Place, and was taken by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> in that unfortunate Action of 1617. above related more at large.</P>

<P>This Countrey lying as it doth, brings us back again by the Eastern Coast to the <HI>Isthmus</HI> or <HI>Strait,</HI> which, as we have often said, joyns the two parts of the Con∣tinent of <HI>America</HI> together, at least to those Countreys that lie next upon it to the South, <HI>viz.</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Granada,</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD>SECT. II. Cumana.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds and Description of <HI>Cumana.</HI></NOTE><HI>CUmana</HI> is bounded Eastward with the Gulf of <HI>Paria</HI> and the River <HI>Orinoque;</HI> on the West, with <HI>Venezuela;</HI> Northward it hath the <HI>Atlantick;</HI> and on the South, those undiscover'd Countreys above mention'd; extending a∣long the Northern Ocean, over against <HI>Margareta,</HI> two hundred Leagues or more, as some say, in length, and not much less than a hundred in breadth.</P>
<P>The Coast of this Countrey, as well as of the Islands <HI>Margareta</HI> and <HI>Cabagua,</HI> hath formerly been much fam'd for the rich Trade of Pearls and Pearl-fishing; which failing, its principal esteem now is for an excellent Vein of Salt, which they dig here as out of a Mine, and gather it naturally made ready to their Hands, not half a Mile from the Sea side, on the back side of the Promontory or Cape, by some call'd <HI>Punto de Araya,</HI> and by others for this reason <HI>Cape de Salinas.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns and Places of note.</NOTE>Places of chiefest consideration here, are 1. <HI>Cumana</HI> it self, a Colony of <HI>Spaniards</HI> seated on the Banks of a little River two Miles distant from the Sea, where it hath a good Harbor.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>St. Jago,</HI> a very strong Fortress, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of late years have built, for the defence and security of the Salt-works against the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who began to Trade much that way, and in the Year 1622. had a Design to have made them∣selves Masters of the Place.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>St. Michael de Neveri,</HI> another Fortress of theirs, standing upon a River bearing the same Name.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Guaniba,</HI> a Town of the Natives.</P>
<P>This Countrey of <HI>Cumana,</HI> being generally infested with terrible Crocodiles, hath a large Inlet call'd <HI>Cariaco,</HI> which flows fourteen Leagues into the Countrey.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners and Customs of the People.</NOTE>The Men of this Countrey wear Cotton Cloaks, and anointing their Bodies with Gum, stick the same full of Feathers.</P>
<P>When they go to Wars, or to a general Feast, then they shave their Hair off above their Ears, pull out their Beards, and black their Teeth with a certain Herb.</P>
<P>Their Princes and Grandees take as many Wives as they please, and give to those of their Guests whom they intend most to oblige, their choice of the fairest of them to lie with.</P>
<P>Whoring is accounted no shame, except amongst Marry'd Women, who gene∣rally live very Chaste, unless their Husbands consent to their Adultery.</P>
<P>The Women also Hunt, Fish, Shoot, and Swim, and are diligent in Tilling their Lands, and other Houshold Affairs. Most of them have sore Eyes, occasion'd not so much (as some wrongfully suppose) by their drinking of the Water out of the Stream <HI>Cumana,</HI> but proceeding rather from their unwholsom Food, as Spiders, and the like.</P>
<P>Amongst the several sorts of Trees that grow here, there are some that yield a white well scented Gum, or delicious Juice like Milk, and produce a Fruit not un∣like a Mulberry, which may be boyl'd to an excellent Syrrup; the Wood also strikes Fire: There are others, whose Timber is good for Shipping.</P>
<PB N="622" REF="417"/>
<P>The Soil also produces <HI>Cassia-Fistula,</HI> Roses, and other strong smelling Flowers and Herbs.</P>
<P>For Beasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> besides Lyons, Tygers, and wild Hogs, there are several strange kinds here, as the <HI>Cappa,</HI> which is bigger than an Ass, having shaggy and black Hair; it runs away from Mankind, but devours whasoever else it meets with.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aranata,</HI> which hath a Goats Beard, and is of the bigness of a Greyhound; it howls very dreadfully, and feeds on Fruits.</P>
<P>The wild Cats which breed here, leap, though great with Young, from one Tree to another.</P>
<P>In the Evening a Beast like a lean Dog comes to their Huts, cries like a Child, and devours all those it meets abroad; wherefore every one that goes out in the Night carries a lighted Stick with him, for this Beast dreads the sight of Fire.</P>
<P>The Trees give Harbor to great numbers of Parrots, and other fine Feather'd Birds.</P>
<P>The Bats here are very large and hurtful, sucking the Blood from Men and Beasts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muschito's</HI> also do very much plague and vex the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The Spiders, much bigger than those of <HI>Europe,</HI> and of divers colours, make very strong Cobwebs.</P>
<P>Along the Sea-Coast, and in the Rivers is plenty of delicious Fish.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1513. two <HI>Dominican</HI> Fryers went over from <HI>Terra Firma</HI> to <HI>Cumana,</HI> where the Natives kindly Entertain'd them, till a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship Anchoring there for the Pearl-Trade, carry'd away by violence the Governor and seventeen of his Servants; whereupon the Natives threatned, that unless their Lord was restor'd, they would put the two <HI>Dominicans</HI> to death; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> promising restauration of him in four Moneths time, inform'd the Council at <HI>Hispaniola</HI> of it, who not consenting to his Releasement, the two Monks were, according the former threatning, presently put to death. Yet after this the <HI>Franciscans</HI> and <HI>Dominicans</HI> built each of them a Cloyster in the Province of <HI>Chiribichi,</HI> where they kept friendly Correspondence with the <HI>Cumana's,</HI> till <HI>Anno</HI> 1520. when <HI>Alonso de Ojeda</HI> coming to an Anchor before <HI>Maracapana,</HI> under pretence of bartering <HI>Maiz</HI> for <HI>Spanish</HI> Goods with the <HI>Tagarez,</HI> who came about fifty from the Mountains on which they liv'd, being three Leagues up in the Countrey, and brought <HI>Maiz</HI> down to the Shore, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took thirty six of them Prisoners, and kill'd or wounded the rest: Whereupon the Gover∣nor <HI>Gonzales</HI> being complain'd unto by the neighboring Prince <HI>Maraguey,</HI> and his assistance desir'd in taking Revenge of the <HI>Dominicans</HI> and <HI>Franciscans,</HI> who had urg'd and perswaded <HI>Ojeda</HI> to the fore-mention'd Act, <HI>Gonzales</HI> hereupon made an Agreement with <HI>Maraguey,</HI> that he should destroy the Monks, whilest he himself would kill <HI>Ojeda,</HI> which they accordingly perform'd. The Council in <HI>St. Domingo</HI> inform'd hereof, immediately sent three Ships, Mann'd with three hundred Men, under the Command of <HI>Gonzalo de Ocampo,</HI> who Anchoring in the Haven of <HI>Mara∣capana,</HI> feign'd as if he came newly from <HI>Spain,</HI> and that he knew nothing of the Business between <HI>Ojeda</HI> and <HI>Gonzales,</HI> that so he might entice the Natives into his Ship, and accordingly when divers of them came aboard, the Armed <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> started from under the Decks, and hung them up at their Yard-arms, burnt the Village <HI>Maracapana,</HI> and ruin'd the Countrey far and near with Fire and Sword.</P>
<P><HI>Ocampo</HI> also built the Town <HI>Toledo,</HI> about half a League farther into the Coun∣trey, where the Bishop <HI>Bartholomew de las Casas,</HI> making his Visitation, commanded <HI>Ocampo</HI> to forbear his cruelty against the Natives, he having daily either burnt, hang'd, beheaded, or made Slaves of some or other of them. <HI>Casas</HI> also caus'd a
<PB N="623" REF="417"/>little Fort to be built at the Mouth of the River <HI>Cumana,</HI> to be near to prevent the inhumane Murders and Oppressions committed by his Countrey-men; but be∣cause the Inhabitants of <HI>Cubagua</HI> bereav'd him of his chief Builder, his Fort was left half unfinish'd; wherefore <HI>Casas</HI> leaving the Command of this Countrey to <HI>Fran∣cisco de Soto,</HI> went back to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where in <HI>St. Domingo</HI> he made his Complaints to the High Court of Justice of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Cruelties; but being little regarded, he went into the <HI>Dominicans</HI> Cloyster, till he was call'd out and made Bishop of <HI>Chiapa.</HI> Mean while <HI>Soto,</HI> contrary to <HI>Casas</HI> his order, had fitted out two Ships to Trade along the Coast of <HI>Paria;</HI> but the Expedition prov'd very unsuccessful,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Soto</HI> with all his Men de∣stroy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> for he and all his Men were destroy'd by the Natives; not without just reason, for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (according to the Relation of <HI>Casas</HI> from an Eye-witness) destroy'd this Countrey after such a manner, that a Ship Sail'd between <HI>Lucago</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola</HI> sixty Leagues without any Compass, finding the Way onely by the floating of dead Bodies, thrown out of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships.

<P>But <HI>Soto's</HI> Death was not left unreveng'd; for not long after <HI>Jacob Castellon</HI> setting Sail from <HI>St. Domingo,</HI> left several Companies on <HI>Cubagua,</HI> to re-build the Town <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and rais'd a Fort at the Mouth of <HI>Cumana,</HI> which hath ever since been kept by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who made great slaughter amongst the Natives.</P>

<P>When the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth Marry'd with <HI>Isabella,</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> Anno 1526. the <HI>Welsares,</HI> being <HI>Dutch</HI> Gentlemen in <HI>Augsburgh,</HI> made an Agreement with him for a Sum of Money, to Conquer <HI>Venezuela;</HI> whither they sent <HI>Ambrosius Alfinger,</HI> and <HI>Bartholomeus Sayltar,</HI> with four hundred Foot and eighty Horse: These Forces Landing at <HI>Venezuela,</HI> drove away <HI>Juan de Ampues,</HI> who Sail∣ing from <HI>St. Domingo</HI> thither, had discover'd the Coast along <HI>Coriano,</HI> and already made an Agreement with a mighty Prince of that Countrey, call'd <HI>Manaure.</HI> But <HI>Alfinger</HI> marching to the Lake <HI>Maracabo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alfinger</HI>'s horrid Cru∣elties upon the Natives.</NOTE> destroy'd all the Inhabitants of the Coun∣trey <HI>Axaguas,</HI> though they came to meet him Dancing, with rich Presents of Gold; which he not regarding, kill'd them, drove some into a House, and there cut them in pieces, and burnt those that were got upon the Roof. From hence going towards the <HI>Pocabuyes,</HI> who dwelt on the West side of <HI>Maracabo,</HI> amongst high Mountains, he was Entertain'd by them a considerable time very courteously, and Presented with rich Gifts, for which at his departure he shut up both Men, Women, and Children, into a high Wall'd Park, where they were all to perish, if they did not every one pay a certain quantity of Gold to be releas'd, which not being able to raise, they all dy'd for want of Food. After the same manner he dealt with the neighboring People <HI>Alcoholados,</HI> of whom he got much Gold, but not without un∣heard of Cruelties; for he burnt all their Villages and Houses, ruin'd the Coun∣trey with Fire and Sword from <HI>Thamaleque</HI> to the River <HI>Lebrixa,</HI> carry'd away ma∣ny of the Natives coupled together with Chains about their Necks, and each of them loaded with at least a hundred pound weight of pillag'd Goods; and as soon as any of them began to faint under their Burthens for want of refreshment, their Heads were immediately cut off. But <HI>Alfinger</HI> coming to certain cold Mountains, was resisted by a valiant People; in which Conflict he receiv'd a Wound, of which he dy'd at his return to <HI>Coro,</HI> Anno 1532. Upon which the <HI>Welsares</HI> sent <HI>John Aleman</HI> to succeed him; but he also dying, made place for <HI>George de Espoira,</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Federman,</HI> of which two <HI>Espoira</HI> being the chief, spent three years in ranging up and down the Countrey, without any remarkable Transactions, being continually at variance with his Lieutenant <HI>Federman.</HI></P>

<P>The Countrey <HI>Paragoana</HI> is low and full of Venison; out of the middle of it rises a high Mountain, the Inhabitants whereof are very hospitable and courteous.</P>
<P>The Lyons that breed in this Countrey run away from Men; but on the con∣trary, the Tygers are exceeding cruel.</P>

<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1552. <HI>Juan de Villegas</HI> discovering the Province <HI>Tucuyo,</HI> he found several rich Gold-Mines near the Mountain <HI>Pedro,</HI> out of which springs the River <HI>Burio.</HI> Near this place he built the Town <HI>Segovia,</HI> which, by reason of the unwholsom Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Segovia <HI>built by</HI> Juan de Villegas.</NOTE> was soon after transplanted, and built on the Shore of the River <HI>Bariquicimeto,</HI> so call'd,
<PB N="626" REF="421"/>because the Water when touch'd, turns to an Ash-colour. The Plain Countrey round about would be intolerable hot, did not the cool Winds that blow from the Mountains temper the same.</P>

<P>In the Summer they all store themselves with Venison, which they catch after this manner: They set the dry Bushes and Brambles on fire, which makes the wild Hogs, Goats, Deer, <HI>Armadillo's,</HI> Tygers, the great Serpents <HI>Bobas,</HI> and other wild Creatures, to leap forth from their Holes and Receptacles to shun the same, whilest the Hunters standing ready with their Bowes and Arrows, seldom miss one of them.</P>
<P>In the hollow Trees near the Rivers, the Bees make abundance of Honey for them.</P>
<P>Most of the Rivers here fall into the Stream <HI>Huriapari,</HI> which glides from the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Mountains to the Northern Ocean.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. The Islands Margareta, Cubagua, and Coche.</HEAD>
<P>NOtwithstanding we have already spoken something of the Islands <HI>Margareta,</HI> and <HI>Cubagua,</HI> in regard they are by some reckon'd amongst the Isles of <HI>Northern America;</HI> yet because they are by many accounted to make up a part of the Division of <HI>New Andalusia,</HI> we shall add in this place what we have found most worthy of Re-mention, though much to the same purpose as before.</P>
<P>The Island <HI>Margareta,</HI> discover'd by <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> Anno 1498. contains thirty two Leagues in circumference, hath many Woods and Pastures, yet little fresh Water. To the Eastward of it lie the Cliffs <HI>Testigos,</HI> where it is very moun∣tainous, as also on the East. Round about the same are delicious Fish, without which the Natives could not live, because the brackish Soil produces but little Pro∣vision.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pearl-Fishing of <HI>Margareta.</HI></NOTE>The chiefest thing for which this Island <HI>Margareta</HI> is famous, is the Pearl-Fishing, for which in times past a great Trade was driven, though of late it is come to little or nothing. The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with inhumane cruelty, taught the <HI>Ne∣gro's</HI> to Dive for the Pearls, for those that were not nimble or dextrous enough, they beat unmercifully, dropt scalding Wax or scalding Oyl upon them, or stig∣matiz'd them with hot Irons. The Pearl-Banks were cover'd with five, six, seven, or eight Fathom Water; from whence the <HI>Negro's</HI> pull'd the Oysters with such force, that the Blood gush'd out of their Mouths and Noses when they came above Water to breath; after which, to refresh them, they receiv'd a Glass of Wine and a Pipe of Tobacco. The <HI>Spanish Kiay</HI> receiv'd a fifth part of the best Pearls that were taken here; but whether the Oysters have forsaken this Place, or
<PB N="628" REF="422"/>their growth hinder'd by often Fishing for them, we know not, but however it is, few Pearls are found here of late years, which makes <HI>Margareta</HI> to be more and more deserted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the Island of <HI>Cubagua.</HI></NOTE>Between the Main Continent of <HI>Paria</HI> lie the Islands <HI>Cubagua</HI> and <HI>Coche;</HI> the first whereof hath an unfruitful and sultry Soil, without either Trees, Birds, and four∣footed Beasts, except <HI>Pock</HI> Wood, Sea-Fowls, or Parrots; and <HI>Castilian</HI> Hogs being carry'd thither, change their Nature strangely; for in a short time their Claws grow long and crooked.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI> us'd formerly to receive fifteen thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> yearly for his fifth part of the Pearls chat were taken; which Gain invited many thither, who built the Town <HI>Nova Cadiz</HI> on <HI>Cabugua</HI> in the Year 1521. but when the <HI>Arayans</HI> de∣molish'd the Monks Cloyster on <HI>Paria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>No∣va Cadiz</HI> built there, but at length totally de∣serted.</NOTE> the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> being three hundred in num∣ber, fled from <HI>Nova Cadiz</HI> to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where the High Court, displeas'd at their cowardly deserting the Place, gave them but cool Entertainment, and sent five Ships under the Command of <HI>Jacomo de Castellan</HI> to <HI>Cubagua,</HI> to build new Store∣houses in <HI>Nova Cadiz,</HI> which was afterwards re-inhabited; but when the Pearl-Fishing ceased, the Island and Town was at once deserted.</P>
<P>Opposite to <HI>Margareta</HI> lies the Promontory <HI>Araya,</HI> behind which lies a salt Lake, in which is found abundance of Salt, not onely above, but under the Water; with which the <HI>English, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships are fraighted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Da Vern</HI>'s Description of the Salt∣pans on <HI>A∣raya.</HI></NOTE><HI>Isaac du Verne</HI> describes the Salt-pans on <HI>Araya</HI> thus: <Q>Round about the same (saith he) the Ground is craggy, barren, and of a brackish taste, and destitute of fresh Water, which is therefore fetch'd three Leagues farther out of a Brook, flowing from the Mountain <HI>Bordones</HI> into the Bay of <HI>Comena;</HI> likewise all manner of Provisions are brought from other Parts. Westward from the Point <HI>Araya</HI> there is a convenient Harbor where the Ships take in their Salt. Three hundred Paces from the Shore lies a great Salt-pan, where the Salt being first beat in pices, is carry'd in Wheel-barrows to the Ships. The little Salt-pan produces less Salt, and lies also out of the way, which makes few Ships take in their Lading from thence.</Q></P>
<P>The Countrey is every where overgrown with Brambles and Bushes, in which breed Tygers and very poysonous Serpents. There are likewise abundance of Stags, Bucks, Hares, and Coneys, besides other strange Beasts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Nether∣landers</HI> beaten out of their Salt-Trade here by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></NOTE>Till <HI>Anno</HI> 1605. the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> came hither unmolested for Salt, when eight <HI>Spanish</HI> Gallions falling unawares upon them, strangely misus'd their Seamen; but afterwards the <HI>United Netherlands</HI> having made an Agreement with <HI>Spain</HI> for a cer∣tain time, renew'd their Trade to <HI>Araya,</HI> till the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> having for the bet∣ter security of the Place, built the Fort <HI>St. Jago,</HI> which Commanded the great Salt∣pan, forbad the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> from lading any more Salt; who thereupon Storm'd the Fort, though to their cost, for several of them were kill'd, and the rest return'd home empty.</P>

<P>THe River <HI>De la Plata,</HI> by the Natives call'd <HI>Paranaguazu,</HI> is next to the River of the <HI>Amaszones,</HI> the greatest in the World, and falls into the Northern Ocean between the Capes <HI>An∣tonio</HI> and <HI>Maria,</HI> lying thirty Leagues one from another: It receives from East and West divers Rivers as far as the Lake <HI>Xarays,</HI> lying three hundred Leagues up in the Coun∣trey from the Mouth of <HI>La Plata.</HI> Also into the fore∣men∣tion'd Lake fall several Streams, which spring out of the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Mountains <HI>Andes.</HI></P>

A hundred Leagues farther dwell the <HI>Payaguaes;</HI> and yet farther into the Countrey the <HI>Chames</HI> and <HI>Carcares</HI> pos∣sess much Gold and Silver, with which <HI>Juan d' Ayola</HI> having enrich'd himself here, was destroy'd with all his Men by the <HI>Chames,</HI> Anno 1541.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nunnez Ca∣beca</HI> his Jour∣ney.</NOTE><HI>Alvarez Nunnez Cabeca</HI> came from <HI>Spain</HI> to be Governor here, but was not able, by reason or contrary Winds and Tydes to reach <HI>La Plata;</HI> wherefore Landing at the River <HI>Itabucu,</HI> and spending nine days in cutting a Way through thick Brambles, he came to the Jurisdiction of <HI>Armiriri,</HI> and a days Journey farther to <HI>Cipoyay;</HI> and not long after to <HI>Tocanguazu,</HI> where the <HI>Guaranies,</HI> who are the Natives, have two Harvests every year of <HI>Maiz</HI> and <HI>Cassavi,</HI> and breed and keep Geese, Hens and Par∣rots in their Houses: They are Man-eaters, and very revengeful. <HI>Cabeca</HI> having given this Countrey the Name of <HI>Vera,</HI> he proceeded on his Journey over the Ri∣vers <HI>Ignazu, Tibagi,</HI> and <HI>Taquari,</HI> on whose Shore appears the Village <HI>Abangobi,</HI> and somewhat farther <HI>Tocanguzir.</HI> The Countrey hereabouts is very fruitful, and hath many delightful Plains, pleasant Rivers, and Woods; but beyond appear Hills, Mountains, deep Morasses, dangerous Cane-Fields, Receptacles for wild Beasts, and great Wildernesses. <HI>Cabeca</HI> having pass'd through them all, came into the fruitful Countrey of the <HI>Guaranies,</HI> who are a wild People, and possess many large Fields of <HI>Maiz</HI> and <HI>Potato's,</HI> also several Silver Mines. From hence travelling Westwardly over the River <HI>Piqueri,</HI> he spent eighteen days before he came to the Stream <HI>Ignazu,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Parana,</HI> and at last came to the River <HI>Paraguay;</HI> along whose, Shore he found a People of a gigantick Stature, call'd <HI>The Agazes,</HI> who regarded no manner of Husbandry, but went out continually a robbing in their <HI>Canoos.</HI> These People, as <HI>Martin del Barco</HI> relates, were not long after all destroy'd by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from the <HI>Agazes</HI> dwell the <HI>Guaycurues,</HI> a valiant People; and somewhat farther the <HI>Cacoves,</HI> whose Countrey produces Gold and Silver; and yet farther in the Countrey reside the <HI>Guaxarapos,</HI> who remove yearly to the <HI>Paraguay</HI> to Fish there when the Water is low; for in the beginning of <HI>January</HI> the River swells so exceed∣ingly, that the Countrey about it being overflow'd, is cover'd with above six Fa∣thom Water. The <HI>Paraguay</HI> discharges its Waters into the great Lake <HI>Xarayes,</HI> full of Islands.</P>
<P>Amongst other Rivers that spring out of the Mountains <HI>Andes,</HI> the <HI>Ignazu,</HI> along whose Shore the People <HI>Xacoaes, Xaquesses,</HI> and <HI>Chanesses</HI> dwell, falls also into the foremention'd Lake. Somewhat farther lies a great piece of drown'd Land, be∣yond which the <HI>Xarayes</HI> have convenient Habitations, plant <HI>Maiz,</HI> and spin Cotton: Their Countrey borders a great Wilderness, which ends about the Province <HI>Tapua∣guazu,</HI> the Inhabitants whereof, call'd <HI>Tarapecocies,</HI> are furnish'd with plenty of all sorts of Provisions. The <HI>Payzunoes,</HI> dwelling on one side of them, are not well known as yet.</P>
<P>Beyond the Town <HI>Assumption</HI> dwell the <HI>Mayaes,</HI> in the Way to <HI>Peru,</HI> and border at he <HI>Tamacoaes,</HI> both which possess Silver-Mines.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> and <HI>Corduba</HI> lies the Plain-Countrey <HI>Despoplado,</HI> ninety Leagues long, without Trees or Houses, but is most Pasture-Ground, which feed many thousands of wild Horses. From hence glide the Streams <HI>Luchan, Los Arre∣chivos, Arreca, Zaracaranna,</HI> and others, into <HI>La Plata.</HI> It is very dangerous for a small Company to travel through this Countrey, because the ranging <HI>Juries</HI> spare none alive they meet with.</P>
<P>Moreover, the River <HI>Grande</HI> flows with a wide Mouth into the Sea, and spreads
<PB N="634" REF="425"/>it self within against the Countrey <HI>Patos.</HI> Also the Rivers <HI>Tamandabug, Ararungo,</HI> and the Lake <HI>Alagoa,</HI> disembogue into the Ocean.</P>
<P>North-East beyond <HI>Alagoa</HI> lie the Islands <HI>Catharina</HI> and <HI>Gale;</HI> and in the Bay <HI>Toju∣qua</HI> appear several Isles.</P>
<P>The Streams <HI>Tajahu</HI> and <HI>Ytabuca</HI> spring out of high Mountains, inhabited by the People <HI>Anniriri</HI> and <HI>Cipopoy.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, the Countrey wash'd by the Stream <HI>Ararapira,</HI> produces all sorts of Pro∣visions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Chili.</HEAD>
<P>THere are in this Countrey both tame and wild Sheep;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cammel-Sheep.</HI></NOTE> the tame ones are call'd <HI>Cammel-Sheep,</HI> being cover'd with long fine Wool, having Necks four Foot long, their fore Feet cloven into four parts, their hindermost into two, their Mouths very wide, which they open at those that vex them, and make such a stink, that no body is able to abide near them; when tir'd, they fall under their Burdens, and will not rise, though beaten never so much: Their Flesh is tough like that of Horses. The wild Mountain-Sheep are red, and have soft glossy Wool, which makes a Stuff like that of a Chamlet: These Sheep run swifter than a Horse; the <HI>Chileses</HI> lead them by a Rope put through their Ears.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grain <HI>Teca</HI></NOTE>This Countrey of <HI>Chili</HI> not onely produces Wheat, Barley, <HI>Maiz,</HI> and all man∣ner of Fruit, but also the <HI>Teca,</HI> which growing half a Yard high, is not unlike Barley; the Grain thereof being dry'd in the Sun, is thresh'd, and parch'd in hot Sand, then ground on a square flat Stone with a round Rowler. This Meal, which is both exceeding wholsom and very nourishing (for a small Measure thereof sufficeth a Man a whole Week,) serves also both for Meat and Drink: for being infus'd in a greater quantity of Water, it becomes a pleasant Drink, and kneaded with a lesser proportion, it is made into Cakes or Loaves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fruit <HI>Ʋnni.</HI></NOTE>The Fruit <HI>Unni,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call'd <HI>Murtilla,</HI> is like a little red Grape, and hath a tart taste. The Wine press'd out of this Fruit is clear to the Eye, pleasing to the Palate, and good for the Stomach, never causing any Head-ache: It also makes good Vinegar.</P>
<P>But the chiefest Benefit of <HI>Chili</HI> is the rich Gold-Mines. The Countrey for the most part lies desolate, occasion'd by the continual Wars which the valiant People <HI>Arauco</HI> maintain'd against the <HI>Spaniards</HI> after such a manner, that in no place of <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> they met with such resistance, or sustain'd such Losses. They speak an elegant Language, according to the testimony of <HI>Elias Herkmans,</HI> who having committed to Wirting all the most significant Words thereof which were taught him by the <HI>Chileses,</HI> it will not be altogether amiss to set down some of them, which are these following:</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>The Seamen who went under <HI>Hendrick Brewer's</HI> Command, <HI>Anno</HI> 1643. from <HI>Brasile</HI> to <HI>Chili,</HI> brought the fore-mention'd Vocabulary along with them.</P>
<P><HI>Chili</HI> is look'd upon as no way inferior to any Countrey in <HI>America,</HI> enjoying a wholsom Air, fruitful Soil, and abundance of Inhabitants, who often furnish <HI>Peru</HI> with Provisions; which are the speedier convey'd thither, because the South-Winds always blow along the Coast.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peruvian</HI> Vice-Roy keeps a Deputy to Govern here. It hath two Bishop∣ricks, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>Jago</HI> and <HI>L' Imperial.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature, Customs, and Manners of the <HI>Chileses.</HI></NOTE>Some of the <HI>Chileses</HI> are under the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Jurisdiction, and live in Huts; others being wilder, defend their Freedom with the Sword. They have great Heads and flat Noses: The Men continually pull out the Hair on their Faces and Privities with Shells, which they carry about their Necks for that purpose, having beforehand rubb'd the Hair with warm Ashes; the Hair of their Heads hanging downwards is cut close as far as their Ears, the rest growing long, is ty'd with the Ribbon <HI>Tariwelonco,</HI> to which Persons of Quality fix Silver Plates and <HI>Turkoises:</HI> Some also cover their Heads with the Skins of Weazels, or the like Beasts, putting the Head over their Foreheads, and the Tail down their Neck; which kind of Co∣vering they call <HI>Maniewelonco:</HI> Others wear Caps made after some strange manner or other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chileses</HI> are not the tallest, but strong and well set, betwixt a white and sallow colour: Those that are in the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Service, wear long Hair, by which they are distinguish'd from the shorn <HI>Ucais,</HI> who do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> all the mischief imaginable. The Women are for the most part low of stature, but of a strong Constitution; they go bare-headed, letting their Hair hang loose over their Shoul∣ders, except when they are indispos'd, and then they tie it up: But those that dwell about <HI>Castro</HI> wear Locks like our <HI>English</HI> Ladies. In <HI>Coquimbo</HI> and <HI>Loquimbo</HI> they go after the same manner as the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Women: All of them have thick black Hair.</P>
<P>Their Apparel, though mean, is neat: The Men wear wide Breeches girt about their Wastes, and a piece of woollen Cloth, three Yards long and two broad, which
<PB N="641" REF="428"/>having a Hole in the middle, they put over their Heads, and so let it hang on their Shoulders, leaving their Arms and Legs bare; but on Festival Days they wear curious embroider'd Stockings. The Women likewise cover themselves with the same piece of Cloth, but after another manner, tying it first about their Middle, then let it down to the Ground, pinn'd before with Silver or Golden Pins; their Heads, Breasts and Legs are uncover'd; the Cloth it self is strip'd with red, white, blue, and yellow, and fring'd at the edges. For an Example of their quick and easie Labor, <HI>Hendrick Brewer</HI> relates, That a Woman being Deliver'd in his Ship, within an hour after walk'd up and down the Deck, and gave the Child suck. Some of them have such great Breasts, that throwing them over their Shoulders they suckle their Children, being ty'd at their Backs.</P>
<P>Their Huts being low, are made of Straw, Canes, and Boughs, and not built for one single Family; for often thirty, fifty, a hundred, or a hundred and twenty dwell under one Roof, and have a Governor, by them call'd <HI>Caruca.</HI></P>
<P>Their Housholdstuff is little and mean, <HI>viz.</HI> two or three Cans to keep their Li∣quor <HI>Chica</HI> in, Horn Cups, a Stone whereon they grind their Corn, and one or two woodden Stools: The chiefest of them also use Sheep-skins, which they spread on the Ground before their Guests. They live without care, for they neither Sowe nor Plant any more than will serve them a Year.</P>
<P>Their Riches consist in Cattel, of which they have no great plenty.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>October</HI> a whole Town meets together to Plough and to Sowe, which the Men perform in two days time, the rest of the Work being left to the care of the Women; for the Men never meddle with Reaping or Harvest.</P>
<P>They eat and drink from Morning to Evening, when they do not travel, for then they eat at set-times. Their Liquor is made of Barley-Meal, or Wheat boyl'd in Water. On Festival Days they drink <HI>Chica,</HI> Brew'd of <HI>Maiz</HI> chew'd by the Teeth of old Women. They likewise make a Liquor of the Fruit <HI>Unni,</HI> which tastes like <HI>Madera</HI> Wine.</P>
<P>Every Man Marries as many Wives as he can buy and maintain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mar∣riages.</NOTE> for Maids and Widows must be sold by the Parents, who set not a Price upon them according to their Beauty or Quality, but their skill in managing Houshold Affairs. Their Marriages are perform'd after a strange manner: A Son having no Inheritance, lives on the Charity of his nearest Relations, who Present him, one with a Hog, another with a Cow, a third with a Sheep, and a fourth with somewhat else: thus enrich'd, he goes to his Mistresses Father, and hangs some <HI>Turkoises</HI> and Plates of Silver about his Neck, and acquainting him with what Estate he can make his Wife, he agrees as well as he can with his intended Father-in-law, to whom he gives ten, fifty, or a hundred Sheep, Oxen, Cows, Hogs, Horses, Poultrey, a Coat, and some Vessels full of <HI>Chica;</HI> which done, the Father leads his Daughter to the Bridegroom's House, where he is Entertain'd with Meat, but finds the Drink at his own Cost. Some days after the Celebration of the Wedding, the nearest Relati∣ons come to congratulate the young Marry'd Woman, and at Dinner sing an <HI>Epi∣thalamium</HI> to their Nuptial Deity <HI>Maruapeante,</HI> all of them sitting on the Ground on Sheep-skins. The Allies often take away a Woman from her Husband, especially when he misuses her; and if a Man kill his Wife, her Death is reveng'd by her Rela∣tions. Persons of Quality build a Hut for every one of their Wives, sending word to her whom they have a mind to enjoy: They respect one above the rest, who are in a manner but Slavesses, being forc'd to do all the Drudgery. The Men are exceeding jealous and chollerick, cruelly beating their Wives, if they chance but to look on another Man; and if they take them in the Act of Adultery, they im∣mediately
<PB N="642" REF="429"/>kill them; yet for all this they are not Chaste, but very Libidinous. As soon as a Woman is Deliver'd of a Child, she washes her self and the Child in cold Water; then kills a Lamb call'd <HI>Chiluraque,</HI> and makes a Feast; at which she her self eats and drinks freely amongst the rest, and the next day goes about her usual Employment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> tell us, that their Women, if they continue long in this Countrey, are more and more hardned by the Air, and are as little concern'd at the Birth of a Child as the Natives.</P>
<P>A Widow hath free leave to Marry again, provided she hath given to her Chil∣dren part of what she hath; but if she Marry not, but return to her Parents, then she is highly esteem'd of.</P>
<P>Both Men and Women wash themselves in the Rivers in the coldest Weather.</P>
<P>They adore chiefly their Deity <HI>Pillan,</HI> and the Devil, who doth them much hurt. They acknowledge no Resurrection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Reli∣gion, and manner of burying their Dead.</NOTE> accounting long Life in this World the greatest Good; wherefore when any one dies, the Friends and Relations make a doleful Cry, and suffer the dead Body to lie three, nay, four Moneths before they bury them, stuffing them full of strong smelling Herbs, to keep them from putrifying: Three days before their Interrment the nearest Allies meet, kill a Sheep, make Merry, and throw the Body into a Hole near the Hut in which the Deceased dwelt, putting also a piece of the slain Sheep, and a Jug full of the Liquor <HI>Chica,</HI> into the Grave.</P>
<P>Concerning their Idol <HI>Pillan,</HI> to whom with strange Gestures they Sing divers Songs, they believe that he is a Spirit of the Air, and Governs all things on Earth. Some suppose him to be Thunder, and therefore they worship him in a most par∣ticular manner when they hear it Thunder; for then they stick an Arrow and Stone Ax into the Ground, and take Arms into their Hands, putting themselves into a posture as if they should suddenly be set upon by a mighty Enemy, and look'd upon it heretofore as a fore-running of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> approach, whose Cruel∣ties they exceedingly dreaded.</P>
<P>They call all their Hero's <HI>Pillans,</HI> and ascribe Divine powers to them.</P>
<P>They take very much strong Tobacco, the Smoak whereof puffing in the Air with strange Gestures, they cry, <HI>Receive this, O Pillan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their cruel usage of Prisoners.</NOTE>When they return home Conquerors from any Victory, they put a Stone Ax into the Ground, and standing Arm'd round about the same, Drink exceedingly, and sing a Song in honor of <HI>Pillan.</HI> They use their Prisoners very cruelly, for forcing them to Dance and make Merry amongst them, they on a sudden cleave their Heads with an Ax, pull their Hearts out of their Bodies, and bite the same with their Teeth. After the same manner they punish their Robbers and Traitors; but those that have good store of <HI>Chica</HI> to Present the Governors with, escape the Execution: Yet this cannot buy off Sorcerers or Witches, who are without mercy burnt alive, with all they enjoy'd.</P>
<P>They have no Priests, nor any that pretend to any religious Function; onely those that can Sing the <HI>Pawary</HI> well, are in great esteem amongst them.</P>
<P>Their second Deity <HI>Maruapeante</HI> (they say) informs them in a Dream when they must Marry; but he doth not do them this kindness before they have made them∣selves Drunk, and sung Sonnets to his praise.</P>
<P>This Countrey is Govern'd by prime Persons, call'd <HI>Ulmen,</HI> or peculiar Lords, call'd <HI>Curacen.</HI> The <HI>Ulmens</HI> and <HI>Curacens</HI> Command twenty five, sometimes fifty, a hundred Families: Their Power consists in calling all the People together, and consulting with them about State-Affairs, which they dare not do with any parti∣cular
<PB N="643" REF="429"/>Person, nor Levy any Tax without extraordinary occasion. They are bound to march in the Front of their Subjects against an Enemy, and are under a Gover∣nor-General call'd <HI>Apocurace,</HI> or under a <HI>Nentoque.</HI> Other lesser Offices are dispos'd of by the <HI>Curaces,</HI> or <HI>Pulmes;</HI> but their <HI>Netonques</HI> are chosen after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of chusing the <HI>Nentoque.</HI></NOTE> When that honorable Place is vacant, then whoever aims at it, computes with him∣self whether his Means will extend so far as to treat the <HI>Curaces</HI> and <HI>Pulmenes</HI> with a noble Treat; which if he is able to do, then he sends for them to an appointed place, whither they all go Arm'd, and whilest they are eating and drinking, he that desires the Place begins to tell them of his noble Extract, valiant Exploits, Riches, and eminent Relations, and therefore desires the Place of the deceased <HI>Nentoque:</HI> then the <HI>Curace</HI> rising, the intended <HI>Nentoque</HI> hangs a Chain of <HI>Turkoises,</HI> or Cockle∣shells about his Neck; whereupon the <HI>Curace</HI> moves the rest to the Election, without any Articles, the new <HI>Nentoque</HI> onely promising to Govern all things for the best advantage and benefit of the common State: which done, the <HI>Curace</HI> takes the Chain of <HI>Turkoises,</HI> and distributes them amongst the primest Persons of Qua∣lity, and so they end the Day in Drinking, Dancing and Singing.</P>
<P>After the same manner they chuse an <HI>Apocurace,</HI> or prime Governor; which of late the <HI>Uca's,</HI> that they may enjoy the more Priviledge themselves, have not elected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chileses</HI> Arms consist of Lances as long again as the <HI>Europeans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms.</NOTE> made sharp at the Points. They also use Clubs plated with Iron, and <HI>Spanish</HI> Swords. The <HI>Pulches,</HI> who dwell behind the high Mountains <HI>Cordilbra,</HI> use poyson'd Arrows, make Helmets and Breastplates of Ox-hides, which neither Sword nor Arrow can enter: they all know how to manage a Horse, and the use of a Lance, but are very much afraid of Musquets or Fire-locks.</P>
<P>Because they can neither write nor read, the Governor by a faithful Messenger sends to his inferior Officers such Commands as he judges may tend to the most advantage of the Publick both in Peace and War. This Messenger carries an Arrow with a Ribbon, as a Sign of his Employment; the Arrow is held in the Right-hand, and if he who receives it will answer the Message, then he sends back the same Arrow with another; but if he judges it convenient to acquaint any other <HI>Curaces</HI> and <HI>Pulmenes</HI> with the same Message, then he sends one of his own Servants to them with the same Arrow.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A particular Account of <HI>Chili.</HI></NOTE>As touching the Climate and Production of <HI>Chili,</HI> this Account is given by an Eye-witness: <Q>The Winter Season (saith he) is so tempestuous, that sometimes the Trees are not onely blown up by the Roots, but the Earth it self is rent asun∣der; some Valleys being fill'd with Snow, swell the Rivers exceedingly when it melts, which overflowing part of the Countrey, makes the same very fruitful. It is also extream cold here, because such sharp Winds blow from the Moun∣tains, that they pierce through the Skin and Flesh of a Man: and indeed these Winds would make the whole Countrey desolate, were not the Mountains over∣grown with great Oaken Trees, against which the Wind breaks. Moreover, the Valleys produce Coals, which serve the Inhabitants for Fewel. The Winter be∣reaves the Trees of Leaves; but not those which grow in the Wildernesses. In <HI>March</HI> the Fields are full of innumerable sorts of sweet-smelling Flowers; out of some whereof are boyl'd the <HI>Angel-Water,</HI> so call'd for its smell and wholsom taste. The Grass grows in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December</HI> as high as our standing Corn. Turnips, Mint, Clover, and Mustard-seed, grow naturally for several Leagues together. Likewise excellent Physical Herbs grow here, whose power and ope∣ration their Doctors, call'd <HI>Maci,</HI> keep from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> These <HI>Maci</HI> are in great
<PB N="644" REF="430"/>esteem, not onely amongst the <HI>Chileses,</HI> but also the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for their great skill in Physick. Amongst these Herbs the chiefest is call'd <HI>Quincia-mali</HI> which grows but half a hands-breadth above the Ground, and spreads into several Stalks like a Nosegay; and on each Stalk is a Saffron-colour'd Flower. This Herb pull'd up with the Root, and boyl'd, and the Decoction given to any one that is bruis'd within, works most wonderfully, for it draws out the putrifi'd. Blood, though sunk never so deep in the Wound. Moreover the Juice of <HI>Culen</HI> is also very healing, if us'd for an Ointment, or pour'd on any Wound. This Herb, by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call'd <HI>Albaciga,</HI> hath sweet-smelling Leaves, and a tall Body. In some places also grows an Herb, not unlike Grass, which boyl'd in Water, immedi∣ately cures the Feaver and Spleen, and cleanses the Blood. There are likewise Medicines here, which dissolving the Stone in the Bladder or Kidneys, cause it to be urin'd forth. The Plant <HI>Luce,</HI> which grows out of rented Rocks which are often overflow'd by the Sea, makes a sort of well tasted Bread.</Q></P>
<P>The Wilderness <HI>Atacama,</HI> which makes a Boundary betwixt <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> extends Northward ninety Leagues, is dry and barren in Summer, and in the Winter ex∣ceeding cold, and cover'd with Snow. No Provision is to be found upon it, except a few wild Sheep, call'd <HI>Guanacos.</HI> About the middle thereof the Brook <HI>La Sal</HI> rising in the Eastern Mountains, flows Westward through a deep Valley to the Southern Ocean.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Troublesom Passage from <HI>Peru</HI> to <HI>Chili.</HI></NOTE>The Water of the fore-mention'd Brook put into any Vessel, immediately turns to Salt, and all along the Shore lie greater or lesser pieces of Salt; so that the Way from <HI>Peru</HI> to <HI>Chili</HI> through <HI>Atacama</HI> is very troublesom: but that which leads thi∣ther over the snowy Mountains <HI>Andes,</HI> is much worse, because it is farther about, and threatens the Traveller with Destruction, if he observe not the right Season of the Year; for in the Winter there blows such a cold Wind on these Mountains, that a Man, being suddenly benumm'd, falls down dead on the Ground, and grows stiff against all putrefaction. <HI>Joseph de Acosta</HI> tells us, that Bodies have been found there as firm and sound, as if they had been living, which had some years before breath'd their last on the said Mountains.</P>
<P>But <HI>Diego Almagro,</HI> who first discover'd <HI>Chili,</HI> Anno 1536. went thither with two Companies of Horse, and five hundred Foot, through the Countreys <HI>Charcas, Chicas, Xuxayes,</HI> and <HI>Chaquana,</HI> and having pass'd over a craggy Soil and the snowy Moun∣tains <HI>Andes,</HI> he entred into the first <HI>Chilean</HI> Valley <HI>Capayapo,</HI> having lost no small number of Men and Horses with Hardship and Cold; the inconvenience there∣fore of both the fore-mention'd Ways between <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> forc'd Travellers to go along the Shore wash'd by the Southern Ocean.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Valley <HI>Copayapo.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Copayapo</HI> bears that Denomi∣nation from the <HI>Turkoises</HI> which a Mountain produces there in great abundance. The Valley it self is the fruitfullest of all <HI>Chili;</HI> for in no place the <HI>Maiz</HI> grows bet∣ter, and in greater abundance than here, the Ears being half a Yard long, and the Stalks the length of a Lance; each Grain that is Sow'n, yields at least three hun∣dred in Harvest. All <HI>Spanish</HI> Fruits grow better here than in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Through the midst of <HI>Copayapo</HI> runs a River of the same Denomination, and twenty Leagues in length from the <HI>Andes,</HI> and at its Mouth hath a convenient Har∣bor before the South Sea.</P>
<P>The South part of <HI>Copayapa</HI> borders the Valley <HI>Guasco,</HI> which is less fruitful than the first, but hath a convenient Haven, into which falls a fresh River, penn'd in by Sluces for the watering of the Cane-Fields. Moreover, there are plenty of Par∣tridges; also wild Sheep and grey Squirrel-skins are of a great value. To the Southward flow also the Rivers <HI>Maypo, Chacha</HI> Pool, <HI>Loro,</HI> and <HI>Moule.</HI></P>
<PB N="645" REF="430"/>
<P>Beyond these Streams Eastward, the <HI>Promonca's</HI> dwell near the Mountains <HI>Andes.</HI></P>
<P>In the Valley <HI>Chili,</HI> which gives Denomination to the whole Countrey, were formerly the famous Gold-Mines <HI>Quillatas,</HI> from whence <HI>Valdivia,</HI> Anno 1544, car∣ry'd an invaluable Treasure. The South Sea makes here a large and convenient Harbor for all manner of Vessels, built two Leagues below the City <HI>Serena,</HI> at a lit∣tle River, which so moistens the low Countrey, that it produces all manner of Plants. It rains here not above three times ayear.</P>
<P>From the Entertainment which Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> met withal here, may suffici∣ently be conjectur'd the Power of <HI>Serena;</HI> for when the <HI>English</HI> Landed here for Water, they were driven away not without great loss by three hundred <HI>Castilian</HI> Horse, and two hundred Foot that Sally'd out of the City. The Mines, though they inclose much Gold, yet they produce but little, because the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> accord∣ing to the testimony of a <HI>Chilean</HI> Pilot, whom <HI>Oliver van Noort</HI> took Prisoner, de∣stroy'd all the ancient Inhabitants that should have help'd them to dig the Gold.</P>
<P>The City <HI>St. Jago,</HI> lying near the Stream <HI>Topocalma,</HI> receives great benefit by the Haven <HI>Valparayso,</HI> which makes the fore-mention'd River, because in that Haven all Goods that come from <HI>Lima</HI> are unladen, and the Goods shipp'd aboard. The Countrey about the same produces plenty of Wines, Apples, Corn, and all sorts of Cattel, and especially Horses in such abundance, that thousands of them run wild.</P>
<P>In <HI>Valparayso</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> took a Ship from <HI>Valdivia,</HI> laden with two thou∣sand five hundred Bars of fine Gold. But the <HI>Netherland</HI> Admiral, <HI>Joris Spilbergen,</HI> had not such good success, who Sailing thither with five Ships, <HI>Anno</HI> 1615. disco∣ver'd a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship in the Harbor; where sending his Boats well Mann'd to fetch off a Vessel that lay hal'd on the Shore, they found it burning, and thereupon Steer'd their Course into a little Inlet full of Rocks, which serv'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in stead of Breast-works; for lying behind them, they fir'd continually on the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> yet <HI>Spilbergen</HI> Landing with two hundred Men, met a considerable number of <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldiers, and Horses drawn out on the Shore, from whom they soon fled.</P>
<P>Before the City <HI>La Conception</HI> lies the Island <HI>Quiriquyna,</HI> whose Straw Huts <HI>Spilber∣gen</HI> laid in Ashes.</P>
<P>At the time when <HI>Oliver van Noort</HI> came to an Anchor here, the Governor <HI>Fran∣ciscus de Quinones</HI> Commanded seven hundred <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldiers to reduce the revolted <HI>Chileses.</HI></P>
<P>Four Leagues from <HI>Conception</HI> lie the rich Gold-Mines <HI>Quilacoya,</HI> which formerly produc'd great Riches.</P>
<P>Over against the Valley <HI>Arauco,</HI> which rises out of the Sea, lies the Island <HI>Maria,</HI> in a large Inlet made by the force of the Waves.</P>
<P>Here grows abundance of Wheat and Barley. The Rivers also afford plenty of Fish, amongst which there is one call'd <HI>The Lake-Spider,</HI> in whose Eyes are to be seen little Specks, which would exceed Pearl, if they were but hard enough.</P>
<P>Two <HI>Spaniards</HI> Command forty Natives on <HI>Maria,</HI> and keep them in such slavery, that they may neither eat Apples, Pears, Grapes, Poultrey, or Sheep, though they are there in great abundance.</P>
<P><HI>Elias Herkmans</HI> was once in probability to have taken possession of this Island for the <HI>Netherland</HI> State, had he not been prevented by an extraordinary occasion.</P>
<P>Between the Towns <HI>Conception</HI> and <HI>Imperial</HI> lie the Provinces <HI>Arauco, Tucapel,</HI> and <HI>Puren,</HI> inhabited by a valiant People, that often alarm the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> In each Pro∣vince <HI>Valdivia</HI> built a Fort in the Year 1551. eight Leagues distant from one another. He also discover'd the rich Gold-Mines <HI>De Ongol,</HI> and built the Fort <HI>Confines</HI> there.</P>
<P>The Natives hereabouts being exceedingly opprest by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> fell upon
<PB N="646" REF="431"/>the Fort in <HI>Puren,</HI> where those in the Garrison, unable to defend themselves, went to <HI>Tucapel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Valdivia</HI> ta∣ken Prisoner, and cruelly put to death by the <HI>Indians</HI></NOTE> and from thence to <HI>Arauco,</HI> to Settle there. <HI>Valdivia</HI> marching with three hundred Men to the Castle in <HI>Tucapel,</HI> was so fiercely assaulted at the River <HI>Leto,</HI> that all his Men were kill'd, and he himself being taken Prisoner, had melted Gold pour'd down his Throat: One Boy onely escaping, brought the news to those in Garrison in the Fort <HI>Arauco,</HI> who fled to <HI>La Conception,</HI> as those from <HI>Puren</HI> to <HI>Imperial.</HI> Not long after the Lieutenant <HI>Francisco de Villagra</HI> went with a hundred and sixty Soldiers to <HI>Raquetta,</HI> a Promontory against the South Sea in <HI>Arauco,</HI> to take Re∣venge for the Death of his General <HI>Valdivia;</HI> but he also had like to have follow'd the same fate, for he left ninety six Men behind him, and with much ado recover'd <HI>La Conception:</HI> By which means the victorious <HI>Chileses</HI> came to be so much fear'd, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> forsook the Towns <HI>Rica, St. Jago,</HI> and <HI>Confines,</HI> and fortifi'd them∣selves strongly in <HI>Imperial.</HI></P>

<P>To <HI>Arauco</HI> belongs the Island <HI>La Mocha,</HI> low on the North side, and rocky on the South; against which the Ocean breaks its Billows: in the middle of it rises a split Mountain, out of whose Gap flows a fresh Brook; the fruitful Soyl produces abundance of Pumpeons, Maiz, Potato's, and all manner of delicious Fruit; as also Oxen, Sheep, and other Cattel, which go grazing up and down in great Herds; the Village that is upon it boasts about fifty Huts, built long of Straw, with a Door in the middle, and round like an Arch on the top.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> and <HI>Candish</HI> were formerly somewhat roughly Entertain'd here by the Inhabitants: but they shew'd themselves somewhat more civil to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admirals,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Van Noort</HI>'s and <HI>Spilber∣gen</HI>'s Enter∣tainment in <HI>Mocha.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Oliver van Noort</HI> and <HI>Joris Spilbergen:</HI> The first coming to an Anchor here <HI>Anno</HI> 1600. put one <HI>John Claeszoon</HI> (Condemn'd for some great Crime to be Landed on some strange Place) ashore on <HI>La Mocha,</HI> with a few Trifles; for which being kindly Entertain'd, the Seamen resolv'd to go ashore the next day, who were like∣wise civilly Treated. The Governor of <HI>Mocha</HI> coming aboard, Lodg'd a Night in the Ship, and afterwards conducted the Admiral through the Village, but forbad the Seamen from entring any of the Huts; out of which the Women upon the hearing of a sudden noise, came running out, and kneel'd down on the Ground in three Parties, whilest an old Matron came forth with a Pitcher full of <HI>Chica,</HI> and gave each of the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> a Cup full to drink, sitting on Blocks in the Fields.</P>
<P>A Man Marries as many Wives here as he can maintain. They all live peacea∣bly one with another, and go Cloth'd with a pair of Breeches, and Frock without Sleeves. The Women tie their Hair in Braids about their Heads, but the Men let it hang down carelesly.</P>
<P>Fifteen years after <HI>Spilbergen</HI> Landing here with four well Mann'd Boats, found the Shore full of People, who had brought all manner of Provisions to barter against Axes and Knives. The Islanders going aboard, wondred to see the Soldiers drawn out in order, and much more when a Gun was fir'd: They furnish'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with a hundred Sheep, amongst which was one with an extraordinary long Neck, and Legs, Hair, Mouth, and Back like a Cammel.</P>

The Countrey round about produces Wheat and Barley; neither are there any Mines to be found that produce finer Gold than those which are hereabouts. In the Mouth of the River which runs to <HI>Baldivia,</HI> lies a small Isle, the Men whereof are gross and fat, and spend their time in Drinking and Dancing, whilest the Wo∣men do all the Work.</P>

<P>The fore-mention'd <HI>Hawkins</HI> in his Voyage towards the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> supposing it by estimation to be fifty Leagues from the Main Coast of <HI>America,</HI> dis∣cover'd forty Degrees to the Southward of the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI> with a Westerly Wind, the unknown <HI>South-Land;</HI> which he found to consist of low Land, and to be inhabited, by reason of the many Fires which he saw ashore in the Night.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Commander, <HI>Peter Fernandes de Quiro,</HI> and the Admiral <HI>Lodowick Paes de Torres,</HI> have made a farther Discovery of this Countrey; for Landing on the
<PB N="654" REF="434"/><HI>South-Land,</HI> they met with several People, some whereof were brown, others white, and others sallow; some had long and lank, others short and curl'd Hair: They acknowledg'd no King or supream Governor, nor were Govern'd by any Laws, neither had they any Wall'd Towns or Forts; but being divided amongst themselves, they continually Encountred one another with Darts, Clubs, and Staves. Their Houses built of Wood, were cover'd with the Leaves of Palm-Trees. Their Housholdstuff consisted in Earthen Dishes, Pots, Ropes, Fish-nets, Flutes, Drums, and varnish'd Spoons. Their Gardens were neatly kept. Near their Temples were Burying-places. They Row'd very swift in little Boats. Their Bread, well tasted, was made of long thick Roots, either roasted or boyl'd.</P>

The next day the <HI>Southlanders</HI> came in several Boats, two and two ty'd together, and cover'd with Planks, towards the Ships;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>South∣landers</HI> despe∣rate Attemp upon <HI>Tas∣man's</HI> Ships.</NOTE> the Gunner of the <HI>Hemskerk</HI> going with six Men in a Boat to help mount some Guns in the <HI>Sea-Cock,</HI> were betwixt both Ships set upon by the <HI>Southlanders,</HI> who approacht with a hideous noise, kill'd four of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with long Poles, and forc'd the other three to save themselves by swimming; which they had no sooner done, but they Row'd with incredible swiftness towards the Shore, insomuch that they were out of the reach of their Guns before they could make ready to fire at them. <HI>Tasman</HI> finding that there was no good to be done here, since he hazarded the Lives of his Seamen against a company of wild People, he set Sail, but was follow'd by divers Boats, at which he fir'd his After-Guns with pieces of Iron and Stones, which killing some of them, made the rest return. In the midst of the Boats, which were ty'd two and two together, sat the Commander, who encourag'd the Rowers; they all us'd Clubs without Points.</P>
<P>These People were gross of Body, undaunted, strong, and of a tawny colour; the Hair of their Heads stroak'd up round, was ty'd up on their Crown, on which stuck a stiff white Feather; about their Necks hung a square Plate; they wore in stead of Cloaks, square pieces of Cloth, made fast before on their Breasts.</P>
<P><HI>Tasman,</HI> by reason of his rough Entertainment call'd this Harbor, <HI>Murderers-Bay,</HI> and afterwards Sail'd along the Shore till the fifth of <HI>January</HI> 1643. on which Day he dropt Anchor near a little Rocky Island, from which fell two Streams, with a great noise into the Sea. The Inhabitants, a strong People, beckned to the Seamen to come on Shore; some lean'd on thick Clubs, others Fenc'd one with another. <HI>Tas∣man</HI> sending his Sloop ashore for Water with two Drakes, return'd without any, not being able to Land, by reason of the hollow Sea near the Shore; wherefore Sailing from thence he discover'd two low Isles, which were full of Woods of very tall Trees; from the biggest whereof came a little Boat, sharp before and behind, in which three sallow Men, sitting behind one another, Row'd with great swift∣ness towards the <HI>Hemskerk;</HI> whereupon <HI>Tasman</HI> commanded all his Men to go un∣der the Hatches, that the three <HI>Southlanders</HI> might not be afraid to come aboard; he also threw a piece of Linnen out of his Cabbin Window, which one of them, leaping into the Sea, took up, and as a sign of thankfulness, laid the same on his Head, and being hereby emboldned, they came nearer the Rudder, where they took up a Knife, ty'd to a piece of Wood, out of the Water, and return'd the Seamen a Fishhook of Mother-of-Pearl, ty'd to a Cotton Line. Approaching the Shore, they saw abundance of People running along, with two little Flags on Sticks. Some of the Natives came in their Boats close up with <HI>Tasman</HI>'s Ship; and one more bold than the rest entring the same, was found to be a tall Man with a broad black Beard, and green Leaves about his Neck, who sat down on the Deck with his Legs under him, and bow'd down his Head oftentimes very low: <HI>Tasman</HI> re∣turning his Civility, took him by the Hand to Treat him in his Cabbin, but a
<PB N="656" REF="435"/>Dog which was in the Ship Barking, he grew fearful, and went into his Boat again. Several other <HI>Southlanders</HI> swam aboard, and others brought <HI>Pisang</HI> and <HI>Clappes</HI> in their Boats. Against the Evening a great Vessel, surrounded with lesser Boats, came Rowing towards the <HI>Hemskerk,</HI> the Men making a great noise; the Seamen fearing some Design, ran all to their Arms, but were convinc'd of their Friendship by the Gifts they Presented them with from the Governor of the Island. The next day a strange Boat came near the <HI>Sea-Cock, viz.</HI> two Sloops, which being ty'd together, and cover'd with Boards, carry'd several Men, Commanded by a Captain, by them call'd <HI>Orangkay:</HI> On the midst of the Boards which co∣ver'd the two Boats, stood a Hut made of Rushes, and cover'd over with <HI>Pisang</HI> Leaves; the Sails being made of Mats, caus'd it to Sail very swiftly. Round about this Sloop Row'd lesser Boats, out of which loud Acclamations were heard, every one crying out, <HI>Hael, Hael:</HI> during which noise, those <HI>Southlanders</HI> which were already come aboard, sat still on the Decks, which made <HI>Tasman</HI> think that their King himself was coming to give him a Visit, which accordingly fell out, for he came and Presented him with several Hogs, Poultrey, <HI>Clappes</HI> and <HI>Pisang,</HI> all cover'd with white Cloths.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Interview be∣tween <HI>Tasman</HI> and the <HI>South∣landish</HI> King.</NOTE>This <HI>Southlandish</HI> King was Habited in a Suit, the Stuff whereof resembled <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> Paper, doubled and pasted together, and was attended by a great Train of Men, Women, and Children, all of them as black as a Coal; some of them swam after, and others follow'd him in Boats.</P>
<P>These <HI>Southlanders</HI> barter'd their Clothes and Necklaces, which consisted of Mother-of-Pearl and white Cockles, and Fishhooks made also of Mother-of-Pearl, against Nails, Knives, and the like Trifles.</P>
<P><HI>Tasman</HI> caus'd a Shirt, Breeches, Doublet, and Hat, to be put on an old <HI>Orang∣kay;</HI> who being thus Cloth'd, stood a considerable time admiring of himself, and was also much wonder'd at by his Subjects; but going into the Countrey, he came back without his Clothes.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Orangkay</HI> being Presented with a Rummer of Wine, pour'd out the Wine, and setting the Rummer on his Head, went away with great joy.</P>
<P>Some of the Governors view'd the Ships, not onely above, but also below the Decks, and being brought to the Guns, they desir'd to know the use of them; whereupon one being Discharg'd, it so affrighted them, that had they not been held, they had all leap'd overboard.</P>
<P>Provisions were daily brought by the <HI>Southlanders</HI> to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in great Ves∣sels, surrounded by many lesser; still as they put their Oars into the Water, they made a hideous noise.</P>
<P><HI>Tasman</HI> bringing some empty Vessels upon the Deck, thereby to make them un∣derstand that he wanted fresh Water, the <HI>Orangkays</HI> pointed to the Shore; whither they went with two Boats, which return'd without Water, the Inhabitants them∣selves being forc'd to dig Pits to get the same.</P>
<P>Mean while other <HI>Southlanders</HI> coming aboard, the Pilot and Boatswain's Boy blow'd on their Trumpets, another play'd on a Flute, and a fourth on a Violin whilest some of the the Seamen Dancing, so amaz'd the Natives, that they stood like senseless Creature, gaping with open Mouth upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Tasman</HI> looking into a Grammar which contain'd the Language of the <HI>Solomons</HI> Isles, found that many words which were us'd by these People, had a great simi∣litude with those of that Language.</P>
<P>Besides these Men, there came likewise a great many Women aboard, all of them extraordinary tall, especially two, who might justly be stil'd Giantesses; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="657" REF="435"/>one whereof had Mustacho's; both ran, and embracing the Chirurgeon <HI>Henrick Haelbos,</HI> desir'd carnal Copulation with him, and seem'd to quarrel one with ano∣ther about him: Others confidently put their Hands into the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Breeches, their Husbands giving consent thereunto: All of them had thick, curl'd, black Hair, which they colour'd red, and comb'd with ten little round Sticks ty'd toge∣ther on the top, and left wide like Teeth at the bottom; yet some of them let their Hair hang down in long braided Locks; they shave their upper Lips, but keep a square Beard on their Chin; yet amongst the old People there were some whose Cheeks were overgrown with Hair: Their manner of shaving is with the Teeth of certain Fish made fast to a Stick; they all went bare-headed, except some few, who ty'd a square piece of Stuff, wrought of Leaves or Feathers, above their Eyes against the Sun; the upper parts of their Bodies were all naked, but about their Middle some wore a Girdle, others a Mat of <HI>Clappes</HI> Leaves, others a Cloth not unlike <HI>Chinese</HI> Paper, about the lower parts of their Bodies. The Wo∣mens Apparel differ'd little from the Mens, excepting that their Aprons reach'd farther down, <HI>viz.</HI> to their Knees. They barter'd their Clothes against Nails. Some of the <HI>Orangkays,</HI> being Entertain'd in the Cabbin, wonder'd to see a Bullet that was Discharg'd from the Quarter-deck, fall into the Water at so great a distance. They wore about their Necks Mother-of-Pearl, white Cockles, sweet-smelling Flowers, green Leaves, or the Nails which they had gotten of the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> Some of the aged Women wanted both their little Fingers, and the young ones the upper Joynts of them, which the old Men also wanted: <HI>Haelbos</HI> pointing at the Stump, ask'd the reason of it, but one of them laying his Hand under his Chin, made strange Signs, out of which he could apprehend nothing.</P>
<P>On the twenty third of <HI>January,</HI> a second time <HI>Tasman</HI> went ashore for Water, carrying Spades and Pick-axes with him, to dig Pits with. Two of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Boats going close together, in each of which were three <HI>Southlanders, Tasman</HI> call'd to his Rowers to pull stoutly; which the <HI>Southlanders</HI> in <HI>Tasman</HI>'s Boat observing to tend to their Rowing the swifter, laugh'd and hooted at their Countrey-men that were in the <HI>Sea-Cocks</HI> Boat, when they chanc'd to get beyond them. <HI>Tasman</HI> in his going ashore discover'd several Isles at a distance, was kindly Entertain'd, and towards the Evening carry'd by four Men through the Water, on a Mat made fast betwixt two Poles, to his Sloop, whither they also brought nine Hogs, and fresh Water digg'd out of Pits.</P>
<P><HI>Tasman</HI> being got about the Point of the Island, saw the <HI>Hemskerk</HI> under Sail; wherefore Rowing aboard the <HI>Sea-Cock,</HI> he was inform'd that she had slipt her An∣chor; whereupon following her, he got sight of another green Island the next day, along the Shore whereof ran several People with Sticks, on which hung white Cloths: some of them came aboard, and brought with them what Provisions the Island afforded. The Inhabitants barter'd <HI>Clappes, Pisang,</HI> Fowls, Hogs, Mother-of-Pearl Fish-hooks, Stone Axes, little Stools, great Clubs, with a black Point as long as a Man's Arm, and hooked, against Trifles. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were also stor'd here with fresh Water. The People both in Language, Habit, rud Customs, were very like those of the first Island, but were not altogether so courteous. One of the <HI>Southlanders</HI> stealing a Half-pike out of the Boat was forc'd by his Companions to restore the same.</P>
<P>The fore-mention'd <HI>Haelbos</HI> relates, That going ashore with some Soldiers, he saw their Houses, which he found to be built after a strange manner, <HI>viz.</HI> some of them were round like Towers, Wider at top than at bottom, and without any Holes for Air, but all built close of Canes, which were stuck in the Ground; other
<PB N="658" REF="436"/>Huts were cover'd with a long Roof of <HI>Pisang</HI> or <HI>Clappes</HI> Leaves, resting on Posts; under which kind of Building <HI>Haelbos</HI> shelter'd himself against a mighty Shower of Rain, found divers young Men and Women sitting on Mats, and an old Woman, blind through Age, lying by them on the Ground, and Fanning her self with <HI>Pi∣sang</HI> Leaves: The Men going away, signifi'd thereby a kind of Invitation to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to go to the Women, who not receiving the Entertainment they ex∣pected, rose altogether on a sudden, and Singing, Danc'd about the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> The Men had on their Shoulders and Breasts, Scars of half an Inch deep, and an Inch long; upon some of which, being fresh and bleeding, the Flyes sat. They eat after a strange manner, for stripping off the outmost Rinds of the <HI>Clappes</HI> with their Teeth, and breaking the hard Shell against their Elbows, they pull out the Kernel, and eat the same. Whatever Flesh-meat they eat, they never throughly boyl or roast it, but make it onely just warm. They sleep on the Ground upon Mats, and lay their Heads on a little woodden Cricket with four Feet. They take great pride in their Hair, and those that have not long Hair of their own, use Perukes.</P>
<P><HI>Tasman</HI> steering his Course towards the high Coast that lay before this Island, was follow'd by several small Vessels from the adjacent Shore, of which some car∣ry'd a Bough of <HI>Clappes</HI> or <HI>Pisang,</HI> with white Veins at the ends; but seeing the Ships Sail from them, they threw the same overboard. <HI>Tasman</HI> standing Westerly, discover'd three Isles, near the last whereof the Sea broke exceedingly, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> not without great danger had approached in the Night: after which they discover'd to Leeward of them, a high Coast, which extended it self a great way, but the Sea went so rough, that they durst not venture near the Land; be∣sides, the Sea went very high on a Bank, first ten, then five, three and a half, and again ten, fourteen, and seven Fathom deep; and oftentimes a Man might see the Ground, insomuch that they kept out the Boats belonging to the <HI>Hemskerk,</HI> which was in most danger, to carry them aboard of the <HI>Sea-Cock,</HI> if the first should chance to split. Lastly, getting over the Bank, they saw very high Land to Windward, and many hilly Isles to Leeward; the Sea also was full of blind Rocks and Shelves, so that they were in danger every hour, and the rather, because the Wind blew hard every day; yet at last losing sight of Land, they steer'd their Course Westerly in five Degrees Southward of the <HI>Line,</HI> towards <HI>New Guinee.</HI> On the two and twentieth of <HI>March</HI> they discover'd low Land full of Woods of tall Trees, sur∣rounded with a company of Isles, against some of which the Sea brake with great violence, insomuch that they were again in great danger, especially when they were got amongst eighteen Isles, between which the Water being shallow, and the Current running very strongly, drove the Ships towards the Shore: Whilest they were Tacking to and again to get beyond the Shelves, a little Vessel, carrying a great Weather-cock on her Star-board, came from the Shore, Row'd by seven Men, who sat on Boards which lay over the same; they were of a brown Complexion, onely girt about with a hairy Girdle, made fast on the top of their Heads; under their Feet they also wore something in stead of Shoes, about their Necks hung Flowers, and their Bodies were Painted black: Among the seven, one who was very fat, and whose Head was adorn'd with two Feathers, stood up and proffer'd the Seamen two <HI>Clappes,</HI> in return whereof <HI>Tasman</HI> gave them a Box of Nails and a piece of Sail-cloth, which sinking under Water, an aged Man div'd for the same, and bringing it up, gave it to his six Companions, who made no shew of thank∣fulness. Their Arms consisted in Bowes and Arrows. Their <HI>Clappes</HI> they call'd <HI>Anieuw,</HI> as the other Islanders had done.</P>
<PB N="659" REF="436"/>
<P>Sailing from hence, they discover'd two low Islands full of Trees; and three Leagues from them, on their Star-board, a high Coast, and on the other side a great Island, whither they drove with a small Gale; approaching the same, two very small Boats came towards the <HI>Hemskerk;</HI> the biggest of the two carry'd six Men, and the least three, all of them very deform'd; they went stark naked, onely their Yards were ty'd up with a String on their Bellies, and about their Arms hung Chains of Mother-of-Pearl; they were Coal-black, onely red about the Mouth, which redness was occasion'd by the chewing of <HI>Pisang;</HI> in their Hair stuck wood∣den Combs, and on their Foreheads green Leaves; but in each Boat was one who had a bruised Reed made fast in his Neck like a Plume; the biggest Vessel was Painted with strange Shapes of Men and Beasts; they us'd red Bowes and Ar∣rows, and having call'd to the Seamen, they Row'd back again to the Shore; which <HI>Tasman</HI> left a Stern of him▪ and ran between the Main Coast (by all suppos'd to be <HI>New Guinee</HI>) and several great Islands, that lay scatter'd along before the Main Coast; from whence came four small Boats, adorn'd with Imagery like Serpents, but kept without Gun-shot from the Ships; at last one leaping overboard, swam to the smallest Boat, out of which one swam back in his stead to the other, and after∣wards came to the <HI>Hemskerks</HI> side; he was a black Man, wore Leaves before his Privities, and Armlets about his Elbows; through the Gristle of his Nose stuck a white Bone Bodkin, sharp at the ends, and of a Fingers length, and about his Neck a String full of Cockle-shells.</P>
<P><HI>Tasman</HI> Sailing on along the Main Coast, met with eighteen Boats more, the Rowers whereof laid their Oars upon their Heads, and not without strange Ge∣stures call'd aloud, and invited the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to come ashore: On the Sterns and Heads of these Boats were likewise divers Shapes Painted, upon a white Ground; in some were two, and in others three, four, and five Men; eight of them going into the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Boats, were made Drunk with <HI>Arrack.</HI> These <HI>Southlanders</HI> went stark naked, some onely covering their secret Parts with Leaves; their Skins were black, onely on their Foreheads they drew a red Stroke, which reach'd to their Ears; their brown curl'd Hair was by some colour'd grey, by some red, some let it hang loose over their Sholdiers, others ty'd the same in a Tuft on their Crown, cover'd with a Cap of <HI>Pisang</HI> Leaves, others wore their Hair scarce two Fingers long, and through the Gristle of their Nose, a piece of Cane or Quill, and a broad Beard without Mustacho's; they had nothing to barter but large Snail-shells, on which they made a strange noise; and whatsoe're they receiv'd, they first smell'd on it like Dogs: they fancy'd not Nails, as all the other <HI>Southlanders</HI> had done. Their manner of Fishing was thus: They ty'd several half <HI>Clappes</HI>-shells, made fast like a Chain, to a long Reed, shook the same to and again on the Water, to ga∣ther the Fish together. In the Boats lay Planks of an oval fashion, which by Ropes ty'd in the middle they held before them in stead of Shields. When these <HI>South∣landers</HI> went from the Ships, one of them threatned to beat the Seamen, shaking his great Club at them; whereupon they all Row'd with great speed to the Shore, whilest one in every Boat knockt with a Staff against the sides, just as if they had beat an Alarm. Amongst them one had barter'd for an old Doublet, with which he shew'd many antick Tricks, putting it on the wrong way, sometimes on his Head, then his Feet into the two Arm-holes, and anon the Button-holes behind on his Back.</P>
<P>The Ships Sailing from hence, ran along a broken Coast, and on the twelfth of <HI>April</HI> were so terribly shaken by an Earthquake, which lasted an hour and a half, that they seem'd shivering to pieces in the Water, as if they had ran against a
<PB N="660" REF="437"/>Rock, notwithstanding they could not fathom Ground with their longest Line. Somewhat farther they discover'd a burning Mountain on an Island, between which and the Main (on which stood also a very high Mountain) they steering their Course, came into a white Water, mov'd by a strong River from the Continent; and coming to an Anchor before the Island <HI>Jamna,</HI> they saw the Isles <HI>Moa</HI> and <HI>Ari∣moa</HI> before them. The <HI>Jamneans</HI> calling <HI>New Guinee</HI> by the Name of <HI>Belah,</HI> inform'd the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that they Warr'd continually with the Inhabitants thereof. These People being also Coal-black, some of them had loose curl'd Hair, hanging down over their Shoulders in long Braids, and others had onely two thick Locks, which cover'd their Ears; all of them wore four Feathers on their Heads: the Men pull'd out their Beards, and hung a great Bone Ring through their Ears, at which also hung a Shell like a Spur; most of them had red Roses ty'd about their Heads, and a Necklace of Hogs Teeth about their Necks; under their Navels they wore Gir∣dles, a handful and a half broad, and about their Wastes Strings full of Shells, or Sea-Cockles, to which a small Lappet was ty'd, and hung down before their Pri∣vities; but because it was but two Fingers broad, and moy'd to an again by the Wind, their Nakedness appear'd to those that took notice thereof; through the Gristle of their Noses they wore a Hogs Tooth, or the Splinter of a Cane. Upon the Stern of their small Boats was the Shape of a little Lyon.

These People were of a sallow Complexion; they broke their Arrows with great Ceremony; for first they pointed with them towards the Skie, then put them into the Water, and breaking each Arrow in two pieces on their Heads, they threw one over the Larboard, and the other over the Starboard; he that broke the Arrow, made a long Speech to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who took the same for an Oath of their Fidelity toward them. In every one of these Boats were twenty eight or thirty Men.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and first Discove∣ry of <HI>Iseland.</HI></NOTE><HI>Iseland,</HI> so call'd from the continual Ice which is upon it, is a craggy mountain∣ous Countrey; and not onely the Hills, but a great part of the Low-land cover'd with perpetual Snow: It is of a Form somewhat oblong, lying between the fifty fourth and fifty ninth Degree of Northern Latitude, having <HI>Norway</HI> on the East, the <HI>Orcades</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> on the South, <HI>Grenland</HI> on the West, and the <HI>Hyperborean,</HI> or frozen Sea on the North. It is by <HI>Olaus Magnus</HI> suppos'd to be twice as big as <HI>Sicily,</HI> that is to say, about a hundred Leagues in length. It is the most known, and most througly discover'd of all the Countreys of the <HI>Artick Region,</HI> and is said to have been first found out and peopled in the Year of our Lord 900. by certain of the Nobility of <HI>East-Frisia</HI> in the Countrey of <HI>Breme,</HI> in the time of <HI>Alebrand,</HI> Bishop of that Coun∣trey; but whether or no utterly unpeopled till that time, is a Question not easie to be determin'd, though in all probability so obvious a Place to be found out, could not lie so long totally uninhabited. Not long after several Colonies of <HI>Norwegians</HI> Setled themselves, some in <HI>Hitland,</HI> some in <HI>Ferow,</HI> others (following the Example of these <HI>Bremers</HI>) in <HI>Iseland.</HI> The Countrey is full of Rocks and Stones, and (as is credibly reported) not a cultivated Field or Garden in the whole Island, and by consequence no sort of Corn, yet the People living without either Bread or Salt, are very strong, and of a good Complexion: Neither is there a Tree to be seen, except the Birch, which likewise grows but in one place, and exceeds not the heighth of a Man, by reason of the violence of the Winds; yet there is said to be great plenty of Butter, the Grass being so fat, that the Oxen are not suffer'd to stay long at a time in the Pastures for fear of bursting. Till of late there was neither Town, nor any thing that could be call'd a Village, in the whole Island, but stragling Cottages here and there, not above three or four together in a place, most by the Sea side for the convenience of Fishing; they were built pretty deep in the Ground, but artificially fram'd of Whales Bones, with Seats, Benches, and other Utensils of the same; now sometimes they use Fir to the same purpose, which is cast upon the Coast by the force of the Sea from <HI>Tartary</HI> or elsewhere. For want of Vessels, they lay their Butter in Heaps in the Corners of their Houses like Mor∣tar. In the Winter, wanting Fodder, they feed their Cattel with Fish. Besides these Cattel, which are Kine without Horns, Horses onely fit for carrying of Burthens, and very large Sheep, there are store of white Foxes, and huge Bears of the same colour, and a sort of rough Dogs, very well known, and frequent amongst us by the Name of <HI>Shocks,</HI> which the Islanders esteem not a little, and will part with their Children at a far easier rate: They keep neither Hogs nor Poultrey, for want of Grain to feed them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Rivers in <HI>Iseland.</HI></NOTE>The Rivers belonging to this Island are many, and those not unpleasant, afford∣ing to the Inhabitants plenty of Fish, especially Sturgeon, Trouts, and Salmons; and one is especially remarkable for a Bridge made over it, which being the onely Bridge of the Countrey, is made of the great Bones of a Whale. The whole Island is one continu'd Desart, without any trodden Path or Road from one end to the other; so that all that have occasion to travel to any part thereof by Land, make use of the Compass, as if they were Voyaging by Sea.</P>

<P>The next is the <HI>Hackfall,</HI> which is very fat, and about twelve Inches long.</P>
<P>Then the Dog-Fish, which lifting up its Head out of the Sea, Barks, and letting forth its young ones, receives them into her Belly again, when they have sported a while in the Sea.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Foun∣tains.</NOTE>In divers parts of the Island are Fountains of scalding Water, which as soon as taken from the Fountain begins to cool, and when cold, hath a sulphury Substance swimming on the top.</P>

<P>At the place upon the Sea call'd <HI>Turlocks Haven,</HI> are two Fountains of different quality, the one hot, the other cold, which by Pipes being brought together into one place, make a Bath of an excellent temperature, and of a medicinal Vertue.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Haven Halneford</HI> is a Cliff in a Rock of an unknown depth, and no Water to be discern'd by those that look down into it, but if a Stone be cast in, it shall make a noise for half an hour together, as if it were striking against a Brazen Vessel, and all this while the Water will be rising till it comes up to the brim, and then will be so long sinking again as the Stone was falling.</P>

<P>Not to insist upon the fabulous Stories of King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s first conquering <HI>Ireland,</HI> and then Sailing into the Northern Seas, and subduing <HI>Scantia, Iseland, Groenland,</HI> and (as the Story saith) many other Islands beyond <HI>Norway</HI> even under the <HI>Pole,</HI> or of <HI>Malgo</HI>'s subduing <HI>Ireland, Iseland,</HI> the <HI>Orcades</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> or <HI>Octher</HI>'s Reports to King <HI>Alfred</HI> of his Voyages to the North-East parts beyond <HI>Norway,</HI> or the Voya∣ges of the two famous <HI>Venetian</HI> Brethren, <HI>Nicolo</HI> and <HI>Antonio Zeni,</HI> or of <HI>Marcus Pau∣lus Venetus, Odoricus</HI> and <HI>Vertomannus;</HI> the first <HI>English</HI>-man we hear of, that made an Expedition into those Northern Seas, was Sir <HI>Hugh Willoughby,</HI> before taken notice of for the Discovery of <HI>King James's Newland</HI> and <HI>Willoughby-Island,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1553.</P>
<P><HI>Stephen Burroughs</HI> (as hath been intimated) discover'd amongst other Places, about the Year 1556. the <HI>Straight</HI> of <HI>Vaigats.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1576. Sir <HI>Martin Forbisher</HI> setting forth with two Barques, after he had been out about five Weeks, had sight of a High-land, which he nam'd <HI>Queen Elizabeths Foreland:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen Eliza∣beths Foreland</NOTE> Thence Sailing more Northerly to the heighth of about sixty two Degrees, he descry'd a great Sea or Inlet, which he entred, and thence it took the Appellation of <HI>Forbisher's Straight.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Forbister's Straight.</NOTE> About two years after proceeding to a farther discovery of it, he entred a good way into it, and took possession of the utmost Place he went to for Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who thereupon gave it the Name of <HI>Meta Incognita.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1580. <HI>Arthur Pett</HI> and <HI>Charles Jackman</HI> were sent out by the <HI>Russian</HI> Company, to make a Discovery of the River <HI>Ob,</HI> and passing the <HI>Straight</HI> of <HI>Waigats,</HI> took par∣ticular observation of the Islands and Places there, but not being able to pass much farther, by reason of the Ice, towards the latter end of the year they return'd.</P>
<P>In prosecution of this Discovery to the North-West, Captain <HI>John Davis</HI> of <HI>San∣druge</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> made three Voyages; his first <HI>Anno</HI> 1585. his second, 1587. in which he met with many strange Adventures; but the main thing that accru'd
<PB N="673" REF="443"/>from these Voyages, was finding of a mighty Through-let between vast and desart Islands, to which his Name gave the Appellation of <HI>Fretum Davis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Davis's Straight.</NOTE> or <HI>Davis's Straight.</HI></P>
<P>The next that went upon this Design was Captain <HI>George Weymouth,</HI> who from the Year 1585 to 1602 made several Expeditions, which produc'd large Relations of strange Accidents that befell them, but little of Discovery farther than what had been made before.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James Hall,</HI> very noted for his Voyages to <HI>Groenland,</HI> (which before was by Captain <HI>Davis</HI> call'd <HI>Desolation</HI>) at his falling in with that Place nam'd a Head-land from then King of <HI>Denmark, Cape Christianus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Christia∣nus.</NOTE> which some think to be no other than <HI>Cape Farewel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1606. Mr. <HI>John Knight</HI> was set out by the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> of the Passages of whose Voyage little or nothing memorable is recorded.</P>
<P>The next and most famous Attempter in the discovery of the <HI>North-Wast Passage,</HI> was <HI>Henry Hudson,</HI> who is said to have discover'd farther Northward to the <HI>Pole</HI> than any before him. From the Year 1607 to 1610 he made several Voyages, be∣ing set out by Sir <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Wostenholm,</HI> with others that were his great Friends, and Advancers of such publick Designs. In his last Voyage the Isles of <HI>Gods Mercy, Prince Henry's Foreland, King James's Cape, Queen Annes Cape, Digg's Island, Cape Wostenholm, The King's Foreland, Mount Charles, Cape Salisbury,</HI> &amp;c. were first taken notice of and nam'd, and, which were his princi∣pal Discoveries, and therefore worthily retaining his Name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hudson's Straight and Bay.</NOTE> <HI>Hudson's Straight and Bay;</HI> but in his return homeward he was set upon in his Cabbin by one <HI>Green, Wil∣son,</HI> and others of their Conspiracy, and together with his Son <HI>John Hudson, Tho. Widdows. Arn. Ludlow, Sidrach Faner,</HI> and two or three more, was put over into a small Shallop, in which they were forc'd to seek their Fortune, and in all likeli∣hood perish'd, for they were never heard of after. Nor long after <HI>Green</HI> going on Shore upon a strange Island, was shot from an Ambuscade of Salvages into the Heart; the like End has <HI>Wilson,</HI> and three more of the Conspirators dy'd of their mortal Wounds, the rest with much ado got home in a very sick and weak Condi∣tion, through the Hardships the had sustain'd, and want of Provisions.</P>
<P>There was also another <HI>Hudson,</HI> who <HI>Anno</HI> 1608. went to the height of eighty one Degrees, and gave Names to certain Places, which continue to this day, as <HI>Whale-Bay, Hackluit's Headland,</HI> and <HI>Hudson's Touches.</HI></P>
<P>By the Assistance of Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> and those other Noble Persons above men∣tion'd, Captain <HI>Thomas Button</HI> set out in the Year 1612. and is said to have pass'd <HI>Hudson's Straight,</HI> and leaving <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> to the South, to have Sail'd two hundred Leagues South-Westward over a Sea above eighty Fathoms deep, which at length he discover'd to be another great Bay, since call'd <HI>Button's Bay:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Button's Bay.</NOTE> He is said also to have discover'd a great Continent, which he call'd <HI>New Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Several other Voyagers there were in this great Attempt of the <HI>North-West Pas∣sage,</HI> as Captain <HI>Gibbons, Robert Bylot, William Baffins,</HI> and Captain <HI>William Hawkridge,</HI> who though they all came short of the main Enterprize, yet every one found out some new Cape, Bay, or Promontory, or open'd a farther Passage than had been before, as <HI>Bylot</HI> made known <HI>Cape Comfort; Baffin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baffin's Bay.</NOTE> the Inlet call'd from him <HI>Baffins Bay,</HI> as also Sir <HI>James Lancaster's Sound; Hawkridge,</HI> a farther Passage into <HI>Lumly's</HI> Inlet.</P>
<P>From the Year 1616. to 1631. the Business slept, and then a Voyage was under∣taken by Captain <HI>Luke Fox,</HI> who at his Return gave very good hopes and encou∣ragement, that the Work, so long in prosecution, was not impossible to effected; nevertheless, by reason of the late troublesom Times i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wholy laid
<PB N="674" REF="444"/>aside for almost forty years; but in the Year 1668. several Persons of Honor un∣dertook to revive the Work, and to that purpose furnish'd out two Ships, which set forth in <HI>June,</HI> and return'd about the beginning of <HI>October</HI> the Year following, giving so satisfactory an Account of their Voyage, that in the Year 1670. the same Adventurers thought fit to send out two Ships more, so furnish'd, as to endure a Wintering there, which they did, with greater hopes than ever of finding out the <HI>North-West Passage,</HI> besides a handsom Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go of rich Furrs, which made it more than a saving Voyage; so that 'tis suppos'd this will not be the last Attempt, but that another will suddenly follow. And it may well be observ'd, that nothing considerable hath been done, in this grand Enterprize, but by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
