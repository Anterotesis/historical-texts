<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Cardinall Archduke which is yet at Bruxels, hath (as it is reported) assem∣bled about 5000. men neere Calice and those parts to spoile the country, and it is thought likewise that in the end of this moneth himselfe will take the field with 6000. fighting men to attempt some∣what against the towne of Ostend whe∣ther the states haue sent fiue other ensignes of footemen for the farther strengthning of that garrison.</P>
<P>The states had of late intended to surprise Graueling: but the practise being discouered, their men returned without perfour∣ming any thing.</P>
<P>The Frenchmen encreasing still in power make towardes A∣miens whereinto there is entred a certaine number of horse and the said Frenchmen inuading the country of Luxembrough, did on a sodaine surprize the towne of Iunix, which after they had sackt they set on fire, and thence marcht towards Lafertei, where not being able to effect their purpose, they roue vp and downe the prouince, doing euery where great hurte. For which cause the Cardinall hath sent thither Colonel Berlotta with other Cap∣taines to withstand the French, who seeke by such attemptes to crosse and hinder his proceedings.</P>
<P>We are aduertised here by letters from Holland, of the arri∣uall there of sundry ships laden with diuers merchandizes, and store of ready money, who report that the Englishmen hauing ta∣ken and sakt the Port of Saint Martin, did afterward set it on fire with all the shippes within the harbour.</P>
<P>On sunday the bodies of Saint Flauia Domicila and of S. Hereo and Archileo Romanes, were remoued from the Church of S. Adrian to their owne Church, which is the title of Cardinal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ronio.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<P>On munday a counsell was called at Montecauallo, wherein the Archmadrite of Messina was bestowed on a Sicilian. The Archbishop of Roan receiued his pall, and Cardinall Farnese propounded a monasterye in the Kingdome of Arragon in Spaine.</P>
<P>On Tuseday the Cardinall Marc Antonio Colona departed this life, leauing for heire of all goods, the Lord Martio Colona his nephue.</P>
<P>On wendsday towards euening the Cardinall Cesis &amp; Mon∣signor Bonuisi gaue commaundement to the Captaines which were appointed for Hungary, that on munday next they shoulde cause their souldiers to depart; whereupon certaine companies did yesterday set forward, and the said Bonnisi who doth like∣wise to morrow take his iourney, hath already sent his comissary to make prouision for the voyage.</P>
<P>The Spanish Agentes heere are aduertised by letters from Praghe, that the Admirall of Arragon hath published in that court by order of the Catholike King, that the Lady Infant of Spaine was maried to the Cardinall Archduke, and that the Emperour will resigne the kingdome of Bohemia vnto him, as also that he shalbe made king of Romanes, which is as much to say as heire and successor in the Empire. Otherwise the Catho∣like Maiesty will not giue him any state lest he should diminish the Crowne of Spaine, vnlesse perhaps he bestow on him the Dutchy of Brittaine hauing recouered it from the French, as a thing belonging to the Lady Infants mother. That the Cardi∣nall shall resigne the Archbishopricke of Toledo to Archduke Maximilian one of the brethren of the Prince of Spaines bride which shalbe. Who (as it is reported) must be conueied to her husband in October next: vpon the publishing whereof the Em∣bassadors of Venice, the great Duke, and Savoy did in their princes names visite and gratulate the catholike kings ambas∣sador.</P>
<P>It is likewise reported, that the prince Doria his iorney into Spaine, is to fetch the Kings daughter, and conuey her into I∣taly, whence she shalbe accompanied into Flanders by the count
<PB N="5" REF="3"/> of Fuentes, who hath order to conduct her to the cardinal Arch∣duke.</P>
<P>The other night there were sent from hence two Dispensati∣ons into spaine, the one whereby the kings daughter may take to husband the cardinall, the other that the prince may take to wife her that is betrothed vnto him, who shal this summer be conueied to Barcellona by the prince Doria in his gally royall with other gallies to the number of 30. whither the said prince will come to receiue her.</P>
<P>The great duke vnderstanding that the catholike King wan∣ted powder and other munition wherewith to furnish his towns on the sea coast of spaine and Portugall, especially at this time, because he feares they shalbe assaulted by the English fleete, his highnesse did therefore cause a ship to be laden with 20000. bar¦rels of powder and other munition, which he sent into Spaine for a present to the catholike maiestie: but the Florentines say that hee sent the saide munition, to haue therefore so much corne graine. And the Iesuites which are lately come, reporte for a certainetie, that the saide ship is long since arriued at Alli∣cante.</P>
<P>They write from Naples, that the viceroy hath built 4. new gallies, wherewith, togither with other shippes he purposeth to imbarke and carry into Spaine the third part of the footmen that were leuied in that kingdome, and there should be leuied another third vnder the conduct of the marques of Treuiso.</P>
<P>They write from Florence, that the fort of Casteldit ouer-a∣gainst Marsiglia, holdes for the great Dutchesse in the French kings name, because the said fort was taken by the souldiers of the other fortresse belowe which are kept there at the saide great duchesse cost, by whose order the ambassadour of Tuscane con∣ferring with him of France on tuesday, told him that whatsoeuer was done herein, was for the seruice of the most christian maie∣stie, and by the Duke of Guise his consent, which, perceiuing that the captaine of the said place had inteligence with the prince Doria sent post for him to Marsiglia, that the souldiers might the more easily atchieue their enterprise.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P>On thurseday the ambassadors of Venice and of the great D. were together with the Catholike Kings Agent by the space of foure houres in a chamber locked vnto them, but it is not known what or whereon they treated.</P>
<P>Here are news of the archbishop of Siena his death, who de∣ceased in his owne church, which place (it is thought) shall bee giuen to the cardinall Taruggi.</P>

<P>The Cardinall Archduke doth what hee can to put an armie into the field; but through want of mony his purpose goes slow∣ly forward: neither is it yet knowne what enterprise the Spani∣ards will make, sith the troups which were sent forth, are retur∣ned vnto their garrisons, which moueth some to thinke that they will onely strengthen and furnish the frontier-townes.</P>
<P>The forces which his highnesse sent to succour Amiens, haue done nothing, because they were not strong enough to withstand the French, who haue entrenched themselues not farre from the army where they remain, keeping good watch, and the Spanish horsemen in Arras appoynted to succour Amiens, can finde no meanes to enter the towne, sith all the passages are stopt, and the souldiers within the towne reposed small confidence in the Burgesses, who begin to grow weary of perfourming the duetie of souldiers.</P>
<P>The French men in the countrie of Luxembrough vnder the D. of Niuers do watch their opportunitie to worke, some spoile (and as the voice goeth) they will lay siege to Harlam, not farre from Bastague, if they be not preuented by colonell Berlotta, whome his highnesse hath sent into those partes,</P>

<P>They write from Naples that the gallies of Sicilie brought eight great canons from Palermo, which (as it is thought) shal be imployed in some attempt. That sixe miles from the hauen a ship laden with corne belonging to the Centurion of Genoa, was cast away, and therewith 100. marriners, 70. souldiers. That the 8000. footemen which were leuied in that kingdome, shall meete neare to the said cittie to be imbarked in twenty gal∣lies; and certaine ships and vessels which were made ready: and that there was order giuen for the leuying of more men in the saide kingdome.

<P>On saturday there came a post vnto the Pope, sent to him from the cardinall Taruggi with newes, that hee had laboured and concluded a peace betweene the Dukes of Mantua and Parma: and therefore (say they) that these two princes wil per∣sonally meete each other at Rlegio in Lombardy where the said Cardinall, and the most excellent duke of Ferrara will bee
<PB N="8" REF="5"/> present: which newes hath caused maruellous great ioy in this court.</P>
<P>On Sunday there was an abiuration of twelue men, whome they called heretikes, in S. Mineruaes church, where many car∣dinalles were present: and it is reported, that of these twelue, three shall suffer death, of which one is a Florentine of the stocke of the Duzzi, who because he is constant in his opinion, shall be burned aliue, the other two first putte to death, and then burnt, the rest condemned, some to the gallies, some to prison.</P>
<P>By letters from Spaine bearing date the <HI>24.</HI> of April, and of the third of this present month, we are aduertized that the agree∣ment of the merchants was accorded on, because the king will giue the saide merchants very good assignements after the rate of ten and an halfe <HI>pro cento</HI> for the olde parcell, and touching the new, he will pay them the one halfe presently in ready mony, and for the rest will giue very good assignes.

<P>They write from <HI>Alba-Iulia</HI> the 14. of Aprill, that the two <HI>Ghraussi</HI> which were sent from the great Turke, to the Prince, were dispatched back againe by his Highnesse, who sent with them a Gentleman of his Court, on what affaires it is not knowne. That the Turkes haue built a Bridge on the Riuer of <HI>Danuby,</HI> wherevpon some great hurte is doubted. There was likewise reporte of a mightie Tur∣kish armie setting forwarde, whereof his Highnesse did speedily aduertise the Emperor, counselling him to prepare for warre with all expedition.</P>
<P>They write also from <HI>Vienna</HI> on the tenth of the same moneth, that there was made prouision for warre, but not so throughly as were requisite. That they fortified certaine Bastions there, the voyce still holding, that the Gardens and houses neere the walles should be throwne downe, and the Trenches enlarged. That 170. footemen of <HI>Strigonia</HI> being all Wallons and Italians, put to flight 1500. Tur∣kish Horssemen in the Isle of <HI>Strigonia,</HI> of which number none escaped, the most parte perished in the water, which séemeth miraculous. That the Boores were still executed, and a hundreth more of them brought to <HI>Vienna,</HI> amongst whom were some of the chiefe.</P>
<P>They write from <HI>Craconia</HI> the third of this present mo∣neth,
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> that the Palatine of <HI>Chionia</HI> did still persist in his contumacie, leauing Souldiers, and preparing for warre of his owne authoritie: whereby the King shall be con∣strained to vse force against him, which may bréede some greater matter, but there is hope that the Estates will be mediators betwéene them for the preuenting of farther troubles. And there is no farther talke of his Maiesties iourney into <HI>Suetia,</HI> since the Palatine of <HI>Vilnas</HI> answere at the Parliament, to his Commissioners.</P>
<P>There are more certaine newes by letters from <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> that <HI>Cicala</HI> was not called backe vnto <HI>Porte.</HI> But contrariwise that the great Turke hath appointed him to tarrie still at <HI>Argyrore,</HI> towardes which place a cer∣taine number of Souldiers was to be sent to renew and strengthen the garrisons of those frontiers. The Persian hauing in vaine demaunded restitution of certaine For∣tresses, according to promisse made in the articles of the peace: and therefore the voyce held, that he purposed to take armes against the said <HI>gran Sinior</HI> the great Turke, which entended not to make any restitution at all. And that <HI>Mahomet Bassa</HI> was made Captaine generall of the armie in Hungarie.</P>
<P>There are newes from <HI>Turin</HI> by Letters, of the first of this present moneth, that the Duke of <HI>Sauoye</HI> made pre∣paration to passe the Mountaines, so soone as <HI>Mendoza</HI> Captaine of the Horsemen of <HI>Millaine</HI> should ioyne with him, and hath in the meane time sent a Garrison to <HI>Susa San Genis,</HI> (which is not taken by <HI>Digniere,</HI> as it was re∣ported) and to other places.

<P>There are farther newes brought from <HI>Vienna,</HI> that the aforesaid ouerthrow of the Turkes at <HI>Srigonia,</HI> hath much
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> encouraged the inhabitants both of the vpper and lower <HI>Hungarie,</HI> which offer themselues with all readinesse to performe their vttermost against the common enemie.

<P>But others affirme, that there is a treatie of peace, and that the Prince of <HI>Transiluania</HI> will be a mediator betwéen them, which séemes to many a thing very vnlikely.</P>
<P>For so much as is yet knowne, the controuersies be∣tweene the Dukes of <HI>Parma</HI> and <HI>Mantua</HI> are very well de∣termined, and through the diligence of Cardinall <HI>Taruggi,</HI> and the great wisdome of the most excellent Duke of <HI>Fer∣rara.</HI></P>

<P>THey write from <HI>Genoa</HI> the seuentéenth of this present moneth of the arriual there of Signor <HI>Francesco de
<PB N="14" REF="9"/> Vera</HI> a Spaniard, and of the Senator <HI>Maionoldi</HI> of <HI>Mil∣lane,</HI> which is now made Regent of that Citie in <HI>Spaine,</HI> in the place of <HI>Brugnolo,</HI> who is chosen President of the Counsell of <HI>Millane,</HI> as also of the arriual of the Comen∣dator <HI>Tomaso Tomasi</HI> the Duke of <HI>Parmas</HI> Ambassador, all which purpose to passe into <HI>Spain</HI> with the Prince <HI>Do∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia,</HI> who hath licence from the Senate, and is gone to∣wardes <HI>poglio</HI> and <HI>Loano,</HI> whence on munday next hee will depart, there being already twelue Gallies sent to the foorde to take in the footmen.</P>
<P>There were newes from <HI>Cremoua,</HI> that they vnder∣stood by letters from <HI>Millane,</HI> where there arriued a poste from <HI>Lyons,</HI> that the Spaniardes haue taken the towne of <HI>Masiers</HI> in <HI>Champaigne.</HI> But small credite is giuen to these newes, sith the last letters from <HI>Millane</HI> doe menci∣no such matter.</P>

<P>That there is a woonderfull scarcitie, especiallie of beastes.</P>
<P>That there are sundrie spéeches and opinions touching the Armie, some supposing that onlie some fewe Gallies shall be sent foorth: But if certaine articles betweene the grande Signor and the King of <HI>France</HI> were agreed on, that then his Highnesse would send 70. or 80. Gallies to his ayde.</P>
<P>That the report of the Catholique Kinges procéedinges
<PB N="15" REF="9"/> in preiudice of the French kings Maiestie, was much displeasant, and that the great Turke was desirous that the most Christian King should accept the capitulations offered, that he might afterward send foorth a Fleet of 150 Sayles to hurt &amp; spoyle the Catholique King by al meanes possible. That vpon <HI>Cycalas</HI> comming the great Turke would go to <HI>Adrinopoli</HI> to encourage his people, being en∣forced to drawe them foorth by wonderful threates, they were so dismayed, fearing some greater losse then they had sustained the yeare before. And that to make them be∣leeue that he means to take the field, the Standerd which is woont to be borne before him was again displayd. That the <HI>Mulsti</HI> and other <HI>Papassi</HI> consulting togither, had plain∣lie tolde the grand Signor, that he shoulde not suffer him∣selfe to be ruled by the Sultan which were herewith much offended.</P>

That the Turkes of <HI>Papa. Vesprino. Palotta. S.

That the <HI>Transylvanian</HI> hath ouer∣thrwn sixteen thousand Turks and Tartars of <HI>Valachia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia.</HI></P>
<P>They write from <HI>Turin</HI> of <HI>Mendozzas</HI> arriuall which offered great ayde to the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> if the Frenchmen
<PB N="16" REF="10"/> should stirre. That it was againe reported how the saide Gouernour of <HI>Mēz</HI> had intelligence with the Cardinall Archduk, the said Gouernor being somewhat suspected by the King. And it was thought that the said Cardinall had resolued on that enterprise, making shew outwardlie as if he purposed to assault some other place. That his High∣nesse of <HI>Savoy</HI> hath sent away <HI>Martinengo</HI> with other Cap∣taines and all the footmen, towardes <HI>Ciamberi,</HI> where the whole Armie should assemble, it being held for certain that the warre shal continue, howsoeuer the truce be prolonged</P>

They write from <HI>Paris,</HI> that the King was still at <HI>S. Germans,</HI> purpo∣sing immediatlie after he had cleared himselfe, to goe vnto the Camps in <HI>Picardie,</HI> which consisteth of a thousand foot∣men and 1500. horse besides as manie more which are to come with the King.</P>
<P>They write from <HI>Marsiglia</HI> that those inhabitants were all mooued with the newes of <HI>Cachastrasse,</HI> and did there∣fore builde a fort ouer against it to beat and reduce it again to their subiection.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="10"/> and two Captaines of two other Gallies, which at that time were with him.</P>
<P>They write from <HI>Alba Iulia,</HI> that the Turkish power doth dayly increase towards <HI>Danuby,</HI> that they are now allready fiftie thousand strong, and haue built a Bridge, for which cause the <HI>Transiluanian</HI> made all prouision neces∣sarie, doubting greate inconuenience, if the Turkes should bend their force against him, and his succours be slowe in comming.</P>
