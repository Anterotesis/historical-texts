<P>LEtters yesterday Afternoon (by three <HI>Flanders Mails</HI>) of the 21st. instant from <HI>Vienna</HI> bring us the Joyful increase, and Particulars of the Intire and Accomplish'd Victory the <HI>Christian</HI> Army have obtain'd over the <HI>Turks,</HI> near <HI>Darda</HI> the, 12th. Courant, for which Glorious Atchievment, their Imperial Majesties attended by all the Nobility of that Court, paid their Devotions in the Cathedral of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> where <HI>Te Deum</HI> was Sung (with a Royal <HI>Salvo</HI>) of a Triple Discharge of all the Canon upon the Ramparts, continued by Vollies of Musquets, Resounding with Ringing of Bells, Bonefires, and Acclamations of the People; the same being brought the Emperor from the Duke of <HI>Lorain,</HI> by General Count <HI>Taaffe,</HI> since the dispatch of Prince <HI>Eugine</HI> of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>The better to conserve the Method of acquiring this mighty Action, 'tis necessary at first to know the Inducement that oblig'd the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> to quit his Impregnable Retrenchment, and give Battle to the <HI>Christians;</HI> on the 27th. the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> passed the <HI>Drave</HI> with his Army, and Fortified his Camp near <HI>Darda,</HI> with two Modern Retrenchments in the Front, strengthned with <HI>Pallisados,</HI> having <HI>Esseck</HI> and the <HI>Drave</HI> in his Rear, the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Morass</HI> on his right, with a Wood and a <HI>Morass</HI> on his left; which being view'd by the Generals, 'twas judg'd Impossible without hazar∣ding the Ruine of the whole Army, to attaque and force his Camp; there∣fore 'twas resolv'd by some Stratagams of War, to draw the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> from those secured Retrenchments, so March'd and Counter-march'd the Army in divers Figures, one Detatchment of them making shew as if they would repass the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Mohaez,</HI> and go into high <HI>Hungary,</HI> whilst another made a feigned movement, of Marching towards <HI>Sygeth</HI> and <HI>Sycloss,</HI> not without being able suddenly to re-unite their Main Body, which the <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving, look'd upon it at first, as really it was intended, to decoy him out of his Post; and thereupon would scarce permit the Ravaging <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> to pick up some of our <HI>Forrigers,</HI> till believing they might be retreating in earnest, made some Detatchments to observe the Countenance of our Army, and sometimes Skirmished with our advanced Guards, gave us the Alarm; and having taken 200. of our Men, return'd to the Camp (flushed with this advantage) the <HI>Turks</HI> began to shew themselves in different Parties; our Generals contrived new Methods, Marching their Armies in several Fronts further afield, as well to be distant from a Wood, which incommo∣ded our <HI>Foragers,</HI> as to give the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> a larger space of Ground with desire to follow us; But this March was yet in vain, yet notwithstanding, the same day we perceived a considerable Body of <HI>Turkish</HI> Cavalry in our Rear; But so soon as we faced about, and began to Skirmish with them, they made a hasty Retreat: The Duke of <HI>Lorain,</HI> by this time, judging that he should not be able to cause him to give Battle in open Field, took a resolution to March for <HI>Sycloss</HI> and <HI>Five-Churches,</HI> and withdraw those Garrisons, Demolishing the Fortifications, which otherwise might have fallen into the Enemies possession, began to move towards them on the 10th. and with easie Marches, continued the 11th. sending Baron <HI>De
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y"/>Orlick</HI> to precede the Vant-Guard with 4 or 500 Horse; In this March, a great Body of <HI>Turkish</HI> Spahies did what they could to interrupt our mo∣tion, shewing themselves sometimes on the Wing, then on the Flanks; We enter'd upon Dispute with them, but they Retired with recipitation: On the Twelfth, the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> thinking the <HI>CHRISTIANS</HI> were making the best of their way from him, would not loose the opportunity, but detach'd some of his best Troops, to give us a Diversion; and about two in the Afternoon 10000 <HI>Turkish</HI> Cavalry, and half the number of <HI>Janizaries</HI> came right upon our Left Wing, Commanded by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> preceded by some <HI>German Curiasiers,</HI> who vigo∣rously sustain'd the <HI>Turkish</HI> Charge, but retir'd into their first Line: on a sud∣dain The <HI>Janizaries</HI> were Posted on an Eminence, with some Field-Pieces, and made continual Firing with small Shot, whilst 10000 of their Horse en∣deavour'd to put us in Disorder, which oblidg'd the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> to extend his Front to be in proportion with that of the Enemy, the Regi∣ments of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Comercy</HI> sustain'd this first Charge, which was very fierce and obstinate; the <HI>Christians</HI> continuing firm with great Resolution and Courage, notwithstanding they were Attaqu'd in Front and Flank, the E∣lector came in Person to their Assistance, and found the Dispute so warm, that he received a Shot in his Hand, Prince <HI>Comercy</HI> a Wound in the Breast with an Arrow, which yet did not hinder his continuing in the Action, to give what necessary Orders were requir'd.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> to get ground, causes at the same time, the Right Wing to March cross, and stretch towards the Flank of the Enemies, who Attack'd on the Left, and the Left went to meet another Body of Horse and Foot which March'd to Charge them, and now the Fight began to be bloo∣dy on both sides, the Victory hanging in suspense for two or three hours; but by the coming in of a fresh Detachment on the <HI>Christians</HI> side, the <HI>Turks</HI> began to lose ground, afterwards to mend their pace; and in the end, to take a perfect Flight. One Body of their Cavalry relying upon their Foot, put the whole in disorder; a great Slaughter being made, and we pursu'd the Enemy with so much Rigour and Heat, that we enter'd Pell Mell into their <HI>Camp;</HI> and made our selves with little resistance, Masters of both the En∣trenchments, and pursued the Enemy as long as the day would permit. This Victory is so great, as not to have any parallel for some Ages: We drove many into the <HI>Morass</HI> and <HI>Drave,</HI> where they perished; the Bridge over the River, through the weight of People thronging to get over, broke down; some say the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> caus'd the same to be done, leaving a multitude on this side the <HI>Drave,</HI> who are retir'd to the <HI>Woods, Marshes,</HI> and <HI>Isles,</HI> where they are shut up: and must Surrender upon discretion, for want of Food: And some Persons report that there is no less than 25 or 30000 Men thus di∣spers'd. And of 15000 old <HI>Janisaries,</HI> scarce 50 are saved; and they reckon above 20000 are Kill'd and Drown'd. They have Seised a mighty Rich Booty, the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Tent, which is fell to the Lot of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> is so Rich in <HI>Gold, Pearl, Precious Stones,</HI> &amp;c. as is inestimable. 116 <HI>Cannon,</HI> and <HI>Mortars</HI> taken, 6000 Head of Cattle, 1500 <HI>Camels,</HI> an hundred <HI>Buffulors</HI> seized 2000 Waggons with Provision and Ammunition, are fell into our Hands, a number of Tents, Standards, and Horses Tails, and there is scarce a Souldier but abounds in Gold and Silver. The Prisoners also Report, that the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> had not been induced to come out of his Retrenchments, but by the Perswasion of some <HI>Christians</HI> in his Army, who Flatter'd him with assurance of Success; and that they should certainly take Prisoners the Dukes of <HI>Lorain</HI> and <HI>Bavaria;</HI> and thereby oblige the Empe∣rour to make Peace with the Grand <HI>Seigneur,</HI> and restore all the places in <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> he has Conquer'd during the War: But Providence has dispos'd other∣wise, and 'tis not to be doubted, but that this Glorious Victory will have a quite contrary Effect.</P>
