<LG>
<L>LOng lay Great <HI>Britan</HI> in the Ocean's Armes,</L>
<L>Naked, Unseen, Undrest &amp; void of Charms;</L>
<L>Unknown to Others, scarce to her self well known,</L>
<L>Content with half of what was then her own,</L>
<L>Rich only in her Native Innocence,</L>
<L>When other Nations brought their Riches hence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Wise <HI>Phaenecians, Neptune</HI> did adore,</L>
<L>Long e're the Warlik <HI>Romans</HI> knew his Power,</L>
<L><HI>Mars</HI> was their God to him with Zeal they bow'd,</L>
<L>And hardly maimed Rites to <HI>Jove</HI> allow'd:</L>
<L>His Image did adorn their Capitol,</L>
<L>They stil'd him Mighty <HI>Jove,</HI> and that was all;</L>
<L>All other Altars, did neglected ly,</L>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>Whilst <HI>Mars</HI> his Temples smoakt continually,</L>
<L>No Victimes there did bleed to <HI>Neptunes</HI> Name,</L>
<L>They only heard of such a God by Fame,</L>
<L>And hated him by Nature mortally,</L>
<L>Because he did protect their Enemy,</L>
<L><HI>Carthage</HI> their Rival did that God adore,</L>
<L>He loaded them with Wealth from ev'ry Shoar.</L>
<L>But <HI>Mars</HI> delights to keep his People poor▪</L>
<L>For Poverty does make all Mankind brave.</L>
<L>Few Value Life, who no Convenience have,</L>
<L>These from their birth were alwayse Rival Gods,</L>
<L><HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> were ever more at odds?</L>
<L>These <HI>Mars</HI> prefers, wise <HI>Neptune</HI> still neglects,</L>
<L>As <HI>Albion</HI> now does find by sad efects.</L>
<L><HI>Neptun</HI>'s the God the <HI>Britans</HI> first did know,</L>
<L>His right to them did <HI>Carthaginians</HI> show.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>Carthage</HI> Ships which hither came for Tinn,</L>
<L>(As same reports) did <HI>Britans</HI> Trade begin.</L>
<L><HI>Carbage</HI> the child of <HI>Tyre,</HI> that Queen of Trade</L>
<L>Long courted <HI>Albion,</HI> but did ne're invade.</L>
<L>Then with their ships their <HI>chiefest god</HI> was brought</L>
<L>A God whose harmles Rites are easely taught.</L>
<L>A God whose ehief delight is liberty,</L>
<L><HI>A</HI> God abhores all sorts of tyranny:</L>
<L>VVhither of one or many; matters not,</L>
<L>Hated Opression was in Hell begot:</L>
<L>But of all sorts with which the World's acurst,</L>
<L>The many Headed Tyrant is the worst,</L>
<L><HI>Albion</HI> has felt them all▪ her wealth and ease</L>
<L>Makes them in liberty so hard to please,</L>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>There's scarce an Age but brings her old disease,</L>
<L>And at the first Invasion <HI>Caesar</HI> brought,</L>
<L><HI>Romes</HI> Arms, and <HI>Mars</HI> here first oppression taught.</L>
<L>With Fears and Jealousies in wealth they swell,</L>
<L>They seem to want Diversion when they'r well.</L>
<L>In times like these they must their errours see.</L>
<L>Ah! may they for the future wiser be,</L>
<L>And throw no more away their Trade by Sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Neptune</HI> first did to this Isle resort,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with its Site, he placed there his Court,</L>
<L>And seldom did his Presence thence withdraw,</L>
<L>But when his hated Rival gave the Law.</L>
<L>The Fates and Nature did divide the Land,</L>
<L><HI>Albions</HI> two Daughters, each their Part cōmand.</L>
<L>Two Nimphs of Equal Beautie, Twins by Birth,</L>
<L>Did eq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally divide their Native Earth,</L>
<L>The Eldest South, the Youngest Northward Reigns.</L>
<L>This over Mountains, that o're fertile Plains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Neptune</HI> did <HI>Caledonia</HI> Court, disdainfull She</L>
<L>Slighted his Love, would <HI>Mars</HI> his Mistris be,</L>
<L>That God who does in Human Blood delight,</L>
<L>Him She ador'd, and forc't her Sons to fight.</L>
<L>First in domestick slaughters taught them Wars,</L>
<L>Then drove them thence to search for death &amp; scars</L>
<L>On <HI>forraign shoars,</HI> they starving honour got</L>
<L>No Land but boasts the <HI>Tomh</HI> of some great <HI>SCOT</HI></L>
<L>Thus to delight her cruel Lovers Eyes,</L>
<L>By Law she does her Children sacrifice,</L>
<L>An Army on his Altar yearly dyes.</L>
<L>Worthies, who had they been in Trade imploy'd</L>
<PB REF="5"/>
<L>Had brought her Riches in at every Tide,</L>
<L>For Liberal <HI>Neptune,</HI> did present her Store.</L>
<L>Of Fishfull Harbours round about her Shoar</L>
<L>No Nation in the World can boast of more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fame sayes two Weirds did there arive of old,</L>
<L>And bids the Natives search their Hills for Gold.</L>
<L>But blind unthinking Mortals sure they be,</L>
<L>Who turn up Rocks when they may plow the Sea</L>
<L>Fate the true source of Wealth to <HI>Neptune</HI> gave,</L>
<L>God <HI>Pluto</HI> is no more then <HI>Neptunes</HI> Slave.</L>
<L>He digs towards Hell, &amp; from its Confines draws</L>
<L>Money, the Scales of Wealth, but not the Caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>Riches proceed from Labour well imploy'd,</L>
<L>When mutual Use of things does Men divide.</L>
<L>Money's the Standart does the Cause decide,</L>
<L>But 'tis its Name, not Nature which prevai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>Money and Money worth are equal Scales:</L>
<L>Trace but the World, you'l find these Lands most poor</L>
<L>Abound in Mynes and boast the richest Oar.</L>
<L>But every Nation which frequent the Seas,</L>
<L>Wallow in Wealth, and pass their time at Ease.</L>
<L>Trade needs no fertile Acres for Support,</L>
<L>Where ever Freedom lives, it makes its Court;</L>
<L>And only craves a safe and open Port;</L>
<L>Wherever it thrives, there Strangers do abound,</L>
<L>But where its wanting, Penury is found,</L>
<L>And makes such Land unhospitable Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A proof of which is miserable Me.</L>

<L>For setting foot on <HI>Caledonian</HI> Ground,</L>
<L>No wonder then that when I touch my Lyre,</L>
<L>My tunes runs low because they want their Fyre.</L>
<L>The Theam I treat is Glorious, Great and Brave</L>
<L>But he that sings it a poor chain'd Slave,</L>
<L>Like caged Birds; he utters broken Notes,</L>
<L>These whistle loud, poor things and streach their throats</L>
<L>Putting Complaints in Tune &amp; warblings Sighs,</L>
<L>To move some pity to their Miseries.</L>
<L>But all in vain; as vainly do I sing,</L>
<L>For none that hear me dare compassion bring;</L>
<L>To speak on my behalf proves bad intent,</L>
<L>But to assist me's Boot or Banishment</L>
<L>Ill must a Stranger surely pass his Time.</L>
<L>Where Pity's Sin, and Charity a Crime!</L>
<L>A wanting Stranger too despis'd by all,</L>
<L>Whose bare Complaints are counted criminal.</L>
<L>Cease then my Muse, and speak of this no more</L>
<L>But shift thy Fancie to the <HI>English</HI> Shoar,</L>
<L>An Hospitable Shoar by Trade refin'd,</L>
<L>To Strangers ever Equal, Just and Kind</L>
<L>Ah! Heav'n that to their Kings they were the fame</L>
<L>In this they fail, in this they are to blame.</L>
<L>Their Errours on that head do Volumns swell,</L>
<L>Ah! might they ever in Oblivion dwell.</L>
</LG>

<L>In that once happy Land, &amp; may it be,</L>
<L>Happy again, which I scarce hope to see.</L>

<L>They've only left us our Plantation Trade.</L>
<L>In that too by their Tricks they so much share;</L>
<L>We little more than their poor Factors are.</L>
<L>We drudge for Suggars, which it's they refine,</L>
<L>Their Drawbacks do our Profits undermine.</L>
<L>As wisely might we send our Wool from home,</L>
<L>As let them for our <HI>Moscovadoes</HI> come:</L>
<L>Bribe them indeed to come &amp; fetch them hence,</L>
<L>Thus we Inrich them at our own Expence.</L>
<L>We magnifie their Wisdom to the Skies,</L>
<L>When it's our folly only makes them Wise;</L>
<L>But since it is alle foolish to complain,</L>
<L>I'll bring my Thoughts to <HI>Scotland</HI> back again;</L>
<L>Where all the <HI>Truths</HI> that <HI>Paterson</HI> has said;</L>
<L>Had in the end but small Impression made.</L>
<L>Had not the <HI>English</HI> Votes, and Noisie Fears,</L>
<L>Awak'd the Land, and open'd all their Ears,</L>
<L>Thus as one Man the Nation has combin'd,</L>
<L>And speedily a mighty Stock is joyn'd:</L>
<L>A Stock so large, a Stock so very great,</L>
<L>As must infallibly the Work compleat:</L>
<L>That the Design is Wise, I surely know,</L>
<PB REF="9"/>
<L>Tho <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> may not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</L>
<L>Wise Things when put in practice come in trew,</L>
<L>Till then it's fit they should be known to sew:</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Secrecie's the Soul of great Designs,</L>
<L>Made publick once, the Enemy combines.</L>
<L>Nothing can be contriv'd tho ne'r so Wise,</L>
<L>If once made known, but will find Enemies.</L>
<L>This much I'll say, those that oppose it most,</L>
<L>Will in the End, find all their Labour lost:</L>
<L>They need not Trade in Paths, were Trade before,</L>
<L>Of undiscovered Trade, the World has Store.</L>
<L>Many blest Lands rich Nature can affoord,</L>
<L>Which never yet beheld their proper Lord:</L>
<L>Lands which abound in Rivers, Meads, &amp; Groves,</L>
<L>Where unaffrighted Birds do chant their Loves:</L>
<L>Where nūerous Floks, &amp; Herds of harmless Beasts,</L>
<L>Freely possess their undisturbed rests.</L>
<L>Where various Trees alse various Fruits produce,</L>
<L>Some yielding Food, and some delicious Juice.</L>
<L>Where rugged Winter never yet was seen,</L>
<L>Nor least defect in everlasting Green.</L>
<L>Where constant Course of equal Night and Day?</L>
<L>Gives an Eternal Spring without decay.</L>
<L>New fragrant Flowers, delightful to the Eyes,</L>
<L>Do every Morning with the Sun arise.</L>
<L>Who there to search the Earth does never stay,</L>
<L>But only wipes her Dewie Sweat away:</L>
<L>Whilst cooling Breezes fan her lovely Face,</L>
<L>And Aromatick Smells fill every place:</L>
<L>Such Lands the Sun does every day behold,</L>
<PB REF="10"/>
<L>With Hills of Silver, Rivers paved with Gold</L>
<L>Lands never yet with charming Beauties Blest,</L>
<L>Nor never yet with raging War opprest.</L>
<L>Never by Blood of Man or Beast defil'd,</L>
<L>Nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever yet with Tricks of Law beguil'd,</L>
<L>Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree from Guilt; happy in being Wild.</L>

<L>On some such Shoar from all Preluctancy,</L>
<L><HI>This Company designs a Colony.</HI></L>
<L>To which all Mankind freely may resort,</L>
<L>And find quick Justice in an open Port.</L>
<L>To that the weary Labourer may go,</L>
<L>And gain an easie Wealth in doing so.</L>
<L>Small Use of tiresome Labour will be there,</L>
<L>That Clyme richly rewards a little Care,</L>
<L>There every Man may choose a pleasant Seat,</L>
<L>Which <HI>poor Men</HI> will make Rich, &amp; <HI>Rich Men</HI> Great</L>
<L>Black Slaves like bussie Bees will plant them Canes</L>
<L>Have Juice more sweet then honey in their <HI>Veins</HI></L>
<L>Which boil'd to Sugar, brings in constant gains</L>
<L>They'l raise them <HI>Cotton, Ginger, Indigo.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Luscious, Potatoes,</HI> and the rich <HI>Coco.</HI></L>
<L>Ships thence encrease to fetch these Goods away,</L>
<L>For which the Stock will ready Money pay.</L>
<L>By Manufactures here the Poor will live,</L>
<L>So they that go and they that stay will thrive.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Caledonia</HI> by her Lovers won,</L>
<L>Will now Light <HI>Shining Nuptial</HI> Robes put on,</L>
<L>Sea <HI>Gods,</HI> and <HI>Nymphs</HI> will dance, &amp; <HI>Tritons</HI> play</L>
<L>And yearly Celebrate her Wedding Day.</L>
