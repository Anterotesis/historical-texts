<P>Last Fryday the French Army consisting of 15000 men, under the command of Monsieur de Fequires, came before Thionville or Die∣denhofen on the River of Mosel, 4 leagues below Metz, and in the surrounding of it, they skirmish'd certaine houres long with the Im∣perialists, amongst which were 5 Companies of Crabats, and forced them to retire towards Tryer in a great disorder. The said Fort of Thionville is exceeding strong, but by all app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance it is not well victuall'd, because at Collen lie yet 16 quarters of corne, which the Spaniards had bought for the said Fort, and at Tries lie 1300 quar∣ters more, bought for the said Fort; this is bad newes for the whole River of Mosel and Rhyne. Marquis de Grana and Piccolomini lye yet about S. Vit, where they expect 12 peeces of Ordnances, and then they are resolved to encounter the French. Conte de Guebrian re∣maines in the French-county to continue the war there, and hath ta∣ken the Castle of Villano and other places; the Regiments of Colo∣nell Rosa and Canofsky, which lead the Avantguard, had almost ta∣ken prisoner the Duke of Loraine, who had brought 500 quarters of corne into Diedenhofen and was comming back again from thence: many are of opinion, that Duke Bernard of Weymar will likewise go that way, which causeth great feare here abouts.</P>
