ANd as to men desyryng to haue a very knowlege of these crony∣cles or of ony other / it is necessary to kno¦we .vj. thynges. ¶ The fyrst is y<SUP>e</SUP> states of thynges / &amp; those bē two. One is fro y<SUP>e</SUP> begynnynge of y<SUP>e</SUP> worlde vnto Chryst / y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche is called the state of deuiacyon. The seconde is frō Chryst to y<SUP>e</SUP> ende of y<SUP>e</SUP> worlde / the whiche is called the state of reconstliacyon. ¶ The secōde thynge is the diuysyon of tymes / &amp; those ben thre. One is afore the lawe of Moyses / &amp; an other is vnder the lawe of Moyses / an other is vnder the lawe of grace after Chryst dyed. ¶ The thyrde is y<SUP>e</SUP> gouer∣nyng of kyngdomes. And as for that ye must knowe / y<SUP>t</SUP> though there were foure prȳcipal kyngdomes / that is to saye / of Babilon / of Persees / of Grekes / &amp; of Ro¦maynes. Neuerthelesse as to y<SUP>e</SUP> course of the worlde / &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> ordre of holy scripture / y<SUP>e</SUP> fyrst gouernyng was vnder faders / frō Adam vnto Moyses. The secōde vnder iudges / from Moyses vnto Saul. The thyrde vnder kȳges from Saul vnto zō¦robabel. The fourth vnder bisshops / frō zorobabel vnto Chryst. ¶ The fourth is y<SUP>e</SUP> dyuersite of lawes / &amp; those were fyue. The fyrst was y<SUP>e</SUP> lawe of nature / &amp; that was comyn to all men. The secōde is y<SUP>e</SUP> lawe or custome of gentyles / whan y<SUP>t</SUP> vn¦der kynge Nyno began y<SUP>e</SUP> people to wor∣shyp false goddes. The thyrde is vnder the lawe wryten rose the lawe of iewes / whan circūcysyon deuyded y<SUP>e</SUP> iewes frō other peple. The fourth is vnder chryst rose y<SUP>e</SUP> lawe of christen men / whan fayth and grace of y<SUP>e</SUP> sacramentes enformed y<SUP>e</SUP> lyfe of men. The fyfth is vnder Macho¦met rose the lawe of sarasyns &amp; turkes. ¶ The fyfth is the noblenesse or vnno∣blenes in dedes. And as to these / it is to knowe that .vij. persones ben redde / of whome the dedes many tymes are had in mynde in hystoryes. That is to wyte of a prynce in his realme / of a knyght in batayle / of a iudge in his place / of a bys∣shop in the clergye / of a polytyke man in the people / of an husbond man in the hous / &amp; of an abbot in his chirche. And of these are wryten many tymes / the laudes of good men / and the punysshe∣mentes of the cursed men. ¶ The syxth is the true countynge of the yeres. And to that / it is to be knowen y<SUP>t</SUP> there were viij. maner of nombrynge or countynge of the yeres. Thre after the Hebrewes. Thre after the Grekes. One of the Ro∣mayns. And one now is after the chry∣sten men. The Hebrewes thre maner of wyse begynneth theyr yere. After the Hebrewes there is the yere vsuall be∣gynnynge at Ianuary / y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche they vse in couenauntes and bargeyns ma∣kyng. And the yere leyfull begynnynge at Marche / the whiche they vse in theyr cerymonyes. And the yere Emergens from Maye begynnynge / whan they wente from Egypte / they vse in theyr cronycles &amp; calculacyons. ¶ The Gre∣kes nōbreth theyr yeres thre maner of wyse. Fyrst to the glory &amp; Ioye of theyr victory coūteth theyr yeres from the de∣struccyon of Troye. The fyrst / y<SUP>•</SUP> second / the thyrde / and the fourth. <ABBR>&amp;c.</ABBR> ¶ Than after the chyualry began at the hyll of Olympus they notyfyed y<SUP>e</SUP> yeres after the same Olimpiadū. And what Olim∣piades is / ye shall knowe after in the boke. The thyrde whan they began to haue lordshyp of all the worlde they no∣tifyed theyr yeres these maner of wyse. In the yere of the regne of Grekes / the fourth / the .x. the .xv. <ABBR>&amp;c.</ABBR> as it is open in the boke of Machabeo{rum}. ¶ Than after the Romayns gouernynge the worlde / coūted &amp; nōbred theyr yeres (ab vrbe con dita). ¶ The last of all chrystē men coū∣teth theyr yeres from y<SUP>e</SUP> Incarnacyon of Chryst.

And that in y<SUP>•</SUP> begynnynge of his regne sholde be haūted moche leche∣ry. And he sayd sothe / alas the tyme for kyng Edward y<SUP>t</SUP> was kyng Edwardes sone was borne at Carnaruan in Wales For sothe he had hornes of syluer and a berd as whyte as snowe whan he was made prȳce of Wales / to moche he gaue hym to ryot and to foly. And sothe sayd Merlyn in his {pro}phecy / that there <ABBR>shold</ABBR> come out of his nose a droppe. For in his tyme was grete honger among y<SUP>•</SUP> poore people / &amp; stronge dethe amonge y<SUP>•</SUP> ty the that dyed in strange londe with sorowe &amp; in warre in Scotlond. And afterward he lost Scotlonde &amp; Gascoyn &amp; moche le chery in his dayes was haūced. ¶ Also Merlyn sayd y<SUP>t</SUP> this gote sholde seke the floure of lyfe &amp; of deth. And he sayd so the for he spoused Isabell y<SUP>•</SUP> kynges syster of Fraūce. And in this tyme Merlyn sayd that there shold be made brydges of folk vpon dyches of the see.

sholde fall from castels / &amp; many townes shold be made playne. And he sayd sothe For whan kynge Edward was discom¦fyted in Scotlonde &amp; came than south∣warde / the Scottes besyeged castels &amp; dyd moche harme / &amp; brent townes vnto the harde erth. ¶ And afterward Mer∣lyn tolde that an egle sholde come out of Cornewayle that sholde haue fethers of golde / that of pryde sholde haue no pere / and he shold despyse lordes of blode / and after he shold dye through a bere at Ga∣uersyche / &amp; that prophecy was full well knowen &amp; foūde soche. For by the egle is vnderstande syr Pyers Ganaston / that than was erle of Cornewayle / whiche was a wonders proude man / &amp; despised the barons of Englonde / but afterward he was heded at Gauersyche through y<SUP>e</SUP> erle of Lancastre &amp; the erle of warwyk. ¶ And Merlyn tolde that in this tyme it sholde seme that the bere sholde brenne and that batayle shold be vpon an arme of the see in a felde arayed lyke a shelde where sholde dye many whyte hedes / &amp; he sayd sothe. For by the brennynge of y<SUP>e</SUP> bere is betokened grete drede through cuttynge of swerdes at that batayle of Myton / for there came y<SUP>e</SUP> Scottes in ma¦ner of a shelde in a wynge / &amp; slewe men of religyon / preestes and seculers / wher fore the Scottes called that batayle in despyte of Englysshmen the whyte ba∣tayle. ¶ And after Merlin sayd that the foresayd Bere sholde do the Gote moche harme / &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> sholde be vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> south west / and also vpon his blode. And sayd also y<SUP>t</SUP> the Gote shold lese moche dele of his lon∣de / tyll the tyme that shame sholde hym ouercome / &amp; than he shold clothe hym in a lyons skynne / &amp; sholde wynne agayne that he had lost / &amp; more through people that sholde come out of the north west / y<SUP>t</SUP> sholde make hym to be fered and hym a∣uenge vpon his enemyes through coun¦seyle of two owles / that fyrst <ABBR>shold</ABBR> be in peryl to be vndone. And those two owles sholde go ouer see in to a straūge londe / &amp; there dwell a certayn tyme / &amp; after shold returne agayn in to Englond / &amp; shold do moche harme to many one / &amp; that they sholde coūseyle y<SUP>e</SUP> Gote to meue warre a∣gaynst the foresaid bere / &amp; the gote &amp; the owles sholde come to an arme of y<SUP>e</SUP> see at Burton vpon Trent / &amp; sholde go ouer / &amp; that for drede the bere sholde flee with a swan in his cōpany to Bury towarde y<SUP>e</SUP> north through an vnkynde outpulter / &amp; that y<SUP>e</SUP> swan thā shold be slayne w<SUP>t</SUP> sorow and the bere <ABBR>shold</ABBR> be slayne full nye his owne nest / y<SUP>t</SUP> shold stande vpon Poūtfret vpon whome the sonne sholde shede his bemes / &amp; many folke shold seke hym for his vertue. And he sayd sothe. for y<SUP>e</SUP> good erle Thomas of Lācastre was borne in the north west / &amp; cosyn to y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge &amp; his vncles sone / &amp; by lawe he made y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge lese moche lōde y<SUP>t</SUP> he had purchased wyl fully tyll at y<SUP>e</SUP> last the kynge toke therof shame / &amp; hymselfe fylled w<SUP>t</SUP> cruelte. And after gate agayne y<SUP>t</SUP> he had lost &amp; moche more / through helpe of folk comyng out of y<SUP>e</SUP> northwest / by whom he was drad / &amp; auenged hȳ on his barons through coū¦seyle of y<SUP>e</SUP> two Spēsers y<SUP>t</SUP> afore were out lawed for theyr wickednes / &amp; after came agayne out of Fraūce / &amp; so moche these Spensers coūseyled y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge y<SUP>t</SUP> he <ABBR>shold</ABBR> warre vpon Thomas of Lancastre / so y<SUP>t</SUP> the kyng &amp; the Spensers and the erle of Arundell and theyr power mette with Thomas of Lancastre at Burton vpon Trent / and hym there discomfyted / and syr Vmfrey erle of Herford was in his company. And after fledde the foresayd Thomas and Vmfrey with theyr com∣pany to Burbrygge / metynge with syr Andrewe of Herkela / that is called y<SUP>e</SUP> vn∣kynde outpulter / and also syr Symond Warde erle of Yorke they came &amp; met w<SUP>t</SUP>

But after¦ward many hym sought for myracles y<SUP>•</SUP> god dyd for hym. And in y<SUP>•</SUP> tyme Merlyn sayd / for sorowe and harme sholde dye a people of his londe / wherfore many lon¦des sholde be vpon hym the more bolder And he sayd sothe / for bycause of his ba∣rons that were put to deth for saȳt Tho¦mas quarell of Lancastre / people of ma∣ny londes became the bolder for to meue warre vpon theyr kyng / for theyr blode was turned to many nacyons. And af∣terward Merlyn tolde &amp; sayd y<SUP>t</SUP> the fore∣sayd owles sholde do moche harme vnto the floure of lyfe &amp; deth / and they sholde brynge her to moche dysease / so that she sholde go ouer see in to Fraūce for to ma∣ke peas to y<SUP>•</SUP> floure delyce / &amp; there sholde abyde tyll on a tyme her sede shold come and seke her / and there they shold abyde bothe tyll y<SUP>•</SUP> tyme that they sholde clothe them with grace / &amp; those two owles she sholde seke &amp; put them to pyteous deth. And that prophecy was well knowen / &amp; was full sothe. For syr Hugh Spenser the fader &amp; syr Hugh the sone did moche sorowe and persecucyon vnto the quene Isabell through theyr {pro}curemēt to her lord y<SUP>•</SUP> kyng. So they ordeyned amonge them y<SUP>•</SUP> she was put vnto her wages / y<SUP>•</SUP> is to saye .xx. shillynges in y<SUP>•</SUP> daye / wher fore the kyng of Frauce her broder was sore alwyed / &amp; sent in to Englonde by his lettres vnto kynge Edward y<SUP>•</SUP> he sholde come vnto his parlyament to Parys in Fraūce. But kynge Edwarde was sore adradde to come there / for he wende to haue be arested tyll that he had made a∣mendes for the trespace that syr Hugh Spenser the fader &amp; the sone had done / &amp; for y<SUP>•</SUP> harme y<SUP>•</SUP> they had done to the quene Isabell his syster. Wherfore through her ordynaūce &amp; cōsent of y<SUP>•</SUP> Spensers y<SUP>•</SUP> quene Isabell went ouer see in to Frau∣ce for to make accorde bytwene kyng Ed¦warde &amp; the kyng of Fraūce her broder. And there dwelled she in Fraūce tyll Ed¦ward her eldest sone came for to seke her and so they dwelled there bothe tyll that alyaūce was made bytwene them &amp; the gentyl erle of Henaud / y<SUP>t</SUP> yf they w<SUP>t</SUP> theyr vertue myght destroye &amp; ouercome y<SUP>•</SUP> ves nym &amp; the falsnes of the Spensers that syr Edward sholde spouse dame Philip the worshypfull lady &amp; the erles dough∣ter of Henaud. Wherfore the quene Isa∣bell &amp; Edward her sone / &amp; syr Edmonde of wodstocke the kynges broder of Eng∣lond / &amp; syr Iohn of Henaud / &amp; syr Rogrt Mortimer of Wygmore / &amp; syr Thomas Rocelyn / &amp; syr Iohn of Cromwell / &amp; syr Willyam Trussell / &amp; many other of the alyaunce of the gentyll erle Thomas of Lancastre y<SUP>t</SUP> were exiled out of Englōde for his quarel / &amp; were disherued of theyr londes / ordeyned them a grete power &amp; arryued at Herewich in Suffolke.

And Merlyn sayd also more y<SUP>•</SUP> the gote sholde be put to grete disrase &amp; grete anguysshe &amp; in grete soro wehe sholde lede his lyfe. And he sayd sothe / for after y<SUP>•</SUP> tyme that kyng Edward was taken he was put in to warde tyll that y<SUP>•</SUP> Spensers were put to deth / &amp; also bycause he wolde not come to his parlyamēt at London as he had ordeyued &amp; assygned hymselfe vnto his haronage / &amp; also wolde not gouerne and rule his people nor his realme as a kynge sholde do.

Wher∣fore the kynge &amp; his coūseyle towardes hym were agreued / &amp; ordeyned amonge them to vndo hym through pure reason and lawe / bycause that kynge Edward that was the kynges fader tray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oursly through hym was murdred in y<SUP>•</SUP> castell of Corf / as before is sayd more playn∣ly in the same parte of this boke of his deth.

counseyle loued Mortimer / &amp; tolde hym in preuite how that the kyng &amp; his coun¦seyle were aboute frō daye to daye hym for to destroye &amp; vndo. Wherfore Morti∣mer was sore anoyed and angry as the deuyll agaynst them y<SUP>t</SUP> were of y<SUP>e</SUP> kynges coūseyle / &amp; sayd he wolde of them be a∣uenged how so euer he toke on. It was not longe afterward that king Edward and dame Philip his wyfe / &amp; dame Isa¦bell the kynges moder / &amp; syr Roger Mor¦tymer ne went vnto Notyngham there for to soiourne. And so it befel that quene Isabell through counseyle of Mortimer toke to her the keys of y<SUP>e</SUP> gates of y<SUP>e</SUP> castel of Notyngham / so that no man myght come in nor out by nyght / but through cōmaūdement of Mortimer / ne y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge nor none of his coūseyle.

Wherfore all those y<SUP>t</SUP> were of the kynges coūseyle whā they wyst of Mor¦timers castynge / pryuely came to kyng Edwarde &amp; sayd that Mortimer wolde destroye them bycause they had accused hym of kyng Edwardes deth his fader and prayed hym y<SUP>t</SUP> he wolde maynteyne them in theyr right. And these were the lordes y<SUP>t</SUP> pursued this quarell / syr Williā of Mountagu / syr Vmfrey de Boghun / syr Williā his broder / syr Rauf of Staf∣ford / syr Robert of Herford / syr Willyam of Clynton / syr Iohn Neuyll of Nornby and many other of theyr consent / and all these swore vpon a boke to maynteyne the quarell in as moche as they myght. And it befell so after that syr Wyllyam of Mountagu ne none of y<SUP>e</SUP> kynges fren∣des must not be herborowed in the castel for Mortimer / but went and toke theyr herborowe in dyuers places of y<SUP>e</SUP> towne of Notyngham. And tho were they sore adrad lest that Mortimer <ABBR>shold</ABBR> destroye them / and in haste came vnto kyng Ed∣ward syr Willyam of Moūtagu y<SUP>t</SUP> than was in y<SUP>e</SUP> castell / and pryuely tolde hym that he nor none of his company sholde not take Mortimer without counseyle &amp; helpe of Wyllyam of Eland constable of the same castell.

Than sayd Moūtagu / syr my lord graūt mercy. Than went forth the foresayd Moūtagu and came to the constable of the castell / and told hym the kynges wyll. And he answered &amp; sayd the kynges wyll shold be done in as mo∣che as he myght / and that he wolde not spare for no maner deth / and so he swore and made his othe. Than sayd syr Wil∣lyam of Mountagu to the constable / in herynge of all them that were helpyng vnto the same quarell. Now certes dere frende / vs behoueth to werke and do by your aduyse for to take Mortymer / syth that ye be keper of the castell &amp; haue the keys in your warde. Syr sayd the con∣stable ye shall vnderstande that y<SUP>e</SUP> gates of the castell ben locked with the lockes that dame Isabell sente hyther / and by nyght she hath the keys therof &amp; layeth them vnder the leuesell of the bedde tyll on the morowe / and so ye may not come in to the castell by the gates in no ma∣ner of wyse / but I knowe an aley that

Now certes it semeth vs that he werketh by grace / for he is wonders gracyous in his quarell / &amp; we certes shal be deed or that we may come to hȳ vs for to yelde / syth that his fader set of vs no pryce.

And neuertheles at y<SUP>t</SUP> assaut they wende it had ben the grete hoost of Scotlonde. And whan it came to the morowe they gadred them togyder and rested them a whyle. And whyle y<SUP>e</SUP> englisshmen rested them / the noble baron Thomas Vescy &amp; the noble baron of stafford pricked theyr horses vp &amp; down by y<SUP>e</SUP> hylles for to kepe the estres of y<SUP>•</SUP> coūtree / &amp; as they prycked vp and down they sawe a grete hoost of good araye ordeyned in theyr wynges with helmes and sheldes shynynge co∣mynge vpon them.

But whā syr Donald erle of Marcil that was with y<SUP>•</SUP> Scottes sawe all this / he said to Robert Brus the sone of Robert the Brus these wordes.

Now certes Roberte (sayd syr Donald) falsly ye lye / I am not of theyr company ne of theyr cōsent / &amp; that hastely ye shall se / for I wyll fyght w<SUP>t</SUP> them rather than ony of this cōpany / &amp; certes syr Roberte sayd he I shal in maugre of thy heed as∣sayle them or thou. And with that they prycked theyr stedes fyersly on Gaskmo re / &amp; theyr wynges them folowed on a rēge / &amp; tho came they &amp; mette w<SUP>t</SUP> Bayloll &amp; his cōpany at an hangynge bough of the more in a strayte passage / and so fast they hasted them vnto the englysshmen that thousandes fell to the groūde eche ouer other in to an hepe bothe hors &amp; mā Syr Bayloll &amp; his men myghtely stode agaynst them &amp; fast slewe the Scottes to the groūde / &amp; many they fore woūded so longe tyll that they stode vpon them &amp; foyned them w<SUP>t</SUP> theyr swerdes &amp; speres through theyr bodyes / and full sore they were trauayled vpon them / tyll y<SUP>t</SUP> they became wōders wery / &amp; wyst not what for to do. And y<SUP>•</SUP> Scottes that were lefte alyue fledde away for to saue themselfe in the best maner that they myght. And tho pursued them syr Edwarde Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and his men / &amp; slewe of them tyll it was night.

Whan this thȳge was knowen through Scotlonde how that y<SUP>•</SUP> lordes &amp; knyghtes were discōfyted at Gaskmore of Scotlond through syr Edward Bay∣loll / ye shall vnderstande that y<SUP>e</SUP> lordes &amp; ladyes &amp; the gentyls of Scotlonde came wonders fast to saynt Iohns towne / &amp; yelded them to Bayloll / &amp; to him dyd ho∣mage &amp; feaute for theyr londes / &amp; yelded them to his peas. And he them receiued frely / &amp; fro thens he went to y<SUP>e</SUP> abbey of Scone / &amp; there he was crowned kyng of Scotlonde / &amp; after he let crye his peas throughout all the londe.

And these thre lordes aforesayd for lucre of money had made a promesse vnto y<SUP>•</SUP> Frensshmen for to haue slayne kyng Henry the fyfth and all his bretherne by a false trayne sodeynly or they had ben ware. But almyghty god of his grete grace helde his holy hande ouer them &amp; saued them from these pe∣rillous meiny.

For in treason they passe other men / &amp; bē traytours as it were by kynde / for they prayed all the Pictes / &amp; specially the gretest of them to a feest / &amp; wayted theyr tyme whan the Pictes were mery and had well dronke they drewe vp nayles y<SUP>•</SUP> helde vp holowe benches vnder the Pictes / &amp; the Pictes vnware sodeynly fell in ouer y<SUP>•</SUP> hammes in to a wonderfull pytfall.

It se∣meth that it is to say in trauayle they be Tantali / for they do ryght nought ther∣to. The thyrde worde is Dedali / take hede that Dedalus was a subtyll and a slye man. And therfore by lykenes they that ben subtyll and slye / they ben called Dedali.
