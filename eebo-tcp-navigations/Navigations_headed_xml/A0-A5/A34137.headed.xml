<HEAD><HI>The Common-wealths Ship, common∣ly called the</HI> Soveraign <HI>of the Seas, with her bulke, and burden.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>EFORE I come to give you a true and exact Dimension of her bulke, burden, &amp;c. it is ne∣cessary that I make some satisfaction to the world concerning those Decorements which <HI>beautifie</HI> and <HI>adorne her,</HI> and to render a faire account of mine owne invention concerning the <HI>carving worke,</HI> the <HI>Figures,</HI> and <HI>Mottoes</HI> upon them, which some perhaps have too liberally taxed: Thus therefore to any who have formerly either doubted of their propriety, or are at this present desirous to understand their imagined obscurity, I thus freely deliver my selfe.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Beak-head</HI> sitteth royall King <HI>Edgar</HI> on horse∣backe, trampling upon seven Kings.</P>
<P>Concerning those Kings whom you may perceive to lye prostrate under his Horses hoofes, they were <HI>Kynadus,</HI> King of the <HI>Scots, Malcolme,</HI> King of <HI>Cumberland;</HI> and of the pet∣ty Kings of <HI>Wales, Dufnall, Grifith, Huvall, Jacob, Judithil.</HI> He moreover surprized by Sea a Prince of the <HI>Romans,</HI> whose name was <HI>Maxentius,</HI> who had done many out-rages upon the <HI>Ocean,</HI> and was the greatest Arch-pirate that those times afforded. He also compelled <HI>Ludwallus,</HI> prime Prince and King of <HI>Cambria,</HI> which is <HI>Wales,</HI> (because he would have all the ravenous &amp; dammageous Beasts to be destroyed through the Land) to pay unto him yearly by way of Tribute, three
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> hundred Wolves skins: by reason whereof, within the space of forty yeares after, in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Wales,</HI> both which (but especially <HI>Wales)</HI> who before were miserably infested with that kind of beast, there was scarcely to be fouud one Wolfe alive: and so much for the Princes over which he had sole dominion.</P>
<P><HI>His Navy Royall consisted of three thousand and sixe hundred Ships, (such as they used in those dayes) yet not any of them but serviceable either for Fight, or bearing Victuall, and munition, to furnish the Navy, which he divided into three parts, appointing to every of them a severall squadron: and this hee did to secure Navi∣gators from</HI> Enemies, <HI>and</HI> Sea-Rovers, <HI>as also from all other neighbour Princes, who might challenge any interest in these our</HI> foure Seas. <HI>And therefore every</HI> Spring <HI>and</HI> Summer, <HI>he in per∣son sayled with those in the East parts, to them that lay hovering in the</HI> West. <HI>And sending them backe againe with their Charge, would with the</HI> West squadrant, <HI>saile into the</HI> North, <HI>and after with the</HI> Northern <HI>Fleet compasse into the</HI> East, <HI>by which the</HI> Maine Ocean <HI>rounding those Islands, of which he was sole</HI> Prince <HI>and</HI> Monarch, <HI>being at his onely charge, both quieted and secured, he did (as justly he might) write himselfe</HI> Lord of the foure Seas.</P>
<P>I began at the <HI>Beak-head,</HI> where I desire you to take no∣tice, that upon the stemme-head there is <HI>Cupid,</HI> or a Child resembling him, bestriding and bridling a <HI>Lyon,</HI> which im∣porteth, <HI>That sufferance may curbe Insolence, and Innocence re∣straine violence.</HI></P>
<P>On the Bulk-head right forward, stand six severall Statues in sundry postures, their Figures representing <HI>Consilium,</HI> that is, Counsell: <HI>Cura,</HI> that is, Care: <HI>Conamen,</HI> that is, Industry, and unanimous indeavour in one compartment: <HI>Counsell</HI> holding in her hand <HI>a closed or folded Scrole; Care,</HI> a Sea-com∣passe; <HI>Conamen,</HI> or <HI>Industry,</HI> a Lint stock fixed. Upon the o∣ther, to correspond with the former, <HI>Vis,</HI> which implyeth <HI>force,</HI> or <HI>strength;</HI> handing a Sword. <HI>Virtus,</HI> or <HI>Vertue,</HI> a sphearicall Globe: and <HI>Victoria,</HI> or <HI>Victory,</HI> a wreath of <HI>Law∣rell.</HI> The <HI>Morall</HI> is, that in all high Enterprizes there ought to be first <HI>Counsell,</HI> to undertake; then <HI>Care,</HI> to manage; and
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> <HI>Industry,</HI> to performe; and in the next place, where there is <HI>ability</HI> and <HI>strength</HI> to oppose, and <HI>Vertue</HI> to direct, <HI>Victory</HI> consequently is alwayes at hand, ready to crowne the un∣dertaking.</P>
<P>Upon the Hances of the waste are foure Figures, with their severall properties: <HI>Jupiter</HI> riding upon his <HI>Eagle,</HI> with his <HI>Trisulke</HI> (from which he darteth <HI>Thunder)</HI> in his hand: <HI>Mars</HI> with his <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Target,</HI> a <HI>Foxe</HI> being his Embleme: <HI>Nep∣tune</HI> with his <HI>Sea-horse, Dolphin,</HI> and <HI>Trident:</HI> and lastly, <HI>Aeo∣lus</HI> upon a <HI>Camelion</HI> (a Beast that liveth only by the Ayre) with the <HI>foure Windes,</HI> his Ministers or Agents, the <HI>East,</HI> cal'd <HI>Eurus, Subsolanus,</HI> and <HI>Apeliotes:</HI> the <HI>North-winde,</HI> Septentrio, Aquilo, <HI>or</HI> Boreas: <HI>the West,</HI> Zephyrus, Favonius, Lybs, <HI>and</HI> Africus: <HI>the South, Auster,</HI> or <HI>Notus.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the Stearn, where you may perceive upon the upright of the upper Counter, standeth <HI>Victory</HI> in the middle of a Frontispiece, with this generall motto, <HI>Validis incumbite remus:</HI> It is so plain, that I shall not need to give it an <HI>English interpretation:</HI> Her wings are equally displayed; on one Arme she weareth a <HI>Crowne,</HI> on the other a <HI>Lawrel,</HI> which imply <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Honour:</HI> in her two hands she holdeth two Mottoes; her <HI>right hand,</HI> which pointeth to <HI>Jason,</HI> bears this Inscription, <HI>Nava. Jason</HI> being figured with his Oare in his hand, as being the prime <HI>Argonant,</HI> and say <HI>Nava,</HI> or more plainly, <HI>Operam nava;</HI> for in those Emblematicall Mottoes, <HI>quod subintelligitur, non deest.</HI> She pointeth to <HI>Hercules</HI> on the finister side, with his <HI>Club</HI> in his hand, with this motto, <HI>O</HI> Hercules, <HI>be thou as valiant with thy Club upon the Land, as</HI> Jason <HI>is industrious with his Oare upon the Water. Hercules</HI> again poin∣ting to <HI>Aeolus,</HI> the god of <HI>Windes,</HI> saith <HI>Flato:</HI> who answereth him againe, <HI>Flo: Jason</HI> pointing to <HI>Neptune,</HI> the god of the Seas (riding upon a <HI>Sea horse)</HI> saith <HI>Favelo;</HI> to whom <HI>Nep∣tune</HI> answereth, <HI>No;</HI> These words <HI>Flo,</HI> and <HI>No,</HI> were also much excepted at, as if there had been no such Latine words, till some better examining their <HI>Gramar Rules,</HI> found out <HI>Flo, flas, flavi,</HI> proper to <HI>Aeolus,</HI> and <HI>No, nas, navi,</HI> to <HI>Neptune,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>In the lower Counter of the <HI>Sterne,</HI> on either side of the <HI>Helme</HI> is this Inscription,
<Q><L><HI>He who Seas, Windes, and Navies doth protect,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Soveraign, the great</HI> Ship <HI>in her course direct.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>There are other things in this <HI>Vessell</HI> worthy remarkable, at least, if not admiration; namely, that one <HI>Tree,</HI> or <HI>Oake,</HI> made foure of the <HI>principall beames</HI> of this <HI>great Ship,</HI> which was 44. foote of strong and serviceable <HI>Timber</HI> in <HI>length,</HI> three foote <HI>Diametre</HI> at the top, and ten foote <HI>Diametre</HI> at the stubb or bottome.</P>
<P>Another (as worthy of especiall observation is) that one piece of Timber which made the <HI>Kel-son,</HI> was so great and weighty, that 28. <HI>Oxen,</HI> and foure <HI>Horses,</HI> with much difficulty drew it from the place where it grew, and from whence it was cut downe, unto the water-side.</P>
<P>There is one thing above all these for the world to take e∣speciall notice of, that <HI>shee</HI> is, besides her <HI>Tunnage,</HI> just so many <HI>Tuns</HI> in burden, as there have been years since our <HI>Bles∣sed Saviours Incarnation,</HI> namely, 1637. and not one under, or over: A most happy <HI>Omen,</HI> which though it was not at the first projected or intended, is now by true computation found so to happen.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to insist upon every Ornament belonging to this incomparable <HI>Vessell,</HI> yet thus much con∣cerning Her outward appearance; She hath two Galleries of a side, and all of most curious carved Worke, and all the sides of the <HI>shipp</HI> are carved also with <HI>Trophies</HI> of <HI>Artyllerie</HI> and <HI>Types</HI> of honour, as well belonging to Land as Sea, with Symboles, Emblemes, and Impresses appertaining to the <HI>Art of Navigation:</HI> and thus much in a succinct way. I have deli∣vered unto you concerning her inward and outward De∣corements; I come now to describe her in her exect Dimen∣sion.</P>
<P>Her length by the Keele is 128. foote, or thereabout, with∣in some few inches. Her mayne breadth or widenesse from side to side 48. foote. Her utmost length from the fore-end of the <HI>Beake-head,</HI> unto the after end of the Sterne, <HI>a prora ad pup∣pim,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> 232. foote; Shee is in height from the bottome of her Keele to the top of her <HI>Lanthorne,</HI> seventy sixe foot, she bea∣reth five <HI>Lanthorns,</HI> the biggest of which will hold ten per∣sons to stand upright, and without shouldring or pressing one the other.</P>
<P>Shee hath three flush Deckes, and a Fore-Castle, an halfe Decke, a quarter Deck, and a round-house. <HI>Her</HI> lower <HI>Tyre</HI> hath thirty ports, which are to be furnished with Demy-Conon and whole Canon throughout, being able to beare them. Her middle <HI>Tyre</HI> hath also thirty ports for Demi-Culverin, and whole Culverin. Her third <HI>Tyre</HI> hath 26. ports for other Ordnance; her Fore-Castle hath twelve ports, and her halfe Decke hath fourteen ports; Shee hath thirteene or fourteene ports more within board for murder∣ing peeces, besides a great many Loop holes out of the Ca∣bins for Musket-shot. She carrieth moreover tenne peeces of chase <HI>Ordnance</HI> in her, right forward, and ten right off, that is according to Land-service in the front and the reare. She carrieth eleven <HI>Anchors,</HI> one of them weighing foure thou∣sand foure hundred, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and according to these are her Ca∣bles, Masts, Sayles, and Cordage.</P>
<P>I come now to give you a particular Denomination of the prime Work-men employed in this inimitable Fabrick; as first Captaine <HI>Phines Pett,</HI> Over-seer of the Work, and one of the Principall Officers; of whose knowledge, experience, and judgment, I cannot render a merited <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>The Master <HI>Builder</HI> is young Mr. <HI>Peter Pett,</HI> the most inge∣nuous sonne of so much improved a <HI>Father,</HI> who before he was full 25. yeares of age, made the <HI>Modell,</HI> and since hath perfected the <HI>worke,</HI> which hath won not only the <HI>approbati∣on,</HI> but <HI>admiration</HI> of all men, of whom I may truly say, as <HI>Horace</HI> did of <HI>Argus,</HI> that famous <HI>Ship-master,</HI> (Who built the great <HI>Argo</HI> in which the <HI>Grecian</HI> Princels Rowed through the <HI>Helle spont</HI> to fetch the <HI>goleen Fleece</HI> from <HI>Colchos.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pallas</HI> her self flew into his bosome, and not only enjoyn'd him to the undertaking, but inspired him in the managing of so exquisite anabsolute an <HI>Architecture.</HI></P>

<P>VPON <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 18. of <HI>May,</HI> 1652. in the morn∣ing, General <HI>Blake</HI> being gone to the West-ward, as far as <HI>Rye</HI> Bay eight dayes before, with twelve or thirteen Ships, leaving Major <HI>Bourn</HI> in the <HI>Downs</HI> with eight Ships only, there appeared upon the back side of the <HI>Goodwin,</HI> a <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet of Men of War, consisting of two and forty Ships, one whereof had a Flagg on the main-top-Mast head, the rest Jacks and Ancients; and being come unto the South-sands head, two of them bore up towards the En∣glish Ships in the <HI>Downs,</HI> whereupon Major <HI>Bourn</HI> sent out the
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> <HI>Greyhound</HI> to examine them, and to know the reason of their so near approach; who answering, That they had a Message to the Commander in Chief in the <HI>Downes,</HI> were permitted to come in; and having saluted the Flag, the two Captains, named <HI>Tyson</HI> and <HI>Aldred</HI> came aboard the sayd Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> and acquanted him that they were sent by <HI>Van Trump,</HI> to let him know that he had been Riding about <HI>Dunkirke</HI> with His Fleet, where by reason of foule Weather they had lost many of their Cables and Anchors, and the wind being <HI>Northerly,</HI> were driven more to the <HI>Southward</HI> then they intended, which <HI>Van Trump</HI> thought fit to signifie, to prevent any mis-appre∣hensions or Jealousies. And having said this, and received for answer, That the Reality of what they said would best appear by their speedy drawing off from this Coast, they de∣parted to their Fleet; and immediately upon their arrivall with them, the whole Fleet stood up to <HI>Dover,</HI> and came to an Anchor within little more then shot of the Castle the same day in the afternoon. Upon their coming before <HI>Dover</HI> Ca∣stle, and Riding there with Flag in the Main-top, without saluting the Castle, the Castle made three shot at them; not∣withstanding which, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admirall kept up his Flagg, and rode there at <HI>Anchor</HI> until the next day noon, and exer∣cised his Musquetiers, by discharging volleys of small shot many houres together. Upon <HI>Wednesday</HI> about twelve a clock the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet weighed Anchor, and stood off towards <HI>Calice</HI> some four Leagues into the <HI>South-east;</HI> about the same time the <HI>English</HI> Fleet under General <HI>Blake</HI> coming from the West towards the <HI>Downes,</HI> discovered them, and supposed by their course they had been going back; Major <HI>Bourn</HI> likewise was in sight, coming from the <HI>Downs</HI> to joyn with Generall <HI>Blake.</HI> About an hour or two after, the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet altered their course, came back again, made all the Saile they could, and bore directly with Generall <HI>Blake, Van Trump</HI> the head∣most with his Flag in the Main-top; and being come within shot, the Generall shot a Gun at his Main-top, and then two single shot more: whereupon <HI>Trump</HI> shot a single shot through the Generals Flag, and then immediately gave the first Broad side, and took in his Pendants, and hung out his Red Flagg
<PB N="13" REF="8"/> under the <HI>Holland</HI> Colours, which was the Signal on their part for their whole Fleet to engage, and so the Fight began, which happened between four and five a clock in the after∣noon, and continued until nine of the clock. In the Fight the <HI>English</HI> took two of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, one whereof having six foot water in the Hold they left, taking the Captain and Officers aboard, the other being a Ship of thirty Guns. Ge∣nerall <HI>Blake</HI> lay all night where the Fight began, or neere thereabouts, and the Holland Fleet was espyed about foure Leagues distant towards the Coast of <HI>France</HI> next morning.</P>
<P>The truth of this Relation appears in the Letters of Gene∣rall <HI>Blake,</HI> Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> and others in the Action, by the Examinations of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains, and other Officers ta∣ken in the Fight:</P>
<P>And whereas <HI>Van Trump</HI> in the accompt he gives of this A∣ction, makes the occasion of his coming back upon the <HI>Engl∣ish</HI> Fleet, the guarding of some Merchant men richly laden from the <HI>Streights,</HI> which had been in fight with some of our Frigots: That action is set down in a letter written by Cap∣tain <HI>Young,</HI> whereby the occasion, beginning and ending thereof is declared: And besides, these very ships which hee pretends to come to protect or rescue, upon Saturday be∣fore had passed by General <HI>Blake,</HI> and were gone to the East∣ward.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have dispatched away this Express to your Honours, to give you an account of what past yesterday between us and the <HI>Dutch Fleet</HI> being in <HI>Rye Bay;</HI> I received Intelligence from Major <HI>Bourne,</HI> that <HI>Van Trump</HI> with forty Saile was off the South-sand head, whereupon I made all possible speed to ply up towards them, &amp; yesterday in the morning we saw them at Anchor in and near <HI>Dover-Road;</HI> being come within three leagues of them, they weighed and stood away by a winde to
<PB N="14" REF="9"/> the <HI>Eastward:</HI> We supposing their intention was to leave us to avoid the dispute of the Flag; about two hours after they al∣tered their course, and bore directly with us, <HI>Van Trump</HI> the headmost, whereupon wee lay by, and put our selves into a fighting posture, judging they had a resolution to ingage be∣ing come within Musket shot, I gave order to fire at his flag, which was done thrice, after the third shot he let flie a Broad side at us; Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> with those Ships that came from the <HI>Downs,</HI> being eight, was then makingtowards us, we conti∣nued fighting till night, then our Ship being unable to saile, by reason that all our Rigging and Sailes were extreamely shattered, our Mizen-Mast shot off, we came with advice of the Captains to an Anchor about 3. or 4. Leagues of the Ness to refit our Ship, at which we laboured all the night; this morning we espyed the <HI>Dutch Fleet</HI> about foure Leagues di∣stance from ours towards the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> and by advice of a Councel of War, it was resolved to ply to windward to keep the weather gage, and we are now ready to let fall our Anchor this Tide; what course the <HI>Dutch Fleet</HI> steers wee doe not wel know, nor can we tel what harm we have done them, but we suppose one of them to be sunk, and another of 30. Guns we have taken, with the Captains of both, his Main-Mast of the first being shot by the Board, and much water in the Hold, made Captain <HI>Lawsons</HI> men to forsake her. We have six men of ours slain, and nine or ten desperately wounded, and 25. more not without danger, amongst them our Master and one of his Mates, and other Officers. We have received a∣bout 70. great Shot in our Hull and Masts, in our Sails and Rigging without number, being engaged with the whole Bo∣dy of the Fleet for the space of four hours: And the mark at which they aimed, we must needs acknowledge a great Mercy that we had no more harm, and our hope the righteous God will continue the same unto us, if there do arise a Warre be∣tween us; they being first in the Breach, and seeking an Occa∣sion to Quarrel, and watching as it seems, an Advantage to brave us upon our own Coast, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

In the afternoon we went away from the Enemie, we tooke Counsel, what hereafter we should do to fight with the Ene∣my again, and leave the Merchantmen; and that we should not discharge any Ordnance in vain, because our ammuniti∣on begun to be wanting; We did see a great way by the East of us, only with his great sail floating, the ship called the <HI>Vo∣golstruis,</HI> I did send ihe Commander <HI>Wilde</HI> with three ships af∣ter him to help him, and if unserviceable, to hale him if pos∣sible: After which, we did gather our Body together, as well our Men of War, as Merchantmen, and went our way.</P>

<P><HI>YEsterday morning being at Anchor some ten miles without the South-head of the Gober, early in the morning we discryed the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">5 Victory.</NOTE> <HI>Dutch Fleet about two Leagues to the Leeward. We made sail to∣wards them, and between 11. &amp; 12. at Noon we were engaged, and for three hours the dispute was very sharp on both sides, which con∣tinued from 3. till 6. in the evening; at which time the Enemie bore away right before the wind, and little more was done, onely the Fri∣gots gave chase so long as there was any light to distinguish one from another. One of the Dutch Admirals was blown up, and 3. or 4. sunke. We cannot hear that any of our own ships was lost in this En∣gagement, blessed be the Lord. We are at this time very fair again by them, and shall still endeavour our utmost to engage them as soone as we can. It hath pleased the Lord to take away General</HI> Dean <HI>in the fight, an honest and faithfull servant of the</HI> Common-wealth. <HI>He was slain by a great shot. In this Engagement we have spent the grea∣test part of our powder and shot; and therefore I earnestly desire you will take care that a considerable proportion may be suddenly provided us and sent, with such Victuals and Waterships as are yet behind.

After four hours dispute with them, or thereabouts, they endeavoured what they could to get away from us; but having then a pretty fresh gale of winde, we pressed so hard upon them, that we sunke and tooke many of them, as appeares by the enclosed List, and do suppose we should have destroyed most of them but that it grew darke, and being off of Ostend among the sands, we durst not be too bold, especially with the great ships, so that it was thought fit we should Anchor all night, which we accordingly did a∣bout tenne of the Clock. This morning some of our ships descried the Enemie again afar off, steering toward the Weillings, so far as with safety we might, and to range along the Coast till wee came to the Texel (the better to improve the present Victory God hath given un∣to us) unlesse we see cause to divert our course.

<P>About six years since, the <HI>Dutch</HI> being reduced to a great exigence and strait by the <HI>Indians,</HI> implored the <HI>English</HI> ayde and assistance, which immediately was sent them, under the command of Captain <HI>Ʋnderhill,</HI> a Gentleman of spirit, expe∣rience, and conduct, who prizing Christian blood beyond

<P>But Ingratitude over-clouding those Heroick Actions, and <HI>Amboyna's</HI> treacherous cruelty extending it self from the East to the West Indies, running in its proper channell of Dutch blood, quickly sought their Neighbors, their Friends their Noble Defenders, the English, Destruction; and by their unworthy inequality of retribution, have chronicled themselves Ungratefull, Perfidious, Bloody, and Cruell.</P>
<P>For about <HI>March</HI> last, 1653. with gifts and large promi∣ses they instigated and hired foure of the Grand Princes of those Territories, some of them most fierce, barbarous, and bloody people, fit Instruments for so horrid a designe, on a Sabbath day, when all Families were at Meeting, unexpe∣ctedly to fall on the English, and to burne and slay what possibly they could: and for the better perfecting of this Di∣abolicall plot, they supplyed the Indians with Armes and Ammunition, which were dispersed in all their Habitati∣ons, they having a Ship sent them on purpose from Holland, the Fountain of Treacheries, with all necessary tools for the acting of a second <HI>Amboyna</HI> Tragedy.</P>
<P>But the Omnipotent God (who hath ever beene a most mercifull protector of the <HI>English</HI> in those parts, as in the <HI>Pe∣quet</HI> War, <HI>&amp;c.)</HI> did through his infinite goodnesse, most timely before the bloody day of acting, cause an <HI>Indian,</HI> that should have been an Executioner, to be a revealing Deliverer of our Nation, who informed the Magistrates of <HI>Boston</HI> of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> bloody intentions; whereupon they requested severall Merchants of that Town with all expedi∣tion to march forth towards the <HI>Indian</HI> Habitations, to see what they could discover.
