<HEAD>JOYFULL NEWES FROM COBHAM-HALL IN KENT. Being a true Relation of such armes as were taken from thence August 20. ALSO A Discovery of such Ammunition as was taken from the Arthbishop of Canterbury <HI>Aug. 19.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Vch hath beene the providence and vi∣gilancie of this our Parliament, having been so prosperously seconded with the blessing of God up∣on their endeavours that they have been successefull even be∣yond hope, in detecting and defeating the plots of the malignant party, how cunningly soever by them contrived. Vpon the nineteenth of
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>this moneth the Parliament received informa∣tion of about an hundred and twenty pieces of Ordnance that lay neere the water side foure miles from Gravesend, which causeth the in∣habitants to watch them every night, fearing lest those which are ill-affected to the King and Parliament should possesse themselves of them or steale some of them away, many of them being so small, that they might be carried away by two or three men, which might prove very preiudiciall to the peace of that countrey: whereupon the Parliament have taken order for the securing and safe keeping of them.</P>
<P>No sooner is one pernicious designe disco∣vered, but another supplies the roome of it: for information being given to the Parliament-House, that great store of armes and ammuni∣tion was provided by that arch-ploiter of these evils, the Arch-bishop of Canterbury, and laid up in his house at Lambeth, the same evening, being friday, about two hundred Foot, and a troop of Horse were sent to search his house, wherein they found armes for foure or five hundred men, all which they tooke away from his house at Lambeth, and laid them in the Ci∣ty having little need of such ammunition for his defence, being better provided in the Tower since hee kept Court there. Vpon the same evening a troupe of Horse were sent into Kent to search some Recusants houses which were
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>suspected to have great store of armes and am∣munition, and coming to make search at Cob∣ham-Hall, they were denied entrance, and very much resisted, though little hurt was done, as is credibly reported, notwithstanding the ru∣mor of so many being hurt and slaine: after much opposition they entred the house, and found there five cart loads of ammunition, which they have taken away, intending to bring it up to London. Vpon this day also Sir John Meldrom that was sent to Hull, according to the desire of Sir John Hotham, by the Parlia∣ment, for to aid and assist him in the defence of that towne, came to the Parliament House, and acquainted them with the true state of of things there, and that Sir John Hotham hath so cleared the coasts about him by sea and land, that the Cavaliers dare not so much as to come neer the towne. As for the maior part of Yorkshire, they are so well affected to the Parliament, that when as His Maiesty had commanded all his loving subiects to repaire unto him that would aid and assist him, the chiefest of the Gentry of that countrey refu∣se to obey the said command, and are resolved to assist the Parliament against all that shall op∣pose them, profering their own persons to both Houses to maintaine the said Cause: and for that end have desired the Parliament to send such forces as might secure them in so doing.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>As the faces of all <HI>Britaine</HI> shew their hearts and inclinations, so if their hearts were trans∣parent, and as perspicuous as their faces, they would appeare fearfull of the future, were not the Representative Body of the State carefull to cure the present malady, by qualifying and tempering the distempered humours, and save the much indangered body, by cutting off some rotten and putrified members which infect, in∣fest and invade the republique: and herein consists a great part of the happinesse of this Kingdome, which (next under the Searcher of hearts) is derived unto us by the pious care and industry of the Parliament, in that they have been so successefull in discovering and searching out of the plots &amp; machinations of the adverse party, and so indulgent and friendly to all such as are well-affected to the peace and welfare of this Kingdome. Nor is there amity and friend∣ship circumscribed and terminated within this Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> but is further shewed in the unity and correspondence betwixt us and our Brethren of <HI>Scotland,</HI> though so many ill-affected spirits have endeavoured a disiunction. A further degree of our happines in this Island is to be seen in the mutuall concord betwixt us and the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> whose confederacie with this Nation hath been happy, and all their designes seconded with successe since their first union. They have lately declared their fideli∣ty
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>and good affection to the Parliament in cer∣taine letters presented to the House, wherein is intimated and declared to them their true, re∣all, and constant affection and resolution to the Parliament. Their actions shew as much as their words, which is further manifested in an overthrow given to the Fleet of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> go∣ing to aid the Bebels in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 15 of this moneth nine ships set out from <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> sailing with all speed to the coasts of <HI>Ireland:</HI> but the Lord of the seas be∣ing displeased with their intentions prospered not their proceedings, but raised a great tem∣pest which drove them back upon the coast of <HI>England<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> but fearing to come too neer by rea∣son of the Earle of <HI>Warwicks</HI> Fleet they cast an∣chor about 41. leagues distant from the <HI>English</HI> coast, and staying there two dayes by reason of a contrary wind, they espied two Flemish ships sailing neer them, which caused a great feare and jealousie in them, suspecting they would descry them to the Dutch Fleet which lay by the way as they were to saile homeward, which indeed they did, describing the number of the Spanish Fleet, and in what place they lay: which occasioned the Dutch Admirall (a terrible e∣nemy against the Spaniard) with all speed to prepare five ships of warre to hoise sail toward the Fleet of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> going himselfe in person, and coming in sight of them hanged out his co∣lours,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>and making all ready for the fight, com∣ing neer made shot against them, the fight last∣ing full two houres, and many men being slain on both sides, at last two of the Spanish ships were sunk, which dishearthed the rest, and for∣ced them to flight: the Durch Admirall cha∣sed them within six leagues of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> where he took two of them loaden with ammunition, intended for the aid of the Irish Rebels, but the other five, being swift of saile, escaped into <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords and Commons in Parliament declare. That all such persons as shall upon any pretence whatsoever, assist His Maiesty in this Warte, with Horse, Arms, Plate or Money, are Traytors to His Maiesty, the Parliament and Kingdome, and shall be brought to con∣digne punishment for so high an offence.</P>
