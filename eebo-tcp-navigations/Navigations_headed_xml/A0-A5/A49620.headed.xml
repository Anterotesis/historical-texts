<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND MOST TRVLY NOBLE LORD RICHARD LORD LVMLEY VICOVNT WATERFORD &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It were needlesse to tell you, by how many titles this little Orphan booke, claimes the honour of your Lord<SUP>ps</SUP> protection. First, by the law of nature, its parent dying in your seruice, you stand bound to bee a
<PB REF="4"/>
foster father to it; againe it haueing been my fortune to contribute something to the bringing it forth to light, it hath a new relation to you vnder the title by which I haue long agoe con∣secrated all my endeauours to your seruice. But to passe by these two, there is yet a third reason, wherby it will appeare, not the effect of choise, but of necessity, that it should come forth vnder the fauour of your name: The wellgrounded experience which you haue gained in your trauells; the exacte and iudicious account you are able to giue of the places you haue seen, which make a great part of the subiect of this booke; the mature iudgment of the interests of states, and manners of people wherof it treats, which in you is not the after fruit of age;
<PB REF="4"/>
the Gentile and courteous behauiour which you haue acquired, and which charmes all those who haue the honour to conuerse with you: These, I say, are vertues so peculier to your Person, and so conspicuous in the eyes of all the world, that the designe of this Booke being to forme the like in the rest of the Gentry of our Nation that pretend to trauell; It would bee a wrong to the publike to let it appeare vnder the Patronage of any other then of him that is the Idea of an accomplisht and consūmate Traueller. And this, I doubt not, was the reason, why the Author haueing had the honour to haue been a Gouernour to so many of the flower of our Gentry, made choise of your Lordship to be∣queath this worke vnto, by his last Will and Testament: And which
<PB REF="5"/>
imposeth vpon me a necessity, both in compliance to the memory of my worthy friend and fellow traueller, and to the duty I owe vnto your Lordship, by the honour I haue to succeed vnto him in his last engagement, to offer vp this his last worke to you, as an euer∣lasting monument of esteeme and gra∣titude, of him who while hee liued euer was, and of him who liueing euer is.</P>

<HEAD>A PREFACE TO THE READER, CONCERNING TRAVELLING.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I first set pen to Paper to handle this sub∣ject, I had not the least thought of the <HI>presse;</HI> nor of erecting my selfe into an <HI>Author.</HI> J onely discharged my me∣mory hastily of some things which J had seen, in <HI>Italy;</HI> and wrapt vp that vntimely <HI>Embrio</HI> in fiue sheets of pa∣per, for the vse of a noble person, who set me that taske. Yet this <HI>Embrio</HI> like∣ing the person for whom it was con∣ceiued, obliged me to lick it ouer and ouer againe, and bring it into better forme. Second thoughts, and succeding voyages into <HI>Italy,</HI> haue finished it at last; and haue made it what it is; <HI>A compleat Voyage,</HI> and an exact <HI>Itinerary</HI> through <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>And here I thought to haue drawne
<PB REF="8"/>
bridle and rested, after so long a iour∣ney; when a learned friend hauing per∣used this my <HI>Description</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> desired much to see a <HI>Preface</HI> to it, of my fashion, and <HI>Cōcerning Traueling.</HI> I could refuse nothing to such a freind; and haue done it here willingly, both for my owne, and my countryes sake.</P>
<P><HI>For my owne sake;</HI> to preexcuse some things in my booke, which some per∣chance may dislike.</P>
<P>For some, I feare, will quarrel with my English; and justly, seeing three long voyages into <HI>Flanders,</HI> six into <HI>France,</HI> fiue into <HI>Italy,</HI> one into <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> haue made mee, liue half of my life time in forrain countryes, to the disturbance of my owne language. Yet if J bring not home fine language, J bring home fine things: and I haue seen great Ladyes, both in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> buy finde things of <HI>chimney-sweepers,</HI> and <HI>Pedlars,</HI> that spoke but course <HI>Lombard</HI> lan∣guage, and grosse <HI>Scotch.</HI></P>
<P>Others perchance will finde fault, that J write merrily sometimes: And why not? Seeing I write to young men, and for them: and mirth is neuer so lawfull as in traueling, where it shor∣tens
<PB REF="8"/>
long miles, and sweetens bad vsage; that is, makes a bad <HI>dinnar</HI> go downe, and a bad <HI>horse</HI> go on.</P>
<P>Others will say, that I fill my booke with too much <HI>Latin:</HI> But these must be minded, that I am writing of the <HI>Latin</HI> country; and that I am caruing for <HI>Schollers,</HI> who can dis∣gest solid bitts, hauing good stomacks.</P>
<P>Others will say, J ieere now and then: And would any man haue me go through so many diuers countries, and prayse all I see? Or in earnest, do not some things deserue to be ieered? when things cannot be cured but by ieering, ieering, sayth <HI>Tertullian,</HI> is a duty: and I thinke the <HI>Cynick</HI> Philo∣sophers struck as great a blow at vice, as the <HI>Stoicks.</HI></P>
<P>Others will say, I change stile often, and sometimes ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n smoothly, someti∣mes joltingly: Tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raueled not all∣wayes vpon smooth ground, and pace∣ing horses: <HI>Swisserlande</HI> and <HI>Sauoye,</HI> are much different, from <HI>Campania,</HI> and <HI>Lombardy;</HI> and its one thing to describe a <HI>Pleasant garden,</HI> an other thing to describe a <HI>Venerable Cathe∣drall</HI>: and if in the one, and the other, we haue seueral lookes; much more
<PB REF="9"/>
ought we to haue seueral words in de∣scribing them.</P>
<P>Others will say, I affect a world of exotick words not yet naturalized in <HI>England</HI>: No, I affect them not; I cannot auoyd them: For who can speak of <HI>Statues,</HI> but he must speak of <HI>Ni∣ches?</HI> or of <HI>Churches,</HI> Wrought <HI>Tombes,</HI> or inlayd <HI>Tables;</HI> but hee must speak of <HI>Coupolas;</HI> of <HI>bassi ri∣lieui;</HI> and of <HI>pietre commesse?</HI> If any man vnderstand them not, its his fault, not mine.</P>
<P>Others will say, I hunt too much after <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and Church anti∣quityes. No, I onely meet them. And as a man cannot speak of <HI>Hercules,</HI> but he must speak of <HI>clubbs,</HI> of <HI>com∣bats,</HI> of <HI>Labours,</HI> and <HI>victories</HI>: so I cannot speak of <HI>Rome</HI> the Christian, but I must speake of <HI>Relicks, Cere∣monies,</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI> Yet I beleeue, I giue my Reader a full drought to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of prophane <HI>antiquityes, Mascarades, Shews, dressings,</HI> and <HI>passetimes.</HI></P>
<P>Others in fine will say, that I do but a thing done allready; seeing two others haue written of this subiect in <HI>English.</HI> Well; if others haue written vpon this subiect, why may not I? They did the
<PB REF="9"/>
best they could, I beleeue; but they drew not vp the ladder after them. The one writes much of <HI>Italy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. War∣cupp. M. Ray∣mond.</NOTE> and says little: the other writes little and leaueth out much; which I impute to the ones writing out of old Geographers, long after he had been there: and to the others short stay in <HI>Italy,</HI> when he was there. And if these ingenious gentlemen haue painted out <HI>Italy</HI> in <HI>busto</HI> onely, and <HI>profile;</HI> why may not I paint her out at <HI>full face,</HI> and <HI>at her full length</HI>? If they, like ancient Sta∣tuaryes, haue represented <HI>Italy</HI> vnto vs like a <HI>naked statue;</HI> I haue set her out in all her <HI>best Attire,</HI> and <HI>Iew∣els.</HI> And thus much for my owne sake.</P>
<P><HI>For my countryes sake;</HI> To read to my countrymen two profitable <HI>Les∣sons.</HI> The first, <HI>of the Profit of tra∣ueling.</HI> The second: <HI>of Traueling with profit.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. For the first, to wit <HI>the Profit of Traueling,</HI> its certain, that if this world be a great <HI>booke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The profit of trauel∣ing.</NOTE> as <HI>S. Augus∣tin</HI> calls it, none studdy this <HI>great Booke</HI> so much as the Traueler. They that neuer stirr from home, read one∣ly one page of this <HI>booke;</HI> and like
<PB REF="10"/>
the dull follow in <HI>Pliny,</HI> who could neuer learne to count further then fiue, they dwell allwayes vpon one lesson. They are like an acquaintance of mine, who had alwayes a booke indeed lyeing open upon a deske; but it was obserued that it lay allwayes open at one and the same place, and by long custome, could lye open no where else. He then that will know much out of this great booke, the world, must read much in it: and as <HI>Vlysses</HI> is setforth by <HI>Homer</HI> as the wisest of all the <HI>Gre∣cians,</HI> because he had traueled much, and had seen <HI>multorum hominum mores &amp; Vrbes, the Cittyes and customes of many men:</HI> so his sonn <HI>Telemachus</HI> is held for a very shallow witted man: and <HI>Homer</HI> giues the reason, because his mother <HI>Penelope,</HI> instead of sending him abroad to see forrain countryes, had allwayes kept him at home, and so made him a meere <HI>Onocephalus,</HI> and a homeling <HI>Mammacuth.</HI> So true is the saying of <HI>Seneca,</HI> that <HI>Imperitum est animal homo, &amp; sine magna experientia re∣rum, si circumscribatur Natalis soli sui fine.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2</HI> Traueling preserues my yong no∣bleman
<PB REF="10"/>
from surfeiting of his parents, and weanes him from the dangerous fondness of his mother. It teacheth him wholesome hardship; to lye in beds that are none of his acquaintance; to speak to men he neuer saw before; to trauel in the morning before day, and in the euening after day; to endure any horse and weather, as well as any meat and drink. Whereas my country gentleman that neuer traueled, can scarce go to <HI>London</HI> without makeing his <HI>Will,</HI> at least without wetting his <HI>hand∣kercher.</HI> And what generous mother will not say to her sonn with that an∣cient? <HI>Malo tibi malè esse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec.</NOTE> <HI>quàm molliter: I had rather thou shouldst be sick, then soft.</HI> Indeed the <HI>coral-tree</HI> is neither hard, nor red, till ta∣ken out of the Sea, its natiue home. And I haue read that many of the old <HI>Romans</HI> put out their children to be nurced abroad by <HI>Lacedemonian nur∣ces,</HI> till they were three yeares old; then they put them to their <HI>Vncles,</HI> till seauen, or tenn; then they sent them into <HI>Toscany</HI> to be instructed in <HI>Religion;</HI> and at last into <HI>Greece</HI> to studdy <HI>Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> Traueling takes my yong noble∣man
<PB REF="11"/>
four notches lower, in his self-conceit and pride. For wheras the coun∣try <HI>Lord</HI> that neuer saw any body but his Fathers <HI>tennants,</HI> and <HI>M. Par∣son,</HI> and neuer read any thing but <HI>Iohn Stow,</HI> and <HI>Speed;</HI> thinks the <HI>Lands-end</HI> to be the <HI>Worlds-end;</HI> and that all solid greatness, next vnto a great <HI>Pasty,</HI> consists in a great <HI>Fire,</HI> and a <HI>great estate.</HI> Wheras my traueling yong <HI>Lord,</HI> who hath seen so many greater men, and Estats then his owne, comes home farre more modest and ciuil to his inferiours, and farre lesse pufft vp with the empty conceit of his owne greatness. Indeed nothing cured <HI>Alcibiades</HI> his pride so much, as to see in a <HI>Map</HI> (shewd him for the nonce by <HI>Socrates</HI>) that his house and lands, of which he was so prowd, either ap∣peared there not at all, or onely a little spot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec:</NOTE> or dab: and <HI>nemo in pusillo mag∣nus.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> Traueling takes off, in some sort, that <HI>aboriginal curse,</HI> which was layd vpon mankind euen allmost at the beginning of the world; I meane, the <HI>confusion of tongues</HI>: which is such a curse indeed, that it makes men, who are of one kind, and made to be
<PB REF="11"/>
sociable, so strangely to fly one an other, that, as great <HI>S. Austin</HI> sayth, A man had rather be with his dog, then with a man whose language he vnderstands not. Nay, this diuersity of language, makes the wisest man passe for a foole in a strange country, and the best man, for an excommunicated person, whose conuersation all men auoyd. Now, traueling takes off this <HI>curse,</HI> and this moral <HI>excommunication,</HI> by making vs learne many languages, and con∣uerse freely with people of other coun∣tryes.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> Traueling makes vs acquainted with a world of our kinred we neuer saw before. For seing we are all comne from one man at first, and consequent∣ly all akinn to one another; its but a reasonable thing, that a man should, once at least in his life time, make a journey into forrain countries, to see his <HI>Relations,</HI> and visit this <HI>kinred:</HI> haueing allwayes this saying of young <HI>Joseph</HI> in his mouth; <HI>quaero fratres meos</HI></P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> Traueling enables a man much for his countryes seruice. It makes the <HI>merchant</HI> rich, by shewing him what
<PB REF="12"/>

<P>As for the <HI>Parents,</HI> their greatest care ought to be of prouideing there children (I speak to men of high con∣dition) a good <HI>Gouernour,</HI> to trauel with them, and haue a care of their <HI>Persons,</HI> and <HI>breeding</HI>: that is, play the part of the <HI>Archangel Raphaël</HI>

Seing then yong youths are the future hopes of families, and Commonwealths, their education ought not to be com∣mitted but to men of great parts and excellent breeding. For I haue allwayes thought, that a yong Noblemans train ought to be like his <HI>Clothes;</HI> His <HI>Lac∣quais</HI> and <HI>footmen</HI> are like his <HI>Ga∣loshes,</HI>

which he leaues at the dores of those he visits: His <HI>Valets de Cham∣bre,</HI> are like his night gowne, which he neuer vseth but in his chamber; and leaues them there when he goes in vi∣sits: <HI>His gentlemen attendants,</HI> are like his seueral rich <HI>sutes,</HI> which he wears not all at once, but now one, now an other, and sometimes none at all of them: His <HI>groome</HI> is like his <HI>rideing cloake,</HI> and neuer appears neare him but vpon the road: But his <HI>Gouer∣nour</HI>▪ is like his <HI>shirt,</HI> which is all∣wayes next vnto his skinn and person; and therefore as yong Noblemen are curious to haue their <HI>shirts</HI> of the finest linnen: so should they haue their <HI>Go∣uernours</HI> of the finest thread, and the best spunn men that can be found.

<PB REF="15"/>
in fine, I would haue him to be an <HI>En∣glishman,</HI> no <HI>stranger.</HI> I speak not this out of an enuy to strangers, but out of a loue to my owne countrymen. For J haue knowne diuers <HI>English gentle∣men</HI> much wrongd abroad by their <HI>Gouernours</HI> that were <HI>Strangers.</HI> Some I haue knowne that led their <HI>pupils</HI> to <HI>Geneua,</HI> where they got some <HI>French</HI> language, but lost all their true <HI>English allegiance</HI> and respect to <HI>Monarchy;</HI> others I haue knowne who, being marryed and haueing their setle∣ments and interest lyeing at <HI>Saumur,</HI> kept yong gentlemen there all the time they were abroad; and made their pa∣rents in <HI>England</HI> beleeue, that all good breeding was in that poore towne, where their wifes were breeding children. Others I haue knowne who hauing their mistresses in the country, perswad∣ed their yong <HI>pupils,</HI> men of great birth, that it was fine liuing in a coun∣try house, that is, fine carrying a gunn vpon their necks, and walking a foot. Others haue been obserued to sell their <HI>pupils</HI> to <HI>Masters of exercises,</HI> and to haue made them beleeue, that the worst <HI>Academyes</HI> were the best, be∣cause they were the best to the cunning
<PB REF="16"/>
<HI>Gouernour,</HI> who had tenn pound a man for euery one he could draw thi∣ther. Others I haue knowne who would haue marryed their <HI>pupils</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> without their <HI>Parents</HI> knowledge; and haue sacrificed their great trust, to their sordid auarice. Others J haue knowne who haue locked their <HI>pupils</HI> in a chamber with a wanton woman, and taken the Key away with them. Nay, this I can say more, that of all those <HI>strangers</HI> that I haue knowne <HI>Gouernours</HI> to yong Nobleman of <HI>England</HI> (and I haue knowne seuen or eight.) I neuer Knew one of them to be a gentleman borne; but for the most part, they were needy bold men, whose cheif parts were, their owne language and some <HI>Latin;</HI> and whose cheif ayme was, to serue themselues, not their <HI>pupils.</HI></P>
<P>But to returne againe to our subject, the <HI>Parent</HI> hauing found out such a <HI>Gouernour</HI> for his sonn, as we haue described here aboue, he must resigne ouer vnto him his full Authority, and command his sonn to obey him: other∣wise let the <HI>Gouernour</HI> be the wisest, and the most compleat man in the world, if his pupil do not obey him,
<PB REF="16"/>
and follow his counsel, all will go wrong. I haue seen great disorders befall for want of this. Hence I haue often thought of great <HI>Clemens Alex∣andrinus,</HI> who sayth wisely, that our <HI>Sauiour Christ</HI> is the onely true <HI>Pedagogue,</HI> or <HI>Gouernour,</HI> because he can not onely giue the best instruc∣tions to yong men, but also can giue them grace to execute those instructions: whereas other <HI>Gouernours (Cassandra</HI> like) telling their <HI>pupils</HI> many excel∣lent truths, are not beleeued by them; nor can they force their inclinations to execute them, except the <HI>Parents</HI> com∣mands come in to their assistance: and it is but reasonable, that as <HI>Gouernours</HI> are the <HI>Seconds</HI> of <HI>Parents,</HI> in the breeding of their children, so <HI>Parents</HI> should second <HI>Gouernours</HI> too, in makeing their children obey them. And so much for the <HI>Parents care.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>son̄s care,</HI> it must bee this. First to take a view of <HI>England</HI> before he enter into forrain countryes. This will enure him to trauel, to see company, to obserue townes and rarityes, and shar∣pen his appetite for forrain curiosi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes. I would wish him withall in traueling ouer <HI>England,</HI> to fall in, as often as he
<PB REF="17"/>
can, with the <HI>Iudges</HI> in their <HI>cir∣cuits,</HI> not onely to see how his country is gouerned in point of judicature, but allso to see the gentry of seueral coun∣tryes, who flock to great townes in the <HI>assise week.</HI> It would be allso pro∣fitable to him, to cast to be at all the cheif <HI>Horsraces,</HI> where he will ea∣sily see allso the gentry of the seuerall counties in a compendious view. Haue∣ing thus seen his owne country in a summers space, and haueing got his <HI>Majesties licence</HI> to trauel beyond the seas (in which <HI>Licence</HI> I could wish this clause were inserted, That all yong gentlemen should at their returne, present themselues to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> to giue him an account of their trauels and obseruations) I would haue him depart <HI>England</HI> about the beginning of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> At his going out of <HI>England,</HI> let him take his ayme right; that is, let him ayme altogether at his <HI>profit,</HI> and not at his <HI>pleasures</HI> onely. J haue knowne many <HI>Englishmen</HI> who for want of right ayming, haue missed the <HI>white</HI> of breeding, whole heauens breadth. For some in traueling, ayme at nothing but to get loose, from their
<PB REF="17"/>
<HI>Parents,</HI> or <HI>schoolmasters,</HI> and to haue the fingering of a pretty <HI>allow∣ance;</HI> and these men when they come into <HI>France,</HI> care for seeing no <HI>court,</HI> but the <HI>Tenniscourt;</HI> delight in seing no <HI>Balls</HI> but <HI>Tennisballs;</HI> and forsake any company, to tosse whole dayes together with a tattered <HI>Marker</HI> in the <HI>Tripot.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Others desire</HI> to go into <HI>Italy,</HI> onely because they heare there are fine <HI>Curtisanes</HI> in <HI>Venice;</HI> and as the Queen of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> in <HI>Iustin,</HI> went thirteen dayes journey out of her country, onely to haue a nights lodge∣ing with <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> so these men trauel a whole month together, to <HI>Venice,</HI> for a nights lodge∣ing with an impudent woman. And thus by a false ayming at breeding a∣broad, they returne with those diseases which hinder them from breeding at home.</P>
<P>Others trauel abroad, as our <HI>ship-boyes</HI> do into the <HI>Indies:</HI> for whiles these boyes might bring home <HI>Iewels, Pearles,</HI> ad many other things of valew, they bring home nothing but <HI>firecanes, parots,</HI> and <HI>Monkies;</HI> so our yong trauelers, whiles they
<PB REF="18"/>
might bring home many rich obserua∣tions, for the gouerning themselues, and others, bring home nothing but <HI>Fire-canes,</HI> that is, a hotspur humor, that takes fire at euery word, and talkes of nothing but <HI>duels, seconds,</HI> and <HI>esclair∣eissements:</HI> or else <HI>parots,</HI> that is, come loaden home with rubans and feathers of all colours like <HI>parots,</HI> and with a few borowed compliments in their mouths, which make them talke like parots: or els <HI>Monkies,</HI> that is, some affected <HI>cringes, shrugs,</HI> and such like Apish behauiour.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> At his embarking let him haue a special care not to carry <HI>Himself</HI> abroad with <HI>Himself</HI> in traueling. Many men, sayth <HI>Seneca,</HI> returne home no better then they went out, because they take themselues along with themselues in traueling: and as a man in a feauer, findes himself no better then he was, by changeing his bed; because he carryes his feauour with him wheresoeuer he lyes: so many yong men returne home tyred, and dirted, but not better and wiser; be∣cause they caryed abroad their bad customes and manners with them. I would then that my yong <HI>traueler</HI>
<PB REF="18"/>
should leaue behinde him all will∣fulness, and stubborness; all tenderness, and seeking his ease too much; all effe∣minatnesse and delicateness; all boyish tricks with hands or mouth, and mocking of others; all delighting in being the best man in the company; all familiarity with seruants, and meane men; all Tauernes, and intem∣perancy of eating and drinking; hauing that saying of <HI>Seneca</HI> often in his mouth, and minde; <HI>Major sum &amp; ad majora natus, quàm vt man∣cipium sim corporis mei: I am too great a man, and borne to too great things, for to become the slaue of my body.</HI> In fine I would haue him imitate that yong gentleman of whom <HI>S. Ambrose</HI> speaks; who returning home from forrain trauels, and meet∣ing with his old <HI>mistresse,</HI> a wanton woman, seemed not to know her; whereat she wondering, told him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he was such an one: it may be so, sayd he, but <HI>I am no more I.</HI> A rare Apothegme, which I would wish my yong <HI>Traueler</HI> to take for his <HI>motto,</HI> as well as this yong man for his <HI>exemple.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> Being thus got out of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB REF="19"/>
its a great question into what country he should first go, to make his aboad. The common course is, to go first into <HI>France,</HI> and then into <HI>Italy,</HI> and so home by <HI>Germany, Holand,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> as J did once: but my opinion is, that its better for a yong man to go first into <HI>Italy,</HI> and return∣ing by <HI>Germany, Holland</HI> and <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> come into <HI>France,</HI> to giue himself there the last hand in breeding. And my reason is this; For seing the intention of traueling, is to make a man a wise man, not a finical man, its better to season his minde betimes with a stayd wise breeding, then to fill it vp to the brime at first, with a phantastical giddy breeding, which hauing once gotten possession of the minde, bolts the doore on the inside, locks out all staydness, and makes my yong man delight in nothing but <HI>vanity, clothes, danceing, liueryes, bals,</HI> and such meere outsides. I would therefore haue my yong noblemans <HI>Gouernour</HI> to carry him immediatly into <HI>Italy</HI> at fifteen or sixteen, and there season his minde with the gra∣uity, and wise maximes of that Na∣tion, which hath ciuilized the whole
<PB REF="19"/>
world, and taught Man Manhood. Hauing spent two, or three yeares in Italy in learning the <HI>language,</HI> view∣ing the seueral <HI>courts,</HI> studdying their <HI>maximes,</HI> imitating their <HI>gentile con∣uersation,</HI> and following the sweet exercises of <HI>musick, painting, archi∣tecture,</HI> and <HI>mathematicks,</HI> he will at his returne, know what true vse to make of <HI>France.</HI> And hauing spent three yeares more there, in learning to <HI>fence, dance, ride, vault, handle his pike, musket, coulors &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Map, history,</HI> and bookes of <HI>Policy;</HI> he will be ready to come home at twenty, or one and twenty, a man most compleat both in body, and mind; and fit to fill the place of his call∣ing.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> I say, <HI>make true vs of France</HI>: For I would not haue my yong <HI>traueler</HI> imitate all things he sees done in <HI>France,</HI> or other forrain countryes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What to be learnt in France, and what not.</NOTE> I would haue him learne of the <HI>French</HI> a hansome confidence; but not an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpudent boldness.

He
<PB REF="20"/>
must learne of them to <HI>dance</HI> well, to get a good grace in walkeing, and saluting, as they do: but he must not dance as he walkes, as many of them do. He must learne of the <HI>French,</HI> to become any clothes well; but he must not follow them in all their Phantas∣tical and fanfaron clothings. He must learne to <HI>fence</HI> well, as they do; but I would haue his sword stick faster in the scabbard then theirs do. In fine, I would haue him <HI>open, ayry,</HI> and <HI>gallant,</HI> as they are: but not affecting to be <HI>the Gallands</HI> of all <HI>Ladyes,</HI> as they do.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What in Italy, and what not.</NOTE>So in <HI>Italy,</HI> J would haue him learne to make <HI>a fine house;</HI> but J would not haue him learne of the <HI>Italians</HI> to keep <HI>a good house.</HI> He may learne of them to be <HI>sober,</HI> and <HI>wise</HI>: but I would not haue him learne of them be <HI>gealous</HI> and <HI>dis∣trustfull.</HI> I would haue him learne of the <HI>Italians,</HI> to receiue those that visite him, with great <HI>ciuility</HI> and <HI>respect;</HI> but I would not haue him stand vpon all their little <HI>formes</HI> and incommodi∣ous <HI>puntiglios.</HI> I would haue him to be free of his <HI>Hat,</HI> as they are: but I would haue the heart
<PB REF="20"/>
to go to the Hat, as well as the hand.</P>
<P>Jn <HI>Germany</HI> I would haue him learne to offer a man a cup of wine at his comeing in;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What in Germany, and wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not.</NOTE> but I would not haue him presse so much wine vpon him, as he shall not be able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o go out againe, as they often do. I would haue him learne of them to go freely to <HI>warre</HI> for the defence of his country: but I would not haue him learne the custome of those vendible souls there, who carry their lifes to market, and serue any <HI>Prince</HI> for <HI>money.</HI> I like well their shakeing hands with you, when you first enter into their houses; but I like not their quarreling with you for not pledgeing a health of a yard long, which would ruine yours. I like very much their sin∣gular modesty and chastity, which allowes not bastards to be freemen of the most ordinary trads: but I like not their endlesse drinking in feasts, which is able to make them freemen of all vices.</P>
<P>In <HI>Holland</HI> allso I would haue him learne to keep his house and <HI>harth</HI> neat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What in Holland, and what not.</NOTE> but I would no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> haue him adore his <HI>house,</HI> and stand in such awe of his <HI>harth,</HI> as not to dare to make
<PB REF="21"/>
a fire in it, as they do. I would haue him learne of them, a spare dyet; but I would not haue him drink so much, as would keep him both in good dyet and clothes, as they do. I would haue him learne of them their great industry, and oeconomy: but not their rude exacting vpon Noblemen strangers in their Inns, for their Quality sake onely, as they do. I would haue him learne of them a singular loue to his country: but he must take heed of their clownish hatred of Nobility. Thus in all countryes I would haue my yong <HI>Traueler</HI> do, as men do at a great feast, where ther is no feare of staruing; that is, not eate greedily of all thats before him, but fall to the best meats, and leaue the worst for the waiters.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> That he may follow the foresayd rule the better, and pick out of euery country whats the best in it, let his <HI>Gouernour</HI> lead him betimes into the best company; for there the best <HI>lessons</HI> are to be learned. Now by the word <HI>best,</HI> I do not meane the greatest men in birth, but in parts. For the world is not so happy, as that the greatest men are allwayes the best: but by
<PB REF="21"/>
the word <HI>best,</HI> I meane those that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the wisest, the best bred, the best principled, the best behaued, and the most cryed vp by ciuil persons: for of such men much is to be learned: Their life is a perpetual lecture; their words so many oracles; their discourses so many wise maxims: and though yong men be not able to bring their dish with them, and clubb wit equally with these men, yet its a great matter to sit still in their com∣pany, and be a respectfull <HI>catechumen</HI> to them. For if it be true which <HI>Quintillian</HI> sayth of those that loue <HI>Cicero, Ciceronem amasse, profecisse est,</HI> its allso most certain, that a man that loues good company, must be good himself in time.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>7.</HI> And that he may be able to appeare in good company without blushing, his <HI>Gouernour</HI> must get him, as soone as he can, to speak the <HI>language</HI> of the place in hansome tearmes, and with a good accent. Next he must haue a care that he be well adjusted and set out in appa∣rel. For if anciently <HI>Iewels</HI> were called the <HI>Vshers of Ladyes,</HI> because all doores flew open to them that
<PB REF="22"/>
presented themselues so richly adorned: so now a dayes good <HI>clothes</HI> may be called <HI>mens vshers,</HI> seeing they make way for them into all companyes.

in <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Paris;</HI> the two cheif townes of long abode abroad. For let a man be of a Race as ancient as the <HI>Autocthenes</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> who sayd they were as ancient as the Earth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch.</NOTE> and let him quarter his coat of Armes with the three <HI>Lyons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and the three <HI>Flower de-lys</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> as I know a gentleman of little <HI>Britany</HI> doth, (by the grant anciently of both those kings) yet I dare boldly say this, that in <HI>Paris</HI> no colours blazon a mans nobility behind his coache so much, as three <HI>Lacquais</HI> and a <HI>Page,</HI> in a han∣some Liuery. In other townes of <HI>France,</HI> where yong gentlemen vse to liue at first, till they get the language, a couple of sadle horses would be very vsefull, both to take the ayre on, as allso to visit the gentry in the country at their summer houses, where a Man will fine great ciuilityes, and diuer∣tisments. Besides rideing out so in the fresh euenings of summer, will not onely weane my yong gentleman from little company, and the crowd of his countrymen who will be then pressing vpon him; but will allso afford his <HI>Gouernour</HI> many fine solitary occasi∣ons of plying him alone with good coun∣sels
<PB REF="23"/>
and instructions.</P>
<P N="9"><HI>9.</HI> And seing J haue touched some∣thing aboue of his seruants, and Lac∣quais, I will adde this, that seing it is none of the least blessings of a yong gent∣leman to haue good seruants about him, it belongs to his <HI>Gouernour,</HI> not onely to choose him good ones, but allso to haue power to turne away bad ones. Many men carry ouer with them <HI>English</HI> seruants, because they were their schoolfellowes, or their tennants sonns: and these are little vsefull for a long time, and euen then when a man hath most need of seruants. Besides, they are often too familiar with their masters, their old play-fellowes; and as often troublesome to their <HI>Gouernours,</HI> by takeing their yong masters part against them; and by raueling out at night, as they get their masters to bed, all that the pru∣dent <HI>Gouernour</HI> hath been working in the day time. Others carry ouer Frenchmen with them; but these often, by reason of their prerogatiue of language, which their masters want at first, get such an ascendent ouer them, that they come oftentimes to be too bold, and sawcy with them. For my
<PB REF="23"/>
part, I would haue his <HI>Gouernour,</HI> to take him new seruants in euery place he comes to stay; and those sightly, rather then too sprightly youths: Dull people are made to tugg at the <HI>oare</HI> of obedience, sayth <HI>Aris∣totle,</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iles witty people are fitter to sit at the helme of command.</P>
<P N="10"><HI>10.</HI> But I am to blame to giue aduice to <HI>Gouernours</HI> whom I suppose to be wiser men then my selfe; and therefore will end here, by wishing them a good journey, and safe returne: To the effecting of both which, I found no better secret, them that in my last journey, which was to be mounted vpon our owne horses, (fiue of vs together) and to spare for no cost: for by this means, we went at our owne rates, and eat to our owne mindes: so true is the Italian Prouerbe; <HI>Picole giornate, egrandi spese, ti conducono sano al tuo paese.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, I would haue my yong <HI>traueler</HI> make the same prayer of God, as <HI>Apollonius Thyanaeus</HI> made to the Sunn, at his going out to trauell, that is, that hee would bee so fauourable to him as to shew him all the Brauest and Best men in the world.</P>

cockered her too much, euen to make her become Wanton.

a notable profit; and for the feeding of them they keep a world of <HI>Mul∣berry trees</HI> whose leaues are the food of those little wormes, whose ex∣crement is our pride; thus, Adam like, we are clade in leaues againe, but leaues once remoued. Its rich allso in <HI>pasturage</HI> and <HI>cattle,</HI> espe∣cially in <HI>Lombardy,</HI> where I haue seen cheeses of an excessiue greatnesse, and of a Parmesan goodnesse.

as their shoulders, to help him vp, though he be but their younger brother. They are sparing in dyet, both for to liue in health, and to liue hansomly: making their bellyes contribute to the mainte∣nance of their backs, and their kitchen help to the keeping of their stable. They are ambitious still of honours, remembering they are the successors of the masters of the world, the old Romans; and to put the world still in mind of it, they take to themselues the glori∣ous names of <HI>Camillo, Scipione, Julio, Mario, Pompeo &amp;c.</HI> They are as sensible allso of their honour, as desirous of honours; and this makes them strickt to their wifes euen to gelousy, knowing that for one <HI>Cornelius Tacitus,</HI> there haue been ten <HI>Publij Cornelij</HI>; and that <HI>Lucius Cornificius</HI> is the most affront∣ing man.

Meddals of Gold, siluer, and brasse, as would haue becomne the Cabinet of any Prince.

eares, oftener then by their eyes; and scarce speake with one another, till they meete before the Parish Priest, to speake the indissoluable words of <HI>wedlock.</HI> They make chil∣dren go barehead till they be four or fiue years old, hardening them thus against rhumes and catarres when they shall be old. Hence few peo∣ple in <HI>Italy</HI> go so warme on their heads, as they do in <HI>France</HI>; men in their houses wearing nothing vpon their heads but a little <HI>calotte</HI>; and women for the most part, going all barehead in the midst of winter it self. <HI>Women</HI> here also wash their heads weekly in a wash made for the nonce, and dry them againe in the Sun, to make their hair yel∣low, a colour much in vogue here among Ladyes. The men throw of their hats, cuffs, and bandes, as well as their cloaks, at their returne home from visits, or businesse, and put on a gray coate, without which they cannot dine, or supp; and I haue been inuited to dinner by an <HI>Italian,</HI> who before dinner, made his men take of our hats and cloaks,
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>
and present euery one of vs (and we were fiue in all) with a coloured coate, and a little cap to dine in. At dinner they serue in the best meats first, and eat backwards▪ that is, they beginn with the second course, and end with boyld meat and pottage. They neuer present you with salt, or braines of any fowle, least they may seeme to reproach vnto you want of wit. They bring you drink vpon a <HI>Sottocoppa</HI> of syluer, with three or four glasses vpon it; Two or three of which are strait neckt glasses (called there <HI>caraffas</HI>) full of seueral sorts of wines or water, and one empty drinking glasse, into which you may powre what quantity of wine and water you please to drink, and not stand to the discretion of the waiters, as they do in other coun∣trys. At great feasts, no man cuts for himself, but seueral <HI>caruers</HI> cut-vp all the meat at a side table, and giue it to the waiters to be carry∣ed to the ghests; and euery one hath the very same part of meat carryed vnto him, to wit, a <HI>wing</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="32" MS="y"/>
and a <HI>legg</HI> of wild fowle &amp;c. least any one take exceptions that others were better vsed then hee. The Caruers neuer touch the meat with their hands, but onely with their knife and forke, and great Syluer spoone for the sauce. Euery man here eats with his forke and knife, and neuer touch∣eth any thing with his fingers, but his bread: This keeps the linnen neat, and the fingers sweet. If you drink to an <HI>Italian,</HI> he thanks you, with bending, when you salute him, and lets you drink quietly, without watching (as we do in <HI>England</HI>) to thank you againe when you haue drunk: and the first time he drinks after that, will be to you, in requitall of your former courtesy.</P>
<P>They count not the houres of the day as we do, from <HI>twelue</HI> to <HI>twelue</HI>; but they beginn their count from <HI>sunset,</HI> and the first houre after <HI>sunset,</HI> is <HI>one a clock</HI>; and so they count on till <HI>four and Twenty,</HI> that is, till the next sunset againe.

People of quality ne∣uer visit one another, but they send first, to know when they may do it without troubleing him they intend to visit: by this meanes they neuer rush into one anothers chambers without knocking, as they do in <HI>France</HI>; nor crosse the designes, or business of him they visit, as they do in <HI>England</HI> with tedious dry vi∣sits; nor find one another either vndressed in clothes, vnprouided in compliments and discourse, or with∣out their attendants, and traine about them. In the streets men and women of condition seldome or neuer go together in the same coache, except they be strangers, that is, of an other towne, or country: nay husbands and wifes are <HI>Seldome</HI> seen together in the same coache, because all men
<PB N="19" REF="33" MS="y"/>
do not know them to be so. In the streets, when two persons of great quality meet, as two <HI>Embassadors,</HI> or two <HI>Cardinales,</HI> they both stop their coaches, and compliment one another ciuily, and then retire; but still he that is inferiour must let the others coache moue first. If any man being a foot in the street, meet a great man, either in coache, or a foot, he must not salute him in going on his way, as we do in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> without stopping; but he must stand still whiles the other passeth, and bend respectfully to him as he goes by, and then continue his march.

<P>As for their <HI>Riches,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Riches.</NOTE> they must needs be great.

As for the <HI>Riches</HI> of particular <HI>Princes</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> I will speak of them, as I view their <HI>Stats</HI> here below.</P>
<P>In fine, as for their <HI>Religion,</HI> its purely that which other countrys call by its true name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Re∣ligion.</NOTE> <HI>Catholick</HI>; and which in <HI>England</HI> they com∣monly call, the Religion of the Papists. And though there they think to nickname the Catholick by calling him Papist, yet the well in∣structed Catholick knowing that the name of Papist, comes not from any Sectmaster, as Caluinist, Lutheran, Socinian, and Brownist doe; nor from
<PB N="21" REF="34"/>
any <HI>Sectary meeting place,</HI> as Hugo∣nots from the Gate of Hugo in Towers in <HI>France,</HI> neare vnto which they mett priuately at first to teach and dogmatise: nor from any pub∣lick sectary action, as Anabaptists, Dippers, Quakers &amp;c. do: but from the word <HI>Papa,</HI> which signifies <HI>Father,</HI> and is not the name of any one man, or Pope, but onely signifies his Fatherly office of Pastor; tho Catholick I say, is no more troubled at this name of Papist, then he was when hee was called in the late troubles, <HI>Royallist</HI> (for adhearing to the <HI>king,</HI> which is not the name of any of our kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rex est nomen of∣ficij. <HI>S. Ambr.</HI></NOTE> but his office onely) and not <HI>Crom∣wellist,</HI> which was the name of one adhearing to a particular man called <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and an vnlawfull vsurper of Power. As for the true name in∣deed, which is <HI>Catholick,</HI> it is so knowne to belong to those of the Roman Church, that besides that all those of that Church haue euer called themselues by no other name then this of Catholick, the wisest of Protestants also ac∣knowledge

it publikely to be their distinctiue name: witnesse that so∣lemne meeting at <HI>Munster,</HI> some yeares ago, about the <HI>General Peace</HI> of Christendome, where the Publick <HI>Jnstrument</HI> of that <HI>Peace</HI> sheweth plainly how that the Protestant Plenipotentiaries (the wisest men of that Religion) treated with the Pa∣pists, as some call them, vnder the name of <HI>Catholicks</HI>: and though in many other titles and denominati∣ons, they were very wary and scru∣pulous, euen to the long suspension of the Peace, yet they willingly con∣cluded, subscribed, and signed that Peace made with them, vnder the name of <HI>Catholicks.</HI> I say this onely, for to make men vnderstand, what the true name of the Religion prac∣tised ouer all <HI>Jtaly</HI> is, to-wit, <HI>Ca∣tholick.</HI></P>

spouting into the open ship on both sides, by four and twenty tunnels, makes vnder the windowes of the house such a perpetual purleing of water, (like many fountains) that the gentle noise is able to make the most iealous man sleep profundly. At the other end of the house this water yssueth out of the other end of the sayd ship, and is courteously intreated by seueral hidden pipes of lead, to walke into the house, in∣stead of running by so fast: Which it doth, and is presently led into the Cellars, and Buttery; and not onely into these, but also into the kitchen, stables, chambers, and bathing roome, all which it furnisheth with water either for necessity, or pleasure. Then being led into the curiours garden, its mett there by a world of little open channels of freestone built like knots of flowers; all which it fills brimfull, and makes euen Flowers of water. Then running vp and downe here and there among the fragrant delights of this garden, as if it had forgotten its

The old one is a poore thing; and seems to haue been built for hunters: but the new one is both neat and stately, and built vpon this occasion, as a <HI>Bishop</HI> in <HI>France</HI> told me. <HI>A spanish Embassador</HI> resideing in <HI>Paris</HI> in <HI>Henry the</HI> IV. his time, went one day from Paris to Fontainbleau, to see this <HI>French Escurial.</HI> Arriueing, he lighted after his countryes fashion, at the Chappel doore (the old Chappel) and entring in, to thank <HI>God</HI> for his saif arriual, he wondered to see so poore and dark a chappel, and asking with indignation whether this were the <HI>Casa di Dios</HI>?

the moat among the Carps, and to see how they will mumble and ium∣ble it to and fro; how others will puff and snuff and take it ill, not to haue part of it; and how in fine, they will plainly fall to blowes, and fight for it.

<HEAD>My third Voyage.</HEAD>
<P>MY third Voyage into <HI>Italy</HI> was againe by the way of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Lyons</HI>: but now by <HI>Geneua</HI> and <HI>Swisserland.</HI></P>
<P>Parting then from <HI>Lyons</HI> I passed ouer the <HI>Grand Credo,</HI> a smart hill; through <HI>Nantua</HI> standing vpon a Lake, and in two dayes came to <HI>Geneua.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Geneua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Geneua.</NOTE> like a good <HI>sinke</HI> at the bottom of three streets, is built at the bottom of <HI>Sauoye, France,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and therefore fit to re∣ceiue into it the corruption, of the Apostatas of the Roman Church.</P>
<P>The things which I saw in <HI>Geneua</HI> were these: 1. The great <HI>Church of</HI> S. <HI>Peter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The rari∣ties.</NOTE> the <HI>Cathedral</HI> anciently of the Bishop of this towne. In the <HI>Quire</HI> I saw yet remaining the <HI>Pic∣tures</HI> of the twelue <HI>Prophets</HI> on one side, and the pictures of the twelue <HI>Apostles</HI> on the other side, all en∣grauen in wood. The pictures also of the Blessed <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and <HI>S. Peter,</HI> in one of the windows. Here also I saw the <HI>Tombe</HI> of the <HI>Duke</HI> of
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
<HI>Bouillon</HI> General of the army of <HI>Germans,</HI> called then in France the <HI>Reiters,</HI> who in the battle of <HI>Aul∣neau</HI> were beaten by the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Guise</HI> and forced to fly to Geneua, haueing last 1800 of their men vpon the place, most of them with charmes about their necks, which they thought would haue made them shott free. Mounting vp to the stee∣ple, I saw a fair <HI>Bell</HI> with a <HI>Cruci∣fix</HI> cast vpon it, shewing whose it was; and four good <HI>peices of ordi∣nance,</HI> that none may say, the <HI>Church of Geneua</HI> wants <HI>Ecclesiasti∣call Cannons.</HI> And a little below in the <HI>Belfree,</HI> there liue in seueral Chambers, three or four families of <HI>husbands</HI> and wifes and sucking children begotten there; contrary to the <HI>Canons</HI> of any other Church, except those of <HI>Geneua.</HI> From the top of this Church you haue a fair prospect vpon the lake and neigh∣bouring countryes; which makes them brag here, that they can see from their steeple, into six seueral principalities, to wit, their owne, <HI>France, Sauoye, Swisserland,</HI> the
<PB N="48" REF="48"/>
<HI>Valesians,</HI> and the <HI>Franchecounty</HI>: But I told them, it would be a greater brag, to say, that they could see into no other country, or dominions but their owne. 2. I saw the <HI>Arsenal,</HI> little, but well stored with defensiue armes. They neuer forget to shew the <HI>Ladders</HI> of the <HI>Sauoyards,</HI> who attempted to surpize this towne by scaleing, but were themselues taken and beheaded <HI>à la chaude,</HI> least some <HI>Prince</HI> should haue interceded for them. 3. The <HI>Towne house</HI> with the Chamber where the <HI>Magistrats</HI> (something like the <HI>Hogen Mogens</HI> of <HI>Holland</HI>) sit in Counsel. 4. They shewd me here a <HI>Library</HI> but none of the best. 5. The admirable <HI>Trouts</HI> here, able to make the poore Apo∣statas wish for their <HI>Lent</HI> againe; were it not, that the <HI>Capons</HI> here are full as good in their kinde.</P>
<P>As for the Gouerment of this towne, it was anciently Monarchi∣cal, and the Bishop was Prince of it vnder the <HI>Duke of Sauoye</HI>: but <HI>Farel</HI> and <HI>Caluin</HI> comeing hither with their anarchical <HI>Presbyterie,</HI> droue the Bishop <HI>Peter de la Beaume</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
out of the towne; and establish∣ed there a kinde of <HI>Democratie,</HI> or rather, a kind of <HI>Aristocratie,</HI> ming∣led of Laymen and Ministers. Yet the Bishop keeps still his title, and the <HI>Chapter</HI> its reuenews and Lands, which happily lye in <HI>Sauoye</HI> out of the reach of the short iurisdiction of <HI>Geneua.</HI> Both the <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Chapter</HI> reside in <HI>Anisy</HI> in <HI>Sauoye,</HI> and officiate in the <HI>Cordeliers Church.</HI> of this <HI>Seat</HI> was Bishop the late Canonized Saint, <HI>S. Francis de Sales,</HI> a man of singular sweetness and piety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Petrus a S. Romu∣aldo in Diario.</NOTE> mingled with zeale and discretion. I haue red of him, that in his life time, he made four thou∣sand sermons to the people.</P>
<P>Hauing thus seen the little All of <HI>Geneua,</HI> I made towards <HI>Swis∣serland,</HI> leauing the <HI>Lake</HI> on my right hād;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lake of Geneua</NOTE> or rather takeing it on my right hand; for it would needs ac∣company me to <HI>Lausanna,</HI> where it tooke leaue of me, or I of it.</P>
<P>This <HI>Lake</HI> is absolutly the fairest I haue seen: its fairer then either the <HI>Lake Maior,</HI> the <HI>Lake of Como,</HI> the <HI>Lake of Zuric,</HI> the <HI>Lake of
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
Walenstat,</HI> the <HI>Lake of Jsee,</HI> the <HI>Lake of Murat,</HI> or the <HI>Lake of Garda.</HI> In some places this Lake of Geneua is eight miles broad, and well nigh fifty miles long. I haue red of a stranger, who traueling that way alone in winter, when the Lake was all frozen ouer, and couered with snow, tooke the Lake for a large plain, and rid vpon it eight, or ten miles to the towne: Where lighting at his Inn, and commending the fine plain ouer which he had ridden, was giuen to vnderstand, that he had ridden, if not in the air, at least fifteen fathom aboue ground; at which, the poore man reflecting vpon the danger he had been in, fell downe dead with the conceit of it. Thus we are troubled not onely at euils to come but at euils past; and are neuer so neare the danger of death, as when we are newly past it. No animal but man, hath this folly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lausan∣na.</NOTE>Leauing then, as I sayd, the <HI>Lake</HI> I came soone after, to <HI>Lausanna</HI> in <HI>Swisserland,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Can∣ton</HI> of <HI>Berne.</HI> Here I saw an ancient Church of a noble structure, and
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>
once a Bishops <HI>Cathedral,</HI> but now possessed by Ministers of <HI>Caluins</HI> communion; and the man that shewed vs the Church (though no <HI>Catholick</HI>) assured vs, that the <HI>re∣cords</HI> of that Church bore, that <HI>Masse</HI> had been sayd in it thirteen hundred yeares agoe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swisser∣land.</NOTE></P>
<P>From <HI>Lausanna</HI> I went towards <HI>Soleur,</HI> skirting through the <HI>Can∣tons,</HI> sometimes of <HI>Berne,</HI> someti∣mes of <HI>Fribourg,</HI> and sometimes in one dayes iourney, I passed into a Catholick Canton, and by and by, into a Protestant Canton againe: for here <HI>Catholick</HI> and <HI>Protestant Villages</HI> are mingled together, and make the country looke like the back side of a pair of tables chec∣quered with white and black. In one Village you haue a <HI>Crosse</HI> set vp, to signifie that it is <HI>Catholick</HI> belonging to the <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>Friburg</HI>; by and by in an other Village, a high flag with the picture of a <HI>Beare</HI> in it, to signifie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Berne</HI> sig∣nifies as much as <HI>Beare.</HI></NOTE> that it be∣longs to the <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>Berne,</HI> and is <HI>Protestant</HI>: and yet they liue ciuilly and neighbourly together without
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>
quarreling about Religion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Soleur,</NOTE>Passing thus a long, I came to <HI>Soleur (Soloturrum</HI> in Latin) a neat towne and Head of a <HI>Canton.</HI> They are all Catholicks here: and here it is that the <HI>French Embassadours</HI> to the <HI>Swissers,</HI> alwayes reside, as the <HI>Spanish Embassadors</HI> do at <HI>Lu∣cerna.</HI> This towne is very ancient, as the golden Letters vpon the clock testifye;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Petrus Romual∣dus in Cro∣nolog.

<P>From <HI>Soleur</HI> I went to <HI>Murat,</HI> a little towne famous for a great battle fought hard by it, by the <HI>Duke of Burgondy,</HI> and the <HI>Swissers.</HI> For the the <HI>Duke of Burgondy</HI> beseiging <HI>Mu∣rat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Murat.</NOTE> the <HI>Swissers</HI> came vpon him with a great army, and defeated him. I was told here that the Duke seeing his ar∣my defeated, and himself enuironed on one side by the Lake here; and on the other side, by the enemyes con∣quering army, chose rather to trust
<PB N="53" REF="50"/>
himself to the Lake, then to his en∣nemyes. Wherevpon spurring his horse into the Lake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lake of Murat.</NOTE> one of his Dages, to saue himself also, leaped vp behind him as he tooke water. The Duke out of feare either per∣ceiued him not at first, or dissem∣bled it till he came to the other side of the Lake which is two miles broad: The stout horse tugged through with them both, and saued them both from drowning, but not both from death. For the Duke seing in what danger his page had put him, stabbed the Page with his dagger. Poore Prince! thou mighst haue giuen an other offering of thanks giueing to <HI>God</HI> for thy escape then this; nay, thou mighst haue been as ciuil as thy horse, and haue spaired him, whom beasts and waues had saued: At least by that means, thou mighst haue saue∣ed thy owne honour, by saueing that poore page who offended rather out of feare of death, then out of malice; and thereby thou mighst haue truly sayd, that thou hadst not lost all thy men in that battle. But
<PB N="54" REF="51"/>
passion is a blind thing: Nothing is so dangerous to man, as man; and, as I obserued aboue, we are neuer in greater danger, then when we think we are past danger. The∣bones of the <HI>Burgundians</HI> slain in this battle, are seen in a great Chap∣pel, which stands a little distant from the towne, and vpon the road, with an inscription vpon it touch∣ing the time and circumstances of this defeat.</P>
<P>From <HI>Murat</HI> I made towards <HI>Zu∣ric,</HI> a head towne also of a <HI>Canton.</HI> It stands most sweetly vpon a <HI>Lake</HI> whose crystalin waters would de∣light any body else but <HI>Swissers.</HI> They are all here, <HI>Swinglians</HI>; and when <HI>Mareshal D'Estrée</HI> the <HI>French Embassadour</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> passed that way, and lodged at the great <HI>Jnn</HI> of the <HI>Sword,</HI> as he was comb∣ing his head one morning in his combing cloth, with his chamber window open, some of the townes men, who saw him (from an other opposit window) putting on that combeing cloth, and thinking it had been a Priest putting on the
<PB N="55" REF="51"/>
Amice and vesting himself for to say Masse before the <HI>Embassadour</HI> in his chamber, began with a Dutch clamour to stirre vp the people to a mutiny about the Embassadours house, and to call for the <HI>Priest,</HI> that was saying of <HI>Masse</HI>: The Em∣bassadour at first, not vnderstanding the cause of this vproare about his house, rann downe with sword in hand, and in his combeing cloth, to check the first man that should darre to enter his lodgings: but vnderstanding at last, that his comb∣ing cloth had caused this iealousy, hee laughed at their folly, and retir∣ed away contented.</P>
<P>The best things to be seen in <HI>Zu∣ric</HI> are these. 1. The neat <HI>Arsenal</HI> furnished with store of fair <HI>Cannons</HI> and armes of all sortes. 2. The great <HI>Library,</HI> but in this much lesse es∣teemed by mee, because a <HI>woman</HI> had the <HI>Key</HI> of it, and let vs in to see it. This peice of false <HI>Latin</HI> at the entrance, disgusted me with all that I saw there, and made me hasten out quickly: Good <HI>Libraries</HI> should not fall <HI>en quenoüille.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="56" REF="52"/>3. The <HI>Wheeles</HI> which draw vp water from the Lake of themselues, and empty it into seueral Pipes, &amp; so conueigh it all ouer the towne.</P>
<P N="4">4. The publick great <HI>drinking hall,</HI> where there are a world of little tables for men of seueral cor∣porations or trayds to meet at, and either talk there of their business, or make drinking their business.

There is a great <HI>Bell</HI> that rings to this meeting place euery day at two a clock, and when I heard so solemne a ringing, I thought it had been to some <HI>Church deuotion,</HI> not to a drinking assembly.</P>
<P>From <HI>Zuric</HI> I went by water, that is, vpon the lake a whole dayes iourney,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A long Bridge.</NOTE> and passed vnder a bridge of wood which crosseth quite ouer the lake for two miles.

<PB N="60" REF="54"/>
The people haue for their <HI>Prince</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Sion</HI> the cheif towne of the country. Their <HI>Valley</HI> is aboue four dayes iourney long, be∣sides their hills which are two more: Most of their little townes and <HI>Vil∣lages</HI> stand vpon hill sides, leauing all the plain country for tillage and pasturage. Their houses are low and darke, many of them hauing no windowes, and the rest very little ones. <HI>Sed casa pugnaces Curios an∣gusta tegebat.</HI> As for the people here, they are all Catholicks, sinceare honest men, of stout courage, yet of innocent liues, much snow quench∣ing their lust, and high mountains staueing of from them all luxe and Vanity, the harbingers of <HI>Vice.</HI> They haue short hair on their heads, but beards <HI>in folio.</HI> They are got so farre into the <HI>grande mode,</HI> as to weare breeches and doublets; but thats all: for otherwise their clothes looke as if they had been made by the <HI>Taylors</HI> of the old <HI>Patriarcks</HI>; or as if the fashion of them had been taken out of old hangings and ta∣pistry.

In fine, both men and wo∣men here are great and massiue, and not easily to be blowne away: so that I may iustly say of this people, as <HI>Cardinal Bentiuoglio</HI> sayd of the <HI>Swissers,</HI> that they are good for the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and the <HI>Alpes</HI> for them. One thing I obserued particularly in this windy country, which is, that they haue many natural <HI>fooles</HI> here, which makes me thinck it no vulgar er∣rour, which is commonly sayd, that the climats that are most agi∣tated with winds produce more fooles, then other climats do.</P>
<P>As for their strength,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Strength.</NOTE> vpon a de∣fensiue occasion, they can assemble forty thousand men together vnder their knowne Commanders, who are often times the Innkeepers in whose houses we lodge; but out of their owne pit they are not to be feared, haueing neither spirits, nor sinnews: that is, neither ambition, nor money, to carry on a forrain warre.</P>

<P>This towne is famous in history for the <HI>interview</HI> of two great kings here, to wit, <HI>Lewis</HI> the XII of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Naples.</HI> This interview passed with demonstrations of mutuall ciuili∣tyes, not ordinary in interviews of Princes.

<P>As for the towne it self of <HI>Genua,</HI> its most beautifull to behold:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cittye it selfe.</NOTE> many of the houses being painted on the outside, and looking as if they were turned inside out, and had their <HI>Arras hangings</HI> hung on their outsides.

<P>The <HI>streets</HI> are very narrow:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The streets</NOTE> so that they vse here few coaches, but many <HI>Sedans</HI> and <HI>Litters.</HI> This makes the noyse in the streets lesse, and the expence in the purse small∣er.

So that <HI>Genua</HI> looked in my eye like a proad yong <HI>Lady</HI> in a straight bodyed flowered gowne, which makes her looke tall indeed and fine, but hinders her from being at her ease, and take∣ing breath freely.</P>
<P>Yet I must except the <HI>Strada Noua</HI> here, which for a spirt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strada Noua.</NOTE> sur∣passeth all the streets I euer saw any where else for neatness and propor∣tion; and if it had but breath ynough to hold out at the same rate, a little longer, it would be the true <HI>Queen-street</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI>: Ordinary houses are so out of countenāce here, that they dare not appeare in this street where thers nothing but Pal∣laces,

and Pallaces as fine as art, and cost; or as <HI>Marble,</HI> and <HI>Painting</HI> can make them.</P>
<P>Haueing sayd thus much of <HI>Genua</HI> in general, I will now come to the particulars that are to be seen in it.</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Do∣mo.</NOTE>1. The <HI>Domo,</HI> or great <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>S.

<PB N="87" REF="67"/>
in his <HI>Ecclesiasticall History</HI>▪ but for the <HI>dish of Emmeraud,</HI> I find no authority for it, either in <HI>Baronius</HI> or any ancient author, that our <HI>Sa∣uiour</HI> vsed it.

<P N="2">2 After the <HI>Domo,</HI> I saw the Church of the <HI>Annunciata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The An∣nunciata.</NOTE> which draweth vp the Ladder after it for neatness. Its still in building, and not quite finished.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gli Signo∣ri Lome∣lini.</NOTE> Its thus beauti∣fyed at the cost of two Brothers Rich Gentlemen and merchands of this towne who allow the third part of their gaynes to the adorning of this Church.

The two rowes of <HI>Vast Pillars,</HI> which hold vp the roof of the Church, are so beauti∣full, being of a <HI>red</HI> and <HI>white marble,</HI> that they looke like <HI>Iasper,</HI> and rauish the beholder: They are curiously wrought and <HI>chanelled.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="88" REF="68"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Am∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sio.</HI></NOTE>3. The Churh of <HI>S. Ambrosio,</HI> be∣longing to the <HI>Jesuits</HI> is neatly ouer∣crusted with marble and guilt aboue in the roof. It wants a little lenght, for want of roome to build on: it being too neare the <HI>Doges</HI> pallace, and not daring to aduance a step further for feare of treading vpon his heels.</P>
<P N="4"><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Cyro.</NOTE>4. The Church of the <HI>Thea∣tins</HI> called <HI>S. Cyro,</HI> is very hansome, with its double row of white marble pillars, which set it out very grace∣fully. The <HI>Cloister</HI> also is very neat, and the Fathers very ciuil.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pal∣laces.</NOTE>5. The <HI>Pallaces</HI> here are most sumptuous. Those of the <HI>Strada Noua</HI> are the best, and the best of those, is that of the <HI>Prince d'O∣ria</HI>: its built vpon white round marble pillars, which support its <HI>Galleries,</HI> and those galleries let you into noble roomes adorned with all the <HI>Abellimenti</HI> of <HI>Italian Pallaces.</HI> The other <HI>Pallaces</HI> too, in this street, deserue particular mention in this my description of <HI>Genua,</HI> and may take it ill I say nothing of them; but they must excuse my breuity, and
<PB N="89" REF="68"/>
impute the fault partly to them∣selues; seeing admirable things are lyable to this inconuenience, that they are also vnexpressable.</P>
<P N="6">6. I saw also the two <HI>Pallaces</HI> of the <HI>Signori Balbi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pal∣laces of Signori Balbi.</NOTE> in the Street of the <HI>Annunciata.</HI> In the one whereof (on the left hand) I saw, among other rich things, a <HI>Looking Glasse</HI> valued at threescore thousād crowns. Its much of the size of those Looking glasses, which <HI>Seneca</HI> calls, <HI>specula toti corpori paria,</HI> that is, as bigge, and brickle, as those that looke themselues in them. The <HI>frame</HI> of it is all of syluer, set thick with a thousand little armed <HI>figures,</HI> like <HI>Cupids</HI>: as if the plain <HI>Mirrour</HI> of this Looking Glasse were the plain field where <HI>Cupid</HI> pitcheth his <HI>Tents,</HI> and begins his conquests ouer fair Ladyes. The round pillars set in the porch of this house, and the <HI>Giuochi d'acqua</HI> in the garden, will make themselues be taken notice of.</P>

Heres also a cannon of Leather so light, that a man may carry it.</P>
<P N="8">8. But that which is the most taking in <HI>Genua,</HI> is that which is out of <HI>Genua</HI>; I meane, the stately Suburbs of <HI>San Pietro in Arena,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">San Pie∣tro in Arena.</NOTE> where for a mile together, <HI>Villas</HI> adorned with marbles, painting, sta∣tues, Gardens, Arbours of Gelso∣min, Orange, and Limon trees, grotts, ponds, Giuochi d'acqua, fountains, high wales, with shades borne vp by Marble Pillars &amp;c. compose of many pallaces and gar∣dens, such a beautifull <HI>Landskip,</HI> that the whole place seemed to mee,
<PB N="91" REF="69"/>
to be the <HI>charming Paradise</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> of the <HI>Mountains</HI> anciently; and I was almost going to say, that we durst not blesse our selues, least this enchanted place should haue Vanished. The best <HI>Villas,</HI> or <HI>Pal∣laces</HI> here, are those of <HI>Hieronymo Negro,</HI> and that of the <HI>Imperiali</HI>: the first beautifyed with all the graces of <HI>Italian furniture,</HI> as also with Gardens, Walks, Ponds, Wa∣ter works, Allees &amp;c: the other, besides all these, hath an excellent <HI>Prospect</HI>: for the master of this house can see out of one window of it, twelue thousand crownes a yeare of his owne, onely in let houses. The other Pallaces here expect I should say something of them, and they deserue it well; but realy to giue them their full due, I can onely say this of them, that they aught to be seen by the eye, not described by the pen.</P>

Then entring into the <HI>Pallace,</HI> we found it most curiously adorned with ra∣rityes, and riches, sutable to the countrys humour, and the masters

Its true, when this <HI>Queen of Spayne</HI> passed from <HI>Germany</HI> into <HI>Spayne,</HI> by the way of <HI>Milan</HI> and <HI>Genua,</HI> the <HI>Gouernour of Mi∣lan</HI> told her, that she should see in <HI>d'Orias</HI> pallace here, many fine things, but all borrowed of the townsmen. Which <HI>d'Oria</HI> hearing of before hand, caused to be writ∣ten ouer the great <HI>Gates</HI> of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> where the <HI>Queen</HI> was to enter and lodge, these words in <HI>Spanish, By the grace of God, and the Kings fauour, thers nothing here borrowed.</HI> It may be, the cunning <HI>Gouernour</HI> of <HI>Milan</HI> thought by telling the <HI>Queen</HI> this, to oblige the <HI>Duke D'Oria</HI> to present some of his best things to the <HI>Queen,</HI> to shew her that they were his owne; as its sayd, the late <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Buc∣kingham</HI> did in <HI>France,</HI> by break∣ing his <HI>dyamond hatband</HI> among the Court Ladyes, who sayd he had onely borrowed it; but the wise <HI>Italian</HI> by this trick, both kept his owne, and yet satisfyed the <HI>Queen.</HI> Indeed he hath things here both too good to be giuen away, and
<PB N="94" REF="71"/>
too great to be carryed away: wit∣ness those rare <HI>Syluer tables</HI> which are in his <HI>Warderobe,</HI> one whereof weigheth twenty-four thousand pound weight. From the <HI>Pallace</HI> we were led ouer the street to his great <HI>garden</HI> vpon the hillside, where all the graces that can make vp a gar∣den, are found.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Gouerment, fashions, Wealth, strength,</HI> and <HI>Interest</HI> of <HI>Genua,</HI> I found them to be thus.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Gouerment,</HI> is <HI>Demo∣cratical,</HI> or <HI>Popular,</HI> by a <HI>Dog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (chosen euery two years) and eight <HI>Senators,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣uerment.</NOTE> who liue with him in the <HI>Pallace,</HI> and assist him with their counsell. The <HI>great Counsell</HI> here, which is the foundation of the Gouerment, consists of four hun∣dred men chosen indifferently out of all the families of the towne. These deliberate with the <HI>Signo∣ria</HI> of all things that belong to <HI>warre</HI> or <HI>peace.</HI> Anciently, as I hinted before, <HI>Genua</HI> was vnder the <HI>French</HI> domination, till <HI>Andrea D'Oria</HI> set it free. Histories write of it that <HI>Berengarius the third,</HI> and
<PB N="95" REF="71"/>
the <HI>Sarazins,</HI> so ruined <HI>Genua,</HI> that they left it swiming in its owne blood: Which ruine was forewarned by a prodigie of a fountain of blood which rann in the very streets of <HI>Genua.</HI> It had like to haue swmme a second time in its blood, when <HI>Lewis the</HI> XII of <HI>France</HI> entering into <HI>Genua</HI> victoriously with sword in hand, threatning the vtter ruine of that people; was pacifyed by the mournfull cryes of four thousand little Children, who clad in sack∣cloth and placed in the great <HI>Piaz∣za</HI> cryed out to the <HI>King</HI> in a piercing accent, <HI>Misericordia</HI> e <HI>Pieta, Mercy</HI> and <HI>Pitty.</HI> But since <HI>Genua shooke</HI> off the <HI>French Yoke</HI> it hath liued perpetually <HI>Gealous</HI> of the <HI>Frēch,</HI> especially since it discouer∣ed, some years past, diuers attempts of France against it, whiles the French had <HI>Portolongone</HI> and <HI>Piombino.</HI></P>
<P>For this reason, the <HI>Genuesi</HI> leane much to the <HI>Spanish Faction</HI>; and <HI>Fashions</HI> following <HI>Faction,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fashions.</NOTE> they leane also much to the <HI>Spanish Fashion</HI> both in humour and apparel. Hence I found here broad hats

without hat-bands, broad leather <HI>girdles</HI> with <HI>steel buckles,</HI> narrow britches with long wasted doublets and hanging sleeues, to be <HI>à la mode,</HI> as well as in <HI>Madrid.</HI> And I found all the great <HI>Ladyes</HI> here to go like the <HI>Donnas</HI> of <HI>Spayne</HI> in <HI>Guardinfantas,</HI> that is, in horrible ouergrowne <HI>Vertigals</HI> of whale-bone, which being put about the waste of the Lady, and full as broad on both sides, as she can reach with her hands, beare out her coats in such a huffing manner, that she appears to be as broad as long.

Celso,</HI> a rare picture of <HI>Raphaels</HI> hand in the <HI>Sa∣cristy.</HI> The <HI>Theatins,</HI> and the <HI>Iesuits Churches</HI> are very neat.</P>
<P N="12">12.

This Church I take to be the second in Italy for solid worke; being built all of white mar∣ble, with <HI>Iles</HI> and <HI>Pillars,</HI> Each <HI>Pillar</HI> worth ten thousand crownes, &amp; there are a hundred and threescore

There are also six hun∣dred white marble <HI>statues</HI> set round about the outside of this <HI>Church,</HI> each of them cost a thousand crownes. That of S. <HI>Bartholomeus</HI> with his skin vpon his arme; and that of <HI>Adam,</HI> are two peeces much admired, and are of the hand of <HI>Chri∣stophero Cibo.</HI> The <HI>Frontispice</HI> is not yet finished: but if that be the true designe of it, which I haue seen in pictures, in the <HI>Capucins</HI> Cloister in Rome, it will be most stately. The <HI>Church</HI> it self is sayd to be 250 cubits long. Neare the <HI>Quire,</HI> and almost in the middle of the Church, lyeth the <HI>body S. Charles Borromaeus</HI> in a low <HI>vault,</HI> turned now into a <HI>Chappel,</HI> open at the top with low <HI>rayles</HI> round about it; The inside of this <HI>Chappel</HI> is hung with hangings of <HI>cloth</HI> of <HI>gold,</HI> ouer which runns a <HI>cornish</HI> of <HI>syluer plat</HI> nayled to the wall.

a fair <HI>Crystal coffin</HI> made of seueral great <HI>squars</HI> of <HI>cristal,</HI> through which (the wodden Caze being opened by special leaue from the Archbishop) we saw his <HI>body</HI> lyeing all a long in his <HI>Episcopal robes.</HI> His <HI>face, hands,</HI> and <HI>feet,</HI> are onely seen, and his <HI>nose</HI> and <HI>lipps</HI> are shrunck and parched. The true picture of this <HI>Saint</HI> Hangs at the entrance below into this <HI>Chappel</HI>▪ and his history and wonderfull acti∣ons are hung vp in painting round about the <HI>Church</HI> on high.

<P N="16">16.

a little wheele where there is fasten∣ed some <HI>loadstone,</HI> and the little ships and coaches hauing also some peece of iron in their bottoms which touch the glasse; and so the iron running after the loadstone moued by the wheele, makes these shipps and coaches seem to moue of themselues. 9.

<P N="6">6.

Its very vsefull for the Prince when he will

go see his pretious <HI>Treasure</HI> in the old Pallace, or els go priuately and heare how iustice is ministred there. For the <HI>Great Duke Francis</HI> gaue order to <HI>Buontalenti,</HI> a rare Architect, to break a window from this <HI>Corridor</HI> into the great roome in the old pallace, where the magistrats render iustice, but yet so priuately that none should perceiue it. The Ar∣chitect did it, by setting vp there the <HI>Dukes</HI> armes at large, and breaking a window behinde them so imperceptibly, that the <HI>Great Duke</HI> through the little holes made in the <HI>six boules</HI> of <HI>his armes,</HI> could both heare and see how <HI>Iustice</HI> was rendered there by his officers. And one day hearing a poore wo∣man oppressed by an vniust sen∣tence, he sent for the Iudges, and reprehending them seuerely, he reuersed the former sentence, and hearing the cause a new himself, pronunced Sentence for the poore woman.</P>
<P N="7"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The new Pallace.</NOTE>7. This long <HI>Corridor</HI> led vs to the <HI>new Pallace,</HI> called the <HI>Palazzo di Piti,</HI> because it was begun to
<PB N="179" REF="113"/>
be built by <HI>Luca Piti,</HI> after the de∣signe of <HI>Brunellischi</HI>: but the ex∣pences growing too great for <HI>Pitis</HI> purce, it was bought by the mother of great <HI>Cosmus</HI> the II, and after∣wards carryed on by her to that perfection we now see it in, and which makes it one of the prime pallaces of <HI>Europe.</HI> The designe of it (for it is not yet all quite built▪ is to be a perfect Roman H, with double roomes on all sides. As you ascend vp to it, by an easy ascent from the street, it presents you with a fair broad side of building, in which I counted two and twenty great windows all in a row, and all a like, and all of them cheekt vp on either Fide by Sine stone pillars. The fashion of building in this pallace, as in most of the best pal∣laces of <HI>Florence,</HI> is that which they call in architecture, <HI>la ma∣niera rustica</HI>; where great freestones are made aduanceing a little one ouer the other. Entering into the Pallace, we saw the fair court; and in the end of it, the <HI>Grotta</HI> or foun∣tain with a larg basin, in which
<PB N="180" REF="114"/>
they keep fish for present vse. This Court is squar, and open onely on one side towards the gar∣den, but hedged in with a high terrasse of stone, whose top is leuel with the ground of the garden.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Garden.</NOTE> Beyond this <HI>terrasse</HI> and court, lyes a fine green spot of ground leuel with the first story of the pal∣lace, and half compassed about with a demicircle <HI>of laurel trees</HI> high and thick. Vnder these trees of the demicircle, rise vp stone seats, six rowes high, like the seats in an <HI>Amphitheater</HI>; and capable of two thousand men, who may all sit here with ease, and behold the sports of Caualry which are often exhibited vpon this fair green spot of ground by the nobility: the <HI>Great Duke</HI> and the Court behold∣ing all this from the windows of the pallace, while the rest of the <HI>nobility</HI> and <HI>Ladyes</HI> are seated con∣ueniently in the <HI>Amphitheater</HI> vn∣der the trees. The rest of this gar∣den is curiously setforth with thickets of bayes, close shady walkes, fine high open walkes ouer

looking both the towne and coun∣try, great ponds of water, a world of statues of marble and stone, a rare round basin of water, with fountains and much wetting sport; the place for birds and beasts; the curious <HI>Ice house</HI> and coole Cellar vnder it, where the melting ice dropping downe vpon the barrels of wine, refresh it so exceedingly, that in all my life time I neuer drunck so coole, as I did at the tap in this cellar. But to returne againe to the pallace, from whence this garden hath led me; from the garden, we ascended into the cham∣bers of the <HI>Great Dukes</HI> apperti∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dukes Apparti∣ment.</NOTE> and found them most sump∣tuous, both for contriuance and fur∣niture. Some of them are painted ouer head by <HI>Pietro di Cortona</HI> the prime painter now liuing: others expect his returne againe from <HI>Rome,</HI> and scorne to be painted by any hand but his: in another cham∣ber, we were showne the history of <HI>Saleucus</HI> giuing to his onely sonn <HI>Antiochus</HI> (languishing and pincing away with the loue of his mother

The best of them is that of <HI>Raphael,</HI> and painted by his owne hand. This is the best collection of pictures that euer I saw, and it belongs <HI>to Prince Leopold</HI> the <HI>Great Dukes</HI> brother, and a great <HI>Virtuoso.</HI> In the <HI>Great Dutcesses</HI> chamber, I saw

half a dozen of excellent peeces of <HI>Raphael</HI> and others. In another chamber (The <HI>Dukes Bedchamber</HI>) we saw his curious <HI>Thermometers,</HI> or weather glasses, which are most curious. In an other chamber (the doores being set open for the Nonce) we looked through sixteen cham∣bers at once, and all of them faire great roomes vpon one floore. And after all the roomes of this house (as, the <HI>coole low sommer roomes, the masking roome,</HI> the seueral appar∣timents of the <HI>Great Prince</HI> sonn of the <HI>Great Duke,</HI> and of <HI>Car∣dinal Iohn Carlo, Prince Matthias,</HI> and <HI>Prince Leopold</HI> all three bro∣thers of the <HI>Great Duke,</HI> and all lodgeing at once in this great Pal∣lace) by special fauour, we got the sight of the <HI>Great Dukes faire Di∣amond,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The famous Diamond.</NOTE> which he alwayes keeps vnder lock and key.

The <HI>Tabernacle</HI> and <HI>High Altar</HI> cost a hundred thousand crownes, and yeeld to few in <HI>Italy</HI> for neatness and state. Behinde the High Altar in the very end of the Church, is a rare picture of our <HI>Sauiour</HI> absoluing the poore woman catched in adultery.

<P N="9"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Piazza.</NOTE>9. Passing from hence ouer the bridge (where foure white marble statues representing the four seasons of the yeare stand, all made by <HI>Michael Angelo</HI>) we came to the <HI>Piazza</HI> of the <HI>Gran Duca,</HI> where
<PB N="185" REF="116"/>
I saw the <HI>Equestris statue</HI> of <HI>Cosmus</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> in <HI>Bronze,</HI> with his Vic∣toryes and prime actions in the pedestal, of the same mettal. At the corner of the old pallace in this <HI>Piazza,</HI> stands the braue <HI>Fountain,</HI> with a <HI>Neptune, Tritons,</HI> and <HI>Ne∣reides.</HI> Neare the gates of the pal∣lace here, stand two statues of more then Gygant can bulk: that of <HI>Da∣uid</HI> is the hand of <HI>Michael Angelo</HI>: and that of <HI>Hercules</HI> killing <HI>Cacus</HI> is of the hand of <HI>Bandinelli.</HI> The other statues here in the <HI>Portico</HI> hard by, are much cryed vp for rare peeces, as that of <HI>Perseus</HI> in brasse; that of the rapt of the <HI>Sabins,</HI> in marble; and that of <HI>Iudith</HI> in brasse holding a sword in one hand, and <HI>Holofernes</HI> his head in the other.</P>
<P N="10">10. Looking vp from this <HI>Piaz∣za</HI> to the top of the pallace, I be∣held the high <HI>Tower</HI> mounted thereupon. Its a hundred and fifty yards from the ground, and which is the wonder, it hath no other foundation then the wall of the pal∣lace and the top of the house: Hence its sayd, that the <HI>Florentins</HI> haue three

<P N="11">11. Going from the <HI>Piazza</HI> towards the <HI>Domo,</HI> we were pre∣sently stopt by the <HI>Church of S. Michael</HI> a square flat Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church of S.

being asked what he thought of it, answered: if S. <HI>Marke</HI> had Such a countenance as this, as its likely he had, a man might almost, for his lookes sake, beleeue all that he wrott: for neuer did I see (sayd hee) any man haue more the lookes of a good man, then this.</P>
<P N="12">12. Going from hence we were presently at the <HI>Domo.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Domo.</NOTE> This, I beleeue, was the finest Church in <HI>Italy</HI> when it was built. It was an∣ciently called S. <HI>Reparatas</HI> Church; but since it is called <HI>Santa Maria Florida,</HI> a fit name for the <HI>Cathe∣dral</HI> of <HI>Florence.</HI> The foundations and architecture of it were contriue∣ed by <HI>Arrolfo di Lapo,</HI> a <HI>Dutch∣man,</HI> and <HI>a la maniera rustica,</HI> sayth <HI>Vasari</HI> of it, In his lifes of painters. Its one of the neatest Churches without, that I euer beheld; being elad in <HI>white, red,</HI> and <HI>black mar∣ble,</HI> but its onely white plastered within, with pillars of a darke co∣loured freestone. What if the Ar∣chitect of this Church were some∣what of <HI>Diogenes</HI> his minde? and as <HI>Diogenes</HI> thought the world

would be turned vp side downe one day; so this Architect thought that the world would be turned inside out one day, and that then his <HI>Church</HI> would bee the fairest in the world, and all lined with marble: As it is, it lookes a little hypocritically; though the struc∣ture within be of a notable con∣triuance.

Entring into the little court that stands before the Church dore, you see it painted round about in <HI>Fresco</HI> by rare hands. Those peeces that <HI>Andrea del Sarto</HI> made, are the best, and his <HI>head</HI> in white marble, is set in the wall. In the <HI>cloyster,</HI> ouer the dore that goes into the Church is seen a rare picture in fresco vpon the wall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the hand of <HI>Andrea del Sarto.</HI> It represents our B. <HI>Lady</HI> with our <HI>Sauiour</HI> vpon her knee, and S. <HI>Io∣seph</HI> in a cumbent posture leaning upon a sack full stufft, and reading in a booke. The picture of the <HI>Blessed Virgin</HI> is admirable for sweetness and majesty. This picture is called <HI>La Madonna del Sacco,</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="123"/>
it got <HI>Andrea</HI> such credit, that <HI>Ti∣tian</HI> himself preferred it before all the peeces he had euer seen, and vsed often to say: that it grieued him, that he could not often satiate his sight with the beholding of so rare a picture: and <HI>Michel Angelo</HI> talking once in <HI>Rome</HI> with <HI>Raphael Vrbin</HI> concerning painters, sayd thus to him: There is <HI>vn huom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tto,</HI> a little fellow in <HI>Florence</HI> (meaning this <HI>Andrea</HI>) who had he been employed in great matters as thou art, would make thee sweat againe. <HI>Virtuosi</HI> make a great dispute which of those three painters was the most excellent: <HI>Raphael Vrbin, Mi∣chel Angelo,</HI> or <HI>Andrea del Sarto.</HI> But the wisest giue euery one his particu¦lar praise or excellency: <HI>Raphael</HI> was excellent in <HI>colori: Michel Angelo</HI> in <HI>designe:</HI> and <HI>Andrea</HI> in makeing things seeme to be of <HI>rilieuo,</HI> and looke as <HI>God</HI> made them, that is, pulpy and riseing vp like liuing flesh. Haueing thus admired the worke of <HI>Andrea</HI> we entred into the <HI>Church</HI> of the <HI>Annunciata,</HI> and there saw the curious syluer <HI>Altar,</HI> behind
<PB N="200" REF="124"/>
vpon the wall, is kept the <HI>mira∣culous picture</HI> of the <HI>Annunciation</HI> which giues the name of <HI>Annun∣ciata</HI> to this Church. The little picture of our <HI>Sauiour,</HI> about a foot and a half long, which is seen vpon the outside of the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> is of the foresayd <HI>Andreas</HI> hand, &amp; much esteemed. In this Church lyeth buryed <HI>Baccio Bandinelli</HI> a famous Sculptor, in a curious <HI>marble tombe,</HI> with his owne, and his wifes picture, engrauen in marble by his owne hand. Behinde the <HI>Quire</HI> lyes bury∣ed <HI>Ioannes di Bologna,</HI> a famous Sculptor also, as his seueral works in <HI>Florence</HI> shew him to haue been; as the <HI>Rapt</HI> of the <HI>Sabins,</HI> Before the old pallace. The <HI>Centaure</HI> in the streets. The Chappel of S. <HI>An∣toninus</HI> in S. <HI>Markes</HI> Church.

<HI>Annunciata,</HI> I went to the <HI>Church</HI> of the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> called <HI>Santa Croce.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sancta Croce.</NOTE> This <HI>Church</HI> is of a large bulk and height, but somewhat too darke. The side <HI>Altars</HI> are many, and cheeked with round pillars, and adorned with excellent pictures. The <HI>pulpit</HI> would become A <HI>Chry∣sostome,</HI> or A <HI>Chrysologue:</HI> Its of <HI>white marble,</HI> in which are grauen the most notable actions of <HI>S.

Somewhat behinde it, neere to a little doore, is the <HI>Tombe</HI> of <HI>Mi∣chel Angelo,</HI> the <HI>Trismegist</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> being the greatest <HI>Painter,</HI> the great∣est <HI>Sculptor,</HI> the greatest <HI>Archi∣tect</HI> of his time. Hence ouer his tombe, and vnder his picture, are placed <HI>three women</HI> in white marble, representing <HI>Architecture, Painting,</HI> and <HI>Sculpture,</HI> holding in their hands the seueral instruments be∣longing to these professions. If you aske me whether of the two, <HI>Paint∣ing,</HI> or <HI>Sculpture,</HI> is to be preferr∣ed, though a blind man being chosen iudge once of this question,
<PB N="102" REF="125"/>
when he was giuen to vnderstand that in the smooth painting there were head, armes, leggs, hands and feet, as well as in the bulky statue which he had felt, iudged presently for painting; yet <HI>Michel Angelo</HI> himself preferred <HI>Sculpture</HI> before <HI>painting,</HI> as the <HI>body</HI> is to be preferred before the <HI>superficies</HI> of a body. But to returne againe to the <HI>Tombe</HI> of this great <HI>artist,</HI> I found some words vpon the <HI>tombestone,</HI> but those so dull and hard to be read in that darke corner, that one in the company chose rather to make him a new <HI>Epitaphe,</HI> then read that which is written there: and it was this:
<Q><L>Cur indignemur mortales morte perire?</L>
<L>Ecce, stupor mundi! hîc Angelus ipso perit.</L></Q>
And I think the moderne <HI>Roman</HI> was of the same mind too, when he chose also to make him this Epitaph:
<Q><L>Roma mihi mortem tribuit, Floren∣tia vitam.</L>
<L>Nemo aliis vellet nasci, &amp; obire, locis.</L></Q>
<PB N="203" REF="125"/>
In the midst of this Church I found buryed an <HI>English Bishop</HI> called <HI>Catrick,</HI> who had been <HI>Embassador</HI> here from <HI>England,</HI> and likely in the time of the <HI>Council of Florence.</HI> His <HI>armes</HI> were <HI>three catts</HI> argent in a <HI>sable field.</HI> In fine, at the very end of this Church, on the left hand, stands a neat chappel with a painted <HI>Cupola,</HI> belonging to the family of the <HI>Nicolini,</HI> in which Chappel there are excellent statues and pictures.</P>

From thence I went to the Church of <HI>Santa Maria Nouella</HI> belonging to the <HI>Dominicans.</HI> Here it is, that the <HI>Councell of Florence,</HI> spoken of aboue, was held. There are many good pictures in this Church, as also diuers neat <HI>tombes</HI> of holy men and women, and others: among which that of <HI>Ioseph Patri∣arch of Constantinople,</HI> who had been the blessed occasion and instrument of reduceing the <HI>Greek Church</HI> to the right faith againe, is remark∣able.

Returning from hence along the riuer side, we came to the <HI>high pillar</HI> with the <HI>Statue</HI> of <HI>Iustice</HI> in <HI>porphyry</HI> vpon it. It was erected here, because it was in this very place where <HI>Cosmus the great,</HI> heard the news of the reduction of <HI>Siena.</HI> A witty nobleman seeing this statue of <HI>Iustice</HI> vpon so high a pillar, sayd that <HI>Iustice</HI> here was too high place∣ed, for poore men to arriue to it.

<P N="22">22. Hauing thus visited the chief things in the towne, I visited some places out of the towne; and chiefly, the <HI>Poggio Jmperiale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Poggio Imperi∣alle.</NOTE> a <HI>Villa</HI> belong∣ing to the <HI>Great Dutchesse,</HI> and about a good mile distant from the towne.

In one gallery are the true pictures of diuers late Princes of the house of <HI>Austria,</HI> of the house of <HI>Medices,</HI> and of other Princes their Allyes. In other roomes we saw a world of rare pictures, as the <HI>Venus of Titian,</HI> though I think it be but a coppy: the admirable S. <HI>Hierome</HI> of <HI>Alberto Dureo</HI>: a <HI>Magdalen</HI> of <HI>Raphaels</HI> hand: a <HI>S.

three other persons standing, or kneeling by, with weeping faces and most sad lookes; its one of the most moueing peeces that I euer beheld. Then the <HI>picture</HI> of the <HI>Assumption</HI> of our <HI>Lady</HI> in the Chappel, of the hand of <HI>Andrea del Sarto</HI>; with a world of other most exquisit pictures. The little neate <HI>Oratory</HI> in this house, called the <HI>Oratory</HI> of the <HI>Great Dutchesse,</HI> curiously inlayd into flowers by polished stones of diuers colours; that is, a whole closet of shineing marble inlayd into flowers, is the neatest little roome that euer I saw.

<P N="23"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prato-Lino.</NOTE>23.

<P>Dineing here at the <HI>Great Dukes Inn</HI> at the bottom of the hill, we went to lodge at <HI>Aquapendente,</HI> which is some 12 miles off, and the first towne of the <HI>Popes</HI> state.</P>
<P>This towne stands vpon a hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aqua∣pedente.</NOTE> from which the waters trickling downe softly are sayd to hang there, and giue it the name of <HI>Aquapendente.</HI> Of late this towne is made a Bishops Seate by the Demo∣lition of <HI>Castro,</HI> and the remooual of the Bishops Seat from thence hither, which happened vpon this

she found her <HI>purse</HI> as much spent, as her <HI>person.</HI> Whereupon being called on for the quarter rent of her chāber, and not know∣ing what to doe, she was aduised by her <HI>Confessarius</HI> to go to <HI>Car∣dinal Montalto</HI> (who gaue pub∣lick audienc thric a week to all the poore in <HI>Rome</HI>) and to beg as much of him, as would pay her little debt.

The <HI>Cardinal</HI> seeing

as much modesty in her looks as sickness in her countenance; and likeing well, that she did not go about to fright him into charity, by vrgeing the danger of being forced one day to expose her daughter to lewd courses (a common <HI>Rhetorical figure</HI> of begars in all contryes) wrote downe in a little paper, 50 <HI>crownes</HI> to be giuen to her; and folding vp the paper, he bid her carry it to his seruant below at the entrance of the pallace, who kept the <HI>Cardinals</HI> bills and payed the contents of them. She did so with humble prayers of thankfulnesse; and the seruant vpon sight of the paper, present∣ly threw her out 50 <HI>crownes,</HI> and bid her make an acquittance for it. The poore woman seing 50 <HI>crownes</HI> counted out for her who had asked but 5; and fearing least the seruant vpon sight of her hansome daughter, might haue done this by way of bribery, told him smartly, that though she were poore, yet she was honest,

and that she scorned to go by one corruption to an other. The honest seruant ciuily replyed, that he vnderstood not her words: nor I your deeds, sayd she, I asked the <HI>Cardinal 5 crownes,</HI> he grant∣ed me my request, and why then do you offer me 50 <HI>crownes</HI>? The honest seruant, to shew his innocency, shews his masters hand writeing importing 50 <HI>crownes.</HI> Then your masters hand, sayd she, for haste, out shot his in∣tentions: I asked him for 5 <HI>crownes,</HI> and more in conscience I cannot take. The seruant, though he knew his masters ge∣nerosity, yet to take all scruple from the poore woman, locked vp his monye and papers, and de∣sired the poore woman to go vp with him to the <HI>Cardinal</HI> againe, to cleare this doubt.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupes Tarpeia.</NOTE>I went first to the highest part of that Hill, called anciently <HI>Rupes Tar¦peia.</HI> It looks downe vpon the <HI>Theater of Marcellus</HI>; and is nothing so high a hill as I conceiued when I first read <HI>Liuy.</HI> For I expected to haue found here a hill at least like that in <HI>India</HI> called <HI>Dorin,</HI> which <HI>Curtius</HI> describes, <HI>Munster</HI> paints out, and <HI>Hercules</HI> could not take; but comeing to it, I found it to be a hill of that easy ascent, that I had ridden vp farre higher in <HI>Sauoy</HI> and <HI>Swisserland.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Equestris statua of Marcus Aurelius.</NOTE>2. Then returning the same way again to the <HI>piazza</HI> of the <HI>Capitol,</HI> I saw there the famous <HI>Equestris Statua</HI> of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> once

guilt ouer, but now appearing to be plain brasse. This is the <HI>noblest statue</HI> in the world; and I was going to say, <HI>the noblest statue liuing</HI>; for it seems almost to liue and breath by the workemans art: it is noble also because it represents a man so noble as <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> who was a double <HI>Emperour,</HI> being both a great <HI>Emperour</HI> and a great <HI>Philosopher.</HI></P>
<P>Hard by this <HI>Equestris statue</HI> are seen two <HI>Colossean statues,</HI> powring out two riuers, the one representing <HI>Nilus,</HI> the other <HI>Tigris.</HI> Ouer them stands a statue of <HI>Rome</HI> something like <HI>Pallas,</HI> her face is of <HI>white marble,</HI> her garments of <HI>Porphiry.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4. I viewed the two great <HI>statues</HI> of <HI>Constantin the Great</HI> in white marble, with the Horses.</P>
<P N="5">5. I saw the <HI>Milliarum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Millia∣rium,</NOTE> that is, a little pillar of stone with a great round brasen ball vpon it. This
<PB N="140" REF="220"/>
pillar stood anciently in the <HI>Fore Romano</HI> before S. <HI>Adrians Church</HI> and it was erected by <HI>Augustus Caesar.</HI> It was called <HI>Milliarium</HI> be∣cause from it the <HI>Romans</HI> counted the miles, that were from <HI>Rome</HI> to euery great City of <HI>Italy,</HI> or of the <HI>Empire,</HI> and the first mile dis∣tant from this pillar, was called <HI>primus ab Vrbe Lapis</HI>; and so of the rest.</P>
<P N="6"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conser∣uatorio.</NOTE>6.

Its almost as hard a thing to con∣ster this old <HI>Latin,</HI> as to haue wonn that <HI>Victory</HI>; and therefore Ile leaue
<PB N="142" REF="221"/>
the words to <HI>Petrus Ciaconius</HI> a flegmatick spaniard, to comment vpon. Yet I learnt out of this left handed <HI>Latin,</HI> this obseruation, that the braue <HI>Romans</HI> of the high∣est times, cared more to do well, then to speak well; and that the <HI>Roman commonwealth</HI> was turn∣ing towards her decline, when fine language was in vogue.</P>

Chariot</HI> hath got new wheels, of late, and his <HI>horses</HI> new <HI>shoos and feet,</HI> else all is old.</P>
<P N="10">10.

<P N="11">11. Then entring into the <HI>Cham∣bers</HI> and great <HI>Hall,</HI> I saw the statues of <HI>Alexander Farnese Duke</HI> of <HI>Parma</HI>: of <HI>M.

<HI>Romans</HI> now are in loue with <HI>Hani∣bal.</HI> Then the picture of the first <HI>Con∣sul Brutus</HI> commanding the death of his owne <HI>Son</HI>: that of the <HI>Tar∣quinii</HI>: that of the conquering of the <HI>Sabins</HI> &amp;c. all peeces as bold as the very actions they represent. Here also in the other <HI>Chambers,</HI> I saw some fine <HI>statues,</HI> as that of <HI>Caius Marius</HI>; that of <HI>Hercules</HI> in brasse being but yet a lad; That of <HI>Iunius Brutus</HI> in brasse; the heads in marble of <HI>Diogenes, Plato, Socrates</HI>: the <HI>Statues</HI> of <HI>Cicero, Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Plato</HI>; the <HI>brasen statue</HI> of the <HI>Woolf</HI> that gaue suck to <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus.</HI> But the <HI>best statue</HI> here, is that of the <HI>yong man picking a thorne out of his foot.</HI> Its onely of brasse, but worth its weight in gold. The story of it is this. A yong <HI>foot poste bringing</HI> letters of singular importance vnto the <HI>Senate,</HI> and pricking his foot as he ran, would not stay to pick out the <HI>thorne</HI>; but hastening to <HI>Rome</HI> with all speed, deliuered his letters in full <HI>Senate</HI> prodigiously soone, as it appeared by their dates. But then claping
<PB N="145" REF="222"/>
himself downe vpon the ground be∣fore them all, he began to pick out the <HI>thorne,</HI> in the posture you see him here. The <HI>Senate</HI> seing the haste he had made, and the payne he had endured, decreed presently that his <HI>statue</HI> in that posture, should be erected in the <HI>Capitol.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>old Romans</HI> not hauing then recompences enough for well deseruing men, or else not willing to recompence them otherwise, persuaded men, that no recompence was like to that of a <HI>statue</HI> in the <HI>Capitol,</HI> or to walke vp and downe the streets with a <HI>crowne of Laurel,</HI> or <HI>Oake leaues</HI> vpon their heads. <HI>Poore fooles! Was a crowne of leaues</HI> such an honour, when euen <HI>baudy houses and priuyes,</HI> Saith <HI>Ter∣tullian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. de Corona Milit.</NOTE> Were crowned too? Or was it such a solid honour to haue a <HI>statue</HI> in the <HI>Capitol,</HI> when <HI>geese,</HI> and <HI>woolfes</HI> were honored so too? But <HI>quod rarum, charum est.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seneca l. <HI>1.</HI> de Be∣nefi. c. <HI>13.</HI></NOTE> And as <HI>Alex∣ander the Great</HI> hearing that the <HI>Corinthians</HI> would make him a <HI>Ci∣tizen</HI> of their towne, scorned it at first: but after he had been assured
<PB N="146" REF="223"/>
that they neuer offered that honour to any man but to <HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>him,</HI> he was well pleased with that offer: so the rarity of hauing a <HI>sta∣tue</HI> in the <HI>Capitol</HI> being an honour granted to few, and those well de∣seruing men, made men think it the highest of recompences. Among those few, where <HI>Scipio,</HI> for hauing ouercomne <HI>Antiochus: Aemilius Lepidus</HI> for hauing, while he was but yet a boy, freed a <HI>Roman</HI> citizen in a battle: <HI>Metellus</HI> for sauing the <HI>Palladium</HI> out of the burning <HI>Temple of Vestae: Cornelia</HI> for hauing furnished corne to the people in a dearth, out of her owne moneys, and some few others.</P>
<P>Hauing thus seen the <HI>Capitol,</HI> I went into the Noble Church of <HI>Ara Caeli</HI> which is joyning to the <HI>Capitol</HI> vpon the same hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ara Caeli.</NOTE> and built in the same place where an∣ciently stood the <HI>Temple of Iupiter Capitolinus,</HI> or <HI>Jupiter Feretrius.</HI> Here it was the <HI>Sibylle</HI> shewed vnto <HI>Au∣gustus Caesar,</HI> at the birth of our <HI>Sauiour,</HI> that a greater <HI>Lord</HI> then he was borne; where vpon <HI>Augus∣tus</HI>

forbad, that any man should call him <HI>Lord</HI> from that time for∣ward. In this Church is the Tombe of S. <HI>Helen</HI> Mother of <HI>Constantin the Great.</HI></P>
<P>Descending from hence by the <HI>marble staires,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Iesuits Church.</NOTE> which are a hundred in all, and all so large, that twelue men in a breast may go vp at once, I came to the <HI>Jesuits</HI> Church and house called the <HI>Casa Professa.</HI> The <HI>Church</HI> is neate and capacious, the <HI>Chappels</HI> well painted, and the ornaments in the Vestery Very rich.

<P>Passing from hence, I stept into the <HI>Pallace of S. Mark,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Marks Pallace.</NOTE> belonging to the <HI>state of Venice,</HI> and the lodgeing place alwayes of the <HI>Venetian Embassadors</HI> resideing in the <HI>Court of Rome.</HI> This pallace, as also that

of the <HI>Cancellaria,</HI> and that of <HI>Far∣nese,</HI> are sayd to haue been built of the stones that were taken from the great <HI>Amphitheater</HI>; and yet a great part of it remanes still; and I I beleeue, as much as would make three more such pallaces.</P>
<P>From S. <HI>Marks Pallace</HI> I went towards the <HI>Mount Quirinal</HI> now called <HI>Monte Cauallo,</HI> and as I went, passed through that part of the towne which anciently was called <HI>Forum Traiani,</HI> and there saw that which <HI>Traian</HI> himself neuer saw, to wit, the wonderfull <HI>pillar</HI> of white marble erected there to <HI>Traian,</HI> and therfore called <HI>Colonna Traiana,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Colonna Traiana</NOTE> but neuer seen by him: for he dyed in forrain expeditions returning from <HI>Persia</HI> without euer seeing it.

On the top of all this pillar where anciently bury∣ed the ashes of <HI>Traian</HI> the <HI>Empe∣rour</HI>: but <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI> caused, in place of them, the <HI>statue in brasse guilt of S.

Here to fore all the <HI>basis</HI> of it was buryed vnder ground in the ruines, but now they haue diggd about it and cleared it; yet by this we may see how much the streets of <HI>Rome</HI> are higher then they were; <HI>Rome</HI> now being built vpon the ruines of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>From hence going vp the hill I came to the <HI>Pallace</HI> and garden of <HI>Aldobrandini.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pal∣lace of Aldobran¦dini.</NOTE> The house is but little yet neatly furnished with <HI>statues</HI> and <HI>pictures.</HI> Some whereof are these: An <HI>old picture</HI> made in the time of the <HI>Pagans</HI> represent∣ing <HI>a mariage</HI> after the old <HI>Romans</HI> fashion.

the sommer euenings, they play at <HI>ballon,</HI> a manly exercice much vsed in <HI>Italy,</HI> and farre more gentile then our rude football sport.</P>
<P>Neare to this pallace stand the <HI>Popes stables</HI> where I saw all the <HI>Genets</HI> that had been presented to the <HI>Pope,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Popes stables.</NOTE> since his creation, by the <HI>king of Spaine</HI> for the kingdome of <HI>Naples</HI>; euery yeare one, with a purse of gold.

<P N="1">1. The dry <HI>Well</HI> into which S. <HI>Pudentiana</HI> put many <HI>Relicks</HI> of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> to conserue them. I looked into it with a <HI>lighted taper</HI> let downe in a string, and saw many curious <HI>relicks</HI> desked vp in the side of the wall.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>woodden Altar</HI> vpon which <HI>S. Peter</HI> sayd <HI>Masse</HI> at his being here.</P>

<P N="4">4. The neat <HI>Chappel</HI> of the <HI>Cae∣tani,</HI> with the back of the <HI>Altar</HI> in white marble curiously cut by <HI>Oli∣uieri</HI> in a <HI>bass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rilieuo,</HI> representing the <HI>adoration of the Magi.</HI></P>

<P>Going from hence by a little vn∣frequented street running vnder the foot of <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tecauallo, I</HI> came to the <HI>Church of S.

<P>Then following that fair street, I went to <HI>Sancta Maria della Vittoria</HI> so called from the victory wonn in the <HI>battle of Prague.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Santa Maria della Vit∣toria.</NOTE> The <HI>flags</HI> and <HI>cornets</HI> taken in this battle are set round about the <HI>Church</HI>▪ in one of the <HI>flags,</HI> ouer the dore, I found <HI>Crosse Keys, Cardinals Caps, Miters</HI> and <HI>Priests corned caps</HI> all turned topsy turuy, with this single motto, <HI>Extirpentor.</HI> Here are very neat Chappels especially that on the left hand, where is seen the represen∣tation of S. <HI>Teresa</HI> wounded by a <HI>Seraphin.</HI> Its an admiraole peece

<P>Before the dore of the forsayd <HI>Church,</HI> stands the great <HI>Fountaine,</HI> called <HI>Fontana Felice,</HI> where the <HI>Aqueduct of Sixtus Quintus</HI> (who before his assumption to Ecclesiasti∣cal dignities, was called in his Mo∣nastery <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra Felice</HI>) disburdeneth it self into a great stone <HI>basin,</HI> and from thene is carryed into diuers parts of the towne.</P>
<P>From hence <HI>I</HI> went to the garden of <HI>Montalto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gar∣den of Montalto</NOTE> which is hard by. This is one of the best gardens in <HI>Rome,</HI> and therefore deserues well to be seen.</P>
<P>At your entrance into it, you see a <HI>round table</HI> of a blewish stone, vpon which the <HI>armes</HI> of the house of <HI>Montalto</HI> are engrauen; at which while you gaze curiously and neare at hand, the gardiner, by pressing his foot vpon <HI>a low iron pump</HI> vnder the table, presseth out water on all sides of that round table, and well-cometh
<PB N="168" REF="234"/>
the strangers that come to see his garden.</P>
<P>Then mounting into the little <HI>Pal∣lace</HI> neare that dore, <HI>I</HI> saw diuers good <HI>pictures</HI> and <HI>statues,</HI> of the house of <HI>Montalto,</HI> and others. There also I saw a <HI>wooden organ,</HI> pipes and all, and yet of no vngreatfull sound. There also <HI>I</HI> saw the <HI>picture of Dauid</HI> killing <HI>Goliath</HI>: It turnes vpon a <HI>frame,</HI> and shews you both the fore∣side of those combatans, and their backsides two, which other pictures do not. Here are curious <HI>Vrnes</HI>; the true <HI>busto of sixtus</HI> V. <HI>a tabernacle</HI> of richstones. There is a <HI>pictures in stones</HI> of seueral colours, which held one way, represents nothing but a <HI>bunch</HI> of <HI>hearbs</HI>; but held vp an other way, it represents <HI>a mans head</HI> and <HI>face.</HI> in fine here is in this little pallace, a neat <HI>Library</HI> in a coole roome, ouer the dore of which, on the in side, are written these words: <HI>Medicina ani∣mi</HI>; as if <HI>Libraries</HI> were nothing but <HI>phisick</HI> gardens for the minde.</P>
<P>Descending againe into the <HI>garden I</HI> saw store of wetting sports, and water workes, most curiously cōtriue∣ed:
<PB N="169" REF="234"/>
&amp; most stately walkes. From hence we went to the <HI>Carthusians Church</HI> which is hard by. This <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Monastery</HI> are built vp∣on the ruines of the <HI>Bathes</HI> of <HI>Dio∣cletian.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bathes of Diocle∣tian.</NOTE> For this cruel <HI>Emperor</HI> with his associat <HI>Maximian,</HI> condemned <HI>forty thousand Christians</HI> to worke in this building for the space of fifteen yeares together, and afterwards condemned many thousands of them to death for their <HI>religion.</HI> Thus men work for <HI>Tyrants.</HI> But such is the wonderfull prouidence <HI>of God: Churches of Christians</HI> now stand where <HI>Christians</HI> were con∣demned to death and torments. The blood of these <HI>martyrs</HI> was but the seed of <HI>Christians</HI>; and when <HI>Diocle∣tian</HI> condemned <HI>Christians</HI> to worke here, me thinks he did but bid them go lay the foundation of a <HI>Monastery</HI> for <HI>Carthusians,</HI> and of a <HI>Church</HI> for the worship of that <HI>God</HI> he so much persecuted.</P>
<P>Hauing seen this <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Mo∣nastery,</HI> I went to see the <HI>Popes Gra∣neries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Popes Graneries</NOTE> vast buildings two stories high, and alwayes full of <HI>wheat</HI> for the

present vse of the whole city. A world of officers and ouerseers be∣long to these <HI>Graneries,</HI> and are alwayes turning ouer, and keeping the vast heapes of wheat from spoyl∣ing and corrupting. By sticking vp <HI>canes</HI> in the <HI>heapes of wheat,</HI> they can tell, smelling at the ends of these <HI>canes,</HI> whether the wheat begin to moisten and corrupt, or no, and accordingly giue order either to turne it, and ayre it, or presently to giue it out to the <HI>bakers.</HI> These <HI>Graneries</HI> were also built vpon the ruines of <HI>Diocletians Baths.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church of S.

<P>Close by stands the <HI>Church of S. Constantia</HI> an other holy primitiue Virgin. Here I saw the famous <HI>Tombe,</HI> commonly called <HI>Bacchus
<PB N="171" REF="235"/>
his Tombe,</HI> but falsely, seing it was the <HI>Tombe of S. Constantia.</HI> Its a vast <HI>arca,</HI> or <HI>Chest</HI> of one <HI>Porphyrie</HI> stone, aboue half a foote thick, and six foot long. Its all cut on the outside with <HI>a basso rilieuo</HI> in a most admirable manner.</P>
<P>From hence crossing ouer the fields, I went to <HI>Borghesis Villa</HI> and gar∣den,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burghesis Villa.</NOTE> which are a little half mile from the towne. This is the greatest <HI>Villa</HI> thats about <HI>Rome.</HI> For here you haue store of <HI>walkes,</HI> both open and close, <HI>fish ponds, vast cages for birds, thickets of trees,</HI> store of <HI>fontaines, a park of deere</HI>; a world of <HI>fruit trees. statues of all sizes, banqueting places Grottas, wetting sports,</HI> and a stately <HI>pallace</HI> adorned with so many rare <HI>statues</HI> and <HI>pictures,</HI> that their names make a booke <HI>in octauo,</HI> which I referre you to. As for the pallace it selfe its compassed on both sides by a fair <HI>demicircle</HI> of <HI>statues,</HI> which stand before the two dores, like old <HI>Pena∣tes</HI> and <HI>Lares.</HI> The <HI>wall</HI> of the house is ouercrusted with a world of <HI>Anticallie,</HI> or old <HI>marble peeces</HI> of <HI>antiquity</HI>: as that of <HI>Curtius</HI> spurring

into the <HI>Vorago</HI>: that of <HI>Europa</HI> hurryed away by <HI>Iupiter</HI> becomne a <HI>Bull,</HI> with a world of such like <HI>fables.</HI> Entring into the house I saw diuers roomes full of curiosityes.</P>
<P>In the <HI>great hall</HI> stands the <HI>statue of Diana in Oriental Alabaster,</HI> which was once à <HI>Deity</HI> adored by <HI>Augustus Caesar.</HI> Here also hang two great <HI>pictures,</HI> the one representing <HI>a Caualcata</HI> when the <HI>Pope</HI> goeth abroad in ceremony; the other a <HI>Caualcata</HI> when the <HI>Great Turke</HI> goeth abroad in pompe.</P>
<P N="2">2. In an other roome stands the <HI>statue</HI> of one of the famous <HI>gladiators</HI> anciently, who fought alone against twenty others, and being wounded to death seems to threaten with his lookes all his beholders. Its terri∣bly well made.</P>
<P N="3">3. In one of the chambers aboue, is the <HI>head in profile of Alexander the Great</HI> cut in marble.</P>
<P N="4">4. In an other roome below I saw the <HI>Statue of Seneca</HI> bleeding to death. Its of a black stone like <HI>Ieat,</HI> then which nothing can be blacker but the crimes of <HI>Nero the Ma∣gistricide,</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="236"/>
who put this rare man his master to death.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>statue also of Daphne</HI> and <HI>Apollo in alabaster; Apollo</HI> running after <HI>Daphne,</HI> and she stiffening into <HI>a tree</HI> being ouer taken: her <HI>fingers</HI> shooting into <HI>branches,</HI> and her <HI>toes</HI> into <HI>rootes,</HI> are admirably well done. It must be <HI>Berninis</HI> worke.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>statue also of Aeneas</HI> car∣ryeing his old <HI>Father Anchises</HI> vpon his back out of <HI>burning Troye.</HI> The yong man is brawny and strong; the old man is made leane and weake: as also the yong man shews a great deale of tender affec∣tion towards his Father; and the <HI>Father</HI> as much feare in his lookes.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>Statue also of Dauid</HI> sling∣ing <HI>at Goliath.</HI> He frownes so terri∣bly as he slings, that you would sweare he intends to fright him with his <HI>lookes,</HI> and then kill him with his <HI>sling.</HI> These two last statues are also of the hand of <HI>Caualier Bernini.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. In an other chamber aboue <HI>I</HI> saw the <HI>Great Chair</HI> which lock∣eth fast any man that sitteth downe
<PB N="174" REF="237"/>
in it. Its sayd to be a chair of <HI>re∣uenge,</HI> or a <HI>trap-chaire</HI> for an enemy: but me thinks it would be a fine chaire for <HI>a restlesse student,</HI> or a <HI>gossiping wife.</HI></P>
<P>I saw here also Some <HI>toyes</HI> for yong men; as the clock which being wound vp playeth a tuneable dance, and little men and women of iron painted hansomely, dance in a ring to that tune by vertue of the wheeles. The <HI>fooles paradise,</HI> repre∣senting first a fine green <HI>garden of flowers,</HI> then a <HI>pallace,</HI> and lastly a neat <HI>Library,</HI> is made also to re∣create children.</P>
<P>Returning from this <HI>villa</HI> by the back dore which leadeth to the <HI>Porta del Populo, I</HI> stept into the <HI>Church of Madonna del Popu∣lo.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Madon∣na del Po∣pulo.</NOTE> This Church hath been much beautifyed of late by <HI>Pope Alexander the VII,</HI> because of some of his ancestors buryed here.

theory <HI>of Sculpture,</HI> if he would but haue durtyed his fingers with that durty art. In a chappel neare the <HI>Ghospelside</HI> of the <HI>High Altar</HI> I saw a good picture of the hand of <HI>Guido Rheui.</HI> Where now the <HI>High Altar</HI> stands, stood anciently the <HI>Tombe of Nero.</HI></P>
<P>Going on from hence on the left hand, towards the <HI>Piazza di Spa∣gna,</HI> I first passed by the great <HI>Guglia,</HI> or <HI>Egyptian pyramid</HI> carued all ouer with <HI>Hieroglyphs.</HI> Its looked vpon by three streets, and seene a farre off.

<P>Mounting from hence on the left hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vil∣la of the great Duke.</NOTE> to the top of the hill by the coach way, I went into the <HI>Ʋilla</HI>

most men here liuing alone in their houses and chambers.

was bare: and the other had a glasse, or half spectacle before it held on by a small wyar from vnder his hat. Half his hat was a narrow three-fingered-brimd hat, with a little half feather vpon the brim: the other half of it was a broad brim with out so much as a hat band.

Half of his face looked white with meale and pouder: the other half looked black and tawny. Half of his doub∣let was white satin with an open sleeue and a world of shirt huffing about his wrist and half of his waste: the other half was of black freeze with a black taffetty sleeue close and strait to the arme, and a hanging sleeue of freeze.

them to forbid thē to go in coaches in the day time; or to stirre out of dores in the night?

vnchast women, in their very profes∣ing themselues to be such before the Aedils</HI>; I cannot but think it a great punishment to Christian whores (who are at least as sensible as the heathens, of the horrible disgrace of haueing their name listed) to be thus defamed for euer, by remaining whores vpon Record. Is it not a punishing of them, to depriue them all their life time (as long as they liue <HI>whores</HI>) of the holy <HI>Sacra∣ments</HI>; and after their death, of <HI>Christian Burial</HI>? Is it not a pu∣nishment, and a deterring of them from vice, to throw their bodyes when they dye, into an obscure place out of the walls of the towne, as if they deserued no other Burial place then that of <HI>Asses</HI>?

<P>But why doth not the <HI>Pope</HI> punish them home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiect.</NOTE> and roote them quite out by banishment?</P>
<P>This hath been attempted by diuers <HI>Popes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ.</NOTE> and namely by <HI>Pius Quintus of happy memory</HI> (as <HI>Thua∣nus</HI> in his history writes) but seeing greater inconueniences, and greater sinns arose vpon it, prudence, which is the salt that must season all moral actions, thought it not fit to carry on that rigour; nor yet allow of fornication neither.

<P>But the <HI>Pope</HI> being both a <HI>Tempo∣ral,</HI> and an <HI>Ecclesiastical Superiour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiect.</NOTE> is bound, in my mind, to break through all respects, and settle in∣nocency in the world.</P>

<P>Not farre from hence stands the <HI>Pallace of Farnesi</HI> belonging to the <HI>Duke of Parma.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pal∣lace of Farnese.</NOTE> Before it stands a noble <HI>piazza</HI> with two rare <HI>foun∣tains</HI> in it.

The forme of it is square, and it hath in the midst of euery square, a great dore letting you into the court. This Courtis built vpon pillars and arches, with a faire open gallery aboue letting you into seueral appartiments. In this Court <HI>I</HI> saw the famous statue of <HI>Hercules</HI> leaning vpon his club, which was found in the <HI>Thermae of

There is an other statue of <HI>Hercules</HI> opposit to it, and iust like it, but not so good, being but a copie of the former. The other statues here of the two <HI>Floras,</HI> the two <HI>Gladiators,</HI> and others, are excellent peeces. Mounting vp the great stairs to go into the chambers and open Gallery, I saw the curious <HI>Statue</HI> of the <HI>boy</HI> and the <HI>Dolphin</HI>: and at the dore of the great <HI>Hall,</HI> the statues of two <HI>Parthian captiue Kings.</HI> Entring into that <HI>hall</HI> I met presently with the rare statue of <HI>Alexander Farnesi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sta∣tue of Alexan∣der Far∣nesi.</NOTE> <HI>Duke of Parma,</HI> trampling vpon two prostrate statues represent∣ing <HI>Heresy</HI> and <HI>Rebellion</HI>; while <HI>Fame</HI> crownes him. All these four seueral persons are of white marble, and of one entire stone. Its pitty that such a statue stands not in some more pub∣lick place, to teach men to beware of the <HI>mother</HI> and the <HI>daughter, He∣resy</HI> and <HI>Rebellion</HI>; and shew them, what long hands <HI>Kings</HI> haue. In the same <HI>Hall</HI> I saw the two excellent

An other roome full of pictures of choyce hands, and a curious table of <HI>pietre commesse</HI> about 12 foot long &amp; 5 wide. Then the rare <HI>Gallery</HI> of <HI>sta∣tues,</HI> with the roof of it painted most

admirably by the rauishing hand of great <HI>Hannibal Caraccio,</HI> and con∣taining the representation of the loues of the <HI>Heathen Gods and God∣desses.</HI> This painting may be com∣pared, yf not preferred, before all the <HI>Galleryes</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> or <HI>Europe</HI>; and the very cutts of it in paper pictures, sold at the <HI>stationers</HI> shops, are most admirable, and worth buying.

<P>Then mounting vp into an appar∣timent ouer the former, I saw diuers chambers exquisitly furnished with pictures, and lesser statues. In the long gallerie there are diuers rare peeces of the hand of <HI>Caraccio.</HI> In the other roomes many ancient cu∣rious things, as an ancient peece of painting found in <HI>Adrians Villa</HI> and made fifteen hundred yeares agoe; an other ancient picture of <HI>Eugenius the IV</HI> studyeing, and <HI>S.

you had better giue him à <HI>Iulio</HI> be∣times to be rid of him, then heare another long and new fable.</P>
<P>Going from hence into the great <HI>Piazza</HI> againe, I stept into the house of the <HI>signori Pighini,</HI> which stands ouer against the <HI>Pallace of Far∣nesi,</HI> to see two statues, the one of <HI>Venus,</HI> the other of <HI>Adonis</HI>; both ancient ones, and so rarely made, that the <HI>Earle of Arondel,</HI> late <HI>Lord Marshal of England,</HI> offered twelue thousand crownes for them, but was refused.</P>

<P>Returning from hence I went to <HI>S.

<HI>Naples</HI> thought the day of <HI>Iudge∣ment</HI> had been at hand.

The light of this <HI>Lamp</HI> was very gratefull vnto vs; and I am confi∣dent, a <HI>Puritan</HI> himself, were he here, would be glad to see this <HI>Lampe</HI> and <HI>Picture,</HI> and loue them better for it euer after. All the way of this <HI>Grotta</HI> is very euen and Leuel, but hugely dusty; as a roome must be, that hath not been sweept these sixteen hundred yeares. The people of the country meeting here in the

darke, know how to auoyd one an∣other, by going from <HI>Naples</HI> on the right hand; and returning on the left; that is, by keeping on the <HI>moutain</HI> side going, and returning on the <HI>Sea</HI> side: and this they ex∣presse by cryeing out often; <HI>A la Montagna,</HI> or, <HI>a la Marina; To the mountain side, or to the Sea side,</HI> to giue notice whether they come, or go. Our guide vnderstood the word, and he giuing it vnto mee, and I to my next man, it rann through our whole <HI>Brigade,</HI> which consisted of a dozen horsemen in all. Almost all the way we rid in it, we shut our eyes, haueing little vse of them; and our mouths and noses too, for feare of being choked with the dust: so that our exteriour senses being thus shut vp, our interiour begā to worke more freely, and to think of this odd place. My thoughts, comeing newly from <HI>Sannazarius</HI> and <HI>Ʋirgils</HI> tombes, fell presently vpon <HI>Poetry</HI> (for all this country is a <HI>Poetical</HI> country) and I began to think whether this were not <HI>Polyphemus</HI> his <HI>den,</HI> because <HI>Homer</HI> makes it to haue been neare

the <HI>Seaside,</HI> as this is; and capable of holding great heards of sheep as this also is. Sometimes I thought that it might haue been here, that <HI>Iupiter</HI> was hidden from his deuour∣ing <HI>Father Saturne,</HI> who came into <HI>Italy</HI> for certain; as also because <HI>So∣phocles</HI> makes mention of <HI>Iupiter Pausilipus.</HI> But at last I concluded that this was the place where the merry <HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Goddesses,</HI> after their iouial <HI>suppers,</HI> playd at <HI>hide</HI> and <HI>seek,</HI> without being hood-winckt. By this time we began to see the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> end of the <HI>Grotte</HI> a farre off, by a little light which grew greater and greater till at last we came to the yssue of it.</P>
<P>Being got out of this <HI>Cymmeran</HI> rode, we began to open our eyes againe to see if we could find one an other; and our mouths too to dis∣course vpon this <HI>exotick place.</HI> Thus we rid discourseing vpon this won∣der, till we came to the <HI>Grotta del Cane</HI> a new wonder.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grotta del Cane.</NOTE></P>
<P>Arriueing there we presently had a <HI>dog</HI> ready (though for the most part the <HI>doggs</HI> here runn whineing
<PB N="293" REF="295"/>
away when they see a troupe of strangers arriue) and saw the expe∣riment of that famous <HI>Grotta,</HI> which being but three yards within the side of the hill, may be seen without entring into it. The experiment is this. A man takes a <HI>dog</HI> aliue, and holding downe his head with a woodden forke to the ground, the <HI>dog</HI> begins first to cry, and then to turne vp the white of the eyes, as if he would dye. Then letting him hold vp his head againe, he reco∣uers. And haueing thus, twice, or thrice, shewed vs the experience of this infectious place, he putts downe the <HI>dogs</HI> head againe, and holds it downe so long, till the <HI>dog</HI> seems to be dead indeed. Then takeing him by the stiff leg, and running with him to the <HI>Lake Agnano,</HI> some forty paces off, the throws him into the shallow water of this <HI>Lake,</HI> and presently he begins to recouer, and to wade out. They would make vs beleeue, that as it is the nature of this <HI>Grotta</HI> to kill: so it is the nature of this <HI>Lake</HI> to reuiue dead things
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
againe. But if the <HI>dog</HI> were dead indeed, all the water of <HI>Agnano,</HI> though it were <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> would not recouer him: he is onely astoni∣ed with the <HI>infectious vapor</HI> which breatheth out of this <HI>Sulphurious</HI> ground below. The pestilent na∣ture of this <HI>Grotte</HI> was shewd vs plainly by a <HI>lighted torch,</HI> which as long as it was held high from the ground, burnt clearly: but as it was approached by little &amp; little, neare to the ground, it grew dimmer and dimmer, till at last it burnt blew, and being held close to the ground, it went quite out.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The stones of <HI>S.</HI> Gen∣naro.</NOTE>Then we were showne hard by, the <HI>stones of</HI> S. <HI>Gennaro,</HI> which by a natural <HI>sulphurious vapour</HI> yssueing strongly from low causes, put a man presently into a sweat, and are ex∣cellent remedyes for the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> disease, called by some authors, <HI>Campanus Morbus: Nature,</HI> an <HI>indul∣gent mother,</HI> thinking her self bound to afford a remedy to the discorders which she her self hath enclined the <HI>Neapolitans</HI> vnto.</P>
<P>Then fetching about the hills by

a norrow vnfrequented way, we came to the <HI>Conuent of Capucins</HI> standing there where <HI>S.

<P>From hence we descended downe into the <HI>Sulphatara,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sul∣phatara.</NOTE> where the burn∣ing <HI>Sulphur</HI> smokes out perpetually from vnder ground. This <HI>Sulphatara</HI> is a kind of pit enuironed on all sides with banks, and it is about 1500 foot long and 1000 broad. We rid downe into it on horseback, and it sounded hollow vnder our horses feet, as if we had been rideing ouer a <HI>woodden bridge.</HI> There are diuers <HI>spiracula,</HI> or <HI>Vents</HI> round about it, out of which the thick smoke presseth furiously, as out of a fornace; and makes <HI>Poets</HI> and <HI>Potters</HI> finde matter enough; those for their <HI>Fa∣bles</HI> calling it, <HI>Forum Vulcani</HI>: These for their <HI>Medicinal pots,</HI> which they make of this brinstony earth.</P>
<P>Neare to <HI>Sulphatara</HI> stands a round <HI>poole</HI> of black thick water,

which alwayes boyleth; and what soeuer you throw into it, it comes out boyled indeed, but not entire; something or other of it being alwayes diminished, sayth <HI>Leandro Alberti.</HI> One putting in four eggs in a long ladle, pulled out but three againe: I wonder <HI>Poets</HI> faigned not this <HI>Lake,</HI> to be that part of hell alotted to punish <HI>vsurers,</HI> seing it takes vse for euery thing thats put into it.</P>
<P>Descending from <HI>Sulphatara</HI> to <HI>Puzzolo,</HI> we wondered to see the very high way smoke vnder our horses feet, when yet we found not them so fiery vnder vs: but I found the smoke to come out of little chinks of the dryed ground: which shewd vs that the whole country was on fire vnder vs. Before we came to the towne, we saw the remnants of a faire <HI>Amphitheater,</HI> and <HI>Ciceros</HI> Academy.</P>
<P>Immediatly after this we came to <HI>Puzzuolo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Puzzuo∣lo.</NOTE> so called, either from the multitude of <HI>springs</HI> about it; or els a <HI>putore,</HI> from the <HI>smell</HI> which this brinstony country affords. The

towne is but little, yet anciently a <HI>Bishops Seat.</HI> Takeing boat here presently, we passed ouer the creek of the Sea to <HI>Baiae,</HI> which is three miles from hence; and as we rowd along, I admired the wild designe of <HI>Caligula</HI> who built a bridge from <HI>Puzzuolo</HI> to <HI>Baiae</HI>: some of the <HI>Ar∣ches</HI> yet standing on both sides, show vs that his folly was real: and I beleeue <HI>Suetonius</HI> meant this worke, when he taxeth the <HI>insanas substruc∣tiones, the mad buildings</HI> of this <HI>Em∣perour.</HI> That which contributed much to the bold attempt; was the nature of the <HI>sand</HI> of this country, which made into <HI>morter</HI> and let downe into the water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pliny, and Vitrunius</NOTE> grows hard and solid, euen to petrify there at last. <HI>Puteolanus puluis, si aquam attigit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baiae.</NOTE> <HI>saxum est.</HI></P>
<P>Reaching the other side of the <HI>bay,</HI> and leauing our boate to attend vs, we rambled for an hour and a half among the <HI>Antiquityes</HI> of this ruined <HI>Paradise</HI> of <HI>Baiae</HI>: for you know, <HI>Nullus in orbe locus Baiis praeluxit amaenis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="298"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mercato di Sabato.</NOTE>First we were led to the <HI>Mercato di Sabato,</HI> looking still like a <HI>street</HI> with ruines of houses on both sides.</P>
<P>Thence we went to the <HI>Elisian Fields,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Eli∣zian Fields.</NOTE> which are much beholding to <HI>Poets</HI> for their fame: otherwise they are but a very common plot of ground without any gracefulness at all, except onely that if <HI>Baiae</HI> were a towne still, a man might make a fine <HI>Bowling ground</HI> here.

<P>Thence we came presently to the <HI>Piscina Mirabili,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Piscina Mirabili.</NOTE> a vast building vnder ground, borne vp by forty or fifty great squar <HI>pillars,</HI> lōg 150 paces, 40 wide, &amp; 30 high. We descened into it by many steps, &amp; its so well walled with stone and lime on all sides, that water cannot sink through. and all this was onely to keep fresh water in, either for the <HI>Roman Gal∣lyes</HI> that vsed to lye hereabouts in these harbours; or els for the

<HI>Romans gusto</HI>; who hauing their cu∣rious <HI>Villas</HI> here abouts, had no mind to drink of the springs of this bi∣tuminous country. At the top of this <HI>Piscina Mirabili,</HI> I espied some spoutes of stone yet remayning, by which they vsed to let the water from aboue into this <HI>Vast Reseruer.</HI></P>
<P>Returning againe, we were showne the <HI>Promontory</HI> of <HI>Misenum</HI> a farre off; and the <HI>Mare Mortuum</HI> hard by.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Promont: Miseni. Mare mortuum. Cento Ca∣merelle.</NOTE></P>
<P>Then we went into the <HI>Cento Ca∣merelle,</HI> so called from a hundred <HI>little roomes</HI> that were built together like chambers within one an other, to keep <HI>slaues</HI> in, who serued the <HI>Gallyes.</HI></P>
<P>Going againe towards our boate, we were showne the place where <HI>Agripina</HI> should haue been drowned by a false bottomed boate: but that fayling, her sonn <HI>Nero</HI> caused her to be stabed here.

For being foretold, when she was with child of <HI>Nero,</HI> that she had in her wombe a <HI>son</HI> who should be <HI>Emperor,</HI> but withall, who should kill her, she cryed out: <HI>Occidat modò imperet: Let him kill me, so he bee but Emperor</HI>; and she had her wish. Its sayd also that this <HI>Par∣ricide</HI> (for, <HI>Nero nunquam sine publici paricidii praefatione nominandus est, sayth Valerius Maximus</HI>) after his mother was killed, would needs haue her ript vp, that he might see where he had lodged nine months together: and I beleeue that nothing hastened more the conspiracy of the <HI>Romans</HI> against him, then rhat they could now no longer endure him, who could not endure his owne <HI>mother.</HI> Hard by the <HI>Shoare</HI> stands yet the <HI>Tombe</HI> of that vnfortunate <HI>Princesse.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Agrippi∣nas Tombe</NOTE></P>
<P>Then taking boate againe we rowed by the ruines of <HI>Marius,</HI> and <HI>Caesars Villas,</HI> and diuers others <HI>scrapps</HI> of <HI>antiquity,</HI> and all along in the water (in a cleare day) you may see the foundations of <HI>Baiae,</HI> and

<P>Rowing on still by the <HI>Shoare,</HI> we came to the foot of <HI>Neros Pallace</HI> neere to the ruines of which, stands mounted a strong <HI>Castle,</HI> built <HI>a la moderna,</HI> vpon a high Hill.

<P>Then we went hard by to <HI>Ciceros bathes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciceros bathes.</NOTE> a great squar place, where anciently were written ouer head in old letters, the <HI>names of the diseases</HI> which these waters cured: which letters some <HI>Physitians</HI> caused to be defaced, pretending that they where <HI>superstitious characters</HI>; when indeed they where vnwilling men should be cured by anything, but the strange <HI>characters</HI> in their <HI>recipes.</HI></P>

into the long <HI>Grotte,</HI> and presently put into a sweat by a stifling heat which mett vs violently in that <HI>long entry.</HI> I followed my guide, and findeing the steme to be choking, I stouped downe low behinde the guide, to let him break the hot ayre before me.

Thus, <HI>Antëus</HI> like, fetching now and then succour from my <HI>mother earth,</HI> I found <HI>humility</HI> to be a safe remedy. In the middle of this long <HI>narrow Entry</HI> theres a place, for those that stand in need of sweating, to stand on, stradling wide, and so sweat abundantly. They told me that at the end of this <HI>Grotta,</HI> there are <HI>bathes</HI> of souerain <HI>Vertue</HI>; but I being well without them, had no minde to be choked in seeking out health.</P>
<P>Returning from hence we had a huge walke of it to the <HI>Lacus Auer∣nus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lacus Auernus.</NOTE> made by the Riuer <HI>Acheron, idest, sine gaudio</HI>: a fit name for the riuer

<P>Leauing this <HI>Lake</HI> on our right hand, we made towards the <HI>Grotte</HI> of <HI>Sibylla Cumaea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grot∣te of Si∣bylla Cu∣maea.</NOTE> so called from the <HI>City Cumae,</HI> which stood not farre off▪ this long <HI>Grotta</HI> was once a <HI>subter∣ranean passage</HI> to the <HI>City of Cumae,</HI> (as that of <HI>Pausilipus</HI> is yet to <HI>Na∣ples</HI>) and the <HI>Sibylles Grotte</HI> is that little darke Entry which stikes out of the long <HI>Grotta.</HI> This leads you to the <HI>Chamber</HI> of the sayd <HI>Sibylle</HI> and her <HI>bathes.</HI> Its a fine retireing place for a <HI>chaste mayd,</HI> that fears as well <HI>to see,</HI> as to be seen:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertull.</NOTE> <HI>Tam timet Videre, quam videri</HI> and such the <HI>Sybills</HI> were; who for their <HI>Virgi∣nyties</HI> sake, had the <HI>guift of Prophecy</HI> giuen them, sayth <HI>S.

<P>Then takeing our boat againe we returned to <HI>Puzzuolo,</HI> and at night to <HI>Naples</HI>; where we stayd but one day more, as well to rest our horses, as to see <HI>the silk shops,</HI> where they make curious silk <HI>wastcoats, stokings, scarfs</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>In an other voyage to <HI>Naples,</HI> in our returne to <HI>Rome</HI> we made little excursions, to take in some places about <HI>Rome,</HI> which we had not seen before, as <HI>Albano, Castel Gandulfo, Frescati,</HI> and <HI>Tiuoli,</HI> which lay al∣most in our way.</P>

<P>This is all I can remember, though not halfe I saw in this <HI>Treasory:</HI> and hauing thanked the ciuil <HI>Priest</HI> that shewed vs this fine place, we went out againe into the <HI>great Church</HI>; where I obserued vpon the <HI>great Pillars</HI> that make the <HI>Iles</HI> of this <HI>Church,</HI> the <HI>history</HI> of the <HI>Holy House</HI> engrauen in stone, or written in patchment in a fair text-hand, in twelue or thirthen seueral languages, for the vse of the <HI>Pil∣grims</HI> who flock hither from all countryes.</P>

They are all hooped with iron, and some of them are so contrived, that they can draw three seueral sortes of wine, out of one <HI>Vessel,</HI> and by the same tap. The expe∣rience is pretty, but the wine is bet∣ter. Now whether these <HI>Vessels</HI> be too many, or the <HI>revenues</HI> of the

<HI>Holy House</HI> too great, you may easily coniecture, when so many persons are fed dayly, as I mentioned a∣boue, and so many thousand pil∣grims passe so frequently that way. <HI>Turselinus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In his hist. of Lo∣reto l. <HI>3. c. 25.</HI></NOTE> writs, that between <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Whitsontide,</HI> there haue flock∣ed thither; sometimes <HI>fiue,</HI> some∣times <HI>Six hundred thousand commu∣nicants</HI>; and in two dayes space in <HI>September</HI> (about the <HI>Feast</HI> of the <HI>Nativity of our Lady</HI>) there haue ap∣peared <HI>two hundred thousand commu∣nicants,</HI> most of which were <HI>pilgrims.</HI></P>

This bridge bears vpon its back two rowes of shops, and little houses couered with lead; and least this great weight should make the foundation sink, they built it vpon <HI>piloties,</HI> that is, great trees ramed into the ground, to the number of six thousand in all. In fine, this bridge cost two hundred and fifty thousand crownes. It were a fine sight, to see in a hard frost, the streets of <HI>Ʋenice</HI> all frozen, and people walkeing vp and downe vpon diamant streets, or a crystal pauement. In the meane time its no vnpleasing sight to see the streets full of water, and such stately pallaces on either side, especially the <HI>Canal Grande,</HI> which runns quite through the midle of

<P N="1">1.

<PB N="378" REF="333"/>
I saw the hansomest, the most sightly, the most proper and graue men that ever I saw any where else. They weare alwayes in the towne (I speake of the <HI>noblemen</HI>) a long <HI>black gowne</HI> a <HI>black cap knit,</HI> with an <HI>edgeing of black wooll</HI> about it, like a <HI>fringe</HI>; an ancient and manly weare, which makes them looke like <HI>Senators.</HI> Their <HI>hair</HI> is generaly the best▪ I euersaw any where; these little caps not pres∣ing it downe as our hats do; &amp; <HI>Perywigs</HI> are here forbid. Vnder their long gownes (which fly open before) they haue hansome black sutes of rich stuffs with stockins and garters, and spanith leather shoos neatly made. In a word, I neuer saw so many proper men together, nor so wise, as I saw day∣ly there walking vpon the <HI>Piaz∣za of S. Mark.</HI> I may boldly say, that I saw there fiue hundred gentlemen walking together euery day, euery one of which was able to play the <HI>Embassador</HI> in any <HI>Prin∣ces Court</HI> of <HI>Europe.</HI> But the misery is, that we strangers cannot walk
<PB N="379" REF="333"/>
there with them, and talk with them, but must keep out of their way, and stand a loof off. The reason is this: This <HI>state</HI> (as all <HI>Re∣publicks</HI> are) being hugely gealous of her liberty and preseruation, forbids her <HI>Noble men</HI> and <HI>Sena∣tors</HI> to converse with <HI>Forrain Em∣bassadors,</HI> or any man that either is an actual <HI>seruant</HI> or <HI>follower</HI> of an <HI>Embassador,</HI> or hath any the least <HI>relation</HI> to any <HI>Princes Agent,</HI> with out expresse leaue; and this vp∣on payne of being suspected as a Traitor, and condignly punished. This makes them shy to all strang∣ers, not Knowing what relation they may have to some forain <HI>sta∣tes man</HI> of <HI>Agent.</HI> For the same reason they will not let their wifes visit the wifes of forrain <HI>Embassadors</HI> resideing in <HI>Venice,</HI> for feare of being suspected to commit <HI>treason by pro∣xie.</HI> They haue in the wall of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> in diuers places, certain <HI>wide mouths</HI> of marble stone, ouer which I found written these words: <HI>Denuncie secrete,</HI> Priuate informa∣tions, into which they cast secret∣ly
<PB N="380" REF="334"/>
papers of accusations, by which they accuse secretly any officer, or nobleman, whom they durst not accuse publickly. This maKes men stand hugely vpon their garde, and be wary with whom they con∣uerse, and what they say.</P>

the <HI>Senate</HI> caused the <HI>glasse</HI> to be ta∣ken out, and <HI>Santa Iustinas picture</HI> to be set in place of it. Then we saw a rare <HI>Carpet,</HI> or rather a cu∣rious peece of <HI>stuff</HI> with figures in it, sent to the <HI>Republick</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> by a <HI>King of Persia.</HI> The <HI>habits</HI> of two noble <HI>Chinesi</HI> who were bapti∣zed at <HI>Venice.</HI> The <HI>amour,</HI> of braue <HI>Gatta Mela,</HI> with the <HI>picture</HI> of a <HI>catt</HI> in his <HI>headpeece.</HI> The armour of some of the ancient <HI>Dogès</HI> of <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> who to the number of forty or fifty, went to warre in person, and did such things there, as to make their <HI>very armour</HI> to be ho∣norable. The <HI>habit, buckler,</HI> and <HI>sword</HI> of a <HI>King ef Persia</HI>; the armes are set with rich stones.

Then the <HI>diuels Organs,</HI> or a <HI>trunck</HI> of <HI>leather</HI> with <HI>ten pistol barrels</HI> in it of a foot and a half long, and so disposed in oder like <HI>organ

pipes,</HI> that vpon the opening of the <HI>lock</HI> of this <HI>trunck,</HI> all these barrels being charged with seuer∣all bullets, should let fly at once, and so seattering wide, kill all those that should be in the <HI>roome.</HI> This <HI>trunck</HI> was contriued by a re∣uengefull man, who hauing a minde to be revenged both of his ene∣my, and of his enemyes friends at once, sent him this <HI>trunck</HI> by an vnknowne bearer (as a present from a friend) while he treated his friends at a dinner. The <HI>holes</HI> through the <HI>sides</HI> of it, made by the <HI>bullets,</HI> shew the <HI>diuelish effect</HI> of this <HI>Trunck</HI>; and how well it de∣serues the name of the <HI>Diuels or∣gan.</HI> The <HI>boxe</HI> of <HI>botargos</HI> here is iust such another inuention.

and yet they discharg <HI>thrusts</HI> not to be <HI>parried</HI> by any <HI>fenceing gard.</HI> I saw also here a fine <HI>Taberna∣cle</HI> of <HI>Cristal</HI>: a burneing Lamp found in <HI>Antenors tombe</HI> in <HI>Padua, a burning glasse,</HI> which burneth half a mile off: a rare <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eue</HI> with the <HI>Serpent</HI> and the <HI>Tree,</HI> all cut out of one peece of wood by the rare hand of <HI>Alberto Dureo</HI>: and in fine, the <HI>picture</HI> of <HI>King Iames</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> the onely picture of any forrain Prince that I saw there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Piaz∣za of S. Mark.</NOTE>Hauing thus seen this <HI>Cabinet</HI> of <HI>Mars,</HI> we went out of the <HI>Pallace</HI> into the <HI>Piazza</HI> of <HI>S.

It runns from the <HI>Sea side</HI> vp along the <HI>Pallace</HI> to the <HI>Church of S.

Theodorus</HI>; the other, the <HI>Lyon of S. Mark,</HI> these two <HI>Saints, S. Mark</HI> and <HI>S. Theodore,</HI> being the two <HI>Patrons</HI> of this <HI>City.</HI> These two pillars were erected here by a <HI>Lombard,</HI> who required no other recompence for his paynes, then that it might be lawfull for <HI>dice-players</HI> to play at dice between these two pillars without being punished or molested, nay though they playd false play.

execute malefactors, to shew that they deserue not the <HI>protection</HI> of <HI>those two patrons,</HI> who break the orders of that towne which is vnder their <HI>protection.</HI> Its pitty that the <HI>Lombard</HI> himself was not whiped here at least, for makeing himself the <HI>Protector</HI> of idle <HI>rogues</HI> there, where the <HI>Saints</HI> are <HI>Patrons</HI> of honest∣men.

being sent thither <HI>Legat</HI> by the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Going from hence into the other part of the <HI>Piazza</HI> which stands before the <HI>Church,</HI> I espyed vpon the very out corner of the <HI>wall</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> (as you come out of the <HI>Pallace</HI>) four <HI>Porphiry Statues</HI> of four marchants embrace∣ing one another. Haueing en∣quired what those <HI>Statues</HI> were set for there, I was told by a graue old gentleman of <HI>Venice,</HI> that those, whom these <HI>Statues</HI> represent, were four marchants and strangers, who brought hither most of the <HI>Iewels</HI> mentioned aboue in the <HI>Treasury</HI>; and that afterwards poysoning one another, out of couetousness, left this <HI>State</HI> heire of all. Iust before the <HI>Church</HI> stand three tall <HI>masts of ships</HI> vpon curiously wrought <HI>Piedes∣tals of Brasse,</HI> and each mast bear∣ing, vpon great dayes, a stately <HI>flag</HI> and <HI>streamers.</HI> These three <HI>mast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> signify the three noblest parts of the <HI>Venetians</HI> dominions, to wit the kingdomes of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and of <HI>Candy,</HI> and the State of <HI>Venice.</HI> In this <HI>Piazza</HI> I found alwayes a world

of strangers perpetually walking and talking of bargains and traffick, as <HI>Greeks, Armenians, Albanians, Slauonians, Polonians, Iewes,</HI> and euen <HI>Turks</HI> themselues; all in their seueral habits, but all conspireing in this one thing, <HI>to sell deare</HI>; and <HI>buy cheape.</HI> Here also they haue euery night in sommer, a world of <HI>Montibancks, ciarlatani,</HI> and such stuff, who together with their drudg∣es and remedyes, striue to please the people with their little <HI>come∣dies, puppet playes, songs, musick, storyes,</HI> and such like <HI>buffonnerie.</HI> Its strange to see how they finde dayly either <HI>new fooling,</HI> or <HI>new fooles,</HI> not onely to heare them but euen the throw them money too for such poore contentments. In this <HI>Piazza</HI> also stands the <HI>Cam∣panile,</HI> or <HI>High steeple</HI> of <HI>Ʋenice,</HI> distant some fifty paces from the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>S. Mark.</HI> Its built forty foot squar on all sides, and two hundred and thirty six high. The top of it is couered with <HI>guilt tiles,</HI> which in a sunshine day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The High steeple.</NOTE> appeare gloriously a farre off. The <HI>founda∣tion</HI>
<PB N="405" REF="346"/>
of it is almost as deep vnder∣ground, as the top of it is high aboue ground; a wonder, if you consider rhat it stands in <HI>Venice.</HI> From the top of this <HI>Campanile</HI> we had a perfect view of <HI>Venice</HI> vnder us, and of all its neighboring <HI>Ilands, Forts, Sea,</HI> and <HI>Townes</HI> about it; as also of the outside of <HI>S. Marks Church,</HI> its <HI>Frontispice,</HI> its <HI>Cupolas</HI> and the <HI>four horses</HI> of <HI>brasse guilt</HI> which stand ouer the <HI>Frontispice.</HI> These <HI>horses</HI> came out of the <HI>shop,</HI> not out of the <HI>stable,</HI> of <HI>Lisippus</HI> a famous <HI>statuary</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> and were giuen to <HI>Nero</HI> by <HI>Tiridates King of Armenia.</HI> They were carryed by <HI>Constantin the Great</HI> from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Constantinople</HI>; and from thence they were transported hither. In fine, from the top of this steeple, we saw the compasse of the great <HI>Arsenal</HI> of <HI>Ʋenice,</HI> which looked like a little towne in our sight. Indeed some make it three miles about; but I cannot allow it so much. The sight of this <HI>Magazin of warre</HI> a farre off, made vs hasten downe from the <HI>steeple</HI> to go see it nearer hand.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="406" REF="347"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ar∣senal.</NOTE>9. Takeing therefore a <HI>Gon∣dola,</HI> we went to the <HI>Arsenal,</HI> Where after the ordinary formalityes of leauing our <HI>swords</HI> at the <HI>dore,</HI> and paying the <HI>Porters fees,</HI> we were ad∣mitted, and led through this great <HI>Shop</HI> of <HI>Mars.</HI> Its so well seated neare the <HI>Sea side,</HI> and so well built, that it might serue the <HI>Venetian Se∣nators</HI> for a <HI>Castle</HI> in time of dan∣ger: and in it there is a <HI>Well</HI> of fresh water, not to be poysoned, because of two peéces of <HI>Ʋnicornes horne</HI> set fast in the bottom of it. I confesse, I neuer saw any where such <HI>Oeconomie</HI> as is here obserued. Fifteen hundred men are dayly employed here, and duely payed at the weeks end, according to their seueral employments and works. The expences of these workemen amount to a <HI>thousand Ducats</HI> euery day in the yeare: so that they make accompt that they spend in this <HI>Arsenal</HI> four hundred &amp; thirty thousand crownes a yeare: Enough almost to maintain a pretty army constantly. Euery workeman here hath <HI>wine</HI> twice a day, and that

very good too, but that it is a little mingled with <HI>water.</HI> We were led through all the vast rooms of this <HI>Magazin,</HI> rooms like vast <HI>Churches.</HI> In one of them I saw nothing but great <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ares</HI> for <HI>Gallyes,</HI> seauen men going to one oare. In another, nothing but vast <HI>sternes.</HI> In another, nothing but vast <HI>nayles</HI> for <HI>Gallyes</HI> and <HI>ships.</HI> In another they were making nothing but <HI>Salpeeter</HI> for <HI>gunpowder.</HI> In another they were casting great <HI>Cannons, Morter peéces,</HI> and <HI>Chambers.</HI> In an other they had nothing but a pair of vast <HI>Scales</HI> to weigh <HI>Cannons</HI> with. In another, <HI>Masts</HI> for <HI>Gallyes</HI> and ships of a prodigious greatness and length; and yet of such a rare <HI>timber,</HI> that one filipping vpon one end of them, you heare it easily at the other end, by apply∣ing your care to it. Some of these masts are worth fourscore pounds. In other vast roomes I saw store of <HI>Cannons</HI> of all sizes both for <HI>ships</HI> and <HI>Gallyes:</HI> where also I saw some <HI>Turkish Cannons</HI> with words vpon them in the <HI>Turkish
<PB N="408" REF="348"/>
Language.</HI> There I saw also one Cannon shooting three shotts at once: another fiue: one great <HI>Cannon</HI> found buryed in <HI>Candy</HI>-full of gold <HI>medals</HI>: the great <HI>Cannons</HI> cast here while <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>III.</HI> of <HI>France</HI> dined in this <HI>Arsenal.</HI> They had heretofore a prodigious quan∣tity of <HI>Cannons</HI> here, but now these roomes are much emptyed by reason of this warre with the <HI>Turks.</HI> In other great roomes I saw huge heaps of <HI>Cannon bullets</HI> of all sizes, with some <HI>Ensignes</HI> wonn ouer the <HI>Turks.</HI> Then mounting vp into the <HI>Chambers</HI> aboue, I saw in <HI>two vast roomes,</HI> armes for <HI>fifty Thousand men.</HI> in another, <HI>armes</HI> for <HI>twelue Gallyes</HI>: in another, armes for <HI>Fifty Gallyes.</HI> Here also I saw the <HI>sute of armour</HI> of <HI>Scanderbeg</HI>: that of the <HI>Dogè zani,</HI> the <HI>Lanterne</HI> of <HI>Don Iohn</HI> of <HI>Austrias ship</HI> in the battle of <HI>Lepan∣to</HI>: the <HI>Lanterne</HI> of a <HI>Turkish Galley:</HI> the <HI>armour of Baiamante Theopoli</HI> and his <HI>complices,</HI> with one <HI>arme</HI> onely: some <HI>armes</HI> taken from the <HI>Turks</HI> in the battle of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> other <HI>armes</HI> taken from the <HI>Genuesi</HI>; a great
<PB N="409" REF="348"/>
<HI>Crossebow,</HI> shooting Vast <HI>arrowes</HI> of iron aboue fiue quarters long: an inuention of great vse before <HI>Gunne</HI> were found out. A <HI>cannon bullet</HI> with four long irons, like the tops of halbards, which shut vp close into it when you put it into the <HI>Cannon,</HI> but open againe of them∣selues, as soon as the <HI>bullet</HI> is out of the <HI>Cannons</HI> mouth; and so spread∣ing into four parts, cut all they meet, with strange fury: a dange∣rous inuention in <HI>Sea battles,</HI> to to spoyle <HI>cordage</HI> and <HI>tackling.</HI> Here also they shew vs the discription of the towne and <HI>Fort</HI> of <HI>Clissa,</HI> and how it was taken by the <HI>Venetians</HI> some 20 yeares agoe. Then des∣cending from thence, we went to see the places where they make new <HI>Gallyes,</HI> and mend old ones. There I found a vast <HI>square court</HI> three hundred paces broad in euery square, and full of vast <HI>penthouses</HI> capable of holding in them, <HI>Gallyes</HI> of fifty paces long a peéce. In the midst of this <HI>Court</HI> is a vast square <HI>Pond</HI> of water, let in from the <HI>Sea,</HI> where the new <HI>Gallyes</HI> are
<PB N="410" REF="349"/>
tryed; and the old ones are let into the <HI>Arsenal</HI> to be mended and rigged a new. Here I saw a world of <HI>Gallyes,</HI> and a world of men workeing about them most busily. There were heretofore diuers of these great <HI>Courts</HI> full of <HI>Gallyes,</HI> but now they are much exhaus∣ted; the <HI>Gallyes</HI> being abroad in warre. Hence it is obserued that This <HI>Arsenal,</HI> before these warres, could arme 200 <HI>gallyes,</HI> and two hundred thousand men. Here it was that they made a <HI>Gallye,</HI> and set her out at Sea while <HI>Henry the III</HI> dyued here in the <HI>Arsenal</HI>; which made that <HI>King</HI> say then, that he would giue three of his best townes in <HI>France</HI> (except his <HI>Parla∣ment townes</HI>) for such an <HI>Arsenal.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Arsenals</HI> of <HI>Paris, Genua, Zurick, Naples,</HI> and <HI>Geneua,</HI> seemed to me to be little <HI>gunnsmiths shops</HI> in comparison of this. They were then makeing here two new <HI>Galleasses</HI> (when I was last there) of vast bulk and expences. In fine I saw here the old <HI>Bucentoro</HI>; and presently after the new <HI>Bucentoro.</HI> This last
<PB N="411" REF="349"/>
is the <HI>Gally</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> of the <HI>Dogè,</HI> when he goeth forth vpon the <HI>Ascension day</HI> accompanyed with the <HI>Senate,</HI> to <HI>espouse the Sea,</HI> as they call it here. This is a noble <HI>Gallie</HI> all guilt without, and wainscotted round about the <HI>Deck,</HI> with guilt seats. There runns a partition of wood quite along the <HI>Deck</HI> of the <HI>Gallie,</HI> with <HI>seats</HI> on both sides and with a low <HI>open roof</HI> of wood, to let in <HI>ayre,</HI> and yet keep off the <HI>sun</HI>; and all this is <HI>guilt</HI> and painted, and capable of fiue hun∣dred <HI>Senators,</HI> who in their <HI>scarlat</HI> robes, wait vpon the <HI>Dogè</HI> that day. The <HI>Dogè</HI> fitts in the <HI>Puppe,</HI> in a <HI>Chair of State,</HI> with the <HI>Popes Nuncio</HI> on one hand of him, and the <HI>Patriarch of Venice</HI> on the other, and a place for <HI>musick</HI> behind them. The <HI>slaues</HI> are all vnder <HI>hat∣ches,</HI> and not seen at all: but their <HI>oares,</HI> (twenty on each side) moue all at once like great wings which make the <HI>Bucentoro</HI> moue most maiesticaly. And this is all that I can remember in this <HI>Arsenal,</HI> except the <HI>Cellar</HI> of <HI>Wine,</HI> and the
<PB N="412" REF="350"/>
great roomes, (as I came out) where women onely are employed in mending old <HI>sayles</HI>; and men (a part) in makeing great <HI>cables:</HI> and indeed those wast <HI>Anchors</HI> which lye neare the woodden bridge here at the entrance, stand in need of <HI>cables</HI> of the greatest <HI>size.</HI></P>
<P N="10"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assen∣sa.</NOTE>10. I happened to be at <HI>Ʋenice</HI> thrice, at the great <HI>Sea Triumph,</HI> or feast of the <HI>Ascension,</HI> which was performed thus. About our eight in the morneing, the <HI>Senators</HI> in their scarlat robes, meet at the <HI>Doges Pallace,</HI> and there taking him vp, they walk with him processio∣naly vnto the shoare, wete the <HI>Bu∣centoro</HI> lyes waiting them; the <HI>Popes Nuncio</HI> being vpon his right hand, and the <HI>Patriarch of Venice,</HI> on his left hand. Then ascending into the <HI>Bucentoro,</HI> by a hansome bridge throwne out to the shoare, the <HI>Dogè</HI> takes his place, and the <HI>Sena∣tors</HI> sit round about the <HI>Gallie</HI> as they can, to the number of two, or three hundred. The <HI>Senate</HI> being placed, the <HI>anchor</HI> is weighed, and the <HI>slaues</HI> being warned by the

<HI>Capitains whistle</HI> and the sound of trumpets, begin to strike all at once with their <HI>oares,</HI> and to make the <HI>Bucentoro</HI> march as grauely vpon the water, as if she also went vpon <HI>cioppini.</HI> Thus they steere for two miles vpon the <HI>Laguna,</HI> while the musick plays, and sings <HI>Epithala∣miums</HI> all the way long, and makes <HI>Neptune</HI> iealous to heare <HI>Hymen</HI> called vpon in his dominions.

At last the <HI>Dogè</HI> being arriued at the appointed place, throws a <HI>Ring</HI> into the <HI>Sea,</HI> without any other ceremony, then by saying: <HI>Desponsamus te, Mare; in signum per∣petui dominij: we espouse thee, ò Sea, in testimony of our perpetual dominion ouer thee</HI>: and so returnes to the

This ce∣remony of marrying the <HI>Sea,</HI> as they call it, is ancient, and per∣formed yearly in memory of the grant of <HI>Pope Alexander the III,</HI> who being restored by the <HI>Venetians</HI> vnto his <HI>Seat</HI> againe, granted them power ouer the <HI>Andriatick Sea,</HI> as a <HI>man</HI> hath power ouer his <HI>wife</HI>; and the <HI>Venetians</HI> to keep this possession, make euery yeare this watery <HI>Caualcata.</HI> I confesse, this sight is stately, and a <HI>Poēt</HI> would presently conceiue, that <HI>Neptune</HI> himself were going to be marryed to some <HI>Nereide.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Hauing seen this <HI>Ceremony</HI> in the morneing, we went after dinner to see the <HI>Euening Corso</HI> at <HI>Murano,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Corso at Mura∣no.</NOTE> where we saw those fine <HI>Gondolas</HI> and <HI>Piottas,</HI> which we had

Some∣times meeting too thick in the arches of the woodden bridge here, they crack one an others <HI>Gondalas,</HI> breack one an others oares, ouer∣turne their boatmen, and are stoppt for an houre together without being able to vntangle. <HI>Embassadors</HI> them∣selues of Forrain Princes appeare in <HI>Corso</HI> this euening with all their brauery (fiue or six <HI>Gondolas</HI> all in one liuery) as well as all the gallants and gentry of <HI>Venice,</HI> who appeare here this euening at <HI>Corso.</HI></P>

<P>He that desires to know the hi∣story of <HI>Mantua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its History.</NOTE> let him read <HI>Mario Aquicola.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Mantua</HI> we went to <HI>Mirandola,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirandola</NOTE> being inuited thither by its won∣derfull name. It is a principality farre more ancient then great; and it is so called, from <HI>Three children</HI> borne here of a great <HI>Lady,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Franciscus Pius. Leander Albatus.</NOTE> at one birth. The story as it is pretty, so it is related by good authors, and therefore I will give it you here, in the end of this my <HI>Italian</HI> iourney, as a faire well. And tis this. <HI>Con∣stantius</HI> the Emperor, Sonn of <HI>Con∣stantin the great,</HI> had à daughter called <HI>Euridis</HI>; who beeing growne vp in yeares, fell in loue with <HI>Manfred</HI> a courtier of her Vncle <HI>Constantin,</HI> à hansome well bred
<PB N="444" REF="366"/>
yong gentleman. <HI>Manfred</HI> was both courtier enough, and wise enough, to vnderstand this to be no small honour; and therefore embraced her affection with a cor∣responding flame. In a word, they meet often; talke of it; giue mu¦tual promises; make all the money they can, and iewels, and flye away secretly. They come into <HI>Italy,</HI> land at <HI>Naples,</HI> from thence to <HI>Ra∣uenna</HI>; and at last pitch vpon this country where now <HI>Mirandula</HI> stands. It was then a place ouerspred with thickets and vnderwoods, and fur∣nishing some pasturage for sheep, and cottages for shepheards. Here then they choose to liue priuately and conuerse with none but coun∣try swaines, and shepheards. Blind loue whither doest thou hurrey, <HI>Princesses,</HI> to make them preferre <HI>cottages</HI> before <HI>Courts</HI>? At last with their money they buy land, and <HI>Manfred</HI> grows Soone to that au∣thority among his neighbours, that they choose him for their <HI>Head</HI>; and recurre vnto him, vpon all occa∣sions for his aduise and protection:
<PB N="445" REF="366"/>
In the meane time (haueing so∣lemnly marryed <HI>Euridis</HI> at his arri∣ual in <HI>Italy</HI>) she brings him forth three sonns at once, <HI>Picus, Pius,</HI> and <HI>Papazzo</HI>; and <HI>Manfred</HI> growes farre more considerable dayly in these parts. At last the <HI>Emperor Constantius</HI> comeing into <HI>Italy</HI> vpon his accasions, and being compli∣mented by all the seueral provin∣ces thereof, this Prouince among the rest, chose <HI>Manfred</HI> as their <HI>Em∣bassador</HI> to the sayd <HI>Emperor,</HI> to car∣ry to him the tender of their res∣pects and homage. <HI>Manfred</HI> accep∣ted of the employment, and car∣ryed himself so gallantly in the <HI>Embassy,</HI> that the <HI>Emperor</HI> knighted him, and vpon further tryal of his worth, raysed him to high fa∣uour. <HI>Manfred</HI> seing the realityes of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> thought it now high time to discouer himself vnto him. Whereforecasting himself one day at the <HI>Emperors</HI> feet, and begg∣ing his pardon, he discouered himself vnto him, and told him his whole story, and aduentures.
<PB N="446" REF="367"/>
At fitst the <HI>Emperor</HI> was a little trou∣bled; but findeing such freedome and gallantry in his carriage, ming∣led with such humble ingenuity in the Confession of his fault; he not onely pardoned what was past, but presently sent for <HI>Euridis</HI> and her children to come to him, and liue at court with him. This done he makes <HI>Manfred Count</HI> and <HI>Mar∣quis,</HI> of a great part of these coun∣tryes, and gives him leaue to build <HI>townes</HI> and <HI>Castles</HI> there: and for his <HI>armes</HI> giues him the <HI>black Eagle.</HI> In fine, in memory of the <HI>three children</HI> borne so wonderfully at one birth, he commands that the chief towne thould be called <HI>Miranda.</HI> After the death of <HI>Constantius, Manfred</HI> and his <HI>Lady</HI> returned with great riches vnto their old dwellind place, and there began to build <HI>Miranda,</HI> which in processe of time was called <HI>Mirandola.</HI> This true <HI>story</HI> if it looke like a <HI>Romance,</HI> you must not wonder; seing <HI>Romances</HI> now a dayes, looke like true <HI>stories.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Mirandola</HI> receiues yearly fourscore thousand crownes.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="367"/>The greatest ornament of this country, was that famours <HI>Ioannes Picus Mirandulanus</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io Picus Mirandui¦lanus.</NOTE> whose life <HI>S. Tho∣mas Moore</HI> wrote, and hauing writ∣ten it, liued it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Mirandula</HI> I struck to <HI>Parma,</HI> and so to <HI>Piacenza, Lodi,</HI> and <HI>Marigno,</HI> described all aboue; and at last to <HI>Milan</HI> againe, where I had been before, and where my <HI>giro</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI> ended, as now my <HI>Iourney</HI> and <HI>description</HI> doth. I takeing here a new rise from <HI>Milan,</HI> and crossing through <HI>Swisserland</HI> by the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Como,</HI> and ouer mount <HI>S. Godart,</HI> came to <HI>Basil.</HI> Where embarking vpon the <HI>Rhene,</HI> I saw <HI>Strasbourg, Brisac, Spire, Philipsbourg, Openhem, Coblentz, Hamerstede, Wormes, Franc∣furt, Mayence, Colen, Dusseldorp, Skinksconce, Rais, Wesel, Arnehem</HI> and diuers such fine <HI>Rhenish</HI> townes. Then haueing Viewed <HI>Holand</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> I came at last to <HI>Calais,</HI> and so home to my owne <HI>Deare Country England,</HI> by the way of <HI>Douer.</HI></P>
