<P>These are to advertise thee that these Letters are Prin∣ted without the privitie of those that sent them, but I suppose that they will not take it offencively, that all such as are well-willers to the cause of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> should bee made ac∣quainted with the common occurrences which fall out there, and I suppose they would the rather suffer it, if they knew or were made acquainted with the false Rumors which often passe heere for current, vntill wee heare the contrary by such Letters as these are: I haue not prefixed any long preamble to the ensuing Relation, neither is it stuffed with any superfluous coniectures, but you haue them printed in the same wordes and phrase in which I received them.</P>

<P>MY L. <HI>Chichester</HI> arived here on Thurs∣day last, to my Lord Generals great comfort, and the whole troupes. Barron <HI>Tilley</HI> strengthened with his fresh supplies, which were 5000. foote and 1000. horse, marched towardes the Maine, to hinder Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> and Marquis <HI>Baden,</HI> from meeting with the Duke of <HI>Brunswick.</HI> Now the passage aimed at on both sides was <HI>Ashenburge</HI> a Towne of the Bishop of <HI>Ments</HI> vpon the Maine, where there is a Bridge. The Count <HI>Mansfeilds</HI> Army came about <HI>Darmstat,</HI> one Thursday was sevennight, and there staid the comming of the Mar∣quis which was Sunday: to conclude it was Teusday before they marched from their quarters, in the <HI>Lantgraues</HI> Countrey towards this <HI>Ashenburge,</HI> when beeing by <HI>Dippergen</HI> a small Towne, which ransom∣med it selfe at 15000. <HI>Lor.</HI> advertisement came of the Barron <HI>Tillies</HI> hauing possessed
<PB N="4" REF="5"/><!-- PDF PAGE 91 -->
himselfe of the passage, and that hee mar∣ched directly towards them with a great power, weied to bee (by the coniecture) of the Barron <HI>Anhalts</HI> forces and most of <HI>Gonsales</HI> with him 30000. and the horse ful∣ly armed from top to toe as they say. Our Armie then thought of a faire retrait, and applied to it by the same way they advan∣ced, and lay the same night in Armes: on Wednesday they retreated towards <HI>Openhe∣im</HI> bridg and lodged about <HI>Girah.</HI> On thurs∣day (which was a very great march) they came on this side <HI>Bensheim,</HI> The Enemie all this while following without any thing done, on Fryday morning our two Ar∣mies hauing so disposed of themselues, mar∣ched by severall passages to <HI>Loresh,</HI> least the enemie should cut betweene them and <HI>Mainhem,</HI> but were no sooner risen, but the Enemie appeared, and with a body of Cai∣rassiers, charged the rereward of the Mar∣quis of <HI>Baden,</HI> wher his Lieutenant General Colonell <HI>Golstein</HI> a man much lamented for his courage and vnderstanding was at the first shot slaine. But since that written newes came from the Enemies Leaguer
<PB N="5" REF="5"/><!-- PDF PAGE 91 -->
that hee is liuing shot in the head, but not mortally, and his horse put to the worse, but the presse of the enemy was kept vp by the Rereward of Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> horse, the Regiment of Colo∣nell <HI>Megant,</HI> and were forced to a disor∣derly retreat. Note the enemies foote ne∣uer came vp, which if they had, the whole must needes haue beene engaged. Thus skirmishing continued in the rere somewhat sharpely by fits, till towardes night: the danger on euery side was by the Chiefes vigilance preuented, and the estimate of men slaine on both sides is betweene 3. or 4. hundred, but till a par∣ticular view bee taken of the particular companies by each Captaine, the iust number of those that are wanting can∣not be knowne. In this skirmish his Ma∣iesty shewed himselfe (as before) most forward and valorous to the encourage∣ment of others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Landgraue</HI> of <HI>Darmstart</HI> and his yonger sonne are inuited hither, and lodged with the King at the Citadell, the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> came suddenly and vn∣exspectedly

vpon the <HI>Landgraue</HI> of <HI>Darm∣stat,</HI> so that hee came to meete the King withall speeding demonstrations of af∣fection and much complement, which hee would haue spared if the king had not brought a force with him able to fleece the <HI>Landgraue,</HI> the King notwith∣standing did not trust him; but shewed him an intercepted letter of his, whereat he was silent, and most of the Cattle in his countrey are driuen into the <HI>Pallati∣nate</HI> to make supply of flesh there.</P>
<P>The Arch Duke <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>poldus</HI> at my since his retreat from <HI>Hagenaw</HI> hath bene in a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consumption, what with muting and a great different betweene the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> souldiers, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also by the <HI>Switzers</HI> who are sayde to haue killed a great number of them.</P>

<P>A <HI>Germaine</HI> Prince of the house of the <HI>Rhinegraues,</HI> and a Count of the house of the <HI>Mansfields</HI> were taken, and some o∣thers meaner of Officers, on the Ene∣mies side was a Collonell slaine in com∣pleate armour, by a bullet in his face when hee lifted vp his helmet to take cold aire.

attending the good successe of the trea∣ty. The <HI>Bauarians</HI> forces are in <HI>Darmstrats</HI> countrey in a readinesse to oppose what may be attempted by the duke of <HI>Bruns∣wicke</HI> in his passage vpward: but it is conceited that the endeauours of the Lord Ambassador here, and those at <HI>Brussels</HI> will put a barre betweene them, here is a speech that the <HI>Turke</HI> is pow∣ring downe his forces vpon Christen∣dome, but hauing no ground for it other then a common report, you shall take it accordingly. This day the king sent 2. Gentlemen to <HI>Brussels</HI> as doth also the Marquesse of <HI>Baden,</HI> there to treate for them: my Lord Ambassador sent his Se∣cretary to <HI>Gonsalo Tilly,</HI> and so to <HI>Bruns∣wicke,</HI> who is neere to <HI>Ashenburg.</HI> Most of the Marquesse his forces are put into Garrison at <HI>Hidelberg, Frankendale,</HI> and <HI>Mainheim:</HI> my Lord Ambassador hath re∣ceiued them for 3. weekes into the king our soueraigns pay; he payes so many as makes the number vp, with these my Lord Generall already hath, in that space of three weekes it is thought that they of

<P>The Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> hath taken <HI>Hasteon;</HI> the riuer of <HI>Main,</HI> and made a bridge ouer it, he hath sixe Regiments of foote, and eighty Cornet of horse.</P>

<P>In hast I desire to present my loue, &amp; tell you that Barron <HI>Tilly</HI> and <HI>Gonsalo</HI> are gone with all the forces they can make ouer the <HI>Main</HI> to see if they can finde out the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> who lay intren∣ched at a place called <HI>Hoest</HI> within a Dutch league of <HI>Frankford,</HI> where the Duke lay ready to encounter him, there is great disaduantage in their forces, but we hope that it will bee made vp by the aduantage of the ground, it is apparant by the great preparation of the campe that he hopeth to swallow vp the Duke, but wee hope it shall turne to the aug∣mentation

of the Dukes honor, the duke hath had many skirmishes with them, wherein he hath had the better of them We haue, and you will heare of a lamen∣table defeate of the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> by <HI>Francford</HI> to the losse and scattering of the whole army, but God be thanked it is not true but what is the truth is hard to say, the likeliest is, that in passing the <HI>Main</HI> towards a bridge by <HI>Hoest</HI> below <HI>Franckford, Tilly</HI> who is now sayd to bee 30000. at least, with three supplyes from aboue, from <HI>Bohemia, Bauaria,</HI> and the Bi∣shops, and the Duke had but two small peeces: and the Barron of <HI>Anhoults</HI> occa∣sion hath broke the bridge with thirteen peeces of Canon, where the foote were most passed, and put the horse to swim, and so tooke much of the baggage and some men therewith, but God be praised the body of the Army ioynes this night with the kings, we hope.</P>
