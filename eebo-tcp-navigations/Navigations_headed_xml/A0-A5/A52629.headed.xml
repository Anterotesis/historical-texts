<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>There are many fair Ports and Harbours for Ships, on the East and South sides of what I shall speak, in the Description of the particular Counties.</P>
<P>Concerning the names of severall Nations and Men, they have their severall conceits, it is known by the name <HI>Ireland</HI> to us.</P>
<P>It is an ancient Iland, and not of little esteem, in re∣gard of the greatnesse of it, being accounted the third Iland anciently known in the habitable world, by good Geographers; who say, That of all Ilands, for greatnesse the Indian <HI>Taprobane</HI> is chief; the next after it, is <HI>Bri∣tain;</HI> and in a third degree, another British Iland, cal∣led <HI>Hibernia,</HI> that is, <HI>Ireland;</HI> so that <HI>Ptolomie</HI> called it <HI>Little-Britain:</HI> The situation is under the 10 and 12 Climats, in Longitude extending 4 Degrees from the Meridian of 11 Degrees and half: And the Lati∣tude reacheth 4 Degrees from the paralel of 54, to that of 58 Degrees.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are divided by the name of Wilde-Irish, and the English Irish, living in the English Pale, where the English at their first going over did inclose themselves.</P>
<P>Formerly it was divided into 5 Kingdoms, now Pro∣vinces; namely <HI>Mounster,</HI> lying Southward, <HI>Lemster</HI> Eastward, <HI>Connagh</HI> in the West, <HI>Ulster</HI> in the North, and <HI>Meth</HI> in the midst almost.</P>

<HI>Shannon,</HI> and runneth out narrow at the entrance, but towards the Sea, with a broader promontory im∣braced by the Sea on both sides.</P>
<P>A Countrey mountanous, woody and wild, loftily looking into the Ocean; in which are many fruitfull fields, and pleasant vallyes, beset thick with woods.</P>
<P>A County <HI>Palatine</HI> granted to the Earle of <HI>Des∣mond</HI> by the speciall favour of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; but being often ingratefull in their rebellious treasons, and rebellions lost it.</P>
<P>Towards the Sea there is a territory called <HI>Clan∣morris;</HI> not farre off standeth <HI>Ardart</HI> a See of a poor Bishop called <HI>Ardfert.</HI></P>
<P>Towards the South of this runneth a faire River na∣med <HI>Dingle,</HI> a commondious Port on the other side na∣med <HI>Smirwick-sound,</HI> or St. <HI>Marywick,</HI> where the Spa∣nyards to ayde the rebellious Earle of <HI>Desmond,</HI> 1583. set footing.</P>
<P><HI>Desmond, Desmonia,</HI> in Irish <HI>Deswown;</HI> lyeth large∣ly stretched out towards the South, in which are three high promontories over-topping the Sea, and con∣temning his proud waves, running out into the South∣west, called west-<HI>Mounster.</HI></P>
<P>The first promontory lyeth between <HI>Dingle-bay</HI> and the River <HI>Maire,</HI> and is called <HI>Clan-car,</HI> and hath a Castle built at <HI>Dunkeran</HI> by the Carews of <HI>England,</HI> in it dwelt <HI>Donel mac Carty more,</HI> a L▪ of the Irish bloud.</P>
<P>The second lyeth inclosed within two bayes, <HI>Maire</HI> and <HI>Bantre,</HI> named <HI>Bear</HI>-haven.</P>
<P>This for the most part is a leane, barren, hungry soyle, in which lived <HI>O Swillivant Beare,</HI> and <HI>O Swilli∣vant Bantre,</HI> both of the same stock and high bloud in their Countrey.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>The third called <HI>Eraugh</HI> situate between <HI>Bantre</HI> and <HI>Balatamore</HI> or <HI>Baltamore,</HI> a bay or creeke famous for the multitude of Herrings that are taken there, in this the <HI>O Mahouns</HI> by the gift of the <HI>Carews</HI> have large possessions; the <HI>Calverts</HI> Lord <HI>Baltimort</HI> the South promontory called of the ancients <HI>Notium,</HI> is at this day called <HI>Missen-head,</HI> the <HI>Feildings</HI> are Earls of <HI>Des∣mond</HI> and Vicounts <HI>Callon.</HI></P>

<P>There lyeth towards the South Sea a Port and road anciently of good safegard for Shipps, but by reason of a barre in the mouth of it, it falls dry at the ebb, and is now of little use, it lyeth four leagues westward from the out-point of <HI>Kinsale.</HI></P>
<P>Betweene <HI>Rosse</HI> and <HI>Kinsale</HI> there lyeth a small Iland in the Sea called <HI>Roem,</HI> which may be fayled about, having ten fathome water between that and the mayne▪ three leagues from hence lieth <HI>cape de velho</HI> or <HI>Old-head,</HI> from whence to <HI>England</HI> end is 46 leagues, it is a high point reaching forth into the Sea, from whence about a quarter of a league South-west lieth the mouth of the Haven of <HI>Kinsale:</HI> a very commodious Port, 10, and 15. fathome going in and 4 or 5 to the very towne which lieth up in the mouth of the river <HI>Bany</HI> in a fruit∣full Soyle, furnished with wood, and other commodi∣ties: Lord <HI>Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> is Baron of <HI>Kinsale.</HI></P>
<P>On the other side of <HI>Kinsale</HI> lyeth <HI>Kerry</HI> wherry a

small territory once belonging to the E. of <HI>Desmond:</HI> right before which lyeth the river <HI>Sauranus</HI> or <HI>Severa∣nus</HI> which fetcheth its first originall from the moun∣taine of <HI>Muskerry:</HI> and going along by the head city of the county <HI>Corke</HI> by the Irish <HI>Corcach</HI> honoured with a Bishops See; together with the See of <HI>Clumi</HI> annexed to it.</P>
<P>The river both roundeth and runneth through the middest of the towne not passible, but by bridges lying in length in one broad street having a bridge over it.</P>
<P>It is a towne of great resort and populous▪ but for∣merly subject to the injury of the Rebells; which made them keep a carefull watch against them. That re∣ligious and devout man <HI>Brioc</HI> who flourished among the <HI>Sauls</HI> was borne and bred here.</P>
<P>Below <HI>Corke</HI> the parting of the river maketh a sweet and pleasant Iland over against the chiefe dwelling house of the <HI>Barries,</HI> called <HI>Barry</HI> Court, derived from <HI>Robert de Barry</HI> an Englishman; who behaved himselfe valiantly in the Irish warres, and was the first that man∣ned and brought the Hauke to hand in Ireland: he had the title of Baron <HI>Barry;</HI> but after of Vicount <HI>Beuti∣phant.</HI></P>
<P>The former river empties into the Sea below <HI>Barry</HI> Court neare <HI>Imokelly</HI> a faire possession long since of the Earles of <HI>Desmond;</HI> and containes a safe road in the mouth of it.</P>
<P>As this supplyes the lower part of the country, so <HI>Black-water,</HI> called anciently <HI>Even-more,</HI> the great river moystneth the upper part, upon which dwelleth the Noble familie of <HI>Roeh,</HI> who went out of England, and flourished there and enjoyed the title of Vicount <HI>Fer∣moy:</HI> and were Parliament Barons in <HI>Edward</HI> the 2. time.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6"/><HI>Yoghall</HI> standeth on this rivers mouth, a Major town, nor great, but walled about, builded in length, and di∣vided into two parts, the upper reacheth Norwest, and hath a Church in it, and the lower part Southwest; the commodiousnesse of the Key makes it much frequent∣ed by Merchants.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Waterford</HI> lyeth in the East side of <HI>Ireland,</HI> stretching out it self between the rivers, <HI>Broad∣water</HI> West, and <HI>Shour</HI> East; the Main on the South, and <HI>Tipperary</HI> Norwest; both delightsome, and very profitable.</P>
<P>When <HI>Broadwater</HI> hath out-run the County of <HI>Cork,</HI> behinde it <HI>Lismore</HI> presently sheweth it self, an Episco∣pall See where <HI>Christian</HI> once sate, that was of the same Cloyster with Saint <HI>Bernard,</HI> and Pope <HI>Eugenius;</HI> but now annexed unto <HI>Waterford:</HI> The <HI>Lumly's</HI> are Vicounts of <HI>Waterford.</HI></P>
<P>At the mouth of which river standeth <HI>Aidmore,</HI> a small town, so called because it standeth near the Sea.</P>
<P>Not far from hence standeth <HI>Dungarvan,</HI> having a strong hold of good force: It is a Tide-haven 8 leagues from <HI>Waterford,</HI> full of rocks, and deep within the harbour.</P>
<P>Vicount <HI>Dessee,</HI> together with the Barony of <HI>Dun∣garvan,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth granted to <HI>Iohn Talbut</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> but afterward, seeing it lay con∣veniently to that part of <HI>Mounster</HI> that was to bee brought under, and reduced into order, it was by a Par∣liament annexed to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>On the side of the river <HI>Shour, Waterford</HI> the princi∣pall City of this County maketh a fair shew; the Irish and Britains call it <HI>Porthlargie,</HI> the English <HI>Waterford,</HI> 37 leagues from <HI>Englands</HI> end.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>It was built by certain Pirats of <HI>Norway;</HI> the ayr is grosse and unhealthy, the soil not fertile, the streets pent and narrow; yet by reason of the commodiousnesse of the harbour, which is fair and wide, 10 or 11 fathom deep going in, it is much frequented, and of great re∣sort, driving a quick trade, so that it is esteemed the se∣cond City in the Kingdom, and hath continued alwaies true and loyall to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> ever since <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> wan it first, and hath recei∣ved many favours and priviledges from the Kings of <HI>England</HI> for their good services.</P>
<P>And <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh augmented them much, for their discreet carriage of themselves against the mock-Prince <HI>Perkin Warbeck,</HI> who counterfeited <HI>Richard</HI> the third, under which colour he couzened a great Peer of <HI>Scotland</HI> of his fair daughter.</P>
<P>This County of <HI>Waterford,</HI> together with the City, King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth gave unto <HI>Iohn Talbut</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI></P>
<P>But by reason of wars in <HI>France,</HI> and the civil dissen∣tions between the houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the Kings of <HI>England</HI> were busied, and the Nobles so in∣tangled in those broils, that they could not intend the affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> so that the Irish grew very insolent and powerfull: So that in the 28 year of <HI>H.</HI> 8. though the fault were committed long before his dayes; yet for punishment, by Act of Parliament it was or∣dered, That the heirs of many Noblemen, as the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury, Ormond,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and Ba∣ron <HI>Barkley,</HI> and all the Abbots and Priors (for they were all found liable to this punishment) with the rest, should forfeit all their lands and demeans in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in∣to the Kings hands for such neglect and absence.</P>

<P>The head City is <HI>Limrick,</HI> which <HI>Shanon</HI> by parting begirteth round, the Irish call it <HI>Loumeagh,</HI> and the English <HI>Limrick;</HI> it is a chief Market-town of <HI>Moun∣ster,</HI> and the See of a Bishop, and at this day called two Towns; the upper, wherein stands the Cathedrall Church, and a Castle, and hath two gates, and each of them a stone Bridge with bulwarks, the one leading in∣to the West, the other into the East, unto which the lower Town joyneth, fenced with a wall, and a Castle thereto, and a fore-gate at the entrance into it: Lord <HI>Esmond</HI> is Baron of <HI>Limrick.</HI></P>

<P>The County of <HI>Divelin</HI> or <HI>Dublin,</HI> on the East lyeth broad upon the Sea, on the west bounded with the County of <HI>Kildare,</HI> on the south, on two small territories of <HI>Wicklo</HI> and <HI>Arcklo,</HI> once the habitation of the <HI>O Tools</HI> and <HI>O Birns,</HI> and now termed the <HI>Glimes▪</HI> and norwest limited with the County of <HI>Meth,</HI> and <HI>Nanny</HI> a small River.</P>
<P>It is a very plentifull County both in corne and cattell, abounding also with game for pleasure; their greatest want is fuell, which is a heavie turfe or English sea-coale, but in the south side a barren soile, hils and woods plenty, many hollow valleyes over-run with trees, which they call <HI>Gli∣nus,</HI> among which was the Bishoprick of <HI>Glandelaw,</HI> but now annexed to the Archbishop of <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>All the rest of the County is rich and plentious, the peo∣ple of a stately port and garbe, in gentile neatnesse and car∣riage surpassing all the rest of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and it is divided in∣to five severall Baronies, <HI>Rath-downe, New-castle, Castle∣knoc, Cowloc</HI> and <HI>Balrodry.</HI></P>
<P>This whole County is <HI>Neptunes</HI> neighbor, no part there∣of being twenty miles distant from the Sea.</P>
<P>To the south of <HI>Dublin</HI> Haven standeth <HI>Wicklo,</HI> a narrow Haven, over which bends a rocke immured strongly with fortification in stead of a Castle, whose command none ought to have but English borne: Lord <HI>Maynard</HI> hath the title of Baron.</P>
<P>Then from the top of a hill, <HI>New-castle</HI> looketh into the Sea in the sight of the three shelves, which they call the south, middle, and north grounds, lying in length, yet shall you find betweene them and the shore seven or eight fa∣thome of water.</P>

<P>A little Iland Saint <HI>Bennets,</HI> belonging to the Archbi∣shop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> lyeth in an elbow of land which the River <HI>Bray</HI> maketh.</P>
<P>The creeke or bay is called <HI>Dublin</HI> Haven, which is five leagues from <HI>Wexford,</HI> into which Haven the greatest River of this County powreth it selfe, called <HI>Liffy,</HI> whose origi∣nall being but fifteene miles distance from that place, yet through his many windings and turnings he watereth many countries.</P>
<P>First south, by Saint <HI>Patricks</HI> land, then westward, after north, watering the County of <HI>Kildare▪</HI> at length into the east by <HI>Castle-knoc,</HI> and so by <HI>Kilmainam.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dublin</HI> is seated seven miles from the mouth of <HI>Liffy,</HI> it is the most famous towne of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Irish call it <HI>Bala Cleigh,</HI> that is, the town set upon hurdles, for the first foundation thereof was laid upon hurdles, by reason of the soft unsetled ground, like as <HI>Sivil</HI> in <HI>Spaine</HI> is said to bee built on piles, <HI>Venice</HI> on woolsack, or such like matter of foundation, it is an ancient towne, yet was much rent and defaced in the <HI>Danish</HI> warres; after it became subject to <HI>Edgar,</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> who in his Charter cals it, The most noble City of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Then the <HI>Norwegians</HI> got it in possession, and at last it fell to the English, who defended it against the Irish, and was planted with a Colony of <HI>Bristow</HI> men, on whom King <HI>Henry</HI> the second bestowed this City, and all the liberties and franchises which the men of <HI>Bristow</HI> have; of which City many write in praise and commendation, one thus:</P>
<P>A City, in regard of the people, noble, of the site most

pleasant, by reason of the Sea and River meeting together, rich and plentifull in fish, for traffick famous, for the green plaines delightfull and lovely, beset with woods of mast∣bearing-trees, incompassed about with Parkes of Deere▪ So another:</P>
<P><HI>Develin,</HI> a maritine towne, is the mother City of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> having to it an Haven passing well frequented, for traffick and enter course of Merchants matchable with our <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>There are many Keyes and Wharfs along the River, jet∣ting out to stop the violence of the water.</P>
<P>A very strong wall of rough building stone, reacheth a∣long by the sides of it, which openeth at six gates, from whence there runne forth suburbs of great length.</P>
<P>Towards the east is <HI>Dammes</HI> gate, and neere it the Kings Castle, very strong both by art and nature; and an Armo∣ry or storehouse built by <HI>Henry Lounders</HI> Archb. 1220.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Andrews</HI> Church stands in the east suburbs, not farre from which is Trinity Colledge, which queene <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> honoured with the title and priviledges of an Uni∣versity.</P>
<P>The north gate openeth at the Bridge built by King <HI>John</HI> of Arch-worke, and this uniteth <HI>Oustmans</HI> towne to the City: for here the Easterlings, that came out of <HI>Norway,</HI> placed themselves about 1050.</P>
<P>In the south quarter of the City stand two gates, <HI>Or∣monds,</HI> and <HI>Newgate</HI> the common prison.</P>
<P>These lead into Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> street, being large and long, where there stands a great Abbey of that name founded by <HI>Henry</HI> the second, for the expiation of the murder of <HI>Tho∣mas A Becket,</HI> as some say.</P>
<P>Into the south openeth <HI>Pauls</HI> gate, and Saint <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which maketh a way into Saint <HI>Patricks</HI> suburbs, wherein
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
standeth the Archbishops Palace, called Saint <HI>Sepulchers,</HI> and a stately Church dedicated unto Saint <HI>Patrick,</HI> having an arched roofe of stone, and a tall steeple.</P>
<P>It maintaines a Deane, a Chaunter, a Chauncellor, a Treasurer, two Archdeacons, and 22 Prebendaries; the only light and lampe (as the Parliament of that Kingdome said of it) of all godly and Ecclesiasticall discipline and order in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Cathedrall Church standing in the very heart of the city, called Christ-church; neere the south side of which standeth the towne Hall, built of square stone, and called the Tolestall, where the Sessions of the city are kept.</P>
<P>The chiefe Officer was a Provost, but <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth gave them liberty to choose a Major, and two Bayliefes, after King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, changed the two Bayliefes in∣to two Sheriffes.</P>
<P>No inconvenience save only that the ebbing and flowing of the Sea doth much choake the mouth of <HI>Liffy,</HI> that hin∣der great vessels from going up, and makes them to observe the high water for transporting of goods.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Liffy</HI> dyeth in the Ocean, <HI>Houth</HI> standeth com∣passed in a manner round with the Sea: of which those no∣bles Saint <HI>Lawrence</HI> hold the Barony.</P>
<P>Not farre off is <HI>Malehide</HI> or <HI>Molachid,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Talbots.</HI></P>
<P>More within the countrey is <HI>Fingall,</HI> a little place, but very well husbanded, even the garner and store-house of this Kingdome, so great store of corne it yeeldeth every yeare.</P>

<P>The County of <HI>le Trim,</HI> formerly called <HI>Breany,</HI> which incloseth the county of <HI>Sligo</HI> on the East, and was the pos∣sessions of that ancient Family of the <HI>Rorck,</HI> untill <HI>Brion O Rorck</HI> rebelled in queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> dayes, who was cha∣sed into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and sent thence into <HI>England,</HI> and there hanged, so that his lands fell unto the Crown: the <HI>Sherards</HI> are Barons of <HI>le Trim;</HI> after it was made a county by the Lord Deputy, and called <HI>le Trim</HI> from the chiefe towne.</P>
<P>This county is full of rising hills, and very fat ranke pa∣stures; so that one saith of it (but how true I know not) that it is so full of forrage, that unlesse cattle were kept sometimes from grazing, their fulnesse would endanger them: but so fruitfull and fertile it is, that in a small cir∣cuit of ground, it was able at once to shew one hundred and twenty thousand head of beasts; here is the See of the Bi∣shop of <HI>Achonry,</HI> united to the See of <HI>Elphin.</HI></P>

<P>It is a plain fertile countrey, much abounding with cat∣tle, because tillage is too painfull for the inhabitants.</P>
<P>There are foure Baronies in this county, lying under <HI>Curlew</HI> hils, by the River <HI>Shannon.</HI></P>
<P>1 That of <HI>Boyle,</HI> where <HI>mac Dermot</HI> is chiefe.</P>
<P>2 That of <HI>Balin Tober,</HI> by the River <HI>Suc,</HI> where O <HI>Co∣ner Dun,</HI> is of greatest power, and upon it joyneth <HI>Elphen</HI> the Bishops See.</P>

<HEAD>The second Part treating of the naturall Disposition, Apparell, and Dyet of the <HI>Irish,</HI> and of their severall Rebellions.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Irish for the most part are proud &amp; haugh∣ty, cruell and barbarous, variable and in∣constant in disposition, apt and forward to Tumults, rebellious to Government, false and hollow-hearted, more ready in promise then performance, the meaner lazie, idle, and sluggish especially the wild Irish, and the English Irish much degenerated.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Bernard</HI> in the life of <HI>Malla Ehy</HI> Bishop of <HI>Coner,</HI> who reports that when he undertook his charge there, perceived that he was not come unto men but unto beasts, no where had he until then experience of such, in the most barbarous parts that ever hee came unto: no where had hee found for Manners so froward, for Rites so devillish, for Faith so impious, for Laws so barbarous, for Discipline so stiffe∣necked, &amp; for Life so filthy. Christians they were in name, but Pagans in deed, lawfull Marriages they contracted none, or such as are shamefull even with children of ten yeeres old.</P>
<P>So <HI>Langfrank</HI> complains to a King of Ireland, <HI>Therdel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that the Irishmen forsake and leave their Wives at their
<PB N="26" REF="20"/>
pleasure without any just cause, and marry any others, even such as be neer of kin to themselves, or to the said forsaken wives: and if an other man with like wickednesse hath cast off his wife, her likewise with like rashnesse they joyn with∣all.</P>
<P>With which Rites if this Nation of the Irish had not bin corrupted almost to our days, both the right of lineall suc∣cession among them had been more certain, and as well the Gentry as the vulgar had not embrued themselves so wic∣kedly with the effusion of so much bloud of their own kin∣red about their inheritance and legitimation, nor had they become so infamous in these respects among other for∣reigne Nations.</P>
<P>And further concerning their natures and disposition, you may take the relation from the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> his Let∣ter to Q▪ <HI>Elisabet</HI> gathered by his experience.</P>
<P>The people in generall have able bodies by nature, and have gotten by custome ready use of armes, and by their late successe, boldnesse to fight with your Majestis forces.</P>
<P>In their pride they value no man but themselves, in their affections, they love nothing but idlenesse and licentious∣nes, in their Rebellion, they have no other end but to shake off the yoke of obedience, to root out all remembrance of the English Nation in that Kingdome. This is the generall quarrell of the Irish, and they who doe not professe it, are either so few, or so false, that there is no account to be made of them.</P>
<P>The Irish Nobility and Lords of Countries do not only in their hearts affect this quarrell, and are divided from us in Religion, but have an especiall grudge against the Eng∣lish Government, because it limiteth and tyeth them, who have and still would be supream Lords, if not Tyrants. The Towns being inhabited by men of the same Religion and
<PB N="27" REF="20"/>
birth with the rest, are so carried away with the love of gaine, and for that cause supply the Rebels with what they want: therefore they must be strictly looked unto.</P>
<P>The Laws of the Irish was that of fish and birds, the great devoure the lesse, the strong the weak, having but one Free-holder in a County, and he Lord both of estate and lives of the rest.</P>
<P>For their succession to inheritances, it was by the law or custome called <HI>Tanistry,</HI> mentioned by that excellent Hi∣storian Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh:</HI> which is this, that a man is pre∣ferred to a boy: the Uncle before the Nephew, and com∣monly the most active, not the next heire is chosen, to hin∣der the inroad and oppression of the next adjoyning Lord, between whom there was alwayes contention, which did so wast and consume them, or else being idle, the Land would not have sustained them.</P>
<P>Concerning the apparell of the Irish it is after a slovenly manner, and the very English, there are much infected with this nasty filthinesse, especially lowzie beds, and foule lin∣nen, except where the chiefe English live, as in Dublin, Wa∣teford, and Kinsale, which in some measure retaine the English neatnesse; but for the meere wilde Irish it may be said of them as of the Germans, that they wander slovenly and naked, and lodge in the same room with their cattle.</P>
<P>Among them the better sort used to weare close bree∣ches and stockings of the same, of red or some light co∣lour, so straight that the unseemly parts of the body were exposed unto view.</P>
<P>They used likewise a loose Coat and a three covered Mantle of coarse cloth, with a cap of Thrums.</P>
<P>Their linnen is coarse and slovenly, they seldome cast off a shirt untill it be rotten, and are coloured with Saffron to avoid Lice which are incident to those people, and they are
<PB N="28" REF="21"/>
very nimble in taking Lice in a Sunny day, or a green bank.</P>
<P>But in the more Northern parts before the strict civili∣zing of them in King <HI>James</HI> his time, both men and women went naked in the very Winter, having only their secret parts covered with a rag and a loose Mantle cast over them.</P>
<P>Thus naked they walke with their sword tyed unto them with a wyth instead of a belt.</P>
<P>And at night men and women lye in a Ring together, round about the fire, in the middle of the roome with their feet towards it, folding their head and upper parts in their woollen Mantle first steeped in water to keep them warm, for they say, woollen wetted, and warmed by the heat of their bodies, doth preserve heat.</P>
<P>The Church Discipline hath beene formerly and now is after the same manner with that in England, by Arch∣bishops, whereof there are foure, Bishops 29, many more formerly.</P>
<P>It has beene anciently a great Nursery of Religion and Pietie: even from (if not before) Saint <HI>Patricks</HI> time, and Saint <HI>Bridget</HI> his Disciple, who did advance Religion and Piety much in that Kingdome, as also in sundry other pla∣ces of Christendome.</P>
<P>The Bishops were formerly consecrated by the Arch∣bishop of Canterbury, untill the yeere 1142: at what time Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> the fourth, sent Cardinall <HI>Paperio,</HI> who to∣gether with <HI>Christian</HI> Bishop of Lismore, Legat of all Ire∣land, held a Councell at Mell, and with the consent of the Bishops, Abbots, Kings, and Dukes of Ireland, established foure Archbishops, <HI>videlicet</HI> Armagh, Dublin, Cassile, and Toam. But the estate of the Clergy has been very meane there, so that by reason of devouring impropriations in the whole County of Connought. The Incumbents stipend is not above forty shillings, and at some places but fifteene
<PB N="29" REF="21"/>
shillings <HI>per annum,</HI> that the people must needs be better fed then taught.</P>
<P>Their allowance being answerable to the Irish Bishops in former time, who had but three milch Kine allowed them, and when one was dry, the Parish did change her for another.</P>
<P>Which makes the Gospell to languish where it finds so poore entertainment; that the Messengers thereof through▪ want and necessity should live so mean and contemptibly: and it gives great advantage to the Priests and Jesuits both to abound and seduces who have mayntenance from else∣where.</P>

<HEAD>The right and title of the English Crown to Ireland was by Conquest, by Surrender, and Submission.</HEAD>
<P>THe Danes first invaded it with forreigne forces, then the Norwegians got possession of it; but they were rooted out by the policie of that King of Meth, who had a beautifull Virgin to his daughter, with whom <HI>Turgesius</HI> was much inflamed, requiring her to satisfie his lust, to whose will the poore Prince could not assent, yet durst not deny. So that he told him he had at home a Bevy of faire Ladies▪ out of which hee should choose for his pleasure. <HI>Turgesius</HI> hearing that, wished these Damsels <HI>Cupids</HI> wings for their more speedy arrivall.</P>
<P>But the other attired certaine young men of courage in womens apparell, and had them conducted into the Kings Chamber, from whence all his attendance were comman∣ded, but when hee expected more kinde embraces, hee was suddenly slaine in the place; so the Norwegians were de∣stroyed, and the Irish enjoyed their estate untill the yeere 1172.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="22"/>When <HI>Dermet Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Morck</HI> King of Lemster, having for∣ced the wife of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rice O Rork</HI> King of Meth (a light wo∣man, and with consent) by whose husband the other was pursued so eagerly with the revenging sword; that hee was driven to quite his Kingdome of Lemster, and fly to Eng∣land for succour to <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, who very willingly entertained this occasion; who had long sought occasion of getting Ireland.</P>
<P>Yet not willing to entertain it at the first in person (being not a matter of that consequence for himself to undertake)</P>
<P>He gave Dermot licence to draw-what power of Vo∣luntiers he could into that action.</P>
<P>Who applyed himself to Wales, where he found a va∣liant Gentleman of Norman Race, one <HI>Robert Fitz Stephen,</HI> who willingly undertook the service with some Voluntiers whose happy and good successe, caused <HI>Richard</HI> Earle of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> called <HI>Strong-bow,</HI> being the principall man in∣vited by <HI>Dermot,</HI> and that with the promise of his daugh∣ter and Kingdome in marriage, the Earle himselfe with two hundred men at arms, and a thousand other Souldiers who arrived in the Bay of Waterford 1171, and presently mar∣ched towards the town of Waterford and took it by force the next day, to the exceeding terrour of that Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Dermot</HI> then accomplishes the match, giving the Earle his daughter <HI>Eva;</HI> with which Ring of Mariage he affian∣ced that Island unto this Kingdome: for hee went on with such resolutions, that hee in little space subdued much of Ireland.</P>
<P>Which news being carried unto <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, hee made hast over thither, that hee might have the glory of the Conquest, and seemed to be displeased with the Earle for his forwardnesse, and his rigorous using of that people, recalling all from thence, under pain of confiscation of
<PB N="31" REF="22"/>
their goods in England; but the King seemed somewhat ap∣peased before his going over, which was 1172, at which time landing at Waterford, hee imprisoned <HI>Robert Fitz Ste∣phen,</HI> as having gone over without his leave, but not long after released him, but took Weiford and other Territo∣ries from him.</P>
<P>Thus did hee receive the homage of divers Irish petty Kings, willing to obtain them by gentle means.</P>
<P>And keeping his Christmasse there in great state, and set∣ling the Government of the Church, hee is unexpectedly called into England, leaving <HI>Hugh Lacy</HI> at Dublin.</P>
<P>Who in ensuing time rebelled, and were brought under by King <HI>John,</HI> who was the first that planted English Laws and Officers in Ireland, and both annexed that Kingdome and fastned Wales to the Crown of England: and was the first who enlarged the Royall style with Lord of Ireland.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1339, there was a generall warre betweene the English and Irish, wherein many of the Irish perished, after which time matters were quiet untill the eighteenth yeere of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, being 1400.</P>
<P>Who went over then with a great Army, but having ac∣cepted of the Rebels submission he returned into England: during whose time and till the civill warres in England all matters were setled and composed without any charge or assistance out of this Kingdome.</P>
<P>But in the time of the wars between York and Lancaster, wherein many Noble Families were quite extinguished in England, many English came out of Ireland either to take part of possession of some inheritances, which fell unto them by the death of their friends.</P>
<P>So they have but small regard of what they leave behind in Ireland. The meere Irish rushed on the forsaken lands, so that growing rich and proud they began to kick against au∣thority;
<PB N="32" REF="23"/>
willing to cast off the English yoke, and the Eng∣lish Pale had its limits sometime more and sometimes lesse, according as they were able to mayntaine.</P>
<P>But when those civill discords were blown over, and all things became calme by the good successe of <HI>Henry</HI> the Se∣venth, and leasure afforded to look towards Ireland, which then harboured a Rebell against him, one <HI>Perkin Warbeck</HI> who connterfeited himself <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, but was sup∣pressed by the sending over of 1000 men.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth sent over 500 souldiers to sup∣presse the <HI>Geraldines</HI> of English Race.</P>
<P>Afterward, all peaceable, untill Queene <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, when they saw themselves out of hope to plant Popish Superstition in any of her Dominions.</P>
<P>Then Religion (never untill that age) became the cloake for Rebellion, and the Roman Locusts, the incendiaries of Christendome, to mayntaine the Popes usurped authority, breathed every where fire and sword, and worse against her sacred person and Dominions. And taking advantage of the blinde zeale of the ignorant Irish unto Popery: working on their variable condition. Boulstering up their hopes and hearts with that old saying,
<Q><L>He that will <HI>England</HI> win, must at <HI>Ireland</HI> first begin.</L></Q>
By which means they raised two dangerous Rebellions in that Country.</P>
<P>By the Earle of <HI>Desmond</HI> one 1578, the other of <HI>Tyrone,</HI> about 1590, plotting and intending, although it brake not out till afterward.</P>
<P>This <HI>Gerald</HI> Earle of <HI>Desmond</HI> of English Race, whose Progenitours had done good service against the Irish, and borderers of Wales, in the behalfe of the English King, had
<PB N="33" REF="23"/>
the Earldome of Kildare given them, and Earles of <HI>Des∣mond,</HI> by <HI>Edward</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's days, one of them being Lord Deputy, and questioned for his ill government, on which occasion <HI>Thomas Fitz Gerald</HI> his sonne took armes, but was soon suppressed himselfe, and five of his Uncles being ta∣ken and executed.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Mary</HI> restored the Family to honour and estate.</P>
<P>But after <HI>Gerald</HI> Earle of <HI>Desmond,</HI> 1578, rebelled a∣gainst Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> unto whose aide came certaine bands of <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> sent by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the twelfth, and <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> who landed at <HI>Swir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic,</HI> and built a Fort called <HI>Del ore,</HI> wherein they were be∣sieged by <HI>Arthur Grey</HI> Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> soone taken and put to the sword: And the Earle of <HI>Desmond</HI> flying in∣to the Woods, being betrayed by his own followers, and his head cut off. So this fire soon vanished into smoake, and the Earldome by Parliament annexed to the Crowne, and made a County: with Sheriffs appointed yeerly to be cho∣sen by the Lord Deputy.</P>
<P>Upon the Attainder of this Earle and his Confederates, much land fell unto the Crown, <HI>viz.</HI> 574628 acres English mesure, wherof great part was restored to the offenders, the rest divided into Signories, was granted by Letters Patents unto certaine Knights and Esquires English, who were cal∣led Undertakers.</P>
<P>In <HI>Kerry</HI> and <HI>Desmond,</HI> by Patent to Knights 30560 A∣cres with yeerly rents 524 pounds, six shillings and eight peace sterling.</P>
<P>In <HI>Limrick</HI> by Patent to Knights and Esquites, and to their heirs were granted 96165 Acres, with rents nine hun∣dred thirty three pounds, foure shillings half peny sterling.</P>
<P>In <HI>Corke,</HI> by Patent to Knights and Esquires, and to their

<P>In <HI>Waterford</HI> and <HI>Tipperary</HI> 22910 Acres, with Rents three hundred and three pounds, three pence sterling.</P>
<P>But these Undertakers having got so large a proportion of Lands, and so little care to plant them with English Co∣lonies; and build and fortifie them with Castles as by Pa∣tent they were tied, but for private ends without any regard to the publick good or her Majesties bounty sold them ei∣ther to Papists or to Irish ill affected unto the English, which was a great prejudice to the State of that Kingdom, and the seeds of the ensuing Rebellion raised by <HI>Tyrone.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Concerning which I will briefly shew unto the Reader such collections as I have gathered from divers Authors.</HEAD>
<P>COncerning the name and title of <HI>O Neale;</HI> it is in so much esteeme, that even those honourable titles of Earles, Marquesses, Dukes and Princes are despised in re∣gard of that: and in such reverent regard among the Irish, that it is thought hee deserves the greatest curse in the world to fall upon him that shall dare to lay violent hands upon him: nor have any loyall subjects a more dreadfull awe to violate the person of their sacred Prince, then these people have to touch their great <HI>O Neale.</HI></P>
<P>So that two thousand pound being offered by Proclama∣tion to any that should betray him in his vast Campe, pre∣vailed nothing at all, although hee were proclaymed Trai∣tour, and held guilty of that crime by Act of Parliament to take that name upon him.</P>
<P>Neere <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llogh Oge,</HI> there was a stone Chaire placed in the open field, wherein he sate down that was created; then
<PB N="35" REF="24"/>
we whose office it was, took an old shooe and cast it over his head, proclayming him <HI>O Neale.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Henry O Neale</HI> and <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re</HI> matching into the Family of the Earles of <HI>Kildare,</HI> by this their good fortune grew so insolent and proud, that by their cruell tyranny they grew intolerable.</P>
<P><HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Batto,</HI> because lame, succeeded his father in the dig∣nity of <HI>O Neale,</HI> and cursed his posterity if any of them should learne English, sow corne, or build houses to enter∣tain the English.</P>
<P>This mans greatnesse grew in suspition with <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, having been a party in the former Rebellion of the Earle of <HI>Kildare:</HI> which hee perceiving went into <HI>England,</HI> renounced the title of <HI>O Neale,</HI> and surrendred his Lands unto the King.</P>
<P>Which not long after was regranted unto him by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to hold in fee, together with the title of the Earl of <HI>Tyrone</HI> to him, and to <HI>Matthew</HI> his reputed sonne, and to the heires of their bodies lawfully begotten.</P>
<P>At which time also <HI>Matthew</HI> was created Baron of <HI>Dun∣gannon:</HI> This <HI>Matthew</HI> till hee was fifteene yeeres of age, was reputed the sonne of a blacksmith of <HI>Dundalke,</HI> whose Wife <HI>Con</HI> had formerly kept; and she at her death gave him unto the said <HI>Con,</HI> as being his sonne which hee did accept, and appointed him to be Lord of <HI>Dungannon,</HI> but hee was murthered in his fathers life time by <HI>Shant,</HI> that is, <HI>John O Neale</HI> the lawfull heire of <HI>Con,</HI> but <HI>Matthew</HI> the base sonne left <HI>Brian</HI> who was murthered by <HI>O Donell</HI> at the instance of <HI>Shan.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Hugh</HI> and <HI>Cormack▪</HI> who by the means and help of the English were preserved, yet both proved Rebels, <HI>Shan</HI> being barbarous and bloudy, did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave and rage in a cruell manner over the Lords and people of <HI>Vlster.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="25"/>Began to dispute that his father had no power to surren∣der to <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, being but a termer: that <HI>Matthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was base borne, that himselfe was <HI>O Neale,</HI> and had Sovereigne power and authority over the Lords of <HI>Vlster.</HI></P>
<P>Who taking armes overthrew <HI>O Really,</HI> and took <HI>Callogh O Donnell,</HI> Lord of <HI>Tir Conell,</HI> cast him and his children into prison, took his wife from him, and bore himselfe as abso∣lute King of <HI>Vlster.</HI></P>
<P>But hee was soone quelled by the forces of the Earle of <HI>Sussex,</HI> the then Lord Deputy: and by perswasion of the Earle of <HI>Kildare,</HI> went into <HI>England,</HI> and made great sub∣mission to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and promising allegiance, was received courteously.</P>
<P>And so returning conformed himselfe awhile in civill manner, and did some good service against the <HI>Scots,</HI> killed their Leader, and drove them out of <HI>Vlster;</HI> howbeit hee suddenly fell to his old byas, and played the Tyrant over the Lords of <HI>Vlster;</HI> who craved aid of the Lord Deputy to suppresse him; but he grew the more outragious, and with fire and sword drave <HI>Mac Guir,</HI> Lord of <HI>Fermanagh,</HI> out of his Country: set fire on the Metropolitan Church of <HI>Ar∣magh,</HI> and laid siege to <HI>Dundalke,</HI> but had the repulse by the Garrison and assistance of the Major.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Henry Sidney</HI> Lord Deputy, taking the field with some forces: sent <HI>Edw. Raldalph</HI> a brave Souldier to the North side of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where at <HI>Derry</HI> at <HI>Coghfoyle</HI> in a pitchfield (though hee lost his life) yet gave the rebell such an overthrow, that he was never able to appeare any more abroad; so that hee was minded to have submitted with a halter about his neck to the Deputy, but by the perswa∣sion of his Secretary hee tried, the friendship of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who received him kindly, but not long after slue him.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="25"/>So that presently after <HI>Shan</HI> by a Parliament at <HI>Dublin,</HI> was attainted of high Treason; and all that hee had fell to the Queen. Then <HI>Turlogh, Linnogh,</HI> took the title off <HI>O Neal,</HI> for feare of the children of <HI>Shan,</HI> and <HI>Matthew</HI> the bastard, but being aged was quiet, and lived peaceably.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Hugh</HI> son of the base son <HI>Matthew</HI> lived somtime in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but much in the Court of <HI>England,</HI> commonly cal∣led Baron of <HI>Dungannon,</HI> who had served with a troop of horse under the Queen against the Lord of <HI>Desmond,</HI> and behaved himselfe so valiantly, that hee had given him a yeerly pension off a hundred marks.</P>
<P>He was a man of mean stature, but of a strange body, able to endure labours, watching, hunger and cold, being indu∣strious and active, valiant, affable, and apt to manage great affaires, and of a hgh dissembling, subtile, and profound wit.</P>
<P>He put up a Petition to the Parliament in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that he might enjoy the inheritance of his Grandfather <HI>Con,</HI> and his father, granted to be Earles of <HI>Tirone,</HI> which by the help of Sir <HI>John Perrot,</HI> Lord Deputy, was procured of the Queen.</P>
<P>And so hee handled the matter (as well knowing the hu∣mour of the Court of <HI>England</HI>) that through the Queenes mediation he got <HI>Turlogh, Linnogh,</HI> to surrender his govern∣ment upon some conditions.</P>
<P>After whose death he usurped the title of <HI>O Neale,</HI> which was capitall, yet coloured it over with a pretence, that it was only to hinder others.</P>
<P>In the yeer 1588, when that great Armado of <HI>Spaine</HI> was scattered by the <HI>English,</HI> and many of the ships cast away on the <HI>Irish</HI> coast: it is thought that this <HI>Hugh</HI> lodging and en∣tertaining many of them, was by them seduced and per∣swaded to Rebellion.</P>
<P>And going into <HI>England,</HI> he was there detained prisoner,
<PB N="38" REF="26"/>
for that he came without the licence of the Lord Deputie, Sir <HI>William Fitz Williams:</HI> but on submission, and certaine Articles proposed to him by the Lords, and he willingly accepting promising to confirme them before the Lord De∣puty in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>In the yeere 1590, it hapned that <HI>Con</HI> the sonne of <HI>Shan O Neale,</HI> accused <HI>Hugh</HI> of treasonable practices before the Lords in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>All which <HI>Hugh</HI> vehemently denied; but after getting his accuser in his power, he hanged him.</P>
<P>In <HI>August,</HI> the same yeere <HI>Hugh</HI> Earle of <HI>Tyrone,</HI> (for so hereafter we must call him, did promise under his hand be∣fore the Lord Deputy: and counsell of <HI>Ireland</HI> to performe those Articles agreed upon in <HI>England,</HI> but used many ex∣cuses to put off the execution of them.</P>
<P>And about this time <HI>Hugh Ror Mac Mahone</HI> was put to death by the Lord Deputy <HI>Williams</HI> very unjustly (as some say) to the great scandall of the Lord Deputy; and it cau∣sed great complaints and out-cryes among the <HI>Irish,</HI> who presently preferred their grievances against that Deputy▪ and he driven to answer them.</P>
<P>And upon this fact the government of the <HI>English</HI> in the North became odious, and they did strive what they could to shake it oft, by expelling the Sheriffs from among them, fearing the like usage as <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c Mahone.</HI> And 1593, <HI>Mao Guir</HI> chiefe of <HI>Fermanagh</HI> stood upon his guard, accusing the De∣puty of injustice in the businesse off <HI>Mahone,</HI> and set upon Captain <HI>Willis,</HI> and drove him and his guard being Sheriffe into a Church, and would have put them all to the sword, had not <HI>Tyrone,</HI> interceded for them.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Deputy got into his hands <HI>Eniskillen Mac Guirs</HI> castle, and proclaimed him a Traytor▪ and like∣wise gave out some hard speeches concerning <HI>Tyrone,</HI> which
<PB N="39" REF="26"/>
did much exasperate him, and caused him to combine with the Lords of the North, to defend their Honours, Laws, and Liberties: and used two notable plots to assist him to∣wards this Rebellion.</P>
<P>1 To make his men skilfull, hee profered to serve the Queen with 500 men of his own.</P>
<P>And for that end procured expert Captains to exercise them; and so often changing these his men, got most of his followers to be able Souldiers.</P>
<P>Secondly, hee pretended to build a faire house at <HI>Dun∣gannon,</HI> and so got much lead to make Battlements, which after he cast into bullets.</P>
<P>In the meane time Sir <HI>Henry Bagnal</HI> Marshall of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whose Sister <HI>Tyrone</HI> had married, did preferre many Arti∣cles against him, unto which hee answered so cunningly, saying, that the Marshall did it out of spleen of purpose to detain his sisters portion, and seemingly quitted himselfe; but afterward he grew jealous of his owne safety.</P>
<P>At this time <HI>Gauranus</HI> a Priest whom the Pope had made Primate of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> seduced certaine Irish Lords, among which <HI>Mac Guir</HI> was chief, and was overthrowne by Sir <HI>Richard Bingham,</HI> and the Priest slaine: in which service <HI>Ty∣rone</HI> was against <HI>Mac Guir</HI> with the Queens forces▪ but se∣cretly prepared for his Rebellion.</P>
<P>Then the sonnes of <HI>Shan O Neale,</HI> were prisoners in <HI>Du∣blin</HI> Castle, which had they been kept, had been a bridle in <HI>Tyrones</HI> mouth; but by connivance of Sir <HI>William Fitz Wil∣liams</HI> the Deputy, were suffered to escape, and so <HI>Tyrone</HI> got them into his custody, nor would he release them although thereunto required.</P>
<P>But covering his Rebellion, with feeming feares of his conceived enemies, made daily complaints of the Mar∣shals envy; and what wrong he had done him.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1594, the Rebellion burst out; Sir <HI>William
<PB N="40" REF="27"/>
Russel</HI> came in the place of <HI>Fitz Williams,</HI> at which time <HI>Vl∣ster</HI> men openly distressed her Majesties forces; and <HI>Tyrone</HI> was supposed to countenance them.</P>
<P>Yet he appeared in person at <HI>Dublin,</HI> before the new Lord Deputy, desiring her Majesties favour, out of which hee had falne, rather by the calumny of them, then any cause of his own.</P>
<P>But the Marshall charged him with great matters, ready to prove them; so that the Deputy thought fit to stay him, but the Councell of <HI>Ireland</HI> were of the contrary opinion, so he was let goe, but the Queene was much displeased for it, and sharply reproved the Deputy, but he laid the fault on the Councell of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>And presently tooke the field with his Army to relieve <HI>Eniskillen</HI> in <HI>Ferminaght,</HI> and in the Winter following, there was little done because there was some Treaties of peace, but the Rebels grew so peremptory in their demands, that it was not liked by the Lords in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore sent over two thousand old souldiers that had served in <HI>Britany,</HI> and a thousand more taken up in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> which news <HI>Tyrone</HI> hearing, and that the Castle of <HI>Balishannan,</HI> and <HI>Relike,</HI> were to be planted with English Ga∣risons. Drew his forces together, and tooke the Fort of <HI>Blackwater,</HI> razed it: and broke down the bridge there, and now the Northerne Rebels appeare, but <HI>Tyrone</HI> shewed a seeming desire of pardon.</P>
<P>This Lord Deputy fearing this storme might fall upon him, desired the Counsel of <HI>England</HI> to send him an assistant of some experienced Souldiers; which hee meant should be under his command; but the Lords mistaking his mean∣ing, sent over Sir <HI>John Norris,</HI> a great Commander and well experienced, that would scarce give way to any; who was styled Lord Generall, and to command in chief, in the ab∣sence of the Lord Deputy.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="27"/>But the emulation that grew between these two hinde∣red the businesse; yet both of them went into the field, with the Army towards <HI>Armagh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tyrone</HI> makes suit again by Letters for pardon, but being intercepted, came not unto the Deputies hands, untill hee had proclaymed him Traytor.</P>
<P>But upon <HI>Tyrones</HI> instance, Commissioners were appoin∣ted by the Queen to treat with the Rebels.</P>
<P>At which time <HI>Tyrone</HI> complained of the Marshall of ma∣ny injuries.</P>
<P>And his demands were, that hee might have his Wives portion of the Marshall, and the free exercise of his Reli∣gion, and many other.</P>
<P>But when Articles were propounded on the Queenes part, they set so light of them, and made such scorne, that the Conference brake off: though the Queen for sparing of bloud, had resolved to give them any reasonable Condi∣tions.</P>
<P>This parley ended, the Lord Deputy, and the Lord Ge∣nerall comming to <HI>Armagh,</HI> did so much terrifie the Rebels that <HI>Tyrone</HI> left the Fort of <HI>Blackwater,</HI> burnt the Town of <HI>Dungannon,</HI> and pull'd down his house there, and betooke himselfe to the Woods.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> the third, <HI>Hugh</HI> Earle of <HI>Tyrone, Hugh O Donel; Brian O Rourk, Hugh Mack Guir, Brian Mac Mahone,</HI> Sir <HI>Arthur O Neale, Cormac Mach Baron Tyrones</HI> brother, <HI>Con O Neale Tyrones</HI> base sonne, <HI>Henry Oge O Neale, Turlogh Mac Henry O Neale, Brian Art Mac Bryan,</HI> and one <HI>Francis Mountford</HI> were (though absent) indicted, and condemned of high Treason.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Lemster</HI> Rebels being revolted grew strong, and forraged even to the gates of <HI>Dublin,</HI> to the County of <HI>Wexford.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="28"/>This Winter passed without any matter of moment, be∣cause indeed, Generall <HI>Norris</HI> not yet acquainted with <HI>Ty∣rones</HI> subtilties, seemed to harken to peace, thereby to re∣clayme him by faire means.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1596, the Queen granted another Commis∣sion for the Treaty of Peace, and offered very largely, and at <HI>Dundalke Tyrone</HI> upon his knees made an humble submis∣sion to the Queen before these Commissioners, and made many requests, promising reformation, and many circum∣stances and Ceremonies then passed. But these inconve∣niences followed, these delayes being no better then delu∣sions, that the <HI>Vlster</HI> Rebels had rest this Summer, and <HI>O Neale</HI> in the midst of this Negotiation, required aid from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Bingham</HI> a valiant wise man, on some com∣plaint of the <HI>Irish,</HI> was sent for over into <HI>England,</HI> and Sir <HI>Coniers Clifford</HI> sent in his place: but afterwards Sir <HI>Richard</HI> was againe employed in great command in that service.</P>
<P>Again, an other Treaty of Peace with <HI>Tyrone,</HI> who layd the cause of his disloyalty, on the wrongs that were offe∣red him; and so with many dissembling words, oaths, and protestations, making answer to some questions concerning <HI>Spaine,</HI> he departed.</P>
<P>This Lord Deputy being recalled into <HI>England,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Bourgh</HI> or <HI>Borough</HI> was sent over in his place, with ab∣solute authority: so that Sir <HI>John Norris</HI> was much disheart∣ned thereby: and was thought of purpose for that end sent over by the Earle of <HI>Essex,</HI> whom Generall <HI>Norris</HI> had di∣pleased by undertaking an action with lesse force then the said Earle required.</P>
<P>At this Dep▪ arriving Generall <HI>Norris</HI> was commanded to his charge, which was Lord President of <HI>Munster,</HI> and not to stirre thence without leave, which thing did present∣ly
<PB N="43" REF="28"/>
break his heart, so that he died there in the armes of his brother Sir <HI>Thomas Norris.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Tyrone</HI> submitted or sweld as he saw occasion.</P>
<P>So that the Lord Deputy perceiving it presently, made his way towards <HI>Tyrone,</HI> thinking it best to strike at the head; who encountred the <HI>Irish</HI> in a narrow path, and made them give way: hee tooke the Fort at <HI>Blackwater,</HI> and left Souldiers in it, which being not long, after assailed by the Rebels, was againe relieved by the Lord Deputy, who im∣mediatly fell sick, as hee was passing to <HI>Tyrones</HI> house at <HI>Dungannon;</HI> and not long after departed this world, to the great joy of the Rebels, who found his severity disadvan∣tagious to them.</P>
<P>Then Sir <HI>Thomas Norris,</HI> Lord President of <HI>Munster,</HI> under the great Seale of <HI>England,</HI> was made Lord Justice of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who repaired to Dublin; but being very ill through the great grief he conceived for the losse of his brother in a moneths space, he made suit to be released.</P>
<P>So that <HI>Adam Loftus</HI> Lord Chancelour, the Lord Arch∣bishop of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Robert Gardiner</HI> chiefe Justice of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> by Patent from <HI>England,</HI> were made Lord Justices for the Civill Government.</P>
<P>And the Earle of <HI>Ormond,</HI> was made Lord Lievtenant and chief Generall of all Martiall affaires.</P>
<P><HI>Tyrone</HI> again sues for pardon, and proffers submission, saying, that it was offered injuries that compelled him thus to revolt: So there was another meeting appointed at <HI>Dundalke Decemb.</HI> 22. where on his knees hee shewed great sorrow; and made humble submission, desiring a cessation from Armes eight weeks, now this submission being sent into <HI>England,</HI> the Lord Lievtenant received authority from the Queen to make a finall conclusion; so that another mee∣ting was appointed, <HI>March</HI> 15 at <HI>Dundalke;</HI> where many ar∣ticles
<PB N="44" REF="29"/>
were propounded to the Rebels, which they slightly regarded; but for better deliberation, <HI>Tyrone</HI> desired the tenth of <HI>April,</HI> for another meeting.</P>
<P>But <HI>Tyrone</HI> with pretences did frustrate all these parleys, and though hee had his generall pardon granted, yet conti∣nued he in his disloyall courses; so that on the former In∣dictment 1595, he is after out-lawed in 1600.</P>
<P>But he being prepared and his men expert, by trayning and often skirmishing, whereas at the first two or three of them were employed in the discharge of a Musket, hee left off to dissemble and submitted no more, but gives incou∣ragement, and that with good successe unto his Confede∣rates.</P>
<P>First, he sends ayde to the <HI>Lemster</HI> Rebels to annoy the English, and assaulted the Fort of <HI>Blackwater;</HI> as being a hinderance in his passing too and fro.</P>
<P>But Captaine <HI>Williams</HI> valiantly defended it with great losse to <HI>Tyrone,</HI> who went and lay further off, but this Cap∣taine and his Company continued their defence bravely untill <HI>August,</HI> though much pinched with want of victuals: when Sir <HI>Henry Bagnal</HI> Marshall of <HI>Ireland</HI> with foot and horse of the English endeavoured to relieve it, and passing along the narrow passages through the thicke Woods be∣yond <HI>Armagh.</HI></P>
<P>Where the Rebell with all his force assayled him, and bearing a deadly hatred and malice against the Marshall, against whom he bent his whole strength, and commanded his Souldiers so to doe, that he had the fortune to kill him; yet like a valiant Gentleman he sold his life at a deare rate, to many of the Rebels. But his fall caused our mens hearts to fayle; whereupon the Rebell had the greatest advantage against the English: the like never hapning againe, called The Defeat at <HI>Blackwater.</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="29"/>
wherein we lost thirteen valiant Captains, and fifteen hun∣dred old Souldiers: whereupon likewise the surrender of the Fort ensued.</P>
<P>It was thought this misfortune to happen from an over∣sight of the Marshall, who made the Van of the army too suddenly to retreat; and too sudden faces about, puts feare in the Reare; and makes them suppose it may be a running away.</P>
<P>For as Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> in his fifth book &amp; first part of the History of the World, that as well in the Wars of these la∣ter ages as in former times it hath been found ever extreame dangerous to make a Retreat in the head of an enemies army: as he renders the reason, but I cannot digresse any further.</P>
<P>This overthrow much increased the insolencie of the Re∣bels, the Rebells having gotten courage and armes thereby, and <HI>Tyrone</HI> termed the Deliverer of his Countrey, and the authour of their liberty.</P>
<P>All <HI>Vlster</HI> in Rebellion, <HI>Connagh</HI> revolted, and the Rebels in <HI>Lemster</HI> a continuall terrour and vexation to the English.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Tyrone</HI> sent forces into <HI>Munster,</HI> where after the departure of Sir <HI>John Norris,</HI> most of the County revolted, and now brake out like Lightning, making havock, and de∣stroying in a barbarous manner. And for the better counte∣nancing of the matter, a new pretended Earle of <HI>Desmond</HI> is set up, on condition to be Vassall to <HI>O Neale.</HI></P>
<P>At this time a supply came out of <HI>England,</HI> of a thousand and fifty old Souldiers from out the Low Countreys, and nine hundred and fifty joyned to them of new, raised in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> sent under the command of Sir <HI>Samuel Bagnal</HI> Colonel, and nine other Captains to strengthen the Queenes forces i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Lemster,</HI> and a hundred under Colonel <HI>Bagnals</HI> command.</P>
<P>In the midst of these broyls, the impudent Rebell is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="46" REF="30"/>
ashamed to intreat for pardon, and sue for peace.</P>
<P>Although, as appeared in his Letters sent to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> he magnified his victories, and vowed perseverance: but his conditions were insolent and so not regarded.</P>
<P>And now the wound is growne so great, and the case so desperate that it admits of no cure, but by the hand of a va∣liant expert souldier.</P>
<P>And none found like <HI>Robert</HI> Earle of <HI>Essex,</HI> whom favour with the Queen, and fortune of warre had made popular.</P>
<P>And his own active inclination, and the policie of his powerfull enemies in Court, wrought it for his underta∣king; and by his absence they plotted his ensuing over∣throw.</P>
<P>But before his going two Regiments of old Souldiers out of the Low Countries were sent into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and dispersed at his comming through the whole army, for the exercise of the rest.</P>

<P>Concerning which in <HI>April,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> sent intel∣ligence into <HI>England</HI> by a Letter.</P>
<P>And in a second Letter of the resolutions of <HI>Tyrone;</HI> first, that he intended to hearten his Confederates, and then to make head in <HI>Vlster</HI> with his own forces, and <HI>O Donnel</HI> in <HI>Con∣nagh,</HI> that the Rebels had taken oath at a publick Crosse to be constant, and none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought pardon but in such insolent manner, that it was rather a contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="36"/>That the very subjects grew cold in the service, that al∣though on private revenge they could appeare with an 100. Horse, and 300▪ Foot, yet now pleaded their inability to ayd the Queen with sixe of each; the Earle gathered some Eng∣lish forces together, and against his owne advice in <HI>England,</HI> and the Q. command (deceived by some false counsell) hee set not on the head, but on a few weake Rebels in <HI>Munster,</HI> a matter of no consequence, being beaten as they were.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 15. the Lord Lievtenant received Letters from a Captain out of the North of <HI>Vlster,</HI> that <HI>Tyrone</HI> had received Amunition out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> but no treasure (as was reported) that he did sollicite the Redshanks into his pay, and had pro∣vision of armes, and other assistance daily from the Scots.</P>
<P>And also advised the Earle of their strength, and of their intention to protract the warre, and weary the English; in prevention whereof he wished his Lordship to procure foure thousand Redshanks which in their Boats might break in up∣on <HI>Tyrone,</HI> which thing the Lord <HI>Bourgh</HI> had formerly under∣taken to procure, but was prevented by death.</P>
<P><HI>Iu.</HI> 25. the Lord Lievtenant wrote unto the Queen of the state and condition of the Rebels, shewing the cause of their rebellion, with the meanes to reduce and keepe them in sub∣jection, and that as well by Sea as Land provision must bee made to reduce them: and afterward gives such direction to her Majestie, as was followed in the ensuing warre, though himselfe had not the good hap to put it in practice.</P>
<P>And in the conclusion bewayles his owne misfortune, that his enemies (whom he names) had gotten so neere her Ma∣jesties elbow.</P>
<P>In the end of <HI>July</HI> his Lordship brought backe his forces into <HI>Lemster,</HI> himselfe going to <HI>Dublin,</HI> having done little, but admitted some few to protection, which afterward re∣volted againe.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="36"/>In his absence 600. souldiers which were left in the <HI>Glinne</HI> had been beaten by the Irish, for which his Lordship used great severity in punishing of them, putting to death the tenth common souldier, calling the Captaines to a Court Marshall, caused an Irish Lievtenant to be shot for parlying with the Rebels.</P>
<P>By this time the Qu. advertised his Lordship of his errour in not setting on the chiefe Rebell <HI>Tyrone,</HI> but he excused him∣selfe, and layd the fault on the Counsell of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that his intention now was that way beat, but yet that first hee must suppresse some neere <HI>Dublin:</HI> which being done, he took a view of his Army, and found it so much impaired, that hee sent to <HI>England</HI> for supply of 1000. new men to inable him presently to undertake the <HI>Vlster</HI> journey. And now resolved to march Northwest, he willed Sir <HI>Conyers Clifford</HI> Governour of <HI>Connagh,</HI> to compell <HI>Tyrone</HI> to give resistance at <HI>Belike,</HI> while himselfe set on him on the other side.</P>
<P>So that Sir <HI>Con. Clifford</HI> with one Troop of horse, and 1400. foot came to the Curlew Mountaines, where he left his car∣riages under the guard of his Horse, untill he had tryed the passage forward,</P>
<P>Who was presently assaulted by the Rebels, taking the advantage of the woods, boggs, and a stony Causey, and al∣though the English stoutly received the charge, yet they be∣ing weary with a long march, and their powder fayling them which they had about them, they began to faint &amp; so to flye; so that many were slain in the place, and many hurt, besides two worthy Commanders, Sir <HI>Con. Clifford, Alexand. Rat∣cliffe,</HI> killed: And had not Sir <HI>John Jepson</HI> valliantly succou∣red them with his Horse, most of the rest had perished: this happened by a great oversight (as was thought.)</P>
<P>By this time the 1000. men out of <HI>England</HI> were arrived in <HI>Ireland,</HI> yet his Lordship wrote over that he could doe little
<PB N="58" REF="37"/>
this yeere, but only goe to the borders of <HI>Vlster,</HI> whether going in September, <HI>Tyrone</HI> shewed himselfe two dayes to∣gether on severall hills some distance off, whence hee sent to desire a parley with his Lordship.</P>
<P>Who rejected that offer, &amp; also sent him word, that on the morrow he should find him armed in the head of his Army.</P>
<P>The next day after a light skirmish, one of <HI>Tyrones</HI> horsmen cryed that <HI>Tyrone</HI> would not fight, but would speake with the Lord Lievtenant apart from the Army unarmed.</P>
<P>The next day also he was told, that <HI>Tyrone</HI> desired the Qu. mercy, and would faine speake with his Lordship at the foard <HI>Balla. El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch,</HI> neere the chiefe towne of the County of <HI>Louth.</HI></P>
<P>Where they two only met, and <HI>Tyrone</HI> saluted his Lord∣ship very courtly, many speeches passing betweene them.</P>
<P>Whether (as being left not farre off) his Lordship cal∣led sixe or seven of his chiefe Commanders, and <HI>Tyrone</HI> as many of his friends: and there was a Conference about a Treaty of peace, and a truce made from sixe weekes to sixe weekes, untill May, with proviso that on 14. dayes warning given on either side, it should be lawfull to resume armes againe.</P>
<P>Now, the Queen having received his Lordships Letters what he had done, which was nothing with such an Army in so long space.</P>
<P>She wrote him a tart Letter, much blaming his proceed∣ings, and questioning his discretion.</P>
<P>Which did so gaule and wring his Lordship, that pre∣sently he left <HI>Adam Loftus,</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Carew</HI> Treasurer of the wars to governe <HI>Ireland,</HI> so went into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And unexpected presented himselfe before the Qu. in her
<PB N="59" REF="37"/>
privy Chamber, but had not that welcome that hee expe∣cted, and after a few words was commanded to his Cham∣ber, and afterwards to the Lord Keepers house in the nature of a Prisoner.</P>
<P>And now a list of the Commanders, and whole Army is taken and set downe both horse and foot, how disposed of throughout the whole Kingdome, and were 14422. Foote 1231. horse.</P>
<P>The truce continuing the helme was easily held by those hands in which it was put, but <HI>Dec. 6. Tyrone</HI> began to pra∣ctize acts of hostilitie upon that he had given (as hee said) 14. dayes warning, and because the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> was im∣prisoned in <HI>England,</HI> on whom he did relye for safety, and would not now trust the Counsell of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that had so often deceived him before, this intelligence posted into <HI>England,</HI> that the Rebels were ready to assaile the <HI>Pale.</HI></P>
<P>And a false rumour raysed by <HI>Essex</HI> enemies, that <HI>Eng∣land</HI> would suddenly be in a combustion, which was no lit∣tle prejudice to the said Earle.</P>
<P>The Queen hearing this and more, that the Rebels daily increased, and the English Irish discontented that the go∣vernment was wholly out of their hands, by sending Eng∣lish Deputies over.</P>
<P>That <HI>Tyrone</HI> grew proud, bearing trust on the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> who had sent him somewhat, but promised more; and the Pope not wanting in his fatherly cate towards him, sent him a crowne of Phenix feathers, in imitation no doubt of <HI>Vrban</HI> the third, who sent King <HI>John</HI> Lord of <HI>Ire∣land</HI> a crowne of Peacocks feathers.</P>
<P>Upon this Sir <HI>Charles Blunt,</HI> Lord <HI>Montjoy,</HI> is thought fit to be sent, and was thought on by the Qu. before <HI>Essex</HI> came over, who was forward to take the charge upon him, and so turned the Queenes intentions▪</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="38"/>This Lord was a tall comely man, wise, valiant, and lear∣ned, close in his counsels, resolute in his determinations.</P>
<P>His courses were much contrary to other Deputies, and so effected what they could not doe.</P>
<P>1. He led our men warily on any service, not willing to dis-hearten our men, or incourage the enemie; and himselfe ever at hand, either to hearten or helpe, hee ventured his own person often, although it be a great question in Mili∣tary discipline, whether it be wisedome or no.</P>
<P>2. His planting of Garrison in the Rebels countreys compassing <HI>Tyrone</HI> on every side, so that they could not ea∣sily assist on the other.</P>
<P>Other Deputies made two or three journeys in the yeare, and that with the whole Army; which was discovered by the Rebels, that they fled into the woods and bogges, nor could the Army abide the field long for want of victuals, being so many at one place; where as the Lord <HI>Montjoy</HI> planting good Garrisons in many places, taking the field with 1000▪ foot, and 200. horse onely, was able openly to affront <HI>Tyrone,</HI> seeing he was compelled to leave many of his forces behind to guard his Countrey from those Gar∣risons, which else would have forraged his Countrey.</P>
<P>Thus he did not only in Summer as others had done, but in Winter also, himselfe being five or sixe dayes in a weeke, on horse-backe, which course did so vexe the Rebels, who were driven to lye in the woods without shelter for them∣selves or cowes, which allowing them not milk, they wan∣ted present provision, nor could they save their corne for the future.</P>
<P>4. Againe, he had a speciall care to cut the passages open and plaine, that our forces might the more secure meet to∣gether.</P>
<P>5. Further, he was not easie to grant Pardons and Pro∣tections,
<PB N="61" REF="38"/>
but to such who had drawne blood on their fel∣lowes, and so lost the hope of reconciliation to the Rebels, and forbad all parlyes with them.</P>
<P>But as the Rebels were many at the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> com∣ming, so now much more increased. In the County of <HI>Du∣blin</HI> increased one hundred.</P>
<P>And in many other Countreys, besides five Castles late∣ly taken by the Irish.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Lemster</HI> increased 1280. Rebels. In the Province of <HI>Connagh</HI> increased 300. Rebels, besides the doubt of <HI>Tibot ne Longe.</HI></P>
<P>Who had one hundred Irish men in the Queenes pay.</P>
<P>So that now the Enemie strongest, the English weakest, and many other disasters made the businesse very difficult.</P>
<P>In this case the Lord <HI>Montjoy</HI> undertooke the businesse about <HI>Ian.</HI> 1599.</P>
<P>A little before whose comming <HI>Tyrone</HI> marcheth out of the North in a vaunting manner unto <HI>Munster,</HI> to incou∣rage and countenance the Rebels, but under a religious pretence to visite a peece of the Crosse at a Monastery in <HI>Tipperary</HI> County, and so accompanied with the <HI>Lemster</HI> re∣bels went on his devotion.</P>
<P>Now the army of English reduced to 12000. foot, &amp; 1200. horse, for whose payment order is given to the Treasurer and Chamberlaine of the Exchequer of <HI>England,</HI> to pay the Treasurer of the Warres of <HI>Ireland,</HI> after the rate of the former establishment, and other extraordinaries.</P>
<P>So there was signed an establishment by the Queene, <HI>Ian.</HI> 1. 1599. for the pay of Commanders, and Souldiers.</P>
<P>And the Lord Deputy hasting away for <HI>Ireland, Ian.</HI> 10. 1599. in his way wrote backe to master Secretary, that he might have more Forces in regard the Rebels were so strong.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="39"/>A second establishment signed by the Lords, 11. <HI>Feb.</HI> 1599. wherein every Officers and Souldiers pay, and other charges, the whole yearely charge 14055 pounds, 4 shillings 8 pence, farre short of that allowance which the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> had.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 26. the Lord Deputy landed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> when Sir <HI>George Carew</HI> was made Lord President of <HI>Munster, Ty∣rone</HI> did not expect such a sudden arrivall, so that hee was still in West <HI>Munster,</HI> where he might be surprised as the Earle of <HI>Ormond</HI> thought, if things hapned well.</P>
<P>And that he could not thence escape without engaging himselfe, if the passages were watched.</P>
<P>So that daily newes came that <HI>Tyrone</HI> now, or never was to be ruinated: and how many Lords and others of the Irish which were for the Queene had layed waite for him, and would stop his passage back, but all this vanished into Irish ostentation of service, which seldome use to take effect, and many times are not truly intended as this businesse did shew.</P>
<P>And that his Lordship should not expect any helpe from divers of the Nobilitie, and Gentry of the <HI>Pale,</HI> they pre∣ferred a Petition to him, that they were not able by reason of the spoyles the souldiers had made upon them, but a meere excuse (as <HI>Essex</HI> shewed before.)</P>
<P>Then his Lordship wrote to Secretary <HI>Cecill,</HI> to excuse himselfe, for not reducing the 14000 which hee found in the Army unto 12000, and the cause thereof as he had done before.</P>
<P>And upon that receives an answer from the Queen, that she doth accept of his reasons for the present, but would have him effect it by degrees.</P>
<P>And not to entertain many Irish Commanders, who are of small fidelity, and being employed to use them far from
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>
their own countrey, and useth some other advertisements; and so concludeth.</P>
<P>And now for all the great hopes <HI>Tyrone</HI> escaped into the North, passing over the Enny in great hast, and marcheth 27 miles in one day: more then he had gone in five before, so that he could not be over-taken.</P>
<P>And at his being there, he sent out a Mandate, by which hee summoned the Subjects of <HI>Munster</HI> to appeare before him in this forme.</P>
<P><HI>O Neal</HI> commendeth himself unto you <HI>Moris Fitz Thomas, O Neal</HI> requesteth you in Gods name, to take part with him, and fight for your conscience, and right, and in so doing <HI>O Neale,</HI> will spend his life to see you righted in all your af∣faires, and will help you, And if you come not to <HI>O Neale</HI> between this and 12 of the clocke tomorrow, and take his part, <HI>O Neale</HI> is not beholding to you, and will doe to the uttermost of his power to overthrow you, if you come not to him by Saturday noon at the furthest from <HI>Knoc Dumain,</HI> in <HI>Calrye</HI> the fourth of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1599.</P>
<P><HI>O Neale</HI> requesteth you to come and speak with him, and doth give you his word, that you shall receive no harme, neither in comming or going from him, whether you be friend or not, and bring with you to <HI>O Neale Gerald Fitz Gerald;</HI> subscribed <HI>O Neale.</HI></P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 7, the Lord Deputy had intelligence, that <HI>Ty∣rone</HI> was come to his house at <HI>Dungannon,</HI> and that the Earle of <HI>Clanrichard</HI> had sworn, that when his sonne came out off England, in <HI>May,</HI> he would enter into action (for so they call Rebellion: and that the Plantation at <HI>Logh foyle,</HI> was endeavoured to be hindered by the Rebell.</P>
<P>The 20 of <HI>March,</HI> the Secretary informed his Lordship of the relaxation of the Earle of <HI>Essex;</HI> who sued earnest∣ly

in his behalfe to the Secretary, even so far as to make his excuse for the matter in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord Deputy makes a List of his army, about the beginning of the yeare 1600, and casts up the allowances.</P>
<P>Generall Officers for the army as in the former establish∣ment.</P>
<P>Collonels 12 apiece <HI>per diem,</HI> 10 s.</P>
<P>Twenty six troops of horse, in some more, in some lesse at severall rates of pay in number, 1200.</P>
<P>In <HI>Loghfoyle</HI> Garrison 4000 foot.</P>
<P>In <HI>Carickfergus</HI> Garrison, 700 foot.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Connagh,</HI> 1400 foot.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Munster,</HI> 2950 foot.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Lemster,</HI> 4500 foot.</P>
<P>Totall of Foot, 1400.</P>
<P>Likewise a List which the Deputy drew out of the Companies formerly mentioned; which lay in <HI>Lemster, Newry,</HI> and <HI>Carbugford,</HI> for to prosecute <HI>Tyrone</HI> in his Coun∣try, horse 325, foot 3200.</P>
<P>Out of these taken to guard places and passages while the Army did return, foot 810, horse 20.</P>
<P>Besides deduct the six dead pays allowed to each Com∣pany of foot, which is 288, and foure out of fifty horse, which is 26, and other deductions of sicke and unsufficient men for service.</P>
<P>There remayns for his army in field, 2102 foot, horse 279 which is but a small handfull for so great a service.</P>
<P>Divers others there were which had pay; as his Lord∣ships chief Chaplain five l. a week, and ten other Preachers at forty shillings a week, his Doctor of Physick five pound a week.</P>
<P>In <HI>Aprill</HI> it was consulted about entertayning of 2000 <HI>Scots,</HI> and that each man should have a Cow for a moneths pay or six pence, <HI>per diem.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="41"/>Which businesse was to be furthered by the Queens A∣gent in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but it came to nothing being disliked in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Deputy resolved to pursue the Rebels in many places at once, both by the North Garrisons, and the rest of the Army.</P>
<P><HI>Aprill</HI> the third, the Lord Deputy sent Master Secre∣tary notice of the falsheartednesse of those that seemed most sure, and that the Irish Commanders were dangerous to keep, yet knew not how to remove them without certain losse of them.</P>
<P>And how he intended to send a thousand old Souldiers out of <HI>Dublin,</HI> to <HI>Loghfoyle,</HI> and others to lye in Garrison at <HI>Balishannan,</HI> both places of great consequence, and proved very advantageous to the English afterwards.</P>
<P>And informed likewise that <HI>Tyrone</HI> by his so suddain and hasty flight out of <HI>Munster,</HI> had much disheartned many of his Confederates, so that daily the heads of some Rebels or others were brought unto the Deputy.</P>
<P>And the Rebels of Lemster made suit to be received to mercy: only the Towns where the Rebels had to do were very insolent.</P>
<P>And <HI>Tyrone,</HI> by the arrivall of two ships, (wherein were many Priests) did incourage his friends. Lastly, the Deputy complained to the Secretary, that all places were bestowed in <HI>England,</HI> so that he could gratifie no deserving man.</P>
<P>Further hee sent word that hee doubted of the Earle of <HI>Ormonds</HI> constancy to the Queenes cause: and shewed his reasonsa name greatly followed in that Countrey.</P>
<P>In that Province of <HI>Munster,</HI> the Rebels were very strong, by reason <HI>Tyrone</HI> had been there, and by the aide of <HI>Mac Carty</HI> more.</P>
<P>There hapned an ill chance about the time that Sir <HI>George
<PB N="66" REF="42"/>
Carew</HI> went to his charge of <HI>Munster,</HI> whereof he was Pre∣sident.</P>
<P>Who comming to <HI>Kilkenney</HI> in his way from <HI>Dublin,</HI> with the Earle of <HI>Thomond</HI> in his company, and a hundred horse to attend him; where the Earle of <HI>Ormond,</HI> told them that he was to parley with some Rebels of those parts, whereof <HI>Ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c Rory</HI> was chiefe, and requested them to accom∣pany him.</P>
<P>To which they consented and rode eight miles to the place of meeting, with some twenty horse of the Earle of <HI>Ormonds,</HI> and a few followers refusing the guard of the Lord Presidents 100 horse, and the Earl of <HI>Ormond,</HI> left his two hundred foot two miles short, and with his other com∣pany met with <HI>Owny,</HI> who came out of the Woods, leaving five hundred men well appointed not farre off; came up to him with some pikes, but after an houre spent, and nothing agreed on, the Lord President wisht the Earle of <HI>Ormond</HI> to returne, but he said hee would first speak with the Jesuit <HI>Archer;</HI> and did much revile him, calling him Traytor.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Rebels foot had incompassed, the Earle and his company, and presently tooke the Earle of <HI>Ormond</HI> prisoner; and <HI>Mac Rory</HI> laid hands on the Lord Pre∣sident: but the Earle of <HI>Thomound</HI> rushed on him with his horse, and they both hardly escaped, the Earle of <HI>Thom.</HI> be∣ing hurt in the thigh.</P>
<P>The Countesse of <HI>Ormond</HI> having one only daughter, was much perplexed and distressed, but the Lord Deputy sent her a Guard for her House.</P>
<P>There were severall conceits upon his surprisall, some supposing it was not against his owne will, but howsoever the Lord Deputy thought it a matter of no great conse∣quence.</P>
<P>The Fort of <HI>Phillipstown</HI> in <HI>Ophaly</HI> was to be victualled,
<PB N="67" REF="42"/>
and the Rebels gave cut that they would hinder it.</P>
<P>And through the emulation of a great Commander that had another preferred before him, and strengthened by the Court faction in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It might have miscarried, for the said Commander chose out some weake companies for this service to be led by the other; but the Deputy being advertised thereof, profered them to him that had made the choise of them, but hee re∣fused to goe with them.</P>
<P>And Sir <HI>Oliver Lambert</HI> with 14 companyes did with much valour and courage effect the businesse, though strongly opposed.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the fifth, the Lord Deputy makes toward <HI>Tyrone</HI> in the North: who had intelligence that he was lodged in the strong Fortresse of <HI>Coughlurkin</HI> where the Rebels had for∣tified three miles in length. His Lordship drew towards <HI>Armagh</HI> with 1500 hundred foot and two hundred horse, and sent Captain <HI>Edward Blany</HI> with five hundred foot, and fifty horse to make good the passage through the <HI>Moyry</HI> for the Earle of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and Sir <HI>Oliver Lambert,</HI> who were to come that way to the Army: and comming to the <HI>Faghard,</HI> not far from <HI>Dundalke,</HI> whether hee went to the Earle, and told him of the convoy, assuring him that the Lord Deputy would meet him by two of the clocke in the afternoon; hereupon the Earle having with him besides the conuoy, two foot companyes, and fifty horse of Gentle∣men Volunteers: and so marched backe to the dangerous passage of the <HI>Moyry;</HI> where the Rebels taking advantage of the Woods and Bogs, assailed our men, lying lurking on both sides, our men being to passe over a Ford.</P>
<P>But by this time the Lord Deputy himselfe was come neere the place, who sent two Regiments, who beat backe the Rebels; who left a few to skirmish with those two Re∣giments,
<PB N="68" REF="43"/>
and the rest fell back into the Wood, and issued out upon the Reare, brought up by the Earle of <HI>Southamp∣ton,</HI> with great fury both with horse and foot: But Sir <HI>Henry Foliot</HI> made very good stand, and Sir <HI>Oliver Lambert</HI> taking his colours in his own hand, with some thirty of the Earle of <HI>Southamptons</HI> best men, hastened towards the assaylants to second the Earle, who behaved himselfe with great cou∣rage, and made the Rebels give ground.</P>
<P><HI>Tyrone</HI> was seene not farre off with great forces, yet fell not on, so that they marched to the Camp: little hurt be∣ing done to the English, but much to the Rebels.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 26, the Deputy had Letters from the Lords in <HI>England,</HI> and it was only to answer the demands of some Irish Lords upon submission.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the 19, the Lord Deputy sent to Master Secretary how that certain aide was come from <HI>Spaine</HI> to the Rebels; and makes a request for a fleet to lie on the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and some small Barks to hinder the <HI>Scots</HI> from relieving the Irish, Now Sir <HI>Samuel Bagnal</HI> drew out of the <HI>Newry</HI> into <HI>Monaghan,</HI> where he took some booty, and slue six Com∣manders, and many of the Rebels men with little damage to himselfe.</P>
<P>Many Rebels of <HI>Lemster</HI> now seek for mercy, but are not admitted, except some service done for the Queene against their companions.</P>
<P>Two chiefe Rebels offer to submit, but neither could be received without the others head.</P>
<P>His Lordship now out of <HI>England</HI> required to doe some thing against the <HI>Lemster</HI> rebels; in his way thither, tooke two hundred Cowes, seven hundred Garrais, and five hun∣dred sheep, burning and wasting the corne all the way, as he went to a most dangerous passage, where Sir <HI>Oliver Lam∣bert</HI> was appointed to meet him, both being constrained to
<PB N="69" REF="43"/>
fight all the way with the rebels untill they met, having done much harme unto the rebels.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the seventeenth, they both marched towards a For∣tresse, where the Rebels had stored much provision of all sorts, at whose entry there was a Foard compassed with Bogs, over which our horses passed quietly: but his Lord∣ding in the head of the foot was assayled with fury.</P>
<P>The Traitour <HI>Terrill</HI> having appointed a hundred shot to ply the Deputies person, and given them marks to know him.</P>
<P>But the English defeated and slue 35 rebels, among which was <HI>Owmy Mac Rory,</HI> a vile rebell, who before had taken the Earle of <HI>Ormond</HI> prisoner, a bloudy bold young man; by whose death that party never was able to appear in field.</P>
<P>And now the Captaine, and by their example the soul∣diers cut down the corn with their swords, that the rebels were driven to want for the future.</P>
<P>His Lordship returned one day with the foot alone, and sent about the Horse, and yet the rebels which lay there about durst not fight with him.</P>
<P>Eight heads of chief rebels were brought unto his Lord∣ship that night, and one arch-rebell alive, who was present∣ly hanged.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Oliver Lambert</HI> foraging abroad, tooke a thousand Cowes, five hundred Garrais, and a multitude of sheep and killed twenty rebels; and much spoile daily was done then by the English.</P>
<P>At his Lordships going out of <HI>Leaz,</HI> some were received protection.</P>
<P>At this time his Lordship had letters of approbation from her Majesty, with a promise of supply both of horse and foot, and with advice to make the company lesse, there∣by
<PB N="70" REF="44"/>
to gratifie more Gentlemen with places of command.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> the twentieth, his Lordship returned to <HI>Dublin▪</HI> where hee heard of the complaints that were made against him by those of the Pale to the Lords in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In answer whereunto he writes to Master Secretary, onely desiring his good wil in candid interpretation of his actions</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the fourteenth, his Lordship takes his journey towards the North, and encampeth three miles beyond <HI>Dundalke,</HI> and lay there untill the eighth of <HI>October,</HI> it being most tempestuous foule weather, his Lordships Tent ha∣ving been often blown over.</P>
<P><HI>Tyrone,</HI> in the mean time, before his Lordship came, had possessed the <HI>Newry,</HI> a strong Fortresse as any the Rebels had, but his Lordship was resolved to cut his way through them if they made resistance.</P>
<P>Many skirmishes fell out well on our part, and in small time he came to <HI>Armagh,</HI> where not farre off his Lordship built a Fort in a very convenient place; having a River by it all environed with Bogs, &amp; a hill like a Promontory which his Lordship called Mount <HI>Norris.</HI></P>
<P>So hee sent some companies of ours to fetch corne and timber over the Bogs, where <HI>Tyrone</HI> met with them; and skirmishing with them was put to the worst, and next day <HI>Neale O Quin,</HI> was taken prisoner, <HI>Tyrones</HI> great Favourite.</P>
<P>And the rebels intending to hinder the building of the Fort were soundly beaten, and that finished and left in it foure hundred men under Captain <HI>Blany.</HI></P>
<P>His Lordship returning by <HI>Carlingford</HI> found the passage very difficult for his horse, that they were sent a little a∣bout; and now they had certaine intelligence that <HI>Tyrone</HI> was come downe unto a place, by which we were to passe.</P>
<P>Which was a very great Wood at the foot of a Moun∣tain, reaching so neer the Sea, that it had no more space, then
<PB N="71" REF="44"/>
that six or seven might walke abreast, with some lesse, and at full Sea none in some places.</P>
<P>His Lordship disposing his forces for the fight, sending out a forlorne hope to march afore, and a forlorne Reare.</P>
<P>The enemy sought to make good a small piece of ground like a semicircle, where the Sea made a Diameter, and a thick Wood the Circumference; and at the corner next to our Army, there ran a River out off the Wood at the side of which they made strong trenches, and at the further cor∣ner a Barricado which reached far into the wood, and down to the Sea.</P>
<P>The enemy appeared horse and foot on this plain, but at our mens going over the River, their horse drew into the Woods, and their foot into the Trenches, whence they poured out Vollies of shot.</P>
<P>But the stout courage of the English was such that in little space they beat them out of their Trenches and from their works, and made them retire into the woods, but sallied out againe upon our Reare; to their further losse.</P>
<P>And in all this not much hurt to us, only two Gentlemen of quality killed; not twenty lost, about sixty hurt, of the enemy eighty killed, and the losse was (as wee had intelli∣gence two hundred.</P>
<P>Our Marshall and Serjeant Major were always ready to assist the weak, and bring succour to the distressed, and the Army went on cheerfully.</P>
<P>And by this <HI>Tyrones</HI> reputation got a crack.</P>
<P>His Lordship returned to <HI>Dundalke,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Dublin,</HI> with his followers and Voluntiers, having disposed the horse and foot into Garrisons, Forts▪ and Provinces under their Commanders.</P>
<P>The horse were 1198. The foot 14150.</P>
<P>About <HI>November</HI> his Lordship sends into <HI>England,</HI> in the
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>
behalfe of two chiefe Rebels submitted <HI>Conner Roe M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Guire</HI> and his sonne, both which had done good service in the last North journey: and had taken <HI>Tyrones</HI> brothers el∣dest sonne, a yongman of the greatest hope in the North, and though three thousand l. were offered for his ransom, yet they brought him to the Lord Deputy. There were cer∣tain rebels neere <HI>Dublin,</HI> in the <HI>Glinne</HI> which in his Lord∣ships absence had done much spoile, so that his intent was to chastize them, but seeming and shewing to goe another way, that they should not suspect him, on Christmas day early in the morning, and after a tedious march he arrived at the chiefe rebels house, so suddenly that he took his wife and eldest sonne, and made him fly starke naked into the Woods, while his Lordship kept a good Christmas, in his house till the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> his souldiers wasting and spoyling the Country, in the mean time. And leaving Garrisons in some places, he passed into <HI>Trim</HI> in <HI>Eastmeth,</HI> and so to <HI>Danoar,</HI> in <HI>Westmeth</HI> a strong Castle, having visi∣ted many chiefe Gentlemen in the way.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> the two and twentieth, his Lordship had letters out of <HI>England,</HI> in which hee heard that the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> was in the Towre for treason; which news wrought much alteration in the Deputy; now hee begins to insinuate and comply with Secretary <HI>Cecill.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Essex</HI> irreparably fell, more perchance by the sharp∣nesse of his enemies wit, then by the burthen of his owne crime.</P>
<P>Howsoever the Deputy being privy to so much as hee was, he said he would not put his necke under the Queenes Attourneys tongue; and resolved with himselfe that had he been sent for into <HI>England,</HI> not to have undergone the ha∣zard of a triall: but his Lordships former service, and future employment blew over this storm without any shatter fal∣ling on him.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="45"/>But with countenance and good successe hee goeth for∣ward, and with courage to set on <HI>Tyrrils</HI> Island very strong, standing in the midst of a Bog, in the midst of a Plain neere an Abbey, where his Lordship proclaimed <HI>Tirrils</HI> head at two thousand Crowns, and so assayled the Island. But the next day, the foure and twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> so much snow fell that nothing could be done, and in the night the Rebels stole away quitting the Island, and left some store of corne, and a few cattell, so his Lordship passed beyond the Island into a Plain, destroying the corn and burning the houses as he went into <HI>Meth,</HI> and then to <HI>Trim,</HI> and so mar∣ched into the <HI>Ferney,</HI> from whence to <HI>Ardes,</HI> so seven miles to <HI>Mellifont,</HI> then to <HI>Drogedagh</HI> two miles, where he stayed untill the tenth of <HI>Aprill,</HI> and then went to <HI>Dublin,</HI> in all which passage nothing of moment was done, but visiting some chiefe Subjects, and striking terrour to the Rebels.</P>
<P>About this time his Lordship had order for the proclay∣ming of a base coine, and cry down the currant.</P>
<P>To hinder the Rebels traffick, as was pretended, but it proved the undoing of the poore souldier, each shilling having but two pence half-peny silver in it: so that commo∣dities were raised to an excessive rate; and the exchange which was formerly provided for their helpe, was growne difficult, or altogether put down.</P>
<P>At <HI>Drogedah,</HI> his Lordship altered the list of the foot, but not the horse: and disposed them into Garrisons.</P>
<P>Her Majesties charge in the yeere 1600 to 1601, by esta∣blishment, and orders for increase was 276914l. 9s. 4d.</P>
<P>Out of which by his Lordships providence was saved, 15262l. 6s. 5d.</P>
<P>Also by Checks imposed on the Army 1729l.</P>
<P>So the charges that yeere, besides munition and other ex∣traordinaries 234622.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="46"/>Certaine businesses that hapned in <HI>Munster,</HI> that yeere, under the command of the Lord President, Sir <HI>George Ca∣rew.</HI></P>
<P>In generall some submitted, and some revolted.</P>
<P>His Lordship comming to <HI>Dungarun,</HI> had notice that <HI>Florence Mac Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ie:</HI> though hee had received favours from the State, was entred into action (for so they call Rebellion) and raised in <HI>Carby</HI> and <HI>Desmond,</HI> of the Provincialls and <HI>Bonnaghs</HI> (for so are hired souldiers called) two thousand foot, never assailed the English untill they came betweene <HI>Kinsale</HI> and <HI>Cork,</HI> where they set on Captain <HI>Flowre</HI> Serjeant Major of <HI>Munster,</HI> who had 1200 foot, and 100 horse; who did valiantly resist and beat back the Rebels, though he had two horse killed under him; yet were 100 of the Rebels slain, upon which <HI>Florence Mac Carty</HI> submits, and yielded his son for pledge.</P>
<P>Now plots are laid for the killing of the titular Earle of <HI>Desmond,</HI> by one <HI>Dermod Oconner,</HI> who had married the Daughter of the old Earle of <HI>Desmond,</HI> and had the leading of 14000 <HI>Bonnaghs,</HI> who after surprised him by a tricke, and presently sent his wife to the Lord President for the mony promised in reward, and wished him to come to <HI>Kilm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>h,</HI> and there hee would bring him, but the Rebels in the way rescued him, and set him free again.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the twentieth, his Lordship took the field, and mar∣ched towards <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eck,</HI> and from place to place prosecuted the rebels so close that many submitted and others fled out of the Country: and the titular Earle of <HI>Desmond</HI> by Sir <HI>Charles Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> was quite driven out of the Countrey, in whose passage Sir <HI>George Thornton</HI> sent out the Garrison, and killed 120 of the Rebels, and got 320 Garrans laden with baggage, fifteen Pikes and Peeces, 40 horse; but lost sixteen horse of his owne in the fight, the titular Earle was quite
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>
broken and stole backe into <HI>Munster,</HI> and lived as a Wood Kerne, with three or foure in his company, and once againe being like to be surprized, he ran away in such hast, that he left his shooes behind him.</P>
<P>The Lord Deputy wasted and gathered in all the corne, so that the yeere following the Rebels were pinched, and in <HI>Munster</HI> all subdued or submitted, so that 400 of that Province received their pardons under the great Seal.</P>
<P>And all being quiet, hee did question the Corporate Towns that were so ready to assist the Rebels, as being ai∣ders and abetters of the rebellion for their owne private gaine.</P>
<P>And so he sent 1000 of the <HI>Munster</HI> List to the Lord De∣puty to be disposed at his pleasure.</P>
<P>The Lord Deputy and the Counsell wrote into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Tredagh,</HI> where he had layne from <HI>March,</HI> 21, untill <HI>Aprill</HI> the sixteenth following, to signifie that many chiefe rebels had submitted.</P>

<P>And further sollicited for supplyes of mony, victuals and munition, to be sent some to <HI>Dublin,</HI> but most to <HI>Galloway,</HI> for the forces to plant <HI>Ballishannon.</HI></P>

<P>About <HI>April</HI> divers Rebels in the North submit, and dis∣cover many secrets to our Captaine concerning the <HI>Spanish</HI> Invasion this yeare.</P>
<P><HI>Oghy Ohanlon</HI> submitted at <HI>Tredagh,</HI> and subscribed to di∣vers Articles.</P>
<P>The Garrison at <HI>Liffer</HI> did spoyle the rebels, and tooke 300 Cows.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="47"/>The Lord Deputy kept Saint <HI>Georges</HI> Feast at <HI>Dublin, April</HI> the twentieth, inviting many of the submitted Rebels, where he carryed himselfe with such wisdome and gravity; that they did both admire him and feare him.</P>
<P>In <HI>May, Munster</HI> Rebels had their pardons granted them upon the intercession of the Lord President.</P>

<P>And to hinder <HI>Tyrones</HI> gathering in the corn.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the two and twentieth, his Lordship parts from <HI>Du∣blin,</HI> and wrote into <HI>England</HI> for six thousand souldiers ready, if so be any forreigne aide should come, and to have a Ma∣gazine at <HI>Limrick,</HI> many pardoned in the County of <HI>Corke.</HI></P>
<P>And about the eight of <HI>June,</HI> his Lordship came neere the Pace of <HI>Moyry,</HI> where hee purposed to build a Fort to secure that Pace.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="47"/>Now againe, hee sollicits his former demands by Letters into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And so he marched by <HI>Dundalke</HI> to <HI>Lecagh,</HI> comming sud∣denly on them he took much booty, and many submitted to his Lordship in this passage, from thence he went to Mount <HI>Norris,</HI> and so hee intended to plant a Garrison at <HI>Armagh,</HI> and so forth hee went to <HI>Blackwater,</HI> to see that way to that Fort, where the Marshall <HI>Bagnal</HI> had his defeat.</P>
<P>The foure and twentieth, hee marched two miles short of the <HI>Newry,</HI> with a thousand two hundred and fifty foot, and an hundred and fifty horse.</P>
<P>The nine and twentieth day, his Lordship had notice that Sir <HI>Henry Davers</HI> had done much damage to <HI>Brisan mac Art,</HI> in killing his men, and taking his cattell.</P>
<P>Many received Pardons and were accepted of, because that certaine newes came, that the Spanish forces which lay at <HI>Lisbone,</HI> were to come for <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>So his Lordship disposed of the Companies into Garri∣sons and Forts neere the enemies Countrey, and went with his followers to <HI>Dundalke,</HI> having with him onely three com∣panies of foot, and a troop of horse; but going towards the North, he gathered some forces out of the Garrisons, so he went to a Hill neere Blackwater on the Southside, making a stand where <HI>Tyrone</HI> and his horse and foot shewed themselves in a Medow beyond the River with Trumpets, and Drums, and Colours which they used not to doe before, but now only in a bravado.</P>
<P>Making some shot at us, which being at too fat distance fell short without doing, any hurt, but we having a Rabenet and a Falcon planted on a little Hill, made some shot at the Rebels which made them seulke into the Woods like Pup∣pits.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="48"/>So that his Lordship sent 300 foot to a Hill close by the waterside; and at the evening came and encamped upon it, whence he saw <HI>Tyrone</HI> draw some horse over the water to our side; but Sir <HI>William G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lphin</HI> went with a troope of horse to meet him, but he presently retyred back.</P>
<P>So we placing the two small pieces, charging them with Musket shot, drove the Rebels out of the Trenches, which they had made beyond the River, so that the 300 men pas∣sed over the River and possessed them, and an adjoyning old Fort, with a plain, not altogether Musket shot from the Wood, where the Rebell was fled, and his Lordship seeing the Trenches did admire that they wold take so much pains to make that which they had so little care to keepe, so his Lordship went to view a Place in <HI>Tyrones</HI> Wood, who stood looking on us; who only made a few shot at our men in their retreat.</P>
<P>So the sixteenth his Lordship passing over the <HI>Blackwater,</HI> with a Regiment of <HI>Irish,</HI> marched to a place at the left hand of our Campe, at the entrance of a great Wood, where our men made a stand in a fair green Medow, having our Campe not farre behinde them, and the Wood at each side and before them; in which great multitudes of the Re∣bels were assembled; so that there hapned a great and large skirmish; with various accidents; sometimes they; some∣times wee giving ground; for the Lord Deputy drew our forces out of the Campe, as he saw the Rebels increase.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Latwar</HI> his Lordships Chaplaine, not content to see this in the Campe, went into the Medow to our Co∣lours, and was shot so that he died the next day.</P>
<P>Not one more slain of the English only a Captaines legg broken, but 26 of the Irish on our side, and 72 hurt, such as were kept in pay only, that they should not side with the Rebell.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="48"/>Among the Rebels <HI>Tyrones</HI> Secretary, and above two hundred Kernes were killed, which did much abate their courage, and animate our men.</P>
<P>His Lordship wrote into <HI>England,</HI> complayning of the scarcity of the victuals, and that which was, being salt fish, which as hee said was most unfit for marching, was not good nor wholsome.</P>
<P>His Lordship rising from about Blackwater, made ano∣ther Proclamation for <HI>Tyrones</HI> head at 1000l. and 2000l. to bring him alive.</P>
<P>So hee marched too and fro spoyling and cutting downe all the Corn thereabouts, and burning houses in the woods neere where the Rebels lay, but would not fight.</P>
<P>So he returned to the Blackwater, and with some choice foot and horse went to view the way to <HI>Dungannon, Tyron's</HI> chief house, ten miles distant, and setting some to cut down the wood the Rebels sought to hinder them, but were bea∣ten back, so after we marched six miles to <HI>Armagh,</HI> and three to <HI>Rawlaghtany.</HI></P>
<P>From whence Sir <HI>Hen. Davers</HI> with 300 foot and 40 horse, went to burn some houses that stood in a Fortresse which he performed, but the Rebels followed them back even to our Campe into which they poured a Volley of shot, and retyred into an adjoyning Fortresse.</P>
<P>Here the Commissary viewed the Army, and found in the List 2950, but by Pole 1728.</P>
<P>The fourth day at night the Rebels came with cryes, Drums and Bag-pipes, as if they would have attempted our Campe.</P>
<P>And poured into it two or three thousand shot, but do∣ing little hurt.</P>
<P>For his Lordship commanded that none of our men should stirre, having lodged in a Trench some 400 shot,
<PB N="80" REF="49"/>
with command that they should not give fire untill the re∣bels were neere; which doing they put up paid with the shot, and sent out lamentable cryes. So then his Lordship sent for more forces because hee had intelligence, that <HI>Ty∣ron's</HI> Army was much increased.</P>
<P>Now there came more certaine newes of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> comming, and of their intention to land at <HI>Waterford,</HI> in re∣spect of the commodious harbour, and the peoples good affection unto the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>A speedy supply of a thousand shot was required out of <HI>England,</HI> because <HI>Tyrone</HI> was growne very strong, as appea∣red by a list given by one that had been lately <HI>Tyrones</HI> Mar∣shall, and now received into favour: as followeth.</P>

<P>About this time some discourtesies hapned between the Lord Deputy and the Lord President of <HI>Munster,</HI> for that he had made some complaints of the Deputy in <HI>England,</HI> but by perswasion of Secretary <HI>Cecil,</HI> the Lord Presidents great friend, they were united as fast as greatnes will permit.</P>

<P>As also other letters from the Councell in <HI>England,</HI> that his Lordship would aske what supplyes were needfull, and that in convenient time.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the nineteenth, two thousand men out of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> arrived, some in <HI>Corke,</HI> and some in <HI>Waterford.</HI></P>
<P>And his Lordship writes for store of munition and vi∣ctuals, to be with all speed sent to <HI>Dublin,</HI> telling Ma∣ster Secretary that <HI>Tyrones</HI> very friends would faile with his fortune, and many others when they could rid themselves of the feare of him.</P>
<P>And that the Irish submitted Lords desired to continue subjects, if they might see appearance of defence, though perchance not so much out of their honest disposition, as for the smart they yet feele of a bitter persecution.</P>
<P>In <HI>June,</HI> the Queene wrote to the Lord Deputy with her own hand, a most gracious acceptance, and a free commen∣dations of his good service.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the three and twentieth, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet came into <HI>Kinsale,</HI> lying between <HI>Rosse</HI> and <HI>Corke</HI> Bay out into the South Sea: the Lord Deputy and Lord President of <HI>Mun∣ster,</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="50"/>
being both together with the Councell at <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> whence they road both to <HI>Corke.</HI></P>
<P>Where they understood the number of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be about six thousand, under the command of <HI>Don Jean de Aquila,</HI> who was one of the chiefest Commanders of the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and had been Generall in <HI>Britany:</HI> And that a thousand of them scattered by foul weather, were landed at <HI>Baltamore</HI> to the Westward of <HI>Kinsale.</HI></P>
<P>And that they expected (according to promise) great aid and assistance from the pretended Earle of <HI>Desmond</HI> and <HI>Florence, Mac Carty,</HI> who were both taken prisoners, and al∣ready sent into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And that they had brought sixteene hundred great Sad∣dles, for which <HI>Tyrone</HI> had promised to furnish them with horse, and then they would keepe the field, for they had likewise many armes in hope the Irish Rebels would sup∣ply them with men, which would revolt at their first ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>About <HI>October,</HI> many letters are sent into <HI>England,</HI> to the Counsell and to Master Secretary.</P>
<P>And he tels them, that seeing the occasions are so great, good supplies are to be sent with all speed, because defence must be made for the subject that hath means.</P>
<P>And money also, because the Swordmen which have no means, will goe to the enemy if wee entertain them not.</P>
<P>Thus his Lordship streightned for want of men, to sup∣presse the rebels in the North, and oppose the forreigne enemy in the South; but that God who accounts rebellion as the sin of Witchcraft, and an evill thought against law∣full Soveraignty impiety, did so counsell and incourage him, that collecting a small force together to <HI>Corke,</HI> hee shews himselfe in field, and presently marched within five miles of <HI>Kinsale,</HI> and on the 17 of <HI>October,</HI> within halfe a mile

<P>And the next night made a great salley, but were beaten back again.</P>
<P>Many skirmishes hapned between the <HI>English &amp; Spaniard,</HI> who always went backe by weeping crosse; by Gods pro∣vidence and the valour of our stout Commanders. So that <HI>Don Jean</HI> himselfe said hee never saw men come more wil∣lingly to the sword then ours.</P>
<P>There was little done by reason our artillery were not come to the Campe.</P>
<P>But the 26, our Campe rose and intrenched themselves very strongly on Spittle Hill, on the North side of <HI>Kinsale,</HI> a little above Musket shot of the Town.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Barkley</HI> with three other Captains, the night be∣fore falling into the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Trenches, made them forsake them; and fell into the gate of the Towne with them, and killed and hurt above 20 of them, having but three of our men hurt.</P>

<P>But many of these Companies were very deficient: the the 27. our Artilery were landed at Oyster haven, and brought into the Campe: and two Culverings were planted to batter the Castle of <HI>Rincovaur</HI> which the Spaniards pos∣sessed from their first comming, which Castle commanded the harbour of <HI>Kinsale,</HI> but one of the Peeces presently brake, so we planted two more, which grew so hot, that the enemy, seeing they could not bee releeved, neither by water nor land (for both had beene tryed, but in vaine) sent out a parly for Conditions that would not bee accep∣ted, but presently after for life only, which was granted, being 86 in number, and some 30 had beene slaine in the defence of it.</P>
<P>The Spaniards drew a demi Cannon out of the Towne, and did play into our Campe: the first shot killed two men, and indangered many, piercing his Lordships tent, the shot altogether falling about his quarter, some supplies of men, munition, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctuals, came out of <HI>England</HI> at this time, brought by the Earle of <HI>Thomond,</HI> and being noysed that <HI>Ty∣rone</HI> was comming downe with a great Army to joyne with the Spanyard; the campe was strongely fortified on the north side from the Towne; and the next day the Lord President with 2100. Foot, and 325 horse drew out into the borders of the Province to stop him, at least hinder his passage.</P>
<P>But the Spaniards getting intelligence of the Lord Presi∣dents
<PB N="85" REF="51"/>
going out of the Campe, and supposing us thereby to be much weakned, about noone they drew out most of their forces, and sent 60. shot and pikes to the foot of the hill neere our Campe, leaving their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enches very well lined.</P>
<P>Some entertained skirmish with those that did approach so neere; Others of our men went about and set upon the trenches, and beat the Spaniards out of them, so that when the formost retyred, supposing to have reliefe of their seconds which they left in the Trenches they were deceived, and faine to make haste into the Towne: many of them hurt and killed, a Serjant taken, so that <HI>Don Jean</HI> committed the Serjant ma∣jor: commended the valour of our men, and that his owne had lost their reputation.</P>
<P>And commanded that no man should after come off from his service, except he were fetched off by an Officer.</P>
<P>The 13. day ten great ships came into <HI>Kinsale</HI> under the command of Sir <HI>Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. Leveson,</HI> who brought 2000. Foot with Munition and Artillery: and Officers of all kinds to attend the same.</P>

<P>Out of which was chosen a flying Regiment (as they cal∣led it) to answer all alarmes, and were exempted from other duties.</P>
<P>The Horse 857.</P>
<P>The Castle <HI>Niparke</HI> upon a breach made by our cannon, yeelded only on condition of saving their lives, sixteen being only left in it; It stood in an Island beyond the water.</P>
<P>The Lord President returned with foure Regiments, two he carryed out, and two met him, and comming to the Campe, they quartered by themselves on the West side of <HI>Kinsale,</HI> and were commanded by the Earle of <HI>Thomand,</HI> for the Lord Pre∣sident went to the Lord Deputy.</P>
<P>The Towne with a Demi-Cannon played upon our Admi∣rall,
<PB N="86" REF="52"/>
and Vice-Admirall in the the harbour of <HI>Kinsale.</HI></P>
<P>And shot them throughout.</P>
<P>But our Shippe peeces presently dismounted the Demi∣cannon, and hurt their chiefe Gunner.</P>
<P>Our battery lay so continually upon the Towne on all sides, that did it much offend the enemy within, who impa∣tient that we built a fort close to the towne West gate.</P>
<P>Made a brave sally with 2000 men on our Ordinance on the East side, and made most furious assault, having brought with them tooles to cloy the Peeces, and to dismount them if possible.</P>
<P>And indevoured to pull downe the Gabions in our tren∣ches and baskets filled with earth, for the safegard of our Gunners and Cannoneeres.</P>
<P>But they found such resistance by the great courage of our men, that they were driven to retreate into the Towne, leaving above 120 dead in the place, and many slaine neere the towne, some others taken prisoners.</P>
<P>But on our side not many hurt, two Captaines and one Lievtenant killed.</P>
<P>Among the Spaniards at their shipping many of them were found to have Spells, Characters, and hallowed Me∣dalls, as preservatives against death.</P>
<P>A Drumme was sent to offer <HI>Don Jean</HI> to bury his slaine, who returned thankes, but withall prayed the Lord Deputie to see them buried, promising to doe the like for ours, when they fell in his power.</P>
<P>At this time newes came that sixe Spanish ships were put into <HI>Castle-haven,</HI> neere <HI>Baltamore,</HI> and sixe more were scat∣tered from them by foule weather, these six brought two thousand men, and many Ordnance and Munition, and news that 20000 more were comming.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Levison</HI> getting five or sixe ships out of the

harbour of <HI>Kinsale,</HI> got in little time into <HI>Castle-haven,</HI> and and sunke one Spanish ship.</P>
<P>The Admirall of the Spaniard having 9 Foot water in her hould drave on a rocke, and the Vice-Admirall and two others run aground, most of the Spaniards quitting them.</P>
<P>And so our Fleet returned to <HI>Kinsale.</HI></P>
<P>Into which harbour came a Scottish Barke laden with 80 Spaniards, who were by the Master put all into the hands of the English, so were landed and carryed into the Campe, upon whose examination divers discoveries were made, that great preparations were made for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that in <HI>Spain</HI> they doubted not but that it was taken already.</P>
<P>Now intelligence came to the Campe that <HI>O Donnell</HI> was joyned with the Spaniards that landed at <HI>Castle-haven,</HI> &amp; that he together with all the forces that <HI>Tyrone</HI> could make, would releeve <HI>Kinsale.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which our Campes did more strongly fortifie and intrench themselves for their owne defence.</P>
<P>And so had not leasure to follow the batteryes as they had done before, because the new supplies were much wa∣sted with hard service, and great sicknesse.</P>
<P>Two small Sconces were built at the West side of the Towne, betweene the Earle of <HI>Thomands</HI> quarter and the water, and so cast up trenches from place to place, to invest the town to the land, and hinder the driving in of the cattell into the town. <HI>O Donnels</HI> forces, are said to be 4000. and <HI>Ty∣rones</HI> 8000. which are all to joyne with the Spaniards, and lye not above sixe miles from our Campe.</P>
<P>A Letter was intercepted, sent to <HI>Oneale</HI> by the Spanish Generall.

<P>This newes made us ply our batteryes the more, and the like importunitie made <HI>Tyrone</HI> advance within a mile of us in the way to <HI>Corke.</HI></P>
<P>But some of our Foot drawing out of the Campe towards him; for that time he drew himselfe into the woo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>Our Army was but weake at this time, many sick, and some run away in number 6595.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="53"/><HI>Tyrone</HI> often shewed his Horse and Foot on a hill not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e off; and we had intelligence from one of <HI>Tyrones</HI> Comman∣ders that both he and the Spaniards resolved to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t our Campe together on all sides in the night.</P>
<P>But <HI>Tyrones</HI> guides missing the way, happened to be with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> an houre of day, when they were discried, in a plain not far from our Campe: where <HI>Tirrill</HI> led the vantgard wherin the Spaniards from Castle haven were, <HI>Tyrone</HI> leading their battell, and <HI>O Donnell</HI> their reare intending to force the great Campe.</P>
<P>But the Lord Deputy, with the Lord President having sate in Counsell all that night drew out some regiments. The Marshall Sir <HI>Richard Wingfield</HI> with 400 horse, and Sir <HI>Henry Fowers</HI> regiment advanced within 20 score of the e∣nemy, resolving to give them battell, two more regiments being come up; which the enemy perceiving retyred over a foard somewhat disorderly, and the Marshall seeing it de∣sired leave of the Lord Deputy to fight; which being gran∣ted to take occasion according to his discretion, hee pre∣sently marched forward over the foard.</P>
<P>The enemy still retyring further over the bogge into a plaine, hoping to find the bogge some safegard from us.</P>
<P>But the Marshall with some horse and foot went to the bogge side, and gave them occasion of skirmish; there their Battalians standing firme on the one side of the bogge, and our foot on the other.</P>
<P>In the meane time the Marshall found a way through the Foord to the ground where the Rebels stood, hee possessed the same with some foot, and presently got over three troope of Horse, with which he charged the enemies bat∣tailes of 1800 men, but finding them stand firme, wheeled about.</P>
<P>But now three troope of Horse more, and two Regiments
<PB N="90" REF="54"/>
of foot which were with the Lord Deputy, who stood not farre off with a vigilant eye, came all up.</P>
<P>So that the Marshall with the Horse charged home upon the reare of the Battell, which being Irish, and not used to fight in the plaine, especially seeing their horse dye, which were the chief Gentlemen (in number five or six hundred) were suddenly routed, and our men followed the execution. The other two Battels seeing the other routed, advanced to their succour, but the Lord Deputy sending another Re∣giment to charge on the flanke of the Vangard, which pre∣sently retyred disorderly, being followed by our horse and foot. But the Spaniards that were not so light footed, drew out by themselves, yet were soon broken (by a troope of horse led by Sir <HI>William God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lphin</HI>) and most of them kil∣led their Commander <HI>Don Alinza del Campo</HI> taken priso∣ner, together, with two Captaines, 7 <HI>Alfieroes,</HI> Ensignes or Colours (as we call them) and 40 souldiers.</P>
<P>In the mean time many of the light-footed Irish escaped away, by advantage of this execution done on the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> and all the mayn battaile except 60 were killed.</P>
<P>On our side little hurt, Sir <HI>Richard Greames</HI> Coronet kil∣led, some Commanders of quality hurt, and six souldiers hurt, many of our horses killed, and others hurt. Of the Irish 1200 left dead in the place, besides those that were killed in two miles chase. Wee took nine of their Ensignes, all their Drums, Powder, and two thousand armes.</P>
<P>And their destruction had been greater, had not the gree∣dinesse of our men in pillaging and rifling the <HI>Spaniards</HI> hin∣dred it.</P>
<P>And had not our foot been tired out with continuall ser∣vice, and our horse spent for want of provision to keepe them in good case, we had cut the throat of all the Rebels, for they never made resistance▪ nor looked behind them, but ran and shifted for their lives.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="54"/>His Lordship presently in the midst of the dead bodies, gave thanks to God for this great victorie.</P>
<P><HI>So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord, but let them that love him be as the Sun when he goeth forth in his might.</HI></P>
<P>The Rebels were upon report about six thousand foot, &amp; 500 horse, whereof 14 Captains slain, souldiers slain 1995.</P>
<P>His Lordship had not above 1200 foot, and lesse then 400 horse, so that it was Gods great goodnesse to give him the day.</P>
<P>And about noon he returned giving volleys of shot in manner of Triumph.</P>
<P>Which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the town hearing, who had layn still all this while expecting <HI>Tyrone,</HI> and now supposed that it had been he, made a sally out upon our Campe, but soone perceiving their errour, they did retire into the town again.</P>
<P>But made divers sallies out to hinder our making of tren∣ches, and other works which now we did most earnestly.</P>
<P>About the last of <HI>December, Don Jean</HI> sent to the Deputy about a parley, tearming him Vice-roy, and much complai∣ned of the treachery and falshood of the Irish.</P>
<P>And that if honorable conditions were offered, he would accept; and so after many parlyes and propositions, Arti∣cles were accorded on both sides.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Spaniard</HI> with all he had, and while they tarry be well intreated, and have things necessary for their mo∣ney: and sent safe away into <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>English</HI> ships, assoone as conveniently they may: paying for their passage, and leaving a pledge for the safe returne of them backe againe.</P>
<P>So our army went to refresh it self at <HI>Corke,</HI> and the <HI>Span.</HI> abroad in <HI>Kinsale;</HI> only <HI>Don Jean▪</HI> rode with the Deputy, and made means to his Lordship, that his Excellencie would shew some commiseration on the Spanish prisoners that were in <HI>Corke,</HI> that were in great extremity for want of pro∣vision in number 160.</P>

<P>His Lordship sent some Commanders to invest a strong Fort wherein lay all the goods of such Rebels as were fled into <HI>Tyrone:</HI> called <HI>Enishlanghen,</HI> which was seated in the midst of a great Bog, and no way accessable, but through thick Woods very hardly passable, and the Fort had about it two deep ditches both compassed with strong Pallisado's a very high and thick Rampire of earth, and timber, and well flanked with Bulwarks, and sixty souldiers for its de∣fence; who by the industry and valour of our men were made to yield, and men brought to his Lordship at the <HI>Newly.</HI></P>
<P>This done his Lordship took the field, <HI>Aug.</HI> 20, marched towards <HI>Armagh,</HI> and so spoyled <HI>Tyron's</HI> Country, who was fled into <HI>Fermanagh;</HI> from whence he went to a Fortresse at the bottome of <HI>Lough Earne,</HI> so that hee could not be ap∣proched, so that making wast thereabouts &amp; leaving Garri∣sons, at the end of Sūmer his Lordship returned to <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>October</HI> 20, many Rebels offered submission, espe∣cially many of <HI>Tyrones</HI> Captains, and <HI>Tyron</HI> himself writes an humble letter to the Lord Deputy.</P>

<P>And now <HI>Tyrone</HI> himself sues for the Queenes favour, which she is very unwilling to grant, supposing him not worthy to live, who had cost so many lives, and caused he

so much charge and trouble: yet the Deputy earnestly me∣diates, but it doth not appeare that ever shee did yield unto it; yet willing he should come in.</P>
<P>But <HI>Tyrone</HI> had little left but the grudging of the com∣mon people, which alwayes followes disasters, and exclay∣med that he had ingaged the ruine of his whole Nation, for his owne private disco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tents, and that these warres how∣soever beneficiall to him, yet were they most pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nicious to them. Thus <HI>Tyrone</HI> having almost, if not altogether worne out and wasted his friends and fortune, found it high time to seek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour and accept it upon any terms.</P>
<P>Which the Deputy having secret intelligence of (the Queens death not yet publikely knowne) made some haste to accept of his submission, lest another should have taken the beast out, that he had taken in his toyle.</P>
<P>And so <HI>March</HI> 30, 1603, at <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifont</HI> hee made his humble submission to the Deputy (sitting in a Chaire of State) on his knees, and in the company of the Deputy rode to <HI>Dublin, April</HI> 4.</P>
<P>At which time open tydings came of the death of that victorious Queen, and the happy comming in of K. <HI>James:</HI> do the Earle of <HI>Tyrone,</HI> made a new submission to the De∣puty, as to King <HI>James</HI> King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And now upon this change divers of the Towns and Ci∣ties, as <HI>Cork, Waterford,</HI> and <HI>Wexford,</HI> through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>educing of the Priests and Jesuits) had set up the Idolatrous Masse▪ and brought in Popish superstition, by force and violence, on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e suggestion, that K. <HI>James</HI> was a favourer of the same.</P>
<P>So the Deputy was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike to have a new businesse in hand by those that had not shewed themselves all this time; who seeing their hope of gaine gone, the rebellion growing to an end, themselves will venture to continue it rather then let it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ke.</P>

<P>But whether slides my eager pen, it was my promise to set a period to that sad Seene; and how meanly performed, no man knows better then my selfe.</P>

Rebels have liberty to combine and know their owne strength, for by delay the foe is incouraged, and his num∣ber animated by such as submit for feare of them, when they cannot be secured by us.</P>
<P>And if we have not such forces as may keepe and com∣mand the field, thereby to compell the Rebell to make re∣sistance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t one place with most of his forces, then will hee forrage and spoyle all abroid in the Country; but if hee be made unite in one head, then will he soone be driven to want of victuals, which will be apt to breed murmurings and mutinies among themselves.</P>
<P>And a warre of force will be great, costly, and large (as the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> said) and that will make the burden more deservedly to be complained of, then that of Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who did grieve and groane (as shee sayd) with her subjects, under so great a weight as the maintaining of 1400. foot, and 1500 horse, in a climate full of contagion, in a Kingdome utterly wasted.</P>
<P>Which forces ours must farre exceed, for although the Rebels have not such woods and fortresses as then, yet now are they equall in number, and farre more ready then for∣merly, and better exercised in feats of armes, and no doubt will make the best advantage of the hils and boggs, for the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> was wont to say that the warre in <HI>Ereland,</HI> was as aswell to be made with woods and bogges as men; It's not like the coursing of a Hare, but as the digging after an earthed Foxe from one angle to another.</P>
<P>It was then thought the savingst way to breake them by factions raysed among themselves, they being coveteous and mercenary; and will be hired to any thing, especially if the Iesuites and preaching Priests be but rooted out, which doe solder them so fast and close together, that were they quite banished; they would moulder asunder in short time of themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="60"/>Some obstructions were then like to happen, as ready to hinder the good progresse arising from the discountenan∣cing of the Generall by the supreame authority that im∣ployed him; his want of trusty friends to mediate and speed his proceedings; this feare raysed many jealousies in the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> head, and run him on the rash attempt to have (unw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rranted) the Service.</P>
<P>This made Lord <HI>Mountjoy,</HI> so labour to ingratiate him∣selfe with Secretary <HI>Cecil,</HI> a man powerful with the Queen, by which meanes all necessaries are timely sent unto him, himselfe incouraged to diligence, and had in honour and reputation in the eyes of his Souldiers. It was the only o∣verthrow of victorious <HI>Haniball,</HI> to bee secretly maligned, by the crafty wiles of <HI>Hanno</HI> working upon some thrifty humours of the Senators of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and ready to urge all his proceeding to his disadvantage.</P>
<P>And when some shall labour by false evidence to sway the opinion of his Supreame judge in the title of their fa∣vour and his deserts; this dealing may prove injurious to the service by whomsoever to be undertaken.</P>
<P>It was then thought fit for the further countenancing of the Generall, for to leave the disposing of many places, e∣specially the Companies of the supplies sent unto him, for so Gentlemen were kept in <HI>Ireland</HI> from being troublesome in importuning authority for Companies in <HI>England,</HI> &amp; men did more indeavour to deserve well being in the eye of him of whom they have, or else expect advancement, and by that meanes will he bee able to curbe the insolencies and misdemeanours, of many bad Captaines, who sue and presse hard for command to make a living, rather then out of any love to the cause or Countrey, or any affection to their Companies, as may appeare by keeping of them imperfect, and so lay the greater burden of service on the rest, or else
<PB N="102" REF="61"/>
by changing away some for such such as are not seruicea∣ble, as was attempted in the first Scottish imployment and knowing that their time is short, and at the end of the war begins (through their wast and improuidence, their misery) Captaines make harvest wages by reaping other men corne.</P>
<P>These crimes in the Queenes wisdome were thought so heynous, as that the offenders were made examples by ca∣sheering, degrading, and other notes of infamy.</P>
<P>And Captaines refusing to shew their Companies, when they were required by the Commissaries of the Mustors should be checked two moneths pay, which will prove no ill president to be now obserued.</P>
<P>Another inconvenience then happened in that there were not large Magazins of provision layd in the safe Townes lying on the Sea or great Rivers, for an Army has a large body, and much of it (like a frogs belly) and without that satisfaction the hands and knees are feeble.</P>
<P>And through the default of the Victualers there happe∣ned as great a mischiefe, that seeing the state of <HI>England</HI> ex∣ceeds all other Princes in their large allowance both by Sea and Land. So for the kind more nourishable, as hoofe and porke, where as the Spaniard and French feed-on hard pease and beanes, dry ruske, and insiped rice, easie to bee kept indeed.</P>
<P>But through the coozenage and deceit of the victualers, it is both cut short in quantity, and unsavoury, and un∣wholsome in the quality breeding diseases and infection a∣mong the poor souldiers. This is no news to any that have been in the late actions of the English, and will never be o∣therwise untill some severe course be taken with these cruell Harpies that ruine both King and people by uttering any musty provision.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="61"/>An excellent and commendable provision was then made for the sick; a Quest-house in the Towne, and carefully looked into, and to have their lendings in ready money, and surplussage allowed.</P>
<P>And for those that were sick or sickly in the Camp; their own means allowed them very duly.</P>
<P>Then a generall contribution from the Officers and Cap∣taines of the Army: amounting to fifty pound a week, be∣stowed in providing warm b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, meat and lodging; as was a great succour both to the sick and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aymed, not permit∣ting them to lye in the field scattered or neglected, as though by their losse of limbes or health, they had lost their Christianity, what is it that takes away the edge of their valour, that they dare not venture so boldly as they would, but this neglect and scorne that is offered them, or least the losse of a member prove more miserable then the losse of their lives.</P>
<P>But let us now goe on with better hopes, and resolutions becomming the English Nation, assuring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>selves there is now wealth and honour to be gotten as wel a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then, when di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs archieved the dignity of Earles, many Vis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts, 13 at the least.</P>

<P>Whose best commendations was, that the <HI>Irish</HI> at the first went on well, but according to their custome suddenly fell off; and leave their party ingaged, if they looke not to it.</P>
<P>So they did in a good cause, and with good company, but now all stained, and stand guilty of Rebellion, which is as the sin of witchcraft.</P>
<P>They became crest-falne, faint-hearted, that if follow∣ed with speed, <HI>actum est.</HI></P>
<P>The Tragedy is ended, they must all uncase.</P>
