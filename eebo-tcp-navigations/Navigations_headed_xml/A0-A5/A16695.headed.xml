And in that place the water was so clere that they myght se all the fysshes y<SUP>t</SUP> were aboute them wher¦of they were full sore agast / and the monkes counseyled saynt Brandon to synge no more. For all the fysshes lay than as they had slebe. And than saynt Brandon sayd drede ye not for ye haue kepte by two eesters the feest of the resurreccyon vpon the gretefysshes backe / and ther¦fore drede ye not of these lytell fysshes. And then̄e saynt Brandon made hym redy &amp; wente to masse &amp; badde his monkes to synge the best wyse they coude / and than a∣none al the fysshes a woke and came aboute the shyppe so thycke that vnneth they myght se the water for the fysshes / &amp; whan the masse was done all the fysshes de∣parted soo as they were no more seen. And seuen dayes they sayled al waye in that clere water. And than there came a southe wynde &amp; droue the shyppe northwarde where as they sawe an ylonde full derke and full of sten¦che &amp; smoke / &amp; there they herde grete blowynge and bla¦stynge of belowes / but they myght se noo tynge but
<PB REF="7"/> herde great thonderinge wherof they were sore aferde and blyssed them ofte / &amp; soone after there came one ster∣tynge out all brenynge in fyre and stared full gastly on them with great starynge eyen / of whome the monkes were agaste / &amp; at his departynge fro them he made the horyblest crye that myght be herde / &amp; soone there came a great nombre of fendes &amp; assayled them with hokes &amp; brennynge yron malles / whiche ranne on the water fo¦lowynge theyr shyppe fast in suche wyse that it semed all the see to be on a fyre / but by the pleasure of our lorde they hadde noo power to hurte ne greue them ne theyr shyppe wherfore the fendes began to rore and crye and threwe hokes and malles at them / and they than were fore aferde &amp; prayed to god for cōforte &amp; helpe for they sawe y<SUP>e</SUP> fendes al aboute the shyppe &amp; them semed than all the ylonde &amp; the see to be on a fyre / &amp; with a sorowful crye all tho fendes departed fro them / &amp; retourned to y<SUP>e</SUP> place that they came fro. And than saynt Brandon told to them that this was a parte of hell / &amp; therfore he char∣ged them to be stedfaste in the fayth For they sholde yet se many a dredefull place or they came home agayne / &amp; than came the south wynde &amp; droue theym ferther in to the north where they sawe an hylle all of fyre / &amp; a foule smoke &amp; stenche comynge fro thens / &amp; the fyre stode on eche syde of the hyll lyke a wal all brennynge and than one of his monkes began to crye &amp; wepe full sore &amp; sayd that his ende was comen &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> he myght abyde no len∣ger in the shyppe / and anone he lepte out of the shyppe into the see &amp; than he cryed and rored full pyteously cur¦synge the tyme that he was borne &amp; also fader &amp; moder that begate hym bycause they sawe no better to his cor¦reccyon in his yonge age. For now I must go to perpe¦tuall payne. And than the sayenge of saynt Brandon
<PB REF="8"/> was verefyed that he sayd to hym whā he entred / ther¦fore it is good a man to do penaunce &amp; forsake synne for the hour of deth is incertayn And than anone the wyn¦de tourned in to the northe &amp; droue the shyppe in to the south whiche sayled seuen dayes cōtynually. And than they came to grete a rocke stondynge in the see / &amp; theron sate a naked man in full great myserye and payne. For the wawes of the see had so beten his body that all the flesshe was gone of / and no thynge lefte but synewes &amp; bare bones. And whan the wawes were gone / there was a canuas that hynge ouer his heed whiche bette his body full sore with the blowynge of the wynde. And also there were two oxe tonges / and a great stone that he sate vpon the whiche dyd to hym full great ease And than saynt Brandon charged hym for to tell hym what he was. And he sayd my name is Iudas y<SUP>t</SUP> soll¦de our lorde Ihesu cryste for .xxx. pens whiche sytteth here soo wretchedly / how be it I am worthy to be in the gretest payne that is. But our lorde is so mercyful that he hath rewarded me better thā I haue deserued For of ryght my place is in the brennynge fyre of helle. But I am here but certayne tymes of the yere that is fro crystmasse to twelfth daye and fro eester to wytson tyde be paste and euery feestfull daye of our lady &amp; eue∣ry saterdaye at none tyll sondaye that euensonge be do∣ne but all other tymes I lye styll in hell in full brennyn¦ge fyre with Pilate / Herode &amp; Cayphas therfore accur¦sed be the tyme that euer I knewe them And than Iu¦das prayed saynt Brandon for to abyde styll there all that nyghte / and that he wolde kepe hym styll that the fendes sholde not fetche hym to hell. And than he sayd to hym with goddes grace / thou shalte abyde here all this nyght And than he asked. Iudas what cloth that
<PB REF="8"/> was that henge ouer his heed &amp; he sayd it was a clothe that he gaue vnto a lepre / whiche was bought with the money that he stale fro our lorde whan I bare his purse / wherfore it dooth to me full great payne now in betynge my face with the blowynge of the wynde. And these two oxe tonges that hāge here aboue me I gaue them somtyme to two preestes to praye for me / them I bought with myn owne money / &amp; therfore they ease me bycause the fysshes of the see gnawe on thē &amp; spare me And this stone that I syt on laye somtyme in a desolate place / where it eased noo man / and I toke it thens and layde it in a foule waye where it dydde moche ease vnto them that wente by that waye. And therfore it easeth me now / for euery good dede shal be rewarded &amp; euery euyll dede shalbe punysshed. And on the sonday ayenst euen there came a great multytude of fendes blastynge and rorynge / &amp; they bad saynt Brandon goo thens that they myghte haue theyr seruaunte Iudas / for we dare not come in the presence of our mayster but yf we bryn∣ge hym to hell with vs. And than sayd saynt Brandon I lette not you to do your maysters commaundement but by the power of our lorde Ihesu I charge you to le¦ue hym this nyghte tyll to morowe. How darest thou helpe hym that solde his mayster for .xxx. pens vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> Iewes / and caused hym also to dye y<SUP>e</SUP> moost shamefull deth vpon the crosse. And than saynt Brandon char∣ged the sendes by his passyon that they sholde not noye hym that nyght. And than y<SUP>e</SUP> fendes wente theyr waye rorynge and cryenge towardee hell to theyr mayster y<SUP>e</SUP> great deuyll / &amp; than Iudas thanked saynt Brādon so ruefully that it was pyte to se and on the morne the fen¦des came with an horryble noyse sayenge y<SUP>t</SUP> they had that nyghte suffred great payne by cause they broughte
<PB REF="9"/> not Iudas and sayd that he sholde suffre double payne the .vi. daye folowynge &amp; they toke than Iudas trem∣blynge for fere w<SUP>t</SUP> them to payne. And after saynt Brā∣don sayled south warde thre dayes &amp; thre nyghtes &amp; on the fryday they sawe an ylonde. And than saynt Bran∣don began to synge &amp; sayd I se y<SUP>e</SUP> ylonde wherin saynt Poule the heremyte dwelleth &amp; hath dwelled there .xl. yere without mete &amp; drynke ordyned by mannes hon¦de / &amp; they came to the londe saynt Poule came &amp; welco¦med them humbly he was olde &amp; forgrowen so that no man myght se his body Of whome saynt Brādon sayd wenynge / now I se a man that lyueth more lyke an aū¦gell than a man / wherfore we wretches may be asha∣med that we lyue no better. Than saynt Poule sayd to saynt Brandon / thou arte better than I for our lorde hath shewed to the moo preuitees than he hath done to me / wherfore thou oughtest to be more praysed than I To whom sayd Brandon saynt / we be monkes &amp; must labour for our mete. But god hath prouyded for the su∣che mete as thou holdest the pleased / wherfore thou art moche better thā I. To whome saynt poule sayd som¦tyme I was a monke of saynt Gatrikes abbey in yrlon¦de &amp; was warden of the place where as men entre in to saynt Patrykes purgatorye. And on a daye there came one to me &amp; I asked hym what he was. And he sayd I am your abbot Patryke &amp; charge the that thou departe fro hens to morne erly to the see syde &amp; there thou shalte fynde a shyppe in to whiche thou muste entre / whiche god hath ordeyned for y<SUP>t</SUP> whose wyll thou must accom¦plysshe / &amp; so the nexte day I arose &amp; wente forth &amp; soūde the shyppe in whiche he entred / &amp; by the purueyūce of god I was brought in to this ylonde the seuenth daye after. And than I left the shyppe &amp; wente to londe and
<PB REF="9"/> there I walked vp &amp; downe a good whyle. And than by the purueyaūce of god there came an otter goynge on his hynder fete &amp; brought me a flynt stone &amp; an yron to smyte fyre within his two sore clawes of his fete / &amp; also he had aboute his necke great plente of fysshes whi¦che he caste downe before me &amp; wente his waye and I smote fyre &amp; made a fyre of styckes &amp; dyde sethe y<SUP>e</SUP> fysshe by whiche I lyued thre dayes. And thā the otter came agayne &amp; brought me fysshe for other thre dayes &amp; thus he hath done this .li. yere thorugh the grace of god / and there was a great stone out of the whiche our lorde ma¦de to sprynge fayre water clere &amp; swete / wherof I dryn¦ke dayly &amp; thus haue I lyued one &amp; fyfty yere &amp; I was forty yere olde whan I came hyder &amp; am now an hon∣dred and .xi. yere olde &amp; abyde tyll it please our lorde to sende for me and yf it please hym I wolde fayne by dys¦charged of this wretched lyfe / and than he badde saynt Brandon to take of the water of the well &amp; to cary in to his shyppe / for it is tyme y<SUP>t</SUP> thou departe for thou hast a great Iourney to do for thou shalte sayle to an ylōde whiche is forty dayes saylynge hens / where thou shalt holde thy cester lyke as thou hast done tofore where as the tre of byrdes is &amp; fro thens thou shalte sayle in to y<SUP>e</SUP> londe of byhest &amp; shalte abyde there forty dayes. And af¦ter retourne home in to thy countre in saufte. And than these holy men toke leue eche of other &amp; they wept both full sore &amp; kyssed eche other. And than saynt Brandon entred in to his shyppe &amp; sayled euē .xl. dayes southe in full great tempest. And vpon eester euen came to theyr {pro}curatour whiche made to them good chere as he had before tyme &amp; from thens they came to the great fysshe where they sayd matyns &amp; masse on ester daye / &amp; whan the masse was done the fysshe began to meue &amp; swāme
<PB REF="10"/> forth fast in to see wherof the monkes were sore agast whiche stode vpon hym / for it was a great meruayle to se suche a fysshe as great as al a countree for to swȳme soo faste in the water / But by the wyll of our lorde this fysshe set all the monkes a londe in the paradyse of byr∣des all hole &amp; soūde. And than retourned to the place he came fro. And than saynt Brandon &amp; his monkes than¦ked our lorde of theyr delyueraunce of the great fysshe &amp; kepte theyr eestertyde tyll trynyte sondaye lyke as they had done tofore tyme &amp; after this they toke their shyppe and sayled eest .xl. dayes / &amp; at the forty dayes ende it be∣gan for to hayle ryght fast. And therwith came a derke myste the whiche lasted longe after whiche fered saynt Brandon &amp; all his monkes &amp; prayed vnto our lorde for to helpe them. ¶ And than anone came theyr procura∣tour &amp; badde them to be of good chere for they were co∣men in to the londe of byheest. And sone after that myst passed awaye / and anone they sawe the fayrest countree westwarde that ony man myght se &amp; was soo cleere and bryght that it was an heuenly syght to beholde. And al the trees were charged with rype fruyte &amp; herbes full of floures. In whiche londe they walked forty dayes but they coude not se none ende of that londe and there was all way day &amp; neuer nyght / &amp; the londe was attem¦perate / ne to hote ne to colde. And at the laste they came to a fayre ryuer / but they durst not goo ouer. And there came to them a fayre yonge man &amp; welcomed them cur¦toysly &amp; called eche of them by his name &amp; dyde great re¦uerence to saynt Brandon and sayd to them be ye now Ioyfull / for this is the londe that ye haue sought. But our lorde wyll that ye departe hastely &amp; he wyll shewe to you more of his secretes whan ye come agayne in to the see / &amp; our lord wyll that ye lade your shyppe with
<PB REF="10"/> the fruyte of this londe and hye you hens. For ye may no lēger abyde here / but thou shalte sayle agayne in to thyn owne countre. And soone after that thou comest home thou shalte dye. And this water that thou seest here departeth the worlde a sondre. For on that other syde of this water may no man come that is in this lyfe And the fruyte that ye se here is alwaye thus rype eue∣ry tyme of y<SUP>e</SUP> yere / &amp; alwaye it is here lyght as ye now se &amp; he that kepeth our lordes hestes &amp; cōmaūdemētes at all tymes shall se this londe or he do passe out of this worlde. And than saynt Brandon and his monkes to∣ke of that fruyte as moche as they wolde and also they toke with theym great plente of precyous stones. And than they toke theyr leue &amp; wente to shyppe wepynge sore bycause they myghte noo lenger abyde there. And than they toke theyr shyppe &amp; came home in to yrlonde in saufte / whome thyr bretherne receyued with ryght great Ioye gyuenge thankynges vnto our lorde, whi∣che had kepte them all that seuē yere fro many a peryll and brought theym home in saufte. To whome begy∣uen honour and glorye worlde without ende. Amen. ¶ And soo soone after this holy man saynt Brandon wexed feble &amp; seke / &amp; had but lytell Ioye of this worlde but euer after that his Ioye &amp; mynde was in y<SUP>e</SUP> Ioyes of heuen. And within shorte tyme after he beynge full of vertues departed oute of this worlde vnto euerla∣stynge lyfe in heuē and was worshypfully buryed in a fayre abbey / the whiche he hymselfe foūded where our lorde sheweth for this holy saynt many fayre myracles wherfore let vs deuoutly praye to this holy saynt that he praye for vs to our lorde that he haue mercy on vs to whome be gyuen lande honoure and empyre worlde, withouten ende.
