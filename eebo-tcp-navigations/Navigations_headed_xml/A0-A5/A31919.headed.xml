<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving the opportunity of this bearer a Gentleman my neare Neighbour, I could not let him passe without a sa∣lute in a line or twaine, hoping of your health and welfare with the rest of your Family; as thanks be to God, mine are herein, at this present.</P>
<P>For Newes I doe earnestly desire you to impart such of probability, as shall come to your hearing, besee∣ching the Almighty God, to guide and direct all pro∣ceedings in that Honourable and High Court of Par∣liament, to his glory, and the content and happinesse of all his Majesties Kingdomes. I desire much to heare how the Papist Rebels proceed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for we have too many ill-affected Papists amongst us here in our Countrey.</P>
<P>And for our Castle of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> it was of late in the custody of one Mr. <HI>Traford</HI> a Papist, whereby great jealousies were in most mens minds raised, for
<PB REF="3"/>for the Castle is a place of a most impregnable strength, and Scituated upon a Rocke, with infinite store of Vaults and hollow Caves underground, able to receive infinite store of men, and horses, with all o∣ther furnitures of Ammunition for Warre, which the Governours of the Towne taking into their considera∣tion, caused a very strong guard and watch to be kept about it night and day, in which posture it stands yet, Messengers bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent up to the Honourable House of Parliament, there is a Vault in the Castle called <HI>Mortimers</HI> Hole, which is wide and very spacious, and a great dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce from thence. Another Cave cal∣led <HI>Mortime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> watering-place, in all which places it is supposed above two thousand men with Horses and Furniture may be kept and concealed.</P>
<P>The suspition of all which was much more increa∣sed by a Rumour of great quantities of meate killed by Mr. <HI>Trafords</HI> appointment against <HI>Christmas,</HI> with a great many of Beefes, Muttons, and Hogs, he him∣selfe being a neere Gentleman, and keeping ordinarily but a small Retinue of Servants about him, since the Officers of the Towne have taken that strict Course of watching and warding about the Castle, he hath removed his dwelling into a Lodge of a Parke neere adjoyning, where he keepes very privately, and some suppose he is gone away from thence secretly, we are so distracted at these occasions here about us, that no man almost (for feare of treacheries, and Plots from the Papists) dares goe to the Church without his Pistoll, and sword by his side, I beseech God that Peace and quietnesse may be setled amongst us.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Our fidelity &amp; constancy have bound me unto you, and although our de∣signe tooke no b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter effect, I shall with the lesse value, or prize your Reall disposition. For I am none of those men, who by the successe in their proceedings, and who thinke none deserving, but those whose actions are crowned with happy and prosperous event, and so measure the event, and not the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use.

Our power is daily encreased and strengthened in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and I am certaine, that had we as much opportunity as strength, we might obtaine our desires here in <HI>England,</HI> but we must waite and expect for our best advantage, and not be like your too hasty Mothers, who whilest they doe too much hasten the birth of their issue, they bring forth abortives. Patience will mature and produce what rashnesse and too much hast would otherwise de∣stroy
<PB REF="4"/>and ruinate. We have yet done nothing that we need feare, onely that our Adversaries as yet are the stronger, if to be Loyall and faithfull to his Majesty be culpable, we must plead guilty, who yet have done nothing, but what was for the secu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity of his Crowne and Priviledge, if it be dema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded why I have absented my selfe, I shall not be wanting of sufficient reason for their satisfaction. Let me vnderstand from your owne hand the condition of the times, as soon as I arrive you shall have intelligence of it, I could wish you with me, but I hope and am almost confident, that you are se∣cure, where you now abide, for they have not any pow∣er for what hath yet been enterprized any way to pu∣nish, or question, nothing being acted either against the King or Common-wealth. Bee carefull in your carriage and discourse, for you have many which daily lye in waite to entrap you; But I shall not need to counsell you any further, but for the present, take my leave, and rest.</P>
